[00:06:09] going to open up this pack and we're
[00:06:10] going to see what we get in this pack of
[00:06:12] duskborn all right this was uh from a
[00:06:15] giveaway last night and we just didn't

[00:06:29] what are you going to get my
[00:06:33] friend we're randomizing that one for
[00:06:35] you we have a creeping peeper grasping
[00:06:38] long neck fear of lost
[00:06:42] teeth stock researcher rip chane Razer
[00:06:45] kin cult
[00:06:46] healer resurrected cultist fear of imp
[00:06:51] imposters rise of the
[00:06:54] moth there a few let's zoom in a little
[00:06:56] bit better we should zoom in a little
[00:06:58] better I can't believe I didn't do that
[00:07:00] fear of failed test threats around every
[00:07:02] corner oh look at that a little Central
[00:07:05] elevator promising stairs not bad
[00:07:07] ravenous Carnival cautious Survivor and

[00:37:10] um spots in the break you will see all
[00:37:14] of them have their cards listed and
[00:37:15] their prices on them um you're either
[00:37:17] can get one of those cards randomly or
[00:37:19] you'll get the adamantium tank they out
[00:37:22] of uh the 93 spots that are left and it
[00:37:26] randomizes it as you see on screen there
[00:37:28] and it shows you what they
[00:37:29] are literally so this so for
[00:37:33] instance Heathen DK just got anthem of

[00:37:48] Champions
[00:37:50] 344 that's the um different
[00:37:56] one so I got to find that anthem of
[00:38:04] Champions sorry it's going to take me a
[00:38:06] second
[00:38:07] there just because I do not have them
[00:38:09] those ones in alphabetical order yet
[00:38:12] those are I was working on getting that
[00:38:14] stuff worked on for
[00:38:20] tomorrow anthem of Champions
[00:38:32] anthem of
[00:38:37] Champions come on where is
[00:38:43] that anth Champions I know I have it
[00:38:46] it's going to take me a second to find
[00:38:53] it there it is anthem of Champions 344
[00:38:57] like I said things aren't just not in
[00:39:00] order there you go my friend so that's
[00:39:02] what you got and I'm going to run this
[00:39:03] again so if somebody else wants to try
[00:39:05] they can and he
[00:39:10] then DK got that I'll put him over there
[00:39:15] hey have a good one RJ thank you for
[00:39:16] coming
[00:39:17] in thank you buddy I appreciate you
[00:39:20] coming in hanging out so there you go
[00:39:23] that's how that works there for you guys
[00:39:31] and I'm going to get another giveaway
[00:39:32] running here we'll get another giveaway
[00:39:34] running here so there we go so for
[00:39:37] instance I just win and you got
[00:39:39] pugnacious Hammer skull all right we'll
[00:39:41] pull out the pugnacious Hammer
[00:39:44] skull
[00:39:47] now I was going to do another higher
[00:39:50] priced one for you guys I was thinking
[00:39:52] some people might
[00:39:54] like the pugnacious Hammer skull
[00:40:01] seriously I know I got it here just
[00:40:04] don't know where I put
[00:40:12] it a that's another one I have to look
[00:40:15] around for all right all right so
[00:40:17] they're going to give you another chance
[00:40:18] instead of that so you get a second
[00:40:19] chance instead of that because we don't
[00:40:21] have it right away there and that's what
[00:40:22] we do and I'm going to get rid of
[00:40:23] pugnacious Hammer skull from everything
[00:40:27] so I don't see it now where's P Sam
[00:40:32] skull happens sometimes when you have
[00:40:35] like 2,000 cards and then you get just
[00:40:38] rerun of a chance but next time you
[00:40:40] actually got a better card you got plant
[00:40:42] sapling well in the same ones we were
[00:40:44] still in
[00:40:46] P that's
[00:40:49] funny

[00:41:06] no where did I just put all those
[00:41:10] too holy
[00:41:15] crap put them in the wrong P area which
[00:41:19] is why I can't find
[00:41:25] things all righty you just got
[00:41:32] plant sapling double
[00:41:37] faced that one

[01:46:37] there's um I drink a lot of the um uh
[01:46:40] what is that the
[01:46:42] uh

[01:46:54] brand monsters yeah I drank a lot of

[01:46:58] you the thorn bolt out here right after
[01:47:00] I open this pack for our friend here all
[01:47:01] right for
[01:47:04] Hayden I'm trying to think of the other
[01:47:06] brand that I had but it was like an
[01:47:08] espresso one but I like I like espresso
[01:47:10] though I think that's part of the reason
[01:47:11] why all right we're going to get you
[01:47:13] some good luck here we're going to go
[01:47:14] one two three four five six seven eight
[01:47:17] because we like to put our spoilers at
[01:47:18] the end here all right Hayden normally
[01:47:19] you see that and you genuinely like it
[01:47:21] you're good with that so
[01:47:23] that's what we're doing for that all
[01:47:26] right my
[01:47:27] friend we're going to roll this over and
[01:47:29] get
[01:47:30] you a planes to start with congregation
[01:47:34] Griff Longhorn Sharpshooter emergent
[01:47:38] haunting Rodeo pyromancer mystical
[01:47:41] tether consuming ashes dance of tumble
[01:47:45] weeds Savage smash ride down there you
[01:47:49] go nice foil there oh Nexus of becoming
[01:47:53] dude Hayden that's a nice pickup of a
[01:47:57] Mythic really oh tiny bones pickpocket
[01:48:00] and the oh no look at that the poster
[01:48:04] tiny bones pickpocket poster catechism
[01:48:08] prospecting in the extended art crackle
[01:48:11] with power with your board with your um
[01:48:14] showcase and a bedevil showcase foil
[01:48:17] with a treasure token wow that was a
[01:48:19] good pack
[01:48:21] there um I justed used um there's a
[01:48:23] break feature that we have um but when
[01:48:26] the by using that it allows me to do
[01:48:29] randomization and that way I can I can
[01:48:31] do up to 100 things I'd I'd rather do
[01:48:33] more I would like to be able to do more
[01:48:35] than 100 um because that would be very
[01:48:37] nice to be able to do that but what I do
[01:48:39] is I just put it in there instead of the
[01:48:41] spots being like what the name of it is
[01:48:43] and the cut packs you're going to open
[01:48:44] or whatever it's going to be um I just
[01:48:47] name it all the literally the name of
[01:48:49] the card with the um the price next to
[01:48:51] it so you know what you're getting so it
[01:48:53] does the randomization of your spot and
[01:48:55] that spot is like this kind of like the
[01:48:57] pull box in a
[01:48:58] way so like it's a whatever the spot is
[01:49:01] in the pull box is what it
[01:49:03] is so let me get all these together I'm
[01:49:06] going to put your tiny bones with your
[01:49:08] Nexus of be guming because that was a
[01:49:10] big hit
[01:49:14] dude I under it I list it under um well
[01:49:18] the category that I listed under isn't
[01:49:20] sports cards I just list I do um other I
[01:49:23] think it is when you go into red and
[01:49:24] make a
[01:49:25] break but um it gives you an option when
[01:49:28] you say add something when you're in
[01:49:29] your show you can only do it in your
[01:49:31] show oh Hayden I already have your
[01:49:32] written down you can only do it when
[01:49:35] you're in a show so that's one of the
[01:49:36] things you do need to
[01:49:42] remember so you have to have a show made
[01:49:44] and then once you're in it you go to add
[01:49:46] no you can do it before you're live I
[01:49:48] can so like say you create a show
[01:49:50] tonight for tomorrow morning you can go
[01:49:52] in the show tonight and set it up so
[01:49:54] it's ready for tomorrow morning it's
[01:49:56] kind of how it goes but um that's if
[01:49:58] you're available if you have it I don't
[01:49:59] know if the break feature is available
[01:50:00] for everyone yet but that was a good
[01:50:03] pack there that was a very good pack
[01:50:05] there now let's get out our one here for

[02:16:15] old card games um if it's just something
[02:16:18] cheap like not not lot not costing a lot
[02:16:20] type thing
[02:16:21] but here we go we're going to run uh but
[02:16:23] that's pretty sweet I need to go start
[02:16:24] looking out some things myself because
[02:16:25] I'm in the area we can do that we don't
[02:16:27] have them frequently so let me um we're
[02:16:30] on this one again for you guys to get

[02:17:22] heck why am I having a hard time finding
[02:17:25] this one give me a second
[02:17:36] here oh it's one of those ones that's
[02:17:39] why it's one of the test cards give me
[02:17:43] one second I got to find it I know where
[02:17:44] it might be in a different pile of test
[02:17:46] cards cuz I put them off the side
[02:17:47] somewhere give me a second that is is
[02:17:51] here I just got to find it in the other
[02:17:52] area I'll get you that one that's one of
[02:17:55] the test cards I pulled the test cards
[02:17:57] all off to the side recently cuz I was
[02:17:59] looking at him that's why that's why I
[02:18:01] got it I'll get that over here in a
[02:18:02] second though I'll put that over your a
[02:18:04] second there we'll
[02:18:07] randomize uh oh why is it going oh there
[02:18:09] that again there let me find the others
[02:18:11] where did I put all those all right
[02:18:44] find it over these all right I got that
[02:18:46] for you coming up here let me hang on
[02:18:49] we're going to run that again cuz it
[02:18:50] wasn't in that pile so you're going to
[02:18:51] get a second chance I'm going to remove
[02:18:52] that from there so you're going to get a
[02:18:54] second chance at the Marvel one that
[02:18:56] happens every now and again when I
[02:18:57] happen to make a mistake and something
[02:18:59] might not be in there so you get a
[02:19:01] second
[02:19:03] chance is what that hat
[02:19:08] means it's pretty nice for you but now I
[02:19:11] need to take it
[02:19:14] out got a second chance and you ended up
[02:19:16] getting a better card in the first place
[02:19:19] look at that anth
[02:19:23] Champions is a 447 477 where is that 477
[02:19:28] Anthem
[02:19:29] Champions it is an extended art one I do
[02:19:33] have those in here I'm going to find
[02:19:36] them because they're not organized and
[02:19:39] if I run past Anthem a Champions just
[02:19:40] say something for
[02:19:42] me my ah son my glasses are broken so
[02:19:46] I'm doing my best here trying to see
[02:19:48] everything
[02:19:51] when I'm going through stuff so if I
[02:19:52] miss something do make a comment to me
[02:19:59] please do make a comment if I happen to
[02:20:02] miss

[02:20:17] seriously is where did I put them all
[02:20:20] oh did I put those all together and put
[02:20:22] them away I might have put those all
[02:20:23] together because I had them I had them
[02:20:25] in a hand all of a sudden and I put them
[02:20:27] all together in way I did I think I put
[02:20:30] them in the right place over here with
[02:20:36] A's yes I
[02:20:38] did anthem of
[02:20:40] Champions there you go anthem of

[02:21:23] wanted the uh
[02:21:26] Gata this one you're talking about I
[02:21:29] think there's another one here
[02:21:36] somewhere is there a different
[02:21:39] one did I have like a like a did I have
[02:21:42] another like the extended art one or
[02:21:47] something I don't know if I did but I
[02:21:49] know I have the one
[02:21:51] there you got the one right
[02:21:57] there what is
[02:22:01] of that was the only one you're talking
[02:22:03] about are you talking I don't know if I
[02:22:04] had a different
[02:22:06] one I don't think I had another one I
[02:22:08] think that's the only one I had but
[02:22:09] maybe I'm wrong right now because
[02:22:11] there's another one maybe it's the foil
[02:22:14] one that's what it
[02:22:16] was oh there we go there's a there's a
[02:22:19] guata right there I didn't know I had
[02:22:20] that that one I forgot about that yeah
[02:22:21] that's why oh that's a brand new one
[02:22:23] that's why a brand new one that's why
[02:22:24] one of the new ones we
[02:22:27] had does not foil there is a foil Gata
[02:22:31] font of Hope and the Gata font of hope
[02:22:33] there is that what you're looking
[02:22:39] for but there you go anthem of Champions
[02:22:41] we got yours out there we'll run this
[02:22:43] again if anybody wants and we'll get a
[02:22:45] giveaway here running again quickly and
[02:22:48] our sold our last giveway went the C
[02:22:52] chameleon all right I need a number
[02:22:53] between one and 10 from the chameleon
[02:22:56] could you give me that and then we can
[02:22:57] see what you get for all of them all the
[02:23:03] yatas is that what you're asking or just
[02:23:18] like each one all right so
[02:23:27] um so these would
[02:23:31] be this be uh for both of these I'd say
[02:23:34] $2 for the two of those if you wanted
[02:23:36] that and then for the other
[02:23:41] one it would be so if you want all of
[02:23:44] them together it would be$ five
[02:23:47] doll but I would have to do it because
[02:23:49] three of them when I do three it does
[02:23:51] have to go as like a pack thing so it
[02:23:53] would have to be a different type of
[02:23:54] shipping but that would be the only
[02:23:55] difference but I could put that in there
[02:23:57] for you as a uh if you would like three
[02:24:01] one and one pretty
[02:24:04] much but five for all of them if you'd
[02:24:08] like and I'm going to run the Au our get

[02:48:19] I guess I don't have
[02:48:22] it all right I guess I don't have it I
[02:48:24] thought I might have mixed it or
[02:48:26] something
[02:48:27] maybe but I guess I just don't have it
[02:48:30] and that means you're going to get a

[00:50:38] of the
[00:50:40] um I think we afterwards though we're
[00:50:42] going to open up what uh the bundle that
[00:50:46] my wife said we should
[00:50:47] open you're very welcome buddy very
[00:50:50] welcome my friend thank you for hanging
[00:50:53] out with us so those are our breaks that
[00:50:55] we have today those two different ones
[00:50:56] we we got those pinned for you so we
[00:50:58] have this uh secret layer Marvel and
[00:51:01] then we have the um the two other secret

[00:51:07] those so that'll be fun ones let's see
[00:51:09] what we get here will Nolan said this
[00:51:12] was some good luck so are we going to
[00:51:13] put out a nice eldrazi here that'd be
[00:51:17] nice a glimpse The
[00:51:20] Impossible unfadable truths bevent

[00:51:27] Goblin for boating landscape that Harold
[00:51:31] in we always like those little ones
[00:51:33] Reckless pyro Surfer suppression Ray
[00:51:36] shrieking Drake Nadu oh the the uh that
[00:51:41] nice little H ban card that doesn't
[00:51:43] really do anything anymore volatile
[00:51:45] stake in the volatile Drake in the foil
[00:51:47] not bad there and a mountain foil with
[00:51:50] your zombie token it's always nice when
[00:51:52] you pull out a ban card yes that was an
[00:51:55] awesome card before it was banned
[00:52:01] that's one of those things like like I
[00:52:02] feel like if they're going to make a
[00:52:03] card and it ends up getting banned it's
[00:52:06] like I feel like sometimes the cards
[00:52:09] that you have to decide which if it's
[00:52:10] the card that is needs to be banned or
[00:52:12] the cards that are like pumping it up
[00:52:14] because if there's a card pumping it up
[00:52:16] all the time or another card that pumps
[00:52:17] up different ones all the time every
[00:52:18] time these new ones get banned shouldn't
[00:52:20] it be the other one being
[00:52:23] banned your but hurts oh wow I'm sorry
[00:52:25] about that you might want to um maybe
[00:52:28] try to use some um try to use some type
[00:52:31] of uh uh cream to help with that my
[00:52:34] friend cuz those um those things can uh
[00:52:37] those can get bad over time especially
[00:52:40] uh if you don't take care of it right

[00:52:43] rashes and stuff NAD do needed it yeah
[00:52:45] yes Nadu was one of the ones that need
[00:52:48] it yeah so that's what I mean sometimes
[00:52:50] NAD do that's what I'm saying sometimes
[00:52:52] a lot of the times there other cars n do
[00:52:53] wasn't I that was one of the ones I was
[00:52:55] like yeah well I do figure that one out
[00:52:58] well the thing is too I'm waiting for
[00:52:59] other ones to come out like that
[00:53:04] too yeah now do was definitely I mean
[00:53:06] when I read the card I was like well
[00:53:08] that's

[00:53:29] we can see what are if you're going to
[00:53:31] come out with the uh the giveaway
[00:53:35] there all right and then I'm going to
[00:53:37] open up this foundations I think that's
[00:53:39] what I think we'll do see what we get
[00:53:40] with that because I know my wife said we
[00:53:42] had luck where she has some luck today
[00:53:44] so moner lay line of
[00:53:47] lightning I actually might have moner
[00:53:50] and lay line of
[00:53:55] lightning yeah yeah yeah proof they ask
[00:53:57] the play test group exactly all right
[00:53:59] well it looks like com comma commen is
[00:54:02] busy so I actually do believe I have
[00:54:05] moner so give me one second on that
[00:54:08] one or I used to have
[00:54:18] one no I don't have that anymore I do
[00:54:21] have a lay line of lightning somewhere I
[00:54:24] believe we check that one now the moner
[00:54:27] is in one of the secret layers by the
[00:54:29] way if you want one um and I do have
[00:54:32] those available the one that I think the
[00:54:34] one that's in I do have available let me
[00:54:36] check the lay line of lightning
[00:54:40] here I might have that one there's a lay
[00:54:42] line of lightning I do have
[00:54:44] that there you
[00:54:46] go and then the other one you were
[00:54:48] looking at was
[00:54:52] um reader
[00:54:54] Cleaver I don't know Cleaver so I'm not
[00:54:57] familiar with that one I don't remember
[00:54:59] that one so I will have to say no to
[00:55:01] that but um obviously as you see lay
[00:55:04] line right there all right I'm going to
[00:55:08] take these from the brakes here those
[00:55:11] are those braks that the kids have
[00:55:14] chosen slow that forward a little bit
[00:55:16] those are those brakes those kids have
[00:55:18] chosen we're going to put them there
[00:55:21] with that one off to the side there so
[00:55:23] we have it out of the way
[00:55:27] put that up there too so those are out
[00:55:29] of the way we'll go like this to put

[00:55:50] in my stuff
[00:55:57] no I have do not have Reaver
[00:56:00] Cleaver yeah I fig I was wondering if it
[00:56:03] was a typo for that type of thing but I
[00:56:05] wasn't sure all right there's your lay
[00:56:07] line of lightning I do have that though

[01:21:06] running those a little
[01:21:10] bit yeah it is it does think how they do
[01:21:13] that but the foil planes actually we can
[01:21:16] do that yeah I don't yeah it just think
[01:21:18] they took all those and put that stuff
[01:21:19] in there that is kind of
[01:21:21] frustrating I'll do that put that next
[01:21:23] to your uh the bunnies you're looking
[01:21:29] for and that's what you yeah you're
[01:21:31] going to get all well the thing is too
[01:21:33] that's for the people like there the
[01:21:34] people that say they complained they
[01:21:35] wanted to have just stuff to be able to
[01:21:36] play and not have to spend $100 or
[01:21:38] whatever and I understand what they were
[01:21:39] saying there so you know all right fine
[01:21:42] that's fine we'll put that over there
[01:21:44] there's your hair a couple hairs and
[01:21:47] there's the uh planes put that there for
[01:21:50] you and I'll take that banner and I
[01:21:52] understand kind of what they're saying
[01:21:53] so that's why they kind of did the play
[01:21:54] booster so you get like you get to have
[01:21:56] cards that you can play with but the
[01:21:58] thing is though with the way they they
[01:21:59] made them more expensive that's what the
[01:22:01] problem is they should have left them at
[01:22:03] like they shouldn't have gone up in
[01:22:04] price they shouldn't have got they
[01:22:05] should have Saed draft booster price if
[01:22:07] they did then it would have been
[01:22:08] okay you do keep getting good stuff with
[01:22:11] uh with in the collectors though see
[01:22:13] that's the thing though that they it so
[01:22:15] you if you're going to buy collectors
[01:22:16] you generally get better hits now and
[01:22:18] then you do and you get like not too
[01:22:20] much in the play boosters which is fine
[01:22:22] but I think they just need to drop the
[01:22:24] price of the play
[01:22:30] boosters yes I can do that I can
[01:22:33] definitely do that if it's not in the
[01:22:34] store I'll do that buddy DWI 's Elite

[01:23:04] bucks for a box that would be better
[01:23:07] then that would be that would make sense
[01:23:08] but the the the
[01:23:10] 150 or more box and stuff like that no I
[01:23:13] don't like that not

[01:44:53] too bad for that it was a decent box I
[01:44:56] mean it wasn't the best I definitely I
[01:44:58] definitely do like the older boxes when
[01:44:59] they um where we had a lot better
[01:45:02] uh lot
[01:45:04] better luck I feel with the older boxes
[01:45:07] that makes any sense I feel like we had
[01:45:09] a lot better luck on older
[01:45:12] boxes and this one here again you're
[01:45:14] running it is H the virtual one here it
[01:45:17] did H hold its value though they do
[01:45:26] oh not a problem Mr Bean yeah if you
[01:45:27] have any questions let me know so the
[01:45:29] way that I have this set up is that you
[01:45:31] can see it all um everything literally
[01:45:33] priced out so that way if anybody has
[01:45:35] any questions on it you don't have to
[01:45:36] you can literally see every single thing
[01:45:38] that's there so all the cards all the
[01:45:40] pricing and things like that so like
[01:45:41] right now you see it even pops up says
[01:45:43] your name on in the chat and what you
[01:45:45] what you got which was the which is the
[01:45:47] spot what your card is the temporary
[01:45:49] lock down and I think that's in this
[01:45:50] here
[01:45:56] Noe it is not it is it was put away
[01:46:00] alphabetically correct the other day
[01:46:02] then temporary lock
[01:46:08] down there you
[01:46:10] go temporary lockdown so Nico got that
[01:46:13] so there's a bunch of cards that are
[01:46:15] spread out in there so it's pretty much
[01:46:16] 100 cards that I had you go you try to
[01:46:19] get those and see whatever you can get
[01:46:20] out of them it's just pretty much
[01:46:21] randomizes it it's like a random Riz
[01:46:23] wheel in a

[02:23:08] this one for a few but yeah I mean I've
[02:23:09] had some I've had some intriguing things
[02:23:11] I don't do Pokemon I don't do um um
[02:23:14] Magic the Gathering sometimes we do
[02:23:15] sorcery um we do have some sorcery do
[02:23:18] every now and again cuz my my family and
[02:23:19] us have that but most times that yeah
[02:23:23] but having worked with all those
[02:23:25] different places over the years you
[02:23:27] learn some things some things I can't
[02:23:29] tell people but I'm like we need to do
[02:23:30] this and people like why are you doing
[02:23:31] that I'm like why you or how do you know
[02:23:33] this I'm like I'm telling you this is
[02:23:34] what's going to happen and it doesn't
[02:23:36] happen right away it might take two or
[02:23:37] three years that ends up happening and
[02:23:39] my wife or friends look at me like how
[02:23:40] the [ __ ] did you know that I'm like I
[02:23:42] told you I work for [ __ ] that you don't
[02:23:44] know about and I can't tell you the [ __ ]
[02:23:45] that I
[02:23:47] did oh nice counter spell
[02:23:54] like I even had a few interesting
[02:23:56] interviews that I'm scared of talking
[02:23:58] about they didn't tell me I couldn't
[02:24:00] tell about the interviews but I'm
[02:24:01] [ __ ] dead scared about telling about
[02:24:02] those after I after some of the [ __ ]
[02:24:04] that I figured out
[02:24:07] too my I'll tell my wife about the
[02:24:09] interviews at some
[02:24:10] point when we're on the boat and no one
[02:24:12] can hear me but I am not telling that
[02:24:15] here cuz those were
[02:24:17] [ __ ] those are weird
[02:24:21] those are
[02:24:22] weird like extremely weird I didn't
[02:24:26] understand it then took me a little
[02:24:28] while to figure some of it out like whoa
[02:24:32] boy that's why I've been saying you like
[02:24:34] if they can if anybody ever does
[02:24:35] anything where they can 100% Pro
[02:24:37] guarantee the safety of like people
[02:24:39] that'll tell stuff about things going on
[02:24:41] in the world I don't mind doing that but
[02:24:42] I can't guarantee if no one that's never
[02:24:44] going to happen since that's never going
[02:24:46] to happen all that will stay in my head
[02:24:48] until I die and then maybe there'll be a
[02:24:49] book or something that comes out who
[02:24:51] knows but yeah I got to keep my family
[02:24:54] safe exactly ears everywhere exactly
[02:24:56] never alone 100% on that one there you
[02:24:59] go
[02:25:00] Nico D I mean that was in 2012 they had
[02:25:03] me putting they wanted me to put that
[02:25:05] stuff in in cities
[02:25:08] 2012 that's insane they had it all the
[02:25:11] way back then that they were doing that
[02:25:13] and you people like oh they can't do
[02:25:14] that and like oh and then they started
[02:25:15] doing it now recently oh look what
[02:25:16] they're doing all of a sudden like
[02:25:18] that's not all of a sudden
[02:25:22] no all of a sudden
[02:25:25] no then then when you work for the banks
[02:25:27] and and you see all the money they spend
[02:25:29] and you're like oh like I I I actually
[02:25:31] wasn't allowed to I can actually start
[02:25:33] getting into the stock market again I
[02:25:35] think next year because I had to stay
[02:25:38] out of it for like two years before I
[02:25:40] could jump back in because of the
[02:25:41] company I worked
[02:25:42] for like because I literally know
[02:25:45] everything banks do like all of them one
[02:25:50] all right Andrews 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1

[02:26:03] can my friend but yeah yeah
[02:26:07] yep I've uh yeah I know I've had some
[02:26:09] intriguing things occur and um when I
[02:26:12] start telling people like hey pay
[02:26:14] attention to this do this do that do the
[02:26:15] other thing and they're like no I don't
[02:26:16] know we're okay and then later on my
[02:26:18] friends gave me a call like dude how did
[02:26:21] you know that like I told you I did some
[02:26:24] interesting things before and I ke I
[02:26:26] left those positions I wasn't forced out
[02:26:28] of them I left them I left them for a
[02:26:30] [ __ ] reason I don't like what they
[02:26:32] were

[02:27:23] nice pack
[02:27:25] there if you got voice controling your
[02:27:28] TV it's hooked up to Wi-Fi oh yeah
[02:27:29] everything is oh yeah I know that even
[02:27:31] your phone is why do you think they pick
[02:27:33] up your um why do you think your phones
[02:27:35] pick up ads and everything for you every
[02:27:37] single thing is connected so the only
[02:27:40] thing in this world that you can do I'm
[02:27:42] going to tell you all right now when you
[02:27:43] unless you are literally sitting in the
[02:27:44] middle of the woods with zero
[02:27:46] Electronics on you you cannot talk about
[02:27:49] anything that you don't want the world
[02:27:51] to know about cuz everything you say now
[02:27:53] is heard by everyone someone on the
[02:27:56] planet
[02:27:57] somewhere now it could be the computer
[02:27:59] hears it then tell somebody that this
[02:28:01] person said it it could be that uh that
[02:28:04] actually people are listening in cuz you
[02:28:06] said something and they want to hear
[02:28:08] what you're saying now I guarantee you
[02:28:10] 100% that is going
[02:28:14] on like to a degree that you're scared
[02:28:17] you'd be you'd be worried about I like
[02:28:19] that f Saran that's a nice pick up
[02:28:23] there
[02:28:25] m yeah yeah kind yeah yeah yeah well you
[02:28:29] yeah pretty much some like movies are
[02:28:32] not as far off as you would
[02:28:35] think movies are not as far off as you
[02:28:37] would think at least some of the ones
[02:28:40] that have been out uh recently will say
[02:28:42] maybe some of the older ones might like
[02:28:44] some of the older ones I uh like not old
[02:28:46] old but like older as in like when I was
[02:28:48] a kid type
[02:28:56] not bad all right and then our raw Hulk
[02:28:59] we'll put those over here yeah but yeah
[02:29:00] they're crazy there's some [ __ ] that
[02:29:01] they do without like yeah that's part of
[02:29:04] the reason why I wanted to be on a boat
[02:29:05] I told my wife like for for a while I
[02:29:06] got um for about probably 10 years I've
[02:29:09] been pushing it harder and harder
[02:29:10] because some of a few of the things I
[02:29:11] learned when I working with stuff I'm
[02:29:13] like we need to get on the boat we
[02:29:14] should do this we need to get fully set
[02:29:15] up we need to be
[02:29:16] self-sufficient um we should have zero
[02:29:18] debt of any kind and and we should uh be
[02:29:22] able to pretty much survive for a month
[02:29:24] or two without having to worry about
[02:29:27] anything oh
[02:29:29] ET ET
[02:29:33] yeah yeah that was a good one that they
[02:29:35] have some more knowledge in that than
[02:29:37] you'd
[02:29:38] expect I know I like when you different
[02:29:41] movies you yeah some movies are are
[02:29:42] pretty straight on when that things
[02:29:44] happen let me grab my drink here I'll be
[02:29:45] right back I don't where to put that
[02:29:50] I put my
[02:29:53] drink over
[02:29:57] here yeah I mean I've had um just having
[02:29:59] the stuff that I've done I learned I
[02:30:02] learned that you just need to be um
[02:30:05] extremely careful with everything you do
[02:30:07] because everything is
[02:30:10] known which is why when somebody says
[02:30:12] something happened and no one saw it I'm
[02:30:13] like [ __ ]
[02:30:20] would you do five on a second authority
[02:30:23] of console um let me see if I have the
[02:30:26] other one
[02:30:31] there thought I had some more but let me
[02:30:34] check I got one
[02:30:36] more here but that is the not that one
[02:30:41] let me that is not the same one that is
[02:30:43] a list brand one the list one so it's a
[02:30:45] little bit of a it's a different price
[02:30:46] on that let me see if I have a different
[02:30:48] Authority console here though if I
[02:30:50] pulled out another
[02:30:53] one I don't think I did though NOP I
[02:30:57] think that's the only other authority
[02:30:58] Council that I have which is a list card
[02:31:00] so a little bit different in price but
[02:31:02] give me a sec to see if I pulled
[02:31:04] anything else out here that I happen to
[02:31:06] get
[02:31:14] recently cuz sometimes I have them just
[02:31:17] like I said I haven't had all of them
[02:31:18] like the last couple days haven't been
[02:31:21] organized but no that's the only one I
[02:31:23] have there which is a list one um let me
[02:31:26] see what one that like I can tell you
[02:31:27] that one's a little bit different on
[02:31:28] price though that's why so just give me
[02:31:30] one
[02:31:32] second if I have one that's uh why does
[02:31:36] that never come up
[02:31:50] all right this is the list
[02:31:52] reprint yeah five bucks for it we'll do
[02:31:55] five bucks for it it dropped a little
[02:31:57] bit since the other one came out that
[02:31:58] used to be like nine or 10 so yeah $5 it
[02:32:01] is I'll throw that out there for you
[02:32:04] now all right add
[02:32:09] it five there start
[02:32:13] start start there you go my friend $5
[02:32:20] for that one
[02:32:22] Luke put you with your other stuff that
[02:32:24] you picked up
[02:32:27] here I thought that one was a different
[02:32:29] it was uh they must just adjusted the
[02:32:31] pricing once all the others came out so
[02:32:33] there you
[02:32:34] go Luke there you are my friend
[02:32:37] Authority consult but yeah you like I
[02:32:39] said I've learned some interesting
[02:32:41] things my favorite one was when I worked
[02:32:43] with some of the companies that I worked
[02:32:44] with like um I worked with like I
[02:32:48] actually got to work with like JPL that

[02:33:12] pack we had some decent luck so far but
[02:33:15] no one actually grabbed one of these out
[02:33:17] I know it's not magic but he grabbed a
[02:33:18] sorcery pack saying that we should open
[02:33:20] this one so let's see what happens here
[02:33:22] are we going to get a CUO oh my God that
[02:33:26] would be

[02:34:24] one he said we were going to get some
[02:34:27] luck and not the best on that
[02:34:31] one
[02:34:34] NOP none of those all right well hey it

[02:37:45] 80 and then 100 for the foil I don't
[02:37:46] know if I have any of the foils left cuz
[02:37:48] I think the last foil that have is only
[02:37:50] one of them and we were going to hold on
[02:37:51] to it for the family
[02:37:53] here yeah I only have one of the foils

[02:38:04] have two more of the nonf foils if

[03:14:54] assault rifle gives you a plus three
[03:14:57] when you roll all right gives you a plus

[03:15:15] Zoom all the way out we're GNA do this
[03:15:17] and we're GNA see what we get here for
[03:15:20] you oh well look at that 19 that worked
[03:15:24] out well for you so you nicely take some
[03:15:28] shots with your assault
[03:15:30] rifle now large
[03:15:32] Raider nice one buddy that was a good Pi
[03:15:35] good hit there now large Raiders Jess
[03:15:38] see where
[03:15:42] are
[03:15:44] um 35 on their health no they're 40 on
[03:15:47] their health why did it why did it put
[03:15:49] 35 on the large R that's a medium one
[03:15:51] you though shoot them and when that shot
[03:15:55] let's see what it hits o nice brings him
[03:15:57] down to uh 22 that's a good shot nice
[03:16:01] big hit for that one there now he's mad
[03:16:03] at you he goes running towards you
[03:16:04] though you only have 100 Health he goes
[03:16:07] running towards you and oh he does swing
[03:16:09] down toward you you get 15 and you show
[03:16:11] three at a time so you get five shots
[03:16:15] all right you go you get three shots at
[03:16:17] a time which is why it went down to 22
[03:16:19] you hit him pretty good you got pretty
[03:16:20] close with that 19 so that's why you get
[03:16:22] all the shots hitting him and then with
[03:16:24] this here you go he goes and swings at
[03:16:26] you with his axe that Mighty large axe
[03:16:29] swings down but he hits you he is mad
[03:16:32] but it doesn't have a lot of strength
[03:16:33] cuz he was hit and he brings you from
[03:16:35] 100 down to
[03:16:36] 92 all right buddy now you have a choice
[03:16:39] what do you want to do now with this uh
[03:16:42] this adventure to see what happens do
[03:16:44] you want to shoot again
[03:16:46] or not I know he was lucky on that one
[03:16:48] it was just he hit him twice he got the
[03:16:50] nice big hit with the with 19 there yes
[03:16:52] sir we're going again we roll again and
[03:16:56] ooh it's 16 this time but you have a
[03:16:58] plus three because of your weapon and
[03:17:01] you hit him again because he's plus 17
[03:17:04] he's a 17 only so you get that 17 hit
[03:17:07] nice one let's do that again here too
[03:17:10] let's see what happens randomize that
[03:17:13] and oh brings you ah you missed with one
[03:17:15] of those it looks like you must have
[03:17:16] missed because it only brings him down
[03:17:19] to uh 11 here so it doesn't bring him
[03:17:21] down as much as last time but he's uh
[03:17:24] he's wobbling now and he swings his axe
[03:17:25] at you again bring you down to oh he get
[03:17:28] actually a pretty good hit on you he
[03:17:29] brings you down to 81 same type of hit
[03:17:31] on you too you're at 81 Health right now
[03:17:34] and you only have three more of your
[03:17:37] shots left you want to take another
[03:17:40] one we are doing the adventure game
[03:17:43] going against our large Raider here
[03:17:45] Dalton's fighting a large Raider in our
[03:17:46] in our D and D style little game we got
[03:17:48] here might as well try and kill him
[03:17:50] we're going to do it we roll oh no it's
[03:17:54] a four you missed this time that was a
[03:17:58] plain that was a really bad Miss oof oof
[03:18:01] you miss and he swings at you though and
[03:18:04] he hits you but he knocks you not too
[03:18:07] much cuz he because he's still scared he
[03:18:08] hits you only down to
[03:18:13] 70 where's that math there oh not bad
[03:18:16] only brings you down to 73 so it wasn't
[03:18:19] a bad hit
[03:18:20] there but you don't know what now you
[03:18:22] have a choice because he's almost dead
[03:18:26] all right you're either going to get a
[03:18:28] kill shot and win or he's going to hit
[03:18:31] you and knock you out and loot you and
[03:18:32] take your stuff or you can run away
[03:18:35] right now and keep all of your stuff
[03:18:37] that you have because he's so injured he
[03:18:39] can't really chase after you so you have
[03:18:42] a couple you have some choices on what
[03:18:43] you want to do there let me know what
[03:18:45] you want to do and see how we go about
[03:18:47] with this you're going to go after it
[03:18:49] 50/50 we're going to roll all right so
[03:18:53] you have to get a
[03:18:56] um 14 or
[03:18:58] higher let's do
[03:19:00] it oh
[03:19:03] no you got a one I'm sorry buddy that
[03:19:08] was not good you
[03:19:10] shoot now you only have one thing of
[03:19:12] shots left but you miss so wildly when
[03:19:16] you're shooting at at
[03:19:17] him and he comes charging towards you
[03:19:20] and swings one more time with his large
[03:19:22] ax at you at that doorway but as he
[03:19:26] swings he hits you and he knocks you
[03:19:28] down you go from 73 Health down to 60
[03:19:32] health and when he knocks you down you
[03:19:34] hit that door and you are out cold my
[03:19:36] friend you're out cold now you wake up
[03:19:41] when you do wake up you notice that all
[03:19:44] of your ammo is gone and your weapon you
[03:19:47] still have your weapon because he didn't
[03:19:49] take that but he did leave all he took
[03:19:51] all your ammo you have nothing left for
[03:19:53] that so you're going have to decide what
[03:19:55] you want to do now in the future here I
[03:19:58] know but you are at 60 Health at the
[03:20:00] moment you lucky woke up he didn't kill
[03:20:03] you he was lucky enough that he didn't
[03:20:04] kill you but at least he only took your
[03:20:06] ammo not too bad he was injured he
[03:20:08] couldn't carry a lot of stuff so lucky
[03:20:11] for you he did not take the whole whole
[03:20:13] gun
[03:20:16] there you go I don't know what do you
[03:20:18] think Dalton yeah yeah not too bad it

[03:20:29] bit bad luck at the end there I'm sorry

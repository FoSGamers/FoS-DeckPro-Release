[00:24:39] here oh that you know what Super Dan I
[00:24:42] have I actually hadn't played in years
[00:24:44] and I started play again largely like
[00:24:46] big when I when Lord of the Rings came
[00:24:48] back just because I'm a huge Lord of the
[00:24:50] Rings fan I read the book when I was 11
[00:24:53] and I you know watched all the movies
[00:24:55] multiple times blah blah blah BL blah
[00:24:57] you know thate type of thing so when it
[00:24:58] came out I was like you know what I've
[00:24:59] been playing Magic kind of off and on
[00:25:01] grabbing cards I'm going to jump in a
[00:25:02] little bit and I jumped in hard and
[00:25:04] because it was wicked fun and then I
[00:25:06] just started playing the other ones too
[00:25:07] and it became Wicked like with the L
[00:25:09] lost Caverns to coming out with the
[00:25:11] dinos that was awesome I'm guessing you
[00:25:13] want me to go random Raven but or maybe
[00:25:16] I mean you're typing out where you want
[00:25:17] me to go rather than random that's why
[00:25:18] it's taking so long so I'm gonna give it
[00:25:20] a minute here what
[00:25:23] um hey that one ring dude uh that was a
[00:25:26] chase that everybody was after and you

[00:34:59] think I got think I need to adjust my
[00:35:01] camera
[00:35:02] here think I'm a little
[00:35:05] high I don't know the angle might be a
[00:35:07] little high I don't know all right so
[00:35:10] here's how bad my luck is growing up I
[00:35:13] was in Boy Scout well Cub Scouts I never
[00:35:15] even I I got the Boy Scouts and I pretty
[00:35:18] much left instantly because I was tired
[00:35:20] of all the bad luck and I had crappy
[00:35:22] like com out leaders so I was in Boy
[00:35:25] Scouts
[00:35:28] all right I can check out what some of
[00:35:30] those
[00:35:31] are and
[00:35:35] um my
[00:35:41] um so uh my luck is that I grow up and
[00:35:46] my children my I mean my at um at um
[00:35:49] sorry my children all get my luck so my
[00:35:51] luck example is I grow up grown up as
[00:35:53] Cub Scouts uh for nine years I was in
[00:35:55] Cub Scouts into Boy Scouts and what I
[00:35:57] was doing while I was there one of the
[00:35:58] things we had this Christmas party and
[00:36:00] you would have every year you would have
[00:36:01] a raffle the kids would all get a
[00:36:03] Christmas party because all the parents
[00:36:04] were dropped something off well every
[00:36:06] single year I was the last one pulled
[00:36:09] every single year I got white
[00:36:14] chock like seriously come
[00:36:20] on my wife is the same way we both
[00:36:23] bought random box at Walmart for $20
[00:36:25] each she walked away with $80 in profit
[00:36:26] and I got yeah yeah that sounds about
[00:36:28] right I used to give a pack one pack of
[00:36:30] my girlfri a collector's box I get she'd
[00:36:31] get every single time the card that you
[00:36:34] would want H C that P paid the whole box
[00:36:39] back I had to
[00:36:41] stop you need to find a girlfriend to
[00:36:43] open
[00:36:44] packs you know what it's a girlfriend or
[00:36:46] a kid I guess and that's what it is you
[00:36:48] need to get a girlfriend or a kid to
[00:36:49] open some packs for
[00:36:53] you let's do this here for a random pack

[01:08:08] on those uh Exelon though hey you know
[01:08:11] what let me throw in one extra because I
[01:08:13] didn't like you getting all kind of low
[01:08:15] cards on that Exelon let's try one extra
[01:08:18] and see if you can get any other luck
[01:08:19] what do you say you want me to tell me
[01:08:20] somewhere else to go or should I do a
[01:08:21] random for you
[01:08:26] all right let's do that it's my box I
[01:08:29] get to do things like
[01:08:32] this when I when I see some of the cards
[01:08:35] and I'm like sometimes like you know
[01:08:36] what I didn't like those three I think
[01:08:37] somebody should get a better opportunity
[01:08:38] for at least one more all right let's do
[01:08:41] I'm going to do a random I'm G kind of
[01:08:42] let do the kids do let's see if I feel
[01:08:44] for anything the Heat or the
[01:08:47] tingle something something around here
[01:08:49] maybe something around here maybe I
[01:08:51] don't know if this right I don't know if
[01:08:52] this right but we're going to see
[01:08:58] we got a twist and turns oh not bad
[01:09:01] twist and turns foil that's a good
[01:09:03] little card there an enchantment there
[01:09:05] yeah the flowering of the white tree
[01:09:06] definitely legendary creatures you
[01:09:09] control get plus two plus one and have W
[01:09:11] one non Legend creatures you control get
[01:09:13] plus one plus one that is definitely a
[01:09:15] broken card for two that's an awesome
[01:09:17] card though for two hey Lucid may not
[01:09:21] have been the best one but we tried
[01:09:22] again for an extra there but you got
[01:09:24] yourself a nice Lucid that nice one
[01:09:26] there out of for that flowering the
[01:09:28] white tree you know what here let's do
[01:09:32] this if you like the Lord of the Rings
[01:09:34] and The Exelon let's do this here let's
[01:09:36] do a deal for some L of the Rings and
[01:09:38] some Exelon pull
[01:09:39] BLX let me see if I can do this here
[01:09:49] think we got this here you know what
[01:09:51] let's do this I'm going to do a pull box
[01:09:54] mix and match deal we're going to say
[01:09:56] six
[01:09:57] Exelon and six Lord of the Rings and
[01:10:01] instead of it being 14 we're going to
[01:10:03] put that on for 12 if you want to try
[01:10:06] your luck and see that you get six Lord
[01:10:08] of the Rings and six Exon for 12 if you
[01:10:10] want to try your
[01:10:11] luck no problem Lucid you know I try
[01:10:14] every now and again I can't guarantee
[01:10:16] that you're GNA get something but it's
[01:10:17] one of those things where it's like it's
[01:10:18] my box I build this stuff so I in a way
[01:10:22] know it's in there uh I know what the
[01:10:24] chances are so if somebody just I have
[01:10:26] bad luck myself so if sometimes somebody
[01:10:29] gets bad luck on something I like to
[01:10:30] give them an extra opportunity because
[01:10:32] growing up having bad luck it sucked so
[01:10:35] I try to give everybody a little extra
[01:10:36] you know I can't guarantee the extra is
[01:10:38] going to get anything but you know
[01:10:41] sometimes it does that's also why I do
[01:10:43] when uh when you get duplicates if you
[01:10:45] get duplicates of a card I let you trade
[01:10:47] out the duplicate and try another one
[01:10:49] for the reason of that that to me seems
[01:10:51] like it's a bad luck card you get to
[01:10:52] trade it out
[01:10:55] hey Venom's GNA try your luck I like it
[01:10:59] Venom where do we want to go here

[01:31:40] um that was a uh like one of those
[01:31:43] chairs that was like a gaming chair but
[01:31:44] it could lean back flat um so if you
[01:31:47] wanted to lay down in your chair you
[01:31:50] could lay down in your chair
[01:31:52] well um I guess when I when at
[01:31:56] Thanksgiving I forgot to flick the
[01:31:57] switch when we moved it out to not allow
[01:31:59] it to lay down so when my father-in-law
[01:32:02] sat in the chair he goes to lay back and
[01:32:04] he [ __ ] went all the way flat almost
[01:32:06] went to the ground he thought he was
[01:32:08] gonna die you could see his face go from
[01:32:10] oh my God his face was like oh we're

[01:47:51] pack deal out
[01:47:53] here let's do this because I'm going to
[01:47:56] be heading out

[01:48:01] minutes let's see if anybody wants to do
[01:48:03] this
[01:48:05] [Music]

[01:48:17] this for 31 if somebody wants to try it

[01:48:31] in two
[01:48:35] sets yeah my Channel's been getting a
[01:48:37] little bit more traction uh like I've
[01:48:39] been a few thousand views on some of
[01:48:40] these shorts I just hope that I would
[01:48:42] hope that some of the people slowly
[01:48:43] start rolling in and doing watching some
[01:48:45] of the little bit like you know 10 15
[01:48:46] minute videos of the Pack openings and
[01:48:48] the box openings that we have that would
[01:48:50] be pretty fun if we get some people
[01:48:51] watching those and um commenting on them
[01:48:53] because they I know the boys love it
[01:48:55] when they get the comments and stuff
[01:48:56] like that it's one of those that's why
[01:48:58] we did it they like having it and they
[01:48:59] like to be
[01:49:02] participating that's the main reason was
[01:49:04] so that we could do the long videos but
[01:49:05] the short ones help us it seems I don't
[01:49:07] know I've never done anything like that
[01:49:08] so it's new to me oh that was a really
[01:49:11] good deal

I need you to help build the perks and the levels between 2 to 4, and the cost and the price for each level for my YouTube member subscriptions, now that I am monetized and a member with them. I am now associated with them, so I can do stuff through there. I haven't gotten to the point where I can get ad advertisements yet, but we're going to get up there shortly, and I need your help to get there with having our members have some awesome things and what the good prices are and everything that we kind of do here on a regular basis. Let me know what we can build and what the perks should be and the prices I should do. Use your knowledge, use the Internet, and use everything you know about me based on everything I provided you, especially the document that is the Bible of FOS Gamers.

[2024-10-04 19:12:49] FoSGamers:
Now, I don't really have apparel other than my, um... other than my custom-made, um... dry-erase tokens that I have. I don't have anything like that yet, so to do the exclusive deals. Now, maybe a discount on the products that I'm selling, like a discount code or something like that, that you can use a certain time of month, like once a month or certain times in a month, for each, uh, for the level type thing. Um... I think that's, uh, what I think you need to address and see if you need to do that for any other tiers. Like, if they're in another tier, they get a, you know, they get a different discount. So, like, would they get a discount on some of the products? Say, like, uh, you know, in one of the tiers, it's 5%, and the next, in the highest tier, it's 10% once type thing, or whatever, whatever you think would work based on my business plan and what I'd use. Make sure you're thoroughly understanding my business plan and everything correctly.

[2024-10-04 19:13:11] ChatGPT:
Considering your current product offerings, such as your **custom dry-erase tokens**, and aligning with your **business plan** from the *FoSGamers Business Bible*, it's smart to integrate **tier-based discounts** into your YouTube membership tiers. These discounts can incentivize members to purchase your products while offering value that scales across different membership levels. Here's an optimized structure for integrating discount codes into your membership levels:

### Updated YouTube Membership Tiers with Discount Strategy:

---

#### **Tier 1: Supporter**
- **Price:** $2.99 per month
- **Perks:**
  1. **Loyalty Badges** and **Custom Emojis**.
  2. **Early Access to Videos**.
  3. **Members-Only Live Chats**.
  4. **Monthly Discount Code (5%)**: Members get a 5% discount code on any *custom dry-erase tokens* or other merchandise, usable once a month. This encourages small but regular engagement with your product offerings, allowing supporters to feel included without a big financial commitment.

---

#### **Tier 2: Gamer**
- **Price:** $4.99 per month
- **Perks:**
  1. **All Perks from Tier 1.**
  2. **Members-Only Polls** and **Live Streams**.
  3. **Discord Access**.
  4. **Monthly Discount Code (7%)**: Members receive a 7% discount on your products, encouraging them to move from *Supporter* to this tier for added value. This discount could be offered twice a month or be capped at a specific limit to drive more purchases without overwhelming your product supply.

---

#### **Tier 3: Legendary Explorer**
- **Price:** $9.99 per month
- **Perks:**
  1. **All Perks from Tier 2.**
  2. **Behind-the-Scenes Content** and **Exclusive Monthly Videos**.
  3. **Monthly Discount Code (10%)**: Members at this level get a 10% discount on all products, usable once a month. This tier targets your more dedicated followers, who may be more willing to invest in your products. You can also add limited-edition versions of your tokens or offer early access to new products to incentivize members to remain at this tier.

---

#### **Tier 4: Champion**
- **Price:** $19.99 per month
- **Perks:**
  1. **All Perks from Tier 3.**
  2. **Personalized Shout-Outs** and **VIP Access to Special Events**.
  3. **Monthly Discount Code (15%)**: Offer the highest discount here—15% off any product once per month. This tier should be reserved for your most loyal members, where they feel highly valued and can access your premium products or limited-time offers.

---

### **Key Strategies for Discount Integration:**
1. **Frequency and Exclusivity**: Make the discount codes usable **once per month** to maintain exclusivity, and specify a limit on the total discount value per purchase, if needed. This prevents overuse while ensuring members feel rewarded for their loyalty.
2. **Different Discount Levels**: Offer scaling discounts (5%, 7%, 10%, 15%) across tiers, ensuring higher-tier members get more value. This motivates members to upgrade their membership to unlock better discounts【16†source】【19†source】.
3. **Limited Edition Offerings**: For the higher tiers, consider offering **early access** to new product launches or **limited-edition versions** of your dry-erase tokens. This ties into the strategy of adding extra value for higher-paying members【17†source】【18†source】.

By using this approach, you'll be able to effectively engage your YouTube members, driving both **membership growth** and **product sales**. Let me know if you'd like to explore additional perks or refine this structure further!

[2024-10-04 19:14:26] FoSGamers:
Um, search the internet, thoroughly understand this, um, I don't have a large, um, amount of money I make on things, so I need you to realize, figure out if 15% is good enough for me or not, because I may be only making 10% on a product or 20% on a product, at the most 30%, generally it's only 10 to 20.

[2024-10-04 19:14:48] ChatGPT:
Given that your profit margins are generally between 10% to 20%, offering a 15% discount could potentially cut into your profits too much, especially if you're operating at a low margin. Here’s a better approach, considering your business model and YouTube’s 30% revenue cut on memberships:

### Adjusted Discount Strategy:
- **Tier 1 (Supporter, $2.99)**: Offer **5% discount**, which is a manageable benefit even if your margins are on the lower side. This provides a modest incentive without eating into your profits too much.
- **Tier 2 (Gamer, $4.99)**: A **7% discount** will encourage more serious members to upgrade without drastically affecting your margins. This fits well with your 10%-20% margin.
- **Tier 3 (Legendary Explorer, $9.99)**: A **10% discount** is ideal here. This is a common discount across various businesses for loyal customers and still leaves room for profit.
- **Tier 4 (Champion, $19.99)**: Instead of a flat 15%, offer **exclusive deals or bundles** at **10%-12% off** once a month. This will allow you to protect your profit margins while still providing significant value for your most dedicated supporters.

### Why These Changes?
1. **YouTube’s 30% Cut**: Since YouTube takes 30% of your membership fees, offering a high discount (like 15%) could reduce the profitability of these sales too much. Keeping the discount lower ensures that your business remains sustainable【27】【30】.
2. **Lower Margins**: With a typical margin of 10-20%, a 15% discount would leave you little to no profit. These adjusted percentages will help balance offering value to your members while maintaining profitability.
3. **Incentive without Overextension**: By capping the discount at 10-12% for the highest tier, you provide a great benefit without overextending yourself financially, especially with your custom tokens and similar products【29】.

This structure keeps the discounts sustainable while still being attractive enough to drive sales and memberships. Let me know if you’d like to adjust any other details!

[2024-10-04 19:17:42] FoSGamers:
Since I do breaks, should it have something to do with a break for some of these things? So like, you know, for instance, we'll say Tier 1, like say the discount has to do with say 5% off your purchase, but it has to be, you know, like a three packs or more type thing, and then do that similarly kind of for the other ones, and then up to where the Tier 4 will be able to do it on a break, where the others won't be able to do it on a break necessarily, only Tier 4 will be able to ever get discounts on breaks. You know what, Tier 3 can, but let's have the discount on breaks be half of what a discount on a break for Tier 4 will be, and the other tiers don't get any on that. And then they still get exclusive deals on bundles. I like that idea too. So like they get a better deal, so like say if they give it 10% off a break, no one ever gets discounts on breaks is really what it's going to be. They'll get 10% off a break, one break a month, they'll at the high 5% off for Tier 3, and then they'll still get the exclusive offers and bundles and stuff like that once a month at least. So, you know, because sometimes I might want to get rid of something, and I'll throw them an exclusive offer on something so I can break it open live on screen type stuff, because that'll be a lot of times that I'll use this as to generate more stuff that I can generate opening things on screen.

[2024-10-04 19:18:22] ChatGPT:
Incorporating discounts specifically related to **breaks** can be a great way to structure your YouTube memberships, especially since your audience enjoys live content and interactive events.

[2024-10-04 19:19:39] FoSGamers:
No, they only get it off of one break a month. They don't get it off of one or more break a month. And, um... The 10% thing is fine, yeah. Exclusive deals on bundles is okay. You should also include the stuff about, like, you know, like you had in there before, about, like, uh, how... the other stuff that you had in there, not just only about me selling stuff. It has to be all the stuff that I do. So you have to incorporate all the stuff that I do. Don't be lazy here.

Discounts only apply for things being broken live on air. If they... The only people that have the discount and don't have to have it live, broken on air, would be a champion. And they can only use... 10% and they'll never get 15% off. Don't ever give them 15% off. It's just the 10% on the breaks. And they get special, exclusive bundles. That would be for them. And... Other stuff that I do, like, you know, events or shoutouts or maybe even a game. I like to play with us. One, they get to play with me. One, there was one of those ones that was in there somewhere. Like, I like those. And, you know, like, help build things. The polls to build stuff and how they want to run things or what we should be opening next. I like to have the community aspect of things. So thoroughly read everything in this chat. I don't want you to necessarily remove anything. I just want you to find the best ones for my business. And for me to be able to use to grow it for people that want to be community and hang out and stay there. Because the more people that stay there, the more people that watch, and the more video hours I have, and the more ad revenue I'll end up getting.

One of the things that I do here is I do kind of like D&D games. Um, you can just, I don't know if they don't need to know them. I make it up myself, but I didn't know it was a D&D type game until somebody told me I was like a dungeon master or a game master with the games that I had been making up. Um, like I literally didn't really know what they were. I just made them up and went with it. And then someone's like, dude, you're this. And I went to know more. I'm like, oh, wow, look at that. I am. And so, um, you know, I make a lot of those up and play games. So I would say like, uh, the highest tier, maybe we'll get, um, get to play a game for a certain amount of time each month. So like, they'll get, like, I don't have to pay. Like, if people buy packs to play the game right now, or they have to buy in to play any of the games in some way, shape, or form by purchasing something. Well, if they're a certain level members, um, they get a certain amount of time. They get to play each month. Um, that the, the, you know, that I won't have to, they won't have to pay for or buy anything with. We'll say each month we'll call it, um, I don't know, the highest would be, well, I don't know, maybe two hours a month, just because I have multiple streams. I have streams almost every single day. So we could, uh, the highest would be, I'd say two hours a month up. And then it depends on how many people we end up having. If I have too many people, then I won't ever be able to do that. So, I mean, that's why you have to figure out like the monetary value of the levels that should be at. But like $20, maybe it won't be $2, two hours a month. Um, like should, because it's like kind of like a personalized game. Um, well, our personal game was on Monday, which would be more of a, um, I don't know, maybe an hour a month. That way that they have a little bit of time and then they have access. Each, um, each one have different level accesses to purchasing, um, extra hours to play with us, um, at their levels. That way I can, um, if they want to continue to play for a certain period of time, but they don't want to buy packs, they can just play the game too. I don't care if they're playing the game and that draws more entertainment and people in. That's perfectly fine with me as long as I'm getting views and, and money in some way, shape or form here. So that's, there's all the adventure games that I build. If they want to play them, let's do it. We'll play them all day long with people. And if that's going to generate me income, I don't fucking care at all. Now, my point is though, like we have to figure out like a level of that. So search the internet, thoroughly understand like what I do and those types of things and have that kind of built in also to all the perks here and, and the, um, and the membership levels. Also learn how much is taken by Google so that I know how much I'm actually making on each one and calculate it based on my subscribers that I have now and the average amount of people that end up being members that are subscribers of yours.

I think from now on I should have maybe added into the business plan that I will do personalized assassins if people want to pay for them or pay for me to be their dungeon master. I can do personalized games a little bit based on some of their stuff even too.

Including personalized services such as **assassins for hire** or **Dungeon Master sessions** in your business plan could be a great way to diversify your offerings and generate additional revenue. These customized games align perfectly with your existing brand of interactive, community-driven content and can cater to your most dedicated fans who want a more personalized experience.

### How You Can Incorporate Personalized Games:
1. **Personalized Assassin Services**:
   - This can be a fun, immersive feature in which you create tailored game scenarios where you're an "assassin" targeting a member in a custom game world. Members could pay for these unique game experiences, which could tie into your existing adventure-themed content like *Wasteland Odyssey*.
   - The concept could also expand to virtual or live events where players must "survive" an encounter with your character in a custom-built scenario.

2. **Dungeon Master for Hire**:
   - Offering your services as a **personalized Dungeon Master** could be another excellent revenue stream. You can host private D&D-style games, tailoring the experience to your clients’ preferences.

- **Dungeon Master Sessions**: 
   - Offer hourly packages, starting at around **$50 to $100 per hour** depending on the complexity of the game and the custom requests.
   - Provide higher-tiered bundles, where for a set price (e.g., **$300 for 6 hours over a month**), players can engage in multi-session campaigns. This could encourage recurring gameplay and even small-group DM sessions.

### Integration into Your Business Plan:
- **Membership Tiers**: You could offer limited free game sessions for your highest-tier members and then upsell these personalized assassin or DM services. For instance, Tier 4 members could get **10% off personalized Dungeon Master services** as part of their membership.
  
- **Exclusive Offers**: Use **live streams** and **Discord channels** to advertise special offers for personalized assassin games or Dungeon Master sessions. These could be promoted during community polls or special events.

### Additional Benefits:

Whenever anything of the free virtual sessions, they're always going to be live-streamed and almost every single time we're doing one, it will be live-streamed unless specifically requested to be a private one that is not live-streamed for everybody on YouTube or all the social medias that I use, because I'm always going to be doing that with all my games. That's the whole point of what I'm doing. And then one of the other things I wanted to know is if they don't want to have it live-streamed and they want a private session of some kind, that will be more. But maybe that's where we can have a champion where we will get the private sessions only. They're the only ones that will be able to get that.

All tiers have things live streamed unless it is the, uh, um, fourth tier is the only place that some of the things can be private, per request, and, um, whenever it is a request of something being private, it normally is not at a discounted rate, and there might be a different price or a premium price depending on what is being done. If it's like a break, it won't, it'll just be a regular one, there probably won't be a discounted rate, but if it's a, um, uh, like a dungeon game, a Dungeon Master dungeon game of some kind, or, I mean, an adventure game of some kind that I've built, and they want it to be private with them and some friends, it would be, end up probably being more just because I can't get extra money from it online. That's the whole point why it's cheap for them, it's because I get the ads online, um, but if they want a private one, I can do that. But either way, that's why it's not as expensive as other Dungeon Masters kind of thing, and it's cheap and they get discounts.

[2024-10-04 19:38:49] FoSGamers:
All of the tiers when it comes to the personalized live sessions, those are going to be ones that are like in the middle of live streams, so like on a slow day, or I'll plan it where I'm just going to do it on a certain day, or maybe days that are slower, ones like Tuesdays or Wednesdays, or certain days I know that are going to be slow, like later on in the day I might do something and not even plan on opening PAX, that type of thing. But if it's going to be a busy thing and I'm opening PAX, I'm not going to actually be taking up the hour. It could also be split up where they use it for like 10 minutes here, 20 minutes here, 30 minutes there. They don't want to use it all in one hour combined. That's why the point of what it is is I'm giving them some time to be able to split it up so they can use it however they want. That's why I'm going to do it that way. And then we'll make sure, like I said, it needs to be, so whenever it's, yes, it's personalized where I do it with them and I'm talking to them specifically and I'm not doing it with anybody else involved. What I'm doing is with them at that point, but it's also during my regular live streams where other people are participating at other times and doing other stuff. So it's not only just them in the stream.

If I change the price of a tier, are people grandfathered in at the old price?

[2024-10-04 19:56:36] ChatGPT:
When you change the price of a YouTube membership tier, existing members are **not grandfathered in** at the old price. This means that if you adjust the price of a tier, **all members at that tier** will be subject to the new pricing, whether they are new or existing members. YouTube doesn’t offer an option to grandfather existing members into the old price once the tier pricing changes.

If you increase or decrease the tier price, members will either see the new charge during their next billing cycle, or they can decide to downgrade or cancel their membership based on the updated cost.

Explain how badges and custom emoji work

[2024-10-04 20:09:48] ChatGPT:
YouTube offers **loyalty badges** and **custom emojis** as part of the perks available for channel memberships. Here’s how they work:

### **Loyalty Badges**:
1. **Purpose**: Loyalty badges appear next to a member’s username in comments and live chat, helping to distinguish them from non-members.
2. **Customizable by Creators**: As a creator, you can design custom badges that reflect your channel’s theme. These badges can be based on characters, symbols, or themes that resonate with your audience.
3. **Progression System**: YouTube allows creators to assign different badges that change based on how long a user has been a member. For example, a member might start with a basic badge but get upgraded to more exclusive badges after 1 month, 2 months, 6 months, etc.
4. **Display**: Badges are displayed alongside the member’s name in comments, live chats, and other areas where members participate.

### **Custom Emojis**:
1. **Purpose**: Custom emojis are exclusive emojis that only your channel members can use during live chats and comments, enhancing their experience and interaction.
2. **Customizable**: Like badges, you can upload your own designs for emojis. They can be related to your content, memes within your community, or any other theme that makes sense for your audience.
3. **Usage**: Members can use these custom emojis in live chats, similar to how standard emojis work but with the added benefit of uniqueness. These help build a sense of community and make members feel special during interactions.
4. **Limitations**: The number of custom emojis you can upload increases based on how many members you have. You start with a few emoji slots, but as your member count grows, YouTube unlocks additional emoji slots.

### Key Points:
- **Progression**: Badges get more exclusive the longer someone remains a member, helping encourage long-term membership.
- **Customization**: Both badges and emojis are fully customizable by the channel owner, giving you creative control to align them with your content.
- **Visibility**: Both badges and emojis are visible to everyone in the live chat, comments, and other relevant areas where members interact.

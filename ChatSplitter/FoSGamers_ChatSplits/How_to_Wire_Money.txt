To wire money, you typically follow these steps:

### 1. **Choose a Service**:
   - **Bank-to-Bank Wire Transfer**: This is the most common and secure way to transfer money domestically and internationally. Many banks offer online wire transfer options, but you can also do it in person at a branch.
   - **Online Transfer Services**: Services like PayPal, Wise (formerly TransferWise), or Western Union offer wire transfers, often with lower fees and more options for international transfers.

### 2. **Gather the Required Information**:
   You will need certain details depending on whether it’s a domestic or international transfer:
   - **Recipient’s Name**: The full legal name of the person or business receiving the funds.
   - **Recipient’s Bank Account Information**: Includes the bank account number and type (checking or savings).
   - **Recipient’s Bank Routing Number**: For domestic transfers in the U.S., this is a 9-digit number for the recipient’s bank.
   - **SWIFT/BIC Code**: For international transfers, the receiving bank’s SWIFT code is required to identify the bank.
   - **IBAN (International Bank Account Number)**: Often required for transfers to certain countries (e.g., Europe).
   - **Amount and Currency**: The amount of money you want to send and the currency (USD, EUR, etc.).

### 3. **Initiate the Transfer**:
   - **In Person at a Bank**: You can visit a branch and request a wire transfer. You’ll need to provide the required details and, in some cases, sign a form.
   - **Online Banking**: Many banks allow you to initiate a wire transfer online through their website or mobile app. Look for options like “Send Money” or “Wire Transfer.”
   - **Through a Wire Transfer Service**: If using a service like Western Union or Wise, follow the instructions on their website or app. These services will usually require you to create an account.

### 4. **Review Fees and Processing Times**:
   - **Fees**: Banks usually charge between $10–$50 for domestic wire transfers and more for international transfers. Third-party services may have lower fees but will sometimes take longer.
   - **Processing Times**: Domestic transfers often complete within 1–2 business days, while international transfers can take up to 3–5 business days, depending on the countries involved.

### 5. **Confirm the Transfer**:
   After submitting the wire transfer, you will receive a confirmation number or receipt. Keep this information in case you need to track the transaction.

### 6. **Monitor the Transfer**:
   Check your bank account or the service you used to ensure the money is debited, and confirm with the recipient that they have received the funds.

#### Summary:
To wire money, select a service (bank, PayPal, Wise), gather details like the recipient’s bank information, initiate the transfer (online or in-person), pay any associated fees, and confirm the transfer. Processing times and fees vary by method.

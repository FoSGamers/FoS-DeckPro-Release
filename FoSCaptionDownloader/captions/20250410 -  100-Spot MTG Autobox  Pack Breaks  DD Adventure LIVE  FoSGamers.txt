[00:20:03] way they stay flat and even when you
[00:20:05] take them out, they don't really crumble
[00:20:06] up like that. Also, if you put them in a
[00:20:07] box with like one of those humidifier
[00:20:09] packy things, like those things you get
[00:20:10] in like things that suck out air, water,

[00:22:02] go big BK. So whenever they have this
[00:22:05] here on the pack that means I'm pretty

[00:22:08] made in Japan they're going to always
[00:22:10] have the first eight of the collector

[00:40:59] um I know
[00:41:04] exactly. Really? Oh, you guys going to
[00:41:06] go in Vegas? Oh, damn. I was thinking of

[00:41:10] went last year, but we can't go this
[00:41:12] year. We just can't uh can't swing it

[00:41:30] this year that I was there. Last year,
[00:41:31] the last one I was

[00:42:17] you know? But yeah, it's one of those
[00:42:19] they go out. I think what it is a lot of
[00:42:20] times now is the bots going and buy a

[00:56:45] foil. Bloodfell caves and your
[00:56:49] Ugan eye of the

[00:56:54] dragon. They made a baby dragon version.
[00:57:00] Congratulations on that one, my friend.
[00:57:02] Baron steep is a good one. We get some
[00:57:06] heat. He's bulking in the bulking stage.
[00:57:09] Yes, in the bulking stage. Ugan was in
[00:57:11] the bulking stage at that point.
[00:57:17] All right. Nice. Making difficult for
[00:57:19] schooling.
[00:57:21] Uh-oh. Generator's acting up again.
[00:57:24] Well, I put on a little air to get to
[00:57:25] add a little load to it. You told me to.
[00:57:27] They don't. No, it's fine. No, it's
[00:57:29] fine. It's fine. Let me put you with
[00:57:31] your other stuff here. It way weighs up.
[00:57:34] Not bad. Not bad at all. I know. We got
[00:57:37] some good luck with our stuff. I don't
[00:57:39] know why I I always see what it is. I
[00:57:41] can't get anything good for myself. So,
[00:57:42] if you go watch any of the shorts, we
[00:57:44] put shorts out. I put shorts out. I've
[00:57:45] been doing a few of them. Open some
[00:57:46] packs for ourselves. And I'm absolutely
[00:57:48] horrible at getting anything good. My
[00:57:50] family members might. I'll never get
[00:57:52] anything. But if somebody like you like
[00:57:54] I'll pull it. I appreciate it too, my
[00:57:56] friend. Thank you. I know. the Picasso
[00:57:58] of packs for Wazer. Every time Wazer
[00:58:01] comes in, he like asks for something.
[00:58:02] I'm like, "All right, yeah, sure. We'll
[00:58:03] pull that out." And and we
[00:58:08] do. Exactly. The hobby rips. You can rip
[00:58:11] for I can like I open up. So, we have um
[00:58:14] these things here. We still do them. We
[00:58:15] don't use them as much, but we have
[00:58:17] these things here that we call them
[00:58:18] Benjies. All right. We uh when I do
[00:58:20] breaks, I use them sometimes in the
[00:58:22] brakes that you guys get to pick. And
[00:58:23] it's got like in here and they got like
[00:58:24] baseball cards from like the 80s9s. Um,
[00:58:28] and then there's some like video games,
[00:58:30] movie things and stuff like that. I
[00:58:33] pulled out a $600 baseball card that was
[00:58:35] a rookie Ken Griffy Jr. for somebody. I
[00:58:37] was like, you got to be kidding me. That
[00:58:39] was a 50 cent pack. That was just an
[00:58:40] extra fun thing that I was throwing in.
[00:58:43] Like it's
[00:58:44] insane. Like I can But if I try to do
[00:58:47] something like that, I'm going to be
[00:58:48] lucky if I get a penny back.
[00:58:55] Yeah, exactly. That's got to be it. It's
[00:58:56] got to be the vibes. You're sitting
[00:58:57] there like, I'm gonna This is going to
[00:58:58] suck. I'm not going to get anything
[00:59:00] because I always think I'm not going to
[00:59:01] get anything. And that's You know what?
[00:59:02] Maybe that's it. I'm going to start
[00:59:03] going serialized card. Serialized card.
[00:59:06] Yes. And I'm going to pull out a
[00:59:07] serialized every
[00:59:12] time when it's someone else. Yeah,
[00:59:14] exactly. You got to have
[00:59:17] it. Exactly. Everybody, whenever you
[00:59:19] pull for yourself, Big BK,
[00:59:23] right? Hey, see see Pu. Uh uh um I have
[00:59:27] um my sons and my wife open the packs.
[00:59:30] I'll open like one or two every now and
[00:59:32] again. I have not I have pulled some
[00:59:34] Ugans, Jacob. We actually pulled two
[00:59:37] Uggans. We pulled just one an Ugan just
[00:59:39] a minute ago, Jacob. And um a couple
[00:59:42] days ago, we pulled an Ugan Japanese
[00:59:46] foil. I can show you what we got here.
[00:59:48] Let me see. Here's the Ugan we got for
[00:59:51] our buddy
[00:59:53] Wazer. Look at
[00:59:55] that. There you go,
[00:59:58] Jacob. Not bad right there,
[01:00:04] huh? Good morning. Oops. Oopsy soup.
[01:00:13] Oh, we are in uh we are currently in
[01:00:15] Florida. The weather's okay. a little
[01:00:16] cool, but it is good for working on the
[01:00:20] boat, which is what we got to do when
[01:00:21] we're done here today. Actually, Mike,
[01:00:23] depending on when we get on the dock.
[01:00:25] That's a long story. We were supposed to
[01:00:27] be on the dock weeks
[01:00:29] ago to be able to get our our solar
[01:00:32] archon. We've been sitting here for
[01:00:34] almost 3 weeks because first time they
[01:00:36] got late delivering it. Then there was
[01:00:39] an issue getting on the dock to get it.
[01:00:41] Then then we were supposed to get on the
[01:00:43] dock this week, the beginning of this
[01:00:44] week. Well, someone crashed into the
[01:00:46] sandbar in front of us twice and ruined
[01:00:49] their boat. So, they're sitting on the
[01:00:50] dock in our spot right now and we're
[01:00:52] waiting for them to
[01:00:54] move. We are currently in a barren
[01:00:56] wasteland. We are definitely
[01:00:58] Oopsie. I got a Japanese clarin
[01:01:00] showcase. Well, can't really find any.
[01:01:03] Yeah, sometimes you have to look on eBay
[01:01:04] for
[01:01:09] it. Yeah, we have seen a bit of wild
[01:01:11] things in the travels. We saw some weird
[01:01:12] flooding when we were in St. Thomas. It
[01:01:13] was a basic decent rain and I mean it
[01:01:15] took out
[01:01:17] um roads to the point that they were
[01:01:19] like it looked like there was
[01:01:21] um a a ravine being made in the road
[01:01:24] like you had to go jump over. But yeah,
[01:01:27] we've been through some around ourselves
[01:01:29] in Florida with the hurricanes and
[01:01:30] flooding around us.
[01:01:34] Yes, that is doing stuff like that barge
[01:01:37] work. My family had were fishermen in
[01:01:39] New England for generations. I actually
[01:01:41] I used to go I used to fish with them
[01:01:43] and lobster with them when I was younger
[01:01:46] before my father passed away and uh we
[01:01:48] used to and I never realized like it was
[01:01:51] a hard job. I just thought it was a job.
[01:01:52] It was what we did. It was just normal.
[01:01:54] That was our life. And I never thought
[01:01:56] anything of it until like I was doing
[01:01:59] something else and I made a comment to
[01:02:01] somebody about it and they were like I
[01:02:04] said, "Oh, I in the military." And I
[01:02:06] said, "Thank you for your service." who
[01:02:07] I was talking to. I'm like, "Dude, not
[01:02:08] and thank you too and your family
[01:02:09] because more of your family died
[01:02:11] probably than not mine have uh when it
[01:02:14] comes to fishing and compared to the
[01:02:16] military." And I'm thinking about him
[01:02:17] [Â __Â ] I had an uncle die. I had a cousin
[01:02:21] die. I had a grandfather die. Son of a
[01:02:24] [Â __Â ] I think he's right on that one.
[01:02:26] And they all died from either drowning
[01:02:28] or something along that lines from the
[01:02:32] ocean. It is big. open water is is is
[01:02:35] wild. We we sailed uh 1,200 miles from
[01:02:39] St. Thomas up here um a couple
[01:02:41] overnights and one of the times we have
[01:02:43] we're at 10ft waves and oh my god that
[01:02:45] stuff you should check out the YouTube
[01:02:46] channel once gets my wife gets that
[01:02:48] stuff up there Steph because those waves
[01:02:50] there we're just going up and down. You
[01:02:52] can't see it that well on the camera but
[01:02:53] I mean you're going up and you can hear
[01:02:54] ourselves surfing down. You pulled a Oh,
[01:02:58] nice on the Japanese
[01:03:00] Ugan. Well, I've been I mean I've done
[01:03:03] it my entire life. When I grew up, I was
[01:03:04] young. Um and I used to be like like 3
[01:03:07] four years old. I was going down the
[01:03:08] boat running wires for my dad, helping
[01:03:10] him. Not really doing much. Just like
[01:03:11] taking a wire, walking through a hole,
[01:03:13] but that was easier for me to get
[01:03:14] through than him. Then as I got older, I
[01:03:16] started doing more. I helped him with
[01:03:17] the boat. I I like uh you know, I'd
[01:03:19] steam out when he would be napping and
[01:03:20] stuff like that. And I remember one of
[01:03:22] the first things I thought like I I
[01:03:23] didn't realize how like I never actually
[01:03:26] understood how danger it was dangerous
[01:03:27] it was. It was just kind of like my
[01:03:29] life. And I had uh I always thought my
[01:03:32] family was like playing with me with
[01:03:34] certain dangers until I went out one
[01:03:36] time and it was during like winter and
[01:03:37] it was ice starting to form on the front
[01:03:39] of the boat. My dad goes, "Hey, take the
[01:03:40] sledgehammer and go break the ice." I'm
[01:03:42] like, "What are you talking about? No,
[01:03:44] I'm not I'm not the stupid young guy.
[01:03:46] I've been around the fishing industry my
[01:03:48] entire life. I'm not you're not pulling
[01:03:49] some new greenhorn trick on me." And
[01:03:52] he's like, "No, no, seriously. If you
[01:03:54] need to go break the ice off cuz if we
[01:03:56] get too much ice build up and we hit a
[01:03:57] big wave, we're going to capsize." I'm
[01:03:58] like, "Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'm
[01:04:00] going out there. I'm like on the front
[01:04:01] of the
[01:04:05] boat. Breaking ice
[01:04:08] off. Yeah. Crazy stuff you do when
[01:04:11] you're when you don't even think about
[01:04:12] it. I mean, you just That was life.
[01:04:17] Oh, a lobsterman in Maine in your
[01:04:19] 20s. You do see some crazy things in the
[01:04:22] water with people like that. So, yeah, I
[01:04:23] I completely understand that. I've been
[01:04:26] around there before. It's It's one of
[01:04:27] those like insane things that
[01:04:30] um just
[01:04:36] Yeah, I do not have a physical store,
[01:04:39] Jacob. Actually, um I am I long story
[01:04:43] short, we travel around on a boat um
[01:04:48] sailing the entire east coast of the US
[01:04:50] and in the Caribbean. And this is where
[01:04:52] we do our pack breaks actually. Um, so
[01:04:53] if you see every we'll do uh once we get
[01:04:55] back to the Caribbean after we do our
[01:04:57] solar arch, I'll do some of the uh be
[01:04:58] start the shows up in the morning
[01:05:00] outside with some uh with a coffee and
[01:05:02] you guys can see like what we have in
[01:05:04] our background and further that going
[01:05:08] on. Well, that's what I was wondering
[01:05:10] there. So for you, my friend, I was
[01:05:13] going to give you a couple options here.
[01:05:15] Since this is your character, we can do
[01:05:18] we can upgrade your character's look if
[01:05:20] you'd like. Now, for your upgrades, I
[01:05:24] actually was thinking about that, my
[01:05:25] buddy Big BK. So, you have all of those
[01:05:29] extra weapons you
[01:05:30] have. Now, what I was thinking was maybe
[01:05:34] we um we find you some some weap some
[01:05:38] armor instead of
[01:05:41] weapons. Yeah, thank you, Jacob. Yeah,
[01:05:43] so I've been doing that for a few months
[01:05:45] here. We uh about couple years though
[01:05:47] I've been doing the streaming on here
[01:05:48] and selling uh selling Magikards doing
[01:05:50] some games like we do like a an a D and
[01:05:53] D adventure game where there's all kinds
[01:05:54] of images for all the things that go on
[01:05:56] and who you meet along the way things
[01:05:58] you do cool armor. There you go. All
[01:06:01] right.
[01:06:02] So now you have your
[01:06:05] armor and this is what we're going to
[01:06:07] do. You have your armor. You have your
[01:06:11] loot. You still
[01:06:12] have gold, platinum,
[01:06:15] metal, some mystery, a mystery
[01:06:19] chip, and that water sack from the
[01:06:24] dragon. So, what do we say we upgrade
[01:06:28] the gator
[01:06:30] armor with a with the mystery chip? See
[01:06:33] what happens there.
[01:06:35] The metal. And you want to use the
[01:06:38] platinum or the gold?
[01:06:44] Cod piece. Yes, definitely cod
[01:06:47] piece. Need you need like a cod piece
[01:06:50] that's like this big, right? You know,
[01:06:51] like that big.
[01:06:53] Platinum. It is. All
[01:06:58] right. Let's see.
[01:07:07] Oh, wow. The light on that one.
[01:07:24] I did this.
[01:07:58] Yes. How you doing?
[01:08:11] Hold on.
[01:08:33] Let's see if
[01:08:35] this can do
[01:08:43] anything. Let's see. Let's get you
[01:08:45] something
[01:08:47] good. Let's see what it gives you for
[01:08:50] the extra stuff here, my friend. We're
[01:08:52] going to get you uh some of these. I
[01:08:54] like it. Aaron, not
[01:09:01] bad. There should be um if you go to the
[01:09:05] the link that has the link tree should
[01:09:07] have my my store where you could get a
[01:09:10] Wildsville drain collector pack. And
[01:09:12] when you pick that up, um I I should get
[01:09:14] a notification of that and uh just put
[01:09:17] your well I'll say your name on there,
[01:09:19] but just let me know and we'll get it
[01:09:21] open for you. Some people buy them
[01:09:22] through the store. I've had more than
[01:09:23] one person, Jacob, buy them through the
[01:09:25] store here, and we do that and we'll
[01:09:26] ship it out to
[01:09:27] you. All right, let me see what we have.
[01:09:31] No.
[01:09:57] [Laughter]
[01:10:04] Hold on. We might we might have to do
[01:10:06] this one just because the comments we
[01:10:08] had been having earlier.
[01:10:19] Great. Then I want to know
[01:10:23] how did you hear
[01:11:04] All right, let's do that.
[01:11:12] This is not going to probably be the one
[01:11:13] that we use, but because I don't like
[01:11:15] the rest of it, but I have to say the
[01:11:19] the comment of the the COD piece comment
[01:11:21] is what got me here, which is the reason
[01:11:24] why we are uh doing this. Hold on a
[01:11:29] second. Let me find our friend here.
[01:11:36] All right, there we go.
[01:11:42] There you go. What do you think? I don't
[01:11:44] like how the uh the sword and the other
[01:11:46] stuff is,
[01:11:47] but it was a comment on the COD piece
[01:11:50] and that was what came out of one of the
[01:11:51] four
[01:11:55] vict I got to use that. I've got to use
[01:12:02] that. There we go. This is what I was
[01:12:04] looking for.
[01:12:09] Something like
[01:12:21] that. Let's
[01:12:24] see. What do you think? You're not
[01:12:27] opposed to
[01:12:29] it. So, that's some of the that's that
[01:12:32] there one. But I was trying to get it to
[01:12:33] go with the electronic stuff there to
[01:12:35] make it a little bit
[01:12:38] better. So, uh, let me know. Give me one
[01:12:41] second here.
[01:12:48] Ah, that's what I was looking for.
[01:12:55] There we go. I think that's better. That
[01:12:58] actually might work,
[01:13:00] too.
[01:13:02] Here's Here's what I was looking
[01:13:10] for. I think this one's good for big big
[01:13:14] BK
[01:13:19] here. How's that? You have your upgraded
[01:13:22] armor.
[01:13:27] There you go. That's what I was looking
[01:13:28] for, by the way.
[01:13:30] That's what I was looking for. By the
[01:13:32] way, do we need uh do we need full body
[01:13:34] armor or you think that's good? Your
[01:13:36] warrior style. I like it. So, you have
[01:13:38] your lightning sword and you have your
[01:13:41] uh incendiary gat that you hold
[01:13:43] there. And what we're going to do now is
[01:13:46] you now being a little bit stronger,
[01:13:49] we're going to have to give you uh we're
[01:13:50] going to have to give you a little bit
[01:13:51] more strength though. We're going to
[01:13:52] have to add a strength to you. Now that
[01:13:55] you have that extra strength, that'll
[01:13:57] allow you to uh use your pirate sword,
[01:14:00] your sword that you have
[01:14:03] um and have the uh have your weapon in
[01:14:08] the same
[01:14:09] hand. Can't see the gap. Well, oh, hold
[01:14:12] on. Hold on. Let me um shrink it down
[01:14:14] then. Is that better? Can you see it
[01:14:17] now?
[01:14:24] All right, there you go. So, what we'll
[01:14:27] do is uh you now have we're going to
[01:14:30] give you a little extra, but what you
[01:14:31] can do is you can carry both of those
[01:14:33] weapons at the same time because the
[01:14:35] image has shows that you can carry both
[01:14:37] of them at the same time. Now, that
[01:14:39] being said, we're going to upgrade your
[01:14:42] armor. Gatoradillo
[01:14:45] um
[01:14:49] upgraded. No, not the end of
[01:14:55] it. Upgraded gator
[01:14:59] llama. You're going to go and what it
[01:15:02] will do is you have any melee that
[01:15:03] attacks you will be a minus
[01:15:07] uh five. Any range that goes after you
[01:15:09] will be a
[01:15:10] minus three on the attack.
[01:15:17] And what will happen now is you also
[01:15:22] with the
[01:15:24] uh with your uh one with your tech in
[01:15:28] there, you have a one in4 chance
[01:15:35] um to
[01:15:39] [Music]
[01:15:40] heal five health.
[01:15:50] You are now up to
[01:15:52] having two weapons that will go together
[01:15:56] when you attack. But now remember, one's
[01:16:00] going to be a primary and one will be a
[01:16:02] secondary. So you can't always use
[01:16:03] everything with them. But yes, you can
[01:16:05] use two
[01:16:08] weapons. So there you go. We're going to
[01:16:10] add that in there. So, you now have your
[01:16:11] upgraded gator minus five on any melee
[01:16:14] attack, minus three on any range attack,
[01:16:15] and a one in4 chance to heal, five
[01:16:18] health points because of your uh because
[01:16:20] of what you put in
[01:16:23] there. So, we're going to get rid of all
[01:16:28] that. All right.
[01:16:33] So, yes, now you can use uh you'll be
[01:16:36] able to use your gat and your pirate
[01:16:40] sword at the same
[01:16:43] time to
[01:16:46] attack. But you only get one of the one
[01:16:50] and four things. So, you can you can't
[01:16:51] shock and explode. It's only going to be
[01:16:53] pirate sword or the incendiary that does
[01:16:56] its
[01:16:58] thing. You have an empty-ish bag
[01:17:01] finally. Yes, that is true. You have
[01:17:03] some night vision goggles, which was
[01:17:05] nice, big BK. You got
[01:17:07] um your night vision goggles you
[01:17:10] made. You also have your uh map that you
[01:17:15] have the broken rustorn drone. You still
[01:17:17] have that. You have the go code
[01:17:19] disc. You still have five code discs and
[01:17:23] a couple of food in the water sack and
[01:17:25] some
[01:17:26] gold. Your armor, you have three health
[01:17:28] packs of 20. Three rataways.
[01:17:31] the incendiary gap. The upgraded
[01:17:34] incendiary
[01:17:35] gap, which is this thing here. Your
[01:17:39] pirate sword, which is that one there.
[01:17:42] Oh, that's not it. Which is that one
[01:17:45] there. And
[01:17:48] uh your alien sniper rifle. Where is
[01:17:51] that
[01:17:53] one? Alien sniper
[01:17:55] rifle. You I think you forgot about that
[01:17:58] one. You have a sword. A regular sword.
[01:18:01] and a knife. Wait, no, you gave the
[01:18:04] knife to um the other guy. You gave the
[01:18:06] knife to what's his
[01:18:07] name? Arabian goggles. Yes, you got some
[01:18:10] good
[01:18:11] things. Got some good stuff there, my
[01:18:14] friend. For your
[01:18:16] adventuring, you like it. So, this is
[01:18:19] what I'm going to do now. I'm going to
[01:18:21] take a drink and have some fun
[01:18:26] here and see what happens. Now you had
[01:18:29] been um
[01:18:32] got healed up, my friend Big
[01:18:35] BK. And you start wandering
[01:18:40] further in the wasteland and you find
[01:18:42] this uh this thing here. I know that's
[01:18:44] not you as a character, but it's a gener
[01:18:46] generic one. Now Big BK. Now that this
[01:18:50] doesn't look there's one's an angry one
[01:18:51] and the other one doesn't look like
[01:18:52] there's a
[01:18:53] problem. You like the Arabian goggles?
[01:18:59] So, you got to decide. You know, you can
[01:19:01] decide what you'd like to do, my friend.
[01:19:06] We had some fun this morning ripping
[01:19:08] some packs. So, let's have some fun
[01:19:09] doing a little maybe D and D
[01:19:11] today. Pass on by. I like it. All right.
[01:19:14] So, you look at that thing. You not
[01:19:15] really anything. You pass right by
[01:19:19] there. Mystic says you should try to you
[01:19:22] should try to milk it. I don't know if
[01:19:23] that's a good idea.
[01:19:26] [Music]
[01:19:54] Okay. We can do that one.
[01:20:04] [Music]
[01:20:32] All right. One second.
[01:20:50] There we
[01:20:51] go. Aha. All right. I just tried to I
[01:20:54] had to get the thing that I wanted
[01:20:55] because it wasn't showing up right.
[01:21:08] Now I have it. Took me a second. I'm
[01:21:10] sorry.
[01:21:13] There. There we
[01:21:18] go. Now, our wasteland adventure goes
[01:21:21] wandering past
[01:21:23] um some things
[01:21:26] here. When they find uh they come into
[01:21:28] an area where there's a bunch of uh
[01:21:30] these weird little buildings. And some
[01:21:32] of them are open, some of them are
[01:21:33] locked. Not really exactly sure what
[01:21:35] they are.
[01:21:46] All right, you go wandering past these.
[01:21:48] Uhoh, I can't see those
[01:21:56] now. Uhoh. No, I don't like how that
[01:21:59] There we go.
[01:22:01] Now, Big, I want to know, do you want to
[01:22:04] investigate those things? Are you going
[01:22:07] to kind of wander on by and kind of let
[01:22:10] it go?
[01:22:14] Now, I know Big B, you don't look like
[01:22:16] that, but that is our adventure. That's
[01:22:17] our generic adventure, depending on
[01:22:19] whoever's hanging out. I know that's you
[01:22:20] wandering by there, but you have to
[01:22:23] decide, Big, are you going to
[01:22:26] investigate any of those things? You
[01:22:27] going to try to open any rooms? What are
[01:22:28] you going to do?
[01:22:35] You are definitely investigating. Well,
[01:22:37] you go around. You look around those
[01:22:39] rooms, those lock buildings. All right.
[01:22:52] And you run
[01:22:55] into something different.
[01:22:58] What happened there?
[01:23:04] You haven't seen this one before.
[01:23:07] You open one of the doors. An outburst.
[01:23:10] Oh no.
[01:23:20] You see some old You were scavening
[01:23:22] around looking for some old Tekken out
[01:23:24] of a building. Bur something that you
[01:23:25] were not expecting. to be in this area.
[01:23:29] Maybe you are getting close to something
[01:23:31] big, but you've got a bit of a problem.
[01:23:35] You have a robotic uh little uh drone of
[01:23:38] some kind. Looks like it has some rocket
[01:23:41] launchers and maybe an assault
[01:23:46] rifle that bursts out of one of those
[01:23:48] buildings there. I guess you shouldn't
[01:23:50] been looking around. Star scans you,
[01:23:52] beeps a little bit and
[01:23:54] goes, "Enemy
[01:23:58] detected.
[01:24:03] Eliminate." It is a robot daddy. Now,
[01:24:06] this robot shoots
[01:24:09] rockets and has an
[01:24:13] uh assault rifle, which is pretty much
[01:24:15] it's just a you know, actually it's more
[01:24:17] of like a machine gun. I'd say it's an
[01:24:18] automatic rifle. Just shoots. And then
[01:24:22] also it is uh 60 on his
[01:24:29] health. So Big
[01:24:31] BK, you've got to
[01:24:35] decide. Are you going to face that
[01:24:42] encounter? Do you want to turn around
[01:24:45] and hightail it out of there until you
[01:24:48] have a friend to come help?
[01:24:59] Oh yeah, that not a bad idea. Use some
[01:25:01] guacamole. Use some use the uh
[01:25:04] potentially uh see if there's a way to
[01:25:06] use the uh night vision to do something
[01:25:08] to
[01:25:11] it. We may have lost Big BK for a minute
[01:25:13] there. Sometimes they get busy. Have to
[01:25:15] go and do things.
[01:25:21] really only Seth booster. All right, let
[01:25:22] me take a look on the Shopify there. I
[01:25:25] don't know why that should have
[01:25:26] collectors in
[01:25:38] there. Sorry about that. Let me add that
[01:25:40] in there. I guess it's not.
[01:25:45] I had them in there. No wonder why no
[01:25:46] one's grabbing them.
[01:26:00] Here we go.
[01:26:03] Let me put that in quickly so that you
[01:26:05] can see it.
[01:26:36] There you go. Should be there now.
[01:26:40] Let me know if you can't see that. Sorry
[01:26:42] about that. I don't know why it didn't
[01:26:43] show up.
[01:26:51] Oh, Jacob, how's it going, Guac? Thank
[01:26:53] you. Thank
[01:26:55] you. Oh, what I was saying was you have
[01:26:57] a choice, my friend. Hey, if you're
[01:26:59] passing out, that's fine. We can pick
[01:27:00] this up again tomorrow if you'd like.
[01:27:02] But your choice is you have uh you
[01:27:06] encountered something
[01:27:07] here. You were in that locked build
[01:27:09] wandering around the locked buildings
[01:27:11] here and you uh decided you're going to
[01:27:13] investigate and when you did out of one
[01:27:16] of the doors that you tried to open came
[01:27:18] this robot. It scanned you and said
[01:27:20] enemy detected eliminate. It's got a
[01:27:23] rocket launcher and a machine gun with
[01:27:25] it.
[01:27:31] You going to do it? All right. We're go
[01:27:33] after that. You go. We're taking that
[01:27:36] thing
[01:27:37] out.
[01:27:39] So, what you do? Are you going to use
[01:27:42] your
[01:27:45] um incendiary? Which one do you want to
[01:27:47] try to go? Your incendiary or your sword
[01:27:49] to do the shock damage or your
[01:27:52] uh g explosion damage? Because you have
[01:27:55] a choice. Remember, you can only use one
[01:27:57] of those.
[01:27:59] Gat. All right. The
[01:28:10] gap. The hell was
[01:28:17] that? All right. So, the
[01:28:20] gap here is your primary weapon.
[01:28:24] With that being your primary, you going
[01:28:25] to try with the
[01:28:26] explosion? All
[01:28:29] right. Nope. Let's remove the
[01:28:32] bot.
[01:28:34] Uh, Big
[01:28:38] BK, that's not a way to start
[01:28:42] it.
[01:28:46] No. Seems like the pick was in the way.
[01:28:48] Does that mean it's a roller
[01:28:51] roll? We can do that. We can do it if
[01:28:53] you
[01:28:56] want. All right, here we
[01:28:59] go. Is that a 16 or is that in the
[01:29:03] middle? Cuz what you need for him to hit
[01:29:05] is an 18. But you have extras with your
[01:29:07] bon with your pluses there cuz you have
[01:29:10] with that incendiary, you have a plus
[01:29:13] eight on that for your
[01:29:16] roll. Either one does hit. That is true.
[01:29:19] So, you get um your two did not hit, but
[01:29:22] you got
[01:29:26] a 8 10. You hit for 10. All righty. You
[01:29:30] hit for
[01:29:32] 10 and it goes from 60 down to
[01:29:36] 50. And
[01:29:42] now you have uh to deal with them
[01:29:46] because you're actually going to go
[01:29:47] after them again. in there though. You
[01:29:48] had this your D5. You're going to go
[01:29:50] with your sword cuz but the D4 doesn't
[01:29:52] count this
[01:29:53] time. Yes, with the with your um I
[01:29:56] thought it was with the sword that you
[01:29:58] had that or is it the incendiary gap
[01:30:01] that you had it?
[01:30:05] Oh, did we upgrade with this? Do we
[01:30:06] upgrade this the Oh, I put it on the
[01:30:09] wrong thing. I put it on the sword for
[01:30:10] it to be
[01:30:11] five instead of uh on the
[01:30:15] incendiary. Yeah, I thought you did it
[01:30:17] on the
[01:30:22] sword. That's why I have the sword here
[01:30:24] like this one with the five of them.
[01:30:25] Well, you hit with it anyways cuz the
[01:30:27] sword you have 12 extra. You hit eight
[01:30:32] um 10 16 with the sword on top of
[01:30:41] it, which brings you down to 34. brings
[01:30:44] that guy down to 34 already from 60. Our
[01:30:48] robot friend is at
[01:30:50] 34. Our robot friend does not like what
[01:30:52] happened and
[01:30:54] they try to attack you now. If the D4
[01:30:58] hits at one Oh no. Oh no. The rocket
[01:31:03] hits. I said if the D4 hits at one and a
[01:31:05] hit. I shouldn't have said that. Huh?
[01:31:10] God damn it.
[01:31:13] Oh no. Big
[01:31:16] BK, you are at um
[01:31:19] 10 18 damage with the rocket
[01:31:24] hitting. All right. Now, when the rocket
[01:31:26] hits, this is the problem of the
[01:31:29] rocket. The rocket luckily you have
[01:31:32] armor. All right. So, you're lucky you
[01:31:34] have some armor because the rocket adds
[01:31:37] on some uh explosion damage, concussion
[01:31:41] damage. But because you have your armor,
[01:31:43] that absorbs some of it. And you also
[01:31:45] have a one in three chance of healing. I
[01:31:48] mean, one in four chance of healing. So,
[01:31:49] you have a Yours was a two, right? You
[01:31:51] said, "Well, there you go. You heal
[01:31:53] five. Look at that. Yours was a two. It
[01:31:55] rolled. You got two."
[01:32:01] No, that
[01:32:03] four that No, you uh 18 and then you
[01:32:08] have on top of it they hit the explosion
[01:32:11] would have been concussion but you have
[01:32:12] the stuff for your um armor which has a
[01:32:16] one in4 chance of healing which is what
[01:32:18] I just did there and you said your two
[01:32:19] was your number that you had chose
[01:32:21] right you do get a minus to range your
[01:32:23] attacks I'm not done yet that's what I
[01:32:25] was saying you have but you have to heal
[01:32:26] first because you had the one in4 chance
[01:32:28] your range is a minus three for your
[01:32:31] ranged attack. So that's what I kind of
[01:32:33] was getting at. Instead of being
[01:32:34] concussed and knocked all the way over,
[01:32:37] you are blown back a little bit, but Big
[01:32:40] BK's armor helps. He only takes that 18
[01:32:45] damage, bringing you down to 82 health,
[01:32:50] but because of your five health refill,
[01:32:51] you go back up to 87.
[01:32:55] See, because you had a one in4 chance
[01:32:57] every
[01:32:59] time you do have a minus range. You get
[01:33:01] a minus the uh minus three on ranged.
[01:33:04] That's what
[01:33:07] happens. Now, that rocket launcher
[01:33:11] definitely think he's doing well there.
[01:33:14] What are you going after him
[01:33:16] with? Big BK, you have your um weapons.
[01:33:19] Do you have your incendiary gap and your
[01:33:23] supreme pirates sword? Going to shoot at
[01:33:25] him again. All right, now you shoot
[01:33:27] again. Here we
[01:33:33] go. There you go. So, you hit
[01:33:39] um There you are. All right, that's
[01:33:41] nine. You hit for nine with Oh, with the
[01:33:46] incendiary because how actually you
[01:33:47] don't hit. No, it's only plus
[01:33:52] eight. Oh,
[01:33:54] no. But the
[01:33:56] sword is what you have now
[01:34:00] coming. Well, you have 12 with the
[01:34:02] sword, so that helps you. You've got um
[01:34:06] 10,
[01:34:08] 14, 17. You hit four.
[01:34:16] which is
[01:34:17] good. Brings it down to 17 health. Now
[01:34:21] that
[01:34:24] robot, that robot there, its
[01:34:28] arm
[01:34:29] holding the uh the assault rifle, the uh
[01:34:33] the machine gun
[01:34:35] drops. You missed with the gat, though.
[01:34:37] You did, but you hit with the sword.
[01:34:43] Now, luckily you hit with the sword
[01:34:45] there because now that guy, he's going
[01:34:48] to attack you. See if he hits. Oh,
[01:34:51] that's on. Come
[01:34:55] on. Oh no, he got one again. But he
[01:34:58] missed this time. Oh, you got lucky.
[01:35:00] They got a four. He missed. So he tries
[01:35:04] again. That that robot drives a rock at
[01:35:07] you again because it lost its arm there
[01:35:08] with the assault with the machine gun,
[01:35:10] but it misses. Now the rocket lands near
[01:35:13] you. You swinging with a sword the main
[01:35:15] time. I like it. So you go with the
[01:35:18] sword for the main
[01:35:21] one. Do your work.
[01:35:25] Oh, it's in the
[01:35:27] middle. Do we call that a 20 or a six or
[01:35:32] is that a roll? Should we give you a 20?
[01:35:36] My My Steph says I should give you the
[01:35:37] 20.
[01:35:40] All right, we'll give you the 20 because
[01:35:41] Steph said so. My wife said we should
[01:35:44] give you the 20. I like I like her. You
[01:35:46] like her answer? All right, so Steph is
[01:35:48] going to give you uh Steph says we're
[01:35:50] giving the 20. Uh and that means you get
[01:35:53] a critical. So that four will be your
[01:35:55] shock. That's going to hit your
[01:35:58] shock for your uh your your
[01:36:01] your weapon there. Your pirate sword
[01:36:05] hits
[01:36:06] shocks that
[01:36:09] bot to the point that you chop off its
[01:36:12] rocket launcher, but it's in half the
[01:36:14] rocket launcher. Its head falls off and
[01:36:17] it starts twitching midair as an
[01:36:22] electric shock goes through its body and
[01:36:25] it falls to the ground and is dead. Now,
[01:36:28] my friend Big BK. Oh, hold on. That's
[01:36:30] what I was looking for. You stand over
[01:36:35] him. Oh, you didn't want to cut the
[01:36:37] launcher. Ah, well, I was thinking you
[01:36:41] wanted to get rid of the launcher.
[01:36:42] That's what you're swinging at. So, he
[01:36:43] swung over there and he got him. They
[01:36:45] got it taking Well, maybe, you know, who
[01:36:46] knows? Maybe you can take the pieces and
[01:36:47] see what happens to
[01:36:49] it. You know, you can scavenge it,
[01:36:52] right? Cod pieces glistening in the sun
[01:36:58] there. A little shine in the
[01:37:02] sun. Oh, you wanted a new launcher.
[01:37:05] Well, you know what? How's this? You can
[01:37:07] take the parts of it and we can uh we
[01:37:10] can see you have a lot of money. A lot
[01:37:12] of Pogs there. Maybe we can see if you
[01:37:13] can uh get that guy put
[01:37:18] together. Maybe you can get it put
[01:37:20] together at some point. Ah,
[01:37:23] yes. Not a bad
[01:37:25] one cuz you have a I mean, you can
[01:37:28] scavenge it. It's all It's yours to
[01:37:35] scavenge. You might be able to. Yeah,
[01:37:37] you got a little bit of money. I don't
[01:37:39] think you have enough Pogs. Yeah. I mean
[01:37:40] you Yeah. I
[01:37:43] mean, yeah. What? Why does it have All
[01:37:47] right. So, you have the broken rocket
[01:37:48] launcher. All right. On it, because it
[01:37:51] had the assault rifle that it was
[01:37:52] shooting you
[01:37:53] with, there is a about 50 rounds of
[01:37:57] assault rifle
[01:37:59] ammo. And on it, you also
[01:38:03] found a
[01:38:06] um intelligence booster.
[01:38:11] and a strength booster. So, there you
[01:38:14] go for that. There's no Pogs on it.
[01:38:19] Well, but you can take the uh you can
[01:38:21] try to take the broken rocket launcher
[01:38:22] if you'd like. Permanent booster. Yes,
[01:38:25] there's a couple permanent boosters.
[01:38:27] Strength and intelligence.
[01:38:31] Correct. That is correct. I'm guessing
[01:38:34] you're going to use those, right?
[01:38:37] bring you up to three strength
[01:38:39] and two intelligence.
[01:38:45] All righty. Then you're going to take a
[01:38:47] broken rocket
[01:38:57] launcher. And your ammo for incendiary
[01:39:01] gap goes shot that many times. Uh
[01:39:11] down. Oh, it goes up to 200
[01:39:13] rounds. You got a lot of ammo right
[01:39:18] now. Definitely have a lot of ammo. All
[01:39:21] right, so use those. Pick those up. You
[01:39:23] pick up uh the broken the broken uh
[01:39:26] rocket launcher from you chopping that
[01:39:28] thing in half, getting rid of
[01:39:29] it. Going to keep going. I like it. You
[01:39:34] keep wandering
[01:39:35] further. Now, as you wander, my friend,
[01:39:38] this is what we're going to do. Let's
[01:39:40] see. Cuz you know, you have some of
[01:39:42] those things. You got to see different
[01:39:43] stuff along the way. Now,
[01:40:05] All righty. You are wandering through.
[01:40:07] You're wandering further. You go, "All
[01:40:08] right, I took care of that
[01:40:11] guy. Nothing left in these log
[01:40:13] buildings." Uh, there was only a couple
[01:40:14] of them and he snuck out. That was the
[01:40:16] whole reason of them, I guess. You
[01:40:18] decide, you know what? I'm going to
[01:40:19] wander further through the wasteland.
[01:40:24] Then
[01:40:25] uh as you wander, you happen
[01:40:28] upon a small
[01:40:32] town. All
[01:40:33] right. And in that small town, there are
[01:40:38] a couple of things there.
[01:40:41] There is what looks like a
[01:40:43] bar and
[01:40:46] potentially a
[01:40:51] um shop of some
[01:40:55] kind.
[01:40:57] So, Big
[01:41:01] BK, what would you like to do a little
[01:41:05] bit here? Oh, I'm going to get the
[01:41:06] images over here.
[01:41:08] Uhoh. There we go. Get that over there.
[01:41:11] What are you going to do in our small
[01:41:13] town while we're rounding around? You
[01:41:15] have this uh it looks like the rusty mug
[01:41:17] and the something moose. I don't know.
[01:41:21] And a shop off to the side
[01:41:24] there. To the
[01:41:29] shop. To the shop, you
[01:41:31] say. So, you go wander into the shop
[01:41:36] and you notice, "Oh, you've seen this
[01:41:38] guy before. It's the hole in the wall
[01:41:41] guy." You look at him, you go, "Hey,
[01:41:43] dude. I've seen you before. What are you
[01:41:45] doing over
[01:41:48] here?" He looks at
[01:41:50] you. Roger is his name. Oh, hey buddy.
[01:41:54] I've seen you in the past. I remember
[01:41:56] you. You were on the other locations
[01:41:57] there. Hey, how's it going, buddy? What
[01:42:00] can I help you with today?
[01:42:05] Oh, so you might have found his main
[01:42:08] location that he stores most of his
[01:42:11] stuff. Who
[01:42:16] knows? Who knows, my
[01:42:20] friends? Checking the wares.
[01:42:29] [Laughter]
[01:42:32] H. Hold on. Hold on. Let me I'm going to
[01:42:35] just do
[01:42:43] this. Hold on. Let's see what it
[01:42:46] generates. Just Just for the hell of it.
[01:42:50] Just for the hell of it. Uh
[01:42:53] Mystic Ah, see if he has anything you
[01:42:55] might want to buy. He goes He goes, "You
[01:42:56] know what? I don't have uh a ton. I do
[01:42:58] have a I do have a luck
[01:43:00] charm. Um I do have
[01:43:04] um uh some rata
[01:43:08] away. Um I do also have
[01:43:13] um some ammo for the assault rifle.
[01:43:18] And then on top of that um I have some
[01:43:20] like I mean we found one of these. I
[01:43:23] don't even know what these things are.
[01:43:26] We've had some whiskey and then uh a
[01:43:29] couple code discs were traded to me a
[01:43:31] little while back. I don't know what
[01:43:32] those are, but figure I take them. I
[01:43:34] found them.
[01:43:44] All
[01:43:52] right. Let's see.
[01:43:59] You like those? Oh, all right. So,
[01:44:01] you're going to take um
[01:44:03] the You would like to take the code
[01:44:05] disc? Oh, okay. He goes, "All right,
[01:44:06] code disc. Uh, yeah, sure. Um, I don't
[01:44:09] know, like 20 Pogs. What do you say?
[01:44:29] think you notice a friend all of a
[01:44:30] sudden go over and you I don't know see
[01:44:32] in a window and he's maybe he's sitting
[01:44:33] in the corner. You're not really sure
[01:44:34] but on the bar on the other side
[01:44:37] road sits
[01:44:39] um Mystic
[01:44:43] drinking his whiskey.
[01:44:49] Sure. All right. 20 days.
[01:44:53] All right. So, you're down to 202 Pogs
[01:44:56] and you now get
[01:45:00] seven
[01:45:02] code. Anything else you'd like?
[01:45:07] What do you think,
[01:45:10] Mystic? In the corner
[01:45:12] drinking. Is that
[01:45:17] acceptable? They call home strida to the
[01:45:21] go
[01:45:22] to time to go to the bar. All right.
[01:45:48] All right, let's see what you see when
[01:45:50] you wander in. You go to the bar, you do
[01:45:52] see uh in the corner when you walk in,
[01:45:54] you see an old friend
[01:45:57] there. But uh you look and you see over
[01:46:00] and ah, you know, maybe I need a
[01:46:04] drink and um here we go. We're going to
[01:46:09] go
[01:46:10] with we're going to go with that one.
[01:46:21] We're going to go with that one. There
[01:46:23] we go. And you turn to You see them
[01:46:26] standing in the corner. Then you turn to
[01:46:27] your right looking to grab yourself
[01:46:29] maybe a some type of beer or whiskey, an
[01:46:34] ale of some
[01:46:35] kind, and you turn and you find the uh
[01:46:38] barkeep there. Now, come on.
[01:46:44] Stop. Close the door.
[01:46:47] All right.
[01:46:53] And you see the barkeeper.
[01:46:59] You asked the
[01:47:02] barkeeper what
[01:47:10] you asked the barkeeper what
[01:47:13] Well, that was an intriguing one. What
[01:47:15] do you think about the barkeeper?
[01:47:17] [Laughter]
[01:47:20] Missy goes, I'll be right back. Give me
[01:47:21] uh give me give me two minutes.
[01:47:26] You want to make you some coffee?
[01:47:29] [Laughter]
[01:47:31] Um, yeah, I'll take another one. Uh, she
[01:47:34] looks at you like, "Yeah, we we we smash
[01:47:36] all kinds of uh wasteland uh uh
[01:47:39] creatures around
[01:47:42] here. Big BK is hanging out there and
[01:47:45] uh goes up to the bar, goes, "Hey, how's
[01:47:49] it going?" And all of a sudden you hear
[01:47:50] a
[01:47:52] ding and he looks down like, "Don't
[01:47:54] worry about that.
[01:47:56] Nothing to pay attention to there.
[01:48:01] [Music]
[01:48:03] [Laughter]
[01:48:08] is just a small
[01:48:09] [Laughter]
[01:48:11] problem. All right. So, you got your uh
[01:48:13] you've got your barkeep there now. Your
[01:48:17] barkeep. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Yeah. I
[01:48:19] get it. I get it. I get the same jokes
[01:48:21] from
[01:48:22] everyone. I know. You should see the
[01:48:24] third leg. You can't see underneath.
[01:48:28] Uh oh.
[01:48:31] Huh?
[01:48:35] Ah, good questions. Big BK goes, I have
[01:48:38] been hearing about this vault thing
[01:48:39] around. She goes, "You know what? I hear
[01:48:42] people coming in here all the time
[01:48:43] talking about that."
[01:48:45] Now,
[01:48:56] how much
[01:49:15] All right. You ask. Yes. I've been
[01:49:18] hearing about some things those uh some
[01:49:20] rumaging about a vault around every now
[01:49:21] and again. I don't always know what
[01:49:23] where it is or what it is, but we we
[01:49:25] keep uh hearing stuff about it. Somebody
[01:49:27] told me the other day had something to
[01:49:28] do with I don't know uh uh something
[01:49:31] around the corner there. And they said
[01:49:33] it was near the mountain. Um something
[01:49:35] about like a potentially like a a
[01:49:38] cave-in somewhere that was further back.
[01:49:42] um like really far away. Hold on. Let me
[01:49:46] take that. Thank you, buddy. I
[01:49:47] appreciate it a lot. Welcome. Mommy,
[01:49:50] help me.
[01:50:06] All right, let's try that. I don't like
[01:50:07] that one. She says there's there was
[01:50:09] something about a cave or something that
[01:50:10] somebody seen in the distance.
[01:50:15] I was going to say the same thing.
[01:50:21] Get daddy a map is what you say. All
[01:50:24] right. You know what? I think I can um I
[01:50:26] can draw a little bit of what they've
[01:50:27] been talking
[01:50:28] about. But um you know what? Instead of
[01:50:31] drawing it, how about I just I'll point
[01:50:32] I'll point you to where it
[01:50:34] is. And um she stands. She goes, "Come
[01:50:39] here. Come here over with. Come with me.
[01:50:40] come follow
[01:50:45] me. And uh she turns, starts walking
[01:50:53] out, go back outside, and she points in
[01:50:56] the distance. Oh, I'mma follow
[01:51:01] you. All
[01:51:03] right. And in the distance, she points
[01:51:05] out this thing over here. She goes,
[01:51:06] "That over there is where I keep hearing
[01:51:08] everybody come from and talking about
[01:51:15] shut the AC off."
[01:51:21] All righty.
[01:51:24] This is that scene in the
[01:51:26] distance. And she points it out. Says,
[01:51:29] "Over at that mountain, they keep
[01:51:31] talking about something right at the
[01:51:32] edge of the mountain there. Rather than
[01:51:34] a map, I can just point you the way." I
[01:51:36] figure
[01:51:44] now.
[01:51:48] Well, it is
[01:51:50] uh hold on a second. Hold on a second.
[01:51:54] Let's do this. Let's see if I can do
[01:51:56] this.
[01:52:12] Hold on. Here you go. Just so you are
[01:52:14] aware, she walks back in. Mystic's in
[01:52:18] the
[01:52:19] corner making comments. She looks over
[01:52:21] at Miss like, "Buddy, I'm going to cut
[01:52:24] you off
[01:52:25] soon. You understand
[01:52:29] that? You're staying on top.
[01:52:33] Hold.
[01:52:39] And just so you're aware, this is what
[01:52:42] um the barkeep had been talking
[01:52:45] about for the
[01:52:48] leg. All right.
[01:53:07] Just uh just so you're aware, this is
[01:53:08] what the
[01:53:11] barkeep has for their um their third
[01:53:14] leg. All right.
[01:53:21] Shoot. Oh, come on.
[01:53:28] Hold on. That moved my whole screen
[01:53:30] somehow.
[01:53:35] The the third leg threw everyone off. I
[01:53:38] guess even the
[01:53:47] computer was also disturbed by it. I
[01:53:50] guess didn't like didn't like what it
[01:53:52] saw. Ah. Oh, there you go.
[01:53:58] Say yes. Whatever you say, ma'am.
[01:54:05] All right.
[01:54:09] You look like Hunter
[01:54:10] [Laughter]
[01:54:17] Biden. Oh [Â __Â ] That got me. That got
[01:54:21] me. Mystic. I don't
[01:54:24] Nothing.
[01:54:29] Oh, damn. That was good. That was good.
[01:54:33] Thank you. I appreciate it. That was a
[01:54:36] quality quality comment right
[01:54:39] [Laughter]
[01:54:41] there. Well, that barkeeper there pulls
[01:54:44] out the shotgun like no was there. Point
[01:54:46] out the mountain, goes, "All right. Hey,
[01:54:48] Big. I think you're good. You have any
[01:54:50] more questions? You want to pick
[01:54:51] anything up?"
[01:54:53] Next thing you ask for though, you have
[01:54:54] to pay for
[01:54:58] it. Barkeep says and she keep it keep
[01:55:01] it, you know, something I'll give you,
[01:55:03] not something you
[01:55:09] want. All righty.
[01:55:17] Ah, you're pretty good and healed. All
[01:55:18] right. Well, you know what? You know
[01:55:20] where we are. She says, "If you need to
[01:55:22] come back, get a rest, let us
[01:55:25] know. We can uh we have a back rooms
[01:55:28] that can uh be used for some uh sleeping
[01:55:33] arrangements." And there are also some
[01:55:39] uh Oh, that's not what I meant to do.
[01:55:49] That's not what I want to
[01:56:05] do. All
[01:56:25] right, let's
[01:56:26] see. Oh, well, yeah, maybe. You know,
[01:56:30] every now and again you you need need to
[01:56:31] rest, recuperate,
[01:56:34] um get some uh get your health back, you
[01:56:36] know, that type of
[01:56:39] thing. Well, that is really
[01:56:45] interesting. Screw it. This is the one
[01:56:47] I'm
[01:56:50] using. Blonde or
[01:56:53] brunette? Big BK, give me an answer
[01:56:56] there.
[01:57:03] Well, there's only two. Those are the
[01:57:05] only options that I got for
[01:57:07] you. One or the
[01:57:11] other. All right, let's do it.
[01:57:14] Upscale. I'm going to get in trouble and
[01:57:16] kicked off offline at some point,
[01:57:18] probably. So, this is going to be the
[01:57:20] last one that I make when it comes to
[01:57:22] the
[01:57:24] bartenders that wander around giving out
[01:57:29] drinks. All
[01:57:40] right, let's see. You're wandering
[01:57:42] around the bar and uh the bartender
[01:57:45] points over and goes, "Yeah, over there
[01:57:46] the stairs. You can uh you guys can you
[01:57:49] can take a rest. The the ladies will
[01:57:52] help fi help you find
[01:57:53] um help you find your room if you need
[01:58:03] it. H this is what happens when you type
[01:58:05] in like bartender or whatever and some
[01:58:08] of them I guess they have this as the
[01:58:09] image
[01:58:12] idea. So they're wandering around
[01:58:14] handing drinks
[01:58:16] out. The audacity. You have a
[01:58:19] mission. Go. Well, you know, it's uh $50
[01:58:21] for the night. You get a room. I mean 50
[01:58:23] bucks for the night. You get a room. Get
[01:58:25] the rest up there. The lady will show
[01:58:26] you up there how to get there. They'll
[01:58:28] show you where the room
[01:58:32] is. So you look over the bartender with
[01:58:35] her shotgun. Are you going to head out?
[01:58:37] You staying around? What are you doing,
[01:58:39] my friend?
[01:58:41] She's looking at you, big
[01:58:45] BK. Wondering what your next move is,
[01:58:48] big guy. Big
[01:58:50] BK. Oh, you've got to go. He goes, you
[01:58:53] know, you look at her and go, if I
[01:58:55] didn't have a
[01:58:57] quest, and I did not need to save the
[01:58:59] wasteland, I would be
[01:59:01] staying.
[01:59:02] But I have a mission. I must leave.
[01:59:07] Big BK turns around, wanders out,
[01:59:11] staring at the mountain in the distance.
[01:59:17] Now, our buddy,
[01:59:21] um, hold on. I thought I had,
[01:59:25] um, I thought I had an image from
[01:59:27] Mystic.
[01:59:44] Maybe we didn't. Maybe it was just a
[01:59:48] weapon. Maybe it was the just the dragon
[01:59:50] gat weapon we made for you. Maybe that's
[01:59:53] what it was. The dragon gat. You show
[01:59:55] them the
[01:59:57] weapon. Yes, you had the dragon ball
[01:59:59] gat. You show them your uh your dragon
[02:00:02] your dragon sack fire gat that you
[02:00:09] got and
[02:00:12] uh
[02:00:15] those barkeeps wandering around go,
[02:00:18] "Ooh, nice fire sack."
[02:00:23] barkeep looks at him goes, "Seriously,
[02:00:30] ladies and both wander out in the
[02:00:34] distance and head
[02:00:36] towards that
[02:00:38] mountain." Now, my friends, I do have to
[02:00:41] say though, I am sorry. I do have to
[02:00:44] head out today. But what we're going to
[02:00:46] do, we're going to go right over to a
[02:00:47] friend here, say hi to them. I have to
[02:00:49] go probably I have to move our boat, do
[02:00:51] some uh do some other stuff here. So,
[02:00:53] they're going to say bye. We will see
[02:00:55] you guys
[02:00:56] tomorrow. Uh the barkeep waves to you in
[02:00:59] the distance going, "Sorry, we'll miss
[02:01:02] you. I'm I'm We're sad you didn't stay."
[02:01:05] Ladies and Beck goes, "Bye, guys." Need
[02:01:07] a better voice for that one. There you
[02:01:10] go. Has you have one? Make sure you
[02:01:12] like, subscribe, make sure you save our
[02:01:13] shows for more ones. Have a great one,
[02:01:15] everyone. Thank you all. Peace out.
[02:01:17] Bye. Might be some scissors in the
[02:01:19] future.

[00:23:23] this will be a fun one oh oh this is one
[00:23:25] of the other thing I want to do today I
[00:23:26] got some deliveries
[00:23:29] okay I don't even know what I got in
[00:23:30] here I can't remember so I'm going to
[00:23:32] open it up and we're going to see what
[00:23:33] we got I can't remember what it
[00:23:39] is I don't generally have luck so I
[00:23:42] can't remember what I
[00:23:49] got oh some art cards there nice thank
[00:23:53] you Frank I'm I'm opening them off
[00:23:55] screen I'm not even paying attention
[00:23:57] pick something up from my buddy Frank I
[00:23:59] don't have luck that's why I don't
[00:24:01] generally have anything that I buy I
[00:24:04] only have like my wife will buy stuff or
[00:24:05] something for me so let's see what we
[00:24:07] got out of this
[00:24:08] one tournament bundle if you read what's
[00:24:11] in there what it is it's five packs of
[00:24:13] um bloomo the reason why we're doing
[00:24:15] that is I was trying to get a tournament
[00:24:16] together uh that I wanted to do and what
[00:24:19] I was going to do is we were going to
[00:24:19] rip that five packs open for you so
[00:24:21] everybody sees what you got and that way
[00:24:23] you can't play and cheat and then what
[00:24:25] we're going to do is you build your pack
[00:24:26] deck deck um that you play with and then
[00:24:29] we were going to play uh one of the
[00:24:30] coming weekends now I was trying to do
[00:24:32] it like like recently but it seems like
[00:24:34] no one wanted to do it so I left it in
[00:24:36] there I might actually end up taking
[00:24:37] that out though hey happy how you doing
[00:24:40] so this is what we got in our pack there
[00:24:42] not the biggest of hits right there when
[00:24:43] we got that but let's see what else we
[00:24:44] got
[00:24:46] here yeah that would be awesome that
[00:24:48] would be pretty sweet if we get people
[00:24:50] to buy into that but you know maybe one
[00:24:52] of these days we have more people sorry
[00:24:54] see your Mentor moving blast we'll get a
[00:24:56] little uh we'll get better on that we'll
[00:24:58] have more people that want to jump in
[00:24:59] and do those so I think that would be a
[00:25:01] pretty fun time it's like the nice thing
[00:25:03] is it's not I like doing it where you
[00:25:04] are
[00:25:06] um you have to go with what you have you
[00:25:08] know you can I'll give you some time to
[00:25:10] build it but it's what you were what you
[00:25:12] pulled out of the box kind of like a
[00:25:14] free relases almost thing because I
[00:25:15] always like doing pre-release a lot
[00:25:17] personally I think that's one of my
[00:25:19] favorite ways of
[00:25:22] playing no don't worry about it hey
[00:25:25] we've always been in different positions
[00:25:26] I'm not worried about that at all have
[00:25:28] fun fun we have we all have fun
[00:25:30] here all right so that being said we
[00:25:34] have a couple more here left we have all

[00:26:36] certain cards from Outlaws of Thunder
[00:26:38] Junction and I didn't get a ton of them
[00:26:40] and she kind of I think she was upset

[00:26:43] mermaids and there were or she calls
[00:26:45] them mermaids
[00:26:47] merfolk there were some
[00:26:49] merfolk and uh some other cards that she
[00:26:52] wanted that we didn't end up getting
[00:26:53] because we only opened up like one box
[00:26:55] of it we didn't get a chance to open up
[00:26:57] a lot of them she didn't even get a

[01:14:30] teacher um for a little while before I
[01:14:32] went on to um do it
[01:14:36] stuff and the only reason I stopped
[01:14:38] teaching was I was I actually um was out
[01:14:41] of school and I wasn't able to stay
[01:14:44] because the couple kids got expelled but
[01:14:47] in that process of those kids getting
[01:14:48] expelled I was like they wouldn't keep
[01:14:51] me on they didn't want to keep me on
[01:14:55] because they didn't have enough money to
[01:14:56] pay for me so I didn't keep going but in
[01:14:58] the process that I spent that whole year
[01:15:00] though um at the school and I was like I
[01:15:02] don't know if I like that like what they
[01:15:03] do in the politics and stuff and make
[01:15:05] people

[01:52:08] can't combine things because the last
[01:52:09] time I combined things they actually
[01:52:11] suspended me for a week when somebody
[01:52:13] goes hey can I combine this and this
[01:52:14] like yeah sure why not like it's all
[01:52:16] written out so I combined it and then

[01:52:45] that was in the combo I'm like they are
[01:52:47] listed they're listed as an individual's
[01:52:49] things because they aren't to combine
[01:52:50] normally somebody asked to combine them
[01:52:53] and they didn't care about it so yeah
[01:52:55] maybe it is they're trying to do the
[01:52:56] dick around yeah that's what their
[01:52:58] reasoning was and they ended up changing

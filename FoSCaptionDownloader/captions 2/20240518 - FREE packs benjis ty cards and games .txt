[00:18:48] you can bid up to what you want there
[00:18:50] I'm going to start it quickly at this to
[00:18:52] give me a little bit of time to finish
[00:18:53] packing things up for our
[00:18:56] buddy here and then you get the pick
[00:18:59] what you want if you want to participate

[00:19:08] to show I'm GNA say any $7 packs any
[00:19:12] three $7 packs right now pick any three
[00:19:14] of the $7 packs and those will go
[00:19:18] together um for

[00:19:23] packs and put them together for $19 and
[00:19:25] I'm just going to get these things
[00:19:26] packed up here and then I will pull
[00:19:28] stuff out for you for different type of
[00:19:32] deals and it is your choice on what

[00:19:38] for you but you can pick which ones you
[00:19:41] want then we do our little carnival game
[00:19:43] there and you see what happens maybe
[00:19:44] there's another pack that goes out for a
[00:19:46] dollar it's pretty good there and then
[00:19:48] hey we keep going and whoever wins the
[00:19:49] giveaway we had the P first person that
[00:19:52] left when they won the giveaway so we
[00:19:53] couldn't roll through as quick as normal
[00:19:56] but you know hey that happens right
[00:20:22] I have a a not so fun boss
[00:20:25] now I think he chopped on at 7: a.m. to
[00:20:28] make sure I was online and I'm like dude
[00:20:30] you need to check on at 4:00 a.m.
[00:20:31] sometimes and maybe even 6:00 a.m. 5:30
[00:20:34] a.m. because that's generally when I
[00:20:35] start
[00:20:36] working I take a break for a little
[00:20:38] while because I was told that was okay
[00:20:41] so uh by every person I've ever talked
[00:20:43] to in the company and for some reason
[00:20:45] he's got some hair across his ass right
[00:20:48] now intriguingly though I've talked I uh
[00:20:51] asked my director about how to handle
[00:20:53] him in February because I was already
[00:20:55] having a problem and then I also have
[00:20:57] another problem that occurred again so I
[00:20:59] had to talk to him more so there's some
[00:21:01] intriguing things occurring right now
[00:21:02] and he thinks he's I think he thinks
[00:21:03] he's winning right now because I'm not
[00:21:05] really doing anything arguing back
[00:21:07] anymore I'm just capturing everything
[00:21:09] and sending it over to the person that
[00:21:10] told me to send it over to
[00:21:17] him kind of funny anyways let see that's

[00:24:23] some reason it's weird how like computer
[00:24:26] and apple can see things but um window
[00:24:30] but Android can't well I know it's not
[00:24:32] weird actually because they don't um
[00:24:35] they don't actually put effort in
[00:24:36] developing
[00:24:37] for Windows I mean for um for uh Android
[00:24:42] I think they just poured it over using
[00:24:44] some type of program the way it works
[00:24:47] hey Quantum thank you everybody coming
[00:24:49] in hanging out now what are you guys
[00:24:50] looking for this morning that I can help

[01:27:06] check-ins we are
[01:27:10] at 75 oh oh we're close I might have to
[01:27:14] adjust my check-ins because it doesn't
[01:27:16] seem as many people were coming in as I
[01:27:17] thought had been in before so I might
[01:27:20] have to adjust my check-ins here might
[01:27:22] have to adjust my check-ins I might just
[01:27:23] throw out a card anyways for you guys

[01:27:28] everything you said I like
[01:27:31] it do
[01:27:38] two one
[01:27:41] two shuffle my shoe three four through
[01:27:44] I'm
[01:27:45] sorry let buckle my shoe one two buck my
[01:27:49] shoe sorry I'm a oh I'm so old oh my God
[01:27:53] I'm so old
[01:27:55] [Music]
[01:27:56] and I'm not even that old I just make
[01:27:58] myself feel old every time I say things
[01:27:59] like
[01:28:03] that yeah I got to 200 I think on Monday
[01:28:06] but you had pretty much long stream then
[01:28:08] yeah I think I need to adjust it because
[01:28:10] I had more stuff than I was doing like
[01:28:11] giveaways on and a lot of times more
[01:28:13] people will come in and hang out but not
[01:28:15] no one was doing the check-in it was
[01:28:17] weird I had like 30 people in here but
[01:28:18] no not as many people are checking in so
[01:28:20] if the 30 people had all checked in it's
[01:28:23] within five minutes if they all checked
[01:28:25] in within that within 20 minutes we
[01:28:28] would have hit our goal so that's why
[01:28:30] I'm like ah
[01:28:32] interesting all right here we go my
[01:28:34] friend we are going
[01:28:39] to run this for you did it not run it

[01:28:47] again all right let's get it to run
[01:28:49] again
[01:28:59] God damn it sometimes that thing runs
[01:29:01] and it doesn't say it
[01:29:04] runs like it kcks me off sometimes like
[01:29:07] it looks like it's it's been having some
[01:29:08] glitching here it's weird I've been
[01:29:11] having some glitching yeah I think I
[01:29:12] mean to adjust it because well the thing
[01:29:14] is we have a good chance of uh of
[01:29:16] getting it it's just no one no one jumps
[01:29:19] in hey Josh how you doing

[00:32:02] three other boxes those P packs when
[00:32:05] they get pulled out because we call
[00:32:08] those
[00:32:10] darts what happens is we line those
[00:32:13] darts

[00:32:17] of their
[00:32:20] respected
[00:32:22] box there is the son the father or the B

[01:27:16] forever and if anybody you know what if
[01:27:18] anybody else wants to try their luck I'm
[01:27:21] going to do something right now I'm
[01:27:22] going to throw
[01:27:24] the mystery packs on now the mystery
[01:27:27] packs are normally 17 I'm going to run
[01:27:30] up for
[01:27:31] 15 but what is in the mystery packs I
[01:27:33] actually have Wilds ofv drain sets are
[01:27:36] in
[01:27:37] there Wilds drain
[01:27:39] draft ion draft fire xia all will be one
[01:27:44] draft Lord of the Rings draft uh Set uh
[01:27:48] fire exra all one set not draft March
[01:27:51] the machine
[01:27:52] set modern horiz Isen 2 set and draft
[01:27:58] Brothers War set dominar remastered set
[01:28:01] Then There are a handful of Doctor
[01:28:05] Who Brothers war and dominer remastered
[01:28:09] collector boosters in there too and
[01:28:12] whenever you do this and you jump in and
[01:28:14] you play and you get your mystery packs
[01:28:16] here your three mystery packs what we do
[01:28:17] is we pull them
[01:28:19] out we line them up in front of the the
[01:28:24] box that is
[01:28:26] associated
[01:28:29] with we line them up in front of one of
[01:28:31] the boxes
[01:28:32] here and what happens is each one of
[01:28:34] those becomes a dart and we line those
[01:28:37] darts up that get pulled out and we flip
[01:28:40] them over and we see you get a Brothers
[01:28:43] Wars set oop that one fell midnight hunt
[01:28:46] draft and oh a wow set we don't have
[01:28:49] midnight hunt draft so that wouldn't be
[01:28:51] in there it would be a different thing
[01:28:52] but my point is we crack these packs
[01:28:53] open which everyone has the highest mono
[01:28:55] value one is the one that hits a target
[01:28:57] maybe you get yourself like a free pack
[01:28:58] an extra pack maybe it's just a card or
[01:29:02] maybe it's a card you want to be using I
[01:29:03] don't know but I'll run that again now
[01:29:05] that I finally got the explanation with
[01:29:07] pulling everything out I'm going to run
[01:29:09] that again $5 for three packs you always
[01:29:12] walk away with the three packs it's just
[01:29:15] whether or not you get an extra pack a
[01:29:19] card or a card you might want to use to
[01:29:22] play with
[01:29:28] maybe you pull out maybe you're one of
[01:29:30] the one lucky enough to pull out the uh
[01:29:33] collector boosters that are in
[01:29:35] there cuz if you do you can get I mean
[01:29:39] you can pull out three four collector
[01:29:42] boosters if you're really really really
[01:29:45] lucky between pulling out of the mystery
[01:29:49] box and then getting the high and
[01:29:50] pulling it out of the buyer
[01:29:54] maybe you want to try your luck but you
[01:29:55] get definitely always get three packs of
[01:29:57] cards and we just flip them over they

[01:39:43] one that was a good one
[01:39:48] George have some fun
[01:39:51] [Laughter]
[01:39:56] I like that one that was a good one that
[01:39:59] was a good one
[01:40:09] [Music]
[01:40:14] nice if you want to try your luck on
[01:40:17] multiple I can throw just let me know
[01:40:19] George if you're ever like hey you know
[01:40:20] what I want to do like three two or
[01:40:22] whatever like say say you like like hey
[01:40:23] I want to do three of them anytime
[01:40:25] somebody wants to do like three or more
[01:40:26] I can try to do a deal a little bit cuz
[01:40:29] uh like can I can do a little bit of a
[01:40:31] deal sometimes I might be able to take a
[01:40:33] dollar or two off type thing I I I make
[01:40:35] my stuff pretty low priced in the first
[01:40:38] place based on like all the fees and
[01:40:41] everything but if you do multiple it
[01:40:43] allows me to take a little bit off
[01:40:45] because it the fees are less when you
[01:40:47] get multiple things as one purchase so
[01:40:50] just if you ever want to do that anyone
[01:40:52] let me know and I can always do that as
[01:40:54] like an auction to do like a buy now
[01:41:02] thing like an onscreen deal you know
[01:41:05] yeah no problem George I was just
[01:41:07] thinking about it CU like you grabbed a
[01:41:09] couple of them and I was like you know
[01:41:10] what next time if you want to grab a few
[01:41:11] of them just like hey dude I want to
[01:41:13] grab three I want to grab four let me
[01:41:15] try my luck and I'll and I'll see what I
[01:41:17] can do for a deal for you I don't mind
[01:41:19] it's it's because like whatnot takes out
[01:41:22] per the 's a per transaction fee so
[01:41:26] that's why the when you do one at a time
[01:41:28] it's more where I can take a little bit
[01:41:30] off when we do uh when you do multiple
[01:41:33] things in one transaction just kind of
[01:41:35] helps you and helps so that you're not
[01:41:37] paying that fee and that because you
[01:41:39] don't pay the because well it helps so
[01:41:41] that I don't have to pay the fee and
[01:41:43] because of that I transfer that savings
[01:41:44] to you guys kind of
[01:41:55] I I try to be nice as best I can hey
[01:42:00] ptd how are we all doing this

[02:04:50] made about 10 bucks yeah I going to say
[02:04:52] yeah I was thinking five or $10 you made
[02:04:55] more than the box so that's what I was
[02:04:56] telling everybody whenever you buy the
[02:04:58] boxes the bundles I mean you always seem
[02:05:01] to make more than the bundle so I it's
[02:05:04] the same or more it's hard it's hard not
[02:05:06] to go and go and grab a bundle that's
[02:05:08] why whenever I go to the store I'm like
[02:05:10] bundle bundle

[02:05:31] for somebody at the store and I might be
[02:05:33] buying the bundle from someone that was
[02:05:35] my only concern CU I was like am I

[03:14:57] the yeah it's there I mean there's
[03:15:00] different things that make them harder
[03:15:02] but they're a lot easier to deal with
[03:15:03] than
[03:15:06] girls yeah my wife wanted one girl but I
[03:15:09] was like we're having two and that's it
[03:15:11] if it happens to be two girls I sucks

[04:12:39] hanging out in here wants to do some of
[04:12:41] the Lord of the Rings and The doctor or
[04:12:44] maybe somebody wants to try out a

[04:12:59] Lord of the Rings and six of the Exelon
[04:13:03] we'll call that
[04:13:06] $12 instead of

[04:13:13] that you want to do that
[04:13:18] next um we'll do we'll do this
[04:13:36] uh uh
[04:13:43] streamer

[04:14:02] [Music]
[04:14:05] fun let's do
[04:14:09] that let's do that
[04:14:13] we're going to do a mixing match and
[04:14:15] we're going to do six Lord of the Rings
[04:14:18] and six lost caverns of exelan for
[04:14:21] 14 so that would
[04:14:24] be two of the normal ones and two of the
[04:14:26] normal ones from there a m small how you
[04:14:29] doing nice to see you coming in and
[04:14:31] hanging out thank you Philly fan for

[04:14:38] you for within the margins said maybe
[04:14:40] doing a mix and match of uh of of
[04:14:43] pulling out from the pull boxes so I
[04:14:45] decided I'd do one mix and match right
[04:14:47] now is two pull uh six Lord of the Ring
[04:14:50] polls and six ion PS for 14 instead of
[04:14:57] 16 not a bad
[04:14:59] deal I mean they were supposed to be 12
[04:15:02] instead of 14 12 instead of 14 my math
[04:15:04] was
[04:15:06] horrible wow that was just so bad on my
[04:15:09] math
[04:15:11] there that was supposed be 12 not
[04:15:16] 14 oh let me fix that I hate that you
[04:15:21] can't you live on here apparently M you
[04:15:25] know what I kind of do two between

[04:15:45] 12 that was supposed to say
[04:15:49] 12 12 six Lord of the Rings and six
[04:15:55] Exelon that gives you normally would be
[04:15:59] 14 that's where my math was I don't know
[04:16:01] where I got 16
[04:16:03] from math is horrible sometimes it's so
[04:16:07] hard brain hurts brain
[04:16:11] hurts let's try our luck we pulled out

[04:28:33] and
[04:28:37] match well that did not go as planned
[04:28:46] pull box mix a match there we
[04:28:50] go
[04:28:53] Justified all right let me get that
[04:28:55] figured out here next and F straighten
[04:28:57] that out I corrected that I wish I could
[04:29:00] cancel these like be like no this is not
[04:29:02] what I wanted it was incorrect let me
[04:29:04] cancel
[04:29:05] it I mean mistakes are made I mean if
[04:29:08] you're doing it on a regular basis yeah
[04:29:09] I can see why somebody would get upset
[04:29:11] but what I'm going to do now is I'm
[04:29:13] actually going to put the pull box deal
[04:29:14] on that I was talking about it's going

[04:29:18] get 30 PS instead of 15 and you're going
[04:29:22] to get six PS from Lord of the Rings
[04:29:25] instead of three and that's going to be
[04:29:27] $16 instead of
[04:29:30] 20 because the Wilds of our drain is so
[04:29:34] low in their size there
[04:29:42] there we
[04:29:43] go six Lord of the Rings and then you're
[04:29:46] going to get 30 Wilds of Al drain here

### Playing Minions

1. **Summoning Minions**:
   - **Casting Minions**: To cast a minion, you must meet its mana cost and elemental threshold. Mana is provided by the sites you control, and each site contributes to your available mana pool and elemental resources.
   - **Placing Minions**: Minions can be summoned onto any site you control. This includes sites where your avatar is present or other controlled sites on the battlefield.

2. **Meeting Requirements**:
   - **Mana Cost**: Each minion card has a specified mana cost that you must pay using the mana provided by your controlled sites.
   - **Elemental Threshold**: Some minions require a certain number of specific elemental types to be played, which are also provided by your sites.

3. **Deploying Minions**:
   - **Location**: Once the cost is paid, place the minion on a site you control. The minion will enter the battlefield and can immediately be utilized according to its abilities and attributes.

### Playing Avatars

1. **Starting with Avatars**:
   - **Initial Placement**: Each player starts the game with their avatar already in play, typically positioned in the middle location of their side of the grid.
   - **Roles of Avatars**: Avatars are central to the player's strategy, providing leadership, abilities, and representing the player's life total.

2. **Using Avatars**:
   - **Abilities**: Avatars can use their abilities to influence the battlefield, cast spells, and interact with other cards.
   - **Movement and Actions**: Avatars can move across the grid, engage in combat, and perform various actions as dictated by their abilities and the game rules.

### General Rules and Considerations

1. **Summoning Sickness**: Newly summoned minions typically suffer from summoning sickness, meaning they cannot attack or use certain abilities until the next turn. However, they can defend if necessary【34†source】【37†source】【38†source】.

2. **Control and Occupation**: Minions and avatars can only be placed on sites you control. You cannot summon minions to unoccupied or enemy-controlled sites.

3. **Combat and Interaction**: Once on the field, minions and avatars can interact with each other, engage in combat, use special abilities, and influence the game's outcome through strategic actions and placement.

### Resources for Further Details

2. **Elemental Threshold**:
   - This is also found near the mana cost and represents the number and types of elemental resources required. Each symbol corresponds to a specific element (Fire, Earth, Water, Wind). You need to have these elements available from your controlled sites to play the card.

3. **Type Line**:
   - This line is usually located beneath the card name and specifies whether the card is a minion, avatar, relic, etc. It helps identify the nature and function of the card within the game.

4. **Abilities and Effects**:
   - The text box in the middle of the card describes the card's abilities and any special effects it may have when played or while on the field. This can include summoning sickness, special attacks, defensive capabilities, and other unique properties.

5. **Flavor Text (Optional)**:
   - Some cards include flavor text, which provides thematic or story-related information. This text is not functional but adds to the game's lore.

### Example Breakdown

Here’s an example of how a typical minion card might be structured:

- **Name**: "Flamecaller"
- **Mana Cost**: 3 (indicated by a number in a circle)
- **Elemental Threshold**: 1 Fire (indicated by a fire symbol)

when sites are played is their ability/action immediately active?

[2024-05-26 10:01:11] ChatGPT:
In **Sorcery: Contested Realm**, the abilities or actions of sites are generally immediately active once the site is played. This means that the benefits provided by a site, such as mana generation or special abilities, can be utilized right after the site is placed on the field.

### Key Points on Site Abilities

1. **Immediate Activation**:
   - Sites become active immediately upon being played. This allows players to start using the site’s abilities right away, influencing their strategy and actions for that turn and beyond【34†source】【35†source】【36†source】.

2. **Mana Generation**:
   - Sites contribute to your available mana pool as soon as they are played. This mana can be used to cast spells, summon minions, and activate abilities during your turn【38†source】.

3. **Special Abilities**:
   - Any special abilities or effects provided by the site are also immediately available. For example, if a site grants a specific bonus or allows a particular action, these can be utilized from the moment the site is placed on the battlefield【34†source】【35†source】.

### Example

- **Example Site Card**: "Ancient Ruins"
  - **Mana Contribution**: Provides 1 Earth mana.
  - **Special Ability**: "When played, draw a card."

If you have site with a flood does it take up 2 boxes?

[2024-05-26 10:04:06] ChatGPT:
In **Sorcery: Contested Realm**, specific mechanics and interactions are associated with sites that have special conditions such as flooding. When a site is flooded, it typically indicates an area covered by water, which can impact how it is used and what it can contain.

### Site Occupation and Flooding

1. **Single Box Occupation**:
   - A site with a flood condition typically still occupies only one box on the grid. The flood condition affects how the site interacts with other elements in the game, such as which minions can be placed there or what effects are active.

2. **Impact of Flooding**:
   - **Water Minions**: Flooded sites are often more advantageous for water-based minions and spells. They may provide bonuses or allow specific actions that are not possible on non-flooded sites.
   - **Movement and Abilities**: Certain abilities and movements might be restricted or enhanced depending on the presence of water on the site.

3. **Flooded Site Abilities**:
   - **Immediate Activation**: As with other sites, the abilities of a flooded site become active immediately once the site is played. This means any special rules associated with the flood condition take effect right away【34†source】【35†source】【37†source】.

### Example Scenario

- **Flooded Site Card**: "Swamped Village"
  - **Description**: A site that is considered flooded.
  - **Mana Contribution**: Provides 1 Water mana.
  - **Special Ability**: "Water minions gain +1 attack when on this site."
  - **Effect**: The "Swamped Village" occupies one box on the grid. Its flood condition allows water minions placed on this site to gain a bonus, and it provides water mana immediately upon being played.

### Key Considerations

- **Grid Occupation**: Sites, including those with special conditions like flooding, occupy a single box on the grid.
- **Advantages**: Flooded sites provide unique strategic advantages that can be leveraged depending on the composition of your deck and the overall strategy.

Can it be adjacent to another land that is not flooded of your own?

[2024-05-26 10:06:40] ChatGPT:
Yes, in **Sorcery: Contested Realm**, a site with a flood condition can be adjacent to another land site that is not flooded. The adjacency of sites on the grid does not depend on their individual conditions (such as being flooded or not). The key aspect is that you control the sites, and they are positioned next to each other on the grid.

### Key Points

1. **Site Adjacency**:
   - Sites can be placed adjacent to one another regardless of their specific conditions. This means a flooded site can be next to a non-flooded site as long as you control both sites.

2. **Control and Interaction**:
   - Controlling multiple adjacent sites can provide strategic advantages, such as mana generation and the ability to utilize site-specific abilities. The conditions of the sites (flooded or not) affect only the interactions and abilities within those individual sites.

3. **Strategic Placement**:
   - Placing a flooded site next to a non-flooded site allows you to take advantage of different site conditions strategically. For example, you could benefit from water-based bonuses on the flooded site while using the non-flooded site for other strategic advantages.

### Example Scenario

- **Example Setup**:
  - **Flooded Site**: "Swamped Village" (provides 1 Water mana, water minions gain +1 attack)
  - **Non-Flooded Site**: "Mountain Fortress" (provides 1 Earth mana, grants defense bonuses to minions)
  - These two sites can be placed adjacent to each other on the grid, allowing you to benefit from both water and earth resources and their respective abilities.

explain a site saying "once on your turn, you may flood an adjacent site this turn."

[2024-05-26 10:07:25] ChatGPT:
In **Sorcery: Contested Realm**, when a site has the ability "once on your turn, you may flood an adjacent site this turn," it means that during your turn, you have the option to apply a flood condition to a site that is directly next to the one with this ability. Here's a detailed explanation:

### Understanding the Ability

1. **Frequency**:
   - The phrase "once on your turn" indicates that this action can be performed only one time during each of your turns. It cannot be repeated multiple times within the same turn.

2. **Action Description**:
   - "You may flood an adjacent site this turn" means you can choose one site that is directly next to (adjacent to) the site with this ability and apply the flood condition to it. This flood condition will affect the adjacent site for the duration of the turn.

3. **Adjacent Sites**:
   - Adjacent sites are those that share a common border with the site that has this ability. These can be to the north, south, east, or west of the originating site.

### Strategic Implications

1. **Temporary Effect**:
   - The flood condition applied by this ability is temporary, lasting only for the duration of your turn. This means any benefits or disadvantages associated with flooding will only be relevant during that turn.

2. **Usage Scenarios**:
   - **Enhancing Water Minions**: If you have water-based minions or spells that gain bonuses on flooded sites, you can use this ability to temporarily enhance an adjacent site, thereby boosting your minions or spells.
   - **Disrupting Opponents**: Flooding an adjacent site might interfere with your opponent's strategy, especially if their minions or spells are less effective on flooded sites.

3. **Combination with Other Abilities**:
   - This ability can be combined with other site or card abilities to create powerful combos. For example, you might flood a site and then use another card that has increased effectiveness on flooded sites.

### Example

- **Example Site Card**: "Waterfall Basin"
  - **Ability**: "Once on your turn, you may flood an adjacent site this turn."
  - **Effect**: During your turn, you can choose one site next to "Waterfall Basin" and flood it. This could temporarily turn a normal land site into a flooded site, providing various strategic advantages.

### Resources for Further Details

For a comprehensive understanding of how site abilities work and specific examples, you can refer to the [official rulebook](https://sorcerytcg.com/how-to-play) and the [FAQ section](https://www.gamenerdz.com/sorcery-contested-realm-faq)【34†source】【35†source】【37†source】.

   - Once a site is placed on the board, it becomes active immediately, and its abilities or effects are available for use. This includes generating mana, providing elemental thresholds, and any special abilities the site may have.

2. **Subsequent Actions**:
   - You can perform actions on the site in later turns. This includes playing spells, summoning minions, or utilizing any special abilities the site might have.
   - For example, if a site has an ability that can be activated each turn, you can use that ability during your turn as long as the site remains under your control.

3. **Strategic Use**:
   - The ability to perform actions on sites after they are placed allows for strategic planning. You can position your sites to maximize their benefits and use them to support your ongoing strategy throughout the game.

### Example Scenario

- **Example Site Card**: "Mystic Grove"
  - **Mana Contribution**: Provides 1 Earth mana.

Do flooded lands affect tower lands and those minions on them?

[2024-05-26 10:15:22] ChatGPT:
In **Sorcery: Contested Realm**, the interaction between flooded lands and tower lands, as well as the minions on them, depends on the specific abilities and conditions outlined on the cards. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how these interactions typically work:

### Flooded Lands and Their Effects

1. **Flooded Lands**:
   - Flooded lands represent areas covered with water. These can provide specific bonuses or limitations depending on the type of minions or spells interacting with them.
   - The primary effect of a flooded land is to enhance water-based minions and spells or to impose restrictions on other types.

### Tower Lands and Minions

1. **Tower Lands**:
   - Tower lands are a specific type of site with defensive or other special attributes. These lands usually provide strategic advantages, such as increased defense for minions or the ability to cast spells with enhanced effects.
   - The abilities and effects of tower lands are detailed on the card itself.

2. **Minions on Tower Lands**:
   - Minions placed on tower lands benefit from the defensive or strategic bonuses provided by the tower. These can include increased attack, defense, or special abilities.

### Interactions Between Flooded and Tower Lands

1. **Direct Effects**:
   - If a tower land becomes flooded, any effects specific to flooding would apply to the tower land and the minions on it. For example, if flooding reduces movement or changes combat dynamics, these changes would affect the tower land and its occupants.
   - The specific effects depend on the game rules and the abilities listed on the cards.

2. **Minion Interactions**:
   - Minions on a flooded tower land would be subject to the flood effects. For example, water-based minions might receive bonuses, while others might face penalties.
   - The exact impact on minions depends on their abilities and how they interact with flooded conditions.

### Example Scenario

- **Tower Land Card**: "Watchtower of the Abyss"
  - **Description**: A defensive site that provides bonuses to minions placed on it.
  - **Special Ability**: "Minions on this site gain +2 defense."
  - **Flood Interaction**: If "Watchtower of the Abyss" is flooded, water-based minions might gain additional bonuses, while non-water-based minions might have reduced effectiveness or movement.

### Conclusion

The interaction between flooded lands and tower lands, as well as the minions on them, is governed by the specific rules and abilities outlined on the respective cards. Generally, flooding impacts the dynamics of the game by enhancing water-related abilities and potentially imposing restrictions on others.

do you add the mana and elemental cost to case a card?

[2024-05-26 10:19:55] ChatGPT:
In **Sorcery: Contested Realm**, casting a card involves both the mana cost and the elemental threshold requirements. Here’s a detailed explanation of how these costs work:

### Mana Cost and Elemental Threshold

1. **Mana Cost**:
   - Each card has a mana cost indicated on it. This is the amount of mana you need to pay to play the card. Mana is generated by the sites you control on the board.
   - The mana cost is typically shown as a number in the top-left corner of the card.

2. **Elemental Threshold**:
   - The elemental threshold specifies the types and amounts of elemental resources required to cast the card. These elements (Fire, Earth, Water, Wind) are also provided by the sites you control.
   - The elemental threshold is represented by specific elemental symbols on the card.

### Combining Costs to Cast a Card

To cast a card, you must meet both the mana cost and the elemental threshold requirements. Here’s how it works in practice:

1. **Generate Mana**:
   - During your turn, you use the mana generated by the sites you control. Each site contributes a certain amount of mana to your available pool.

2. **Meet Elemental Threshold**:
   - In addition to having enough mana, you must also have the specific elements available. For example, if a card requires two Fire elements, you must control sites that collectively provide at least two Fire elements.

### Example

- **Example Card**: "Flamecaller"
  - **Mana Cost**: 3
  - **Elemental Threshold**: 1 Fire
  - **Description**: A minion that deals damage to an enemy minion when summoned.
  - **Requirements to Cast**:
    - You need 3 mana from your available pool.
    - You need at least 1 Fire element from your controlled sites.

If you control a "Volcanic Ridge" site that provides 1 Fire element and 1 mana, and a "Burning Plains" site that provides 2 mana and 1 Fire element, you can use these to cast "Flamecaller" as you have enough mana (3) and the required Fire element (1).

### Strategic Considerations

1. **Site Management**:
   - Managing your sites effectively is crucial to ensuring you have the right combination of mana and elemental resources to cast your cards.
   - Strategic placement of sites can maximize your ability to meet various card requirements.

2. **Deck Building**:
   - When building your deck, consider the elemental thresholds of your cards to ensure you include enough sites that provide the necessary elements.

---

### Summary:
1. **Mana Cost**: Pay the mana required to cast the card from your available mana pool.
2. **Elemental Threshold**: Ensure you have the specific elements needed as provided by your controlled sites.
3. **Combined Costs**: Both the mana cost and elemental threshold must be met to cast a card.

Can the drown card be played against spire Lich

[2024-05-26 10:27:46] ChatGPT:
The **Drown** card in **Sorcery: Contested Realm** can generally be played against any minion, including the **Spire Lich**, as long as the card's conditions are met. Here’s how it works:

### Understanding the Drown Card

1. **Card Effect**:
   - **Drown** is typically a spell card that targets minions on the battlefield, potentially removing them by submerging them in water. The exact effect can vary based on the specific version or edition of the card.
   - A common effect might be: "Target minion on a land site becomes submerged. If it is not a water-based minion, it is destroyed."

2. **Targeting Minions**:
   - The Drown card can target minions that are not specifically immune to its effects. Since the Spire Lich is an undead minion and not inherently immune to being submerged or destroyed by water-based effects, it can be targeted by Drown.
   - If the Spire Lich is on a Tower land or any other site, and there are no specific protections or immunities mentioned on the Spire Lich or the Tower land that would prevent it from being affected by water-based spells, Drown can be played against it.

### Example Scenario

- **Scenario**:
  - You have the Drown card in hand.
  - Your opponent has a Spire Lich on the battlefield, possibly on a Tower land.
  - You play Drown, targeting the Spire Lich.
  - If the conditions of Drown are met (e.g., the Spire Lich is on a site that can be flooded and is not protected from water-based effects), the Spire Lich will be affected according to the spell's effect, which typically means it will be submerged or destroyed.

### Strategic Considerations

- **Use of Drown**:
  - Playing Drown against powerful minions like the Spire Lich can be a strategic move to remove a significant threat from the battlefield.
  - Ensure there are no protections or specific conditions that would prevent Drown from taking effect.

For precise card interactions and detailed rules, refer to the [official rulebook](https://sorcerytcg.com/how-to-play) and the [FAQ section](https://www.gamenerdz.com/sorcery-contested-realm-faq)【34†source】【35†source】【37†source】.

### Summary:
1. **Drown Card Effect**: Targets and potentially destroys minions by submerging them.
2. **Targeting Spire Lich**: Drown can target the Spire Lich unless it has specific protections.
3. **Strategic Use**: Utilize Drown to remove significant threats like the Spire Lich from the battlefield.

[2024-05-26 10:41:22] ChatGPT:
In **Sorcery: Contested Realm**, the card **Tide Naiads** is a minion card that interacts specifically with flooded sites. Here are the key details about the Tide Naiads and how they enter and interact with the game:

### Tide Naiads Details

1. **Type**: Minion - Spirit
2. **Elemental Threshold**: Typically involves water elements.
3. **Ability**: The Tide Naiads have an ability called "Submerge," which indicates that when they enter the battlefield, the site they are placed on becomes flooded, turning it into a water site.

### Placement and Activation

- **Site Requirement**: Tide Naiads do not necessarily need to be placed on a pre-existing flooded site when they enter the game. Instead, their ability can flood the site they are placed on, converting it into a water site.
- **Immediate Effect**: The flooding effect of the Tide Naiads is immediate upon their placement. This means that as soon as they enter the game, the site they occupy becomes flooded, and any benefits or restrictions associated with a flooded site come into play.

### Strategic Use

- **Enhancing Abilities**: Utilizing the Tide Naiads' ability to flood sites can be strategically beneficial if you have other water-based cards or minions that gain bonuses from flooded sites.
- **Disrupting Opponents**: Flooding a site can also disrupt your opponent's strategy, especially if their minions or spells are less effective on water sites.

### Example Scenario

- **Playing Tide Naiads**: When you play Tide Naiads, choose a site you control. Upon placing them on this site, the site becomes flooded. This can enhance the effectiveness of other water minions you control or disrupt enemy minions that are less effective in water conditions.

For further details on specific interactions and strategic uses, you can refer to resources such as the [official rulebook](https://sorcerytcg.com/how-to-play) and [TCGplayer](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/523020/sorcery-contested-realm-beta-tide-naiads)【78†source】【79†source】【80†source】【81†source】.

[2024-05-26 11:14:14] ChatGPT:
In **Sorcery: Contested Realm**, the **Thunderstorm** card is a powerful spell that can impact the battlefield by dealing damage to units. Here’s a detailed explanation of how it works and how it can be used strategically:

### Thunderstorm Card Overview

1. **Type**: Spell (Aura)
2. **Elemental Threshold**: Typically associated with Air (Wind) elements.
3. **Mana Cost**: The specific amount of mana required to cast the spell is indicated on the card.
4. **Effect**: Thunderstorm deals damage to units on affected sites.

### Key Mechanics

1. **Effect Activation**:
   - **Primary Effect**: At the end of your turn, Thunderstorm deals a specified amount of damage (e.g., 3 damage) to a random unit atop the affected sites. This damage can affect both your units and your opponent’s units.
   - **Movement**: After dealing damage, you may move Thunderstorm one step. This allows you to reposition the spell's area of effect strategically for the next turn.

2. **Placing on Sites**:
   - You can place Thunderstorm on any site, including your opponent’s sites. This means you can target specific areas of the battlefield where your opponent has concentrated their forces.
   - Once placed, the spell affects all units on the targeted sites, dealing damage at the end of each turn.

### Strategic Use

1. **Board Control**:
   - **Clearing Units**: Use Thunderstorm to clear out weaker units or soften stronger units across multiple sites. This can disrupt your opponent’s strategy by reducing their available minions.
   - **Area Denial**: By moving Thunderstorm, you can control which areas of the battlefield are affected, making it difficult for your opponent to maintain a stable board presence.

2. **Combining with Other Cards**:
   - **Synergies**: Combine Thunderstorm with cards that either benefit from or are immune to the damage it deals. For example, use it alongside units with high health or regeneration abilities that can withstand the repeated damage.

3. **Disruption**:
   - **Target Opponent’s Sites**: Placing Thunderstorm on your opponent’s key sites can force them to reposition their units or suffer continuous damage, thereby disrupting their game plan.

### Example Scenario

- **Scenario**: Your opponent has several low-health minions clustered on a site. You cast Thunderstorm on that site.

Where can spells be cast

[2024-05-26 11:25:55] ChatGPT:
In **Sorcery: Contested Realm**, the rules for casting spells are straightforward but have specific guidelines regarding where spells can be cast:

### Casting Spells

1. **Spell Targeting**:
   - Spells in Sorcery can target various elements on the battlefield, including minions, sites, and other entities. Each spell has specific targeting rules that must be adhered to, as outlined on the card itself.

2. **Placement and Control**:
   - Spells can typically be cast on sites you control or on entities you control. Some spells might have specific rules allowing them to target sites or minions controlled by your opponent.
   - For example, area-of-effect spells like **Thunderstorm** can impact multiple sites or minions, but the exact placement depends on the card's description and the current game rules.

3. **Elemental and Mana Requirements**:
   - Each spell has a mana cost and elemental threshold that must be met to cast it. This requires you to have control over enough sites that provide the necessary mana and elemental resources.

4. **Aura Spells**:
   - Auras are a type of spell that remains in play after being cast, often providing ongoing effects or enhancements to sites or minions. These must be placed according to their specific rules, often at intersections or certain positions on the grid【119†source】【120†source】【121†source】.

### Example Scenario

- **Direct Damage Spell**: A spell like **Fireball** might allow you to target an enemy minion directly, requiring you to specify the target and meet the mana and elemental costs.
- **Area Effect Spell**: **Thunderstorm** can be placed to affect multiple sites, dealing damage to units on those sites. You would move this spell strategically each turn to maximize its effect.

### Additional Resources

For a comprehensive understanding of spell casting and targeting, refer to the [official rulebook](https://sorcerytcg.com/how-to-play) and community FAQs available on sites like [Game Nerdz](https://www.gamenerdz.com/sorcery-contested-realm-faq).

### Summary:
1. **Targeting**: Spells target minions, sites, and other entities as specified on the card.
2. **Control**: Typically, spells are cast on sites or entities you control, but some can target opponent's assets.
3. **Requirements**: Must meet mana and elemental thresholds.
4. **Aura Spells**: Provide ongoing effects and are placed according to specific rules.

Where can minions be placed four spirits

[2024-05-26 11:26:28] ChatGPT:
In **Sorcery: Contested Realm**, minions, including spirits, are generally placed on sites you control. Here are the key points for placing spirit minions:

### Placing Spirit Minions

1. **Controlled Sites**:
   - You can summon spirit minions to any site that you control. Control over a site typically means you have established that site with your resources and it is under your domain.

2. **Specific Abilities**:
   - Some spirit minions may have specific abilities that allow them to interact with different types of sites in unique ways. For example, a spirit minion with a "Voidwalk" ability can be summoned into and navigate safely on void spaces that do not have an existing site occupying them【127†source】【128†source】.

3. **General Summoning Rules**:
   - Similar to other minions, spirit minions must adhere to the game's general summoning rules, which require you to meet the mana cost and elemental threshold associated with the minion card. Once these conditions are met, you can place the spirit minion on a site you control【129†source】.

### Example Scenario

- **Spirit Minion with Special Ability**: If a spirit minion card has an ability like "Voidwalk," you could place it on any void space, giving you flexibility in its placement beyond your controlled sites.
- **Basic Spirit Minion**: For a regular spirit minion without special abilities, you would place it on any site you have established control over, using the mana and elemental resources generated by your controlled sites.

For more detailed rules and interactions, refer to the [official rulebook](https://sorcerytcg.com/how-to-play) and community resources such as the [Sorcery Contested Realm FAQ](https://www.gamenerdz.com/sorcery-contested-realm-faq).

---

### Summary:
1. **Controlled Sites**: Place spirit minions on sites you control.
2. **Special Abilities**: Abilities like "Voidwalk" allow placement on specific types of sites.
3. **Summoning Requirements**: Meet mana and elemental thresholds to summon spirit minions.

**Iterate, Improve, Evolve**: Consider strategic placements of spirit minions based on their abilities and the sites you control.
**Question**: Do you need specific examples of spirit minion cards and their abilities?
**Validate**: Ensure no recent updates have changed the rules for placing spirit minions.

[2024-05-26 11:37:12] FoSGamers:
When a site says game won this turn. Does it mean only the turn? It is placed down or every turn that it is only meeting that criteria.

[2024-05-26 11:37:33] ChatGPT:
In **Sorcery: Contested Realm**, when a site card states "game won this turn," it means that the condition specified on the card must be met within the current turn for the game to be won. This condition does not automatically apply to every turn after the site is placed down. Instead, the condition must be met during the specific turn in which you are attempting to win the game.

### Key Points

1. **Turn-Specific Condition**:
   - The phrase "game won this turn" indicates that the win condition must be achieved during the turn it is being attempted. This means that if the criteria are met in a future turn, you must meet the conditions again during that turn to claim victory.

2. **Strategic Implications**:
   - This rule requires careful planning and execution to ensure that all necessary conditions are met within the same turn. It emphasizes the importance of timing and strategy in achieving victory.

3. **Clarification**:
   - For example, if the condition involves controlling a specific number of sites or having a certain combination of elements, those conditions must be fulfilled in the turn you are aiming to win. If you fail to meet the condition in that turn, you must try again in a subsequent turn when you meet the criteria.

For further details and specific examples of how these conditions apply, you can refer to the [official rulebook](https://sorcerytcg.com/how-to-play) and community FAQs available on sites like [Game Nerdz](https://www.gamenerdz.com/sorcery-contested-realm-faq).

### Summary:
1. **Turn-Specific**: The win condition "game won this turn" applies only to the turn in which you attempt to meet the criteria.
2. **Strategic Timing**: Conditions must be met within the same turn for the win to be valid.
3. **Future Attempts**: If not achieved in the current turn, the condition must be met again in future turns to claim victory.

This ensures that achieving victory requires strategic planning and precise execution during your turn.

[2024-05-26 11:38:02] FoSGamers:
When a site says gain one this turn. Does it mean only the turn It is placed down or every turn that it is only meeting that criteria?

[2024-05-26 11:38:25] ChatGPT:
In **Sorcery: Contested Realm**, when a site card has an ability that states "gain one [resource] this turn," it generally means that the benefit is available during the turn it is activated, and this activation can occur each turn as long as the conditions are met.

### How It Works

1. **Turn Activation**:
   - The phrase "gain one [resource] this turn" indicates that the effect is applicable each turn during which the criteria are met. This isn't limited to just the turn the site is placed down. Instead, it can be activated on subsequent turns as well, provided the site continues to meet the necessary conditions.

2. **Recurring Benefit**:
   - For example, if a site states "gain one mana this turn," you can activate this ability during each of your turns to gain that mana, provided you meet any specific conditions required by the site (e.g., having control over certain other types of sites or elements).

### Example Scenario

- **Example Site**: A site with the text "Once on your turn, if you control another water site, gain one water mana this turn."
  - **Turn 1**: You place the site on the board. Since you control another water site, you gain one water mana this turn.
  - **Turn 2**: On your next turn, if you still control the required water site, you can gain one water mana again.

### Strategic Considerations

- **Continuous Activation**: Utilize sites with recurring benefits strategically by ensuring the conditions for activation are consistently met. This allows you to maximize resource generation over multiple turns.
- **Planning**: Plan your site placements and control to continually activate these benefits, providing a steady flow of resources to support your strategy.

For detailed rules and examples, refer to the [official rulebook](https://sorcerytcg.com/how-to-play) and the [Sorcery Contested Realm FAQ](https://www.gamenerdz.com/sorcery-contested-realm-faq).

### Summary
1. **Turn Activation**: The "gain one this turn" benefit can be activated each turn, not just the turn the site is placed.
2. **Recurring Benefit**: Ensure conditions are met each turn to consistently gain the resource.
3. **Strategic Use**: Plan site placements to maintain continuous activation of these benefits.

**Iterate, Improve, Evolve**: Explore how to leverage continuous resource generation in your deck strategy.
**Question**: Do you need specific strategies for maintaining site control to maximize resource generation?
**Validate**: Ensure there are no recent rule updates affecting these interactions.

What does charge mean?

[2024-05-26 11:39:50] ChatGPT:
In **Sorcery: Contested Realm**, the keyword **"Charge"** refers to a special ability that allows a minion to move and attack in the same turn it is summoned. This ability bypasses the typical restriction known as "summoning sickness," which usually prevents minions from attacking or performing certain actions on the turn they are played.

### Key Points about "Charge"

1. **Immediate Action**:
   - A minion with the **Charge** ability can be summoned and immediately move and attack during the same turn. This provides a significant tactical advantage by allowing swift offensive actions right after summoning.

2. **Strategic Use**:
   - Using Charge minions can help you quickly apply pressure on your opponent by attacking vulnerable targets or positioning your minions advantageously on the battlefield.
   - This ability is particularly useful for disrupting your opponent's plans or quickly responding to threats.

3. **Game Balance**:
   - Charge minions often have balanced stats to compensate for their powerful ability, ensuring they are not overly dominant in the game.

### Example Scenario

- **Example Minion with Charge**: If you summon a minion with the Charge ability, such as a "Charging Knight," you can immediately move it across the battlefield and attack an enemy minion or site during the same turn it enters play. This immediate action can catch your opponent off guard and potentially turn the tide of battle.

For further details and specific examples of Charge minions, you can refer to the [official Sorcery: Contested Realm rulebook](https://sorcerytcg.com/how-to-play) and community FAQs available on sites like [Game Nerdz](https://www.gamenerdz.com/sorcery-contested-realm-faq) and [TCGplayer](https://www.tcgplayer.com).

### Summary

1. **Immediate Action**: Charge allows minions to move and attack in the same turn they are summoned.
2. **Strategic Advantage**: Provides tactical benefits for applying pressure and responding to threats.
3. **Balance**: Charge minions are balanced with appropriate stats.

By leveraging the Charge ability, you can effectively enhance your tactical flexibility and offensive capabilities in Sorcery: Contested Realm.

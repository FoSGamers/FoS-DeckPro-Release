[00:29:18] 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22

[00:29:47] take a step towards this one but it was
[00:29:48] 24 25 26 27 28 29 29 was our uh our foil
[00:29:56] there H close
[00:29:58] now remember everybody we do have some
[00:29:59] sorcery available I'll end up having
[00:30:01] more uh and with uh do like the idea of
[00:30:05] the aoran Legends so we'll see what
[00:30:06] happens with

[00:30:11] here and we will see what the next
[00:30:14] person is here now remember everybody
[00:30:16] that does the check-ins we end up doing
[00:30:18] that thing there and we see if one of
[00:30:19] you guys end up Hing us pull out the
[00:30:21] card that is the the one that we do our

[00:30:58] bit to some double
[00:31:01] Masters going back in time to some
[00:31:03] double Masters here now the reason why
[00:31:05] we CH changed the enance to an enhance
[00:31:07] giveaway is because we kept giving away
[00:31:09] a bunch of cards and they would be
[00:31:10] singles and they would be sometimes
[00:31:11] worths St because the way that I did it
[00:31:13] in the pull box but I decided instead we
[00:31:15] should give something away that people
[00:31:16] would maybe want more like a pack so
[00:31:18] that's why we're doing it this way now

[01:16:07] continue with here and why not we uh I
[01:16:11] don't know we don't have too much we got
[01:16:12] going on here today because it's a day
[01:16:14] another day that I don't have everything
[01:16:17] um and I'm probably not going to get it
[01:16:18] in till next week because um I probably
[01:16:22] just need to cancel that shipping of uh
[01:16:24] the way I did it shipping because no pay
[01:16:26] paying overnight shipping the way I did
[01:16:28] it trying to get it here so it was going
[01:16:30] to be here today that way I could have
[01:16:32] my bloomo for today but it looks like uh
[01:16:36] that's not going to happen so I'm
[01:16:38] probably gon to have it on Monday at the
[01:16:40] earliest if I'm lucky we'll find out
[01:16:44] though it's frustrating I try to do
[01:16:47] things so I can get it here early for
[01:16:49] you guys or even for make sure you know
[01:16:51] the store has stuff to do
[01:16:55] no my stuff got late and then I bought
[01:16:57] it from the regular people that I get it
[01:16:58] from but um I had I at requested I had
[01:17:01] done overnight but they just uh they
[01:17:03] must have missed that for the shipping
[01:17:04] to ship it out yesterday so it's it
[01:17:06] doesn't look like I shipped out that's
[01:17:07] all I'm not going to they were very nice
[01:17:10] and held it for me when they didn't need
[01:17:11] to so I can't complain at all it just
[01:17:14] just you know disappointing that's all
[01:17:17] let me see if I can get uh the wheel up
[01:17:19] though to see who gets to play next here
[01:17:22] cuz I don't know why I'll probably have
[01:17:24] a slower day in a slower day like this
[01:17:25] today don't have much going on I'll
[01:17:27] probably end up jumping off early and
[01:17:28] just hanging out with the family know
[01:17:30] might as well take some family time with

[01:45:12] investigate it
[01:45:20] further sure we investigate further all
[01:45:24] right feel a weird presence coming from
[01:45:27] it as you go towards
[01:45:33] it odd presence on this item as you go
[01:45:36] towards
[01:45:42] it where is the picture
[01:46:01] all right they feel a nice presence from
[01:46:03] there and you go over towards it and
[01:46:06] you're worried though while picking it
[01:46:09] up but you do anyways you go and you
[01:46:13] grab it you touch that Relic that you
[01:46:16] find in the ground after you open up
[01:46:17] that open up the uh box there your
[01:46:21] case have a sword of the ready all right
[01:46:23] I have a sort ready I like
[01:46:25] it so you see that there and all of a
[01:46:28] sudden oh that is not good luck this is
[01:46:31] uh we don't have some good luck right
[01:46:32] now
[01:46:35] because we need to now get rid of this
[01:46:37] luck this is I think you touched this
[01:46:38] and now you've got a curse on you oh
[01:46:43] no you have to use that map you have and
[01:46:47] maybe find somewhere to get rid of it
[01:46:49] think we need to continue around this
[01:46:50] island and hopefully run into someplace
[01:46:53] to get rid of that
[01:46:57] curse you don't have any luck there my
[01:46:59] friend
[01:47:01] Oblivion you've been cursed by some bad
[01:47:03] luck on this
[01:47:05] totem yeah why not Relic totem same
[01:47:14] difference here we go what do you would
[01:47:16] like to do you want to
[01:47:18] uh take it you touched it already and
[01:47:21] have bad luck so you probably would on
[01:47:23] to take it and see if you can get it
[01:47:24] back somewhere to get your luck
[01:47:29] back oh maybe the area with clean water
[01:47:31] could have some Magic Properties so you
[01:47:34] decide oh no I think you need to go back
[01:47:35] you think you I'm going to try to head
[01:47:37] back to that other area where we had
[01:47:38] those uh that water there that pool of
[01:47:41] water but you know what on your way
[01:47:47] back you run into something
[01:47:58] where did the
[01:48:03] go you notice there is a
[01:48:07] uh
[01:48:09] little Citadel looking thing off to your
[01:48:12] right when you're going towards it and
[01:48:15] what you see is a tomb mysterious
[01:48:17] ancient tomb so you go towards it with
[01:48:20] your Relic
[01:48:24] there's an altar there what do you think
[01:48:26] you should do maybe go over to the altar
[01:48:28] what would you like to do my
[01:48:31] friend we're not really sure this is an
[01:48:33] intriguing
[01:48:35] scenario we can go to the altar we can
[01:48:38] walk away we can I don't
[01:48:40] know place it on the altar
[01:48:43] oh I like it that's a good idea that's a
[01:48:47] good idea so you
[01:48:50] go over to that altar
[01:48:56] and you place your Relic on the
[01:49:00] Altar and all of a sudden something
[01:49:02] weird starts to happen you feel a
[01:49:05] buzzing you feel some awkward
[01:49:07] movements the ground rumbles a little
[01:49:10] bit and your Relic
[01:49:16] transforms and your luck that was bad
[01:49:19] has gone away
[01:49:20] now and
[01:49:23] you now have a special Relic which will
[01:49:26] give you a health increase your health
[01:49:30] completely replacing your health from
[01:49:35] zero on you now have two health potions
[01:49:39] you used to have one you're now down to
[01:49:41] two health potions by following and
[01:49:43] going and doing
[01:49:45] that that was a good idea though putting
[01:49:47] it up there what it did was have
[01:49:51] you converted got rid of your bad luck
[01:49:55] and brought out the good luck from the a
[01:49:57] the totem there you
[01:49:59] go you had to somebody used one somebody
[01:50:03] used one yesterday that's why you only
[01:50:05] have uh that's why you don't have any
[01:50:06] left that's why you only had one you're
[01:50:09] at 139 Health

[02:04:32] then so it' be you I'd play against you
[02:04:35] depending on what happens hope I'm
[02:04:36] probably going to lose um I'll play
[02:04:38] against house and then I was gonna have
[02:04:40] like a my my idea was depending on how
[02:04:43] quick the games go we'll do like a two
[02:04:46] hours where um like there's four
[02:04:49] different people and we'll do kind of
[02:04:50] like a little bit of a tournament thing
[02:04:52] where the two two people can be playing
[02:04:53] at once against each other um a you know
[02:04:58] and so like kind of like between the
[02:04:59] four of you guys we'll just play like
[02:05:01] the four of us will play different ones
[02:05:03] so uh if you want to do make sure you
[02:05:05] jump in

[02:20:23] fatum needs to give me a number between
[02:20:25] 1 and 45 because I like to give away
[02:20:28] more than just um all right fate I'm GNA
[02:20:31] give you that other one I like to try to
[02:20:32] give away more than just uh like some
[02:20:34] singles that weren't really worth a ton
[02:20:37] every time because I was trying to
[02:20:38] figure out how to do it where we give St
[02:20:39] away and then like give people an
[02:20:40] opportunity to get something fun so I
[02:20:44] decided what we're going to do is the
[02:20:46] enhanced giveaway instead where we do
[02:20:49] one two three four five six 7 1 2 3 4
[02:20:55] five 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
[02:21:01] 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 no
[02:21:08] number 21 you got a stone gaze was the
[02:21:11] car that was pulled out it's an elite
[02:21:13] monsters gaze looming longing from
[02:21:18] afar we would have been oh was number
[02:21:21] two from the back was our backstab that
[02:21:24] time so the point of it is I do these
[02:21:27] frequently to see if anybody has a
[02:21:29] chance to pull out one of the cards
[02:21:31] there and if you happen to pull out the
[02:21:33] foil what we do is you actually now
[02:21:36] instead of just getting singles you get
[02:21:38] a chance of getting something like this
[02:21:40] so as we build up once we hit
[02:21:42] 175 if we hit that we're going to end up
[02:21:45] switching out one of those card packs to
[02:21:46] something different so that you guys get
[02:21:49] an opportunity of pulling something else
[02:21:50] out but we did not get that there where
[02:21:52] we'd like to go my friend
[02:21:59] fatum then I need to take a drink here
[02:22:01] oh William and Nolan you mind come and
[02:22:03] grab me a
[02:22:05] drink thank you very
[02:22:08] much random all right
[02:22:24] one still tell me to stay on that
[02:22:30] side tell me to stay on this side all
[02:22:33] right you mind switching it out thank
[02:22:39] you all right we're going to try those
[02:22:41] two we're g to try those
[02:22:43] two let's see what happens if we have
[02:22:46] any luck with them
[02:23:00] um maybe we might do that a little bit
[02:23:02] more frequently then maybe we were
[02:23:04] trying to do it this way so we because
[02:23:07] if I give out a ton of stuff that way
[02:23:09] I'm G to make a comment I just can't
[02:23:10] afford to give out packs and singles
[02:23:13] right now that's why we're trying to get
[02:23:14] ourselves up to like thousand on YouTube
[02:23:16] because if we get up there then I can
[02:23:18] start getting some of the ad money in
[02:23:19] and that ad money will help pay for the
[02:23:22] other stuff that we can do so I need a
[02:23:24] th and like it's a th and like 4,000
[02:23:27] hours and I'm almost have the I'm
[02:23:28] getting out there with the hours so
[02:23:30] what'll happen is once that starts
[02:23:32] happening I'm going to give I'm going to
[02:23:33] start using that money to do enhance the
[02:23:35] giveaways even
[02:23:37] further yeah no problem so we're g to
[02:23:41] rip these open fight them and we're
[02:23:44] going to see what you get my
[02:23:46] friend good luck
[02:23:52] here we go oh we got to zoom zoom in
[02:23:55] again zoom zoom zoom everybody say way
[02:24:01] oh No actually they're not they take
[02:24:04] they don't actually take that much it's
[02:24:05] just uh it's more time than money but um
[02:24:09] people kept saying about giving away
[02:24:10] more packs and if I give packs away I
[02:24:14] have to if I give two packs away that's
[02:24:18] like 2
[02:24:21] singles so that's why might glimmer Bell

[02:24:57] token so it was hit once
[02:25:00] yesterday um and we had a raid come in
[02:25:04] and then we had another thing so it was
[02:25:05] three times yesterday that we had packs
[02:25:07] given away so that would have been like
[02:25:10] 20 or more singles so that's why I'm
[02:25:14] like we can do packs like that like we
[02:25:17] did yesterday or we can do like single
[02:25:20] Les the way we did doing it this way
[02:25:22] yeah
[02:25:23] so or singles or packs Dron the Stinger

[02:41:51] Rapier and you have this magical sword
[02:41:53] that nobody used that's the
[02:41:55] skimmar and you have a shield then you
[02:41:57] have a shield you've used somewhat
[02:41:59] that's the same as the other one I'd

[02:42:04] shields what does chat think fight

[02:51:29] body your Scarab is now
[02:51:34] unhappy was kind of just wandering
[02:51:36] around not doing anything at first but
[02:51:37] now he's unhappy and he comes glittering
[02:51:39] towards you after you smack him on the
[02:51:41] crack of his back with the sword you do
[02:51:43] take some damage to him at 55 damage
[02:51:45] from 70 but he comes towards you and
[02:51:50] oh we go from 180 down to
[02:51:52] 171 because they come over and they
[02:51:54] pinch you you try to jump away though
[02:51:56] what are you gonna do now
[02:51:59] chat you decided you were an attack now
[02:52:02] he's in the attack mode and that that

[02:52:14] adventure
[02:52:15] game it's up to you H chat should we
[02:52:19] attack again should we run
[02:52:21] away we've already attacked so we only
[02:52:23] have attack or run away is really our
[02:52:25] options I'm pretty sure he's not going
[02:52:27] to become your friend after you hit him
[02:52:28] in the back with the
[02:52:35] [Laughter]
[02:52:37] sword all right I guess we're attacking
[02:52:40] again Hayward says we're going to attack
[02:52:42] and this time I'm going to go after one
[02:52:43] of the uh limbs all right one of the
[02:52:46] limbs oh no
[02:52:49] you went after one of the limbs and you
[02:52:51] missed oh no you
[02:52:54] missed and in that process of missing
[02:52:56] that giant scare bowls you over running
[02:52:59] you to the ground bring you down to 147
[02:53:01] Health that is not
[02:53:04] good what are you g to do you just
[02:53:06] attacked they bow you over the war cry
[02:53:09] of your
[02:53:12] people I like
[02:53:14] it and then we'll see what happens here
[02:53:21] we can continue on are we going to fight
[02:53:22] more are we going to run away you got
[02:53:24] one more chance here to see what happens
[02:53:26] are you going to do a a blow to make
[02:53:28] them
[02:53:32] scared you said number 15 for your Benji
[02:53:35] that's why I'm waiting for that here we
[02:53:37] we finish a game and then Benji happens
[02:53:39] that's
[02:53:41] why check in all right we're going to
[02:53:43] attack one more time I
[02:53:45] think this time we'll go for another
[02:53:47] limb
[02:53:51] so we're attacking going for Li Lim
[02:53:53] again oh my
[02:53:56] God you miss
[02:53:59] again that is not good you miss and this
[02:54:03] time he bowls you over for a second time
[02:54:06] just charging right over you and just
[02:54:07] keeps running though it's like this
[02:54:09] guy's horrible at fighting I got to
[02:54:11] leave this dude alone before I kill him
[02:54:13] he doesn't really care about you just a
[02:54:14] giant scar rolling around but when he
[02:54:16] bows you over he brings you from for 47
[02:54:18] Health down to 121 that was a big hit
[02:54:22] but in the process one two three four

[03:27:13] babies out but you get to continue with
[03:27:15] our adventure game that's kind of the
[03:27:16] fun part because you get to play a game
[03:27:17] for a little while if you're under D and
[03:27:18] D type stuff lumer would be dope lumer
[03:27:22] would be dope so we'll run that there
[03:27:24] again see if anybody likes it hopefully
[03:27:27] you guys are having a good one and you
[03:27:28] do like it there and what I'm going to
[03:27:30] do here is let's
[03:27:33] see maybe um leading lomer for the deck
[03:27:37] ah yeah we got lucky and that was our
[03:27:39] pull out of the box that was my one good
[03:27:41] pull out of the box that we had for um
[03:27:44] the bloom Barrow box that I had opened
[03:27:46] the rest of them were like me you know
[03:27:48] what I mean but
[03:27:51] hey what we're going to do now is we're
[03:27:53] going to do our
[03:27:54] checkins triome is a lot yeah hey if you
[03:27:57] type hey ready if you type something for
[03:27:59] me ready it's very cool to know when you
[03:28:02] hang out here with
[03:28:03] me take this card and on the bottom of
[03:28:07] the card it says ik KO 248 if you type
[03:28:10] in SL price space i space 248 it will
[03:28:16] give you the price also and the reason
[03:28:18] why and that's why I say Iko 248 when
[03:28:21] I'm reading them
[03:28:25] off yeah look at
[03:28:28] that pretty cool is it good morning
[03:28:32] Mahaya oh I see you're back my friend
[03:28:41] Ashley oh the pyate game all right so
[03:28:43] when you play the py you either um so
[03:28:46] you purchase in here and you're going to
[03:28:48] get one of these potentially for one of
[03:28:51] the things that are in there or you get
[03:28:52] the packs that are listed in there but
[03:28:54] either way the Pirate game is just is
[03:28:55] more like you're jumping in to play the
[03:28:56] game the Pirate game the whole point is
[03:28:58] to get through each level because once
[03:29:00] we get through level one the next level
[03:29:03] the characters and creatures are a
[03:29:05] little bit harder more interesting more
[03:29:06] intriguing but the packs and stuff are
[03:29:08] like this so we got like these in here
[03:29:11] for packs instead and it's going to be I
[03:29:14] think $17 to start because that's for
[03:29:17] packs and then our singles are going to
[03:29:20] be added in again with things like these
[03:29:23] and maybe if I'm lucky my uh Bloom
[03:29:26] Barrow will get here and I'll add in
[03:29:28] some bloomo singles in here too but some
[03:29:31] of those things will be added into it
[03:29:32] and that's how our game goes and we
[03:29:34] pretty much we make it so all those are
[03:29:36] end up going to go out through either
[03:29:37] the game or the packs at some
[03:29:42] point that's a problem not a problem at
[03:29:45] all Thomas hey if you ever have any
[03:29:47] questions just ask and be like hey how
[03:29:48] do I do the price check and no problem
[03:29:52] questions see what was it
[03:29:56] uh there's no dumb question only stupid
[03:29:59] people because they don't ask questions
[03:30:01] something along that lines I can't
[03:30:02] remember what it is so asking questions
[03:30:04] is never a problem I mean you got to
[03:30:06] obviously be appropriate but hey
[03:30:10] Tangerine you hanging out here
[03:30:13] Tangerine Hair I ain't poking my mouth
[03:30:16] all right hey Tangerine what did you get

[03:30:25] night borderless there
[03:30:27] pip 385 if you didn't want to check at
[03:30:35] all and that is going to end up being I
[03:30:37] need you to type a uh Slash d45 or give
[03:30:41] me a number between one and 45 if you
[03:30:44] don't mind tangerine

[03:46:34] ton I've only opened a couple boxes but
[03:46:37] there's a lot of it that is some of the
[03:46:38] bulk stuff that we're not going to need
[03:46:40] because we already built some decks and
[03:46:41] stuff with them would you guys like me
[03:46:43] to put those into like a bulk sets of
[03:46:46] stuff that you guys might want to buy
[03:46:47] that way you can do like the fos repacks

[03:46:51] whatever with them I know Arthurian
[03:46:54] Legends is coming out soon too

[04:37:05] so all righty so what we're going to do

[04:37:10] is think we're getting to the end the
[04:37:14] stream so we're going to have some new
[04:37:16] things we're going to do let's see what
[04:37:18] we would like to do
[04:37:20] here it's getting slower and
[04:37:22] lower let's get to that time because
[04:37:24] everybody's getting into work then
[04:37:27] they're have to go to lunch which is
[04:37:29] later on I don't think I'm going to be
[04:37:31] able to stick around much later to the
[04:37:32] lunchtime break
[04:37:35] so let's do something here
[04:37:38] quickly let's zoom out
[04:37:46] let's do something here let's check
[04:37:49] let's check if we have any friends
[04:37:50] around at the
[04:37:54] moment we do we do have a couple we do

[04:38:05] couple ah I see what's going on I see
[04:38:07] what's going
[04:38:08] on all right so
[04:38:13] there's a lot of people on Friday in the
[04:38:14] morning there that's all I just saying
[04:38:15] there's a lot of people on that's why
[04:38:17] there's not a lot of people here because
[04:38:18] there's a lot of them spread out and I
[04:38:19] don't have Bloom bro which hopefully I
[04:38:21] was hoping I was going to get but um I
[04:38:23] got some other things we need to do
[04:38:24] anyways here so with that being said
[04:38:27] we're going to do this
[04:39:08] here we go I think we're going to be
[04:39:10] ending the stream here
[04:39:13] in five minutes
[04:39:16] so somebody wants to jump in and get
[04:39:18] something that happens to be in the um

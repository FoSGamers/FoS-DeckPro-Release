So I'm going to start doing things in regards to testing for our weekly shows. And one other thing I'll do is on Tuesdays, I'm going to call it Testing Tuesday, where I'll test different ideas out for different games, different approaches to new games, new games completely, whatever it is I'm testing things out. And then Wednesday, I'm going to do the same thing where I'll be testing stuff. But I would like you to come up with another name that will kind of rhyme with Wednesday. We have Testing Tuesday, like something for Wednesday to go with that. It could be Wednesday something or something Wednesday. I don't really care. But we want to have something along that lines for doing that type of thing because the point of it is I'll be on those days for testing something out if it works, and I make a lot of money on stay. If it doesn't work, I'm jumping off right away and doing my stuff I need to do, like taking my day off. So pretty much I wake up, get things rolling, and then I jump off right away if it's slow. That's what it boils down to. But I use those as an excuse because I'm testing things out.

For Wednesday, since you already have **"Testing Tuesday"**, you could go with something like:

1. **"Whimsy Wednesday"** – implying a light-hearted, experimental day, where things could be unpredictable and fun, similar to your approach of testing and quickly moving on if things don’t work.
2. **"Wildcard Wednesday"** – emphasizing the unpredictable, trial-and-error nature of testing new ideas or games.
3. **"Workshop Wednesday"** – signaling a more hands-on, crafting/testing approach, similar to a workshop environment for refining ideas.
4. **"Wager Wednesday"** – highlighting the idea of taking a gamble or testing something that could either work out or not.

Each of these options complements the testing aspect and adds a creative touch to your weekly schedule. Let me know if you'd like more suggestions or variations!

So it'll be Testing Tuesday and Wednesday Workshop for those shows. From now on, every Wednesday will be a Wednesday Workshop, where we'll be trying new ideas out, workshopping new ideas with them. Who knows what it could be. It could be anything from ideas of deck building days to it could be a workshop where we are building decks, or it could be game ideas. We could be helping build things, or maybe the same thing on Testing Tuesdays, we'll be testing things out similarly. So that's what we'll have there. I just need to add that to your memory, or add that to your knowledge.

Got it! From now on, **Testing Tuesday** will be focused on trying out new games, approaches, or ideas, and **Wednesday Workshop** will be a more collaborative, hands-on day for developing and refining new ideas. These shows will include a wide range of activities, from deck building to exploring new game concepts, allowing room for creative experimentation.

I'll keep this structure in mind as we move forward and help you maintain consistency with these themes across your content and scheduling. Let me know if you need further adjustments or enhancements to the format!

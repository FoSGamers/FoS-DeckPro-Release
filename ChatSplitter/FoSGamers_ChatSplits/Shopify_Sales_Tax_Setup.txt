Shopify provides a variety of tools to help you manage sales tax collection, but it is ultimately your responsibility as the seller to ensure taxes are charged appropriately.

1. **Sales Tax Settings in Shopify**: Shopify offers an automated sales tax collection feature that calculates and collects taxes for orders based on the customer's location. You can set up tax rates for different regions (countries, states, localities) and Shopify will apply the correct rate when you make a sale.

2. **Shopify's Automated Sales Tax**: Shopify automatically collects taxes for all supported regions where tax rates can be easily determined. Shopify uses the customer's billing address to calculate the correct rate and add sales tax to the order during checkout.

3. **Manual Setup for Tax Collection**: For certain situations (such as special tax jurisdictions or non-standard tax rates), you may need to manually configure tax rates within Shopify.

4. **Sales Tax Collection in Different States**: Shopify can manage sales tax collection across multiple states (if you sell in the U.S.), but it’s essential to know the tax laws of each state. Some states require businesses to collect sales tax regardless of whether they have a physical presence, and in others, it only applies if certain thresholds are met (like volume or sales figures).

5. **Local Taxes**: Shopify also supports local tax rates, so it can automatically apply the right tax even for local sales.

**In conclusion**, Shopify can help automate the collection of sales tax, but it is your responsibility to configure the settings accurately and stay informed about tax regulations for each region where you operate.

Shopify **does not automatically collect or remit sales tax for you** — you are responsible for configuring your sales tax settings properly based on where you have **nexus** (a tax presence such as a location, warehouse, or significant sales activity). Here's how it breaks down:

### 🔧 What You Need to Do on Shopify
1. **Set up your tax settings**:
   - In your Shopify Admin, go to **Settings > Taxes and Duties**.
   - Add the states (or countries) where you have nexus.
   - Shopify will calculate the correct rates for each customer based on their location — **but only for the locations you list**.

2. **Register for sales tax permits** in states where you have nexus. Shopify doesn't do this for you.

3. **Collect and remit taxes**:
   - Shopify will collect the correct tax from your customers at checkout (once set up).
   - But you must file and remit those taxes to the appropriate state/local tax agencies — **Shopify does not do this automatically** unless you use a third-party app like **TaxJar**.

---

### 🧠 Helpful Tip for FoSGamers
Because you're selling across platforms (Shopify, Whatnot, eBay), consider using a tool like **TaxJar**, **Avalara**, or **Quaderno**. These tools:
- Track where you’re approaching nexus thresholds
- Automatically file sales tax returns
- Integrate with Shopify and other platforms

---

If you'd like, I can help you:
- Determine where you likely have nexus
- Set up tax settings in Shopify
- Pick a sales tax automation tool based on your volume and needs

Since your business is based in Florida, here's how you should handle **sales tax registration and collection with Shopify**:

---

### 🔹 **1. Register for Sales Tax in Florida**
You must **register with the Florida Department of Revenue (DOR)** to collect and remit sales tax.

- **Where to register**:  
  [Florida Department of Revenue – Sales Tax Registration](https://floridarevenue.com/taxes/registration/Pages/default.aspx)
  
- **What you’ll get**:  
  A **Florida Sales Tax Certificate (aka Resale Certificate)** — this allows you to legally collect sales tax from customers in Florida.

---

### 🔹 **2. Set Up Florida Sales Tax in Shopify**
Once registered, set up your Florida sales tax collection in Shopify:

1. Go to **Settings > Taxes and duties** in your Shopify admin.
2. Under **United States**, click **Set up** (or **Edit** if already listed).
3. **Add your Florida sales tax permit number.**
4. Shopify will now automatically calculate and collect sales tax on orders shipped to Florida.

---

### 🔹 **3. When You May Need to Register in Other States (Nexus)**
You may **need to register in other states** *if* you trigger **economic nexus** — usually based on:

- **# of transactions** (e.g., 200+ per year in a state), or  
- **$ in sales** (e.g., $100,000+ in a year to that state)

Check each state’s economic nexus laws if your sales grow nationally. Shopify won’t register you automatically — **you must do that manually** in any new state you trigger nexus.

---

### 🔹 **4. File Sales Tax Returns**
- In Florida, you typically file **monthly, quarterly, or annually**, depending on your volume.
- You must **file returns even if no tax was collected** (to stay compliant).
- You can do this via the [Florida DOR e-Services Portal](https://floridarevenue.com/taxes/eservices/Pages/default.aspx).

---

If you'd like, I can help you walk through the Florida DOR registration step-by-step or check what other states you *might* need to keep an eye on for nexus as your sales grow. Want to go deeper into either?

[2025-04-01 17:55:22] FoSGamers:
confirm I sell all over the country and want to be sure I am tax compliant.

Got it — since you're selling **nationwide**, here's what you need to know to stay **100% sales tax compliant** with Shopify and other platforms like Whatnot and eBay.

## ✅ Step-by-Step Tax Compliance Guide for Nationwide Sellers

### 🧭 1. **Understand Where You Have Nexus**
You need to **collect and remit sales tax in states where you have nexus**, which includes:

- **Physical Nexus**: Inventory, office, employee, or presence (likely just Florida for you)
- **Economic Nexus**: Based on total sales or number of transactions in a state  
  - ⚠️ Most states trigger this at **$100,000/year in sales** or **200+ transactions**.

**Tool Tip:** Use [TaxJar](https://www.taxjar.com/) or [Avalara](https://www.avalara.com/) to track where you're close to triggering nexus automatically.

---

### 🧾 2. **Register for Sales Tax Permits**
If you hit a threshold in any state, you **must register for a permit before collecting tax** there. You cannot legally collect sales tax without being registered.

Once registered, Shopify lets you enter your **tax permit number** for each state.

---

### 🛒 3. **Set Up Tax Collection in Shopify**
Shopify will:
- **Auto-calculate and apply the correct sales tax rates** at checkout (state, county, city, etc.) — *but only* in the states you tell it to.

Steps:
1. Go to **Settings > Taxes and Duties**
2. Add all states where you are registered
3. Enter your **sales tax ID number** for each

> 💡 Shopify **does not collect tax** for you in states unless you set them up.

---

### 📦 4. **Other Sales Channels**
You're also using:
- **Whatnot**: They collect/remit taxes for most orders, **but not always for seller-fulfilled ones**
- **eBay**: eBay collects and remits sales tax for all buyer states that require it — you **don’t need to remit** for eBay sales

So your **Shopify store is your main tax responsibility** right now.

---

### 📅 5. **File Sales Tax Returns**
For every state you’re registered in, you must:
- **File returns on time** (monthly, quarterly, or annually)
- **Even if you collected $0 in tax** — filing is still required to stay in good standing

Use the state DOR sites or tools like:
- [TaxJar AutoFile](https://www.taxjar.com/autofile)
- [Avalara Returns](https://www.avalara.com/us/en/products/returns.html)

---

### 🛠 Want Hands-Off Automation?
✅ I strongly recommend you integrate **TaxJar** or **Avalara** with Shopify:
- Tracks where you're approaching nexus
- Automates tax calculations
- AutoFiles returns for you

Let me know if you want help choosing one or setting it up.

---

Would you like:
- A quick **checklist for states where you might already have nexus** based on your current sales?
- Help connecting **TaxJar or Avalara** to your store?
- A **sales tax setup audit** for Shopify?

Happy to help with any of it!

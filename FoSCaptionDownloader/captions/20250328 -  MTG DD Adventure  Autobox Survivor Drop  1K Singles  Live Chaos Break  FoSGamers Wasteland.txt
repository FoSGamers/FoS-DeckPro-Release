[00:02:37] like it might be
[00:02:40] going looks like we might be working
[00:02:42] there why does this always pop up well
[00:02:47] we'll
[00:02:49] see yes let's do it that's what I was
[00:02:52] going to do all right here we go our
[00:02:53] first one going run it
[00:02:56] here now this is the first one here now
[00:02:59] the way we're doing it it tells you a
[00:03:00] little bit next to it what it
[00:03:06] says why are there so many multiple
[00:03:08] quantities in there hold on I got to
[00:03:11] redo that I don't know why there's so
[00:03:13] many quantities of that in
[00:03:18] there give me one second there that's
[00:03:21] [Â __Â ] weird right now give me a
[00:03:23] minute there should be no quantities in
[00:03:25] there I got to read add that in very
[00:03:27] quickly I luckily I saved how that was
[00:03:29] set
[00:03:32] so I can rebuild it very very quickly
[00:03:35] that is
[00:03:36] crazy wow that was so
[00:03:39] weird all
[00:03:43] right that was really really weird there
[00:03:45] it put in like quantities for everything
[00:03:49] and I don't know
[00:03:51] why so let me get that
[00:03:55] corrected so luckily I I save everything
[00:04:00] set them all
[00:04:01] up so that we shouldn't have to worry
[00:04:03] about anything like that there should be
[00:04:05] no I should be able to in put it in
[00:04:07] right now
[00:04:11] again all right there we go looks like
[00:04:13] there's no quantity changes on those
[00:04:17] now wow that was really
[00:04:20] weird that was really really
[00:04:26] weird dude I don't know let me try this
[00:04:28] again don't put put quantities in it did
[00:04:31] it in again there's more
[00:04:35] quantities I 100% did not put
[00:04:38] quantities
[00:04:42] in all right well let's see if this
[00:04:44] works if it doesn't work after the first
[00:04:46] one I might need to do something again
[00:04:47] it might be a bug chase your dreams Jill
[00:04:49] I appreciate that so here we go we're
[00:04:51] going to try the first one here we'll
[00:04:52] run it like we were saying this is uh
[00:04:54] you know we'll start the first one a
[00:04:55] little bit a little bit discounted there
[00:04:57] we're going to start at 10 instead of 12
[00:05:00] and the little randomize there we'll see
[00:05:02] what happens that is just
[00:05:05] weird very
[00:05:07] weird how that is working that
[00:05:11] way I wonder if it's uh actually or
[00:05:14] maybe it's the quantity of the things
[00:05:16] cuz some of them have quantity some of
[00:05:17] them
[00:05:24] don't why does some have quantities and
[00:05:26] others don't that's very odd
[00:05:32] well I've never seen that happen like
[00:05:33] that and it literally says one there
[00:05:37] maybe it's that maybe it's the next to
[00:05:38] it oh oh oh oh oh hold
[00:05:44] on no no no I don't know that's really
[00:05:48] weird so what'd you

[00:13:25] Venton challenge well you have the
[00:13:27] ability you found out the the bench
[00:13:30] there you have some stuff there so what
[00:13:33] you can do is oh that's no the full size
[00:13:51] workbench that's not what I wanted let's
[00:13:53] make that a little bit more let's see if
[00:13:55] that'll work better so you get to uh the
[00:13:58] invention challenges here my my friend
[00:13:59] is you actually have the option to take
[00:14:02] your weapons potentially add something
[00:14:04] to them like uh with your with your
[00:14:06] swords or anything like that or with uh
[00:14:09] your or try to um update some of your
[00:14:13] stuff or take some of your
[00:14:15] uh like say your um your own bag try to
[00:14:18] do it yourself see how it rolls how it
[00:14:20] goes see if you can put it together
[00:14:21] maybe you want to take that bag that you
[00:14:23] just got the leather with try to upgrade
[00:14:25] your
[00:14:26] bag thank you I appreciate your coming
[00:14:29] in here so maybe that's what you'd like
[00:14:31] to do you know you got that leather
[00:14:33] there maybe you want to take that try to
[00:14:33] upgrade your bag maybe you would like to
[00:14:36] uh take some of the metal
[00:14:38] there and ah see the thing is though you
[00:14:41] got to remember now there a challenge
[00:14:43] here you have to see the luck of the
[00:14:47] dice if it's going to roll so we have to
[00:14:49] see what I keep can't remember what you
[00:14:51] have for your Buffs here you've got uh
[00:14:55] intelligence and Engineering okay so
[00:14:57] that's going to give you you have to
[00:14:59] have if you get anything um that is
[00:15:02] higher
[00:15:03] than intelligence and
[00:15:06] engineering and you have luck so that's
[00:15:09] three all right you have to have higher
[00:15:11] than a uh a seven or higher on your D20
[00:15:15] roll to do some successful uh work here
[00:15:19] on your things and well my friend look
[00:15:21] at
[00:15:23] that I I think that was
[00:15:25] successful was that successful good
[00:15:28] morning
[00:15:35] that's a critical upgrade well I'm going
[00:15:36] to say what I'm going to say then is
[00:15:39] that that means that it must have worked
[00:15:41] that pretty much you guarantee that one
[00:15:43] worked so we're going to go and we're
[00:15:44] going to take that leather that you uh
[00:15:47] you uh had
[00:15:49] there nice and you're going to uh
[00:15:53] upgrade your backpack that you'd had
[00:15:55] well you're kind of Lucky on that one
[00:15:57] that was a good one
[00:16:05] where is
[00:16:07] the
[00:16:18] bag oh there it
[00:16:26] is so that goes You know what
[00:16:29] we'll bring you up to
[00:16:31] uh 17 slots from your 12 you added five
[00:16:35] slots in
[00:16:36] there there we
[00:16:39] go 17 I was going to
[00:16:42] say yes there you go I figured critical
[00:16:46] you had to go up a little bit good chunk
[00:16:49] there so you went from 12 to 17 spots
[00:16:51] now well that's pretty sweet my
[00:16:53] friend all right there's our
[00:16:57] uh work
[00:17:07] bch I don't like
[00:17:12] that I don't like that either well we're

[00:34:59] through that uh
[00:35:04] Wasteland all right there we
[00:35:07] go try
[00:35:08] that that's your scrap metal that's what
[00:35:12] you end up bumping into and finding
[00:35:21] some put that over here
[00:35:28] I got to make like another I don't know
[00:35:31] what I need to
[00:35:34] do we're going to do some organization
[00:35:41] quickly we're going to do
[00:35:49] this that's what we're going to do
[00:36:09] we're doing this I'm putting this stuff
[00:36:10] over here making it in a
[00:36:13] folder so I can easily
[00:36:16] see what it goes with
[00:36:20] it now I don't have everything all
[00:36:22] jumbled in like one location pressing
[00:36:24] the button a million times trying to
[00:36:25] find out where I am
[00:36:33] we'll get the scrap metal away
[00:36:37] though what's shiny in that nothing it's
[00:36:40] just the all that is the is the sun glit
[00:36:43] off of it that's all the sun the sun in
[00:36:45] the background you see that's kind of
[00:36:46] like the sun in the background it's
[00:36:47] letting you know well look at that you
[00:36:49] happen to find We rise and shine you
[00:36:50] know you haveen to find some uh some
[00:36:53] metal there that's what's shining in the
[00:36:54] background letting you know it's there
[00:36:56] it's reflecting
[00:37:00] oh no no no TR the treasure is the metal
[00:37:03] here the treasure is the metal
[00:37:20] here let's
[00:37:22] see think I got all those in there now
[00:37:29] NOP no not yet see that's the problem I
[00:37:32] keep L not looking not knowing where
[00:37:34] things are which is why I have a hard
[00:37:36] time so I figure if I make a
[00:37:40] weapon folder I can just press on it
[00:37:43] I'll know exactly where I need to go now
[00:37:45] make it a little easier for it right
[00:37:48] least sounds smart is it always smart I
[00:37:51] don't know
[00:37:58] yes it
[00:37:59] will yes it will it will be a higher
[00:38:02] role uh to try to do something with your
[00:38:04] armor so you go back and you find that
[00:38:08] uh workbench that you see
[00:38:11] there with your scrap
[00:38:14] metal and you want to try to upgrade
[00:38:16] your armor now you have
[00:38:20] intelligence my friend you have luck and
[00:38:25] Engineering which gives you plus three
[00:38:26] to your roll
[00:38:28] but to upgrade your armor being not
[00:38:31] having been yourself part of a faction
[00:38:33] of any kind that does anything specific
[00:38:35] to give you a boost you haven't met
[00:38:37] factions to run into yet we have them if
[00:38:39] you and since you haven't been part of
[00:38:40] one you haven't decided yet on that you
[00:38:42] have to you have to have a roll of it
[00:38:45] would have been 18 or higher to upgrade
[00:38:47] your armor with some metal so that means
[00:38:49] you have to have a 15 or higher
[00:38:52] now let's see what you get D well look
[00:38:56] at that
[00:38:59] oh thank

[00:39:10] thank you I appreciate it buddy so you
[00:39:13] got yourself the ability to upgrade your
[00:39:16] armor slightly so now what you do is you
[00:39:18] go and you take that scrap
[00:39:21] metal and you mold that
[00:39:23] metal into uh
[00:39:27] we'll say you got a couple of um metal
[00:39:30] plates on your arms now to help protect
[00:39:32] it so you get a little bit of extra
[00:39:35] boost with your uh for if they try to
[00:39:36] hit your
[00:39:38] arms you can now uh you're now protected
[00:39:40] a little bit more so let me add that
[00:39:42] into your uh armor so minus 4 melee then
[00:39:48] um we going to put on
[00:39:50] here I'm going to go with minus two on

[00:40:39] have extra help you actually have
[00:40:41] something that'll take away so you need

[00:41:36] little uh little adventuring too while
[00:41:37] we're waiting to to open our next packs
[00:41:39] and stuff aani FS the
[00:41:42] godsire shattered landscape horrific
[00:41:46] assault Twisted landscape thriving
[00:41:48] skyclaw serum Visionary refurbished
[00:41:52] familiar lethal Throwdown consigned to
[00:41:56] memory meltdown oh nice little waren
[00:42:00] soul Trader for you and a wooded
[00:42:03] Foothills congratulations buddy with a
[00:42:07] hydr trainer foil and a swamp and your
[00:42:10] art token
[00:42:12] there a custom upgrade I know so the
[00:42:16] custom upgrade is just is not going to
[00:42:18] be anything super over the top just
[00:42:20] going to be a a minor upgrade that you
[00:42:23] get of some kind now with the minor
[00:42:25] upgrade that you get of some kind
[00:42:27] you get to um say one of your weapons
[00:42:30] that's not already been upgraded you can
[00:42:32] try to use some of that scrap metal and
[00:42:35] come up with some type of upgrade for
[00:42:37] one of those so for
[00:42:38] instance you have
[00:42:42] um no regular weapons okay you already
[00:42:46] have a pirate you all you have for
[00:42:48] weapons okay so this is what we have for
[00:42:50] you you've got a pirate sword which is
[00:42:52] kind of regular the closest thing you
[00:42:53] have to regular the incendiary Gatling
[00:42:55] gun all all right you got that you have
[00:42:58] um also the alien
[00:43:01] sniper okay and you also have a uh
[00:43:06] flamethrower so I say I think you might
[00:43:09] be able to do the Gatling gun maybe put
[00:43:11] like a bayonet on it or something like
[00:43:13] that oh pirate sword yeah you could do
[00:43:16] that that was definitely a good pack oh
[00:43:19] definitely a good pack with wooded
[00:43:20] Foothills and warn Soul Trader yes that
[00:43:25] was all right pirate sword all right so
[00:43:28] you're going to do something to your
[00:43:29] pirate sword so you take some of the
[00:43:30] metal there you want to take that pirate
[00:43:32] sword and you're going to do some slight
[00:43:33] upgrades to the pirate sword now when
[00:43:36] with you again being upgrading something
[00:43:38] you need to get some extra you need to
[00:43:40] get some luck here so let's
[00:43:43] see big BK you have three now you would
[00:43:47] have needed a uh 18 because it's the
[00:43:49] pirate sword you chose now being three
[00:43:52] actually you need F uh 15 or
[00:43:55] higher so we're roll your
[00:43:58] dice and I'm going to run another one of
[00:44:00] these here but we're going to run it for
[00:44:02] a minute that way it gives us to do a
[00:44:03] little bit of time to do the adventuring
[00:44:05] while we uh while we wait for the next
[00:44:06] one to
[00:44:10] go so you upgrade and you get a
[00:44:14] six H well it does not work so well when
[00:44:19] you try to upgrade it so now you can
[00:44:22] come up with the upgrade you were trying
[00:44:23] to do that with me what we were thinking
[00:44:26] was we put I was thinking you'd put a
[00:44:27] little Shield over the hand you know
[00:44:30] like uh back in the day where they have
[00:44:32] um you know your sword and then you had
[00:44:34] over the hand you had like the metal
[00:44:35] shield to protect your knuckles and
[00:44:37] everything and you can punch someone
[00:44:38] with I thinking we going to throw one of
[00:44:40] those on there but it seems like it
[00:44:41] didn't work when you try to use your
[00:44:43] scrap metal a cutless like a cutless
[00:44:45] exactly like a cutless Halloween exactly
[00:44:47] like a cutless
[00:44:50] correct pangu whatever they whatever
[00:44:52] they were the handguard there like a
[00:44:54] cutless yes so if you want to we were
[00:44:56] going to try to do that but it did not
[00:44:57] work but now you have the idea of it cuz
[00:45:00] you already drode it down so the next
[00:45:01] time maybe you'll be lucky enough to
[00:45:03] upgrade that to be more of a cutless for
[00:45:05] some uh some added some added bonus for
[00:45:09] you we'll find out
[00:45:12] though but you're at that and you turn
[00:45:15] around when you're there you guys were
[00:45:17] unlucky a few feral ghouls heard you
[00:45:20] rumaging around in the distance and they
[00:45:22] come toward you you've got two of the
[00:45:25] feral ghouls they're only 15 Health
[00:45:26] they're not big Health not not a big
[00:45:28] problem there so you got to
[00:45:30] decide what you going to do and
[00:45:32] everybody else if You' like we have our
[00:45:34] uh
[00:45:35] our auto box if you want to jump in on
[00:45:37] that lots of different things in there
[00:45:39] everything from Infinity to draft boes
[00:45:43] to uh some uh Commander decks pre-con
[00:45:47] decks to um there's even I think there's
[00:45:51] even some
[00:45:51] [Music]
[00:45:52] um secret lir in there
[00:46:03] I don't know why it says quantity that
[00:46:04] was the weirdest thing ever but it seems
[00:46:06] like it's corrected itself
[00:46:09] now shoot him and stab him all right you
[00:46:11] got the one you got the three knives so
[00:46:14] all right you're going to roll you see
[00:46:16] them coming coming toward you you go to
[00:46:18] shoot
[00:46:19] them and oh well look at that with those
[00:46:22] guys you only need a 13 to hit them and
[00:46:24] you already me get you already get a
[00:46:26] plus uh what is it it plus with your
[00:46:31] incendiary we're going to add that
[00:46:32] actually
[00:46:35] up incendiary is a
[00:46:38] plus seven on your
[00:46:43] roll same thing the alien sniper rifle
[00:46:45] is a plus six the pirate sword is a plus
[00:46:50] six flamethrower is plus
[00:46:54] six the only one Higher is the
[00:46:56] incendiary gas that you have creaded
[00:46:57] plus seven so it doesn't really matter
[00:46:59] you hit them anyways you hit which one
[00:47:01] you going to take out cuz you can take I
[00:47:03] think one of them out with your uh 6 10
[00:47:06] almost one of them one of them's one of
[00:47:08] them is almost dead what do we say one
[00:47:11] of those guys is almost dead
[00:47:13] there and then we have our buddy um
[00:47:17] Halloween charges
[00:47:20] in with their uh
[00:47:24] knives and goes willy-nilly on that one
[00:47:28] let's see what happens does the dice
[00:47:30] roll happen oh you hit but you hit for
[00:47:33] one you slice one of them
[00:47:36] up ah close down to one
[00:47:41] Health down to one Health that guy
[00:47:52] is
[00:47:55] they they
[00:48:00] attack they miss you all get
[00:48:04] lucky hey
[00:48:09] miss those feral ghouls ran toward you
[00:48:14] you decided you're going to shoot again
[00:48:15] with the
[00:48:18] incendiary oh oh it was almost not and
[00:48:22] you hit
[00:48:24] him well looks like uh you have a choice
[00:48:26] you kill one or you damage one
[00:48:28] significantly
[00:49:05] that's a good well I figured that much
[00:49:07] so one's down to
[00:49:09] 13 I'm guessing Halloween's going to go
[00:49:11] with the knife
[00:49:16] again now you got two are you going to
[00:49:17] use two this time all right
[00:49:23] knife all right you uh hit that other
[00:49:26] one so there's only one of them left you
[00:49:29] stab one one of them left and he's
[00:49:30] starting to turn to
[00:49:43] run let's see what happens I know uh big
[00:49:46] BK is gonna sh's going to
[00:49:49] attack there we

[01:05:52] and it gives you a slight radius and it
[01:05:53] helps with uh it helps to make it so so
[01:05:55] if something can heal or something like
[01:05:57] that they can't so use a flamethrower
[01:05:59] it's a plus six it is a uh three with
[01:06:02] your dice roll so there you go let's see
[01:06:05] what you get my friend
[01:06:10] um looks like your flamethrower did not
[01:06:13] did not
[01:06:15] work it wasn't a one that's true it was
[01:06:17] not a
[01:06:21] one you didn't hear what was going on
[01:06:24] you did not see if it had wings I don't
[01:06:26] know does it does it have wings NOP it
[01:06:30] doesn't really have wings no does not
[01:06:32] have wings it's a just an radi kind of
[01:06:34] like a large um cockroach
[01:06:37] antish cockroach
[01:06:40] thing no no wings so I mean um you can
[01:06:44] go after uh one of his legs or something
[01:06:47] if you want to try that you know our
[01:06:49] buddy Playa says I mean Halloween says
[01:06:52] he's just going to go swinging in there
[01:06:53] with the knife now you do have a sword
[01:06:55] remember
[01:06:57] you got to cut his legs off all right
[01:06:59] fine go to cut his legs off now using
[01:07:02] the
[01:07:03] knife my
[01:07:08] friend we'll run another one of these if
[01:07:11] anybody else wants to jump in and hang
[01:07:12] out see what they
[01:07:16] get more damage all right the sword the
[01:07:19] sword does more damage you get a plus
[01:07:21] five now this a radiated bug mean a
[01:07:23] large bug is a 17 so that means you need
[01:07:25] need to have a 12 or higher and you
[01:07:27] actually get two to
[01:07:28] roll
[01:07:31] ah the sword you ran in with the sword

[01:07:47] got like an acid

[01:09:01] the middle of
[01:09:07] it oh all right well do we say it's on
[01:09:12] the side chat what do you
[01:09:14] think it could
[01:09:16] be that couldn't be like a not yeah all
[01:09:20] right all right we're going to do again
[01:09:21] that was on his
[01:09:24] side all right right well there you go
[01:09:27] you
[01:09:31] flamethrowa now this one is 30 for its
[01:09:34] health so that brings it down to
[01:09:36] [Music]
[01:09:37] 22 it's not
[01:09:40] happy charges in towards you
[01:09:43] both to attack this
[01:09:46] time let's see what happens it doesn't
[01:09:48] use the acid
[01:09:49] spray oh well it got a 10 it missed you
[01:09:52] both again
[01:09:57] so you dive out of the
[01:09:59] way no the rooll is uh the the the D20
[01:10:03] is to see if you hit then after that
[01:10:06] it's the D6 is for the
[01:10:10] damage so you it
[01:10:14] missed all right shoot it again with the
[01:10:16] Gat this time I like it the Gat this
[01:10:19] time oh that is a an incendiary G he
[01:10:22] gets 12
[01:10:26] 16 you hit it
[01:10:28] with using your uh incendiary Gat
[01:10:34] there that brings it down
[01:10:38] to
[01:10:44] 13 then you go with the
[01:10:50] sword oh my again you missed with the
[01:10:53] sword
[01:10:55] it looks like the sword is uh not your
[01:10:58] friend
[01:10:59] there uh Halloween I I mean the thing is
[01:11:02] though you have to
[01:11:04] remember you know it maybe it might be
[01:11:06] that uh that agility and luck uh agility
[01:11:10] and intelligence lowering that caused
[01:11:11] some of
[01:11:15] that but it roll it attacks back this
[01:11:18] time it's going to go with it
[01:11:22] spray oh it hits you both oh no but it
[01:11:26] does not hit with the spray it only
[01:11:28] attacks with a little bit of
[01:11:30] uh by with its legs there like mandibles
[01:11:34] that you see there those what do you
[01:11:35] call them the front oh no not that's
[01:11:36] supposed to roll you only got three
[01:11:38] damage to each of you let me put that
[01:11:40] over here so you go from 87 88 to
[01:11:45] 85 go from
[01:11:47] 89 down to uh 86 there you go not a bad
[01:11:53] one you guys got lucky with it
[01:11:55] going to shoot it another time with the
[01:12:00] incendiary and you hit
[01:12:02] for 10
[01:12:05] 11 that bug
[01:12:09] whales that big bug
[01:12:12] whales doesn't know what to
[01:12:15] do it's
[01:12:18] injured it's almost
[01:12:22] dead shoot it you're going to shoot it
[01:12:24] with your pistol sure we can try
[01:12:27] it you shoot it with your
[01:12:30] pistol oh my well look at that you do
[01:12:33] hit it with a natural
[01:12:35] 20 you decide you know
[01:12:38] what I can't do anything right now so he
[01:12:41] goes and big the big byy our big guy
[01:12:45] Halloween grabs the
[01:12:48] pistol shoots
[01:12:50] wildly and happens to hit that bug
[01:12:54] directly in
[01:13:00] eye all right directly in its eye it
[01:13:04] falls to the
[01:13:05] ground dead d e d
[01:13:11] dead so you guys are going to go over
[01:13:13] and loot it's up to
[01:13:21] you I know bounces are off absolutely
[01:13:24] all right you guys go over and you uh
[01:13:28] find a couple of rat away on it you guys
[01:13:32] got lucky the acid straight in hit to
[01:13:34] give you RADS so each you will get a rat
[01:13:37] away and then also on it one of them has
[01:13:41] some plasma
[01:13:42] ammo so there are H five rounds of
[01:13:45] plasma
[01:13:47] ammo if You' like it not a big uh not a
[01:13:51] big thing but you do use you can use
[01:13:53] that so everybody get some rra
[01:13:58] away and then
[01:14:01] uh who is going to take the plasma ammo
[01:14:05] now the only one that could probably use
[01:14:07] it would be the alien sniper rifle needs
[01:14:09] some plasma ammo uh right now you'd
[01:14:12] probably be the only one that can use it
[01:14:14] so if you take those five put it towards
[01:14:17] your alien sniper rifle that'll actually
[01:14:19] just give you one more uh of your alien
[01:14:22] sniper rifle around ability to use the
[01:14:24] plasma rounds with it
[01:14:26] so so when you hit a shot you have one
[01:14:28] out of four so you have four one out of
[01:14:30] fours for the plasma shot there or
[01:14:32] whatever I think I was
[01:14:35] doing Autobox work just literally it's
[01:14:38] the same same thing as auto box uh the
[01:14:40] difference is you just do a little D and
[01:14:42] D game with it when you play in Denny so
[01:14:45] for instance um you jump in I run the I
[01:14:48] run it here and you can see everything
[01:14:50] that's available in there from packs to
[01:14:52] secret layer stuff to some decks and
[01:14:54] things like that so I'll run this and
[01:14:57] we'll try and whatever happens to pop up
[01:14:59] is kind of like you start in as your
[01:15:01] character in The Wasteland take over and
[01:15:03] then eventually once you've been around
[01:15:05] for a little bit we'll uh we can make a
[01:15:07] character for you like we have for some
[01:15:08] of the others like we have big BK here
[01:15:12] and then uh you get to play in the
[01:15:13] Wasteland hang out with us do some kind
[01:15:15] of D adventuring
[01:15:16] Denny and that's how it goes you get
[01:15:18] whatever the pack is or
[01:15:20] the um secret layer or the deck or
[01:15:25] whatever happens to be that pops up
[01:15:26] through the auto box and then would that
[01:15:28] has something associated could be pogs
[01:15:30] could be a
[01:15:32] game can you take one of his legs oh I
[01:15:34] don't know why not you go over and you
[01:15:35] try to rip a leg off let's
[01:15:39] see you have to have uh 10 or
[01:15:43] higher the leg does not come
[01:15:47] off all right well that doesn't work
[01:15:50] when you go to rip the leg
[01:15:51] off um you end up getting sprayed
[01:15:55] with some of his spray and you are now
[01:15:58] irradiated you got a little bit of bad
[01:16:00] luck there my
[01:16:04] friend but luckily you R away would you
[01:16:06] like to use one of those before you uh
[01:16:08] have it affect
[01:16:10] you I'm guessing that's going to be a
[01:16:15] yes all right well see big BK for
[01:16:18] instance got
[01:16:20] the faction reputation boost all right
[01:16:24] you want to choose you'll be able to
[01:16:26] have a boost in your faction reputation
[01:16:28] you also
[01:16:30] got
[01:16:32] the
[01:16:34] Eternal
[01:16:36] Light Eternal M commander deck look at
[01:16:39] that you did so you get the deck out of
[01:16:43] here that's the only thing if you read
[01:16:45] all the things we do I take the deck out
[01:16:47] that way um I can do shipping actually
[01:16:49] with yours I might be able to ship it if
[01:16:50] you've gotten a couple of things I might
[01:16:51] actually put it sealed so I'm going to
[01:16:53] hold on to this and if I can't do it
[01:16:54] sealed we open it up I'll ship it with
[01:16:56] just the the the deck um but other than
[01:16:58] that I'll try to ship it sealed for
[01:17:02] you well no well as I think for you I
[01:17:05] might be able to but some people if they
[01:17:06] buy like one thing and head out I I
[01:17:09] can't do the shipping that same way but
[01:17:11] because you've bought a couple of things
[01:17:12] I'll be able to adjust where's
[01:17:16] the
[01:17:19] potit you'll be able to fit in
[01:17:22] there this really what it blows down to
[01:17:24] so I won't do that and you'll get it
[01:17:28] big
[01:17:30] bk509 see look at that that's what I'm
[01:17:33] talking
[01:17:36] about big BK
[01:17:40] 509 you're very
[01:17:42] welcome there you go everybody
[01:17:45] see that's what you can get look at that
[01:17:50] one so that's there for big I'll put
[01:17:53] this over here
[01:17:55] in the background now big you have some
[01:17:59] faction reputation you get to add to
[01:18:01] yourself now if you said you think you
[01:18:02] knew what your faction was that's fine
[01:18:05] but you now um let's have that in over
[01:18:17] here now I'm going to give you plus one
[01:18:19] on your faction reputation
[01:18:26] for whichever one you end up choosing we
[01:18:28] went over them
[01:18:29] before but uh we can go over those again
[01:18:32] we'll make some of the images maybe to
[01:18:33] go with whichever ones they are there
[01:18:36] you go there everybody look at that big
[01:18:39] BK just came out with that there nice
[01:18:42] one for everybody and we'll run another
[01:18:45] you also got yourself some faction uh
[01:18:47] faction luck there now you get to choose
[01:18:50] uh which one you're part of and then
[01:18:51] when you're part of it you also get to
[01:18:53] decide uh that'll so like so for for
[01:18:56] your um character or maybe uh where what
[01:18:59] direction you want to go when it comes
[01:19:01] to how you want to play the game so for
[01:19:03] instance I think I've gone over before
[01:19:05] we have the iron fangs they're like
[01:19:07] Warlords we have uh Crimson Sy Syndicate
[01:19:10] they're uh kind of like Smugglers and
[01:19:12] assassins Vault born are are are
[01:19:16] um they are the ones that are survivors
[01:19:19] of the hidden underground bunkers we
[01:19:22] have the rosborn they are AI worshippers
[01:19:24] that uh they're just technological
[01:19:26] Fanatics and then we have some Pirates
[01:19:28] they're just Nomads Rogues and
[01:19:34] mercenaries so I I I named them all off
[01:19:37] there again so the pirate one all right
[01:19:41] that's what it was so we're going to
[01:19:43] give you you are now a loyal is loyalty
[01:19:47] is the highest bidder you're the Wast
[01:19:48] and Pirates you're part of now you're
[01:19:50] part of the faction is an opportunist
[01:19:52] opportunistic Raiders and Mercenaries
[01:19:55] who sail across the Wasteland ruins on
[01:19:58] makeshift landships they know they hold
[01:20:01] no Alliance except to those that bring
[01:20:04] the most profit you have the ability to
[01:20:06] switch sides based on your personal gain
[01:20:08] you have access to Hidden cashes or
[01:20:11] stolen weapons and supplies you have a
[01:20:13] discount on smuggling services and under
[01:20:15] the table
[01:20:17] deals and then but you do have no true
[01:20:19] Allegiance so players
[01:20:21] May betray you at any time or you may
[01:20:24] betray them so they don't always trust
[01:20:25] you you could also for Force to do
[01:20:28] difficult choices if they pay you more
[01:20:30] yes so if something happens they're
[01:20:32] going to be paid more fine by you all
[01:20:35] right then so you have a you are now
[01:20:38] with the Pirates all right there you go

[01:25:41] there wandering around and when you're
[01:25:43] uh you guys are all you're looking at
[01:25:45] helping them grab some of that that
[01:25:47] stuff over there you uh a mediumsized
[01:25:51] bug and a small bug
[01:25:55] come wandering in to the place
[01:26:00] there wandering into
[01:26:03] your location that you're hanging
[01:26:06] out in your abandoned
[01:26:11] building slice it with the sword is that
[01:26:14] what you're doing big BK all right I
[01:26:15] like it so you have the pirate
[01:26:20] sword all right use your pirate sword
[01:26:22] let's see what happens
[01:26:25] well look at that that's a that one's a
[01:26:27] 15 to hit you have a plus six with your
[01:26:31] pirate sword plus your agility added on
[01:26:33] to it anyways so that would have
[01:26:35] actually been a plus seven so you get a
[01:26:37] uh
[01:26:39] 48 look that
[01:26:42] 13 so you have the choice
[01:26:45] of you can kill off the small
[01:26:48] bug or the medium bug you can bring it
[01:26:51] down to uh seven damage
[01:26:55] oh yeah plus three on the
[01:26:58] agility because the uh because your
[01:27:00] other guy your thing there your weapon I
[01:27:02] forgot about I keep forgetting about
[01:27:03] that the weapon gives you extra
[01:27:09] agility and you have other agility
[01:27:12] too kill the small one all right the
[01:27:14] small one's
[01:27:15] killed all right I'm guessing you're
[01:27:17] going to go you said you going to go
[01:27:19] with your sword with the big one I like
[01:27:21] it big one and you hit well look at that
[01:27:24] my
[01:27:26] friend the uh the sword hits this
[01:27:30] time from our buddy uh and that is
[01:27:36] killing off the bigger
[01:27:41] one you had to show him how to swing it
[01:27:45] that was a nice swing there you got to
[01:27:47] hit on that
[01:27:49] one and
[01:27:51] boom you actually killed uh both those
[01:27:53] guys chop them over they're they're
[01:27:56] they're done they're done now you get to
[01:27:58] rumage around they don't really have
[01:28:00] anything on them you rage around you
[01:28:01] look at them you already were in there
[01:28:02] they're's bugs but one of them happen to
[01:28:05] have two pogs so you do get two pogs so
[01:28:08] one of you can get a couple pogs I'm
[01:28:10] guessing big BK you already have a trunk
[01:28:12] might want to give them to our maybe
[01:28:13] Halloween can get them for 12 Halloween
[01:28:16] will get the pogs there all right

[01:45:09] both you end up killing them
[01:45:13] both you going to loot the Raiders all
[01:45:15] right the Raiders you got all right so
[01:45:17] with the Raiders you decided to loot
[01:45:19] them when you were looking around one of
[01:45:22] you
[01:45:25] finds a luck booster oh look at that
[01:45:29] then there is
[01:45:30] also a critical that is
[01:45:33] found and then you also
[01:45:37] find about I'll say we'll say 10 pogs
[01:45:41] each we'll go up 10 pogs each so you go
[01:45:43] up 22 then you go up to
[01:45:49] 170 take the critical hit
[01:45:53] you going to pass the
[01:45:58] Foods um yes the critical hit is attemp
[01:46:01] one and the luck is a uh attempt one
[01:46:05] that is correct so you get one luck like
[01:46:07] extra luck for like a roll or something
[01:46:09] like that but uh and critical it just
[01:46:11] guarantees a critical give both of them
[01:46:13] all right I like
[01:46:14] it so you have uh buff consumables
[01:46:19] there's a
[01:46:21] critical and and then a + one
[01:46:26] intelligence one
[01:46:29] turn there you go I not intelligence
[01:46:32] plus one
[01:46:39] lock there we
[01:46:41] go have the pogs oh give you both all
[01:46:44] the pogs all right look at that get you
[01:46:45] 32 pogs
[01:46:47] then and you're at you're 160 for your
[01:46:49] pogs all right
[01:46:53] you need a Perman boost on your
[01:46:54] intelligence you definitely do
[01:46:56] definitely need a permanent boost on the
[01:46:58] intelligence B let me get you over here
[01:47:01] Halloween stuff
[01:47:06] Halloween yeah that's not a bad idea get
[01:47:09] him set up with some stuff he's going to
[01:47:10] be around playing hanging out with you I
[01:47:11] like it so
[01:47:13] Halloween you got yourself uh some
[01:47:16] supplies there you can pick up not a bad
[01:47:18] idea to dig through those you don't know
[01:47:20] if they're radiated they may they may
[01:47:21] not be but you also have away if thate
[01:47:23] if you guys remember that and there's
[01:47:25] also the ability to do things you're
[01:47:26] going to take some food all right you
[01:47:28] going to take it we're going to
[01:47:31] take the
[01:47:33] uh food
[01:47:35] cans there you go food
[01:47:38] cans you have a rataway left actually
[01:47:40] you think you have more than one you
[01:47:42] have two rways cuz you were given one so
[01:47:45] you actually have two rways left ah look
[01:47:47] at
[01:47:49] that guys are searching around the food
[01:47:52] picking through through that
[01:47:55] stuff and
[01:47:59] uh there a clumsy Raider comes up behind
[01:48:03] you they're only at 20 but they're very
[01:48:06] clumsy they don't they don't shoot well
[01:48:07] they don't do a good
[01:48:10] job oh yes you did you did yes you did
[01:48:14] so you are down to
[01:48:20] one forgot about that
[01:48:24] now you have to decide that clumsy
[01:48:30] Raider yes he tried to shoot just
[01:48:33] running over and he missed that's what
[01:48:35] I'm saying he he's a clumsy bad
[01:48:38] shot he missed that's how you were
[01:48:40] alerted to
[01:48:44] him oh we're going to kill him since he
[01:48:46] came over shooting you go after him now
[01:48:47] he's 20 only not major to worry about so
[01:48:51] you roll with what shooting with all
[01:48:53] right I'm guessing the uh
[01:48:59] incendiary well you hit there then you
[01:49:02] hit
[01:49:03] for
[01:49:05] 15 well look at that you hit for 15 and
[01:49:08] then you go in to stab with your
[01:49:12] knives least it's not a
[01:49:19] one least it's not a one
[01:49:23] I I
[01:49:25] mean well you missed with that and this
[01:49:29] guy he's got a he's only got a couple of
[01:49:30] pistols that he's shooting with so he
[01:49:32] try shooting
[01:49:36] again oh and they miss with their
[01:49:39] pistols you know being clumsy that
[01:49:42] doesn't help
[01:49:48] obviously knce for the win going in with
[01:49:51] the kniv one more time
[01:50:02] I don't know if
[01:50:04] uh I'm just going to like we're going to
[01:50:06] ignore that and we're going to say big
[01:50:08] BK comes in start
[01:50:11] shooting or slicing with the
[01:50:20] sword guys
[01:50:24] guys I guess the clumsiness of our uh of
[01:50:28] our buddy wore off because you guys one
[01:50:32] you miss with that sword
[01:50:34] horribly and because you missed with the
[01:50:36] sword horribly you end up hitting
[01:50:39] something and it reflects off you the
[01:50:41] sword bounces down and let's see what it
[01:50:45] does for damage to
[01:50:49] you you get 14 damage from yourself
[01:50:54] with that clumsy mistake so that brings
[01:50:56] you down
[01:51:00] to 63
[01:51:03] health no I mean 67
[01:51:05] Health from your 81
[01:51:12] health no worries
[01:51:14] Halloween he is
[01:51:18] evasive um your sword can actually ready
[01:51:22] see you have three sixes on you have you
[01:51:24] have you can do up to you know you know
[01:51:26] 3 * 6 is 18 so that's why it can do up
[01:51:29] to that
[01:51:33] amount ah let's get rid of the
[01:51:37] dice whe alive
[01:51:40] again all right last
[01:51:42] chance they swing at you they shoot at
[01:51:45] you clumsily
[01:51:46] again and they missed they needed a 13
[01:51:49] or higher they missed so you're going to
[01:51:51] slice one more time
[01:51:54] time this time hopefully hit him well
[01:51:57] you know what it's a plus six so you hit
[01:51:59] him all you needed was a 13 because of
[01:52:02] how clumsy they are you hit them and
[01:52:05] there was only five left for their
[01:52:07] health so you kill them you slice them
[01:52:10] up with your uh with your pirate sword
[01:52:13] there take off a chunk of his arm half
[01:52:15] of his body and he drops the
[01:52:17] ground on him you

[01:53:43] BK all right sounds good oh look at that
[01:53:47] you got another modern Horizon 3 and you
[01:53:49] found a scavenged component oh some
[01:53:52] electronic components of some kind
[01:53:55] you're wandering around and you
[01:53:58] um as you're looking through different
[01:54:01] areas you find uh where is
[01:54:06] [Music]
[01:54:08] that rust borne drone on the
[01:54:12] ground it's got some computer parts and
[01:54:15] stuff like that in it some uh and other

[01:54:29] one two three four five 6 7 8 let's put
[01:54:34] our spoilers at the end oh we got a
[01:54:35] little bit of a spoiler right
[01:54:37] there so here we have a deceptive
[01:54:40] landscape dog Umbra Nightshade dryad
[01:54:44] Ross cotton Knight void pouncer tune The
[01:54:48] Narrative dream Drinker vampire Wampus
[01:54:51] aition SP battle wagon raw the implicit
[01:54:54] maze fell the profane was a nice little
[01:54:56] pick up there Leila the blade reforged
[01:55:00] nice rare a wheel of potential for
[01:55:03] another rare and a foil re wheel of
[01:55:05] potential I hate when they do
[01:55:08] that Collective resistance for your R
[01:55:11] card why do they do
[01:55:13] that but anyways you see uh a rust borne
[01:55:17] drone kind of broken up beaten on the
[01:55:20] ground you go
[01:55:23] over yeah I know like seriously so you
[01:55:27] head over to
[01:55:29] there to uh pick that drone up and
[01:55:32] slowly oh it comes slightly to life
[01:55:35] lifts up off the
[01:55:40] ground starts to
[01:55:42] scan the area and
[01:55:47] you well we know rust
[01:55:50] borne is not a pirate so they're part of
[01:55:53] the other uh
[01:55:55] factions so that being said with it
[01:55:57] being part of the other factions do you
[01:55:58] want to uh let it keep scanning or do
[01:56:00] you want to like what are you going to
[01:56:01] do try and shoot it
[01:56:03] down you have to decide big BK cuz you
[01:56:07] got this uh drone in front of
[01:56:10] you oh shoot that down with the sniper I
[01:56:12] like it you back up
[01:56:15] there you back
[01:56:17] up you take a look you uh take the
[01:56:20] sniper out which has a plus six
[01:56:22] for your
[01:56:24] roll and you try to take out that
[01:56:28] drone ah well there you go you take it
[01:56:31] out it's not a big hit it's only a 15 to
[01:56:33] take out a drone and you got 16 over 16
[01:56:38] I mean you got 18 so that drone you ping
[01:56:41] it off and luckily you use the sniper
[01:56:44] rifle so that drone Falls the ground
[01:56:47] it's not really completely blow blown up
[01:56:49] as you can see it's just sparking there
[01:56:51] you take the Dr drone and you throw it
[01:56:53] the broken drone into your bag I like it
[01:56:57] so you got some loot here of
[01:57:01] uh a broke R rust
[01:57:05] born
[01:57:08] grown there you go that was a nice
[01:57:10] pickoff dude that was a good one you
[01:57:13] picked it right off

[01:57:20] uh who else would oh what's it's going
[01:57:23] slow there we go let's see if anybody
[01:57:26] else has any encounters here but that's
[01:57:28] a sweet one I like that you find
[01:57:30] yourself the Drone there and then uh you
[01:57:34] as you're wanding away there's a couple
[01:57:37] small bugs in the
[01:57:39] distance but they're not really nearby
[01:57:42] maybe some practice if you want with the
[01:57:46] uh with the p with the uh with your
[01:57:49] sniper rifle but that's about it right
[01:57:50] now they're just wandering away they're
[01:57:52] really doing anything that's going to
[01:57:53] harm you you
[01:57:56] know so as we continue pass by on them
[01:58:01] yeah leave them me it's a good idea CU

[02:34:12] a oh it's not working you get a plus um
[02:34:16] two on each roll which you only need you
[02:34:19] don't you you only needed one cuz you
[02:34:21] needed a 15 to hit one of them or you
[02:34:22] needed a 13 and you hit one of those
[02:34:25] guys and oh well look at that you can
[02:34:28] put the um the big Raider down
[02:34:31] to one health or you can knock uh five
[02:34:35] Health off on the little
[02:34:37] guys they are not close that you can't
[02:34:40] that you can swing a weapon at them a
[02:34:42] melee one they're they're a little bit
[02:34:44] away big guy all right big guy big guy
[02:34:47] you shoot him with your pistol you bring
[02:34:50] him down to one look at
[02:34:52] that he's down to one and now you have I
[02:34:56] think left is uh sdb if they're going to
[02:35:01] do anything themselves now sdb what you
[02:35:05] have it's a pistol knife and that
[02:35:07] assault rifle that you picked up a
[02:35:08] little while
[02:35:10] back so that assault rifle might come in
[02:35:12] handy right
[02:35:17] now yes the
[02:35:20] rifle I like it all right so that gets
[02:35:24] you this
[02:35:28] here oh you get a hit and well you get
[02:35:32] to kill the big one if you'd
[02:35:34] like that'll kill off the big
[02:35:37] one the mediumsized one is will be gone
[02:35:41] we'll say kill that guy off and then
[02:35:43] that leaves you with the two small
[02:35:45] ones all of you hanging out there what
[02:35:49] do we say probably good idea and those
[02:35:52] two small ones they need 13 or higher to
[02:35:56] hit oh you guys are lucky the two of
[02:35:59] them shoot they both Miss and then they
[02:36:00] look at each other like ah
[02:36:02] [Â __Â ] turn around they start to run what
[02:36:06] are you guys going to
[02:36:07] do are you going to let them
[02:36:10] run or you going to chase them down are
[02:36:12] you going to shoot them what are you
[02:36:13] going to do you shoot him in the back
[02:36:14] again big BK shoot him in the back again
[02:36:23] oh Halloween decides he's going to shoot
[02:36:24] him in the back this
[02:36:28] time hen says no you're not running away
[02:36:30] from
[02:36:31] me and they look turn around and they
[02:36:33] laugh and goes uh after the shot goes by
[02:36:35] them and kind of hits the ground goes I
[02:36:37] think I
[02:36:42] am and then oh
[02:36:44] sniper all right you're going to use
[02:36:46] your alien sniper I like it take out the
[02:36:49] alien sniper which is a plus six for
[02:36:51] your
[02:36:52] roll and you get these let's see what
[02:36:56] happens well now you get a natural
[02:37:00] 20 so this is what I'm going to say what
[02:37:03] happens
[02:37:04] here you
[02:37:06] hit
[02:37:08] perfectly the shot with your sniper
[02:37:10] rifle on that small raadar and as you
[02:37:12] see they have some mechanical Parts all
[02:37:15] right and one when he was running
[02:37:20] when it shoots it hits one of those
[02:37:22] mechanical Parts causing him to short
[02:37:24] circuit but it ricochets off to hit the
[02:37:27] other one in the head so both of them
[02:37:30] fall over
[02:37:32] dead look at
[02:37:34] that that was the luck of the critical
[02:37:36] shot there you did a nice shot you got a
[02:37:38] perfect hit but you got luck with it
[02:37:40] with your critical shot cuz you have

[02:42:37] was sdb put you
[02:42:41] together ah any pogs on anyone there
[02:42:44] were uh there were a few pogs that were
[02:42:46] found on uh around where the the small
[02:42:51] ones were not a lot of pogs because they
[02:42:53] were Raiders and they were uh they were
[02:42:55] just attacked by see the thing was if
[02:42:58] you guys I was I was hoping you could
[02:42:59] have taken out a couple more of the
[02:43:01] sandstorm Raiders they were the ones
[02:43:02] that have the pogs on them more so they
[02:43:05] didn't that one that you ran into didn't
[02:43:06] have any cuz he wasn't holding the
[02:43:09] purse because those small Raiders they
[02:43:11] were mad and they just came to attack
[02:43:12] because they were just taken out by
[02:43:13] those and had their pogs taken so you
[02:43:15] find like maybe one or two pogs around
[02:43:18] but no big cat dash of them because they
[02:43:20] were robbed but sdb
[02:43:24] though here they came in and they uh
[02:43:28] they have a little they
[02:43:30] themselves see something going
[02:43:33] on
[02:43:37] and what happens is where'd it
[02:43:41] go I had it right
[02:43:46] here you see another small Raider
[02:43:52] with a buddy of theirs coming toward you
[02:43:54] a cyborg is looking Raider and you have
[02:43:56] to
[02:43:58] decide yes I did oh yes you do need some
[02:44:01] more to make that uhhuh all right let's
[02:44:03] see what we got here oh I see a cage
[02:44:05] coming in with some singles I like it
[02:44:34] so what do you want to do ask DB you're
[02:44:35] the primary one running this here all
[02:44:37] right you have to decide are you going
[02:44:40] to be grabbing some
[02:44:44] uh fighting here or are you going to
[02:44:47] turn and run cuz I know sdb you you're
[02:44:49] you're newer and you don't have that
[02:44:50] much stuff but you do have some friends
[02:44:51] there with you you have an
[02:44:55] AR you can use the AR potentially try to
[02:44:59] take out the uh the cyborg looking
[02:45:05] one am I slowing down here for a minute
[02:45:08] or something hopefully we're
[02:45:11] okay we're going to have to be be taking
[02:45:13] the time off here in a little bit we'll
[02:45:15] be done in a minute here myself because
[02:45:19] we have to do some stuff and kind of get
[02:45:20] ready for hopefully the freaking thing
[02:45:22] shows up today so we can put the top
[02:45:26] on uh are we freezing or something I
[02:45:29] don't know want to take a drink of
[02:45:32] coffee sdb I know you're at work so that
[02:45:35] yeah that could be the other thing too
[02:45:36] so how about uh how about this so those
[02:45:38] that aren't at work that have been
[02:45:39] hanging out here with us what should we
[02:45:40] be doing right
[02:45:46] now we have um we have a couple of
[02:45:49] things in front of us we have this small
[02:45:51] Raider a new one that came out here with
[02:45:53] a uh a cyborg Raider as their buddy here
[02:45:56] all right Halloween what do you think we
[02:45:57] should do I know it's late for big BK
[02:46:00] you might get be falling asleep we got
[02:46:01] to have some others that are working and
[02:46:03] stuff shoot time all right we're going
[02:46:06] to shoot you've got your pistol you use
[02:46:09] that you shoot at the Cyborg and oh well
[02:46:12] look at that you hit him you only hit
[02:46:13] him for one though not much damage it
[02:46:16] hits kind of dings off his metal dents
[02:46:18] it
[02:46:19] doesn't uh really cause much damage goes
[02:46:22] from 25 down to 24
[02:46:26] Health the other guy though small Raider
[02:46:29] kind of looks at what's going on like
[02:46:30] that wasn't really that good of a shot
[02:46:31] and uh he tries to kind of walk up
[02:46:35] sneaking around the other side while
[02:46:36] your attention is on the cyborg
[02:46:39] Raider hit is a hit that is true that is
[02:46:42] true serotonin a hit is definitely a hit
[02:46:44] whether you get it or not it's a hit
[02:46:46] we'll run another here in case somebody
[02:46:48] else wants to jump in I know sdb is at
[02:46:50] work at time so that's why I need
[02:46:52] to sometimes we go on and check who else
[02:46:54] wants to play but we got this and we'll
[02:46:57] have uh let's see who else is hanging
[02:46:59] out with us rifle all right let's do it
[02:47:01] we'll rifle to the little guy so you use
[02:47:04] your assault
[02:47:05] rifle on the little guy that's trying to
[02:47:07] sneak
[02:47:08] around I don't think so
[02:47:12] buddy and you
[02:47:15] miss but it stops his sneaking around
[02:47:19] because he is seen he knows he's seen so
[02:47:23] now instead of what he was going to do
[02:47:24] before he lays traps and he does sneaky
[02:47:27] things he actually just turns and he
[02:47:28] shoots with his
[02:47:31] pistol you got lucky you stopped him
[02:47:33] even though you didn't hit him you
[02:47:34] stopped him but he's not that good of a
[02:47:36] shot he's a trickster more than anything
[02:47:39] and he
[02:47:40] misses s DB so it's up to you guys now
[02:47:44] what are you going to do they missed the
[02:47:45] cyborg though he is uh he doesn't really
[02:47:49] he's a melee person comes in near and he
[02:47:51] hits you guys o one of you are going to
[02:47:54] take the damage
[02:47:56] here what do we say
[02:48:00] uh who do we have sdb or uh we say uh
[02:48:04] let's say who's the one that's was
[02:48:07] closest you took the shot with the AR so
[02:48:10] Halloween would probably be closer
[02:48:12] having come in with the pistol needing
[02:48:14] to be a little closer so Halloween
[02:48:17] you're going to be the one that needs to
[02:48:18] take the dam damage all
[02:48:21] right go
[02:48:23] down to oh crap I forgot what it was I
[02:48:26] moved it away
[02:48:27] already all right anyways we're going to
[02:48:29] call it 75 Health it wasn't a lot it
[02:48:32] might have been 77 it might it might
[02:48:34] have gone down more a little bit more
[02:48:35] than that stab that cyborg you don't
[02:48:37] like what he that cyborg does so you
[02:48:40] decide you're going to use your dual
[02:48:42] knives and try to stab it and look at
[02:48:44] that hit five knock it down to 20 health

[03:03:30] uh uh this here we're going to do this
[03:03:45] quickly all right let's see if we can uh
[03:03:48] get that to work
[03:04:04] right I'm try to do that quickly that
[03:04:06] was crazy I can't believe that they uh
[03:04:09] that you had only
[03:04:11] that no
[03:04:36] the hell is
[03:04:43] that oh this is going to be a pain uh
[03:04:46] pain in the but all right we're going to
[03:04:47] have to figure that out it doesn't want
[03:04:49] to make it with the guard on there I
[03:04:51] might have to get an image and have it
[03:04:52] make hold on ah I have an
[03:05:06] idea there we're going put that there
[03:05:08] let's try
[03:05:14] this we're going to do this here where
[03:05:16] is that
[03:05:19] how was that thing
[03:05:27] um oh come

[03:05:40] wanted why is it freezing on
[03:05:46] me let's do that
[03:05:49] then a you
[03:05:52] bastard there we
[03:05:55] go it didn't like the image there
[03:06:00] so we're going to have to do it
[03:06:02] differently
[03:06:21] why is it doing that I hate how it does
[03:06:23] that oh that's an absolute pain in the
[03:06:34] butt well it looks like I'm have to make
[03:06:36] it myself later at some point because
[03:06:38] it's going to be a pain and it's not
[03:06:40] going to like it we're going to get you
[03:06:41] a cut list here and we're going to have
[03:06:42] to make that we'll have it ready for you

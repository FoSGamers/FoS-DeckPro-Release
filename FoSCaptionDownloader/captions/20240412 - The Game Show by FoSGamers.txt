[00:01:45] independently wealthy and if you are
[00:01:46] independently wealthy in some way shape
[00:01:48] or form hey kind of cool right guys
[00:01:50] guess what I got some new Vault pack
[00:01:52] holders I think they're cool I know it
[00:01:54] might be corny but uh they're reusable
[00:01:57] that was part of the reason why I wanted
[00:01:58] something to be reusable
[00:02:00] so I wasn't wasting like envelopes all
[00:02:03] the
[00:02:04] time um so I'm going to throw this out
[00:02:08] right now maybe do that for this morning
[00:02:09] to start it we'll do a little Adventure
[00:02:11] in the Wasteland and this is my new
[00:02:13] packs that we
[00:02:16] have well we'll throw it like
[00:02:19] that oh bees in the guard you know what
[00:02:21] I've always wanted to do be be um like
[00:02:24] stuff with Beehives in our house area
[00:02:25] because we always have a lot of them
[00:02:26] around all right so this is our new VA
[00:02:28] packs ready ready so when you go to the
[00:02:31] Vault and you find one of the safes in
[00:02:34] the safe you're going to find yourself a
[00:02:37] gold $100 bill here which is actually an
[00:02:40] envelope that's reusable so I don't need
[00:02:43] to keep using uh wasted envelopes all
[00:02:45] the time but I thought that was kind of
[00:02:47] cool for the envelopes to be for the uh
[00:02:48] VA
[00:02:49] packs Benjamin get those
[00:02:53] Benjamins you have found yourself a
[00:02:58] Benjamin hey folks how you hey hey

[00:03:09] start it off with one of the one of the
[00:03:11] children's sign giveaways here that we

[00:04:53] this
[00:04:55] morning yeah that's the nice thing about
[00:04:57] him the tax WR offs so I found out that
[00:05:00] I have a business I can actually pay my
[00:05:03] children all year um and write it off
[00:05:06] for taxes and also put it into like a
[00:05:09] like you know like a Roth IRA type thing
[00:05:11] for them or uh something and pretty much
[00:05:15] if I do pay them every uh every month a
[00:05:18] certain amount by the time they're like
[00:05:19] my age they'll be millionaires so I'm
[00:05:21] like I actually might start doing that
[00:05:23] for them because they do help and I've
[00:05:25] been giving them just know they've been
[00:05:26] asking they want like a game or
[00:05:28] something so I'll buy a video game or
[00:05:30] they want some cards I'll buy Cards and
[00:05:31] say thank you for helping but uh I don't
[00:05:34] know maybe I'll do that instead along
[00:05:36] with giving some things like that cards
[00:05:37] and stuff if they want them or games but

[00:06:56] using my
[00:06:58] Benjamins
[00:07:06] yeah
[00:07:11] yeah yeah yeah the uh I know exactly
[00:07:14] what you're saying I used to work with a
[00:07:15] lot of wealthy people um one of the jobs
[00:07:18] that I had I managed and saw watched
[00:07:21] billions of dollars get traded a day the
[00:07:23] system that I happened to manage was an
[00:07:25] applic it was I was like a configuration
[00:07:27] application person that built helped
[00:07:28] manage an appliation that uh and
[00:07:31] Hardware that manage anywhere from 20 to
[00:07:34] 30 sometimes a little higher percent of
[00:07:37] the Asia Pacific Stock Exchange traffic
[00:07:39] so I saw everything for this was years
[00:07:41] ago probably like three years ago now
[00:07:43] four years ago before I started my last
[00:07:44] my new job that I have where I do the
[00:07:46] lawyer stuff uh but
[00:07:49] they you see all that happen and you
[00:07:51] talk to some of these people they have
[00:07:53] different they have a completely
[00:07:54] different tone outlook on life compared
[00:07:56] to everybody else on the on the planet
[00:07:58] so like you can't you can't even have
[00:08:00] the same type of conversation as I would
[00:08:02] with you with them they're just not
[00:08:04] they're not in the same mindset so
[00:08:06] that's why I started to learn like
[00:08:07] having worked in different areas in my
[00:08:09] life I started to kind of learn how to
[00:08:11] talk to kind of sometimes you know work
[00:08:14] with different people
[00:08:16] luckily and I've done everything from
[00:08:18] picking fish out of a net to throwing
[00:08:20] out to uh well making million dollar
[00:08:24] deals for um sales stuff let me get my
[00:08:28] giveaways up here
[00:08:31] I thought it was already up here but it
[00:08:43] isn't come on at f.
[00:08:47] Gamers free
[00:08:51] stuff please
[00:08:54] follow Link in the
[00:08:58] notes well that that there want that
[00:09:01] there there we
[00:09:08] go nah is peasants playing checkers they
[00:09:12] are playing chess that's correct that is
[00:09:15] correct I will agree on that one they do
[00:09:19] play checkers compared to uh we do play
[00:09:21] Checkers in some of us compared to them
[00:09:23] playing chess I've said that many times
[00:09:25] before I've um grown up where I was
[00:09:30] around I just happen to be the poor
[00:09:32] person around wealthy people for most of
[00:09:34] my life um I W I went to an all guys all
[00:09:38] boys high school private high school
[00:09:39] where I had a scholarship to go there
[00:09:41] happens to be like 20 grand a year to go
[00:09:43] there if I didn't have that scholarship
[00:09:45] there was no way I would have made it to
[00:09:46] that school but one of the things I got
[00:09:48] to do was I on one of my when I went to
[00:09:50] wrestling I wrestled on a wrestling team
[00:09:52] one of the fathers happened to own like
[00:09:53] um a bunch of the um newspapers in the
[00:09:57] area in Boston Massachusetts um and
[00:09:59] because of him owning all that like he
[00:10:01] had he was wealthy he had stuff but he
[00:10:02] didn't he didn't flaunt it he had a
[00:10:04] bunch of things but he didn't flaunt he
[00:10:05] was a good person and one of the things
[00:10:07] I did learn from him is you let me come
[00:10:08] in and you go in this SLK when they were
[00:10:10] like new Mercedes and um you own with
[00:10:15] the red button I like it red button in
[00:10:18] the Blue Book uh he let me drive in his
[00:10:20] Mercedes and one of the things he told
[00:10:22] me was you can't think of everything the
[00:10:24] same when you're looking at something it
[00:10:26] depends on how you look at it if you
[00:10:28] want to be a person that has money
[00:10:30] you can't look at it as what you're
[00:10:31] going to do for fun out of it you always
[00:10:33] have to look at as what value does it
[00:10:34] have for you and that's kind of how the
[00:10:36] way some people look at things and he's
[00:10:37] like I look at it that way but I also
[00:10:38] remember I have a family and is it the
[00:10:40] value for my family or is it a value for
[00:10:42] money and which way do I want to be
[00:10:44] going with things that's and for me I'd
[00:10:47] be value with money and family is more
[00:10:48] for me is family so that's why I do
[00:10:51] these things because they're family all
[00:10:52] right Marin so you got the blue book

[00:34:05] these regularly but in between the
[00:34:07] giveaways it'll be like maybe a pack of

[00:34:13] will be a sealed item or something or
[00:34:14] maybe it will be a vault pack or
[00:34:16] something like that but uh what we're
[00:34:18] thinking about doing stuff like that
[00:34:19] what do you guys
[00:34:21] think visual
[00:34:23] Pro than you guys uh that's a good idea
[00:34:27] we we can get get some more people in
[00:34:28] hanging out doing stuff and then uh up
[00:34:30] our atie in a way and I was actually
[00:34:32] thinking about taking one of our
[00:34:34] original games that I had that they told
[00:34:36] me I can't do because it was considered
[00:34:38] a gambling but if I do it as a giveaway
[00:34:40] it's okay to do so I was thinking of
[00:34:42] taking one of those out and um doing one
[00:34:45] of
[00:34:46] those uh as a giveaway potentially too
[00:34:49] let's do um some Adventure weight in our

[00:45:39] put out high
[00:45:42] low let's put on high low for a minute I
[00:45:45] made some updates and I paid some better
[00:45:47] uh I paid attention to what I have so uh
[00:45:50] maybe uh that wasn't supposed to be that
[00:45:53] supposed to be low D need three high and
[00:45:56] three low so what I was planning on
[00:45:58] doing I was going to do it tomorrow and
[00:46:00] I have a little bit of a different way
[00:46:02] of doing this instead of high low my son
[00:46:04] came up with a game that we're going to
[00:46:05] do so we have two new games kind of
[00:46:07] we're going to be premiering
[00:46:09] tomorrow but that's also for a whatnot
[00:46:12] conon we're going to do these special
[00:46:13] shows that's why we try to do a special
[00:46:15] thing every now and again so we're going
[00:46:17] to do this and we're going to play high
[00:46:18] low here for a minute and this is what
[00:46:20] we're going to do I'm going to let those
[00:46:23] dry while I pick
[00:46:25] out what we're going to do
[00:46:31] here all right that's what I'm going to
[00:46:33] do pick out what we're going to put
[00:46:36] on put
[00:46:41] that
[00:46:44] that in
[00:46:47] that that's what we're putting out there
[00:46:50] all right I can do
[00:46:55] that
[00:46:58] all right we can do
[00:47:01] those put those ones out and that's now
[00:47:04] dry so let's grab these and put them
[00:47:06] over here that way we can do that and my
[00:47:09] son said he wanted to help and make some
[00:47:12] things the other day to help with us so
[00:47:14] I let
[00:47:15] him and
[00:47:18] again he uh he helped found some fun
[00:47:21] thing did something fun for us
[00:47:23] so we're going to do
[00:47:25] this
[00:47:27] there's one of our
[00:47:37] singles here is the second of our
[00:47:40] singles said he wanted to help out so
[00:47:42] he's like what can I do I'm like you
[00:47:44] know what how about like can you help me
[00:47:45] with some something to get the cards to
[00:47:46] stand up nicely and he goes yeah I can
[00:47:49] do that with Legos like you know what
[00:47:51] that's a good
[00:47:54] idea going to put that up there
[00:48:01] here we go and here is his uh his help
[00:48:04] that he did so you're gonna move these
[00:48:06] over here you
[00:48:08] go you
[00:48:11] go said he wanted help and there he goes
[00:48:13] he decided he could
[00:48:14] help so there we are we're going to do
[00:48:17] our high low each of these are going to
[00:48:20] go on for a dollar all right each of
[00:48:23] these are going to go on for a dollar
[00:48:25] you're going to get your chance of
[00:48:26] getting one of them you pick one you
[00:48:28] pick one of these is how high low goes
[00:48:31] then that's the card that you take home
[00:48:32] because that's whatever one you want you
[00:48:34] can bid it up higher than a darl if you
[00:48:35] want want some of the other cards here
[00:48:37] I'm going to go through other ones and
[00:48:38] then afterwards we do a little roll here
[00:48:40] and we roll how many times you get high
[00:48:42] low correct because on the back of these
[00:48:44] it says high or low on them whichever
[00:48:46] ones you get accurate and with your
[00:48:48] 50/50 chot we roll and if U that many
[00:48:52] times and that is the strength that you
[00:48:53] get to go up against the boss is the
[00:48:55] highest strength of six which gives you
[00:48:57] the ability to beat five 50% of the
[00:48:59] bosses so that's our little high low I'm
[00:49:02] going to start our our thing here with
[00:49:04] these three for the first ones that are
[00:49:06] out here starting out it's going to go
[00:49:09] out for one let me zoom in here for you
[00:49:14] all here we
[00:49:16] go those are the three that are on there
[00:49:20] let me do this let's move it a little
[00:49:21] bit forward so we can see him
[00:49:25] better there you go dollar for any of
[00:49:34] those and see if we can see them
[00:49:38] better then you do the adventure then
[00:49:41] you also get to uh we roll the dice
[00:49:45] there Jack Frost which one do you want

[00:02:32] two three we'll start off with something

[00:02:36] and you know
[00:02:37] what let's do a pack
[00:02:41] deal did they put one of those ones in

[00:02:45] with multiple of those I know somebody
[00:02:47] did where are they maybe I have the
[00:02:50] wrong
[00:02:52] one one two
[00:02:54] three one two three I think it may be
[00:02:57] this
[00:02:58] one no
[00:03:06] is it that
[00:03:09] one I think it was this one here we go
[00:03:12] here we go we're going to start off
[00:03:14] with some collector booster I mean you
[00:03:18] know maybe that's not all you want we
[00:03:19] got to do some collector some ixon and a
[00:03:21] little dragons there how's the Big Blue
[00:03:24] Book doing yes no one's really going for
[00:03:27] it for some reason it's interesting
[00:03:29] though
[00:03:30] I mean um I was going to show it off
[00:03:31] here once I had the pack deal running up
[00:03:33] on the screen but um I thought the big
[00:03:35] blue book was a good deal because you
[00:03:37] get packs and stuff like that at the
[00:03:38] same time but maybe I was maybe I was uh
[00:03:40] mistaken on what people looking for but
[00:03:42] give me a second and I'll put this pack
[00:03:44] deal on screen we're GNA do this
[00:03:50] for uh
[00:03:55] oh well there we go three packs on
[00:03:58] screen here we go let's started off this
[00:04:00] morning with
[00:04:02] this from I think this is
[00:04:08] Nolan oh no problem I don't mind it dupe
[00:04:11] no worries at all no worries at all but
[00:04:14] I was gonna I supposed to put this on
[00:04:15] for a little bit longer but I have this
[00:04:17] thing here these are the three packs on
[00:04:18] screen right now picked out by uh I
[00:04:20] think that's a Nolan pick yeah that's a
[00:04:22] Nolan pick then here we go this is our
[00:04:24] big blue book that I have it's a new uh
[00:04:25] new kind of pull box in a way but it's
[00:04:27] in a book form there's $1,800 kind of
[00:04:29] this stuff there were 81 spots there's
[00:04:31] been 30 uh three of them pulled so it's
[00:04:33] down to 78 out of those two out of the
[00:04:36] 17 floors that were hit possibly could
[00:04:39] be hit two of them already hit now the
[00:04:41] ceiling is 90 the floors are between 11
[00:04:44] and $20 and the average is around uh
[00:04:48] $22 okay so what I'm going to show off
[00:04:51] here is in the book these are the cards
[00:04:53] that you can get things like pack
[00:04:54] negation mon drain but say you pull out
[00:04:56] something that was like an auton Soldier
[00:04:59] surge foil not a bad card to pull out to
[00:05:01] use but since it is under $10 you
[00:05:04] actually get a choice of one of these
[00:05:08] packs of cards also all right if it's
[00:05:12] under $10 now if it happens to be under
[00:05:15] $5 and you get unlucky where you get one
[00:05:18] that's under $5 but it's still a card
[00:05:19] that you kind of could use say maybe
[00:05:21] you're looking for um you know Mystic
[00:05:23] rora up here in the corner here that
[00:05:26] could help you out but it's only six uh
[00:05:27] it's I mean under five pre beard under
[00:05:30] five maybe looking at the tree beard
[00:05:32] that's what you happen to get unlucky on
[00:05:33] now I have a bunch of pages I'll show
[00:05:34] you all you're going to get two of these
[00:05:37] packs
[00:05:38] or a collector booster of Forgotten
[00:05:41] Realms your choice but what is in here
[00:05:44] so you guys see this is what we have in
[00:05:47] our book saw that first page this is
[00:05:50] what we kind of got in here some good
[00:05:52] stuff uh sherod a little
[00:05:56] uh blood Crypt retro
[00:06:01] ristic study watery
[00:06:06] grave Bin's
[00:06:09] tomb watery grave retro
[00:06:13] foil
[00:06:15] so there you go that's what you see
[00:06:17] there and as you can see like this is
[00:06:18] like this right here watery I mean
[00:06:20] Overgrown Tomb right now Overgrown Tomb
[00:06:23] right here at the top that is one of
[00:06:26] your floors because it's between 11 and
[00:06:27] $20 so that's what you have for like a
[00:06:30] floor so yeah that's the big blue book

[00:22:42] 198
[00:22:44] foil 198
[00:22:47] foil yeah no
[00:22:54] problem looks like it changed a little
[00:22:56] bit though it already went
[00:22:59] down already went down it looks all
[00:23:01] right $10 for the foil L say so it looks
[00:23:04] like it already changed it's hard to
[00:23:07] know with these new ones they change
[00:23:09] daily but that's what we got there for
[00:23:12] our uh our
[00:23:14] stuff they change so quick it's hard to
[00:23:16] know so it looks like it's down to $10
[00:23:18] now but
[00:23:20] anyways all
[00:23:22] righty I hate that it's like uh somebody
[00:23:25] somebody said it the other day it's like
[00:23:26] the price of gold they fluctuate so fast
[00:23:29] that you have a hard time you can't even
[00:23:30] follow it you might as well you need to

[00:24:58] any
[00:25:04] here 48 for the last Commander Master oh
[00:25:09] I don't know if I can do
[00:25:11] that let me double check
[00:25:15] here I don't think I
[00:25:21] can let me double check
[00:25:23] here I don't think that's
[00:25:26] possible no I cannot do that the lowest
[00:25:30] I mean I I really have it on pretty low
[00:25:32] there
[00:25:35] um because that's kind of compared to my
[00:25:37] cost that is like my cost if you if I
[00:25:39] did that so let me see if I could
[00:25:46] do got my case of it and pulled four
[00:25:50] four invisible ink nice dude from a
[00:25:54] case ice cream man give me a second here
[00:25:56] I'll let you know I could do
[00:26:03] to I can really I can really only go
[00:26:05] down like a
[00:26:07] dollar because of
[00:26:11] uh how's this if you want is there a let
[00:26:16] me put on a pack deal here with that
[00:26:18] let's see or is it just you just want
[00:26:20] that one
[00:26:22] pack because if I I can do sometimes a
[00:26:24] little bit better here and help uh do
[00:26:26] this with a pack if you want something
[00:26:28] because a
[00:26:29] uh let me try this here let me try this
[00:26:33] here maybe you'll want
[00:26:35] this here we go this is the last
[00:26:39] one that's the last one let me do this
[00:26:44] mystery and one of the plays because if
[00:26:47] I do something like that I could do
[00:26:51] um sorry thinking brain is on fire at
[00:26:55] the
[00:26:56] moment
[00:27:10] okay I can do something like
[00:27:13] this for these
[00:27:16] three oh just one all
[00:27:19] right yeah I could do uh I could go down
[00:27:21] like I could go down uh to 51 really a
[00:27:24] dollar only I can only can't go down too
[00:27:25] much that's why I have the Pack deals
[00:27:26] the way I have them set up where I can
[00:27:28] add multiple them together and drop it
[00:27:29] down because like the fees of whatnot um
[00:27:32] so I can only really go down like a
[00:27:34] dollar on that so I can get not so I'm
[00:27:35] not hitting my cost but um if you want
[00:27:38] to pack you on any of these anybody
[00:27:40] would like to try it out they can that's
[00:27:42] why I try to do multiple things at once
[00:27:45] a lot of times because um if I do one of
[00:27:48] them the fee the fee and the percentage
[00:27:51] and everything that they take out hits
[00:27:53] me probably kind of big but if I do
[00:27:55] multiple of them it's not considered per
[00:27:57] each sale that I get the fee taken out
[00:28:00] is per one sale so like that's why I'm
[00:28:02] able to do kind of deals and and drop it
[00:28:03] down a little bit that's why I'm saying
[00:28:05] like I can help out sometimes when we do
[00:28:07] multiple things because like what it
[00:28:09] would be is like instead of this is like
[00:28:12] having it on here it's like a it's like
[00:28:13] a$3 fee on some of this so like and then
[00:28:16] a couple dollars and I'm able to take
[00:28:18] that money off when I do multiple of
[00:28:20] them instead of having just that $3 fee
[00:28:22] on one $3 fee on each one or not $3 on
[00:28:24] that one it would be like $2 on whatever
[00:28:26] on this one or $4 yeah $3 on whatever $4
[00:28:29] on that one and I think it's whatever my
[00:28:31] point is they take the fee Out and
[00:28:34] because of having it together you only
[00:28:36] get one fee out and it's almost like you
[00:28:37] take the one big fee out and that's it
[00:28:39] and the other ones aren't a fee because
[00:28:41] of how small they are and it's kind of
[00:28:43] nice to be able to do stuff like that
[00:28:44] with you guys that's why I'm able to
[00:28:46] help out when I do multiple things at
[00:28:47] once that's kind of just my little
[00:28:49] explanation of it if that makes sense I
[00:28:51] don't
[00:28:53] know I try to put everything on as low
[00:28:55] as possible for as what I get it that's
[00:28:57] why I uh to can't do much when it comes
[00:29:00] to a
[00:29:00] single yeah so yeah it's the way that
[00:29:03] they do that that's why I try to I try
[00:29:05] to do pack deals on a regular basis
[00:29:07] because I can do them a little bit more
[00:29:08] of a better deal than it is uh just
[00:29:11] individually but let's see if I can
[00:29:13] throw something else on that is someone
[00:29:15] else is interested in but uh yeah ice
[00:29:17] cream man if there's something else that
[00:29:18] you want maybe um multiples of anything
[00:29:20] say like somebody's somebody's done
[00:29:21] before with like hey yo can I get some
[00:29:22] doctor
[00:29:23] PS um can I get a single and can I get a
[00:29:27] p and I'm like yeah that's fine because
[00:29:28] that's three things together that um
[00:29:32] rather than me having to pay three
[00:29:33] separate fees I only got to pay kind of
[00:29:35] one so that's
[00:29:37] why things like that even people do I've
[00:29:39] had people do before so we'll
[00:29:42] see let me do this for you guys I'm
[00:29:44] gonna throw on a pack deal then I'm
[00:29:47] gonna SE off some of the singles that we
[00:29:52] have some of the singles that we
[00:29:56] have
[00:29:59] H let's do this I'm missing it stinks
[00:30:02] because I'm missing all my aoria it got
[00:30:05] set shipped to the wrong location so I
[00:30:07] had to have it shipped back to me to the
[00:30:09] right location so I am now currently
[00:30:12] missing all of my
[00:30:14] Coria which really really
[00:30:16] stinks because it's making everything go
[00:30:18] a little bit slower than I wanted on
[00:30:20] some of this because I would have had
[00:30:21] some ioria collector boosters to put in
[00:30:23] with all this I mean not ioria I mean um
[00:30:26] Exelon
[00:30:28] Exon I have my I got the ioria stuff in
[00:30:30] we have some murders collector booster
[00:30:33] lost caverns and ioria there because
[00:30:36] that's why I was saying ioria because my
[00:30:38] brain was looking looking for one of
[00:30:39] them that's how it works in the morning
[00:30:42] right your brain's
[00:30:44] broken that way you have to uh say
[00:30:47] random things until you get it correct

[00:30:49] bit anybody like that we guys got plan

[00:43:40] pack deal for you guys he picks three
[00:43:42] packs we do them kind of like a bunch of
[00:43:43] them and he does three packs in a row
[00:43:45] for us this is one of the ones he
[00:43:47] picked no there is no invisible ink on
[00:43:50] this card I was checking for it but one
[00:43:53] of the things that I have a hard time
[00:43:55] with is you you'd see
[00:43:57] the Ripple right all I see is like this
[00:43:59] weird print here on the
[00:44:02] sides like that print and that print but
[00:44:05] I think that's part of the regular
[00:44:07] foil because I think the invisible ink
[00:44:10] is supposed to be all across it from my
[00:44:14] understanding but we got some more Bo
[00:44:17] packs in that box we'll be looking
[00:44:19] through those there yeah I don't think
[00:44:21] that's the invisible ink one I think
[00:44:22] you're supposed to see something more on
[00:44:25] it
[00:44:31] and we're going to put this on for a
[00:44:32] pack deal for you guys if you want it
[00:44:35] this
[00:44:41] morning yeah words written on it that's
[00:44:43] what I thought I thought it had words or
[00:44:44] something written on it that's our pack
[00:44:46] deal right there and right now we're
[00:44:48] just putting away some of the sleeving
[00:44:49] up some of the cards that we pulled out
[00:44:51] but like I said to everyone before if
[00:44:53] there is something that you want out
[00:44:54] that we cracked here maybe uh maybe
[00:44:56] there's a single that you like let me
[00:44:58] know we can uh get that out there for
[00:45:01] sale for you I know somebody was asking
[00:45:02] for a doel ganger earlier all right cool
[00:45:05] thank you Mizel I appreciate that yeah I
[00:45:08] know I that's what I thought it had
[00:45:10] words written on it when I was at a
[00:45:11] pre-release last night um he said they
[00:45:14] pulled one out and he kept asking and I
[00:45:16] opened a couple packs from them and he
[00:45:17] oh is that a pre is that a is that an
[00:45:19] invisible ink is that invisible in so
[00:45:22] well I see

[00:59:08] pulled there's a ceiling of $90 which is
[00:59:10] a baing tomb cars between 11 $20 those
[00:59:12] are what are considered the floor all

[00:59:54] back in in
[00:59:55] there and it's just whatever number is

[01:23:34] people every single
[01:23:37] show that was not from the big blue book
[01:23:40] no he just uh we did um three packs on
[01:23:43] screen that was a random three packs on
[01:23:45] screen
[01:23:46] actually that was a random three packs
[01:23:49] on
[01:23:50] screen the Big Blue Book does does not
[01:23:52] have the ability to get a collector
[01:23:54] booster out you know what how's this
[01:23:59] sound oh nice you have four different
[01:24:01] ones I have an
[01:24:03] idea instead of taking the spots
[01:24:09] away I'm going to put
[01:24:13] in every spot that gets pulled I'm going
[01:24:16] to put in a collector
[01:24:17] booster of murders instead in place what
[01:24:20] do you think about that guys
[01:24:25] actually going to end up bumping that
[01:24:26] box up worth more that that that big
[01:24:29] blue book is going to be worth more what
[01:24:30] do you think do you think that is a good
[01:24:33] idea so from now on instead
[01:24:37] of instead of pulling it out I'll pull
[01:24:40] the card out but every card that gets
[01:24:42] pulled out gets replaced with a murders
[01:24:44] of
[01:24:46] Carlo Manor merge at Carlo Manor
[01:24:50] Pat oh I think that's what I'm going to
[01:24:52] do here you know what let me let
[01:24:57] me do that here every blank spot is a
[01:25:01] Murders At Carlo of Manor collector
[01:25:04] booster all right guys give me one
[01:25:07] second here let me

[01:25:12] pull out the whole thing here with all
[01:25:14] of them in with rather than having a

[01:25:22] that a
[01:25:24] lot I like that a lot that's what we're

[01:29:49] hit so you say you hit number nine
[01:29:51] you're going to get yourself a Murders

[01:30:18] more pages in here but it's uh number
[01:30:20] five and you're under $5
[01:30:22] well you get a choice of one of these I
[01:30:25] mean two of these four packs or you get
[01:30:29] yourself a Mystery Pack or a Dungeons
[01:30:33] and Dragons Forgotten Realms collector
[01:30:35] booster it's your choice on whichever

[01:33:10] have and I have been opening uh packs of
[01:33:13] cards here so if there happens to be one
[01:33:14] that you
[01:33:15] want that we opened let us know any
[01:33:19] card I I'll put that back
[01:33:22] that was a that was an expensive
[01:33:23] Saturday morning that was a maybe I'm
[01:33:26] still drunk and want to try to get
[01:33:27] something I guess all right we're going
[01:33:29] to put on a pack deal for you guys and
[01:33:30] then I'm gonna go through some singles
[01:33:32] that's what we're gonna do I'm gonna do
[01:33:36] murders we're going to do
[01:33:39] murders with a play
[01:33:42] booster
[01:33:45] and
[01:33:47] this mystery that's what we're going to
[01:33:50] do here all right that's going to be our
[01:33:52] pack deal right now for those that want
[01:33:54] it and let me know if you are
[01:33:58] interested all right oh that's gonna be
[01:34:00] a good pack deal that's a good pack deal
[01:34:04] I wanted me to put it on for 45 and I
[01:34:05] said no we're doing it for that all
[01:34:07] right here are my singles that we pulled
[01:34:09] out some let's go through some of these
[01:34:11] and if you are
[01:34:12] interested let us
[01:34:15] know there's that now remember singles
[01:34:20] they fluctuate like gold
[01:34:22] the price of them is what I pulled out
[01:34:23] of the pack so kind of ignore it because
[01:34:26] we just go and check it after but what
[01:34:29] we do here is um tell me what one you
[01:34:31] want I put your name on it I'm put it
[01:34:33] off to the side and then we uh either
[01:34:36] tally it up at the end of the show or I
[01:34:39] um Can tally it up when you have to head
[01:34:41] out and now what we'll do is we'll just
[01:34:43] go and look at tcg and see kind of where
[01:34:46] the prices of them are just because how
[01:34:48] they fluctuate like I said it's hard
[01:34:49] like one of these ones used to be like
[01:34:51] $7 and it went down to six like Kai
[01:34:54] Tyrant used to be 12 and it went down so
[01:34:56] like I had to adjust some of them
[01:34:57] already but um I haven't adjusted them
[01:35:00] in probably about few weeks though so
[01:35:02] those are what we have there for some
[01:35:03] singles if you want
[01:35:05] them which Jazelle was at front that was
[01:35:10] the um Extended art one 60
[01:35:14] 682 682 extended
[01:35:17] art you want it all right there we go
[01:35:21] I'll put that off to the side with your
[01:35:23] name on it stretch there you
[01:35:27] are let me uh let me do
[01:35:31] that put you in this little thing
[01:35:34] here and then if there's anything else
[01:35:36] like we always do we'll uh get you set
[01:35:39] up with something else after if there's
[01:35:41] something else that you want because the
[01:35:43] way we do it here with the singles is I
[01:35:46] try to do it so I put them off the side
[01:35:47] with your name on it and at the end of
[01:35:48] the show we tally them up or when you
[01:35:50] have to head out that that way you're
[01:35:52] not um paying like multiple shipping
[01:35:54] fees you know kind of I feel bad when I
[01:35:57] try to I try to help everybody out as
[01:35:59] best I can and even when I help you guys
[01:36:01] out it ends up helping me out because I
[01:36:02] don't have to pay the fees

[01:55:26] attached to a credit card but not really
[01:55:27] in my account and I had to call and have

[01:55:46] a headache you know but if you want any
[01:55:49] of these cards let me know remember the
[01:55:50] prices on them uh fluctuate like gold so
[01:55:53] that's what I put on them when I pulled

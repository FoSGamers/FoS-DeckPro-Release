[00:45:49] right left right left Port starboard

[00:46:15] out next for this that's what I'll do
[00:46:17] I'll grab the Assassin's Creed
[00:46:20] bundle Assassin's Creed I always like
[00:46:22] playing that
[00:46:24] game oh no worries my friend not a worry
[00:46:27] at all don't ever worry you don't really
[00:46:29] apologize well actually you can
[00:46:30] apologize if you're you're mean now the
[00:46:32] only time you need to apologize to
[00:46:33] anything Phantom Blade axio day I think
[00:46:38] it's damos of
[00:46:40] Cosmos all right abar Mir Abazar
[00:46:44] Mir nice swamp that's the first swamp
[00:46:47] I've seen I like that with the that's a
[00:46:50] city is a well I guess the B dungeon the
[00:46:52] bottoms of the city kind of is like a
[00:46:54] swamp what must be done AC
[00:46:57] R1 nice rare there ooh Royal assassin
[00:47:01] foil ACR
[00:47:04] 93 with a l Lita f frier Lita frer ACR
[00:47:12] 149 with a the
[00:47:15] capital capitaline r Ty Triad for your
[00:47:18] uh token there that actually might be
[00:47:21] I'm wondering if some of these tokens
[00:47:23] might be worth something at some point
[00:47:24] because the art on the tokens themselves
[00:47:25] are really sweet
[00:47:28] Assassin's Creed seven card packs yeah I
[00:47:30] know hey but let ready they are $8
[00:47:33] instead of like the the
[00:47:35] 1213 that the other packs are and the
[00:47:38] other thing is a lot of the people don't
[00:47:40] like the bulk of that like Just Junk the
[00:47:42] commons I mean think of it I'll say this
[00:47:44] Frank has been saying hey just take the
[00:47:45] commons I don't need all of them unless
[00:47:47] he specifically wants one because he
[00:47:49] doesn't need all of them and it's just
[00:47:50] adds to is just kind of bulk of stuff so
[00:47:52] you don't get them here and you get it
[00:47:53] for a cheaper price so it's you know it
[00:47:55] kind of works out and away if you want
[00:47:58] to if you're just not looking for your
[00:47:59] you know if you're looking for
[00:48:00] everything that's not the bulk stuff DOL
[00:48:03] if that makes any sense
[00:48:05] sense I mean if it was like a $15
[00:48:09] pack and you were getting that many
[00:48:11] cards yes I can see that I can see
[00:48:14] that and our giveaway went to the nine
[00:48:17] volt and I needed type SLG for me and
[00:48:20] you got it oh look at that a Razer field
[00:48:23] Ripper nice one there yeah you don't see
[00:48:26] bulk
[00:48:31] exactly CU that's what I've been
[00:48:33] noticing right now when I've been
[00:48:35] opening these I'm like oh it's all
[00:48:36] starts at um uncommon all right so
[00:48:38] there's no Commons at all in there all
[00:48:45] right all right now I need a number from
[00:48:48] you my friend so we know which one we're

[02:46:59] people do trading on here all the time
[02:47:01] like if they buy something and they open
[02:47:03] a pack and they you know what I don't
[02:47:04] ask I need that but somebody opens a
[02:47:05] different pack that they want and they
[02:47:07] have something they want hey can I trade
[02:47:08] that for you and they'll trade
[02:47:09] regularly $8 for a Beyond pack for w
[02:47:13] just for the yes it's kind of like a
[02:47:15] draft pack in a way yes so here we go
[02:47:19] we'll throw those out
[02:47:20] there for you
[02:47:26] here Beyond is like a draft kind of it's
[02:47:29] like the play booster draft the only
[02:47:30] thing difference is you don't get the
[02:47:31] commons so there's less cards in it but
[02:47:34] you just don't get the commons with a
[02:47:35] bulk stuff you get more of you get
[02:47:37] uncommons and rares only which is why we
[02:47:39] do which is why they have it as know a
[02:47:40] little bit lower price because you don't
[02:47:42] have as many of them which is kind of
[02:47:43] cool I like that less cards and
[02:47:45] everything but it gives you like
[02:47:47] uncommons rares instead of a bunch
[02:47:49] un of Commons that you generally don't
[02:47:51] use and they become bulk that you either
[02:47:53] to throw
[02:47:54] away so it's kind of it's kind of cool
[02:47:56] how they do that so you have one of
[02:48:00] these three and then I have a whole new
[02:48:01] box over there too but which one of
[02:48:03] these three would you like to go with it
[02:48:05] is small it is a very small set
[02:48:08] true the mid one yes you may take that

[03:03:05] had a surgery for those of you that hang
[03:03:07] out no I had some bad luck H was about
[03:03:11] about two years ago now a bad surgery
[03:03:14] where a doctor stitched
[03:03:18] the outside of my col to the inside
[03:03:22] causing it to go through a nerve so um I
[03:03:24] am very sensitive in that area now

[00:01:44] going to go and check uh where my
[00:01:46] glasses are so I can hopefully see
[00:01:47] actually I might need to put my
[00:01:48] sunglasses
[00:01:57] on sunglasses
[00:02:02] I'm actually bring my sunglasses over
[00:02:04] cuz the sun is directly in my face and I
[00:02:07] have a feeling I'm going to need to wear
[00:02:08] those for a little bit here until the
[00:02:09] sun adjusts and I'll send you guys a
[00:02:12] picture of the Sun so you can see what
[00:02:14] it looks like right
[00:02:15] now hopefully you're all having a good
[00:02:17] morning
[00:02:19] here look I can look up a little bit
[00:02:21] better now
[00:02:23] aha this is what I got going in my face
[00:02:26] right now this is what the problem is
[00:02:27] didn't didn't sit down here right away
[00:02:30] to even notice what the problem could
[00:02:31] have
[00:02:33] been let's
[00:02:50] see why does it always do that I thought
[00:02:53] I already said it to the this but
[00:02:55] here you put that there
[00:03:00] let's see that way you can kind of see
[00:03:02] what I've been I'm staring at here while
[00:03:04] I'm
[00:03:10] blinded
[00:03:12] there the camo now you can see why I've
[00:03:15] been blinded here trying to figure out
[00:03:18] why I can't see I have sunglasses on
[00:03:20] that's what's staring me in the face
[00:03:21] right
[00:03:22] now see there you go there's your reason
[00:03:25] why
[00:03:31] that's what's going on with the
[00:03:33] Sun for me right there at the
[00:03:36] moment now I'm going to move that away
[00:03:39] put that back there you go we'll have
[00:03:41] some fun this morning check uh do some
[00:03:43] streaming for some stuff here and uh see
[00:03:46] what's going on there some people I
[00:03:47] think getting ready to go fishing
[00:03:48] waiting for their people to show up
[00:03:50] because a lot where we are is like a
[00:03:52] large Marina so I'm guessing they're
[00:03:53] waiting for some people to show up right
[00:03:55] now do some fishing or something like
[00:03:57] that cuz I know see I see it going
[00:03:59] happen all the time I've actually
[00:04:00] debated on like if I was ever going to
[00:04:01] be back here for an extended period of
[00:04:03] time they get some pretty nice boats to
[00:04:04] do that
[00:04:06] with but anyways that's why I'm bright
[00:04:09] so much sun in my eyes right now can you
[00:04:11] guys hear me all right hopefully you
[00:04:13] can hopefully you all can hear
[00:04:15] me I should be running over there all
[00:04:18] right

[00:04:23] here ba it on like if I was ever going
[00:04:26] to be back here for an extended period
[00:04:27] of time oh my God

[00:08:27] of people to show up for for uh their
[00:08:30] boat or
[00:08:32] something that's what my guess would be
[00:08:44] right wow the sun is beating in my
[00:08:49] eye right now it is directly in my eyes
[00:08:52] I got about probably 10 minutes until
[00:08:54] it's above the part on the um like the I
[00:08:59] shade what you call that right yeah
[00:09:04] shade that we have in the front of the
[00:09:06] boat once you get us above there I'll be
[00:09:07] all right but right now it's just like
[00:09:09] you can see it's directly in my
[00:09:11] face all right what are you guys
[00:09:13] thinking here today we have all of our
[00:09:15] adventure things we have our encounters
[00:09:17] for those that want to try and this I
[00:09:19] might I actually added in
[00:09:21] two um play boosters instead of two
[00:09:23] packs instead of one so what you have is
[00:09:25] you're going to have an opportunity when
[00:09:27] you go if you happen to get one of them
[00:09:28] that's a play booster that says the pack
[00:09:30] Choice I'm going to pull out some of
[00:09:32] these and you'll get an option of one of
[00:09:35] them to choose from and be like
[00:09:37] whichever one you like pretty much is
[00:09:39] what you're going to be able to take
[00:09:41] there and uh they're all going to be in
[00:09:44] the
[00:09:45] same price range but it's allowing you
[00:09:47] to pick out some uh hats there it is
[00:09:50] that's the one I was looking for there
[00:09:52] you go one two so you go it'll be like
[00:09:54] here you go I'll show these I don't know
[00:09:55] if I all foundations but you'll get a
[00:09:57] choice of any of these here if you
[00:10:00] happen to one hey the one that gets uh
[00:10:01] the choice of packs if not you're going
[00:10:03] to get a sign just a signed card so you
[00:10:05] can
[00:10:07] play oh how much snowman that sounds if
[00:10:11] you canceled work that's got to be a
[00:10:12] decent amount of snow well I mean I know
[00:10:14] you said you have to um with you it's
[00:10:16] like you guys do the cement pouring and
[00:10:17] everything so it takes a little like the
[00:10:18] snow can definitely screw all that up oh
[00:10:20] wow directly turning into my eyes right
[00:10:22] now what is going
[00:10:23] on it's like the sun decided directly
[00:10:26] sign shine right in my face but anyways
[00:10:28] we'll start one here see if any wants to
[00:10:31] try a little quick
[00:10:32] encounter and I'm going to open up
[00:10:35] uh I'll open up another one of these
[00:10:37] packs from our Infinity to see if we're
[00:10:39] lucky enough today to get another shock
[00:10:41] land now where did I put my Infinity
[00:10:43] packs aha it's those up there they're
[00:10:46] right above us now we'll keep adding
[00:10:49] them over here cuz this is what we'll
[00:10:51] use for kind of like giveway things
[00:10:52] we'll do at some
[00:10:56] point ah well there you go that Mak
[00:10:59] makes sense too I like that see that's
[00:11:02] the thing that uh my dad used to do
[00:11:03] plowing and I used to actually go out
[00:11:04] and help him um in the winters when I
[00:11:07] got old enough cuz uh and then he'd help
[00:11:10] me he'd he'd pay me too cuz I i' keep
[00:11:12] one keep him awake two sometimes I'd
[00:11:14] drive the truck when we're not plowing
[00:11:16] from place to place that way he could
[00:11:17] take a nap or something if we had to go
[00:11:19] from one place to another and it was
[00:11:20] going to be 10 or 15 minutes um I don't
[00:11:22] know that's how he
[00:11:24] functioned oh my God he's like I'm
[00:11:26] exactly like him when it comes to naps
[00:11:31] well that's weird no it isn't you would
[00:11:33] expect that I guess damn
[00:11:37] it
[00:11:40] yeah s like realizing I think I'm
[00:11:42] exactly I I take naps all the time
[00:11:44] now all right let's see what we get
[00:11:49] here how's it going everyone this
[00:11:51] morning hope you're having a good day we
[00:11:52] have a dissatisfied customer focus F fun
[00:11:57] ulist we have a now you see
[00:11:59] the Rockstar nearby Planet chicken
[00:12:05] troop come on let's get this slight
[00:12:09] malfunction disc courtesy
[00:12:12] clerk Park
[00:12:14] re-entry Ambassador blury
[00:12:18] blurp o CBR ,000 that's a nice little
[00:12:21] pick out there and a forest oh I like
[00:12:24] that Forest that's a nice looking car
[00:12:25] there with a foam weapons kiosk
[00:12:29] scavenger hunt and the
[00:12:32] stickers yeah not bad for the forest in
[00:12:35] the uh Cel that's not a bad
[00:12:37] pickup yeah so that's why I was you know
[00:12:40] I get paid a little bit for him but he
[00:12:41] uh he because being on the fishing he
[00:12:43] sometimes he in the winter when um he
[00:12:47] wasn't able to go out fishing for some
[00:12:48] reason or another he'd uh
[00:12:51] plow he used to have a truck that had a
[00:12:53] plow with it then it went to like you
[00:12:55] plowed for a friend of theirs blah blah
[00:12:56] blah blah blah type thing
[00:12:59] either way wasn't bad I learned how to
[00:13:01] plow if I needed to
[00:13:03] though never actually needed to do that
[00:13:07] luckily didn't let didn't have that as a
[00:13:10] have to go out in the cold and do that
[00:13:12] as as frequently as him that he did
[00:13:13] because we moved to the warm
[00:13:21] area all right so this is what I have up
[00:13:24] here right now this is the
[00:13:27] um I made we did something different
[00:13:29] here it's only three spots in this all
[00:13:32] right pack here is normally like
[00:13:35] a almost like a I
[00:13:38] know like a $50 pack put it all I think
[00:13:42] it's like $45 for the pack but anyways I
[00:13:44] put it all on there so you it equals out
[00:13:46] to
[00:13:47] whatever $40 whatever for the pack there
[00:13:51] all right
[00:13:53] now I'm going to do it the same way as I
[00:13:55] do all the other braks but I'm not going
[00:13:57] to put the sleeves on them as quickly
[00:13:58] I'm just going to take I'm going to
[00:14:00] shuffle them backwards okay so no one's
[00:14:02] fing each other like you can't see them
[00:14:04] and I'm going to be very gentle with it
[00:14:06] while I shuffle and then what I'll do is
[00:14:07] I'll go one two three one two three hand
[00:14:09] them out to each person and then as it
[00:14:12] happens you'll get uh whoever it is gets
[00:14:15] we'll flip them over you'll see what you
[00:14:16] get and we can play a little quick
[00:14:17] Adventure like we do with our things
[00:14:19] where maybe you're going to go after a
[00:14:20] feral ghoul I know maybe the gator Dow
[00:14:24] will come out towards you we don't
[00:14:27] know you'll have to help us figure
[00:14:29] figure it
[00:14:29] out well that is if you want to that is
[00:14:32] if you want
[00:14:33] to and let's do uh we have that is our
[00:14:38] fun one there then the other one that we
[00:14:40] have is our normal ones that we do as
[00:14:41] our brakes there and I have those for
[00:14:44] the virtual pull boxes and what I think
[00:14:46] I'm going to do now is we
[00:14:49] have these packs over here and we also
[00:14:52] have my Infinity we'll go back to that
[00:14:54] we'll open some of those and see what
[00:14:56] we're getting going on today
[00:15:00] all right oh didn't hit
[00:15:02] go on that and I did not hit go on that
[00:15:05] good thing I'm paying attention
[00:15:09] now that was sarcastic that was
[00:15:12] extremely
[00:15:13] sarcastic all right here we
[00:15:16] go let's close that so I don't have as
[00:15:18] much things
[00:15:20] running there we go let's see what we
[00:15:22] get out of this pack here yeah maybe
[00:15:24] you'll see us uh we'll be sailing around
[00:15:26] here at some point once my uh we get
[00:15:29] some a couple more things with
[00:15:30] provisioning here sailed all the way
[00:15:32] over tried to get you guys to see what
[00:15:33] we were doing but now I have the suction
[00:15:35] cups actually set up so the starlink for
[00:15:37] the most part can to be stay stay up as
[00:15:39] long as we're going to have like going a
[00:15:41] long sale but it'll stay up for the most
[00:15:43] part that way I don't have to take it up
[00:15:45] and down all the time trying to figure
[00:15:47] out a nicer way of putting the uh
[00:15:48] starlink though uh through the window
[00:15:50] for the connection cuz I don't want to
[00:15:52] like take the cable off and on I like
[00:15:54] putting it on through the window that
[00:15:56] way I can take it down if I really want
[00:15:57] to so I'm trying to figure out nicer way
[00:15:59] like right now it's just a bag taped
[00:16:01] around it what we're going to I was
[00:16:02] looking to get a um like make some of
[00:16:04] that tape stuff that you put on the
[00:16:05] Windows during winter time that uh is a
[00:16:08] clear tape I was thinking using some of
[00:16:09] that might work I don't know I don't
[00:16:11] know you guys have any ideas that would
[00:16:12] help I'd appreciate it but anyways right

[00:17:02] those stickers supposedly go for a few
[00:17:03] bucks I don't know that that's

[00:20:42] with a treasure token and the stickers
[00:20:44] there that wasn't a bad
[00:20:49] pack oh yeah well you know we've gotten
[00:20:53] down the lowest I remember getting like
[00:20:55] near me is probably like 15 Nega 20ish
[00:20:59] and that was that was only a couple
[00:21:00] times uh I mean if we went out if we
[00:21:02] went like you know like what what 15 20
[00:21:05] miles away from us was m Washington bird
[00:21:07] crow crows fly when we were in barington
[00:21:10] oh not Washington yeah I was like crows
[00:21:13] fly wait far than that are you sure by I
[00:21:16] know by Road it was no 50 Mi probably
[00:21:20] close to that all right maybe it was
[00:21:21] like 50 Mi away but we used I we've gone
[00:21:24] because it only took like a half hour or
[00:21:25] two no it only took like 45 minutes to
[00:21:27] get there hold it yes it did to get to
[00:21:29] the bottom of it it took like 45
[00:21:31] minutes that's why I thought that was
[00:21:33] closer but I might be wrong maybe it was
[00:21:35] 45 minutes with my
[00:21:37] driving maybe that's what it was maybe
[00:21:40] that's why I'm thinking it was so quick
[00:21:41] yeah that could have been what it is
[00:21:44] yeah but yeah we're by Mount Washington
[00:21:46] about 50 mies we'll give say and that
[00:21:48] was uh you know the coldest place on the
[00:21:50] planet supposedly
[00:21:54] there by like by Drive which is really a
[00:21:57] straight shot yeah 97 mil 2 hours and 20
[00:22:01] minutes H I feel like we were there in
[00:22:03] like 45 minutes before yeah I'm not
[00:22:05] really sure what part of the state you
[00:22:08] were in but that's a straight
[00:22:11] shot I feel like I got there in 45
[00:22:13] minutes more than
[00:22:15] once how about from Milton's not that
[00:22:17] much further away from the campground I
[00:22:19] think you're going to confused on the on
[00:22:21] the mountain je oh oh I'm thinking of
[00:22:23] going to uh where we weren't skiing huh
[00:22:26] how where's um cranmore how is it from
[00:22:28] crore from where we would have been
[00:22:29] would that been 45 minutes
[00:22:32] then barington yeah cuz then then it
[00:22:34] would have been 45 more minutes from
[00:22:35] there which would make sense to me now
[00:22:37] why I'm thinking about getting there in
[00:22:38] 45
[00:22:43] minutes sorry we're getting completely
[00:22:45] sidetracked right here this is this is
[00:22:48] what happens when you start talking to
[00:22:51] people 71 miles an hour and a half yeah
[00:22:54] 45 minutes sounds right then I got there
[00:22:56] around that time frame
[00:22:59] yeah we're going going up there with the
[00:23:00] with the fraternity to do the stuff
[00:23:03] remember we were racing to get up there
[00:23:05] who got there quickest and then I hit
[00:23:06] that area in about 45 minutes and that's
[00:23:08] why I remember that now and then I was
[00:23:10] thinking about from cranmore over we
[00:23:12] would have gone over to Mount Washington
[00:23:13] right which would have been the 45
[00:23:14] minute time frame I'm thinking probably
[00:23:16] this one what I'm trying to get at there
[00:23:18] was some place we left because we used
[00:23:20] to go over to over where Wendy had the
[00:23:22] place yeah yeah anyways I got Wicked
[00:23:26] Sidetrack there for a minute
[00:23:30] yeah and ater onac mountains all right
[00:23:32] all right yeah you definitely cold
[00:23:34] there yeah always on the
[00:23:38] grind but yeah again I'm trying to

[00:26:14] adventuring after and the other thing
[00:26:16] that I have set up is you know I set one
[00:26:18] up I was thinking some people like want
[00:26:20] to do some quick adventuring where you
[00:26:21] can uh maybe get some new things get
[00:26:24] some uh bump into some characters go
[00:26:25] some adventuring with your friends
[00:26:29] ooh archive I like it jumping in on it
[00:26:31] beautiful got spot number one that means
[00:26:34] there's five spots left the other thing
[00:26:36] that we did I made a new thing I don't
[00:26:37] know if it's going to work if you guys
[00:26:38] are going like it or not I'm going to
[00:26:39] call it the lightning Adventure break
[00:26:41] it's like a quick fire one that's why I
[00:26:42] have this right here in the way showing
[00:26:44] you not in the way showing you what that
[00:26:45] is that here will be what is broken
[00:26:48] between three people I'm going to pin
[00:26:49] that quickly so you can see it too but
[00:26:51] there $13 three people you get to do a
[00:26:54] quick break we'll do you know maybe
[00:26:55] you're going to run into one of the
[00:26:56] ghouls or maybe it's going to be more
[00:26:58] more than one ghoul and maybe you're
[00:26:59] going to run into uh oh I mean wrong one
[00:27:01] maybe you're going to have to go back to
[00:27:02] the crab room see some Treasures with
[00:27:05] your friends try to get some Treasures
[00:27:06] from the crab room or something but we
[00:27:09] got that one too which is a fun one and
[00:27:12] it does this same similar as we do all
[00:27:14] the ones but the only difference is we
[00:27:16] take all the cards in here we're going
[00:27:17] to shuffle them up gently and then I
[00:27:19] hand them out one at a time to the three
[00:27:21] people and that's what you get there and
[00:27:24] you do a little quick Adventure if you'd
[00:27:25] like to but I feel like we should do the
[00:27:27] full big one here today get a good
[00:27:29] Adventure going you guys can see what's
[00:27:31] coming up next with our uh with our
[00:27:32] characters
[00:27:34] here I think I have
[00:27:43] those there we
[00:27:45] go yeah let's us figure out what we're
[00:27:48] doing
[00:27:54] today no no worry no worries
[00:27:59] well if you would like to do any of that
[00:28:00] and like um oh like I said too before um
[00:28:02] you were in the thing the other day and
[00:28:04] I missed it so you missed it so I was
[00:28:06] letting you do a couple of them he's
[00:28:07] like hey house how's it
[00:28:11] going um so it depends AR Archer how
[00:28:15] many people are in there so if there's
[00:28:16] like two spots left in The Brak we'll
[00:28:19] run it and I'll just take two of the
[00:28:20] spots store wise as the store uh the
[00:28:23] leftover spots if there's more than that
[00:28:25] left at the end of the show I um will
[00:28:27] roll it over over to the next show um so
[00:28:29] if there's like three or more roll to
[00:28:31] the next show if there's two or less
[00:28:33] I'll I'll do it at the end when I plan
[00:28:35] on doing it to do the break and that way
[00:28:36] we can do the adventuring with it too
[00:28:38] and today like I said I have to be gone
[00:28:40] by like probably like 10:45 here so

[00:32:59] didn't see us on the motorcycle and try
[00:33:00] to go between these people that were
[00:33:02] going around this uh going through the
[00:33:04] light to turn and on a route one in New
[00:33:06] Hampshire and he pulled out of a gas
[00:33:08] station trying to like take the middle
[00:33:10] spot and just T-Bone me and pushed me
[00:33:13] and my wife she picked her legs up and
[00:33:15] became like a backpack on me so she
[00:33:16] didn't get hurt but they I had been R
[00:33:18] I'd ridden dirt bikes for years so I I
[00:33:20] used to like slide around corners drift
[00:33:22] kind ofish so I leaned into it and
[00:33:25] locked my brakes up knowing that it
[00:33:26] would skid me instead of try to push me
[00:33:28] and by leaning into it it like I got a
[00:33:30] guy gash on my leg and my hip was messed
[00:33:32] up a bit but it pushed me only into the
[00:33:35] median and luckily the other cars on the
[00:33:37] other side of the road were paying
[00:33:37] attention and they didn't head on
[00:33:39] collision to me but that's that's I was
[00:33:42] like the guy was like oh I'm sorry his
[00:33:44] excuse I'm sorry I have an ear
[00:33:46] infection my perception's thrown off is
[00:33:48] what he said I looked at him with like
[00:33:51] five cops around me cuz they send like
[00:33:53] seven cop cars and nine ambulances like
[00:33:55] everything after you when they ever hear
[00:33:57] there's a motorcycle accident and
[00:33:59] they're like they I looked at the guy
[00:34:01] and I'm like I think you should
[00:34:03] leave the police that were standing next
[00:34:05] to me goes dude you probably should just
[00:34:07] go away you're very lucky right now his
[00:34:09] actions are this
[00:34:12] way or my riding jacket and spine
[00:34:14] protector and riding pants had to Endo
[00:34:17] the bike so I didn't run my brother over
[00:34:18] went down first oh yeah yeah protect see
[00:34:21] I like I knew how to just do enough that
[00:34:23] I could protect myself and didn't didn't
[00:34:26] die yeah exact exactly but yeah we got
[00:34:29] Wills break there for those of you that
[00:34:30] want to try that get those in there but
[00:34:33] yeah I just have it's one of those
[00:34:34] things you
[00:34:37] learn no they don't even pay attention
[00:34:39] it's not I don't think it's that they I
[00:34:41] I don't think they don't respect people
[00:34:43] that drive I think they are so oblivious
[00:34:44] to the world around them that they don't
[00:34:47] even see them I think that's more what
[00:34:49] the problem is they're just so tied up
[00:34:52] in their own life and
[00:34:55] themsel he they don't care or see anyone
[00:34:57] else
[00:34:58] I think that's more what I always notice
[00:35:00] a lot of times cuz it's like I've been I
[00:35:02] was almost hit by somebody staring at
[00:35:03] their GPS and just turned a lane I was
[00:35:05] pulled over by a police officer saying
[00:35:07] dude you just you just cut over a lane
[00:35:09] without a blinker and sped past a car
[00:35:12] I'm like did you see the car pull into
[00:35:14] my lane from their Lane which was a
[00:35:15] turning lane cuz they realized they were
[00:35:17] in the wrong one when they looked at
[00:35:18] their G GPS and almost hit me I did
[00:35:21] exactly what I was supposed to do based
[00:35:22] on how you the police trained me which
[00:35:24] was actually which was a state trooper
[00:35:27] that trained me to take my course so he
[00:35:30] like kind of looked at me
[00:35:31] like didn't couldn't really say anything
[00:35:34] CU he must have saw the car move over a
[00:35:36] lane and then was well that well that
[00:35:38] maybe makes sense now but it was like
[00:35:39] one of those things just they don't pay
[00:35:41] attention it's not that they're I don't
[00:35:43] think they're malicious they're just
[00:35:47] oblivious they're not malicious they're
[00:35:49] oblivious yeah that's what it
[00:35:51] is all right here we go line cutter

[00:50:54] if I get a bunch of the ones that are
[00:50:55] rares if people have a problem if don't
[00:50:57] have a problem I'll just put them in the
[00:50:58] packs again I mean they're that's how
[00:51:00] they came and I just take the like the
[00:51:01] ones that are worth money and put them
[00:51:03] in top loaders type thing it's kind of
[00:51:04] what I was thinking of doing but I'm
[00:51:06] trying to getting used to the boat stuff
[00:51:07] here and figuring out what we want to do
[00:51:12] regularly all right that's our our
[00:51:15] intriguing one there today and our
[00:51:17] Wheels break Let's see we have our
[00:51:19] Wheels break pinned right now but I am
[00:51:21] going to run one of the encounters right
[00:51:23] now for our friend I'm going to run one
[00:51:25] of these for the encounter one and see
[00:51:28] what happens and see what happens with
[00:51:30] our encounter and what we do here is we
[00:51:33] uh if somebody happens to bump into
[00:51:35] something I don't know what happens who
[00:51:37] are you going to bump into what will you
[00:51:38] bump into we are not
[00:51:41] sure yeah exactly not having extra stuff
[00:51:44] and I pack it pretty good too yeah we
[00:51:46] use all of our stuff to like all the
[00:51:47] boxes to do um you know extra packaging
[00:51:50] oh
[00:51:52] spicy spicy my friend you've bumped into
[00:51:55] a medium
[00:51:57] sized
[00:51:58] Raider oh no
[00:52:03] spicy what are you going to
[00:52:05] do with that mediumsized
[00:52:09] raadar you have to
[00:52:11] decide that mediumsized Raider is a
[00:52:15] uh 16 to hit them no F 16 to hit them
[00:52:20] that is correct 16 to hit
[00:52:22] them
[00:52:24] so here we go
[00:52:27] you're going to dust do go with your
[00:52:30] flamethrower all right going to try the
[00:52:33] uh we're going to go with the
[00:52:34] flamethrower attempt you're going to use

[01:41:48] bit better
[01:41:50] aha we're going to see what we get here
[01:41:53] now the reason we cut them off like that
[01:41:54] is cuz it makes it easier to ship things

[01:41:58] a boat you got to have you got to use uh
[01:42:00] your resources

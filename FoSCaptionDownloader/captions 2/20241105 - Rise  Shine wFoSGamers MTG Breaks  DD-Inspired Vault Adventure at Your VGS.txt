[00:02:15] have this go open to our B now oh we
[00:02:21] going to go to

[00:02:41] front no that's supposed to be
[00:02:44] 160 there you go put that in there good
[00:02:47] morning good morning sorry about that I
[00:02:50] know somebody had uh we had requested
[00:02:51] that the other yesterday um we talking
[00:02:53] to a couple people so I figured you know
[00:02:55] what I'll throw it in there so
[00:03:00] I made it so you guys can try it out so
[00:03:02] basically what this this is is some
[00:03:04] people said they just literally wanted
[00:03:05] to play the game but uh maybe try their
[00:03:07] Lu to get a pack of cards while they're
[00:03:09] playing they literally just wanted to
[00:03:11] play the game like go give me a number
[00:03:12] we'll pull it out we like all right well
[00:03:14] looks like you're going
[00:03:15] uh with your Adventurer
[00:03:18] here oh no I don't have it up your
[00:03:21] Adventurer is deciding to go now oh no
[00:03:23] looks like they may go against a
[00:03:25] mediumsized Raider here in the vault so
[00:03:27] you get to play Jump and you can do all
[00:03:30] the other ones
[00:03:31] too because the other ones I didn't I
[00:03:33] didn't change the virtual ones too much
[00:03:34] because I figured those ones were pretty
[00:03:36] close to $2 or a dollar or so that you
[00:03:38] guys might want to you just find with
[00:03:40] those ones so that's going of what our
[00:03:43] little update that was there yeah so
[00:03:45] that's why I kind of yeah exactly you
[00:03:46] guys thought it was fun to play so might
[00:03:49] as well uh make it more fun more um
[00:03:53] more access ha let's do that so let's
[00:03:58] run it here I can do that there and then
[00:04:00] there more than like can't do like um
[00:04:03] less than a dollar because that's all
[00:04:04] they let me do here it's because they a
[00:04:07] percentage they take of
[00:04:09] everything I really don't make anything
[00:04:10] onest but this is for those people that
[00:04:12] want to
[00:04:17] play there you go that's that here or we
[00:04:21] can do our regular virtual one or other
[00:04:23] one actually just do our other one here
[00:04:26] and you want to try your luck on this
[00:04:27] we've added a bunch of the stickers onto
[00:04:29] the C ODS here now I got to do this here
[00:04:32] I got a minus I do here I made an
[00:04:34] adjustment because the stickers made the
[00:04:36] boxes too thick so you guys have a
[00:04:38] better chance now at getting the play
[00:04:40] Booster Box in
[00:04:44] total right cuz this is now 390 that's
[00:04:49] out
[00:04:50] of so we're going to run
[00:04:53] that all
[00:04:55] right and we'll run that for 20 seconds
[00:04:57] there if you want to play
[00:05:02] this would
[00:05:05] be
[00:05:07] that this would
[00:05:12] be that wasn't
[00:05:17] right we going to take 25 cards out of
[00:05:20] each one because the stickers made them
[00:05:23] too thick and I was like well you know
[00:05:24] what I guess it's not too bad it was
[00:05:25] mainly for people that wanted to play a
[00:05:27] game here it wasn't anything special
[00:05:31] so let's run number two baby and all run
[00:05:33] number two is a discount get a single
[00:05:35] you always get your pack here it's just
[00:05:37] whether or not you uh you're lucky
[00:05:39] enough to get the
[00:05:41] whole uh play booster box that's written
[00:05:44] on one of them in there on one of these
[00:05:46] four in one of these four there's a card
[00:05:49] that's written play booster box the rest
[00:05:52] of them you just get play boosters
[00:05:53] you're going to get a or bloomo
[00:05:55] murderers
[00:05:56] ion or Nik Coria there you go
[00:06:05] box three
[00:06:07] here we didn't put ceilings in
[00:06:12] there we didn't put ceilings in here if
[00:06:14] that makes any sense are you talking
[00:06:16] about

[00:06:44] of them on these ones I'm making myself
[00:06:46] a liar right now all right now I'm

[00:19:36] that I've been doing we started this has
[00:19:38] 1600 options of cards potentially in
[00:19:40] this but the nice thing with those 1600
[00:19:44] is that um there's one one of these have
[00:19:46] play boost is written on them but if you
[00:19:47] don't get anything written on it you're
[00:19:48] going to get a bloom murder ion or

[00:19:55] up your pack and get like a Dorn a one
[00:19:59] horizon two or
[00:20:02] three so you get three of them can kind
[00:20:04] of just add up until you get your packs
[00:20:06] together is what it is hey Mike how's it
[00:20:07] going buddy thanks coming in hanging out
[00:20:09] I appreciate that so we'll run this one

[00:20:18] going to be similar to this but you're
[00:20:19] going to get a pack guaranteed with it
[00:20:21] and every time there we have a little
[00:20:23] bit longer with the the adventure is a
[00:20:24] little different than when you do these
[00:20:25] ones not the same not exactly the same
[00:20:27] it's just the they're they make it move
[00:20:29] a little not as long not as slow I mean
[00:20:32] no not as short that's what I was
[00:20:34] looking for dang it words didn't come
[00:20:35] out of my mouth well maybe you guys
[00:20:38] don't like that one maybe you want to
[00:20:39] try the one that is this one and try it

[00:20:52] you whatever you want here regards the
[00:20:54] price range that I've been showing you I
[00:20:55] maybe I should make a I think I should
[00:20:57] make a a chart on that one that might
[00:21:00] make it easier for you guys to
[00:21:02] see yes that would make
[00:21:06] sense all right now I have to rename the
[00:21:10] sheet to that so I can track everybody
[00:21:13] that's been playing because that's what

[00:43:05] of them I kept the some for the my
[00:43:07] family but uh I did have a couple for
[00:43:09] the store we were we were selling but it
[00:43:12] SS when you're not able to get like
[00:43:13] everything you want all the time some
[00:43:15] people in the beginning I guess when you
[00:43:16] first got there they were letting people
[00:43:18] get like five to five to 10 or something
[00:43:21] like that per person like what really I
[00:43:24] didn't realize that so if people went
[00:43:25] and ran that's why they went and ran
[00:43:26] right in online I figur it was going to
[00:43:27] be like three per person like um like
[00:43:30] when you buy online but somebody said
[00:43:32] the first few how were able to get five
[00:43:33] or 10 of them the first ones in line I
[00:43:36] was like really that
[00:43:40] stinks oh maybe that's what it was they
[00:43:43] were looping around and they kept buying
[00:43:45] them I mean they made a boatload of
[00:43:47] money going over and selling them
[00:43:48] reselling them after they did that cuz I
[00:43:51] saw them um being sold for like $500 at
[00:43:53] the other places which means they were
[00:43:55] buying and I think some of them said
[00:43:56] they were buying them for like 350 or
[00:43:57] something which is just all cash in your
[00:44:01] hand oh really hot hands wow yeah we
[00:44:04] ended up only we only got six I wish I
[00:44:06] had got like I wanted to get kind of

[01:10:29] ni so let me write your name down
[01:10:35] Raven let's
[01:10:37] see I'm sorry buddy that was
[01:10:41] not a good trip for you I'm going to
[01:10:44] have to get a I think what we'll do is I
[01:10:46] think we'll get one of the dice Towers
[01:10:47] like somebody told me to get I think
[01:10:49] we'll do that what do you guys think a
[01:10:50] good idea for me since we're using dice
[01:10:52] a bit here but here Raven I'm sorry my
[01:10:54] friend
[01:10:56] what would you like to do
[01:10:58] though yeah all right we'll do a dice to
[01:11:00] I think I we'll get one of those I've
[01:11:01] been looking at them been looking at
[01:11:03] them and I try to find one that would be
[01:11:05] like more like a water related because
[01:11:07] we're going to be on a boat I haven't
[01:11:08] been able to find anything that great
[01:11:10] yet Health packet all right you're going
[01:11:12] to health pack it as he walks away you
[01:11:14] take that health pack and you bring
[01:11:16] yourself up to 51
[01:11:18] health and you're hanging out there that
[01:11:21] guy walks away and you don't know what
[01:11:24] to do anymore
[01:11:25] you're almost you're about to die
[01:11:30] tired oh make my own Tower I never
[01:11:32] thought about
[01:11:34] that huh so I kind of want it to be like
[01:11:38] a pirate ship being taken out by a uh by
[01:11:41] like a kraken if that makes any sense
[01:11:43] that's kind of what I like I'd like to
[01:11:45] see a pirate ship being eaten taken
[01:11:47] taken out by a
[01:11:49] kraken all right you used your health
[01:11:51] pack now does anybody want to jump in
[01:11:54] with our friend here here and help him
[01:11:56] get him get themselves a pack of cards
[01:11:58] guaranteed maybe get themselves a play
[01:12:00] booster whole box if they're lucky but
[01:12:02] you're always guaranteed your pack of
[01:12:04] cards that's actually not a bad idea I
[01:12:06] didn't think about that one maybe we
[01:12:08] want to do
[01:12:14] that all right here we
[01:12:19] go well for those of you that want to
[01:12:22] we'll run it you don't need to get it
[01:12:24] anything but if you end up deciding to
[01:12:25] play you can here is um we'll run this
[01:12:29] this is our weapon box but it is also a
[01:12:32] mystery booster to plus a bunch of
[01:12:33] singles that are in there that are rares
[01:12:35] if you want to try and get one for $2
[01:12:37] it's not a bad thing there not bad you
[01:12:41] go
[01:12:42] live go over live
[01:12:45] here all righty yeah let me know what
[01:12:48] you want to do we're going to go on to
[01:12:49] oh you don't have another one all right
[01:12:51] we'll run this one then we'll do this
[01:12:54] just play our
[01:12:56] game and what I think I'll do here is we
[01:12:59] did have some things that we were going
[01:13:01] into this I'm going to start this here
[01:13:04] all right oh Raven's going to jump in
[01:13:06] and play the game I like it where's our
[01:13:08] box where did I put that box oh
[01:13:12] sh it's right
[01:13:14] here there it is you know what I'm going
[01:13:17] to do actually let's do
[01:13:20] this nope not
[01:13:24] that nope not that I gotta find a blank
[01:13:28] one blank one blank
[01:13:30] one there we go we're going to say I'm
[01:13:34] going to put a play play booster on
[01:13:36] there again and we're going to add that
[01:13:38] in here we're going to add two play
[01:13:39] boosters into this and what I'm going to
[01:13:40] do here so I'm going just move this
[01:13:42] right over here and put the play booster
[01:13:43] in it you going see me putting the blade
[01:13:45] booster in here somewhere but just not
[01:13:46] in here exactly
[01:13:49] where there we go I'm adding a second
[01:13:51] play booster in I think that's a good
[01:13:52] idea all right where would you like to
[01:13:54] go my friend in here out of this
[01:13:58] box there are now two play boosters in
[01:14:00] there instead of
[01:14:02] one but it brings you on the adventure

[01:43:28] with that he's not even know what you're
[01:43:29] doing he was wondering if you're
[01:43:30] shooting at something behind you looking
[01:43:31] around the bug's like dude what's going
[01:43:32] on here trying to figure out what's
[01:43:35] going on I don't really understand
[01:43:36] anything what are you gonna do now AJ I
[01:43:38] think you got lucky on that one you
[01:43:39] might be able to just either walk away
[01:43:41] or I don't know maybe you could continue
[01:43:42] on and shoot him again oh you're
[01:43:44] shooting again now remember we need 11
[01:43:47] oh there we go 13 you definitely hit him
[01:43:50] that time this time you hit the bug
[01:43:52] directly
[01:43:53] in at the side of its carrus as it's
[01:43:55] looking around it goes from 25 Health
[01:43:58] down to 13
[01:44:01] health so at 13 Health he realizes
[01:44:05] you've been shooting at him the entire
[01:44:06] time he's pissed he comes charging at
[01:44:10] you comes charging at you and takes you
[01:44:14] from that 61 Health down to 52 Health
[01:44:17] but because you have that radiation
[01:44:20] poisoning we're going to bring you down
[01:44:22] to that's five off every turn which
[01:44:24] means Oh no you're going to go down to
[01:44:27] 47 health because of your radiation
[01:44:30] poisoning you got to get H you gotta
[01:44:32] healed somehow to get rid of that all
[01:44:36] right AJ you have one more chance of
[01:44:37] what you're going to do you're getting
[01:44:38] tired though with your radiation
[01:44:40] poisoning and being
[01:44:43] attacked we're going to shoot again it's
[01:44:46] up to you my
[01:44:47] friend you have five shots left in your
[01:44:52] pistol
[01:45:01] you do have something to trade you have
[01:45:03] a knife you have remember you have a
[01:45:05] knife and a
[01:45:07] pistol you could uh talk about talk to
[01:45:10] the guy there and be like yo run back in
[01:45:11] another thing and see if you can uh
[01:45:13] maybe trade for some health after well
[01:45:16] you can't do it now you you have to you
[01:45:17] have to get through the through this
[01:45:18] part of it but after you'd have to trade
[01:45:20] because you are in the encounter right
[01:45:22] now so you don't have anything at the
[01:45:23] moment you have to do it after the
[01:45:24] encounter so you're going to shoot again
[01:45:26] all right one more time oh nice 13 we
[01:45:29] hit him again this time the bug you hit
[01:45:31] him and it hits him directly in the
[01:45:34] face that medium size that small bug
[01:45:37] drops to the ground with only two Health
[01:45:40] left now he's twitching around on the
[01:45:43] ground there you have an opportunity do
[01:45:45] you go over to finish the bug
[01:45:47] off and take it and loot it or do you
[01:45:51] let it twitch and go back and talk to
[01:45:52] the uh
[01:45:54] to the uh shop
[01:45:58] owner you know the shop owner instead
[01:46:01] well I'm going let you know if you go
[01:46:02] over to the bug you don't go over the
[01:46:03] bug you're going to leave him there
[01:46:04] you're not going to be able to loot it
[01:46:05] when you go back he's going to be gone

[01:52:16] you're going to try with my
[01:52:18] friend let's see what you get
[01:52:21] here so my idea is I want to have a ship
[01:52:25] like a kind of like a pirate ship is
[01:52:26] type thing being picked up on its Edge
[01:52:30] on its End by a kraken down here and I
[01:52:33] want the dice to go in the end of the
[01:52:35] ship because the kraken's picking it up
[01:52:38] and the dice to roll through the ship
[01:52:39] and come down to like where the mouth of
[01:52:41] the Kraken is that's kind of what I want
[01:52:44] to do I don't know if anybody can help
[01:52:45] me with
[01:52:46] that all right AJ we're going to do hot
[01:52:48] hands
[01:52:54] let's see you've got a oh oh
[01:52:58] no

[01:53:15] of the toughest ones you can run into a
[01:53:18] feral ghoul in front of you
[01:53:25] so the ball Jo yeah to drop the dice it
[01:53:27] would be the end of the it would be like
[01:53:28] in the back of like uh the the boat the
[01:53:30] ship kind of like um like I'd have the
[01:53:33] ship like where like the the Captain's
[01:53:34] Quarters would be in my head and it
[01:53:36] would go where the Captain's Quarters is
[01:53:38] and it was just roll down through the
[01:53:39] ship and come out the front of the ship
[01:53:40] through like a crack where the where the
[01:53:42] Kraken is like kind of breaking it apart
[01:53:44] in a way or like broke part of it off
[01:53:45] the front of the ship and it goes into
[01:53:47] like the mouth is where the dice would

[02:09:55] don't have all the Legos here to do that
[02:09:56] with but that's not a bad idea I think
[02:09:59] we could have that done by tomorrow
[02:10:00] though famous we could have that done by
[02:10:02] tomorrow all right we're gonna go we
[02:10:04] going to attempt one more here we're
[02:10:05] going to change our dice actually
[02:10:07] because I don't like this one I'm going
[02:10:09] to go with our one from from our this
[02:10:11] and we're going to go this as our last
[02:10:13] one
[02:10:14] 12 you got your plus oh my God you got
[02:10:17] lucky dude because you have your plus
[02:10:19] three then your plus one for your
[02:10:22] engineering I'm going to let you hit it
[02:10:24] this time you got one hit on the large
[02:10:26] bug one hit on the large bug cuz I
[02:10:29] didn't like how he kept missing him one
[02:10:31] hit on the large bug that large bug goes
[02:10:34] from 45 Health down to oh that was a
[02:10:38] good hit 32 Health but he comes charging
[02:10:41] at you and hits you again bringing you
[02:10:44] from your 39 Health down to 30 oh 31
[02:10:46] that wasn't horrible now it's a
[02:10:49] standoff all right right there's nowhere
[02:10:52] there's no way you can get forward and
[02:10:54] if you attack him again there's a good
[02:10:55] chance he's going to kill you so you
[02:10:58] decide you need to turn
[02:11:00] around going to shoot till you die all
[02:11:02] right last chance Last Chance that's is
[02:11:05] what I to say if you don't K him this
[02:11:06] time you're going to go down and he's
[02:11:08] going to take all of your stuff and
[02:11:10] you're goingon to have nothing left all
[02:11:11] right here you go AJ are you sure you
[02:11:13] want to do
[02:11:17] it let's see say yes no give me a thumbs
[02:11:21] up or something all right so you can
[02:11:25] Retreat you can go back to your um I'm
[02:11:29] going to let you go back to the safe
[02:11:30] haven if you want or you can Retreat out
[02:11:32] of there and keep your stuff if you go
[02:11:34] to the safe haven if you have something
[02:11:35] you want to trade you could do that um
[02:11:37] but if you go back out of there from the
[02:11:39] safe haven you're going to have to fight
[02:11:41] them again that's the only problem but
[02:11:44] if you
[02:11:44] Retreat you'll don't have to fight them
[02:11:47] but when you Retreat you do end up have
[02:11:49] to drop something so they don't chase
[02:11:50] you now you do have not a pistol but you
[02:11:53] can you can drop some of your ammo if
[02:11:55] you would like instead of just dropping
[02:11:57] your rifle that way you can drop some
[02:11:59] stuff and Retreat safely and get away or
[02:12:02] you can attack one more time and if you
[02:12:04] lose he's going to knock you out and
[02:12:06] take all your
[02:12:08] stuff Retreat all right Retreat and you
[02:12:12] drop some of your ammo so you go down to
[02:12:15] you go down to 12 ammo so that's going
[02:12:19] to be four shots for you you drop some
[02:12:21] of your ammo and you're down to 12 ammo
[02:12:23] there you Retreat you are at 31 Health

[02:40:47] weapon here which is a mystery booster
[02:40:50] two pack or a bunch of singles that are
[02:40:53] um worth of money or anywhere from 5
[02:40:55] cents to a few dollars and they are all
[02:40:58] rares or uncommons of value now you
[02:41:00] either could get a mystery booster or
[02:41:02] maybe you're going to get a one of those
[02:41:03] singles but you're guaranteed you're
[02:41:05] going to get a weapon of some kind
[02:41:06] whether it's a knife or a pistol or an
[02:41:08] assault rifle or I don't know we're not
[02:41:09] sure but it's something for the game to
[02:41:11] play with but let me know what you want
[02:41:13] to do here my
[02:41:16] friend for your uh Adventure
[02:41:19] do you just want to attack with what you
[02:41:22] have I don't know
[02:41:26] baby we'll uh kind of continue on here
[02:41:30] or maybe would like a
[02:41:31] buff sometimes people like Buffs so they
[02:41:33] can uh get a little stronger or have
[02:41:35] some health added to them attack you
[02:41:38] guess all right we can attack well you
[02:41:40] have the wrench you have a feral ghoul
[02:41:43] and you're going to attack that means
[02:41:44] you need to have over
[02:41:46] 17 when you roll all right baby
[02:41:50] that means you have to have over
[02:41:51] 17 oh no we got an eight that feral
[02:41:55] ghoul did not like it feral ghoul charge
[02:41:57] after you and he feral ghoul takes out
[02:42:01] the
[02:42:01] adventurer with an attack now
[02:42:06] baby you go
[02:42:11] from 100 Health down to 88
[02:42:16] Health you can swing at him again with
[02:42:18] the wrench if you want it's your choice
[02:42:20] or you can try to find oh if you're
[02:42:22] going to need a single or a weapon of
[02:42:24] some kind here maybe you want a single a
[02:42:26] weapon or maybe that mystery booster too
[02:42:28] you can do it again please we're doing
[02:42:30] it again we go again and this time oh no
[02:42:32] we have 10 it is a 10 only this time
[02:42:35] it's a feral ghoul so it's a hard one to
[02:42:37] get that feral ghoul sees you and
[02:42:38] charges at you again knocking you over
[02:42:41] and slices at you this time bringing you
[02:42:43] down to 75 Health from 88 you have one
[02:42:48] more chance here the only thing that
[02:42:50] they're going to do luckily there's
[02:42:51] nothing on you so if they knock you over
[02:42:52] and they knock you out you have nothing
[02:42:54] to steal they have nothing to take from
[02:42:56] you loot but if you were normally
[02:42:59] playing they'd loot stuff from you and
[02:43:00] take things so it's your choice what do
[02:43:02] you want to do now do you want to attack
[02:43:04] again we need to get a dice I'm going to
[02:43:06] make one out of I think I'm going to

[02:43:11] might need to do that way we can wait
[02:43:13] for our Kraken Tower to be uh
[02:43:15] potentially made or something like that
[02:43:17] you have one more Choice here you want
[02:43:19] to roll again or would you like
[02:43:26] to retreat now if you Retreat you have
[02:43:29] nothing to drop you just run away and
[02:43:31] just don't get damaged
[02:43:33] anymore it is your
[02:43:35] turn your choice on what you want to
[02:43:39] do let me

[02:48:56] pistol there and hitting you one more
[02:48:57] time you have one more chance here to
[02:49:00] decide what to do you can
[02:49:03] run where
[02:49:05] you'll keep your
[02:49:09] knife because that's the only thing you
[02:49:12] have or you can attack again and see if
[02:49:15] you get lucky to hit him we can always
[02:49:16] change the dice out too
[02:49:20] it's up to you baby
[02:49:22] love I seem to I have to I'm GNA have to
[02:49:24] make a dice tower because my rolling is
[02:49:26] just really bad luck right now I can't
[02:49:28] believe
[02:49:33] it you need some decisions we're going
[02:49:35] to attack all right here we go let's do

[02:49:53] pistol whips you in the back of the
[02:49:55] head you drop to the ground you're
[02:49:58] unconscious with 50 Health now and that
[02:50:03] guy leans over and starts to loot you
[02:50:05] and he sees you guys only got a knife
[02:50:08] ah all they have is a knife well
[02:50:12] then I don't uh I don't think I'm going
[02:50:15] to go and take their stuff and they
[02:50:16] leave your
[02:50:17] knife they leave you with your knife and
[02:50:20] allow you to wander and and they wander
[02:50:22] away out through the door you're not
[02:50:24] really sure where they go cuz you're
[02:50:25] unconscious on the
[02:50:27] ground do you need any uh Buffs or
[02:50:30] health though that's what's coming up
[02:50:31] next for you we're going to put that
[02:50:34] over here with the rest of your stuff my
[02:50:37] buddy

[02:50:44] get here you're going to go with a the
[02:50:45] master of keys there and you get a plus
[02:50:48] one for your strength nice do you want
[02:50:51] to use your plus one buff for your
[02:50:53] strength or you want to keep it and save

[03:09:26] choice do you want to attack or do you

[03:09:31] rounds of ammo but you're going be alive
[03:09:33] and you'll be able to live another day
[03:09:35] with your plasma rifle but if you attack
[03:09:38] and you do not hit one of them and you
[03:09:39] lose something again you're going to end
[03:09:42] up going down and they can loot you and

[03:09:47] choice
[03:09:48] you're going to run all right you turn
[03:09:49] and
[03:09:51] run that large guy so injured that he
[03:09:54] can't even chase after you the little
[03:09:56] one shoots wildly toward you but nothing
[03:09:58] hits you as you run away you run though
[03:10:01] and you dive right out that first first
[03:10:04] door make it safely
[03:10:07] outside but you're having a hard time
[03:10:10] you're almost dead you do not get
[03:10:12] anything from that small
[03:10:15] Raider now you have a choice though you
[03:10:17] you do have access to your um you do
[03:10:20] have access to the uh that storage
[03:10:22] facility there if you want to try to get
[03:10:23] something there but you have nothing
[03:10:24] really to
[03:10:25] trade since you only have one round of
[03:10:29] your plasma rifle
[03:10:32] but maybe you would like to
[03:10:35] um see if you can get a weapon of
[03:10:39] another kind or maybe you want a buff of
[03:10:41] some kind well that was supposed to go
[03:10:44] ah it's all right you can try the buff
[03:10:46] for that why not That was supposed to do
[03:10:48] that but we'll do it that way
[03:10:52] anyway this is when the uh modern
[03:10:54] Horizon 3 pack comes out because it was
[03:10:56] for $3 by
[03:10:58] accident no problem
[03:11:01] hord let's see what you

[03:11:07] intelligence savior of or where is it
[03:11:10] savior
[03:11:13] s savior of enen Brook and you got an
[03:11:16] intellig
[03:11:20] all righty now you have another
[03:11:22] encounter to go with my
[03:11:25] friend um would you like to give this he
[03:11:27] cord to your buddy or would you like to
[03:11:28] save this and uh start your own
[03:11:30] adventure hi
[03:11:41] cord all right so hi we're playing a
[03:11:43] little Adventure kind of like D and D
[03:11:45] Adventure game currently our character
[03:11:46] here
[03:11:48] our buddy baby love was playing they
[03:11:50] have another opportunity they have a
[03:11:52] choice of what they want to do right now
[03:11:54] but you can jump in too if you want to
[03:11:56] be a character you could participate
[03:11:58] also we have our boxes here which is our
[03:12:02] it's just a pull box it's really mainly
[03:12:04] it's to get things written on here all
[03:12:07] right so all these one through one two
[03:12:10] three or four
[03:12:12] have something like this stuck to them
[03:12:15] or you might be lucky it has s play
[03:12:17] Booster Box on it now if it does you get
[03:12:19] a whole play booster box if not you get
[03:12:21] a bloom murders ion or ioria to start
[03:12:24] out with and if you want to up like get
[03:12:26] say maybe you want to do two times into
[03:12:28] the adventure you can always get another
[03:12:29] one and get in go with dust MN or get
[03:12:32] more packs it's pretty much $6 for
[03:12:34] whatever pack you want then you get to
[03:12:36] go forward with your character and do
[03:12:38] some other things so it's up to you
[03:12:39] we're go box one here so you just just
[03:12:43] pick from here a number and we'd see
[03:12:44] what you get baby right now is at this
[03:12:49] and that would be what you do let me
[03:12:51] give you this over and baby you need to
[03:12:52] decide what you want to do right now do
[03:12:54] you want to continue to you want to
[03:12:55] continue on or you want to
[03:12:58] flee you get a pack
[03:13:01] guaranteed from any of these boxes I'll
[03:13:03] explain it again not a problem at all I
[03:13:05] have zero issues so one two three or
[03:13:08] four are all the same thing you run away
[03:13:10] all right I see it um and they are all
[03:13:14] part of the same game I just can't put
[03:13:15] all of them into one thing in and
[03:13:17] whatnot they only allow eight th000
[03:13:20] items in on one so I had to split it up
[03:13:22] that's why they're in four now it was
[03:13:24] mainly because there's one of these
[03:13:25] cards says play booster box written on
[03:13:27] it so that means you're going to get a
[03:13:28] whole play booster box but there were
[03:13:30] 1,600 cards in there so that's one in600
[03:13:34] but the other thing is if there's
[03:13:35] nothing written on it you're guaranteed
[03:13:36] you're going to get yourself a bloomo
[03:13:38] murders lost Caverns or ioria of it's
[03:13:41] your choice which one you want say you
[03:13:44] want to go with two cards because you
[03:13:46] want to play the adventure a little bit
[03:13:47] longer or you want to have two
[03:13:49] encounters or whatever it is you can do
[03:13:52] get a dusk instead of getting two bloom
[03:13:55] or some or you can get tomb blo bloomo
[03:13:58] however you want to put it together to
[03:13:59] get your packs is really what it boils
[03:14:01] down to it's a way to get a chance to
[03:14:02] get a whole box but we have to play a
[03:14:04] game at the time while we're doing
[03:14:10] it nope um you already got this is box
[03:14:13] one you use the one that it bid on so it
[03:14:15] has to be from box one but you just need
[03:14:16] to give me a in here I think it's
[03:14:17] between like 300 and
[03:14:22] something and thank you baby love for
[03:14:24] playing that was fun that was a good
[03:14:26] time there maybe you can uh we'll say

[03:16:25] health and you have a
[03:16:29] knife you also have your your buff from
[03:16:32] before which was your uh buff you
[03:16:37] got which was a uh where to go
[03:16:48] the plus one for the
[03:16:50] intelligence which means whenever you
[03:16:53] have to go up against uh when you have a
[03:16:54] weapon that's a like a higher weapon
[03:16:56] like one of the um the plasma rifle you
[03:16:58] get a plus one on your things and then
[03:17:00] also if you have to break into something
[03:17:02] or safe you get better chance all right
[03:17:04] so here you go we're going to go with
[03:17:05] your plus one
[03:17:09] intelligence for you pord you got a
[03:17:12] knife only right now
[03:17:13] though I don't why you have a knife why
[03:17:15] do you have a knife I don't think he had
[03:17:17] a knife wait a minute I'm lying why do
[03:17:18] you have a knife um maybe you did I
[03:17:21] can't remember we're going to go with
[03:17:22] you having that but there you go my
[03:17:24] friend mediumsized Raider then you have
[03:17:27] that and our buddy here next to you if
[03:17:28] they want to to come back in baby Canen
[03:17:30] and we'll ship that to you so you have
[03:17:32] some
[03:17:33] choices you have 100 Health you now have
[03:17:36] a mediumsized Raider in front of you
[03:17:38] that came
[03:17:40] to is baby love going to stay are they
[03:17:43] heading out I don't know because depends
[03:17:46] on what characters it are going to be
[03:17:47] there to
[03:17:50] attack you can definitely fight yes so
[03:17:53] we roll our dice to see if you can get
[03:17:56] all right
[03:17:57] so when you pick up your pack do you
[03:17:59] have a question is Let's do let's see if
[03:18:02] I do this let's see if I have my
[03:18:06] um explanation here
[03:18:11] easy give me one second here
[03:18:27] all right let me see here
[03:18:34] so what you do is you're pulling out a
[03:18:36] card from here one of these four boxes
[03:18:42] one of the boxes could have a play
[03:18:43] booster pack a play booster box written
[03:18:45] on it there's a card in one of them
[03:18:47] that's hiss play booster box I don't
[03:18:48] know which one it is cuz you shuffled
[03:18:49] them all up and put them in the rest of
[03:18:51] them either have a sticker on them like
[03:18:53] this or say nothing and that gets you an
[03:18:55] option of the cards packs that we talked
[03:18:57] about now what happens is whenever you
[03:18:59] buy one of these you become the
[03:19:01] adventure in the Wasteland all right and
[03:19:06] as you are in the
[03:19:08] Wasteland you get to wander through this
[03:19:12] Vault that you find and encounter things
[03:19:15] along the way now for instance you
[03:19:17] pulled out the card and it said
[03:19:19] medium-size
[03:19:21] Raider all right yes I do have some
[03:19:23] sorcery here hey Tommy
[03:19:27] quads not a problem so I'm explaining a
[03:19:30] little bit so now with that being said
[03:19:34] you're you're right now this medium size
[03:19:36] this Raider is fighting you if you want
[03:19:38] to or you can turn around and run but
[03:19:41] what we do is we roll our dice to see if
[03:19:43] you can beat the Raider which is a 16 or
[03:19:46] high
[03:19:48] and you only have a knife right now for
[03:19:50] it giv you a plus one to your
[03:19:54] attack all right you're going to fight I
[03:19:57] like it now baby love were you going to
[03:19:59] jump in at all and we do have sorcery we
[03:20:02] have a lot of um um arther and Legend
[03:20:04] here if you'd like 11 oh you got that
[03:20:09] did not help you that did not help you
[03:20:11] got 11 and you missed that mediumsized
[03:20:14] Raider that mediumsized Raider hits you
[03:20:18] though with their pistol they shoot you
[03:20:21] bringing you down from 100 Health down
[03:20:23] to
[03:20:25] 88 you have a choice now do you want to
[03:20:28] attack again you want to run
[03:20:31] away 25% chance of to dream oh 19 that
[03:20:36] was a good one you got them nice
[03:20:39] hit you run up and you slice that guy
[03:20:41] with your knife that mediumsized Raider
[03:20:44] is like wow I didn't expect that one
[03:20:46] holding his side so now he's going to
[03:20:48] slice on his side that mediumsized
[03:20:49] Raider though is um I think that Medium
[03:20:53] siiz Raider is loser 35 that brings him
[03:20:57] down
[03:20:58] to all right there you go that brings
[03:21:01] him down to 20
[03:21:05] s that was not a bad for the slice there
[03:21:07] now you have one more attack attempt
[03:21:09] because they don't know what to do they
[03:21:10] shoot and they miss this time you have
[03:21:12] an attack attempt and if you
[03:21:14] hit then you get to uh they run away and
[03:21:17] flee versus if you get hit it'll be a
[03:21:20] stalemate and you'll kind of like both
[03:21:22] split because you've done a decent job
[03:21:23] so far none of you are significantly
[03:21:27] hurt
[03:21:30] yet hitting yes you can attack I don't
[03:21:34] know the
[03:21:36] IG
[03:21:37] yeah oh no we got three three we got
[03:21:42] three that's not
[03:21:45] good you missed that was a big whiff big
[03:21:49] whiff but he hits you as you want you go
[03:21:52] when you slice at him with your knife
[03:21:54] you miss that radar La Raider laughs
[03:21:58] turns his pistol around and Pistol whips
[03:21:59] you knocking you out cold to 71 Health
[03:22:03] though you're on the ground out cold and
[03:22:06] luckily if good for you you took your
[03:22:08] intelligence booster so you can't steal
[03:22:09] that but he does take your knife and you
[03:22:12] loot you for your
[03:22:15] knife now you got that your ioria we'll
[03:22:17] send that back to you my friend and you
[03:22:20] have an option now do you want to
[03:22:22] continue on in the adventure would you
[03:22:24] like to maybe see if you can get another
[03:22:27] buff where you can uh get a health pack
[03:22:31] but it gets you potentially of getting a
[03:22:32] modern Horizon 3 or whatever the secret
[03:22:34] layers associate we have a couple of
[03:22:35] them over here um or one of the uh get a
[03:22:38] health Puffs hey not a problem hey we
[03:22:40] have like I said uh for some people
[03:22:42] those that don't know one of the things
[03:22:44] I did do I know some people are saying
[03:22:45] like they leted to play the game a bit
[03:22:46] but they don't get an opportunity
[03:22:47] because they don't have a like say you

[03:22:59] here say play booster so you get to
[03:23:01] choose choice of a play booster that I

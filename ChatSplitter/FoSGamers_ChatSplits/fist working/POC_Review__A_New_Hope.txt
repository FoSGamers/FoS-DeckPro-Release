Look at the following and make it able to be clearly read for a presentation of a PowerPoint slide. Add humor from star wars a new hope.:

POC review:
We continuously updated and modified the MM POC excel file with new information gathered from the many meeting we have been having around the POC
This file is a living one that is continuously updated with either new information or needs/wants
Had Multiple sessions with vendors
Litify, Walters kleur, TeamConnect.
Had 4 sessions to learn what our customers do and how they worked
Sessions were with the customers in the role in the slide
Value:
•Walkthroughs provided deeper understanding needs of our customers
•We have only had a chance to watch 2 of the recorded videos but with each person on the team taking a summary and having those summaries in one location we are able to compare and update the POC document to reflect anything different that is needed by our customers.
•Able to give constructive information to management
•The vendor Walkthroughs provided us with understanding of the options so that when discussed we now have a better idea of what could be done for our customers.
•Now we know more about the customers roles and what they do on a daily basis.
•Found some quick wins for customers in legal files
•The customer walkthroughs specifically allowed us to find a few things that we could either quickly update/change for the customer or ones that would be brought with the upgraded legal files.
•Deeper understanding of the matter management process 
•With all the different walk throughs and more involved in the end we now have a better idea of the mater management process (not a complete one but better). This has allowed us to find everything form quick wins to ideas/features we would want in the next MM program.

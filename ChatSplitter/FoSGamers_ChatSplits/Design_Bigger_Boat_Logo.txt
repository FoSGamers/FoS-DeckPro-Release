The shark is in the wrong spot. I want the word boat to be one of the hulls of the catamaran, and the sailboat is going to be a catamaran. And I want the words to be integrated as the catamaran picture itself. And also, the shark should be in the front, taking a bite out of the front of the letter—in the back, taking a bite out of the B in the back of the boat, in the stern of the boat.

Replace the words in the hull of the boat with bigger. Move the boat shark up underneath the hull to its sliding up so it is touching the bottom of the hull of the boat and the only thing that should be in the hull for any type of word is bigger. There should only be two words in this entire thing and it should be the words bigger and boat.

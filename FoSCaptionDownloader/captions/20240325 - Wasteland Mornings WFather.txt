[00:04:39] second here I generally don't do it that
[00:04:41] way I generally do them as like three

[00:05:30] these not running again oh they keep
[00:05:32] popping up with errors hey anybody um do
[00:05:34] streaming here and have been having
[00:05:37] recently when you go to run a um an
[00:05:38] auction it pops up saying there's an
[00:05:40] error and it doesn't like run it for
[00:05:43] whatever
[00:05:44] reason cuz I think that's keeps
[00:05:46] happening to me here because that was
[00:05:48] the second time I saw that
[00:05:50] happen dude doc all right I'm I'm
[00:05:52] sitting here I'm like all right this is
[00:05:53] running I go and look at something else
[00:05:54] I'm like son of a [ __ ] it never even
[00:05:56] ran yeah this week last week it was bad
[00:05:59] and it's now right now it's pretty bad
[00:06:01] too that's why I'm like I don't
[00:06:03] understand what's going on well I mean
[00:06:04] there was an update of sometime that's
[00:06:06] what happened but I mean in general it
[00:06:08] just I'm like I'm doing this and I
[00:06:10] literally hit the same thing the next
[00:06:11] time and it works so I don't know
[00:06:13] whatever we're working we're running I
[00:06:15] just might need to do it a couple of
[00:06:16] times who knows but remember you do have
[00:06:19] a the pyob pick your own break pick a
[00:06:22] have a friend whatever you like you pick
[00:06:24] your packs go in on a break you can do
[00:06:27] one two three four five you can do a
[00:06:29] color break you do a digit break you can
[00:06:31] do just a break of the indal patch
[00:06:33] between you two like we've done a couple
[00:06:35] times before which are kind of fun or we
[00:06:37] can just do our adventure games and our
[00:06:38] vault stuff because uh whenever you play
[00:06:40] any of our games now or any of the
[00:06:41] things you always get one of these which
[00:06:43] is like the Vault packs and in an
[00:06:44] envelope unless you get a vault pack
[00:06:46] which is the Vault one
[00:06:48] here so we'll play another adventure
[00:06:51] game and I think I'll throw up
[00:06:53] um maybe I'll throw off a single here
[00:06:56] for some giveaway
[00:06:58] ideas
[00:07:02] um we could do a break like that
[00:07:06] possibly I might be able to do that I
[00:07:08] have to make sure on the rules though
[00:07:10] all right Jupiter cuz um I don't know if
[00:07:12] I can participate in things but I so
[00:07:14] I'll have to double check on how the
[00:07:15] rules go and if I can do that with you I
[00:07:17] will how's that sound sound like a plan
[00:07:20] stand sorry that's a just a word I use
[00:07:23] you know saying kind of thing a little
[00:07:26] saying kind of thing that's all wasn't

[01:30:50] pack this my last Infinity pack that's
[01:30:53] what we're going to

[01:31:03] I think that might be it but I um there
[01:31:06] was nothing else that was pulled out of
[01:31:08] it so I'm not sure actually that was the
[01:31:09] last box that had the shock land that
[01:31:11] was pulled out of it I think this one
[01:31:13] had one of the Mythic cards that was
[01:31:14] pulled out I can't remember but anyways

[01:45:32] that and I'm going to do a little
[01:45:33] giveaway for our thought vessel
[01:45:37] too what's the game all right so Ivy the
[01:45:40] game is we have our characters at the
[01:45:43] top for those of you um it's in the
[01:45:44] notes by the way we have our character
[01:45:46] at the top you choose one of your
[01:45:48] characters and it's actually an animated
[01:45:50] little Adventure as you go through the
[01:45:51] Wasteland here so you character does
[01:45:53] certain things now you choose your
[01:45:55] character and say you picked this this
[01:45:56] was um I'm going to run this again here
[01:45:58] all right I'm just going to run this
[01:45:59] again so I can explain what's going on
[01:46:01] for the game all right give a little
[01:46:03] explanation so you get this run it for a
[01:46:06] minute here this
[01:46:07] is two strength based on your characters
[01:46:10] at the um for your packs here all right
[01:46:13] and these ones are all one strength your
[01:46:14] character gets one strength and now what
[01:46:16] happens is you wander through the
[01:46:17] Wasteland and hopefully at the end you
[01:46:20] can beat the boss and have a $1 Loot
[01:46:22] drop for everybody in the Wasteland but
[01:46:23] you always get the Vault pack that's
[01:46:25] here to say thank you for playing so you
[01:46:27] go wandering through the Wasteland say
[01:46:28] you pick a detective you a detective you
[01:46:31] find in this first box there's 78 cards
[01:46:34] for red 78 for green and 12 for blue you
[01:46:37] pick one from each of them and then at
[01:46:39] the end that's a plus one or minus one
[01:46:41] for your strength so say you pull out
[01:46:42] food that's going to be a plus one for a
[01:46:44] mutant say you pull it out like a like a
[01:46:47] like a Salam they alien it they'll be a
[01:46:50] plus one for a mutant but say at the end
[01:46:52] over here for the blue one you pull out
[01:46:54] a a warrior that's going to be a minus
[01:46:56] one for the mutant which will mean when
[01:46:58] you go up to fight the boss at the end
[01:47:00] which is just one of the 10 cards
[01:47:05] here it's one of these 10 cards here you
[01:47:08] can beat anyway any if your if your
[01:47:11] strength is high enough to beat any of
[01:47:12] these numbers the two at the end here or
[01:47:14] four five whatever it is you end up
[01:47:17] beating the boss which means there's a
[01:47:18] $1 Loot drop and depending on how bad
[01:47:20] the boss is beaten is how much loot gets
[01:47:23] dropped that's how the game goes if you
[01:47:26] like it that's how uh yeah that's how we
[01:47:28] were playing it before we've done it a
[01:47:30] few
[01:47:34] times I will be I will take it easy on
[01:47:37] you we'll take it easy on you so this is
[01:47:39] going to be four strength as you start
[01:47:42] your adventure in the Wasteland here all
[01:47:45] right and then I'm going to get your
[01:47:47] bosses out so you have all your bosses
[01:47:49] right here
[01:47:51] okay
[01:47:55] there are 10 cards so we have our bosses
[01:47:58] one two three four five 6 7 8 n and 10
[01:48:02] are 10 bosses those will get shuffled up
[01:48:05] now you have four strength to start you
[01:48:07] get to choose your character at the top
[01:48:11] we have three four characters a
[01:48:13] technician a mutant a detective and a um
[01:48:17] strong human and depending on whatever
[01:48:19] the character is you either get Plus or
[01:48:20] minuses depending on the character so
[01:48:23] you go like that and then like I said
[01:48:25] you have three choices from here and
[01:48:27] then the one boss choice at the end is
[01:48:28] one of 10 so it's SE between 78 78 12
[01:48:33] for the blue and 10 for the boss and
[01:48:36] that's how we do the little game
[01:48:38] there so uh I can exp I can expand that
[01:48:41] too if you need me to make it bigger so
[01:48:42] you can see better you're going to go
[01:48:44] with the technician all right as a
[01:48:47] technician you wander through this
[01:48:48] Wasteland and you look for treasure in
[01:48:51] this first area that you're going to
[01:48:52] bump into because treasure helps you to
[01:48:54] either trade gather information
[01:48:56] something like that so where would you
[01:48:58] like to go I can do anything where you'd
[01:49:00] like number wise random it's up to you
[01:49:03] then we do our little Adventure here
[01:49:05] have some fun let's see what
[01:49:07] happens random please on all of them
[01:49:10] we'll do on all of them I'll do random
[01:49:11] on the first one but just make me sure
[01:49:12] on all of them do random here when I do
[01:49:15] random I kind of do that and see which
[01:49:16] one's the last one standing here's our
[01:49:18] last one standing we're going to go this
[01:49:20] we're walking through that Wasteland as
[01:49:22] a techn
[01:49:23] you're looking for some treasure oh but
[01:49:25] you do see something cooking in the
[01:49:27] distance you go over that and go oh look
[01:49:28] at that there's some food there yo you
[01:49:31] pick that food up you start munching on
[01:49:32] it Go yum yum num num oh no but you got
[01:49:35] some RADS now that's no good you're down

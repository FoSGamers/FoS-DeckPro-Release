[00:10:23] luck and then what I'll do is I'll throw
[00:10:25] a pack deal on coming up here for those
[00:10:28] that like pack or
[00:10:30] singles actually you know what I'm going
[00:10:32] to go on to singles here because I
[00:10:33] forgot to do the singles a second ago
[00:10:35] we're going to start with the low ones
[00:10:37] we're going to start with the low ones
[00:10:38] this morning we're going to do the low
[00:10:40] singles this morning we're going to
[00:10:43] start with
[00:10:44] those here we

[00:10:54] $2
[00:10:56] each Grim
[00:10:58] Giganotosaurus
[00:11:03] each of these are $2 so if you need one
[00:11:06] two bucks not
[00:11:08] bad but you got yourself a grim
[00:11:12] Giganotosaurus a saon ransom uh s okek
[00:11:17] AO and a froto adventurous hobbis foil

[00:11:30] then I'll throw on some pack
[00:11:33] deals coming
[00:11:51] up all righty no one wanted to try their
[00:11:54] luck on any of those ones or likes any
[00:11:56] of those ones which is fine not
[00:11:57] everybody likes singles
[00:12:00] which is why I rotate between
[00:12:03] singles and
[00:12:07] um pull
[00:12:12] boxes and
[00:12:16] uh
[00:12:19] packs because some people like packs
[00:12:22] some people like pole boxes some people
[00:12:24] like
[00:12:26] singles so just going to throw something
[00:12:28] random on attacks like I always do it's
[00:12:31] random just straight random so if there
[00:12:35] are something there is something
[00:12:36] specific that you want actually you know
[00:12:39] what I have that empty box I can
[00:12:44] use so if there is something specific
[00:12:47] that you want let me know and I can get
[00:12:50] a those thrown up there
[00:12:54] instead so say it isn't you know you
[00:12:56] didn't want for actually all will be one
[00:13:07] you or you wanted a Lord of the Rings
[00:13:09] instead you just say hey yo give me that
[00:13:10] type of a
[00:13:25] deal this pack deal is going to go on
[00:13:30] three packs on
[00:13:32] screen those are going to go for 16 if
[00:13:35] you want to try your luck on

[00:19:36] you jump in on it and you buy it if you
[00:19:39] don't like the price you don't jump in
[00:19:41] on it and you don't buy it it's really
[00:19:43] what it boils down to but generally
[00:19:45] people like the price because I do a
[00:19:46] pretty good deal when I'm able to do
[00:19:47] multiple packs at a time it allows me to
[00:19:51] save on whatnot be so I pass them over

[01:55:36] and um I was opening stuff about a
[01:55:38] couple years after we moved I was
[01:55:39] opening some boxes and they saw my magic
[01:55:40] cards like hey can we play these I'm
[01:55:42] like sure and I looked into them and we
[01:55:43] started playing a little bit March
[01:55:45] machines but got Wicked big into it when
[01:55:47] Lord of the Rings came out cuz we're we
[01:55:49] like Lord of the Rings my son's 10 and
[01:55:51] he's the youngest is eight so they all
[01:55:52] play with us now even my wife now that
[01:55:54] Exelon came out with Jurassic Park she
[01:55:57] has uh she likes playing Bill
[01:56:00] song Slip On The Ring got yourself
[01:56:05] Forest G the
[01:56:09] windlord dunlin
[01:56:11] cban Aragon company leader nice
[01:56:16] rare shower of arrows for
[01:56:20] in a battle W Oak I've never seen that
[01:56:23] list card hor comes into play under your
[01:56:26] control battle W Oak G two until end of
[01:56:28] turn
[01:56:29] oh nice not bad for those three packs
[01:56:34] and as I always do for anybody we always
[01:56:37] get these I like to get them put into
[01:56:39] these little packages that I have here
[01:56:40] to make sure that I don't lose any of
[01:56:42] your cards but before shipping I get
[01:56:44] them all put into like sleeves or top
[01:56:47] loaders and stuff that need them but
[01:56:49] thank you I appreciate
[01:56:52] that oh you are getting yet we're
[01:56:54] getting yeah I know I know the
[01:56:59] um
[01:57:03] underworld
[01:57:05] games just making sure I write that down
[01:57:07] right I know the Ravnica is uh
[01:57:10] interesting I like how they're put in
[01:57:12] the shock land like people are saying
[01:57:13] like they're saying there's a lot of the
[01:57:14] shock lands that are going to be coming
[01:57:15] out in those so that is going to be
[01:57:17] that's going to be interesting to see
[01:57:18] what happens to those but I I uh I don't
[01:57:21] know I think it's going to be it's going
[01:57:23] to be I like when they put the cards out
[01:57:25] to be able to drop them a little bit so
[01:57:27] that you're not paying an exorbitant
[01:57:28] price like that you can actually have
[01:57:30] some of them but at the same time it's
[01:57:31] like when I ever have a card that's
[01:57:32] expensive and they drop one out like so
[01:57:35] you killed my card price like I had a
[01:57:37] morgal knife and it was a $180 card The
[01:57:40] Surge foil of it and I should have sold
[01:57:42] it before the new ones came out because
[01:57:43] they pumped those out and now they're
[01:57:45] all
[01:57:46] $30 but it's a still a sweet card to be
[01:57:49] playing with with it's a really good
[01:57:50] carard to be playing with so I'm going
[01:57:52] to do here another pack deal and we're
[01:57:54] going to go on we're going to do this
[01:57:55] for a pack deal
[01:57:57] here we going to do this for a pack deal
[01:57:59] random like I said I just pull random
[01:58:02] packs for my buy now so if there's
[01:58:03] something in your in my buy now that you
[01:58:05] want that's like a three of them that
[01:58:07] you want I'll put them up here and uh do
[01:58:09] a pack deal for you it's just um I like
[01:58:11] to do three at a time because it helps
[01:58:13] save my whatnot fees and if I can save
[01:58:16] on whatnot fees I pass that saving on to
[01:58:19] you
[01:58:20] that's really what it is so I'll
[01:58:22] figure we'll throw this on here
[01:58:28] [Music]
[01:58:30] for yeah why not we'll throw that on
[01:58:33] there for
[01:58:34] 13 those three packs on screen for 13
[01:58:37] and this is going to be one of my last
[01:58:39] probably one of my last things I'm going
[01:58:41] to be doing
[01:58:43] here tried to buy the three Exon
[01:58:45] collector but it says it's not available
[01:58:46] it is not available there are only two
[01:58:49] Exelon collectors available that is zero
[01:58:51] there should be zero there actually it's
[01:58:53] actually should have been taken out of
[01:58:55] my um my buy now actually I don't know
[01:58:58] why the ion is in there but if you want
[01:59:01] the last
[01:59:03] two yeah because I don't even see it in
[01:59:05] mine I took it out of it if you want the
[01:59:08] last two in another pack uh like a draft
[01:59:11] or something I'll do I'll do a deal for
[01:59:12] you if that's what you
[01:59:14] like so uh the last two here and say
[01:59:17] like an Exelon draft
[01:59:21] now so the last two of these in an Exon
[01:59:24] draft let me see what I got there uh
[01:59:26] give me a second put these
[01:59:42] away I mean the last two we'll call
[01:59:48] it
[01:59:51] it'll say 50 for the for the last two in
[01:59:54] in the draft would that sound like a
[01:59:56] good deal for
[02:00:01] you all
[02:00:13] right pretty much getting a pack free
[02:00:17] here if anybody else is in there wants
[02:00:19] to try
[02:00:22] it I don't mind doing
[02:00:25] that almost yeah not a bad deal
[02:00:32] there but any yeah we'll see what we got
[02:00:34] for uh for this we got the last of these
[02:00:37] here we have we haven't pulled anything
[02:00:40] major big out of it so I I really if I
[02:00:43] could if we could get like a uh you know
[02:00:46] uh monoc Crypt or one of the Jurassic
[02:00:49] Park stamp
[02:00:51] cards yes I love Jurassic Park crossover
[02:00:56] I love how they did it too see like they
[02:00:59] didn't do it where it was a whole set
[02:01:01] they put it into it like I feel like
[02:01:04] Lord of the Rings they could have done
[02:01:05] that too and brought it into one rather
[02:01:07] than make another set but I feel like if
[02:01:09] they do more of them like this where
[02:01:11] they bring an IP in to it it's better
[02:01:14] for magic than having just the separate
[02:01:16] IP yes exactly yes you bring an IP into
[02:01:20] it you put it part of it you make it
[02:01:22] part of what's already there for magic
[02:01:23] but you have it as a special cards that
[02:01:25] are like the chase cards that are in
[02:01:27] there to make it so that you're still
[02:01:28] playing Magic but you're playing it with
[02:01:30] a cool extra card in there every now and
[02:01:32] again that's that's I don't know that's
[02:01:34] me but all right here's the last two
[02:01:36] here's our last two here and that so
[02:01:38] what I'm going to do is I'm gonna open
[02:01:39] the draft first and then I will open
[02:01:42] those last two yes it feels better that
[02:01:44] way it feels like you're playing Magic
[02:01:46] you're not playing another game that has
[02:01:50] magic mechanics if that makes sense hey
[02:01:54] no problem
[02:01:59] underworld we're going to do this and
[02:02:01] again we do one two three four and five
[02:02:04] because they put the spoilers in the
[02:02:06] front and I don't like that I like the
[02:02:08] spoilers in the
[02:02:09] back I appreciate you too underworld

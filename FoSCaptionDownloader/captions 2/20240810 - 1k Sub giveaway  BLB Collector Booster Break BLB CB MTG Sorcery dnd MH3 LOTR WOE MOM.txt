[00:11:15] the rest of that
[00:11:17] box now that's a nice little one and
[00:11:19] instead of oh another it looks like
[00:11:21] another $8 card we'll throw out for

[00:11:29] then I think this will be my last one
[00:11:31] out of this
[00:11:34] pack and then we'll go on to our next
[00:11:36] pack there to see what we do h no we'll
[00:11:39] hold on to that for for later no one
[00:11:42] wanted oh we have smoothies going with
[00:11:44] it I like it
[00:11:45] smoothies let's get your name written on
[00:11:47] the back of that one now just so you are
[00:11:49] aware these go the reason why these go
[00:11:52] cheap is they go to top loader in one of
[00:11:54] these plain wide envelopes I'm going to
[00:11:55] zoom out so you can see so it goes in
[00:11:58] top loader and actually it's one of
[00:11:59] these plane wide
[00:12:00] envelopes so it's going to do this
[00:12:02] exactly this is the reason why I have it
[00:12:04] Cheap
[00:12:06] shipping smoothie most people don't care
[00:12:10] um the only reason I mention it is
[00:12:11] because it's like regular like mail as
[00:12:13] if it's going in the mail like you drop
[00:12:16] a letter in the mail that's why it's
[00:12:17] called plain white envelope but that's
[00:12:19] also the reason why it's so rather than
[00:12:21] spending like four or five dollars on
[00:12:23] shipping you spend a dollar or less so
[00:12:24] it Go in something like that my friend
[00:12:26] most people don't care but if you do we
[00:12:28] can always do like a refund and you can
[00:12:29] buy it with a regular shipping but it's
[00:12:31] like $4 for that
[00:12:33] stuff but anyways let's go on to our
[00:12:35] next pack here and see what we get for
[00:12:37] luck remember this is what we got out of
[00:12:39] our last one last box there I don't know
[00:12:41] maybe we'll get some luck on things
[00:12:43] we'll get some cool stuff we'll find out
[00:12:45] we'll find
[00:12:53] out well thank you I appreciate that
[00:12:55] Cody yeah I um I am I'm a I'm weird
[00:12:59] weird with it comes to the packaging on
[00:13:01] things I like to make sure everything is
[00:13:03] overly
[00:13:05] protected let's go I know 25 more to go

[00:28:30] want so
[00:28:33] midnight
[00:28:37] hunt all right there we
[00:28:43] go I know what is going really bad on
[00:28:46] slowness on everything right
[00:28:53] now should be nothing going on right now
[00:28:55] that's causing this slowness because my
[00:28:58] computer is fine with all everything in
[00:29:00] this end which is really
[00:29:07] weird all right anyways I'm going to try
[00:29:09] running this as the auction here because
[00:29:12] it is working for
[00:29:14] me to see this
[00:29:18] here and this is a uh what I think this
[00:29:21] is a $4 card right somebody already did
[00:29:25] that for
[00:29:26] me so
[00:29:28] four card we're going to throw it out
[00:29:30] for three for you
[00:29:33] guys uh no nothing big hit out of the $2
[00:29:36] box at Squiggy nothing has been big hit
[00:29:38] out of the $2 one now the way the $2 one
[00:29:40] goes for that need to know is you pull
[00:29:42] one card at a time and if you get a card
[00:29:44] that's worth $2 or more we stop or if
[00:29:47] you get a booster of some kind we stop
[00:29:49] and that's what you get or you keep
[00:29:50] pulling until you get three cards if you
[00:29:53] don't hit one of those scenarios at some
[00:29:54] point all right war and War leader
[00:29:57] rabbit let's put that over
[00:30:00] here and our these are the things we
[00:30:03] pulled out maybe a little I know
[00:30:04] somebody was looking for a kidnap the
[00:30:06] other day so let me put that up
[00:30:13] there put that out there oh we don't
[00:30:16] have that's not a big one that's not a
[00:30:17] big one who was looking for that you
[00:30:18] know what who was looking for that I
[00:30:20] think there were a regular that's in
[00:30:21] here we might need to next time you get
[00:30:23] an order I might throw that in for you
[00:30:25] we'll find
[00:30:26] out but I Fountain Port I think is a
[00:30:29] couple dollars and if it isn't I'm wrong
[00:30:32] on a lot of things because the pricing
[00:30:33] has been changing then a lot quicker
[00:30:35] than I
[00:30:36] expected yes it is a couple dollars so
[00:30:39] we're going to throw that out for $2
[00:30:40] instead of
[00:30:41] three little Fountain port and foil and
[00:30:45] our giveaway went to our buddy
[00:30:47] Squiggy look at that Squiggy you got
[00:30:50] yourself a Vine reap Mentor all right
[00:30:53] not the big hit out of there but you
[00:30:55] know what squeegy that helps I think
[00:30:56] that helps get you a little discount on
[00:30:57] your shipping I do believe if you have
[00:31:00] not hit the threshold yet I do believe
[00:31:02] that helps and you're going to go with
[00:31:03] number six all right I like
[00:31:05] it number
[00:31:11] six here we go I need to add a card
[00:31:14] because we have one less
[00:31:17] now
[00:31:19] Shuffle one two three four five and six
[00:31:23] here we
[00:31:24] go let's see if that ends up being a
[00:31:27] rare card that's in there that you guys
[00:31:29] saw I going to run this we're going to
[00:31:32] keep running our giveaways continuously
[00:31:33] like we always do here because it's not
[00:31:36] too bad for me to do that with you guys
[00:31:38] and then what we're going to do is we'll
[00:31:40] uh we'll keep throwing out some of our

[00:31:49] be the middle of the stream or the end
[00:31:50] of the stream it really depends on where
[00:31:52] and we hit
[00:31:53] it starl steelberg is not a big hit
[00:31:56] there ah I've never seen that one pulled
[00:31:58] out in this format of it so I was
[00:32:00] expecting it to be worth a little bit

[01:53:27] happen to get to say um 350 checkins
[01:53:31] right now we're at 172 so if we get to
[01:53:34] 175 we're gonna end up doing at the end
[01:53:36] of the stream we have a giveaway that
[01:53:37] we'll do in the end of the stream
[01:53:39] giveaway will be a bloomo Bo play
[01:53:41] booster if we get to 175 checkins but if
[01:53:44] we happen to get to 350 checkins it's
[01:53:47] going to end up being two Bloom bro
[01:53:49] boosters so that's kind of why we have
[01:53:51] that g setting up like that we hang out
[01:53:53] we do those things that
[01:53:54] way it's a little fabled
[01:54:00] passage you gonna get 350 there all
[01:54:02] right I'll put a little Nissa who who
[01:54:05] shakes maybe somebody needs that niss
[01:54:06] out
[01:54:09] there you just join the checkins if you
[01:54:11] type SL checkin that bar across on the
[01:54:13] top there helps to G gr grow the amount
[01:54:16] of check-ins that we have and what
[01:54:18] happens is is it allows me to know that
[01:54:20] you guys are in here hanging out with us
[01:54:22] by you guys hanging out with us in here
[01:54:23] I end up raising what we do for our
[01:54:25] giveaways at the end of The Stream So we
[01:54:27] end up going from maybe a pack to a
[01:54:29] collector to to couple play boosters to
[01:54:32] a collector booster something like that
[01:54:34] so here this is what it boils down to is
[01:54:35] this do check
[01:54:39] goals here check
[01:54:42] goals for all you hanging out in chat
[01:54:44] there it is that tells you what it is
[01:54:46] exactly if we get to 350 we get two
[01:54:48] boosters if we hav to get to 350 after
[01:54:51] that we'll go three boosters if somehow
[01:54:52] we get to a 1,500 check-ins I'm going to
[01:54:56] end up giving a collector booster of my
[01:54:58] choice that's what we do there yeah

[03:00:34] could get three or you could get 10
[03:00:36] cards just because you get 10 cards that

[04:07:36] know we also have a chamia the seed
[04:07:39] meiser here there you go
[04:07:45] but there's that one for that's a good
[04:07:46] looking card right there for
[04:07:49] Ren yeah I know it's $110 versus the 120
[04:07:54] uh you know online so I always try to
[04:07:55] give it a little bit off that way you
[04:07:57] get a discount on shipping and it's not
[04:07:59] like over the top with what the card is
[04:08:01] I mean and the reason why I have to sell
[04:08:02] them at that much is just like that's
[04:08:04] what I pulled out of the box and if I
[04:08:05] don't sell that then I lose the money on
[04:08:07] the box so I kind of have to do it at
[04:08:09] that there what's up hun nothing how's

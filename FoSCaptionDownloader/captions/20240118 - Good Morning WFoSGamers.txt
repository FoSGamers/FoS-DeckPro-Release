[00:12:21] through the singles is kind of what I'm
[00:12:22] going to do if that makes any sense I
[00:12:24] don't know um but so what I'm going to

[00:14:33] that I got here if anybody wants any of
[00:14:36] them just uh I'm going to throw on right
[00:14:38] after this is up here a

[00:15:02] for you and uh you want to stack them up
[00:15:04] you can stack them
[00:15:06] up there we go but I'm just going to
[00:15:08] kind of go through these
[00:15:11] here there we go no one wanted the pack
[00:15:16] deal so I'm going to throw on the uh

[00:15:31] a minute though so I can finish going
[00:15:32] through the
[00:15:33] singles and if you want any of the ones
[00:15:35] that you've been seeing just

[00:27:48] here hopefully you guys are liking it
[00:27:50] now what I'm going to do I'm going to

[00:28:03] 34
[00:28:05] three 34 for these three

[00:28:15] here for a little while before I start
[00:28:16] work try those three packs out oh I
[00:28:19] think yeah smartass likes those I like

[00:28:25] any
[00:28:26] um any FES yet I had three boxes so far
[00:28:29] Wilds well drain the last I'm not saying
[00:28:33] can't put any guarantees obviously never

[00:28:36] all drain box we ended up coming out
[00:28:38] with one confetti almost out of every
[00:28:41] other box so I was a little confused on
[00:28:43] why I only got this I think it's because
[00:28:45] I didn't buy a case this time and I've
[00:28:46] been buying them in separates so I don't
[00:28:48] know we'll have to see we'll have to see

[00:35:06] tutor now if there's any other one that

[00:53:39] any of these just swipe on over or say
[00:53:43] which one it is and uh or you can stack

[00:53:47] we're going to
[00:53:49] um do a pack
[00:53:52] deal I might not have put enough time on
[00:53:54] to show all these
[00:53:56] I had more than I expected here so I
[00:53:58] might need to run this again here for a
[00:54:00] minute because I thought I had I thought
[00:54:02] I had less for some reason but that's
[00:54:03] okay if you like any of them they are
[00:54:06] nice ones that are
[00:54:13] here but we got a bunch of singles they
[00:54:16] $3 each just kind of going through them
[00:54:19] can't read them off all quickly like
[00:54:21] this because I put it on for a a minute
[00:54:24] and change
[00:54:26] but if there's one you're looking for
[00:54:28] that you want all you got to say is you
[00:54:30] want
[00:54:32] it get them up for
[00:54:37] you in that time

[00:54:50] know no one wanted any of those that's

[00:55:05] more singles after but I got a bunch of
[00:55:07] them I went through a bunch of my
[00:55:08] singles the other day so now I have a
[00:55:11] ton to actually kind of go through now
[00:55:16] so hey wazer how's it going hey my my
[00:55:19] stuff is working again I got it working
[00:55:21] I fixed it I fixed it you can hear me
[00:55:26] all right so we're going to do another
[00:55:28] uh another one like this we're not going
[00:55:30] to do we're not going to do a collector
[00:55:32] booster again because I had done a
[00:55:34] couple of collector boosters and no one
[00:55:36] had jumped in on them so we're gonna do
[00:55:39] some draft we're gonna go for some
[00:55:48] drafts my wife said I got I was quoting
[00:55:51] movies like I normally do on a regular
[00:55:53] basis um told me that I needed
[00:55:57] to show as I say random quotes all the
[00:56:02] time and she's
[00:56:04] like James do that to the people that
[00:56:07] might actually know what you're talking
[00:56:08] about because none of none of us here
[00:56:11] which is all my family members which is
[00:56:13] my wife my mom my sister or my children
[00:56:17] have a clue what you're talking about so
[00:56:18] how about you just like uh like say it
[00:56:21] to somebody that might actually know the
[00:56:22] reference to either the movie or the TV
[00:56:25] show or whatever obscure thing you're
[00:56:28] talking about to like maybe a group of
[00:56:30] people that might have an idea what
[00:56:31] you're talking about like yeah maybe
[00:56:34] I'll start throwing like all right that
[00:56:36] kind of makes sense I understand that so
[00:56:39] you're GNA throw these on for
[00:56:41] 16 if you want
[00:56:45] them if you want
[00:56:48] them pretty good pack deal for some uh
[00:56:51] Exon try to hunt down one of those uh
[00:56:54] either d dinos or a nice uh I don't know
[00:56:56] I I pulled out Caverns from one of these
[00:56:58] before so that was interesting that
[00:56:59] threw me the really off like today we
[00:57:01] pulled out the in the middle the middle
[00:57:03] pack was a demonic tutor out of a
[00:57:05] Mystery Pack that was nuts that was
[00:57:07] crazy too like weird figur that would
[00:57:10] have been on the end you know but so be
[00:57:12] it so be it
[00:57:16] right all righty no one wants these but
[00:57:19] that's
[00:57:21] okay I will go put those back and I will
[00:57:24] throw some singles on again actually I'm
[00:57:27] going to put a pull box you know what
[00:57:28] I'm going to do I'm going to do a pull
[00:57:29] box deal so I can scroll through the
[00:57:31] singles that I
[00:57:33] have and then I will put the singles p
[00:57:36] uh on for the raffle uh for the raffle
[00:57:39] for the uh auction right after that's
[00:57:42] what I think I'm gonna do I just drop
[00:57:44] that where' that
[00:57:46] go there it goes that's what I think I'm
[00:57:49] going to do I'm going to throw on a uh
[00:57:51] uh a little bit of
[00:57:53] a
[00:57:55] deal for these here we're going to do it
[00:57:57] for a minute and change that way I have
[00:58:00] some time to go

[00:58:09] which are going to come up right after
[00:58:10] this pull box if you want them that's

[00:58:28] of them to read off there you can see
[00:58:30] them I'm going through them most of them
[00:58:34] are foils so a lot of times I open
[00:58:37] collector booster packs because I'm a
[00:58:40] glutton for punishment I guess you would
[00:58:42] call it I don't
[00:58:44] know I do sometimes get uh drafts and
[00:58:48] set boxes but a lot of times I end up
[00:58:50] either selling those off or uh keeping
[00:58:54] them
[00:58:55] uh for the kids to play with and do like
[00:58:57] car like do like a DRFT our house self

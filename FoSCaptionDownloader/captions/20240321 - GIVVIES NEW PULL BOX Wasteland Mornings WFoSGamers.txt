[00:16:07] a strong human wandering through this
[00:16:08] Wasteland now when you're a strong human
[00:16:10] you wander through you look for food 1 2
[00:16:13] 3 4 5 6 78 as your F first thing in that
[00:16:17] red box there so we're hoping we find
[00:16:19] some food there as we uh go through this
[00:16:21] Wasteland now what I'm going to do is
[00:16:24] we're going to do this we're going to
[00:16:25] shuffle these ones so you can get your
[00:16:27] eight here and then we're going to flip
[00:16:29] them all over and we're going to see

[00:16:51] as a strong human let me expand this a
[00:16:53] little bit so we can see a little better
[00:16:55] tip it down some there you go and as you
[00:16:59] wander through this Wasteland as a human
[00:17:01] you look for food hopefully you can find
[00:17:04] something along the way but you do not
[00:17:07] find food you get some unluckiness
[00:17:09] coming out on this morning you do end up
[00:17:11] finding a treasure you pick that
[00:17:13] treasure up and you just happens to be
[00:17:14] booby trapped luckily you are smart
[00:17:17] enough to drop it and you run it blows
[00:17:19] up but it blows you a little bit into
[00:17:21] the distance leaving you with a
[00:17:22] concussion so you only get two strength
[00:17:25] as you wander through this Wasteland
[00:17:26] today and as you go through you are
[00:17:29] hopefully wandering you pick up and go
[00:17:30] to a friend maybe that can help you
[00:17:32] along the way but oh no we're not having
[00:17:35] some luck this morning I friend you

[00:58:03] there in the back please do remember to
[00:58:05] follow us on YouTube and Instagram we
[00:58:07] hang out here all the time and that's
[00:58:09] the reason why we do it is to afford to

[00:58:14] some more shorts up let me know what you

[00:58:19] and if you don't like them please let me
[00:58:21] know I don't have as many views as I
[00:58:22] used to have so I might need to go back
[00:58:24] to the old way
[00:58:28] and I will put something up and I'll go
[00:58:29] through some of my singles again here
[00:58:32] all right no one wanted to go the ouch
[00:58:34] my wallet so we'll leave that right
[00:58:35] there we'll put the Vault right over
[00:58:38] there the Vault pack right now is a
[00:58:40] uh
[00:58:43] 1993 oh that's uh that's an interesting
[00:58:46] one
[00:58:47] there that's an interesting one there
[00:58:49] anyways we'll put this up um for uh
[00:58:53] Adventure game we'll put a Fallout you
[00:58:56] know what let's do this I'm going to
[00:58:58] open up this is literally my last box of
[00:59:00] followup for anyone
[00:59:02] here we have none of it left after this
[00:59:06] what I ordered did not end up coming in
[00:59:09] I'm very annoyed about that because I
[00:59:11] would have ordered from different places
[00:59:13] rather than ordering m i next time in a
[00:59:15] release like this I'm going to end up
[00:59:16] ordering early and ordering like one or
[00:59:19] two from like 50 places cuz next because
[00:59:22] happened was I ordered uh a chunk from
[00:59:25] one place and they only sent me two of
[00:59:26] the boxes so I'm guessing they uh didn't
[00:59:29] have enough to send they didn't cancel
[00:59:31] the order so then I had to do other
[00:59:32] stuff you know all that fun so we have
[00:59:35] the first one on the right
[00:59:39] there you got plenty of Assassin's
[00:59:42] Creed I know you got a lot of that for a
[00:59:44] again I know I tried um I on getting
[00:59:47] some a good chunk of that too but hey
[00:59:49] we'll see what happens with that one if
[00:59:51] it ends up being another one of these
[00:59:52] Fallout ones but Assassin's Creed though
[00:59:55] see the thing is though from what I'm
[00:59:56] seeing is Assassin's Creed is going to
[00:59:58] be kind of like um it's like the small
[01:00:01] packs for some reason and that's all
[01:00:03] they doing in small packs with it like
[01:00:05] um like aftermath like why are why are
[01:00:09] they doing that I don't understand that

[01:41:25] take care of that one now though I'm
[01:41:26] going put it in one anyways nice hits on
[01:41:29] that we like that we like
[01:41:32] it they did a really good job with the
[01:41:35] set I will agree they did an excellent
[01:41:37] job with the set I do have the commander
[01:41:39] decks if anybody wants them um I do have
[01:41:42] some of the commander
[01:41:43] decks I wish they had done a lot more of
[01:41:46] them let me put up an adventure for you
[01:41:48] okay for whoever for that for this is
[01:41:50] I'm going to do for you that um for you
[01:41:52] were questioning to get into the
[01:41:53] Adventure you can tell me what packs you
[01:41:55] want all right whatever packs you want
[01:41:57] and we'll add we'll put them in the
[01:41:58] adventure and I'll put them up here like
[01:42:00] three four packs at a time right now I'm
[01:42:02] just going to put this one up here just
[01:42:04] so that you got have a little bit of an
[01:42:06] understanding and then I'll go uh I'll
[01:42:08] explain the adventure because you do
[01:42:10] have an animated Wasteland when you go
[01:42:12] through
[01:42:14] it so I'm going to put this up here for
[01:42:16] one of them while I get this packed up
[01:42:18] for our buddy
[01:42:26] Smokey
[01:42:31] one all right sounds good I'll do
[01:42:36] that what deck wait wait what deck was
[01:42:40] it
[01:42:43] Jupiter Smokey there you
[01:42:46] go nice
[01:42:51] hits all right right we didn't want that
[01:42:53] so with the game what you would do is if
[01:42:55] you play the game you buy whatever the
[01:42:56] packs is this would be like two strength
[01:42:58] in your adventure you go in the
[01:42:59] adventure in the Wasteland you have your
[01:43:01] character so kind of this is a little
[01:43:03] example that is not correct on I don't
[01:43:05] think that's correct on the cost of
[01:43:06] everything I have to adjust a lot of
[01:43:08] that but um the point is that's kind of
[01:43:10] like my little little bit of how I do
[01:43:12] plus or minus for the strength but I
[01:43:15] more or less say call monetary wise I
[01:43:18] feel like one should be how much
[01:43:19] strength so like this I'll say I think
[01:43:22] this should be twoo strength on your
[01:43:23] adventure through the Wasteland and then
[01:43:26] uh you know we'll add in you know why
[01:43:28] not add some dragons and we'll make that
[01:43:31] three strength on your adventure in the
[01:43:32] Wasteland there
[01:43:36] okay and then we'll put that up for this
[01:43:39] here then you get to do that wayel
[01:43:41] Adventure if you jump on
[01:43:43] it you go through the adventure if you
[01:43:45] beat the boss you always you always get
[01:43:48] the Vault pack whether you beat the boss
[01:43:49] or not you always get the Vault pack but
[01:43:52] if you beat the boss there ends up being
[01:43:54] a $1 Loot drop for the entire Wasteland
[01:43:57] which are all of you that are hanging
[01:43:59] out with us so that's what we do there
[01:44:02] that's how we kind of hang out when we
[01:44:03] do
[01:44:05] that all right so let me
[01:44:08] see what else I have here going to see

[01:49:21] have a box cutter and and my wife was
[01:49:22] help and cutting she's like this is
[01:49:23] really hard so I was looking for a
[01:49:24] different thing to cut so I found this
[01:49:26] electric thing that cuts boxes it cuts
[01:49:28] like vinyl and like leather and stuff

[01:49:32] perfect just what I need cheap
[01:49:34] chargeable handheld wonderful well I'm
[01:49:38] reading the the um like the reviews and
[01:49:40] somebody's like gave it a three stars
[01:49:43] they said it doesn't cut and doesn't
[01:49:44] have the strength that I expected it I
[01:49:46] was trying to cut tile with it and it
[01:49:47] wouldn't work I'm
[01:49:49] like the who the what you're trying to
[01:49:53] cut tile with a $20 freaking like thing
[01:49:56] that cuts paper like and you expect like
[01:50:02] what what and that's why when you said
[01:50:05] tile I'm like you got to be kidding
[01:50:08] me like I've done tile I've done
[01:50:11] flooring multiple times in multiple
[01:50:13] houses and like it I generally did the
[01:50:16] um you know the uh the floating floors
[01:50:18] you click them in type thing but oh my
[01:50:21] God sometimes it's just crazy crazy
[01:50:24] crazy what it's like just I don't
[01:50:27] understand
[01:50:28] it like you don't it's like one of those
[01:50:30] things where you like people say stuff
[01:50:32] and you're like is that a
[01:50:35] joke are you being serious this is a
[01:50:38] joke right here we go we're going to run

[01:50:45] strength on your adventure I know right

[01:50:59] see if you guys want to jump in hanging
[01:51:02] out here with our giveaway we'll do our
[01:51:05] toxic SE seep Squatch in our automated
[01:51:08] assembly
[01:51:09] line you're putting in carpet right now
[01:51:12] you know you know that would have this
[01:51:13] got this may have been this may be able
[01:51:15] to cut carpet but it's no way going to
[01:51:17] cut
[01:51:18] tile dude exactly I have ties I had I
[01:51:22] borrowed friends um uh like you know the
[01:51:26] table saw to do all my stuff when I was
[01:51:28] doing the floors you know it's like a
[01:51:30] thewalt big table saw that's like an you
[01:51:32] know $800,000 table saw you let me
[01:51:34] borrow it I gave back to him you know
[01:51:36] whatever but for Jesus like these people
[01:51:38] think like this little handheld thing
[01:51:39] that's I think it's like this big
[01:51:40] personally if I remember right the
[01:51:42] description looked like it was that big
[01:51:44] like how do you expect that to cut
[01:51:45] through
[01:51:46] tile like really but anyways that's the
[01:51:49] special of some people in this world now
[01:51:51] it didn't do what I was expecting
[01:51:52] because I bought something to do
[01:51:53] something that didn't make say it could
[01:51:55] do but because it didn't do what it said
[01:51:57] it couldn't do I'm going to be mad at it
[01:51:59] it's all its fault it's the fault it's

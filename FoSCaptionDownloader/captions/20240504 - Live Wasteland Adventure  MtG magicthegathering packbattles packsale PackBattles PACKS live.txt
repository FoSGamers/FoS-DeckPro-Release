[00:00:33] this Saturday morning a little bit later
[00:00:35] today I have to go and uh do my due
[00:00:38] diligence to my boat and change some
[00:00:39] zincs out so that I can hopefully go out
[00:00:41] fishing tomorrow which I don't's the
[00:00:43] reason why I don't have anything listed
[00:00:44] tomorrow for shows is because I was
[00:00:46] planning on going up F
[00:00:48] fishing as long as I can get the zincs
[00:00:51] fixed and everything works well with the
[00:00:52] boat which is a cross your finger
[00:00:54] scenario more than anything
[00:01:04] I know it's not Friday but not a bad
[00:01:06] song right here
[00:01:17] now
[00:01:20] failed well that
[00:01:22] stinks try that again

[00:02:30] little thank you for hanging out with us
[00:02:31] yesterday it did not run because there
[00:02:32] was only one person that was in here so

[00:17:39] 13th getting you guys all with some
[00:17:41] shows
[00:17:45] here that way you have a schedule
[00:17:49] going and you guys can come and hang out
[00:17:51] with me on a regular basis now that's if
[00:17:54] you want
[00:17:55] to not everybody likes hanging out with
[00:17:58] me I guess
[00:17:59] some people like to go other places cuz
[00:18:01] they like more of a a gambling scenario
[00:18:03] where're I'm more of a game
[00:18:06] scenario but I do like that idea of uh
[00:18:09] some pull boxes cuz at least we the pull
[00:18:11] boxes the way those were being shown to
[00:18:12] me the other day the way I like to do
[00:18:14] them is I like to have all the things
[00:18:15] shown in odds and and the prices on them
[00:18:18] so that like you get a good you know
[00:18:20] exactly what you're getting you don't
[00:18:21] need to worry about like not getting
[00:18:24] what you pulled or what what you're
[00:18:25] expecting and that's why I like doing
[00:18:27] all of them though I've always like
[00:18:28] doing them the way of I've done them is
[00:18:30] because they're always done where you
[00:18:32] get a you know exactly what you getting
[00:18:34] like with the with the
[00:18:37] um like with the uh mystery bags that I
[00:18:41] got up here you guys have like they're
[00:18:44] they're currently significantly primed
[00:18:46] for you
[00:18:48] guys because they are at the point where
[00:18:51] there's most of the floors were pulled
[00:18:53] out and that means there's like probably
[00:18:55] only 15 floors left and there's more
[00:18:57] majority of them are ceiling typ things
[00:18:59] so that means what I mean that's why I
[00:19:01] said like we we Prime we have good deals
[00:19:03] on our games for all of you which is why
[00:19:06] we do those mystery bags the way we do
[00:19:08] here who wants some Fallout because that
[00:19:10] is in there if you're going to try
[00:19:12] yourself on
[00:19:22] Fallout all righty how's it going
[00:19:24] everybody no one wanted those we'll try
[00:19:28] some more
[00:19:28] [Music]
[00:19:32] more all right that was the
[00:19:39] 15th we're going to run let's be done
[00:19:42] with that one and let's select from the
[00:19:44] shop instead let's do 10 red buttons 10
[00:19:47] red buttons for you guys who wants to go
[00:19:49] after
[00:19:52] that uh wonderful collector booster of M
[00:19:55] of Lord of the Rings cuz the rate this
[00:19:57] is going I might need to end up having
[00:19:59] to break down some of these cuz I don't
[00:20:01] I don't like doing that cuz I feel like
[00:20:02] I end up screwing people that bought in
[00:20:04] but at the same time if it's not being
[00:20:06] done no one's using it I also got to I
[00:20:09] got to you know I got to use what's in
[00:20:11] there and sell stuff I can't just sit on
[00:20:12] it forever so that being said I might
[00:20:16] end up having to break that down if
[00:20:18] people don't start jumping in on that
[00:20:20] one on a
[00:20:21] larger basis

[00:25:56] from a store then I got to go and um
[00:25:59] update I mean uh replace the zinc on it
[00:26:02] then a couple of the motors and then uh
[00:26:04] so that way hopefully tomorrow we can go
[00:26:06] out on a little trip in our uh go on a
[00:26:10] little fishing trip which is why I did
[00:26:12] not have a show tomorrow
[00:26:14] actually well that's actually that's the
[00:26:16] reason
[00:26:19] why does not
[00:26:21] repeat
[00:26:23] daily every for a number of show after a
[00:26:27] number of shows two shows
[00:26:30] schedule you got at work tonight ah at
[00:26:33] work you know what we got to love work
[00:26:36] right if you don't have work you you
[00:26:37] don't have money but uh if you don't
[00:26:40] have if you didn't have to work you
[00:26:41] might have a better life at the same
[00:26:43] time so it's one of those like what do
[00:26:45] we do
[00:26:50] here sometimes it's a it's that
[00:26:52] conundrum that conundrum of like what do
[00:26:54] you do do you continue to work or do you
[00:26:56] just give up and be homeless like some
[00:26:58] some of the people you see hanging
[00:26:59] around feel like sometimes they have
[00:27:01] that life figured
[00:27:03] out maybe they do they just roll around
[00:27:06] on bikes all day down here in
[00:27:09] Florida and they
[00:27:12] uh that's all they do roll around on
[00:27:14] bikes down here like you know what
[00:27:16] that's actually not a bad deal at least
[00:27:19] where we are down here generally good
[00:27:21] weather if it starts getting cooler you
[00:27:23] just kind of go a little bit more
[00:27:24] further south
[00:27:28] I got to change the music
[00:27:31] now we to
[00:27:40] go I can't do this now I got to change
[00:27:43] it I have to change it I can tolerate it
[00:27:45] for a little while but not so long we're
[00:27:49] going to rerun we'll run uh the
[00:27:51] adventure now if you want to jump on the
[00:27:53] adventure jump on
[00:27:56] in each uh the increments are a dollar I
[00:27:59] don't know why I keep saying it's less
[00:28:00] you know clear this let's do this edit
[00:28:06] product
[00:28:08] increments doesn't show me the bit of
[00:28:10] increments on that okay I have to do you
[00:28:12] every
[00:28:13] time all right I do have to do it every
[00:28:15] time all right never
[00:28:19] mind there you go if you want to try our
[00:28:21] adventure game what's going on
[00:28:26] Mom I was just uh SK scheduling
[00:28:34] things
[00:28:35] 10 11 all right now I got to do
[00:28:39] 12 that's
[00:28:43] obnoxious yes no I don't I well the
[00:28:45] reason is is because I have to do them
[00:28:47] cuz 12 is an evening I can't do I just
[00:28:50] pick days and go through them all I can
[00:28:51] do multiple things at a row that one I
[00:28:53] have to do all I have to do them all
[00:28:55] individually oh which is a little bit of
[00:28:57] moous on that one that
[00:28:59] crap how's uh what you what is it that
[00:29:01] you do work again cool air I I keep I
[00:29:04] forget cuz I have so many people that I
[00:29:05] hang out with so I forget sometimes what
[00:29:07] what people do tonight Boo Boo I know my
[00:29:12] wife said boo I do not miss night
[00:29:15] shift I used to work night shift also
[00:29:19] yeah so I we we feel your pain a
[00:29:23] little we feel your pain that's why we
[00:29:27] make that comment
[00:29:29] yeah you're the pizza man okay all right
[00:29:32] all right well that St Steph likes it a
[00:29:34] little she loves she loves you now she
[00:29:37] goes you know what actually I love pizza
[00:29:39] um that's
[00:29:40] [Laughter]
[00:29:42] better one of my favorite food groups I
[00:29:46] know that's one of the few things that
[00:29:47] we'll be upset on when we go on a boat
[00:29:49] is that it's going to be hard to get
[00:29:50] pizza whenever you want we're going to
[00:29:52] make it I know but we can't get it
[00:29:55] whenever we want yes we can make it but
[00:29:57] it's not the same is going to somewhere
[00:29:58] and buying it and you know what I'm
[00:30:00] talking about well make grilled pizza
[00:30:02] that's always better than baked pizza
[00:30:05] ah they to
[00:30:07] differ no you're going to have to learn
[00:30:09] how to like my food I'm not saying I
[00:30:11] don't like your food I'm just saying
[00:30:12] you're have to learn Pizza in a in a in
[00:30:14] a pizza oven is a little
[00:30:16] different you have two degrees and you
[00:30:18] deliver pizza you know what man I uh my
[00:30:21] wife has actually she has hers I I was a
[00:30:24] pread major um and I do uh developing of
[00:30:30] apps my sister has a degree in for law
[00:30:33] stuff and she runs nurses like a like a
[00:30:36] doctor's office so
[00:30:39] like it takes time I I depending on how
[00:30:42] old you are I did stuff like that too
[00:30:44] for a while until I got like those entry
[00:30:47] level [ __ ] jobs that I had to get
[00:30:49] through which really does suck that you
[00:30:52] need those entry-level [ __ ] jobs it's
[00:30:53] like kind of like I just paid this much
[00:30:55] money to get 30 grand a year but yeah
[00:30:58] you do need to do that entry level crap
[00:31:00] job and it's nowadays it's even going
[00:31:01] back to it even worse I'm letting you
[00:31:02] know you had a little of a break of that
[00:31:04] during uh Co but right now they are
[00:31:06] screwing people a lot more more with
[00:31:08] this type of stuff so uh if you're going
[00:31:11] to try to find something and you want to
[00:31:13] get something in to do whatever I would
[00:31:15] um I'd be trying to find something soon
[00:31:17] before they cut even pay cuz I suspect
[00:31:19] they're going to be cutting pay yep in
[00:31:21] the not too distant future on all
[00:31:23] positions be oh we can't afford that we
[00:31:26] can't afford to pay you that and that's
[00:31:27] why they like either lay people off or
[00:31:30] they're going to be starting to cut pay
[00:31:32] yep change job descriptions change job
[00:31:34] my job descriptions already going to be
[00:31:36] different I have to I have to now I have
[00:31:38] to start learning development stuff
[00:31:40] which I don't mind doing but they're not
[00:31:42] paying me
[00:31:43] anymore so I have to do now do
[00:31:45] development stuff like coding which I've
[00:31:47] never really fully done uh but and
[00:31:51] that's what they want me to
[00:31:52] do at my job now even though I've never
[00:31:56] went to school for that and I'm not
[00:31:57] actually devel I'm not a developer but
[00:32:00] they want me to do it anyways well just
[00:32:02] think you can add that to a resume I
[00:32:05] know I can add it to my
[00:32:07] resume well my my degree I need in order
[00:32:10] to actually do my job you have business
[00:32:13] management and masters
[00:32:15] in
[00:32:17] science
[00:32:20] sociology m
[00:32:22] m information information systems
[00:32:30] oh I don't know what the is stands for
[00:32:32] information systems I got it hey you
[00:32:35] know what why so I have a question then
[00:32:39] is it that you're having a hard time
[00:32:40] finding something or is it that you
[00:32:42] don't like the jobs and you just go back
[00:32:44] cuz I know people that like that have
[00:32:45] Masters and business degrees and they
[00:32:48] they like ran they did pizza delivery
[00:32:50] and then they to because they wanted to
[00:32:52] own their own
[00:32:53] place doing that stuff is boring all
[00:32:56] right exactly see that's what I'm see
[00:32:57] see what I'm doing is boring I don't
[00:32:59] like it a lot myself so I'm trying to
[00:33:00] find something different to do and right
[00:33:02] now we're I mean literally I'm trying to
[00:33:04] look for I'm doing I do a remote job so

[00:40:15] doing a May the 4th show because of
[00:40:18] everybody and and then you know that
[00:40:20] type of thing but all everybody's doing
[00:40:21] that and I felt like I didn't that was
[00:40:23] going to be a little uh a little um you
[00:40:26] know common so I figured instead we
[00:40:30] might have a little um uniqueness thrown
[00:40:33] into the
[00:40:34] game relating to
[00:40:39] um our May the
[00:40:54] 4th ah uh

[00:41:07] some type of maybe um like you're on the
[00:41:09] list for a surgery to have one

[00:41:53] little weird but people cared enough
[00:41:56] about me to do something like this um
[00:42:00] and some of the people that I I've been
[00:42:02] friendly with through streaming and met
[00:42:04] that I hang out with on a regular basis
[00:42:05] through streaming and stuff they um were
[00:42:08] very nice and they uh they sent me a
[00:42:11] little gift when I was having a hard
[00:42:12] time me um when I got I had an an issue
[00:42:15] with suspension and I was having a hard

[00:43:07] I give stuff away and help people out
[00:43:08] and I don't know I guess
[00:43:11] uh I guess I had more of an impact and
[00:43:14] was friendly enough with them more than
[00:43:15] I was expecting that they wanted uh they
[00:43:18] thought to give me something here I
[00:43:20] don't know it was very weird I've never
[00:43:22] had stuff like that I actually got a
[00:43:24] little choked up when I saw it and I did
[00:43:26] make sure I said Thank you to every
[00:43:27] everyone I need to go on uh I am going
[00:43:29] to be doing another show uh somewhere to
[00:43:31] to say thank you
[00:43:33] also but there we go we're going to put
[00:43:34] our adventure packs out if you want to
[00:43:36] play yeah I know cool
[00:43:42] dice all righty here we go we got that
[00:43:44] there we got all of our things up we
[00:43:46] have oh look at this cool we got a Gong
[00:43:48] also ready so this is what we have now
[00:43:50] if we have we get a good hit I got this
[00:43:53] [Music]
[00:43:58] but that stays up there we get a good
[00:44:01] hit we get
[00:44:09] [Music]
[00:44:12] a hey enforcer how's it going this
[00:44:15] morning I saw you there and I lost you I
[00:44:18] didn't know if I I was missing because I
[00:44:19] was looking down at something I wasn't
[00:44:21] trying to be rude to you it was just I
[00:44:24] uh I was literally looking down and I
[00:44:26] just didn't look up and as soon as I
[00:44:27] looked up I said
[00:44:33] hi so I think what I'll do here
[00:44:37] is I think I might start doing
[00:44:42] um let's get our POG flip out maybe
[00:44:45] we'll do
[00:44:47] that we have a lot of games I was
[00:44:50] debating on actually making a new one so
[00:44:53] I like having the boxes that we do
[00:44:55] they're pretty fun
[00:44:58] uh some of the other boxes that I've
[00:44:59] made in the past like the small boxes
[00:45:01] like the 50 card boxes I've been
[00:45:04] debating on doing those and having them
[00:45:06] ready like once a day one one a day
[00:45:09] thing that'll be pretty rough for me to
[00:45:11] get going it'll be a lot of effort for
[00:45:13] me but I actually am debating on leaving
[00:45:15] my other job because I hate it that much
[00:45:17] right
[00:45:20] now that I'm actually debating on
[00:45:22] leaving my other job and doing this
[00:45:24] stuff a little full-time until we um get
[00:45:27] on our boat cuz I do have um if I do
[00:45:30] this fulltime I think I can actually
[00:45:32] afford enough once we pay for our boat
[00:45:34] outright that we can actually just live
[00:45:36] on it full time and uh not have to worry
[00:45:39] about it so with me doing I think I
[00:45:41] could make enough here between here and
[00:45:44] the other streaming and doing um some of
[00:45:46] the D and D things potentially cuz I
[00:45:49] have started a patron actually for those
[00:45:51] of you that like D and
[00:45:53] D all right some of you were liking the
[00:45:55] D and D stuff that I was doing before
[00:45:57] and for those of you that did like it I
[00:46:00] actually started a a patron and I'm
[00:46:02] going to start I was actually debating I
[00:46:03] was building a game here using uh rooll
[00:46:06] 20 and we were going to I was going to
[00:46:08] do like a D and D adventure and start it
[00:46:10] out and uh I figured if people want to
[00:46:12] do a patron and they want to have it
[00:46:13] that way they can help me um support me
[00:46:15] while we do our travels and do all of
[00:46:16] our all of our videos and do the um you
[00:46:19] know jump in and participate in the
[00:46:22] games on a regular basis or the stories
[00:46:24] thought that was something you would all
[00:46:25] be interested in this is is all facing
[00:46:27] the wrong
[00:46:39] direction stuff that down
[00:46:53] there broken
[00:46:57] was broken I was trying to fix it I
[00:46:59] think I fixed it we'll find
[00:47:02] out anyways it wasn't working earlier
[00:47:05] today and I was trying to fix that I
[00:47:07] have seizures so that stuff helps me
[00:47:09] with my
[00:47:13] seizures all righty so you know what I
[00:47:16] think we should do we are kind of at one
[00:47:17] of our points in our
[00:47:19] adventure we're
[00:47:21] uh I think we're getting to the boss
[00:47:24] area all right I think that's what we're
[00:47:25] doing at the moment is we're getting to
[00:47:27] the boss area but we need to have um
[00:47:30] some stuff go on and because we are
[00:47:33] currently um what I think we'll do here
[00:47:36] is I think we're going to leave the boss
[00:47:38] area maybe for a little
[00:47:40] bit and we're going to go back to that
[00:47:42] City since we got no one hanging out at
[00:47:44] the moment maybe we'll we'll try to
[00:47:46] stock up and trade some of our stuff I
[00:47:48] think that's might what we do before we
[00:47:50] H into the boss area cuz these things
[00:47:51] are getting stronger and you guys are
[00:47:52] starting to recognize it I believe I
[00:47:54] think that's what we might do what do
[00:47:55] you what do you think uh cool there
[00:47:57] think we should do that participate in
[00:47:59] that and try to uh see what happens
[00:48:01] there or maybe my other thing that I was
[00:48:03] debating on doing was opening a
[00:48:07] um opening one of my boxes of
[00:48:12] sorcery because I was planning on
[00:48:14] opening one for the family
[00:48:17] anyways I don't know if that's what I
[00:48:18] want to
[00:48:20] do or if I want to do a box opening
[00:48:23] video in and of itself
[00:48:27] or I can start opening them give them
[00:48:30] over to that person that cuts my videos
[00:48:32] and he can cut the video make it shorter
[00:48:34] in case we don't do it we can put he can
[00:48:36] put them all together o that might
[00:48:41] work I'll open some of
[00:48:43] them and then we'll do a we'll do I can
[00:48:46] do an even an intro and everything later
[00:48:49] saying what I what we opened oo
[00:48:52] intriguing that might work I might be
[00:48:54] able to do that cuz the way this channel
[00:48:56] goes it is sideway it is a long
[00:48:59] way um yeah the box is up there in the
[00:49:02] corner that's okay if people are seeing
[00:49:03] that that's okay if they're seeing me
[00:49:05] and all the other stuff around huh I
[00:49:09] wonder if I do
[00:49:10] that I wonder if I run
[00:49:13] that maybe that's what I do for a little
[00:49:15] while I do some um
[00:49:18] [Music]
[00:49:21] opening some stuff here of uh some
[00:49:23] boosters Maybe
[00:49:27] I think that's might be what I'll do cuz
[00:49:29] I was planning on opening a few of them
[00:49:31] anyways cuz I like the cards we like
[00:49:34] playing and I haven't had a chance to
[00:49:35] play yet I think we're going to play
[00:49:37] this weekend now that we don't have
[00:49:38] games all the time so I think that's
[00:49:40] what I'll end up doing I might I might
[00:49:42] do that I might open up some of them and
[00:49:45] for all of you that want to play our
[00:49:46] adventure game you'll just jump in when
[00:49:48] you
[00:49:49] want I put our our cool dice over here
[00:49:53] all right cool dice are going over there
[00:49:57] I'm going to minimize that I'm going to
[00:49:59] minimize that and we can always do the
[00:50:02] animated adventure for those of you that
[00:50:04] like
[00:50:05] it too but I believe this might be a
[00:50:09] good idea here this might be a good idea
[00:50:12] here I like that idea what do you
[00:50:17] think good idea cool or am I being silly

[00:53:19] supposed to go over yesterday then my
[00:53:20] mom came over and I got sidetracked

[00:53:24] earlier than I expected and then I got
[00:53:26] out late to go to drop something off to
[00:53:28] the post office and by the time I was
[00:53:30] getting over to that place I was like
[00:53:31] [ __ ] it's not it's 510 it's
[00:53:36] closed how long have I been live this
[00:53:38] month oh I have [ __ ] no
[00:53:41] idea let me take a look it's been a
[00:53:44] while I will tell you that one been a
[00:53:48] long
[00:53:51] while let's
[00:53:53] see see oh
[00:53:57] oh that's nice give me one second
[00:54:00] streams
[00:54:05] dashboard this
[00:54:07] month we're want to go with uh let's
[00:54:09] change that I don't know how to change
[00:54:10] that to uh going to
[00:54:15] streams this
[00:54:20] month number of streams I did 15 all
[00:54:23] right did 15 streams
[00:54:28] doesn't show me
[00:54:32] hours let me see if I can see ours no
[00:54:36] actually no soccer today um we are
[00:54:39] actually done with soccer for a little
[00:54:41] while uh they had tryouts they'll find
[00:54:44] out on Friday if they um if they made
[00:54:47] the team and yeah that's what we are
[00:54:51] we're seeing going on right now it
[00:54:53] doesn't show me how long I've been on
[00:54:56] you I thought it
[00:54:57] would tells me how many streams I've
[00:55:02] done tells me how many streams I've done
[00:55:06] but not like the
[00:55:11] hours I don't know I've been on for a
[00:55:13] while here I've done 15 streams we'll
[00:55:15] call those each two hours so that's 30
[00:55:18] hours on here and then uh the other yeah
[00:55:23] so probably about I don't know 40 hours
[00:55:25] is
[00:55:27] oh this morning this morning I've been
[00:55:29] on since uh 7 uh know 50 minutes not too
[00:55:32] long not too long not too much going on
[00:55:36] though hustling I know well my point
[00:55:39] what I'm thinking of doing is I'm trying
[00:55:40] to build out that um that uh D and D
[00:55:44] aspect of stuff that game master aspect
[00:55:46] cuz I think I can do that easier on my
[00:55:48] boat when we're traveling and that way
[00:55:50] when I like I can ship items like if we
[00:55:53] open packs and stuff they know it's
[00:55:54] going to be coming to them like a week
[00:55:55] later cuz I'm going to be doing a couple
[00:55:57] of games and maybe I'll do a few big
[00:55:59] games type
[00:56:00] thing yeah see I was trying to and then
[00:56:02] I I'm going to be doing um I have Patron
[00:56:05] set up for people that want to do just
[00:56:07] have me do a game master like be a D and
[00:56:09] D person their dungeon master because
[00:56:11] I've been building a little bit of a
[00:56:12] dungeon master game using roll 20 um
[00:56:15] using the Fallout thing so um I was
[00:56:18] thinking we could have some fun doing
[00:56:19] that for those of you that may want to
[00:56:21] be a uh have me be a dungeon
[00:56:24] master definitely I was yeah we said
[00:56:27] that earlier I'm good with that I like
[00:56:28] the idea of that I'm actually I think
[00:56:30] that's a great idea I'm I'm good with
[00:56:32] that idea there
[00:56:36] actually cuz I think that's not a bad
[00:56:38] idea to do stuff like that that way we
[00:56:39] can you know it get just get people
[00:56:41] involved more with what they're with
[00:56:43] what you're doing cuz for me um I think
[00:56:47] part of
[00:56:48] this the thing that people are
[00:56:52] missing yeah like a weekly thing exactly
[00:56:55] if it goes well we can do like a weekly
[00:56:56] thing so see what my thought here is I
[00:56:59] had said something when I started doing
[00:57:01] this a little bit I was like oh this
[00:57:02] could this worked out well and then a
[00:57:04] month into it I'm like people aren't
[00:57:06] doing this
[00:57:07] right uh so house we need to maybe talk
[00:57:10] offline because I have an idea I the way
[00:57:13] I'm thinking of it um with a couple of
[00:57:16] the other streamers if I can get them
[00:57:18] involved I have an exceptionally good
[00:57:21] idea and some good resources potentially
[00:57:24] um for getting it running um and I think
[00:57:27] all of you will like the idea of what
[00:57:30] I'm doing um so let's talk offline at
[00:57:34] some point um because I've already
[00:57:36] talked to a couple people and I have
[00:57:38] some stuff in motion I just kind of put
[00:57:40] it on halt because uh the moving on the
[00:57:43] boat thing has been taken up a little
[00:57:45] bit but if there's people interested I
[00:57:47] will put this into like you know full
[00:57:49] steam ahead motion and when I do full
[00:57:51] steam ahead stuff gets done quit I mean
[00:57:54] my my the people at that I work would
[00:57:56] have a hard time handling how quick it
[00:57:57] gets done now because somebody
[00:57:59] complained I guess about not knowing
[00:58:01] what I was doing so I made sure
[00:58:02] everybody was very aware of what I am
[00:58:04] doing at my regular day job now and I
[00:58:06] also have started to because I in that
[00:58:08] common I started to push like kind of
[00:58:10] like when I started when I I was told to
[00:58:12] slow down by everyone and I'm only doing
[00:58:14] like a 50% I'm not even pushing like the
[00:58:16] 100% I was when I was told to slow down
[00:58:18] and people are already at the point that
[00:58:20] oh I didn't get that done I didn't get
[00:58:21] that done I didn't get that done I
[00:58:23] didn't get that done or oh we got a to
[00:58:26] work on that too and you can see people
[00:58:27] get frustrated I'm
[00:58:30] like all right my wife said just keep
[00:58:33] pushing make it like 75% next week and
[00:58:36] see how they do hey Abby how you doing
[00:58:39] thanks coming in and hanging out
[00:58:41] hopefully you're having a good
[00:58:49] morning just doing our little Adventure
[00:58:51] game and currently we have a sale on our
[00:58:54] red buttons check those out
[00:59:01] too yeah see yeah exactly so I'm tired
[00:59:05] with that crap some of the stuff and I
[00:59:06] want to have my own business I have a
[00:59:07] really good idea actually and I have
[00:59:09] some resources so I think we should
[00:59:11] definitely talk we should definitely
[00:59:13] talk cuz some of the resources that I'm
[00:59:15] going to have um because we're going to
[00:59:17] be selling my boat here my my speedboat
[00:59:19] here to put it towards the we have money
[00:59:21] for the other thing but I was debating
[00:59:24] on using some of that money for the
[00:59:26] other resources I was talking about and
[00:59:28] if it works out the way I was thinking
[00:59:30] um it may actually end up being even a
[00:59:32] better thing for everyone involved like
[00:59:35] anybody that's streaming that uh we
[00:59:38] hanging out with and we we like that uh
[00:59:39] we know are good respectful honorable
[00:59:42] people type thing will um will'll bring
[00:59:44] in on board
[00:59:46] type oh yes oh I've been looking for it
[00:59:49] I've been out looking house booed since
[00:59:51] I was uh before I met my wife I told her
[00:59:53] I wanted to move on a boat when I was uh
[00:59:55] when I first met her
[00:59:57] oh it's good to see you doing well Abby
[00:59:59] I said I was going to live on a boat and
[01:00:00] I'm traveling around the world on a boat
[01:00:02] that was my goal in life was to travel
[01:00:04] around the world and she was like oh
[01:00:06] okay and she said she wanted to do it
[01:00:08] well uh she kind of like backed out on
[01:00:10] that a little bit not so much but now
[01:00:11] she's back finally back on board with
[01:00:13] some headache with her work and uh we've
[01:00:15] been looking at a boat to a few of them
[01:00:17] to buy we'll move on to the boat and
[01:00:18] travel around yes and then my other idea
[01:00:22] that I have I we need to talk to you a
[01:00:24] little bit more on but um
[01:00:26] the uh I'll talk to you after on that
[01:00:28] but yeah the uh we'll be traveling
[01:00:30] around the world well currently ref
[01:00:32] first idea is to get at get the boat and
[01:00:33] go back and forth with the Hamas for a
[01:00:35] few months and then be in the Caribbean
[01:00:37] for a few years while we get used to it
[01:00:39] maybe like 3 to 5 years in the Caribbean
[01:00:41] and then travel around the world after
[01:00:43] that but I'd like to get something set
[01:00:45] up with what I'm doing here in the next
[01:00:47] um in the next six months or less is my
[01:00:51] goal to get this thing set up the stream
[01:00:53] possibility idea and some of the things
[01:00:56] you were talking about where we do
[01:00:57] collabs collabs collabs and stuff like
[01:00:59] that that's literally some of the ideas
[01:01:01] and stuff that I was talking about with
[01:01:02] my wife so I think it'll be if with what
[01:01:05] you're thinking about right now and some
[01:01:06] of the stuff you're talking about we
[01:01:08] might actually be able to have a good
[01:01:10] solid plan that might work
[01:01:13] perfectly could work out perfectly as
[01:01:15] long as uh as long as we we kind of are
[01:01:18] all on board on the same idea if that
[01:01:19] makes sense I think we are kind of all
[01:01:21] on board on the same idea just in
[01:01:23] different stages if that makes sense
[01:01:28] remember we do have our red buttons on
[01:01:30] sale if you want to check that and that
[01:01:32] is a flash sale there are 10 red buttons
[01:01:35] for seven doll hairs seven doll hairs
[01:01:38] for 10 red buttons now remember you
[01:01:40] pluck them to give them to them it's
[01:01:42] what I used to use for kids when I was
[01:01:44] in uh the um after school care I be like
[01:01:48] I'll give you $20 and they're like oh
[01:01:49] sweet and then go and do something and
[01:01:51] then you grab a dollar like right one
[01:01:53] like what are you doing I said doll
[01:01:54] hairs I'm giving you dolls I'm like oh a
[01:01:57] Jamie you can't do that and all the kids
[01:02:00] would start getting
[01:02:06] upset yes raising the rising the tide
[01:02:09] that's what I said Rising tide lifts all
[01:02:10] boats how many times have I said that I
[01:02:12] say that all the time a rising tide
[01:02:14] lifts all boats and that's because I've
[01:02:15] been around boats my entire life now the
[01:02:18] other thing too is you can also sink a
[01:02:20] boat if you need
[01:02:27] so that's always an
[01:02:29] option Scuttle
[01:02:31] exactly got to Scuttle it Scuttle it I'm
[01:02:33] sorry let me let me rephrase it you got
[01:02:35] to Scuttle the
[01:02:36] [Laughter]
[01:02:44] boat anyways I think I think I might do
[01:02:50] uh I might open some uh I actually might
[01:02:53] open some of the the um sorcery that we
[01:02:56] have here I think that's what I might do
[01:02:59] here do some sorcery opening but I don't
[01:03:01] know if I want to open the whole box I
[01:03:02] don't think I'll get through the whole
[01:03:03] box so I think what I'll be able to do
[01:03:05] here is I'll be able to have the people
[01:03:07] cut it that I use to cut video and have
[01:03:09] them cut them together and make it into
[01:03:11] one video I think that's what I might do
[01:03:14] cuz if I get caught you know say
[01:03:15] somebody wants to play the adventure
[01:03:16] game or something like
[01:03:19] that you can jump in on that and do
[01:03:22] it I have those those those I'm going do
[01:03:26] a couple of
[01:03:27] combos that's what I'm going to
[01:03:30] do we're going to do a Crea a flash sale
[01:03:33] we're going to call it a
[01:03:36] uh this is what we're going to do I'm
[01:03:37] going to I'm going to make this big so

[01:03:56] going to go a we're going to call it

[01:05:13] good ideas my wife even was like wow
[01:05:15] those are actually good and I talked to
[01:05:16] a person that was a um a business
[01:05:18] strategist because I was debating on
[01:05:20] bring making this a little bit bigger
[01:05:21] and doing it like as a sore and when I
[01:05:23] talked to them and I gave some of the
[01:05:24] ideas that I was talking about like of
[01:05:26] the future of what I wanted to do and
[01:05:27] they're like wow that actually if you
[01:05:29] have what you are doing with the little
[01:05:31] amount that you have and you've grown we
[01:05:33] could probably do a lot with what you're
[01:05:34] thinking about so yeah that's kind of
[01:05:36] what I'm thinking about doing here doing
[01:05:38] some good
[01:05:40] stuff doing some good stuff
[01:05:45] here Ain't No Rest For The Wicked who
[01:05:49] knows our eyes for

[01:06:44] are all uh willing to come and hang out
[01:06:47] with us a little bit
[01:06:49] more it's hard to do on
[01:06:53] that we feel that just that
[01:06:57] the second top one
[01:07:00] daddy that's what I'm talking about by
[01:07:02] the way
[01:07:04] Daddy I have an i what I'm I have an
[01:07:07] idea to have something like that to be
[01:07:10] able to get access to direct access to
[01:07:12] distributor I have uh I have like a
[01:07:14] tertiary access to distributor right now
[01:07:18] um that one those two yes
[01:07:22] okay so I uh that's what I'm talking
[01:07:25] about
[01:07:26] huh
[01:07:39] yeah so that's actually what I'm talking
[01:07:41] about I actually have an idea for
[01:07:44] getting um well I have I have um I
[01:07:47] already talked to a distributor but and
[01:07:49] I need I need a store like you said but
[01:07:52] I actually have a way to get a store
[01:07:53] myself right now I just need to I just
[01:07:56] need to go a little bit more with it and
[01:07:58] see what happens that's actually what
[01:07:59] has going on I have an idea of getting a
[01:08:00] store and having things running but we
[01:08:03] just need to
[01:08:04] um and uh so yes that's part of what I'm
[01:08:07] thinking I have that's some of the stuff
[01:08:09] that I'm talking about I'm going to have
[01:08:12] access to one of those or I am going to
[01:08:14] make one of those is what I'm trying to
[01:08:15] do actually one of them ourselves oh no
[01:08:18] I'm opening a sorcery beta oh no that's
[01:08:22] what I'm talking about I'll have that
[01:08:25] and and then we'll um then we'll be able
[01:08:26] to do some awesome stuff that's kind of
[01:08:29] what I'm talking about that's why I want
[01:08:29] to talk to you guys and others streamers
[01:08:33] because I think with what I my plan is

[01:08:38] that tide together and have a a really
[01:08:41] really sweet off really sweet thing that
[01:08:43] we can do cuz I think one of some of the
[01:08:45] ideas that I have that we can do I think
[01:08:47] we can pull off very well especially
[01:08:49] with having the multitude of streamers
[01:08:51] that we have that want to kind of work
[01:08:53] with us on a regular basis ooh I bumped

[02:05:45] to be a
[02:05:47] bust I actually have never had one of
[02:05:49] those much wasn't much of a bust cuz we
[02:05:52] did have Rick come in we did appreciate
[02:05:53] Rick coming in he was the only one that
[02:05:55] come in I'm just meeing like a bus as it
[02:05:57] we only had one person come in and hang
[02:05:58] out which is weird but you know that's
[02:06:01] okay we're good with that we're all good
[02:06:03] with having one person come in we'll do
[02:06:05] a little fun for a little while and then
[02:06:07] what we'll end up doing here is
[02:06:10] um yeah we'll see I have to jump off and
[02:06:13] do some family
[02:06:15] things so that's probably what I'm going
[02:06:17] to end up doing
[02:06:23] wasn't prepared to have somebody else on
[02:06:25] at the same
[02:06:26] time as me

[02:07:07] anymore I don't even know what to do
[02:07:19] anymore it's all people want to those is

[02:07:23] just have to do a bunch of pull boxes on
[02:07:25] a regular basis for here the other place
[02:07:28] I think I'll have to do the games on

[02:11:26] try I can't even think of that right
[02:11:39] now yeah but we're just doing that right
[02:11:41] now getting ready for a
[02:11:44] show uh uh doing some stuff later put a
[02:11:47] mystery bag with the big blue we're
[02:11:49] going to tid Ren buttons we're gonna do
[02:11:51] some of the red buttons again why not
[02:11:53] we'll throw those out
[02:11:54] there for a few minutes here why not
[02:11:58] we'll throw those out for a few minutes
[02:11:59] and we'll keep running our adventure
[02:12:00] game for those that you want to try it
[02:12:03] but all of our other stuff is running
[02:12:04] there for our our our discounts on it
[02:12:06] all o here we go we'll go with this
[02:12:11] one we'll add that now hold on a
[02:12:16] second recommendations
[02:12:28] seriously what is going on why do I only
[02:12:31] have
[02:12:40] that that's
[02:12:43] crazy that doesn't make any sense oh I
[02:12:46] hate stuff like that
[02:12:52] well let's see what I can make an
[02:12:54] adjustment here we're going to go
[02:13:03] filter there we go I try that let's see
[02:13:07] yeah I mean you guys can jump in on the
[02:13:08] adventure if you'd like we do have a
[02:13:10] good deal on the red buttons right now
[02:13:12] so those ones are pretty nice we'll go
[02:13:15] with that one we'll go with that one
[02:13:21] I think that's all that's going to let
[02:13:23] me
[02:13:26] do yeah it is that's
[02:13:31] crazy you know what that's fine let's
[02:13:34] find something
[02:13:37] else oh we're going to go with some red
[02:13:40] buttons I like
[02:13:42] it oh doing the red buttons Allan now
[02:13:47] where would you like to go with our red
[02:13:49] buttons those are all these right here I
[02:13:51] can do random or we can pick
[02:13:53] specifically for you but Allan has
[02:13:56] decided
[02:14:02] to and 16 all
[02:14:08] right well you did 10 of them okay so
[02:14:12] you that you did so you're going to
[02:14:14] start at
[02:14:15] eight cuz there's 10 red buttons there
[02:14:18] so you actually you're getting 30 right
[02:14:20] now because you bought
[02:14:23] three that's what I was
[02:14:26] saying so you want to you have eight
[02:14:29] you're going to start at 8 cuz 8 13 and
[02:14:31] 16 wouldn't make sense random all right
[02:14:34] so I'm going to start at 8 and going
[02:14:36] take 10 that way I get your ones that
[02:14:38] you wanted and then I take another 10
[02:14:39] and then I'm going to take another 10
[02:14:41] kind of like that I think that's what
[02:14:43] I'll do for
[02:14:44] you one two three
[02:14:48] 4 five six 7 eight
[02:14:53] 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 there we go
[02:15:03] there's your first 10 chunk all right
[02:15:06] put that there and then I'm going to do
[02:15:07] this here another chunk of 10 one two
[02:15:11] three four five six seven 8 nine
[02:15:15] 10 go and then another chunk of 10 from
[02:15:18] right
[02:15:19] here one 2 three 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 there we
[02:15:25] go three chunks let's see what we get

[02:19:40] friend I'm sorry you did not get any big
[02:19:42] hits on that I don't know how that that
[02:19:44] doesn't happen regularly when people go
[02:19:46] in with a Jun chunk of them that's why I
[02:19:47] was like oh my I had to give you
[02:19:49] something a little extra there because I
[02:19:50] don't I didn't like how that happened
[02:19:52] all right here we go here you go
[02:19:56] Allan put that over there for
[02:20:00] you yes it does it does happen it does
[02:20:05] happen I tried I try we've had some
[02:20:07] really good hits out of that like the
[02:20:08] other day somebody told me where to pull
[02:20:11] their their numbers and they pulled out
[02:20:13] three packs of cards I was wow you got
[02:20:15] really lucky there like they just knew
[02:20:17] the numbers to pull for that day and I
[02:20:19] was like you got to go and buy yourself
[02:20:20] a lot take
[02:20:22] it zoom zoom out let me take a drink
[02:20:25] over
[02:20:41] here all
[02:20:43] righty Let's uh have our other stuff we
[02:20:46] had up and running we'll have that run
[02:20:47] for a little bit more there and I might
[02:20:48] actually run one of the other things
[02:20:50] here too because we have the big blue
[02:20:52] book we have also see the big blue book
[02:20:55] and the mystery bags are a better deal
[02:20:58] than than the red button but people like
[02:21:00] the red button because they had the
[02:21:02] chance of getting that big hit there of
[02:21:04] The Collector booster box I think that's
[02:21:06] the reason why and I think what I'm
[02:21:07] going to end up doing is I might end up
[02:21:09] making a uh a box for this for everyone
[02:21:13] here for
[02:21:16] um I might make a box for everyone here
[02:21:18] and do it as a uh
[02:21:21] do some secret layer stuff in it because
[02:21:23] I still have a lot of secret layer left
[02:21:25] I might do a secret layer box oh that'
[02:21:28] be a pull box of secret lar
[02:21:31] stuff that would be pretty
[02:21:34] cool I had that stuff before but not
[02:21:37] everyone went to in on them so I stopped
[02:21:39] doing them this is currently our
[02:21:40] giveaways is those cards that we got up
[02:21:42] right there to say thank you for hanging
[02:21:44] out with
[02:21:45] us and I think I'm going to wait for my
[02:21:47] wife to get back she's supposed to stop
[02:21:50] and get those inks and then when she
[02:21:51] gets back I'll probably figure out what
[02:21:52] I need to do to get over the boat get
[02:21:55] that stuff taken care of so it's not in
[02:21:56] the middle of the heat getting it all
[02:21:58] done
[02:21:59] there I'll run another flash sale and
[02:22:03] this time let's do it
[02:22:05] with let's do a mystery bag and a big
[02:22:08] blue book
[02:22:10] combo mystery bag and a big blue book
[02:22:17] combo that way you get a chance of both
[02:22:20] big
[02:22:22] hits there's still the ceiling in the
[02:22:24] Big Blue Book and the ceiling is still
[02:22:27] there for the uh mystery bags
[02:22:30] also you know still there for all
[02:22:36] those and I think what I'll end up doing
[02:22:39] here is oh we have another mystery bag
[02:22:44] combo oh we're going with the mystery
[02:22:46] bag
[02:22:48] combo there you go
[02:22:53] all

[02:23:04] friend you can uh tell me which other
[02:23:07] you can tell me a number and I count

[02:23:11] mystery boxes the plugs I mean I mean

[03:44:21] Blitz Creek
[03:44:29] B go hey oh let's go I couldn't remember
[03:44:33] the name of this band um the other day
[03:44:35] at work and I could not remember it for
[03:44:36] the life of
[03:44:39] me and I actually said something and I I
[03:44:41] one of my co-workers had to uh
[03:44:46] make a comment to make sure I think she
[03:44:47] was trying to make sure I didn't get in
[03:44:48] trouble because one of the um acronyms
[03:44:51] that was written down was to
[03:44:55] T what's been hit from The Lord of the
[03:44:57] Rings The Lord of the Rings uh is a
[03:44:59] brand new box it's oh oh out of that one
[03:45:02] we haven't had a giant hit the biggest
[03:45:04] hit would have been I think it was one
[03:45:08] poster that we had that might have been
[03:45:10] a nonfoil poster may have been the big
[03:45:12] hit out of that um and I have one of
[03:45:14] them last out of the um Lord of the
[03:45:16] Rings pack up there and I have a brand
[03:45:18] new box over here for those that may
[03:45:21] want to try a brand new
[03:45:26] box but the last one it has not had a
[03:45:29] ring pulled out it has not had any giant
[03:45:32] things pulled out of it that I am aware
[03:45:36] of I'm thinking there was a couple of
[03:45:38] there was two or three um posters pulled
[03:45:41] out but none of them were over like $20
[03:45:44] if that makes
[03:45:50] sense yeah so that's what's there and I
[03:45:52] have a whole new box also for um those
[03:45:55] of you that want to just jump in on a
[03:45:58] new
[03:46:00] box and we can do the adventure whenever
[03:46:03] you guys would like participate in that
[03:46:05] get that rolling I'm just sing and
[03:46:07] protecting all of our stuff for our Budd
[03:46:09] here cuz we want to make sure their
[03:46:10] their good cards are protected for
[03:46:12] shipping I'm not sure on the price up
[03:46:15] all of these but I'm just protecting
[03:46:17] them just anyways just to be sure cuz I
[03:46:19] don't have uh I wish I had that price
[03:46:22] tool that was built in so I could
[03:46:23] somebody could just type in and find the
[03:46:25] price of things that would make
[03:46:26] everything so much easier I have to ask
[03:46:29] the person that's I saw it with
[03:46:30] yesterday be yo how did you get that
[03:46:32] price tool automatically put in because
[03:46:34] it was built into their chat
[03:46:37] somehow and I've seen different things
[03:46:39] built into people's chats before so I'm
[03:46:42] wondering if it's like a an add-on that
[03:46:43] I got to do that's like a um I'm
[03:46:47] wondering if it's a person that's a bot
[03:46:49] that goes into the chat and every time
[03:46:51] it sees something it puts out uh I'm
[03:46:54] guessing it's a chat bot that's really
[03:46:55] what it
[03:47:01] is but I do like I said I have a whole
[03:47:03] new box of Lord of the Rings if you
[03:47:05] didn't want to go with that last pack
[03:47:07] that's
[03:47:08] there and I'll end up just mixing that
[03:47:10] last pack in anyways and then somebody's
[03:47:13] going to end up pulling two two one
[03:47:14] Rings up
[03:47:15] because that pack has it or
[03:47:18] something that's how things like that
[03:47:20] happen with me I don't know why it's
[03:47:22] weird like that I've had every time
[03:47:24] we've had like really awesome hits
[03:47:26] they've almost been the last pack or the
[03:47:28] first pack like I've had monoc crys
[03:47:31] pulled out as the last pack serialized
[03:47:34] CS pulled out and that's like the ones
[03:47:36] that people walk away from he like oh
[03:47:37] that was there was a there's a cavage
[03:47:39] hole pulled out there's nothing going to
[03:47:41] be good pulled out of that and then we
[03:47:42] pulled out a uh a rainbow
[03:47:45] foil monoc Crypt out of the last pack
[03:47:47] for someone's birthday so like that's
[03:47:49] the stuff no sometimes we get good
[03:47:53] luck oh nice
[03:47:56] dude I have a I have a one ring um
[03:48:00] nonfoil poster also and I also have a
[03:48:04] foil of that same one I have actually
[03:48:07] the same one the same stuff too and I
[03:48:09] actually have an original one ring from
[03:48:13] um and a couple of the original one
[03:48:16] rings tooo from the first
[03:48:18] set I actually have a Dwarven soul ring
[03:48:22] too cuz my son William was lucky enough
[03:48:25] to pull that
[03:48:28] out here you are Rick get all your stuff
[03:48:31] together
[03:48:35] here put all your stuff over
[03:48:38] here all together
[03:48:49] and Rick when you're back let me
[03:48:53] know when you're back let me know Rick
[03:48:55] all
[03:49:00] right all righty put that
[03:49:03] there all right that over
[03:49:09] there your pride
[03:49:13] lands the individual cards put them
[03:49:15] together
[03:49:21] here and I'm going to write down Rick's
[03:49:24] name will post it here so that we can
[03:49:27] put your stuff all together and we know
[03:49:29] who's who and we don't mistake anybody
[03:49:31] for anybody's stuff you know you never
[03:49:32] want to mistake anybody's stuff
[03:49:39] right Rick hits you did hit and that
[03:49:42] Pride lands is still there
[03:49:44] showing that off for
[03:49:54] you how does the blue book work all
[03:49:56] right so the blue book is works like
[03:50:00] this there are the pogs left over in
[03:50:03] here with numbers written on them I
[03:50:05] shake those pogs up I pull one out
[03:50:09] whatever number is on the big blue book
[03:50:12] is the number that you get
[03:50:15] I mean number on the POG is the number
[03:50:16] you get from the big glue book so for
[03:50:19] instance each one of these are
[03:50:23] numbered and say you're lucky enough
[03:50:26] where you pull out number 53 you get
[03:50:29] balin's tomb or maybe you get 51 a
[03:50:31] temple Garden or maybe get tishan as
[03:50:33] tide bender and you have a Homeland with
[03:50:36] a LCI draft along with it and that's how
[03:50:39] it goes there with the big blue book you
[03:50:41] get to pull out those things and as you
[03:50:44] pull them out out there that's what you
[03:50:45] get and if you happens to have say like
[03:50:46] I have mystery booster there I'll give
[03:50:48] you something that's an that's an option
[03:50:50] of something
[03:50:52] similar in the Big Blue Book with the
[03:50:54] mystery bags are also it's this big blue
[03:50:57] book here and the mystery bags are these
[03:51:00] which if you look in the frequently
[03:51:01] asked questions the M mystery bags and
[03:51:04] the big blue books are both listed there
[03:51:08] on everything that's in
[03:51:10] them
[03:51:12] um I'll move the big book up a little
[03:51:15] bit so you can see it
[03:51:21] better there's mystery bags and Big Blue
[03:51:23] Book right next to each other there in
[03:51:25] the frequently Asked
[03:51:26] question and it literally tells you
[03:51:28] everything that's in
[03:51:42] it yeah
[03:51:46] big Lo book let me um get the big loop
[03:51:48] book
[03:51:49] here that actually might be the old
[03:51:51] version of
[03:51:57] it let me put the big Lo book out here
[03:52:02] again that's the big glue book sorry I
[03:52:06] have to update that one
[03:52:12] quickly it's actually a better deal on
[03:52:14] the the Big Blue
[03:52:15] Book there you
[03:52:17] go
[03:52:21] there oh my audio changed
[03:52:26] ha you don't see the mystery bag
[03:52:28] contents hold
[03:52:29] on those are in the mystery bags
[03:52:32] currently the justad milk has been
[03:52:35] pulled hardboiled
[03:52:37] Thrillers one of them showcase mkm has
[03:52:41] been pulled
[03:52:44] one of the Prismatic
[03:52:46] nightmares about 15 or so
[03:52:50] LCI five maybe of the mystery
[03:52:53] boosters there's maybe three or four of
[03:52:55] the Homeland there's been two of The
[03:52:57] Collector boosters lost Caverns there's
[03:53:00] been two of The Fallout collector
[03:53:05] boosters pulled and that's
[03:53:08] it you don't see the mystery bag
[03:53:10] contents that's weird you should be able
[03:53:12] to click on the picture in and see what
[03:53:14] the contents
[03:53:17] are um if you click on the mystery bags
[03:53:22] and you click on the picture actually it
[03:53:23] actually shows you everything that's in
[03:53:26] it um and if you click on the mystery
[03:53:29] bags in the um in the shop it actually
[03:53:31] says all that stuff too that I just told
[03:53:34] you um in the
[03:53:36] shop it's just because I combine the two
[03:53:38] of them into um one thing that's why it
[03:53:43] was just a combin comination of a
[03:53:45] mystery bag and the big Lo book together
[03:53:48] which is why they were I just combined
[03:53:49] the two of
[03:53:50] them all right Vias is going to try it
[03:53:54] so vicus going with a big blue book
[03:53:56] we're going to go with a number
[03:53:58] here I'm going to put the mystery back
[03:54:01] packs
[03:54:03] away and if you happen to get a one of
[03:54:05] the the complete floors which is a lost
[03:54:07] Cavern set on the bags you get one of
[03:54:10] those DC things
[03:54:11] there all right let's see
[03:54:15] here you've got an iguana and on the
[03:54:17] back you have number
[03:54:19] 20 number 20 so let's see yeah no
[03:54:24] problem I'm sorry bud I'm sorry it
[03:54:26] wasn't right right there I tried to it
[03:54:28] was just because when we do like the
[03:54:29] combo I don't always get the combo thing
[03:54:31] right on there but now with your mystery
[03:54:35] bag let me know what you want to pull
[03:54:38] out of those I can do a number for you I
[03:54:40] just kind of count a certain way that's
[03:54:42] how I do and we have number 20
[03:54:46] number 20
[03:54:49] is you got a oh there you go lost C
[03:54:52] Exelon collector booster look at
[03:54:57] that nice hit with your in the darkness
[03:55:00] binds
[03:55:01] them that's some pretty decent luck I'd
[03:55:06] say for uh for that right
[03:55:11] there yes good luck that is good luck
[03:55:14] and then where would you like to go on
[03:55:15] the mystery
[03:55:24] bags do that put that over here then
[03:55:27] grab one of those from here there you
[03:55:33] go green one in the middle this
[03:55:41] one says Green in the middle so
[03:55:46] yes the POG should be in there's no more
[03:55:50] 20 POG in there that is correct so
[03:55:52] there's 20 POG has been pulled out so
[03:55:54] now there's only the numbers that are
[03:55:56] left in there
[03:55:57] there's hold on I'll count how many are
[03:55:59] left I mean you can see how many are in
[03:56:02] here there's like 40 of 20 or 30 of them
[03:56:05] in here I
[03:56:06] think I think there's about 30 of them
[03:56:08] in
[03:56:09] here so that's what's left in there for
[03:56:12] those
[03:56:14] all right so there's no 20 left correct
[03:56:17] and now you have gotten yourself a
[03:56:21] mystery
[03:56:23] booster with the other one nice now
[03:56:26] because that was not a complete floor
[03:56:29] but it wasn't one of the ones where you

[03:56:32] our Gold packs here which is just a

[04:19:38] two all right I like it do
[04:19:39] two all right so these are going to stay
[04:19:42] for the end of the Stream
[04:19:43] okay right there I already said that
[04:19:47] we're going to pull this one out I think
[04:19:49] you guys have been having a good time
[04:19:50] with us and I'm going to run this as our
[04:19:53] giveaway right now and we're going to

[04:20:13] the stream little thank you for hanging
[04:20:15] out with us
[04:20:19] stuff and what I'll do next here is let
[04:20:23] me
[04:20:28] see I actually have to go through a
[04:20:30] chunk of things here to ship stuff that
[04:20:33] have
[04:20:34] been returned so a package got shipped
[04:20:37] back to me I can't show you the person's
[04:20:38] name but they're like hey we're sorry we
[04:20:40] ruined your package the the card was
[04:20:43] okay but yeah this is why like I feel
[04:20:47] bad about I don't like sh shaping them
[04:20:49] in plain white envelopes and I only do
[04:20:50] it when I do giveaways on certain places
[04:20:53] that I do the plain white
[04:20:55] envelopes and that is literally the
[04:20:56] reason why right there because it's only
[04:20:59] giveaways that I re I I'll do those on I
[04:21:02] know it's only the giveaways that I do
[04:21:04] them on it's on like a certain site so
[04:21:06] it's not like I do them here cuz when I
[04:21:08] do the giveaways here they're like packs
[04:21:10] so I can't do them like that so they
[04:21:11] always go in a um they always go in some
[04:21:14] some good sleeves things here like a
[04:21:15] good package I got like you know you
[04:21:17] guys see how I package stuff up Aztec
[04:21:20] King how you doing thanks for coming

[04:21:30] something in the mail the other day too
[04:21:32] and it wasn't me like not from me from
[04:21:34] me and I feel so bad and like I said
[04:21:37] like you know next time you come in like
[04:21:38] I like I I like I threw him an EXT I'll
[04:21:40] throw him something extra but I I can't
[04:21:42] give him everything back cuz I don't I
[04:21:44] don't have everything and that's the
[04:21:46] thing that sucks and like I've had one
[04:21:48] person even sent me a picture oh that
[04:21:57] stinks that sucks a lot that sucks a lot
[04:22:01] I'm sorry about that buddy you know the
[04:22:04] other thing too is I've had the way I
[04:22:06] package myself um I had somebody send me
[04:22:09] a picture going just here you're aware
[04:22:10] this is what happened to the package I'm
[04:22:12] like what
[04:22:13] and I'm like okay and then he sends me a
[04:22:14] picture looks like the package was run
[04:22:16] over by like two trucks he goes this is
[04:22:18] the only car that had a problem with it
[04:22:20] and there was one card that was like a
[04:22:21] $3 card that had a dent in it the rest
[04:22:24] of the cards perfect nothing wrong with
[04:22:26] them and I'm like well I guess it's a
[04:22:29] good thing you got the package from me
[04:22:30] and not somebody else cuz if it was ran
[04:22:31] over by another person I'm batting you
[04:22:33] wouldn't have gotten any
[04:22:38] cards cuz I do I like the way you guys
[04:22:41] know I kind of overpack my stuff a
[04:22:44] little bit here with the uh between the
[04:22:45] um cardboard for hardness and the uh

[04:23:21] a
[04:23:23] lot see there's some shady people and
[04:23:25] that's the thing that pisses me off
[04:23:27] because they give everybody else that's
[04:23:28] being honest and doing good things a bad
[04:23:31] name like I've never done anything if
[04:23:34] anything when somebody come like you saw
[04:23:36] earlier somebody comes out with

[04:23:44] $70 H
[04:23:49] goodbye no sorry thank you thank you I
[04:23:53] don't know why that just changed there
[04:23:54] audio changed all I was saying was that
[04:23:57] for some reason uh that's those those
[04:23:59] are the bad people that ruin it for
[04:24:00] everyone else you know they're going to
[04:24:02] ruin it for the good people that want to
[04:24:03] have fun and do the good things like
[04:24:05] like me or some of the other people that
[04:24:07] are over here on drip that we're we do
[04:24:09] some stuff honestly we give you we give
[04:24:11] you as much information so it's as
[04:24:13] transparent as possible on everything we
[04:24:16] do and then you have others that do
[04:24:19] stuff like that and ruin it for the rest
[04:24:22] of us and I and it's just like dude you
[04:24:24] don't even realize you're screwing
[04:24:26] yourself and everyone else in the
[04:24:29] process it's just it just sucks which is
[04:24:32] actually part of the reason why I I like
[04:24:33] here a lot cuz they do take care of
[04:24:36] people right away make sure things are
[04:24:38] done on a rate generally they do they do
[04:24:40] pretty good with that
[04:24:48] am I not
[04:24:51] live did I just come off of
[04:24:56] whatnot did you send me on whatnot
[04:24:58] instead that's crazy somebody said they
[04:25:00] were on
[04:25:02] whatnot it's
[04:25:06] spinning that's what happened there I
[04:25:08] can't believe that happened on that site

[04:37:57] mhm my kids love it actually too my kids
[04:38:01] love sushi they eat it all the
[04:38:04] time like they ask for it on a regular
[04:38:07] basis too this is a funny thing can we
[04:38:08] have sushi tonight can we have sushi
[04:38:10] tonight it's always out there asking for
[04:38:12] can we have sushi tonight I'm like not
[04:38:14] tonight guys not tonight it's
[04:38:17] expensive but what we're going to end up
[04:38:20] doing though is uh when we go on our
[04:38:21] boat we'll have rice and we'll be
[04:38:23] fishing all the time because I mean we
[04:38:25] are on a boat might as well be fishing
[04:38:27] and then we can make our own sushi on a
[04:38:28] regular basis I
[04:38:30] figured exactly dude definitely very
[04:38:32] good clean protein 100% good clean
[04:38:35] protein I eat it I mean that's one of
[04:38:37] those things that um when I wrestled
[04:38:39] when I was in high school um I actually
[04:38:41] used to eat sushi a lot um for my meals
[04:38:45] when I would go out to eat somewhere and
[04:38:47] kids would be like dude what are you
[04:38:48] doing and I get like I would get a lot
[04:38:49] of sushi and they would get a salad and
[04:38:52] they like dude I just got like four
[04:38:54] sushi rolls I have like a roll here a
[04:38:57] roll here and roll here and they're all
[04:38:59] like I need to eat a salad to stay on
[04:39:00] weight I'm like no you don't you need to
[04:39:01] eat Smart you need to eat healthy you
[04:39:03] don't need to eat a salad cuz you're
[04:39:05] starving yourself you need to eat
[04:39:07] correct and that's a problem with a lot
[04:39:09] of the people that the younger ones that
[04:39:10] they weren't pay attention they weren't
[04:39:12] learning nutrition when they were doing
[04:39:14] the wrestling stuff and they were just
[04:39:15] trying to I'm going to cut weight by not
[04:39:17] eating no no that doesn't do that
[04:39:18] doesn't do it so I would actually have a
[04:39:21] ton of sushi and they'd be like dude how
[04:39:23] are you under weight by three pounds I'm
[04:39:25] like cuz I'm eating correctly my body
[04:39:28] needs protein so that it can be healthy
[04:39:31] and my muscle stay strong what's going
[04:39:33] on is you're not eating healthy you're
[04:39:35] not putting protein into your body so
[04:39:37] your bodies are going your muscles are
[04:39:39] going in an atrophy and your body is now
[04:39:40] not allowing anything to leave your
[04:39:42] system which is why you don't lose
[04:39:44] weight and you have a hard time and they
[04:39:47] like over their head continuously they
[04:39:49] just didn't it didn't didn't matter to
[04:39:51] them but it is delicious definitely one
[04:39:54] of my favorites is head and sushi

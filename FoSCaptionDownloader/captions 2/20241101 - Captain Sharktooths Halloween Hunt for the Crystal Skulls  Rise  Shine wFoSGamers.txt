[00:30:20] much for it
[00:30:22] um $20 for the whole

[01:02:34] buddy not uh we have on on this box
[01:02:39] we've opened two in the last
[01:02:42] box I don't think we got one out of this
[01:02:44] one I
[01:02:45] think there's two in the last one we
[01:02:47] haven't got one out of this one yet I
[01:02:49] don't think which is weird so but
[01:02:52] there's two in the last one which makes
[01:02:53] me worried you know what I mean
[01:02:56] whenever I get two in one I get worried
[01:02:57] about having them in the
[01:02:59] other that just is why like oh no we got
[01:03:03] two that means one of is going to have
[01:03:06] none which I'm guessing is one of which
[01:03:09] was not the one that I got so I opened
[01:03:11] one for the store and that one had one
[01:03:13] so I don't know we're going to find
[01:03:17] out oh we got two foils in one box yeah
[01:03:27] um last stream and the stream before
[01:03:29] because we didn't get them we had two
[01:03:30] different breaks and two different
[01:03:31] breaks had um somebody got a break and
[01:03:34] then somebody bought a pack out of the
[01:03:36] same box and and during that break they
[01:03:38] got the uh um foil from
[01:03:43] it so I do not believe we've had any
[01:03:46] from here though we had two in the last
[01:03:48] one I got to remember what the name what
[01:03:49] the names of the last ones were I
[01:03:51] already got them backed off the ship I

[01:37:55] our friend here rip
[01:37:58] Rhino what is your uh number between one
[01:38:03] and 10 for me if you don't mind that way
[01:38:07] I know what we're doing for our
[01:38:10] giveaway rip could you do it number
[01:38:13] eight all right let's see if you end up
[01:38:15] with that uh that one that we have in
[01:38:18] there or the uh the I mean the um nice
[01:38:21] sorcery one that we got in there for
[01:38:22] their special CA
[01:38:24] I do believe one of the rares may be in
[01:38:25] there if not we can uh we can adjust
[01:38:27] that anyways but there you go Sho
[01:38:30] there's that The Brak up right here what
[01:38:32] we're going to put together over here
[01:38:34] with everything else I just am not going
[01:38:36] to um put all the brake things in right
[01:38:39] now the uncommons we'll do that a little
[01:38:42] bit
[01:38:43] later at the end of the
[01:38:46] stream all righty we're going to put all
[01:38:49] of it right here though right
[01:38:50] now in the Box
[01:38:53] behind me that holds all everybody's
[01:38:56] stuff what happens if we buy in a break
[01:38:59] but have to leave a stream before a
[01:39:00] break well the brake currently go grow
[01:39:03] these are I'm not doing these as brakes
[01:39:04] these are um these right now I am doing
[01:39:07] as virtual pull boxes I'm using that not
[01:39:09] really breaks if that makes any
[01:39:14] sense all
[01:39:16] right um I thought I
[01:39:19] hit oh there did say completed okay so
[01:39:22] I'm not I'm not using really as that I'm
[01:39:24] using them a little bit differently
[01:39:26] here so right now so for instance uh it
[01:39:29] does it allows you to allows me to
[01:39:30] randomize what I'm doing here so
[01:39:33] Bob the
[01:39:35] con got that and then you rip we're
[01:39:39] going to give me that number you said
[01:39:40] eight then Bob Theon got another one he
[01:39:42] went with let me just check that out
[01:39:45] there for a second but I got to get the
[01:39:46] uh number eight here one two three four
[01:39:49] five six seven eight nine
[01:39:54] [Music]
[01:39:56] go
[01:39:58] 10 and you said number
[01:40:02] eight one two three four five six seven
[01:40:06] eight there you
[01:40:07] go you've got ice rot
[01:40:11] Sentry rip
[01:40:15] Rhino I can tell you one second give me
[01:40:17] one one second I just want to make sure
[01:40:18] I write this down what is a virtual pull
[01:40:20] box all right so like a pull box is
[01:40:21] where somebody where for instance
[01:40:23] there's cards in there that have a
[01:40:25] certain value and for instance and you
[01:40:27] look at the pull box the virtual one I
[01:40:29] have here set up for the $3 one that Bob
[01:40:32] had jumped in on the floor on it you
[01:40:35] could potentially have of the singles in
[01:40:37] there is like the rares but there would
[01:40:38] be 5 cents of L but average is around
[01:40:42] $332 where the ceiling of it is $48 if
[01:40:45] you get one of the um if you get the
[01:40:48] collector booster that is the modern
[01:40:50] Horizon 3 collector booster then if you
[01:40:52] happen to get uh also one of the ones
[01:40:55] that has a single will have something
[01:40:56] that says one of the crystal skulls
[01:40:57] colors next to it and if you happen to
[01:40:59] get that one you'll get a discount code
[01:41:01] from me and we'll send one over to you
[01:41:03] uh I'll send you a message with one
[01:41:05] that's how that works so for instance we
[01:41:08] have um Bob just picked up that where he
[01:41:12] got a card that was
[01:41:13] worth it says exactly what the for name
[01:41:16] of the card is and what the price of it
[01:41:17] is too with it so you can even literally
[01:41:20] see if you go to look at the breakes
[01:41:21] there should be a tab that says breaks
[01:41:23] you'll actually see everything that says
[01:41:25] what it is and the name of the actual
[01:41:27] card too which is kind of nice you got
[01:41:31] that a nice Forest

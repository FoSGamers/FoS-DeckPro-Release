See if there's certain words like that, and please let me know what they are, and if they are related to any of the titles that have recently been out for FoSGamers on YouTube.

YouTube's algorithm can indeed negatively affect a video's visibility based on certain factors, including the specific words used in video titles, descriptions, and tags. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Sensitive Content**: Words related to sensitive topics such as violence, adult content, or controversial issues can lead to reduced visibility or even demonetization. YouTube's algorithm actively deprioritizes content that could be considered inappropriate for a broad audience, even if it doesn’t outright violate their policies.

2. **Clickbait and Misleading Titles**: Titles that are misleading or too clickbaity can result in penalties. If a video is flagged for not delivering on its title's promise, the algorithm may reduce its reach, as YouTube prioritizes audience satisfaction【11†source】.

3. **Excessive Profanity**: While minor profanity might be overlooked, excessive or strong language in titles or descriptions can lead to reduced promotion or demonetization. YouTube prefers content that is advertiser-friendly, so it’s best to avoid strong language【9†source】.

4. **Political and Controversial Keywords**: Content involving politically sensitive or controversial keywords might be scrutinized more heavily by the algorithm. Such videos may not be recommended as often, and their reach can be limited, particularly if they are perceived to be divisive【8†source】【11†source】.

5. **Irrelevant or Misleading Tags**: Using tags that don’t accurately reflect the content can hurt a video's performance. This tactic is often associated with clickbait and can lead to reduced visibility【10†source】.

Regarding FoSGamers on YouTube, it would be helpful to review the recent video titles and descriptions to ensure they avoid these pitfalls. Focus on creating titles that are clear, accurate, and engaging without relying on misleading or controversial language.

In summary, avoid sensitive or misleading language in titles, be careful with profanity, and ensure that all keywords and tags are relevant to the video content to optimize your visibility on YouTube.

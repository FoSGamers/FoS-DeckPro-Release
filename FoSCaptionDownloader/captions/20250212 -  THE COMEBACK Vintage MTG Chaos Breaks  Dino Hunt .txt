[00:02:57] see all you guys I uh been it's been a
[00:03:00] little busy we had to do a long sale we
[00:03:03] were actually overnight for uh what four
[00:03:05] nights was it overnight or was it three
[00:03:07] nights four nights we had to do pretty
[00:03:09] much so 24h hour we did a few 24 three
[00:03:12] 24 hours in a 33 hour sale 36 hour
[00:03:15] sale um sing at a couple places but we
[00:03:18] had a couple issues you some we got bad
[00:03:20] fuel so we took a little bit here so
[00:03:22] that's part of the reason why we were
[00:03:24] having issues but we were in um like we
[00:03:26] had a great time in a couple of places
[00:03:28] we're going to definitely have to stop
[00:03:29] back to uh to um Cay uh not C the the
[00:03:33] the Turk and cosos gr Turk was really
[00:03:35] nice we just only had a chance to Pump
[00:03:37] Fuel out so we can get good fuel to get
[00:03:39] the rest of the way here you
[00:03:41] know but uh hope you guys are having
[00:03:43] some fun we got a break today as you can
[00:03:46] see they are all going to be there's
[00:03:48] going to be one vintage fifth edition
[00:03:49] pack and then the rest of them are going
[00:03:51] to be uh Los C draft that's uh kind of
[00:03:54] going on of style now figured to have
[00:03:56] some uh some of that in there if you
[00:03:58] guys want it hoping uh we're heading
[00:04:01] back I'm looking into buying a solar
[00:04:03] thing and a solar Arch here installing
[00:04:05] myself because no one's been really
[00:04:07] responding I know how to do it having
[00:04:09] done stuff for years like that it's just
[00:04:12] I don't have the ability to fabricate
[00:04:13] the uh Arch if that was made but nicely
[00:04:16] there's a a guy that we met here where
[00:04:19] we are in the Bahamas that uh gave me
[00:04:21] some information about a person that
[00:04:22] does the engineering and then sets it
[00:04:24] all up but just pretty much chips to you
[00:04:25] in a crate so I can put it together I'm
[00:04:27] like o I think I might be doing that
[00:04:29] that way know what's wrong and I know
[00:04:30] exactly what's going to happen every
[00:04:32] time I anything goes wrong I know what
[00:04:33] it is I think that's a better idea for
[00:04:35] me so I know what do you guys think
[00:04:37] about that we're hanging out here no
[00:04:39] let's check if we can find anything on
[00:04:44] uh here let's see how this is
[00:04:49] looking now my battery is not fully
[00:04:51] charged here so we only going to be
[00:04:52] around for about half hour to an hour at
[00:04:55] the most we won't really be doing too
[00:04:57] much because I can't be on for forever
[00:05:01] you know can't be on forever but I can't
[00:05:04] hang out with you guys for a bit so what
[00:05:06] I'm going to do is why is this not
[00:05:10] showing
[00:05:11] mine me
[00:05:14] playing there we go that was so
[00:05:19] weird but thsy where are you we are in
[00:05:22] the uh yeah we're in the Bahamas we're
[00:05:26] uh heading out though we're going to
[00:05:28] head back to the us though we got to go
[00:05:29] and pick some stuff up our dog and all
[00:05:31] that stuff fun thing so that's where
[00:05:33] we're what we're doing right now
[00:05:34] switching be between uh YouTube and and
[00:05:36] whatnot here trying to figure out what
[00:05:38] people talking to me so yeah I think
[00:05:41] though what I'll do is we'll open up uh
[00:05:45] we'll do one of our packs that we got
[00:05:46] here and see if we got any luck now I
[00:05:48] forgot the scissors over there should I
[00:05:50] open it up out yeah you know what maybe
[00:05:53] we'll do I don't know if I can do it
[00:05:54] like this uh I going have to sneak
[00:05:56] inside and do it that way we can uh
[00:06:00] huh no I'm thinking about how to open
[00:06:02] the pack I'm going to have to go inside
[00:06:03] and do it cuz I can't worry about the
[00:06:04] wind blowing anything away so which one
[00:06:06] do we think we should open here so far
[00:06:08] guys we have a couple of them not this
[00:06:10] which one should we open maybe we'll
[00:06:12] have one of the boys do it if they want
[00:06:13] to read the cards and we'll see but I
[00:06:14] think you guys have the choice right now
[00:06:17] what should we open today starting with
[00:06:20] and see what the family gets and a lot
[00:06:21] of times when people jump into the
[00:06:22] brakes you guys get our our bulk from
[00:06:24] stuff because I don't I can't keep all
[00:06:25] cards on a boat not enough room so you
[00:06:28] guys get some of that extra free so jump
[00:06:30] in on that break if you'd like
[00:06:34] to not a bad one there's still six
[00:06:36] remaining and we're going to do our we
[00:06:38] have our adventure and we could do a
[00:06:39] little bit after if we have enough time
[00:06:41] so hopefully do hey monster how's it

[00:20:00] like a Time kidss come on and say if
[00:20:01] they're doing something like yesterday
[00:20:02] my oldest learned to sail on a little
[00:20:05] dinghy Sailing Boat a little bit with uh
[00:20:07] one of the neighbors boats a very
[00:20:09] friendly people around here it's very
[00:20:11] nice to be it's a change in um the
[00:20:14] perspective of the world a bit when
[00:20:16] you see people that are friendly want to
[00:20:20] be helpful kind of like I've always
[00:20:21] offered help offered assistance whenever
[00:20:23] I can like I say you can't always can't
[00:20:25] always give or help but when you can you
[00:20:26] should it's not necessar going to Hur if
[00:20:29] it's not going to affect you majorly or
[00:20:30] it's not going to be a big horrible
[00:20:31] problem that's all you need to worry
[00:20:34] about if it going to affect you don't
[00:20:36] care if it's not going to affect you you
[00:20:38] don't need to care so just take a bit of
[00:20:41] time help and that's some of the nice
[00:20:44] things that we handle all the
[00:20:48] time I think mom is trying to listen to
[00:20:50] us some stuff how what's going
[00:20:53] on there was uh it was interesting
[00:20:56] though because we were down here we were
[00:20:58] here here in the Bahamas we've been here
[00:20:59] for like 2
[00:21:02] days and we ended up having to um we
[00:21:06] noticed there was a tsunami warning
[00:21:08] where we came from that was kind of
[00:21:10] crazy there's a uh there was a
[00:21:13] uh oh somebody's going by in a boat I
[00:21:15] got this is ADHD right now on
[00:21:19] point there a guy going by in his boat
[00:21:22] sailing past us and I was just checking
[00:21:24] it
[00:21:25] out they get a they get a really regular
[00:21:27] sailboat not a Cameran so a monol what
[00:21:29] you picture as a regular
[00:21:32] Sabo all
[00:21:43] right all righty but I think we'll uh it
[00:21:47] doesn't seem like the Dino Hunt here or
[00:21:48] the Vintage break will be working today
[00:21:50] so I think what I'm going to do is I'm
[00:21:52] going to go over there

[00:22:14] that out loud cuz that's that's going to
[00:22:16] get someone in
[00:22:17] [Laughter]
[00:22:20] trouble
[00:22:24] guaranteed luckily I wasn't in the area
[00:22:26] for that tsunami warning that was in the
[00:22:28] Cayman Islands uh off the Cayman Island
[00:22:30] so we weren't in that direction where it
[00:22:32] was going to hit it was only hit Puerto

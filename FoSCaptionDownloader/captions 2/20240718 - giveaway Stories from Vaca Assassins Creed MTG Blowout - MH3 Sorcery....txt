[00:17:27] whole point was we'll use some of these
[00:17:28] things do that
[00:17:29] with now I want to see what the lands
[00:17:32] are because I actually really do like
[00:17:33] these lands and that's why mainly the
[00:17:35] reason why I open this I'd like to see
[00:17:37] if they gave like a gift bundle but
[00:17:38] anybody want any of these things I know
[00:17:40] my kids don't use them and I don't but
[00:17:42] maybe if I get you guys get a giveaway
[00:17:43] or something um I'll throw them in there
[00:17:44] if one of you happen to want
[00:17:46] them get rid of that though so it's on
[00:17:48] my way I can use this now as a new
[00:17:51] container oh look at that I got a new
[00:17:53] one works
[00:17:55] perfectly all righty
[00:18:00] oh I keep all the d20s unless I have
[00:18:03] duplicates and if I have duplicate I
[00:18:04] sometimes do give them away actually so
[00:18:06] if I happen I open another one for some
[00:18:08] reason another uh bundle for myself uh
[00:18:12] maybe I want some more lands I don't
[00:18:13] know what it's GNA be I may end up doing
[00:18:15] that for
[00:18:16] you now that was a good deal no one
[00:18:19] wanted to jump in to be to with Magic
[00:18:22] Mountain for for 10 oh all right all
[00:18:25] righty well I'm going to start out then
[00:18:27] this we're going to look at
[00:18:31] the lands in the car that we come with
[00:18:32] in the pack here all right first our
[00:18:35] plain
[00:18:36] lands well not our plane lands our full
[00:18:38] art lands but they are they are um not
[00:18:41] foil not foil I do like them though big
[00:18:45] fan of them I think that's what the
[00:18:46] thing is the art on the land is what I

[01:06:21] go continue on to like the next place a
[01:06:23] little jealous hey you know KW work I've
[01:06:26] um my my goal through a long time in my
[01:06:28] life I since I met my wife I told her
[01:06:30] she never always thought it was kind of
[01:06:31] like crazy but she I tell her all the
[01:06:33] time and I told her all the time since I
[01:06:34] met her I want to live on a boat and
[01:06:36] travel around the world I want to teach
[01:06:38] my kids that way I was a teacher when I
[01:06:39] first got out of college because they're
[01:06:41] going to learn a lot better they're
[01:06:42] going remember things a lot more they're
[01:06:43] goingon to be a lot smarter um and the
[01:06:47] the way the world the country currently
[01:06:48] teaches children it's to the lowest
[01:06:50] common denominator instead of to the
[01:06:52] highest um and that frustrates me a
[01:06:54] little bit um having been taught in two
[01:06:57] different states up in New
[01:06:59] England uh there could be you're driving
[01:07:02] by there's some burnt out buildings
[01:07:04] that's what I was saying there's still a
[01:07:05] as you're going you're going over some
[01:07:06] rocks you get up to the top of the
[01:07:07] mountain once you finally at the top of
[01:07:09] the mountain which is actually where the
[01:07:10] picture has taken there on on uh on the
[01:07:12] intro there that's where the picture is
[01:07:14] taken at top of image in you're at the
[01:07:15] top of there you see there's a few
[01:07:17] porter potties and a
[01:07:23] small where is it
[01:07:26] General Store look at that there's a
[01:07:28] general store up
[01:07:30] there you want to investigate any of the
[01:07:32] couple burnt like there's one or two
[01:07:34] burnt out buildings not too not too much
[01:07:36] as you can tell there's only a couple of
[01:07:38] them not too much there do you want to
[01:07:39] investigate any of those or do you just
[01:07:40] want to continue on to the top where you
[01:07:42] at and see uh what's going on in that
[01:07:44] General
[01:07:46] Store yeah but that's what we're doing J
[01:07:48] carworks I uh I told my wife was going
[01:07:51] to do that she's uh we did a we did a
[01:07:53] trip a while about a year ago on a boat
[01:07:55] where she actually like wow this is
[01:07:57] actually not so bad to be on here I'm
[01:07:58] like yeah you wanted she's always want
[01:08:00] she's been trying to get me for probably
[01:08:01] years now to do like a like the tiny
[01:08:03] home where you travel around on a
[01:08:04] trailer in the US to different places
[01:08:07] and I don't want to do that I told her
[01:08:09] I'll do some of that but I that's not my
[01:08:10] goal so she she kind of once we did that
[01:08:12] on the boat she like you know what I can
[01:08:13] do this instead this is fun and uh you
[01:08:17] know we have starlink and I can work
[01:08:18] anywhere be IP all right you want to
[01:08:21] investigate some of those burn out
[01:08:22] buildings I like it so you wander into
[01:08:24] one of those burn out buildings you want
[01:08:25] inv get a little bit forward
[01:08:27] further and oh no the first building you
[01:08:31] go

[01:08:42] your friend you have an
[01:08:48] idea
[01:08:50] um no I don't think we're going to be
[01:08:52] able to do that I don't think we can do
[01:08:54] that because I have to keep things
[01:08:56] exactly the same for every person that
[01:08:59] plays um like the options are always the
[01:09:01] same because if I change things up uh
[01:09:03] what not yells at you and we'll suspend
[01:09:05] you so I have to make sure it's always
[01:09:07] exactly the same with the same rules
[01:09:08] always I can't change it I I you know
[01:09:11] that's
[01:09:11] why yes I will
[01:09:15] be so if you the uh the D and D stuff if

[01:21:17] continue we can check to make sure our
[01:21:19] characters aren't infected I like that
[01:21:21] oh I never even thought of that as being
[01:21:23] a problem so
[01:21:26] you and your buddies you and your buddy
[01:21:27] going looking at each other all right
[01:21:30] hey you want to check me out I want to
[01:21:32] take my shirt off I know he scratched me
[01:21:34] we need to make sure we're not infected
[01:21:36] I don't want to become a
[01:21:39] ghoul he swiped down and knocked over
[01:21:41] and you got that scratch so you you you
[01:21:44] uh you go all right that's all right man
[01:21:47] you started eating your food where is

[01:22:09] no uh no bite marks on me but uh there's
[01:22:13] a little bit of scratch he says probably
[01:22:15] a good idea to get that one uh taken

[01:22:18] infected should we use one of our Med
[01:22:22] packs now this is one of our things that

[03:07:30] there's not a lot of people that there's
[03:07:31] a few that live there and everything
[03:07:32] like that um and they just don't do
[03:07:35] anything but look around and pay

[03:12:40] regular doctor I normally see a a
[03:12:43] physician's assistant um does most off
[03:12:46] everything I need but he has a primary
[03:12:48] doctor I need to see the primary doctor
[03:12:49] so I could get some medications I need
[03:12:51] refilled um and he needs me to go see me
[03:12:53] because he's a new primary doctor for
[03:12:55] them because it changed around and stuff
[03:12:57] and he's out sick now he had to leave
[03:12:59] today and I'm like well I'm out of like
[03:13:01] two medications can I can I get them I
[03:13:04] was supposed to be getting them refilled
[03:13:05] today I'm actually out of them which is
[03:13:06] causing other problems because I'm not
[03:13:07] sleeping and um my other medicine for
[03:13:10] you know Aderall I take for helping for
[03:13:12] focusing because I've had ad issues um I

[03:13:18] little bit why I've been scattered too
[03:13:20] I've been off for a few days I haven't
[03:13:21] had it for a few days so I'm a little
[03:13:23] scattered around it's a little
[03:13:26] frustrating no I didn't get hit in
[03:13:27] Florida I was on vacation and I got hit
[03:13:30] in tellu ride in Colorado it
[03:13:33] was
[03:13:38] sorry yeah I got I got nearly killed by
[03:13:41] five times yeah uh reminds me of the New
[03:13:43] York they have crosswalks Bas bricks

[03:14:15] vacation in tell Colorado when that
[03:14:18] happened yeah and I can tell you my
[03:14:20] worst injury if you
[03:14:22] want I don't even think it was
[03:14:24] necessarily my worst injury is probably
[03:14:25] the worst thing I ever did that got
[03:14:27] injured is really what it was like one
[03:14:28] of the stupid situations because I um I
[03:14:32] I I I I say I do calculated danger is
[03:14:35] what I like to do and that's why I get
[03:14:36] injured not killed um sounds stupid but
[03:14:42] yeah this is not a Nebraska hat this is
[03:14:44] a uh this is a hat from Colorado this is
[03:14:47] my this is my um what do you call it

[03:15:29] go number three so yes I
[03:15:32] uh had some Road rush so great luck
[03:15:35] there my worst injury I'd have to say
[03:15:37] though probably was
[03:15:40] um probably was uh it wasn't even an
[03:15:43] injury as much as the worst scenario
[03:15:45] because the calculated danger I ended up
[03:15:46] doing something was stupid and I
[03:15:47] probably shouldn't have gone out by
[03:15:48] myself and done it with the new bike I
[03:15:50] got a new um mountain bike that was um
[03:15:53] that had was rear and front suspension
[03:15:56] but it was an electric one it had a
[03:15:58] little overpowered uh and I made got it
[03:16:01] so I could go through the woods and like
[03:16:02] if I wanted to hunt I could pull a deer
[03:16:03] back and stuff like that um but the bike
[03:16:08] uh is really powerful and when I was
[03:16:09] going up and down one of the mountains I
[03:16:11] went down and I hit a rock wrong and I
[03:16:15] because I changed the throttle to be the
[03:16:17] one that I could twist instead of a
[03:16:19] thumb throttle on it I pumped the
[03:16:22] throttle and it threw me off of the uh
[03:16:25] off of it this is one of those things
[03:16:27] like I said I wasn't used to the bike I
[03:16:28] need to shut it down now when I'm going
[03:16:30] down Mountain um and it threw me off the
[03:16:32] bike head over head over heel Rick head
[03:16:34] over the handlebars I knocked myself
[03:16:36] unconscious for uh know three to four
[03:16:38] hours it was bright sunlight out and
[03:16:41] during the day when I was mountain
[03:16:43] biking and then I woke up and it was
[03:16:44] dark out um that was probably my worst
[03:16:47] injury it wasn't really bad that I got a
[03:16:49] bad injury but I was out cold for like a
[03:16:51] solid like three or four
[03:16:55] hours so yeah that that was my worst one
[03:16:57] but hey let's get you some good luck Ace

[03:19:09] ah that was definitely a good pack there
[03:19:11] I like that pack yeah so I've had some
[03:19:13] um some stupid injuries that was
[03:19:15] probably my worst one because it was
[03:19:17] more of a stupid thing and I was in a
[03:19:18] bad situation and no one was around and
[03:19:21] knew where I was because I took the
[03:19:22] mountain bike out by myself it was like
[03:19:23] a day off and I was like you know what
[03:19:24] I'm gonna take this out go for a ride
[03:19:26] try it out a little bit and yeah that
[03:19:28] was a bad choice I didn't tell anybody
[03:19:29] what I was doing so I could have been
[03:19:31] lost in the middle of the woods where
[03:19:32] who knows how long and died so that was
[03:19:35] why I uh I now make sure like when I do
[03:19:37] anything like that I make sure I people
[03:19:38] know where I'm going uh I even have my
[03:19:41] watch has a feature on it that if I hit
[03:19:43] the ground at a certain speed it starts
[03:19:45] to call my watch
[03:19:47] automatically and um let her know that I
[03:19:49] fell and I got
[03:19:51] hurt um and if I don't if I don't like
[03:19:55] hit clear in a in like a certain amount
[03:19:57] of
[03:19:58] time
[03:19:59] so I'm a little uh a little more
[03:20:02] practical with what I do now I don't uh
[03:20:05] I don't do so much without uh any any
[03:20:07] backup plans anymore
[03:20:18] ah no problem uh no problem uh Oblivion
[03:20:21] not a problem at all butd I don't mind
[03:20:22] when you're talking to him that's what I
[03:20:24] like having community of people there I
[03:20:26] love this it's my thing it's all you
[03:20:28] like to do oh I forgot to do our

[03:21:24] some headaches had some injuries during
[03:21:26] my time
[03:21:28] frames that was probably my worst one
[03:21:30] but it was more of a stupid thing that's
[03:21:32] where anything I I do calculated danger
[03:21:34] like I say things I calculate them and
[03:21:36] if I get hurt I'm not going to die
[03:21:37] because I protect myself or I do
[03:21:39] something that's not going to kill me or
[03:21:41] I do it like you know like you know like
[03:21:43] a bungee jump or I haven't done that yet

[03:22:31] a drink
[03:22:36] here yeah but yeah I almost killed five
[03:22:39] times so the beginning of this the trip
[03:22:41] here I'll give you the story on that one
[03:22:44] because we we uh we're already past that
[03:22:46] section of the adventure game I was
[03:22:48] going uh we were coming in we were in
[03:22:50] Louisiana Louisiana I think yep uh we're
[03:22:53] traveling in the passing Lane because
[03:22:56] there and there's like a line of
[03:22:57] probably like 50 cars behind us because
[03:22:59] there's two cars in front of us there's
[03:23:00] a trailer truck passing another trailer
[03:23:03] truck in the traveling Lane so we're not
[03:23:05] going fast at all well a car decided
[03:23:07] they wanted to come up on the inside and
[03:23:09] I guess they didn't want to wait for
[03:23:10] everybody in the trailer truck so they
[03:23:11] tried to come up on the inside passing
[03:23:13] everyone and they decided they were
[03:23:15] gonna try to cut in front of me I have a
[03:23:16] Jeep Gladiator and that's what I was
[03:23:18] going out to Moab and Colorado to drive
[03:23:20] around with so they have a little Honda
[03:23:22] Civic it didn't work well for them
[03:23:24] because when I I hit my brakes leaning
[03:23:26] on my horn because they started merging
[03:23:27] into my lane like about this you can't
[03:23:30] see the picture right now can't see what
[03:23:32] I'm doing because the picture in the way
[03:23:33] they started moving in my lane and it
[03:23:35] was about like this like here I am in my
[03:23:37] Lane they started moving in like when
[03:23:38] they were like this like seriously so
[03:23:40] their front window was at my hood of my
[03:23:45] car the driver side window I'm leaning
[03:23:47] on my horn the entire time there's no
[03:23:50] space for them to move in there's like a
[03:23:51] carlink maybe in front of us car link
[03:23:53] and a half they start to move in in
[03:23:55] front of me they St keep pulling over so
[03:23:59] I have to move over into the breakdown
[03:24:00] Lane and instead of going off the grass
[03:24:03] and onto the breakdown Lane and off the
[03:24:05] road and getting driven off of the road
[03:24:06] to die or whatever I hit my brakes which
[03:24:09] is a good thing for her because I hit
[03:24:11] the quarter panel of her car when she
[03:24:14] hit me when the front end so the two of
[03:24:16] our cars hit cuz I didn't move I wasn't
[03:24:18] going to get run off the road and die
[03:24:19] and her rear corner panel hit the front
[03:24:21] end of my bumper and my tire now if I
[03:24:24] had kept stepping on the gas when that
[03:24:25] happened she would have gotten pit
[03:24:26] maneuvered right off the road into a
[03:24:28] tree and died so one I was nice and
[03:24:31] saved her life then she decided to lie
[03:24:32] to the police and say that I drove into
[03:24:34] her Lane and hit her nice thing was my
[03:24:38] wife and I being in the car together and
[03:24:40] I have um been in more than one
[03:24:43] situations with shitty people I was like
[03:24:45] get your phone out take picture
[03:24:47] immediately as soon as the person was
[03:24:48] there get that license plate because I
[03:24:49] don't trust them it looks like they're
[03:24:50] going to run they didn't put a blinker
[03:24:52] on or anything to turn so they pull out
[03:24:54] she pulls out her camera out takes a
[03:24:55] picture and you can see her car like
[03:24:57] immediately because like she just hit me
[03:24:59] and she didn't she kept emerging in even
[03:25:01] as she hit me we both kind of like did a
[03:25:03] Wibble wobble and didn't die and uh
[03:25:06] didn't spin out or anything and she uh
[03:25:08] so my wife took a picture right away the
[03:25:10] car is like this far away from us and
[03:25:13] you can't even see the whole back of the
[03:25:15] car of the front in front of her because
[03:25:16] that's how close she was and she cut
[03:25:18] into everything and she was in front of
[03:25:19] us so she lied to the police we like
[03:25:21] well we have a picture and the police
[03:25:22] saw the picture like all right well she
[03:25:23] told us different story and that's not
[03:25:24] what she said she said you pulled into
[03:25:25] herl I'm like well that's obviously not
[03:25:27] going to happen since she's in front of
[03:25:28] us in the picture he goes all right let
[03:25:30] me talk to her about this again ended up
[03:25:32] figuring out she lied and she's going to
[03:25:34] court for reckless driving and I have to
[03:25:36] talk to the insurance company to get a
[03:25:38] new bumper and uh see what my NE no she
[03:25:41] was just a [Â __Â ] trying to get [Â __Â ]
[03:25:43] fast in traffic I'm
[03:25:45] sorry sorry I shouldn't have said that
[03:25:49] inappropriate sorry I got annoyed she
[03:25:51] should she was just uh trying to rush
[03:25:53] through her day trying to rush through
[03:25:55] her day and hit us I don't know that's
[03:26:01] all yes I triy to control myself I told
[03:26:04] her like she came she got off her car
[03:26:06] and like was going towards us when we
[03:26:07] pulled over and I'm like I rolled my

[03:26:16] she like looked at me and tried to say
[03:26:18] something and I just rolled my window up
[03:26:20] because as soon as I saw her you can
[03:26:22] kind of look at people and you know what
[03:26:23] they're going to be like she was a
[03:26:24] person that was going to cause problems
[03:26:26] which I knew she was figuring she was
[03:26:27] gonna lie because she got her phone out
[03:26:29] right away and started like and her in
[03:26:31] her car part her car phone outl and
[03:26:33] started talking to so

[03:49:17] booster agility boosters you did have an
[03:49:21] intelligence booster you got a while

[03:49:49] now there's one fire lit and they can't
[03:49:50] come running towards you anymore only
[03:49:52] the flying ones are now you have a
[03:49:53] choices do you want to what do you want
[03:49:55] to do
[03:50:03] now take the plasma rifle hey that's
[03:50:05] nice not not bad
[03:50:08] one oh you got to keep an eye on the
[03:50:10] robot oh you think there could be
[03:50:11] something bad with the robot maybe we're
[03:50:13] not sure
[03:50:25] you want to shoot some bugs all right I
[03:50:27] like
[03:50:28] it you're going to push up to the hive
[03:50:30] Nest a little bit oh not a bad idea want
[03:50:33] to push up to the hive Nest a little bit
[03:50:35] and shoot some bugs while you're doing
[03:50:36] it let's do that right you guys push
[03:50:38] towards that Hive Nest you start
[03:50:40] shooting those bugs and out of the
[03:50:42] ground comes a small area oh no oh as
[03:50:45] you walk towards it some small bugs
[03:50:47] start crawling on the ground towards you
[03:50:48] you're shooting
[03:50:51] them your lasers and all that I can't
[03:50:54] make so many good noises I don't have to
[03:50:55] get noises built better in the game
[03:50:57] anyways you're shooting those off your
[03:50:59] uh your robots in the background on the
[03:51:02] on the on the
[03:51:05] um truck shooting all right now you take
[03:51:09] out these little bugs lots of them just
[03:51:11] splattering all over the place luckily
[03:51:13] they're not very hard to kill they're
[03:51:14] only like 20 damage you got some pretty
[03:51:16] good pretty good things going on now
[03:51:18] You' pushed up you've gotten closer now
[03:51:21] currently I'd say you are near enough
[03:51:24] that you could probably get the uh the
[03:51:26] big queen that you see there in the
[03:51:28] middle you could probably hit her pretty
[03:51:29] easily with a with the plasma rifle or
[03:51:32] um some of your other
[03:51:35] things bring the vehicle just in case
[03:51:37] all
[03:51:38] right hey you guy with a face
[03:51:45] hey not a problem the guy with the face
[03:51:46] hey not a problem at all I I I I was uh
[03:51:48] you know on vacation I couldn't get on
[03:51:50] into everything the internet just wasn't
[03:51:52] the best where I was going
[03:51:54] around really what it
[03:51:56] was so you're going to push forward with
[03:51:59] the truck all right you bring the truck
[03:52:01] up with you you roll up you have the you
[03:52:03] have the robot roll up the truck behind
[03:52:05] you all right I like that idea we'll do
[03:52:06] that instead so the robot takes that
[03:52:08] truck up behind you guys you start
[03:52:09] rolling up closer with
[03:52:11] it so if you want to try uh safe
[03:52:13] distance try to shootting the queen with
[03:52:15] a plasma rifle now remember you do have
[03:52:18] an intelligence
[03:52:19] booster intelligence boosters do have
[03:52:22] help technology and
[03:52:23] aiming just so you guys remember
[03:52:28] that amulet can come in handy there you
[03:52:31] have the critical amulet you've used
[03:52:33] that you've you've used that and it
[03:52:34] lasts for the entire like section uh
[03:52:36] kind of encounter so you have a critical
[03:52:39] amulet that's lasting the entire
[03:52:40] encounter so that will help you that is
[03:52:43] correct
[03:52:48] let's see what happens there you going
[03:52:49] to shoot him with the critical hip I
[03:52:51] like it you shoot him from the
[03:52:54] distance oh pair with the intelligence
[03:52:57] booster let's try it out let's try it
[03:53:00] out use the intelligence booster oh look
[03:53:03] at that you go hey take the intelligence
[03:53:05] booster you throw it over to Kao Kyoto
[03:53:07] takes that intelligence booster I'm just
[03:53:08] going to open this up because I want to
[03:53:09] see what's in here because when you move
[03:53:11] forward and you're killing some of the
[03:53:12] bugs you find some on the ground and go
[03:53:14] oh look at this I want to see what's in
[03:53:18] this all right you know no oh good idea
[03:53:21] no the weaker spots is a good idea so
[03:53:23] you now you're SW you go out there and
[03:53:25] you're leaning forward you're getting
[03:53:27] I'm hiding behind your truck again Petty

[03:53:54] push
[03:53:55] forward you lean
[03:53:59] towards you look towards a queen you use
[03:54:02] your intelligence booster we like that
[03:54:04] idea that was a good one to use the
[03:54:05] intelligence booster
[03:54:08] there because now you start shooting you
[03:54:13] do see some weak
[03:54:15] spots you do see some weak spots perfect
[03:54:19] job on that one you find weak spots and
[03:54:21] you start shooting away at the uh at the
[03:54:26] queen in the back there with your plasma
[03:54:28] rifle from the
[03:54:29] background the go the 9volt devil coming

[03:55:01] number one two three four five six seven
[03:55:04] eight nine now she can't get out the
[03:55:06] queen she's stuck in there but she
[03:55:08] starts sending out waves of bigger bugs
[03:55:12] the big bugs with explosives on
[03:55:16] them you are shooting it you've already
[03:55:18] exposed some of the weak spots you've
[03:55:20] already shot some of the weak spots
[03:55:21] she's already angry and upset with you
[03:55:24] and now what she's doing is she's
[03:55:27] sending out more bugs because she's
[03:55:30] mad oh no problem that nbol I understand
[03:55:33] that I understand that you did a great
[03:55:35] job I appreciate

[03:55:52] one it's not a bad one all right so what
[03:55:53] we're going to do here is we are going
[03:55:56] to shoot them enjoying the story all
[03:55:58] right hey wait this story is um I I did
[03:56:02] this trip but I'm making into my Fallout

[03:56:40] them now a few of them explode right
[03:56:43] next to her causing damage to the nest
[03:56:45] so the nest starts to crumble around
[03:56:48] that big Queen and she starts to hang
[03:56:49] out a little bit further not good
[03:56:51] there's more her underbelly exposed now

[04:01:27] you hydroa hydro electric specimen

[04:02:02] necrom you're very
[04:02:04] welcome so you want to see if you can
[04:02:07] overcharge and shoot it to deal some
[04:02:09] more damage with the engineering booster
[04:02:11] oh you know that's not a bad idea let's
[04:02:14] see I think that's a good idea but
[04:02:15] what's going to happen is it's going to
[04:02:16] take some that that means your plasma
[04:02:18] rifle is going to take some damage when
[04:02:20] you overcharge all right so if you're
[04:02:23] overcharging each overcharge is going to
[04:02:25] cause 10% damage to it so you're gonna
[04:02:29] lose it eventually if you keep
[04:02:30] overcharging what do you want to do then
[04:02:32] if you overcharge you have to use two of
[04:02:34] your shots at once so that means you
[04:02:36] kill two shots at a
[04:02:37] time you're very welcome Kyoto
[04:02:44] you can try to use uh you can try to
[04:02:46] overcharge it if you

[04:02:50] you going to you want to try that
[04:02:53] out overcharging do a couple little
[04:02:56] tweaks with your engineering booster you
[04:02:58] overcharge it and it will allow it to
[04:02:59] shoot more but hey we'll see what
[04:03:01] happens it might cause an issue we're

[04:06:40] creatures here the Wasteland now you say
[04:06:43] you're going to overcharge kyota had to
[04:06:45] leave I think again so uh what do you
[04:06:48] guys want to do with uh with on our on
[04:06:50] our adventure here we're gonna um just
[04:06:53] let him uh gonna overcharge it and
[04:07:02] shoot I think it's a good idea to shoot
[04:07:05] probably
[04:07:07] yes what do you guys think all right I'm
[04:07:09] going to uh open this up too we're going
[04:07:12] to see what this is cuz you've been
[04:07:13] killing some bugs I feel like we should
[04:07:15] be seeing some fun things getting
[04:07:18] killed hey Bones nice stretch there what
[04:07:21] you doing
[04:07:23] dog come to hang out see what's going on
[04:07:27] all right what do you guys want to do in
[04:07:28] this Wasteland Adventure right now there
[04:07:30] currently at the top of our Mountain uh
[04:07:31] fighting off some bugs in the
[04:07:38] nest all right we're gonna see what we
[04:07:39] get out of this Monastery raid become
[04:07:42] anonymous
[04:07:45] Palazo archers Island Lea Hassan ACR
[04:07:51] seven not bad restart the sequence in
[04:07:54] foil at AAL Breaker of Chains and a uh
[04:07:59] can't remember that one the art card
[04:08:01] there not a great pack not a great pack
[04:08:03] I I bet I got the first two packs for
[04:08:05] the best ones out of the um out of that
[04:08:08] bundle that's overcharge but could we
[04:08:10] possibly place a single regular rifle
[04:08:12] shot round launched with a plasma shot
[04:08:14] oh I don't know about that we can
[04:08:17] overcharge it that would probably take
[04:08:19] some uh time to use at an equipment in a
[04:08:21] workshop
[04:08:22] somewhere so I think we we we're gonna
[04:08:24] just just overcharge it not
[04:08:30] overcharge no that would single rifle
[04:08:33] bullet round no you'd have to that would
[04:08:35] have to be um some more mechanical stuff
[04:08:37] that you'd have to you'd have to have a
[04:08:38] workshop you'd have to be at in some of
[04:08:40] the Cities we have had workshops but you
[04:08:41] guys haven't gone in this in um
[04:08:44] you haven't investigated everything in
[04:08:45] all of
[04:08:47] them so it's up to you you want to try
[04:08:50] to overcharge that's a quick one because
[04:08:51] it's a couple of buttons you can kind of
[04:08:53] press and it it makes an extra shell but
[04:08:55] is up to you on what you're going to do
[04:09:01] here all
[04:09:07] right all right you're gonna overcharge
[04:09:09] the
[04:09:10] rifle you overcharge that plasma rifle
[04:09:14] and you take a
[04:09:15] shot at the bug's
[04:09:21] nest with the queen and you shoot the
[04:09:23] bottom of the queen because she was
[04:09:24] starting to crumble from the last
[04:09:27] explosion and that's a nice good idea
[04:09:29] there you shoot the bottom and it
[04:09:30] crumbles
[04:09:31] more she is almost dead she starts
[04:09:35] falling out and she's very mad now she
[04:09:37] starts sending swarms of flying bugs
[04:09:40] towards you because the fires are
[04:09:41] burning in front of her she can't get
[04:09:42] any the other one out and you're too
[04:09:45] close so got one last thing you're going
[04:09:49] to do you're at 10 you're 90% on your uh
[04:09:52] our plasma rifle The Queen Is there a
[04:09:55] bunch of the bugs are shooting your your
[04:09:57] robot's taking care of the little bug
[04:09:58] fine he's got good Aim so you don't need
[04:10:00] to worry about the robots the the little
[04:10:02] bugs that are flying right now you just
[04:10:03] got to figure out what to do with the
[04:10:07] queen how well can the robot hand The
[04:10:09] Recoil well he's been taking care of the
[04:10:11] bugs in the background I don't know the
[04:10:12] recoil pretty good he's been taking care
[04:10:14] of all the flying bugs for you so you
[04:10:16] could focus on the uh the queen so I
[04:10:19] don't know it's up to you you want to
[04:10:20] have them what do you want to have the
[04:10:22] robot
[04:10:26] do now maybe somebody wants to try one
[04:10:28] of these instead and go for some secret
[04:10:32] layer so you want a full auto the queen
[04:10:35] oh all right all right so you turn uh
[04:10:37] turn the assault rifle You full auto it
[04:10:40] the bugs are flying over that's okay you
[04:10:43] and your other guys start fighting the
[04:10:44] bugs shooting the bugs off all right and
[04:10:48] he full autos on the queen I like
[04:10:51] it take that assault rifle You full
[04:10:55] auto your robot in the back of the
[04:11:02] truck is now going full auto shooting
[04:11:05] with his one arm even though one was
[04:11:06] taken off by an explosion that's okay
[04:11:08] he's a robot shooting away and you know
[04:11:12] what that's a good one the Queen gets
[04:11:13] hit she's hit a bunch of times and ends
[04:11:16] up falling out of your nest the rest of
[04:11:22] the bugs start scattering away they
[04:11:23] don't know what to
[04:11:29] do yes you're using the plasma rifle he
[04:11:32] has the assault rifle not the plasma
[04:11:34] rifle so he's switching the assault
[04:11:35] rifle
[04:11:37] over or a plasma rifle because you use
[04:11:40] the assault rifle and he's going to use
[04:11:41] almost all the weapon all the ammo but
[04:11:43] but you killing the queen Oblivion
[04:11:45] you're the winner of our giveaway with
[04:11:48] oh hold on I got to move this screen so
[04:11:50] you can see
[04:11:51] it you got a foil etched alexos de damos
[04:11:57] of
[04:11:58] Cosmos not bad for you
[04:12:03] Oblivion yes they have the assault rifle
[04:12:05] yep so use the assault rifle use almost
[04:12:06] all the ammo you're down to like four
[04:12:08] shots but the queen Falls dead out of
[04:12:13] the tower the bug starts
[04:12:15] scrambling what are you going to do now
[04:12:17] do you want to loot that
[04:12:23] place now with the Looting you're going
[04:12:27] to go loot it this is what we're going
[04:12:28] to let you do with looting here because
[04:12:30] you go and loot no one's bought any of

[04:12:33] do this we're going to pull something
[04:12:34] out of the deluxe box to see what we get
[04:12:36] in the loot process you're just going to
[04:12:38] see what the item is you're not going to
[04:12:39] keep the thing we're just going to see
[04:12:40] what the item was all right so give me a
[04:12:42] number out of I think it's like 15 or 20
[04:12:45] in here and then I'm going to see what
[04:12:47] our thing is so we can get just the item
[04:12:50] that's written on it not the package

[04:13:09] um Commander Masters right now because
[04:13:11] I'm out of those butd you have an
[04:13:13] engineering booster again nice you have
[04:13:16] a second engineering booster that's
[04:13:17] going to come in handy down the road
[04:13:20] here
[04:13:24] wonderful that's awesome now get that

[04:20:49] Horizon's three gift bundle tomorrow on

[04:21:08] know get their stuff together because
[04:21:09] we're going to start doing homeschooling
[04:21:11] too so I want them to get used to
[04:21:13] getting up in the morning and relaxing
[04:21:15] and focusing on stuff rather than
[04:21:17] getting up in the morning and um
[04:21:19] instantly act exercising or

[04:21:27] seeing what we get maybe we'll get some
[04:21:29] good hits maybe not we'll find
[04:21:32] out but it's always up to you guys
[04:21:34] though what's going to go on and if
[04:21:35] we're gonna have any good luck on that
[04:21:37] day you always come in and play
[04:21:39] participate play some of the games maybe
[04:21:40] you want to go with a basic loot box and
[04:21:42] help us on here because we just looted
[04:21:45] that um you know the nest we're we're
[04:21:48] done with the nest Loot and tangerine
[04:21:51] coming in with the win of an arod Dorian
[04:21:54] arod Dorian
[04:21:56] Tangerine you got some luck
[04:22:00] today Tangerine getting all the luck
[04:22:10] today yeah I uh yeah they're they're
[04:22:13] expensive they are expensive that's the
[04:22:16] weird like I couldn't do any like I it
[04:22:18] sucks as how expensive they are but um
[04:22:20] that's why I figure I'll throw them in
[04:22:21] some of the games because it I can put
[04:22:23] it as a ceiling in the game because how
[04:22:25] how how high they are on the expense of
[04:22:26] them I got six of them um from the place
[04:22:29] I buy distribution from but
[04:22:32] um yeah I didn't get the best price on
[04:22:35] it and I was like I don't even know if
[04:22:36] I'm going to do it again because I was

[04:26:21] time a lot of it we get to have some fun
[04:26:22] I love doing this because we we hang out
[04:26:26] talk talk about life and eventually
[04:26:29] what's gonna happen is I'm G to start
[04:26:30] traveling around when we're in our boat
[04:26:32] I'm G to do this from the boat I'm gonna
[04:26:33] be live streaming from the boat and what
[04:26:36] I'm GNA do here is um I have a
[04:26:38] distribution center I'm talking to to
[04:26:39] have my stuff there so what I'll have is
[04:26:41] if you guys byy pack you can buy them
[04:26:42] and they'll get shipped to you like as
[04:26:43] singles as a packs here like they are I
[04:26:46] won't be able to open every single one
[04:26:47] of them that I get shipped from the
[04:26:48] warehouse but they're going to be
[04:26:50] cheaper be than me opening them on
[04:26:52] screen now if I'm I'm to auction them
[04:26:55] off the ones I do for opening on screen
[04:26:57] we be the regular price that I do but
[04:26:59] the way that I'll be doing that is um
[04:27:02] I'm going to have uh it'll ship from
[04:27:06] wherever I am and it'll go to the
[04:27:07] warehouse and ship out from there so I
[04:27:09] will still have stuff that be opening on
[04:27:10] the boat just maybe not as much I'll be
[04:27:12] focusing a little bit more on kind of
[04:27:13] the game
[04:27:14] stuff but we have some good ideas though

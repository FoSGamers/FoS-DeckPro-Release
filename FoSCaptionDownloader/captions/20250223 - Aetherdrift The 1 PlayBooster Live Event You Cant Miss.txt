[00:54:08] potentially you yeah talking about the
[00:54:10] the poure over coffee it's a little
[00:54:13] sour but we had powdered creamer cuz you
[00:54:15] know we live on a boat so sometimes you
[00:54:16] have to get powdered
[00:54:18] stuff
[00:54:22] so let's see what we can do today
[00:54:26] a little bit longer to get back here
[00:54:27] because uh cuz this was broken into
[00:54:29] three part four pieces and you can see
[00:54:31] it doesn't Bend anymore now what
[00:54:32] happened was I had to go to a doctor try

[00:54:35] they can't do anything about it but that
[00:54:37] pushed back my sailing ability because I
[00:54:39] can't use my hand well for a while so
[00:54:41] get before we got back here
[00:54:43] so that's kind of what we're
[00:54:46] at that's why it took so long to get
[00:54:50] back yes it was it was a KN over so this
[00:54:55] is what Fancy with the finger up and I
[00:54:58] can only do hang 10 I can never give a

I need an AI narrator that sounds like a, that's a female, sounds like, you know, an attractive female, whatever you want to say. They're going to be the narrator for whenever we have anything going on with Bigger Boat Adventures or anything I would like to have going on on, like anything we have going on here. So what we'll end up doing is you're going to help generate what the narrator will say because we'll tell you what we would are doing. You'll generate what the narrator will say to make sure people are addressed as intrigue and everything like that. Then I'll send it over, copy the transcript into the application or website or whatever it is to generate my narrator speaking for my background of my videos.

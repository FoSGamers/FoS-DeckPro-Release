[00:13:16] wasn't telling me I didn't have hot
[00:13:17] hands but now you
[00:13:20] do oh really that's
[00:13:23] insane no wonder why they had so many at
[00:13:25] the stores that pisses me off now that's
[00:13:28] why the line was like that and they were
[00:13:30] doing that a that's just a see I only
[00:13:33] wanted a few for myself so I was going
[00:13:35] to have I would I wanted to have 10
[00:13:36] total so I wanted to stiff stick a
[00:13:39] couple away just hold on to for a while
[00:13:41] for my family and I and I wanted to put
[00:13:44] open a couple for my family then I
[00:13:46] wanted to have a couple like like three
[00:13:48] or four for the store so I didn't have
[00:13:50] enough for that so I ended up having to
[00:13:51] like cut it down like one per each thing
[00:13:53] that I was doing instead of a
[00:13:55] couple they were like 250
[00:13:59] I
[00:14:00] know I know I guess we don't need
[00:14:02] Williams like L morning hey AJ is that
[00:14:03] okay if I do that and go on to Casanova
[00:14:05] stuff I just was double
[00:14:06] checking I mean he has three packs and
[00:14:09] then I we have oh we do have some Dusk
[00:14:10] and we have one duskborn pull box from
[00:14:12] our buddy Jared yeah okay I just want to
[00:14:15] be sure he has three um three out 30 and
[00:14:17] Legend which is the last three
[00:14:19] here if you don't mind because this is
[00:14:21] like seven nine packs in here you
[00:14:24] know and then um I'm going to put this
[00:14:26] right here at the top because that's
[00:14:29] yours all right and then
[00:14:34] um yeah Primo yep exactly yep and then
[00:14:40] um Jared you'll come up right after our
[00:14:43] buddy um here with these three cuz these
[00:14:46] are the last one that we got in the Box
[00:14:48] here that's pretty yeah pretty much what
[00:14:50] they would do is they buy the go box go
[00:14:52] over open it give somebody a mystery
[00:14:54] booster um and take the ones inside or
[00:14:56] go buy B multiple ones and then go over
[00:14:59] and sell them cuz at one point I'm like
[00:15:00] how do these stores all of a sudden have
[00:15:01] like like stacks of boxes and that's
[00:15:10] why you know it's their choice to do it
[00:15:12] but you know that's why and it made
[00:15:14] sense and there's people that they have
[00:15:16] like you know they have customers that
[00:15:17] wanted at their stores like there was
[00:15:18] one person that went up and said hey can
[00:15:19] I buy some they're no we're not selling
[00:15:21] any of them because these are for

[01:29:26] going to get since that's what we pulled
[01:29:27] is rares and giant packs of cards but
[01:29:30] what I'm going to do is where did I put

[01:30:34] everything is possible is as transparent
[01:30:36] as possible when I'm doing anything
[01:30:37] that's why I always try to show
[01:30:38] everything completely on screen the way
[01:30:39] I do that's just kind of me or like I
[01:30:42] like when I do breaks I like to do them

[01:37:07] from um
[01:37:12] magicon last
[01:37:14] night yes we did we did run the one last
[01:37:18] night I pinged everybody in it too that
[01:37:20] participated that he didn't get to see
[01:37:22] it all you should be able to see it on
[01:37:23] YouTube YouTube

[01:37:42] open these up if I missed something I'm
[01:37:44] sorry
[01:37:45] um Zach
[01:37:48] here so the spot would be for there you
[01:37:50] go that shows you manages 10 mystery
[01:37:53] boosters twos and one plane shift what
[01:37:55] we do is we open them here you know what
[01:37:57] I'll I'll have let me see if I can do
[01:37:59] this here let me see if it'll let me add
[01:38:01] anything to the
[01:38:04] description N I wish it would let me
[01:38:06] edit it that would be
[01:38:08] nice I need to edit the description but
[01:38:11] anyways the way that we do it is we open
[01:38:13] them all we take all the mythics and the
[01:38:15] rares that put them in the sleeves then
[01:38:17] we take any uncommon or common that is
[01:38:19] $3 or more and we put them in the
[01:38:21] sleeves also we shuffle them up and then
[01:38:23] we hand them out per spot based on the
[01:38:25] number what your spot is that you get so
[01:38:27] so you get number four you'll be the
[01:38:29] fourth one that gets card handed you but
[01:38:30] it's also after I shuffle them all up
[01:38:32] now if it's C that's like $10 or more we
[01:38:34] make a proxy for it that we put in to
[01:38:35] shuffle up so we don't ruin any of them
[01:38:37] but that's how I do it that
[01:38:39] way and then afterwards you take all the
[01:38:41] commons and uncommons that are under
[01:38:43] under that at the end of the stream I
[01:38:46] pack handles those all out so that
[01:38:47] everybody gets them handed out to them
[01:38:49] but right now we're going to open up
[01:38:50] this mystery booster 2 one of the family

[02:40:53] visit our friends in Texas um when we
[02:40:56] went to Moab we drove through
[02:40:58] there I actually got hit by a car in
[02:41:03] um Alabama I think no it was Louisiana
[02:41:06] Louisiana never mind I lied Louisiana is
[02:41:08] where I got hit by the
[02:41:11] car yeah it wasn't bad there was more of
[02:41:13] them the car was trying to like go
[02:41:15] through traffic and cut on inside of
[02:41:17] like a bunch of cars and I was in a line
[02:41:20] of like a 100 cars and they were all
[02:41:21] trying to pass the same trailer truck
[02:41:24] and they tried to like cut in front of
[02:41:25] everyone and drive down the inside Lane
[02:41:28] not you know the the the uh the the
[02:41:31] traveling Lane and what happened was I'm
[02:41:33] here going in my Lane we're going to
[02:41:35] zoom out a little bit so we can uh we
[02:41:37] can have some uh we can have some better
[02:41:39] uh view of things all right we're going
[02:41:41] to use two packs of cards here all right
[02:41:43] I'm the um ion lost C Exon cuz I'm I'm a
[02:41:46] big I'm big dino monster in a uh a in a
[02:41:50] in a uh Jeep Gladiator all right and
[02:41:53] they are this wild crazy lady the wild
[02:41:56] little drain lady rolling around in her
[02:41:58] little [ __ ] Honda Civic thinking she
[02:42:00] was going to run through me or something
[02:42:01] all right so going down the highway like
[02:42:03] this all right there's a line of cars
[02:42:06] now imagine this is the car in front of
[02:42:08] me so there's not a full car length to
[02:42:10] get into front of me where the trailer
[02:42:12] truck is so we're going over and I'm
[02:42:14] just going with traffic chugging along
[02:42:16] and this lady decides oh I'm going to
[02:42:17] pull over here and my no blanker and get
[02:42:20] in front of you and I'm like laying on
[02:42:21] my horn I go over here slide over to the
[02:42:24] side and I finally once I hit the grass
[02:42:26] I don't want to go off the gr off the
[02:42:27] ground and die so I stay exactly right
[02:42:29] there and I H my brakes hard and luckily
[02:42:32] the people behind me were paying
[02:42:33] attention so they you because I had um
[02:42:35] two I had to um in the back of my truck
[02:42:38] I literally had two
[02:42:40] um two long iron rails for um that were
[02:42:45] um
[02:42:46] my rock guards that we were putting on
[02:42:49] my friend's house when we got there cuz
[02:42:50] he had some of the tools and a couple of
[02:42:51] parts I was missing so only strapped
[02:42:53] down on the back so these two giant iron
[02:42:55] rods that are used for rock rail so when
[02:42:57] I roll over a rock I don't ruin my truck
[02:42:59] those are they were strapped down very
[02:43:01] nicely but I hit the brakes we went from
[02:43:02] like 75 to about probably [ __ ] 40 so
[02:43:06] we didn't get hit and then they pulled
[02:43:07] over in front of us and they still kept
[02:43:09] going even as I lean on my brakes lean
[02:43:11] hit my brakes leaned on my horn they
[02:43:13] clipped the front of my car my truck I
[02:43:15] mean only my bumper barely got any any
[02:43:17] damage to my bumper or anything but but
[02:43:19] I think they clipped my tire so I might
[02:43:20] need to get an alignment but um their
[02:43:22] car the whole back quarter panel was
[02:43:24] pretty much destroyed and run over and
[02:43:27] um then they lied to the police the
[02:43:29] funny thing was they lied to the police
[02:43:32] that was the greatest part about it they
[02:43:34] lied to the police and um they got
[02:43:37] caught lying to the police they said
[02:43:39] that I tried to I had road rage and I
[02:43:43] tried to run her off the road into her
[02:43:45] side and I turned into her and hit her
[02:43:48] um but luckily my wife when that was
[02:43:50] happening I was like get your phone out
[02:43:51] this lady's going to run into me and she
[02:43:53] took her phone out and took a picture of
[02:43:54] the lady in front of us in the passing
[02:43:57] Lane which she said she never got into
[02:43:59] the passing Lane and it was that we
[02:44:00] turned into her so yeah that's what
[02:44:03] happened there it was a crazy crazy crap
[02:44:05] but she lied to the police the police
[02:44:07] ended up catching catching her lie just
[02:44:09] mainly because of the picture and we
[02:44:10] called the police right away saying what
[02:44:11] was going
[02:44:13] on yeah we were good their car was a
[02:44:16] little messed up but they were yeah that
[02:44:19] was my crazy story from
[02:44:23] Louisiana oh gulport yeah we drove right
[02:44:26] through gulport we drove right through
[02:44:27] Golfport actually going over there yeah
[02:44:30] I mean I like some of the areas just the
[02:44:31] people sometimes the people there were
[02:44:33] just uh yeah that that like seriously
[02:44:35] you made a mistake you tried to be a
[02:44:38] dick and you're going to try and then
[02:44:39] you're going to lie about it
[02:44:46] what looking at her though I was I
[02:44:49] expected it as soon as she got out of
[02:44:51] the car she soon as she pulled over her
[02:44:53] car behind me cuz I pulled over I saw
[02:44:55] what she looked like cuz I didn't see
[02:44:57] her that well when she hit me I'm not
[02:44:59] paying attention to where I'm just
[02:45:00] paying attention to the car and um so

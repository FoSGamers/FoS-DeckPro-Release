[00:11:05] too bad not too bad on those
[00:11:11] ones I think I might be missing a spot
[00:11:13] here what did I
[00:11:18] do one two three four five six okay yeah
[00:11:22] there was ah it was up nine remaining
[00:11:24] spots I was off by one when I counted
[00:11:27] earlier that's fine
[00:11:30] so there's only nine remaining spots so
[00:11:31] there six of them left over right now
[00:11:34] for those that you want to participate
[00:11:35] in that one no the way whe we do this is
[00:11:38] I take all of the mythics and the rares
[00:11:42] I put them in the sleeves then I also
[00:11:43] take all the $3 that are uncom all
[00:11:46] Commons and uncommons that are $3 more
[00:11:47] and I put them in sleeves also we
[00:11:49] Shuffle those all up and we hand them
[00:11:51] out in order based on the spot that you
[00:11:53] are so spot number one we'll get the
[00:11:54] first card and then all the way through
[00:11:56] spot number 15 at the end um and that's
[00:12:00] pretty much what we do just hand them
[00:12:01] out one at a time all the way through
[00:12:02] them and that way everybody at least
[00:12:04] gets one of something because I've been
[00:12:05] in color break before where I literally
[00:12:07] have gotten one card and people walked
[00:12:09] away with all kinds of stuff so I'm like
[00:12:11] what the hell so I like doing it this
[00:12:12] way it's a little bit more there kind of
[00:12:14] for me oh you're pretty new to Magic
[00:12:15] nice to see hey we like to open packs
[00:12:17] all the time right we do it on a regular
[00:12:19] basis in the morning on the eastern
[00:12:20] coast every now and again we're on in
[00:12:22] the afternoons here so that's how we do
[00:12:24] that and then we take all the all the
[00:12:26] fifth edition ones we're actually to put
[00:12:27] in sleeves Shuffle Up and hand out
[00:12:29] everyone so everybody gets a fifth a
[00:12:32] ofion yeah I like doing the chaos ones

[00:12:36] are picked up by the boys here my oldest
[00:12:38] William picked these chunk my youngest

[00:21:36] they're hanging out and saying who's get
[00:21:38] the best best luck for the
[00:21:40] day they had picked him out uh I think
[00:21:43] it was either last night or this morning
[00:21:44] I can't remember when I had him pick him
[00:21:47] out I think it was this morning either
[00:21:50] way this should be a fun one though no
[00:21:53] it was last night cuz I was going to do
[00:21:54] the show yesterday um yesterday
[00:21:57] afternoon but my back was just w could
[00:21:58] sore from Lady trying to kill me in her
[00:22:01] car when I was on my one wheeel in the
[00:22:03] uh walk light going across crosswalk on
[00:22:05] a
[00:22:06] street you know whatever so be it I'm
[00:22:09] alive though I'm alive
[00:22:11] though that's all that matters at the
[00:22:16] moment and hopefully soon we're going to
[00:22:18] have an answer on our boat here on
[00:22:20] exactly what they're fixing and what
[00:22:22] they aren't so we can prepare for what
[00:22:24] we need to know further here for you
[00:22:27] guys
[00:22:31] maybe I need to do this
[00:22:36] that slide that down a little bit there
[00:22:39] we
[00:22:39] go that's a little
[00:22:43] better oh yeah only four spots left
[00:22:45] let's get them filled up here yeah so we
[00:22:49] have some
[00:22:51] uh good stuff we on what is it um coming
[00:22:55] up I think it's the 12th or the 14th
[00:22:58] there's be another uh special s I'll be
[00:23:00] doing some sales going in for Christmas
[00:23:01] get your kind of like last stuff in
[00:23:03] before the holiday trying to get them
[00:23:04] shipped out before you get it at the
[00:23:05] place well some good sales set up then
[00:23:07] because I'll be in my second location
[00:23:09] where I'll finally be set up and like
[00:23:11] not have to worry about moving until we
[00:23:12] move to hopefully the last time which
[00:23:14] would be onto the boat and then once
[00:23:15] we're on the boat we won't have to worry
[00:23:17] about doing that anymore oh look at that
[00:23:18] everyone got three spots left all right
[00:23:21] all right here we
[00:23:22] go Nico is going to do another one I
[00:23:25] like it that means we got three spots
[00:23:29] left here everyone three spots left I
[00:23:32] think we can close this baby out what do
[00:23:34] y all think here there's a there about a
[00:23:36] handful of you in here and some of you
[00:23:38] on the on that YouTube land there so let
[00:23:40] me know if you want to jump in on it you
[00:23:41] can always come over here jump in on the
[00:23:43] break here participate in it there's
[00:23:46] Trace there we go there's two spots left
[00:23:48] there we go all right that means there's
[00:23:50] two spots who was going to get the last
[00:23:54] two who's going to get the last two
[00:23:56] we're going to see who has better luck
[00:23:58] will or Nolan and who is going to get
[00:23:59] the last two spots out of the break here
[00:24:04] today because have a feeling this is
[00:24:07] going to be a good one because whenever
[00:24:08] the kids participate where they get the
[00:24:10] they pick stuff we always hit something
[00:24:12] big somewhere I can't guarantee where
[00:24:14] which who's going to get it the big
[00:24:16] thing but we always seem to hit
[00:24:17] something big whenever one of the kids
[00:24:19] uh pick packs so let's see if we can we
[00:24:22] only have two spots left and then we'll
[00:24:24] get into our break of our packs here
[00:24:26] have a little bit of fun for this
[00:24:27] afternoon and uh go about even a little
[00:24:30] bit more fun later tomorrow morning

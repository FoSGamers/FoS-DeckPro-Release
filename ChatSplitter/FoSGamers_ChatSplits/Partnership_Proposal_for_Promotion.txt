[2024-09-05 16:11:41] FoSGamers:
I need you to write me an email to send to the sorcery contested realm sorcery, whoever makes it, figure it out on the internet, and find like an email address of who it would be sent to and I need you to make an email for me. I want the email to say that, you know, point out that I'm FoSGamers . I'll give my real name obviously and stuff like that at the end, but FoSGamers. You can look us up on YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and then whatnot. Whatnot specifically is the main primary selling platform, but you can also look at the following we have on YouTube and a regular amount of views and stuff like we have with our videos. And what I would like you to do is generate an email to them saying that I have been an avid supporter of them since I found out about them about a while back and have supported their art and even got some new players to be on board through some of the streaming I've done. I would like to be able to utilize some more stuff with them also and if we could work out something where, I don't know how you talk to them, figure out how to do this, you know, use the internet, use your own research, but you know, figure out how to say like, you know, I want to work with you guys or I want you to work with me so that I can help promote the Sorcery product because it looks like you may only get a few hundred views per your videos on a regular basis and that's over sometimes even weeks and I get that in a couple hours. And I would like to help promote some of your stuff there so that that many thousands of people see it on a regular basis. Within a week, I have anywhere from, you know, 10 to 100,000 people that watch me depending on how many shows I do and how long my shows are. So if there's like a release and things coming out, I can, every time I do anything like that where I'm promoting it and I have a big giveaway related to it, that's when we have a lot of extra viewers that come in and stuff like that. So, I mean, I've had everywhere up to, you know, on one live itself in the one day, I think it was like 10 or 12,000 people. So if we can get you guys on board, I think we can help promote Sorcery and it would be a beneficial thing for the two of us to work together to have that type of a thing as a team. And one of the biggest things too is I always like to promote art from everyone all around, you know, as you can notice people that even do their own art stuff related to whatnot, that have stuff related to either magic or even stuff that are, you know, they make dinosaur eggs or dragon eggs, I mean, you know, whatever it is that I promote people's art. So that's something that I like to promote specifically with Sorcery is the art with it too. So that's another thing that you throw in there with the email, but use FOSgamers, thoroughly learn and understand what they are, at least find each one of the websites I mentioned and read into multiple pages about them and multiple reviews of them and stuff like that and comments and things like that and what the videos are. That way you can know what they are and what I do on a regular basis and how many people watch us, how many things I've done for sales, and I've only been going for a year and I'm only doing it by myself. I started part-time and I only started doing this full-time two months ago.

**Subject:** Partnership Opportunity with FoSGamers to Promote Sorcery: Contested Realm

Dear Erik and the Sorcery: Contested Realm Team,

My name is [Your Name], and I run *FoSGamers*, a growing content creation and live-streaming platform. We focus primarily on trading card games such as *Magic: The Gathering*, *Sorcery: Contested Realm*, and more. You can find us on Whatnot (our primary selling platform), YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook. We’ve built a dedicated and highly engaged community in a relatively short period, and I would love the opportunity to partner with you to help promote *Sorcery: Contested Realm* even further.

Since discovering Sorcery, I’ve become a huge fan of its unique gameplay and beautiful hand-painted art. I've introduced new players to the game through my streams and sales on Whatnot. I truly believe in the game’s potential and would love to support its continued growth.

Our platform regularly reaches thousands of viewers per stream—often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 views over the course of a week, depending on the length of shows and how many we run. We see spikes during special events and giveaways, which could coincide perfectly with *Sorcery* releases or events. For example, a recent stream attracted over 12,000 viewers in just one day, demonstrating our community’s high level of engagement.

I’ve noticed that your official content, while fantastic, doesn’t always reach as many people as I believe it could. I'd love to help bridge that gap by promoting *Sorcery: Contested Realm* to my audience, whether through featured streams, giveaways, or collaborations. Given the overlap between the high appreciation for traditional fantasy art within our community and *Sorcery's* art-focused design, I think this could be a mutually beneficial partnership.

Moreover, I always strive to highlight the artistic aspects of the games and products I showcase. With *Sorcery* placing such a high value on traditional, hand-painted art, I believe my platform is the perfect space to promote the incredible artistry behind your cards, further aligning with my audience’s interests.

I would love the opportunity to discuss how we could work together to promote *Sorcery: Contested Realm* and reach a broader audience. I look forward to hearing from you and exploring how we can collaborate.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
[Your Full Name]  
FoSGamers

**Subject:** Partnership Opportunity with FoSGamers to Promote Sorcery: Contested Realm

Dear Erik and the Sorcery: Contested Realm Team,

My name is [Your Name], and I run *FoSGamers*, a growing content creation and live-streaming platform that focuses on trading card games, including *Magic: The Gathering*, *Sorcery: Contested Realm*, and more. You can find us on Whatnot (our primary selling platform), YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook. Over the past year, we have built a highly engaged community that consistently watches and interacts with our live streams and content.

Since discovering Sorcery, I’ve become a huge fan of its gameplay and beautiful hand-painted art. I’ve supported the game through my streams and have introduced new players to Sorcery, which I believe has tremendous potential.

Our platform regularly attracts significant viewership, with our top 10 live streams ranging from 8.2K to 12K viewers. These figures do not account for the additional audience from shorts and other video content, which further increases the exposure your game could receive through our platform. We have consistently seen strong viewer engagement, especially during special events and giveaways, where viewership often spikes.

Given the overlap between our audience and the high appreciation for traditional fantasy art that Sorcery embodies, I believe this could be a mutually beneficial partnership. I would love the opportunity to help further promote *Sorcery: Contested Realm* through featured streams, giveaways, or collaborative events that align with your release schedule or marketing initiatives.

If you’re open to exploring a potential partnership, I’d be thrilled to discuss how we can work together to amplify Sorcery’s reach.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,

[2024-09-05 16:33:02] FoSGamers:
Make sure you point out that the viewings is on YouTube for the large amount of them and I also do a large amount of viewings obviously on WhatNot. Let them know that I have on YouTube over almost 1.1 thousand subscribers with regular people that come in and chat and hang out in all the live streams and then also on WhatNot I have 4,000 followers where I have just as many people that are in there on a regular basis. So on both of them I have anywhere on YouTube I have anywhere from 10 to 200 people in there at once. Well, I think 150 was my high actually. That might be 150 and then on WhatNot I've had up to about 75 I think as my high on there before. So I mean actually might be 60 in there. 65 is a high. But either way I need you to add that stuff kind of the email. I want you to spice it up make it so that they really want to participate with me. Search the internet, figure out if that stuff's good to be adding in there.

Our top 10 live streams attract between **8.2K and 12K total views**, and we further expand our engagement through YouTube shorts and other video content. These breaks and openings not only entertain but also introduce new games like *Sorcery* to my audience.

On **Whatnot**, we have a dedicated following of **4,000**, with live streams typically engaging **10 to 50 concurrent viewers**, peaking at **70 viewers** during major events. Whatnot is our primary selling platform, but it’s also a space where we build community, host giveaways, and introduce new games like *Sorcery* through similar break events.

Since discovering *Sorcery: Contested Realm*, I’ve been a strong advocate for the game, promoting its unique gameplay and stunning artwork during streams. I’ve even brought new players on board, who were drawn in by the game’s traditional fantasy art and innovative mechanics. I believe there’s tremendous potential for *Sorcery* to grow even more with the right exposure, and I would love to work with you in making that happen.

Given the overlap between *Sorcery's* artistic appeal and my community's interests, I believe a partnership would be highly beneficial for both of us. I would love to discuss ways we can collaborate on promotions, giveaways, or special events tied to your upcoming releases.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you!

We also do community events where we do live streaming of our games that we play on YouTube. We're trying to get some sorcery games together to play. It has been primarily Magic the Gathering right now, but with some assistance maybe from you and others, we could get some of the large community of us playing online. That would be nice.

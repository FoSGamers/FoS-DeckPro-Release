[00:08:15] Fountain

[00:08:20] sure I'm saying it right for I don't
[00:08:21] know if I'm saying it right based on
[00:08:23] Magic and how sometimes they say things
[00:08:25] different but there was a TV show that I
[00:08:27] watched uh that what still watch it
[00:08:29] actually on a regular basis go back to
[00:08:31] it every now and again it's called
[00:08:33] Stargate and it's all and they uh they
[00:08:35] had they had episodes where it was like
[00:08:37] they were saying about how all hallowed
[00:08:38] are the Ori so that's why I call say
[00:08:43] hallowed cabal coffers or stronghold I
[00:08:46] do not C camera keeps zooming in and

[00:09:11] that all right maybe that fixed it a
[00:09:14] little bit so let me try adjusting it

[00:16:02] here that and we have our gnomes gby
[00:16:06] here it's an interesting idea
[00:16:08] interesting concept see I've never
[00:16:09] thought of that and I like when you guys
[00:16:11] come in and give me the ideas because I
[00:16:13] don't think of everything myself you
[00:16:14] know you know I am pretty smart but I
[00:16:17] understand that even being pretty smart
[00:16:18] you you need help from
[00:16:20] others thank you gnomes and that's one
[00:16:22] of the things that I feel like some
[00:16:24] people when they realize they're not
[00:16:25] when they think they're extremely smart
[00:16:27] but they don't realize they need help
[00:16:29] from others in things means they are not
[00:16:31] as smart as they think they are if that
[00:16:33] makes any sense I don't
[00:16:37] know it would be pretty funny if you win
[00:16:40] I will say that I've seen that I've seen
[00:16:42] it before though on other streams where

[00:22:50] get to the next one oh
[00:22:52] nice blood Letter
[00:22:54] vot that's a nice hit that's an awesome
[00:22:57] hit out of a draft booster sweet card
[00:23:01] then you got yourself a forest and
[00:23:03] you're kind of well you got a throwaway
[00:23:05] card so you got to throwaway and with
[00:23:06] that throw away you got yourself a blood
[00:23:09] letter that was a definitely a good
[00:23:11] draft
[00:23:12] pack yeah the great ginch that was
[00:23:15] awesome that's a top loader worthy draft
[00:23:18] pack you don't get many of
[00:23:22] those you're late again
[00:23:24] Freddy you didn't make it in on time no
[00:23:27] one's for actually no one's pressed the
[00:23:28] red button yet so you're not quite
[00:23:31] late I I'm sorry guys I got if you see
[00:23:34] Cuts all over my hands that's because I
[00:23:36] went fishing yesterday and I fish with
[00:23:37] children and when you say don't pull on
[00:23:40] the rod that means rip the rod and
[00:23:42] [ __ ] hook your
[00:23:48] hand $12 car I know that's a sweet pull
[00:23:53] there let's get that over there so
[00:23:56] what's the difference on packs how you
[00:23:58] better shots better cards out of them
[00:24:00] well it depends on what you're looking
[00:24:01] for like if you're looking to just kind
[00:24:02] of play um drafts are great or the play
[00:24:06] boosters the new play boosters because
[00:24:08] it will give you a bunch of different
[00:24:09] kinds all over the place if you're
[00:24:11] looking to like collect and get certain
[00:24:13] type of cards where you want like high
[00:24:15] value card potential um that's where you
[00:24:18] would want to go like collector boosters
[00:24:20] or set set
[00:24:25] boosters no that gives you higher
[00:24:28] chances of getting like um foil cards or
[00:24:31] uh mythics and rares and stuff like that
[00:24:33] if you get set boosters then if
[00:24:35] collector boosters are more of an
[00:24:39] opportunity yes definitely if you're
[00:24:42] going to play and you're going to jump
[00:24:44] in a commander get get find something
[00:24:46] that you're interested in some type of
[00:24:48] deck that's intriguing to you and buy a
[00:24:50] preconstructed one like I mean we have a
[00:24:52] few a couple of them that are here from
[00:24:54] um the most recent set the m at Carlo
[00:24:56] Manor you go great
[00:25:00] ginch yeah like um like I even play so
[00:25:04] like I buy things like these on a
[00:25:06] regular basis myself and for family like
[00:25:09] these are like a commander deck that's a
[00:25:10] pre-con deck um this should be in the
[00:25:13] buy now by the way and if it isn't I'm
[00:25:14] sorry I can definitely put it in there
[00:25:16] whatnot doesn't always copy everything
[00:25:18] overright but um these are
[00:25:20] preconstructed decks 100 cards plus uh
[00:25:23] like like some of the stuff that you
[00:25:24] would need to play Commander with which
[00:25:26] is nice um and you always get to you can
[00:25:29] actually play like go to a match to a
[00:25:31] store and kind of sit down and play you
[00:25:33] may not win but you can sit down and
[00:25:37] play yes exactly there are a lot of very
[00:25:40] good and balanced preons like uh my
[00:25:42] family put it this way my family and I
[00:25:45] um we bought the preons for Exelon and I
[00:25:47] got the velocir Ranter deck I went to
[00:25:50] the the the game store around us to play
[00:25:53] and I just brought that precon deck with
[00:25:54] us I didn't do anything other than use
[00:25:56] that precon deck deck um and I ended up
[00:26:00] having every all three people with their
[00:26:02] Decks that they pre-built they built
[00:26:03] themselves on the T at the table ended
[00:26:05] up ganging up against me on turn three
[00:26:08] I'm like what the hell like this is a
[00:26:09] pre-con deck I was like I haven't even
[00:26:10] done anything to this but they all
[00:26:12] ganged up on me to make sure because I
[00:26:15] was like coming out with some big
[00:26:17] hits yeah the pyate precon is real good
[00:26:20] too the py precon is real good too with
[00:26:23] the plus one plus ones or like a sliver
[00:26:24] deck type thing people get like like
[00:26:27] those ones people don't like playing
[00:26:28] slivers though they don't like when you
[00:26:29] play it but they're nice and easy and
[00:26:31] they're um they're good to get up to

[00:38:05] don't even do certain stuff anymore I
[00:38:07] know we have our boat and everything but
[00:38:08] I've been um like we've stopped even
[00:38:10] eating out we've stopped doing all kinds
[00:38:11] of stuff just because like all right I
[00:38:13] want to use a boat instead of having to
[00:38:14] do that stuff when previously I was able
[00:38:17] to eat out like you know couple times a
[00:38:18] week and stuff the kids we'd be able to
[00:38:21] go and have like not that's like eat out
[00:38:22] and have a meal sit down meal but we
[00:38:24] could go and like hey let's grab a chick
[00:38:26] play on the way home from swim practice
[00:38:29] or something like that you know not
[00:38:31] anymore we're just like screw that

[00:38:46] sometimes but it's like it used to be
[00:38:47] like six is it worth it

[00:52:49] Giant's not great
[00:52:53] but that's one of the the only only
[00:52:55] things
[00:52:56] about packs that you can't help is what
[00:53:00] comes out of them I can at least help
[00:53:02] sometimes with what that happens like
[00:53:03] with pole boxes and stuff if I don't
[00:53:05] like what occurs but when it comes to
[00:53:07] packs I can't do anything I can't really
[00:53:09] do anything there but sometimes you get
[00:53:11] that fire luck and I said it I said it I
[00:53:13] said that one word that I try not to
[00:53:14] that really good luck where the kids
[00:53:17] just like which in insane what happened
[00:53:19] where did I lost no we're good I didn't
[00:53:21] lose anything all
[00:53:24] righty
[00:53:25] all right corrosives so I have a lot of
[00:53:28] different things that we sell here um
[00:53:31] I'm going to open this up for wer since
[00:53:33] he won and I'll explain like I have if
[00:53:35] you look at my buy now all those packs I
[00:53:37] have available and one of the things
[00:53:38] that I like to do on a regular basis is
[00:53:40] I do like three pack deals because um
[00:53:44] yes ex actually always a chance because
[00:53:46] what happens is um with whatnot fees if
[00:53:49] I do like three packs at a time I pack
[00:53:51] the savings on and I'm able to drop the
[00:53:53] price down a little bit tell help out um
[00:53:56] and then we have also our red button
[00:53:59] here which has some cool animations with
[00:54:01] it one two 3 four five six and seven
[00:54:05] which is the play boosters because this

[01:05:24] choices I I missed I'm I'm not following
[01:05:26] that though I'm
[01:05:30] sorry oh not bad not bad on the choice
[01:05:34] yeah not bad I mean every card is like
[01:05:36] generally it's 10 cents or above there's
[01:05:38] a lot of them that are pretty low but
[01:05:40] that's why I say it's the red button you
[01:05:41] don't want to press the red button but
[01:05:42] everybody likes to try it everybody
[01:05:44] likes to try it and shoot the
[01:05:47] missiles everybody likes to fire
[01:05:49] missiles it's like one of those things
[01:05:50] it's there and you're like oh missiles I
[01:05:52] want to fire missiles
[01:06:02] oh yeah yeah yeah yeah I know there is
[01:06:05] some weight in the choices there is some
[01:06:07] weight in the choices a little bit there
[01:06:09] but you know uh that's why I only do
[01:06:11] them as like a dollar on them that's why
[01:06:14] I only do it for a dollar I was actually
[01:06:16] thinking they would be like an add-on
[01:06:18] like kind of like what you did here it
[01:06:19] added on to like buying something but
[01:06:21] some people ended up coming in and
[01:06:22] buying one at a time or like buying like
[01:06:24] 10 at a time and stuff which I thought
[01:06:26] was weird I never thought to do that
[01:06:28] that wasn't like a it wasn't a thing
[01:06:30] that I thought of but other people did
[01:06:33] so I ended up thinking it was just going
[01:06:34] to be like you you'd buy a box and give
[01:06:36] me give me five of the red red buttons
[01:06:38] or something like that you know what I
[01:06:40] mean but here we go
[01:06:42] corrosive let's see what we get
[01:06:53] here
[01:06:56] I know I know that's the only thing that
[01:06:57] does stink on the that's why I said uh
[01:06:59] that game that's the one game that I
[01:07:01] don't like I didn't like a lot to I
[01:07:03] didn't like the idea of it it took me a
[01:07:04] while to come do one of them because I
[01:07:06] didn't like doing them but my wife had
[01:07:08] was like hey you know what you did want
[01:07:11] me to open this right corrosive you said
[01:07:12] open this
[01:07:14] before but um the reason why I say that
[01:07:17] is because uh she thought it was she was
[01:07:19] watching some Pokemon one and they did
[01:07:20] something like this and I made a I made
[01:07:23] a poll and was like 40 people said to do
[01:07:25] it so I was like all right fine I'll do
[01:07:28] a big hit like crazy big hit box
[01:07:32] thing all right go we're gonna I
[01:07:35] like right so we're gonna do that right
[01:07:38] now and we're gonna battle against the
[01:07:39] right and the left side got that up
[01:07:41] there for a little card there and see
[01:07:43] what happens leave those over there
[01:07:45] leave those over there let's do this
[01:07:47] we're going to start with the left side
[01:07:48] first let's see if you get any luck

[01:07:56] let's get you that

[01:08:54] I I do them like this so you um I do
[01:08:56] them back to back because I put them in
[01:08:58] top loaders to keep them uh good for
[01:09:01] shipping and the reason why I do it like
[01:09:03] that back to back is because it keeps
[01:09:05] the top loaders and everything stiffer
[01:09:08] when it comes to
[01:09:09] shipping so they don't uh
[01:09:14] Bend all right and then I'll get that

[01:39:33] me we have the great pollinating
[01:39:36] starting down here in Florida I call it
[01:39:38] the great pollination because what
[01:39:40] happens is it starts to Yellow Rain
[01:39:42] yellow outside I mean I I kid you not
[01:39:46] when I step outside my house I'll have
[01:39:48] to take a picture you know what you
[01:39:49] maybe I'll stream one time
[01:39:51] in during the stream I'll show you what
[01:39:53] I'm talking about about it about it
[01:39:54] raining
[01:39:58] yellow but here we go that's our pack
[01:40:01] deal and I'm going to end up uh
[01:40:03] scrolling through some of the singles
[01:40:04] for you guys to check out dude yes the
[01:40:07] cars M Small become yellow it is
[01:40:10] disgusting like my I um when I was um
[01:40:14] when we first moved down here like three
[01:40:17] over three years ago we stayed at my
[01:40:19] mother-in-law and father-in-law's house
[01:40:21] until our house is ready and um my truck
[01:40:25] was outside and it was a black Jeep
[01:40:28] Wrangler my black truck was yellow I
[01:40:31] took a picture of it I'll have to find
[01:40:33] it at some point it's on my phone I
[01:40:34] can't share it now because I'm using it
[01:40:36] but it was
[01:40:39] yellow a black vehicle was yellow I'm
[01:40:41] like this is insane I'm like no wonder
[01:40:43] why my allergies are going off the roof
[01:40:45] out of crazy right
[01:40:49] now but here's our single if you want
[01:40:51] any of them let me know put them out the
[01:40:52] side do name on it and then we um either
[01:40:55] T talled up at the end of the show or uh
[01:41:00] if you have to leave like myel he had
[01:41:02] had a head out earlier and we tallied up
[01:41:04] his uh singles that he wanted one of the
[01:41:06] things too is I always put the prices on
[01:41:08] them when I pull them out of a pack so
[01:41:10] the price may have changed significantly
[01:41:12] during the time frame of me pulling them
[01:41:14] out and you seeing him here now so this
[01:41:17] could be a $2 Supreme verdict or a $1
[01:41:20] Supreme verdict I don't know half the
[01:41:22] time they change so much like gold but
[01:41:24] that's why we do a pack deal the way we
[01:41:26] do am Mar this way is we put them off
[01:41:28] the side we check what they are take a
[01:41:30] look see if it's something you guys want
[01:41:32] and then we go from
[01:41:35] there but we got some more singles here
[01:41:37] to go through next if you want to see
[01:41:40] them so uh yeah dude it rains yellow and
[01:41:44] that my nose is um my nose is just
[01:41:46] bugging out right now I just can't I'm
[01:41:49] having a hard time
[01:41:51] like with the nasal drip is just
[01:41:53] continuous all right we're going to do
[01:41:54] some more from
[01:41:57] Nolan why
[01:42:03] not we'll do this old and new really
[01:42:10] old and
[01:42:14] new like 95
[01:42:19] old as in most of you weren't playing
[01:42:23] some of you weren't even playing Magic
[01:42:25] then old not most some of you I'm going
[01:42:27] to say some because I I know there is a
[01:42:30] lot of you in here that were back
[01:42:32] playing Magic around that
[01:42:35] time and we're going to do this here we
[01:42:38] going to put this up
[01:42:44] for this here as I go through the
[01:42:48] singles for you guys if you want them
[01:42:51] remember anything that I have in the buy
[01:42:53] now if you want a deal on or like a pack
[01:42:56] deal on or a combo deal on let me know
[01:42:58] because it helps me with the whatnot
[01:43:00] fees and I end up taking that savings
[01:43:03] and I pass it on to you guys oh screw
[01:43:06] you it didn't go on
[01:43:07] screen I'm getting tired of
[01:43:12] this there we go now it's going three
[01:43:15] packs on screen now one of the things
[01:43:17] that we do here is like anything that I
[01:43:18] have in the buy now or any of the packs
[01:43:20] that you see available um I can do any
[01:43:22] combo of three packs for um or like a
[01:43:26] combo of packs plus maybe a pull box and
[01:43:28] stuff because the way the way the reason
[01:43:29] I say that is because if I do multiple
[01:43:32] things at once I don't have to pay
[01:43:34] certain individual whatnot fees and that
[01:43:36] helps me and I pass all those same on to
[01:43:38] you guys with it so that's the only
[01:43:41] reason why I was saying if you guys do
[01:43:42] that I'm able to take a little bit off
[01:43:44] of everything and that's what I normally
[01:43:48] do but if you want any of these singles
[01:43:50] let me know I'll put him off the sely
[01:43:52] name on
[01:43:52] it or you can uh pick up right away if
[01:43:55] you need
[01:43:59] it and that is our pack dealer right now
[01:44:02] is play booster a modern Horizon and in
[01:44:04] homelands oh go back in the day maybe

[01:44:09] poison counters your buddies keep
[01:44:10] putting on
[01:44:11] you what do you mean what do you think

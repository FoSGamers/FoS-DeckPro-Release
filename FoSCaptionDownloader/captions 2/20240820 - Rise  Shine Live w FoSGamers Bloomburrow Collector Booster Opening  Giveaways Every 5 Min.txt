[01:31:12] we'll see what happens now this the
[01:31:13] foils of them are even cooler too
[01:31:15] because they put the full scene of
[01:31:16] everything on the back without anything
[01:31:17] written on it and the wording and all
[01:31:20] the lettering and everything is all
[01:31:21] raised that EST it's like all raised so
[01:31:24] that's why it's like these are really
[01:31:25] cool all right thank you my friend and
[01:31:27] we're going to get to opening some more
[01:31:28] cards thank you
[01:31:33] Robert those are nice
[01:31:37] ones yeah in about a month if things
[01:31:39] work out we put it off so news for those
[01:31:43] the reason why we were a all backed up
[01:31:44] yesterday like I said I got a little
[01:31:45] backed up I didn't get everything done I
[01:31:47] just made sure I got everything shipped
[01:31:48] out that need to be shipped out from the
[01:31:49] day before and um the reason for that is
[01:31:52] because we got a we got a call back from
[01:31:55] from the person one of the the broker we
[01:31:58] had met at the show we put an offering
[01:31:59] on on boat that we happen to go like a
[01:32:01] last minute to see when the other one
[01:32:03] kind of fell through because we kind of
[01:32:05] got [ __ ] around a little bit on that
[01:32:06] one well when we went to see the other
[01:32:08] one it was a very nice votee and I'm
[01:32:10] like between some of the things that she
[01:32:11] was talking about going on for the guy
[01:32:13] because he had already bought the person
[01:32:16] that um we were buying it from is a the
[01:32:19] boat was in the Cayman Islands they
[01:32:21] already have a 67 foot new C camaran
[01:32:24] brand new catamaran that is a
[01:32:26] um like A5 to7 million boat and um with
[01:32:32] that being said they wanted to get rid
[01:32:33] of this because it's been sitting on the
[01:32:35] hard for six
[01:32:38] months so with it sitting on the hard
[01:32:40] like on dock for six months so Oblivion
[01:32:42] I'm putting you with your stuff right
[01:32:43] here well it sit on Doc for six months
[01:32:45] no one really wants those things as much
[01:32:47] because no one really looks at them
[01:32:48] frequently that means no one wanted it
[01:32:49] so while I gave an offer that wasn't
[01:32:51] horrible but it was definitely low and
[01:32:53] they um they accepted
[01:32:56] it because the other thing too is if
[01:32:58] they are I used to work with bankers and
[01:33:01] some of the bankers I worked with in the
[01:33:03] um all over the world Cayman Islands
[01:33:06] Australia Japan and I'm not talking
[01:33:08] about just Bankers I'm talking about
[01:33:09] like the
[01:33:11] CEOs the presidents the the people that
[01:33:15] make decisions on how billions of
[01:33:16] dollars and trillions of dollars are
[01:33:17] traded those are the people I worked
[01:33:19] with for a little while and the people
[01:33:21] in the Cayman Islands if this guy was
[01:33:22] anything like I mean he was a bank which
[01:33:24] a lot of those are in the Cayman Island
[01:33:25] you know Bank Banks and everything I
[01:33:27] figured you know this guy's got a couple
[01:33:29] things going on in his mind he doesn't
[01:33:30] have feelings like other people do with
[01:33:31] their boats they feel like the boat
[01:33:33] should be worth more so they put the
[01:33:35] price out this guy put a price out
[01:33:37] trying to get it because that's what the
[01:33:38] price of everything was well
[01:33:39] everything's been dropping because no
[01:33:40] one's buying boats right now with that
[01:33:42] being said we put an offer in reasonable
[01:33:44] offer not horrible not Wicked low but
[01:33:47] low um reasonable for what was at the
[01:33:49] boat and um it was like 15% it was 16%
[01:33:53] less than what they wanted now
[01:33:55] mathematically you're looking at that as
[01:33:57] a person that's already spent probably
[01:33:59] 20% having it on
[01:34:01] the have a get you a CEO job click clack
[01:34:05] has 20% you know he's already had it
[01:34:07] sitting on the hard and it's been
[01:34:08] costing him probably already
[01:34:10] 20% um of what he already spent on the
[01:34:12] boat by sitting on in on hard on on the
[01:34:15] pretty on hard means um in a marina on a
[01:34:18] on on the ground it's not actually in
[01:34:20] the water he's had it repainted uh a
[01:34:23] brand new generator put in the motor has
[01:34:25] 190 hours on it uh the generator
[01:34:28] literally has two hours on it uh
[01:34:30] batteries are new from
[01:34:33] 2020
[01:34:36] 2022 and uh so there's a bunch of six
[01:34:39] brand new batteries like that that only
[01:34:41] were used for about a year because
[01:34:42] they've been sitting it's been doing
[01:34:43] nothing so what happened there was I
[01:34:45] gave an offer and I was like you know
[01:34:47] what Matt they look they look at math
[01:34:48] they don't care about feelings their
[01:34:50] feelings do not matter when they make a
[01:34:52] decision those typ people I know them
[01:34:54] I've worked with them before so I gave
[01:34:57] him a number that was like he probably
[01:34:59] really wanted to really only tolerate 10
[01:35:01] to 20% lower than what he was giving um
[01:35:06] giving there being mathematical person
[01:35:07] so I was like all right let's give him
[01:35:09] daring Wave Rider somewhere in the
[01:35:11] middle of it so we did
[01:35:12] 16% couple things I didn't want to like
[01:35:14] be too over the top show that we wanted
[01:35:16] it because thing is too if there's
[01:35:17] things come back from the survey that we
[01:35:18] need to adjust we can always try to see
[01:35:20] if we can get some money off still but
[01:35:22] he looks at it goes
[01:35:24] I have uh Pro I have like a that 67 foot
[01:35:27] boat is a $6 million
[01:35:29] boat the $350,000 boat that he was
[01:35:33] selling 15% less is not that big of a
[01:35:36] deal for him when he already spent 20%
[01:35:39] on it being where it was so he doesn't
[01:35:41] have to worry about spending that money
[01:35:43] again for any more months because
[01:35:44] somebody's GNA buy it from him on top of
[01:35:47] it so I need a giveaway going out for my
[01:35:51] friend Mr Fong what number did he give
[01:35:53] me
[01:35:56] or did you not give me a
[01:35:58] number so we get an offer in reasonable
[01:36:02] not ridiculous but
[01:36:04] reasonable and they uh they accepted it
[01:36:08] we just have to wait for uh we're
[01:36:10] waiting for the paperwork to be sent
[01:36:12] over to us so that we can finish our
[01:36:15] side of it and put it out uh and send
[01:36:18] over the money for the deposit so the
[01:36:21] verbal acceptance was yesterday they
[01:36:23] sending the paperwork over yesterday and
[01:36:25] we were just waiting for it from our
[01:36:26] person so we'll see what happens one two
[01:36:29] three four five six seven eight oh we're
[01:36:31] missing a
[01:36:32] card we have to shuffle that
[01:36:36] again one two three four five six seven
[01:36:41] eight there you go that's number eight
[01:36:43] there going out there so yeah we end
[01:36:46] lucky we may have bought really lucky
[01:36:49] there because the weird story with that
[01:36:50] was we went to see a boat a different
[01:36:53] one we went to see catamaran actually um
[01:36:55] and the catamaran when we were uh flying
[01:36:57] up when we're driving up the person that
[01:36:59] was selling the boat dropped the price
[01:37:00] to 235 like sweet so we put an offer in
[01:37:04] you know sweet wonderful that means we
[01:37:07] get a little bit cheaper well we put an
[01:37:09] offer in because that's acceptable for
[01:37:14] us no I have two things my stuff my boat
[01:37:18] was going to be I'm going be on my boat
[01:37:21] we're GNA be we're going to be sailing
[01:37:22] it
[01:37:25] but are you talking about cards if

[01:37:44] like a 35 by 15 room we're actually
[01:37:47] going be put my truck in there and other
[01:37:49] stuff too so like uh that'll be my new
[01:37:51] storage location and I actually kind of
[01:37:53] like my new

[01:37:58] other stuff that we're carrying on a

[01:38:02] there's a few places there's a little
[01:38:04] desk and everything for me on the boat

[03:01:49] where is the bloomo adventure game I
[03:01:51] forgot I had that
[03:01:54] one I had that one I'm gonna go through

[03:02:01] up oh nice hey well there you go well
[03:02:05] I'm happy about that that got you a
[03:02:06] little happier you lost UPS lost
[03:02:08] something you know what I am want I I'm
[03:02:10] hoping UPS didn't lose something of M
[03:02:12] because I'm wondering if I got all my
[03:02:14] collector booster boxes were supposed to
[03:02:15] be delivered yesterday that I bought and
[03:02:17] I bought a case of Bloom I bought two
[03:02:21] Commander Masters a couple Outlaws at
[03:02:23] Thunder
[03:02:25] Junction couple uh I think um other sets
[03:02:29] too and they didn't all come for some
[03:02:31] reason like none of the collector
[03:02:33] boosters came I'm guessing there's like
[03:02:34] a second box because it didn't even have
[03:02:35] a a packing slip in it which was
[03:02:44] weird so I'm hoping that it was like
[03:02:46] that type of mistake and it's like not
[03:02:48] that there's two boxes and UPS didn't
[03:02:50] put all of them in the container or
[03:02:51] something I don't know we'll have to

[00:00:01] Ah, is that better? Hopefully it is. I
[00:00:03] think it is. It may
[00:00:05] be. Let me know. Is that any better
[00:00:09] there?
[00:00:15] Maybe. Look at that. It seems like it's
[00:00:18] better. Nice. All right. Well, we'll see
[00:00:21] how this works here today. We'll see if
[00:00:23] it's worth it. I don't know. We'll find
[00:00:25] out. Well, today we have a we have
[00:00:28] something different for you guys.
[00:00:30] So, William said he wanted to uh have
[00:00:33] make something up having to do with
[00:00:34] this. So,
[00:00:38] he made a
[00:00:42] map that
[00:00:44] we will be encountering today. That's
[00:00:47] this one
[00:00:49] here. Oh, that's huge. Hold on. You
[00:00:52] can't see
[00:00:53] it. Hold on. Let me make it Let me make
[00:00:55] it the full size. This is this. So, so
[00:00:57] this is what uh Matt Will said he wanted
[00:01:00] to make a map for an uh an encounter or
[00:01:03] like you know a little mission or type
[00:01:04] thing. So, I figured we'll do a little
[00:01:05] boss counter today. Will be our advance
[00:01:08] or our wasteland one. Now, here uh Will
[00:01:12] made this. He says uh this is what we
[00:01:14] got. So, you guys are coming to the
[00:01:15] edge. Good morning, Vicas.
[00:01:17] I'm going to go never show you guys my
[00:01:20] natural he'll show you the drawing. We
[00:01:22] took a drawing and we made it into an AI
[00:01:24] image. He had Can we do that? take a
[00:01:25] picture and do it. I'm like, "Yeah,
[00:01:26] sure. Try it. Why not?" So, we got a a
[00:01:28] Godzilla like creature that is on Earth
[00:01:31] that you can that's helpful, but has
[00:01:33] been had a chip. That's these blue
[00:01:34] things. These are chips that are put on
[00:01:36] it. Now, that's a
[00:01:38] Kraken. That is a the It's a It's not a
[00:01:41] real one. It's a robotic one. That's a
[00:01:42] part from the alien. Now you you're they
[00:01:44] are protecting the portal to their
[00:01:46] mother ship where if you can get to it,
[00:01:49] you can go up and shut off the
[00:01:51] uh shut off the chip to help save uh the
[00:01:55] Earth. So that's what we got going on.
[00:01:57] And this is what Will made. This is our
[00:01:59] this is what his was. So not bad. Not
[00:02:02] bad for you got the the the Kraken, the
[00:02:04] ability, the mother ship, the uh blue
[00:02:06] fire breathing dragon with a robot.
[00:02:08] There you go. Not bad. They did a pretty
[00:02:10] good job with it. Hold on. We don't We
[00:02:12] haven't done any other parts yet. I
[00:02:13] haven't done We can get to those later,
[00:02:14] buddy. You're jumping ahead. You're
[00:02:16] jumping ahead. Put that Put it over
[00:02:18] there. Put it over there. All right. All
[00:02:19] right. We're jumping ahead. He He likes
[00:02:20] to jump ahead. He's excitable. He is
[00:02:23] excitable. So, anyway, that's what we
[00:02:27] got going on today. Let me get that into
[00:02:29] a
[00:02:33] um the break spots. All right. So, the
[00:02:36] way the break works um every one of the
[00:02:39] spots, it just really depends. I take
[00:02:40] all the cards. I shuffle them all up,
[00:02:42] put them into the sleeves, shuffle them
[00:02:43] all up, and I hand them out. So, it's
[00:02:45] really a snake. It goes 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2
[00:02:49] 3 4 5 6. And I just keep doing that with
[00:02:52] the cards set up and handing them out in
[00:02:54] that order until they're all gone. And
[00:02:56] then what we do after all those are
[00:02:58] gone. So, say for instance, uh, so all
[00:03:00] right, say these are, you know, 1 2 3 4
[00:03:02] 5 6 all the packs, all this, all the
[00:03:04] singles, all the cards have been handed
[00:03:06] out. All right? And everybody has their
[00:03:07] mythic rares and uncommons worth $3. Now
[00:03:11] we take all of those. We add them all up
[00:03:13] to see whatever is the biggest loser.
[00:03:15] That person will get the deck in here,
[00:03:17] which is we call the biggest loser, the
[00:03:18] one that has like the lowest value in
[00:03:20] cards. And the next one would be the
[00:03:22] second biggest loser would get the um
[00:03:24] commander um sample pack from here. So
[00:03:28] that's kind of how we do the break like
[00:03:29] that, if that makes any sense. So, we
[00:03:31] take all the open all the packs up. We
[00:03:33] shuffle up all the cards, hand them all
[00:03:35] out in um to everybody so that everybody
[00:03:39] gets um their share. Kind of like a deal
[00:03:41] and heads type thing and uh go from
[00:03:45] there. So, it's not bad. And then we do
[00:03:47] a little uh D and D like adventure where
[00:03:49] we go uh wandering around
[00:03:52] here. We already have some of our
[00:03:54] characters here. I know we have our
[00:03:56] buddy uh Big BK has been hanging in and
[00:03:59] out
[00:04:00] here. We appreciate our buddy Ess
[00:04:03] letting me know that he got his packages
[00:04:04] and his cards good. We got he pulled out
[00:04:07] the uh shattered foil twinflame tyrant.
[00:04:10] How's it going Technoblade? How's it
[00:04:12] going, my friend? He's coming in
[00:04:14] out. And let's get some of the other
[00:04:16] ones that he we had to create for
[00:04:19] him. I know I made some others. Hold on.
[00:04:22] Let's go down.
[00:04:26] Oh, hold on. Maybe they're not there.
[00:04:28] They're saved over
[00:04:32] here. They might be saving
[00:04:37] this. Ah, yes, they were. Yes, they
[00:04:40] were. Hold on. We have our
[00:04:43] uh going to download some more of
[00:04:47] them. So, we have them all.
[00:04:52] All righty.
[00:04:54] got all of our images. Will had me make
[00:04:57] some images yesterday. We we we had some
[00:05:00] fun
[00:05:01] playing. So, that being said, we had
[00:05:04] some things. Not bad, Tech Blade. How
[00:05:05] you doing, my friend today? You having a
[00:05:06] good uh Sunday morning?
[00:05:09] Show me. William, I'm going to tell you
[00:05:11] one last time. Okay. You're doing
[00:05:13] school. If I have to talk to you again
[00:05:16] about you doing school, we will have a
[00:05:19] problem.
[00:05:21] We are not doing stuff tomorrow and the
[00:05:23] next day, which is why you're doing
[00:05:25] school now, right? Yes.
[00:05:28] So, since you have tomorrow and the next
[00:05:30] day off, you have to do it today.
[00:05:33] If I want you to come down to help, I'll
[00:05:34] ask. How's that sound? Yeah. Is that
[00:05:37] acceptable? Thank you. I know you're
[00:05:39] excited, but I want to make sure you're
[00:05:41] doing your stuff you need to do. Yes.
[00:05:43] Thank you,
[00:05:44] buddy. Sorry. had
[00:05:47] a had to be an adult there.
[00:05:58] Uh,
[00:06:04] all right. There you go. I think that's
[00:06:05] what that one will be. We'll made some
[00:06:08] more and he'll come down and he can
[00:06:10] explain them in a little while. But
[00:06:11] we'll we're going to just get them out
[00:06:13] here so you can see what you might be
[00:06:15] bumping into.
[00:06:17] on the map
[00:06:19] here.
[00:06:20] Ah, look at that. That's one of those.
[00:06:23] That's one of the things you might bump
[00:06:24] into when we're on the map
[00:06:26] here. Put out uh Oh, that went
[00:06:32] away. That's how it works though. So, if
[00:06:35] you guys want to jump in on the break,
[00:06:36] play with that. We do have some of our
[00:06:38] uh our things here. We do our our
[00:06:40] giveaways. We'll run those. Why not?
[00:06:42] Whole feed. Dirk Lore Superhuman. Thanks
[00:06:44] for coming in. Blazing. Appreciate it.
[00:06:46] Green snare. I hope you're having a good
[00:06:49] one. Appreciate you all coming in,
[00:06:50] hanging out today. So, what we'll do,
[00:06:54] I'm going
[00:06:57] to try need to take more of my coffee.
[00:06:59] My throat's dry.
[00:07:04] All righty. So, we'll start one of the
[00:07:07] giveaways. Why not? We'll run one of
[00:07:08] those. But that's how we do our break
[00:07:09] today is the biggest loser one like
[00:07:12] that.
[00:07:15] And we use TCG to uh check price of
[00:07:18] everything. So you guys get most current
[00:07:21] pricing which is what is in the
[00:07:24] uh which is what is in the buy now too
[00:07:27] for any of the singles. You can actually
[00:07:29] if you want to you type packs in you'll
[00:07:31] be able to see all the packs that we
[00:07:32] have. Um type deck in you'll be able to
[00:07:35] see all the decks we have. So say for
[00:07:37] instance you don't like you you know you
[00:07:38] wanted one of the other decks that I
[00:07:40] might have available. say you're going,
[00:07:41] "Oh, I didn't know you
[00:07:44] had the um
[00:07:53] any Bloomber decks." So, we're going to
[00:07:55] run one of those. See if anybody like
[00:07:56] one of those.
[00:07:59] You got Bloomber deck, too. Even we have
[00:08:01] a handful of decks and even uh uh
[00:08:04] some other secret layer and stuff like
[00:08:07] that, too, if you'd like. But you guys
[00:08:10] get to wander through today. We have uh
[00:08:12] some of our pogs here for the We had
[00:08:14] somebody hit a big yesterday. They ran
[00:08:16] into a pirate and pirates generally have
[00:08:17] lots of lots of stuff. So they got some
[00:08:20] of the things. Big BK. They got some
[00:08:22] Pogs there. H some of our adventure.
[00:08:24] That's some of our wasteland currency is
[00:08:26] what that is. Hanging out with us. We
[00:08:28] got a couple of those on there.
[00:08:29] Hopefully you guys will have a fun time
[00:08:31] today hanging out trying the break. I'm
[00:08:34] going to run the uh let's run
[00:08:45] Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.
[00:08:54] Nothing. All right. Is the brake not set
[00:08:58] so that you can buy
[00:09:00] it? Ah, is it set as an auction? It
[00:09:03] should be able
[00:09:05] to No. Oh, was it set as an auction?
[00:09:08] Bastard. I think I did it wrong. Hold
[00:09:11] on.
[00:09:14] Ah, I did. I made a mistake. Hold on. I
[00:09:17] must correct it. No wonder why no one
[00:09:19] can get it. And I'm going like, what's
[00:09:20] going on here? Give me a minute to
[00:09:24] correct
[00:09:27] it. I did it again. It stay It goes on
[00:09:31] auction sometimes and I won't I don't
[00:09:32] want it to be on auction. So, I uh That
[00:09:36] was my mistake there.
[00:09:40] No wonder why no one's grabbing on them.
[00:09:42] Like, ah, well, that
[00:09:45] stinks. You're supposed to be able to
[00:09:47] pick your
[00:09:50] spot. All
[00:09:54] right. So, let me correct that.
[00:10:08] There we go. No wonder why it wasn't
[00:10:10] working
[00:10:13] well. You have to have them set up
[00:10:22] correctly. There we go.
[00:10:32] Uh, I don't know a ton about it, but I
[00:10:34] know enough that um I can answer some
[00:10:39] things. I'm not like a
[00:10:42] specific
[00:10:45] afficionado and I also know how to find
[00:10:47] some of the answers out. So, there we
[00:10:49] go. Ha. Now you guys can buy it if you
[00:10:52] want. I was wondering why not one was
[00:10:54] getting them. So, you get to pick your
[00:10:55] spot. You get one of these, not one of
[00:10:58] these. You get one of um the spots out
[00:11:00] of there. We take all these cards from
[00:11:03] here. We take them, we shuffle them up,
[00:11:04] all the mythics, the rares, and then
[00:11:06] uncommon. In common, that is $3 or more.
[00:11:08] We hand them out to one of all the six
[00:11:09] spots. And those that get it will
[00:11:13] um have the high like have the lowest uh
[00:11:15] like value in cards out of their spot
[00:11:18] for whatever the spot is will get the
[00:11:20] commander deck. And whoever has the
[00:11:22] second lowest value out of the out of
[00:11:23] the um singles, we use TCG will uh get
[00:11:28] the
[00:11:33] sample. Yeah, I would guess it would be
[00:11:36] I don't know if I I don't know that much
[00:11:38] myself on that that aspect, but if you
[00:11:41] have some of the original stuff from
[00:11:42] back then, yes, that would probably be
[00:11:44] worth a bit to collectors depending on
[00:11:45] the uh colle uh condition it's in.
[00:11:51] I know collectors like some interesting
[00:11:53] things. They'll like people that like
[00:11:56] their stuff buy uh spend money on
[00:11:57] things. You know what I mean? It's one
[00:11:59] of those uh you know they just they like
[00:12:01] it so they go with it. And hamburger. I
[00:12:03] like it coming in on that one. One, two,
[00:12:05] three, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
[00:12:08] 10. All right, so we do have 10 here.
[00:12:10] Let's see if the rare is in
[00:12:12] there. Yes, it's still in there. All
[00:12:14] right, so our giveaway winner was Super
[00:12:18] Human. I need a number between 1 and 10
[00:12:20] if you don't mind. Hopefully you're
[00:12:21] having a good morning, superhuman. I
[00:12:23] appreciate you coming in and hanging
[00:12:25] out. We'll get this done. And then if
[00:12:27] you guys like number seven, one, two,
[00:12:29] three, four, five, six, and seven. There
[00:12:33] you go. You've got Oh, you got repulse.
[00:12:36] That gets you a uh discount on your
[00:12:39] shipping and a little kind of like free
[00:12:41] single shipping if you want to get
[00:12:43] something from the buy now. or you get a
[00:12:46] discount on your shipping if you want to
[00:12:47] jump in on uh the
[00:12:51] break
[00:12:53] superhuman. All right, thank you my
[00:12:55] friend. Hopefully your Sunday morning is
[00:12:57] going pretty good. We're just, you know,
[00:12:59] getting ourselves up and running. We got
[00:13:00] to add another one in there so he has 10
[00:13:02] back and then get that going. Look at
[00:13:06] that. We're going to pin this so
[00:13:08] everybody sees the break. And that's
[00:13:09] what we're doing today. We take all
[00:13:10] these packs. We open them up. We take
[00:13:12] the mythics, the rares, the uncommons
[00:13:15] and commons that are $3 or more. We put
[00:13:17] them in sleeves. We shuffle them up and
[00:13:19] we hand them out to the spots. Then we
[00:13:21] see which one has the lowest value in uh
[00:13:25] cards that would get out of the spots
[00:13:26] there. So if there's six out of six
[00:13:28] spots, you see whichever has the lowest
[00:13:30] value out of those that was handed out
[00:13:32] to them. They will get the deck that's
[00:13:34] in here. And then the person that has
[00:13:36] the second lowest value gets the
[00:13:39] uh sample box. Where does it say it on
[00:13:42] it? I thought it said it on the side. H
[00:13:44] the sample. Anyways, that's what they
[00:13:49] get. So
[00:13:52] So Shrek themed. They're going to
[00:13:55] probably end up doing something like
[00:13:56] that with all the people that are
[00:13:59] uh all the different ones. I mean,
[00:14:01] they're doing what is it?
[00:14:04] Uh they're doing uh what's that one?
[00:14:07] Dang it. I'm trying to think of the name
[00:14:08] of it.
[00:14:09] Um,
[00:14:11] Spongebob. Might as well do like Shrek
[00:14:14] and all those other ones like that, too.
[00:14:16] Throw it out there.
[00:14:27] Yeah, Final Fantasy Spongebob. Exactly.
[00:14:29] You guys know what I'm talking about. I
[00:14:30] mean, if they're if they're doing it,
[00:14:31] might as well throw me in there. But
[00:14:33] they're they're going to have um I don't
[00:14:35] know, freaking Mario soon.
[00:14:40] You're going to get to go down a tube
[00:14:41] and come out the other side. Hit them
[00:14:44] from the
[00:14:58] back. Nope. The bold
[00:15:01] school car cartoon secret layer.
[00:15:07] Ah, yeah. Well, you know, the secret
[00:15:10] layer is not too bad when they do it
[00:15:12] like that cuz if you want it, you can go
[00:15:13] and get it. It's a special thing, you
[00:15:14] know. But if so, when they uh make the
[00:15:17] whole set like that, I did like how they
[00:15:18] took the Jurassic Park and they
[00:15:19] sprinkled them in to um Lost Cavern
[00:15:22] since it kind of like made a little bit
[00:15:23] of sense with their like the dinos and
[00:15:25] everything. And I think that's what they
[00:15:26] kind of should do if they're if they're
[00:15:28] going to be doing that regularly. That's
[00:15:29] what they should be doing. take their
[00:15:30] regular sets and then sprinkle in a
[00:15:34] little extra that makes sense to be
[00:15:36] sprinkled in. Like if you're doing
[00:15:38] something related
[00:15:40] to robotics, then you can sprinkle in
[00:15:44] something for mechs, you know, that type
[00:15:46] of thing. think you're doing something
[00:15:47] worth, you know, the Icoria that worked
[00:15:50] well with Godzilla. It was specifically
[00:15:52] like that kind of a realm, but
[00:15:56] still, it's like they they they need to
[00:15:59] stop making it specific to the the the
[00:16:02] type of uh game is really what it is. I
[00:16:05] think that's what they need to work on.
[00:16:15] Oh, nice. The Well, the Aldrazi That's a
[00:16:18] good precon, by the way. Yeah, the uh do
[00:16:20] all Aldrazi pack. That would be kind of
[00:16:22] funny. That would uh piss some people
[00:16:24] off and make a lot of people and a lot
[00:16:25] of people happy. So, it's like one of
[00:16:26] those like 50/50 things, but you can
[00:16:28] never make everybody happy anyways,
[00:16:29] right? It's always somebody that's going
[00:16:31] to complain about something somewhere.
[00:16:33] All right, let's see. I actually have
[00:16:35] some more of our images. Let me see if I
[00:16:38] have uh I got that one downloaded. Let's
[00:16:40] add in uh let's add in another one of my
[00:16:44] of the sources
[00:16:46] here. And this is going to
[00:16:49] be the uh what was this
[00:16:55] one? Oh, that's what it was.
[00:17:04] Why did I do it spell like that? That is
[00:17:07] absolutely horrible.
[00:17:10] All
[00:17:14] right. Oh, we're going to shrink that
[00:17:16] down. Hold on.
[00:17:19] Well, there we
[00:17:21] go. Yeah, there's some people you you'll
[00:17:24] encounter. This is uh
[00:17:26] Will's Will's map here. Where is it?
[00:17:33] Thought I put it over there.
[00:17:40] Did I not add Will's map? I thought I
[00:17:43] put it on the screen here. All right.
[00:17:44] Well, I guess I didn't. We'll do it now.
[00:17:54] See, we're playing Will's map today. He
[00:17:57] uh he designed this and uh the
[00:18:00] encounters you'll be running into for uh
[00:18:02] for our adventurers today. So um you
[00:18:05] guys got to be careful. He's got that
[00:18:08] and uh three different characters that
[00:18:11] you can run
[00:18:12] into. We're just adding those all
[00:18:15] in. Got Will's one. There we go. Got
[00:18:18] number
[00:18:20] two. There's our our last one.
[00:18:25] All right. This is his uh his map he
[00:18:30] made or his idea he came up
[00:18:33] with. So, here we go.
[00:18:38] All right. Got that out there. Make it
[00:18:40] available for when we need
[00:18:44] it. All righty. There. Well, that's what
[00:18:48] you got going on this this day here. Got
[00:18:51] some of those Will's excite. Oh, all
[00:18:53] right. You want to tell everybody what
[00:18:54] it is then? There's your alien hand to
[00:18:56] hand fighter. You may in hand to hand
[00:18:58] combat. You might be bumping into that
[00:19:00] alien there in uh any encounters here
[00:19:02] when you pick some packs up and stuff
[00:19:04] today. Or could potentially potentially
[00:19:07] a sniper you might have in the distance
[00:19:09] or maybe there's a command commander who
[00:19:13] throws grenades who throws these mir's
[00:19:15] grenades is what they're called. Yes, he
[00:19:17] helped he helped uh he uh drew the
[00:19:19] pictures. He took a picture of the
[00:19:21] pictures. He says, "Can you just draw
[00:19:22] then we take a picture and then we'll
[00:19:24] draw one?" I
[00:19:26] know.
[00:19:27] Not I didn't get to that yet.
[00:19:32] Okay, you can wait.
[00:19:35] He made some uh he drew some pictures of
[00:19:37] him and we took we took pictures of his
[00:19:39] images that he draw his uh his sketches
[00:19:41] said, "Can we do that and then have the
[00:19:43] AI make it into something?" I said, "Ah,
[00:19:45] we'll try." And I did it and it worked.
[00:19:48] Not bad. So, there you go. Those are his
[00:19:51] uh those are what he made. That's what
[00:19:53] his ideas were. And then we had some
[00:19:55] other ones for later on in the game.
[00:19:57] We'll see what happens. We have to get
[00:19:58] to those cuz we haven't had those ones
[00:19:59] in there. We had uh cuz in there they're
[00:20:03] uh the whole point of this is you are
[00:20:04] you're at the edge right here. You'll
[00:20:06] see my finger if you can see my finger.
[00:20:08] You're at the edge of the city cuz
[00:20:10] that's a city you had been wandering
[00:20:11] around in before you you know you've
[00:20:12] been wandering around a city. You got to
[00:20:14] the edge of it a couple times, saw some
[00:20:16] different places, but now you hear some
[00:20:18] ruckus and you go and you see some tanks
[00:20:20] shooting at the edge of the city and
[00:20:22] there's uh there's a Godzillaike
[00:20:24] creature that's uh got some some like
[00:20:27] looks like blue microchips on them
[00:20:29] controlling them and this robotic kraken
[00:20:32] creature that uh has come up come from
[00:20:35] somewhere to protect this portal which
[00:20:37] goes to the the mother
[00:20:40] ship up uh I guess this was a crashed
[00:20:44] crashed alien ship that uh turned into
[00:20:47] this kraken creature to protect itself
[00:20:49] until it can get back to the mother ship
[00:20:51] that's slowly coming here. And then
[00:20:53] here, this is I guess you told me we
[00:20:55] have to we were going to make this one
[00:20:57] into a map and I'm like, not now, buddy.
[00:20:58] We were getting a little over the top.
[00:21:00] We couldn't do all of it together. We
[00:21:01] got we'll do this later, though. But he
[00:21:03] here's the mother ship. We did make it
[00:21:06] for him. And then Nolan made one to go
[00:21:09] with it, too. Was a fighter. So, we'll
[00:21:11] put the mother ship in. I
[00:21:15] know. So, at some point, I guess we
[00:21:17] might be going like to outer space and
[00:21:19] doing some sci-fi
[00:21:20] stuff. Who knows? But that's uh that's
[00:21:24] Will's mother ship that we'll be getting
[00:21:27] to at some point there. Hey, Red. How's
[00:21:30] it going? I know. Long time no
[00:21:33] see. I
[00:21:35] know. Mecca versus Godzilla. I know
[00:21:38] you're back in Florida. Well, nice,
[00:21:40] buddy. How have you I couldn't Yeah, I
[00:21:42] can't remember where you went. You like
[00:21:43] you said you you had to go do some
[00:21:44] things. I can't remember exactly what.
[00:21:46] Who is it?
[00:21:48] Uh just somebody that had been um I
[00:21:51] talked to before. They were in Florida.
[00:21:52] We had met up and played cards before
[00:21:54] actually at the store. And
[00:21:58] I got a little bit of a rock here right
[00:22:00] now. Let's see if it works now. If we
[00:22:01] have an internet problem or we're still
[00:22:03] good. No. I think we might be fine.
[00:22:12] Yeah, we should meet up and play some
[00:22:13] magic. Yes. Uh, yeah, that's what it
[00:22:15] was. Alabama. That's what it was. I knew
[00:22:17] you in somewhere nearby.
[00:22:19] So, we got that was the mother ship.
[00:22:26] And then, uh, we had the, um, my son
[00:22:29] Nolan said he wanted to participate. So,
[00:22:31] he made something. He made an image.
[00:22:33] Well, he made a he made a sketch and he
[00:22:35] said that will be the alien.
[00:22:39] um fighter
[00:22:42] jet. Let's see if I can get this one to
[00:22:44] show in
[00:22:47] here. There we go. That's the alien
[00:22:49] fighter
[00:22:51] jet. Somehow that's an alien jet.
[00:22:53] Fighter jet there. So, yeah.
[00:22:57] Aha. But
[00:22:59] anyways, I know Dragons of Takar is
[00:23:02] going to be fun. My wife is actually
[00:23:03] even interested in some of the the uh
[00:23:06] decks herself. All my all my both my
[00:23:08] boys are. I am myself, too. So, you
[00:23:10] know, it's good stuff. I already brought
[00:23:12] my extra deck case. I know. My wife
[00:23:14] already grabbed her extra deck deck
[00:23:16] case. I know. It'll be fun. All those
[00:23:18] people that love dragons, it's going to
[00:23:19] be a good time. It will be a good time.
[00:23:22] So, for you guys hanging out here today,
[00:23:24] we have a break. We have foundations,
[00:23:27] Mon Horizon, Aether Drift, Collectors.
[00:23:30] We have a Commander Master the set. We
[00:23:31] have a Calaldheim draft and an Iicoria
[00:23:34] draft booster. We open all these packs
[00:23:37] up and we hand them out to the six
[00:23:39] spots. Um, and as we take because we
[00:23:42] take all the mythics, the rares, and any
[00:23:44] common and our uncommon that is $3 or
[00:23:45] more, put them in the sleeve, shuffle
[00:23:46] them up, and then we hand them out to
[00:23:48] each one of the spots one through six.
[00:23:50] After that is done, we figure out who is
[00:23:52] the biggest loser in regards to who has
[00:23:54] the lowest value of singles in the
[00:23:56] handout there. you get the deck that's
[00:23:58] here and then the person that has the
[00:24:00] second lowest gets the collector booster
[00:24:01] sample. That way you guys kind of all
[00:24:03] get the opportunity to get some uh fun
[00:24:06] things here and it's not just one
[00:24:07] person, you know, every now and again,
[00:24:09] you know, you get get a person that gets
[00:24:11] hit like yeets coming in here. He pulls
[00:24:13] out like these continuous fractured
[00:24:15] foils and you're like, "Ah crap, he gets
[00:24:17] fractured foil again. I got nothing."
[00:24:19] Well, you know what? This time you'll be
[00:24:20] able to get the deck potentially. Hey
[00:24:23] Travis, thanks for coming in hanging
[00:24:24] out.
[00:24:27] to infinity and beyond. Thank you,
[00:24:28] Barrett. I appreciate it, Travis. Yeah,
[00:24:30] we're having a good time. So, we got a
[00:24:33] and then so but today our
[00:24:36] our map for our uh
[00:24:40] encounter for the biggest loser break
[00:24:43] here is going to be one of those. That's
[00:24:46] our map. You're going to have to go
[00:24:47] through that for a little bit here.
[00:24:49] That's what we're wandering through
[00:24:50] today. So, the uh the Wasteland
[00:24:52] Adventure is at the edge of the city and
[00:24:55] they see this uh this battle going
[00:24:58] on. They're going to decide, are you
[00:25:00] guys going to go and help? Are you going
[00:25:02] to sit on the end there? Now, for those
[00:25:04] of you if you do jelly in the break, I
[00:25:06] do I do appreciate it. My friend jumped
[00:25:08] in the break, Hanburger. You if you um
[00:25:10] for whatever reason the break doesn't
[00:25:12] go, what we do is we give you an option
[00:25:14] of a pack or similar value of equivalent
[00:25:17] value. Um, I'll give some options and
[00:25:19] give you or multiple packs or something
[00:25:21] like that. And that's what we do for
[00:25:22] you. Um, but hopefully while we're
[00:25:25] hanging out here this morning, we can
[00:25:27] get this closed out here and see and uh
[00:25:30] set up because it is a good set of good
[00:25:32] bunch of cards here. You know what we
[00:25:34] should do here is I mean Foundations is
[00:25:39] big hitting big
[00:25:41] recently. We've got
[00:25:44] a Let's see. Let's do this here. I have
[00:25:49] this. We're gonna take this
[00:25:53] here. All right. While we're waiting,
[00:25:56] we're going to take this here. I've been
[00:25:58] saving them up while we uh do our
[00:26:01] things. This is from a collector or I
[00:26:05] don't or a play booster. I don't know
[00:26:06] which one is. If does anybody know how
[00:26:08] to tell if it comes from a play booster
[00:26:09] or collector booster or if they're all
[00:26:10] the same? If somebody can tell me that,
[00:26:13] I'd greatly appreciate that. But I don't
[00:26:14] know because they always look the same
[00:26:16] to me and I pulled a few of them out of
[00:26:19] between play boosters and collectors and
[00:26:20] I don't know which ones I pulled out
[00:26:22] from which cuz they're all the same.
[00:26:24] They all look the
[00:26:26] same. Should all be the same. All right.
[00:26:28] All right. Rip Rhino. So this is what
[00:26:29] I'm going to do. I've been saving the to
[00:26:30] do this every now and again. I'm going
[00:26:32] to take this one. We're going to go like
[00:26:34] this. We're going to zoom
[00:26:36] in. I'm going go like this. Ah.
[00:26:40] All right. We're gonna

[00:28:04] auction. And we're going to see what we
[00:28:06] get. I'm going to throw this on here to
[00:28:09] start it since we have a few of you
[00:28:11] all. Let's run one of these first. Pull
[00:28:14] a few people in to see if they want to
[00:28:16] try and take a drink of the Oh no, I
[00:28:19] drank my coffee again. I'm going to have
[00:28:22] to go get more. Good thing I started a
[00:28:28] giveaway. All right. So, what I'm going
[00:28:30] to do
[00:28:35] then pin that
[00:28:38] We're going to start it for
[00:28:43] this. Yeah.
[00:28:48] Here. And then we're going to run
[00:28:52] this for we'll

[00:29:20] giveaway running. Aether drift box
[00:29:23] topper and then you get to take over the
[00:29:25] character and wander around the city for
[00:29:27] a bit before we get to
[00:29:30] uh the end of it where we have our boss
[00:29:33] encounter. We'll do that for a second.
[00:29:36] Well, you go. All righty.
[00:29:45] Hey, now remember
[00:30:00] third cup is always
[00:30:04] smaller. Yeah, that's why I always
[00:30:07] forget about having last cup being a
[00:30:09] little small.
[00:30:14] That's fine.
[00:30:30] It's in the bowl.
[00:30:34] I'm going to need a big white basketball
[00:30:36] for breakfast.
[00:30:38] Yes, sir.

[00:30:43] organize a little
[00:30:50] better. You need

[00:32:46] There you go. Well, the only one in here
[00:32:48] that wanted to jump in on anything, I

[00:33:38] enters a one one green insect
[00:33:41] creature token for each artifact and or
[00:33:44] creature card in your
[00:33:46] graveyard, whenever another insect you
[00:33:49] control dies, put a one counter on a
[00:33:51] check. Each opponent loses one life.
[00:33:53] That's a nice card there. I like the
[00:33:55] land, too. I like that land, too.
[00:33:58] Beautiful. There you go. Nice gold ones.
[00:34:00] I know somebody said they were trying to

[00:34:05] I'm going to try. You're very, very
[00:34:08] welcome, my friend. So, let me get that
[00:34:10] with your name written down on it and

[00:34:15] that we can
[00:34:16] uh see it all for you.
[00:34:21] Hanburg Burger.
[00:34:24] My son loves hamburgers.
[00:34:27] It's like his favorite
[00:34:30] meal. If he can have a hamburger every
[00:34:33] single
[00:34:34] day, he would.
[00:34:38] That's the type of uh I had a friend
[00:34:41] that ate. The only thing that they ate
[00:34:43] was uh
[00:34:44] pizza, hot dogs, and cereal for
[00:34:48] like 10
[00:34:51] years. At least if I remember when I was
[00:34:54] growing up, he was a friend of mine from
[00:34:56] the camp that we used to go to and very
[00:34:58] nice family who just I was like,
[00:35:00] "Really?" You know, that's all you eat?
[00:35:01] Like, yeah, that's it. Like every time
[00:35:02] they had a meal, his mom would make a
[00:35:04] hot dog or a hamburger for him. I mean,
[00:35:06] a hot dog. Hot dog or a um or he'd get
[00:35:10] pizza from somewhere. Um or because like
[00:35:13] they had like leftover pizza from like
[00:35:15] the last time they got it from wherever.
[00:35:17] Yeah, whatever. But hey,
[00:35:21] they liked it. Let me get to you over
[00:35:22] here with your name on that. Nice one,
[00:35:24] my friend. Han,
[00:35:26] that was a nice one. I like it. So,

[00:35:31] spots. We have our our giveaway winner
[00:35:32] went to Arantos. Need a number between
[00:35:34] one and 10. One, two, three. I have all
[00:35:36] 10 here. Cuz that way we can know what
[00:35:38] we're going to give you. Arantos. Am I
[00:35:41] saying that right?
[00:35:42] Arantos. And then hopefully we can get
[00:35:44] our break going. That way we can uh you
[00:35:46] know get to our our bosses today and see
[00:35:48] what happens. If you're able to sneak
[00:35:50] Are you going to sneak by? You going to
[00:35:52] direct attack? How you going to handle
[00:35:54] it? Cuz Will we the Will what he said
[00:35:56] was we have at the end of the city we've
[00:35:58] been wandering through is a group of
[00:36:01] people fighting and then all of a sudden
[00:36:03] you notice there was a Godzilla like
[00:36:05] creature and then there was a uh giant
[00:36:09] kraken mech mechanized kraken there and
[00:36:11] he's like trying to figure out what's
[00:36:12] going on because there's a giant portal
[00:36:14] in the middle. Godzilla seems to be
[00:36:16] protecting the portal with the Kraken in
[00:36:18] the
[00:36:18] background. Now, there's a blue chip, I
[00:36:21] guess, on him. That thing is uh controls
[00:36:23] them. So, maybe there's a way for you
[00:36:24] guys to I mean, take it off or stop it.
[00:36:26] So, that way you can
[00:36:28] um get in there. I don't know. Figure
[00:36:31] out what to do. But this is uh this is
[00:36:33] the the the little adventure we have
[00:36:34] today. We have even some of the
[00:36:36] characters will made these. So, your
[00:36:38] adventure may by bumping
[00:36:40] into the uh hand to hand combat alien
[00:36:43] that you might see. You may see a sniper
[00:36:45] alien at some point somewhere or
[00:36:47] potentially a uh alien that throws uh
[00:36:51] Mir's grenades is what they call he's
[00:36:52] calling
[00:36:54] them. So, there you go, my friend. You
[00:36:57] guys want to hang out with us? There is
[00:36:59] the break. We'll
[00:37:00] uh we'll run of them like one of them
[00:37:03] like this.
[00:37:06] Let's run one of them like this. See if
[00:37:09] anybody wants to try it
[00:37:11] there. The break today, we call them a
[00:37:13] biggest loser break because the way I do
[00:37:14] it is we do like we always do is kind of
[00:37:16] like um dealing hits where you hand out
[00:37:19] the hits from the all these collector
[00:37:23] these collector packs this commander
[00:37:24] masses set and then to uh draft here and
[00:37:27] these um all the mythics the rares and
[00:37:29] any uncommon or common that is over $3
[00:37:31] or more. Mythic rares, all of them, and
[00:37:33] any uncommon or common $3 or more get
[00:37:35] put in his sleeves, shuffled up, and
[00:37:37] then we hand them out to the six spots.
[00:37:40] And whoever gets the lowest value,
[00:37:42] monetary value out of the rares,
[00:37:44] commons, and uncommon things there will
[00:37:46] get the deck in here, and whoever gets
[00:37:48] the second lowest gets the collector
[00:37:50] booster. So, that's how that kind of
[00:37:52] goes there. That way you don't have to
[00:37:54] you don't feel too bad about being
[00:37:58] the one that gets nothing out of uh all
[00:38:00] the cards or something like that, you
[00:38:01] know,
[00:38:05] cuz that's generally me. So that way you
[00:38:08] at least get generally you either get
[00:38:09] the hit or you get the lower or if you
[00:38:12] have something in between you're like
[00:38:13] okay with it, you know, makes it a
[00:38:16] little bit better.
[00:38:20] I don't know. Let me know what you guys
[00:38:21] like to do. We'll try it out there. We
[00:38:23] have that pinned. We have lots of cards
[00:38:25] in the singles here. We're waiting on
[00:38:28] some uh hanging out with some of you
[00:38:30] guys. That's what you got going on our
[00:38:31] adventure today. You went to the edge of
[00:38:33] the city and you saw something going on
[00:38:37] and you need to let me know what we're

[00:41:19] something fun here while we're waiting.

[00:43:08] Oh, all right. Doing some hunting.
[00:43:15] It doesn't seem like
[00:43:30] it. Well, it's going slow today. So, I
[00:43:33] was going to try to put the dice on
[00:43:34] screen, but I can't remember. I lost the
[00:43:36] video link that I used. I can go back
[00:43:40] and look at it.
[00:43:51] Um, trying to think of what it
[00:43:54] was. I can't remember which one it was.
[00:43:57] So, let's see if I can
[00:43:59] find it. Was going to show
[00:44:03] me here.
[00:44:15] No,
[00:44:17] it's not going to.
[00:44:27] No, it won't.

[00:44:41] you
[00:44:44] all. All right, there we
[00:44:47] go. No, I don't think so. How many days

[00:45:14] it.
[00:45:15] Do your work. Are you done? Uh, and it
[00:45:19] is the foil version. If you look in it,
[00:45:21] it does say foil.

[00:45:30] fun. Chuck-E-Cheese. Hey, well, at least

[00:46:19] loader. That way we can get it out for
[00:46:20] you. Arantos.
[00:46:29] 1911.
[00:46:31] Hey, Frank. Hey, Frank. How's it going?
[00:46:34] Hey, we can
[00:46:36] uh do something a little like I said
[00:46:38] after I'll send you a
[00:46:43] message when I'm
[00:46:46] done. Not a
[00:46:48] problem. Yeah, if you if you um it says
[00:46:50] it right in the in the description. And
[00:46:52] that's why I I try to put as much
[00:46:53] information in it as possible so you
[00:46:55] know what it is.
[00:46:58] All right, cool. Sounds
[00:47:00] good. Yeah, we got to go and do that
[00:47:02] today ourselves.
[00:47:06] And in a and a run to Walmart. Yeah,
[00:47:09] that's also what we got to do.
[00:47:15] Yes, we can go fishing again.
[00:47:21] Why is this not working? The wife wants
[00:47:23] to fish. Wife wants to fish.
[00:47:30] All right. How do we get it to go here?
[00:47:33] Aha. I think I got it.
[00:47:43] Now what I said and where I said what?
[00:47:49] Come here now.
[00:47:56] Okay.
[00:47:58] And do
[00:48:10] this. All right. Here we go. So, let's
[00:48:13] try this.
[00:48:39] I'll see if I can get it to work at all.
[00:48:44] Yeah, I am firm. I'm pretty firm with
[00:48:46] the prices just being I do it all
[00:48:48] through um like I said, so I take it all
[00:48:50] from um TCG player. So I try to stay
[00:48:52] with that if you want them. That's why I
[00:48:54] I try to stay pretty straightforward in
[00:48:56] those.
[00:49:01] We are in more East Coast uh superhuman.
[00:49:03] Um do you know where um like Daytona and
[00:49:08] stuff is? We're around that area.
[00:49:11] No, not a problem. fake them. Yeah, we
[00:49:13] got a I like I said, I got a a good
[00:49:14] chunk of them.
[00:49:16] Um they're all set to the price from
[00:49:19] TCG. So, that is uh why I have them set
[00:49:23] the way they are. Um if I have to, I may
[00:49:25] go and adjust every now and again. Like,
[00:49:27] I might go through tomorrow. Generally,
[00:49:28] at the beginning of the week, I'll go
[00:49:29] through every now. Ah, yeah, that is
[00:49:32] pretty fun. I haven't been there.
[00:49:34] Yeah, sure. I can show you.
[00:49:46] You go here. Let me do this though.
[00:49:47] Actually,
[00:49:48] here. Let me do this so you can see
[00:49:53] it. All right. Now, I'll do that. Now, I
[00:49:56] don't want to take it out of there cuz I
[00:49:58] try to keep it as clean as possible and
[00:49:59] that without me touching it, you know,
[00:50:01] not oil's on there with that foil. And
[00:50:03] there you go. You can see kind of the uh
[00:50:07] the car there.
[00:50:11] There you go.
[00:50:15] There. So, you can see the back to
[00:50:17] basics. Yeah, not a problem. If you
[00:50:20] want, I can take it out. I'll take it
[00:50:21] out of there if you really want me to so
[00:50:22] you can look at it and like uh put some
[00:50:25] my put my hand behind it if you really
[00:50:27] want to take a look at everywhere. But I
[00:50:28] uh just let me know. I I generally try
[00:50:30] not to as much with the foils just
[00:50:32] because, you know, grease and everything
[00:50:33] with the foils. And I I keep my hands
[00:50:35] clean, but you know, oils are on
[00:50:37] everybody's
[00:50:40] fingers. So that's what Yeah, we got
[00:50:42] some of those. Well, there you go. Let's
[00:50:45] go with that for you, my friend. I like
[00:50:47] it. We're going to do that. There you
[00:50:50] go, Jacobs. And I'm going to write your
[00:50:52] name on the back of that. They
[00:50:53] appreciate you coming in, my friend, and
[00:50:55] picking that
[00:50:59] up. Yeah. And remember, if you don't
[00:51:01] ask, you don't know. So like it's not I
[00:51:02] don't have a problem with people being
[00:51:04] respectful and asking questions. So and
[00:51:06] or asking about something. I have no
[00:51:08] problem with that. So no and I
[00:51:08] appreciate you coming in Jacobs and
[00:51:10] picking that up. Thank you very much. So
[00:51:13] like that some of them people in life
[00:51:15] people always like get some people get
[00:51:16] annoyed when somebody asks questions
[00:51:18] like well you know depends on how
[00:51:19] they're asking. If they're being
[00:51:20] appropriate and respectful then you
[00:51:23] shouldn't be having too much of a
[00:51:24] problem unless you're like you know not
[00:51:25] the right time or place. But at the same
[00:51:27] time
[00:51:29] um if
[00:51:30] they're
[00:51:32] like not you they're willing you can
[00:51:34] easily tell them to go eat piss off. So
[00:51:37] you know they need to be respectful
[00:51:39] understanding of timing too. You know
[00:51:41] this is what we got today for the break
[00:51:43] here. I'm going keep moving these around
[00:51:46] because um want to show you guys what we
[00:51:48] got. All of that's in the brake today. I
[00:51:50] think you should should be able to see
[00:51:51] it because I bump the camera and I
[00:51:52] adjust every now and again. So, I have
[00:51:54] to go back into
[00:51:56] it. So, yeah, we got those hanging out
[00:51:59] here today. Hopefully, we're having a
[00:52:00] good one. We'll do a a little bit of
[00:52:01] that. Let's see what we can get on here,
[00:52:04] though. If we can get the
[00:52:06] uh roll to
[00:52:26] work. All right, we'll try
[00:52:29] this here.
[00:52:35] We can go like
[00:52:37] so. I'm going to
[00:52:39] try that.
[00:52:42] That instead we're going to
[00:52:54] go like that. All right. So, we're going
[00:52:56] to adjust that. We're going to do this.
[00:52:57] We're going to do that.
[00:53:14] See if that will work.
[00:53:29] made that go away right now.
[00:53:49] Yes.
[00:54:01] Okay. See if this will
[00:54:05] work. H I'm trying some different things
[00:54:08] here.
[00:54:28] Okay.
[00:54:44] Well, we'll see what happens.
[00:55:05] interact with it. Damn it. I hate when
[00:55:06] it does
[00:55:20] that. I'm learning here.
[00:55:25] At least trying to probably getting it
[00:55:29] wrong. Absolutely
[00:55:38] wrong.
[00:55:43] Aha. I know what I did wrong.
[00:56:13] Okay. Ah, there we
[00:56:17] go. We got it to work.
[00:56:21] Look at
[00:56:26] that. Took me a second there. Oh, we
[00:56:28] have oncreen dice
[00:56:31] now. That's pretty sweet. So, I don't
[00:56:34] even need to roll them anymore. I got to
[00:56:35] get it set up so we can just go
[00:56:38] boom. Uhoh. Hold on. We got to reset it
[00:56:41] every time. Didn't reset.
[00:56:54] Nothing. All right. Well, we got another
[00:56:57] one there. You just keep rolling
[00:57:01] them as
[00:57:04] needed. No, I don't need the equals. How
[00:57:06] do I get rid of the
[00:57:09] equals? I'm going have to figure that
[00:57:10] one out.
[00:57:36] Well, we get the added them
[00:57:41] together. Uh, no, no Magic Con this year
[00:57:44] with the stuff we got going on.
[00:57:45] Hamburger. All right, let me take a look
[00:57:48] quickly. All right, so we got the dice
[00:57:50] on screen. And I got to work on getting
[00:57:51] the uh the the promo background better.
[00:57:54] Let's see what we got for our message. I
[00:57:57] can check using my
[00:57:59] phone. All right, let's take a look
[00:58:01] here.
[00:58:10] Messages. Yeah, we can do that. Yeah,
[00:58:12] perfect. That's what I pretty much what
[00:58:13] I was going to say was uh what I do is
[00:58:15] if the brake doesn't go, I allow you to
[00:58:16] get packs or something from the store
[00:58:18] that is worth a value.
[00:58:19] So, I'm good with that. And I can only
[00:58:21] do this cuz I broke this finger. So, now
[00:58:23] I can only do the hang 10. All right.
[00:58:26] Let's see if we can figure out what the
[00:58:27] uh the background source is here. So,
[00:58:29] let's get rid of that. All right.
[00:58:34] Chroma X is that. Let's see if
[00:58:52] we That's those ones.
[00:59:06] dice. H I got to figure out the
[00:59:09] background. I know what to do. Here we
[00:59:12] go. We do
[00:59:15] this. All right. And go and go
[00:59:20] here. And we're going to
[00:59:23] do Where is
[00:59:25] it? I think this is what I can do.
[00:59:30] Chroma. Um
[00:59:33] custom
[00:59:36] select this
[00:59:44] color.
[00:59:46] Nope. Nope. Come on
[00:59:50] now. Oh, there it is. It's not going to
[00:59:52] let me see it for some reason. Ah,
[00:59:54] behind the window. Oh, you're being a
[00:59:57] pain in the bum.
[01:00:06] All
[01:00:15] right. Okay. Let's try this
[01:00:21] now. Aren't they working?
[01:00:41] All
[01:00:41] right, let's redo this.
[01:01:18] It's interesting. It doesn't want to
[01:01:19] work now.
[01:01:23] Huh. That's
[01:01:26] weird. Doesn't like me
[01:01:37] anymore. Ah, damn it. I had it working.
[01:01:40] No, it doesn't want to.
[01:01:54] [Music]
[01:01:59] All right, let's do
[01:02:03] this. I'm going to do
[01:02:07] this. Do that because we have an idea of
[01:02:09] it now.
[01:02:16] See if that
[01:02:20] works. Make it
[01:02:23] invisible. Do
[01:02:35] this.
[01:02:38] Refresh.
[01:02:40] Okay, so they work.
[01:02:47] Okay. All right, that works as I want.
[01:02:53] Perfect. Just like I
[01:02:59] like. All right, we got some on screen
[01:03:01] dice. This is what we were trying to
[01:03:02] work with. Get some different things set
[01:03:06] up. All
[01:03:08] right. Right. That's in the middle.
[01:03:11] It's in the middle. Now, let's try
[01:03:16] this one more time
[01:03:37] here. All right. See if it this works
[01:03:42] now. No. Why does it do that? All right.
[01:03:45] I don't like that. Has something to do
[01:03:47] with the chroma key. All
[01:03:53] right. Well, we are going to go with
[01:03:57] green
[01:04:00] again.
[01:04:02] Okay. And do a little
[01:04:06] roll. Well,
[01:04:10] there. Perfect. We got to make it
[01:04:15] uh do that again. Adjust the color a
[01:04:18] little bit.
[01:04:24] There we go.
[01:04:35] Let's try that. The color is a little
[01:04:37] better. Oh, no.
[01:04:52] There we go.
[01:04:55] Ha. We have dice that roll on screen for
[01:04:59] you
[01:05:01] now. If you can see it. I can see it.
[01:05:04] Oh. Uh oh. Oh no. Why can't you see that
[01:05:06] there? It ended and it didn't
[01:05:11] work. There we
[01:05:14] go. Perfect. You get to see what you get
[01:05:17] now on
[01:05:18] screen. Let's um
[01:05:23] do that. Can we make it smaller? I mean
[01:05:27] larger.
[01:05:30] Yeah. There you go. You see on screen
[01:05:32] what you get? at 13.
[01:05:37] Yeah, he has a harness on. I'll let you
[01:05:40] know. I'll let you know. Yeah, he has a
[01:05:41] harness on. Sorry, I got really
[01:05:44] sidetracked on getting that running.
[01:05:47] I know. I was I was boring for a minute
[01:05:49] there.
[01:05:53] It happens sometimes because uh you
[01:05:54] know, sometimes on Sundays, you know,
[01:05:56] people in the morning, they're slower
[01:05:57] and they
[01:06:02] Oh, some of it clipped off screen. All
[01:06:04] right, cool. Let me know then. Um, let
[01:06:06] me uh let me correct
[01:06:12] that. All right, let's try this
[01:06:17] now. Is it on screen
[01:06:20] now?
[01:06:24] Huh? All of them? They are now. All
[01:06:28] right, perfect. I wonder if I can make
[01:06:29] them
[01:06:46] larger.
[01:06:48] Okay, there you go.
[01:06:53] Customizable hexos are without
[01:06:56] number per hexos are without
[01:07:02] number.
[01:07:05] Okay. So
[01:07:12] dice four
[01:07:23] [Music]
[01:07:31] Um, let's
[01:07:34] see if we can make it bigger. Label
[01:07:37] there.
[01:07:39] Dice would
[01:07:47] be Let's see how we can do that.
[01:07:57] Let's try this. Let's see if we can do
[01:07:59] this. I don't know if it's going to
[01:08:00] work. We might break
[01:08:02] it, but we're going to
[01:08:04] try. We're going to try.
[01:08:32] Let's see if we break it.
[01:08:38] Should not should work theoretically. I
[01:08:41] don't know. I don't I'm not I haven't
[01:08:42] done this [Â __Â ] in
[01:08:44] years. Oh yeah, it
[01:08:46] did. Boom. Way bigger on the
[01:08:53] dice. Well, look at that. What do you
[01:08:55] guys think there?
[01:09:00] External might eternal might is
[01:09:03] nice. Yeah, you can you it can make it's
[01:09:06] a good pretty good one there.
[01:09:13] Perfect. I like it. Except for the dice
[01:09:15] goes away sometimes.
[01:09:20] later, but it's working for the moment.
[01:09:30] Ah,
[01:09:32] perfecto. You have some dice that roll.
[01:09:40] Yeah, I see.
[01:09:44] that. But yeah, at least you can see
[01:09:45] they kind of it's like a water. So, it's
[01:09:47] not bad. Not bad. Now, now the nice
[01:09:50] thing
[01:09:52] is I can cop I should be able to
[01:09:54] duplicate that. Yeah. See, that's pretty
[01:09:57] sweet. Should I make the dice bigger
[01:10:06] or is that ridiculous?
[01:10:10] No. Stop. Is that ridiculous in size or
[01:10:14] is that is that something good? Do we
[01:10:15] like that? Yes.
[01:10:19] I don't
[01:10:24] know. Crazy size or do we like the
[01:10:27] size? Let me know, guys. I'm trying it
[01:10:30] out here. Doing some new uh doing some
[01:10:32] new things. Add them in. Make it a
[01:10:34] little more fun. It's good. It's pretty
[01:10:35] good. All right. All right. Cool.
[01:10:36] Size-wise, it looks pretty good. Every
[01:10:38] now and again we a little mess up on
[01:10:40] the breaking up there, but we know it's
[01:10:42] sick. I know
[01:10:45] why. I know why. Hold on.
[01:10:49] Hold on.
[01:10:58] I think this might be it. I think this
[01:11:01] might be it.
[01:11:14] There we go. I think it was there. The
[01:11:16] result thing kept showing and blocking
[01:11:19] some of it. That's what it was. So, we
[01:11:22] don't need the results cuz we just use
[01:11:24] what we have here.
[01:11:30] Even better.
[01:11:35] Golden year. Oh,
[01:11:37] really? Especially every golden year
[01:11:39] ones. I like that. I know what you're
[01:11:41] talking about cuz I have to like do this
[01:11:42] now when I'm looking at my phone instead
[01:11:44] of because I I I start doing like this
[01:11:46] thing when my glasses are on. I'm like,
[01:11:47] "Oh crap, I'm doing my datab like wait,
[01:11:49] my glasses are on. Take those off." So,
[01:11:51] I have to take Oh, sorry guys. So, I
[01:11:53] have to take the glasses off now when
[01:11:54] I'm doing things. All right. So, here we
[01:11:56] go. That's that one.
[01:11:57] Let's
[01:11:59] uh let's do this
[01:12:05] here. Let's see if we can um do this
[01:12:08] here. We want
[01:12:12] to copy and I want to
[01:12:15] paste. No, no, no. Okay, we don't want
[01:12:19] to copy. We want to
[01:12:25] copy filter. That's what we want to
[01:12:28] do. Want to make a new
[01:12:30] one. We're going to call
[01:12:33] this just one
[01:12:37] D20.
[01:12:42] All right, let's make that image
[01:12:44] available. Go
[01:12:51] away. I hate how that makes that window
[01:12:54] go behind things sometimes.
[01:12:56] What? One.
[01:13:03] All right.
[01:13:06] One. William, I'm just going to let you
[01:13:08] know. I I understand you're watching,
[01:13:10] but that is like
[01:13:13] really like
[01:13:17] um
[01:13:21] frustratingly in my like base. I don't
[01:13:24] mind you wanting to watch. Just like
[01:13:25] say, "Hey, can I can I look, too?" And
[01:13:27] then let me then let me have some ideas.
[01:13:30] Ooh, look at that. Yeah. Look at that.
[01:13:32] That looks good, right? Yeah.
[01:13:35] Okay. I got to Oh, hold on. I got to go
[01:13:37] and edit. Make sure this
[01:13:39] uh There we go.
[01:13:45] Perfecto.
[01:13:50] Watching daddy there. Not bad. So, we're
[01:13:53] waiting on if uh anybody wants to
[01:13:55] participate in our break today. That's
[01:13:56] what we have pinned. It's our biggest
[01:13:58] loser break. Will Will was the one that
[01:14:01] came up with the map idea for us today.
[01:14:02] We'll do it another day if we don't get
[01:14:03] through it. Sometimes just the days it's
[01:14:05] slow. You know, there's nothing I can do
[01:14:06] about that. So, we have a aether drift.
[01:14:08] We got those. We got that there. We got
[01:14:10] some stuff. We'll be um we'll go through
[01:14:12] some of our singles and we'll start uh
[01:14:14] maybe we'll get a pack a bunch of them
[01:14:16] that we can do an auction one day and
[01:14:18] we'll have a stack of them. will start
[01:14:19] auctions at a dollar on a stack. That
[01:14:21] won't be maybe we'll have to plan that
[01:14:23] for one of the days coming out here cuz
[01:14:24] you can't just randomly do things. I'm
[01:14:26] not um I'm not as good as the rest of
[01:14:28] you like that. But right now though,
[01:14:31] thank you guys for watching. I do
[01:14:33] appreciate it. We're getting those dice
[01:14:34] up in there. Let's do let's do a uh now
[01:14:37] we have that.
[01:14:41] Then we have
[01:14:43] um we'll do
[01:14:46] another we'll go call
[01:14:53] it cuz that's what we need to
[01:14:57] do. All right. Remove that
[01:15:05] one. There you go. We're going to go
[01:15:08] here.
[01:15:11] Open that
[01:15:13] up. I'll
[01:15:15] copy. Go
[01:15:18] here. Where? Where did I put it? Oh,
[01:15:22] there it is. And I'll paste that in
[01:15:26] there. And then that is plus one
[01:15:31] D6. All right, let's see if that'll
[01:15:34] work. Ah, it
[01:15:37] does. just really large on the screen.
[01:15:40] So, I have to adjust. There we
[01:15:43] go. Oh, we have to make almost almost
[01:15:47] working
[01:15:50] right. There we go. We're getting our
[01:15:53] stuff set up.
[01:15:58] Yes. Yes. Correct. It would have to be
[01:16:00] filled to do the precon thing. If they
[01:16:01] don't fill, you have an option of um you
[01:16:04] just kind of get store credit. you can
[01:16:05] get a pack of something or or singles or
[01:16:07] something along that lines. Um, but
[01:16:09] yeah, that's what it would be for that.
[01:16:11] Or I mean, I guess if you go bought a
[01:16:13] couple of the spots, you could get the
[01:16:14] the deck itself, too, if you'd like cuz
[01:16:16] the deck is in the store. There is a
[01:16:18] deck in the store if you want. All
[01:16:19] right, so we got that one there.
[01:16:23] We're going to add
[01:16:25] in
[01:16:33] another cuz that's mainly what we use
[01:16:35] here. D20s
[01:16:37] and all that
[01:16:41] stuff. We don't use much of the others
[01:16:44] yet. I do have one where we have to do a
[01:16:46] D4 though. Oh, so that means I'm going
[01:16:48] to have to go and um find that one.
[01:16:54] But make that one. I haven't done that
[01:16:55] yet. That's a new
[01:16:57] one. Yeah, we're just uh going through.
[01:17:00] I'm figuring I might as well set it up
[01:17:02] while we're
[01:17:05] waiting. There's no one jumped in on the
[01:17:07] source on it yet. So, I figured I might
[01:17:09] as well set up our uh Hold on. Let's
[01:17:12] shrink that down so everybody can see
[01:17:13] our oncreen dice. Making it a little bit
[01:17:15] easier for everybody to see what goes on
[01:17:18] every time and what you're going to get
[01:17:19] for your rolls. That way we can do it
[01:17:22] nice and easy every time you get to
[01:17:26] roll. Makes it a randomized one there.
[01:17:29] And I'm going to get it so I can
[01:17:30] actually My plan is to put it so I can
[01:17:32] have it on a thing on screen here. Even
[01:17:34] I'll be able to press my buttons and get
[01:17:36] it to
[01:17:37] run. Now we have that many. We got to go
[01:17:41] with
[01:17:42] another. Going to go one
[01:17:45] d20
[01:17:47] plus 4 D6 because we use those every now
[01:17:50] and again.
[01:17:52] All right.
[01:17:55] Okay.
[01:17:59] Copy the filters. Paste the
[01:18:02] filters. Make the screen
[01:18:05] smaller, but big enough for all all the
[01:18:07] old fogies like me to see without having
[01:18:09] to have our glasses on. Good morning,
[01:18:11] Foss in Oblivion. How's it going, my
[01:18:12] friends? Hopefully you're uh Fos Spicy
[01:18:16] in Oblivion. Hopefully you're having a
[01:18:18] good uh good morning so far. We are
[01:18:22] setting up our
[01:18:25] [Music]
[01:18:28] um we're setting up
[01:18:30] our dice rolls. Ready? On screen dice
[01:18:35] rolls. Watch this. Let's see if it'll
[01:18:38] work.
[01:18:39] Right. Boom. Onscreen dice roll. From
[01:18:43] now on, you can turn it off. And oh,
[01:18:46] look. You'll get another on screen dice
[01:18:48] roll.
[01:18:50] Aha. I know, right? Pretty sweet. All
[01:18:54] right, so we got that there. And I can
[01:18:56] got I have different ones.
[01:18:58] Ready? Uh-oh. There we go. We got our uh
[01:19:01] our 3D d6s for you guys. Oh, we got our
[01:19:04] our
[01:19:05] 1D and we got our Just rolling to see
[01:19:08] what happens there. We have our our our
[01:19:11] 2D, our two. There we go. Aha. Look at
[01:19:14] all that.
[01:19:18] I know you guys hearing a brain cell at
[01:19:20] that same moment coming in and saying
[01:19:21] the same thing. Not too bad. Not too
[01:19:22] bad. Oblivion and um Spicy, we
[01:19:25] appreciate you coming in hanging out. So
[01:19:27] now we're going to do another browsers.
[01:19:28] Oh, this is going to be one.
[01:19:42] No, no, no, no, no.
[01:19:44] There was a uh one4.
[01:19:48] All right, let's try that now.
[01:19:55] Okay,
[01:19:57] let's get that one in here
[01:20:01] now. Go like
[01:20:05] that. Then we're going to go here.
[01:20:16] Let's see if that one works. So, we can
[01:20:17] get our D4 in
[01:20:20] there. Oh, it does. Look at
[01:20:23] that. You got a one. You got the one.
[01:20:27] That's just a little pain in the butt to
[01:20:28] see, but there you go. You got the one
[01:20:29] and the four. Three. Wow.
[01:20:34] Nice. There you go. Well, we got a break
[01:20:36] today. If you guys want to try it out,
[01:20:37] we have those with all your stuff on it.
[01:20:41] We have uh I I did a little upgrade uh
[01:20:44] for our internet today to see how it
[01:20:45] worked.
[01:20:49] Rock, honey, we're going to we're going
[01:20:50] to rock. So, hopefully the internet's
[01:20:51] been working better and keeping
[01:20:52] everything a bit clear. Oh, you got some
[01:20:55] good sleep last night. That's awesome.
[01:20:57] So, uh let's see actually what happens
[01:20:59] on this. How's it going here on this
[01:21:02] stuff?
[01:21:09] All
[01:21:11] right.
[01:21:13] So, that's what we're doing
[01:21:17] today. Hopefully, you guys are uh going
[01:21:20] to have some fun with
[01:21:22] us. Going to put that back. I think
[01:21:24] we're good on all those. So, I'm going
[01:21:27] to just close those. We don't need that
[01:21:28] running in the background. That's just
[01:21:30] extra stuff for no reason.
[01:21:33] Um, all right. We got those. We're good.
[01:21:36] We're going to keep adding in them in in
[01:21:38] here if uh you guys like what you see
[01:21:40] and let me know. We can add uh we're
[01:21:42] going to It's fun. We'll have uh if you
[01:21:45] guys want to. We've been working on
[01:21:46] trying to do a whole like uh D and D
[01:21:47] game. Uh if you want to join the um I
[01:21:50] have a whole campaign we made. Now today
[01:21:52] though we have for the boss though the
[01:21:54] boss for the uh the break today is Will
[01:21:58] created this map here that at the end of
[01:22:00] the at the end of the city you see an a
[01:22:03] fight going on and happens to be a
[01:22:04] Godzillaike creature who has this blue
[01:22:06] chip on them that controls them and a uh
[01:22:09] a kraken robotic kraken there being
[01:22:12] fought by the humans that are left
[01:22:14] over. Looks like something occurred.
[01:22:16] There was a crash and that turned into a
[01:22:18] Kraken and now they got to stop
[01:22:20] everybody from going to the mother ship
[01:22:21] cuz that's the Blues thing there. That's
[01:22:22] the mother ship. Uh they were trying to
[01:22:24] drop it down there to get everybody
[01:22:25] home. But you guys can get to it now and
[01:22:27] maybe stop the Godzilla. Maybe they'll
[01:22:30] take over and help. He even helped. He
[01:22:32] even created some of these. We did uh
[01:22:34] some characters. There's your your hand
[01:22:36] to hand compat alien you might run into.
[01:22:38] Your sniper alien you're going to run
[01:22:40] into at some point. And your commander
[01:22:42] who has a myrix is a it's a grenade.
[01:22:44] That's what they call their grenade.
[01:22:46] have a little fun as we uh wander
[01:22:48] through trying to see what we can do uh
[01:22:50] for our break today. Since it was a
[01:22:51] Sunday, the big break, we figured we'd
[01:22:53] do that. We have our um doing our, you
[01:22:55] know, our what do you call them? The
[01:22:58] biggest loser where we open all the
[01:23:00] packs. You get everybody gets them, you
[01:23:02] know, all the singles, whether mythics,
[01:23:04] rares or commons or uncommons are $3 or
[01:23:06] more. Put them in sleeve, shuffle them
[01:23:08] up, hand them out to everybody in their
[01:23:09] order that they are for their spot. And
[01:23:11] then whoever has the lowest monetary
[01:23:12] value of those of the hits, you know,
[01:23:15] out of those shuffled cards will get the
[01:23:18] deck in here. And whoever has the second
[01:23:19] one lowest monetary value will get the
[01:23:21] collector booster sample pack. That's
[01:23:23] what we do today with our break. That's
[01:23:26] what we got set up there. But we're just
[01:23:28] hanging out for a little while with all
[01:23:30] of you. Hopefully you guys are having
[01:23:31] some fun. Not too bad
[01:23:36] today. And we'll see what you like.
[01:23:42] All right. So, we got to go in here for
[01:23:44] a little bit. Then, um what I'm going to
[01:23:46] end up doing, we'll hopefully we can get
[01:23:47] this closed out. If we can't, like I
[01:23:49] said, we'll uh we'll end up
[01:23:51] just having the people that are in the
[01:23:53] break will have uh some store credit and
[01:23:55] you can either get something that's a
[01:23:57] pack or you can um some packs or
[01:23:59] singles. I know the other gentleman
[01:24:01] wanted to grab some singles. So, that's
[01:24:03] the option, too.
[01:24:09] All right. So, we got the dice that are
[01:24:10] rolling. And got the dice that are
[01:24:13] rolling.
[01:24:17] Now, now that we got the dice that are
[01:24:21] rolling, let's do
[01:24:25] this. We want to do another
[01:24:27] one. What else do we use
[01:24:32] regularly? Just that. that that D6
[01:24:38] D5. I that's the only ones that we use.
[01:24:40] We don't really use anything
[01:24:44] else. I don't think we really use
[01:24:46] anything else, right? No, I don't think
[01:24:47] we have. We only check the stats. We got
[01:24:52] a No. No. That's really it. That's all
[01:24:56] that's used.
[01:25:03] The result is nice though. You get to
[01:25:06] see what the results are. So, I'll give
[01:25:08] you your total. I think that's why that
[01:25:10] we have the results there. So, actually
[01:25:12] isn't bad for when we need uh because we
[01:25:14] need to add them all up to see, but we
[01:25:15] don't need it for the damage. We getting
[01:25:17] separate things. That's why.
[01:25:19] All right, let's see if anybody here
[01:25:23] would like to uh
[01:25:25] participate now that we have our our
[01:25:28] dice set up. That's we got our uh you
[01:25:31] can roll your
[01:25:35] When you're playing the game, we roll
[01:25:36] our dice now. Whatever one we need to
[01:25:39] and you get your number right on screen
[01:25:41] there. Nice and easy. Aha. Pretty
[01:25:48] sweet. Now, I was thinking of trying to
[01:25:50] change the colors. What do you guys
[01:25:53] think?
[01:25:55] Let me see if I can
[01:25:56] uh edit
[01:25:59] the height. Let's make
[01:26:04] this. See if I can do
[01:26:09] that. Ah, give it more space. That's
[01:26:11] what I'm trying to
[01:26:13] do. Let's call that
[01:26:21] um there. We like that.
[01:26:28] Got more space. Uhhuh. Now what I can do
[01:26:32] is this. I don't need the size of the
[01:26:33] dice as
[01:26:35] big. Near the dice scale down to
[01:26:41] this.
[01:26:43] Ah, that's
[01:26:49] better. Let's do that. Do the same
[01:26:52] thing.
[01:26:59] And then um let's see. We'll do
[01:27:02] the still big. Got to change this the
[01:27:05] scale. Got to change the scale
[01:27:10] again. Ah, that's pretty good. Use the
[01:27:14] whole screen
[01:27:15] now. So, what we uh this is why we like
[01:27:18] to fine-tune things. We only do this
[01:27:20] when we're not on screen here, but I
[01:27:23] figure well uh might as well since we're
[01:27:25] hanging out waiting on everybody to jump
[01:27:27] in and doing some adventuring and we're
[01:27:29] doing some pack breaking. We might as
[01:27:31] well get some of the other stuff
[01:27:32] rolling. Making sure it looks good. I
[01:27:35] like
[01:27:36] it.
[01:27:38] Nice. Nice. All
[01:27:40] right, here we
[01:27:43] go. Let me know if you like it
[01:27:46] yourselves.
[01:27:49] I think it's pretty nice
[01:27:52] looking. At least setting it up like
[01:27:54] this. Now, it's going to make it nice
[01:27:56] and easy to do uh the dice rolls for you
[01:28:01] guys. Use the whole screen there. I feel
[01:28:04] like this one I should shrink
[01:28:09] up to. Uh actually, let's do this. I
[01:28:12] should shrink that one up a little
[01:28:14] bit since this. No, adjust
[01:28:19] that. Maybe we do
[01:28:22] that. Just adjust
[01:28:25] those. Yes, that's
[01:28:28] better. I can There we
[01:28:34] go. Good. That's good. Another one. D20.
[01:28:38] That's perfect right there.
[01:28:41] You can just make this make it a larger
[01:28:43] for the uh the abil the factor of being
[01:28:45] able to
[01:28:51] see some more. There you go. And we're
[01:28:54] Oh, I forgot to make the
[01:28:57] dice,
[01:29:00] smaller. There we
[01:29:02] are.
[01:29:05] Perfect. And then we're going to do this
[01:29:07] one that's similar as the others.
[01:29:10] We make it to 1 15 0
[01:29:12] 0 and then the
[01:29:15] scale
[01:29:18] down. And we um move that
[01:29:22] up. Is
[01:29:27] that
[01:29:29] do that
[01:29:31] instead?
[01:29:35] There. I thought I changed the dice
[01:29:37] scale. Did I not?
[01:29:39] I did. That's good.
[01:29:43] Perfect. Not bad. I think they're all
[01:29:45] looking
[01:29:46] good. Now we have our Oh, that's not it.
[01:29:50] You guys got some things you're going to
[01:29:51] run into today on Will's
[01:29:55] map. What you going to roll? You going
[01:29:58] to attack and you going to win? What is
[01:30:00] going to happen with your
[01:30:02] character? Actually, pretty good. I
[01:30:04] think I did pretty good there. Well,
[01:30:06] either way, we got them up and running.
[01:30:08] You know what? Maybe somebody wants to
[01:30:09] just do try it out and do a little quick
[01:30:11] adventure. Someone that's been around
[01:30:13] before or maybe somebody new do a little
[01:30:16] quick encounter for a dollar. Check out
[01:30:18] the uh the wasteland and see what we got
[01:30:20] for a single that is related to
[01:30:23] Innistrad or um Aether Drift right now.
[01:30:26] That's what we have in there.
[01:30:36] And then you get to uh do a little thing
[01:30:38] in the wasteland. We'll see what happens
[01:30:39] for you. Maybe you run into somebody,
[01:30:42] maybe hit a a counter, a weapon, the
[01:30:44] hidden
[01:30:45] door. Hanberg wants to try and see what
[01:30:49] happens, what they get for a single
[01:30:50] here. Like I said, it's between
[01:30:51] Innistrad and some uh Aether Drift or
[01:30:55] what we have there. Hanberg's going to
[01:30:56] go for a little adventure.
[01:31:00] Thank you. I appreciate that. Yeah, it's
[01:31:02] something I something I've been thinking
[01:31:03] about doing. So, are you got a Bedum
[01:31:05] Reveler from um your Innistrad
[01:31:08] Remastered and now the cool thing is you
[01:31:11] my friend now you got a knife you picked
[01:31:14] up. So, being new
[01:31:16] Hanburgger, you don't have much for
[01:31:19] anything as a character, but what you do
[01:31:26] is you start with a pistol and a knife.
[01:31:32] which is nice because that gets
[01:31:35] you now that you have a knife, you have
[01:31:38] two knives, which nicely means you
[01:31:41] actually get to start off right away
[01:31:43] being able to dual wield because dual
[01:31:44] wielding the knives and pistols are the
[01:31:47] only things you can dual wield. So, you
[01:31:49] now have the ability to dual wield
[01:31:51] knives and you also have a pistol to
[01:31:54] start out with. You have 100 health and
[01:31:56] that's what it is. So, your character is
[01:31:58] wandering around the city here. You
[01:32:00] wandered into it. You see some city
[01:32:02] scaffolding in the background. You see
[01:32:04] uh this thing going on here, you're
[01:32:05] like, I don't know if I want to go
[01:32:07] running into that yet. You know, it's
[01:32:09] it's something we might want to, but not
[01:32:10] at the moment. Maybe I should go find
[01:32:12] some other things. So, you got yourself
[01:32:14] your uh
[01:32:16] your your knife there. And now, let me
[01:32:19] get your bedum out so we can get that
[01:32:22] for you.
[01:32:29] Bedum
[01:32:30] Reveler. There you go, my friend. It's a
[01:32:33] nice one. Nice little pickup for
[01:32:36] you. And I'm going to put you over here,
[01:32:40] huh? Think I have your name written down
[01:32:42] here. Yes, I do. I knew you picked up
[01:32:44] the other ones. So, put you over here
[01:32:46] with those. And get you in a bag to keep
[01:32:49] everything together. So, you're
[01:32:51] wandering around. when you got in the
[01:32:52] city there, but when you happen to find
[01:32:54] you leaned over, you found a knife just
[01:32:57] hanging out in the ground there. When
[01:32:59] you turn around, you see a
[01:33:01] uh a feral ghoul that happens to be in
[01:33:04] front of you. That's not good. You have
[01:33:06] to decide now, my friend. Do
[01:33:09] you want
[01:33:11] to run from them or do you want to
[01:33:13] attack? You do have two knives. So that
[01:33:15] means when you roll, you get to roll d,
[01:33:18] which is what we tell us. So you get a
[01:33:21] you have to have a 14 or higher with
[01:33:23] this guy, but being you have two knives,
[01:33:25] each knife is worth plus two. So that
[01:33:27] means you actually have to have a 10 or
[01:33:28] higher you roll on the d20. And then you
[01:33:32] also get to roll two d6s to see what you
[01:33:35] get for damage on them. All right. So do
[01:33:38] you want to attack or do you want to
[01:33:39] turn and uh run
[01:33:41] away? It's up to you. Hanberg
[01:33:45] Hanberg. All right. You're going to
[01:33:47] attack. Use your knives. Yeah. All
[01:33:49] right. Time to attack.
[01:33:55] And oh, you hit. You got an 11. Nice.
[01:33:58] So, you hit for five damage. Not bad.
[01:34:02] And that guy's only 15 damage. Has only
[01:34:05] 15 health. So, that feral ghoul whales
[01:34:07] in pain. Oh, let's get the uh let's get
[01:34:10] the dice away. That feral ghoul whales
[01:34:12] in
[01:34:14] pain. Does not like what just
[01:34:16] happened. and he slashes at you. Now,
[01:34:20] for them, it is one d6 and 1 d20. They
[01:34:25] need to have a 13 or higher to hit you.
[01:34:26] And oh my god, they got a 13. That's no
[01:34:29] good for you, my friend. So, they hit
[01:34:30] you. They take four
[01:34:33] damage. 96. Now, you're standing there
[01:34:36] looking at this guy to make. You want to
[01:34:39] turn and run or you want to attack
[01:34:40] again?
[01:34:44] Oh, we better not have some stuff going
[01:34:46] on like this right
[01:34:48] now. All right, here we go. I'm cutting
[01:34:51] out. Yeah, I shouldn't be. All right,
[01:34:54] let's see here. Am I doing better
[01:34:57] now? We had some waves that went by, so
[01:34:59] that can be happening every now and
[01:35:01] again when we're on the boat. Waves
[01:35:02] going by there. We'll do that. But
[01:35:04] there. All right. So, you have to decide
[01:35:06] now. You're with your feral ghoul there
[01:35:08] in front of you. You got those two
[01:35:09] knives.
[01:35:19] All right. No, I shouldn't be
[01:35:21] gone. All right. Sorry about that. Uh,
[01:35:24] that was um Whatnot actually kicked me
[01:35:28] off. I was running everywhere else, but
[01:35:30] whatnot for whatever reason dropped me.
[01:35:34] So, I'm good though. I think I'm back
[01:35:35] here good now. Let's see.
[01:35:40] We'll check if it is good or not. I
[01:35:42] don't know.
[01:35:45] I think I
[01:35:50] am. Should be fine and
[01:35:54] running. Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm
[01:35:57] good. Think we're good. I think we're
[01:36:00] good. All right. Sorry about that. So,
[01:36:02] you got Oh, nice pickup
[01:36:04] there. Nice pickup on the blood money.
[01:36:09] I'll get those se those uh for you MJ
[01:36:11] Huck and your black market connections.
[01:36:14] So Hanburgg, you need to make a
[01:36:16] decision. Do you want to run from the
[01:36:17] fereral ghoul or do you want to attack
[01:36:19] one more time because you have you have
[01:36:20] another attack a
[01:36:23] chance? You have your choices. Just keep
[01:36:26] attacking. All right, you're going to
[01:36:27] keep attacking. We're going to attack
[01:36:31] again. You got your two knives. Oh, you
[01:36:34] hit for eight. Nice. So, ghost ride is
[01:36:38] now down to two health. It's whailing.
[01:36:40] No idea why it keeps doing that. It's so
[01:36:44] weird. Yeah, I'm on a boat. That is
[01:36:46] correct, Henberg. We are on a boat. That
[01:36:49] is correct. So, you're We're on a boat.
[01:36:52] Yes, we live on a 40 foot catamaran,
[01:36:54] actually. So, you have a feral ghoul in
[01:36:56] front of
[01:36:57] you. Let's see if it does it again. Come
[01:37:01] on,
[01:37:02] internet. Yes. No. Maybe. So, we're
[01:37:05] going to keep it going. Yo, no. All
[01:37:08] right, here we go. So, yes, we are on a
[01:37:10] boat. So, you have that feral ghoul that
[01:37:12] is in front of you. You uh you hit it
[01:37:14] with your knives there. You have a
[01:37:16] decision. You can turn back to the city
[01:37:18] and run, or you can try one more time
[01:37:20] for an attack.
[01:37:32] Oh, no. I'm not using um anything like
[01:37:36] that specifically
[01:37:38] uh to do a game. Like you can't use it
[01:37:41] to um um um stuff to decide what you're
[01:37:44] getting in something. It's different.
[01:37:45] Like say if I was going to do it to roll
[01:37:47] for the packs, I can't do that. But
[01:37:49] since I'm not doing it for like the
[01:37:50] packs that we're doing, we can do it
[01:37:52] this way. If that makes sense. Uh
[01:37:57] Hanburgg. Well, actually, I think it
[01:37:59] might be more something with the
[01:38:00] internet right now, personally, because
[01:38:02] I keep I can see it dropping in and out
[01:38:03] when I'm looking at my
[01:38:05] um my uh amount of data going between
[01:38:10] everything. And it dropped off of
[01:38:12] YouTube a second ago, which generally
[01:38:14] doesn't happen unless there is
[01:38:18] a internet problem,
[01:38:21] which I don't understand
[01:38:23] why we have any type of problem right
[01:38:26] now. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know why it's
[01:38:28] like giving me like a wonder if I like
[01:38:30] something happened. Like it's just
[01:38:31] weird. I'm getting a lot of
[01:38:37] drops. I don't know why I'm getting a
[01:38:39] lot of drops all of a
[01:38:43] sudden.
[01:38:46] Nah. No
[01:38:50] obstructions. I don't know. I just got a
[01:38:51] really lot of drops all of a sudden. Uh
[01:38:54] uh Starlink uh decided to crap out for a
[01:38:56] minute there. They didn't like uh what I
[01:38:58] was doing somewhere, I guess. I don't
[01:39:00] know. Hopefully they do. Now I'm on uh
[01:39:03] I'm on X and we are
[01:39:05] on
[01:39:07] YouTube the others here. Hopefully we're
[01:39:09] still working. All right. But anyways,
[01:39:11] we got our adventure. You had your feral
[01:39:14] ghoul in front of you. You needed to
[01:39:16] decide what you're going to be doing.
[01:39:17] All right, that's what it was. You have
[01:39:19] one more chance to attack. I'm guessing
[01:39:21] you said you could going to keep
[01:39:22] attacking. So now what we'll do is we're
[01:39:25] going to roll. You
[01:39:29] attacked and you hit you got that eight.
[01:39:31] They they wailed in pain and they swung
[01:39:33] at you. I'm sorry. Hit the wrong one. Oh
[01:39:36] my. You saw that? They got they got a
[01:39:38] 20. Do you see that? You see that? They
[01:39:42] got a natural 20 and they hit you for a
[01:39:44] six. Oh
[01:39:48] my. Oh no. So that means you've got uh
[01:39:55] Hanburgg. You're down now. Uh you were
[01:39:58] hit
[01:40:00] before four. That brought you 96. Now it
[01:40:03] brings you down to
[01:40:10] 90. Why isn't it
[01:40:14] working? That's why I need to reload it.
[01:40:19] You go down to 90 and you are now rad
[01:40:23] poisoned. That means you're going to
[01:40:25] have to find some rata away somewhere if
[01:40:29] you would like to
[01:40:31] uh find
[01:40:33] yourself back alive at some point
[01:40:36] because you're going to have some
[01:40:36] issues. So you have uh you're going to
[01:40:38] attack again. I guess you said one last
[01:40:40] time. You're going to keep attacking. So
[01:40:42] you attack your last time. And that
[01:40:45] feral ghoul, you missed them. Oh
[01:40:48] no, you whiff with your knives cuz that
[01:40:52] uh that rad poisoning that doesn't help
[01:40:54] you. That feral ghoul goes after
[01:40:57] you. They hit you for Oh, they miss. You
[01:41:00] got lucky. And what happens? They they
[01:41:02] end up getting so sick and tired of this
[01:41:04] that they almost die themselves and they
[01:41:06] run away.
[01:41:08] Pogs were dropped in front of you as he
[01:41:11] ran past, which means you got some Pogs
[01:41:14] for your uh character in the wasteland
[01:41:16] in case you happen to run
[01:41:18] into any of our safe havens, like you
[01:41:21] know where you can do some trading stuff
[01:41:22] like
[01:41:23] that. All right, so you got
[01:41:28] those. I thought I pinned the
[01:41:33] brake. Ah. Ah, sorry. I thought I had
[01:41:36] pinned the brake
[01:41:37] there. It must have moved from the other
[01:41:40] one. I had pinned it, but you know what?
[01:41:46] Yeah, I know viewers thinking that got
[01:41:48] our break there. The biggest loser
[01:41:52] break.
[01:41:54] So, let's
[01:41:59] see.
[01:42:01] No. All righty. Looks like the
[01:42:03] internet's all working all right now.
[01:42:04] So, what I'll do here is we'll hang out
[01:42:06] for a little while longer. We've been on
[01:42:07] here for a bit, but uh not almost
[01:42:09] two-ish hours. Uh we'll uh if we need to
[01:42:13] in the we'll say around 10:30, we'll
[01:42:16] start planning to get off so I can go
[01:42:17] and do some other stuff that we need to
[01:42:19] get done today. And then um what we'll
[01:42:22] do is I'll give you your option your
[01:42:23] packs, Hanberg, that you were talking
[01:42:24] about or your singles that you were
[01:42:25] looking at, Hanburgg. That way we can
[01:42:27] get those for you. And what I'm going to
[01:42:28] do right now though is I'm going to get
[01:42:29] out MJ
[01:42:31] Hu singles.
[01:42:35] which are black
[01:42:37] market connections. Let me get out that
[01:42:40] for
[01:42:42] you. Here are the bees. These are all in
[01:42:46] my uh buy now. So, if anybody wants it,
[01:42:49] make sure you
[01:42:51] look. And
[01:42:53] black market
[01:42:56] connections. You went with 161 foil.
[01:43:00] There you go. Black market connections.
[01:43:04] Then you got blood money. I thought
[01:43:06] there was another
[01:43:09] BL. Blood
[01:43:18] money. Blood
[01:43:23] money. Oh, secret
[01:43:26] layer. That's why.
[01:43:31] That's why it is
[01:43:37] beholder. Blood money. There you
[01:43:43] go. And then you also picked up a nice
[01:43:46] counter spell. Those ones are
[01:43:48] fun. There you go, my friend.
[01:43:56] get the whole shebang pack from
[01:44:01] uh from uh Vegas. So, there you go. All
[01:44:05] that for you, my friend. I'll write your
[01:44:07] name on the back of this
[01:44:09] one. MJ Hawk, and thank you for coming
[01:44:11] in and hanging out with us. I appreciate
[01:44:13] that.
[01:44:15] MJ
[01:44:18] Huck. Got some nice singles for
[01:44:20] you. And put your name down there. get
[01:44:23] you in a bag and
[01:44:25] uh if you'd like to, we do have our
[01:44:28] break available. So, you do have uh
[01:44:30] pretty much free shipping on packs or
[01:44:31] anything like that. And so, if you want
[01:44:32] to jump in, you can do that now. And I
[01:44:35] don't think it's going to cost you
[01:44:36] anything. I think it's actually a free
[01:44:38] free shipping at this time. All right.
[01:44:41] So, we're hanging out here today. We
[01:44:43] have uh it is Will's map this this day.
[01:44:47] He chose to do a he wanted to help us
[01:44:50] make an end of the end of the uh boss
[01:44:52] fight here. All right. And see what
[01:44:53] happened. That was what he chose. We
[01:44:55] have this map here. That's kind of like
[01:44:57] a got some aliens that are coming to
[01:45:00] attack the um the wasteland. You know,
[01:45:03] you run into every now and again you run
[01:45:05] into aliens cuz we had an alien gatling
[01:45:07] gun. So, you had to know aliens were
[01:45:08] going to come in at some point
[01:45:10] somewhere. It was just a matter of when
[01:45:12] and where. So, now that we have all our
[01:45:15] things to roll, I'm going to actually do
[01:45:17] this. We're going to make
[01:45:24] a do
[01:45:27] this. And I'm going to put in that. Then
[01:45:31] we're going to do
[01:45:34] this. I'm going to put
[01:45:39] in that. And then we're going to go like
[01:45:42] this.
[01:45:45] Nope. Not going to work.
[01:45:49] Ah, that's where I need to do it. I did
[01:45:51] that
[01:45:55] wrong. That's what I did wrong. Well,
[01:45:58] there we go. There you go.
[01:46:06] D20. Oh, I still have the other one on.
[01:46:09] It's only one that goes across, right?
[01:46:13] Yeah, it is just one that goes across.
[01:46:15] Okay, then we're going to go. We're
[01:46:17] going to get the next
[01:46:21] one, which
[01:46:23] is that. Does it work? It works.
[01:46:29] Nice. Then we're going to get the next
[01:46:31] one. Huh? Waves. Oh, we're going to get
[01:46:33] some waves. So, I might lose a little
[01:46:35] bit of connection here for a bit cuz
[01:46:37] that [Â __Â ] happens. All right. Oh, we got
[01:46:40] more. Got that one. That one's
[01:46:43] good. And then we have um let's get
[01:46:49] another. That was four. No, that was not
[01:46:52] four. That this is
[01:46:54] four. What?
[01:46:58] Four. Four
[01:47:02] works. Oh, we got to get some big waves
[01:47:04] now.
[01:47:06] Now, the one with the
[01:47:10] uh
[01:47:14] D4. That one
[01:47:16] works. Nice. They all work. All the ones
[01:47:20] we put in there.
[01:47:26] Perfect. Oh, no. Not pin. Un put the
[01:47:30] name. Nice. This is a dice rolls.
[01:47:37] Nice. Now we're going to do this. Put
[01:47:40] that
[01:47:43] there. Now we can roll the dice.
[01:47:47] Easy. Boom. Onscreen dice rolling. There
[01:47:51] you go. Hey, Kill Tren Angry Cats. Thank
[01:47:54] you all for coming in and hanging out.
[01:47:56] We do appreciate it. Hopefully we have
[01:47:58] some fun today and uh do a little bit of
[01:47:59] our break. I know we sold some of the
[01:48:00] singles. I pulled those out and showed
[01:48:02] those out for you guys. But we do have
[01:48:03] our break today. And when are you going
[01:48:05] to do that? We get to uh we're going to
[01:48:06] do a little adventure after. We have
[01:48:08] Will made a map today going to fight off
[01:48:11] uh at the end of the at the edge of the
[01:48:12] city. There's a battle going on between
[01:48:14] the humans and some other things. You
[01:48:17] guys are going to help us figure it out.
[01:48:19] You going to help us encounter it. Now,
[01:48:22] looks like we might be getting to uh one
[01:48:25] of those days that it's a slow ones. It
[01:48:27] happens every now and again. Now, the
[01:48:29] ping success has been worse and worse
[01:48:31] and worse
[01:48:32] recently for whatever
[01:48:35] reason. I don't know
[01:48:39] why,
[01:48:41] but we're going to have to make a
[01:48:43] decision here shortly on what we're
[01:48:46] going to keep
[01:48:48] doing
[01:48:50] because we do have to do some other
[01:48:53] stuff today with the family. So, that
[01:48:55] means we uh we don't always get to hang
[01:48:58] out here forever with you all. I mean,
[01:49:00] it would be nice if we
[01:49:03] could, but it we just don't have the
[01:49:06] ability
[01:49:11] to. So,
[01:49:19] um All
[01:49:21] righty. Good morning. Good morning.
[01:49:23] Well, we going to keep going. Uh, well,
[01:49:25] we'll go with some of the single ones
[01:49:26] instead. Surprise sets. We'll try one of
[01:49:29] those. One more of
[01:49:30] those for you. See if you want to try
[01:49:33] that. And if not, I think what we'll do
[01:49:35] is
[01:49:39] um I don't know. We might just uh get
[01:49:42] your singles out, my friend Hanburgg. I
[01:49:44] know you sent to me a chunk of them that
[01:49:46] you'd want. So, we'll take those out and
[01:49:48] send those to you instead. And I think
[01:49:50] what we'll end up doing today is
[01:49:52] um we got you saw me add some stuff in
[01:49:55] there. So that should be cool for you
[01:49:57] guys. And uh um something for someone to
[01:49:59] steal since obviously no one's hanging
[01:50:01] out with me and I'm always the one that
[01:50:02] has no one in there for everybody to
[01:50:04] come and steal their ideas from. So
[01:50:06] that's why I see everybody pop in every
[01:50:07] now and again from different locations
[01:50:08] uh and different ones which is not bad.
[01:50:10] That's like, you know, it's a form of uh
[01:50:12] what do you call that? A form of um
[01:50:14] flattery. Flattery if they do that, you
[01:50:16] know. Wow. What can you say though?
[01:50:19] That is uh what I'll do though being
[01:50:22] Sunday.
[01:50:25] I don't know. We didn't have anything we
[01:50:27] did today. Did we only had that one uh
[01:50:30] one open there. You know what, boys?
[01:50:32] Come here. Coming. I want I We kept a
[01:50:36] couple of these for ourselves. So, we're
[01:50:37] going to open up some. And I want you
[01:50:39] guys you to pick one. Feel one each.
[01:50:42] Pick one.
[01:50:45] Where have they been? Just William Nolan
[01:50:47] just at because they're the way the
[01:50:50] foils are does that sometimes they
[01:50:52] curl they call
[01:50:55] Pringling. So let's see what we got
[01:50:57] going on here. All right. Not forever.
[01:51:00] No. No. This. Okay. No. That one too is
[01:51:03] just put it. Let him check
[01:51:06] too. Oh, we're going to get rocked again
[01:51:08] from some
[01:51:09] boats. So we'll uh we'll get that going
[01:51:12] on. We're going to rock
[01:51:14] it. Get
[01:51:19] rocking. Yeah, William. Nolan, I'm just
[01:51:22] going to let you know. 10 minutes, 20
[01:51:24] minutes takes a long time and takes up
[01:51:26] mine. That's the ones that you decided
[01:51:27] on. Those of you didn't like the same
[01:51:29] ones. Yeah. Neither of you like the same
[01:51:31] one. William, I'm not Nolan. I'm not
[01:51:33] William has a William has a mouth, too.
[01:51:36] I want you to know that if I ask both of
[01:51:38] you a question, not one gets to answer
[01:51:40] for both of you. You both need to answer
[01:51:42] me. Yes. Hello, William. Uh, did you
[01:51:46] even this one? These two.
[01:51:49] This one's mine. No. Okay. This is what
[01:51:53] I'm doing now.
[01:52:04] You can be different ones.
[01:52:07] Don't pick different ones just because
[01:52:08] you want to be the one opposite of your
[01:52:10] brother.
[01:52:12] You sure? All right, we're going to try
[01:52:14] it. Sometimes you guys just pick
[01:52:16] different things just to be I'm
[01:52:17] different from each other. You know,
[01:52:18] that's perfectly fine, but not in these
[01:52:19] scenarios. Does that make sense? Let's
[01:52:21] do this. All right, let's see what we
[01:52:23] have here. Box topper. We have a lot of
[01:52:25] box toppers. Yeah, we do have a handful
[01:52:27] of them. So, that's why I wanted to open
[01:52:30] this one. So, let's see what we get
[01:52:31] here.
[01:52:34] And uh we're going to go. All right. Oh,
[01:52:37] we got a nice mountain. Nice. Oh, that
[01:52:40] looks cool. Look at that one. That's
[01:52:42] what we get. I haven't seen that
[01:52:44] mountain yet for the gold ones. And then
[01:52:46] we get Oh, Act Emerald Radiant. Oh, we
[01:52:50] got got the same one as the other one.
[01:52:51] Nice. That's a nice one there. I like
[01:52:53] the gold. That is the special ones
[01:52:55] there. Nice one there. Superhuman. Look,
[01:52:57] I think my deck. You could potentially
[01:52:59] add it. Yeah, I know. You got uh you
[01:53:01] have insects, so that would definitely
[01:53:03] help your insect deck out. Him and him
[01:53:05] as Yeah. Hold on. This is what it is.
[01:53:07] We'll read it together here. Ready?
[01:53:09] When Atic enters, create a one- one
[01:53:12] green insect creature token for each
[01:53:14] artifact and or creature card in your
[01:53:16] graveyard. Whenever another insect you
[01:53:19] control dies, put a plus one plus1
[01:53:21] counter on a
[01:53:22] check. Each opponent
[01:53:31] loses and uh it looks like for whatever
[01:53:35] reason froze up a little bit. I don't
[01:53:37] know. You're lagging.
[01:53:44] Kidding me.
[01:53:50] Usually get legendary creatures that are
[01:53:52] special treated graded just so I can
[01:53:54] still play with this. Yeah, I know.
[01:53:56] Sometime that's what it is. It's nice to
[01:53:58] do that. Yeah. So, like this this one
[01:54:00] wouldn't be bad. Like I don't know how
[01:54:01] much this is. Let's take a look. I
[01:54:03] haven't looked at this one yet.
[01:54:06] A a TC
[01:54:08] h
[01:54:10] emerald. I think this is the first place
[01:54:12] foil.
[01:54:14] Yes, probably. Yeah, not not bad. $3 for
[01:54:17] that. And then we have uh
[01:54:26] mountain is uh
[01:54:29] 515. Oh, the mountain's 10 bucks. Look
[01:54:31] at that. Wow. 10 bucks. Dang. That's a
[01:54:34] That's a big hit on a mountain, let
[01:54:36] alone in itself. $10 for the mountain.
[01:54:38] Dang. $3 for the other one. There you
[01:54:41] go. I didn't want it to be that much.
[01:54:44] Put those over here. Not bad. We like
[01:54:46] Well, I like mountains and we like to
[01:54:47] spice up our deck. So, not bad for you.
[01:54:50] Yeah. That pick up
[01:54:51] everyone $10. Not bad. Well, what we're
[01:54:56] going to do today is we were here for a
[01:54:58] little bit. We do have to head out. We
[01:54:59] generally head out stay on here for a
[01:55:01] little while in the mornings. Um tried
[01:55:02] something out here. We'll see if it
[01:55:04] works. I don't know if we're going to be
[01:55:05] able to have the great connection all
[01:55:06] the time like this. It's only probably
[01:55:08] going to be on on weekends and things
[01:55:10] like that or on days that we uh where we
[01:55:12] can we know it's going to roll. So,
[01:55:14] other days it might be a little slower,
[01:55:15] but we'll work on some of that. Or the
[01:55:17] other thing, too, is if you guys want to
[01:55:18] do some of just the D and D adventures,
[01:55:20] we create and have our own uh campaigns.
[01:55:24] So, if you'd like to jump in the Discord
[01:55:26] channel, let us know if you want to
[01:55:28] participate in any of those and we'll do
[01:55:30] one of the sessions where we just stream
[01:55:31] one of those and it can be uh long form.
[01:55:33] So, it's like a TV or we can put it in
[01:55:35] the uh in the vertical like you're on
[01:55:36] your phone. So, you can watch it
[01:55:37] wherever you are and participate
[01:55:39] wherever you are. And now the cool thing
[01:55:42] is for you guys that want to steal my
[01:55:43] ideas again, I have oncreen dice rolls
[01:55:45] for you to play your games. Look at
[01:55:49] that. Boom.
[01:55:52] But for those of you that are here, what
[01:55:55] we'll do is we're going to go hang out
[01:55:56] with uh send you over to a friend of
[01:55:58] ours, Mr. Fong. He used to hang out here
[01:56:00] for a while and then he's been now
[01:56:01] online streaming himself after uh he
[01:56:04] watched us for a bit and now he does his
[01:56:05] own thing doing some uh art stuff. Well,

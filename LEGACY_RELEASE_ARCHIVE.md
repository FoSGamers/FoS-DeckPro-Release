## Historical Release Process & Checklists

### Gold Standard Summary & Checklist (Legacy)
- All personal files are in user_private/ and listed in .gitignore.
- All build artifacts and large files are in .gitignore and never committed.
- No build artifacts or large files are present in git history (use git filter-repo if needed).
- All code is modular, documented, and tested (with docstrings and unit tests).
- All configuration and constants are centralized.
- All features are independently enable/disable-able.
- All UI/UX follows a consistent style guide.
- All error handling is user-friendly and provides safe fallbacks.
- Every code change is accompanied by a test and documentation update.
- Changelog is updated for every release or significant change.
- All scripts (start_feature.sh, finish_release.sh, onboarding.sh, clean_for_release.sh) are present and used.
- Onboarding script is added to your shell profile for reminders.
- GitHub Actions for release hygiene and old release cleanup are enabled.
- Branch protection rules are set for main and release branches.
- All PRs and issues use the provided templates and checklists.
- All documentation (README.md, RELEASE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, PROJECT_WORKFLOW_TEMPLATE.md) is up to date and explicit.
- No secrets, credentials, or sensitive data are ever committed.
- All contributors are aware of and follow these rules.

### Legacy Release Branch and Artifact Process
- All work must be done in feature branches or personal-dev.
- Never merge unfinished or untested work into main.
- All PRs must be reviewed and pass all CI checks.
- All PRs must update the changelog and documentation as needed.
- Only code, resources, and documentation needed for others to use or run the app are included in a release.
- No personal data, backups, or sensitive configs.
- Use PyInstaller or your preferred tool as described in the README to build the app for release.
- Package only the cleaned files for distribution.

### Legacy CI/CD and Release Hygiene
- Every PR and push to a release branch runs a GitHub Action that blocks the build if any personal files are present.
- If the check fails:
  1. Run `./clean_for_release.sh` locally.
  2. Commit and push the cleaned branch.
  3. Re-read this file and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) to ensure compliance.

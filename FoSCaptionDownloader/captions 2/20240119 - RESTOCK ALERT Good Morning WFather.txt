[02:08:48] buying from Steve Jobs yeah I don't know
[02:08:51] about that I'm not that type of a that
[02:08:54] I'm not that type of anal with my I call
[02:08:57] her actually my wife does say I have
[02:08:58] certain things that I have to do certain
[02:09:00] ways and if I don't I get very
[02:09:01] frustrated she like this is why you
[02:09:03] doing your own little business thing
[02:09:04] here is the best thing in the world
[02:09:06] because you do it your way and if people
[02:09:08] don't like it they don't need to watch a
[02:09:09] show if they do like it they watch it
[02:09:11] and you do your thing all right here we
[02:09:13] go nice R card one two three four five
[02:09:16] and six one two three four five and six
[02:09:20] but yeah that's what uh I was that was
[02:09:22] my luck growing up Milo Maro sorcerer

[02:09:48] of the amethyst that's a good one too
[02:09:51] there and a thorn of the black rose and
[02:09:52] then you get yourself a ly Leon leonin
[02:09:57] Arbiter yeah so I figure God I guess
[02:10:00] gave me uh if there is one gave me some
[02:10:01] good luck here with my intelligence so
[02:10:04] that's why I have bad luck with
[02:10:05] everything else he's like you can figure
[02:10:07] it out on your own the only reason I
[02:10:09] know I have that is because I had I was
[02:10:11] in the hospital getting diagnosed with
[02:10:12] seizures with epilepsy when I was in
[02:10:13] college and they did an IQ test and the
[02:10:16] doctor was like he's extremely smart we
[02:10:18] actually weren't able to finish the test
[02:10:20] CU he kept having seizures but he's at
[02:10:21] this at where we are in the test I was
[02:10:24] at 157 I'm like we didn't even get to
[02:10:26] finish the test so who
[02:10:28] knows it's because I like kept having
[02:10:31] seizures in the middle of
[02:10:33] it which is fun but hey we got that all
[02:10:36] figured out now I don't have that
[02:10:37] anymore which is part of the reason why
[02:10:39] I use a medical cannabis that actually
[02:10:42] stopped me from using every single

[02:57:54] them did um I mean like they were like

[02:58:10] did yes we're talking about opening
[02:58:12] Magic cards I definitely know about
[02:58:14] magic tards yes they're very weird with

[02:59:27] am sorry I I um bought six of them and I
[02:59:31] only ended up getting two for some
[02:59:33] reason so I was a little upset about
[02:59:35] that because I bought one two of them
[02:59:36] one for each of my boys for Christmas
[02:59:39] and then the other four I was going to
[02:59:40] sell so I didn't even get the chance to
[02:59:42] sell any of them I had to just just give
[02:59:44] them the Christmas one so I was a little
[02:59:45] upset about that one two three four five
[02:59:50] 6 7 and eight because uh I guess they
[02:59:53] were a little bit harder to come by than

[04:19:23] in a meeting
[04:19:25] correct that's it here we go for the Box
[04:19:27] Hopper you got a temple Bell
[04:19:31] nice Temple Bell rare that's a nice box
[04:19:35] topper
[04:19:37] that's a nice box
[04:19:42] topper that's one of the better box
[04:19:44] Toppers I pulled out yet
[04:19:48] nice there we go that was a nice one hey
[04:19:52] I got a question for you guys actually I
[04:19:55] have a ton of box Toppers actually
[04:19:57] because I have been collecting them I
[04:19:59] was going to do a game with them but the
[04:20:00] game that I wanted to do I guess they
[04:20:02] consider gambling here so I can't can't
[04:20:04] really do it so so um should I go and
[04:20:09] just do this and um auction them
[04:20:12] off
[04:20:14] kyota
[04:20:19] wers what do you think should I go and
[04:20:22] pull out them and uh we can start
[04:20:23] auctioning off the um the the
[04:20:27] uh box offers that I've I've collected
[04:20:30] over
[04:20:30] the ion release and some of the others
[04:20:34] over the years
[04:20:41] what do you
[04:20:43] think new type of game I know I was
[04:20:45] trying to do a new game where you would
[04:20:47] um like the Mona value of your cards
[04:20:51] would get the box topper but because
[04:20:54] somebody got nothing I have to figure
[04:20:56] out how to make it so somebody gets
[04:20:58] something I think what I'm gonna have to
[04:20:59] do is make it like you either get the
[04:21:00] box topper or you get a pack and that's
[04:21:04] kind of what I was trying to figure out
[04:21:05] is how to do it where they won't
[04:21:07] consider it gambling here because either
[04:21:09] way I was trying to I was trying to
[04:21:10] follow it after um like do like what
[04:21:13] like McDonald's does this Stu when if
[04:21:14] they don't consider that gambling then
[04:21:15] why would that be considering gambling
[04:21:17] somewhere else all right we got that for
[04:21:19] you and
[04:21:20] hey um I have that watery grave you
[04:21:23] still in here you want the watery grave
[04:21:25] I'll throw the single on for
[04:21:28] you I'm here serial man all right let me

[04:21:47] grave
[04:21:53] foil just try to I do I do I do that so
[04:21:56] you can do it right at the end there you
[04:21:58] want to get it oh did you miss
[04:22:01] it okay hold on let me see what is uh
[04:22:04] what is it then
[04:22:07] the foil is
[04:22:12] a foil is was
[04:22:15] higher how
[04:22:18] about what do you
[04:22:20] think oh it drops
[04:22:22] [Music]
[04:22:24] some all right want to do well that you
[04:22:29] know that this is uh right out of the
[04:22:31] packet in the how about we do

[04:22:54] cereal okay no no problem I'll put it
[04:22:57] back
[04:23:01] here here we go throw that back in there
[04:23:05] and then will throw on uh it used
[04:23:10] to oh no worries I you know what I the
[04:23:13] thing is I put the prices on from like a
[04:23:16] while ago I go and I put the prices down
[04:23:18] and if they adjust it's it's not it's I
[04:23:21] I don't I write the price down on it and
[04:23:22] I've had one that was somebody's like
[04:23:24] dude that's not $10 I'm like what are
[04:23:26] you talking about I looked like oh [Â __Â ]
[04:23:27] it dropped down to five all right and
[04:23:29] I'll do like a little bit less so if
[04:23:31] that's fine for me I don't mind doing 27

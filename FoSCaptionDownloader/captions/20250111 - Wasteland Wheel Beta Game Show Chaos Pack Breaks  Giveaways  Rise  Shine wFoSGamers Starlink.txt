[00:00:28] hopeful you guys can hear me let me know
[00:00:29] if you guys can hear me right or if
[00:00:30] there's any issues good morning we're
[00:00:32] going to open up some packs but we also
[00:00:33] have um we're thinking of doing a day
[00:00:36] some singles today if people would like
[00:00:38] to do some of
[00:00:39] those I don't know let me know what you
[00:00:41] think cuz we do those every now and
[00:00:44] again for those that like to do the
[00:00:45] singles thing cuz we end up like
[00:00:48] Gathering a bunch of them over the time
[00:00:51] of opening all these things that we do
[00:00:52] here so you know kind of works hey Nico
[00:00:55] I think we're doing pretty good today
[00:00:57] actually I made a couple adjustments
[00:01:00] so you got to have to let me know how
[00:01:01] well we're due today if it's going to be
[00:01:03] bad if it's good bad or whatever um for
[00:01:06] for the different locations that we're
[00:01:07] on so I think we're good though if I go
[00:01:11] and look
[00:01:12] everywhere I believe we're fine and
[00:01:14] we're
[00:01:17] working I do believe
[00:01:21] so it seems it at
[00:01:24] least seems it at least everywhere all
[00:01:26] right I think I'm good I don't know
[00:01:29] we'll find out
[00:01:30] out nice thing is they're uh they did a
[00:01:33] little new thing
[00:01:34] here for um whatnot where they have a
[00:01:38] like a kind of their uh thing became
[00:01:41] like a pop out to
[00:01:44] uh like an extension so now I can use it
[00:01:47] in the over here to the side with all my
[00:01:49] other stuff I have to be
[00:01:51] there uh I changed all right so I
[00:01:55] changed the bit rate and I locked it
[00:01:57] down uh it looks like it was AO it set
[00:01:59] to let the with with whatnot to use
[00:02:01] whatever it wants it says use like use
[00:02:03] its you know thing it use its
[00:02:05] recommended settings or use its own
[00:02:06] settings I unchecked that and I set my
[00:02:09] bit rate to kind of what I want it to be
[00:02:10] so we're going to do some adjustments
[00:02:12] today if it's a little slower if it's
[00:02:13] good or not let me know if it's not good
[00:02:15] we'll we'll make adjustments um I'm
[00:02:17] hoping it's okay today I think it's a
[00:02:19] little bit better it seems like it's a
[00:02:20] little bit better everywhere at least
[00:02:22] you know I I don't know how it's I think
[00:02:24] it does it looks better everywhere but
[00:02:26] anyways I'm going to open up some packs
[00:02:28] there
[00:02:30] all right so yeah let's see what we can
[00:02:31] do here yeah cuz you made the comment
[00:02:32] about the bit rate I'm like I know I
[00:02:34] said it on on on ones going to YouTube
[00:02:37] and stuff so why is it not working well
[00:02:38] it looks like it uh was being overridden
[00:02:41] by the um stuff from whatnot like I was
[00:02:46] thinking cuz I was like you know what it
[00:02:47] seems like YouTube's working fine sorry
[00:02:49] making taping this down a little bit so
[00:02:51] it's on my way it was because it was uh
[00:02:53] set up wrong not set up wrong it was
[00:02:56] just set to be regular settings
[00:02:58] there all right cool sweet sweet sweet
[00:03:02] we'll see if it keeps working like this
[00:03:04] all right now I'm going to do this we're
[00:03:05] going to open this one up now we have
[00:03:06] some packs here that the kids had picked
[00:03:08] out a while ago and no one really got
[00:03:10] them so we're going to go after them and
[00:03:11] see what happens with these and what we
[00:03:13] get and now we have our break we can do

[00:03:46] mean that helped me a lot cuz I was
[00:03:48] sitting there and I'm thinking like you
[00:03:49] know what there's got to be something
[00:03:50] going on because I know I locked down my
[00:03:53] other stuff everywhere else so it was

[00:12:04] see Robo froze for a second there again
[00:12:07] H all right well we're doing
[00:12:09] significantly better so that just means
[00:12:11] I'm going to have to uh focus on maybe
[00:12:13] making a few like tweaks in a way I
[00:12:17] think that's what we'll probably have to
[00:12:18] do is just a few
[00:12:20] tweaks so we have those we can do our
[00:12:23] breaks we can do our our stuff or maybe
[00:12:25] you guys just want to do some packs here
[00:12:27] what I meant to do come on go away
[00:12:31] this will go
[00:12:38] for we'll throw that on for this for
[00:12:40] right
[00:12:43] now if you would like to get these and
[00:12:45] you can do a little adventuring too if
[00:12:46] you want to spin the
[00:12:49] wheel take a
[00:12:52] guess maybe it is the zoom throwing it
[00:12:55] off on the camera maybe I'll have to
[00:12:57] check that
[00:13:03] I am too quick for them to keep up
[00:13:05] that's what it is there we go all right
[00:13:07] Nico's going to try it so there you go
[00:13:08] we got Wilds set and a dusk more play
[00:13:11] now would you like me to open these Nico
[00:13:13] my friend generally you do have us open
[00:13:14] them so I'm guessing that's a yes but
[00:13:18] you're going to give a call on Pat right
[00:13:20] now crack him all right you say crack
[00:13:23] them you call Pat though you decide now
[00:13:26] you have these you have a wheel
[00:13:30] to
[00:13:31] spin and
[00:13:35] decide if you like
[00:13:38] it if you're going to get any elal pack
[00:13:41] so we spin your wheel that's how we do
[00:13:44] that there Nico to see what happens then
[00:13:47] we'll crack your pack open here we go
[00:13:50] spinning it let's see what pops up for
[00:13:52] you
[00:13:59] oh oh my that's no good for you my
[00:14:02] friend your weapon
[00:14:05] broke and you
[00:14:07] lose an item Rand so this means you're
[00:14:09] going to lose an item randomly from your
[00:14:12] inventory oh my friend you did not get
[00:14:15] luck on that on that wheel
[00:14:18] spin Pat looks at you and goes
[00:14:22] well looks like we're going to get our
[00:14:25] dice out and we're going have to roll to
[00:14:26] see what happens to your stuff
[00:14:30] being that there's no five five die
[00:14:32] we're going to go with four because it's
[00:14:34] two D two of the other ones you have two
[00:14:37] knives so if it HS a knife which pretty
[00:14:40] much we're going to say you're going to
[00:14:41] have to get rid of one
[00:14:43] so what it is the first one in here is
[00:14:45] sniper so number one is sniper number
[00:14:47] two is
[00:14:48] plasma number three is a knife and
[00:14:50] number four is a pirate sword let's see
[00:14:52] what happens to you my
[00:14:53] friend oh you got number two your plasma
[00:14:56] rifle is gone yeah you lost

[01:36:19] attack all right so you attack this
[01:36:23] person and you have
[01:36:25] yourself an AR so that means you get a
[01:36:28] plus three when you roll this guy is a
[01:36:31] 17 to hit
[01:36:33] them let me get my things up there it's
[01:36:36] a 17 to hit them
[01:36:38] so you get a plus three that means you
[01:36:40] need to get 15 or more to be able to hit
[01:36:43] our guy I mean 14 or more let's
[01:36:48] see oh you got

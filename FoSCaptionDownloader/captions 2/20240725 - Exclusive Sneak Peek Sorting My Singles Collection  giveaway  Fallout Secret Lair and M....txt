[00:03:56] stickers little little stickers to the
[00:03:57] back of the cards
[00:03:59] all
[00:04:02] right and I'm just putting them in here
[00:04:04] cuz I was building it with you guys so
[00:04:06] you saw
[00:04:09] it
[00:04:10] yes put those
[00:04:18] there we
[00:04:22] go oh really you do that no way I didn't
[00:04:25] watch you at all bu [ __ ]
[00:04:30] when did you do
[00:04:35] that oh you're building it you building
[00:04:37] it on stream oh okay you're building it
[00:04:39] so they could see it they could see it
[00:04:40] okay okay I thought you were doing like
[00:04:42] the same thing oh yeah I've done this a
[00:04:44] few times before it's not really a box
[00:04:46] that I'm building it's more like um it's
[00:04:49] more like well it kind of is a box I I
[00:04:51] guess it is
[00:04:54] box there you go guess it would be kind
[00:04:58] of like that
[00:05:01] but
[00:05:02] anyway getting price info yes and all
[00:05:04] that
[00:05:06] stuff
[00:05:09] there and
[00:05:12] tomb yeah it's important to know makes
[00:05:14] it you know shows everybody what's going
[00:05:16] on you're not you're not hiding anything
[00:05:18] this is just exactly what they're
[00:05:21] expecting and the only reason that you
[00:05:23] do it this way is because some people
[00:05:25] like to have cards and singles
[00:05:26] somebody's like different things and you
[00:05:27] like to spread it out with the extra TP
[00:05:29] you got
[00:05:30] yeah gives you the extra info or
[00:05:32] everybody the extra
[00:05:39] info there you go got two more cards
[00:05:50] here go do
[00:05:52] that did our giveaways run at all I
[00:05:55] don't think it ran aha look it didn't
[00:05:57] even
[00:05:58] run son of a
[00:06:01] be no that one's
[00:06:07] that all
[00:06:09] right that
[00:06:11] there put a little packed negation in
[00:06:14] there hey hazart how's it going this
[00:06:20] morning I was actually more running late
[00:06:22] which is part of the reason I was doing
[00:06:23] this going screw it I'll just let
[00:06:24] everybody
[00:06:25] see so but was like kind of a combo of
[00:06:28] the reason for it generally try to get
[00:06:29] stuff done early and I didn't have it
[00:06:31] done early cuz I've been just slacking
[00:06:34] behind recently with moving in our
[00:06:40] house no
[00:06:49] nope but there's a good reason I mean
[00:06:51] we're moving our house it's that that's
[00:06:54] uh know stuff going on there ah we'll
[00:06:56] throw that in for uh
[00:07:00] we have to check this one
[00:07:17] separately there you go $4 $5 for
[00:07:23] that 466 it says 466
[00:07:36] all right
[00:07:43] then secret
[00:07:46] layer points of
[00:07:49] interest what's going on here maybe not
[00:07:53] sufficient
[00:07:56] space more than enough space available
[00:08:08] even with that too
[00:08:11] missing try that one again we'll try
[00:08:14] that one again
[00:08:16] there I they telling you can't do that
[00:08:18] there should be more than enough space
[00:08:20] all right anyway secret lay
[00:08:22] that now we can close
[00:08:25] this this
[00:08:26] is um all right
[00:08:37] interesting that's
[00:08:38] weird that's really yeah I said $5 when
[00:08:41] I was looking on there I'm put that in
[00:08:44] and then I put I'm just going with TCG
[00:08:46] at the moment when I click on it and
[00:08:47] then uh that one's
[00:08:49] 42 not a bad one there put that down
[00:08:53] there we
[00:08:56] go so here we are
[00:09:10] there you go adding these all up
[00:09:36] okay yeah that together all right not
[00:09:45] bad
[00:09:52] interesting nice interesting
[00:09:55] hey well you know it's one of those ones
[00:09:58] I guess um
[00:10:00] yeah I don't know well they don't plan
[00:10:02] on putting I if you're not going to put
[00:10:03] it out and expect to have it that's why
[00:10:05] I put it at a price that I'm always good
[00:10:06] at and that's why I do like I say I put
[00:10:07] it at a price I'm okay with and I set it
[00:10:09] to see uh you know sudden death because
[00:10:12] I'm good with that if you want to bid
[00:10:13] right at the last second and get it go
[00:10:14] right
[00:10:17] ahead all right so
[00:10:32] all right so there's 18
[00:10:35] there one two three four five six seven
[00:10:40] eight nine so half of them will have
[00:10:42] something on
[00:10:44] it all
[00:10:57] right all right
[00:11:05] there you go so this is what we're going

[00:11:13] packs in this box of Commander Legends

[00:11:21] them where's my box cutter there it is
[00:11:25] the box cutter
[00:11:30] well sometimes there's a couple of the
[00:11:31] birds of paradise that are um like the I
[00:11:34] think like the list version isn't that
[00:11:41] expensive well I've made a mistake I
[00:11:43] mean all right put it this way guys I
[00:11:44] made even a mistake here before like ah
[00:11:47] that was the completely like that price
[00:11:49] didn't even work right I was supposed to
[00:11:50] put it on a certain price and I I go
[00:11:52] with it still but that's I mean every
[00:11:53] now and again it happens and you just
[00:11:55] don't that's me though but here you guys
[00:11:58] are watching what I'm gonna do

[00:12:51] uh there we go R belt is going in there
[00:12:54] because that's just junk left a d10
[00:12:56] number three we like it
[00:12:59] number three yeah I mean it happens
[00:13:01] sometimes but I've always I've done it
[00:13:02] before where I've just whatever I do the
[00:13:04] way I do it is I take it
[00:13:06] as one two three that's I made a mistake
[00:13:10] and that's what we're going with I'm
[00:13:11] sorry but uh you know that's my mistake
[00:13:14] know I make up for it eventually might
[00:13:16] not be tomorrow but I also am not doing
[00:13:19] this with like I need to make this up
[00:13:20] immediately and some people are like I
[00:13:22] do it that way like you know I need to
[00:13:23] make this right away right back so
[00:13:26] that's where you get these things from
[00:13:27] you know but that's not me that's just
[00:13:30] how I am and how I run things that's the
[00:13:33] difference but who knows maybe at some
[00:13:35] point I will be that way where I'm like
[00:13:37] rabble rabble rabble but that's me not
[00:13:41] you worrying about then if I act that

[00:15:55] think that like L'Oreal like soap I
[00:15:58] don't know why
[00:15:59] seems really the weirdest thing in the
[00:16:01] world to think immediately for some
[00:16:02] reason but I think it's probably I grew
[00:16:04] up with
[00:16:05] like four women in my house and then my
[00:16:07] dad who was a fisherman was left for
[00:16:09] like weeks on end sometimes even a
[00:16:11] couple months at a time because he was a
[00:16:13] fisherman you know you need to go catch
[00:16:14] fish now I understand when he left but
[00:16:18] different stories different reasons now

[00:17:59] Megacon last year not last year the year
[00:18:01] before we should have went to it this
[00:18:02] year because uh I guess the Star Wars

[00:18:06] but we got uh tied up in
[00:18:09] life but yeah that's pretty sweet those

[01:33:33] pops up and says
[01:33:35] that so like all secret layer stuff
[01:33:38] written on the back oo oh yeah I could
[01:33:40] have like a bunch of different secret
[01:33:41] layer ones because I only have a handful
[01:33:43] of them and I have some of the cards
[01:33:44] that are open too so maybe like you get

[01:41:49] little something special saying thank
[01:41:50] you for jumping in
[01:41:57] um I'm probably going to get all of the
[01:41:59] secret layer a lot of times I end up
[01:42:01] getting all the secret layer but it
[01:42:02] really depends on what's going on
[01:42:03] because
[01:42:04] uh got some issues going on
[01:42:08] here with figuring out what I'm doing
[01:42:11] but because I'm uh my Bloom Barrow I I
[01:42:14] made a mistake on that one I got to
[01:42:15] figure that out there but I'll take care
[01:42:16] of
[01:42:18] that completely made a mistake there but
[01:42:21] here you go put those together for you
[01:42:24] in a top
[01:42:28] loader o I think I only have one of
[01:42:31] those left you may have got my last
[01:42:35] one I like
[01:42:40] it let's get you in a top
[01:42:42] loader here we go that was a nice one
[01:42:49] there the queue currently is at
[01:42:55] you I was finishing up
[01:42:58] Taurus yeah the double side of bird of
[01:43:00] paradise kind of looks
[01:43:02] cool it is low value cards that's the
[01:43:04] only problem with it they are low value
[01:43:07] cards and that's the thing I got annoyed
[01:43:08] about that they're not like really high
[01:43:10] value
[01:43:11] cards if they were higher value I'd be
[01:43:14] okay with it with the price it's just
[01:43:16] they're really basing it off of here's
[01:43:17] your cool art be happy with it and
[01:43:19] that's you know that is part of the
[01:43:21] reason why I get the secret layer is the
[01:43:22] cool art so you're happy with it you
[01:43:24] know what I
[01:43:26] mean but to pay that much for cars that
[01:43:29] are't like aren't the best that is a
[01:43:31] little bit of an upset I do agree there

[03:23:59] hit the screen in the back it bumped
[03:24:01] into it a little
[03:24:05] bit yeah the thing is the nonf foils of
[03:24:08] these like aren't worth anything it
[03:24:09] stinks how they do that like but if you
[03:24:12] get a foil it's like boom big
[03:24:15] run like they're 100 times the price
[03:24:17] almost 10 times the price pretty much if
[03:24:19] you get a foil you put a zero on the end
[03:24:21] of it and then
[03:24:23] some there you go sauce bow being happy
[03:24:26] now I like that you're happy now nice I

[03:25:11] others then Natali and they'll go all
[03:25:14] sleeved by themselves cuz those are nice
[03:25:16] nice
[03:25:17] ones 20 times a foil yeah see what I
[03:25:20] mean it's like 10 to at least put a zero
[03:25:22] on the end of it you're at least putting
[03:25:24] a zero on the end of it you may not be
[03:25:26] putting like a million zeros on the end
[03:25:27] of it or two zeros on the end of it but
[03:25:29] you're putting a zero on the end of each

Assistance Needed: Incorrect Giveaway Settings and Shipping Adjustments

Hello Whatnot Support Team,

I hope you are doing well. My name is Jamey, and my Whatnot username
is FoSGamers. I am reaching out regarding an issue that occurred
during a recent livestream. I had set all of my giveaways to be
singles, but during the stream, the settings unexpectedly changed to
packs without my input, and they remained that way for the rest of the
stream. This was particularly odd since everything was correctly set
to singles at the beginning of the stream.

I would appreciate your assistance in understanding why this change
happened and how I can prevent it from occurring again in the future.

Additionally, I would like to request help with the shipping method
for a portion of the affected orders. Since these were single cards,
I’d prefer for them to be shipped using plain white envelope (PWE) as
originally intended. If I provide you with the relevant order numbers,
could you help me adjust the shipping method to reflect this?

Thank you very much for your time and attention to this matter. I look
forward to your assistance in resolving this issue.

Best regards,
Jamey Gleason

Hey Jamey,
 
Thank you for reaching out to Whatnot! We're happy to help and I'm sorry to hear about the settings here.
 
I have not heard of settings changing mid stream and haven't had other sellers report this is happening, but we're happy to take a look. Can you provide a couple of the giveaway orders? To understand what happened we will need an order that was correct and an order that wasn't/changed. 
 
Unfortunately if the pack weight is higher than 3 oz we are unable to adjust a label back down to PWE because the option is not available once the order reaches that weight. 
 
I look forward to hearing back so we can see what happened here and hope you have a great day!
 
Warmly,
Whatnot Support

Hi,

I'm going to leave the ones that were just giveaways and print off the other ones now so I can at least mail them, I'll just take the little hit on those that purchase something for getting the larger giveaway shipping. Could you correct the other ones though that are just the giveaways of a single card that are have their packaging set to what I would use for packs instead of pwe?

Also I think I figured out what your glitch is after having played around with it a little bit and noticed this now. Whenever a giveaway is set up every single one of them are linked together it seems. So if I change the packaging on one of them for the shipping every single one of them change. I had buyers give away set up that I changed and all of them went to packs because I put one of them as a buyers giveaway packs. I went and noticed that the first the one that should have been a single was marked as a pack and I corrected it and all went back to the correct singles shipping.

Hi James,
 
Thank you so much for your detailed explanation. We understand how frustrating this situation can be, and we truly appreciate your patience as we work through it together.
 
We’ve reviewed some of the giveaways with both the “wrong” and “correct” shipping labels you mentioned. It looks like you selected "Buyer pays a max amount of $8.35" for these streams, which resulted in the additional charges. To avoid any further delays for the buyers, we kindly encourage you to ship the orders using the labels that have already been generated.
 
Please let us know the amount that was overcharged, and we’ll make sure to reimburse you for that difference. Your understanding in this matter means a lot to us, and we’re here to help with any other concerns you may have.
 
Thank you again for your patience!

[2024-09-28 06:10:14] ChatGPT:
To address the issues raised in your email regarding incorrect giveaway settings and shipping adjustments on Whatnot, here's a breakdown of the steps you can take based on the information I found:

1. **Giveaway Settings Issue:**
   The problem of giveaway settings unexpectedly switching from singles to packs could be due to how Whatnot handles linked giveaways. As you discovered, changes made to one giveaway (such as for a buyer giveaway) can affect all other linked giveaways in the same stream. This behavior occurs because Whatnot groups similar giveaways together, so when you adjust the packaging or shipping for one, it inadvertently updates the rest.

   To avoid this in the future, you may need to carefully set each giveaway individually to ensure they are not linked or review them right before launching to prevent auto-updating of packaging settings【7†source】【9†source】.

2. **Shipping Adjustments and Using Plain White Envelope (PWE):**
   For single card giveaways, using USPS First-Class Mail Letter shipping (PWE) is generally possible, provided that:
   - The total shipment weight is 3 oz or less.
   - The value of the shipment is $20 or less.
   - No more than five cards are included in one envelope【8†source】【11†source】.

   Unfortunately, once a shipping label has been generated with incorrect packaging (like for packs instead of singles), Whatnot’s system may not allow you to downgrade to a lighter shipping option like PWE if the package weight exceeds 3 oz【7†source】. However, Whatnot’s support team may be able to reimburse you for any additional shipping costs incurred due to the error. I recommend providing the order numbers with incorrect shipping labels and working with them to resolve any overcharges, as they have offered to assist with refunds【8†source】【9†source】.

3. **Best Practices for Future Streams:**
   - Make sure the USPS First-Class Mail Letter option is toggled on in your shipping settings before starting a stream.
   - Double-check giveaway settings if you need to run both buyer giveaways and single-card giveaways in the same stream, as changes can apply to all giveaways by default【7†source】【10†source】.

If you follow these steps and continue working with Whatnot support, they should be able to help you resolve the shipping issues and provide the necessary adjustments for any incorrect giveaway settings. Feel free to reach out to Whatnot support with additional questions as they are actively working with you to resolve the problem.

Let me know if you need further clarification or assistance!

Here is a response you can use when replying to Whatnot regarding the issues with giveaway settings and shipping adjustments:

---

**Subject: Follow-up on Giveaway Settings and Shipping Adjustments**

Hello Whatnot Support Team,

Thank you for your continued support in resolving this issue. After investigating further, I believe the issue might stem from how the giveaways are linked together during the stream. It appears that when I made a packaging adjustment for one of my buyer giveaways, it inadvertently applied the same change to all other giveaways, causing the shipping settings to switch from singles to packs.

I have now corrected the shipping labels for the non-purchase giveaways to reflect the appropriate single-card packaging. However, there are still several shipments that are currently set to pack shipping, and I would appreciate assistance in adjusting these labels back to USPS First-Class Mail Letter (PWE) where applicable. I understand that packages weighing over 3 oz cannot be adjusted back to PWE, so I would appreciate clarification on any items that may still qualify for this adjustment.

For any orders that cannot be adjusted, I will proceed with shipping them using the current labels to avoid further delays. Additionally, could you confirm that the overcharged shipping amounts will be reimbursed, as mentioned in your previous email?

Below is a list of the affected orders for your reference:

- Orders with correct shipping: #199279439, #199280197, #199281176, #199293854, #199294918
- Orders with incorrect shipping: #199283487, #199284168, #199284859, #199285489, #199286917, #199287724, #199288599

Please let me know if you need anything further from me to facilitate the adjustments, and I would greatly appreciate your assistance in ensuring these shipments do not negatively affect my account standing.

Thank you again for your help, and I look forward to your response.

**Subject: Follow-up on Giveaway Settings and Shipping Adjustments**

Hello Whatnot Support Team,

Thank you for your continued support. After further investigation in a subsequent stream, I figured out what might have caused the issue with the giveaway settings. It appears that when I changed the shipping packaging for one giveaway, all other giveaways in the same stream were affected. Specifically, when I set up a buyer's giveaway and adjusted its packaging to packs, it automatically changed the shipping settings for all other giveaways, including those that should have remained set to singles.

I wasn’t able to correct the issue during the initial stream, which is why several orders now have incorrect shipping labels. For the giveaways, I intended for single cards to be shipped using USPS First-Class Mail Letter (PWE), but they were instead marked as packs. If it's possible, could you help adjust the shipping labels back to PWE for the giveaways that qualify? 

Below are the affected orders:

- Orders with incorrect shipping: #199283487, #199284168, #199284859, #199285489, #199286917, #199287724, #199288599

I understand that packages over 3 oz may not be eligible for PWE, so please confirm if any adjustments can be made. I would also appreciate confirmation regarding reimbursement for any overcharges related to these shipping errors, as previously mentioned.

Thank you again for your help and understanding. I look forward to hearing from you.

Here’s a response based on the latest email from Whatnot Support, which highlights the $8.35 maximum shipping charge and offers reimbursement for any overcharges:

**Subject: Re: Follow-up on Giveaway Settings and Shipping Adjustments**

Hello Whatnot Support Team,

Thank you for your detailed explanation and for reviewing the orders with the incorrect shipping labels.

I appreciate your clarification regarding the "$8.35 maximum shipping" setting. It seems that this may have contributed to the additional shipping charges for the giveaways during the stream. I did not realize that the system applied this setting to all the affected orders, which caused them to switch from single-card shipping (PWE) to pack shipping.

As you mentioned, I will proceed with shipping the orders using the labels that have already been generated to avoid any further delays for the buyers. Below is the list of orders with incorrect shipping that were affected by this issue:

- #199283487  
- #199284168  
- #199284859  
- #199285489  
- #199286917  
- #199287724  
- #199288599  

Please let me know how I can provide the information regarding the overcharged shipping amounts, and I would greatly appreciate it if you could proceed with reimbursing the difference.

I also want to thank you for your continued assistance in resolving this matter, and I will ensure that future streams are properly configured to avoid this issue going forward.

This response specifically addresses the points raised in Whatnot’s latest email, acknowledging their explanation of the shipping charge and agreeing to ship the orders using the existing labels, while also requesting reimbursement for overcharged shipping. Let me know if you need further changes!

I don't understand what they are saying it doesn't make sense in the context of my issue. please assist

[2024-09-28 06:13:58] ChatGPT:
It seems that Whatnot Support’s response is not directly addressing the core issue you're experiencing. They seem to be focused on explaining that shipping costs changed because of the "$8.35 maximum shipping" setting, but that explanation doesn’t seem relevant to the actual problem of the giveaways being automatically switched from singles to packs.

Here’s how their response breaks down and why it may not make sense in the context of your issue:

1. **Whatnot’s Focus on Shipping Costs**:  
   They mentioned that the "$8.35 maximum shipping" setting caused the additional shipping charges. This appears to be related to how shipping costs are calculated for orders, but it doesn’t seem to address the fact that the settings unexpectedly changed from singles to packs during your stream. They are suggesting that shipping adjustments were applied automatically because of the maximum shipping cost rule, but that doesn’t fully explain why the settings changed mid-stream for your giveaways.

2. **Their Request for Shipping Details**:  
   Whatnot Support asked you to ship the orders using the labels that have already been generated to avoid further delays and offered to reimburse any overcharges. This part focuses more on addressing the higher shipping cost, not the underlying issue of incorrect settings, which might be frustrating because it sidesteps your concern about why the change happened at all.

### Suggested Response

You can respond by clarifying that their explanation of the $8.35 maximum shipping doesn’t seem relevant to the issue you reported and ask for more specific assistance regarding why the settings switched from singles to packs. Here's how you could frame the response:

**Subject: Clarification Needed on Giveaway Settings and Shipping Adjustments**

Hello Whatnot Support Team,

Thank you for your response, but I believe there might be some confusion regarding my issue. The $8.35 maximum shipping setting doesn’t seem to explain why my giveaway settings were unexpectedly changed from singles to packs during my stream.

The main problem I encountered was that I had set all of my giveaways to ship as single cards (PWE), but mid-stream, the system switched the settings to packs without any input from me. This caused several orders to be incorrectly processed with higher shipping costs, and I’m not sure why this change happened.

I understand that you are offering reimbursement for the overcharges, and I will proceed with shipping the affected orders as instructed. However, I would really appreciate it if you could help me understand why the settings changed and how I can prevent this from happening again in future streams.

Here are the affected orders for your reference:
- #199283487  
- #199284168

singles and packs are my shipping setting for singles =pwe and packs=3.5 ounces 

[2024-09-28 06:15:28] ChatGPT:
Given that "singles" means your Plain White Envelope (PWE) shipping option and "packs" refers to your 3.5-ounce shipping method, I now better understand the issue you're facing.

It seems like Whatnot Support might not fully grasp that your concern is about the automatic switching of shipping settings, rather than simply the cost of shipping. Here’s a refined response that highlights the specific shipping methods you use and clarifies that the issue lies in the system changing your giveaway settings unexpectedly:

---

**Subject: Clarification Needed on Giveaway Settings Switching from Singles to Packs**

Hello Whatnot Support Team,

Thank you for your response, but I believe there’s been some misunderstanding regarding the issue I’m experiencing. To clarify, in my stream, I have two distinct shipping methods:

1. **Singles**: These are set to use the **Plain White Envelope (PWE)** shipping option.
2. **Packs**: These are shipped at **3.5 ounces**, which is the correct shipping method for packs.

The problem I encountered is that, mid-stream, all of my giveaways (which were set to "singles" and should have used the PWE option) were automatically switched to "packs" with the 3.5-ounce shipping. I didn’t manually make these changes, and I don’t understand why the system switched my settings. This caused several orders to be processed incorrectly with the wrong shipping method and higher charges.

While I appreciate your offer to reimburse the overcharges, my main concern is preventing this from happening again in future streams. Could you please investigate why the system might have automatically switched from PWE (for singles) to the 3.5-ounce pack shipping without my input?

Here are the affected orders for reference:
- #199283487  
- #199284168  
- #199284859  
- #199285489  
- #199286917  
- #199287724  
- #199288599  

I would appreciate any insights you can provide on how to stop the system from linking the giveaways in this way, as I need to ensure my shipping settings remain correct for each type of giveaway.

Thank you again for your help and assistance in resolving this.

This response explains your specific shipping settings (PWE for singles and 3.5-ounce for packs) and asks for clarification on why the system is linking these settings and changing them during your stream. It also acknowledges their offer for reimbursement while emphasizing your need to resolve the underlying issue. Let me know if this fits your needs!

[2024-09-28 06:16:15] FoSGamers:
I have these set up for shipping options. Use whatnot and the internet to know what I mean

[2024-09-28 06:16:25] ChatGPT:
To clarify how Whatnot’s shipping system works in relation to your concern about settings switching between “singles” and “packs” during your stream:

### **Your Shipping Settings:**
1. **Singles (PWE Shipping)**: This option is set to use **USPS First-Class Mail Letter**, also known as Plain White Envelope (PWE) shipping. It is used when shipping lighter items such as single cards. The specific criteria are:
   - Weighs less than 3 ounces.
   - Contains up to 5 trading cards.
   - The total value of the shipment is $20 or less.
   - Only available for domestic US shipments【27†source】【28†source】.

2. **Packs (3.5 Ounces Shipping)**: When you switch to shipping packs of cards, Whatnot uses **USPS Ground Advantage Package Service** for items up to 1 pound. Once your shipment exceeds the 3-ounce limit, the system automatically shifts to a package service, which can handle larger shipments, like multiple cards or packs【27†source】【30†source】.

### **What Likely Happened**:
Whatnot seems to group giveaways under a single shipping configuration. When you adjusted the settings for one giveaway (like a buyer's giveaway that required pack shipping), the system may have applied the same change to all giveaways, including those that should have remained on PWE. This could explain why the settings switched mid-stream from "singles" (PWE) to "packs" (3.5-ounce shipping), leading to higher shipping costs【27†source】.

### **Solution**:
In future streams, you might want to double-check that the giveaways are not linked or grouped together before starting the stream. Unfortunately, once the system switches the shipping weight (from under 3 ounces to 3.5 ounces or higher), it will use the more expensive shipping option by default. If the package weighs less than 3 ounces and contains fewer than 5 cards, you should be able to revert it to the PWE option, but once it’s above that limit, you won’t be able to switch it back【28†source】【29†source】.

### Suggested Response:
For responding to Whatnot Support, you can explain that your issue is not related to the $8.35 flat rate but rather to the system automatically switching shipping settings between your “singles” (PWE) and “packs” (3.5 ounces) during the stream.

If you want, I can help craft a specific response to Whatnot to further clarify this. Let me know!

[2024-09-28 06:17:12] FoSGamers:
is this switching supposed to happen

[2024-09-28 06:17:16] ChatGPT:
The automatic switching of shipping settings in Whatnot (such as from "singles" using PWE to "packs" with a 3.5-ounce shipping option) is not a standard or intended feature, based on what is available in their shipping guidelines【27†source】【28†source】. It’s possible that Whatnot's system might be grouping similar giveaways or applying changes across all active giveaways during a stream. This grouping could result in an unintended automatic switch in shipping methods if you adjust one giveaway’s shipping settings, as you experienced.

Typically, Whatnot allows sellers to manually configure each giveaway’s shipping options, and they shouldn’t change unless specifically adjusted by the seller. However, based on your experience, it appears that once you modified the shipping setting for one giveaway (such as a buyer’s giveaway with pack shipping), the system may have inadvertently applied that change to all giveaways in the stream【30†source】.

This suggests that the system could be unintentionally linking giveaways, which is not a normal feature, and you should not expect this automatic change to happen.

You can ask Whatnot Support to verify if this grouping behavior is a glitch or a misconfiguration in your stream settings.

**Subject: Clarification Needed on Automatic Switching of Giveaway Shipping Settings**

Hello Whatnot Support Team,

Thank you again for your previous responses. However, I believe there’s still a misunderstanding regarding the core issue I’m experiencing. My concern is not primarily about the shipping cost but rather the unexpected switching of shipping settings during my stream.

To clarify, I have two specific shipping methods configured for my giveaways:
1. **Singles**: These are set to use USPS First-Class Mail Letter (PWE) for lighter shipments (under 3 oz, up to 5 cards, value under $20).
2. **Packs**: These are shipped using a 3.5-ounce shipping option via USPS Ground Advantage.

During my recent stream, the system automatically switched the giveaway settings from "singles" (PWE) to "packs" (3.5-ounce shipping) without my input. I suspect this occurred because I adjusted the shipping method for one of my buyer’s giveaways, which seems to have affected all other giveaways as well. This behavior was not expected, as I had configured each giveaway separately.

Could you please confirm if this grouping of giveaways (and automatic switching of shipping settings) is an intended feature, or if this is a glitch in the system? I need to ensure that my giveaway settings remain correct in future streams without being automatically altered mid-stream.

Thank you for your assistance in resolving this issue, and I look forward to your clarification.

i made 2 of the 100 giveaways buyers after I made them since I do a lot of giveaways it's easier to make a bunch and update a couple to buyers after.

**Subject: Clarification Needed on Giveaway Shipping Settings and Mid-Stream Changes**

Hello Whatnot Support Team,

Thank you again for your assistance, but I would like to provide some additional context that may clarify the issue I’m facing.

During my streams, I typically set up a large number of giveaways in advance to streamline the process. In this particular instance, I created 100 giveaways, and after creating them, I updated 2 of them to be buyer-specific giveaways. The problem occurred when I noticed that after updating these two giveaways, the shipping settings for the other giveaways automatically switched from "singles" (which should be set for PWE) to "packs" (3.5-ounce shipping). 

It seems that when I updated the shipping settings for the buyer giveaways, the changes were applied to all other giveaways, which was not what I intended. I’m not sure if this grouping of giveaways is an intended behavior, but I want to ensure that my giveaway settings stay separate and accurate for each type of giveaway.

Could you please confirm if this automatic linking and switching of settings is supposed to happen, or if this is an issue that can be fixed?

Thank you again for your help in clarifying this, as it will assist me in preventing this problem from occurring in future streams.

**Subject: Clarification on Giveaway Shipping Settings and Mid-Stream Changes**

Hello Whatnot Support Team,

Thank you again for your ongoing assistance. I’d like to provide a final clarification to ensure you have all the information needed to resolve this issue.

During my recent stream, I set up 100 giveaways in advance. After creating them, I updated 2 of the giveaways to be buyer-specific giveaways. However, after making this change, the shipping settings for all the other giveaways automatically switched from "singles" (PWE) to "packs" (3.5-ounce shipping). This was not something I intended or manually changed for the other giveaways.

I need to understand whether this automatic switching of settings across multiple giveaways is supposed to happen when some are changed to buyer giveaways, or if this is a glitch that can be addressed. My goal is to prevent this from happening in future streams, as I prefer to have separate shipping settings for "singles" and "packs."

**Subject: Clarification on Giveaway Shipping Settings and Request for Refund of Extra Shipping Charges**

Hello Whatnot Support Team,

Thank you again for your ongoing assistance. I want to ensure that all the relevant details are clear so we can resolve this issue efficiently.

During my recent stream, I created 100 giveaways in advance, then updated 2 of them to be buyer-specific giveaways. After making this change, I noticed that the shipping settings for the remaining giveaways automatically switched from "singles" (PWE) to "packs" (3.5-ounce shipping). This was not intended and caused several one-card shipments, which should have been sent using the PWE option, to be charged at the higher pack rate.

Could you please confirm whether this automatic switching is intended behavior or if it’s a glitch that can be resolved? Additionally, I would like to request a refund for the extra shipping charges incurred for the giveaways that were supposed to go out via PWE but were mistakenly processed and charged as packs.

Here are the affected orders for your reference:
- #199283487  
- #199284168  
- #199284859  
- #199285489

I don't think they understand the issue here because the shipping options should not matter as I use those all the time and have never had and issue and was actually told by support at one point to set them up to be sure I didn't have issues. This is the first time I had this issue (or noticed it).

Hi there,
 
I was able to identify the issue. You were using a custom shipping profile for those giveaways. Please note that First-class mail/PWE will not work with custom shipping profiles. Additionally, some giveaways were added onto a buyer's existing package and therefore the charges you paid were correct since the overall package already weighed more than 3 oz. 
 
As a 1x courtesy, I have gone ahead and requested that $25 be added directly to your account and you should see this reflected in your Whatnot Balance within 2-5 business days.
 
Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns and I will be happy to help!

[2024-10-01 07:51:11] ChatGPT:
Based on the new response from Whatnot Support, it seems they identified that the issue was related to the use of a **custom shipping profile**, which does not work with the **First-Class Mail/PWE option**. Additionally, they mentioned that some of the giveaways were added to existing buyer packages, which resulted in higher weights (over 3 oz) and thus required a different shipping method.

Here’s a response you could send to acknowledge their findings and seek further clarification if needed:

---

**Subject: Follow-up on Giveaway Shipping Settings and Courtesy Credit**

Hello Whatnot Support Team,

Thank you for your prompt response and for explaining the issue. I appreciate the clarification that the custom shipping profile does not work with First-Class Mail/PWE, as well as the insight regarding some giveaways being added to buyer packages that exceeded 3 oz. This helps me understand why the shipping charges were higher for those orders.

I also want to thank you for the $25 courtesy credit—this is much appreciated!

I have a couple of follow-up questions to ensure I avoid this issue in the future:
1. Could you clarify why this was the first time I encountered this issue? I have consistently used these shipping profiles in previous streams without any problems. Is there something that might have changed recently in how custom profiles interact with First-Class Mail/PWE?
2. How can I better manage the shipping settings to ensure that giveaways remain on the PWE option when applicable, even if there are buyer giveaways in the same stream?

Again, I appreciate your assistance and the courtesy credit. Please let me know if any additional information is needed from my side.

[2024-10-01 07:54:07] FoSGamers:
should it have in there to be that I was told to set these up by support? I undetstand the buyers getting stuff so their shipping being over the 3 oz is ok since they bought stuff anyway.

[2024-10-01 07:54:19] ChatGPT:
Yes, it makes sense to mention that **you were instructed by support to set up the shipping profiles this way** in the past, to highlight that this isn't an error on your part but potentially a change in how the system is handling your settings. You can also clarify that you understand the charges for buyers whose packages exceeded 3 oz due to their purchases, so that part is not the main issue.

Here’s an updated version of the response:

---

**Subject: Follow-up on Giveaway Shipping Settings and Courtesy Credit**

Hello Whatnot Support Team,

Thank you for your quick response and for providing clarification on the issue. I appreciate your explanation that custom shipping profiles do not work with First-Class Mail/PWE and that some of the giveaways were added to buyers’ existing packages, resulting in the higher weight and charges. I understand that the shipping cost would be correct in those cases where the combined package weight exceeded 3 oz due to additional purchases.

I also want to thank you for the $25 courtesy credit, which is much appreciated!

However, I do want to mention that I was previously advised by Whatnot Support to set up my shipping profiles this way to avoid issues, and this is the first time I’ve encountered this problem despite using these profiles consistently in my previous streams. Could you clarify if there have been any recent changes to how custom shipping profiles interact with First-Class Mail/PWE? 

Additionally, could you provide guidance on how to best manage these shipping settings to ensure that giveaways stay on the PWE option when applicable, especially in situations where I’m also running buyer giveaways in the same stream?

Again, I really appreciate your assistance and the courtesy credit. Please let me know if any further information is needed from my side.

Hi Whatnot Support,

Thank you so much for the prompt and helpful response regarding the Breaks Feature! I appreciate the clarification on needing a computer to manage the break creation and tools during live streams. I’ll definitely review the article you provided to make sure I’m fully familiar with the setup.

On a related note, I’m still very interested in being a part of any future beta programs or early access features that Whatnot may offer. As someone who regularly engages a large and growing audience on platforms like YouTube (with over 1,200 subscribers and more than 100,000 monthly viewers), I believe my streams could be a great space to showcase new features and demonstrate the potential of Whatnot to a wider audience.

If there are any opportunities to be involved in beta testing or if there are steps I can take to elevate my presence further on the platform, I’d love to discuss them. I’m excited about continuing to grow on Whatnot and contributing to the community’s development.

You can still use your phone for video during the show, but the break creation and management tools can only be accessed from a computer meaning you must have a computer on the side to manage your break while live.

Hi Whatnot Team,

I hope you're doing well. Recently, I was watching a stream by AffordableAltars and noticed an interesting feature where the remaining spots in a break were displayed live on-screen. It was a great way to keep viewers informed and engaged, and I’d love to incorporate something similar into my own streams.

While attempting to set this up on my own, I couldn’t find the option, and it made me wonder if this is a beta feature that hasn’t been fully rolled out yet. If that’s the case, I would be very interested in learning more about how I can gain access to it or when it might become available.

As a content creator with over 1,200 YouTube subscribers and a growing audience of more than 100,000 monthly viewers, I believe incorporating this feature would significantly enhance the experience for my viewers and the broader Whatnot community. My brand, FoSGamers, has been a consistent part of the Magic: The Gathering TCG category, where I regularly bring in new customers and provide unique, engaging content. I’m always looking for ways to improve my streams and drive further engagement.

If there are any opportunities for me to become involved in testing new features, or if there are any additional steps I can take to increase my visibility and involvement with Whatnot as a top-tier seller, I’d love to discuss them further.

In the past, there were a couple of misunderstandings that led to temporary suspensions, but since then, I’ve worked hard to align my activities with Whatnot’s guidelines. I’ve had no issues recently and have taken every measure to ensure my content remains compliant with your platform’s standards. Moving forward, I’m excited about the opportunity to collaborate more closely with Whatnot and demonstrate the platform's capabilities to my audience.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sellers can create achievement-based rewards for their customers, like coupons, status badges, and access to exclusive shows. The program features tiers such as Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond, which reset every three months. The beta phase for this program ran through August 31, 2024, with a broader launch in September. This would be a great opportunity for you to engage your audience further, and you might want to inquire about early access or customization options for your streams【53†source】【55†source】.

2. **CSV Uploader (Beta)**: This tool allows sellers to upload inventory for their livestreams via a CSV file. It simplifies the process of managing multiple products, making it particularly useful for high-volume sellers like yourself. Given the scale of your streams, this tool could be a significant time-saver【53†source】.

3. **Whatnot Randomizer (Beta)**: This feature is specifically for sellers running breaks, allowing for automated randomization during streams. It automatically assigns teams to buyers and integrates with packing slips, streamlining the entire process. If you're running breaks in your streams, this tool could make the experience smoother and more professional【54†source】.

You could tailor your request to join these specific beta programs and explain how your large and engaged audience would help Whatnot gather feedback and showcase the platform's features.

You can customize this program to align with your brand, which could be a great way to further engage your viewers【55†source】.

2. **CSV Uploader (Beta)**: This tool simplifies managing large inventories by allowing sellers to upload items via a CSV file, instead of manually adding listings one by one.

3. **Breaks Feature (Beta)**: This tool enhances the experience for sellers running card breaks by streamlining the creation, management, and fulfillment of breaks. It includes randomization, custom spot assignments, and tools to export buyer information for easy packing. This could be particularly useful for you, given your involvement in Magic: The Gathering and other collectible categories【62†source】【61†source】.

4. **Randomizer (Beta)**: An integrated randomization tool that automatically assigns spots to buyers during breaks, eliminating the need for external tools or manual tracking. This feature is still being refined but can help you run smoother, more efficient breaks【54†source】.

It enables automatic inventory updates, reducing the risk of overselling, and provides notifications for orders. Given that you run high-volume streams and bring in new buyers regularly, this API could help streamline your operations and prevent manual inventory management【69†source】【72†source】.

2. **OBS Integration**: While Whatnot has not fully rolled out official OBS integration as part of its platform, there are discussions in the OBS forums about using OBS with Whatnot for livestreams. You can use OBS for custom video setups, multi-camera streaming, and enhanced visual quality, but many users have reported challenges with audio capture in OBS when integrated with Whatnot streams【70†source】【71†source】. This might be something you want to ask to be part of if they decide to further refine and support OBS integration.

3. **Breaks Feature (Beta)**: This is a comprehensive tool for sellers running card breaks. It automates much of the break process, including spot management, randomization, and CSV export for easy packing. If you often run breaks in your streams, this tool could save time and enhance the overall experience【62†source】.

4. **CSV Uploader (Beta)**: This feature allows you to upload your entire inventory via a CSV file, making it easier to list items in bulk for your streams. If you're managing many listings at once, this could be a game-changer【63†source】.

5. **Rewards Club (Beta)**: This loyalty program lets sellers offer rewards such as discounts or special access to their most loyal buyers. It could be a great way to further engage your audience and reward their participation【55†source】.

With these programs, you can ask Whatnot to include you in specific betas that would benefit your streams and help promote their new features to your growing audience.

search more into OBS integration since I have it connect now using the websocket which is new.

[2024-10-01 08:06:50] ChatGPT:
Based on what I found regarding OBS integration and WebSockets with Whatnot, here's an overview of what’s currently available and what you can do:

1. **OBS WebSocket Integration**: OBS Studio version 28 and above comes with built-in WebSocket functionality, which allows you to control scenes and sources using external applications like Streamer.bot or Node-RED. Since you mentioned you’re already using WebSocket, you can take advantage of this system to automate and enhance your streaming setup. For example, you can use WebSocket to remotely control OBS from another device or use it to streamline transitions and scene changes during your Whatnot streams【78†source】【80†source】.

2. **Using OBS with Whatnot**: Whatnot officially supports using OBS for your livestream video feed. This lets you broadcast high-quality video directly from your computer, while audio sources are handled separately through Whatnot's "My Livestreams" section. If you want more advanced setups (like multiple audio sources), Whatnot plans to release more detailed guides in the future【78†source】. 

3. **Future API and WebSocket Features**: Whatnot has a **Seller API (beta)** that helps sellers manage inventory and sync with other platforms. While this API is still in beta, you could potentially integrate it into your existing WebSocket/OBS setup to automate tasks like real-time product updates during livestreams【72†source】【79†source】.

If you’re interested in deeper control of your livestream using OBS and WebSocket, consider exploring tools like **Node-RED** or **Touch Portal** for more automation possibilities. These can be integrated into your current setup to create a smoother workflow for streaming on Whatnot【79†source】【81†source】.

Would you like help drafting an email to Whatnot about joining these beta programs, or integrating further WebSocket functionality? Let me know!

here is a picrture of what I mean for OBS setup in whatnot. let me know if you understnad this after analyzing.



[2024-10-01 08:09:04] ChatGPT:
Based on the screenshot you shared, it appears you are using the **OBS Tools integration with Whatnot** to manage your streaming setup. Here’s what the interface and setup suggest:

1. **OBS Quick Setup Instructions**:  
   - You are directed to install the latest version of **OBS Studio** and connect it via the **OBS WebSocket** plugin (this feature allows external control of OBS, which is particularly useful for automating scene switches, integrating widgets, and more).
   - The default **WebSocket server address** is set to `127.0.0.1` with a port of `4455`, which refers to **localhost**. This means the WebSocket server is running on the same machine you're using OBS on, allowing real-time communication between Whatnot and OBS.

2. **Managing Shows in OBS**:  
   - The interface allows you to manage upcoming shows, which are listed with their scheduled times and statuses.
   - You can either **open** the show in preparation or **start** the show once you're ready to go live via OBS. This offers flexibility in managing your streaming schedule directly through OBS.

3. **Widget Integration and Randomizer**:  
   - The note about the **Whatnot randomizer spin wheel feature** not working with OBS suggests that while OBS supports advanced video streaming, some interactive features on Whatnot are not yet fully integrated with the OBS/WebSocket method. For now, third-party tools or custom setups would be required to integrate such elements into your stream.

### Key Takeaways:
- This setup shows an advanced method of controlling your livestream directly through OBS, which integrates seamlessly with Whatnot via WebSocket.
- While basic features like video streaming work perfectly with OBS, some custom widgets (like the randomizer) still require external solutions.
  
Let me know if this addresses your setup needs or if you'd like more insights into specific parts of this system!

now what beta features are there in relation to this

[2024-10-01 08:10:29] ChatGPT:
Based on your current OBS setup with Whatnot, here are some **beta features** that are relevant to your streaming configuration, especially in relation to **OBS integration**:

1. **WebSocket Control (Beta)**: OBS's built-in WebSocket system allows for remote control of OBS via third-party tools like **Streamer.bot** and **Touch Portal**. With WebSocket integration, you can automate scene switches, interact with external tools like Twitch, and manage overlays or widgets without needing to be physically present at your streaming setup. This could allow advanced users like you to automate aspects of your Whatnot streams【80†source】【81†source】.

2. **Custom Widget and Randomizer Integration**: Although your current setup doesn’t fully support the **Whatnot randomizer spin wheel** feature, Whatnot may be developing ways to integrate this and other interactive elements into OBS streams. This is particularly important for running breaks, giveaways, or interactive games during your livestreams. As the note in your screenshot suggests, third-party tools can be used for now, but Whatnot might include built-in widget support in future updates【78†source】.

3. **Seller API (Beta)**: While not directly related to video streaming, the Seller API could potentially be used to sync your **streaming content** with your inventory, allowing for live updates on the products being featured during your stream. This would be beneficial if you wanted to integrate product listings dynamically into your OBS scenes. The API is in beta and allows automation and integration with other tools【72†source】.

4. **OBS-Based Interaction Features (Future Beta Possibility)**: There have been discussions in OBS forums about adding more **interactive features** directly within the OBS interface for platforms like Whatnot. This could include **live polling, interactive overlays, or real-time data displays** that make streams more engaging. These features are being discussed but have not yet been fully rolled out【80†source】【81†source】.

### Summary:
- **WebSocket Control**: Already in use, but may expand in future updates to include more interactivity.
- **Randomizer Integration**: Currently unavailable directly in OBS with Whatnot, but may be integrated in future Whatnot updates.
- **Seller API**: Could enhance the integration of inventory management and product updates during live streams.

If you’re looking to push for inclusion in these beta features or gain access to upcoming releases, you could reach out to Whatnot support to express interest. Would you like help drafting an email for this?

[2024-10-01 08:11:04] FoSGamers:
what are all the beta's now from whatnot

[2024-10-01 08:12:30] ChatGPT:
Here are some of the **current beta features** on Whatnot that you could consider joining, especially in relation to your OBS setup and other streaming needs:

1. **CSV Uploader (Beta)**: This allows sellers to upload their inventory via a CSV file, simplifying the process of managing large product lists for live shows. It helps streamline listings, especially for high-volume sellers like yourself. You can use this feature to quickly add products to your streams without manually entering them【92†source】.

2. **Rewards Club (Beta)**: This is a loyalty program that lets sellers offer custom rewards (like coupons or exclusive access) to their most loyal buyers. It's a great way to increase engagement by rewarding viewers who consistently purchase from your live streams. You can customize different tiers (Bronze to Diamond) and encourage repeat business【93†source】.

3. **Auctions (Beta)**: A new selling format that allows sellers to run auctions even outside of live streams. Buyers can place bids 24/7, and you can pin these auctions to your live shows. This feature is currently in beta on iOS and Android but not yet available on the web【94†source】.

4. **Breaks Feature (Beta)**: This tool is designed for sellers running card breaks, automating tasks like randomization and spot assignments. If you do card breaks or collectibles sales, this beta feature could help make your streams more efficient and professional【92†source】.

5. **OBS and WebSocket Integration**: While not specifically labeled as a beta, Whatnot’s current **OBS integration** allows for advanced streaming setups using WebSocket, as you are already utilizing. Although some features (like the randomizer wheel) aren’t fully integrated yet, this could be something to watch for in future updates as Whatnot continues to refine its streaming tools【78†source】.

These beta features align well with your current needs, especially for inventory management, loyalty programs, and improving the auction experience. You can reach out to Whatnot to request inclusion in these specific betas to further enhance your streams.

Let me know if you’d like help drafting a request to Whatnot to join any of these beta programs!

ok make the email and ask if the new obs integration will allow me to have chat in OBS or use retream for it so I can go to all my sources of live video. It would be easier so I can have all my chats in once place to respond to people and even pull customers to whatnot due to the ease of responding to all live sources.

[2024-10-01 08:15:07] ChatGPT:
Here’s a draft for your email to Whatnot Support regarding your interest in the beta programs and OBS integration:

**Subject: Request to Join Beta Programs and Inquiry on OBS Chat Integration**

Hello Whatnot Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up on our previous communications and formally express my interest in participating in any current or upcoming beta programs, particularly those related to streaming and inventory management. As a dedicated seller and content creator, I believe these features would help enhance my streams and allow me to contribute valuable feedback to improve Whatnot’s platform.

Specifically, I am interested in the following beta programs:
- **CSV Uploader**: As a high-volume seller, the ability to manage my inventory via CSV upload would greatly streamline my operations.
- **Rewards Club**: The customizable loyalty program sounds like an excellent way to engage my community and reward repeat buyers.
- **Auctions**: I’d love to explore the possibilities of 24/7 auctions, especially if they can be integrated into my live shows.
- **Breaks Feature**: Given my focus on collectibles, I believe the Breaks tool would help me automate and simplify the process of managing card breaks during my streams.

Additionally, I had a question regarding the **OBS integration**. As I am currently using the OBS WebSocket setup, I wanted to ask if the integration will eventually support chat within OBS. My goal is to manage chat from multiple platforms (such as YouTube, Whatnot, and others) through a single interface like **Restream**. This would allow me to respond to all my viewers more effectively and potentially bring more customers to Whatnot. Having all my chats in one place would be a tremendous help for engagement and cross-promotion.

Please let me know if there are any opportunities to join these beta programs, or if there are any upcoming features related to chat integration in OBS. I’m eager to continue helping Whatnot grow and promote its features to my audience.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,

If you have any other concerns that we can help you with, please let us know.
 
Best, 
 
Whatnot Support 


[2024-10-01 08:44:35] ChatGPT:
It seems you have a few follow-up questions based on the response from Whatnot Support. Here’s how to address each point:

1. **Finding the CSV Uploader**:
   The CSV Uploader is currently in beta, and it is available on **whatnot.com**. To access it, you’ll need to go through the web version of Whatnot. Here’s how to upload your inventory using a CSV:
   - Visit **whatnot.com** and log in.
   - Go to **"My Livestreams"** and select the stream where you want to upload the CSV.
   - Use the **"Upload CSV (Beta)"** option under the “Add” button to add listings for your show.
   If you're still unable to find this feature, it might be a good idea to reach out to Whatnot Support for more specific instructions or to check if your account has been fully enabled for this beta feature【92†source】.

2. **Checking the Status of Your Breaks and 24/7 Auction Applications**:
   For features like **Breaks** and **24/7 Auctions**, you may need to follow up directly with Whatnot to track the status of your application. Typically, once you apply, the activation is communicated either via email or directly within the Whatnot seller interface (under "My Livestreams" or account notifications). If you haven't received any confirmation or access to these tools, reaching out to Whatnot Support again would be the best option. Be sure to ask them specifically about the progress of your application.

3. **Scheduling Streams in Advance and Using OBS with Other Platforms**:
   Currently, Whatnot allows you to schedule your streams in advance using the **My Livestreams** feature. You can create future streams and set their start times. However, the feature you’re referring to—where OBS could connect to multiple platforms (such as YouTube and Whatnot simultaneously) to push scheduled streams—would require you to use **multistreaming tools** like **Restream**. While Whatnot doesn’t natively support this yet, you could use Restream to push your live video feed to both Whatnot and YouTube at the same time, allowing people to save your upcoming streams on multiple platforms.
   
   As for **OBS WebSocket and WHIP**, this allows real-time interaction between OBS and Whatnot, so you can manage your Whatnot streams more effectively using OBS for video control. While it doesn’t currently push your upcoming streams directly to platforms like YouTube or allow viewers to save upcoming streams within Whatnot, Restream would bridge this gap if you want multistreaming capabilities【93†source】【94†source】.

4. **Pushing Upcoming Lives to YouTube**:
   Unfortunately, Whatnot doesn’t yet natively support pushing scheduled live streams directly to YouTube for “saves” or reminders. However, you could manually schedule matching streams on YouTube and provide links or promotions in your Whatnot streams to direct viewers to YouTube. Alternatively, if using **Restream**, you can simultaneously schedule streams across multiple platforms, and each platform (YouTube, Twitch, etc.) would have its own way of notifying viewers and allowing them to save or mark streams to watch later.

### Next Steps:
- **CSV Upload**: Make sure you’re logged into Whatnot via the web and follow the instructions provided. If it still isn’t visible, contact support.
- **Breaks & 24/7 Auctions Status**: Reach out to Whatnot Support directly for an update on your applications.
- **OBS and Multistreaming**: Consider using **Restream** if you want to broadcast simultaneously to Whatnot and other platforms like YouTube, allowing for easier cross-promotion and scheduling.

Let me know if you need further assistance with these steps or drafting any follow-up emails!

**Subject: Follow-up on Beta Access Requests and Scheduling Streams to YouTube**

Hello Whatnot Support Team,

Thank you for the information and assistance! I was able to successfully find and use the CSV Uploader feature, and I appreciate your guidance.

I wanted to follow up on my application for access to the **24/7 Auctions** and **Breaks Feature**. Could you provide me with an update on the status of these access requests?

Additionally, I’m curious if there is any functionality planned or available that would allow me to push my scheduled Whatnot streams to YouTube or other platforms so viewers can save upcoming streams. This would help in cross-promoting my streams and gathering an audience across multiple platforms.

Thank you again for all your support, and I look forward to hearing from you!

Thank you for your response and for providing the waitlist link for the Breaks feature. I’ve signed up and look forward to hearing back as the program expands.

I wanted to express my strong interest in participating in future **closed betas or alphas** for any upcoming Whatnot features. As a dedicated seller with a large and growing audience across multiple platforms, I believe I could provide valuable promotion and feedback on new tools and integrations, helping to showcase Whatnot’s latest advancements to my community.

I’m consistently engaging viewers and bringing new users to Whatnot daily through my YouTube streams, and I’d love the opportunity to be one of the first to try out and demonstrate these new features, whether it's through live streams, auctions, or other innovative tools. Being part of the closed betas would allow me to continue promoting Whatnot as a cutting-edge platform and offer early insight to my audience about the cool new things coming.

Please let me know if there are any additional steps I can take to ensure I’m considered for early access to these closed betas and future feature releases. I’d love to continue helping Whatnot grow and thrive by showcasing its newest features as they become available.

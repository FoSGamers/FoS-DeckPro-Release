[00:13:52] there the break yes it's explained in
[00:13:55] the show notes and also in the break
[00:13:57] notes there oh oh sorry I should have
[00:14:00] pinned didn't pin all right there you go
[00:14:02] it takes up a lot of the screen but
[00:14:03] obviously you can minimize it so we open
[00:14:05] all these and we take all the rares and
[00:14:08] mythics and we put them in the sleeves
[00:14:10] then we take all the um Commons and
[00:14:12] uncommons that are $3 or more and we put
[00:14:14] those in the sleeves also uh and then we
[00:14:16] shuffle them up and we hand them out to
[00:14:17] those that are in the um break in the
[00:14:21] order that they purchased into the break
[00:14:23] and after that what we do is we look at
[00:14:26] all the cards for those ones out of the
[00:14:28] mythics rare and uncommons whoever was
[00:14:30] The Biggest Loser gets the commander
[00:14:33] deck here whoever is the second biggest
[00:14:35] loser gets the
[00:14:38] um gets
[00:14:40] the uh collector booster sample in there
[00:14:44] then today we're going to do this the
[00:14:46] third biggest loser is going to get one
[00:14:47] of our 12 bullet dice here our number 12
[00:14:51] bullet dice there there you go see that
[00:14:54] there number 12 one of you will get that
[00:14:58] for number three as your as a third base
[00:15:00] loser we'll throw that in
[00:15:02] there so that is our break and it's only
[00:15:06] uh $27 there I was going to be almost 20
[00:15:10] it was going to be almost 29 and I was
[00:15:11] like you know 27 let's do 27
[00:15:14] today we had a $30 one yesterday Let's
[00:15:17] help you guys with some shipping see if
[00:15:19] you want to participate and part have a
[00:15:22] hang out with it but that's really yeah
[00:15:23] that's what it is there pretty
[00:15:25] straightforward and simple
[00:15:29] oh thank you Cofe much appreciated
[00:15:33] that's bullet that's a
[00:15:36] dice you want to see the bull you didn't
[00:15:38] see the bullet dice no you should look
[00:15:40] at them they're pretty cool actually how
[00:15:43] use I don't I think they're more for
[00:15:44] show than anything
[00:15:46] but because I haven't figured out a way
[00:15:48] to use them effectively now if they can
[00:15:50] explain to me how to use them
[00:15:51] effectively that would be
[00:15:53] nice find a mermaid mat a mermaid mat
[00:15:56] there's a mermaid mat for you
[00:16:00] oh yeah we can definitely find one there
[00:16:01] next month yeah we're going to be at
[00:16:03] Vegas next month guys
[00:16:07] exhibitors yeah I know I wasn't one to
[00:16:09] do anything but that's okay you
[00:16:13] no so I said I forgot to do it I'm just
[00:16:16] gonna go and hang out see what happens
[00:16:18] I'm not a major person I'm not a major
[00:16:21] person I'm not a major
[00:16:23] person no it is not a uh it's a more of
[00:16:26] a chaos break so what we do is uh um we
[00:16:29] take all of the mythics and the rares
[00:16:33] and any uncommon or common that is over
[00:16:35] $3 and we put them into sleeves and I
[00:16:37] shuffle them up and I literally put them
[00:16:38] into order in the l i i hand them out in
[00:16:41] order of who purchase so like today
[00:16:43] there's going to be 10 spots so we're
[00:16:45] gonna need one two three we're gonna
[00:16:46] need a pack of cards here so our friend
[00:16:49] kid Kelly had given us some packs here
[00:16:52] I'm going to open up these ones I'm
[00:16:53] going to use a little bit of these ones
[00:16:55] cuz I like open up these These are old
[00:16:57] school brings me back in time to when I
[00:16:58] was a kid
[00:16:59] we're going to open up some of these
[00:17:00] ones and you know what and we're going
[00:17:02] to use this as our
[00:17:05] uh as our proxies and what I do is I
[00:17:08] write your name down on one of these in
[00:17:09] a sleeve and then um whoever and then I
[00:17:12] hand literally everything out in order
[00:17:13] it's pretty easy it's kind of more of a
[00:17:15] chaos break than anything but uh pretty
[00:17:17] straightforward and the reason why I do
[00:17:18] it the way I do it is that way it gives
[00:17:20] everybody even amount of cards you're
[00:17:21] not getting a digit break where you can
[00:17:23] run in you get nothing um you're also
[00:17:25] the nice thing is um if you happen to be
[00:17:27] the biggest loser you don't walk away
[00:17:29] with nothing either you can walk away
[00:17:30] with the death toll if no good cards
[00:17:32] come for you uh commander deck and if
[00:17:34] you Happ to be the second biggest one
[00:17:35] you're going to get the sample pack in
[00:17:36] there like yesterday we pulled out a a
[00:17:39] vwa terror nice borderless one and then
[00:17:41] if you're the third biggest loser well
[00:17:43] happens to be today you're gonna get one
[00:17:44] of those but right now we're going to
[00:17:47] figure out what our uh all right so

[00:26:35] to I can send it and put an next to
[00:26:37] dragon egg yeah I can do
[00:26:39] that I can do that if you send me
[00:26:52] something well I figured consider
[00:26:54] Halloween theme would be like you know
[00:26:56] uh like something that would be
[00:26:59] monstrous in some way um it could be you
[00:27:02] know dusk M some stuff that's why I
[00:27:04] figured Halloween give it a month um it
[00:27:06] could be like a Halloween dkor type
[00:27:08] thing themed it could be like M's wraith
[00:27:10] you know there somebody has vampire one
[00:27:12] blood suckers that was a pretty good one
[00:27:15] um that was the Dina that we had up that
[00:27:17] had about vampires and stuff um treasure
[00:27:19] and food oh maybe because that's like
[00:27:22] kind of
[00:27:23] trick-or-treating maybe I'm not
[00:27:25] sure I have to think about that one cuz
[00:27:28] I was thinking more like a Halloween
[00:27:29] costume that you would wear that you'd
[00:27:31] want to scare people cuz I was thinking
[00:27:33] more of a dusk more and scary Halloween
[00:27:35] but that could actually be the true
[00:27:36] there because I mean people dress up as
[00:27:38] like you know Indiana Jones and stuff
[00:27:40] like that for Halloween and other things
[00:27:42] so you know bats bats kind of would be a
[00:27:45] little bit like that yeah bats bats
[00:27:46] would be Halloween

[01:36:20] showing that way I can see what's going
[01:36:22] on here

[01:36:28] do that I pop out the chat it might
[01:36:30] work there we go that might
[01:36:34] work yes being a yeah doing that with
[01:36:37] this age Gap is definitely a skill like
[01:36:39] see what happened was
[01:36:43] um he uh he reminds me of how I was when
[01:36:46] I played so uh hockey when I was growing
[01:36:48] up just somehow it just you understand
[01:36:50] the game you could see it from from
[01:36:52] different like you can just see it from
[01:36:54] a different perspective in a way and um
[01:36:58] with that being said a lot of times I I
[01:37:01] was uh I was like very young and I was
[01:37:03] playing with like 13 year olds same age
[01:37:05] like 12 nine to 13 year olds as I I was
[01:37:08] nine and I was playing up to 13 year
[01:37:09] olds and you just learn how to play
[01:37:11] right and for him he figured that out
[01:37:14] pretty quickly and he should have been
[01:37:16] on the team last year but the person
[01:37:18] didn't want him on it because they
[01:37:19] thought he was too young though and that
[01:37:21] he's not even the director of this thing

[03:08:36] hanging out today with us
[03:08:39] o I think I'm keeping this one LifeLink
[03:08:41] whenever enters battle return one target
[03:08:43] creature from graveyard to the
[03:08:44] battlefield with LifeLink counter on it
[03:08:47] I'm I'm going to add this one to my uh
[03:08:48] add to my deck I can see your
[03:08:58] message you're talking to Bob I didn't
[03:09:00] think you were talking to me I think I'm
[03:09:01] gonna keep that for mine g hold on to
[03:09:04] that for my
[03:09:07] stuff and then I had where' our giveaway
[03:09:10] go
[03:09:15] to oh Bob the on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 I
[03:09:20] need a number from
[03:09:25] you one two three four five yeah
[03:09:29] um um Oblivion was asking a
[03:09:34] question about something you had uh
[03:09:36] commented on I think I think that's
[03:09:39] what's going on
[03:09:41] there all
[03:09:45] right mirror room see this this is the
[03:09:47] other one I was thinking when you unlock
[03:09:49] this door create a token that's a copy
[03:09:50] of Target creature you control except it
[03:09:52] has reflection in addition to its
[03:09:53] counter into its creature types if
[03:09:57] triggered ability of a permanent you
[03:09:59] control triggers that ability triggers
[03:10:01] an additional time so like that's why I
[03:10:03] was thinking of like do I put fractured
[03:10:04] real out because triggered
[03:10:06] ability initial time would be nice for
[03:10:09] um like the ring temps You is kind of
[03:10:12] what I was thinking and then if I need
[03:10:14] to I can always do the copy of a token
[03:10:19] oh your what not crashed see I don't
[03:10:23] know trying to

[04:34:00] horde oh that dropped a
[04:34:03] bunch that used to be like a $20
[04:34:06] card this is why you should sell things
[04:34:09] right away if you don't want them do not
[04:34:11] hold on to them
[04:34:13] it's a lesson in um magic
[04:34:18] economics magic
[04:34:26] Comics all
[04:34:28] right there we go throw that out
[04:34:35] there oh go he had
[04:34:38] gone bone horde

[04:35:20] they see the price of

[04:35:49] more than
[04:35:52] $18 that was like25 to

[05:04:04] my
[05:04:05] luck but we're going to keep looking
[05:04:07] here and double check just in sure
[05:04:10] I'm pretty sure I saw it today and it
[05:04:12] makes sense it would come out of what I
[05:04:13] pulled because I had so much stuff I
[05:04:15] opened
[05:04:16] today but I can't guarantee that
[05:04:30] obviously it's going to be the last one
[05:04:32] too if they have it at all the last pack
[05:04:43] yeah I know it's wicked cheap that's
[05:04:45] okay man but I feel like I had it it's
[05:04:48] one of those like I know I saw it
[05:04:51] today and I want to see it
[05:04:59] again let me see I feel like I got it
[05:05:01] though that's one of those scenarios I
[05:05:03] feel like I have
[05:05:07] that no I guess I didn't must have
[05:05:10] pulled it out for
[05:05:13] someone must have pulled it out for
[05:05:15] someone
[05:05:17] else well no one wanted the endurance
[05:05:22] there let me take a drink
[05:05:33] here that's going over there way away
[05:05:36] from me

[05:06:01] here I'm going put this to the shipping
[05:06:05] profile We'll add in
[05:06:08] that yeah sorry about that I thought I

[00:15:32] and then we are going to put them in
[00:15:34] boxes and packages and get them
[00:15:46] ready Dina Soul steeper uh I think I
[00:15:50] think it's potential
[00:15:52] potentially I think that would be
[00:15:55] potentially let me see I think it could
[00:15:57] be one
[00:16:01] let's see let's see here we got uh oh
[00:16:04] what this why do I have so many things
[00:16:08] here don't go
[00:16:15] away that's where I'm at what's this
[00:16:19] then what's
[00:16:21] this what's
[00:16:23] this oh that's what that
[00:16:26] is okay that's what I was doing
[00:16:29] okay so this is what I'm going to do
[00:16:30] here I well we'll check in one second
[00:16:33] here give me one second though I'm going
[00:16:35] to do my Chrome make it so that can be
[00:16:38] seen and it is that here there we go
[00:16:44] make a little bigger oh oh no no no no
[00:16:46] that's not what I wanted to
[00:16:48] do going to view
[00:16:50] it make it view no make it a little
[00:16:54] bigger there we go make it a little
[00:16:56] bigger
[00:16:59] so that
[00:17:00] is the
[00:17:02] uh little competition we got going
[00:17:08] on
[00:17:10] for you guys if you want to join let me
[00:17:13] check on that card let's see the other
[00:17:15] thing we can do here is this
[00:17:20] aha let's see do we think it is I think
[00:17:24] it might be I think it's a good
[00:17:25] possibility I think it's I think it's a
[00:17:27] good option
[00:17:30] H whenever you gain life each opponent
[00:17:32] loses life I'd have to say so that's
[00:17:34] pretty close to being a good Halloween
[00:17:36] one because I mean you're taking life
[00:17:37] from people that seems like a Halloween
[00:17:38] thing
[00:17:41] right I think we could do
[00:17:44] that well there you go Vamp paric LIF
[00:17:48] steal I think that could be a I think
[00:17:49] that's a I think that's a uh a Halloween
[00:17:52] theme deck I think we could have
[00:17:57] that so if you guys have one already I
[00:17:59] guess there you go maybe you can build
[00:18:01] you can upgrade it or uh make some
[00:18:03] adjustments if you want or leave it the
[00:18:04] same
[00:18:06] way here you go but here you go that's
[00:18:09] what I was showing there was that is our
[00:18:12] um our our hold on a second let me see
[00:18:15] if I can make this a little bit bigger
[00:18:17] here there we
[00:18:19] go little bit bigger there perfect
[00:18:23] exactly the same size as the screen
[00:18:25] that's what we got going on right
[00:18:27] now yeah I think it'll work I'm sitting
[00:18:30] there my a Vampire theme deck that seems
[00:18:32] like a Halloween thing vampires
[00:18:34] right well anyways that's what we got

[00:27:24] was literally just packing stuff up
[00:27:26] hanging out with you guys well I do so
[00:27:28] because my uh family was watching
[00:27:31] something I wasn't really entertained
[00:27:32] with if anything I was like like I can't
[00:27:35] watch this I gotta get out of here type
[00:27:38] situation so yeah that's why we are
[00:27:43] hanging out
[00:27:45] here and then as soon as I left and
[00:27:48] turned the computer on here to do this I
[00:27:50] feel like they heard me talking like all
[00:27:52] right it's time to go to bed now and I'm
[00:27:54] like this louder person so I'm try to be
[00:27:57] quiet
[00:27:58] I'm trying to be quiet here let me
[00:28:01] remove this here out of the way so you
[00:28:03] guys can see it now you guys saw that
[00:28:06] for a little bit now I'll take it off
[00:28:07] the screen so you guys know where to go
[00:28:09] to see all that info all
[00:28:12] right we'll be packing our stuff up now
[00:28:16] we're intro now the other thing that I'm
[00:28:17] going to introduce is tomorrow I thought
[00:28:20] this is going to be cool for you guys
[00:28:22] tomorrow what we're going to do is I now
[00:28:25] I'm going to in put in a
[00:28:28] you guys get to
[00:28:31] uh every $50
[00:28:34] spent I'm going to have a poll box a
[00:28:38] bonus poll box for you guys for
[00:28:40] everybody that spends $50 every time
[00:28:42] this $50 is spent you're going to get a
[00:28:43] poll from the
[00:28:44] box it's not so it's like a rewards like
[00:28:46] we do now but it's a daily reward
[00:28:48] instead of like a instead of the rewards
[00:28:50] that built up over time like the other
[00:28:52] ones this is the daily reward what do
[00:28:54] you guys think of that one oh I was
[00:28:56] tempted to change the commander
[00:29:00] Kil I don't know Kil would have worked
[00:29:03] well I don't know I mean it could have
[00:29:06] worked that's too much tape it could
[00:29:09] have worked but I don't know if it I
[00:29:11] don't know if it would have worked
[00:29:17] well I guess could have worked thinking
[00:29:20] about it loud and obnoxious
[00:29:30] ah yeah yeah I get what you're saying
[00:29:32] you know like if you had the commander
[00:29:34] out everybody's going to know exactly
[00:29:35] kind of what away what you're doing
[00:29:36] there so you not exactly but I have a
[00:29:39] good idea better idea versus if you have
[00:29:41] C Zill out which could work for what you
[00:29:43] got going on you're going to have it
[00:29:49] um like they it'll work it may not work
[00:29:52] great but it will be sneaky so like
[00:29:54] you'll be able to drop out a bunch of
[00:29:55] things all of a sudden and be like look
[00:29:56] I win thank thank you thank you come on
[00:30:00] I'm going to get yelled at that one just
[00:30:02] copying the TV show
[00:30:05] God I'm just going to get in trouble all
[00:30:07] day
[00:30:10] today let's go and who do we have next
[00:30:13] pack
[00:30:15] up a
[00:30:19] millionaire so yeah if people have some
[00:30:22] not gotten some things for me recently
[00:30:24] it may end up starting to go into my old
[00:30:27] post place
[00:30:28] that might be the reason why I'm trying
[00:30:30] to deal with the post office now on that
[00:30:31] one
[00:30:36] but hopefully that one gets straighten
[00:30:38] out soon
[00:30:43] M let me get
[00:30:45] you topload here like we normally
[00:30:48] do say thank you for hanging out with
[00:30:55] us and then we will uh
[00:30:59] get you shipped
[00:31:00] off all
[00:31:02] righty and where are all my oh there
[00:31:04] they are the
[00:31:16] envelopes oh interesting well if you
[00:31:19] don't need to cast the commander at
[00:31:20] times and I guess that would be
[00:31:21] beneficial then not even if it doesn't
[00:31:23] even matter like half the time if you're
[00:31:25] not casting Commander then yeah throw
[00:31:26] Cil out that' make more sense hell throw
[00:31:30] something out that everybody be like
[00:31:31] what the hell is that Commander if it
[00:31:33] doesn't even do anything other than just
[00:31:34] benefit you in a couple ways you know
[00:31:36] what I mean the look at it like that
[00:31:38] makes no sense and then you can just
[00:31:39] spank him with a couple of cards at the
[00:31:45] end hold on a second
[00:32:03] nothing the dog was barking and I was
[00:32:05] trying to figure out what's going on
[00:32:06] it's my sister's coming
[00:32:08] home oh
[00:32:12] shoot I'll figure that out
[00:32:15] later I'll I'll block that out
[00:32:19] later got sidetracked CU of dog
[00:32:26] barking Drax
[00:32:32] we
[00:32:38] go yeah no that'll be Kate taking care
[00:32:40] of yeah I I'm gonna go block that out
[00:32:44] later my uh I dropped it because I heard
[00:32:47] the dog
[00:32:49] barking and I was like trying to figure
[00:32:51] out what was going on making sure it
[00:32:52] wasn't an issue of some
[00:32:54] kind so I'm on to draxx
[00:32:59] yeah yeah I just want well I mean you
[00:33:01] know long story short I'm a little more
[00:33:05] um on edge here because there is a
[00:33:07] person that lives near here that was the
[00:33:09] that crazy person that uh chased my
[00:33:13] family down and that story I told you
[00:33:15] guys about a while
[00:33:16] back um like the road rage incident they
[00:33:19] live around the corner from here so
[00:33:21] whenever anything like that happens I
[00:33:23] jump and I run quick so I'm a little I'm
[00:33:25] a little a little more protective I
[00:33:27] guess than that yeah so uh long story
[00:33:29] short about two years
[00:33:31] ago um I was driving my
[00:33:34] um trailer with my boat back to put it
[00:33:37] in the storage my trailer from it
[00:33:39] because I had dropped my boat off and um
[00:33:42] on the way back some guy was parked in
[00:33:44] the median and in Florida in the median
[00:33:45] it's like just grass but he was like
[00:33:48] partially in the road and there's a card
[00:33:50] next to me and I got as far over as I
[00:33:52] could to be away from him but I mean it
[00:33:54] got close to him but he has because he
[00:33:56] was partially in the road
[00:33:58] I I couldn't do anything about it I
[00:33:59] didn't hit him nothing happened well I
[00:34:01] guess he didn't like how close I got to
[00:34:03] him so he decided to chase me
[00:34:06] down no yell at me to the point that I
[00:34:10] that I ended up I had my wife call the
[00:34:11] police the way he was chasing us down
[00:34:13] and I ended up saying to him like while
[00:34:15] he was there like we had the police on
[00:34:16] the phone and pretty much he yelled at
[00:34:19] us at one point and a couple things and
[00:34:21] like like run me off the like something
[00:34:23] like uh you almost hit me I'm fing I'm
[00:34:25] like I'm like I'm done luckily the
[00:34:28] police were happened to be right up the
[00:34:29] road dealing with a uh a car accident so
[00:34:33] like half a like half a mile off the
[00:34:35] road around a little bit of a Bend there
[00:34:37] was police and he peeled literally in
[00:34:39] front of me across the grass median and
[00:34:42] away my wife had it on a little bit of
[00:34:45] it on camera because she was using my
[00:34:47] phone to record it but yeah yeah that's
[00:34:50] Florida for you yeah exactly I was all
[00:34:53] right I wasn't too worried about it my
[00:34:55] problem was like I If my problem was
[00:34:56] though like if I was going to have to do
[00:34:57] something like I have a trailer on my
[00:34:59] boat I have no problem running some dude
[00:35:01] I mean on my truck I have no problem
[00:35:03] running some dude off the road into a
[00:35:04] tree and killing him if he's going to
[00:35:05] try and harm me and my family but I
[00:35:07] can't control the trailer after that's
[00:35:09] my concern which is why I was like call
[00:35:12] the police and I tried slowing down and
[00:35:14] getting away from him versus you like
[00:35:15] screw this pit maneuver that
[00:35:20] [Â __Â ] all right Drax here's your stuff
[00:35:23] getting ready
[00:35:37] but
[00:35:39] yeah that's what I had to deal with
[00:35:41] there
[00:35:59] what that's
[00:36:00] insane people are in
[00:36:04] Crazy how's it going 9V I
[00:36:07] know I'm at night I don't normally come
[00:36:09] on now I'm just really literally packing
[00:36:11] packing up the stuff from today and I
[00:36:13] figured if you guys wanted to somebody
[00:36:15] wanted to jump in and buy something
[00:36:17] while we're doing that we can but the
[00:36:19] reason was is uh initially the reason
[00:36:21] was my family and everybody were
[00:36:22] watching this television heart Heartland
[00:36:25] television show I am not a fan of it
[00:36:27] I'll say that just uh to me I don't know
[00:36:30] something about it annoys me I don't
[00:36:31] know what it is I just haven't figured
[00:36:33] it out yet I will eventually if when
[00:36:35] since I'm seeing it all the time now
[00:36:37] which just something about it annoyed me
[00:36:39] it's annoyed me since it started since
[00:36:41] they they've been watching I can't
[00:36:42] figure out what it is I don't know if
[00:36:44] it's the two perfectness of how the
[00:36:46] coincidences of everything occurs to
[00:36:47] make the drama or if it's the O over
[00:36:53] acting like I haven't figured it out yet
[00:37:03] all because I kept asking for us not to
[00:37:06] post politics told rides and he fous a
[00:37:10] few weeks later he his girlf tried to
[00:37:11] see
[00:37:15] if that's
[00:37:17] funny see the problem is people are
[00:37:23] ridiculous like
[00:37:25] see my problem is is like I had a person
[00:37:30] I they said don't do something and
[00:37:32] somebody else had another and posted
[00:37:33] something in one of their groups and I
[00:37:34] asked why like what did he say wrong
[00:37:37] because based on your show your your
[00:37:39] your um your group notes it doesn't say
[00:37:42] anything against that and the person
[00:37:44] banned me and I'm like what the [Â __Â ] so
[00:37:48] I ended up going sending them a message
[00:37:50] and be like are you [Â __Â ] me like
[00:37:51] what do you ban me like I literally have
[00:37:52] given away free beds to people here and
[00:37:55] I've given away clothing on a regular
[00:37:56] basis to people in our area and you're
[00:37:58] going to ban me from the group because I
[00:37:59] asked what rule was broken and the
[00:38:02] person blocked me like all right well I
[00:38:04] see that type of toer that person so I
[00:38:06] ended up creating our own barington
[00:38:07] group I ended up handing it over to
[00:38:09] somebody else because I didn't want
[00:38:11] it but I was just
[00:38:13] like the thing is though some people go
[00:38:17] completely ridiculous the other way too
[00:38:19] which is part of the problem and you
[00:38:20] know it's it's it's both both ways is
[00:38:22] the issue everyone is you know I've been
[00:38:26] there before where I've been like
[00:38:29] I've been I was even in the group mod
[00:38:31] before and I had like three four I think
[00:38:33] I at one point there was I think 5,000
[00:38:35] people we had in the group and that's
[00:38:37] when I like left it because I was like I
[00:38:38] don't want to deal with this anymore it
[00:38:39] became too much of a headache and I said
[00:38:40] somebody else take this over and um and
[00:38:44] I was like I had to ban people because
[00:38:45] they kept coming in and trying to do
[00:38:47] scam things all the time and other stuff
[00:38:48] like that and then they complained about
[00:38:50] whatever was this person was doing this
[00:38:51] with their dog like dude I don't give
[00:38:53] about what's going on with your dog and
[00:38:54] the politics with that leave that alone
[00:38:56] this is here to like see what's going on

[00:39:12] screen exactly there are there are three
[00:39:15] things that you do not talk about in
[00:39:17] certain
[00:39:20] situations
[00:39:21] politics religion and sex those are
[00:39:25] three certain things that you don't talk
[00:39:26] about that's
[00:39:28] work work
[00:39:33] Church there's two other places work
[00:39:39] Church oh those are like the three
[00:39:41] things you don't talk
[00:39:45] about yeah exactly I try not to pay well
[00:39:48] I literally got rid of a bunch of my
[00:39:49] stuff and I don't even use it anymore
[00:39:51] mainly it's just for tracking some of
[00:39:52] the like older friends and joining
[00:39:55] groups to follow stuff about technology
[00:39:56] or something like I I participate in to
[00:39:59] participate with it let me get my
[00:40:05] um box
[00:40:16] here oh
[00:40:26] wow by people stray dogs wandering
[00:40:28] around so you just was like all right
[00:40:30] created his Facebook group that way you
[00:40:31] don't have to deal with it anymore like
[00:40:32] all right you're dude your dog's loose
[00:40:36] again I understand that see I created
[00:40:39] one for like the my street only so I
[00:40:41] didn't want to deal with the whole town
[00:40:42] politics and by the time we like
[00:40:45] actually literally left our hometown
[00:40:47] like the town that we were in like for
[00:40:48] like 10 years or so not Hometown I'd say
[00:40:50] the 10 town we were in for like about 10
[00:40:52] years or so up in New Hampshire I was
[00:40:54] like oh my God this the you guys have
[00:40:57] ruined this group it was supposed to be
[00:40:58] like hey we're having a barbecue you
[00:41:00] want to come over or whatever this now
[00:41:02] all I ever see about is somebody's
[00:41:03] complaining about somebody's kid being
[00:41:05] out at nine o'clock at night playing
[00:41:07] basketball like are you [Â __Â ] me he's
[00:41:11] got a light on and they're in their
[00:41:12] driveway if you don't want to hear the
[00:41:14] bouncing noise put goddamn headphones in
[00:41:17] he's outside playing basketball rather
[00:41:19] than being on a screen I mean this is
[00:41:20] one of my neighbor kids but I was
[00:41:23] like this is the crap that I started to
[00:41:25] deal with up there and it got worse and
[00:41:28] that was part of the reason why we left
[00:41:29] I was like I don't want to deal with
[00:41:30] that crap I got two [Â __Â ] boys all I'm
[00:41:32] going to deal with is people bitching
[00:41:33] all the time and then eventually they
[00:41:34] going to call the police because they
[00:41:35] like oh this guy's got his kids driving
[00:41:37] around in his two plus acres on a dirt
[00:41:40] bike I'm like yeah I used to do it too
[00:41:41] and I had no problems with it and it's
[00:41:43] on our private property you get a
[00:41:44] problem with that
[00:41:49] off
[00:41:52] yeah yeah we used to be pretty good with
[00:41:55] stuff myself but yeah that's how that's
[00:41:57] how [Â __Â ] goes all the time
[00:41:59] too you try to start it with a good
[00:42:01] intention and people come in and ruin
[00:42:11] it you can try to be nice as much as you
[00:42:13] can you can only be nice so long
[00:42:31] yeah so there you go
[00:42:35] exactly so that's kind of what I'm kind
[00:42:37] of getting at
[00:42:39] there like you're like that's the whole
[00:42:41] point of what I'm getting at yeah like
[00:42:43] you rather have the kid go running
[00:42:44] around a neighborhood or do you want to
[00:42:45] have them
[00:42:47] like playing basketball
[00:42:50] outside like I don't know just weird
[00:42:53] some people are weird nowadays it's like
[00:42:56] they expect everybody just on a screen
[00:42:57] and do nothing you are gor I'm packing
[00:43:00] your stuff
[00:43:03] up get you in a top loader

[00:43:29] him out of the neighborhood are you
[00:43:30] kidding
[00:43:33] me that's
[00:43:35] crazy I I can kick him out of the

[00:43:51] this point in your
[00:43:53] life like there there's a there's a
[00:43:56] there's a certain amount of sense that I
[00:43:57] feel like you need to to make it this
[00:43:59] far in life and then every now and again
[00:44:01] you talk to a person you're like how
[00:44:03] have you made it this far like how what
[00:44:06] have you had for help because I want to

[01:10:42] tenacity but not in the um Japanese
[01:10:50] showcase that's what I'm thinking
[01:10:52] of all right
[01:10:55] now I finished eating my uh my tree my
[01:10:58] midnight
[01:10:59] snack my night time can't get
[01:11:03] fat I have to eat like ice cream at
[01:11:06] night it's going to be at some point in
[01:11:07] my life
[01:11:08] here I'm guessing it's going to happen I
[01:11:10] don't know when yet I'm trying to figure
[01:11:12] that one out that like my my metabolism
[01:11:15] is going to
[01:11:17] stop and I won't be able to eat ice
[01:11:19] cream in the middle of the night right
[01:11:21] now if I don't eat ice cream like kind
[01:11:22] of like or something like junk food like
[01:11:25] even after a meal and before I'm going
[01:11:27] to bed I wake up Wicked
[01:11:28] hungry and then on top of it being
[01:11:31] Wicked
[01:11:32] hungry I end up uh if I don't I still uh
[01:11:38] I like lose weight
[01:11:40] overnight you all the time wake up in
[01:11:43] the morning like way less than I did the
[01:11:44] night before the day before I'm like you
[01:11:46] [Â __Â ] me like I freaking run laps and
[01:11:50] while I'm freaking sleeping or
[01:11:53] something it's actually kind of frust
[01:11:55] frustrating because when I was younger I
[01:11:56] tried to put weight on how long it took
[01:11:58] me to put weight on I was 180 lbs at one
[01:12:00] point in my life it was mostly muscle CU
[01:12:02] I had the I was going to the gym all the
[01:12:04] time I got wicked sick a while back I
[01:12:07] actually that actually right around when
[01:12:09] I started doing this a little bit was
[01:12:11] when I was getting better and um like I
[01:12:15] literally almost died I went down to
[01:12:16] from 180 down to like 137 lbs I think it
[01:12:19] was the lowest I I was at there's a
[01:12:21] couple pictures of me I look like a
[01:12:22] walking
[01:12:23] skeleton well uh
[01:12:26] after that I haden't put my muscle mass
[01:12:28] back on I'm only at 165 now I used have
[01:12:31] to drink like milkshakes or like uh
[01:12:36] protein drinks all the time just to be
[01:12:37] able to stay on weight be able to keep
[01:12:39] my
[01:12:42] weight yeah that name got mixed
[01:12:46] up it
[01:12:49] happens I guess stuff mixed up all the
[01:12:52] time Elation my friend
[01:13:03] coming in with a collector
[01:13:05] pack from duskborn for our buddy
[01:13:12] Elian I zoom out
[01:13:15] [Music]
[01:13:22] here yeah see like I I had to drink like
[01:13:25] a protein drink so to be able to stay so
[01:13:29] that I was not going to like shrink down
[01:13:31] to nothing and every time I went and
[01:13:32] worked out if I had to if I was working
[01:13:33] out
[01:13:34] regularly I had to drink I drank a
[01:13:37] protein drink in the morning drank one
[01:13:40] at lunch after I worked out and I had a
[01:13:42] casan protein drink that I would drink
[01:13:44] at night
[01:13:46] um because if I didn't I end up losing
[01:13:49] weight and I looked like a I was back in
[01:13:52] high school trying to cut weight for the
[01:13:53] freaking no and I never tried to cut
[01:13:56] weight that's the thing trying to cut
[01:13:58] that's the spash I'm trying to get at to
[01:14:00] cut weight for the wrestling team and I
[01:14:01] never had to try to do that I just just
[01:14:03] every time I just worked out and I just
[01:14:04] couldn't [Â __Â ] put weight on if I ate
[01:14:06] healthy I end up getting to the point
[01:14:07] that I was like 119 pounds on the
[01:14:10] wrestling team and I think I was my
[01:14:11] senior year and I actually end up a
[01:14:12] couple times like I come into one of the
[01:14:14] resting meets and I'm like eating a
[01:14:16] eating a steak sub like James are you
[01:14:18] kidding me like I I was hungry and um
[01:14:21] I've been underweight by like two pounds
[01:14:22] for a week now so
[01:14:25] hey Squiggy how's it going my friend not
[01:14:28] much just uh packing up our stuff from
[01:14:30] today's
[01:14:32] break in today's show my family was
[01:14:36] watching a TV show I was not intrigued L
[01:14:38] by at all so I uh decided to come in
[01:14:43] here and hang out with you guys and then
[01:14:45] they all decided to go and take a shower
[01:14:48] go to
[01:14:52] bed which was fun how's it ago my friend
[01:14:55] squeegy
[01:14:58] though yeah well yeah chees is high high
[01:15:01] in um caseine protein was the big thing
[01:15:03] for me I found overnight drinking that
[01:15:05] helped me the biggest because it allowed
[01:15:06] me to keep my uh weight on all overnight
[01:15:09] I think the casine protein having
[01:15:10] breaking down slowly overnight was the
[01:15:12] biggest thing that it was about it
[01:15:14] because I know if I forgot to get
[01:15:15] somebody a sticker I'm
[01:15:20] sorry but yeah I think that's what the
[01:15:22] big thing when I started using caseine
[01:15:26] I think that's how you say it the egg
[01:15:28] based
[01:15:33] one because then it would be overnight
[01:15:35] it would break down slow and I wouldn't
[01:15:37] have like this I'd be able to like uh
[01:15:40] function you know I wouldn't be it
[01:15:43] wouldn't like I wouldn't have to pound
[01:15:45] like high fat
[01:15:48] foods oh nice how's that how was that
[01:15:51] Squiggy
[01:15:55] yeah
[01:15:56] did yeah
[01:15:59] did I'm like the I'm like sitting there
[01:16:01] and like the wrestling team like
[01:16:03] uh they're like dude seriously we're
[01:16:06] like running in a trash bag like well
[01:16:08] that's part of your problem you're not
[01:16:09] just being healthy man like you're
[01:16:11] you're trying around in a trash bag to
[01:16:12] lose water weight that's not how you're
[01:16:14] supposed to lose your weight dude you're
[01:16:15] jiggling in your [Â __Â ] stomach stop
[01:16:17] eating the goddamn thing they argue with
[01:16:19] me about like I'm eating a salad at
[01:16:22] lunch with a fraking piece of chicken
[01:16:24] that's why on weight I'm eating healthy
[01:16:26] food I'm not going getting some ringings
[01:16:29] and then trying to lose water weight
[01:16:36] later I don't think people had
[01:16:38] understood that oh
[01:16:43] Riverside nice I like that we saw a
[01:16:46] couple places when we were in um when we
[01:16:48] were in Colorado and I was like o if we

[01:24:13] even that bad because I can't even think
[01:24:14] of how bad they are like how good they
[01:24:17] what they were
[01:24:18] even so I can't remember what they were
[01:24:20] they couldn't have been that
[01:24:22] good all right

[01:26:23] there's a thing um can't remember where
[01:26:25] I was watching I think it was a tad talk
[01:26:27] actually and it was the guy the person
[01:26:29] was talking about people with certain
[01:26:30] things and when talked about something
[01:26:32] with uh no I maybe it wasn't a TED Talk
[01:26:34] was a motivational speaker of some kind
[01:26:37] they said about something a lot of the
[01:26:38] people that start entrepreneurs they are
[01:26:40] end up being they were people that had
[01:26:42] or
[01:26:43] have
[01:26:45] ADHD Reon I said had is because I was
[01:26:48] meaning like because they can't focus
[01:26:49] and they always think of the other areas
[01:26:51] that no one else does
[01:26:55] all right now what was I
[01:26:57] doing
[01:27:02] Mystic Mystic there you
[01:27:07] go all right Mystic and cool guy are
[01:27:10] having a little bit of a trade thing

[01:27:31] hate when I pack stuff up not in my
[01:27:33] normal location and stuff ah was weaker
[01:27:35] that's what it
[01:27:43] was okay
[01:27:47] Mystic wanted to give his buddy
[01:27:54] a
[01:27:55] card so we're going to let Mystic give
[01:27:58] his buddy a
[01:28:08] card CU mstic was the one that got lucky

[01:28:14] of the way
[01:28:16] some all
[01:28:18] right all right so Mystic and cool guy
[01:28:21] figure out what you got here
[01:28:25] Mystic wanted to give one of his see
[01:28:27] what the card
[01:28:37] was yeah laziness and that yeah 100% I
[01:28:40] figure out like how can I be lazier or
[01:28:43] how can I do less work well I always
[01:28:45] call it working smarter not harder so
[01:28:47] it's not really like being lazy it's
[01:28:48] more how to be more efficient head
[01:28:50] Shredder that's what it was head
[01:28:52] Shredder that's why call it efficiency
[01:28:55] I'd call it more than
[01:28:58] anything there you go head
[01:29:03] shredder look at that literally pulled
[01:29:05] one out right
[01:29:07] away
[01:29:08] perfect head Shredder going over to cool
[01:29:13] guy that worked

[01:29:58] done 100% I mean I will definitely say
[01:30:01] you know I am
[01:30:03] uh I don't want to do things so I figure
[01:30:06] out ways so I don't need to in the
[01:30:08] future or if I do something one way and
[01:30:11] I don't like how it was done I figure
[01:30:12] out how I don't need to in the future do

[01:30:39] DJ busy DJ's up Mystic was our big
[01:30:43] winner yet today with the
[01:30:46] uh with the
[01:30:49] um as I mean our Biggest Loser today
[01:30:52] mstic was
[01:30:57] yeah exactly so I worked in development
[01:31:00] for a while I'm gonna make a comment
[01:31:03] that someone's going to yell at me about
[01:31:05] or not I don't really care but I um I
[01:31:08] went and applied for a job and I
[01:31:10] happened to work for a company that was
[01:31:12] a um startup company it was happened to
[01:31:15] manage like trillions and trillions of
[01:31:18] dollars on a regular basis getting
[01:31:19] transferred between their stff like uh I
[01:31:22] don't know 25 30% the Asia Pacific Stock
[01:31:26] Exchange anything up to like somewhere
[01:31:28] around that amount to the US that was
[01:31:30] like three five years ago three to five
[01:31:32] years ago when I was there so not even
[01:31:33] not pretty while a while back and they
[01:31:35] were gaining more and think of like all
[01:31:37] those companies that you see in movies
[01:31:39] that's like what they have so like now
[01:31:42] those are all the ones that are on board
[01:31:44] well I had applied for a job there and
[01:31:45] it happened to be the one when I I
[01:31:48] happen to get hired when I got hired
[01:31:50] like one of the things like as that made
[01:31:51] a com like hey there was a lot of I saw
[01:31:53] a lot of intriguing people there like
[01:31:55] for getting interviews and there's a lot
[01:31:57] of different type of people here than
[01:31:59] me and um like and there's like the
[01:32:03] people there like went to MIT
[01:32:05] Harvard stuff like that and I asked them
[01:32:09] I'm like so why uh why do you hire me
[01:32:12] because I literally told you I didn't go
[01:32:14] to school for it I was I was a I I was a
[01:32:16] pre-med major and I told you I didn't
[01:32:19] even finish college just due to family
[01:32:22] stuff I left early to take care of you
[01:32:23] know my father passed away stuff
[01:32:26] happening and so I missed like and over
[01:32:30] them it doesn't make sense like well we
[01:32:32] asked this question that the owner
[01:32:35] developed qu the owner the owner made
[01:32:37] which was uh something had development
[01:32:40] type question and one of the things in
[01:32:41] it was pretty much it was like step a
[01:32:44] through b how to get something from one
[01:32:45] place to another it's like one of those
[01:32:47] like ones that like Google ask like
[01:32:49] those high level ones like if you get it
[01:32:50] right you get in type thing well I was
[01:32:52] like their question like that and I
[01:32:54] guess there is one part of it I'm like
[01:32:55] you don't need need that you throw that
[01:32:56] away you throw that away all right you
[01:32:58] do that that and that and you throw that
[01:32:59] away and you throw that away
[01:33:02] well no one else threw stuff
[01:33:05] away I guess people kept trying to fix
[01:33:08] those other stuff and do extra work for
[01:33:09] no reason because that's how they were
[01:33:10] taught to was to fix it all like that's
[01:33:12] unnecessary just get rid of that [Â __Â ]
[01:33:13] you don't even need to touch that like
[01:33:15] that's doesn't even matter in what we're
[01:33:17] doing right now so get rid of it and do
[01:33:19] the stuff we need to like that's
[01:33:22] efficient and that's pretty much what
[01:33:24] the guy works on is efficiency so in the
[01:33:26] fact I guess that was the reason why
[01:33:28] they hired me one of the main reasons
[01:33:29] was I was one of the few people that
[01:33:31] like saw I'm like throw that crap away
[01:33:34] that's not
[01:33:35] needed and it's it's just because it has
[01:33:39] nothing a lot of time has nothing to do
[01:33:41] with people think your school is GNA
[01:33:44] make you
[01:33:45] smart it
[01:33:47] can if you want it to but the problem is
[01:33:51] the school will make you book smart a
[01:33:52] lot of times you need to have more than
[01:33:54] books marks to live in live in the
[01:33:56] world if they'd be able to have
[01:33:58] something
[01:33:59] called not just common sense sometimes
[01:34:02] it's wisdom anointing like to be able to
[01:34:04] go like oh yeah that doesn't work that
[01:34:06] way
[01:34:07] and use your intelligence that you've
[01:34:10] gained over the years to figure out how
[01:34:12] to solve something that others
[01:34:18] can yeah
[01:34:20] exactly yeah and I think that's the ADHD
[01:34:23] stuff with me
[01:34:24] that helps out
[01:34:38] there there kid Kelly stuff here I think
[01:34:42] they're in the back maybe that's
[01:34:46] Frank
[01:34:50] that uh just good Kelly
[01:35:04] good goes
[01:35:07] there yeah just like they yeah exactly
[01:35:10] they get stuck in their head and they
[01:35:11] just can't figure it's the I um put this
[01:35:13] way I moved I medical issue that I had I
[01:35:17] I almost died mainly because of doctors
[01:35:20] being incompetent in New England um my
[01:35:23] saw about doctors in Boston I saw
[01:35:25] doctors in New Hampshire at darthmouth I
[01:35:28] saw them at briam whs I saw them at a
[01:35:31] couple other
[01:35:32] places and um what I learned from
[01:35:36] them
[01:35:38] was they are an extremely book smart
[01:35:41] person but they have something what I do
[01:35:44] not call is
[01:35:45] wisdom what I like to they have
[01:35:47] something they do not have something I
[01:35:48] like to call is wisdom let me rephrase
[01:35:51] it they um did very well diagnosing
[01:35:54] certain things but they couldn't figure
[01:35:55] out why it was occurring they could see
[01:35:57] a they could see like a symptom but they
[01:36:01] couldn't figure out why the symptom was
[01:36:02] occurring so they kind of just like oh
[01:36:03] let's fix the symptoms like that doesn't
[01:36:05] sound right
[01:36:07] like personally me as the patient that
[01:36:09] doesn't sound like you should fix a
[01:36:10] symptom you should probably fix the
[01:36:12] problem of the symptom so how about we
[01:36:14] figure out the [Â __Â ] problem is they just
[01:36:17] kept going about their business fixing
[01:36:18] the symptom no no yeah is nothing wrong
[01:36:21] nothing wrong with you nothing wrong
[01:36:22] with you well came down to Florida one
[01:36:26] of my symptoms was there still again
[01:36:27] went to see an pulmonologist because
[01:36:30] having breathing issues due to a one of
[01:36:31] the symptoms was breathing issues when I
[01:36:35] came down here he's like wait a minute
[01:36:36] all right go did do a regular blood test
[01:36:38] on you we'll do some just routine blood
[01:36:39] work hey your blood your blood uh level
[01:36:42] is hemoglobin level is at uh five you
[01:36:46] need to go hospital now go over to the
[01:36:48] hospital my H glob level was at 47 when
[01:36:51] I was up in New England when I
[01:36:54] like probably two weeks before I drove
[01:36:55] down there I saw the doctors and I was
[01:36:57] like hey guys I'm not feeling so great
[01:36:59] I've been a lot more tired than normal
[01:37:01] and I noticed the last time I had one of
[01:37:02] my tests here in the hemoglobin was like
[01:37:04] a little bit above
[01:37:05] eight like from my understanding like
[01:37:09] like I know I'm not a doctor and I was
[01:37:10] only a pre-med major when I was in
[01:37:11] college and I didn't go to med school
[01:37:13] but that that's pretty low for anyone so
[01:37:16] oh no it's okay it's not that bad like
[01:37:17] women get down to seven sometimes I'm
[01:37:19] like yeah but I'm a man from my
[01:37:20] understanding I shouldn't be below like
[01:37:22] 11 10 is even low
[01:37:25] sometimes and they're like oh no no
[01:37:26] you're fine you're fine so they just
[01:37:28] kept going about my thing well down here
[01:37:30] they finally got down to that low when I
[01:37:33] got to see a doctor and they got me in
[01:37:35] there hematologist sees
[01:37:37] me I had been having seizures
[01:37:42] for two
[01:37:44] decades all right diagnosed me with
[01:37:47] seizures a while back because epilepsy
[01:37:49] they said but they couldn't try they
[01:37:50] couldn't figure out so there was pseudo
[01:37:51] they couldn't figure out why I was
[01:37:52] having them they couldn't track them
[01:37:53] down specifically whatever that's fine
[01:37:56] you can't track it down I don't care
[01:37:57] about that but uh I'm not making any of
[01:38:00] this up well we can't tell so we we
[01:38:01] don't really know what they are so they
[01:38:02] think it's like being made up well when
[01:38:04] I talk to the doctors down here they
[01:38:07] ended up figuring out the hematologist
[01:38:08] goes uh no you were having seizures
[01:38:10] because your brain didn't have oxygen
[01:38:11] and it was shutting
[01:38:14] down I'm like
[01:38:16] oh
[01:38:18] okay so that's not good huh he's like no
[01:38:21] that wasn't good you're lucky you didn't
[01:38:22] die
[01:38:23] like oh so when my out my blood out my
[01:38:27] blood like was like at like eight or
[01:38:29] nine and I said I had had like a an
[01:38:31] issue of bleeding they fixed then and
[01:38:33] like that had happened before and then
[01:38:34] all of a I you know I had that the day
[01:38:36] before and I started feeling good I give
[01:38:38] them all the symptoms everything that's
[01:38:39] going on you didn't put all those
[01:38:41] together you just put the one thing
[01:38:42] together and said it's this I'm like
[01:38:43] that's why I tell you everything that's
[01:38:45] going on so you can do this thing like
[01:38:46] the house thing and you'll pull all
[01:38:48] those five things together and go you
[01:38:49] have this they can't not up there I saw
[01:38:55] about 15 different
[01:38:57] doctors
[01:39:01] and between the seizures and the other
[01:39:03] stuff that they said was not anemia that
[01:39:05] they need find out probably over 15 20
[01:39:13] years that's why I say I don't you know
[01:39:16] just because you can read a book doesn't
[01:39:17] mean you know what you're doing
[01:39:24] and that's the reason
[01:39:29] why it's the exact reason
[01:39:32] why I know like I almost died because
[01:39:36] somebody just flat out was people didn't
[01:39:38] want to think beyond
[01:39:40] their hand in front of their face it's
[01:39:43] like one of those scenarios like hey I
[01:39:45] can't see well move your freaking hand
[01:39:47] or turn the lights on
[01:40:08] but that's happened a long time ago
[01:40:10] that's long and over with not really
[01:40:12] because I'm still dealing with the after
[01:40:14] effects of the bad surgery that the Mayo
[01:40:16] Clinic did so I can't sit down
[01:40:21] now dude it's it's not it's it's not
[01:40:23] crazy cuz I've dealt with it a lot of it
[01:40:25] my throughout my life and I've heard
[01:40:26] different people with things and I
[01:40:27] didn't just argue with them so I know
[01:40:29] people make mistakes I just didn't think
[01:40:30] it was that much and my thing that floes
[01:40:34] me is how frequently it is it's not that
[01:40:36] it happens it's how frequently it is I
[01:40:39] think that's my biggest
[01:40:41] problem it's like seriously that
[01:40:44] frequently and then you look at it like
[01:40:46] oh well and my wife works in nursing
[01:40:49] things and I hear her talking about some
[01:40:51] of the stuff that she has to deal with
[01:40:52] regularly like no wonder why this [Â __Â ]
[01:40:54] happens regularly because you have
[01:40:55] [Â __Â ] retards working there sometimes
[01:40:58] sorry sorry for swearing sorry about
[01:41:01] that one that just kind of came
[01:41:09] out yeah that was a
[01:41:12] reflex oh when you hear some of the
[01:41:13] things they do you're just
[01:41:18] like
[01:41:21] what what
[01:41:31] I mean I get to use the word though
[01:41:32] because I'm technically [Â __Â ] with
[01:41:34] the seizures the way my brain works
[01:41:40] so and may between the ADHD and probably
[01:41:43] some other crap that goes on I probably
[01:41:44] got other crap that technically
[01:41:46] malfunctioning is that the definition of
[01:41:51] it I never sent you you yourself Express
[01:41:58] Yourself how's it been
[01:42:00] Mike I didn't see you PP in
[01:42:08] here just packing stuff up from today
[01:42:12] getting everything ready to ship out for
[01:42:14] tomorrow thank you thank you yeah not
[01:42:16] really doing anything major just uh I
[01:42:19] came on I was the choice was to listen
[01:42:21] to uh Heartland
[01:42:24] a while ago or comeing oh come in here
[01:42:27] it was the choice was to come in here
[01:42:29] instead because I didn't want to hear
[01:42:31] Heartland
[01:42:32] anymore it's been going on for like two
[01:42:35] days now I'm done with it it's like on

[01:45:26] oh yeah my well we did my kids did
[01:45:28] dishes we didn't have much yard work
[01:45:30] because we lived in a small area I did
[01:45:31] yard work earlier on I had my dad do a
[01:45:33] lot of stuff with boat things because he
[01:45:35] was uh being a fisherman he used to I
[01:45:38] used to have to like pick Nets and [Â __Â ]
[01:45:40] for
[01:45:42] him but I also got me money so I could
[01:45:44] buy like a video game or something which
[01:45:46] was also my reasoning for doing it when
[01:45:48] I was younger I like can I get a
[01:45:50] Nintendo 64 game no you
[01:45:56] cannot fine like if you want to do this
[01:45:59] like oh okay can I do some work to for
[01:46:17] onm oh yeah no we had the dishwasher
[01:46:20] luckily so if we didn't have a
[01:46:21] dishwasher they wouldn't be be doing it
[01:46:24] they were they pretty much they you
[01:46:25] clean them off you put them in the
[01:46:26] dishwasher oh
[01:46:30] crap clean them off you put them in the
[01:46:33] dishwasher and you
[01:46:36] uh leave
[01:46:39] them let them run it's easy enough for
[01:46:42] them that was an easy enough one for the
[01:46:43] kids to run you know might put one of
[01:46:48] those not like that's
[01:46:51] uh over the top off
[01:46:54] thing they broke a couple of them at
[01:46:56] some
[01:46:59] point but generally they figure out how
[01:47:01] to not to
[01:47:03] after I used to do other things
[01:47:06] though I used to have to go to the boat
[01:47:08] and run wires those are that was fun
[01:47:11] waking up early in the morning that was
[01:47:12] my fun
[01:47:15] things but you go and help your family
[01:47:17] when they need it that's what you're
[01:47:19] supposed to
[01:47:20] do Le that's what I always always
[01:47:22] thought supposed
[01:47:27] to someone's sprinklers are going
[01:47:30] off I bet my wife asleep on the couch
[01:47:34] instead of coming in here and saying
[01:47:35] something and I can finish
[01:47:38] up but that's her being stubborn I'm
[01:47:41] going to let her be stubborn
[01:47:53] ah yeah yeah my dad was well see my dad
[01:47:56] was
[01:47:57] older in my
[01:48:00] family oh crap I did it
[01:48:03] again I gotta St putting those up
[01:48:08] there the
[01:48:12] um yeah it was uh my dad was my dad was
[01:48:21] um I like 15 to 20 years older than all
[01:48:24] the adults that were older than that
[01:48:26] were in my uh that around my my age my
[01:48:29] friend's parents age if that makes any
[01:48:30] sense so I always had like the older
[01:48:35] parents my mom and dad met later in
[01:48:40] life and uh that's where my me and my
[01:48:44] younger sister came
[01:48:46] from sorry Jeff I'll put you in a
[01:48:49] sticker in here
[01:49:01] yeah yeah kind of raised by your
[01:49:02] grandparents yeah yeah so for instance
[01:49:04] like my my dad was
[01:49:06] uh
[01:49:11] 46 yeah 46 he was born in so he's an
[01:49:15] older man
[01:49:24] so and I was in
[01:49:26] 85 so you can do the math there
[01:49:36] 84 so but but the thing was that he
[01:49:38] being that he was always the older one
[01:49:40] and he wasn't around much because he was
[01:49:41] doing his own thing he had already dealt
[01:49:43] like he had been around he he had he
[01:49:44] created his life later on compared to
[01:49:47] other people it's like a lot of times F
[01:49:49] again A lot of times I would be um
[01:49:54] at uh like a baseball game and there
[01:49:55] would be no one there you want to hear a
[01:49:57] funny story actually I got a funny
[01:49:59] story I got a funny story about that so
[01:50:02] growing up I was I was about 12 I was 12
[01:50:05] maybe 13 years old I think so um I was
[01:50:09] like 12 or 13 I was at one of my
[01:50:12] baseball games my dad happened to be at
[01:50:14] one of them for the first time and who
[01:50:17] knows how long because during that time
[01:50:18] of year he fished he didn't he wasn't
[01:50:20] allowed he wasn't really able to be home
[01:50:21] being a fisherman that's the good time
[01:50:22] year to be
[01:50:23] fishing so he was there and why had this
[01:50:26] kid come up to me I was actually pretty
[01:50:28] good friends with and I had actually

[01:56:36] people like at some point in your life
[01:56:37] like yep y you we're just uh see the
[01:56:40] funny thing was
[01:56:43] like the FBI thing was intriguing to me
[01:56:49] because I had come home from school
[01:56:53] and they were sitting in the driveway
[01:56:55] I'm like what the hell's going on here
[01:56:57] and like they were looking for my dad
[01:56:58] and I'm trying to figure out why then we
[01:57:00] figured out later on like there was some
[01:57:01] dude that was a hitman for white bger
[01:57:03] that went and hung out with him or
[01:57:05] whatever and was on the boat for like
[01:57:07] nine months and then just pieced out and
[01:57:09] disappeared after he made a boatload of
[01:57:10] money and
[01:57:11] left um so they're trying to track the
[01:57:14] guy down my dad's like I don't know
[01:57:15] where the hell he went he just freaking
[01:57:16] left he slept on the boat and I gave him
[01:57:19] his paycheck he never did anything other
[01:57:20] than sleep on the boat and then he just
[01:57:21] left I don't know he checked in I he
[01:57:24] checked in with his parole officer like
[01:57:26] he was told and I don't
[01:57:28] know well there's some Mo spots on math
[01:57:32] I have that say here I want to go find
[01:57:34] what those spots are at some point in my
[01:57:36] life just going to say that I want to
[01:57:38] see what here
[01:57:45] is like I have a I'm going to be getting
[01:57:47] a sailboat I'm I'm learning a scho scuba
[01:57:49] dive in the summer I might be going here
[01:57:53] one of these
[01:58:04] years yeah well the see see it's one of
[01:58:07] two things that could be going on here
[01:58:08] my dad found a pilgrims Boot and a
[01:58:11] couple other pilgrims things and he
[01:58:13] could have marked down where he was
[01:58:14] running into those and if that's the
[01:58:16] case I'm going to [Â __Â ] find a pilgrim
[01:58:18] boat well there's like what there's
[01:58:20] three of them that sank
[01:58:28] like magic
[01:58:31] cards that's where you hit the
[01:58:34] stash yes like OG Pilgrim stuff like
[01:58:38] literal Pilgrims from coming over with
[01:58:41] the Mayflower and that type of thing yes
[01:58:44] we my mom has a a pilgrim boot literally
[01:58:46] has a pilgrim boot from him pulling it
[01:58:49] up
[01:58:52] we had she had to go and she had brought
[01:58:53] it somewhere to have them check it out
[01:58:54] and stuff and they like yeah that's a
[01:58:56] pilgrim
[01:58:57] boot what that's a pilgrim boot like
[01:59:00] yeah it's like I don't know what was
[01:59:02] like my like where' you get this they
[01:59:03] were trying to figure out like I don't
[01:59:04] know my husband brought it in from
[01:59:05] fishing one time he didn't really tell
[01:59:07] me where it was you just P it in and and
[01:59:09] that so I'm like there's a few things
[01:59:11] that's obvious it's what you said
[01:59:13] there um ill fade a kill it we're going
[01:59:16] to find where where some things are
[01:59:17] stash or we're going to find some um I'm
[01:59:19] hoping we're going to find a a a LW one
[01:59:22] of lost boats here and then all of a
[01:59:25] sudden I'm going to be a
[01:59:29] billionaire n g James packing your stuff
[01:59:33] up
[01:59:34] here let's get you a
[01:59:42] St nice yeah there's a couple yeah I
[01:59:44] remember being around there I used to go
[01:59:46] up there with the kids every year um I
[01:59:47] used to do um a summer camp and kid main
[01:59:51] where I was a camp Coler
[01:59:53] um so uh when I was up there I we used
[01:59:55] to go over to some of those places and
[01:59:57] do some of those things one of the one
[01:59:58] of my favorite ones was one of the
[01:59:59] places we used to go in Maine used to be
[02:00:01] able to get uh the arroe heads and stuff
[02:00:03] from the Indians uh that were up in that
[02:00:05] area and there was um and then also uh
[02:00:08] there was a um in Durham New Hampshire
[02:00:11] where I actually went to high College
[02:00:13] there was a dig site for
[02:00:16] pilgrims where they had uh they were
[02:00:19] pulling out stuff like that and like
[02:00:22] other Buffalo related bones and
[02:00:34] things
[02:00:40] yeah wow intriguing there's like 300
[02:00:44] yeah you know well that's probably it's
[02:00:45] going to be it's going to be like my Dad
[02:00:46] pulled up some like there's like random
[02:00:49] like these random gold items that we've
[02:00:50] like hey where Dad get this Jewel from I
[02:00:52] don't know where he got that from all
[02:00:54] right whatever we just go about our
[02:00:55] business well he got it from here where
[02:00:57] he kept fishing and trying to figure out
[02:00:58] what's down there and he's been trying
[02:01:00] to pull up gold for years and he died
[02:01:02] before he could tell us all that's not
[02:01:04] what it
[02:01:05] is that's not what it
[02:01:08] is but I'm guessing it had something to
[02:01:11] do with the um my guess is it had
[02:01:13] something to do with where fish were but
[02:01:14] every time there was fish he named what
[02:01:16] the fish were which is the thing that
[02:01:17] threw me off cuz all in all those things
[02:01:20] you can name it it says like PA says
[02:01:22] mackerel uh I'll say like different type
[02:01:25] of fish that he has around or say like
[02:01:27] dog fish and stuff like for places to go
[02:01:29] fishing but this place just says here
[02:01:32] that's why I'm so intrigued by it every
[02:01:34] other place has a definition written on
[02:01:36] it but one that says
[02:01:42] here really the bed oh Bedford one I
[02:01:45] know that bed are you talking about
[02:01:49] in in uh
[02:01:53] wait
[02:01:55] okay Virginia all right yeah that makes
[02:01:58] sense those are from uh that's from um
[02:02:01] that's left over from uh Civil War I
[02:02:03] believe right if I'm thinking about some
[02:02:06] of those
[02:02:07] [Music]

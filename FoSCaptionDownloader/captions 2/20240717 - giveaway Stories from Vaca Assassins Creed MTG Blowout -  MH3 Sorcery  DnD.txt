[00:41:13] the brothels are doing they get to go
[00:41:14] through an inspection process in this
[00:41:17] brothel Universe all right now in the
[00:41:20] process of
[00:41:21] this I'm leaving new Sam Beach it's a
[00:41:24] nice vibrant little town pretty town but
[00:41:27] has destroyed a little bit not too much
[00:41:28] there I have to get out of there I'm
[00:41:29] going over my friend's place in wakeo
[00:41:31] and meet them over there on the way
[00:41:33] there you run into some things what's
[00:41:35] going to
[00:41:36] happen I don't know but on the way we
[00:41:39] had some issue we did have an issue why
[00:41:41] did that
[00:41:44] stop why the hell did that
[00:41:49] stop I hate when it does
[00:41:51] that and way there we had an issue while
[00:41:55] driving our Gladiator down I by 10 in
[00:41:58] Louisiana Carr tried to run us off the
[00:42:02] road now the process of trying to run us
[00:42:04] off the
[00:42:05] road luckily in real life this actually
[00:42:08] did happen they tried to run us off the
[00:42:10] road uh my wife luckily had her camera
[00:42:12] out uh cuz she was just taking pictures
[00:42:13] of all the traffic because we were
[00:42:15] driving uh and she was in you know she
[00:42:17] was in there with me and this person
[00:42:19] decided they wanted to pull over in
[00:42:21] arlane after firing to pass 30 cars on
[00:42:23] the inside because the trailer truck was
[00:42:25] right in front of them and we were next
[00:42:26] to it well I'm I'm in Jeep Gladiator not
[00:42:29] not exactly built up that way but had a
[00:42:31] bit of an they didn't really have any
[00:42:32] space to pull in because they like a
[00:42:33] carlink while they decided to merge
[00:42:35] right next to me I actually ended up
[00:42:37] being in the breakdown Lane laying on my
[00:42:38] horn and it was either I was going off
[00:42:40] the road or she kept pulling in to the
[00:42:43] point that she actually hit the front
[00:42:44] end of my car my truck my truck doesn't
[00:42:47] have a lot of damage I'm going to need a
[00:42:48] new bumper that's about it but uh she
[00:42:51] ruined her quarter panel in the process
[00:42:54] of that she tried to tell the Poli that
[00:42:57] I turned into her Lane and hit
[00:43:00] her which quite frankly is impossible
[00:43:02] based on the physical evidence of the
[00:43:04] vehicles but I'm not going to argue with
[00:43:06] that you know the police office said she
[00:43:08] has a different story I told him the
[00:43:09] truth the actual story um which is not a
[00:43:13] story it's the truth so I told him the
[00:43:15] truth and what occurred and then he's
[00:43:17] like well that's different from what she
[00:43:18] said I'm like well you know what I she I
[00:43:20] don't know what she said but we do have
[00:43:22] evidence of some of it he goes well she
[00:43:24] said that you pulled into her Lane and
[00:43:25] hit her I'm like well that's completely
[00:43:26] impossible that because I have a picture
[00:43:28] of her car in front of
[00:43:29] me after she hit me because I hit my
[00:43:32] Brak so hard that I didn't go off the
[00:43:33] road and I didn't do a pit maneuver on
[00:43:35] her to push her into a tree and kill her
[00:43:36] and also the you know hundred other cars
[00:43:38] in line behind us so he's like oh really
[00:43:41] and I showed him the picture and he's
[00:43:42] like oh okay well um I'm going to go
[00:43:45] talk to her again and we'll see what
[00:43:46] happens thank you and he went over and
[00:43:48] talked to her she changed her story a
[00:43:50] little bit to the point that oh she did
[00:43:51] drive into me and then she said I had
[00:43:52] road rage trying to hit her first
[00:43:54] initially and then he's like you know
[00:43:56] what it doesn't matter in his Lane you
[00:43:58] can't run him off the road she's
[00:44:00] actually going to court for reckless
[00:44:01] driving and I am uh not at fault for
[00:44:05] someone trying to run me off the
[00:44:06] road yeah craziness here but assass here

[03:02:20] Frank Ray Ray hiding in the
[03:02:26] bathroom I I don't see why not I mean
[03:02:29] his specialty I guess I guess you can
[03:02:31] have that type of brothel just you can't
[03:02:34] have feral ones there you know it's not
[03:02:35] it's not a good
[03:02:37] thing let see why you can't have a feral
[03:02:40] I mean this feral there nonfer there
[03:02:42] these non feral ghouls that are going
[03:02:43] around they might like what they're
[03:02:45] looking at there I mean that non feral G
[03:02:47] SCH that was wondering you know you
[03:02:49] might find one that's going to be like
[03:02:50] oh oh that's one good-looking lady there
[03:02:52] hey Sandy how you doing you know you
[03:02:54] don't know what's going to go
[03:02:55] on yeah a little bit like the TV show
[03:02:58] zombie
[03:03:00] yeah yeah like a little TV show zombie
[03:03:07] there there's yeah exactly Tangerine
[03:03:09] there's always a weirdo into something
[03:03:11] exactly there's always a weirdo into
[03:03:14] something so it's up to you are we going
[03:03:16] to are we going to allow this
[03:03:18] or are we going to uh are we going to
[03:03:21] have to say something to I think I think
[03:03:23] it's acceptable I don't know the the
[03:03:25] inspector spectre's looking and goes you
[03:03:27] know I am inspector
[03:03:29] 69 I think I can tolerate
[03:03:32] that what do you I know but soon as you
[03:03:36] guys start getting feral you need to
[03:03:37] take them down you can't put them in a
[03:03:38] back room what do you
[03:03:42] think ah there we go I like it Oblivion
[03:03:46] it's exactly what I was thinking so you
[03:03:49] talk to the brothel owner there and you
[03:03:50] go hey buddy I have a problem with this
[03:03:53] establishment people have their Kinks
[03:03:54] all right it's all right whatever man
[03:03:56] but what I need you to do is you cannot
[03:03:57] have feral ghouls around it's not
[03:03:59] acceptable all right can we can we take
[03:04:01] care of them
[03:04:03] immediately looks at you he goes all
[03:04:05] right we'll take care of
[03:04:07] them let that go you're still getting a
[03:04:10] c rating though you tell them you look
[03:04:11] at you look at you thing you go down you
[03:04:13] I'm still giving you a c rating because
[03:04:15] you lied to me and you hit it feral once
[03:04:16] I'll be back next year to see what
[03:04:26] happens yes and if you don't take care
[03:04:29] of them I'll come back and take care of
[03:04:30] all of
[03:04:31] them everyone even the non feral ones
[03:04:34] you understand me look you all all right

[03:04:47] have to get room you can't have feral
[03:04:48] things around on this Wasteland all
[03:04:50] right all right that makes
[03:04:51] sense so guys get back in your vehicle
[03:04:56] you start to wander away drive
[03:05:00] off yeah I don't know maybe the ghoul
[03:05:04] yeah there might be a regular ghoul into
[03:05:05] the feral ones who
[03:05:09] knows but here in this establishment
[03:05:13] canot have Arrow ghouls that is one of
[03:05:15] the
[03:05:16] rules when it comes to brothel in the
[03:05:20] Wasteland so in the process of that the
[03:05:25] uh the Wasteland owner goes hey I I
[03:05:27] don't have much more for I don't have
[03:05:28] any more um cards to give you but you

[03:06:25] you now have 10 fogs these are worth 10
[03:06:29] then you have some of these that he gave
[03:06:31] you some way saying currency because he
[03:06:33] was scared of you all right look at
[03:06:40] that all right now what are you going to
[03:06:44] do here we
[03:06:46] currently in this
[03:06:49] Wasteland are we going to leave now and
[03:06:51] go on or on
[03:07:09] further what do we want to do oh is a GI
[03:07:12] you not
[03:07:14] running the GI you didn't run Dam dang
[03:07:18] it no I did not run it got to run
[03:07:29] that oh I understand that Oblivion I
[03:07:31] understand you want to make sure no more
[03:07:32] feral ghouls are around we're good with
[03:07:34] that I'm good with that so
[03:07:38] B Oblivion what are we going to
[03:07:42] do and go for a go for a ride away
[03:07:46] continue on
[03:08:02] all
[03:08:04] right you start wandering
[03:08:11] away I like it
[03:08:18] oh really
[03:08:20] wow that's
[03:08:22] insane I that stuff's crazy when that
[03:08:24] happens like people do things that are
[03:08:26] crazy and I don't understand
[03:08:32] it all right we ride
[03:08:35] away in our Jeep
[03:08:37] Gladiator as we ride away we're still
[03:08:40] finishing off getting to the end of our
[03:08:43] Tower Arch
[03:08:44] Trail finally made it to the end of it
[03:08:50] what what I mind uh give me a little
[03:08:52] explanation on what the problem
[03:08:56] was if you don't mind I don't want to
[03:08:58] hear like bad mouthing people
[03:09:16] but all right I want to know what goes
[03:09:17] on now I'm
[03:09:19] intrigued all right well you continue
[03:09:21] wandering and at some point you see oh
[03:09:24] my look at that on the ground there's a
[03:09:26] dead body you get out to inspect it and
[03:09:29] you find one from your left
[03:09:33] side all right you like
[03:09:37] it and right before you see that though
[03:09:40] as you get out of the truck because you
[03:09:42] happen to get to the top of a mountain
[03:09:44] you get out of your Gladiator and you go
[03:09:46] whoa what is that over there that I
[03:10:01] see what is that you see at the bottom
[03:10:03] of the
[03:10:04] mountain it's a little mining Village
[03:10:07] well they used to mine
[03:10:08] uranium here in
[03:10:11] Moab it's true by the way Moab was
[03:10:13] around because the guy found wanted to
[03:10:16] in uh they said in the US back in the
[03:10:18] you know 40s I think it was people that
[03:10:20] find uranium they were going to give him
[03:10:22] a boatload of money pretty much and he
[03:10:23] was a geologist and a scientist and a
[03:10:25] really smart person and he actually uh
[03:10:28] used some of his geological things
[03:10:30] understanding went around and found
[03:10:32] uranium in Moab which is what which
[03:10:35] actually uh which is why kind of Moab
[03:10:37] came
[03:10:42] around I can do that definitely
[03:10:55] oh okay that's intriguing that's
[03:11:00] intriguing huh
[03:11:02] interesting wonder what well I mean I
[03:11:04] guess if you're going to do a chunk of
[03:11:06] them at a dollar but not all of them
[03:11:08] like saying they're all worth a dollar
[03:11:10] that would be the that would be the only
[03:11:12] thing that I'd say would be a problem so
[03:11:13] he was saying every single card was
[03:11:15] worth a dollar even though they were
[03:11:16] like junk cards sign
[03:11:22] thing oh hey I don't medical bills I I
[03:11:25] have insurance that takes care of that

[04:51:51] those now the
[04:51:53] sword comes he opens the back door and
[04:51:56] you see the sword it's kind of just
[04:51:57] sticking in the ground in the back of
[04:51:59] the room it's kind of weird but that's
[04:52:02] all
[04:52:05] right that's all
[04:52:08] right because
[04:52:12] you like
[04:52:14] swords it's because of you I'm doing
[04:52:17] stuff
[04:52:20] buddy so you have a sword there what do
[04:52:23] you want to do you want the sword
[04:52:28] or you want the shotgun there is a
[04:52:31] shotgun laying on the ground too
[04:52:52] and uh the other one would
[04:52:54] be the uh
[04:52:59] shotgun sorry my images weren't
[04:53:02] loaded when I had this done this morning
[04:53:05] cuz I it's been such a long vacation
[04:53:07] that I didn't really actually have
[04:53:08] everything taken care of I was a little
[04:53:10] behind on stuff so I'm loading them all
[04:53:12] now in here for you you've got a shotgun
[04:53:15] there
[04:53:22] too hey thank you hey Bob um shotgun and
[04:53:26] shells you know you can ask him hey how
[04:53:29] much uh how much for those shotgun and
[04:53:30] the shells
[04:53:34] there can't see anything is it frozen
[04:53:39] should be frozen
[04:53:40] well yeah we can't see anything at the
[04:53:42] moment because I had the shotgun in the
[04:53:47] screen well he says you know what that
[04:53:49] shotgun I can give you that shotgun
[04:53:52] shotgun would be 10 pogs plus um it'll
[04:53:56] come with five
[04:53:59] shells what do you want to
[04:54:02] do think that a good deal 10 shot 10
[04:54:07] pogs for five shells in a shotgun
[04:54:20] hey Bob I lost you for a minute so we
[04:54:23] uh you want to make the choice Bob we
[04:54:26] went in the General Store and we checked
[04:54:28] the back room we had we had asked the
[04:54:29] back room to see what was going on we
[04:54:31] found they had a shotgun and a sword in
[04:54:35] the back room want to buy that all right
[04:54:37] F I think that's a good deal 10 pogs we
[04:54:40] do that
[04:54:41] deal you give them your your Slammer for
[04:54:44] your 10 pogs you know have a shotgun and

[05:28:57] of fun got a lot of cool videos my wife
[05:29:00] says we're going to start our YouTube
[05:29:01] channel I guess based on some of the
[05:29:03] videos we did there
[05:29:08] that hurt my arm a little bit I bumped
[05:29:09] it on the corner
[05:29:11] oh but hey you know what we'll do though

[05:29:16] time now what I need to get everybody to
[05:29:18] do here we'll get in that giveaway
[05:29:21] and so my wife seems to think what we'll
[05:29:23] do is um when we're doing our travels
[05:29:25] we'll do YouTube now um as like
[05:29:28] part-time stuff because I mean she seems
[05:29:30] to think I'm doing well with this that
[05:29:31] they might like people might like
[05:29:33] watching us and what we do on our little
[05:29:34] adventures as we travel around the
[05:29:36] Caribbean in our boat and eventually the
[05:29:38] world and stuff like that so I don't
[05:29:40] know maybe you guys will think that'll
[05:29:41] be fun maybe not if you do do make sure
[05:29:44] you do check us out once we get it up
[05:29:46] and running I'll make sure we share
[05:29:47] links to the videos and those type of
[05:29:49] things I don't know if that's stuff that
[05:29:50] you guys like are interested in or
[05:29:53] anything like that but I know for us we
[05:29:56] started our adventure on land because we
[05:29:59] our first Adventure started we were uh
[05:30:00] in the Bahamas last year no
[05:30:04] October um my wife I was like you know
[05:30:06] what I like this catam ran thing I think
[05:30:07] we can do it
[05:30:09] and then after that we um she realized I
[05:30:11] think she realized I can handle the boat
[05:30:13] very well because we were a 45 foot CER
[05:30:16] and uh for four or five of those days
[05:30:18] the captain pretty much was down in the
[05:30:19] galley hanging out the rest of everybody
[05:30:22] because I was uh good enough at what I
[05:30:24] was doing that they did not care he
[05:30:28] didn't care and he let me sail the boat
[05:30:29] pretty much by myself for like four days
[05:30:31] which is pretty

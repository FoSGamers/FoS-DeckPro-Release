[03:29:53] go oh hey you know what I had I had a to
[03:29:56] tooth pull recently so I understand the
[03:29:59] pain I understand that
[03:30:01] pain and like I said if if for whatever
[03:30:04] reason the weight starts getting over
[03:30:05] I'm just going to take a couple of those
[03:30:07] Vault packs out to get underweight but
[03:30:09] um I'll just send you as much pretty
[03:30:11] much as much as your weight limit holds
[03:30:13] on those
[03:30:15] ones
[03:30:20] I have a bunch of I used to work uh my
[03:30:22] favorite thing working was actually with
[03:30:24] the third graders I personally loved
[03:30:26] working with third graders that was my
[03:30:28] uh the favorite group that I worked with
[03:30:31] um they were very fun they were
[03:30:34] smart they were
[03:30:37] um they also wanted to learn and be
[03:30:41] there they weren't at the age where they
[03:30:42] didn't want to be there yet like fourth
[03:30:44] fifth grade some of them started not
[03:30:45] wanting to be there but they were at the
[03:30:47] age where they could actually learn some
[03:30:48] things you could actually teach them
[03:30:49] stuff I loved working with
[03:30:52] them and if if quite frankly if life
[03:30:55] didn't happen I probably would have been
[03:30:57] one of those an elementary school
[03:30:58] teacher because I like working
[03:31:00] Elementary versus high school I actually
[03:31:03] used to work a lot with the sped kids I
[03:31:05] liked working with them too but that's
[03:31:07] me I just that's the type of person I
[03:31:08] was I grew up my dead my mom was a uh a
[03:31:11] bus driver for the uh sped kids so I was
[03:31:13] on that bus every day for like six years
[03:31:16] so you kind of got used to hanging out
[03:31:17] with them and being nice and talking
[03:31:19] them so there you go treasure got you
[03:31:22] some things there we'll see if you're
[03:31:23] able to um if those will work if not
[03:31:25] we'll take care of it though either
[03:31:37] way oh look look see I used to work with
[03:31:40] um some of the special needs middle
[03:31:41] school and the special needs fifth
[03:31:43] graders when I was uh doing stuff long
[03:31:45] term

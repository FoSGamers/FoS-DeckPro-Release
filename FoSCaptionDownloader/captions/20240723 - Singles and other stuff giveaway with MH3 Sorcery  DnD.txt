[00:01:34] that
[00:01:36] there so what do you guys think about
[00:01:38] that how's it going let me see I think
[00:01:40] this box was the one with all of
[00:01:43] the
[00:01:45] cards have to check it was the one with
[00:01:48] the cards I'm out you're out all right
[00:01:53] bye all righty so as I said we had to
[00:01:58] pack up for a third time in um like two
[00:02:01] weeks so that I could move and have the
[00:02:03] people come and do their inspection on
[00:02:05] the house so I'm sorry behind again a
[00:02:08] little bit but um we have other reasons
[00:02:10] why I was behind though I don't know
[00:02:13] this morning I was behind a little a
[00:02:14] little more than
[00:02:21] normal anybody knows you know you know
[00:02:24] you
[00:02:25] know
[00:02:28] but let's see what we got going on right
[00:02:30] now we'll throw out some of the singles
[00:02:32] and see what we got today see if anybody
[00:02:34] wants
[00:02:36] anything for uh what we're going through
[00:02:39] we're literally going to just go through
[00:02:40] a bunch of them see if you like them
[00:02:42] tell me if you do um depending on what I
[00:02:45] get through we'll uh either put them off
[00:02:47] to the side for you or maybe we'll just
[00:02:49] um build a little little bundle of
[00:02:51] things for people but I figured I'll do
[00:02:53] that because it's that way it's a little
[00:02:55] bit better than uh buying being them all
[00:02:56] out right you know so what I'll do here
[00:03:00] is I'm going to kind of go through some
[00:03:01] of these and we're going to I'm
[00:03:03] literally going to start organizing some
[00:03:04] of my stuff so I can know I can get it
[00:03:05] off the side and set up for my um Coming
[00:03:09] shows here you know what I might
[00:03:11] actually do and if you guys like any of
[00:03:14] the singles you guys can say hey you
[00:03:15] guys get the preview of it because
[00:03:18] you're hanging out first is really what
[00:03:20] it's going to end up being you're gonna

[00:03:22] a there you
[00:03:25] go try to fix that you'll get a little
[00:03:28] preview all right right now I have all
[00:03:30] kinds of my stuff I'll start going
[00:03:32] through I got to organize them I'm going
[00:03:33] to organize by color I think is what I
[00:03:35] was going to end up
[00:03:36] doing so I can get
[00:03:38] through I don't know what's the best way
[00:03:40] to organize
[00:03:42] these anybody I think color is a good
[00:03:45] one should I go color or should I go by
[00:03:48] uh like color and probably color and H
[00:03:50] set so there we go we'll do that color
[00:03:52] and set so far let's do that we got some
[00:03:54] of these cryptic color this is
[00:03:57] RAV and this is uh
[00:04:01] mkm some Doctor
[00:04:04] Who I think what I'm G to end up needing
[00:04:06] to do though is I'm G to need some
[00:04:07] buckets need some places to put these
[00:04:10] now that I'm going to organize them like
[00:04:11] that I know what to
[00:04:13] do let's

[00:19:12] Assassin's Creed is going to go right
[00:19:13] here for the moment got
[00:19:17] a apple of
[00:19:19] Eden what must be done altar ilban lad
[00:19:25] hatham Kenway I of Alexandria
[00:19:31] desynchronize I do have a a forest there
[00:19:33] but I like keeping the lands if nobody
[00:19:35] wants those I definitely keep those
[00:19:38] Brotherhood
[00:19:44] headquarters
[00:19:46] rashan hook
[00:19:48] blade Leonardo da Vinci foil
[00:19:52] etched got a mountain throw that over
[00:19:55] there no don't always keep those Island
[00:19:59] Plains Roshan hidden
[00:20:04] Magister get some treasure tokens with
[00:20:07] an
[00:20:07] assassin
[00:20:09] Phobos with an assassin token we
[00:20:13] have Eevee fry I have
[00:20:21] Alexandria we have
[00:20:23] Socrates abstergo entertainment Black
[00:20:26] Market connections that's a good one for
[00:20:28] you for your assassins what must be done
[00:20:30] for lch that's a good one too there for
[00:20:32] you distract the guards Royal
[00:20:36] Inventor
[00:20:38] swamp Phobos towering Viewpoint all
[00:20:41] right little towering Viewpoint for
[00:20:44] us no this is not the first live Nathan
[00:20:47] I've actually been doing them uh do it
[00:20:50] by Rarity that's a good one Wasteland I
[00:20:52] might do that squid no this is not my
[00:20:54] first one I've been doing it for a while
[00:20:56] um but I generally don't do singles we
[00:20:57] normally do packs and I other things
[00:20:58] like that but I actually have to move
[00:21:01] long story short um and I'm not going to
[00:21:04] be around so in the process of that I
[00:21:06] figured I should go through some of my
[00:21:08] stuff and get rid of it that's literally
[00:21:09] what it is so I have to organize some of
[00:21:11] this what I have in my collection I mean
[00:21:13] I have a lot of stuff to get through in
[00:21:15] the next few days few weeks here and um
[00:21:18] I was going to go through it and if
[00:21:19] anybody needed anything you guys let me
[00:21:21] know and then also I was going to go you
[00:21:23] said Rarity I was going to go by uh
[00:21:25] color so color and Rarity specifically
[00:21:28] works out that's a good idea too see I
[00:21:30] was thinking H possibly color and set
[00:21:33] and alphabetical that way it doesn't
[00:21:35] Rarity doesn't matter because you say
[00:21:37] you need something it's
[00:21:39] there Capital Triad now remember anybody
[00:21:42] I'm looking I don't need any of these
[00:21:43] right now because I don't think going to
[00:21:44] use them this is a nice card
[00:21:47] nurturing
[00:21:49] animus now you ask for some of our
[00:21:51] assassins that's why I'm showing them
[00:21:53] off right now EO kadua rest in peace
[00:21:59] sh and Rebecca

[00:22:28] tokens and everything to the right
[00:22:30] places because I just realized I've been

[00:23:20] just kind of we're going through my
[00:23:22] collection now because I got to get
[00:23:23] through some of my stuff here I haven't
[00:23:24] been able to use it all I mean I'm not
[00:23:27] going to be able to bring it all on a

[00:23:30] stuff and keep some of them that I
[00:23:32] really really like and that type of
[00:23:34] thing but uh for the other stuff that
[00:23:36] I've been kind of just collecting over
[00:23:38] the last like year or so um the extra
[00:23:41] stuff I figured I'm not going to use it
[00:23:42] all might as well go through it and if
[00:23:43] any of you need them we'll do that but
[00:23:45] right now we had a request for some uh
[00:23:48] Assassin's Creed stuff so that's
[00:23:49] literally why I'm just going through my

[00:25:09] side whenever I see them I'll throw them
[00:25:11] off to the side here not throw them but
[00:25:13] I'll put them off the side here you know

[00:25:47] cover of Darkness Socrates the spear
[00:25:49] leonit and a black market connections
[00:25:51] there so those ones we have at the
[00:25:54] moment from there
[00:26:01] how many Eddie can do you have an EO I'm
[00:26:04] not sure I'll have to look through those
[00:26:05] quickly let me find them I have more
[00:26:08] assassin fatal push and I'll put them
[00:26:10] off to the side for all of them I
[00:26:12] have assassins go for the throat
[00:26:15] towering Viewpoint Coastal piracy hidden
[00:26:18] blade
[00:26:21] Forest smoke B Hemlock
[00:26:24] vial another assassin and another
[00:26:26] assassin a shay all right so let's find
[00:26:29] our
[00:26:31] EO oh how much is Eddie Ken oh hold on I
[00:26:34] can tell you in a second I have to we we
[00:26:36] can tell you one minute here there's
[00:26:37] another assassin we'll get rid of that
[00:26:39] one I know I'm still got your your land
[00:26:41] your uh Foods there you were looking for
[00:26:44] but I figure I'm going through a bunch
[00:26:45] of them you said you didn't matter which
[00:26:47] ones so if I come come across them
[00:26:56] here all right
[00:27:00] let me get to
[00:27:07] Eddie
[00:27:12] EO Ed right
[00:27:16] there let's see if I have another one of
[00:27:18] them by the
[00:27:21] way
[00:27:25] EO I don't if I have another one of them
[00:27:27] I think that was the only one that
[00:27:31] had I think that's the only ones that I
[00:27:33] had there give me one sec and I'll tell
[00:27:35] you prices of those ones because we can
[00:27:38] do this we can do add here price add out
[00:27:45] at
[00:27:48] ACR price slash price
[00:27:53] ACR 234 all right
[00:27:58] so there's your Eddie that it is $30 and
[00:28:01] I'll do that being $30 I generally do
[00:28:03] them cheaper for you guys so you can get
[00:28:04] them up here especially because how
[00:28:06] shipping is stuff so I'll throw it on
[00:28:08] for
[00:28:10] 20 27 that way you get a little bit of a
[00:28:13] discount there if you want and I can do
[00:28:16] that so we'll do on screen
[00:28:22] single now this does always go the
[00:28:24] shipping that's different that's why
[00:28:26] it's going that's why I give a little
[00:28:27] discount on it too because the shipping
[00:28:29] is the track shipping that's like the
[00:28:32] the $5 $4 three to5 shipping depending
[00:28:34] on where you live so that's why I like
[00:28:36] to give the discount a little bit to at
[00:28:38] least start out with a if you live
[00:28:39] nearby kind of get you a discount there
[00:28:41] so there there's your Eddie if you'd
[00:28:43] like it zoom zoom
[00:28:46] in Edward
[00:28:54] Kenway if you want it what I'm going to
[00:28:57] end up doing is I'm going to put that
[00:29:01] into top loader when I find where I did
[00:29:04] with them
[00:29:06] all there they are we'll use those ones
[00:29:09] for now they
[00:29:17] work if rash nois would
[00:29:20] pass for EO I will let you know about EO
[00:29:24] with Brash uh EO Brash noice let me
[00:29:26] check here
[00:29:30] put Eddie in
[00:29:32] this top loader set Eddie over here
[00:29:36] we'll see about EO Brash
[00:29:38] novice I don't think it's much I think
[00:29:41] it's a cheap one by the
[00:29:43] way oh yeah somebody said like 15 cents
[00:29:49] yeah there you go I don't know how many
[00:29:52] you need I got the two of those um if
[00:29:54] there's something else that you're
[00:29:55] looking for we can throw it in together
[00:29:57] with them um or I'll just run that for a
[00:29:59] dollar it's up to you because that's the
[00:30:00] low it will let me run things
[00:30:02] here so here's my uh my
[00:30:11] color all a shade Cormac too add that
[00:30:14] one
[00:30:17] there oh rashan hidden
[00:30:20] Magister to get that over
[00:30:24] there got to pass all right
[00:30:29] J ET is like 10 oh nice yeah no I don't
[00:30:32] have the etch version we have the um
[00:30:35] foil extended art version
[00:30:37] there so there we go we'll zoom out some
[00:30:41] more so you can see like kind of
[00:30:42] everything we got going on right now I
[00:30:44] think I'm going to readjust the way the
[00:30:46] camera is
[00:30:47] again because I think what I'm going to
[00:30:50] do here is think I need to put it up
[00:30:54] higher I need to do this
[00:31:05] no I don't think I can put it up higher
[00:31:08] uh oh I'm sorry I just messed everybody
[00:31:09] up give me a
[00:31:12] second I have to do higher this
[00:31:22] way do higher using the telescoping legs
[00:31:26] on my stand
[00:31:32] sorry for making you guys drop for a
[00:31:37] minute I don't normally do this this way
[00:31:39] and that's part of the
[00:31:41] problem these aren't my type of shows
[00:31:43] that I normally
[00:31:44] do but today I need to get rid of stuff
[00:31:48] so might as well do this a little
[00:31:50] bit there we go that might be a little
[00:31:52] better you get to see everything we got
[00:32:01] then I can zoom
[00:32:03] in for the
[00:32:07] cards as
[00:32:08] needed aha aha that'll work I think
[00:32:11] that'll work perfectly all right get to

[00:33:41] see I like they have names on them that
[00:33:42] I was using them in the games that's why
[00:33:44] I'm like I need to go through some of

[00:38:33] of the coolest things I've ever seen
[00:38:34] because I've actually been designing it
[00:38:35] in my head for years I've been telling
[00:38:37] my wife exactly what I wanted to be on a
[00:38:39] boat then we went to uh the Miami boow

[00:38:44] it I was like oh I love this this is
[00:38:46] literally what I've been designing
[00:38:47] telling you and she's like I know and

[00:39:54] cool nice print of it see I um I sailed
[00:39:57] on a catamaran when were in the Bahamas
[00:39:59] for a week but my family had been on
[00:40:01] boats our entire life like my family are
[00:40:04] fishermen so I've been out like in the
[00:40:05] ocean for a couple weeks at a time
[00:40:06] pulling NS on that type of thing so like
[00:40:08] Generations they've been fishermen um
[00:40:10] they were I was the first in my kind of
[00:40:12] like my father's part of the family to
[00:40:14] go like my father's like you're not
[00:40:16] going to be a fisherman you're going to
[00:40:17] college so that's why I went off to
[00:40:20] college and I got [ __ ] around a little
[00:40:23] bit there long story leave it alone he
[00:40:25] passed away and a teacher gave me a
[00:40:27] heart time um and pretty much after the
[00:40:30] third time of her asking how he was um
[00:40:32] in a week and a half of her or after two
[00:40:34] weeks and the third time in two weeks
[00:40:36] asking how she he was I'm like he's
[00:40:38] [ __ ] dead how [ __ ] are you and I
[00:40:40] kind of lost it on her um like I told
[00:40:43] you three goddamn times that's why I was
[00:40:44] gone for two weeks and um and she ended
[00:40:48] up failing me from the class I ended
[00:40:50] going to the dean showed all my grades
[00:40:51] and it didn't [ __ ] matter and pretty
[00:40:53] much I had to get a lawyer if I wanted
[00:40:54] to argue I was a kid I went home and
[00:40:56] took care of my mom instead I was like
[00:40:58] screw this I'll take care of my mom
[00:41:00] instead and either way I still went into
[00:41:02] it stuff and did it very well for
[00:41:12] myself oh I will thank you I can try
[00:41:18] that oh sweet power catam I like that
[00:41:22] yeah know I'd be I personally do sale I
[00:41:24] if I would like to go and do that that
[00:41:25] would be kind of cool to do is transfer
[00:41:27] supporting him my family like my dad was
[00:41:29] going to be actually well he was going
[00:41:30] to be uh tugbo captain on his way to do
[00:41:33] that and then he had a brain andman died
[00:41:36] literally the day he was supposed to be
[00:41:38] take over C
[00:41:40] hope well you know this is 20 plus 20
[00:41:43] years ago now so like but yeah that's
[00:41:45] what we're doing we're getting rid of
[00:41:46] all of our stuff now we're gonna have
[00:41:47] zero debt then we're gonna have a bunch
[00:41:50] of stuff for on uh and we'll have our
[00:41:52] boat that we can travel around with
[00:41:54] which will be fully functional so
[00:41:55] that'll be other thing too
[00:42:00] yeah an intriguing intriguing setup
[00:42:02] concept but hey what we'll do we'll
[00:42:03] still be doing this from the boat and
[00:42:05] stuff we're just kind of going through
[00:42:06] our stuff like I said I have these I
[00:42:09] built into a game before and as you can
[00:42:12] see there's names and stuff written on
[00:42:13] them I just need to uh get everything
[00:42:14] organized by their sets
[00:42:18] now if there's anything someone wants
[00:42:20] let me
[00:42:23] know oh no I have a lot of different
[00:42:25] sets right here

[01:19:38] blood Letter of
[01:19:40] vot let me throw that out
[01:19:42] there now uh like I had said before the
[01:19:46] way that I had ran it because it was um
[01:19:50] is $19 it will go in a plain white
[01:19:53] envelope it literally goes in something
[01:19:55] like this and it shipped to you that's
[01:19:57] why it's cheap shipping the way it is
[01:20:01] so I'm going to run it that way that way
[01:20:03] you are completely aware has like no
[01:20:05] tracking it just goes out like an
[01:20:07] envelope there you go if you want it now
[01:20:10] if you want it to be with the tracking I
[01:20:11] can definitely do that too I can
[01:20:14] definitely do that
[01:20:16] too but there's your blood Letter right
[01:20:20] there now uh unin that one there water

[01:20:31] another blood Letter might not be a foil
[01:20:34] version of it now I can run it um as a
[01:20:38] as the other way too if you'd
[01:20:40] like March the machine I think that's a
[01:20:43] Randomness ones I'm not going to have

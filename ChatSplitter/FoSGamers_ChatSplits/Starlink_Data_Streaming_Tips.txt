If there is an overridge on the Starlink-4, it's a priority access data. When you go down lower, in regards to the access data, what happens to your speed? I need to use what they tell us will happen, and then I also need you to figure out what people have been finding is going on in real life. Because I need to be able to stream at least 1080p to two different locations when I do my streaming. This one goes a lot faster than the other one, which goes out to all the different channels that I have.

All right, take it as for an entire month for me, I would be doing a stream every morning, which streamed 1080p to two locations, one to Whatnot and one to the Restream location, Restream.io, which sends it out to all my other streaming places, so I don't need to send a bunch of them out. Now, that being said, can you please tell me how much data I would be using on a regular basis on an average? Actually, let's just do a little bit above average, in this case, we're doing a little extra, something like this, because we're doing every morning, and we'll say three nights a week, so every morning and then three nights a week we do something. Let's do it like that and see how that goes there for data consumption, and the morning ones are as long as normal, and the afternoon, the nighttime ones will be one to three hours, depending on what goes on. So let me know what you would do for regular data consumption, for streaming like that to those locations, and then compare that to the data plans that I would use for Starlink and also how it would work if I just went with the basic plan where the 50 gigabytes cap and then how it would be for me going over the limit when I'm at, in what I would be streaming like if we're doing it only in the morning, say once I hit my cap, I only do the mornings or something like that.

[2024-12-03 13:54:52] ChatGPT:
Based on your described streaming schedule:

- **Morning Streams (Daily, 3.5 hours each):**

Now I need to go to something completely different. I'm not having to do anything like we just talked about, something new. What I need you to help me with is to figure out if I can use OBS to stream two different views. Like one view will go to Whatnot, where it is in the phone up and down vertical view for them. Or a 9x16 view or whatever you want to say. And then the other one will go to YouTube and Twitch and Facebook or anything else. And you'll have to hold it in the long view, like a really size movie kind of view. Or 9x16, 16x9, whatever the opposite is. You know, vertical versus horizontal. So vertical would be going to Whatnot and horizontal would be going to Restream, which would go over to all my other channels that I have it on. Is that possible to do from OBS?

[2024-12-04 10:25:46] ChatGPT:
Yes, it is possible to stream two different views (one vertical for Whatnot and one horizontal for platforms like YouTube, Twitch, and Facebook) using OBS Studio. Here’s how you can set it up:

---

### **Step 1: Set Up Two Instances of OBS**
OBS Studio supports running multiple instances simultaneously. You can configure one for vertical streaming and another for horizontal streaming.

1. **Enable Multi-Instance Mode:**
   - Open OBS Studio.
   - Go to **Settings** > **Advanced**.
   - Check **Enable Multi-Instance Mode** (if available).

2. **Launch Two Instances:**
   - Open OBS twice. Each instance will act as a separate workspace for vertical and horizontal streaming.

---

### **Step 2: Configure Vertical Streaming for Whatnot**
1. **Canvas Settings:**
   - Go to **Settings** > **Video**.
   - Set **Base (Canvas) Resolution** and **Output Resolution** to **1080x1920** (vertical resolution).

2. **Add Sources:**
   - Add your video source (camera, capture card, etc.).
   - Adjust the layout to fit the vertical orientation.

3. **Stream Settings:**
   - Go to **Settings** > **Stream**.
   - Input the RTMP URL and Stream Key provided by Whatnot.

---

### **Step 3: Configure Horizontal Streaming for Restream**
1. **Canvas Settings:**
   - In the second OBS instance, go to **Settings** > **Video**.
   - Set **Base (Canvas) Resolution** and **Output Resolution** to **1920x1080** (horizontal resolution).

2. **Add Sources:**
   - Add your video source. You can use the same camera but crop or adjust the layout to fit the horizontal orientation.

3. **Stream Settings:**
   - Go to **Settings** > **Stream**.
   - Use the RTMP URL and Stream Key provided by Restream.

---

### **Step 4: Manage Camera Input**
- If you are using a single camera, consider using a virtual camera or a capture card that supports multiple outputs to send the video feed to both OBS instances.
- Tools like **NDI Plugin** or **Virtual Camera** in OBS can duplicate the camera feed.

---

### **Step 5: Audio Management**
- Ensure both OBS instances are using the same audio input (e.g., microphone or sound mixer).
- Test audio synchronization to avoid issues across platforms.

---

### **Step 6: Performance Optimization**
- Streaming two views simultaneously can be resource-intensive. To optimize:
  - Lower the bitrate for each stream based on platform requirements.
  - Ensure your computer has a powerful CPU/GPU (e.g., i7/i9, AMD Ryzen, or equivalent).
  - Test the setup with your internet bandwidth. Upload speeds of **10 Mbps or higher per stream** are recommended.

---

### **Alternative Option: OBS Plugin for Dual Streams**
- Use plugins like **StreamFX** or tools like **vMix** to create multiple outputs within one OBS instance. This can simplify managing two views and reduce resource usage.

---

### **Testing and Fine-Tuning**
1. Run test streams on both setups to ensure smooth performance and correct aspect ratios.
2. Monitor resource usage to ensure your system can handle dual streaming without dropping frames or causing lag.

- **Set Base Canvas Resolution:**
  - Open OBS Studio and navigate to **Settings** > **Video**.
  - Set the **Base (Canvas) Resolution** to a size that accommodates both aspect ratios. For example, a resolution of **1920x1920** can serve as a square canvas, allowing you to position both vertical and horizontal scenes appropriately.

- **Create Separate Scenes:**
  - Create a scene for your horizontal stream (16:9) and position it within the canvas to occupy the desired area.
  - Create another scene for your vertical stream (9:16) and position it accordingly.

- **Adjust Sources:**
  - Add your video sources (e.g., camera, screen capture) to each scene.
  - Resize and crop the sources to fit the respective aspect ratios without distortion.

**3. Configure Multiple RTMP Outputs:**

- **Primary Stream Setup:**
  - In **Settings** > **Stream**, configure the primary stream to your main platform (e.g., Restream) with the appropriate stream key.

- **Secondary Stream Setup:**
  - Access the Multiple RTMP plugin interface (usually found under **Tools** > **Multiple RTMP**).
  - Add a new target and input the RTMP URL and stream key for Whatnot.
  - Ensure that each stream is set to capture the appropriate scene corresponding to its aspect ratio.

**4. Monitor and Optimize Performance:**

- **Resource Management:**
  - Streaming multiple outputs can be resource-intensive. Monitor your system's CPU and GPU usage to ensure stable performance.
  - Adjust bitrate settings for each stream based on your internet upload speed and the requirements of each platform.

- **Testing:**
  - Conduct test streams to verify that both outputs are functioning correctly and that the aspect ratios are displayed as intended on each platform.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Audio Management:**
  - Ensure that audio sources are correctly routed to both streams. OBS allows you to manage audio sources per scene, so configure them to match your streaming setup.

- **Scene Switching:**
  - Be cautious when switching scenes during a live stream, as changes will affect both outputs. Plan your scenes to accommodate both aspect ratios simultaneously.

By utilizing the Multiple RTMP plugin and configuring your scenes and canvas appropriately, you can effectively stream to Whatnot in a vertical format and to other platforms in a horizontal format simultaneously using a single instance of OBS Studio.

If I have the plugin that uses Eleganto Stream Deck, which is the virtual one that I have on my iPad, it will allow me to, when I press one of the buttons there, to go on to both of the scenes. That way I'm actually being able to stream, but it'll pop up exactly the same, because I want everything to show up the same on all of them, just the views to be different. Literally coming from the same camera. What I planned on, I was going to do, was I was going to take the, and do it in horizontal, and then crop to the size of the middle of the view of the camera, so I can have it in for whatnot, to be able to see everything. And if people want to see anything else, they can always go on the other channel and see it. And what I'll do too, is I can, like on what, YouTube or anything else, that we can see the whole thing, if they always want to see the whole screen of what I'm doing. That way it'll give it a little bit more, maybe a little more reason to check out all the channels, not just one. And I'm going to try that a couple times, and see how that goes for streaming, whether it'll work that way or not. I need you to tell me if it's better to be streaming vertical to YouTube or horizontal and then if it is a difference is there a way for me using restream to make it for the vertical V going to YouTube and the horizontal one going to everything else.

[2024-12-04 10:33:09] ChatGPT:
Your streaming approach of using one camera to simultaneously output different views (vertical for Whatnot and horizontal for YouTube/Twitch/Facebook) is a great idea, especially for targeting diverse audiences. Here's a breakdown of your questions and options:

---

### **1. Should You Stream Vertical or Horizontal to YouTube?**
- **Horizontal (16:9):** This is the standard format for YouTube. It's optimized for desktop, mobile, and TV viewing. Most viewers expect horizontal videos on this platform.
  - **Pros:** Matches traditional video expectations, full screen on most devices.
  - **Cons:** May appear smaller on mobile when viewed vertically.

- **Vertical (9:16):** YouTube now supports vertical videos for Shorts and mobile viewing.
  - **Pros:** Takes full advantage of mobile screens.
  - **Cons:** Limits viewing experience on desktop and TV (black bars on the sides).

**Recommendation:** Use horizontal (16:9) for YouTube as it provides the best viewing experience across devices. However, if you're targeting mobile users heavily, consider vertical for specific mobile-centric content (like Shorts).

---

### **2. Using Restream for Dual Aspect Ratios**
Restream allows you to simultaneously stream to multiple platforms. However, it doesn't natively support sending different aspect ratios (e.g., vertical to YouTube and horizontal to Twitch) from the same source. To achieve this, you need to customize OBS outputs.

- **Approach:**
  1. **OBS Setup:**
     - Use OBS with the **Multiple RTMP Plugin**.
     - Configure one output as vertical (9:16) for Whatnot.
     - Configure the second output as horizontal (16:9) for Restream (YouTube, Twitch, etc.).
  2. **Restream Settings:**
     - Set Restream to distribute your horizontal output to all its connected channels.

---

### **3. Using Elgato Stream Deck for Scene Switching**
You can use your Elgato Stream Deck (virtual app) to switch between scenes or toggle specific sources in OBS. Here's how to implement your idea:

- **Stream Deck Plugin Setup:**
  - Install the OBS plugin for Elgato Stream Deck.
  - Configure buttons for each action:
    - One button for starting/stopping streams.
    - Scene selection buttons to switch between vertical and horizontal views.

- **Cropped Camera for Whatnot:**
  - Set up a horizontal (16:9) scene in OBS and crop a portion of the view for Whatnot’s vertical (9:16) scene.
  - Example: Add your camera source twice—once for horizontal and once cropped for vertical.
  - Ensure the cropped vertical scene shows the most relevant content for Whatnot viewers.

---

### **4. How to Promote Multi-Channel Viewing**
Your plan to entice Whatnot viewers to check out YouTube for a full-screen experience is excellent. To make it effective:
- **Overlay Text:** Include an on-screen prompt like "See the full view on YouTube at [Your Channel]."
- **Description Links:** Add links to other platforms in the description of your Whatnot streams.
- **Call-to-Action:** Mention during your stream why viewers might want to switch platforms (e.g., for exclusive angles or content).

---

### **5. Technical Challenges and Optimization**
- **Resource Usage:** Streaming in two resolutions/aspect ratios from OBS is resource-intensive. Ensure your system meets high-performance requirements (e.g., i7/i9 CPU, RTX GPU, 16GB+ RAM).
- **Internet Speed:** Streaming two outputs simultaneously may require at least **15-20 Mbps upload speed**. Test your bandwidth to ensure smooth streaming.

---

### **Summary Workflow**
1. **OBS Setup:**
   - Create two scenes: one horizontal, one cropped vertical.
   - Use the Multiple RTMP Plugin to stream to both Whatnot and Restream simultaneously.
2. **Elgato Stream Deck:**
   - Use it to manage streams and toggle scenes easily.
3. **Content Strategy:**
   - Promote YouTube as the “full view” platform while keeping Whatnot focused and cropped.
4. **Test:** Run test streams to refine your setup and monitor performance.

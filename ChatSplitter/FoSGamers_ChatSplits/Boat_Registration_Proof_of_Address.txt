```

#### **Basic Script Example:**

```python
from pdfrw import PdfReader, PdfWriter, PageMerge
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import letter
import io

# Define the path to the input and output PDFs
input_pdf = 'input.pdf'
output_pdf = 'fillable_output.pdf'

# Create a new PDF with form fields using reportlab
packet = io.BytesIO()
can = canvas.Canvas(packet, pagesize=letter)

# Example: Add a text field at specific coordinates
can.acroForm.textfield(
    name='Name',
    tooltip='Enter your name',
    x=100,
    y=700,
    width=300,
    height=20,
    borderStyle='underlined',
    borderColor='black',
    fillColor='white',
    textColor='black',
    forceBorder=True
)

can.save()

# Move to the beginning of the StringIO buffer
packet.seek(0)
new_pdf = PdfReader(packet)

# Read the existing PDF
existing_pdf = PdfReader(input_pdf)
writer = PdfWriter()

# Merge the new PDF with form fields onto the existing PDF
for page_num, page in enumerate(existing_pdf.pages):
    if page_num < len(new_pdf.pages):
        overlay = new_pdf.pages[page_num]
        merger = PageMerge(page)
        merger.add(overlay).render()
    writer.addpage(page)

# Write out the new PDF
writer.write(output_pdf)
```

#### **Explanation:**

1. **Create Form Fields:**
   - The script uses `reportlab` to create form fields (e.g., text fields) at specified coordinates.
2. **Merge with Existing PDF:**
   - `pdfrw` reads the existing PDF and overlays the form fields onto each page.
3. **Output:**
   - The resulting PDF (`fillable_output.pdf`) contains the added form fields.

**Pros:**
- Highly customizable.
- Can be integrated into larger automation pipelines.
- Free and open-source.

**Cons:**

#### **Installation:**

```bash
pip install pdfrw PyPDF2
```

#### **Basic Script Example:**

```python
import subprocess

# Define the path to the input and output PDFs
input_pdf = 'input.pdf'
output_pdf = 'fillable_output.pdf'

# Define form fields using a text file or script
# Example: Using pdftk to fill form fields
# Note: This requires pdftk to be installed on your system

# Example command to fill form fields
# subprocess.run(['pdftk', input_pdf, 'fill_form', 'data.fdf', 'output', output_pdf, 'flatten'])
```

**Note:** This example requires `pdftk` to be installed and may involve creating FDF (Forms Data Format) files to specify form field data.

**Pros:**
- Leverages powerful PDF manipulation tools.
- Can handle complex form requirements.

**Cons:**
- Requires external tools like `pdftk`.
- Scripting complexity increases with form complexity.

## **3. Leveraging Template-Based Automation**

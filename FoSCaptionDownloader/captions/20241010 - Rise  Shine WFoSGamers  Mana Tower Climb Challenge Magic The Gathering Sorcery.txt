[00:43:10] pole the yeah hold on are you talking
[00:43:12] about the
[00:43:15] uh pack pole
[00:43:20] Showdown an ior on the tower we can do
[00:43:22] an ioria on the tower we can do an ioria
[00:43:26] on the tower here we go so put a n Cory
[00:43:29] on the tower are you talking about that
[00:43:31] SP
[00:43:32] spicy spicy poppy because with the pack
[00:43:35] pole one is it was the one that we tried
[00:43:37] yesterday not too many people are
[00:43:38] interested in it what we do is I get
[00:43:39] three packs and I set up three singles
[00:43:42] also in colluding with them and pretty
[00:43:43] much it's um you buy your three packs
[00:43:46] you always get your three packs and what
[00:43:47] will happen is if you have uh your
[00:43:50] monetary value worth the cards in the
[00:43:52] pack do not make the say $3 or $5 or
[00:43:55] whatever the card is you get that $5
[00:43:56] card but then you can't get any other
[00:43:59] cards so it kind of goes on so like say
[00:44:01] you start with a draft a play and then a
[00:44:03] collector that way you know say if you
[00:44:05] don't get your money's worth you can get
[00:44:06] one card but you can't get all
[00:44:08] three all right here we go I'm going to
[00:44:11] put this on here for that and then we're
[00:44:13] going to say it as that there there you

[01:40:50] exceptional there
[01:40:55] uh on the back it will say curio instead
[01:40:58] of curiosa
[01:41:00] supposedly um so that's what the
[01:41:02] difference is my understanding that's
[01:41:03] always what I've been told now I've
[01:41:06] never seen
[01:41:08] one specifically but doesn't mean that
[01:41:11] it won't
[01:41:12] happen knew it was there I knew it I
[01:41:15] knew
[01:41:16] it I have not looked at the list to know
[01:41:18] which ones are going to be um the curio
[01:41:21] ones no have you I had had and done that
[01:41:24] we've been um getting rid of we've been

[01:41:28] know the hurricane stuff I haven't been
[01:41:29] doing as much as I could have
[01:41:32] been oh really there's little like
[01:41:34] there's little M all right yeah that's
[01:41:36] my understanding is a little bit
[01:41:37] different on the
[01:41:40] card go to
[01:41:41] atlas spell
[01:41:44] book Spellbook and an atlas then we have
[01:41:49] Shameless
[01:41:51] Squire so like you're saying he here it
[01:41:54] would say like curio and then something
[01:41:56] else on the backat on the front it would
[01:41:57] look different fin wife magic missiles
[01:42:01] sheerwood Huntress brown
[01:42:04] bears bog Reckless Squire so like this
[01:42:09] here we have Reckless Squire it would
[01:42:11] say Curio on the back and so instead of
[01:42:17] charge ah I I get
[01:42:19] it
[01:42:21] charge ham

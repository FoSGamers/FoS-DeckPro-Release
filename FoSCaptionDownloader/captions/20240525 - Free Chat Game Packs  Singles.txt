[00:37:18] the old cards and he asked if I he
[00:37:19] bought a few packs of them that he
[00:37:20] wanted um at one point but he goes you
[00:37:23] know that those ones some of the ones

[00:49:59] Loop pack right there that's going to be
[00:50:01] right
[00:50:02] there and I'm going to move this right
[00:50:04] here so I have space
[00:50:06] to open cards number five again one two
[00:50:11] three four five I should have guessed I
[00:50:13] should have guessed five now when you
[00:50:16] get in that Vault right when Vault you
[00:50:18] go oh gold I love gold go over to it and
[00:50:20] go it's just an envelope what is in this
[00:50:22] thing and in that envelope you go hm a
[00:50:24] pack of cards from 1993 what could it be
[00:50:28] Valiant era trading cards from the TR
[00:50:31] Valiant Universe from 1992 through 1992
[00:50:35] well wasn't that
[00:50:36] intriguing somebody thought that comic

[00:50:46] open you dropped your
[00:50:49] phone all right I can uh well somebody
[00:50:52] else wants to get on on it I bet I'm
[00:50:55] guessing somebody else is going to try
[00:50:56] to buy this for a do more than a dollar
[00:50:58] here that's what my guess is so but that
[00:51:02] is a dollar right now that's out there
[00:51:04] and if we need to I can uh I can cancel
[00:51:07] it but my guess is somebody will go for
[00:51:09] a dollar more than that and let's get
[00:51:10] this open here there we go we had
[00:51:13] somebody there you go that's going

[01:08:39] the chatbot to randomize it for you if
[01:08:41] you want based on each one of my games
[01:08:44] so the G will know what the rules of my

[01:09:19] nice and V strong now going from one
[01:09:21] strength a little tiny mutant up to a
[01:09:23] big beefy one with two strength as they
[01:09:25] wander through wonderful great you see
[01:09:28] something that do you go what is that
[01:09:30] thing you go oh it is a tentacle ah a
[01:09:33] friend hey friend that tentacle goes I'm

[01:10:00] wonderful nice and strong wandering
[01:10:03] through the Wasteland you see oh what's
[01:10:05] that in distance I can handle anything
[01:10:06] now oh it's a sand Warrior that is not
[01:10:10] as helpful that is not helpful that
[01:10:12] Warrior comes up and swings their mighty
[01:10:14] sword at you you duck but luckily the
[01:10:17] only thing they were really after was
[01:10:19] your food and you drop your food leaving
[01:10:23] you only at one two strength as you want
[01:10:25] wander through the Wasteland but that's
[01:10:26] okay two strength is acceptable when you
[01:10:29] wander through the Wasteland you could
[01:10:30] potentially fend off one of the bosses
[01:10:33] potentially too but you do see something
[01:10:35] in distance you're going over that
[01:10:36] golden pack what one we like my friend
[01:10:39] you go over there and right before you
[01:10:41] get to it you see oh no Sauron comes out

[01:10:47] flicks you ring finger flicks you punk
[01:10:50] right off the Vault wall bouncing you
[01:10:53] land but wandering with a concussion he
[01:10:56] doesn't really care he just laughs at

[01:27:55] kids read and learn science and math so
[01:27:58] unbelievably well that I don't

[02:03:02] train of thought I'm going trucking on
[02:03:04] the train I think about something else
[02:03:05] and I train on that way good keep going
[02:03:07] with the train of thought so my train is
[02:03:09] uh I have a horrible train of
[02:03:13] thought all right here we go put those
[02:03:16] babies together and then let's
[02:03:19] uh let's do our uh our game here damn it
[02:03:23] all right here we
[02:03:26] go so you get to pick a character for
[02:03:29] what you want to be in our wayand
[02:03:31] adventure all right and then what you do
[02:03:34] is you pick one of each of these colors
[02:03:36] one through each of these colors so you
[02:03:38] one green one blue one red and one blue
[02:03:41] it's 78 green 78 red and 78 blue and
[02:03:45] this tells you a plus or minus for your
[02:03:47] your character through the Wasteland
[02:03:49] Adventure then you get one out of 20 for
[02:03:52] a boss battle to see if you get a Beat
[02:03:56] the Boss because if you beat the boss we
[02:03:58] do what I call a Loot drop for a
[02:04:00] wasteland which is just a pack of cards
[02:04:02] we drop we sell for a dollar on here for
[02:04:05] all of you as a

[02:04:35] there are no commands you just tell me
[02:04:37] what you want to be OR technician all
[02:04:39] right so you choose to be a technician
[02:04:42] you are a technician wandering through
[02:04:44] this Wasteland and as you wander through
[02:04:48] you look for generally you try to find
[02:04:50] treasure because that'll help you so you
[02:04:51] get to pick one through 78 on green one
[02:04:54] through 78 on red one through 78 on blue
[02:04:57] and then one out of 20 for the boss and
[02:05:00] then those give you a plus or minus as
[02:05:02] you go through the Wasteland on what's
[02:05:04] going to happen and if you get enough
[02:05:05] that you beat a boss at the end we put a
[02:05:08] pack of cards out for a

[02:14:56] uh when I used to have a I used to have
[02:14:58] a scena site at Mighty Joe
[02:15:00] Campground I was on that Lake all the
[02:15:02] time I had a
[02:15:03] boat my wife lived grew up in
[02:15:09] Belmont my wife literally her hometown
[02:15:12] house is in Belmont where she grew up
[02:15:14] her entire

[00:06:48] mean it's all kinds of stuff that of
[00:06:49] where I am you know it's it's it's uh we
[00:06:51] live in a house it's no different the
[00:06:54] only difference is now I can take that
[00:06:56] house and move it somewhere else you
[00:06:58] know now I don't know that's kind of
[00:07:00] what I was thinking all right I'll put

[00:07:03] back I'm going to put that back I think
[00:07:05] I pulled that out from the front spot if

[00:14:31] feeling nice big and strong going
[00:14:33] through the Wasteland as this mutant now
[00:14:35] this you know becoming more of a super
[00:14:37] mutant than a mutant and you look and
[00:14:40] you see something in the distance it's
[00:14:42] green box here not a green box it's
[00:14:44] going to be something in the green box
[00:14:46] what is it that you see in the
[00:14:52] distance oh we're uh on Blue we're going
[00:14:55] eight okay green we have to go we go to
[00:14:57] green first before before we go to Blue

[00:15:21] two three four I like it all right and
[00:15:24] then the boss you'll be able to pick is
[00:15:26] one out of 10 next so as you wander
[00:15:28] through that Wasteland as a mutant you
[00:15:30] see something in the distance you going
[00:15:32] hm is that a friend as you munch on your
[00:15:34] food and in front of you you see
[00:15:37] something like what is that thing there
[00:15:40] huh looking at that going what is that
[00:15:43] you put your food
[00:15:45] down and you pick up this thing and you
[00:15:47] look at it and you go what is
[00:15:49] that you start wandering away because
[00:15:51] you completely forget about your food
[00:15:53] cuz you're reading this map then you
[00:15:55] realize you don't even know how to read
[00:15:56] as a mutant you just drop your
[00:15:59] food now you're back down to one
[00:16:01] strength and you don't know what to do
[00:16:03] anymore cuz you can't even read the map
[00:16:05] oh my God that's no good but maybe maybe
[00:16:10] you get lucky and there's a friend cuz
[00:16:12] you do see something else in the
[00:16:13] distance there you're like I don't know
[00:16:14] what that thing is over
[00:16:16] there you know I'm not
[00:16:18] sure what that is there in the distance
[00:16:21] so you look and you
[00:16:24] see a
[00:16:27] dwarf Berserker
[00:16:29] oh
[00:16:30] no the enemy comes swinging at you with
[00:16:33] their
[00:16:34] axe you put your Mighty arm up luckily
[00:16:37] he only chops a piece of your arm off
[00:16:39] leaving you at zero strength not
[00:16:41] completely killing you this dwarf is
[00:16:43] okay with taking a chunk of you as you
[00:16:45] run away but in the distance you see a
[00:16:48] vault you know I'm going to get to that
[00:16:50] Vault nice and safe one of those gold
[00:16:51] things you get right there because I'm
[00:16:54] sorry I don't think you have a chance of
[00:16:55] beating a boss with zero strength but
[00:16:57] you know what you still have to run into
[00:17:00] one before you get to that Wasteland
[00:17:02] vault as you go wandering to it you do
[00:17:05] have to bump into a boss before you get
[00:17:07] to that vault which BX is it going to be
[00:17:10] that you happen to bump into my
[00:17:17] friend the last one all right the last
[00:17:21] one is you're wandering and you you're
[00:17:24] barely stumbling your arm dangling off
[00:17:26] being chopped upart half and half by
[00:17:29] that uh Warrior and you're going into
[00:17:31] that Vault but just before you get to
[00:17:33] the Vault
[00:17:35] Owen comes riding by on his
[00:17:38] motorcycle grabbing the rest of your arm
[00:17:41] there tugging you to the ground and
[00:17:43] dragging you but luckily when he leaves
[00:17:45] you on his while he drags you away his
[00:17:47] Raptor has enough meat with his little
[00:17:49] piece of your arm
[00:17:50] there that they go riding off leaving
[00:17:53] you in front of that Vault where you get
[00:17:54] to pick of one of these I think there's
[00:17:57] only 17 left that in there we have to
[00:17:59] refill those I forgot about refilling
[00:18:01] those before the
[00:18:02] show you get one of 17 but you always
[00:18:05] get your packs so you get your packs

[01:15:22] they're like they do a good job a lot of
[01:15:25] the times but um I'm going to say
[01:15:28] something that's probably going to get
[01:15:29] people hating me since they made their
[01:15:32] new adjustments with their Union
[01:15:33] contract and whatever it was um I've had
[01:15:37] a lot more problems when it comes to um
[01:15:41] mail and stuff being on
[01:15:44] time I don't know what was done I really
[01:15:46] don't care it's just a anecdotal
[01:15:50] reference to things that have been going
[01:15:53] on recently since
[01:15:55] that has happened prior to that
[01:15:58] happening I had almost no issues things
[01:16:01] were on time sometimes things are even
[01:16:03] early so I don't know just one of those
[01:16:07] anecdotal evidence for yourself take it
[01:16:10] as you will I've worked for companies
[01:16:12] with that had unions and they were
[01:16:13] really good so I don't know anybody
[01:16:15] about these people I'm just saying is
[01:16:17] this is what happened after and I

[01:18:07] the Wasteland here whenever uh you do an
[01:18:11] adventure in the
[01:18:14] Wasteland this is going to start you out
[01:18:16] with here you go I show you the packs
[01:18:18] there so you know that gets you one
[01:18:21] strength for your character in The
[01:18:22] Wasteland so you get to choose your
[01:18:25] character here and while you choose your
[01:18:27] character I'm going to actually uh
[01:18:31] adjust where the pogs are here and push
[01:18:35] these off to the side a little bit that
[01:18:37] way have a little bit of room here to go
[01:18:39] and open some things all
[01:18:41] right there we
[01:18:44] go nobody gets mad here well that's good
[01:18:46] to know I appreciate that we got that
[01:18:50] was already pulled out and here we go
[01:18:53] we're going to see what you get my
[01:18:55] friends hopefully you get yourself some
[01:18:58] good stuff as your character and you're
[01:19:00] able to beat that boss at the end of the
[01:19:02] Wasteland adventure to win and get
[01:19:05] yourself something wonderful maybe uh a
[01:19:08] nice pack of Cs
[01:19:15] there thank you Gustavo I'll let you
[01:19:18] know I'll be like this is when you get
[01:19:22] mad you pick you pick a red one a green
[01:19:25] one a blue one and then one from the
[01:19:28] boss correct Now red has 78 cards green
[01:19:32] has 78 cards blue has 12 and the bosses
[01:19:36] over here these are 10 now each one of
[01:19:39] the colored ones are either a plus one
[01:19:41] or a minus one on your
[01:19:43] strength and then that's depending on
[01:19:45] what you get you can be depends on how
[01:19:47] many bosses you could beat so at the
[01:19:49] most this could get you if you're lucky
[01:19:51] enough to get four strength you could
[01:19:53] beat up to
[01:19:55] I think four of the bosses in there
[01:19:58] maybe three I think it's three of the
[01:20:00] bosses actually three of the bosses not
[01:20:01] four but either way that's what it is
[01:20:04] there but you pick one from each each
[01:20:07] one of the colors and then one of the
[01:20:09] bosses so whatever you'd like
[01:20:12] there and you uh pick your character all
[01:20:16] right S8 seven and eight I like it all
[01:20:19] right so choose what you want for a
[01:20:22] character and we're going to do that I'm
[01:20:23] going to do number seven for the first
[01:20:25] one is normally what you do is red so we
[01:20:27] go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 we go red is normally
[01:20:32] the first place we go to then green is
[01:20:35] the next St we go to 1 2 3 four five 6 7

[01:21:07] characters at the top I'm sorry maybe I
[01:21:09] was confusing on the pack the cards

[01:42:55] the red button
[01:42:59] Gustavo the red button Gustavo I'll tell
[01:43:01] you what that is now the red button is
[01:43:04] something that I I am not a big I
[01:43:06] actually did not really want to create
[01:43:09] it but it was requested of me from some
[01:43:12] people because they wanted something
[01:43:14] where there was like a big hit
[01:43:19] possibility and with that being said
[01:43:23] I didn't have anything that was like a
[01:43:25] big
[01:43:26] hit at the time I didn't have any big
[01:43:28] cards or anything like that I was going
[01:43:29] to put in there so they're like well if
[01:43:33] you don't have any big cards like put
[01:43:34] like a box of something in there I'm
[01:43:35] like all right I'll do that so I made it
[01:43:38] 1,600 cards there's a bunch of packs in
[01:43:41] there anything from like collector
[01:43:42] boosters and stuff like that but I'm
[01:43:43] telling you you do not want to press it
[01:43:46] because the odds are not in your favor
[01:43:47] they are way out of your favor dude
[01:43:49] there's 1,600 cards they're all under a
[01:43:51] dollar with there's a few of them all a
[01:43:53] dollar there's most of them are between
[01:43:55] like 50 cents and 10 cents so they're
[01:43:56] very low and but the only thing is some
[01:44:00] of them have booster packs written on
[01:44:02] them and one of them has this written on
[01:44:04] it right
[01:44:06] here has that written on it the left
[01:44:09] over, 1400 packs cards in there I think
[01:44:12] it's 1400 is that are in there have that
[01:44:14] written on it that's what it is there
[01:44:22] [Laughter]
[01:44:23] see you anybody know the uh you remember
[01:44:26] anybody see The Fifth Element movie I
[01:44:29] don't know if anybody's ever seen Fifth
[01:44:30] Element
[01:44:31] here but uh that's that my that was my
[01:44:35] inspiration for the button by the way
[01:44:38] was uh The Fifth Element where the if
[01:44:42] you know what I'm talking
[01:44:44] about you're like nobody ever ask about
[01:44:46] that nobody asked about the red button
[01:44:49] Zar yes the zf1 you know what I'm
[01:44:52] talking about cool where you knew
[01:44:54] exactly what I was talking

[02:09:04] and not have to uh figure anything out
[02:09:06] generally they just can add stuff
[02:09:08] together there's not a lot of triggers
[02:09:10] and that's what I kind of like about
[02:09:11] those like the only triggers are like
[02:09:13] plus one or minus something for someone
[02:09:16] or something like that and I think
[02:09:17] that's why that those type of decks at
[02:09:19] least for the kids are nice they like to
[02:09:21] play

[02:11:29] Willam a little bit
[02:11:31] first all right here you go let's see
[02:11:34] what is another one I'm guessing it's
[02:11:35] the same thing yes it is it is all the
[02:11:39] same it all is the same in here all
[02:11:42] right let's put up a
[02:11:45] uh different thing here let's just put
[02:11:49] out some Outlaws
[02:11:52] with an
[02:11:54] ioria let's put that one out there I
[02:11:57] like

[02:12:11] that's going to be one strength on your
[02:12:12] adventure in the Wasteland if you want
[02:12:15] it that here you go that is not correct
[02:12:24] jeez all right here we
[02:12:27] go conclave land
[02:12:29] interesting hey Lord spe Lord
[02:12:33] spenos Lord I'm guessing that's Lord
[02:12:36] right how you doing today I have a hard
[02:12:40] time I can't read anybody's name people
[02:12:42] come in and disappear and then and then
[02:12:43] it's like it doesn't show their names
[02:12:45] anymore it's hard for me to know what's
[02:12:47] going on
[02:12:54] all righty what is in this
[02:13:09] box here we
[02:13:13] go yeah there we go I did get them all
[02:13:17] in
[02:13:22] yeah I know exactly even a little bit
[02:13:24] more specific than
[02:13:30] that I don't know if I can try to do
[02:13:35] that to combine things but I'm not sure
[02:13:38] how that'll work Gustavo I'm I'm not
[02:13:41] 100% positive on that um I know I cannot
[02:13:44] ship it I can I won't ship it right away
[02:13:46] and if you win something else I can try
[02:13:47] to combine it but I'm not sure on how
[02:13:50] that works
[02:13:52] because I know it does let me bundle
[02:13:53] things for people I've never done it
[02:13:56] before though where
[02:13:59] um it's been across different things if
[02:14:02] it's in the same show fine but I've
[02:14:04] never done it across different ones and
[02:14:05] I think you should be able to so I'm
[02:14:07] pretty sure I should be able to save
[02:14:08] that I don't see why I couldn't should
[02:14:11] make sense got some other uh stuff in
[02:14:13] here
[02:14:14] some secret layer
[02:14:17] Fallout if you want any of those
[02:14:27] yes it does make you send it out by a
[02:14:28] certain time frame I think it's like one
[02:14:30] or two days they want you to send it out
[02:14:33] so that's why I mean like I'm not sure
[02:14:34] how long I can hold it for type
[02:14:37] thing let's throw out a uh a flash
[02:14:41] sale we'll do it with a reward box some
[02:14:45] reward

[00:26:32] off off my lap onto the floor when I was
[00:26:33] sleeping and it's because I just started
[00:26:35] to sleep

[00:26:41] it just like slid
[00:26:44] off and it was just on its side I like
[00:26:47] uh I don't remember putting that like
[00:26:48] that on its side that's interesting
[00:26:50] there you go Mystic nice little rad

[00:27:49] them they're out of order
[00:27:59] they were out of
[00:28:01] order that's what it
[00:28:04] was well that works like this now here

[00:28:10] okay no one wants jumper no one wants to
[00:28:13] be a jumper today but maybe somebody
[00:28:15] wants to reanimate what was jumped off
[00:28:16] or something oh I shouldn't have said
[00:28:19] that that's inappropriate I'm G to get
[00:28:20] yelled at someone's going to yell at me
[00:28:30] they had to put a they had to put a

[00:45:34] week of meetings and my boss had not
[00:45:37] again once again I had a meeting with
[00:45:38] him he didn't make it any better but
[00:45:39] this time I was like you know what [ __ ]
[00:45:41] it I'm done deal with him I told him
[00:45:42] it's either his boss is going to be in a
[00:45:44] meeting with us from now on or HR
[00:45:45] because I'm not dealing with this [ __ ]
[00:45:47] pretty much after I caught him lying um
[00:45:50] he tried to long story short he said
[00:45:52] that he calculated my time off which um
[00:45:56] and said that had an exceptional amount
[00:45:57] of time off which is over six months I'm
[00:45:59] like what are you talking about well he
[00:46:01] was counting every time I took like an
[00:46:02] hour and I left early which I'd make up
[00:46:04] another time during another time I was
[00:46:05] on salary I always told that well you
[00:46:09] know give me a hard time so I was like
[00:46:10] whatever I'll [ __ ] go and change it
[00:46:13] so I went and made some adjustments put
[00:46:15] my time in but I sent stuff over to HR
[00:46:16] because I'm like I'm pretty sure this
[00:46:17] isn't allowed and they like yeah we need
[00:46:19] to talk about this um and also in the
[00:46:22] process of that when he said goes oh I
[00:46:25] calculated your time in an email
[00:46:27] well um comes down to he didn't I asked
[00:46:30] because and I response to the email was
[00:46:32] um or well like I said all right if you
[00:46:34] calculate time you mind and let me know
[00:46:35] what the days are that way I can
[00:46:38] um just go and update them and if there
[00:46:40] is something wrong or what the reason
[00:46:42] was I'll explain what it is like if and
[00:46:44] like if I missed a bunch yeah in uh in
[00:46:47] our one-on-one meeting he's like you
[00:46:48] know I don't appreciate you making me go
[00:46:50] and calculate all the time off that you
[00:46:52] did like what are you talking about
[00:46:53] calculate all the time off I didn't ask
[00:46:54] you to do that you said you already did
[00:46:55] it you said you had you had calculated
[00:46:57] time off in the in the email you sent to
[00:47:00] me a week
[00:47:04] ago and he got flustered well and didn't
[00:47:08] know how to H
[00:47:12] it but now I got HR involved because
[00:47:14] he's lying and he's forcing me to take
[00:47:16] time off when it's only supposed to be
[00:47:17] in in half day and full day
[00:47:20] increments so he's making me take it off
[00:47:22] an hour and a half to three hour
[00:47:24] increments was the most that I had I had
[00:47:25] one day which was a three hour one which
[00:47:27] I can understand maybe saying tell me to
[00:47:28] take a half day but that was with a boss
[00:47:30] that I had before him which allowed me
[00:47:32] to take that time off split out through
[00:47:33] the day through the week to add it
[00:47:36] up which I worked a couple during
[00:47:38] lunches and stuff like
[00:47:40] that so now he's going on his stuff like
[00:47:43] that with me to attack me since he can't
[00:47:45] attack my job he's now saying that I'm
[00:47:47] not doing my job he's uh he's going
[00:47:49] after me for work uh for my
[00:47:52] time but now I got HR involved
[00:47:55] especially because of the dime time
[00:47:56] thing so now luckily I have a day off
[00:47:58] don't need to deal with it
[00:47:59] anymore and uh
[00:48:02] yeah hang out with you guys literally
[00:48:05] getting off of work every day with a
[00:48:06] headache hey [ __ ] happens dude but you
[00:48:09] know what from what I understand him
[00:48:11] doing that is gonna be get a lot of
[00:48:12] trouble for him because he's forcing me
[00:48:14] to break the law he's actually like
[00:48:15] breaking a law by telling me to take
[00:48:17] time forcing me to take time off that is
[00:48:19] not actually supposed to be taken off
[00:48:21] taken
[00:48:22] off is what I've been told by multiple
[00:48:24] people like that's interesting I didn't
[00:48:26] know that
[00:48:27] and that's I think that's why HR
[00:48:29] immediately responded to me saying hey I
[00:48:32] uh we need to talk about this tomorrow
[00:48:33] like next week on Tuesday and they set
[00:48:35] up an appointment like two days

[01:47:22] kill Tren
[01:47:25] yeah I have some I I uh put it this way
[01:47:29] I have now built an app for my job
[01:47:31] actually even because I was in they said
[01:47:34] they had a problem so I built an app to
[01:47:35] uh fix a problem that they couldn't
[01:47:37] figure out and um I was asked what I had
[01:47:41] been doing in my spare time because they
[01:47:42] seemed like I had a lot of free time
[01:47:43] like well no one was doing anything or
[01:47:45] and there was nothing for me to do so I
[01:47:46] was doing stuff in my free time like
[01:47:48] well what was it well yesterday I showed
[01:47:50] them the full product and they were all
[01:47:51] they had nothing to say
[01:47:53] because my product will fix everything
[01:47:55] that we're even trying to do because it
[01:47:56] does everything prompting through
[01:47:58] automatically through chat through our
[01:48:00] Liberty our GPT service that we have and
[01:48:04] um they don't need to do anything
[01:48:06] anymore it automatically does
[01:48:10] it
[01:48:13] so I just like not I didn't mean to but
[01:48:16] I might have actually just got rid of
[01:48:18] someone's
[01:48:19] job more than someone's could have been
[01:48:22] like some buddies a bunch of
[01:48:26] them all right now our back one here my
[01:48:29] friend is good luck is oh we I already

[01:53:06] yeah all
[01:53:13] righty now if I miss something in chat

[01:53:39] insane with my work I haven't paid
[01:53:41] attention as well as I should have been
[01:53:42] for everything it's really what it boils
[01:53:44] down real what it blows down
[01:53:50] to maybe you want a little
[01:53:55] this yeah this is like I just do this
[01:53:57] for fun so like my regular job was just
[01:54:00] uh long story short not so great of a
[01:54:03] time with the new a new boss that I've

[01:54:22] guess is that uh my my guess is that
[01:54:26] people are uh don't I'm guessing the
[01:54:28] chat is too there's too much stuff going
[01:54:29] on is my guess all right I'm gon to put
[01:54:32] this away
[01:54:35] here which is also why I'm I built my
[01:54:39] own thing to do it a little bit
[01:54:41] differently so yeah what I built my plan
[01:54:47] is actually to allow
[01:54:50] it to um
[01:54:53] allow you to play it and
[01:54:57] also the
[01:55:01] um it'll save your
[01:55:04] interactions and all that stuff so that
[01:55:07] in the future you can actually start up
[01:55:09] again at the same place and you'll also
[01:55:12] be able to
[01:55:16] um play it well it's not in here I was

[02:49:34] [Music]
[02:49:37] right all right so that's where we're at
[02:49:41] there and I got a random call I need to
[02:49:44] figure out why I got a call from my bank
[02:49:46] that doesn't happen generally
[02:49:49] I'm guessing there's an issue
[02:49:51] somewhere have to go look at my bank
[02:49:53] account
[02:49:56] quickly my guess is um probably got my
[02:50:00] card shut off because somebody's trying
[02:50:01] to steal
[02:50:04] [ __ ] let's do a quick check here for me
[02:50:41] I think I'm good I'll have to check see
[02:50:44] what they were looking
[02:50:45] for but there you go they didn't leave a
[02:50:48] message Mage which is weird so I'm
[02:50:49] wondering if it was somebody I've been
[02:50:51] getting a lot of scam calls recently CU
[02:50:52] somebody got some of my information
[02:50:54] online so I'm wondering if somebody
[02:50:56] pushing out saying that they're bank and
[02:50:57] they're not actually there you go
[02:51:01] Julie you saved the city oh you did it
[02:51:06] and saved the city
[02:51:17] [Music]
[02:51:20] nice hey well perfect that's awesome
[02:51:24] that you get something you need I love
[02:51:26] when I'm able to do
[02:51:27] that all right let's um throw some more
[02:51:31] things out
[02:51:34] here Let's do let's try to get a um
[02:51:38] let's try let's play our game and let's
[02:51:40] try to get a uh a monoc crypt I think
[02:51:43] that's what we do
[02:51:44] here I'll throw out one of my giveaways
[02:51:46] I forgot to run that earlier
[02:51:50] let's do that in right now let's try to
[02:51:53] get a monoc crypt right
[02:51:55] here can't guarantee it but we can try
[02:51:58] we can
[02:52:00] try there you go and you play that game

[02:52:16] Wasteland so there you go try those
[02:52:20] out Bank didn't leave a message which is
[02:52:23] why which is weird to
[02:52:24] me because
[02:52:26] generally they leave a
[02:52:28] message so that's why I don't think it
[02:52:30] was actually my bank
[02:52:34] calling I think it was somebody that
[02:52:36] tried to say their phone number was at
[02:52:37] and like pushed it that way you like

[03:15:54] want to watch
[03:15:55] spawn you're young yeah sure watch Spa
[03:15:58] it's a cartoon which they thought it was
[03:15:59] a cartoon parents you know and then you
[03:16:02] got you you flip over the skinx part of
[03:16:04] it in the middle to watch uh you know
[03:16:08] Dashboard Confessional or or or red red
[03:16:10] car Diaries or whatever the hell that

[03:16:30] on never I don't know what you're
[03:16:33] talking about I have no idea that's my
[03:16:37] last one of those by the
[03:16:39] way I don't actually have any of those
[03:16:41] left I forgot all those I had one threw
[03:16:44] it there we also had that um we had one
[03:16:47] of the boxes that could get all the
[03:16:48] channels because my um my cousin worked
[03:16:52] at the uh worked for the um cable
[03:16:56] company so he gave us a box that allowed
[03:16:58] us to get
[03:17:03] everything yeah that would have been a
[03:17:04] sweet one if it did
[03:17:06] that some cross over like that that
[03:17:08] would be kind of
[03:17:14] cool all right dragon
[03:17:17] you get to pick a character in our
[03:17:19] Wasteland Adventure here and go on a
[03:17:22] trip through the adventure in our
[03:17:23] Wasteland if you would like that is we
[03:17:25] can always just rip your pack if you
[03:17:26] don't want to but that being said you

[03:17:38] red 78
[03:17:40] green 12
[03:17:42] blue and 20 for the boss now you go
[03:17:45] through the Wasteland seeing if you can
[03:17:47] beat the boss and if you beat the boss
[03:17:49] we do a $1 Loot drop which is a pack of
[03:17:51] do cards for a dollar for everyone but
[03:17:53] every single time you always get one of
[03:17:55] those golden packs over there could be
[03:17:57] something like the spawn one it could be
[03:17:58] something silly where it's like a Disney
[03:18:00] movie you know but whatever is in
[03:18:06] there oh they did I didn't know they did

[03:19:16] and you said you wanted to be a
[03:19:18] detective one there then we're going to
[03:19:20] shuffle these

[03:20:11] dizzy you're starting to feel sick no
[03:20:13] good no good but you know what maybe
[03:20:16] there's a friend that'll help you in the
[03:20:17] distance and you see a copy come up to

[03:20:47] poisoned you hope to find something in
[03:20:50] the distance maybe you're dizzy you
[03:20:53] can't see it's hard to see and you see a
[03:20:55] fungus dinosaur come charging towards

[03:28:39] one out of this pack no one has bought
[03:28:42] it yet and I've been waiting on that one
[03:28:44] for a little while maybe somebody
[03:28:47] would I've been told that a few times
[03:28:50] dragon and I actually have been um
[03:28:53] working on a D and D story myself that I
[03:28:57] was going to be doing a um somebody told
[03:29:01] me I should do a dungeon master so I was
[03:29:03] going to look I've been looking at roll
[03:29:04] 20 been building U my own little thing
[03:29:06] to do a game with it and U I was
[03:29:09] thinking of doing it where we would um
[03:29:12] kind of I was going to do it like a
[03:29:14] patron way the way I was going to do
[03:29:16] would be people would buy into the to
[03:29:18] doing the game and what we would do is
[03:29:20] we'd have packs of cards that open up to
[03:29:22] be random for the bosses and that's and
[03:29:25] you get those that we where we're
[03:29:27] playing with the game but it will be
[03:29:29] open to be random randomized bosses in a
[03:29:34] way so like maybe you'll throw ioria
[03:29:37] because we have to worry about Godzilla

[03:29:55] that together

[03:42:28] the two of them let me get a drake I'll
[03:42:29] be right back here my drink is empty
[03:42:51] all
[03:42:53] right so
[03:42:55] Royal Royal's going with the two here
[03:42:58] now do you want me to just rip or you
[03:42:59] gonna actually play the game because
[03:43:01] this is going to get you
[03:43:03] um two strength you get to pick your
[03:43:06] character Mr collectible or Miss
[03:43:09] collectible or the collectible person
[03:43:12] whatever it is I'm sorry I I always
[03:43:14] forget I make assumptions that I should
[03:43:16] not be
[03:43:18] making but you pick your character and
[03:43:21] then you have two strength to wander
[03:43:23] through to hopefully beat one of our
[03:43:25] bosses right here at the end that'll
[03:43:27] allow you to uh explain the game all
[03:43:29] right so the game is you pick one of
[03:43:31] those four characters you wander through
[03:43:34] the Wasteland and what you really do is
[03:43:36] you pick through three of these boxes
[03:43:38] here all right so you pick one red one
[03:43:41] green one blue and then one of the
[03:43:44] bosses and what happens is you're an
[03:43:46] animated character you go through the
[03:43:48] Wasteland and depending on what you pick
[03:43:50] up it's either going to be a plus one or
[03:43:52] a minus one for your character on its
[03:43:54] strength so you're starting out at two
[03:43:56] you could potentially get up to five
[03:43:57] strength and say you pull out a boss to
[03:44:01] fight and you go oh well that one
[03:44:03] bounces off it but say you pull out one
[03:44:04] of our ones that you can beat like camax
[03:44:07] you'll beat that and we'll do a $1 we'll
[03:44:09] drop a pack of cards we call it a Loot
[03:44:11] drop for a dollar for everybody in the
[03:44:13] Wasteland
[03:44:15] and you get to buy it for a dollar or
[03:44:17] bid on it for a dollar but you always
[03:44:19] get one of those gold envelopes there
[03:44:22] that is just like a little thank you for
[03:44:23] playing cards pack it's just a pack of
[03:44:26] cards are any that are anywhere from

[03:44:31] were under a dollar that I got from like
[03:44:32] a flea market type thing that's all it
[03:44:35] is so you want to play the game or not
[03:44:38] it's up to
[03:44:40] you here's a little
[03:44:46] there's what it
[03:44:49] is and that's how the boxes

[04:12:25] I was tired of dealing with them and
[04:12:27] they're like we need to talk to you
[04:12:28] about this right away because the that
[04:12:31] um forcing you to take time off
[04:12:33] combining stuff to me one make time to
[04:12:36] be a day is I I was told by a few
[04:12:39] different people it's illegal and I
[04:12:40] thought it was too so I just did what he
[04:12:42] said and I'm like I'm [ __ ] done
[04:12:43] dealing with him I did what he said and
[04:12:46] I'm dealing with HR
[04:12:48] now because I had already talked to my
[04:12:51] um his director his boss because I'm
[04:12:54] like I don't know how to handle this guy
[04:12:56] he's I've caught him lying
[04:12:58] twice and now he's like he's just keeps
[04:13:01] trying to dig down into
[04:13:04] me literally lied in an
[04:13:10] email yeah me too flat out out lied in
[04:13:13] an email said he did something all right
[04:13:16] here's what's happened he said I he said
[04:13:17] my hours weren't correct and he
[04:13:19] calculated my hours because my hours
[04:13:21] were wrong and I needed to adjust all my
[04:13:22] hours and he calculated how much off
[04:13:24] they were I'm like okay fine if you're
[04:13:26] going to tell me you calculate my hours
[04:13:28] I'm not playing this [ __ ] game with
[04:13:29] you where I'm GNA go and fill him out
[04:13:31] and think that I did it right and you go
[04:13:33] well why did you not fill this out you
[04:13:34] trying to tell me you didn't do this
[04:13:36] when I already calculated it so I
[04:13:37] responded to him and said hey um you
[04:13:40] know you calculated this can you let me
[04:13:41] know what they are I'll fill it out and
[04:13:43] correct them and if there's an issue
[04:13:45] with something that you want to talk
[04:13:46] about we can talk about it well he
[04:13:49] didn't respond to me did not say
[04:13:50] anything to me a week went by our
[04:13:54] one-on-one occurs and he goes I don't
[04:13:57] appreciate that you made me go and look
[04:13:58] through all of your calendar to see the
[04:14:00] time that you took off with when I asked
[04:14:04] youi to do that I'm like no you said you
[04:14:07] calculated it and you asked me to do it
[04:14:10] and then I said my response to you was
[04:14:13] if you since you already calculated it
[04:14:16] then just let me know what they are and
[04:14:17] I I'll take care of it and correct
[04:14:20] it and like you said it in the email if
[04:14:23] you didn't say you hadn't calculated the
[04:14:24] time off I wouldn't have said anything
[04:14:26] and he like oh well I didn't really uh I
[04:14:28] mean I didn't calculate it specific uh
[04:14:31] like specifically calculate it I I mean
[04:14:33] like you know I kind of like like uh
[04:14:37] yep so that's what happened and at that
[04:14:40] point the meeting went from tolerable
[04:14:43] cuz we were talking to each other to him
[04:14:45] trying to find a problem all the way to
[04:14:47] when he's like well explain what you did
[04:14:49] for the last month I'm like you know
[04:14:50] what we're done with
[04:14:52] this I'm not dealing with you anymore

[04:15:00] don't know what you do I don't think you
[04:15:01] do your job tell me what you did for the
[04:15:03] last month and at that point I looked at

[04:15:10] in every phone call we have from now on
[04:15:12] or HR you can make a choice on how you

[04:15:17] be me saying absolutely nothing because
[04:15:20] I not talking you anymore unless one of
[04:15:22] them are
[04:15:24] here and he's like fine I guess the
[04:15:27] conversation's over mik iy guess it is
[04:15:29] have a good day because I don't lie he's
[04:15:33] now lied twice that I've caught him in
[04:15:36] the two times I've caught him lying he
[04:15:37] flips out in a way and tries to do stuff
[04:15:39] to me to get me in trouble
[04:15:43] so he's I I've already asked to be off
[04:15:45] his team I complain about him in
[04:15:47] February doing [ __ ] like this to
[04:15:48] other
[04:15:50] people um so between now he wrote down a
[04:15:54] lie so I literally have him writing a
[04:15:56] lie down now not just lying to me he
[04:16:00] literally lied on
[04:16:07] paper oh he's a [ __ ] horrible person

[04:16:16] complains about me taking time off M
[04:16:18] have you looked at the days that I take

[04:16:54] me and and he did the same thing well I
[04:16:57] didn't really fully that means you
[04:16:59] didn't [ __ ] do it and then this time
[04:17:01] I caught it in
[04:17:03] writing so I'm like I'm done dealing
[04:17:05] with him I don't deal with [ __ ]
[04:17:07] Liars he's going to lie about what I do
[04:17:09] to try to get me fired
[04:17:15] yeah exactly blows my
[04:17:18] mind I know so many things in this world
[04:17:21] have been like to prove to people like
[04:17:24] if you do [ __ ] like that you end up
[04:17:25] getting [ __ ] if you lie you get
[04:17:30] screwed in the
[04:17:34] end oh I think the problem is I do stay
[04:17:36] my ground and I have since he became my
[04:17:39] boss because the person that hired me
[04:17:42] before happened to be one of the people
[04:17:43] laid off but he was
[04:17:44] also he was actually at the highest pay
[04:17:47] grade in as a manager so I suspect
[04:17:49] that's the reason why he was laid off
[04:17:51] because every time we made a comment
[04:17:52] about him the director was like we had
[04:17:54] to let go really good people there was
[04:17:57] nothing I could do about
[04:17:59] it so like that one was the one that
[04:18:02] hired me exceptional boss exceptional
[04:18:04] manager this new one I've had him for
[04:18:07] like since the beginning of the year
[04:18:09] [ __ ]
[04:18:11] horrible all right
[04:18:13] so no one wants this what I'm going to
[04:18:15] do is I'm going to show off a little bit
[04:18:19] of my cards that I got
[04:18:26] myself because I don't remember what I
[04:18:28] [Laughter]
[04:18:32] got hey I don't know what you do buddy
[04:18:35] what do you do for work currently I
[04:18:38] develop stuff I actually built an app
[04:18:40] already to fix all half of their
[04:18:42] problems because I was tired of him
[04:18:43] complaining about something that
[04:18:44] something couldn't be done I'm like [ __ ]
[04:18:46] you it can be so I built an app that
[04:18:48] fixed their
[04:18:49] [ __ ] and they were all speechless they
[04:18:51] didn't know what to do everybody on the
[04:18:53] team was complaining about something I'm
[04:18:54] like you know what [ __ ] this literally
[04:18:56] built an app in like two weeks week no
[04:19:00] more of a week because I modified an app
[04:19:02] that I already
[04:19:04] had you need an app for a business what
[04:19:06] do you
[04:19:10] need yeah he told me that won't happen
[04:19:12] I'm like [ __ ] you that's because you're
[04:19:14] an idiot not because I
[04:19:17] am literally built an app that that um
[04:19:21] hooks into uh GPT to do exactly what we
[04:19:24] need when the other people couldn't
[04:19:26] figure it
[04:19:28] out hey if you need an app yeah
[04:19:30] definitely talk to me definitely don't
[04:19:33] reach out um send me a message
[04:19:35] Royal and um like I'll get you my phone
[04:19:38] number and stuff and we can talk
[04:19:43] not a problem
[04:19:48] definitely yeah because I I mean I I
[04:19:51] have um I'm in the process I'm almost
[04:19:52] done I built a chat bot actually for
[04:19:55] myself so that'll work on any of my live
[04:19:58] streams it's G to combine all my chats
[04:20:00] so like the people that watch me in

[04:21:03] let me look through some of my other
[04:21:04] cards yeah but send me a message I've
[04:21:06] been I've built a few different apps to
[04:21:07] do things recently

[04:21:14] that way you can see what sorcery looks
[04:21:17] like here we go throw sorcery oh why

[04:21:29] we got a minor explosion these are alpha
[04:21:32] by the way fire
[04:21:36] harpoons swamp
[04:21:38] Buffalo Trojan
[04:21:40] Cavalry pirate ship oh I love that art
[04:21:42] on that pirate
[04:21:46] ship that's you know I have I have to
[04:21:49] admit Night Owl it does the same to me
[04:21:50] too when I get to come on I know I'm
[04:21:52] gonna be generally for the most part
[04:21:54] having a good time snow
[04:21:56] leopard Alene
[04:22:01] dryads a little blink the art is so good
[04:22:05] on
[04:22:05] these that's what I like about these so
[04:22:08] much
[04:22:09] ogre exorcism
[04:22:14] little simple Village we have not my
[04:22:17] exceptional nice little fantasmal
[04:22:21] shade mine cart o that's cool I haven't
[04:22:24] seen that one
[04:22:27] yet Fay changeling and then my unique
[04:22:31] Midland
[04:22:32] Army that was a nice one nice unique on
[04:22:34] that one
[04:22:37] there
[04:22:38] sorcery yes
[04:22:43] sorcery it is it is a um a new one what
[04:22:48] three years old I think it was when it
[04:22:50] came out
[04:22:54] for it's like a uh a combination of
[04:22:57] Chess and Magic it actually is really
[04:23:00] fun the few times that I've played um
[04:23:03] we've had a lot of fun playing so like I
[04:23:06] will I have to see I I have to say it is
[04:23:08] one of
[04:23:09] probably the most fun games I've played
[04:23:16] yes definitely beautiful they even feel
[04:23:20] feel good if that makes any sense like
[04:23:22] when you touch them they feel like a
[04:23:24] card they don't feel like they're going
[04:23:26] to fall apart in your hand or like
[04:23:28] plastic junk you know you have a card in
[04:23:31] your
[04:23:35] hand the artist are a few different ones
[04:23:37] actually there's some people from
[04:23:39] original U magic people if I remember
[04:23:42] right and there's some
[04:23:46] others throw this one out here if you
[04:23:49] want i' have to check on on the artist
[04:23:52] there
[04:23:56] [Music]
[04:24:03] but I had one drop of Pop get on some
[04:24:07] magic cars the other day and it ruined
[04:24:10] them oh no
[04:24:14] yeah exactly exactly like if you put it
[04:24:17] exactly they feel like a solid thing if
[04:24:19] you drop like a little bit of liquid on
[04:24:22] it you could rub it off instantaneously
[04:24:24] and you'd be fine that's like how good
[04:24:26] of they feel like I I'm like I don't
[04:24:29] know how else to explain it they they're
[04:24:31] just a good card they feel it's they put
[04:24:34] effort into it they knew they needed to
[04:24:37] so they did
[04:24:49] yes yep yeah it's a lot of the people
[04:24:52] that were originals from um magic people
[04:24:56] that kind of ended up going away and
[04:24:57] doing different stuff when in
[04:25:01] sorcery yeah I don't know what they use
[04:25:03] but it's really good card stock
[04:25:06] yes let me see I got another one here

[04:29:18] sent it to him
[04:29:22] already but it looks like it didn't go
[04:29:24] through and it was probably me not
[04:29:25] paying attention to everything getting

[04:38:16] do you need to be here on whatnot with
[04:38:19] me hanging out
[04:38:25] though all
[04:38:28] righty choices are
[04:38:30] fun especially when they're randomized I
[04:38:33] can't randomize them here though I get
[04:38:35] yelled at so that's why you get the
[04:38:38] choice straight away straight up there I
[04:38:41] like doing the randomization like in the
[04:38:43] game in in in
[04:38:46] chat I'm with my other chat B I was
[04:38:48] going to build in some other
[04:38:49] randomization things so that if you want
[04:38:52] to make something as a choice by random
[04:38:54] you can and pull out numbers or whatever
[04:38:57] it is I don't need to be the one to do
[04:38:58] it you guys can do
[04:38:59] it but that's what I'm building into the
[04:39:02] other one stuff like that it'll respond
[04:39:04] to you and tell you things on some
[04:39:08] funest my band my B my B all right

[04:39:46] rattling of your trunk I'm like I
[04:39:49] know it's because I I never I never had

[04:41:09] as high as possible you could see my
[04:41:10] windows going like this
[04:41:16] I'm sorry that was a little bit more
[04:41:17] excitement for myself and
[04:41:22] others yeah stuff's hovering all around
[04:41:25] [ __ ] papers start
[04:41:32] floating my favorite was my car was a
[04:41:34] piece of [ __ ] compared to others because
[04:41:36] I couldn't afford a great car but I um I

[04:41:54] all brand new stuff mine's not brand new
[04:41:56] it was used I bought it through people
[04:41:58] because I didn't have [ __ ] money to
[04:41:59] buy brand new stuff so they fixed their
[04:42:01] truck or vehicle and we're giving away
[04:42:03] or selling it I bought it off of you
[04:42:04] know Craigslist at that time so that's
[04:42:07] how I put my sound system together but

[04:42:36] speaker up with my trunk open I go and
[04:42:39] you can just see everything around start
[04:42:41] vibrating he's like the guy just looks

[04:42:45] yeah my car be
[04:42:47] like like yeah my car is a piece of [ __ ]

[04:42:56] [Music]
[04:42:58] it yeah exactly exactly it's just like

[04:43:18] better you know what I'm going to
[04:43:19] combine it with the other two and I'm G
[04:43:20] to build a box for both of them [ __ ]
[04:43:26] [Music]
[04:43:31] right yeah
[04:43:33] exactly mine was like mine mine if I was
[04:43:36] in the car it sounded freaking wonderful
[04:43:38] with anything that you put up but if you
[04:43:41] were outside of the car because it was a
[04:43:42] piece of [ __ ] car uh the car vibrated so
[04:43:46] much all you heard was metal clanging
[04:43:48] against each other unless I opened up
[04:43:49] all my doors in the
[04:43:58] trunk yeah my friends were like dude
[04:44:00] your car sounds like [ __ ] every time we
[04:44:02] hear you driving by I'm like it's just
[04:44:03] because I'm listening to radio yeah yeah
[04:44:05] but all we hear is of your freaking car
[04:44:08] vibrating like the inside sound sounds
[04:44:13] [Music]
[04:44:16] good yeah well they did get inside like
[04:44:18] Jesus one time I turned it on and I was
[04:44:20] like there's
[04:44:22] a long story short I was told I needed
[04:44:25] to slow down and they didn't TR they
[04:44:28] didn't believe my friend Josh then when
[04:44:30] they said I went like double the speed
[04:44:31] limit I'm very good at driving that I
[04:44:33] should be a race car driver and then I
[04:44:34] listen to music so loud that it'll blow
[04:44:36] off their
[04:44:38] panties
[04:44:39] um they they got in the car I put my
[04:44:43] music on not as loud as normal just
[04:44:45] louder louder than they were probably
[04:44:46] used to and I was going down it was like
[04:44:49] a 55 M hour Highway blowing down [ __ ]
[04:44:51] 90
[04:44:53] easy and uh yeah they're like you need
[04:44:57] to slow down and turn the radio down I
[04:44:59] thought Josh was joking when he told me
[04:45:01] this he's like this is how you always
[04:45:02] drive I'm like yeah i' I've been driving
[04:45:05] a vehicle since I was
[04:45:07] 12 I drive I race dirt bikes around
[04:45:10] freaking the quarry on trails that are
[04:45:12] size of one tire this is
[04:45:17] nothing like when you can weave in
[04:45:19] between trees going 30 40 miles an hour
[04:45:23] and you have to dodge and all you have
[04:45:24] is a [ __ ] Trail that's this big
[04:45:26] because your TIR is this big you learn
[04:45:29] how to do things
[04:45:30] easily yeah you learn skill to get
[04:45:33] around that
[04:45:35] [ __ ] put it put it this way I got an
[04:45:37] accident with I had a seizure when I was
[04:45:39] um I had seizure
[04:45:41] so I had a seizure when I my senior year
[04:45:43] high school um after I graduated um and
[04:45:47] there happened to be alcohol in the car
[04:45:48] I hadn't been drinking but having
[04:45:50] alcohol in the car they charged me with
[04:45:52] having alcohol in the car and other
[04:45:54] stuff well
[04:45:56] um oh nice
[04:45:59] yeah so like you know what I'm talking
[04:46:01] about yeah so like the when the police
[04:46:04] the next yeah I got in a bad car
[04:46:06] accident I hit a tree on I had a seizure
[04:46:08] and drifted off the road with three
[04:46:09] other people in the car hit a tree
[04:46:11] steering wheel right in my face my face
[04:46:13] I needed actually reconstruction surgery
[04:46:15] my lip was ripped off my tongue was bit
[04:46:17] in half you could see into my nose my
[04:46:20] nose was over this way um I was the only
[04:46:23] one hurt everybody else in the car was
[04:46:25] perfectly
[04:46:27] fine oh yeah so it was the first one I
[04:46:30] ever had no one knew I had them and so I
[04:46:32] hit a tree and when I afterwards when I
[04:46:35] had to go to court and talk to the
[04:46:37] police cuz the police officer like
[04:46:39] before I talked to the police officer I
[04:46:40] went to the because they found a fake ID
[04:46:42] on me they're like where did you get
[04:46:43] your fake ID and we're talking to I was
[04:46:45] talking to him in the in the state state
[04:46:47] um State you know State Police
[04:46:49] Department and I'm like I I told him
[04:46:51] exactly everything I didn't lie I don't
[04:46:54] know if we believe you I'm like I'm
[04:46:54] telling you the truth dude he's like you
[04:46:56] know what out of all the people we never
[04:46:58] even even attempted to pull you over I'm
[04:46:59] like what where did this come from he's
[04:47:00] like you went so fast that we couldn't
[04:47:03] even try to pull you over like what he's
[04:47:05] like you drove so fast we couldn't even
[04:47:08] catch you and it was just a matter of
[04:47:10] time until you had an accident I'm like
[04:47:13] I don't know and I said to him like you
[04:47:15] know the doctor said the only reason I
[04:47:16] had an accident is because I had a
[04:47:18] seizure right he's like no it wasn't it
[04:47:20] was because the alcohol in the car I'm
[04:47:21] like actually my blood alcohol was Zero
[04:47:24] because I didn't
[04:47:28] drink and the guy just kind of stood
[04:47:30] stared at me like you're a [ __ ]
[04:47:31] [ __ ] for even telling me that being
[04:47:33] that way it's almost like I was trying
[04:47:34] to rub it in his face that you wouldn't
[04:47:35] have caught me if I didn't have a
[04:47:38] seizure pretty much what I nicely was
[04:47:40] telling him if I had never had a seizure
[04:47:42] you would never have caught
[04:47:44] me because they they literally said they
[04:47:48] could not catch
[04:47:49] me yeah I had them he's like I had two
[04:47:53] police officers literally standing there
[04:47:55] talking to me and they both one of them
[04:47:56] looks at me he goes we can't even we
[04:47:58] don't even attempt to catch you one of
[04:47:59] us tried to and you just disappeared and
[04:48:01] we stopped trying like what like you was
[04:48:04] just a matter of time we thought you
[04:48:05] were going to die
[04:48:07] actually I'm like oh [ __ ]
[04:48:11] my mom staring at me like James what the
[04:48:13] [ __ ] like I don't

[04:48:24] license taken away until he was 25 by
[04:48:25] the way
[04:48:28] so that might have been the reason why I
[04:48:30] was good at
[04:48:32] this my dad was racing cars at 16 or 17
[04:48:38] cars that he built himself and he hit a
[04:48:41] he hit a PO cop car that was hidden
[04:48:43] under the side of a bridge that was like
[04:48:45] out of the bridge a little bit this far
[04:48:47] and he clipped the cop car and they took
[04:48:49] his license away until he was
[04:48:52] 25 yeah there you go my dad yeah well
[04:48:57] the [ __ ] cop was like he was over the

[04:49:23] later on when by from my uncle my dad's
[04:49:26] like stop telling him these like no
[04:49:27] wonder why you taught me how to race
[04:49:29] like
[04:49:31] that all right we got all kinds of stuff
[04:49:34] up there for you but it is getting to
[04:49:36] that end of the day I think we're going
[04:49:38] to throw our giby up here for our last
[04:49:41] one and is going to be a choice for you
[04:49:45] which one you want it to be is the
[04:49:46] Chalice or our Japanese right
[04:49:51] there yeah my dad built the first there
[04:49:54] was no six-speed transmission when he
[04:49:57] needed to have a race car and he built a
[04:49:59] car that was so powerful in the 60s that
[04:50:02] he needed that it on the four speeed it
[04:50:04] tore his engine out of um the uh Crown
[04:50:09] Victoria that he had so he ended up
[04:50:11] building a six-speed transmission by
[04:50:14] taking parts of a trailer truck and
[04:50:16] building it into the transmission for
[04:50:18] the car and built a six-speed
[04:50:20] transmission with him and his friends so
[04:50:22] that he could race his car and he
[04:50:24] [ __ ] tore the do he had a Crown
[04:50:26] Victoria that had the like the glass
[04:50:27] roof he said I tore the doors off a
[04:50:31] Corvette that thought they were gonna
[04:50:32] beat me the [ __ ] thing didn't have a
[04:50:34] chance off the line took him off the
[04:50:36] Corvette on the spot the guy after the
[04:50:39] race goes I'm buying that car cash from
[04:50:42] you now my dad's like no I built that
[04:50:44] and he's like at that time he's like you
[04:50:46] offered me like two grand I'm like no no
[04:50:48] got to five grand I started thinking
[04:50:49] about it then when he hit eight grand
[04:50:51] I'm like oh and then he said hit 10 I'm
[04:50:52] like yeah it's yours 10 grand in like 62
[04:50:56] was a boatload of money so he's like
[04:50:58] [ __ ] right as like a 17-year-old kid
[04:51:01] 10 grand in the
[04:51:09] 60s exactly
[04:51:11] so like he [ __ ] took that and ran and
[04:51:12] he's like I always pissed off I gave
[04:51:14] that car away there was like one of 900
[04:51:16] of those glass roof ones made and he got
[04:51:19] and he had one because he had gotten in
[04:51:21] an accident and the front end was ruined
[04:51:23] but he was able to fix it because he was
[04:51:24] a good like he was good at what he
[04:51:26] did and he fixed the car into whatever
[04:51:29] was and made it like just made made that
[04:51:33] yeah in the 60s that would be like
[04:51:34] [ __ ] 100 Grand almost

[00:02:17] all on here doing this that's exactly
[00:02:19] what it is I mean it's it's hard to say
[00:02:21] anything but nerd [ __ ] you
[00:02:28] know
[00:02:36] well yeah my i' like i' I've said many
[00:02:39] times before I have a plan for that and
[00:02:42] it's the same plan that I have for the
[00:02:44] end of my lifetime anyways that is go
[00:02:47] live on a
[00:02:49] boat and when I'm living on the boat the
[00:02:53] only thing I'm really going to need to
[00:02:54] do is find a deserted island throw a
[00:02:58] couple of pigs and chickens on on it and
[00:03:00] boom I'm
[00:03:03] good hey
[00:03:05] psycho how you doing which is actually
[00:03:08] my plan
[00:03:09] anyways for life if I can make it work
[00:03:14] which is to uh get a boat and have uh
[00:03:16] not find my deserted island but see if I
[00:03:19] can buy a piece of an island somewhere
[00:03:21] throw myself a couple pigs and chickens
[00:03:23] on it and travel around and then go back
[00:03:25] and get some food whenever I need
[00:03:28] it oh I forgot to put my show notes
[00:03:37] in the oh those that's actually a good
[00:03:39] plan that's good plan that's a pretty
[00:03:41] good plan living in the top of the
[00:03:43] Redwoods
[00:03:44] there that's not a bad idea make like a
[00:03:47] be like the wookies up there rolling
[00:03:49] around between all the tops tops of
[00:03:54] trees make your own little uh
[00:03:56] civilization up
[00:03:58] there and then you can throw like uh can
[00:04:00] throw like stuff over at them and laugh
[00:04:03] as it lands on them all oh just
[00:04:07] you screw everybody else you're not
[00:04:09] allowed up
[00:04:13] here oh that's funny just
[00:04:20] me I like that I like that just
[00:04:28] me
[00:04:32] all
[00:04:36] right get your own
[00:04:40] tree well no everybody's gonna have
[00:04:42] their own tree remember that's what the
[00:04:44] wookies they all had their own tree but
[00:04:45] they were all connected through the uh
[00:04:48] through the um uh like the bridge system
[00:04:51] they had there
[00:04:55] right Ewoks Ewoks that's why I'm so Ro
[00:04:59] wrong Ewoks my brain was so wrong Ewoks
[00:05:03] oh why did I kept saying
[00:05:05] Wookies the Ewoks I'm thinking of the
[00:05:08] Ewoks wow my brains just broke
[00:05:11] there yeah the little guys yeah like
[00:05:16] them yeah go live in the trees you have
[00:05:19] your own you have your own tree everyone
[00:05:22] gets their own tree then you connect
[00:05:24] them all through
[00:05:26] uh through little walkways there to each
[00:05:29] other
[00:05:30] hey CJ how you doing today I'm G to
[00:05:32] throw this up I finally
[00:05:34] got yes the wookies did live in the
[00:05:37] forest and that's why I was getting
[00:05:38] screwed up with that because if I
[00:05:40] remember right they all had their own
[00:05:42] tree in the forest they just didn't live
[00:05:45] in the trees on top of them like the
[00:05:47] Ewoks did oh my brain I haven't seen
[00:05:50] that those movies in so long I have to
[00:05:51] go back and watch them again with the
[00:05:53] kids it's probably been

[00:06:01] while I'm G have to go back and watch

[00:07:02] were like are you talking about the
[00:07:04] first two of the newer
[00:07:06] ones because if you're talking about the
[00:07:08] first two of the newer ones that's where
[00:07:09] I might be a little confused but here
[00:07:11] this is what we're g to do we're going
[00:07:12] to throw these
[00:07:13] on
[00:07:15] [Music]
[00:07:19] for that's not what I
[00:07:22] wanted that's not what I wanted why are
[00:07:24] you doing
[00:07:26] that there we go let's get that to work
[00:07:29] now we're going to throw the three packs
[00:07:31] on
[00:07:34] screen why is it
[00:07:36] not sorry guys getting a little issue
[00:07:38] with whatnot every time I move over
[00:07:41] there we
[00:07:42] go one collector of Exon and two drafts
[00:07:47] for
[00:07:48] 31 yeah the OG ones yeah yeah OG ones
[00:07:51] those are the good one those are good
[00:07:53] ones to be seeing though see the new
[00:07:54] ones were good they weren't great you
[00:07:57] know the ogs were yeah they were
[00:08:00] definitely they were the ones if you if
[00:08:02] you saw those and those are the only two
[00:08:04] you saw don't worry too much about the
[00:08:07] others yes they're nice and they're good
[00:08:10] and if you're a Star Wars fan definitely
[00:08:12] worth wa worth watching and but if
[00:08:16] you're like a h a Star Wars fan you're
[00:08:17] like I saw some of them those are the
[00:08:19] those are the ones that you want to be
[00:08:22] seeing yeah the politics stuff and that
[00:08:24] was kind of fun it wasn't too over the
[00:08:26] toop there was a little bit of it
[00:08:28] sprinkled in and then you had the war of
[00:08:30] fighting with it it was nice they there
[00:08:32] was like a whole story to it where some
[00:08:34] of the newer ones it's not as much as
[00:08:36] the story as it was more here's a
[00:08:42] war oh yeah some of the fights yeah back
[00:08:44] then some of the fights weren't actually
[00:08:46] as good I'd say I'll agree with you
[00:08:47] there because sometimes you had um
[00:08:50] because you know when you have like the
[00:08:51] CG uh whatever CGI back then it wasn't
[00:08:55] the best so you know you have you got to
[00:08:57] deal with what you you got there
[00:09:00] so we'll throw on let's do this let's do
[00:09:03] a
[00:09:04] combo let's do a combo right
[00:09:13] now let's do a combo I'm gonna do this
[00:09:17] we're gonna
[00:09:18] do six lord of the ring and six lost
[00:09:21] Caverns
[00:09:22] Exelon we'll call that 12 I'm going to
[00:09:24] throw that on just for a minute and a
[00:09:26] half while I figure out a new pack deal
[00:09:27] for you all while we talk here
[00:09:32] yes exactly it was and the government
[00:09:34] kept it's not it's not abnormal by the
[00:09:37] way for what a government does so this
[00:09:39] is what's going on right now six ex
[00:09:41] Source Lord of the Rings six Exelon
[00:09:43] poles normally that would be 14 we're
[00:09:44] doing that for 12 if you want to try
[00:09:46] your luck going for the One Ring maybe
[00:09:48] the
[00:09:50] galta or you know
[00:09:52] what maybe you want to try your
[00:09:56] luck doing it now
[00:10:02] after I'll throw up a pack deal here
[00:10:06] yeah of this maybe you want to try your
[00:10:09] luck hunting a
[00:10:14] ring in the
[00:10:16] Wilds running from
[00:10:19] dinos maybe that's what you want to do
[00:10:21] with packs
[00:10:24] after yeah I uh see one of the things
[00:10:28] with
[00:10:31] with the newer movies they put a lot of
[00:10:33] emphasis
[00:10:36] on
[00:10:41] like the story's emphasis wasn't clear
[00:10:46] if that makes any sense in some of them
[00:10:48] you didn't know where they were going
[00:10:50] for a little while and that was
[00:10:51] frustrating where the other one yeah may
[00:10:53] it may not have been clear in the
[00:10:54] originals but you knew they were going
[00:10:57] somewhere if that makes any sense at all
[00:11:00] I don't know how to explain
[00:11:03] that that's as best as I can say it I
[00:11:07] don't
[00:11:10] know well I forgot to put uh I forgot to
[00:11:13] do my math
[00:11:18] here we'll call this three packs on
[00:11:21] [Music]
[00:11:25] screen we'll call that on screen 17
[00:11:43] yeah yeah it's just it was hard it's
[00:11:45] like hard to
[00:11:46] explain it the best way I could explain
[00:11:49] it
[00:11:50] was the first ones felt
[00:11:53] coherent in the LA later ones felt a
[00:11:56] little scattered actually actually to
[00:11:58] simple ify it they ended up getting to a
[00:12:01] point where you're like
[00:12:04] oh but the other ones the first ones you
[00:12:07] like you knew they were going somewhere
[00:12:09] and you wanted to be there where the
[00:12:11] other the new I mean the old ones were
[00:12:12] like you knew they were going somewhere
[00:12:15] and you wanted to go there with
[00:12:17] them where the new ones were more of a
[00:12:21] what's going on why where are we doing
[00:12:23] what are we doing this
[00:12:25] for I don't that was that was my
[00:12:29] they were entertaining and I had a good
[00:12:32] time with them but I like how the
[00:12:34] stories in older movies and books and
[00:12:37] things like that were directed I guess
[00:12:41] they weren't scattered like all over the
[00:12:43] place picking somebody's story here and
[00:12:45] picking somebody's story there and
[00:12:46] picking somebody's story there and
[00:12:47] throwing it together and thinking it's G
[00:12:49] all GNA mean something in the end like
[00:12:51] great but they should all like function
[00:12:53] together as a story not just be like
[00:12:55] five separate stories
[00:12:57] together
[00:13:02] yes yes yes that type of a
[00:13:07] thing they were good though I had a good
[00:13:09] time with them it was just that's how it
[00:13:11] was just one of those weird
[00:13:14] feelings let me do this one here for a
[00:13:16] pack
[00:13:18] deal we'll do um let me find a pack deal
[00:13:21] well I will throw some you know what
[00:13:23] let's do some I
[00:13:27] on
[00:13:30] do some X on here while I figure out a
[00:13:32] pack
[00:13:41] deal let's do this random one let's do
[00:13:44] this random one
[00:13:46] here is there a random one
[00:13:50] here that's a random one but let's try
[00:13:54] it
[00:13:54] out hey Jay Davis hey crits thanks for
[00:13:58] coming in out just uh hopefully cracking
[00:14:01] some packs just doing some pull boox
[00:14:03] deals while I get pack deals figured out
[00:14:05] for everyone that comes it hangs out
[00:14:07] that's kind of what I do here generally
[00:14:09] we talk we hang out I put up deals if
[00:14:11] there's something you want to buy now
[00:14:13] you say yo give me three or more of
[00:14:14] these and I'll do a deal because I can
[00:14:16] do that when we do three or more just
[00:14:19] because of the whatnot fees it allows me
[00:14:21] to give a a couple bucks off a buck or
[00:14:23] two sometimes depending on what it is
[00:14:25] sometimes a little bit more depending on
[00:14:27] what it is based on the fees and that's
[00:14:28] why I'm able to do that that's why I try
[00:14:30] to say like if you can buy them helps me
[00:14:33] help you kind of
[00:14:37] thing he never was accepted as a member
[00:14:40] and he made a member yes and that's some
[00:14:42] yeah it is hey good morning Jay thank
[00:14:44] you thank
[00:14:47] you we are
[00:14:57] at
[00:14:59] and we'll call
[00:15:06] that 21 for those three actually that's
[00:15:10] pretty good deal 21 for those
[00:15:14] three 21 for those three packs on screen
[00:15:18] if you want to try your
[00:15:23] luck you know I've told my wife that
[00:15:25] before mik you know depending on the
[00:15:27] scenario i' have a hard time not being
[00:15:30] um jumping on their side at least for a
[00:15:32] little bit you know there was there was
[00:15:36] a point at you're at you're like you
[00:15:37] know what they they have a they they're
[00:15:39] kind of right then after a while like oh
[00:15:42] yeah no no that's not right but like in
[00:15:45] the beginning you're like oh that makes
[00:15:47] sense what they're doing that for but
[00:15:49] then like how they were doing it like oh
[00:15:51] yeah no no no no I don't like
[00:15:54] that that you know that type of scenario
[00:15:58] at least for me I I kind of understood
[00:16:00] to try making order and having peace and
[00:16:03] that thing but the way they went about
[00:16:05] it wasn't acceptable you
[00:16:07] know all right we didn't like that
[00:16:09] random pack deal and as always we do
[00:16:11] pack deals here plus um try to do deals
[00:16:15] on our other games if we do like I said
[00:16:17] if I do multiple the reason why I can do
[00:16:19] little deals when you do multiples is
[00:16:21] because a whatnot fees it helps me help
[00:16:24] you so we're going to do it on this
[00:16:27] actually and I'm going to run it for a
[00:16:28] couple minutes that way I can show you
[00:16:31] what we have in there that way if you
[00:16:34] want to take your luck on

[01:32:13] before I uh start work and I have I
[01:32:16] pretty much I have fun doing it and
[01:32:17] that's why I uh that's why that's
[01:32:19] literally why I keep doing it because
[01:32:21] it's just a fun
[01:32:23] time the back box first all right I'll
[01:32:27] do that the back box
[01:32:37] first back box

[01:33:11] store kind of so I am a store in a way
[01:33:15] but I'm not exactly a store to be I
[01:33:18] don't have the same overhead as like a
[01:33:21] as I need it for like they might
[01:33:25] need but I also have an Excel file I
[01:33:28] calculate everything in so you said you
[01:33:30] wanted the back one first all right back
[01:33:33] one first so I do like an Excel file and
[01:33:36] I calculate everything so that's why I
[01:33:38] can do that stuff a little bit quicker
[01:33:39] be like oh I'll do a deal on this stuff
[01:33:41] you
[01:33:44] know you are a guy you're just a guy

I need you to search the internet to figure out the best way to build a Magic the Gathering modern deck. I need to make one very shortly.

[2024-08-04 11:02:02] ChatGPT:
Building a Magic: The Gathering (MTG) Modern deck involves several key steps to ensure you have a competitive and enjoyable deck. Here's a guide to get you started:

### 1. Understand the Modern Format
Modern is a non-rotating format that allows cards from Eighth Edition forward, excluding those on the banned list. This large card pool offers numerous strategies and archetypes, but also means you need to be aware of powerful cards and combos across many sets.

### 2. Choose a Deck Archetype
Modern decks generally fall into three broad categories: Aggro, Control, and Midrange. 

- **Aggro Decks**: These focus on dealing damage quickly with low-cost creatures and direct damage spells. Examples include Burn decks, which use efficient damage spells, and Hammer Time, which equips massive weapons onto small creatures to deal lethal damage quickly.
- **Control Decks**: These aim to prolong the game by countering spells, removing threats, and using board wipes until they can win with powerful, high-cost cards. Jeskai Control is a popular example.
- **Midrange Decks**: These strike a balance between Aggro and Control, using efficient creatures and spells to maintain board presence and adaptability. Jund and Abzan are common Midrange decks.

### 3. Pick Your Colors
Your deck’s colors should align with its strategy:
- **White**: Protection, small creatures, life gain.
- **Blue**: Card draw, counterspells, evasion.
- **Red**: Direct damage, fast creatures.
- **Black**: Removal, reanimation, sacrifice.
- **Green**: Mana ramp, big creatures.

For simplicity and consistency, start with one or two colors. Adding more colors can increase the deck's power but also its complexity and cost.

### 4. Build Your Mana Base
A well-constructed mana base is crucial. Include a mix of basic lands and multicolored lands that align with your chosen colors. The goal is to ensure you can cast your spells when needed without getting color-screwed. A typical Modern deck runs 20-24 lands.

### 5. Construct Your Mana Curve
Your mana curve should allow you to play spells efficiently at every stage of the game. Aggro decks typically peak at two mana, while Control decks peak around four mana. Ensure you have a good distribution of spells across your mana curve to maximize your turns.

### 6. Include Key Cards
Identify key cards that define your deck's strategy:
- **For Aggro**: Low-cost creatures and direct damage spells.
- **For Control**: Counterspells, removal, and card draw.
- **For Midrange**: Efficient creatures and versatile spells.

Include four copies of essential cards to ensure you draw them consistently.

### 7. Test and Refine
Playtest your deck against various archetypes to identify strengths and weaknesses. Adjust your decklist based on performance, and consider the current metagame—what decks are popular and how your deck can compete against them.

### 8. Sideboard Strategy
Your sideboard should include cards to address specific matchups and strategies that your main deck struggles against. Common sideboard options include additional removal, counterspells, and graveyard hate.

### Popular Decks in 2024
- **Temur Rhinos**: A combo deck that bypasses mana restrictions to deploy large threats quickly.
- **Tron**: Uses Urza’s lands to cast powerful colorless spells early.
- **Burn**: An aggro deck focused on fast, efficient damage.

For more detailed examples and decklists, resources like [MTGGoldfish](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/metagame/modern#paper) and [Cards Realm](https://mtg.cardsrealm.com/en/articles/modern:-5-decks-to-play-the-format-in-2024) provide current metagame insights and deck techs.

### Summary
1. Understand the Modern format and banned list.
2. Choose a deck archetype (Aggro, Control, Midrange).
3. Select your deck colors.
4. Build a balanced mana base and mana curve.
5. Include key cards and test your deck.
6. Develop a sideboard strategy.
7. Refer to popular decks and resources for guidance.

By following these steps, you'll be well on your way to building a competitive Modern deck for Magic: The Gathering.

What is in burn

[2024-08-04 11:05:45] ChatGPT:
A Burn deck in Magic: The Gathering is an aggressive archetype that aims to reduce the opponent's life total to zero as quickly as possible using a combination of low-cost, high-efficiency damage spells and creatures. Here are some typical components of a Burn deck:

### Key Components of a Burn Deck

1. **Low-Cost Creatures**:
   - **Goblin Guide**: A 1-mana creature with haste that deals 2 damage when it attacks.
   - **Monastery Swiftspear**: A 1-mana creature with haste and prowess, which gets stronger with each noncreature spell you cast.
   - **Eidolon of the Great Revel**: A 2-mana creature that deals damage to both players whenever a spell with a mana cost of 3 or less is cast.

2. **Efficient Damage Spells**:
   - **Lightning Bolt**: A 1-mana instant that deals 3 damage to any target.
   - **Rift Bolt**: Can be cast for 3 mana or suspended for 1 mana to deal 3 damage to any target.
   - **Lava Spike**: A 1-mana sorcery that deals 3 damage to an opponent.
   - **Skewer the Critics**: Can be cast for 1 mana if an opponent was dealt damage this turn, dealing 3 damage to any target.

3. **Direct Damage Spells**:
   - **Boros Charm**: A 2-mana instant that can deal 4 damage to an opponent or make your creatures indestructible for a turn.
   - **Searing Blaze**: Deals 1 or 3 damage to both a player and a creature they control if you played a land this turn.
   - **Lightning Helix**: A 2-mana instant that deals 3 damage to any target and gains you 3 life.

4. **Mana Base**:
   - **Mountains**: Basic lands providing red mana.
   - **Fetch Lands**: Such as **Arid Mesa** and **Wooded Foothills**, which help thin the deck and fix mana.
   - **Shock Lands**: Like **Sacred Foundry** and **Stomping Ground**, which provide both red and another color at the cost of some life.

5. **Sideboard Options**:
   - **Roiling Vortex**: To deal with decks that gain life or cast free spells.
   - **Skullcrack**: To prevent life gain and deal 3 damage.
   - **Path to Exile**: For creature removal.
   - **Destructive Revelry**: To handle artifacts and enchantments.

Look at each one of the cards that you've provided me in the deck. Find each one of those sets that those cards could be in, because I need to be able to find them in multiple sets. That way I can have as many of those cards as you've provided me and tell me I need. Also, any of the ones that are, like, more expensive ones, give me those and maybe options of alternatives for them or different ways of doing it. I always provide the rarity of the card and the set that it is in, the most recent set that it is in, that is, as in all the way up to this date now, the most recent one.

[00:44:14] booster I just want to make sure you do
[00:44:16] you do know that you have one
[00:44:19] left you're watching to figure out
[00:44:20] what's going on that's fine we are all
[00:44:22] we do is we play a little bit of a game
[00:44:24] when we um if you guys want to you buy
[00:44:27] packs butri bought something earlier and
[00:44:29] he jumped in he got a pack so uh you get
[00:44:32] to play a game with us kind of um you
[00:44:35] get to jump in and purchase and take the
[00:44:36] character over if you want where that's
[00:44:38] why I keep saying take the character
[00:44:40] over you know that type of thing it's
[00:44:42] kind of like you throw a dollar in the
[00:44:43] machine type thing and play a game so
[00:44:45] you go you got your agility booster
[00:44:46] you're gonna use I like it use that you
[00:44:49] have this agile Scout the gator dowo is
[00:44:53] there now you shoot at the gator dowo
[00:44:54] with your bow
[00:44:57] and that Gator
[00:44:59] Dow
[00:45:03] takes ooh that's a nice hit takes eight
[00:45:06] damage looks like it hits him in the
[00:45:08] neck but he comes running towards you
[00:45:10] and he slashes you with his
[00:45:12] tail and you get seven damage and you're
[00:45:14] knocked down to the
[00:45:16] ground what are you going to do now
[00:45:27] that's what's up there right now if you
[00:45:28] want to take the character over you get
[00:45:30] to buy these two packs you always keep
[00:45:32] your packs and then you take your
[00:45:33] character over as we go through the
[00:45:34] waist land we're going to attack again
[00:45:36] when the adile Scout shoots his bow
[00:45:38] luckily he was only he was able to get
[00:45:40] up quickly to shoot his bow at that
[00:45:42] Gator
[00:45:44] dowo and oh all right not bad Gator dowo
[00:45:49] takes a shot to the chest but luckily
[00:45:51] it's not a bit it's not a good one it's
[00:45:53] just a small shot it takes five Health
[00:45:55] away he's only at 35 health because he
[00:45:57] doesn't have he has a big Health one he
[00:45:59] hits he does not hit you with his tail
[00:46:01] that time though because it must have
[00:46:03] been annoying enough so what are you
[00:46:05] gonna do as this agile Scout now
[00:46:08] butrick think this is one attack left
[00:46:10] before you start or before something
[00:46:12] happens and the the creature disappears
[00:46:14] or you get injured and die you're GNA
[00:46:16] run again well I like it it's not a bad
[00:46:19] idea you run that Gator Dillo you run
[00:46:21] from it and in the distance you see
[00:46:24] something oh no could it be something
[00:46:27] good could it be something bad I think
[00:46:30] oh you know what we're going to put out
[00:46:33] the basic loot
[00:46:35] box maybe somebody wants to try their
[00:46:37] luck and take over the character they

[00:46:41] ground your guy goes up to and goes oh

[01:25:56] strength strength and fight you're going
[01:25:59] to use the
[01:26:00] strength all right strength
[01:26:02] it and you use your
[01:26:05] strength in that agile Scout you pulls
[01:26:08] that bow back so far with his giant
[01:26:11] Mighty strength you let go on your bow
[01:26:15] and let's see what
[01:26:18] happens we have a hit oh another Direct
[01:26:22] Hit to the chest but this goes almost
[01:26:24] all the way through because you use your
[01:26:25] strength you're down to 22 Health with

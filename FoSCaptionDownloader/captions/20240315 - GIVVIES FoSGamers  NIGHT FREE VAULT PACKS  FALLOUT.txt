[00:29:25] frustrating H now I understand
[00:29:28] so I can't go on during certain times
[00:29:30] now for I think the next month you might
[00:29:33] not see me on during uh any time other
[00:29:35] than maybe I don't know maybe the
[00:29:36] morning
[00:29:38] times because it looks like uh somebody
[00:29:41] said I was getting muted which stinks am
[00:29:44] right digit break right guys a nice
[00:29:47] digit break it's a good one it's a good
[00:29:51] one look at
[00:29:52] that look at that
[00:29:54] thing no wait no it's
[00:29:57] uh
[00:30:01] there we go pin
[00:30:06] that you can pin that there there you go
[00:30:09] nice digit
[00:30:17] break boosters Fallout four Commander
[00:30:20] Masters six em boosters and 10 mystery
[00:30:23] boosters is our uh monster Digi break
[00:30:27] pretty cool there

[00:39:32] in time and then this one I've yet to be
[00:39:34] able to figure out where this is from
[00:39:37] all I know is it comes from Canada and
[00:39:40] generally when things are from Canada
[00:39:42] they're in interesting and I'm worried

[02:53:49] 361 if you can't see it there I don't

[02:54:06] actually willing to part with this one
[02:54:07] ring if anybody wants

[02:54:44] one ring uh foil too like I I just don't
[02:54:49] understand I don't understand it I don't
[02:54:52] know what to do but that's okay that
[02:54:54] means he is the one with the luck that
[02:54:57] means he gets to pull out some fun stuff
[02:54:58] and have fun with us and I get to I get
[02:55:00] to see it happen you
[02:55:06] know I know myel I've had you know I'm

[02:55:23] forgot to clip it it was before I had an
[02:55:25] iPhone an Apple product to be able to
[02:55:26] clip but um the person was like get me a
[02:55:31] ragavan and he literally goes all right
[02:55:32] sure and he pulls out from Brothers War
[02:55:35] collector booster one of the ragavan U
[02:55:37] one of those foil ones the the the
[02:55:39] scroll foil the poster foil not the
[02:55:41] poster foils the
[02:55:43] um uh it was like the $90 card like the
[02:55:46] ragavan like the $90 one and he's like
[02:55:49] holy crap I didn't think that was going
[02:55:50] to happen and then Will's like here you
[02:55:52] go just gives it to him like there
[02:55:54] you're welcome like you got to be
[02:55:56] kidding me
[02:56:04] kid but anyways I'll put that
[02:56:07] back no one want of that we'll put out
[02:56:10] uh let's put something else out myelle
[02:56:12] is going to go with the big blue book
[02:56:14] all right myel now I do want to uh say
[02:56:18] something about the Big Blue Book right
[02:56:19] here uh we
[02:56:23] have the options here for you with the
[02:56:26] blank spots because we do with the blank
[02:56:29] spots give you options of
[02:56:32] taxs because I am out of some things
[02:56:36] your
[02:56:37] options are what I have to uh I have to
[02:56:40] give you a few different options than
[02:56:41] normal normally it would be like one
[02:56:43] pack or something like that well now
[02:56:47] it's a little different
[02:56:48] you get a couple options here let me see
[02:56:50] where they are the other ones I think
[02:56:53] that's it that's it now cuz I'm running
[02:56:55] out I supposed to have them here today
[02:56:57] but I did not have them so what we do is
[02:57:00] if you have a blank spot you get your
[02:57:03] choice of any one of these plus any one
[02:57:06] of
[02:57:08] these all right you get um I mean any
[02:57:12] one of these any one of these too plus
[02:57:15] this if you get or you can do any
[02:57:19] you can do two of these plus one of
[02:57:21] these or any two of
[02:57:24] these or three of these if you really
[02:57:26] wanted if you get a blank spot and then
[02:57:29] uh we adjust that per like five and
[02:57:31] stuff like that because that's what I
[02:57:33] just sadly that's all I have available
[02:57:35] if you want me to cancel I will cancel I
[02:57:38] understand that I I completely forgot to
[02:57:40] take out the blue book I actually think
[02:57:41] didn't remember I had it in there so
[02:57:44] myel let me explain this with the blank
[02:57:48] spot normally with a blank spot you
[02:57:50] would get a pack Choice all right if you
[02:57:52] had a blank spot because uh or you
[02:57:55] either get your number here or if you
[02:57:57] get a blank spot you get a choice of
[02:57:59] packs is what it boils down to all right
[02:58:02] all right we
[02:58:03] good that's what it boils down to you
[02:58:05] get a choice of packs so I'm going to
[02:58:08] put up the wheel here I just knocked
[02:58:10] over all the bosses let me pick all
[02:58:13] those bosses up
[02:58:16] there all right we're going to get get
[02:58:18] the wheels spinning spinning up
[02:58:22] here all 1 through
[02:58:29] 81 get our 1 through 81 up
[02:58:33] there how many times would you like me
[02:58:37] to randomize the
[02:58:39] wheel like uh like a shuffle
[02:58:42] it I can do it anywhere from zero to
[02:58:45] okay one million times one
[02:58:48] two there we
[02:58:52] go spin
[02:58:54] it let's see what it lands
[02:58:58] on number 26 all right with number
[02:59:06] 26 we
[02:59:10] have you got a scrap craw tler so being
[02:59:14] the low being the low this is what you
[02:59:16] get for your choice
[02:59:22] you
[02:59:24] get your choice of some packs here I'm
[02:59:27] going to go over it one more time
[02:59:28] because I know I said it was a little
[02:59:30] confusing you
[02:59:35] get two of
[02:59:38] these and one of
[02:59:44] these three of
[02:59:47] these
[02:59:50] any two of
[02:59:53] these or any one of these and
[02:59:58] this hopefully that was clear and that's
[03:00:02] just because I do not have the normal
[03:00:04] collector boosters that I would have to
[03:00:06] give you the option of they're coming in

[03:21:45] thank you all for hanging out
[03:21:47] anybody want to tell me what to do here
[03:21:48] no all right so it looks like I'm
[03:21:50] probably going to run a spinner we're
[03:21:52] going to drop this and I'm probably
[03:21:53] going to end up having no one bid on it
[03:21:55] except to go for a dollar so I'm betting
[03:21:58] this is going to go for a dollar right
[03:21:59] here because I'm guessing no one's going
[03:22:00] to I'm going to be putting that up there
[03:22:02] and this is what is the uh the pack this
[03:22:05] is what it
[03:22:06] is we're going to hide that randomizer
[03:22:08] and it always comes out as being one of
[03:22:10] those ones and now that that was run
[03:22:12] that was a loot that was
[03:22:14] dropped and here we go the loot
[03:22:17] pack the loot pack going up here now the
[03:22:20] loot pack does not do sudden death I

[03:22:51] some point and remember you do have this
[03:22:53] here you're going to get those for free
[03:22:56] it looks like I'm guessing panuma is

[03:23:00] the look of it here and we will see what
[03:23:03] happens here we got $1 come on I know

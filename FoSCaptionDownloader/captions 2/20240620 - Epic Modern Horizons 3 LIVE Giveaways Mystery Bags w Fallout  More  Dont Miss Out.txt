[00:00:38] opening everything looking at you guys
[00:00:41] if I want to look over here and look at
[00:00:42] chat I do have to look that way though
[00:00:45] so haven't figured out yeah I I think
[00:00:46] it's pretty good I know I like it so far
[00:00:49] I think I like it because it can like
[00:00:51] turn like this and look at chat and talk
[00:00:52] to you
[00:00:55] guys so let's throw out some uh and then
[00:00:58] you get to see everything over here too
[00:01:01] made a little adjustment so you see
[00:01:03] everything I know what do you think hope
[00:01:05] you can hear me
[00:01:12] all no this is not the boat
[00:01:15] setup no this is not the boat setup this
[00:01:18] is the uh this is we're cleaning house
[00:01:21] and since I don't have the desk being
[00:01:23] used for my other job anymore since uh
[00:01:25] being having resigned I reorganized I'm
[00:01:28] using that mainly for this now since
[00:01:30] pretty much that's what I'm mainly using
[00:01:31] it for at the moment and in that process
[00:01:35] uh did some
[00:01:38] rearranging thought it would be nice

[00:04:23] yeah well that's my server one over
[00:04:24] there I don't have that one on
[00:04:27] that change the setup long story story
[00:04:29] short um I have the the other desk was a
[00:04:32] temporary one that's like an a foldout
[00:04:33] desk that I had bought to use for just

[00:04:51] about this I just have to adjust my
[00:04:52] camera and move the camera somewhere
[00:04:58] [Laughter]
[00:05:01] because I can all right let's throw out

[01:21:59] card yeah sometimes it is but uh I'm G
[01:22:02] I'm gonna tell you something about that
[01:22:03] I'm give you a minute here Amazon
[01:22:05] Warriors Swan maidens armorist
[01:22:09] mercenaries K troll
[01:22:12] scarecrow rain of
[01:22:14] arrows Highland Clansman exorcism
[01:22:19] sandworm
[01:22:20] mortality and red desert an ordinary
[01:22:24] side
[01:22:25] of blight not bad on that
[01:22:28] so what I what I like to say here is I
[01:22:31] got to take a drink damn it drink drink
[01:22:39] drink ah
[01:22:40] yep I can see that being
[01:22:45] chaos so what we do is uh what with that
[01:22:48] is going to make a comment so ADHD I
[01:22:51] learned a while ago people have ADHD as
[01:22:54] those the ones that were um either like
[01:22:57] tribal leaders a lot of the times or
[01:23:00] they were
[01:23:01] um uh things that were like tribal like
[01:23:05] leaders or they were like uh Hunters the
[01:23:07] reason for that is is because their
[01:23:09] minds work so quickly to snap between
[01:23:12] things that they're able to figure stuff
[01:23:14] out that no no other everybody is
[01:23:16] quickly like they're able to see like a
[01:23:19] lion chasing them or a Sav tooth tiger
[01:23:22] or whatever the hell it is you know
[01:23:23] where everybody else wasn't noticing
[01:23:24] that no they no that being stocked and
[01:23:26] and being stocked so that's one of the
[01:23:28] things about ADHD like people say yes
[01:23:30] it's handicap with certain things but
[01:23:32] it's because the whole point of it is
[01:23:34] you're doing the wrong job if that makes
[01:23:35] sense your job should have you you
[01:23:37] should be doing a job where you're doing
[01:23:39] something where you're more of an active
[01:23:41] person in some way um there are
[01:23:43] different people that are the gatherers
[01:23:45] those gatherers those are those people
[01:23:46] that should be sitting down at the desk
[01:23:48] perfect jobs for those people but the
[01:23:50] people that are the ADHD people those
[01:23:52] are the hunters those are the people
[01:23:53] that need to be outo doing things on a
[01:23:55] regular
[01:23:58] basis yeah yep so what I've noticed is
[01:24:02] and another thing I'm gonna put this out
[01:24:04] here a lot of people that have ADHD
[01:24:08] start their own
[01:24:09] businesses a lot of people at ADHD are
[01:24:12] entrepreneur entrepreneurs so that's
[01:24:14] another nice thing thing to think about
[01:24:20] too see that's my thing the fetting is a
[01:24:22] problem for and I get quick to
[01:24:24] frustration with that but I at least
[01:24:26] know I forgot something so I just get
[01:24:28] frustrated and I have to calm down and
[01:24:30] I'm like all right take a minute and I
[01:24:31] retrace my steps you can learn some
[01:24:33] tricks over time to help but uh it does
[01:24:35] take time to learn those tricks you
[01:24:37] know I've been dealing with it I didn't
[01:24:39] realize I had an actual problem until I
[01:24:41] was probably like I I was in my 30s when
[01:24:44] like one of the doctors I was talking to
[01:24:46] he's like you know that's ADHD right
[01:24:47] like no it isn't he's like yes it is he
[01:24:49] read down like a list of everything it
[01:24:51] was there and he's like you have that
[01:24:52] every single symptom I'm like oh I
[01:24:55] didn't realize that creative too exactly
[01:24:58] very creative ADHD people are generally
[01:25:01] very creative
[01:25:07] also yes that can happen for some people
[01:25:10] you have to be careful on that for for
[01:25:13] Rocky if uh is the impulse stuff the
[01:25:16] impulses is hard to
[01:25:18] do yes I was like 38 I was like what
[01:25:22] mean what do you mean I have the ADHD
[01:25:23] I'm like no I'm good like you have that
[01:25:25] like H all right maybe that makes
[01:25:30] sense yeah pretty much it was like we
[01:25:32] all knew exactly everybody around me was
[01:25:34] like dude you got ADHD I'm like no I
[01:25:35] don't like you're all over the place
[01:25:37] you're like a freaking squirrel
[01:25:38] sometimes or a dog oh cat dog oh
[01:25:41] squirrel you know my wife says I'm a I'm

[01:27:43] different locations that type of
[01:27:49] thing
[01:27:51] ah not too far from there Memphis is not
[01:27:55] too far away no it
[01:28:01] isn't yeah it's something I've wanted to
[01:28:03] do for years I wanted to do it since I
[01:28:05] was younger um when I was in high school
[01:28:06] I saw the movie uh know was probably not
[01:28:09] the best movie to say you saw but I saw
[01:28:11] the movie white squall and I was like oh
[01:28:13] I want to travel around the world on a
[01:28:14] boat on a sailboat and do that and since
[01:28:16] that movie I've always tried to and I
[01:28:17] told my wife I wanted to then finally
[01:28:19] after some of my stuff happening with my
[01:28:21] job um some things going on with the
[01:28:24] kids and things like that we like you
[01:28:25] know what screw it let's put our family
[01:28:29] first oh there's a lot of people in the
[01:28:31] w w West actually Oblivion I think we
[01:28:34] have a few there's a few in
[01:28:38] here do the three
[01:28:41] for25 let's do
[01:28:44] it oh Frank you're back do you want to
[01:28:47] do the do you want to do the U mystery
[01:28:49] bags because you weren't here before so
[01:28:51] I didn't run the mystery bags for you
[01:28:55] all right here we go I'll run the
[01:28:56] mystery bags now like I said I have to
[01:28:57] do them separately so I have to do them
[01:28:59] $20 a piece if you're going to BU since
[01:29:02] you're gonna try to go go with the two
[01:29:03] of them all right so there you go it's
[01:29:06] just I have to do them separate just
[01:29:07] because of what Knot's rules I I can't
[01:29:09] get in trouble get suspended again for a
[01:29:11] week because there's a combo and
[01:29:14] somebody who doesn't like there's a
[01:29:15] combo that is doesn't sell the price on
[01:29:17] it which so just ridiculous I bundled
[01:29:20] stuff and I got in trouble for bundling
[01:29:21] things for people it's really what it
[01:29:23] boiled down to
[01:29:26] all right Frank I'm gonna run the other
[01:29:28] one right
[01:29:31] here there we
[01:29:34] go yeah so I bundled um two pull boxes
[01:29:38] together somebody wanted a pole box and
[01:29:39] a mystery bag so I bundled them together
[01:29:42] and when I bundled them together I
[01:29:44] didn't have as you can see right now on
[01:29:45] the screen where it says like the
[01:29:46] ceiling the floor and the average and
[01:29:47] that stuff in there it didn't have that
[01:29:50] so I got suspended for a week they said
[01:29:52] that I didn't put it in there I'm like
[01:29:53] are you kidding me it's in the buy now
[01:29:54] on everything they wanted a bundle this
[01:29:55] is crap they ended up changing their
[01:29:57] rules though because they ended up
[01:29:59] actually realiz I'm pretty sure they
[01:30:00] realize they messed up but
[01:30:03] anyways oh I moved that

[2025-04-03 09:09:34] FoSGamers:
When mounting solar panels on the tower in a box i bought should they be level with the top of the boat or should it be higher than it. I have a 2017 Leopard 40, 3 cabin version.

[2025-04-03 09:09:34] ChatGPT:
Thanks for the details! Since you’re upgrading from the factory-installed 2x70W Sunware panels to a 500W Victron Energy system on your 2017 Leopard 40, 3-cabin version, and mounting them on a tower in a box setup, here's what you need to know about positioning:

### Ideal Mounting Height:
- **Slightly Higher Than the Bimini or Roofline** is usually best. This allows:
  - **Unobstructed sun exposure**, especially in early morning and late afternoon.
  - **Air circulation** underneath, helping with panel cooling and efficiency.
  - **Shade avoidance** from rigging, boom, or radar domes.

### But don’t go *too* high:
- **Wind profile and aesthetics** start to suffer if the panels stick up significantly.
- Keep the **center of gravity in mind** for stability.
- You still want **easy access** for cleaning or maintenance.

### Pro Tip:
If you’re mounting on a custom arch/tower, angle them slightly aft or toward the equator (depending on your sailing zone) to boost solar yield.

Do you have pics or a diagram of the "box" or tower setup? I could give more tailored advice with that.

iturn0image0turn0image1turn0image6turn0image8When installing solar panels on your Leopard 40 catamaran, positioning them slightly higher than the bimini or roofline is advisable to ensure optimal sun exposure and efficiency. This elevation helps avoid shading from structures like the boom or radar domes and promotes better air circulation beneath the panels, enhancing their performance.

However, it's essential to balance height with the vessel's stability and aesthetics. Excessive elevation can increase wind resistance and affect the boat's center of gravity. For instance, some installations position the top of the arch frame approximately 1,900mm (about 6.2 feet) above the deck to accommodate solar panels while maintaining structural integrity and visual appeal. citeturn0search11

Incorporating a slight aft tilt or orienting the panels towards the equator, depending on your typical cruising grounds, can further optimize solar gain. This angling maximizes exposure to sunlight throughout the day.

For a practical example, a Leopard 40 owner's version was equipped with a solar arch supporting four 410W SunPower solar panels, utilizing an MPPT controller to enhance energy capture. citeturn0search9

Given the custom nature of such installations, consulting with a marine architect or a professional experienced with Leopard catamarans is recommended. They can provide tailored advice to ensure the mounting height and configuration align with your vessel's design and your energy needs.

Now for installation of the foot plates i jeed a bolt that can go through my sugarscoop deck. How think is that area so i can know the size bolt i need.

[2025-04-03 09:30:39] ChatGPT:
On a 2017 Leopard 40, the **sugarscoop deck** (the aft boarding platform area) is typically constructed with:

- **Solid fiberglass or cored laminate** (often balsa or foam core).
- **Approximate thickness**: **20mm to 30mm** (around 3/4" to 1-1/4").

However, it's critical to confirm **whether it's solid glass or cored**, because:
- If it's **cored**, you'll need to **overdrill, epoxy fill, and redrill** to avoid water intrusion and core rot.
- If it’s **solid fiberglass**, you can drill directly, using proper backing plates.

### Bolt Sizing Guide:
- If the deck is ~25mm thick, go with a **2.5" to 3" stainless steel bolt** (1/4" or 5/16" diameter), depending on your foot plate’s hole size.
- Use **fender washers or aluminum/stainless backing plates** inside for strength.

If you want, I can help you plan out the drill-through and seal method too—just say the word. Also, a quick tap test or small pilot drill in a hidden spot can confirm the material type. Want help with that?

[2025-04-03 09:31:45] ChatGPT:
The **sugarscoop deck** area on your 2017 Leopard 40 is made of **fiberglass-reinforced plastic (FRP)**, and while the exact thickness of the sugarscoop area isn't explicitly specified, we can infer the likely build from similar construction references in the Marine Survey Report and builder standards.

- **Deck and transom areas**, including the sugarscoop, are described as **FRP with gelcoat finish**, and the **topsides are balsa-cored** in other locations【30:1†Pre-Purchase Condition and Value Report】.
- Typical **FRP laminate thickness in these areas is approximately 20mm to 30mm (0.75" to 1.25")**.
- Given this and similar catamaran constructions, the sugarscoop is likely at the lower end—**about 20–25mm thick**, potentially cored, though the transom was noted as solid FRP.

### Bolt Recommendation:
To go through this area safely:
- Use a **3" stainless steel bolt**, ideally 1/4" or 5/16" diameter.
- If cored (you can verify during drilling), **overdrill, fill with thickened epoxy, and redrill** to prevent core rot.

Here’s a solid step-by-step guide to **mounting foot plates through the sugarscoop deck** of your 2017 Leopard 40, with all the products you’ll need:

---

### **TOOLS & MATERIALS NEEDED**
- **Drill + drill bits**
- **Countersink bit**
- **Masking tape**
- **Vacuum or compressed air**
- **Mixing sticks + cups**
- **Caulking gun**
- **Sandpaper (80–120 grit)**

#### **PRODUCTS**
- **Marine epoxy**: *TotalBoat High-Performance Epoxy* or *West System 105/205*

---

### **INSTALLATION STEPS**

#### 1. **Mark & Drill**
- Position the foot plate and mark the bolt holes.
- Drill **oversized holes** (e.g. 1/2" if bolt is 1/4") through the deck to remove core if present.
- Check for core material with a small probe—remove any balsa/foam if present (you’ll see it in the drill shavings).

#### 2. **Dry & Clean**
- Vacuum out the holes and let them dry.
- Use a heat gun briefly if the area’s moist.

#### 3. **Epoxy Fill**
- Mix **epoxy + thickener** to peanut butter consistency.
- Fill the holes completely with epoxy to seal the core.
- Let cure overnight or per instructions.

#### 4. **Redrill for Bolt Size**
- Drill centered, proper-size holes through the cured epoxy plugs.

#### 5. **Countersink the Top**
- Use a countersink bit to create a slight bevel on top—this helps sealant form a gasket under the bolt head.

#### 6. **Seal & Bolt**
- Apply marine sealant under the foot plate and on the bolt shaft.
- Insert bolts, add washers and backing plates below.
- Tighten snugly but don’t over-torque (you’ll squeeze out all the sealant).

#### 7. **Clean & Cure**
- Clean any squeeze-out with mineral spirits or isopropyl alcohol.
- Let the sealant cure fully before loading (usually 24–48 hrs).

[2025-04-03 09:35:56] ChatGPT:
Based on your marine survey report, the **sugarscoop deck** and **transom area** of your 2017 Leopard 40 are constructed from **solid fiberglass (FRP)** with **no core material**:

> “White gelcoated FRP (fiber reinforced plastic) reverse transoms with steps. The interior and exterior of both transoms were visually inspected, percussion tested, and found in serviceable condition…”【36:0†Pre-Purchase Condition and Value Report for Leopard 40 SV CHEAP THRILLS VII Mr. James Gleason. 12th and 13th Novemebr 2024. Marine Survey Report.pdf】

That means you **do not need to worry about core rot** in this section—you can drill and bolt through directly. Still, it’s a good idea to:
- Use **marine sealant (e.g., Sikaflex 291)** to bed the bolts.
- Include **backing plates or large fender washers** inside for strength.

Let me know if you want to revise the mounting steps now that coring isn't a concern!

It is aluminum arch should we stick with that for bolts. And it says 5/16 

[2025-04-03 09:38:55] ChatGPT:
Thanks for that extra detail—since you're mounting a **5/16" bolt** into an **aluminum arch base**, here’s what matters for materials:

---

### **Bolt Material: Stick with 316 Stainless Steel**
Even though your arch is aluminum, **316 stainless bolts** are still the best choice for marine environments because:
- They resist corrosion, especially in saltwater.
- They're strong and long-lasting.
- They're commonly used with aluminum spars and arches on boats.

---

### **BUT — prevent galvanic corrosion!**
When **stainless steel touches aluminum**, you get **galvanic corrosion** over time, especially with saltwater exposure. To prevent this:

#### **Use isolation methods:**
- **Nylon or Delrin washers/spacers** between stainless and aluminum surfaces.
- Apply a **barrier compound** on contact surfaces:
  - *Tef-Gel* (best choice)
  - *Duralac*
  - *Lanocote* or *anti-seize* (marine grade)

---

### Final Bolt Setup:
- **Bolt**: 5/16" 316 stainless steel
- **Washer stack**:
  - Stainless flat washer
  - *Nylon* or isolating washer against aluminum
- **Nut**: 316 stainless nylock
- **Backing plate**: G10 or aluminum (with isolating compound too)

---

Let me know if you want help sourcing the exact washers or if you'd like a quick diagram of this bolt stack.

​the beam is bigger but that is the length we measured for it on our boat. It doesn't go to the edge of the surgar scoop only the midleish 13.5 ft in the middle.

[2025-04-03 09:44:48] ChatGPT:
Ah got it—thanks for the clarification!

Your **boat’s full beam is wider**, but the **arch is mounted more forward** on the sugarscoop, not all the way out to the hull sides. That **13.5 ft span** is the **actual mounting width** where the legs will land midships on the sugarscoop deck—not the full beam of the boat. That’s totally valid and common for solar arches on catamarans.

Here’s how that affects your install and confirms you’re still on the right track:

---

### **What This Means for Installation:**

#### 1. **You're still using the correct arch model.**
- The **Sail Arch (up to 16 ft beam)** gives you room to set the legs wherever you want **within that range**, including at 13.5 ft wide.
- As long as the **legs can be spaced and trimmed** to that width, you’re golden.

#### 2. **Base Positioning Is Flexible**
- Mounting further inboard helps reduce leverage, which improves stability.
- Just make sure there’s **enough backing space inside** the sugarscoop area (or engine locker wall) for through-bolts and backing plates.

---

### **Your Install Plan is Still Correct**

No changes to the installation steps I gave above. Just make sure:

- You **center the arch** visually (measure from side decks or lifelines if needed).
- Both legs sit flush with the deck surface—if your sugarscoop slopes inboard, the **pivoting bases will help** conform to that.
- You have **good access below the mounting point** for backing hardware.

   - Enlarge to 5/16” using the proper bit.
   - **Countersink** the tops to help sealant pool under bolt heads.

3. **Prep Surfaces**
   - Lightly sand the mounting areas and wipe clean with acetone or alcohol.

---

### **4. BOLTING DOWN THE ARCH**

1. **Apply Tef-Gel or Duralac** between stainless bolts and aluminum foot plates to prevent galvanic corrosion.

2. **Apply Marine Sealant**
   - Lay a bead under each foot plate and in each bolt hole.

3. **Insert Bolts**
   - Drop 5/16" x 2.5–3" bolts through the arch feet and deck.

4. **Add Backing Hardware**
   - Inside the sugarscoop (engine locker walls or underdeck):
     - Backing plate
     - Flat washer
     - Nylock nut

5. **Tighten Evenly**
   - Snug all bolts in sequence. Don’t overtighten.

---

### **5. FINAL ASSEMBLY & CLEANUP**

1. **Secure the Arch**
   - Final bolt down the arch leg-to-crossbar joints.

2. **Clean Squeeze-Out**
   - Wipe excess sealant using mineral spirits or alcohol.

3. **Cure Time**
   - Let cure 24–48 hours before mounting solar panels or accessories.

---

### **6. OPTIONAL NEXT STEPS**
- Mount solar panel rails to the crossbar.
- Use cable glands or bushings for wiring.
- Add drip loops and secure with UV zip ties.

​can 5200 be open and closed for use later so i can get a bigger container for later use?

[2025-04-03 10:49:29] ChatGPT:
Yes, 3M 5200 marine sealant **can** be resealed and reused later, but with some caveats:

- **Smaller Tubes (Caulking Gun Type):** These can be resealed with the original cap or by covering the tip tightly with foil or plastic wrap and rubber bands. However, once opened, the product starts curing from exposure to moisture in the air, and the tip may clog.

- **Larger Containers (Cartridge or Bulk):** These can be used over multiple applications if properly resealed, but you'll likely have to cut off the cured portion each time you reopen it.

**Tips to maximize reuse:**
- Store it **in a cool, dry place**.
- After use, squirt out a small amount to form a plug—this cured tip can often be pulled out next time, leaving usable product behind.
- Seal tightly and use a moisture barrier (like a zip-top bag with desiccant if available).

Despite these tricks, once opened, the shelf life drops dramatically (often down to weeks). If you need a lot later, it might be better to wait and open the big container closer to when you’ll use most of it. Want help calculating how much you’ll likely need for your next job?

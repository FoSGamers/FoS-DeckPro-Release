[2024-09-09 09:34:40] FoSGamers:
check the TOS of whatnot for card breaks. I need to know if I can roll it to the next day if everyone agrees. It is september 9th 2024

[2024-09-09 09:34:57] ChatGPT:
According to Whatnot's current policies on card breaks, all product for a card break must be opened in the same live show. Card breaks are not allowed to span across multiple streams or be rolled over to another day, even if all participants agree. Additionally, all buyers must receive at least one card per purchase, and breaks cannot include non-card items like jerseys or memorabilia. These rules are intended to ensure transparency and fairness during live streams.

If you find yourself unable to complete a break due to unforeseen circumstances, it is best to contact Whatnot’s support team to see if there are any specific accommodations that might apply, but generally, breaks must be completed within the same session【7†source】【8†source】.

[2024-09-09 11:21:36] FoSGamers:
if I have screen shots saying to roll over since that is what they wanted does that help or matter?

[2024-09-09 11:21:43] ChatGPT:
Unfortunately, having screenshots showing participants agreeing to roll over the break will not change Whatnot’s policy. According to their rules, **card breaks cannot span multiple streams**, and the product must be opened in the same live session. Even with participant agreement, this policy remains in place to ensure the integrity of the platform and protect all buyers involved【7†source】【8†source】【9†source】.

However, you can try contacting Whatnot support with the screenshots for further clarification, but it's likely that the platform will adhere to their stated guidelines regardless of participant consent.

[2024-09-09 11:24:23] FoSGamers:
so what are we supposed to do when it does not fill?

[2024-09-09 11:24:42] ChatGPT:
If a break does not fill on Whatnot, the best course of action is to follow their guidelines for unsold spots. Here’s what you can do:

1. **Sell Remaining Spots in Future Breaks**: You can sell the remaining spots in future breaks while still adhering to Whatnot’s shipping requirements, which is typically within two business days. However, **the product cannot be opened until all spots are sold**, so you may need to run additional shows to fill those spots before opening the product【7†source】【9†source】.

2. **Refund Buyers**: If you are unable to fill the break, you should offer a refund to the buyers who have already purchased spots. This ensures transparency and keeps your buyers happy, which is essential for maintaining trust on the platform【9†source】.

3. **Plan Smaller Breaks**: To avoid this issue in the future, consider hosting smaller or more budget-friendly breaks where there is a higher likelihood of selling all spots. This way, you won’t be stuck with an incomplete break.

While these steps may not guarantee a quick solution, they will help you stay compliant with Whatnot’s policies and keep your customers satisfied.

[2024-09-09 11:25:09] FoSGamers:
can you double check 1 is accurate.

[2024-09-09 11:25:22] ChatGPT:
If your card break doesn't fill, Whatnot provides a couple of options:

1. **Refund Buyers**: If some spots in the break do not sell, you should honor refund requests from buyers. This ensures transparency and protects the buyer’s trust in your service. However, the break cannot be rolled over to a future stream. Sellers are prohibited from spanning a card break across multiple shows【7†source】【19†source】.

2. **Sell Remaining Spots in Future Breaks**: You can hold onto the unsold spots and offer them in future breaks, as long as the sealed product has not been opened yet. This approach gives you flexibility while maintaining compliance with Whatnot’s rules. Just be aware that you must meet Whatnot’s 2-business day shipping requirement once the product is opened【7†source】【19†source】.

To avoid this situation in the future, consider running smaller breaks or pricing the spots more competitively to increase the chances of filling the break in a single session.

[2024-09-09 11:25:58] FoSGamers:
Confirm this is accurate 100% and show the exact quotes from whatnot TOS.

[2024-09-09 11:26:15] ChatGPT:
Here’s the confirmation of the rules and guidelines from Whatnot’s Terms of Service for card breaks based on the sources:

1. **Refund Buyers for Unsold Spots**: If your break doesn’t fill and some spots remain unsold, **you should honor refund requests from buyers**. Sellers can sell remaining spots in future breaks while ensuring the shipping requirement is met, **but no card breaks can span multiple shows**. This means once the break is started, it must be completed within the same live session.

   > "Sellers should honor any buyer refund requests but can sell spots in future breaks (while respecting Whatnot’s 2-business day shipping requirement) so long as the sealed product has not yet been opened. Sellers may not cancel sold break spots for going below a desired amount, doing so will result in account action."【19†source】

2. **Cannot Span Multiple Shows**: Whatnot strictly prohibits spanning a break across multiple streams. All products must be opened during the same session. Even if spots remain unsold, you **cannot roll the break over to another show**.

   > "No Card Breaks that span multiple shows... You cannot open product from a Card Break over the course of multiple streams."【7†source】【19†source】

These rules confirm that if your break doesn’t fill, your options are to refund buyers or sell remaining spots in future breaks before the product is opened, but **you cannot span the break across multiple shows** or roll it to another day.

It looks like the text is becoming very dense and difficult to read due to lack of spacing and line breaks.

[01:09:27] want to attack that Raider being new or
[01:09:29] do you want to run away now you have the
[01:09:31] option of being some characters you
[01:09:33] could be Hammer spark Hammer is the
[01:09:35] brute spark is the engineer Finn's the
[01:09:38] rager Rogue and then uh I can't remember
[01:09:41] what the detective's name is there's a

[01:09:47] with nothing here all right here we go
[01:09:49] let's get this going again we'll do
[01:09:51] another attack as Finn I like it so as
[01:09:54] Finn you have two knives that you get
[01:09:57] all right so that gives you a plus four
[01:09:58] on your rolls and being a small Raider
[01:10:01] it's only 14 so that means you need 10
[01:10:02] or more so let's uh zoom
[01:10:07] out we are already zoomed out we're
[01:10:10] going to
[01:10:12] roll and you got nice you got 16 and
[01:10:15] then you only you only hit for one two
[01:10:17] all right you only hit three for each
[01:10:19] your weapons there but that Raider was
[01:10:22] scared of you coming at him he's trying
[01:10:25] to steal some of your stuff so what

[03:26:05] on it
[03:26:07] somewhere you
[03:26:09] grab lean towards
[03:26:11] it and as it's scanning you you press
[03:26:15] one of those button
[03:26:18] s and a couple of them to see what
[03:26:20] happens Robel
[03:26:21] lash let's see where are
[03:26:26] you now you have some luck so what we'll
[03:26:29] do is you need a nine or
[03:26:32] higher and we'll see what happens oh no
[03:26:36] you got a
[03:26:37] four well that button doesn't do
[03:26:40] anything because the Rogue skinna gets
[03:26:42] extremely mad and starts shooting at you
[03:26:47] now it shoots at you let's see what
[03:26:49] happens while it shoots at you oh you
[03:26:52] got lucky it got four also it missed
[03:26:55] wildly but it goes running it goes
[03:26:57] flying away to scan the next thing
[03:27:00] because it missed you so badly that Luck
[03:27:03] came into play there I
[03:27:05] guess all right we have two left it's
[03:27:08] either Infinity or Domin area and it's
[03:27:10] the end of the uh adventuring here we
[03:27:12] only have two two things left that's
[03:27:13] going to be going on we'll see who gets
[03:27:16] what's it going to
[03:27:18] be this is going to be where we get our
[03:27:20] big
[03:27:21] hits cuz that's how it always happens
[03:27:24] the ones that no one wants jump on it's
[03:27:26] always the ones at the end with the big
[03:27:27] hits the last pack Magics you know those

[03:31:12] into a desert Bandit
[03:31:18] Scrapper all
[03:31:19] right they use a blunt weapon there you
[03:31:22] can easily disarm them what are you
[03:31:25] going to do my
[03:31:26] friend
[03:31:40] Dwayne going to attack all right I like
[03:31:42] the attack idea you always can run away
[03:31:45] sometimes people like to run away all
[03:31:46] right but this guy he's kind of weak all
[03:31:48] right
[03:31:49] Dwayne

[03:32:01] let's see what happens
[03:32:03] Dwayne I rolled him the wrong
[03:32:07] way because that'll get you a hit
[03:32:09] because I rolled it [ __ ] fell out the
[03:32:11] wrong way I was holding the Box
[03:32:13] backwards so you want to take that one
[03:32:15] or you want me to roll so you can see
[03:32:19] it you got that Bandit Scrapper in front
[03:32:22] of you all right you take it you swing
[03:32:24] your Mighty Hammer you hit him for eight
[03:32:27] damage and in the process of that he
[03:32:29] drops his his
[03:32:32] uh little stick that he had there and he
[03:32:35] falls to the
[03:32:37] ground tries to get up let's see if they
[03:32:39] can get up here before anything here
[03:32:41] let's see they do get
[03:32:44] up and they s swing at you with their
[03:32:46] with their thing and they only get two
[03:32:48] damage they got up and they got able to
[03:32:50] swing at you for two damage that's all
[03:32:52] right though Dwayne because they run
[03:32:55] away
[03:32:57] scared you from 89 Health down to 87
[03:33:00] they run away scared and in the
[03:33:02] process that
[03:33:07] Bandit drops 13 pogs right there for you
[03:33:12] oh my that's nice he getting you up on
[03:33:15] those pogs there so the next time you uh
[03:33:16] encounter a storage place one of the
[03:33:19] safe havens you
[03:33:21] can get something big 13 pogs you're now
[03:33:25] at 54 pogs my friend look at that I like
[03:33:31] it I like it all right so we are going
[03:33:36] to do this so everyone knows that we're
[03:33:40] starting
[03:33:41] this the reason I hit start is cuz I
[03:33:43] like to do it like so cuz because we
[03:33:46] want to do we'll do our giveaway again
[03:33:49] we had the aoran legend that we had out
[03:33:52] there and we're going to do a buyer
[03:33:53] giveaway all right
[03:34:06] buyer all right we're going to start
[03:34:08] this and we're going to go for only 30
[03:34:12] seconds so if you're a buyer make sure
[03:34:14] you jump in cuz it only runs for 30
[03:34:16] seconds I'm going to hit finish break

[03:34:21] completed the break 30 seconds you guys
[03:34:23] have to get in there as buyers make sure

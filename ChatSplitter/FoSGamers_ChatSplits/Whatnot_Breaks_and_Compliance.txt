I need you to learn everything about the whatnot terms of service in regards to gambling, breaks, and pull boxes, and mystery bags, mystery boxes, and stuff like that, and also their new break feature. I'm going to plan on using their new break feature to create things I'm going to call mini virtual pull boxes, where I'm going to have a bunch of different ones. They'll all be randomized. Each one of them will have a high for whatever the thing is going to be, like the high value item in there, and the rest of them will be medium or lower ones, but that way it'll make it kind of enticing for people to go after, for the people that like kind of like gambling-like people that want to go try to get a high value item, but still pay something else, that no matter what they'll get something else of something lower one, and I figured like maybe like 10 things per thing there, so like it's a 10% chance that I'm getting it, and what I'll do is I'll run it until somebody, I'll run a bunch, I'll have a bunch of different ones so people can choose whatever they want to try, like dozens of different ones because they're pretty easy to make, and then all you need to do, all I would do is have if like after a certain amount of pulls from that box, the box is closed, and we don't get to do the, and then we'll go on, like every, like say well like since the mini ones and we get the opportunities are there, you have a better chance of getting things than other ones, we do it as a, after like you know, say four pulls, that box is, that break is closed after four spots have taken, the break is finished, we end up closing the break and going on, and you can only participate in the other ones, so it only allows you to get four chances to get the big hit pretty much. Let me know if that sounds like a good idea, if it's legally acceptable, if it's acceptable by whatnot terms of service, and if I can do that, and have things be okay with it, not get, not get in any trouble in any way, shape, or form.

Your idea for "mini virtual pull boxes" on Whatnot is creative, but there are several key considerations related to Whatnot's terms of service and policies to ensure you're compliant.

### Whatnot's Policy on Breaks, Pull Boxes, and Gambling:
1. **Mystery Boxes and Pull Games**: Whatnot allows the sale of mystery boxes and pull games, but strict rules apply. Sellers must not mislead buyers about the value of the items inside, and you must provide specific information on each box or pack. This includes clearly listing the **floor (lowest value)**, **ceiling (highest value)**, and **average value**, as well as the **number of items** in each set. Inflating values or providing misleading information could lead to refunds or account bans【10†source】【11†source】.

2. **Gambling-Like Formats**: Whatnot prohibits actual gambling, which includes activities where buyers pay for a chance to win something of higher value. However, structured pulls, as you’re describing, can work as long as **every buyer receives an item**. For example, each buyer must receive a card in a break, or an item in a mystery pull, even if it's not the high-value item【11†source】. Structuring your "mini pull boxes" as a form of breaks or pulls with transparent odds and guaranteed items can help align with these rules.

3. **Card Breaks**: The breaks must remain transparent. Whatnot requires that the full process of opening items in a break remains visible on camera at all times, and all participants should know the rules upfront (e.g., how cards or items are distributed). You cannot pre-sell spots off-platform, and breaks should conclude within a single live session【10†source】【12†source】.

4. **No Deceptive Practices**: When running your virtual pull boxes, avoid making claims that could be considered deceptive. For example, stating that an item could be worth a certain value must be backed by market data, and you cannot overhype the chances of getting high-value items【11†source】.

### Whatnot’s New Break Feature:
The new Whatnot breaks feature could streamline your pull box idea. This feature allows you to create breaks quickly, manage them easily with tools like randomizers for spot assignments, and export the information for fulfillment efficiently. You can use formats like "Pick 2, Choose 1" or "Stash or Pass," which could integrate well with your concept of limiting participation to a few pulls【12†source】.

### Legal and Practical Concerns:
While your idea is viable under Whatnot’s guidelines, you must:
- Ensure full transparency about the value and odds in your pull boxes.
- Guarantee that every participant walks away with something, even if it's not the top item.
- Make sure the break or pull process is visible at all times during the stream.

In conclusion, your idea can be implemented, but you’ll need to ensure that all rules around transparency, break format, and delivery of promised items are followed to avoid any issues with Whatnot’s compliance team.

This would have everything set with the floor, ceiling, and average for everything. Plus, they'd all be able to see everything that's in it, since the breaks would have literally listed out every item that's in there. So they would be able to go and see the exact items in there and look at the prices. So, I mean, I don't think I need to put floor, ceiling, and average, since all the exact items are in there. I think what I'll have to just do is put in just an average, but let me know. I'll just, you know, I'll put a floor, ceiling, and average anyway, just for the hell of it, just to make it easy. But I think what we should, I think it would be a good idea for us to do it that way. That way I have, like, one high-priced item on some of them, and the people that really like to try to go for the gambling thing, and all the rest are lower ones, like that type of a situation. And then some of them that are medium, middle ones, where they're all, you know, good-deal ones, like all over the place. And is this viable that I can say after four spots are taken from it, I close it out, and we aren't allowed to do it? Is that acceptable? Or does that sound like it's okay? It gives everybody a good chance that there's only ten spots type thing.

It sounds like your approach is largely compliant with Whatnot's policies, but there are a few areas to double-check for full alignment:

1. **Transparency on Pricing**: Although you plan to list out every item in your breaks, it’s still advisable to include the floor (minimum), ceiling (maximum), and average prices of the items in each break. Even with full item visibility, Whatnot’s policy expects transparency around pricing to avoid any potential confusion about the value of what customers are purchasing【10†source】. Including this information helps ensure there’s no ambiguity for buyers, especially in cases where participants are less familiar with market values.

2. **High-Value Items and Randomization**: Structuring breaks where one item is high-value and others are of lower value aligns well with Whatnot’s gambling-like appeal, but ensure that each buyer receives **something** of value, as required. Additionally, make sure that any form of randomization used to assign spots or items is clearly outlined in the show or listing, and be prepared to showcase how you will randomize spots if not using Whatnot's built-in features【11†source】【12†source】.

3. **Limiting the Number of Spots**: Closing out a break after a set number of pulls (e.g., four out of ten spots taken) is acceptable as long as it is clearly communicated to buyers before the break begins. This could be framed as a "limited chance break," giving participants a defined window of opportunity, which could enhance excitement. However, ensure that this is explained thoroughly in your listing and show notes to avoid any confusion or claims of unfairness【11†source】.

4. **Listing Exact Items**: Since you're planning to list the exact items in each break, this adds clarity, which Whatnot supports. Just ensure that the high-value items are correctly marked, and the description of the break is detailed. Buyers need to understand exactly what they are bidding on and what their odds are, whether you randomize or allow them to pick specific spots【12†source】.

In conclusion, your plan is viable as long as you maintain transparency in pricing and item descriptions, clearly communicate the terms of each break, and ensure that all participants receive something of value. Including floor, ceiling, and average values along with listing the items provides an extra layer of clarity, which is in line with Whatnot's guidelines.

What was the game that had to do with, like, artifact hunting or something like that in pull boxes?

[2024-10-18 10:28:30] ChatGPT:
The game you're referring to involving "artifact hunting" in pull boxes is likely **"Wasteland Adventure"**. This interactive game from FoSGamers involves players navigating through a wasteland and discovering artifacts or resources. Participants choose from characters with unique abilities, and outcomes depend on random draws or dice rolls. In this game, artifact hunting could be one of the key encounters, as players aim to gather valuable items or cards during the game【5†source】.

If you're thinking about a similar setup for your breaks or pull boxes, you could integrate an "artifact hunt" theme, where rare or special items are the artifacts players hope to find. This would align well with the excitement of treasure hunting or discovery in your breaks.

[00:59:31] showed up like at the same time as
[00:59:32] something and I just didn't notice it if
[00:59:34] that makes sense because sometimes when
[00:59:35] they pop in when something else is
[00:59:37] rolling it doesn't always show that
[00:59:39] somebody came in with
[00:59:42] something oh it came in probably it

[01:00:01] quickly I'm going to put this out of the
[01:00:02] way anyways that way it gives me more
[01:00:04] room to look at those those are the
[01:00:06] picks from them let me just do this
[01:00:08] quickly for your roll all right do you
[01:00:10] want me to do a random one here I have
[01:00:12] to get in order here so let me do this
[01:00:13] in order and I'll get to you right after
[01:00:14] this rust
[01:00:17] okay no it was H sometimes it rolls
[01:00:20] through like when somebody does like a
[01:00:22] giveaway win at the same time and it
[01:00:24] like happens to time something right it
[01:00:26] just like I don't always get
[01:00:28] notified so anywhere you want to go here
[01:00:30] for like we were doing before and I'm
[01:00:32] gonna open up your packs here Russ right
[01:00:34] after because I didn't notice those were
[01:00:36] missed I'm
[01:00:39] sorry and today what we're doing nothing
[01:00:41] specific nothing huge just a little fun
[01:00:44] some tips for
[01:00:46] charity nothing over the top just a
[01:00:48] little bit of fun
[01:00:49] today 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
[01:00:57] 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27
[01:01:02] 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40
[01:01:06] 41 42 43 44 45 now I know it's not going
[01:01:11] to be necessarily the biggest thing in
[01:01:12] the world but all we're trying to get is
[01:01:14] a little goal here not a big goal just a
[01:01:16] little goal all right let's see what
[01:01:17] happens here good luck my friend you
[01:01:19] have oh
[01:01:21] no you have a large Raider in front of
[01:01:24] you our friend now you have one
[01:01:27] roll one roll here okay what are you
[01:01:31] going to
[01:01:32] do what are you going to do with that
[01:01:35] large Raider and you have the choice of
[01:01:36] dice too that you've had in the
[01:01:40] past and spicy I like it coming in with
[01:01:43] a spot there
[01:01:56] we'll see what to do here what do you
[01:01:57] want to do oh put that right there
[01:01:59] quickly with your Raider you up you have
[01:02:00] to get 17 or more to hit them you decide
[01:02:05] you want the black one purple one red
[01:02:09] one then we're going to roll and see
[01:02:11] what
[01:02:13] happens you have to decide what you're
[01:02:15] going to use spicy cuz you do have a
[01:02:18] plasma rifle with a couple rounds of
[01:02:19] ammo you have the pistols you have the
[01:02:21] sword and you have the AR ammo
[01:02:26] purple here we go charge him with a
[01:02:29] sword well look at that one that works
[01:02:32] you got a 14 with your sword you charge
[01:02:34] in and you hit that's all that matters
[01:02:37] is you need to hit the large ridar
[01:02:39] because you take such a large chunk out
[01:02:41] of that Raider that he drops his axe to
[01:02:43] the
[01:02:44] ground but when he drops the axe you go
[01:02:47] to pick it up oh it shattered already he
[01:02:50] runs
[01:02:51] away and he drops though
[01:02:56] two rounds of plasma
[01:02:58] ammo
[01:03:02] and five
[01:03:05] pogs that brings you up to 18
[01:03:08] pogs
[01:03:12] and four rounds of plasma ammo well look
[01:03:15] at that my friend more
[01:03:21] pogs that was a quick quick a quick

[02:13:14] what do you all want to do
[02:13:16] here you're going to see what happens
[02:13:18] because this here we're going to let you
[02:13:20] know this is in going to be an
[02:13:22] 18 to hit okay it will be an 18 to hit
[02:13:27] but it is going to
[02:13:30] have 100
[02:13:32] Health okay now there's a trick to this
[02:13:34] one that you haven't figured out yet
[02:13:36] you'll get it at some point
[02:13:39] though light it up with the
[02:13:43] AR sounds
[02:13:45] sus yeah you're going to have to see
[02:13:47] what happens which one you going to use
[02:13:48] for your dice here
[02:13:52] we go with in the AR I like it we're
[02:13:53] going to do it we can do that run right
[02:13:55] in with the
[02:13:58] AR running on in what dice are we
[02:14:02] using
[02:14:04] 18 you have to hit 18 to hit it or
[02:14:08] equivalent of that with your
[02:14:14] stuff Dip's going to lay down and take a
[02:14:16] couple shots I like it you going to use
[02:14:17] your plasma rifle or you going to use
[02:14:19] your uh your pistol
[02:14:23] is what you were doing your pistols you
[02:14:24] have two of those
[02:14:28] remember right you got
[02:14:32] two went up to 18 ammo right or no you
[02:14:35] back way
[02:14:39] yet yes that's why I thought so
[02:14:47] okay so you lean over take a shot with
[02:14:50] your
[02:14:54] pistols what other
[02:14:57] creatures there are no creatures right
[02:14:59] now it's
[02:15:01] just just that that's
[02:15:06] it spicy oh oh I don't
[02:15:10] know maybe I don't know
[02:15:14] exactly so you running in with the red
[02:15:19] one and you shoot it with the Y
[02:15:22] oh well look at that you get an 18 and
[02:15:25] you hit
[02:15:27] it or you going to use a critical hit on
[02:15:29] it okay spicy you have your
[02:15:32] critical you have a critical hit we
[02:15:35] don't have a critical hit for you do
[02:15:37] we no I don't think we did but you hit
[02:15:39] him you hit him that brings the creature
[02:15:44] get three shots on it goes

[02:31:59] flamethrower which is now
[02:32:01] there oh there is a flamethrower my
[02:32:09] friends
[02:32:11] yes so you have to
[02:32:14] decide who is going to take the
[02:32:18] flamethrower and what's go on with the
[02:32:20] rest of the stuff there's only one
[02:32:23] flamethrower that's left one
[02:32:25] flamethrower
[02:32:26] there can you change your mind I don't I
[02:32:29] don't know what was going on at all
[02:32:30] right now I was getting that ready so if
[02:32:32] I miss something I'm sorry so that you
[02:32:34] have so you have currently a
[02:32:37] flamethrower you have a plasma
[02:32:39] rifle assault rifle ammo of 30 pistol
[02:32:43] ammo of 30 you have a critical hit
[02:32:47] amulet and a flamethrower
[02:32:56] I'm good with that if you guys are also
[02:32:58] okay with that
[02:33:02] dip night
[02:33:05] Nico we good with
[02:33:08] that all right cool I like it we'll go
[02:33:12] spicy you okay with that
[02:33:14] 91 I think we're good with it it seems
[02:33:16] like everyone's good with that
[02:33:20] all right that sounds like a good plan
[02:33:22] too there you go so spicy gets the
[02:33:32] flamethrower you also have the gator
[02:33:33] dowo armor by the
[02:33:36] way which is why you haven't been dying
[02:33:38] as quickly by the way
[02:33:44] spicy it's why you've been um not as
[02:33:47] injured as others
[02:33:51] so there you go
[02:33:57] flamethrower now this is only going to
[02:34:00] have I have to call them as like eight
[02:34:02] I'm going call them bullets kind of but
[02:34:03] they're more like flame throws you got
[02:34:06] eight that you can use on a
[02:34:10] creatures you have a flame flamethrower
[02:34:12] there you go there you go dip what we're
[02:34:14] going to do a dip I see did you want
[02:34:16] anything here the plasma rifle dip
[02:34:20] maybe or you could get the pistol ammo
[02:34:23] want to take all the pistol ammo since
[02:34:24] you got the
[02:34:25] pistols like kind of like a burst like
[02:34:28] kind of like a flamethrower yeah well
[02:34:29] it's it's just more or less I just need
[02:34:31] to have you have enough to use it to
[02:34:34] take out an area kind of like a burst
[02:34:37] kind yeah it doesn't go continuous it's
[02:34:38] more like a you shoot you aim and it
[02:34:41] flame shoots like almost like a fireball
[02:34:43] in a
[02:34:45] way Nico would like three pogs
[02:34:52] three fogs out of the 16 all
[02:34:58] right all right so here we go
[02:35:01] so
[02:35:04] dip okay we're going to go with dip you
[02:35:07] didn't say what you wanted I'm going to
[02:35:08] give dip the pistol ammo so Dip's going
[02:35:10] to go up to um you had shot almost all
[02:35:13] of your
[02:35:14] bullets so you're going to go up
[02:35:17] to 31 rounds
[02:35:22] and then Luke with three
[02:35:25] pogs Luke with three
[02:35:29] pogs 91's going to
[02:35:32] [Music]
[02:35:34] take 91 will'll take you said the rest
[02:35:36] of the pogs what we'll do is we're going
[02:35:38] to give the assault rifle ammo as said
[02:35:41] to
[02:35:42] 91 so that's going to bring you to
[02:35:51] give me my math for a

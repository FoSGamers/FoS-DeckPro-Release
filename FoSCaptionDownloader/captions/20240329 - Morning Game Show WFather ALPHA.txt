[00:03:02] different because I have a 360
[00:03:05] camera and with a 360 camera it has a
[00:03:08] whole 180 degree view and the nice thing
[00:03:11] about that 180 degree view is if I take
[00:03:13] the whole top half of this screen
[00:03:16] here you could potentially see my whole
[00:03:19] office behind me from like a whole like
[00:03:22] 180 degree view where I'm going to have
[00:03:24] eggs hidden you'll be able to see them
[00:03:28] but they're going to be you know you'll
[00:03:29] see them in we can walk up with my I'll
[00:03:30] take my phone to walk around and we'll
[00:03:32] walk up and find
[00:03:36] him yes dark depending on what sometimes
[00:03:39] my kid do does sometimes it's my wife
[00:03:41] most of the times it's my kids it
[00:03:43] depends on what one you got um there's
[00:03:45] my wife's helped out a couple times and
[00:03:46] she said she's like because the kids
[00:03:48] were doing it and she was like doing it
[00:03:49] with them
[00:03:51] so oh cool cool thank you that tell the
[00:03:55] kids that you had a great time and you
[00:03:57] liked it a
[00:03:58] lot
[00:04:00] I do appreciate that they I know they
[00:04:02] will all right we're going to put that
[00:04:04] back no one wanted started out with that
[00:04:06] this morning I know they they have a
[00:04:08] great time like they asked what they
[00:04:09] could do to help and my youngest I was
[00:04:11] like uh you know what I'm not sure what
[00:04:13] you can do to help right now um
[00:04:28] so so with that being said I was like
[00:04:31] he's like can I do anything to help and
[00:04:33] I was yeah sure how about you like I was
[00:04:35] like writing than you on things like can

[00:04:40] like then he some like talked about
[00:04:42] tokens and he said I'll draw some and he
[00:04:44] drew a couple of them and then he
[00:04:45] started getting more elaborate with them
[00:04:47] and then my oldest started doing some
[00:04:49] and then it changed into what it is
[00:04:51] now so that's kind of what we're at at
[00:04:53] the moment I'm going to put up a wild of
[00:04:55] drain with this and let's throw this up

[00:05:05] of Randomness and that's the thing here
[00:05:07] I do random things until somebody tells
[00:05:08] me what they want oh
[00:05:10] no do I not have my um hold on a
[00:05:15] second I don't think I updated it give

[00:12:35] go no one wants to do that all right
[00:12:38] well we'll I'll put that back over here
[00:12:40] in case somebody wants to try that later
[00:12:42] that's a fun one when we do those ones
[00:12:43] so I'm going to just put that right up
[00:12:45] there oh no I kicked the light and it
[00:12:47] went out I'm dark over this
[00:12:53] side there we go I fixed it we're back
[00:12:57] all right so uh let's put up some more
[00:12:59] fun things and I'm going to grab a
[00:13:00] giveaway out here and we'll see what we
[00:13:02] got going let's throw up
[00:13:06] um let's throw out something like this a
[00:13:09] little uh foil etched card from
[00:13:11] Commander Masters say thank you for
[00:13:14] hanging out with
[00:13:15] us we'll throw that up here right here
[00:13:18] that'll go up a little ogre slum Lord
[00:13:20] will come up
[00:13:21] there so you do that and split the
[00:13:25] collector pack with you no it wouldn't
[00:13:27] be with me it would be with another
[00:13:29] person so that's why I was saying we
[00:13:30] need two people so you there's why
[00:13:33] that's why there's two of them available
[00:13:35] if you see there's two of the pick your
[00:13:36] own break available so you would buy in
[00:13:38] and then another person one Buy in
[00:13:40] that's why I do them kind of a quick way
[00:13:41] to get through them so that you're not
[00:13:42] hanging out for like 45 minutes to an
[00:13:44] hour you can have like two people buy in
[00:13:47] that way you can literally just do it
[00:13:49] really quickly or you can have like five
[00:13:51] people buy in if you want to do a big
[00:13:52] one and wait around so like if say you
[00:13:54] wanted to wait around and do a pick your
[00:13:55] own break I could label it something and
[00:13:58] put it up there that's I was saying if
[00:13:59] you want to pick your own break at some
[00:14:01] point say you want to do something and
[00:14:03] try to get people and you're going to be
[00:14:04] hanging out with me for a while say
[00:14:05] you're like you're going hang out with
[00:14:06] me for like an hour this morning because
[00:14:07] you got nothing to do say you say you
[00:14:09] want to go you know what I want to get
[00:14:10] like two set boost I want two Commander
[00:14:12] masters of the set boosters and I want
[00:14:15] one of U the Lord of the Rings here to
[00:14:18] be the uh the one that we split and you
[00:14:20] could do something like that and try to
[00:14:21] get something to do with and that's why
[00:14:23] I was saying it's like a pick your own
[00:14:24] break I'm just throwing these up here
[00:14:25] randomly because no one was looking at
[00:14:28] anything just kind of going through the
[00:14:30] options of the stuff that I have so yeah
[00:14:32] that's all it was there nothing
[00:14:33] spectacular on that pretty easy though
[00:14:35] but this if you guys want to what it
[00:14:37] would be is you yeah it would be want
[00:14:38] somebody else jump in so it's here we go
[00:14:41] this is what it is
[00:14:43] here all right pick your own break one
[00:14:45] person would get modern Horizon ioria
[00:14:49] the other would get the other modern
[00:14:50] Horizon ioria then you would split the
[00:14:52] uh L of the Rings one or you can split
[00:14:55] all all of them if that's what you want
[00:14:57] to do I'll do it I'll do like a digit
[00:14:59] break on all of them if that's what you
[00:15:00] want to do or a color break on all of
[00:15:02] them but most of the time when you do
[00:15:03] the small ones people like doing just
[00:15:05] the splitting the big one in the middle
[00:15:06] the the like low of the Rings one in the
[00:15:07] middle there so that's all it is there
[00:15:09] little bit of a fun thing that uh kind
[00:15:11] of like do a little a mini break in a
[00:15:13] away that's all it was but I'm going to
[00:15:15] put that back over here like I did again
[00:15:17] in case somebody wants to try that at
[00:15:18] another time maybe I'll take those apart
[00:15:20] I don't know we'll hang out though we'll
[00:15:22] keep going I'm going to put up my uh
[00:15:24] packs here so you guys know what I do
[00:15:25] have you have our um
[00:15:30] we have our games that we have like we
[00:15:32] always do so I'm actually going to put
[00:15:34] up
[00:15:35] um I'll put up another one of them move
[00:15:38] up the adventure game maybe you want to
[00:15:40] pick a character here that you want to

[00:17:36] lie I've had places where weather has
[00:17:38] significantly interrupted how everything
[00:17:41] worked um I worked at a place where like
[00:17:44] every time the wind blew the freaking
[00:17:46] internet came out and half the time the
[00:17:48] F power dropped like it was like
[00:17:50] somebody sneezed in the wrong
[00:17:52] direction and it was because it was just
[00:17:54] like an old building and that's really
[00:17:56] what it was but it was just still one of
[00:17:57] those things that just kind of
[00:18:00] funny we'll throw out something like

[00:18:20] you like what we do here some of you
[00:18:22] like having fun with us playing our

[00:18:40] because uh people were saying I it was
[00:18:42] not the best microphone I know it wasn't
[00:18:43] because it was using it off my phone
[00:18:45] there so I bought another one and I
[00:18:47] think that might sound a little bit
[00:18:48] better that was my fault for having that
[00:18:49] so far away from me I just realized that
[00:18:51] I had it like Wicked far away from
[00:18:57] me
[00:19:01] cuz my kids ask for a YouTube channel
[00:19:05] key coins and I'm helping do

[00:35:26] somebody selling something somewhere
[00:35:27] can't remember exactly where it was but
[00:35:30] uh it wasn't whatnot and then we looked

[02:27:40] this is the uh Russian
[02:27:42] roommate all
[02:27:45] right there you go
[02:27:48] ah as wolfers and uh that Russian
[02:27:52] roommate had a brick of cocaine sitting
[02:27:56] on the desk making bags of them for sell
[02:28:00] at campus now I was
[02:28:02] like what the
[02:28:05] [ __ ] what is going on here he goes yeah
[02:28:09] this is his roommate and I'm like hi I'm
[02:28:11] being polite shook his hand we left and
[02:28:14] I go um we should probably not go ever
[02:28:16] back there and I think you should
[02:28:17] probably get out of that place yeah I've
[02:28:18] been trying to get out of there for um
[02:28:21] the entire semester but I can't really
[02:28:23] say anything about it because I think
[02:28:24] he's part of the Russian mob and I don't
[02:28:26] want to be
[02:28:28] killed so he had to live for an entire
[02:28:31] year with what we suspect is a Russian
[02:28:34] mobster selling um bricks of cocaine out
[02:28:38] of his dorm
[02:28:39] room uh and then finally that the next
[02:28:42] uh he um this the second semester I mean
[02:28:45] that first half of the year he had to
[02:28:47] live with him the second half of the
[02:28:48] year he ended up moving in the house we
[02:28:50] we helped him get away from that guy we
[02:28:51] let him move in the house early because
[02:28:53] we generally don't let freshman move in

[02:28:56] when he was when he brothered up we let
[02:28:58] him move in that was one of those like

[03:11:56] packs yeah my son did competitive
[03:11:58] swimming for a little while but I think
[03:12:01] um they were focusing on the other the
[03:12:04] team the team um that the the group that
[03:12:06] swam at the other pool more they kept
[03:12:09] changing out all of the
[03:12:11] um all of the coaches and he never had a
[03:12:14] stable coach so he could never really
[03:12:16] progress well so he kind of got a little
[03:12:18] frustrated and wants to try soccer but
[03:12:22] nice hits there
[03:12:23] Betty wastelands like 24 nice
[03:12:27] dude nice
[03:12:36] one yeah exactly so like they were

[03:12:39] extra 30 minutes away from us they put
[03:12:41] all the effort into that school in orand
[03:12:44] instead of doing the one that which is
[03:12:47] and where we were at and they just kind
[03:12:49] of ignored it and kept moving people
[03:12:50] around and we were like he kept getting
[03:12:52] frustrated not having a good time um and
[03:12:55] you could tell he was getting frustrated
[03:12:56] because he'd start getting better and
[03:12:57] then they'd switch a coach out and he be
[03:12:59] like
[03:13:01] seriously so um when
[03:13:04] um when the coach of the older kids team
[03:13:07] for the soccer team when my younger son
[03:13:10] was um like hanging out with them the

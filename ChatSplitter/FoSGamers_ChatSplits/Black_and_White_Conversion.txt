Look at the original picture and do black and white again. Make sure to make it as detailed as possible, and the FOS Gamers and DICE and all that is very clear on there. Everything should be clear, invisible, or do know exactly what the picture is, but only the colors of black and white used.

To achieve a highly detailed black and white image with clarity on specific elements like "FOS Gamers" and the dice, I'll use more advanced techniques such as edge detection and careful thresholding.

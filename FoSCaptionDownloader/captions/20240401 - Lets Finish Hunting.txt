[00:34:23] understand that
[00:34:24] Jupiter I don't have a problem with that
[00:34:27] so what I'll do now is I'm going to put

[01:37:58] off here and I forgot I had eggs over
[01:38:00] here my wife that made
[01:38:04] me that's all
[01:38:15] right hey you know what Stacey it's all
[01:38:17] right I've been there before when I was
[01:38:19] in the hospital and no one's around and
[01:38:22] you're being tested for something for
[01:38:24] like I was in the hospital for um over a
[01:38:26] week when I was first being diagnosed
[01:38:28] with epilepsy so I completely understand
[01:38:32] being lonely and alone because you're in
[01:38:34] there by yourself except for the nurses
[01:38:36] that come in once every like couple
[01:38:38] hours unless something's going
[01:38:41] on so it's it's nice to have uh people
[01:38:45] to hang out with it especially nowadays
[01:38:47] where we can do this I wish I had that
[01:38:49] back when I started getting diagnosed
[01:38:50] with seizures in like
[01:38:52] 2003 that that would be awesome that
[01:38:54] would have been
[01:38:57] wonderful all
[01:38:59] right nice nice all right you got a
[01:39:03] nurse got your own nurse that's always
[01:39:04] nice we like uh my wife's a nurse so I
[01:39:08] luckily have my own wife and as a nurse
[01:39:10] too
[01:39:13] here you know what what we're gonna do I
[01:39:15] got a question for you gentlemen and
[01:39:17] ladies and N hanging out here my um my M
[01:39:21] my wife said that when we do um some of
[01:39:24] our things she thinks that we should
[01:39:26] start auctioning
[01:39:28] off um some of our art cards that the
[01:39:31] children have made do you think it's a
[01:39:33] good idea to auction off the kids art
[01:39:35] art cards while we're doing stuff like
[01:39:37] say we're in the middle of doing opening
[01:39:39] a pack we'll put an R card up as an opt
[01:39:42] auction for um for this if you want any
[01:39:45] of them and you guys can like buy them
[01:39:46] and I'll Give All Them obviously the
[01:39:47] money will go to the kids so you get
[01:39:49] they pay a dollar to for it we'll send
[01:39:50] it to the kids type thing is that
[01:39:52] something you'd be interested in I don't
[01:39:54] know I feel weird about doing that but
[01:39:56] they're like can we put them up for an
[01:39:57] auction can we do that to see if
[01:39:59] somebody will buy him and I was like all
[01:40:00] right I'll ask I'll ask and see what
[01:40:02] people say but I don't know let me know
[01:40:05] what you think about that one that was
[01:40:06] an interesting co question by the
[01:40:08] children and I was like you know what
[01:40:09] I'll I'll ask and see what people say
[01:40:13] there yeah all right we can do that I'll
[01:40:15] put it up there we'll do that then all
[01:40:17] right we have our our our um remember

[01:41:12] went to high hemoglobin levels at four I
[01:41:14] actually they said if I had fallen

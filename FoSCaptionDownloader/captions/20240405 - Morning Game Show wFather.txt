[00:31:17] going to be fun because it's definitely
[00:31:19] going to be bringing me back to my
[00:31:20] childhood a little bit sorry I had to
[00:31:22] fix set up my trash can this what I mean
[00:31:24] I took stuff out my kids were around and

[00:31:40] token token you're playing the uh the
[00:31:42] pogman battle is this all right it's a
[00:31:44] it's a slim down version of the
[00:31:46] adventure game all right so instead of
[00:31:48] going through the adventure what we do
[00:31:50] here is you have
[00:31:53] two we do we call two slams here I get I
[00:31:56] get a chance of doing for you we try to
[00:31:58] get seven strength for you which is
[00:32:01] seven of the pogs that get flipped over
[00:32:03] because those are the bosses that you go
[00:32:04] up against the same ones as before and
[00:32:07] the highest strength you can have is uh
[00:32:09] is seven there so what we do is I put
[00:32:12] these right here so your packs are out
[00:32:14] of the way I put our bosses right over
[00:32:16] here and I try to do this here to see if
[00:32:18] I can get seven seven to go over we want
[00:32:21] seven so that we can win here you get we
[00:32:23] get you a win here and I'm going to put

[00:32:37] you all right we got one two three so
[00:32:40] far we got three strength see this is
[00:32:43] what I mean somebody told me I needed a
[00:32:44] a metal one that way I get seven every
[00:32:46] time all right I got three strength for
[00:32:48] you starting right now we got one more

[00:32:53] than enough to hit seven
[00:32:55] Perfecto 1 2 3 4 four five six seven on

[00:33:02] potential of getting a $1 loot pack drop

[00:33:07] seven strength and you can
[00:33:09] beat

[01:15:22] this is the best price I could get for
[01:15:24] you guys I don't know if you're going to
[01:15:26] be happy with it but
[01:15:28] hey if you don't take this box and use
[01:15:30] it I will open it myself is really what
[01:15:32] that points down to because I like
[01:15:34] Fallout and I was okay with having that
[01:15:36] at that price myself but I don't know if
[01:15:38] it was going to sell so that was the
[01:15:40] problem I didn't know if it was going to
[01:15:41] sell let's see what
[01:15:44] happens let's put that out here and
[01:15:47] we'll do a we'll do an
[01:15:50] adventure box is really cool and it
[01:15:53] sucks that they didn't have enough of

[01:16:34] to be the problem there I know it was a

[01:16:38] expensive so I'm going to put those over

[01:33:26] out and then we're going to do a uh
[01:33:29] let's do
[01:33:34] a let's do a $1 Loot drop actually let's
[01:33:37] do one of those type of things I like
[01:33:38] that
[01:33:40] idea let's start this we've been in the
[01:33:44] Wasteland for a little while we haven't
[01:33:46] had many loot
[01:33:47] drops so let's do that let's put a Loot
[01:33:51] drop out here for right now
[01:33:54] this starts at a dollar it does not do
[01:33:56] sudden death and for those of you that
[01:33:58] want it jump in on it I'm going to

[01:34:16] times that's what ends up happening as I
[01:34:18] end up giving the things away but that's
[01:34:21] okay because it's kind of like a little

[02:09:38] left for whoever wants to try that POG
[02:09:41] flip it is in the buy now and these are
[02:09:44] all the ones that were taken already we

[02:10:23] going to be a detective wandering
[02:10:25] through the Wasteland you are looking
[02:10:27] for a treasure to help you because
[02:10:30] treasure is something that you can use
[02:10:32] to trade and gather information with so
[02:10:35] as you go through this Wasteland you
[02:10:38] find food you go oh look at this food
[02:10:41] cooking you go over you grab that food
[02:10:44] you start munching away num n num num
[02:10:46] num oh no you got some rad poising now
[02:10:49] you're not feeling so good you are now
[02:10:51] down from five to four strength because
[02:10:54] you have rad poisoning wandering through
[02:10:55] the Wasteland you didn't realize that
[02:10:57] that food was poison was had RADS in it
[02:11:00] he thought it was being cooked it must
[02:11:01] have been okay but it must have been a
[02:11:02] mutant cooking that food not a normal
[02:11:04] human all right here we go why do
[02:11:07] mutants cook food they eat it raw
[02:11:09] anyways let's see what happens here
[02:11:12] let's see what we get oh there's two
[02:11:14] there's two all right we're going to go
[02:11:15] that one let's see my
[02:11:17] friend we have a mutant that it's okay
[02:11:21] as a detective a mutant is helpful
[02:11:23] because they talk to a mutant so your
[02:11:27] friend comes wandering over the mutant
[02:11:28] goes hey buddy come here come here hey I
[02:11:30] saw that you just had some strength
[02:11:32] taken away with your with your RADS but
[02:11:35] I'm a mutant I can help absorb some of
[02:11:36] that RADS he gives you some stuff some
[02:11:39] of his slime you I know it's kind of
[02:11:41] gross but you rub that on you and your
[02:11:43] RADS start disappearing wonderful
[02:11:45] wonderful nice and safe here now now I'm
[02:11:49] going to put up another giveaway that
[02:11:50] way we can uh have some fun too this is
[02:11:53] a Nolan signed
[02:11:55] one there we go Nolan signed giveaway
[02:11:58] all right here we
[02:12:00] go you like my
[02:12:03] story wander through the Wasteland here
[02:12:06] and you you're finding another thing and
[02:12:07] you see oh look at that in the distance
[02:12:09] I think that's a friend I don't know
[02:12:12] could it be is it a friend or an enemy
[02:12:15] we shall find out because as you get
[02:12:17] closer to it you see it is a fungus
[02:12:19] dinosaur that comes around the Corner
[02:12:22] that is not a friend that fungus
[02:12:24] dinosaur comes around the corner scares
[02:12:26] your mutant away and you don't get
[02:12:28] enough of the Slime to get your RADS
[02:12:30] away so you still have some RADS going
[02:12:33] around with only four strength as you
[02:12:35] wander through this Wasteland but you
[02:12:37] know what that is okay because with four
[02:12:40] strength you have the chance to beat
[02:12:43] three of the 10 bosses now when you had
[02:12:47] that chance to beat three of the 10
[02:12:49] bosses this is our bosses we have here

[03:45:16] all of our you get a Pog there's a
[03:45:19] number written on one of the pogs we put
[03:45:20] it in one of our bags we shake it up or
[03:45:22] I shake it up in here kind of thing and
[03:45:24] then I pull out a number and that's the
[03:45:27] number you
[03:45:28] get and that's what you get for your uh
[03:45:30] out of the back over there which is the
[03:45:33] Big Blue Book which is right up

[03:45:42] book I'm going to get that out again so
[03:45:44] I can show
[03:45:47] it that way I can show what is in it all
[03:45:50] right here we go we're going to show
[03:45:52] what's in
[03:45:55] it this is what we got in this book all
[03:45:58] right normally you can see what the
[03:46:00] average is that ceiling is 100 Floor is
[03:46:03] 22 price per pole is about 27 which is
[03:46:06] normally what I did but we have a you
[03:46:09] see Force negation left and you have all
[03:46:11] these that are there with a uh you know
[03:46:13] you get set you cut packs with them see
[03:46:15] this is our floor A Wasteland is a floor
[03:46:18] here so you got those actually Wasteland
[03:46:21] has gone up it's probably not even a
[03:46:22] floor
[03:46:23] anymore so you get all these with packs
[03:46:26] on them associated with
[03:46:29] them if you don't get a big hit there
[03:46:32] and then you have balin's tomb is our
[03:46:34] big hit or maybe you want that Temple
[03:46:38] Garden then we have our there's a even a
[03:46:42] Tom
[03:46:43] Bombadil uh
[03:46:48] poster in there got a temple Garden I
[03:46:51] mean like you get a trome with a pack
[03:46:53] too I mean like that's what happens with
[03:46:55] the big blue book here it's a good uh
[03:46:58] good one there if you guys want to jump
[03:47:00] in on it that is g to put that back over
[03:47:03] there with the rest of our
[03:47:09] stuff
[03:47:10] so it is slowing down this is generally
[03:47:13] everybody's in work or getting up and
[03:47:15] getting out and doing some things so
[03:47:16] what I think I'm going to do here is I
[03:47:18] know everybody's probably going over
[03:47:20] trying to get some Thunder
[03:47:22] Junction so what I think I might do now
[03:47:26] do you guys want to do anything one of
[03:47:28] the games anything special we do oh
[03:47:31] maybe we
[03:47:33] do I know what we
[03:47:36] do I know what we do we do
[03:47:43] this
[03:47:48] this is what we
[03:47:51] do this is what we do those are all
[03:47:53] those
[03:47:55] ones we go and see these these ones
[03:47:58] these what I'm looking
[03:48:08] for those are the ones I'm looking
[03:48:10] for those are the ones I'm looking for
[03:48:13] there we go
[03:48:21] that's what we'll do
[03:48:24] here we'll play some high
[03:48:30] low let's play some high
[03:48:35] low that's what I think we'll do
[03:48:43] now
[03:48:48] look at that one we're going to play
[03:48:50] some high low so high low the way we do
[03:48:53] that
[03:48:54] here
[03:48:57] is on the back of the singles
[03:49:03] here you get any one of these singles
[03:49:06] for a
[03:49:10] dollar all right what happens is on the
[03:49:13] back of it it has high or low written on
[03:49:17] it all right whichever one has low
[03:49:20] whichever you pick whether high or low
[03:49:22] on the three cards and then what happens
[03:49:25] is
[03:49:28] you get your choice so you you're want
[03:49:30] to put these up for a dollar and I'm
[03:49:32] going to zoom in so you can see them a
[03:49:33] little bit
[03:49:36] better got three Fallout cards up here
[03:49:39] for a dollar all right $1 for each of
[03:49:43] these so you can pick one of them them
[03:49:45] and then afterwards what you do come on
[03:49:49] stay afterwards what you do is on the
[03:49:51] back of them it says high or low what
[03:49:54] happens is if you get them right you
[03:49:55] always are going to get at least one
[03:49:56] roll but you could potentially get three
[03:49:59] up to six strength and then you go
[03:50:00] against a boss to see if you get a uh
[03:50:04] Loot drop for the Wasteland if you don't
[03:50:06] if you do we do a $1 Loot drop if you
[03:50:09] don't you still get your pack of cards
[03:50:11] there saying thank you for playing so
[03:50:14] we're going to do
[03:50:17] our high low here going to start this at
[03:50:20] a dollar we're going to see what you
[03:50:24] think you jump in you want any of these
[03:50:26] cards we have
[03:50:30] a treasure
[03:50:32] Vault move him a little
[03:50:36] closer Paladin Elizabeth tager extended
[03:50:38] art treasure Vault extended art and a
[03:50:40] motherload
[03:50:43] excavator motherload excavator all each
[03:50:47] of these a dollar and then on the back
[03:50:48] you do the high low we decide we see
[03:50:50] what happens there if you want any of
[03:50:52] them that
[03:50:53] is all righty we'll put those ones
[03:50:57] back no one one of
[03:51:00] those I think uh I was going on a little
[03:51:02] bit of a slow side here I'm wondering if
[03:51:04] people are looking for different stuff
[03:51:05] so let's check a different one let's
[03:51:09] do we can put that
[03:51:12] out put that out
[03:51:16] we can put that out there we go we'll do
[03:51:18] these ones
[03:51:20] instead same thing high
[03:51:25] low and if you get the high if you get
[03:51:27] the
[03:51:28] roll you end up coming out with if you
[03:51:30] get the high or you pick it with
[03:51:32] whatever it says on the back you end up
[03:51:34] coming out with uh however many rolls
[03:51:37] and those rolls will go towards the boss
[03:51:39] battle for your strength and you take
[03:51:41] the highest strength out of them out of
[03:51:43] all of them
[03:51:52] so what we have here is a deep root
[03:51:57] pilgrimage Serene
[03:52:01] sleuth and a serin Seeker all
[03:52:06] right you get one of these but then we
[03:52:08] play the high roll and we roll the
[03:52:11] dice who wants to try their luck on it
[03:52:13] for a little bit of fun this
[03:52:19] morning see if you are going to get a
[03:52:22] pack and The Loot drop for
[03:52:27] everyone just checking my
[03:52:32] La somebody supposed to come in more
[03:52:34] lawn they didn't come because they said
[03:52:35] we didn't pay and then they realize oh
[03:52:37] [ __ ] we made a mistake you did
[03:52:38] pay all the pogs are not gone no we
[03:52:42] still got pogs we were just doing a
[03:52:43] little bit of a different game that's
[03:52:45] all that's all no one wants to do the
[03:52:48] high low game though so I will put it
[03:52:51] back maybe it's the cards maybe it's the
[03:52:53] cards so we'll put that back no one
[03:52:56] wants to do that let's try this
[03:52:59] again you want some all right all right
[03:53:02] we can do another
[03:53:04] one let's do this let's do
[03:53:12] um the POG flip has re started do you
[03:53:15] want to do the you want to try the POG
[03:53:17] flip let's try the POG flip it restarted
[03:53:21] because we had somebody get the ceiling
[03:53:23] so we restarted it all right let's do
[03:53:26] that I'll put the POG flip out here
[03:53:29] that's what I'm going to do you always
[03:53:30] get a Pog with the POG
[03:53:32] clip let's see if uh you're going to get
[03:53:35] luck here to find the one with the
[03:53:38] ceiling or if you're going to find the
[03:53:39] one with the Homeland booster or the

[00:14:07] know it is different art all right I
[00:14:10] didn't know if it was different art on

[00:14:16] mean I could be wrong and I'm just being
[00:14:20] silly okay

[00:14:52] one two three four five six seven eight
[00:14:55] one of the boats that we've seen
[00:14:56] recently we'll be able to move into soon
[00:14:59] without having somebody uh say oh no
[00:15:01] we're taking it off the market or or um
[00:15:04] sell it while you're on the airplane
[00:15:05] going to see it when you put the offer
[00:15:07] and they said that it was whatever cash
[00:15:10] grab nice pick up let's start out let's
[00:15:13] here with some good pickups my friend
[00:15:14] conduit electricity moonrise cleric
[00:15:17] sunshower Druid scales of shale sonar

[00:15:41] foil and then your art token there your
[00:15:43] art
[00:15:45] card yeah me too not I mean we're we're
[00:15:48] uh the moving out is not too bad um
[00:15:50] we've been trying to find the last
[00:15:51] couple boats that we went to though
[00:15:53] didn't go smoothly one two1 put in
[00:15:55] offers and on um the um the last one
[00:15:59] which actually we liked a lot which
[00:16:00] happened to just be it was a monoh Hol
[00:16:02] sailboat we were um going to see that
[00:16:05] like uh last minute and put an offer in
[00:16:08] and that one actually ended up being
[00:16:10] taken off the market my wife after
[00:16:13] talking to her about it I'm like seems
[00:16:15] similar to like um like the guy had like
[00:16:18] his ex-wife involved and she got ticked
[00:16:21] off did not want to have the boat sold
[00:16:25] because he took it off the market
[00:16:26] instead of selling it is what she seems
[00:16:29] to think she goes I I'm like I don't
[00:16:30] know goes I don't know somebody with
[00:16:32] feelings got involved though like I will
[00:16:34] agree with that somebody with feelings I
[00:16:35] think did get
[00:16:40] involved because they the uh I guess
[00:16:42] they called the person and he said yes
[00:16:44] for uh the for selling it and then
[00:16:47] randomly they didn't answer no answer no
[00:16:49] answer no answer and then it was oh um
[00:16:52] no longer selling it like oh all right
[00:16:56] cool yeah probably best didn't work out
[00:16:58] is what I've been always told that means
[00:17:00] it didn't mean to happen or whatever it
[00:17:02] is you know that wasn't meant to happen
[00:17:03] that type of thing so if it that was
[00:17:05] meant to happen it was it wasn't meant
[00:17:06] to happen it wasn't at this one it
[00:17:08] seemed like it wasn't meant to happen so
[00:17:10] for whatever reason it didn't and that's
[00:17:12] up not a problem at all but that means
[00:17:14] there was actually I ended up going back
[00:17:16] and kind of going to my old way of
[00:17:17] thinking because see we were looking our
[00:17:20] um the broker that we had talked to had
[00:17:23] talked us out
[00:17:26] of looking at some of the charter boats
[00:17:29] because you're like oh we'll look at
[00:17:30] those because I'm not going to buy a
[00:17:31] brand new one right now because I was
[00:17:33] going to buy
[00:17:35] um
[00:17:38] shoot I was going to buy a brand new one
[00:17:40] right now because I didn't want to have
[00:17:43] uh I didn't want to spend all our money
[00:17:45] on a brand new one that I didn't want I
[00:17:46] wanted to wait for the full payout from
[00:17:49] the company that I work
[00:17:51] for first so what I
[00:17:54] um did was we just were using some stuff
[00:17:57] to buy like a used one
[00:17:59] by looking at them um a lot of them I
[00:18:02] was like why don't we just get a charter
[00:18:03] one we can get them we know it's going
[00:18:05] to be taken care of because they have to
[00:18:07] have certain regulations depending on
[00:18:08] the charter company we're going to
[00:18:09] because to make sure the boat is safe
[00:18:11] for the states and countries that they

[00:51:47] is if you jump in the link tree that we
[00:51:49] have trying to build like in way like a
[00:51:51] virtual game store because everybody

[00:51:54] to do everything
[00:51:57] yeah those are pretty good ones we've
[00:51:59] had some pretty good polls
[00:52:01] recently yep not too bad we've had some
[00:52:03] decent ones on on uh if you check some
[00:52:05] of those shorts out we've been putting
[00:52:06] those out there been doing pretty good

[00:52:20] normal stuff that we don't have our our
[00:52:22] our great supply of everything because
[00:52:25] you know I don't have the store f set up
[00:52:27] it's a it's a short version of it
[00:52:28] because we are heading out luckily I was
[00:52:30] able to carry a lot of packs I bought
[00:52:32] this baby here that helps us
[00:52:35] uh store them all
[00:52:39] easier which is
[00:52:42] nice I was debating on getting him and I
[00:52:44] was like you know what I'm moveing

[00:53:06] too so maybe one of these days that we
[00:53:08] can maybe I highly doubt she's gonna do
[00:53:10] it but maybe we can get the wives to
[00:53:12] play a game since then since they're all
[00:53:14] new to it and that way that way we don't
[00:53:16] have to have uh they won't get pissed at
[00:53:18] us they can get pissed at each
[00:53:22] other she says that doesn't sound like a
[00:53:24] good idea
[00:53:29] yeah the mermaids deck Frank we know
[00:53:31] it's Mero Frank us all I we called it
[00:53:33] the mermaids deck because my wife likes

[00:53:39] but that and the
[00:53:44] fairies how's it going shell
[00:53:51] Hunter that's not a bad idea for for a
[00:53:54] uh for a uh

[01:26:48] that going again here God's blessed
[01:26:52] you gazuntite
[01:26:58] we got that because you used to you know
[01:27:00] everybody anybody know where that saying
[01:27:02] came from and the reason why people say
[01:27:04] God bless you or uh gazuntite which is
[01:27:07] just German for God bless you I don't
[01:27:09] know if anybody knows that I know random
[01:27:11] crap that's why I
[01:27:13] ask I'm one of those people that knows
[01:27:15] like a bunch of random junk
[01:27:26] yes yeah all season allergies do suck
[01:27:29] yep so for those that don't know uh it
[01:27:34] came from pretty much every time you
[01:27:36] sneeze back in the back in the day I
[01:27:38] don't know how far back medieval times I
[01:27:40] think it was whenever you sneezed they
[01:27:42] thought your soul was leaving your body
[01:27:44] so they said God bless you so that
[01:27:46] you're there you go escape your soul
[01:27:48] bless you so you put your soul back in
[01:27:50] there you go kid K's got it I think it
[01:27:52] was during medieval times that this
[01:27:54] started happening because whenever you
[01:27:56] sneezed they thought your soul was
[01:27:57] escaping and you needed to have somebody
[01:27:59] say God bless you to keep it have it
[01:28:01] come
[01:28:07] back ah okay Middle Ages thank you thank
[01:28:13] you oh Dwayne I like that no one said it

[01:35:11] to find a boat because the ones that we
[01:35:13] looked at we get had two issues with
[01:35:15] well not issues one when we were in the
[01:35:17] middle of the air somebody sold one of
[01:35:18] them to somebody that and then uh when
[01:35:21] we had an offer in they told us you know
[01:35:22] come look at it whatever and then the
[01:35:24] other one they took off the market my
[01:35:26] wife seemed to think that could have
[01:35:27] been a uh my wife and I seem to think
[01:35:28] that an ex might have got involved or
[01:35:30] something at that point weaker you got a
[01:35:32] banishing light all right not a big hit
[01:35:33] weaker but it get you discount on
[01:35:36] shipping can you give me a number for
[01:35:39] um give away
[01:35:49] weaker yeah yeah
[01:35:54] I'm not really sad about a
[01:35:56] house maybe other people might be but
[01:35:59] I'm a weird person where it's like
[01:36:00] that's a the house is not the home it's
[01:36:02] the people in the where you
[01:36:04] are love every bud have a good day at
[01:36:11] school we just need to kind of finish
[01:36:13] packing up my office and some of the
[01:36:14] little odds and ends around the house to
[01:36:16] move
[01:36:18] over and to the to our storage facility
[01:36:22] stuff like that see I'm weird like I I'm
[01:36:24] like I don't I've never got tied to
[01:36:26] stuff but it might have been the fact
[01:36:28] that like I grew up one I mean like I
[01:36:30] I've said it before like we GRE up one
[01:36:31] of the first Places I Remember living I
[01:36:33] didn't realize it was our first house
[01:36:35] that we were I was living in was a
[01:36:36] trailer we were homeless at one point
[01:36:37] when I was young and then we started
[01:36:39] live then we had a trailer for about a
[01:36:40] year and we got an apart small apartment
[01:36:43] then we had a small rental house then we
[01:36:46] had like a a rental house that was
[01:36:48] bigger that we tried to buy that we
[01:36:50] couldn't then we bought a house and then
[01:36:52] my life happened another so Jump On
[01:36:55] In to the chaos break that's there so
[01:37:00] I'm not like tied to
[01:37:01] locations more tied to people 900 nice
[01:37:06] good morning Jack JQ
[01:37:09] Jack but those are those are some of the
[01:37:12] sorcery runs right
[01:37:14] there what do we have here so yeah I'm
[01:37:17] weird like that where I don't feel tied
[01:37:19] to a location um it's more the people
[01:37:24] but that's me personally not everybody's
[01:37:26] the same way you know some people are a
[01:37:28] little different they they get tied to
[01:37:30] the house they think the house is the or
[01:37:32] the location is something special uh and
[01:37:35] that's their you know that's their
[01:37:36] opinion on how things are I'm not saying
[01:37:38] that's wrong it's just not
[01:37:41] me yes home is where the heart
[01:37:44] is home is the people not the place
[01:37:46] exactly no matter where you are you can
[01:37:48] always have your home as long as your
[01:37:50] people are there you know yep that's
[01:37:52] kind of how I feel I agree with
[01:37:55] that it's part of the reason why we're
[01:37:56] doing what we are we figured we'll go
[01:37:58] for a little travel hanging out and
[01:38:00] everybody as you can see over here you
[01:38:01] can uh you see what we have available
[01:38:02] for packs now got a nice little uh
[01:38:06] display there for you guys if you have
[01:38:07] any questions I can even make that
[01:38:09] bigger so you can see what we have if
[01:38:11] you guys want anything so say maybe
[01:38:12] you're like hey you know what I can't

[01:38:26] back down put it back in the corner
[01:38:29] where it was I'll make it a little bit
[01:38:31] bigger

[01:38:36] good there we
[01:38:39] go that seems good
[01:38:44] there yeah that's what we have available
[01:38:46] for some of our stuff that's what we

[01:39:42] someone else after with our offer even
[01:39:44] there then the the other one was a I
[01:39:48] think my wife seems to think maybe an ex
[01:39:49] or or a wife got involved because
[01:39:51] feelings were involved because like the
[01:39:53] person that was like yeah we're going to
[01:39:54] sell the boat to you guys and then like
[01:39:57] no one heard anything for 3
[01:40:00] days and and then they said they
[01:40:03] straight up took it off the market so
[01:40:04] we're guessing that's what she seems to
[01:40:06] think I don't know we'll see I kind of
[01:40:08] agree with her on that one because I was
[01:40:10] like feelings got involved
[01:40:11] somehow was my only thought
[01:40:14] process but we'll see here one of these
[01:40:18] days I'm going to have a couple of fun
[01:40:20] things we'll have going on new we have
[01:40:23] get some closed boxes and things like
[01:40:24] that but I don't know where I put

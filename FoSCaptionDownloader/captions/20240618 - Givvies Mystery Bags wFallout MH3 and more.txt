[00:17:59] Rising populace blood juggler burglar
[00:18:03] rat Act of treason cocora kocur I always
[00:18:08] like that card I had a hard time seeing

[00:18:36] there did not hit a shock I'm sorry but
[00:18:39] we did get you some nice playing cards
[00:18:41] let me get your name written down and
[00:18:43] all right so you have an engineering
[00:18:45] booster you said you're gonna be a uh
[00:18:49] get all I want to put it here I can see
[00:18:51] buyers there we go going to be that
[00:18:54] Scout here wandering through the
[00:18:56] Wasteland now let's see what happens as
[00:18:58] you wander through the land as a
[00:19:00] scout all
[00:19:05] righty write your name
[00:19:09] down now after after reading your name I
[00:19:12] understand why your name is Frank Chile
[00:19:14] now and I also like chili also too
[00:19:18] so every time I see it I think I'm like
[00:19:20] we should have chili for
[00:19:21] dinner
[00:19:26] anyways that's how my thought process
[00:19:28] goes when I read what you have there got
[00:19:30] some nice
[00:19:32] cards
[00:19:33] and this is what we're going to do now
[00:19:37] all right we had it pop up and this is
[00:19:39] what we had show up and this I don't
[00:19:41] like how they show up that quickly but
[00:19:43] it was a mediumsized Raider that came
[00:19:44] out to you this is not good you happen
[00:19:47] to be wandering through this Wasteland
[00:19:48] and right in front of you as you wander
[00:19:50] out of your camp for some reason he must
[00:19:52] have been stalking your Camp not sure
[00:19:54] what's going on here must have been
[00:19:56] stalking the camp now with that being
[00:19:58] said you have an engineering booster
[00:20:02] would you like to use that with your
[00:20:03] agile Scout and see what happens and
[00:20:06] attack them or would you like to flee as
[00:20:09] that agile Scout because you know you
[00:20:10] could probably hide and get away from
[00:20:12] them you are pretty agile you
[00:20:17] know yeah Chile hasn't cold I know took
[00:20:20] me that for a little
[00:20:23] bit use it all right we use that
[00:20:26] engineering booster gives you a little
[00:20:28] bit of there for your uh kind of like
[00:20:30] agility type stuff maybe aim a little
[00:20:33] bit better type thing so what are you
[00:20:34] going to do
[00:20:36] now all right our giveaway winner is

[00:21:03] Squiggy yes aha you did it oh starting
[00:21:07] the morning out with a Benji already
[00:21:09] look at that
[00:21:12] oh now the Benji for those of you that
[00:21:15] don't know what they are pretty much
[00:21:16] it's a a Back to the Future pack now
[00:21:19] pick one of these four my
[00:21:21] friend one two three or
[00:21:24] four that's what's going to be going up
[00:21:26] as our givy next
[00:21:29] these are like Back to the Future packs
[00:21:31] they're anything from
[00:21:33] 1986 I believe is our packs the furthest
[00:21:36] back all the way up to like uh 2016 I
[00:21:39] think is the newest ones all right so
[00:21:42] youve
[00:21:43] attack oh look at that that's a nice hit
[00:21:47] you H that Medium siiz Rader directly in
[00:21:48] the chest with your arrow causing 12
[00:21:50] damage but they're so angry and they do
[00:21:52] have some armor if they aren't that they
[00:21:55] they they don't have that much damage
[00:21:57] because it only goes that 12 brings them
[00:21:59] from 60 down to 48 so they still got a
[00:22:02] lot of Health here now they swing their
[00:22:04] axe at you and they do a lot of damage
[00:22:06] for some reason I don't know why they
[00:22:07] hit you with 24 damage with that axe I'm
[00:22:09] guessing you really piss them off when
[00:22:11] you hit them with that that uh bow arrow
[00:22:13] in their chest probably just looking at
[00:22:15] going like seriously got like metal on
[00:22:18] what
[00:22:20] the so now what are you going to do my
[00:22:24] friend you there you've got a nice slash
[00:22:27] on your arm from where you're hit hit
[00:22:28] you with your axe he's got a little bow
[00:22:30] he's got his Arrow stuck in his chest
[00:22:32] what do you want to do my friend and let
[00:22:34] me run our
[00:22:41] giveaway yeah they're really crazy packs
[00:22:44] I know that one from the other day I I
[00:22:45] can't believe that one you attack we try
[00:22:48] it
[00:22:49] again and you attack that no the agile
[00:22:55] Scout attacks a mediumsized Raider
[00:23:00] and oh look at that it's a hit
[00:23:03] again but this time it's only seven
[00:23:05] damage from you to the Rader oh not too
[00:23:08] much but oh another big hit from the
[00:23:10] Raider I think oh it's a 12 hit from the
[00:23:13] Raider it's not a huge another 12 oh my
[00:23:16] it's not too good that mediumsized
[00:23:18] Raider I think he smells blood right now
[00:23:20] what are you gonna do my friend Frank
[00:23:22] you can attack
[00:23:24] again maybe you'll get lucky we'll find
[00:23:27] out derailed the stream for oh
[00:23:29] definitely derailed the stream for a
[00:23:30] minute oh yeah I did I got thoroughly
[00:23:32] sidetracked after seeing that
[00:23:38] one all right we're going to attack L
[00:23:40] see what happens we attack
[00:23:45] and all right I guess the engineering
[00:23:48] booster came into play that
[00:23:51] time and
[00:23:54] 27 he's scared now he's scared now he's
[00:23:57] turning to flee as he turns to
[00:24:01] flee he
[00:24:04] drops on rope for you cuz whenever you
[00:24:06] play as one of our our characters you
[00:24:09] get one of these we give you one of the
[00:24:10] benjes
[00:24:11] also oh no I didn't refill them
[00:24:14] sh anyways you Frank have got one
[00:24:18] yourself what are you going to do this
[00:24:20] what weapons does Scout have he only has
[00:24:21] a bow and arrow right now it's all the
[00:24:23] bow and arrow right now because they're
[00:24:24] a scout it is a new addition I have to
[00:24:27] get rid of them pretty much I realized I
[00:24:29] had a bunch of these extra packs over
[00:24:31] here a lot more than I was expecting
[00:24:33] that I had when I started counting
[00:24:34] something that I put off to the side and
[00:24:35] I'm like oh [ __ ] I'm gonna get rid of a
[00:24:37] bunch of them so I'm gonna be able to
[00:24:39] get them whenever we do whenever we play
[00:24:41] a game
[00:24:42] now like I was looking at him like oh I
[00:24:45] gotta get rid of those that's more than
[00:24:47] I was expecting that I had so Frank G
[00:24:50] let you pick one one of the three
[00:24:56] here attack with runs away his back is
[00:24:59] facing ooh I don't know that didn't have
[00:25:02] an option there in the game uh oh hold
[00:25:03] on a second let me see if I
[00:25:06] can y we're gonna try this anyways we're
[00:25:08] gonna do it without using
[00:25:10] it you take that bow you shoot that bow
[00:25:14] towards that mediumsized Raider in the
[00:25:16] back and I say with that engineering
[00:25:19] booster you have nice direct tape you
[00:25:21] only had seven damage left on him gets
[00:25:24] hitting that back and Oh my he falls
[00:25:26] over to the ground and as he falls over
[00:25:29] the ground not
[00:25:30] only do you get one of these you gonna
[00:25:34] take the first one Frank also does you

[00:33:50] and playing still the way I was going to
[00:33:52] do it was since kind of I was thinking I
[00:33:54] was going to have the giveaway winners
[00:33:56] prob participate
[00:33:58] since
[00:33:59] uh kelpy guy you like the kelpy guy who
[00:34:02] created sorcery it is um I know it's
[00:34:05] contested Realms but I can't remember
[00:34:06] the name of the first person it's uh
[00:34:09] Eric I can't remember his last name
[00:34:13] though it's
[00:34:15] Eric curiosa curiosa I don't know if I'm
[00:34:17] saying that right I always it's pretty
[00:34:20] fun game so
[00:34:24] far all righty so what I do here for
[00:34:28] instance is this let's say you're the
[00:34:30] Scout we'll do this right now we're
[00:34:32] going to do YSI we'll do YSI again I'm
[00:34:34] gonna have Frank type yatsi for
[00:34:45] me that's our uh our leftover pack there
[00:34:49] that no one wanted to get so far it's
[00:34:51] just kind of sitting there but if you're
[00:34:53] not in here Frank I'll have somebody
[00:34:54] else type Yi
[00:35:04] so what I'm going to do here yeah must
[00:35:06] not be any he has to go on and out of
[00:35:07] work at times like you know everybody
[00:35:09] does so Oblivion you type yai this
[00:35:15] time all right number 19 so say for
[00:35:19] instance Frank was in here and listening
[00:35:21] maybe he'll hear me you would have
[00:35:23] gotten say we could have gotten number
[00:35:24] 19 say some purchased this box when I
[00:35:26] put it out for a discount there 1 2 3 4
[00:35:29] 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
[00:35:35] they would have got number 19 there with
[00:35:37] number 19 it would have been a modern
[00:35:39] Horizon 3 play booster and they would
[00:35:41] have gotten an agility booster now in
[00:35:44] each one of these oh Frank was
[00:35:47] here here oh you rolled
[00:35:49] 24 so we'll do this we'll do 1 2 3 4 5 6
[00:35:54] 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
[00:36:00] 21 22 23 holy crap 24 say this would
[00:36:03] have been it it would have been a
[00:36:05] sorcery pack with an engineering booster
[00:36:07] is what Frank would have gotten pulled
[00:36:08] out there all right see that's what
[00:36:11] Frank pulled out was that an engineering
[00:36:13] booster but maybe you were lucky enough
[00:36:15] where you did pull out a pack maybe say
[00:36:17] maybe somebody did get one where it was
[00:36:19] a medium health pack right there in that
[00:36:21] modern Horizon 2 so my point is they're
[00:36:24] in there but they were in the boxes
[00:36:26] that's kind of how I had built the boxes
[00:36:27] up kind of be like a game where you you
[00:36:28] know you beat a character loot is
[00:36:30] dropped or you're wandering through the
[00:36:31] Wasteland and you find a loot box and
[00:36:33] you're able to pick up loot type of
[00:36:35] thing but you got another engineering
[00:36:37] booster since you had an engineering
[00:36:38] booster last time I'm gonna allow you to
[00:36:41] do
[00:36:45] either the agility one or the
[00:36:48] engineering booster because I picked out
[00:36:49] the engineering
[00:36:52] one oh I know it's an AI B it was an AI
[00:36:57] gener an image and I just let it go
[00:36:58] after that because I thought it was
[00:36:59] funny because I was thinking giggity
[00:37:02] giggity
[00:37:03] giggity I don't know why I was laugh
[00:37:06] when I read it the first time I was like

[00:37:15] exactly Family Guy reference giggity
[00:37:18] giggity
[00:37:20] booster I couldn't help but laugh when
[00:37:22] it came out the first time and I died
[00:37:24] when I saw it I'm like that is it I'm
[00:37:26] keeping it no matter what
[00:37:32] oh I'm sorry that's that's the that was
[00:37:34] the reason why that's the reason why I

[01:06:11] these aren't graded quality because you
[01:06:13] could see how they were old and kind of
[01:06:14] stuck together but they weren't and one
[01:06:16] of them wasn't one was graded and was
[01:06:17] like perfect quality or like it was like
[01:06:19] a nine it was selling for like a hundred
[01:06:21] bucks I was like this is insane like the
[01:06:23] the Kennedy card that you got but it has
[01:06:26] to be like the graded one or
[01:06:28] whatever all right we'll put that back
[01:06:29] here no one wants those now I have this
[01:06:32] should I open this up at the end of the
[01:06:34] stream to see what I get because no one
[01:06:36] wanted to purchase this the last two
[01:06:37] streams when I asked if anybody wanted
[01:06:39] it I said this is the last pack I
[01:06:40] randomly found it I didn't even realize
[01:06:42] I had it I no one wanted it so I was
[01:06:45] like you know what all right fine I
[01:06:46] guess maybe I'll open it up
[01:06:48] myself
[01:06:52] commands yours were like probably the
[01:06:54] five to six range of the other ones
[01:06:57] there's like some of them you could see
[01:06:58] that people open packs and they were
[01:06:59] like5 to $6 oh yes all of them don't
[01:07:02] work there um you should be able to see
[01:07:04] I think it is it comes up with them it
[01:07:08] automatically pops up every three
[01:07:09] minutes with what they
[01:07:11] are slash start slash start sorry about
[01:07:15] that slash start literally to start the
[01:07:21] game yeah sell a few of them if I have
[01:07:23] anything good out of it all right we can
[01:07:24] do that at the end of stream here and
[01:07:27] we'll do that maybe in a half hour or so
[01:07:29] I'll open it up and see what we get
[01:07:32] there all right no one wanted any of
[01:07:34] those no one's wanted any of those let's
[01:07:36] do um let's do like one of the things we
[01:07:39] used to do let's throw out some or we
[01:07:42] can do some singles should we do some
[01:07:45] singles maybe we should do some singles
[01:07:47] of for

[01:07:56] ah somebody's playing a
[01:07:58] game let's throw some singles out then I
[01:08:01] think that might be a good idea we'll go
[01:08:04] through some of our singles and let's
[01:08:05] see what we have we have
[01:08:09] a corrupted Shape Shifter Actually I

[01:26:29] reason to complain about something even
[01:26:31] though I've gone through it and now I
[01:26:33] have uh some lawyers kind of going
[01:26:34] through my things to make sure I'm in
[01:26:36] within um within my rules of their game
[01:26:39] so I shouldn't have any problems anymore
[01:26:41] with the games this is the I just did
[01:26:42] this on random though that's the only
[01:26:44] reason I was worried a little bit but

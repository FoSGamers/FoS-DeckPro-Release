[00:01:48] haven't had a chance to do this yet oh
[00:01:51] it's exciting doing all right well you
[00:01:53] know what all right is better than bad I
[00:01:55] will say that we've had some rough days
[00:01:57] here and we've had some good days here
[00:01:58] and yesterday was a pretty good day we
[00:02:00] were able to go uh down to the beach
[00:02:02] with my son and uh for his birthday and
[00:02:05] had a great time so there we go all
[00:02:07] right now that was where moved around a
[00:02:08] little bit I think this is supposed to
[00:02:09] be here somewhere I don't know those are
[00:02:12] slid all over the place those aren't
[00:02:13] even even all right where do you want to
[00:02:15] go my friend you got
[00:02:19] two
[00:02:21] got dealer's Choice all right let's
[00:02:26] feel oh these two feel warm area
[00:02:31] well that one we'll go with this one
[00:02:33] here that one feels
[00:02:36] nice might
[00:02:38] be oh it's like this one here oh wow I
[00:02:41] found something really funny over there

[00:02:45] this we're going to slide these a little
[00:02:46] bit over here a little bit over there
[00:02:48] that way we can do our thing and do our
[00:02:51] little zoom zoom zoom and we can see
[00:02:54] better The Collector precons I have got
[00:02:57] I might be getting myself a couple of
[00:02:59] them personally
[00:03:00] I I I think I like the idea of it um
[00:03:02] because you kind of get all the cool
[00:03:03] things but you don't get exactly all the
[00:03:05] ones because they have different
[00:03:06] versions you know like different you
[00:03:07] know iterations of the cards so here we
[00:03:09] go zoom zoom zoom everybody say way all
[00:03:13] right we're gonna cut those babies open
[00:03:14] we're get you some good luck this

[00:03:35] friend all right here I think I'm not
[00:03:38] sure how these go so we're going to have
[00:03:39] to figure this out here oh they're going
[00:03:40] right away uh oh we're going right away
[00:03:41] with the start one two three four five
[00:03:45] six seven because that's how we like our

[00:31:21] [Music]
[00:31:32] why isn't it in
[00:31:34] there well anyways um like it depends on
[00:31:38] which one you're looking at I I can put
[00:31:39] I can I can put it out there if you're
[00:31:40] looking for one specific one I have the
[00:31:43] alrai ones up there for
[00:31:45] 108 um the other one for I think it was
[00:31:49] the tricky terrain was like
[00:31:54] 57 uh Creative Energy was on for
[00:31:59] 45 and the other grave overdrive was 45
[00:32:02] also that I had them on
[00:32:04] for so I can hey wazer dude how's it
[00:32:08] been I haven't seen you in forever not
[00:32:12] doing too bad not doing too bad doing a
[00:32:13] little better than I have been in the
[00:32:14] past but hey Buck I didn't know that I
[00:32:16] can check and I can make sure those are
[00:32:17] in there I don't know why I didn't save
[00:32:18] in
[00:32:20] right why didn't those save in right
[00:32:22] I've been I think their new version of
[00:32:24] they they switched up how you're
[00:32:25] supposed to save and do stuff I hadn't
[00:32:27] those the first ones I put in I probably
[00:32:29] didn't put them in
[00:32:30] right that's what my guess is let me see
[00:32:33] if I can find them they're not even in
[00:32:37] here they're not even in here come
[00:32:40] on I did something wrong the first time

[00:37:36] slacking mine's been calling me when I'm
[00:37:37] doing stuff to give me a hard time no
[00:37:38] matter
[00:37:40] [Laughter]
[00:37:42] what but you know what's going to happen
[00:37:44] now actually because my family is going
[00:37:48] to have our own box here of different
[00:37:51] things so I wonder if I should uh open
[00:37:54] one up here and see what we got
[00:37:58] h i thinky maybe I'll do that maybe I'll
[00:38:01] do that so I was plan on opening one
[00:38:05] ourselves should we uh try our luck on
[00:38:08] those and see how the morning goes with
[00:38:11] us the ultimate Luke's box is pretty
[00:38:13] good there ultimate loot box is pretty
[00:38:16] nice and the nice thing about oh I
[00:38:17] forgot to update the C this the
[00:38:19] screenshot I'm sorry I need to update
[00:38:22] that screenshot so I am correct on it
[00:38:24] all
[00:38:39] all right let me take a better
[00:38:40] screenshot so you guys see what exactly
[00:38:41] is in them again I made a mistake there
[00:38:44] I have it written in there but I want to
[00:38:46] make sure you can see it also I try to
[00:38:49] be a little over the top I
[00:38:56] guess you can get bundles too I know
[00:38:59] that the the ultimate one's a pretty

[00:53:37] feels um
[00:53:40] more like it's not as
[00:53:44] um feels more solid feels like a more
[00:53:47] solid card with the foiling if that
[00:53:49] makes sense it doesn't feel like
[00:53:50] sometimes with the foiling you felt you
[00:53:52] could like feel like it was like this
[00:53:53] foil on that but this one it feels like
[00:53:55] it's a good card with foil added to it
[00:53:58] if that makes sense like it doesn't put
[00:54:01] it this way they feel a little bit

[01:24:13] I'm gonna I'm gonna say something it's
[01:24:15] not meant to be mean to people but I
[01:24:18] feel like there was like a certain thing
[01:24:20] that happened during Co where everybody
[01:24:22] decided that they were either going to
[01:24:24] be lazy or they were going to work
[01:24:27] and there was more people that decided
[01:24:31] to be lazy than work during covid and
[01:24:34] that was I think the breaking point for
[01:24:36] this country was uh we had people like
[01:24:39] you know what I'm not going to do
[01:24:40] anything anymore and that's what we have
[01:24:42] now is a lot of that [ __ ] still going on
[01:24:45] and that's why I have the the [ __ ]
[01:24:47] person that comes and says oh I knocked

[01:25:07] saying like that's the [ __ ] we got to
[01:25:08] deal with now in this world and I feel
[01:25:10] like that happened after
[01:25:12] covid yes free money made people L

[01:25:19] are slow rolling into idiocracy I played

[01:27:19] person see I will do sandals I will do
[01:27:22] the Jesus sandals I will do the Birkin
[01:27:24] stocks but I not gonna do the Crocs
[01:27:28] those Crocs oh no the Croc shoes though
[01:27:31] they have a pair of shoes that are look
[01:27:32] like no the boat shoes the crock boat
[01:27:35] shoes I actually might like the crock
[01:27:37] boat shoes okay they have boat shoes
[01:27:39] that I saw recently they like those
[01:27:41] actually look like boat shoes they like
[01:27:43] and they they're they they work great
[01:27:45] for my boat because when we're on the
[01:27:46] boat and it's water it's just like oh
[01:27:47] wow that's actually not a bad
[01:27:49] idea the game we're making a game all
[01:27:52] right so the game that I I'm going is
[01:27:55] currently it's like what I have is this
[01:27:56] one that we do here normally but the way
[01:27:58] I'm building it is so that in the game
[01:28:00] um it'll be text based but it'll allow
[01:28:02] everybody to go through it and progress
[01:28:04] to the game as if it is there and then
[01:28:06] as after we have the text base thing
[01:28:07] working I'm going to add the anim uh the
[01:28:09] pictures in so that when things happen
[01:28:11] pictures will pop up for the right time
[01:28:14] and that's what we're trying I'm trying
[01:28:15] to get work in there so if people want
[01:28:16] to help out and test it I figure I'll
[01:28:18] get it out there and I'll put it on the
[01:28:20] um put it out there for you guys to test
[01:28:22] it out and then let me know how it works
[01:28:24] if you're able to find anything that
[01:28:25] breaks once I'm comfortable with the uh
[01:28:27] with the
[01:28:28] process did you do SLG yet Mitchell if
[01:28:32] not I'm gonna have somebody else type
[01:28:34] it we'll have our who was our last
[01:28:37] person that won a giveaway
[01:28:39] there yeah so yeah because pretty much
[01:28:41] the games that we do here on a regular
[01:28:43] basis I'm trying to make it so they work
[01:28:45] a little bit more efficiently GI VV 2vs
[01:28:48] sorry 2vs 2vs um trying to make it more
[01:28:52] work more efficient and then you guys
[01:28:54] actually eventually I'll take all those
[01:28:56] games and I'll put them together on my
[01:28:57] website that I'm building and you'll be
[01:28:59] able to play any of the games of the
[01:29:00] older games that we had along we'll have
[01:29:02] the new ones that we got going it's like
[01:29:06] do that my

[00:00:22] Let's watch some statistics
[00:00:24] here. Here we go. All right. This is
[00:00:27] what we're saying we've got. Let's see
[00:00:29] if it actually is accurate here. We'll
[00:00:30] put it up there again. Aha. I'm going to
[00:00:33] be a little interesting today. But
[00:00:34] that's our
[00:00:35] break. All right, this is what we got
[00:00:37] going on today. What do you guys think?
[00:00:39] Got some nice ones there. We got three
[00:00:41] spots left. Good evening, Vicas. Nice to
[00:00:43] see you come in. I appreciate it, buddy.
[00:00:45] Hopefully you're having a uh a good
[00:00:47] evening here on uh this Monday evening.
[00:00:50] We don't generally do evening ones, but
[00:00:51] we had three spots left and I wanted
[00:00:54] to Yes. No. No, it did not sell out. Um,
[00:00:58] oh, there's my drink. So, I was going to
[00:01:00] do uh tonight. Oh, he fell asleep. Yeah.
[00:01:03] Well, luckily I did it tonight here.
[00:01:05] Figured I'd start again. Uh, we got
[00:01:07] three spots that are left in there.
[00:01:10] We're going to have the you guys that
[00:01:11] were in there already for your other
[00:01:12] three and then the three spots that are
[00:01:14] left. And that's what we'll do tonight
[00:01:15] with the break.
[00:01:21] We're going to see if we can uh clear
[00:01:23] that up.
[00:01:25] And all right, so this is what we're
[00:01:28] saying we're getting today. I was doing
[00:01:30] a little thing here. We're going to test
[00:01:31] out what they say we get. Actually,
[00:01:33] let's see if we're accurate
[00:01:37] here. All right, sounds good. No
[00:01:40] problem, big. I can do that. I can do
[00:01:42] that. I was planning on doing that for
[00:01:44] the others anyways, but um yeah, sounds
[00:01:47] good. I will definitely Here's our first
[00:01:49] spot. We'll run it right here. Why not?
[00:01:52] We'll run an auction for one. Showing
[00:01:54] you the spot. There you
[00:01:57] go. You get We're going to have open
[00:01:59] this. This gets you uh one of the secret
[00:02:02] layer guaranteed because we take them
[00:02:03] all. We shuffle them up. Hand them all
[00:02:05] out to everybody in their spots. Then if
[00:02:07] there's a leftover, we put it in with
[00:02:08] any of the mythics, the rares, and any
[00:02:10] of the commons and uncommons that are $3
[00:02:12] or more out of all these packs that we
[00:02:14] open. And then we shuffle all those up
[00:02:16] and hand them out to your spot. And
[00:02:18] that's how we do our break tonight for
[00:02:19] those that have not been here before.
[00:02:21] kind of like a hit uh deal and hits
[00:02:22] thing. And then we also have uh for
[00:02:25] those that like to do try the the
[00:02:27] adventure in the wasteland every now and
[00:02:28] again and do a quick try to get
[00:02:31] something or have some fun or test it
[00:02:32] out. We run this which is a uh the
[00:02:35] singles which we have a lot of those all
[00:02:39] there with exactly which ones they
[00:02:42] are for you to get. We'll try that too.
[00:02:45] No, it's only a dollar for that but it's
[00:02:46] only a single. It could be anywhere from
[00:02:48] like I know 3 cents to what Hey Motty,
[00:02:50] how's it going? 3 cents to like $3. So I
[00:02:53] actually think five five cents was the
[00:02:55] lowest. But anyways, they're all
[00:02:57] Anistrod and um Atherdrift. So there you
[00:03:01] go for those that you want to try those
[00:03:02] out. How you doing? Uh my friend Mandy
[00:03:05] Mi Mi if I'm saying that right. Yeah,
[00:03:08] I'll try my best. I don't always do the
[00:03:10] greatest on it, but I sometimes try
[00:03:11] here. So we got a break going on. We

[00:03:16] for uh somebody to finish. We have that

[00:03:57] to the locked room, which is always
[00:04:00] nice to have because
[00:04:03] uh that means you get to go in and see
[00:04:05] if you want to either trade something or
[00:04:07] uh Oh, there's your red shift upgrade

[00:04:24] while I'm going to pin that again and
[00:04:27] uh pin that for everybody so you guys
[00:04:29] can see it. All right, Eepes, your name
[00:04:31] down on
[00:04:32] here. Hi there, everyone. Yeah. So, uh
[00:04:35] let's see. You're going to have to uh
[00:04:37] decide. Hopefully, we can have one or
[00:04:38] two more people come in. Yep. To jump in
[00:04:40] with the uh the break. that way. Uh, if
[00:04:43] we have anything that's like, uh, like
[00:04:46] generally if I have one left, I'll I'll
[00:04:48] have the store take the spot. So, we'll
[00:04:49] see what happens. Hopefully, we can get
[00:04:51] one more.
[00:04:54] What does he have available? Well, my
[00:04:57] friend here, he um, where' it go?
[00:05:03] My friend here at uh, in the locked
[00:05:05] room. Well, they have um, some weapons
[00:05:08] that they have available. Now, these are
[00:05:09] just kind of like regular uh, some
[00:05:11] weapons here. There's a plasma rifle.
[00:05:13] Here's an assault rifle. This is your
[00:05:15] weapons smmith, man. He's got a pistol.
[00:05:19] He's also got a
[00:05:20] sword. And uh that's all that he has
[00:05:23] really there for himself. But he does
[00:05:26] have ham ammo for all that too if you
[00:05:28] need any. And it's pretty much unlimited
[00:05:30] because they can uh they can get
[00:05:31] whatever they want there. It's pretty
[00:05:32] pretty crazy how much they can get. And
[00:05:34] then we're going to do uh our break here
[00:05:36] once we get this filled out here. So, if
[00:05:38] we get this, I'm going to go and I'm

[00:05:57] reading something here. Would I be able
[00:05:58] to dual wield? I don't know.

[00:06:02] right strength, maybe. Maybe you might
[00:06:04] be able to. What's up, buddy? Uh, I
[00:06:07] said, "Can you show them the original
[00:06:10] ones that you do?" I don't I um I can

[00:08:19] tattered up here. Beating. Would you
[00:08:20] possibly be able to heal me?" And that
[00:08:23] uh guy in the locker room goes, "You
[00:08:25] know what? I think I might be able to
[00:08:26] help you with that." But uh full health
[00:08:30] will be
[00:08:31] uh 30
[00:08:33] pogs. What do you think? Oh no, it went
[00:08:36] away again. The internet dropped. H So
[00:08:39] he says he thinks he can heal you, but
[00:08:41] it would be 30 pogs for full health. So
[00:08:44] you have 85 though. So you have 85 Pog,
[00:08:46] so you could do
[00:08:47] it. It's up to you. You're standing
[00:08:50] there trying to
[00:08:53] decide what you want to do. Yep. Now, if

[00:09:26] go
[00:09:27] back." Drops you down to
[00:09:30] 50 nine and goes, "All right,

[00:10:38] aliens that seem to have put a chip onto
[00:10:40] some Godzilla looking creature. You're
[00:10:43] going to help with that. And that's what
[00:10:45] the uh the break is today. Our our

[00:11:16] can uh drop some of them off with them.

[00:11:22] uh
[00:11:23] any other
[00:11:27] uh enhancements he can do for you, but
[00:11:29] at the moment it seems like uh you get
[00:11:32] some ammo. Oh, I keep going in and out.
[00:11:35] At the moment, it seems like you got
[00:11:36] some options for that. So,

[00:21:28] Thank you, my friend. I do appreciate
[00:21:30] that. Like I said, I don't know why
[00:21:32] whatnot is acting weird. You're not even
[00:21:34] live on Whatnot. Whatnot is not even
[00:21:36] loading for you. That is crazy. No,
[00:21:39] you're not live at all.
[00:21:42] That is what I'm saying. That's crazy
[00:21:43] right now. Yeah, cuz it shows me here.
[00:21:50] Stop working live. Yeah, I see you live
[00:21:52] on YouTube.
[00:21:54] Why is it showing me there? That is the
[00:21:56] weirdest thing I've ever seen. Hold
[00:21:59] on. Disconnect that.
[00:22:06] Yeah, whatever.
[00:22:09] We're now going.
[00:22:13] That is so weird that reream on whatnot
[00:22:17] is working, but the other one's not.
[00:22:26] Okay, let's do this.
[00:22:36] I wanted to make sure he was
[00:22:39] Why is it not
[00:22:41] working? That is the weirdest thing I've
[00:22:44] ever seen. Right. So everything's going
[00:22:47] through yet it's not working on
[00:22:58] that. I don't have any problems from
[00:23:00] them that I'm aware
[00:23:07] of. That's the weirdest thing in the
[00:23:09] world. I got you your packs and
[00:23:11] everything.
[00:23:12] So, I guess we'll try the break in the
[00:23:15] morning maybe cuz it's I'm working on
[00:23:17] YouTube. Whatot just is
[00:23:19] not not working.
[00:23:22] Yeah, it's like really weird. It's like
[00:23:25] my show ended.
[00:23:28] Yeah,
[00:23:32] that's what it somehow it ended the
[00:23:34] show.
[00:23:39] That is the weirdest thing ever.
[00:23:47] Oh, they don't have the feature where
[00:23:48] you go back and reook at previous shows.
[00:23:50] No, I do. I can see it right here, but
[00:23:52] they end it's the show was
[00:23:55] ended for some reason.
[00:24:00] That is the weirdest thing in the world.
[00:24:05] Oh my god. What not?
[00:24:11] Well,
[00:24:13] yeah, I can keep hanging out here. If uh
[00:24:16] anybody came over and wanted to finish
[00:24:17] from there, I guess we could try it. But
[00:24:19] damn, that sucks. Yeah, that's really
[00:24:22] odd.
[00:24:24] That's the weirdest thing ever. Yeah,
[00:24:26] they're going to fix
[00:24:27] it. That fixing restarting it. I tried
[00:24:30] to it, but they're all now the show's
[00:24:32] ended actually.
[00:24:35] That is the craziest thing ever. All
[00:24:37] right,
[00:24:38] so how do I
[00:24:44] Sorry. I try and watch to make Not your
[00:24:46] fault. I know, but I try to keep you up
[00:24:47] on a date on stuff. Well, that's so
[00:24:50] weird that they did that. Well, you were
[00:24:53] there, but I could only see you live on
[00:24:55] Yeah, I know. I don't know what they
[00:24:57] what they were doing.
[00:24:59] Let me see if it's working everywhere
[00:25:01] else. It seems like it's working
[00:25:03] everywhere else. Yeah, I know. I mean,
[00:25:04] you're hanging out in there. It's
[00:25:06] working. I can see myself. That's all
[00:25:08] good. Interesting.
[00:25:11] Well, that's one of those things. I
[00:25:13] guess I'm going to have to try to figure
[00:25:15] out why it's doing that. That's the
[00:25:18] weirdest thing ever, huh?
[00:25:25] Well, I guess if whatnot wants to cancel
[00:25:33] me. Uh, it won't let me do my show
[00:25:36] today. Whatot? Uh, I have somebody in
[00:25:39] the whatnot chat asking me a question.
[00:25:40] I'm like, I don't know. It's not letting
[00:25:41] me do my show.
[00:25:53] Yeah, I have to start to
[00:25:56] start a new
[00:25:59] one. That's stupid.
[00:26:08] Yeah. And then um Damn
[00:26:11] it. Well, this is what I'm going to do.
[00:26:27] What not is being funky. Hey Vicas, how
[00:26:30] you
[00:26:31] doing? Yeah, it is being funky. I don't
[00:26:33] know what's going on, dude. I'm trying
[00:26:34] to figure out if I can restart it and it
[00:26:36] won't let me. And it went like it ended
[00:26:39] the show. Just done with it. I don't
[00:26:42] know. I guess I'm not allowed to do the
[00:26:43] show in the afternoon. They're like,
[00:26:44] "You're in the morning.
[00:26:49] I guess they want me morning only. So
[00:26:52] yeah, that's what's been what happened
[00:26:54] there.
[00:26:56] Well, silliness happens every now and
[00:26:59] again. What can you do about it? Well,
[00:27:02] anyways, it's down to the corner there.
[00:27:04] You want to check you out some stuff?
[00:27:06] Let's see if I have it available.
[00:27:19] Let's see.
[00:27:25] I do. I know.
[00:27:32] I do. Ready? Now. Uh, let's see.
[00:27:39] I'm going to do this.
[00:27:42] Hold on.
[00:27:59] Let's do this.
[00:28:03] Uh, I don't know if it's going to work
[00:28:05] though. Damn it. I haven't done it like
[00:28:06] this before.
[00:28:09] Um, let me see if I can do something
[00:28:12] like
[00:28:13] this.
[00:28:14] And let's see. Let's see if I can do it
[00:28:17] from here. Maybe it will work from
[00:28:20] here. We're going to try something new.
[00:28:22] Everyone hanging out here. We're going
[00:28:23] to try just what YouTube's going to let
[00:28:25] me do. All right. We're going to see
[00:28:27] what YouTube's going to let me do here.
[00:28:30] And I'm going to see if it's going to
[00:28:32] let me do something. Um, no. No. It
[00:28:35] won't let me do that.
[00:28:37] Let me see if you're on uh Maybe it's
[00:28:39] only on the computer. Is it going to let
[00:28:41] it do it?
[00:28:46] Huh? Interesting.
[00:28:48] Let's
[00:28:49] see. Does it only let me do it from
[00:28:51] here? I don't know. We'll find out.
[00:28:57] No. No. Why is it not showing that?
[00:29:00] Well, that's stinky.
[00:29:05] Maybe it's not going to do it. That's
[00:29:08] intriguing. All right. Well, it will not
[00:29:11] let me do that.
[00:29:13] I wonder
[00:29:15] why. I wonder why it's not letting me do
[00:29:22] that. YouTube will not let me show my uh
[00:29:25] Here, let's do this then. I don't know
[00:29:27] if I was going to do it, but if you go
[00:29:31] to No, it's not going to show it, is it?
[00:29:34] Mother. All right.
[00:29:40] Well, this is because I'm using uh
[00:29:42] Shopify. I just started trying to use it
[00:29:44] down there. So, if you guys see, there's
[00:29:45] actually a lot of the stuff that's
[00:29:47] available in the other store is still
[00:29:49] all available here.
[00:29:51] [Music]
[00:29:52] Um, I just got to make sure everything's
[00:29:55] right in stock
[00:29:57] levels cuz I forgot to update this one
[00:30:06] recently. There you
[00:30:09] go. Correct that. So,
[00:30:13] anyways, that's what I was just trying
[00:30:15] to think of if I close
[00:30:17] everything. I'm going to do that now and
[00:30:20] see what happens. see if it works. But
[00:30:21] if not, I will see you guys tomorrow
[00:30:23] morning is what's going to happen
[00:30:24] because I don't I'm going to have to try
[00:30:26] to do that instead. I'll uh if this
[00:30:28] doesn't work.
[00:30:43] All right. I was just
[00:30:45] making sure that everybody in the other
[00:30:46] chat saw
[00:30:50] that. I don't know if it'll work, but
[00:30:52] we'll try. Here we go.

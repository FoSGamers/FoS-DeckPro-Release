[00:01:49] Yeah. Oh, yeah. As best as you can
[00:01:51] control myself, right?
[00:01:53] Yep.
[00:01:55] Yep. Yeah. I mean, there's nothing I can
[00:01:58] do about it. It's not like I can go and
[00:02:00] find it in the middle of the country,
[00:02:01] wherever the [ __ ] it is on a trailer.
[00:02:03] I'm sorry for
[00:02:05] swearing. Sorry about that. I don't I
[00:02:07] generally don't do that here. That was
[00:02:09] That's just me being annoyed at
[00:02:10] something
[00:02:11] being over a week late
[00:02:14] now and me just having to deal with the
[00:02:17] headache of that
[00:02:19] crap. Yeah, you have to bring these
[00:02:21] comments out about like, "Oh, look.
[00:02:23] Remember this thing that ticked you
[00:02:32] off?" Oh, all right. You work with Oh.
[00:02:35] Uh nurse by any chance?
[00:02:39] because uh I know I know a lot of uh
[00:02:42] people that were nurses that used to
[00:02:43] come in and hang out
[00:02:45] here. So my wife used was a nurse for
[00:02:48] she still is certified and all that. She
[00:02:50] just hasn't been in the field. She's
[00:02:52] just last she has was more of like a
[00:02:54] kind of admin type things I guess you'd
[00:02:56] say. She was at the bedside sometimes.
[00:02:58] But you know let's run one of these if
[00:03:01] you guys want to participate in some uh
[00:03:04] adventuring this morning. We'll try it
[00:03:05] out. Let's see if you guys want to
[00:03:07] hopefully having a good morning. I'll
[00:03:09] run that for uh why not
[00:03:11] there. Run that for a little bit and see
[00:03:13] if you guys want to play some uh
[00:03:15] adventuring this
[00:03:17] morning. Ah, at a gas station. Well,
[00:03:19] that's the other. You see, there's three
[00:03:21] things that people do. It's either they
[00:03:24] they uh are like nurses or doctors. they
[00:03:29] work either in some type of retail where
[00:03:32] it's an overnight thing or um I've
[00:03:35] noticed that it's either uh construction
[00:03:37] type stuff a lot of the times that are
[00:03:40] they'll be on in the
[00:03:42] morning or like not necessary retail but
[00:03:44] like some type of job overnight where
[00:03:46] you're uh not in an
[00:03:49] office. All right, Deir dude, you got
[00:03:53] yourself an
[00:03:54] unfin. So, hey, you haven't jumped in
[00:03:56] before playing. So, we have uh I don't
[00:03:59] think I have any unless you've changed
[00:04:00] your name. That is sometimes people come
[00:04:02] in and they change your names and I
[00:04:03] figure I don't know who they are, but uh
[00:04:05] you my friend, we have these um things
[00:04:08] we do where we uh when you open after we
[00:04:10] open your pack if you'd like to
[00:04:11] participate. It's a kind of like a D and
[00:04:13] D adventure where you get to uh wander
[00:04:15] around in our my my wasteland. You guys
[00:04:19] make it too because you guys uh help
[00:04:21] decide what goes on in it. So, we're
[00:04:24] going to get you that here. Let me grab
[00:04:26] me one of those. And then you uh you get
[00:04:30] to decide what you're going to do as
[00:04:31] your character here if you're if you
[00:04:33] want to jump in and hang out with us
[00:04:34] while we play. I know there's a chunk of
[00:04:35] us that the chunk of the people that are
[00:04:37] in
[00:04:38] here. All right, let's see what we got
[00:04:41] here. Good luck, my friend. You get a
[00:04:45] super duper lost robo pinata scooch.
[00:04:49] Take out turbo tubes plot armor we
[00:04:53] champion. Right. A real handful animate
[00:04:56] object. Squirrel squatters. Claire
[00:04:59] DeLoon joy sculptor for your rare there.
[00:05:03] Actually might have a misprint. No,
[00:05:04] that's just some leftover fuzz from the
[00:05:07] cutting. An island. Nice one
[00:05:10] there. Foam weapons, kiosk, bumper cars,
[00:05:14] wicker picker, and a foil. A
[00:05:22] squirrel. There you go. I I know the
[00:05:24] islands are nice. See, all the lands in
[00:05:27] Un infinity, it's like even even if you
[00:05:29] don't get like a giant hit out of it,
[00:05:30] the lands ends up being a good hit
[00:05:32] because they're always a few bucks for
[00:05:33] the most part and even being just a few
[00:05:36] dollars there. It doesn't matter about
[00:05:38] that, but it's nice for the
[00:05:40] uh the cassettes there. What number is
[00:05:43] the doctor? Uh I will I will show you
[00:05:45] that in one second
[00:05:51] actually. the beer
[00:05:53] dude. All right, so you have to uh make
[00:05:57] some decisions here if you want to hang
[00:05:59] out with us while
[00:06:01] we wander around in our
[00:06:03] uh wasteland with
[00:06:07] everybody. Yes, they are definitely they

[00:06:15] number it is. I don't think it's this
[00:06:16] low I don't think it's a wicked low
[00:06:18] number. Um but let me check.
[00:06:24] What's that? That is in my ones over
[00:06:28] here, I do
[00:06:40] believe. No, not all your don't go
[00:06:44] together like
[00:06:48] that. I hate when these All

[00:06:56] see. Got them over here somewhere. I'm

[00:08:00] people do, some people don't. Some
[00:08:01] people just happy getting their pack or
[00:08:03] whatever it is. That's why I like to
[00:08:05] double check with
[00:08:06] everybody. Thank you, Nigers. I
[00:08:08] appreciate it.
[00:08:11] you have to wait for the person to, you
[00:08:13] know, go through with the purchase of
[00:08:14] it. That's why we have um we run on
[00:08:17] multistreaming here and I go on four
[00:08:19] different locations, whatnot, YouTube,
[00:08:21] Instagram. I mean, not Instagram,
[00:08:24] um Twitch, and X. I used to go on
[00:08:27] Instagram. I kept having issues getting
[00:08:28] it going for some reason. It was weird.
[00:08:31] So, but for that being said, we're going
[00:08:34] to go with All right. Oh, I got my

[00:08:50] the left and there's uh those
[00:08:54] there. Yeah, those weren't supposed to
[00:08:56] be going that way. They kept doing that
[00:08:58] and then it was like glitching on me cuz
[00:09:00] I went and changed it once and then
[00:09:03] it How's it going?
[00:09:06] L3 one, two, and three. That makes the
[00:09:09] bottom one. So, here we
[00:09:13] go.
[00:09:15] Raven, let's see what you get here, my
[00:09:17] friend. And then, Raven, I know you've
[00:09:19] been playing before. Now, uh, you want
[00:09:21] to hang out with some of our friends
[00:09:22] here in the in the wasteland and do some
[00:09:25] wandering around this
[00:09:33] morning. Isn't here to party? Clerics. I
[00:09:36] haven't seen this one. All right, let's
[00:09:38] see what it
[00:09:40] is. Of
[00:09:43] course, Raven's playing. He's got to get
[00:09:45] it distracted in the morning. One, two,
[00:09:47] three, four. We like to put the spoilers
[00:09:49] at the end. All right, let's see what we

[00:11:17] Watch out for my drinks right there
[00:11:18] behind
[00:11:23] you. Let me get your name written down.
[00:11:28] Raven. Now,
[00:11:31] Raven, let's see. I don't I think we
[00:11:33] have your stats in here. So, let's get
[00:11:36] to
[00:11:41] those. Thought we had them.
[00:11:45] We did have them. All right. So,
[00:11:48] Raven, let's move you over here to the
[00:11:50] other
[00:11:51] sheet. You have a
[00:11:54] pistol, a knife. Your pistol has 24
[00:11:58] rounds, though. You do have a knife with
[00:12:00] And then you also have a
[00:12:04] um 15
[00:12:06] Pogs. Looks like you may have had some
[00:12:08] type of encounter at some point earlier.
[00:12:11] So, you still have your pistol. That's
[00:12:12] good. That's good.
[00:12:14] Not bad, Gez. Thanks for checking in.
[00:12:16] He's um he he's uh definitely has a
[00:12:18] couple blisters, but they're not that
[00:12:20] big. He's able to We have like like uh
[00:12:22] you know um Vaseline on them. We'd put
[00:12:25] uh like antibiotic stuff on it and then
[00:12:27] some Vaseline over to help keep it um
[00:12:29] dry. Yes, generally only Magic the
[00:12:31] Gathering Ducky. That is correct. We
[00:12:33] play like a Dungeons and Dragons type
[00:12:34] gameish type thing, too. So, my buddy
[00:12:38] Raven, you're wandering around. All
[00:12:41] right.
[00:12:43] The Deir dude who was didn't answer
[00:12:44] early. So when they come back if they
[00:12:46] want to they can let me know. But right
[00:12:47] now you yourself are wandering and you
[00:12:50] happen to
[00:12:53] uh good
[00:12:59] man wander over. Where is it?
[00:13:14] Where'd it
[00:13:16] go? I have to This is why I keep getting
[00:13:19] other things going on. I get sidetracked
[00:13:21] all the time.
[00:13:36] The hell did it go? Oh my god, I can't
[00:13:40] read. It's right
[00:13:44] there. Thank you for asking. I very much
[00:13:46] appreciate that though. You Yeah, he's
[00:13:48] okay. Keep that cup of coffee. I know.
[00:13:50] Get it. Get really get the morning
[00:13:52] going. So, you're wandering in here, my
[00:13:55] friend. And um when you're in there, you
[00:13:57] happen to bump into
[00:14:00] a few of the people that are hanging out
[00:14:02] there and one of them happens to be this
[00:14:04] like drunken dude just hanging out
[00:14:06] there. Drunk guy comes up to you and
[00:14:10] goes arm
[00:14:13] wrestle. I guess he wants to arm wrestle
[00:14:15] you. I don't know. It's the weirdest
[00:14:16] thing ever. Not bad, James. How you
[00:14:18] doing, my friend? She comes over. He has
[00:14:20] that. Sure. All right. Well, Raven, you
[00:14:24] have to choose high or low if you'll win
[00:14:27] in the arm wrestle. our
[00:14:31] friend. Ready? Let me know when you got
[00:14:33] out your high or low and we're going to
[00:14:34] roll here for you and see how it goes.
[00:14:38] High. All right, let's go. Look at that.
[00:14:41] You got high. So, it looks
[00:14:43] like when you're hanging out with that
[00:14:46] uh talking that drunken outlaw there,
[00:14:48] you uh you slam his hand down, you
[00:14:50] win. Stands
[00:14:52] up, he goes to wander away.
[00:14:58] In the process
[00:15:08] though, I thought I had it right
[00:15:12] here. Ah, there it is. He drops a type
[00:15:16] of disc out of his pocket. Not really
[00:15:18] sure what it is. Could be some music.
[00:15:21] Could be something from the past. But
[00:15:24] now you have a little bit of a a side
[00:15:26] objective to figure out what that
[00:15:33] is. Do you want to try? You want to
[00:15:36] continue wandering through? I mean, you
[00:15:37] have to uh you now have a few things
[00:15:39] here. So, let's give you the disc for
[00:15:42] you to figure out what it is. You got a
[00:15:44] side objective, Raven.
[00:16:02] Try it. All right. I like
[00:16:04] it. Nice. So, Raven says, "Hey, I will
[00:16:10] uh you know what? I'm going to go and
[00:16:11] continue to wander around with that uh
[00:16:13] that weird weird looking disc that we
[00:16:15] found. Wonder what that thing could be."
[00:16:17] And uh as you're wandering
[00:16:20] though, you find a few things. You find
[00:16:23] Oh, look at that. You find uh some food
[00:16:24] supplies and a little bit of
[00:16:27] leather on the side of the the side of
[00:16:29] the road there. And also, look at this.
[00:16:31] A bottle of
[00:16:34] whiskey. And then we're going to get you
[00:16:35] a murders of
[00:16:37] Carlo. And you get to tell me where you
[00:16:39] would like to go in this box here, my
[00:16:41] friend.
[00:16:47] Now the bottle of whiskey, what the
[00:16:48] bottle of whiskey does, it returns your
[00:16:50] health to full, but you have minus one
[00:16:53] intelligence and minus one one on your
[00:16:56] strength uh your agility for one round
[00:17:00] L3. So like one encounter that you
[00:17:02] happen to be in, your intelligence will
[00:17:05] be weaker uh I mean less and your
[00:17:07] um and your agility will be less.
[00:17:12] So, but it does return you to health. It
[00:17:14] gives you like the beer muscles type
[00:17:18] thing. Maybe that's what I should make
[00:17:20] it look like. Somebody drinking a bottle
[00:17:22] of whiskey and gaining beer muscles.
[00:17:24] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[00:17:29] eight. Whiskey
[00:17:33] dick. I think that I don't know. I'd
[00:17:35] rather have beer muscles,
[00:17:36] [Laughter]
[00:17:38] man. Good luck. Good luck. Okay, let's
[00:17:41] see what you get here. Culvert ambusher,
[00:17:43] fanatical strength, person of interest,
[00:17:45] traumatic accusation, rift burst talion,
[00:17:48] cerebral confiscation, novous inspector,
[00:17:51] Harry dronesmith, case of the gorggon's
[00:17:54] kiss, lost in the maze, and there's your
[00:17:57] rare. Not bad. Oh, audience with Troanti
[00:17:59] for the
[00:18:00] showcase. Nice one there. Market Watch
[00:18:03] phantom and foil. And then a Nyxwaver
[00:18:07] for your uh list card. I don't know what
[00:18:10] that one is. Island and your detective
[00:18:21] token. Oh, I might have to uh make a
[00:18:25] make an image though now though of of
[00:18:27] somebody drinking it. And um they will
[00:18:29] not have whiskey problems. They will
[00:18:31] have beer
[00:18:34] muscles. All right, Raven.
[00:18:43] You're wandering around there. You found
[00:18:44] those things. You pick up your leather
[00:18:45] and your your food supplies there. Now,
[00:18:48] as you're continuing forward, you happen
[00:18:50] to bump into Oh, your way. Coming in
[00:18:53] here. Bump into one of the feral ghouls.
[00:18:56] They were in the area and they smelled
[00:18:58] the food. They were coming over, too.
[00:19:00] You've decided, Raven, what you be doing
[00:19:01] there with that ferro ghoul. All right.
[00:19:03] Hey, we have a giveaway. Let's get a
[00:19:04] giveaway going. You know what? Let's do
[00:19:05] that. I don't have one set up yet. I
[00:19:07] haven't I don't think I even run one
[00:19:08] today. Let's run a giveaway today. And
[00:19:11] you know what? We'll do it right now.
[00:19:14] And we'll do that. I haven't even run
[00:19:16] one. I was just got sidetracked running
[00:19:18] our game here having some fun. Oh, we're
[00:19:20] shooting them. All right. We're shooting
[00:19:21] them. All right. So, says uh Raven says,
[00:19:25] "I am
[00:19:27] shooting that uh feral ghoul." And now
[00:19:30] when you shoot them with your pistol,
[00:19:31] you get a plus uh you get plus two on
[00:19:34] your dice roll. Let's see if you can get
[00:19:37] over. You need that means you Oh,
[00:19:40] no. It wasn't one, right? It wasn't a
[00:19:43] one. So, uh yeah, that feral ghoul you
[00:19:46] you w you whiffed shooting that feral
[00:19:49] ghoul and then uh the feral ghoul though
[00:19:54] tries to go back to you and
[00:19:56] attack and oh my, they need a 13 or
[00:19:59] higher to hit you and that you got
[00:20:00] unlucky. They hit you but they only got
[00:20:02] you for two.
[00:20:04] Farragle chuckles and stands there again
[00:20:06] in front of you. I'm guessing you're
[00:20:08] either going to shoot or not. Morning,
[00:20:10] duders. How's it going, my
[00:20:14] friends? We got to see what's in there.
[00:20:16] You get to play a little game and get
[00:20:17] whatever's in the the the auto box that
[00:20:19] we have set up there. Shooting another
[00:20:21] time. All right, we're doing
[00:20:23] it. All right,
[00:20:26] shooting. And well, you God, you missed
[00:20:30] another time. Raven, the feroul
[00:20:33] chuckles,
[00:20:34] h haven't heard a ferold chuckle yet.
[00:20:36] And he goes after you. And then our
[00:20:38] buddy Raven comes in with
[00:20:41] another one
[00:20:44] here and he misses that time. Oh well,
[00:20:47] you guys are on a missing streak. Well,
[00:20:48] that raven that raven that feral ghoul
[00:20:51] turns and runs away, steals some of the
[00:20:54] uh food that you found. So you end up
[00:20:55] having two one rst instead of two. But
[00:20:58] you still get your uh you still get your
[00:21:00] um
[00:21:03] metal. Well, that wasn't quite the best
[00:21:05] encounter there. You kind of you got uh
[00:21:07] got a little uh unlucky on that one, my
[00:21:11] friend.
[00:21:12] Raven, let's get you uh another Let's
[00:21:16] get you. Here we go. Let's get you a a
[00:21:17] surveile land here. Let me know where

[00:21:37] go.

[00:21:45] ran, it disturbed some things. of a a
[00:21:49] medium-sized bug and a small bug come
[00:21:53] running towards you. Not that large

[00:23:06] right. Well, thank you coming in on the
[00:23:08] uh singles purchase there. We have over
[00:23:10] a thousand singles in the buy now. Um, I
[00:23:13] also have, if you type in packs, you can
[00:23:16] see all the packs that we have. Um,
[00:23:17] maybe play boosters and packs. I don't
[00:23:19] know. I can't remember. Um, and then we
[00:23:21] have a bunch of secret layer that's
[00:23:22] sealed also on top of that. And then
[00:23:25] even on top of that, on top of that, we
[00:23:27] have decks in there too where there's
[00:23:29] actually a deck in here in the PL in
[00:23:30] this auto box with some collector
[00:23:32] boosters and things like that
[00:23:36] also. Standard
[00:23:39] Allstar. Let me get this in here.
[00:23:43] The Cavalere.
[00:23:45] Yeah, this is a uh reach. When Cavalier
[00:23:47] of Thorns enters the b enters the
[00:23:49] battlefield, reveal the top five cards
[00:23:50] of your library. Put a lion from card
[00:23:52] from among them onto the battlefield and
[00:23:54] the rest into your graveyard. When
[00:23:56] Cavalere of Thorn dies, you may exile
[00:23:59] it. If you do, put another target card
[00:24:01] from your graveyard on top of your
[00:24:02] library. Nice. I do like that. Oh, yes.
[00:24:06] Oh, yes. That was a good one. I like
[00:24:07] that one, Raven.
[00:24:14] So you uh you are wandering in and uh
[00:24:16] you bump into that. You're going to I'm
[00:24:18] guessing you're going to use the knife,
[00:24:19] you said. So we're going to use that
[00:24:21] knife. You attack with a knife and well
[00:24:23] look at that. It only is a that a small
[00:24:25] bug. The mediumsized bug is only 13. So
[00:24:27] you got him and you hit him for six. Now
[00:24:29] the bug's 10. You got lucky. He's he's
[00:24:32] whales in pain as you stab it. And I'll
[00:24:35] get you the giveaway, my friend. Who was
[00:24:37] that here? Now, you as the giveaway
[00:24:38] winner, this is what I'm going to have
[00:24:39] you do, Jerbertton. I need you to give
[00:24:41] me a number between 1 and 10. And then
[00:24:43] you're going to start becoming our enemy
[00:24:45] that people encounter. All right, that's
[00:24:47] what we'll do here. So, you want to hang
[00:24:49] out, watch, because you're the enemy
[00:24:51] now. That big bug, what's he going to
[00:24:55] attack? What part of uh Raven is he
[00:24:57] going to attack? Is he going to hit him?
[00:24:59] Oh, Raven, you got lucky. You
[00:25:02] missed. I need a number between one and
[00:25:04] 10, Gerberton, if you can.
[00:25:08] And then going again with the knife, I'm
[00:25:11] guessing, Raven, right? We're going to
[00:25:12] keep doing the knife, swinging that
[00:25:14] knife away until
[00:25:15] uh until you can hit until you hit him.
[00:25:18] Let's
[00:25:19] see. Oh, we hit him again. And it's for
[00:25:22] three. All right, it's down now to uh
[00:25:25] what is it? One health left.
[00:25:29] Ah, it whales in pain, attacks you, and
[00:25:33] misses again. Oh, chat. You guys are
[00:25:36] lucky. You guys are unlucky. You don't
[00:25:38] get to do any damage. One last time with
[00:25:40] that
[00:25:41] knife. Oh, and it and you do it
[00:25:45] in using the knife. You do it in the
[00:25:48] last time there. That medium-sized bug
[00:25:51] falls to the
[00:25:52] [Music]
[00:25:53] ground and that bug is
[00:25:57] squished. Oh. Oh, no. Now, my friend,
[00:26:01] when you're looking over that bug, you
[00:26:02] happen to be Look at that. You got
[00:26:04] lucky. you find uh some rata away on it.
[00:26:07] Oh, that's a good one. A hard one to
[00:26:08] come by cuz you get bitten by you don't
[00:26:10] want to have radiation, you know. Then
[00:26:12] you have uh also with that you end up
[00:26:14] finding a
[00:26:17] uh where'd it go? Happen to have another
[00:26:20] pistol and some pistol ammo with it.
[00:26:23] Look at that. You know what's sweet
[00:26:24] about the pistol and the pistol ammo for
[00:26:26] you,
[00:26:27] Raven? You are able to dual wield
[00:26:31] pistols. So, you now have two pistols,
[00:26:34] so you're able to dual wield them. And
[00:26:36] you go uh up to 30 rounds of ammo, which
[00:26:39] split evenly between the
[00:26:43] two. And Raven coming in with
[00:26:46] another. All right, chat. You guys are
[00:26:49] going to have to let me know what we're
[00:26:50] supposed to be doing here with our
[00:26:51] um with our with our characters when our
[00:26:55] whenever anything happens as a
[00:26:57] uh as one of the
[00:26:59] um enemies. All right, because we have
[00:27:02] some low tech gear upgrade. All right,
[00:27:04] that's what we're going with. I like
[00:27:05] this. This is a good one for you, bud.
[00:27:09] So you have a daring
[00:27:12] mechanic, goblin surveyor, grim
[00:27:15] javeliner, hazard of the dunes, nimble
[00:27:19] thopterus, migratory migrating ketradon,
[00:27:22] interface ace, autoarch mammoth, canyon,
[00:27:26] vter, boom, scholar, foul rose,
[00:27:30] mindspring, muroke. Oh, nice little pick
[00:27:32] up on the meruroke there. Keen Buccaneer
[00:27:35] and the foil swamp and a thopter. My
[00:27:39] wife plays more, folks. So, slap him in
[00:27:42] the legs. That's where these going at.
[00:27:44] That's what's going to happen now. Oh,
[00:27:46] they got to fight you. No. Hey, Ees.
[00:27:48] How's it going,
[00:27:50] buddy? We can't do that. We can't have
[00:27:52] them fight you at Well, at least not not
[00:27:54] just yet. There is an instance where
[00:27:56] they could potentially come into into
[00:27:58] contact with you and fight. There you
[00:28:00] go, Raven, my friend. All right. So, you
[00:28:03] uh you have your knife there and you get
[00:28:06] lucky because you're wandering and you
[00:28:09] find a workbench when you're wandering
[00:28:12] around there. Now, you happen to have
[00:28:14] ready. You had it before. You'd picked
[00:28:17] up some
[00:28:19] metal. Would you like to try and
[00:28:22] upgrade your
[00:28:24] knife and see what happens? What you can
[00:28:27] do with it?
[00:28:30] No, not too much crazy. Uh, we had some
[00:28:32] we had good a bunch of people jumping in
[00:28:34] having some fun with it and uh I think
[00:28:35] we had a couple of intriguing character
[00:28:38] choices and things, but that was about
[00:28:39] it. Ah, upgrading the knife. I like it.
[00:28:41] All right, so you have to choose high or
[00:28:44] low cuz we have to figure it out. You
[00:28:46] don't need you don't need bonuses yet.
[00:28:47] Hey, Raven. We have to get you some uh
[00:28:49] you have to get some intelligence or
[00:28:51] some some engineering and maybe some
[00:28:52] luck or something here coming out maybe.
[00:28:55] Low. All right, load it is. Let's see.
[00:28:58] Oh no. That is the opposite of
[00:29:01] low, my friend
[00:29:04] Raven. The exact opposite of what low
[00:29:07] would be when you get a natural 24
[00:29:11] for my friend. Sorry. Well, you you were
[00:29:15] hammering
[00:29:17] away thinking you were going to make
[00:29:19] something uh nice with that knife that
[00:29:21] you got there and you take some of your
[00:29:24] metal that you actually had. You just
[00:29:25] hammering away on that workbench and
[00:29:27] then no knife broke in half. That means
[00:29:31] you're just left with your dual pistols
[00:29:32] now and a broken
[00:29:38] knife and no metal.
[00:29:44] I mean, I guess the knife is metal, but
[00:29:47] you have a broken knife and no metal.
[00:29:49] But luckily, you you beat that other
[00:29:50] thing. You got 30 rounds and two
[00:29:52] pistols. That works.
[00:29:55] That works. But when you when you were
[00:29:58] hitting there, you had a big bang behind
[00:30:01] you. Comes up out of
[00:30:03] nowhere. Not that one. Sorry. That one.
[00:30:07] A small raider. They got their own
[00:30:09] pistol. They're getting ready to shoot.
[00:30:11] You can decide what you're going to do,
[00:30:14] Raven. Mystic Enforcer is going to maybe
[00:30:16] come in and assist. We'll find
[00:30:22] out. Shoot him. Well, I figure that. All
[00:30:24] right. So, now you get two D6s because
[00:30:27] you get two pistols. Oh, and look at
[00:30:29] that. You hit him for six. You hit him
[00:30:31] for six. Wonderful. Because that small
[00:30:34] raider is only 15. That brings him down
[00:30:37] to nine. The small raider whales and he
[00:30:39] shoots at you with the one pistol they
[00:30:42] got. Oh, but they hit you for five,
[00:30:45] Raven. So, you go down. You were at 100
[00:30:49] health. You're now at 95 health.
[00:30:52] Got lucky before I weren't hit by
[00:30:54] anything. They shoot at you and I'm
[00:30:57] guessing you're going to go again. Here
[00:30:58] we go. Mystic, you got an infinity. I'll
[00:31:00] get that out for you. And we're going to
[00:31:01] open that up here in a second. Get that
[00:31:04] right here. That'll be your infinity.
[00:31:06] And I'm going to set another one there
[00:31:07] in place so that I can get to it when I
[00:31:08] need it. And then uh you got you got
[00:31:11] yourself a little encounter, too. What
[00:31:12] going on? All
[00:31:13] right, that one. Get him. Wait, did I
[00:31:17] have you hit him?
[00:31:19] Sh. We're going to roll again and have
[00:31:21] you hit it. Uh oh. Uh
[00:31:23] oh. I think you hit him before, right?
[00:31:26] What did you hit him for? I wasn't
[00:31:27] paying attention. I hit the button
[00:31:29] wrong. He hit for nine. All right.
[00:31:31] Perfect. Well, that worked. Small
[00:31:34] raider. I hit the I hit the button. I
[00:31:36] thought I was making it come out and I
[00:31:38] made it go away. I'm like, a
[00:31:40] [ __ ] Nice. You hit the raider. It was
[00:31:42] only nine left. Well, that's a good one
[00:31:44] because he he falls falls to the ground.
[00:31:48] He had a pistol, so he lo some pistol
[00:31:50] ammo.
[00:31:51] and another pistol there. But on top of
[00:31:54] it, he drops four pogs, increasing your
[00:31:59] pog
[00:32:00] count, my friend Raven. So, you're now
[00:32:04] at 19 Pogs.
[00:32:07] You have three pistols. You can trade
[00:32:09] one or sell one, you know, and you have
[00:32:12] 35 rounds of
[00:32:13] ammo. And Mystic, let's see what you get
[00:32:16] here, my friend. Mystic's been hanging
[00:32:18] out with us here. Uh, where we go? We
[00:32:23] had one for him.
[00:32:24] No. No. Maybe he didn't make one yet.
[00:32:27] We'll have to make one for you,
[00:32:30] Mystic. Good
[00:32:33] luck. Good luck, my friend.
[00:32:37] Mystic. Let's see what we got going on
[00:32:39] here. See if we can get you something
[00:32:40] awesome. We have a line cutter, crooked
[00:32:43] amphibut, bar entry, chicken troop,
[00:32:47] slight malfunction, ride guide,
[00:32:49] vegetation abomination,
[00:32:53] scampire, harbor thrasher, busted. Ooh,
[00:32:57] vorthos, steward of myth. Not bad for a
[00:33:00] little mythic action there. You got a
[00:33:03] forest. Nice looking forest. Foam
[00:33:06] weapons kiosk. Trash bin. zombie
[00:33:10] employee token and a your
[00:33:13] stickers. Oh
[00:33:18] no. What just
[00:33:21] happened? Was I Did I freeze there? Did
[00:33:24] you guys see me? Did I just
[00:33:26] freeze or did you see
[00:33:29] that? Damn it. All
[00:33:34] right. Damn it. All right. Let me go
[00:33:36] through what you got there, my friend.
[00:33:39] Um, I think on YouTube it should have
[00:33:41] been working. You should be able to see
[00:33:42] it there. But you got
[00:33:44] these. All right. Your hits out of it
[00:33:47] were not those. That's what you got
[00:33:48] there for your commons and
[00:33:51] uncommons. And
[00:33:53] then we had Vorthos, Steward of Myth,
[00:33:57] and a
[00:34:03] Forest. There you go.
[00:34:05] Mystic. Now, uh, Collector Jeff, thank
[00:34:08] you for letting me know that I was
[00:34:09] freezing there. Sorry about that,
[00:34:10] everyone. Pain in the butt. Sometimes
[00:34:13] it's pain in the butt there, Mystic. Let
[00:34:16] me get you written down over
[00:34:20] here. So, I think I just got rocked.
[00:34:22] That's probably
[00:34:29] why. All right, Mystic Enforcer.
[00:34:32] Let me
[00:34:33] uh get your stuff out of here. Get you
[00:34:36] put you in a

[00:34:41] few days. Well, I've also been turning
[00:34:43] on the extra data. So, luckily this
[00:34:46] we've been doing enough to make it worth
[00:34:49] pay for it. All right, here we go. We
[00:34:52] have uh your mystic. You're hanging out
[00:34:55] here. You have uh let's find your stuff

[00:35:21] vault. All right. So, you have
[00:35:25] um there is a vault
[00:35:29] vault that has been found the entryway
[00:35:32] here and uh but it was taken over uh
[00:35:35] that you may want to go and check out.
[00:35:38] But um that's what we're hanging out
[00:35:39] with right now. Um so I was wondering is
[00:35:44] that somewhere you'd like to go, my
[00:35:45] friend, or would you like to just
[00:35:48] continue wandering around in the city
[00:35:49] area that you've been? Oh, yeah. All
[00:35:52] right. You head on over to that uh
[00:35:54] vault. Now, this has been cleared out a
[00:35:57] little bit. So, being cleared out, they
[00:35:59] some people have come in. The vault are
[00:36:01] still there, but you have um the
[00:36:04] scavengers have
[00:36:05] left. The people in the back room, the
[00:36:08] vault there, they're still there to talk
[00:36:10] to. You have uh when you wander in
[00:36:13] there, you happen to see one of those
[00:36:15] Vaultorn NP uh there saying, "Oh,
[00:36:18] hey, do I know you? Seems familiar.
[00:36:23] What are you looking for, my
[00:36:28] friend? And that's your uh you're going
[00:36:30] to see what you want to do now. You
[00:36:32] found your way in. You're out of vault
[00:36:35] with the ballorn.
[00:36:48] Greetings, friend. Well, greetings to
[00:36:51] you, sir. I hope you're having yourself
[00:36:53] a good adventure in this wasteland and
[00:36:54] being staying
[00:36:56] safe. Do I have any bubble
[00:36:59] gum? No, I don't have any bubblegum
[00:37:02] hardcore.
[00:37:03] Why am I missing
[00:37:06] something? And then we have Raven coming
[00:37:08] in here, too. All right, Raven. Let me
[00:37:11] get this for you right here. Now, you
[00:37:13] have greetings. And he goes, "Oh, well,
[00:37:15] if you want to wander around here, we do
[00:37:16] have the vault in the back room. You can
[00:37:20] see there is a uh there's a machine that
[00:37:23] uh can sometimes upgrade devices that
[00:37:25] helps out here and can do some other
[00:37:26] things. Sometimes heal. We got a robot
[00:37:28] there, a little handy helper in that
[00:37:30] front room when you first get in the
[00:37:32] first doorway there. Uh there used to be
[00:37:34] a hole, but somebody found that and
[00:37:35] plugged that hole over on the on the
[00:37:37] left side. So, no more ghouls come in.
[00:37:38] And we got some living quarters in the
[00:37:40] in the back left where we have uh
[00:37:43] actually a friend of ours is hanging out
[00:37:45] there, Silver Sneak.
[00:37:51] Ah, vault dude might have some bubble
[00:37:54] gum. I got any bubble gum? He goes, "You
[00:37:56] know what? I don't have any
[00:37:58] myself." But the vault dude um says,
[00:38:01] "Hey, you know what? We've had uh we
[00:38:04] have some weird random things though in
[00:38:05] that uh in that living quarters. You can
[00:38:08] go check it out. Want to go check things
[00:38:10] out?" All right. Raven's going to go
[00:38:12] wander I mean uh Mystic's going to go
[00:38:13] wandering around checking things out.
[00:38:16] We're going to open up uh our buddy
[00:38:18] Raven's pack
[00:38:20] here. So, Silver Sneak was one of our
[00:38:22] other um is another one of our players
[00:38:25] that have come in and played with us.
[00:38:28] They're uh this is Silver Sneak here.
[00:38:30] They are um they they uh they fainted on
[00:38:33] their way in and uh the the the vault
[00:38:36] helped them and carried them and laid
[00:38:38] laid them down in the room in the back
[00:38:40] so that they could rest. That's all we
[00:38:42] have of it right now. But good luck my
[00:38:45] friend Raven. Let's get you something
[00:38:46] awesome. Here we have a thunderhead
[00:38:49] gunner packed all terror venom sack lag

[00:39:08] ones. Oh, a sky sees chariot for your
[00:39:09] rare grim bobble and a foil. Full art on
[00:39:13] your
[00:39:14] forest and then you're a pilot
[00:39:21] token. No tarnish
[00:39:27] butthole. All right, Raven. Well, you
[00:39:31] know what? Hey, you have couple of side
[00:39:35] objective if I uh if I ever
[00:39:38] up if I remember
[00:39:45] right. So,
[00:39:48] Raven Elden Ring. Ah. Ah. Seek rump.
[00:39:52] Thank you. Uh makes that makes sense now
[00:39:54] what they're going with. I'm trying to
[00:39:56] figure out I'm trying to pick it up
[00:39:57] there. while you're wandering around our
[00:40:00] buddy
[00:40:02] Raven and then our friend
[00:40:05] uh I was wondering what it sounded so
[00:40:08] familiar and I couldn't figure out
[00:40:10] why it was sounding familiar. I just
[00:40:12] haven't played it in that long that I'm
[00:40:14] like that's now that's it. Yep, that's
[00:40:15] it. Like I'm like why is this familiar?
[00:40:18] Why is this familiar? Why is this
[00:40:20] familiar? Like I'm saying it like but
[00:40:23] anyways. All right, Raven, you're one
[00:40:26] around. remember you have that um weird
[00:40:28] ship, but you happen to
[00:40:32] uh bump into out in the open. Tarnish
[00:40:35] gave it away. Yes, I that's exact. I'm
[00:40:37] like I've read that so many
[00:40:39] times. You have a uh you bump into this
[00:40:42] handy helperbot
[00:40:45] now, my friend Raven. What would you
[00:40:49] like to do? I mean, you've got you can
[00:40:51] attack it. You've got the uh the random
[00:40:54] disc there. You can try to figure out,
[00:40:55] give it to
[00:40:57] him. I don't know. It's up to you all
[00:40:59] what you'd like to
[00:41:03] do. And we have our buddy Mystic is
[00:41:06] hanging around currently in the vault
[00:41:09] doing a little wandering. Going to
[00:41:11] decide where you want to go,
[00:41:15] Mystic. The play booster display like
[00:41:17] this thing that I have here. It's just
[00:41:20] uh it's actually literally one of the
[00:41:22] ultra pro like things that you just
[00:41:25] stacked on top of each other. I
[00:41:26] literally just turned it around so that
[00:41:28] I could do that to slide things in so I
[00:41:31] can get to multiple packs easier rather
[00:41:33] than just having
[00:41:35] [Music]
[00:41:36] uh one pack in
[00:41:40] there. Mystic enforcer. I like
[00:41:44] it. Check out the
[00:41:48] upgrades. I like it. The good area to
[00:41:53] go. Yeah, that's what that is there.
[00:41:55] Yeah, that's what that stuff is there
[00:41:56] for that that shows off all I got. Yeah,
[00:41:58] we got a good a chunk of stuff there.
[00:42:00] Whim
[00:42:01] Jacob. All right, I like it. You going
[00:42:03] to visit those? All right, you going
[00:42:04] visit the
[00:42:06] uh in the background. There you go. All
[00:42:08] right, let's go check out that upgrade
[00:42:09] area. The other NPC who looks exactly
[00:42:12] the same. Something weird about these
[00:42:14] Vault Born. I don't know. They all look
[00:42:16] similar.
[00:42:17] Um, he goes, "Hey, what are you doing
[00:42:20] about back here?" Now,
[00:42:22] Raven. Oh, you just jumped back in. All
[00:42:24] right. I've been waiting on you, Raven.
[00:42:27] You You were wandering around outside
[00:42:28] and you bumped into a handy helperbot.
[00:42:30] Not really sure what you're doing there.
[00:42:32] You're just kind of hanging out. You got
[00:42:34] to decide what you'd like to do when I
[00:42:36] mean, remember, you do have that
[00:42:38] uh you do happen to have that code disc
[00:42:41] you found somewhere along the way. You
[00:42:44] got to remember that.
[00:42:49] [Music]
[00:42:52] Oh no, it's supposed to be pack. That's
[00:42:54] just um pack. That's the packs. It's not
[00:42:57] the display booster pack. Copied the
[00:43:01] wrong thing over is what it was. That's
[00:43:03] my uh but no, it's just the booster
[00:43:05] pack. And that's what uh there all says
[00:43:07] it in the descriptions. They're all
[00:43:09] packs. So that's why that's just a
[00:43:12] mistake in the typing. Sorry about that.
[00:43:18] No, no, no. It's just the packs.
[00:43:19] Actually, if you own Look in there in
[00:43:21] the description, it says packs, decks,
[00:43:22] and so that's just the Yeah. Oh
[00:43:33] crap. Okay.
[00:43:48] Must have got rocked or Starlink was
[00:43:50] being a pain in the butt all of a
[00:43:51] sudden. I think I'm back here. All
[00:43:53] right, we should be good. Shouldn't have
[00:43:56] any issues now. That
[00:43:58] sucks. Just popped off there and came
[00:44:01] back and now I think I'm okay. We'll
[00:44:03] find
[00:44:05] out. Happens to time.
[00:44:12] Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:44:14] Yeah, I'll go and correct it. You show
[00:44:16] him. All right, Raven. You show him the
[00:44:18] disc and you go, "Hey, hey, can you help
[00:44:19] me with the disc here?" Raven say that
[00:44:22] goes, "Hey, yeah, hold on. Let me take a
[00:44:23] look at it." Pops it in. Worries a bit.
[00:44:27] Goes, "It's uh it's I don't it can't
[00:44:29] what used to be a code, but I have not I
[00:44:32] can't get the whole code cuz the disc is
[00:44:34] kind of cracked up there. Maybe if we
[00:44:36] have uh I don't know more of the discs,
[00:44:38] I might be able to help you figure that
[00:44:40] out. Oh, that perked up Big BK's
[00:44:44] ears. Big BK's ears perked up right
[00:44:47] there. Oh, he's on a He's looking for a
[00:44:50] code
[00:44:51] himself. Going to try to figure out
[00:44:52] what's going on
[00:44:59] there now. Gives you the back. It's code
[00:45:02] to something. You're not exactly sure
[00:45:03] what it goes to.
[00:45:07] But now you know that you got to go and
[00:45:10] find
[00:45:11] something. Now, we will say there's
[00:45:13] different things in this wasteland that
[00:45:14] have codes. Some of them do, some of
[00:45:16] them don't. No, these are all they're
[00:45:18] all play boosters. Yeah. So, just so
[00:45:20] everybody's aware, being very specific
[00:45:22] on that because it says it even in the
[00:45:26] uh the
[00:45:29] description. So, hey, Ees. Oh, you're
[00:45:31] home.
[00:45:38] Jack code for a will to live.
[00:45:42] It's a cheat code. I know. You going to
[00:45:44] get the cheat code. Oh, brothers war. I
[00:45:46] like the brothers war.
[00:45:51] Morning. Nolan said, "Good morning."
[00:45:56] Yes, I know. It's It's That's uh Well,
[00:45:59] whatever. It was probably one of those
[00:46:01] copy paste things. L3. Thank you, my
[00:46:04] friend. One, two,
[00:46:10] three. Oh, I don't know. We'll see.
[00:46:15] We'll see what it's time
[00:46:19] for. All right, Raven. Well, you had a
[00:46:23] friend there. You got a friend there.
[00:46:24] You got some people wandering around.
[00:46:26] You got yourself that code. You got
[00:46:28] different locations you can go. One,
[00:46:30] two, three, four, five, six, seven, and
[00:46:33] eight. Maybe you want to go and hang out
[00:46:35] in one of those different locations and
[00:46:37] try out
[00:46:39] um try out uh what your code does. Or
[00:46:42] maybe find someone else that might have
[00:46:44] some more. I don't know. Stone retrieval
[00:46:47] unit. Good luck, my friend. Retrieval
[00:46:49] Agent, Swift Gear Drake, Dwarven Forge
[00:46:52] Chanter, Clay Revenant, Malagi, Chain
[00:46:55] Dancer, Bleachwood, Prowler, Aeronaut,
[00:46:58] Cavalier. That was completely wrong.

[00:47:15] a nice pickup for you, buddy. and an
[00:47:18] icer wellspring for your retro with an
[00:47:21] astronaut cavalry foil and a power stone
[00:47:25] foil. I mean a token
[00:47:30] there. Could be friend, could be foe.
[00:47:32] You never
[00:47:34] know. Big BK is always one of those ones
[00:47:36] that you're not sure what's going on
[00:47:38] with. Big BK is a pirate. He associates
[00:47:42] with the pirates.
[00:47:43] So Big BK, we don't know what's going to
[00:47:46] go on.
[00:47:50] And I see some P pack here getting
[00:47:52] taken. I'll go that in one second. Let
[00:47:54] me take care of that. All righty. And
[00:47:57] then if there is anything else that I
[00:47:59] miss along the way, let me know. I know
[00:48:00] there's some singles that I've had going
[00:48:01] out and we'll get those all out for you
[00:48:06] guys. And then right after I do this
[00:48:08] Bear Edge, I'll get out the uh stricks
[00:48:10] haven that I have there. Found with the
[00:48:13] last one.
[00:48:21] All right, here we
[00:48:22] go. Let's get this in here for our buddy
[00:48:26] Big
[00:48:27] BK. All right, Big, you're wandering
[00:48:30] around there and you happen to
[00:48:32] uh run into something where you are
[00:48:36] scavenging around and you find while
[00:48:38] you're scavenging this buried toolbox,
[00:48:41] where' that go? Buried toolbox in the
[00:48:43] ground. get over there. You just happen
[00:48:45] to kick it, not even caring about it.
[00:48:47] You open it up and inside of it,
[00:48:50] uh, shows you a stash of Pogs. One, two.
[00:48:53] You got 10 plus four. So, that gives you
[00:48:56] 14. Now, 10 is the the Pogs as our
[00:48:58] wasteland currency. And 10 is our uh 10
[00:49:01] are our our slammers. That's how much
[00:49:03] those are. So, you go up 14. And you, my
[00:49:06] friend, have a ton of Pogs already.
[00:49:07] You're at
[00:49:09] 220 Pogs now.
[00:49:13] Big BK and yeah, you are wandering
[00:49:16] around there. We have our buddy Raven.
[00:49:17] Now Raven and Mystic, if you guys want
[00:49:20] to give me a description for what you
[00:49:22] want to be for a uh an image, well, we
[00:49:24] can make you an image. You guys hang
[00:49:26] out. You've been hanging out for a
[00:49:27] while. Make an image for you. Like Big
[00:49:29] B's got
[00:49:32] this. We have uh some of our other ones.
[00:49:35] Caged. This is our buddy
[00:49:37] Caged. There's our buddy Yeps. Got a
[00:49:39] super uh got a got their souped up axe.
[00:49:42] They
[00:49:43] got heading back to the armory. All
[00:49:45] right, you going to head back over to
[00:49:46] the armory. Big BK says armory
[00:49:50] time. So, you head back to that vault
[00:49:52] armory that has that's been taken over
[00:49:54] by some uh raiders. Those are locations
[00:49:57] that you can see that have been cleared
[00:49:59] already. Um, we do have no one else is
[00:50:02] actually in here, I don't think,
[00:50:02] anymore. I think they ended up leaving.
[00:50:04] So, you get to decide what you want to
[00:50:05] do while you're here. Oh, my deeps
[00:50:10] didn't go away.
[00:50:13] Am I froze
[00:50:17] again? What is going on all of a
[00:50:33] sudden? Come on.
[00:50:37] Starlink says it does all these things
[00:50:39] super well and everything like that and
[00:50:41] I don't see anything working
[00:50:46] well. Seriously,
[00:50:49] Starlink, I'm
[00:50:51] gonna lose my
[00:50:54] crap. I'm going to lose my
[00:50:57] crap. There's no reason for you to be
[00:50:59] losing signal or any problems right now.
[00:51:11] Can I hear you? But the video is broken
[00:51:13] and frozen. All right.
[00:51:15] Well, at least you can hear me. Well,
[00:51:18] what I was saying was that um let's see
[00:51:21] if we're back. Oh, here you are. That
[00:51:24] you were wandering there and uh you
[00:51:25] headed back over to your Vaultorn
[00:51:27] Armory. Those are the locations that
[00:51:30] have been closed. You've taken over. You
[00:51:32] you've cleared those areas. cuz the
[00:51:33] other ones haven't been cleared yet. We
[00:51:35] had uh one of our friends there. They
[00:51:37] they ended up leaving Silver Sneak.
[00:51:39] They're
[00:51:40] here. So, all right. So, we're back and
[00:51:44] Mystic Enforcer and our friend
[00:51:48] uh our buddy Raven are wandering around
[00:51:51] with Big
[00:51:53] Bk trying to figure out what you guys
[00:51:55] going to do here. And now you're you go
[00:51:58] back to the Vault Armory and you're not
[00:52:00] really sure what you'd like to do. Where
[00:52:02] you where you want to go? You have some
[00:52:05] options. Which direction would you like
[00:52:07] to go to, my friend? Where would you
[00:52:09] like to hang out today with
[00:52:18] us? You go to the right. All right. You
[00:52:20] head over to the
[00:52:21] right. you see a hole like ah I don't
[00:52:25] know if I like that
[00:52:27] hole because uh last
[00:52:30] time that he ran into a hole there's a
[00:52:33] bit of an issue because he climbed
[00:52:35] through the hole to kind of close that
[00:52:36] up and found a field of of radioactive
[00:52:40] ghouls. So, he kind of looks at the hole
[00:52:42] that's hanging out there, goes, "I think
[00:52:45] I'm just going to leave that hole alone,
[00:52:47] and I'm going to go talk to whoever is
[00:52:50] over there." Now, that looks like it's a
[00:52:52] maybe a vault of some kind. I mean, a
[00:52:55] raider of some kind there. So, you head
[00:52:57] on over and that
[00:53:00] raider standing there looking at you
[00:53:02] like, "What are you
[00:53:04] doing?" And my buddy Raven is going to
[00:53:07] come in with an aether drift play
[00:53:08] booster.
[00:53:10] That's a
[00:53:13] pack. And then what we're going to do
[00:53:15] also,
[00:53:18] Raven, you slicing them. All right. So,
[00:53:21] you have the upgraded uh sword there,
[00:53:24] which we couldn't get a good image of.
[00:53:26] So, we're going to keep just using the
[00:53:27] one that I think. Did we get one? Did we
[00:53:29] finally get an image of it? I think we
[00:53:31] actually might have. We did. We got it.
[00:53:35] You got your upgraded pirate sword
[00:53:37] there. Your lightning capable pirate
[00:53:39] sword. And you're going to roll and
[00:53:41] you're going to see what you
[00:53:43] get. Oh, you said yours is always two,
[00:53:49] correct? But anyways, you hit him for
[00:53:52] 12,
[00:53:56] 14, 17. Wow. Hit him for 17
[00:54:01] damage and they are only 20 damage. Nice
[00:54:04] t hit
[00:54:06] hit. They're not happy with you. And
[00:54:09] they have dual pistol. They have a
[00:54:10] pistol. They shoot
[00:54:12] back. Oh no, they
[00:54:15] missed. That mediumsiz raider
[00:54:18] misses. And it's now your turn against
[00:54:20] them
[00:54:23] again. And they're
[00:54:26] dead. And you chop him in half. He falls
[00:54:29] to the ground. Slice and dice it. Falls
[00:54:32] to the ground. Now Raven, we're going to
[00:54:34] open you up your pack. You, my friend,

[00:55:31] Now, you have some choices. You can
[00:55:33] continue kind of wander around the real
[00:55:35] burnt out wasteland. Or you could go
[00:55:37] over to uh the Vaultorn area here, which
[00:55:41] is their first vault that was found. Or
[00:55:43] you could go to the Vaultorn armory that
[00:55:44] was taken over by a uh a gang of
[00:55:50] raiders. You decide where you want to
[00:55:54] go. My friend Raven
[00:55:59] has vault armor. All right. All right. I
[00:56:01] like the vault army. All right. We're
[00:56:03] going to put all your stuff together in
[00:56:04] your pack if you
[00:56:13] have. There you go, my friend Raven. All
[00:56:16] right, you head on over to that uh to
[00:56:19] that armory. You see some of those areas
[00:56:20] that are cleared. Now, we're going to
[00:56:22] have to we're going to have to put
[00:56:22] another X out. Hold
[00:56:25] on. Going to set another X out for it.

[00:56:34] paste that. This area has been
[00:56:38] cleared. Here we go. I like it. That
[00:56:42] area has been cleared. Ah, that's part
[00:56:43] of it. Did the axe not go? Ah, the X
[00:56:46] didn't go in it. That's all right. Now
[00:56:47] the accident. There we go. That's
[00:56:50] better. Ah. Oh, you're going to loot the
[00:56:53] room. Yes. Yes.
[00:56:55] Yes. Not a problem. Slowly but surely
[00:56:58] clearing that armory. So you uh you go
[00:57:01] wandering and you're looking around and
[00:57:02] investigating that Vault Armory uh in
[00:57:05] that area. You find on that guy uh a
[00:57:07] bunch of Pogs. So you actually end up
[00:57:09] finding 20 pogs. But also on them, you
[00:57:11] got uh look at this. You got yourself a
[00:57:13] health
[00:57:14] pack. And you also found
[00:57:20] yourself. Where'd he go?
[00:57:23] Critical. So you have a health pack and
[00:57:25] a critical, my friend.
[00:57:29] So you got the three health
[00:57:34] packs and a crit
[00:57:38] critical and our buddy Raven's wandering
[00:57:41] around there. Now where do you want to
[00:57:43] go in the Valdorn Armory? You said you
[00:57:45] want to go in there cleared stages or do
[00:57:47] places Russell around there. You want to
[00:57:49] go and find someone that's uh not place
[00:57:51] that's not been
[00:57:52] cleared. It's up to you if we're going
[00:57:55] through here all. Thank you all for

[00:58:20] doing some of the uh like the shorts and
[00:58:23] uh my highlight videos that I can end up
[00:58:25] having um take more time and develop
[00:58:27] some more cooler uh cooler interactions
[00:58:29] that I have planned. I just haven't had
[00:58:30] the time to do it. Anyways, let's see
[00:58:32] what go here. Go to the storage area.
[00:58:34] All right, you head over to that storage
[00:58:36] area. Now, when you head over there, you
[00:58:39] see Oh,
[00:58:40] no. There's a small raider. That raider
[00:58:44] happens to be injured. Ah, this might be
[00:58:45] the one everybody keeps running
[00:58:47] into.
[00:58:49] Now, you want to let me know what you
[00:58:52] want to do here, my friend.
[00:58:53] Raven while you're wandering around
[00:58:55] there, little I know that little guy.
[00:58:58] You keep missing. He keeps running away,
[00:59:00] alerting everyone. Oh, well, look at
[00:59:03] that. You hit him for
[00:59:05] um 11 and it was only 10
[00:59:09] health. You finally got him. He got
[00:59:12] Well, he's gone away three times. Not
[00:59:13] this time.
[00:59:15] Raven says, "Nuh.
[00:59:16] Uh-uh. Not getting away from me and my
[00:59:18] dual pistols." Shoots him dead. Drops to
[00:59:21] the floor. That small raider is dead
[00:59:23] there. Doesn't even get a chance to do
[00:59:24] anything. Luckily, it's a it's muffled
[00:59:27] there, so you don't hear much. But on
[00:59:29] them, you end up
[00:59:31] finding some pistol
[00:59:34] ammo. And now this is the salvage roll.
[00:59:37] All
[00:59:38] right. You want to choose high or low.
[00:59:41] My friend missed it. I mean
[00:59:45] Raven. I know Raven. He He's been
[00:59:47] running around alerting all of his
[00:59:48] buddies getting away. Hi. All right.
[00:59:51] Here we
[00:59:53] go. Oh no,
[00:59:59] Raven. All right. Well, instead of All
[01:00:02] right. You're salvaging and you end up
[01:00:05] finding on top of the that there. You
[01:00:09] get some You get a knife. You find
[01:00:12] yourself another
[01:00:14] knife, which is nice because you didn't
[01:00:16] have one. You lost yours
[01:00:19] before. And your ammo goes back
[01:00:22] up to uh you shot twice and you pick up
[01:00:26] some ammo. Your ammo goes up to 38.
[01:00:28] There you go, my friend.
[01:00:32] But at le you may not have gotten
[01:00:35] something giant out of it because the
[01:00:36] salvage roll didn't help. But you at
[01:00:38] least got your a knife pack so you don't
[01:00:40] have to worry about no hand to hand
[01:00:41] combat
[01:00:43] anymore. And if you want to jump in
[01:00:45] yourself and play, come in, jump in,
[01:00:46] grab one of the packs, cuz we're we're
[01:00:49] currently wandering around uh the
[01:00:50] Valdorn Armory here with a few of our
[01:00:53] friends. But what I get to do now is I
[01:00:56] need to clear that location because that
[01:00:57] was a one shot kill.
[01:01:04] and put that over here. Oh, that right
[01:01:06] there. Look at that one. One shot kill
[01:01:08] on that
[01:01:12] place. And our buddy
[01:01:15] Big BK comes and says, "I'm going to
[01:01:18] come over and take over some of this
[01:01:23] armory." And gets himself. All right.
[01:01:25] Let me know where you would like to go.
[01:01:27] Oh, we have our box here. You get
[01:01:29] yourself, you're in the armory. You're
[01:01:31] wandering
[01:01:32] around and you want to let me know where
[01:01:34] you want to go here. You have uh
[01:01:35] cleared. Most of these places are
[01:01:36] cleared. You heard a little bit of
[01:01:37] ruckus in the storage area before. Um
[01:01:40] you can either go investigate them. You
[01:01:42] can wander out and maybe bump into some
[01:01:44] other things there. It's up to you. R4.
[01:01:46] One, two, three, four. R4 is literally
[01:01:51] the bottom one here. All right. R4 is
[01:01:53] the bottom one. So there you go. R4.
[01:01:56] Let's see what you get here, my
[01:02:01] friend. This is actually pretty fun. We
[01:02:03] did this uh we got them with the kids uh
[01:02:05] and they were they will play some two on
[01:02:07] two stuff. So, this actually makes it a
[01:02:08] little bit easier for them to help to
[01:02:09] learn and everything. So, it's nice like
[01:02:12] that. Tech specialist. All right. I like
[01:02:14] it. You going to head over that uh tech
[01:02:16] specialist area. All
[01:02:20] righty. And you got copied. All right.

[01:02:30] go. Come on. How do I get a pull tab on
[01:02:33] this
[01:02:37] one? Well, it looks like I'm cutting
[01:02:39] this
[01:02:41] one. I don't want to bend and rip
[01:02:44] anything, you
[01:02:45] know. All right, let's see
[01:02:49] here.
[01:02:50] Copied. And I'm going to go one, two,
[01:02:54] three, four to put the spoilers like at
[01:02:56] the end here because we like seeing them
[01:02:57] at the end. All right, we have hearts on
[01:03:00] fire. Scholar of Combustion, Kilfi.
[01:03:04] Ancestral anger. Ancestral
[01:03:07] anger. What
[01:03:09] the All right, they did definitely
[01:03:11] duplicate that. Okay, these are a little
[01:03:13] high, too. If you notice the cut on all
[01:03:15] of them. Cyclops, Electromancer. They're
[01:03:17] slightly cut off. Oh, an upside down
[01:03:19] card. This means it's worth way more,
[01:03:21] right? This is like a million dollar
[01:03:22] card because it was printed upside down.
[01:03:24] Oh, wait. I'm sorry. Fire prophecy. Ah,
[01:03:27] they just put in the package upside
[01:03:28] down. Uncaged Fury. Young
[01:03:32] pyromancer. We have thriving bluff with
[01:03:35] all of our
[01:03:36] mountains. Then we have a fire spitter.
[01:03:40] Welp. Ooh, Charmreaker Devils. Nice one
[01:03:44] there. And a Zada Hedron Grider. Nice on
[01:03:48] that, too, for a rare with your uh
[01:03:50] copied is what you got
[01:03:52] there. All right, Big
[01:03:58] BK. You had to go through the uh storage
[01:04:01] area to get over to where that tech
[01:04:05] specialist is. All right. On your
[01:04:08] wandering through the storage
[01:04:09] area, you
[01:04:12] uh do a little you do a little bit of um
[01:04:18] scrging around there cuz you know you're
[01:04:19] a scavenger. You got to do that. And you
[01:04:23] find a broken
[01:04:27] axe. You like to pick it up and take it
[01:04:30] with you. Big
[01:04:31] BK, my
[01:04:35] friend. You don't want it. All right.
[01:04:38] All
[01:04:39] right. Here you go. Big BK put you
[01:04:43] together there. All right.
[01:04:46] I got like a frog in my throat. Well,
[01:04:48] you continue heading
[01:04:50] forward. You get over to where that uh
[01:04:53] tech specialist is up
[01:04:55] there. This is weird. They all wait.
[01:04:59] They all kind of look the same, these
[01:05:01] raiders. But this guy's not mean. He's
[01:05:03] like, "Hey, what are you doing here? I
[01:05:05] don't think you're supposed to be over
[01:05:10] here. What are you doing, my friend? You
[01:05:13] have to let me know.
[01:05:20] You
[01:05:21] are You are exactly where you're
[01:05:23] supposed to be. Oh, all right. Well, if
[01:05:26] you're uh if you're exactly where you're
[01:05:28] supposed to be, uh what are you what are
[01:05:29] you doing here? You uh you're one of uh
[01:05:30] the
[01:05:32] iron. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. You're not one
[01:05:35] of our group. All right. You're not part
[01:05:37] one of our gang members here. All right.
[01:05:40] That's all right. We'll uh that's fine.
[01:05:42] We're not we we don't need to always
[01:05:44] have have you part of the Iron Fang to
[01:05:46] come here and utilize the tech
[01:05:48] specialties. What are you looking
[01:05:51] for? Oh, I don't really have tech. I um
[01:05:55] I look at tech. I figure it out and I
[01:05:57] can either fix it and or maybe sometimes
[01:05:59] even upgrade it depending on what you
[01:06:01] have available with
[01:06:04] you. So that's what your tech specialist
[01:06:07] does over there in the corner. They
[01:06:09] don't really have anything to upgrade
[01:06:10] with it yet, but they had they can do
[01:06:13] stuff for you if you haven't. Ah,
[01:06:15] mystery chips. Oh, we like mystery
[01:06:17] chips. We've seen a few of those before.
[01:06:20] Those things are fun. Now, I implanted
[01:06:22] in one of the other guys the other day,
[01:06:23] and he just he grew huge. He was giant.
[01:06:27] Then another one we implanted him. He
[01:06:28] became like this really small guy with
[01:06:30] that was really quick with a with a with
[01:06:32] some with some uh mechanical arms. So,
[01:06:35] hey, let's see. Big
[01:06:37] BK. I like it. Here we go, my friend.
[01:06:39] Where'd you like to go? Here. And then
[01:06:41] we're going to do uh He goes and the
[01:06:43] mystery chip. Let me inspect that. He
[01:06:45] looks at goes, "Well, if you use this on
[01:06:47] you, it looks like you will uh this will
[01:06:50] add some intelligence to
[01:06:53] you, but when it adds the intelligence,
[01:06:56] it takes away your um agility and some
[01:07:01] strength." M1. There we go.
[01:07:04] M1. If you put it in a weapon, let me
[01:07:07] see. It looks like this is comp capable
[01:07:09] of being put in a weapon, too. If you
[01:07:10] add it to a weapon, it becomes Oh, all
[01:07:13] right. Well, it makes your weapon have
[01:07:16] um Okay. Makes your weapon have a
[01:07:19] potential of a uh some type of elemental
[01:07:23] power. That's what it is here.
[01:07:28] But it could also make the weapon
[01:07:31] um it'll give us some elemental power,
[01:07:34] but you're not really sure what it is
[01:07:36] and how it will affect the how it will
[01:07:38] affect it. I mean, it might be something
[01:07:39] strong. It could be like it pisses into
[01:07:43] the wind and blows back in your face
[01:07:44] type deal, you know? I don't know. All
[01:07:46] right, bookworms. Let's see what you got
[01:07:47] here, my friend. Oh, we're going to have
[01:07:50] to cut that one open. So, you have to uh
[01:07:53] Oh, good. Good to know. Exactly. Yeah.
[01:07:56] So, so that's what it looks like you
[01:07:58] have uh some options here on what you'd
[01:08:00] like to do with your your uh your
[01:08:01] upgrade here. Your uh your thing you
[01:08:03] got. We got one, two, three, four. Let's
[01:08:06] put those to the back here with the
[01:08:07] spoilers. Let's see what we got. Oo,
[01:08:10] another one of the
[01:08:11] anime.
[01:08:13] Sir, El Lenora, the discerning. I don't
[01:08:16] know if that's worth anything as the
[01:08:17] animes, but Drag Undercomfortable Chill
[01:08:21] Fairy Vandal Muse Drake. Go back up
[01:08:26] there. Mystic skyfish. Reckless scholar
[01:08:29] sky l school. Witching well memorial to
[01:08:36] genus. There you go. A land for your uh
[01:08:39] land, your thriving isle and your
[01:08:40] islands. Then you have a snar starlight
[01:08:44] snare. Fantasmal set shield back.
[01:08:48] Tafari's aegis insight.
[01:08:51] Ooh, for your rare there with your
[01:08:57] bookworms. Oh, the chipset itself. Can
[01:09:00] it be upgraded? You know what? We've
[01:09:01] actually never tried upgrading a
[01:09:04] chipset. Hm. I have to have at least uh
[01:09:07] probably three or four of them and then
[01:09:09] we can try to test it out, putting them
[01:09:11] together, and see what happens. But I
[01:09:13] can't guarantee uh it'll have a good out
[01:09:15] good favorable outcome. But uh we can
[01:09:17] try it and see if maybe we can get uh
[01:09:20] maybe we can get it so it somehow gives
[01:09:22] you uh less
[01:09:25] um less of a a drawback on your your uh
[01:09:29] on when you implant it. Maybe you won't
[01:09:31] be as hurt. Maybe instead of having
[01:09:33] like, you know, minus two on something,
[01:09:34] it gives you minus one on one thing type
[01:09:41] thing. You also need three or four ship
[01:09:44] chips. Ah, you also need three or four
[01:09:46] chips. Look at
[01:09:47] that. You're looking for chips, too. I
[01:09:50] see. Oh, well. Seems you happen to be
[01:09:53] looking for

[01:12:05] right there, um there's a weird device
[01:12:08] that we haven't been able to figure out
[01:12:09] what it's doing, but my
[01:12:11] uh my boss, my uh leader has been
[01:12:14] watching it, hanging out there. Bottom
[01:12:16] middle. All right. Bottom middle. It is

[01:13:58] you know we got a little bit of a
[01:13:59] blister going because of it but he's
[01:14:01] good. No major
[01:14:03] problems. Yeah it was mad house for a
[01:14:05] bit there.
[01:14:07] Well, our buddy, you head on over to
[01:14:10] that
[01:14:12] um refugee I mean the back room there.
[01:14:16] Now, our buddy Yees is hanging out in
[01:14:18] the uh refugee
[01:14:21] camp. You just made
[01:14:25] yourself a backpack and you found us a
[01:14:28] code.
[01:14:30] So you, my friend Yees, though, you have
[01:14:34] to decide you want to hang around in
[01:14:35] there or do you want to head out of that
[01:14:39] um refugee
[01:14:45] camp and we'll see how we go here today.
[01:14:49] Where are we going in our adventure? E's
[01:14:51] going to help me
[01:14:53] know. But we do have uh you know, I'm
[01:14:55] going to have to go through this and
[01:14:56] organize these a little easier. I have
[01:14:57] like 70,000 images on. All right. So,
[01:15:00] here. Ready? I'm going to show you a
[01:15:02] little bit of the chaos that I have to
[01:15:04] organize. So, this is my main page of
[01:15:06] all the things that I pressed. Then I go
[01:15:08] to one like this that I have all of them
[01:15:10] that I got to press. Then I go to one
[01:15:12] like this for all of your weapons. Then,
[01:15:14] uh there's the beginning of all the
[01:15:16] locations. There's your factions that
[01:15:18] some of you have joined. There's your
[01:15:21] all your players all over there. So, I I
[01:15:23] have to organize this stuff a little bit
[01:15:24] better.
[01:15:27] All
[01:15:28] right, we have Lick
[01:15:31] Thor, if I'm saying that right, coming
[01:15:33] in with a Kameawa. And uh you got your
[01:15:36] you'll get a brief interaction coming up
[01:15:38] too, but you have to decide. I think
[01:15:40] Esses must have we must have lost Eeps
[01:15:41] or something for a minute there.
[01:15:42] Sometimes people um are busy and have to
[01:15:44] head back to work and stuff. So I I you
[01:15:46] know, obviously come back Eepes, let me
[01:15:47] know. But you, my
[01:15:49] friend, Lick
[01:15:52] Thor, Lickthor, let me know.
[01:16:00] All right. Yes. So, the disc, no one can
[01:16:02] help you with the disc. The disc there.
[01:16:04] They just kind of look at it and they
[01:16:05] don't really know what's going on. So,
[01:16:06] you're going to head out and All right.
[01:16:08] You have the option. You're going to
[01:16:09] head over where some other people are.
[01:16:11] Now, there are people here in the armory
[01:16:13] and there are people here in the Vault
[01:16:15] location. Now, the Baldorn location has
[01:16:17] that handy helper bot that can read
[01:16:20] things, like your chip. And then, um,
[01:16:25] over here though, you have your, uh,
[01:16:27] tech specialist that might be able to do
[01:16:28] something to look at it
[01:16:30] too. Mid any. All right, let's do
[01:16:34] it. Let's do this one. All right, here
[01:16:37] we go. Lick, let me uh we're going to
[01:16:39] open this up and hopefully we get you uh
[01:16:41] beauties for
[01:16:43] you. What faction? Yep. Yeeps, I believe
[01:16:47] you have not chose a faction yet, if I
[01:16:49] remember
[01:16:51] right. I can go over those if you'd like
[01:16:54] in a second
[01:16:55] here. Uh, I'll read I can read through
[01:16:57] the factions for everybody. One, two,
[01:17:00] three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[01:17:03] Oo, a little bit of a spoiler with a
[01:17:05] flip card. Oh, two flip cards. We put
[01:17:07] them at the end here because we like
[01:17:08] having the spoilers at the end, but it
[01:17:09] looks like we might have already got
[01:17:11] one.

[01:17:17] pierce, thunders, steel colossus,
[01:17:19] papercraft decoy, chain flail,

[01:17:31] lighter, historian's wizard, wisdom,
[01:17:34] twinot sniper, and fable the mirror
[01:17:38] breaker. Nice on your saga there with a
[01:17:41] blossoming sand and your uh flipped card
[01:17:44] thing
[01:17:46] there. All right, you're going to head
[01:17:48] over to where the
[01:17:50] uh you head over to the Vault
[01:17:53] Armory goes.
[01:17:56] Yeets. I know. I was going to say this
[01:17:58] is a great hit if I remember right.
[01:18:00] There you go. Good pack there. I
[01:18:04] know. Let me write your name on that.
[01:18:07] Like that's why I said, "Oh, I think we
[01:18:08] know what it is." I was all excited with
[01:18:09] it. I I was getting sidetracked with our
[01:18:11] game, though. I forgot to
[01:18:15] uh throw the excitement in. I'm going to
[01:18:17] have to get a Somebody told me I should
[01:18:19] have like a a thing that I press that
[01:18:21] that will uh make noise every time like
[01:18:23] a good hit is done. What do you say?
[01:18:24] Rather than rather than the gong. Maybe
[01:18:26] I record my gong sound and then I have
[01:18:29] it go I can press the button every time
[01:18:30] we get a good
[01:18:32] hit. You're out of the army. All
[01:18:34] right. Yep. heads over the armory. Now,
[01:18:37] lit, you are uh new. You're wandering
[01:18:40] around our wasteland here. You're a new
[01:18:41] adventure. You don't have anything on
[01:18:42] you, but a pistol and a
[01:18:45] knife. So, you need to decide. You've
[01:18:48] got a pistol and you have a knife when
[01:18:52] you wander around and you start your
[01:18:53] adventure in the wasteland here. Now,
[01:18:55] you're hand hanging out here and you're
[01:18:57] wandering and you have bump into
[01:18:58] something for a little brief
[01:19:00] interaction and you Where did it go?
[01:19:06] You bump into another scrapper in front
[01:19:08] of
[01:19:11] you. All right. Now, Yees, though, he's
[01:19:14] over in that armory. He goes wandering
[01:19:17] around to ask. You head up to that tech
[01:19:21] specialist. Finally get up there. No
[01:19:23] one's in there. You head to the tech
[01:19:24] specialist. You ask him, "Hey, can you
[01:19:27] look at this disc here?" He says, "Uh,
[01:19:30] you aren't supposed to be here either.
[01:19:31] How so many people coming in here? Who
[01:19:33] didn't secure the gate? Whatever. Yeah,
[01:19:36] give me give me the disc and you look at
[01:19:37] it. He takes a look at the disc now. Let
[01:19:41] You got to let me know though. You're
[01:19:42] hanging outside the
[01:19:45] city. So you I mean outside those uh
[01:19:48] areas and have run into
[01:19:51] somebody, scrapping, looking for stuff.
[01:19:54] Now they can either fight you or maybe
[01:19:56] you can try to uh talk to them. It's
[01:19:58] always up to you what you want to do.
[01:20:04] We'll figure that one out here. And
[01:20:06] neeps though, you're talking to him. He
[01:20:08] takes a look at it and goes, "You know
[01:20:11] what? I think this seems like it's a
[01:20:13] it's a part of a code, but uh I can't
[01:20:16] get the whole thing cuz the chip is
[01:20:20] damaged. The disc is damaged. So, you're
[01:20:24] going to have to find a few more of them
[01:20:25] if you want me to get the whole code.
[01:20:27] Maybe I'll be lucky enough to get it all
[01:20:28] together. But right now, you only get a
[01:20:31] small part of it. You have to find some
[01:20:33] more of them. Oh, well, look at that.
[01:20:34] You have your side quest you got going
[01:20:36] on there. Now you know. Now you know
[01:20:38] what it is. Now, let if uh if you don't
[01:20:40] want, you don't need to
[01:20:42] play.
[01:20:46] Yep. And
[01:20:59] Raven have
[01:21:03] those. Yeeps and Raven have
[01:21:09] them. No, I I said, "Are you here?" and
[01:21:11] you I didn't hear you. So, I didn't
[01:21:12] start it and I was going to ship it. So,
[01:21:15] I didn't know if it was because I got a
[01:21:16] glitch in at that time frame like I
[01:21:18] froze and you like left the you left the
[01:21:20] stream. I didn't want to open it without
[01:21:22] you here because you bought it. So, I I
[01:21:24] could have maybe I wonder if that was
[01:21:25] when the stream was going on and I was
[01:21:27] having glitches myself. I made a
[01:21:28] comment. You just didn't hear I didn't
[01:21:31] want pretty much I didn't want to open
[01:21:32] it without you being here. No. Yeah,
[01:21:34] exactly. It got laggy for a second and I
[01:21:35] didn't want to I I didn't want to um
[01:21:37] open it without you and I said something
[01:21:39] and you didn't answer so I was going to
[01:21:41] just ship it out. So, if you're if
[01:21:42] you're here now, let's open that
[01:21:45] up. Sweet. Awesome. I'm sorry about
[01:21:49] that. I It was just more I wanted to
[01:21:50] make sure you were here. I didn't want
[01:21:51] to open it without you being
[01:21:53] here. So, let me get that over here. We
[01:21:56] are having some tech issues and
[01:21:58] sometimes when that happens, people end
[01:21:59] up leaving and I just wanted to make
[01:22:02] sure you were around to see your pack
[01:22:17] open. All righty, the Stricks Haven pack
[01:22:20] there.
[01:22:22] Now we will uh we'll open that one up
[01:22:24] for you and we will get to go. We'll do
[01:22:28] that. Sorry about
[01:22:30] that. Yeah, it's the being on the boat.
[01:22:32] Sometimes when uh where I am, people
[01:22:34] will head by and we'll get rocked by the
[01:22:35] waves and then Starlink like loses
[01:22:38] connection a little bit. So that it like
[01:22:40] we're getting a little bit of rock right
[01:22:42] now by some waves. So here we go. Let's
[01:22:43] take a look and then we're going to go
[01:22:45] on and I'll do um I'll continue with the
[01:22:47] the rest of the stuff we're doing here
[01:22:48] for everybody. All right. and I'll get
[01:22:50] right over your stuff you eat too. I'm
[01:22:52] sorry. I just got I didn't know they
[01:22:53] were back here and I want to make sure
[01:22:54] we get their stuff going. Super foggy,
[01:22:57] too. It's wicked foggy, too. All right.

[01:24:01] elemental token. What is this?
[01:24:05] Does this have a special stamp on it?
[01:24:07] This looks like it has a stamp on it.
[01:24:09] Like a weird like thing
[01:24:11] there. Is that their signature? Time
[01:24:14] warp. Nice. I like the look of that one.
[01:24:18] That's a nice looking

[01:24:34] tutor, but we definitely got you some
[01:24:36] nice cards. Topload time warp. I'm going
[01:24:40] to do that right now. What's with the
[01:24:41] time warp one? I feel like that card is
[01:24:43] something special that I'm not aware
[01:24:46] of because the card there with that
[01:24:49] stamp is
[01:24:53] weird. Yes, it definitely can be hit or
[01:24:55] miss with
[01:24:58] them. I noticed that with Stricks Haven.
[01:25:02] Yeah, here it is. It's uh it's down
[01:25:03] there. That's in the uh in the top load.
[01:25:09] Is that like a big hit that I'm just not
[01:25:10] assume I'm not aware
[01:25:12] of? It's an extra turn spell. Oh, yeah.
[01:25:14] Yeah.

[01:37:17] uh your incendiary gatling gun and you
[01:37:20] give it a
[01:37:23] little looking at him.
[01:37:26] See how it's

[01:37:41] him. He goes, "Hey, uh, what are you
[01:37:44] doing here? You're not supposed to be in
[01:37:48] here. How'd you get
[01:37:51] in? I don't understand how you got in
[01:37:53] here. You're not And the doors are
[01:37:55] always shut. What happened? They're
[01:37:58] locked. Who Who let you in? Who let Who
[01:37:59] let a door
[01:38:02] open? Oh, she came from
[01:38:04] chips and discs. H chips and discs. Oh.
[01:38:08] Oh, well, you got some of that stuff
[01:38:09] over in that weird like EMP thing. I
[01:38:11] haven't been able to figure out what it
[01:38:12] does completely, but there's some weird
[01:38:13] stuff attached to it. You want to go and
[01:38:15] try and rumage around
[01:38:17] there? You have Let's see what you have
[01:38:20] for your luck here, my friend. Let's
[01:38:21] see. You have Big BK has one luck.
[01:38:25] one intelligence and one engineering,
[01:38:28] which will help them. So, you need to
[01:38:30] have uh seven or higher when you roll.
[01:38:34] All right, my
[01:38:36] friend, cuz you go over to investigate
[01:38:39] that area and Oh, wow. That was a little
[01:38:43] closer than we wanted it, huh? Like by
[01:38:45] the skin of your teeth right there,
[01:38:46] dude.
[01:38:49] Hey, bud.
[01:38:53] So, you uh you go and you look around
[01:38:56] that area in the back there, that EMP
[01:38:58] node area, and you actually end up
[01:38:59] finding on there
[01:39:03] this random code disc that's broken up.
[01:39:06] One of them is stuck in the machine
[01:39:07] there. And also, you end up finding um
[01:39:13] two mystery chips.
[01:39:17] So, you find two mystery chips.
[01:39:26] That gets you four mystery chips.
[01:39:28] And then you also find
[01:39:31] um one of the
[01:39:34] uh discs. Just
[01:39:38] broken. That was a big bat on that one.
[01:39:40] I know
[01:39:43] he has a lot now. Well, he doesn't have
[01:39:45] No, he doesn't have a lot of discs. He
[01:39:46] has only one disc and he has a bunch of
[01:39:48] the memory as the chips. They're a
[01:39:50] little
[01:39:52] different, but you can give it to him
[01:39:54] still. It'll probably help you out
[01:39:55] anyways in the end, you know, handing
[01:39:57] handing it over to him. You do need
[01:39:59] three discs, so he needs another one
[01:40:00] still, but that'll help him. Yeah, he
[01:40:02] has he has one disc now. You need he
[01:40:04] needs three of them at the moment. Yes,
[01:40:06] he's looking for a few. How does how'd
[01:40:08] it go, Ryan, with the first one there?

[01:40:11] liking it.

[01:40:16] campaign uh because I built actually a
[01:40:19] whole campaign. I actually have a
[01:40:21] 30-page short story that has the
[01:40:24] background for some of the campaign in

[01:42:14] weird noise. I'm wondering if we

[01:42:22] put the air con on. See if you can have
[01:42:23] something else running. That's good.
[01:42:25] Yeah, it's just we have nothing running.
[01:42:30] So, there's no demand on it and it
[01:42:32] doesn't work well if there's no demand.
[01:42:35] It has It works best when we're at It's
[01:42:37] a diesel engine, so it works best when
[01:42:38] it's like at like 75% usage. So that's
[01:42:41] why it's nice to have something run. Can
[01:42:43] you say hi to them?
[01:42:45] Nolan says hi everyone and thank you for
[01:42:47] all the help earlier.

[01:44:43] prop, if not our
[01:44:46] rudder.

[01:45:23] to start out. You're fresh. You know,
[01:45:25] you are wandering around. You're an
[01:45:27] adventurer. You wander around our city,
[01:45:28] our our Fallout
[01:45:31] wasteland. When you start, you get a
[01:45:33] pistol and you get a knife. All right.
[01:45:36] And I need you to tell me where you'd
[01:45:37] like to go out of these and the minor
[01:45:40] encounter that you have. We We'll see
[01:45:41] what happens with your minor encounter
[01:45:43] car, Malcolm.
[01:45:49] Nice. Top middle. All right. Top middle.
[01:45:53] Right. Here it is, my
[01:45:55] friend. Let's see what you get in this.
[01:45:58] And then you are wandering around. Yeah.
[01:46:00] Like I said, you got that pistol. You
[01:46:02] got that uh
[01:46:04] knife. And uh you happen to be running
[01:46:07] through those burntout buildings. And in
[01:46:09] one of those burntout buildings, you're
[01:46:11] ramaging around. You see a buried
[01:46:13] toolbox partially there and you decide,
[01:46:16] "Hey, I think I'm gonna go and look at
[01:46:18] that. See what's in there." You know,
[01:46:19] you're a scavenger, right? Well, you're
[01:46:21] going to scavenge and behind
[01:46:25] you skittering over is a mediumsized
[01:46:29] bug. Now, the bug is 10 health.
[01:46:33] All right. And it cost for you to hit
[01:46:36] him is landfall. Not bad there. you get
[01:46:38] a uh to hit it, you will have to have a
[01:46:42] um 14 or higher on a roll. Now, when you
[01:46:45] use your pistol or your knife, you get a
[01:46:47] plus two for your roll. It's always only
[01:46:49] be like a 12 or higher. One, two, three,
[01:46:51] four. See the spoilers at the end. So,
[01:46:53] you got to let me
[01:46:55] know. I know. Well, you you you you
[01:46:58] should see the big one then. Canopy Bath
[01:47:03] Harrow. Kazandu stomper. Morasa Ranger.
[01:47:07] Retreat to Kazadun. Kazandu snapping
[01:47:11] narid territorial side cat. Cliff haven
[01:47:15] kites. Evolving wilds. Thriving grove
[01:47:19] with all of your forest there. Then you
[01:47:22] have a bite
[01:47:23] down. Sutina speaker of the tajuru.
[01:47:30] All right. Scythe
[01:47:33] club for your rare there. And a
[01:47:37] landfall. There's your landfall one
[01:47:39] there. That side that cub. I was going
[01:47:41] to say I'm pretty sure that's a big hit
[01:47:42] on the uh on the cat ones with all those
[01:47:44] new cats coming out with all the cat
[01:47:47] things coming out. I'm pretty sure this
[01:47:48] one's a a good size hit
[01:47:50] here. Let me get that in a top load up.
[01:47:54] My friend Car Malcolm, it is a trample
[01:47:57] landfall. Whenever land you control
[01:47:58] enters, put a plus one plus one counter
[01:48:00] on target creature you control. If this
[01:48:02] is the second time this ability has
[01:48:03] resolved this turn, double the number of
[01:48:05] plus one plus one counters on that
[01:48:08] creature
[01:48:10] instead. That is a fun sounding card.
[01:48:13] Car Malcolm, I'm Oh, 26 bucks. Well,
[01:48:17] buddy, that's a good
[01:48:20] pickup. Car
[01:48:25] Malcolm, there you go, my friend. put
[01:48:27] your name on
[01:48:28] that. All right. You though, as you, as
[01:48:32] I said, you got that thing there. You
[01:48:33] have an opportunity. You can uh decide
[01:48:35] you want to shoot with your your pistol.
[01:48:37] You can slice it with your knife. You
[01:48:39] can run away. It's always up to you what
[01:48:41] you want to do when you encounter
[01:48:43] something in the wasteland. It's not me
[01:48:45] choosing, it's you. It's always you
[01:48:47] choosing.
[01:49:04] Pistol it is. Does the pistol work?
[01:49:10] Ooh, you hit him for two. That's not a
[01:49:14] big hit. Brings him down to eight.
[01:49:18] Not bad, but that mediumsized bug is not
[01:49:21] happy.
[01:49:25] And that medium-sized bug attacks you.
[01:49:30] Oh, lucky. He misses. He needs a 13 or
[01:49:33] higher to hit. So, he goes to snatch at
[01:49:35] your your ankles, trying to bite your
[01:49:37] ankles, and he
[01:49:39] misses. Are you I'm guessing you going
[01:49:41] to try the pistol again.
[01:49:45] Yes, sir. Pistol it is.
[01:49:49] Oh, no. This time you missed.
[01:49:54] That's not good.
[01:49:57] The bug dive dove out of the way this
[01:50:00] time and it attacks you back.
[01:50:07] Oh, and it misses again. You're
[01:50:09] lucky, my
[01:50:11] friend. You've got some luck. Here's
[01:50:14] your last chance for the encounter here.
[01:50:15] No, no. Are you going to I'm guessing
[01:50:18] you're going to go with the shoot again.
[01:50:19] All right, let's do it.
[01:50:23] Do we have the luck for it? Oh no, you
[01:50:27] miss another time
[01:50:30] with the pistol.
[01:50:32] And the bug does not. It takes its last
[01:50:35] chance here to see if it gets you. And
[01:50:38] the bug misses. Well, it looks like you
[01:50:41] guys are kind of just staring at each
[01:50:44] other. I don't think this is going to
[01:50:46] work out. It kind of looks kind of looks
[01:50:48] behind itself. doesn't see any of its
[01:50:51] friends around and it turns around and
[01:50:53] skitters away. In the process of
[01:50:55] skittering away, it knocks up some stuff
[01:50:58] in the area and you find four pogs. Now,
[01:51:02] pogs are the wasteland currency. So,
[01:51:04] that means you get yourself a couple
[01:51:05] pogs. So, maybe you run into some
[01:51:07] traders, you'll have something to uh
[01:51:09] you'll have something to maybe trade
[01:51:10] with or buy with them. Then, coming up
[01:51:13] next, we have our buddy Carmichael
[01:51:15] coming in again. All right, let me put
[01:51:17] you in here with what you have now
[01:51:19] accomplished and what you have. We have
[01:51:21] to have you in our our our list of uh
[01:51:27] players. All
[01:51:29] right. Now, you have your pistol, your
[01:51:34] knife. It skiittered up some Pogs. So,
[01:51:37] you got four Pogs
[01:51:39] there. All right. and your pistol. You
[01:51:42] shot it three times, so you are down to
[01:51:45] six rounds. You start out with nine, so
[01:51:48] you're down to six rounds with your
[01:51:49] pistol, but you do have your
[01:51:51] knife. Buggers go by. Now, you got
[01:51:55] yourself an Aetherdrift play booster.
[01:51:57] All right, here you go. Aether drift
[01:51:59] play booster coming at you, my friend.
[01:52:01] And then you also have what is a we call
[01:52:03] it a low tech upgrade. So, what happens
[01:52:05] is uh you're wandering
[01:52:08] around and you happen to see some uh
[01:52:10] scrap metal and some
[01:52:13] leather and when you see that it happens
[01:52:16] to be right next to a
[01:52:18] workbench. Now, you have an opportunity,
[01:52:22] Carmichael, to take one of your weapons
[01:52:25] that you have and try to do some type of
[01:52:27] upgrade to it. Now, maybe it's um you
[01:52:31] know, the knives, make them a little
[01:52:32] better. Maybe it put some leather on the
[01:52:34] handle of your of your pistol to make it
[01:52:36] uh more give you some maybe more agility
[01:52:39] or something. Who knows what it is, but
[01:52:40] it's always on you what you're going to
[01:52:41] decide you want to try. Sky Streak
[01:52:43] Engineer, Leonin Surveyor, Lightning
[01:52:46] Strike, Siphon Fuel, Silken Strength,
[01:52:50] Light Wheel Enhancements, Vevel Heart
[01:52:52] Bike, Trade the Helm, Thundering Brood
[01:52:56] Wagon, Unswerving Sloth, Intimidation
[01:53:00] Tactics, River Churn Monument. There you
[01:53:03] go. Rover Blades and Foil, and then you
[01:53:07] have an island and your dinosaur
[01:53:10] dragon token.
[01:53:14] So, you've got to decide, my friend.
[01:53:16] Upgrade the knife. All right. Not a bad
[01:53:18] idea. So, you take the uh your knife
[01:53:21] there. Start hammering away on the knife
[01:53:25] with some of the things that you have
[01:53:26] there. Now, you need to tell me low or
[01:53:28] high for your roll if you're going to
[01:53:30] get uh going to be able to upgrade a
[01:53:33] super a good upgrade or like a just
[01:53:34] Yeah, it does something. All right.
[01:53:38] So, low it is.
[01:53:41] H.
[01:53:42] Um, Carmichael, I do believe that's the
[01:53:46] opposite of
[01:53:48] low. Um, all right. Well, being a
[01:53:52] critical failure, that is Oh, all right.
[01:53:57] Well, this is what happens
[01:53:59] here. All right. You go to upgrade your
[01:54:02] knife, the low tech upgrade.
[01:54:05] the process of doing
[01:54:07] it. You break a handful of them, but you
[01:54:10] end up making three, not all of those,
[01:54:13] three throwing
[01:54:15] knives out of it with the metal you
[01:54:18] have. So, you had some leather and you
[01:54:19] had some metal and you had the, you
[01:54:20] know, the way to doing it. So, instead
[01:54:22] of having more, you found you made three
[01:54:24] throwing
[01:54:29] knives. Now, with throwing knives,
[01:54:32] they're all
[01:54:33] um like they are they're all plus two
[01:54:37] when they are attack with them, but you
[01:54:39] can throw three of them at once
[01:54:42] um in an attempt to uh
[01:54:46] hit. So, there you go, my friend. Got a
[01:54:49] little bit of an upgrade there with the
[01:54:50] throwing
[01:54:53] knives. It's sad though we did not have
[01:54:56] a big one. We were hoping that we could
[01:54:57] uh do something. Maybe uh got lucky and
[01:54:59] I don't know, maybe found out how to
[01:55:00] make a machete or something, but at
[01:55:02] least you got something. You got a
[01:55:03] little low tech upgrade there. Got a
[01:55:04] little something there still, Car
[01:55:07] Malcolm. And uh you turn
[01:55:10] around as you've been doing some of
[01:55:13] that. And
[01:55:15] uh you bang away on the workbench. Put
[01:55:19] some of those things
[01:55:22] away. And Carmichael
[01:55:26] come in with an infinity draft. I like
[01:55:29] it, my friend. Infinity draft right here
[01:55:32] and you have a uh a little encounter
[01:55:33] that you run into after uh having those.
[01:55:36] Now, you turn
[01:55:38] around
[01:55:43] and you bump into a small
[01:55:47] raider. This guy seemed to be um
[01:55:49] sneaking around behind you. Kind of
[01:55:51] sneaking up behind you. You didn't even
[01:55:53] know he was there when you were working
[01:55:54] on that workbench. Just all of a sudden
[01:55:55] shows up behind
[01:55:58] you and uh you're not really sure what
[01:56:00] he's doing. Car car Malcolm, let's see
[01:56:03] what you get here. Good luck. We have an
[01:56:04] unlawful entry. Bird gets the worm. Zeno
[01:56:09] squirrels. Circus axe. Stilt strider.
[01:56:12] Rad rascal. Carnival. Carnivore. Blank
[01:56:16] balls of fire. Attempted murder. Knight
[01:56:20] and blank armor to shack elemental. All
[01:56:24] right, not
[01:56:26] bad. Your planes. Nice planes. I like
[01:56:30] the look of that one. Fortune teller
[01:56:32] memory test. Another nice rare pickup.
[01:56:34] And then your clown robot token. And
[01:56:36] your
[01:56:38] stickers. So
[01:56:40] Carmeal turn around and you see that uh
[01:56:44] that small raider there. Not really sure
[01:56:46] what he's doing. He's not being
[01:56:47] malicious at the moment, but he was
[01:56:50] definitely being a little a little
[01:56:52] sneaky
[01:56:53] there. So, Carmichael Car
[01:56:58] Malcolm, what would you like to do with
[01:57:01] that guy that uh you're running into
[01:57:05] here with the
[01:57:07] uh the small raider hanging out? Yeah.
[01:57:12] Got to let me know what you're going to
[01:57:13] do with the small raider.
[01:57:20] [Music]
[01:57:34] He has nothing on for gear. He might
[01:57:37] have a pistol on his side, but that's
[01:57:38] about it.
[01:57:42] He look He looks like he's one of the
[01:57:45] potentially could be one of the thief
[01:57:55] raiders. I just close this for a
[01:57:59] second. You look at him, you go, "Hey,
[01:58:02] what are you doing sneaking around
[01:58:03] here?"
[01:58:07] and he
[01:58:07] uh he looks at you and he uh stumbles
[01:58:10] over his words and um yeah the um that
[01:58:14] that them uh uh
[01:58:16] oh uh the workbench there. Yeah. Yeah. I
[01:58:19] was waiting to use the workbench. I saw
[01:58:21] you were working on it and I didn't I
[01:58:23] didn't want to take over so I was I was
[01:58:24] just giving you some time.
[01:58:33] Do you believe
[01:58:39] him? All right. What are you going to
[01:58:48] do? Shoot
[01:58:51] him. Shoot him. It is. You don't believe
[01:58:54] him. You take your pistol out
[01:59:02] and go
[01:59:04] away. You
[01:59:07] shoot. Nice. All you needed was a 14 or
[01:59:11] higher to hit it. Hit him. And you hit
[01:59:13] him for four. Now this raider's only got
[01:59:16] 15 health. He whails in
[01:59:20] pain. Like what are you
[01:59:23] doing? And he pulls out his pistol to
[01:59:27] try to shoot you,
[01:59:29] too. But he misses. He needs a 13 or
[01:59:32] higher to hit you. You got lucky. I'm
[01:59:35] guessing you're going to shoot him
[01:59:36] again,
[01:59:37] though, cuz he had 11 health. So, let's
[01:59:40] go with another shot again. Oh, no. That
[01:59:45] only gets you. That only got you 11 with
[01:59:47] the plus two there. So, you miss with
[01:59:51] the pistol.
[01:59:54] That small raider chuckles and says,
[01:59:55] "Ah, bad shot, huh?" And they themselves
[01:59:59] roll, try to shoot
[02:00:02] you. They miss. You look at the
[02:00:06] guy, you know. Oh, yeah. Who's the bad
[02:00:08] shot
[02:00:10] now? And here you go. Your last attempt
[02:00:14] here. Just
[02:00:18] shoot. Uh-oh.
[02:00:22] Do we
[02:00:27] freeze? Here we
[02:00:29] go.
[02:00:31] Oh no, you missed. It's a 14. You only
[02:00:35] get two extra. You missed
[02:00:38] again. Yet he rolls to attack and they
[02:00:42] miss
[02:00:44] also. So you guys are kind of just
[02:00:46] staring at each other. You hit him once.
[02:00:49] He's like, "Yeah, you know, I think I'm
[02:00:50] going to turn around and leave
[02:00:52] here." I know the rolling sucks, but he
[02:00:56] turns around to leave and I'm going to
[02:00:57] give you an opportunity. Do you want to
[02:00:59] shoot him in the back or do you want to
[02:01:00] let him walk
[02:01:01] away? It's up to you what type of
[02:01:03] character you
[02:01:08] are. Shoot him in the back. All right,
[02:01:10] you doing
[02:01:13] it. Well, I think that was a good shoot
[02:01:16] in the back. You rolled a 20 there.
[02:01:22] Well, they turn
[02:01:24] around to walk away and you go, "Ah,
[02:01:27] it's not happening." And you shoot him.
[02:01:30] And that was an instant death with the
[02:01:33] uh with a critical there with your your
[02:01:35] you got a critical hit there with your
[02:01:37] uh natural 20. So there you are, my
[02:01:40] friend. And you drop down there. They
[02:01:42] drop dead. And on them you find a
[02:01:45] pistol, some
[02:01:49] ammo. You also
[02:01:53] find 20 Pogs. It looks like they may
[02:01:56] have been a thief. They've been They
[02:01:57] have a good amount of Pogs on
[02:02:00] them. So, you now have a pistol, two
[02:02:03] times the pistols, which means you can
[02:02:05] actually dual wield pistols. And you are
[02:02:07] now up to 16 shots for your
[02:02:10] ammo. And you also now have 24
[02:02:16] Pogs. You're going to dual wield them. I
[02:02:18] like them. Dual wielding is good. Dual
[02:02:20] wielding is a good time.
[02:02:43] stretch. So, we open some packs and uh
[02:02:45] we do like a D and D type game. After we
[02:02:47] open packs,
[02:02:49] um it's evolved from what it used to be
[02:02:52] to this here. We get a pack of cards and
[02:02:54] then when you get it something occurs
[02:02:57] going along with uh the D and D related
[02:02:59] game and you get to uh have some fun
[02:03:03] while we're doing it. Now some of the
[02:03:05] once you uh start you have your
[02:03:07] character stays here indefinitely in the
[02:03:09] uh the the FOS gamers wasteland here. I
[02:03:13] have a I have a I actually have like an
[02:03:14] Excel file that has like a hund and some
[02:03:18] odd people over the over the time that
[02:03:19] we've been doing
[02:03:21] this. So, car Malcolm, where would you
[02:03:25] like to go
[02:03:27] here? Because you uh just killed that
[02:03:31] guy. Found some uh found the extra
[02:03:32] weapon there. Found some more Pogs. Top
[02:03:35] on the middle. I like it. Top middle it
[02:03:37] is. Let's see if we can get you some
[02:03:40] beautiful luck. Like maybe a a tyrant of
[02:03:42] some kind or uh something like that.
[02:03:45] That would be
[02:03:46] nice. All right. Good luck, my friend.
[02:03:49] We have one, two, three, four, five,
[02:03:52] six, seven, eight. Let's see what we get
[02:03:55] here at the end. All right, good luck,
[02:03:58] buddy. Corrupted conviction, rooftop

[02:04:34] uh you wander around, you you you bump
[02:04:35] into uh some different
[02:04:38] things. And you see this stray ghoul
[02:04:41] wandering
[02:04:43] around. It's not being malicious. Just
[02:04:46] kind of stops, looks at you, grunts a
[02:04:49] little
[02:04:51] bit, and then stands there staring at
[02:04:54] you. Not doing anything. Just just
[02:04:57] staring at you.
[02:05:02] What would you like to do, K Malcolm?
[02:05:05] There you go. All your stuff

[02:05:09] not being uh he's not attacking. He's
[02:05:11] not doing anything nice or wrong. Just
[02:05:13] wandering around
[02:05:15] there trying to figure out what's going
[02:05:17] on. Ask him what's up. Hey, buddy.
[02:05:18] What's going on there? And he kind of
[02:05:20] looks at you like you kind of recognize
[02:05:22] what's going on
[02:05:24] and and then starts walking further.
[02:05:29] not really doing anything to you,
[02:05:31] but walks away. Maybe uh maybe if you
[02:05:35] have something
[02:05:36] to for
[02:05:38] it. Maybe you have something for it that
[02:05:40] you could try to see if it
[02:05:43] wants and maybe it'll hang out. I don't
[02:05:45] know. Or you or you just let it go. Or
[02:05:47] you could shoot it. I mean, it's up to
[02:05:48] you. I know one of our friends
[02:05:50] befriended him by giving him a knife and
[02:05:52] then somebody else shot him. I mean, so
[02:05:55] he died. So I That happens in the
[02:05:56] wasteland. It happens. I mean, Big BK
[02:05:59] thought he was uh thought he wanted to
[02:06:00] kill him. So, Big BK killed him when uh
[02:06:02] I think it was Silver Sneak made a
[02:06:04] friend by getting a knife. So, it's up
[02:06:05] to you how you handle this
[02:06:08] situation cuz all he does is
[02:06:11] grunt, make noises. He's not really He's

[02:07:05] pistols more. He wanders over. He grabs
[02:07:08] a
[02:07:09] knife. And uh he starts waving the
[02:07:12] knives
[02:07:14] around. Seems like he kind of recognizes
[02:07:16] something. Flip spins one in his hand
[02:07:17] like rather uh rather
[02:07:21] um artistically like he knows what he's
[02:07:23] doing. He's been doing it before. So, I

[02:22:00] thing, but um they didn't want to come
[02:22:02] down to a place that I was willing to
[02:22:04] buy the whole thing.
[02:22:07] So, one of these days maybe I will.
[02:22:09] We've done We I've looked into it a few
[02:22:11] times. All right, here we go. You've got
[02:22:13] your last of these. Exelon, good luck,

[02:22:49] your things. I like
[02:22:53] those. Yeah, exactly. That's exactly.
[02:22:55] They wanted like retail. Exactly. I'm

[02:23:04] let me get to the next one. Here we have
[02:23:07] Hold on. Let me
[02:23:16] see. No. Oh.
[02:23:27] I'm going to grab these out
[02:23:36] here. One. Two of
[02:23:38] those. All right. So, it looks like I
[02:23:43] may have miscounted on one of those when
[02:23:45] I put them in the inventory for the
[02:23:47] Bloomber, my friend
[02:23:51] JM. Thank you, JM. I very much
[02:23:53] appreciate that. Um, so what I'm going
[02:23:55] to do here is we have an option of we
[02:23:58] can go with something else that was
[02:23:59] available there. Um, if you'd like, um,
[02:24:03] we can trade it out or I can we can do
[02:24:05] like a refund on one of them. So, let me
[02:24:07] know what you want to do on that. I I
[02:24:09] guess I miscounted and I did not or I
[02:24:12] just didn't update that stuff. I can do
[02:24:14] a handful of the play boosters if you
[02:24:16] like because I do have some Bloomber
[02:24:18] play boosters still, but it looks like I
[02:24:22] miscounted on
[02:24:24] those. I am sorry about that. And let me
[02:24:27] um I'm going to take a drink quickly
[02:24:29] here while we kind of figure out what we
[02:24:30] want to do on that
[02:24:34] one. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Trade out. Okay,
[02:24:37] sounds good. So, let's do a trade out
[02:24:39] here.
[02:24:46] Thank you, Dr. Evo. Well, we do it all
[02:24:48] the time. I've been doing this for over
[02:24:50] um almost two years now. Never had any
[02:24:52] problems. Yes, we do have other
[02:24:54] collector boosters. Oh, we have um we
[02:24:56] have outlaws collectors, Mrs. Carlo
[02:24:59] collector. Um you could go with
[02:25:04] a wild drain collector, a dusk mourn
[02:25:07] collector, an aether drift collector,
[02:25:09] lost caverns of
[02:25:11] collector. Um so those are kind of what
[02:25:14] you would have as your options there.
[02:25:16] Let me know which one you'd like. We

[02:25:31] somewhere. I just have to find where I
[02:25:32] put those, but I do have Dusorn

[02:25:35] be at the bottom, maybe. I don't know.

[02:40:17] Stretch. You're uh you see some of those
[02:40:19] burnt out buildings that you're there
[02:40:21] and uh in those burntout
[02:40:23] buildings. You're wandering
[02:40:26] around and you happen to bump into
[02:40:30] uh a small raider who is looking around
[02:40:33] there,
[02:40:36] too. Some of the times they're on
[02:40:38] YouTube. Uh that's why some people go on
[02:40:39] YouTube and stuff, so that's why. Uh all
[02:40:41] right, here we go. Hypnotic. That's why
[02:40:43] I try to say what everybody's doing.
[02:40:44] Hypnotic scepter. I'm going to put the L
[02:40:46] lantern and your brood dragon in a top
[02:40:49] loader. Yeah, cuz uh we we multistream
[02:40:53] um all over on four different places on
[02:40:55] YouTube, Twitch X, and also whatnot. So
[02:40:59] that's why uh that's why we um we're all
[02:41:01] over all over the
[02:41:04] place. So sometimes when I'm talking
[02:41:06] that's my that might be why I might be
[02:41:08] talking to somebody that had responded
[02:41:09] on um on YouTube or something, you know.
[02:41:13] All right. You want to make friends with
[02:41:15] the rats? You know what? That's not a
[02:41:17] bad idea. You're hanging out in that
[02:41:19] that small town. You see some of the
[02:41:20] rubble, the rats talking to you. And in
[02:41:24] the rubble, you happen to find You're
[02:41:25] lucky. You found some food supplies and
[02:41:28] some leather.
[02:41:29] JM. All right. Let me put these in with
[02:41:32] your stuff, my friend.
[02:41:38] Stretch. and then stretch.
[02:41:44] You remember you're in that uh burnt out
[02:41:48] building and you ran into uh some of
[02:41:51] those burnt out building. You ran into a
[02:41:52] small
[02:41:53] raider now. You have a pistol and a
[02:41:58] knife. All right. Building. Building.
[02:42:00] All right. Building. I like it. So you
[02:42:01] stand you go uh one behind one of those
[02:42:03] buildings. You see him wandering and he
[02:42:05] kind of just stop kind of wanders by
[02:42:07] shuffling his feet. and kick me out of
[02:42:09] that place again. They always making fun
[02:42:10] of me. I'm the small guy. I just got the
[02:42:12] ch. It's not a small guy. Always making
[02:42:14] fun of the little one. Poking fun at
[02:42:16] him. Look at the [ __ ] Look at the
[02:42:17] mini
[02:42:18] guy. He just goes wandering through. Not
[02:42:20] really paying attention to anything.
[02:42:22] Seems like he's got his own thing going
[02:42:23] on with his man mind. And you though on
[02:42:26] the other hand, our friend JM, you see
[02:42:28] the rat there and you go, "Hey buddy,
[02:42:30] you want some of this?" and you gain
[02:42:32] over and you hand that
[02:42:36] rat some of your food that you found
[02:42:38] there. All right. Well, the rat takes
[02:42:40] the food, nibbles on it, runs
[02:42:43] away, and we have stretch trying to
[02:42:46] decide what they're going to do. The uh
[02:42:48] the small raider walks past them,
[02:42:51] doesn't really do anything. Nothing
[02:42:52] major happens. They wander on
[02:42:54] past and no one nothing really occurs.
[02:42:57] They just shuffle their feet and they go
[02:42:58] by.
[02:43:03] There you go. You eat, you eat some
[02:43:05] yourself.
[02:43:06] JM JM
[02:43:11] Clay, I like it. So, you are at 100
[02:43:14] health. You feed the rat some of your
[02:43:17] stuff there. You found um some metal
[02:43:20] earlier and some rations, so you gave
[02:43:22] them that. You got your pistol and your
[02:43:24] knife that you wander around the
[02:43:25] wasteland with when you start out. And
[02:43:28] you now have uh gave some food to the um
[02:43:31] to a rat
[02:43:36] there. I did the regular Oh, I did not
[02:43:39] get your other regular one. Ah, mystery
[02:43:41] booster 2. I missed I missed that in the
[02:43:44] um in the order history stretch. There
[02:43:47] you go. No, it for whatever reason I had
[02:43:49] to refresh my order history for it to
[02:43:51] show. Sorry about that, buddy. That's
[02:43:53] why you guys are here. you guys keep me
[02:43:54] uh honest and correct on this cuz you
[02:43:57] know sometimes when you got a bunch of
[02:43:58] things you're talking to a bunch of
[02:43:59] different people I I sometimes miss
[02:44:00] those so I appreciate
[02:44:02] that. Take the leather into town. I like
[02:44:04] it. Take that leather going into town.
[02:44:08] You fed the rat. The rat wanders away.
[02:44:10] Not really doing anything. Doesn't care.
[02:44:12] Flicker Wisp Starlight Angel. That's a
[02:44:15] nice retro there.
[02:44:18] Alchemist Retrieval, Specimen Collector,
[02:44:21] Graves Shift, Tortured Existence, Nice
[02:44:25] Retro again, Gothan Raiders, Ardent
[02:44:28] Elementalist, Gaia's
[02:44:30] Embrace, Symbiosis. I remember the hour
[02:44:33] card on that one actually. Circuit
[02:44:36] Mentor, Charming Prince. Ooh, if I
[02:44:39] remember, that's a nice little pickup.
[02:44:41] Sakan, Fireb Blood, Whiteboarder for a
[02:44:45] Planaines Walker, too.
[02:44:47] Oh, and a grinding station. That used to
[02:44:50] be like a $20 hit with a ball bolt fire
[02:44:53] for your test card. Dude, I think that
[02:44:55] was a good pack, my friend.
[02:44:59] Stretch. I like it. There we go. Let me
[02:45:04] put your uh sakarn and your grinding
[02:45:08] station in a top loader here, cuz I do
[02:45:11] believe those were good ones. Nice one
[02:45:14] to take over. I like it. Taking it into
[02:45:15] the uh taking that leather over to the
[02:45:17] over the town
[02:45:19] there. Heading into town with the
[02:45:21] leather you got
[02:45:22] JM. All right, let me get these back in
[02:45:25] the bag. Yeah. And I'm going to put you
[02:45:27] with the rest of your stuff. Stretch.
[02:45:29] That was a good pickup there. Grinding
[02:45:31] station. Nice, buddy. All right, let me
[02:45:33] get you over here with your stuff.
[02:45:38] Stretch. So, stretch. There you go, my
[02:45:42] friend. You decide. Uh, did you decide
[02:45:44] what you wanted to do with your um your
[02:45:46] person that wandered by? Now, our other
[02:45:48] friend, you haven't you're near each
[02:45:51] other, but not really exactly right near
[02:45:52] each other cuz somebody's at the end of
[02:45:54] the of this of the little town there.
[02:45:56] You made it into the town, my friend.
[02:45:58] JM, there's a couple of you all playing
[02:46:01] in here, but and you happen to have um
[02:46:03] some leather. head into town and you
[02:46:06] happen to bump
[02:46:09] into a
[02:46:11] um this little black market trader
[02:46:13] that's been hanging out
[02:46:15] there. Try to trade it for a bow and
[02:46:17] arrow. Oh. Ah, that's the first time
[02:46:20] I've seen that. Ask someone asked for
[02:46:21] that. Intriguing. I like it. JM. All
[02:46:23] right. So, you go to this black market
[02:46:25] trader. You go, "Uh, hey
[02:46:29] buddy. How you doing today? I got some
[02:46:31] uh leather here.
[02:46:33] I was wondering if you had any um bow
[02:46:37] and arrows that I could get from
[02:46:40] you. Now stretch, you said you always
[02:46:43] want to go with chaos. So what I'm going
[02:46:45] to do is I'm going to have you jump out
[02:46:46] to shoot them in the back cuz that's a
[02:46:49] chaos type
[02:46:51] thing. So stretch jumps out, goes to
[02:46:55] shoot him in the
[02:46:57] back and it works. Hits him for one
[02:47:00] damage though.
[02:47:02] that goes from 15 down to 14 for the
[02:47:04] health of that small
[02:47:07] raider. You're though talking and he
[02:47:10] goes, "You know what? That black market
[02:47:11] raider says I'll take that, but I don't
[02:47:13] have a bow and arrow. Um, what I can do
[02:47:16] is I I do scavenge around all over the
[02:47:18] place. So, uh, maybe the next time you
[02:47:20] come back, I'll have a bow and arrow.
[02:47:22] I'm not sure. I do I do a lot of
[02:47:24] scavenging around, but um, if you want
[02:47:26] what I can trade you, if you want it'll
[02:47:28] give you this and I'll give you I'll
[02:47:29] give you 15 pogs. That way uh when I
[02:47:32] come come back with a bow and arrow, we
[02:47:33] can trade the 15 pogs and you can get
[02:47:35] the bow and
[02:47:39] arrow.
[02:47:41] Now I am waiting for stretch. He doesn't
[02:47:44] let me know. He shot him in the back
[02:47:45] there. Small small raider. You going to
[02:47:49] shoot him again? I say you said you
[02:47:51] going to always go with chaos, right? So
[02:47:53] you're going to have to shoot him again,
[02:47:55] but this time you miss and that small
[02:47:58] raider turns around to shoot you.
[02:48:04] O. Oh, no.
[02:48:09] Stretch stretch that small
[02:48:13] raider. They turned around with your
[02:48:15] chaos that you said you were going to
[02:48:18] wreak and um they shoot you. Now we have
[02:48:22] to see the D4. Oh
[02:48:25] no, that was five.
[02:48:30] And also a multiplication factor of
[02:48:32] four. You were just hit for 20 health,
[02:48:34] my
[02:48:37] friend. Ah,
[02:48:45] stretch. You just hit for 20 health, my
[02:48:49] friend. And then you uh JM's like, "You
[02:48:52] know what, buddy? How about
[02:48:54] um if you do 20
[02:48:57] pogs? I think I can do 20 pogs. He goes,
[02:49:00] "You know what? Maybe I I might be able
[02:49:02] to." So, I need you from JM tell me high
[02:49:05] or low because you're going to have a
[02:49:07] luck roll to see if he takes that deal
[02:49:09] for you um on the D20
[02:49:13] dice. What happens if you die? You lose
[02:49:17] all of your stuff and you have to start
[02:49:19] from the beginning of whatever you're
[02:49:21] doing. Maybe you'll be lucky where
[02:49:23] there'll be a friend around that can
[02:49:24] gather some of your stuff and you only
[02:49:26] just kind of lose your buffs and things,
[02:49:28] but that's what happens
[02:49:31] there. We haven't had anybody die yet
[02:49:33] cuz most of the time we've had somebody
[02:49:34] get down to nine health though. I mean,
[02:49:36] they were close to done. Big
[02:49:40] BK low. All right, he almost died. All
[02:49:44] right, you roll for the low JM.
[02:49:48] Oh no,
[02:49:50] JM that black market trader goes, you
[02:49:53] know what? It's 15. That's the deal. 15
[02:49:57] pogs. You let me know if you take a
[02:50:03] JM. Call the little one. Ask if he needs
[02:50:07] anything. You know, hey, dude. Do you
[02:50:09] need anything? I I didn't mean to. That
[02:50:10] was an accident. I didn't mean to shoot
[02:50:11] at you. That was just that was just I I
[02:50:14] was looking. I was hiding. I got scared.
[02:50:15] I turned and the gun went off. I mean, I
[02:50:17] I barely even hit you. He's like, "Yeah,
[02:50:20] yeah, yeah, yeah." All right. Well, I
[02:50:22] don't really need anything, but how's
[02:50:24] this? Since you shot me, if you give me
[02:50:26] five rounds, I'll leave you
[02:50:28] alone. That way, I don't have to need
[02:50:31] That way I can make up for uh your
[02:50:34] little mistake you made there. Yes, that
[02:50:38] was a
[02:50:41] mistake. You going to keep the leather?
[02:50:43] All right, then. Decide to keep the
[02:50:45] leather. That's all right. He said, "All
[02:50:47] right, no problem." But hey, if you ever
[02:50:48] want uh come back again, you happen to
[02:50:50] see me around, uh I might have that bow
[02:50:51] for
[02:50:55] you. So, you asked him, you did that, my
[02:50:58] friends. And we are wandering around
[02:51:00] here in the
[02:51:02] wasteland. And how is the um question
[02:51:06] for my wife, how is the current right
[02:51:07] now? How's the what current
[02:51:10] coming
[02:51:12] in? 11:00 high tide. 11:00 high tide. So
[02:51:15] that's around probably 1 1ish is
[02:51:18] probably when I'll be able to go down
[02:51:19] and get it. Yep. Okay. Be bright.
[02:51:22] Hopefully sunny. Yep. Hopefully warm.
[02:51:24] Trying to figure out when um slack tide
[02:51:26] is so that I can dive down underneath my
[02:51:28] boat and pull a line out that got
[02:51:29] wrapped around either the rudder or the
[02:51:31] prop.
[02:51:33] Yeah. You start walking away hoping he
[02:51:36] changes mind. He walks away. You you
[02:51:38] walk away uh from him and he uh looks at
[02:51:41] you and he's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:51:42] Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. How's this?
[02:51:45] I'll give you
[02:51:46] um the 20 pogs,
[02:51:50] but I will
[02:51:53] um I'll need something from you in
[02:51:55] return. We've been having uh some junk,
[02:51:58] some rat issues in the back over here.
[02:52:01] Uh every time they come out, they run
[02:52:02] around the town at night and they um
[02:52:05] they take all of our stuff, take some of
[02:52:07] our food, spread disease. You think you
[02:52:11] can handle us handle that in the uh the
[02:52:13] small town? take care of
[02:52:18] those. There you go. There you get your
[02:52:20] 20 by doing that. All right, my friends.
[02:52:22] Let's see what you're doing here.
[02:52:25] Hopefully, you're all having a good
[02:52:29] one. Call out the little one. Ask if he
[02:52:31] needs anything. That's up to you if he
[02:52:32] needs anything. I don't ever know what
[02:52:33] they need. It's always on you what they
[02:52:35] need and
[02:52:36] do. So, the little one does not really
[02:52:40] need anything. He said he offered you
[02:52:41] the bullets there. Now, you said you'd
[02:52:43] choose chaos, but it seems like you're
[02:52:44] trying to get a way out. And I know you
[02:52:45] said you're at work, so I'm going to go
[02:52:47] with stretch gives
[02:52:49] him the ammo. All right, so stretch, you
[02:52:53] now have only two rounds of pistol
[02:52:56] ammo
[02:52:59] left. And that uh small raider turns
[02:53:02] around. He goes, "All right, fine. I'll
[02:53:04] take it. I'll walk away."
[02:53:07] And that small raider wanders away
[02:53:11] there.
[02:53:13] Stretch and leaves you at 80 health by
[02:53:16] the way because of the shot
[02:53:18] there. So you got to decide what you all
[02:53:21] like to
[02:53:22] do. And this is what we're going to do
[02:53:26] now. Actually, we're going to uh run a
[02:53:29] little bit of
[02:53:30] this. You'll take care of them. You say,
[02:53:32] "Ah, I like it." So you talk to that
[02:53:35] black market trader and you go, "All
[02:53:36] right, I can take care of those." And
[02:53:38] you start heading towards the end of the
[02:53:41] small town where he pointed to where
[02:53:42] they were coming
[02:53:47] from. Now you're heading over there and
[02:53:52] as you head that direction, buildings
[02:53:54] start burning out a little bit more. You
[02:53:56] see less of the town and more of kind of
[02:53:58] what was left overish. Can we see what
[02:54:00] goes on any further as we head through
[02:54:03] this wasteland and see how we are going?
[02:54:05] Carmichael coming in. I like it. Car I
[02:54:08] keep saying Michael. Car Malcolm coming
[02:54:11] in with an infinity and a side
[02:54:15] quest. So Car Malcolm, I like it. You've
[02:54:20] been wandering around there. You got
[02:54:21] yourself some pistols, some other things
[02:54:23] like that. And you now have yourself a
[02:54:26] side quest, Car Malcolm. All right.
[02:54:30] We're going to open this up and see what
[02:54:31] you get here, my friend. Good luck.
[02:54:34] Let's get you some shocks. Rat in the
[02:54:36] hat, motion sickness, hat trick, grabby
[02:54:40] tabby, minotaur defors glitter flitter
[02:54:43] ticking, meme bomb, mime bomb, park
[02:54:46] bleet, make a blank splash, Öza's
[02:54:49] funhouse. Nice little pickup there on
[02:54:51] the Arizona's fun house with a mountain
[02:54:54] for your uh land costume shop trivia
[02:54:58] contest. Scared
[02:55:01] stiff for a foil treasure token and your
[02:55:05] sticker is in the back
[02:55:06] there. There you go, Car
[02:55:09] Malcolm. Now, my friend, you uh you
[02:55:12] would have been wandering around here,
[02:55:13] Car Malcolm. You were in the um you were
[02:55:15] in that burnt out building, I believe,
[02:55:17] area. You had bumped into a few
[02:55:20] different things. You found yourself a
[02:55:22] bench and got yourself some throwing
[02:55:24] knives that um you had handed over to
[02:55:27] that ghoul. Kind of trying to befriend
[02:55:29] the ghoul that you uh that you let
[02:55:30] wander away there. So, you're down to
[02:55:33] just the pistol that you have left.
[02:55:37] Well, two pistols you have
[02:55:40] left. Oh, you're going to be the pi
[02:55:42] piper of the rats. Want have them follow
[02:55:44] you out of
[02:55:46] town? Not a bad idea.
[02:55:49] You going to get out
[02:55:51] uh you go pi piper the uh them all away,
[02:55:57] huh? There you go, Carmichael. Car
[02:56:00] Malcolm, there's all your stuff
[02:56:03] there. So, you head out to the end of
[02:56:05] the town there. You do see some uh trash
[02:56:07] piles in the back there. Now, Car
[02:56:11] Malcolm, you have uh you're coming in
[02:56:13] and you're in this city area and you
[02:56:14] yourself though, you bump into one of
[02:56:19] these things floating around. These are
[02:56:20] one of the handy helper bots left over
[02:56:23] from uh generations before you. They
[02:56:26] still seem to be floating around. They
[02:56:27] run on nuclear energy. No one knows how
[02:56:30] when they're going to die or if they're
[02:56:32] ever going to. He bumps into you, hey.
[02:56:35] You see him right in front of you.
[02:56:41] What are you going to do, Car
[02:56:45] Malcolm? All right. Now, you follow
[02:56:47] those
[02:56:48] rats out of
[02:56:50] town. And what happens is you find in
[02:56:54] one of the houses that's burnt out a
[02:56:56] bunch of trash and seven more rats. But
[02:57:00] one of those rats happen to be the one
[02:57:02] that you gave some food to earlier.
[02:57:06] None of the rats go to attack you
[02:57:07] though. Luckily, because you must nice.
[02:57:10] You gave him food. Now, Car
[02:57:14] Malcolm, you ran into the helper
[02:57:20] bot. Ah, the helper bot goes, "Oh, I'm
[02:57:23] just all my all my controllers, they
[02:57:25] died years ago, and I've just been
[02:57:27] wandering around this uh this world,
[02:57:29] helping everybody I can along the way.
[02:57:32] um and uh you know doing whatever I can
[02:57:34] for you. I can do some things like I've
[02:57:36] been able to uh upgrade weapons
[02:57:37] successfully if you have the right
[02:57:39] items. Um say you have all multiple
[02:57:42] chips, mystery chips and some uh some
[02:57:45] metal and some leather. We can do some
[02:57:47] upgrading. But uh right now the only
[02:57:50] thing that I have is uh if you can find
[02:57:52] some extra electronic components
[02:57:54] anywhere that'll help because I need to
[02:57:57] get some more chips made because I'm
[02:58:00] running low.
[02:58:01] So,
[02:58:04] Malcolm, you get a side
[02:58:07] quest of
[02:58:15] finding four mystery chips. I mean, uh,
[02:58:20] no, four, not mystery chips. Four,
[02:58:26] um, four tech
[02:58:28] scraps. You need four tech scraps of
[02:58:31] some kind. All
[02:58:32] right. Looking for some rats in the
[02:58:34] back. All right. So, you found the rats.
[02:58:37] No one's there. They're not doing
[02:58:38] anything to harm you, JM. So, you got to
[02:58:41] let me
[02:58:42] know what you going to do. They're all
[02:58:44] just kind of staring at you. You do have
[02:58:46] another ration
[02:58:49] still. All right. Here we go, everybody.
[02:58:53] And
[02:58:54] then we're going to go and uh continue
[02:58:57] on here with what we're doing. been

[02:59:02] adventuring. All righty, let me uh grab

[02:59:15] more coffee. So, that being said, you
[02:59:20] are all making decisions on what you
[02:59:22] want to do for your characters.
[02:59:26] And with that being said and making
[02:59:28] those decisions, I am going to run one

[02:59:44] food. Those giant gar rats take the food
[02:59:47] that you pro provided them with. They
[02:59:49] eat it happily. And they all kind of
[02:59:51] stand there on their back legs looking

[03:09:43] it, I keep saying Carmichael. Car
[03:09:45] Malcolm took
[03:09:47] on the uh the encounter there and
[03:09:50] decided they were going
[03:09:51] to take the side quest of finding some
[03:09:54] scrap tech items.
[03:10:02] I don't know why. It's just like your
[03:10:03] name says that.
[03:10:09] Ah, I like it. So, you wander out of the
[03:10:12] city. Okay. And um right out of that
[03:10:16] burnt out buildings. And you know what?
[03:10:19] Let's do this since we haven't had this
[03:10:22] before.
[03:10:43] Let's do
[03:10:44] this. I think um I think we that
[03:10:47] deserves that deserves uh some friend
[03:10:49] type image there.
[03:10:55] All
[03:10:56] righty, let's go. And let me get that
[03:10:59] out. Let's
[03:11:06] see. I like this one. This is what we're
[03:11:09] going to
[03:11:15] use. All right. Give me a second. And
[03:11:18] there's going to be an
[03:11:19] image. All righty.
[03:11:22] All right. So, Car Malcolm, you took on
[03:11:24] the quest. You need to wander around.
[03:11:26] So, you you you just head back around in
[03:11:28] the, you know, the burnt out buildings,
[03:11:29] wandering through the towns, the
[03:11:30] wasteland there, seeing the different
[03:11:32] things along the way. I don't not really
[03:11:34] knowing what's going on. Having some
[03:11:35] fun, being
[03:11:38] silly, and quarter member. That's a good
[03:11:41] pickup. Brass's
[03:11:43] bounty. Those are good ones, too. Yeah,
[03:11:46] we have uh like a brass's bounty here.
[03:11:48] I'll grab those out. All right. All
[03:11:50] right, here we're getting one second
[03:11:52] here. I'm getting you an image for that.
[03:11:54] There we
[03:11:58] go. Ah, well, I was guessing you were
[03:12:01] you'd had something to do with them on a
[03:12:02] regular basis. That's why I was like,
[03:12:05] uh, that's why I made the comment.
[03:12:07] That's why I was I was adding a little
[03:12:09] extra like here what we said we'd add.
[03:12:11] Here we
[03:12:16] go. So, these will come out. Not not not
[03:12:19] all the time. Not on a regular basis,
[03:12:21] this will happen. But
[03:12:23] oh, we uh this feels like it's a new
[03:12:25] scenario that you need to uh unlock
[03:12:28] since you were putting such effort into
[03:12:30] befriending the rats. You now have a a
[03:12:33] rat's nest here that has been uh created
[03:12:36] out in the wasteland under a little
[03:12:38] burnt out bush with some food in front
[03:12:39] of it. You fried it. They're just uh you
[03:12:42] know, eating, being happy there, our
[03:12:44] friend
[03:12:46] JM. And then let me get this out for our
[03:12:49] buddy
[03:12:52] Brass. Brass's tunnel
[03:12:55] grinder. All right. B Brass's tunnel.
[03:12:58] Brass's bounty. No, Brass's bounty. And
[03:13:01] then we have right after that one a
[03:13:03] quarter of Emmerth. Oh, that's a good
[03:13:04] one, too.
[03:13:06] Yeah, I've got over a thousand singles
[03:13:08] in my buy now for those that like them.
[03:13:10] I didn't want like that type of stuff.
[03:13:16] Um,
[03:13:21] we can open some dust more. Let me take
[03:13:22] a look if anybody's bought purchased any
[03:13:24] here. If we have had any gun, we can
[03:13:26] open some of the dust. If not, uh, let
[03:13:28] me take a look and we'll see. Maybe
[03:13:29] we'll get to some dustorn at some point
[03:13:31] here in a little bit. But let me, uh,
[03:13:34] find the other court of emberth here. C.
[03:13:38] Yes, court of embrath. I think it is
[03:13:41] this one. 32. Yes, it is. Nice pickup
[03:13:44] there, my friend. There you go, JM
[03:13:49] Ry. We'll get those um protected to ship
[03:13:52] out for you, my
[03:13:56] friend. Right. Add that
[03:13:59] there.
[03:14:02] John
[03:14:05] Ry
[03:14:08] 26536. There you
[03:14:10] go. There you go, my friends.
[03:14:16] So, yes. So, now you got yourself that
[03:14:17] little uh you got that little nest
[03:14:19] there, JM. You've created out in the uh
[03:14:21] the wasteland. I don't know. Maybe
[03:14:23] you're able to go back to them at some
[03:14:25] point. Maybe you uh maybe maybe they
[03:14:27] befriend you and they start following
[03:14:29] you. Who knows what really happens, but
[03:14:31] I'm guessing since it's a nest, then you
[03:14:33] know where it is. You might end up uh I
[03:14:35] don't know. You could you could help out
[03:14:37] some more if you end up in more and you
[03:14:40] can be the uh pi piper of the wasteland.
[03:14:42] We'll have to make you a Here. Let's do
[03:14:45] this. Now, I'm just using your name, JM

[03:17:48] do some of these things in the US. And
[03:17:49] then eventually we'll do, uh, some of
[03:17:51] the stuff in other locations. But right
[03:17:53] now, we're we're kind of getting going
[03:17:54] here.
[03:17:56] We have been in the Caribbean doing
[03:17:58] this. I actually have been down in um
[03:18:00] Puerto Rico, St. Thomas. Um we've been
[03:18:03] to British Virgin Islands. We were in
[03:18:06] the Bahamas for a bit with you guys.
[03:18:08] We'll be back to the Bahamas hopefully
[03:18:10] in the not too distant future here. I'm
[03:18:12] hoping my solar arch actually gets
[03:18:15] delivered that we've paid for and
[03:18:17] ordered. But I don't know. See what
[03:18:18] happens.
[03:18:21] Hopefully it's not Yeah. Hopefully it's
[03:18:22] like today it shows up. not like a few
[03:18:25] day a few like another week like uh just
[03:18:27] it's just for hope hopefully we get good
[03:18:29] luck that's all I'm saying that's kind
[03:18:31] of cool that's one of our plans is to
[03:18:32] sail around the world I've always wanted
[03:18:34] to since I was younger told my wife when
[03:18:36] I first met her and she kind of thought
[03:18:37] it was a great idea but uh never really
[03:18:40] jumped on it
[03:18:41] until recently and now we're doing some
[03:18:44] stuff and at least in the Bahamas in the
[03:18:46] um the US we're sailing
[03:18:48] around she actually uh does a a channel
[03:18:50] for the family too uh that bigger boat
[03:18:53] adventure
[03:18:54] She has a channel there for the family
[03:18:56] that uh if you guys want to follow that
[03:18:57] type of thing. Dustorn collectors are
[03:19:00] awesome. There's a lot of good stuff in
[03:19:01] them. I always like the just the the
[03:19:04] rooms themselves. I think those are a uh
[03:19:08] like a a car cards that are not at the
[03:19:12] value they could be at. I feel like they
[03:19:14] have better play and they haven't been
[03:19:15] figured out yet. If that makes sense. I
[03:19:17] haven't I'm I don't know. It's one of
[03:19:18] those
[03:19:21] uh it's like you got a feeling of
[03:19:23] something,
[03:19:25] right? All right. Well, this is the
[03:19:27] image that it made. Well, I got to find
[03:19:30] the one. Okay, we go. Oh. Oh, I like
[03:19:32] that
[03:19:34] one. Oh,
[03:19:36] well, that's kind of funny. Let's see if
[03:19:40] I use this
[03:19:42] one. We're going to go with this one. I
[03:19:44] use a little I use some stuff. if I make
[03:19:46] some images for these that quickly. It
[03:19:47] should normally takes a few minutes
[03:19:48] generally, but there you go. We got you
[03:19:51] going there. We'll run another one of
[03:19:52] the surprise sets for those that you
[03:19:54] want to try uh see what's going on here.
[03:19:56] We do a little thing. You get your packs
[03:19:59] and you get to play along with an
[03:20:01] adventure if you want. So, we'll go and
[03:20:04] see what uh occurs here. Right now, we
[03:20:06] have Car Malcolm, I almost said it
[03:20:09] right, wrong
[03:20:10] again, has been uh given a quest from a
[03:20:13] handy
[03:20:14] helperbot. Our friend uh JM is wandering
[03:20:18] around the
[03:20:20] wasteland.
[03:20:22] Um
[03:20:24] and they Well, this is what it gave me.
[03:20:26] We'll see what happens
[03:20:28] here. Here we
[03:20:31] go. This is what they provided me for
[03:20:33] the pi piper.
[03:20:43] All right, here we go.
[03:20:45] Put that in
[03:20:47] here. Get that down there.
[03:20:51] Hopefully hopefully this is uh
[03:20:53] acceptable here. We'll find out. I don't
[03:20:55] even know why it gave a female, which is
[03:20:58] kind of interesting. So, I just said a
[03:21:01] wasteland survivor, but I guess they
[03:21:03] took the pied piper as being female.
[03:21:08] Yeah. So, we can always change it. This
[03:21:11] isn't an in makeup game. You can tell me
[03:21:13] you can tell me kind of what you want to
[03:21:14] look like, too. And we can uh make it
[03:21:15] that way. But there we go. We'll put
[03:21:17] that one in there quickly. I'm going to
[03:21:18] put you in as one of the players
[03:21:20] befriending them. And you know, who
[03:21:21] knows what will befriending them. And
[03:21:23] you know, who knows what will happen
[03:21:24] with those rats. You know, they maybe
[03:21:26] those might she might end up riding them
[03:21:28] into battle in the future here. You
[03:21:29] know, it's the wasteland. They they're
[03:21:31] mutated. Those might be the babies that
[03:21:32] she just befriended.
[03:21:35] See guys, there's what we're talking
[03:21:36] about. Sometimes in the wasteland, you
[03:21:37] do something nice, something might come
[03:21:40] back to help you. Who
[03:21:42] knows? All right, there you go, my
[03:21:45] friend. So, you got that. We'll run
[03:21:48] another and the Brothers War for Yeetss
[03:21:50] coming out. Let me get you over here. I
[03:21:54] see you with that one. And you can tell

[03:24:30] Yes. Yes. And uh you talked to Big BK.
[03:24:35] Now Big BK took your chips, your uh took

[03:25:10] bar or something around.

[03:25:17] make sure we do that. Um, here, let's uh
[03:25:20] you can check out Rev Tank.
[03:25:28] There you go. Check them out there.
[03:25:31] All
[03:25:32] righty. And
[03:25:36] yeeps, you have a little encounter there
[03:25:38] while you're in
[03:25:41] there. Had to wait for it. I had to wait
[03:25:43] for an notification to go away. So, I
[03:25:45] didn't change my application. Tech
[03:25:47] specialist is in there and you turn to
[03:25:49] leave. You finally got all your stuff.
[03:25:52] And the uh out there in front though,
[03:25:54] you bump into one of the other raiders
[03:25:56] is a small raider.
[03:25:58] And they're like, "Hey,
[03:26:02] thought you weren't supposed to be in
[03:26:03] here. I thought you were
[03:26:05] leaving." And ye, you're standing
[03:26:09] there with your axe kind of slapping
[03:26:12] against your hand like, "Ah, nothing,
[03:26:14] buddy." But you need to let me know if
[03:26:16] you want to make this uh a problem or
[03:26:18] does want to want her out.
[03:26:25] Yes, I do actually. So, if you go into
[03:26:27] the buy now troll and type decks, you
[03:26:30] should see a good amount of commander
[03:26:31] decks actually in there. I have uh
[03:26:34] probably a half a dozen to a 10 half 10
[03:26:36] or 10 or less somewhere around there.
[03:26:39] They're all different ones. Some of them
[03:26:40] are duplicates, but yeah, we do have
[03:26:41] them in there if you want to
[03:26:44] look. And uh my friend there, you walk
[03:26:47] back and let's get you uh let's do that
[03:26:49] then.
[03:26:56] There you go. Let's do this. I like
[03:26:57] this. We'll do that
[03:27:02] one. Oh, you look at him go, "What? You
[03:27:05] a problem? I'm here. What are you going
[03:27:06] to do? How you going to solve it?" He
[03:27:09] looks at you and goes, "Uh, well, I can
[03:27:12] do
[03:27:13] this." And he
[03:27:16] goes, "Carre wreck."
[03:27:19] And Carvick comes wandering
[03:27:23] out, looks at you and goes, "You're
[03:27:25] vaguely familiar. Think I've seen you
[03:27:28] somewhere
[03:27:30] before." Pauses for a second before he
[03:27:32] uh does what you were expecting. All
[03:27:34] right, here we go. We're getting your uh
[03:27:36] the bar here for
[03:27:43] you. I like this one. We're going to do
[03:27:45] this
[03:27:46] one. Here we go. Give that a minute and
[03:27:49] we'll have that here. You do find a bar.
[03:27:52] That's a good idea. You wander in, you
[03:27:53] find a bar in the small
[03:27:58] town. And this is what we're going to
[03:28:01] have to
[03:28:07] do. Go. Where's the image? Ah, there it
[03:28:11] is. There we go. That's what we're going
[03:28:14] to do.
[03:28:15] kicking me off. So, what are you going
[03:28:18] to do with that warlord there? He looked
[03:28:20] at you. He's like, "You look familiar."
[03:28:23] Oh, no problem, Rev. It's up to you,
[03:28:25] Yep. I'm I'm waiting on your response to
[03:28:27] him.
[03:28:29] All right, let's get you a
[03:28:35] uh small town
[03:28:37] bar. Let's add that in there.
[03:28:42] find the
[03:28:43] uh small town
[03:28:46] bar.
[03:28:52] Oh, you walk back into town. Let's get
[03:28:55] this uh over here for you. Find a small
[03:28:57] town bar hanging out in
[03:28:58] there,
[03:29:02] JM. And take a
[03:29:05] seat. And uh
[03:29:07] Yep. What are you going to do? the
[03:29:09] warlord is standing there in front of
[03:29:11] you like I does not really going to do
[03:29:12] anything at the moment but uh he does
[03:29:14] seem like he like recognizes you from
[03:29:17] somewhere. I don't know if you I think
[03:29:18] did isn't this guy you you beat to get
[03:29:20] his axe at one point?
[03:29:23] Looks like he may have regenerated.
[03:29:43] He looks at him. He looks at he's like,
[03:29:46] "Everybody thinks they killed Carvik.
[03:29:48] Carvik never
[03:29:51] dies." And you just kind of look at
[03:29:54] him. You slap your
[03:29:56] axe against your hand and go, "Well,
[03:30:00] your axe is a little upgraded this time
[03:30:01] and it's now mine.
[03:30:08] All right. Now, ye, remember, you do
[03:30:10] have one guaranteed blast with your uh
[03:30:13] your weapon, which gives you that plasma
[03:30:15] shock wave. Or you've kind of been
[03:30:16] befriending these people. He's not ready
[03:30:18] to fight yet. You could just say, you
[03:30:20] know, you wander out and let it be. Just
[03:30:23] be like, you know, I'm heading on my way
[03:30:24] out here. We'll uh see you another time.
[03:30:27] Or you can uh go into battle with them.
[03:30:29] Now
[03:30:30] remember, if you do go into battle,
[03:30:32] there are there's still the tech
[03:30:34] specialist, the little guy there, that's
[03:30:37] your armory, and your commander, who is
[03:30:40] Carvik there. There's potentially a
[03:30:43] scavenger randomly that snuck in a
[03:30:44] doorway, and some other things up in the
[03:30:46] corner you don't know really anything
[03:30:47] about
[03:30:51] yet. Yes, he was a boss. You definitely
[03:30:53] would need some more people, I know. I
[03:30:56] know.
[03:30:59] So, all right. JM, you found Anyways,
[03:31:00] well, JM did
[03:31:02] find JM found the bar in town. Sits
[03:31:06] down, says, "Hey, buddy. Mind if I grab
[03:31:08] a
[03:31:11] drink?" The bar
[03:31:14] says, "Yeah, sure. Five uh five pogs.
[03:31:17] It's wasteland currency." And they'll
[03:31:19] give you a bottle of
[03:31:21] whiskey. Now, the bottle of
[03:31:24] whiskey is not full, so it won't give
[03:31:26] you full health return. It only give you
[03:31:28] uh 30 health in return, but it makes you
[03:31:31] dumber and it also makes you
[03:31:36] slower. Yeah, why not? You guys could
[03:31:39] help a little bit if you needed. But,
[03:31:41] one of the things though is I am going
[03:31:42] to be done here in a few minutes cuz I
[03:31:44] have to get some stuff done with the
[03:31:45] boat and I do have to head out and get
[03:31:48] those things accomplished. So, I'm going
[03:31:49] to say like about probably about uh do
[03:31:52] this here. When that is over, when 5
[03:31:55] minutes is up, about 5 minutes and we'll
[03:31:57] be over here. So, I only have a little
[03:31:58] bit of time left. And Rev Tank, yeah,
[03:32:01] Rev Tank is a good good
[03:32:04] player. Rev says hi to you.
[03:32:07] Hey. Hi. Hello.
[03:32:12] All righty. Well, we're
[03:32:15] uh hang around. when you find you got
[03:32:17] your person in front of you.
[03:32:25] All right, you guys me and mug each
[03:32:26] other. I like it. I like it. So, uh,
[03:32:31] Yeetseps, I'm staring him down.
[03:32:34] Carve it.
[03:32:39] Come on. Scares stairs Yeeps
[03:32:42] down. And there's just silence for a
[03:32:44] second.
[03:32:49] Then Neb turns and
[03:32:55] leaves. That's it. Nothing happens. The
[03:32:58] little guy goes, "Hey, what's up, boss?"
[03:33:00] And he doesn't say anything. He just
[03:33:02] watches you leave. Hey, Boop. How's it
[03:33:04] going? Oh, have a good one, my friend.
[03:33:07] JM, thank you for coming in hanging out.
[03:33:09] I do appreciate it. Much appreciated day
[03:33:11] and have have a good time running your
[03:33:12] errands. Bye.
[03:33:17] Yes. Got to run errands, too. Me, too.
[03:33:19] We need to do our own. Got your little
[03:33:22] waddle in there. Boop. Coming in to hang
[03:33:25] out. So, you turn to
[03:33:28] leave and you decide, all right, head
[03:33:30] out of that Vault
[03:33:33] Armory. And you go and you're heading on
[03:33:36] out. And as you're wandering
[03:33:40] out, you walk right past
[03:33:46] a scrapper in the
[03:33:48] background and just sneak out the
[03:33:50] building cuz you just you're done with
[03:33:52] the vault. You're done with this vault
[03:33:54] armory that's uh above ground right now.
[03:33:55] Here it's armory here. You're done. Time
[03:33:57] to
[03:33:58] leave. Well, you can come back to it.
[03:34:01] You're very welcome, JM. And I
[03:34:02] appreciate it a lot. It was a lot of
[03:34:04] fun. Thank you very much. It helps make
[03:34:05] uh when you guys are involved helps make
[03:34:07] everything a lot more fun. So, thank
[03:34:08] you. I very much appreciate that.
[03:34:12] Um
[03:34:14] You're going to come back later. That's
[03:34:15] why I figured go grab some more friends
[03:34:17] and then come back in a little bit, huh?
[03:34:20] All right. Well, you know where Carvick
[03:34:22] is and he's a tough guy. You guys had to
[03:34:24] What was it? How many of you had to take
[03:34:26] him on last time? I think it was four of
[03:34:28] you or five of you that took him on and
[03:34:30] you barely even you barely won, right?
[03:34:32] Cuz if you guys remember, Carvik calls
[03:34:35] on his
[03:34:37] minions whenever he needs to come and
[03:34:40] help. So, you got to remember Carvik is
[03:34:43] not uh not
[03:34:45] alone being one of the uh warlords of
[03:34:48] the Iron
[03:34:50] Fang. Those are the warlord gang. High
[03:34:54] five.
[03:34:56] Is that the AC? That's the AC, right?
[03:34:58] Yeah, I said high five.
[03:35:02] You are
[03:35:03] still You are still in the bed there
[03:35:05] with the Vault Born Booper. That is
[03:35:07] correct.
[03:35:11] All right. So, you turn around, yep. You
[03:35:12] turn back. Head out to leave. Then,
[03:35:16] let's see this. We have one, two, three,
[03:35:18] four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[03:35:20] Going to get one more here.
[03:35:26] This sounds weird. Popcorn.
[03:35:29] Doesn't it sound a little weird when you
[03:35:31] No.
[03:35:33] Yeah. Maybe a
[03:35:34] little probably. Yeah.
[03:35:40] Uh got some snow last night. Yep. We had
[03:35:43] what we think there's a tornado that
[03:35:45] went up by us. Yeah. Um we had a tornado
[03:35:47] go by us yesterday
[03:35:50] actual
[03:35:52] potentially.
[03:35:55] I can't do anything when it comes uh to
[03:35:58] the shipping stuff. If you bought one
[03:36:00] thing though, you shouldn't get things
[03:36:02] added together with shipping. It should
[03:36:03] just be under one shipping thing. It
[03:36:05] just tells you how much it is for each
[03:36:06] thing for shipping. Um, but you should
[03:36:08] have it as one thing together, but I
[03:36:10] can't put it from like different shows
[03:36:11] together or from like um from a show and
[03:36:15] an order purchase in the store. But for
[03:36:17] whatever reason, whatnot doesn't allow
[03:36:18] me to combine things like that.
[03:36:21] Um, resting does help you out with your
[03:36:23] health. That is true. It does boop.
[03:36:25] You're right. So, boop, my
[03:36:28] friend. Smart person they
[03:36:33] are. Let get you over here.
[03:36:39] Yeah, I know.
[03:36:42] [Music]
[03:36:44] I've been actually moving some of them
[03:36:46] over to a new sheet to make it easier.
[03:36:48] Boop. You rest and you go back up. You
[03:36:51] went up back up to your full health
[03:36:52] there. I like
[03:36:55] it. And let's see who our winner is
[03:36:58] here. Alyssa Given, a number between 1
[03:37:02] and 10, my friend.
[03:37:08] It shouldn't have to do that unless
[03:37:14] um it shouldn't be
[03:37:16] that. And if it is, you can uh we can I
[03:37:19] I you can ask whatnot, but it should not
[03:37:22] be that for a two of them or one card.
[03:37:25] Anything under that should be a lot
[03:37:27] less. Number six. One, two, three, four,
[03:37:29] five, six. You got the
[03:37:32] ghosting covetous castaway for you, my
[03:37:35] friend Alyssa. Nice little foil to spice
[03:37:37] your deck
[03:37:39] up. So, what I'm thinking is um
[03:37:44] Oh, house. I was literally going to
[03:37:47] leave and raid into you house.
[03:37:49] Seriously,
[03:37:53] I was about to head out and go over to
[03:37:55] you.
[03:38:00] You beat me to it. I know. All right,
[03:38:02] then. Fine. I'll hang out. I'll do one
[03:38:04] more one more giveaway here that we
[03:38:06] have. One of our things that we normally
[03:38:08] do. That's funny. And yeah, and I will
[03:38:12] do that and then we'll find someone to
[03:38:13] go hang out with. All
[03:38:16] right. It should combine them all
[03:38:18] together as one order for um for all of
[03:38:23] them. So, it might be like that amount
[03:38:25] of money, but it's for how of them all
[03:38:27] of them together, if that makes sense
[03:38:29] for your for the shipping for the
[03:38:30] singles, but I um the way I set it up
[03:38:34] was that you're supposed to be able to
[03:38:35] get two singles at the low like PWE
[03:38:38] shipping price and then after that it um
[03:38:40] it ends up being more because it doesn't
[03:38:42] anytime we do more than that, they ship
[03:38:43] it back to us. So, um that's why we have
[03:38:45] to do it the other way. So, yeah. Hey,
[03:38:47] good morning house. Thanks for coming
[03:38:48] in. I do appreciate you doing the raid
[03:38:50] there. Are they expensive symbols though
[03:38:52] that need to be protected by Yep, they
[03:38:53] are. They're not. They are the They are
[03:38:56] not all top loader ones. So, like some
[03:38:57] of them aren't. So, we can fit them all
[03:38:58] in that, but we should be able to get
[03:39:00] them all in the depending on how many
[03:39:01] they get, it should be a uh combination
[03:39:03] of all of their cards together and the
[03:39:05] price of the shipping, not the price of
[03:39:07] one of their shipping if it's under the
[03:39:09] same show. And that's my understanding
[03:39:11] of it. And that was what I was had to
[03:39:13] explain to me when we kind of started
[03:39:15] doing our stuff here with
[03:39:17] whatnot. So, we got one more. All right.
[03:39:19] Boop.
[03:39:20] Thank you. I hope you have a great one.
[03:39:22] I'll see you guys out. Yeah, check you
[03:39:23] out tomorrow. Make sure you check out
[03:39:24] Rev. You going to be in here tomorrow.
[03:39:29] Sorry, I missed what you said.
[03:39:34] Yes, if it was same
[03:39:36] day, it can combine them in the same
[03:39:39] stream. Correct. Unless that uh unless
[03:39:41] you get some other stuff in the same
[03:39:43] stream. Yes, correct. So, thank you.
[03:39:46] Sorry, the raid came in and I got a
[03:39:47] bunch of people coming in and I lost my
[03:39:49] uh place on where I
[03:39:51] was. So, I'm trying to just catch back

[00:04:04] 15,000 I'm like awesome that made pretty
[00:04:06] much we were going to there's a few
[00:04:07] things wrong that we were going to try

[00:04:11] perfect let's put an offer in so we put
[00:04:13] an offer in well we're flying
[00:04:17] down I guess they end up showing the
[00:04:19] boat to another person while that other
[00:04:21] person puts an offer in also but that
[00:04:25] other person had just you know never
[00:04:26] come there so they dropped the boat then
[00:04:28] showed it to somebody then sold it to
[00:04:30] somebody before we even got
[00:04:34] there while we were on the plane flying
[00:04:37] to see it kind of an [ __ ] move but

[00:04:43] saying she does she goes she goes like
[00:04:44] this she goes a for it it's not effort
[00:04:47] it's
[00:04:49] [ __ ] yeah but
[00:04:52] anyways intriguing story here so uh we
[00:04:56] our flight ended up getting delayed
[00:04:57] coming home yesterday reason why I was a
[00:05:00] little late today um in that delay of
[00:05:02] the coming home look at that t Tim the
[00:05:05] enchanter creature human wizard Tim the
[00:05:07] enchanter deals one damage to any Target
[00:05:09] player I like
[00:05:13] that oh well thank you fat boy I
[00:05:15] appreciate it you know I actually work
[00:05:17] uh do a lot of different things not only
[00:05:19] this but um one of the cool things that
[00:05:22] I do is I have been in it for so many
[00:05:25] years I can do um uh pickup work really
[00:05:28] any whenever I want
[00:05:30] uh a lot of very easily for for it
[00:05:32] because I've done a lot of cool things
[00:05:33] that you don't know about actually I
[00:05:35] can't even tell everybody about actually
[00:05:37] one of the cool things I can tell
[00:05:38] everybody about was uh when I work for
[00:05:40] one of the companies that manages
[00:05:41] Network stuff I got was in I got to help
[00:05:44] JPL fix their servers that kept
[00:05:48] crashing and they weren't able to do any
[00:05:50] of their work on the Mars rer 2020
[00:05:52] project and this was year you know like
[00:05:54] years ago now so I was able to help them
[00:05:56] fix their stuff from crashing you know
[00:05:58] was had to do with the um had to do with
[00:06:00] uh like they they had done an update on
[00:06:01] one of their network devices and it just
[00:06:03] kept forc pretty much the update didn't
[00:06:05] agree with their other stuff and I was
[00:06:06] able to figure it out for them they were
[00:06:07] working out for like a month and I got
[00:06:09] out in like two
[00:06:10] days that looks good thank
[00:06:14] you but yeah the boat there crazy there
[00:06:17] Tim bring out your dead search the
[00:06:21] library for up to three creature cards
[00:06:22] put them into your gravey then shuffle
[00:06:24] oh that's awesome I love
[00:06:27] that so what I ended up doing was um
[00:06:33] with the boat by the way they ended up
[00:06:35] doing that we ended up seeing the boat
[00:06:36] anyways cuz the broker was like going
[00:06:37] and see I actually told when I called
[00:06:39] the broker when he told us that I was
[00:06:40] like you GNA give me a minute I get talk
[00:06:41] to my wife uh we'll call you back his
[00:06:44] butter

[00:06:48] minus five until in turn I like that so
[00:06:50] I talked to Steph and I go as soon as I
[00:06:52] hang the phone up I go we're withdrawing
[00:06:53] our offer she's like what I'm like where
[00:06:54] we're drawing our offer I don't [ __ ]
[00:06:56] play games with people like that she's
[00:06:58] like well uh uh and she kind of really
[00:07:00] didn't want to but uh kind of decided to
[00:07:03] go almost kind of all right fine if that
[00:07:05] you think
[00:07:06] so so I um yeah I know these are so cool
[00:07:10] the art on them I want to see what the
[00:07:11] uh the um other art looks

[00:07:26] pretty funny about this one African
[00:07:28] swallow well and with the boat there we
[00:07:31] ended up uh leaving and um we saw the
[00:07:35] boat anyways CU my wife wanted to
[00:07:38] instead of withdrawing we didn't end up
[00:07:40] getting it but when we were waiting we
[00:07:42] happened to see another boat dropped in
[00:07:44] price that we had looked at before we
[00:07:45] want a Shrubbery you must bring me a
[00:07:51] Shrubbery search your library for a
[00:07:53] forest C put it in the battlefield and
[00:07:55] Shuffle I like

[00:08:22] swallow oh I didn't know you flipped it
[00:08:24] over that's awesome African or european
[00:08:29] good morning Frank how's it going
[00:08:32] buddy oh dude that's awesome thank you
[00:08:34] for telling me to do
[00:08:46] that please don't tell me you got a
[00:08:48] shirt that says no it does not say
[00:08:52] swallows does not say
[00:08:55] swallows it has actually all the uh the
[00:08:58] B has a a bird on it and a bunch of like
[00:09:01] mathematical formulations like it says
[00:09:03] like uh like like trying to calculate it
[00:09:06] how how much it can carry with the
[00:09:07] weight by grasping it by the
[00:09:09] husk that's actually what it is ah still
[00:09:13] waking
[00:09:13] up thank you I did not see that I
[00:09:16] appreciate that bud so yeah so with the
[00:09:18] other boat anyways that's nice I didn't
[00:09:21] notice that that's pretty cool so with
[00:09:23] the other boat we ended up going seeing
[00:09:25] another one and uh we ended up putting
[00:09:27] an offering on that other one so we'll
[00:09:29] see what happens happens we we have
[00:09:30] until Monday Monday night to see what
[00:09:31] happens there I'm I'm expecting
[00:09:34] either uh
[00:09:36] a I'm expecting a
[00:09:41] um uh counter offer but the persons had
[00:09:44] their boat sitting on the hard and they
[00:09:46] have a brand new boat and they've had
[00:09:47] theirs sitting on the hard for over six
[00:09:49] months now because no one's looked at
[00:09:51] it and the reason why is just there it's
[00:09:54] a sailboat not a catamaran and a lot of
[00:09:56] people are looking for catamarans right

[00:18:55] friend no it did not get the boat hey
[00:18:58] you want to hear a funny story that's
[00:19:00] well not really funny it's a shitty
[00:19:03] story actually but
[00:19:11] um yeah the bobblehead ones are actually
[00:19:13] yes definitely so long story short on
[00:19:16] that is uh we went uh on the day we were
[00:19:18] driving up to the airport we get a call
[00:19:20] from our broker hey they dropped the
[00:19:21] price of the boat like oh sweet like
[00:19:24] let's put an offer in because we were we
[00:19:25] were there was a few things wrong and
[00:19:26] that what they dropped it by was
[00:19:28] acceptable for what I was okay with my
[00:19:30] all sweet so here's some mail call let's
[00:19:32] keep going with that let's see what we
[00:19:34] get here and uh so we put an offering
[00:19:37] well while we were flying on the
[00:19:38] airplane um our broker calls to tell us
[00:19:41] well they're showing the boat to someone
[00:19:42] else and that other person put an offer
[00:19:44] in and they're taking that offer so they
[00:19:47] sold the boat right out from under us
[00:19:49] while we were flying on the airplane and
[00:19:51] they dropped the price like that day and
[00:19:54] the other people hadn't looked at it so
[00:19:56] pretty much it boiled down dude they
[00:19:58] sold it to somebody while we were flying
[00:20:00] on the airplane to get
[00:20:03] there kind of a shitty [ __ ] tactic if
[00:20:05] you told me but
[00:20:08] hey hey you know what Maha let's say
[00:20:11] let's put this way it may have worked
[00:20:14] out in our favor because there's another
[00:20:16] boat that we had been looking at for a
[00:20:17] little while that was a little bit more
[00:20:18] expensive than the than this one but it
[00:20:21] happened to drop in price it was one of
[00:20:22] the it was a sailboat not a camaran but
[00:20:24] it was a large one it's a 53ft sailboat
[00:20:26] well with the process of looking at that
[00:20:29] um my we were at our our sh um our
[00:20:34] flight was delayed for like five six
[00:20:37] hours so we ended up five hours I think
[00:20:40] so we ended up uh my wife and I were
[00:20:41] eating breakfast and we were looking at
[00:20:42] stuff on our on our phone and she found
[00:20:45] one of the boats I had looked at before
[00:20:46] and like oh look at this one and it
[00:20:48] dropped in price this is a a monor
[00:20:50] breach look at that c
[00:20:52] there
[00:20:54] oo seventh
[00:20:56] edition seventh edition right there you
[00:20:59] see that everyone
[00:21:03] beautiful this is my seventh edition
[00:21:05] cards I got from Jason the other day I
[00:21:07] was extremely lucky I got some nice ones

[00:21:13] for foil there whenever a player plays a
[00:21:15] spell that player returns a land he or

[00:21:25] obviously nice little white background
[00:21:28] ones
[00:21:30] I know dude that was a sweet looking
[00:21:31] card well so we ended up seeing this
[00:21:34] other boat and uh my broker couldn't get
[00:21:37] a hold of them but I ended up sending a
[00:21:39] message over the people that were there
[00:21:40] she hey can we come and take a look at
[00:21:42] this and I'll have our broker reach out
[00:21:43] to you if we like it and we want to put
[00:21:44] an offer in so they like yeah sure well
[00:21:47] and then they responded go oh wait you
[00:21:48] had already worked with our one of the
[00:21:50] people here and they gave the name of
[00:21:51] the person like oh yeah that was the
[00:21:53] person we met at the boat show and she
[00:21:56] like so and we actually if we had gone
[00:21:58] with a different boat we would have
[00:21:59] talked with her but we were liking the
[00:22:01] certain type of boat in this dealer that
[00:22:03] we the broker we're working with now
[00:22:04] sells those mainly so but anyways we uh
[00:22:08] she was like oh yeah and she came over
[00:22:09] and showed us she ended up coming over
[00:22:12] and showing us the boat and now my other
[00:22:14] broker he always kind of complained
[00:22:16] whenever I uh said about like the price
[00:22:18] of certain boats and what they are for
[00:22:19] an offer but I'm like I'm like this has
[00:22:21] been like how long it seems like it's
[00:22:23] been here for a while yeah it's been
[00:22:24] here for like six months or so they saw
[00:22:25] us some wiggle room so we gave him an
[00:22:26] offer on a 10 year newer boat and it's a
[00:22:30] 53 foot um sailboat so we'll see what
[00:22:42] happens I don't know it's an interesting

[00:27:29] so one of my favorite things that I one
[00:27:31] of the things that I ended up doing
[00:27:32] though was I uh we ended up luckily
[00:27:34] found another boat and one of the other
[00:27:36] Brokers that we happen to deal with at
[00:27:37] the um the show happened to be the one
[00:27:39] that came to show us the boat so when we
[00:27:41] put the offer in I mean she was a very
[00:27:43] nice lady one of the things I did have
[00:27:44] to say I didn't like about it was the
[00:27:46] other guy would kind of playing likey
[00:27:48] like I'm gonna put this he's like a you
[00:27:49] know I don't know you know this boats
[00:27:50] don't sell for this much I'm like I
[00:27:52] don't give a [ __ ] what the [ __ ] about
[00:27:53] sell it's worth this is what it's worth
[00:27:54] with all the other stuff that needs to
[00:27:55] be done the owners can take my offer or
[00:27:57] they can wait and try to find get a
[00:27:59] better offer they're not going to get a
[00:28:00] better offer since every boat is

[00:28:03] generally $50 and $80,000 in the last
[00:28:06] month or two so they're gonna have

[00:39:10] is yeah I can I I will definitely let
[00:39:13] you guys know we actually have some
[00:39:14] friends over in Texas and they have a
[00:39:16] house on the ocean there somewhere so
[00:39:18] we've actually debated on going and

[00:39:20] just to go over and see some of them and
[00:39:22] hang out but come in Beacon shallow over
[00:39:25] there and our boat is a a deeper boat
[00:39:28] though so we might have some issues
[00:39:29] we'll find out we'll have to look a

[00:45:40] dealing with all the [ __ ] that gets
[00:45:41] thrown at you you're always going to
[00:45:42] step in something it's how do you deal
[00:45:43] with it you wipe it off or you complain
[00:45:44] about it and go oh my God and throw a
[00:45:46] tape or tantrum that you stepped in
[00:45:48] something no [ __ ] wipe the crap off

[00:46:13] number can't be that lucky anymore I
[00:46:15] forgot
[00:46:17] it all right let's see what these ones
[00:46:19] look like with the foils on them what do
[00:46:21] you think the foils are going to look
[00:46:22] better or not let's see let's see what
[00:46:25] you think
[00:46:33] no no no no one would ever make that
[00:46:36] secret layer but that would be funny
[00:46:37] though see I want to make my own version
[00:46:39] of I'm gonna make my I kind of want to
[00:46:41] make my own like secret layer one day
[00:46:44] like does that make any sense like I
[00:46:46] want to make my own art thing and do my
[00:46:47] own thing with it and have my own like
[00:46:49] set of like five cards they're all like
[00:46:51] regular cards that you could have with
[00:46:52] you like whatever ones but these are
[00:46:53] just you know you'll play these ones
[00:46:54] instead because they get the alternate
[00:46:55] AR and there like my version of how
[00:46:58] things would be I don't know if you guys
[00:47:00] think that would be funny or intriguing
[00:47:01] or
[00:47:02] not oh the game was
[00:47:09] awesome oh don't worry about it Frank
[00:47:11] you don't ever need to worry about that
[00:47:12] she wouldn't even come up normally it
[00:47:13] would have been just me it was just
[00:47:14] happened to be we were going to look at
[00:47:15] a boat too and she was extremely happy
[00:47:17] she goes I got to watch three movies in
[00:47:19] bed I never get to watch anything I
[00:47:21] watch like three love movies and I I
[00:47:24] never get to do that she was so excited
[00:47:28] Bridge of Death and foil what do you
[00:47:29] think on that foil looks not too bad
[00:47:34] there yeah
[00:47:38] my I like the look at the foil that's
[00:47:41] nice looking there I like that yeah but
[00:47:44] uh no we had a great time I appreciate
[00:47:46] it a lot buddy that was really fun I
[00:47:48] haven't had a chance to go to one of
[00:47:49] those in in a few years in many years
[00:47:51] and that was the first time I've gone in
[00:47:52] probably like 15 years or so so I very
[00:47:55] much appreciate that I had an awesome
[00:47:57] time and we and the Red Sox won too so
[00:48:00] it makes it a little bit better right
[00:48:02] for me
[00:48:05] Frank head of the homestead oh not the
[00:48:07] big hit but that's okay my
[00:48:09] friend that's okay my
[00:48:11] friend
[00:48:13] because that gets you a discount on your
[00:48:15] shipping if you want to jump in on it
[00:48:16] now a AK can you do something for me can
[00:48:21] you give me a number between one and 10

[00:48:48] in here we're going to shuffle up we go
[00:48:50] with number six then we're going to go
[00:48:52] with our next secret layer and show what
[00:48:53] it looks like one two three four five
[00:48:56] and six

[00:49:11] gives you a little discount on your
[00:49:12] shipping so say if I have a single going
[00:49:14] uh a lot of times it'll be free shipping
[00:49:16] with a single unless it happens to be
[00:49:17] like one of the ones that are over
[00:49:19] $20 sir bavier bed aier scales sacrifice
[00:49:24] a creature add to of
[00:49:31] non-colored Castle

[00:49:40] had a blast and it was so we were so
[00:49:42] close it was awesome castle of AR
[00:49:45] legendary snow this one is such a cool
[00:49:47] land here the foil on it is pretty nice
[00:49:50] too I like the foils with it yeah but uh
[00:49:54] with that it was um with her she was
[00:49:57] fine she didn't have a problem at all
[00:49:59] but um next time most likely what'll
[00:50:00] happen is we'll probably be up there
[00:50:02] we'd most likely be around there with
[00:50:03] our own
[00:50:04] boat to be able to do that and hang out
[00:50:06] there for a little
[00:50:08] while it's a nice looking card I like it
[00:50:11] I like the castle

[01:10:58] didn't have a lot of money but we had a
[01:11:00] lot of fun with them and I was able to
[01:11:01] get a few cards but I was not able to
[01:11:02] get a lot like others that I knew but
[01:11:06] anyways not bad there oh not keep the
[01:11:09] giveaway running I guess it ran and it

[01:11:37] Chang I missed the a in h in there
[01:11:39] fatter
[01:11:42] Chang all right if not we'll go with
[01:11:44] your number five from before in the
[01:11:46] YouTube land all right since if they're
[01:11:48] not here to give us
[01:11:52] one all right let's do it and we'll go
[01:11:54] there and we'll go
[01:11:56] one two three four and five there we are
[01:12:00] ah not bad yeah I mean it's not too hard
[01:12:02] to pick up again I uh I played it I
[01:12:04] picked it up rather quickly about a year
[01:12:07] ago I I pretty much the f um Lord of the
[01:12:10] Rings pulled me back in big and I was
[01:12:12] because I was a big fan of that you know
[01:12:14] all right no one want
[01:12:20] those maybe some we like some draft of
[01:12:26] um I mean play
[01:12:34] boosters all right we'll go
[01:12:43] with that oh no on
[01:12:47] screen that we're go with
[01:12:50] this I'm going to go with the same thing
[01:12:56] we go
[01:12:57] for three
[01:13:01] packs of Outlaws three packs of Outlaws
[01:13:04] that would be three packs of Outlaws
[01:13:06] right here if you would like them that
[01:13:08] is that's if you would like them and
[01:13:09] remember everybody get your checkins
[01:13:11] going because our counter the other day
[01:13:13] we got up to 350 and we were in above it
[01:13:15] we were actually almost at 520 or
[01:13:16] something before I ended it for the day
[01:13:18] so I have a feeling we can it get up
[01:13:19] there one of these times to our our nice
[01:13:21] one of like eight our up to that 750
[01:13:23] because if we do we're going to weigh
[01:13:24] two packs of cards at the end of the
[01:13:25] stream that's why we do that you want to
[01:13:27] do the check-in so we can get up there
[01:13:29] for the more things that we give away
[01:13:30] because if we hit 75 we give away cool
[01:13:33] single if we H 150 we give away a pack
[01:13:37] if we H 250 350 we give away two packs I
[01:13:41] think if it was 750 might have been
[01:13:43] either three packs or a collector
[01:13:44] booster so that's what you guys are
[01:13:46] that's what you're trying to get the
[01:13:47] check in
[01:13:49] for all right I'll put all that back
[01:13:51] doesn't look like anybody really wants
[01:13:53] those but that's all right we'll run
[01:13:56] from of our other fun little games that
[01:13:57] we got in the buy now do this one maybe
[01:14:01] I'll do that one at a little bit of
[01:14:02] discount right now I'm going to go grab
[01:14:04] something I forgot about
[01:14:31] where did I put
[01:14:36] it oh no oh there it
[01:14:40] is look what I got I'm
[01:14:46] excited Frank and I made a
[01:14:52] trade for my raccoon deck
[01:14:58] nice right there you
[01:15:01] go I'm excited about it I'm excited
[01:15:05] about it all right well we don't have
[01:15:07] too much uh do much different we can do
[01:15:10] our little games now one of the things I
[01:15:12] was
[01:15:12] wondering is that um with our games that
[01:15:16] we've been doing should we bring back
[01:15:17] some more of the uh do a little bit more
[01:15:19] of the uh Adventure game stuff that we
[01:15:21] had going on maybe adjust it and put in
[01:15:23] like some of the lower start it maybe
[01:15:26] adjust it right now and uh do some
[01:15:27] different with the packs so we can maybe
[01:15:30] put some of the drafts in and it'll be a
[01:15:31] little bit lower price and then maybe uh
[01:15:33] have like a bunch of the random grass
[01:15:34] that I got here and then adust that
[01:15:36] should I do that or do you think I
[01:15:38] should just kind of keep it the same and
[01:15:40] go back to pushing out the uh excuse me
[01:15:42] there for pushing out the
[01:15:45] um game here uh the game in general up
[01:15:49] to
[01:15:51] you mean we did have a lot of fun
[01:15:53] playing the game we haven't done it in a
[01:15:55] little while here we have our little
[01:15:57] Adventure game that we like to play
[01:15:58] which is you know we get to be a pirate
[01:16:00] wander around an
[01:16:02] island encountering different things
[01:16:05] looking for your friends to come and
[01:16:06] help you know it's fun that's if you
[01:16:09] want
[01:16:10] to yes it's a little Pirate game here

[01:16:16] see if I can find it let just type in
[01:16:20] Pirate it's the pirate Adventure now
[01:16:23] it's pretty cool because the way I'd set
[01:16:24] this up was that the uh you get a good
[01:16:27] deal on that and then you actually end
[01:16:29] up uh we only have like what nine of 17
[01:16:32] of them left and then the next time it
[01:16:33] steps up to the next level packs and
[01:16:35] it's even a better
[01:16:37] deal and then at the end when we get the
[01:16:39] third level packs because you're at the
[01:16:40] boss's level is pretty much I'm losing
[01:16:44] money hazer poor you got a rabbit a not

[01:39:52] like all right not
[01:39:55] bad I'd rather have a bunch of good

[01:39:59] what I
[01:40:03] mean nice one my friend nice one that
[01:40:07] was a good pack I like that pack a lot I
[01:40:09] thoroughly I'd be thoroughly happy with
[01:40:11] that
[01:40:14] one yeah see like rather than giving me
[01:40:16] one pack that's worth like that one a
[01:40:19] box and you get one card if you're lucky
[01:40:21] that's worth like you know 100 something
[01:40:24] bucks whatever it may be I'd rather have
[01:40:27] a bunch of them that are worth a few
[01:40:29] bucks to add up to the equivalent of the
[01:40:32] pack that way I feel like I'm getting
[01:40:34] something for like like I don't want to
[01:40:36] just like I kept the box that I open I
[01:40:38] think from Modern Horizon I think I got
[01:40:39] one good card I was like
[01:40:43] seriously and but it was like the second
[01:40:45] to last pack which worked out
[01:40:47] but yeah it's one of those weird
[01:40:51] things yeah yes EX exactly that's why
[01:40:54] they are more than other ones because
[01:40:55] you generally get good cards in them no
[01:40:57] matter what they might not be $500 $200
[01:41:00] $20 $80 cards they might be like three s
[01:41:03] to eight cards or a few $ five
[01:41:10] cards but they're all together and they
[01:41:12] come out with something worthwhile I
[01:41:14] like it my friend oh did I not start our

[01:42:48] one out there for 11 instead of 12 for
[01:42:49] you if you'd like it
[01:42:54] hanging out here yeah hopefully we get
[01:42:56] an answer maybe today or tomorrow about
[01:42:58] the boat we'll definitely know tomorrow
[01:43:00] if they accept it or not because at the
[01:43:02] end of the day it's a yes or a no all
[01:43:06] right put that back there no one wanted
[01:43:08] that
[01:43:09] one let's see if anybody wants a cosx
[01:43:13] command and
[01:43:20] foil but that does mean I have a lot of
[01:43:22] work to do here coming up so I'm not
[01:43:24] going to be hanging out all the time as
[01:43:25] long as I normally have I'll probably
[01:43:27] jump off a little bit earlier than
[01:43:28] normal regularly now instead of being
[01:43:29] out like one M noon or one probably
[01:43:32] jumping off around like
[01:43:34] um this is a foil by the way going for
[01:43:37] the nonfoil price I'll probably be
[01:43:38] dropping off around 10 11 at the latest
[01:43:41] but today I start a little late I may be
[01:43:42] on a little
[01:43:43] later look at that death likes it there
[01:43:47] you go death that's a good pickup it's a
[01:43:49] smart pickup right there too that's a
[01:43:52] smart pick up right
[01:43:58] there I'm having a hard I don't know if
[01:44:00] I want to get rid of this
[01:44:03] one nice looking
[01:44:06] card you know what I'm probably not
[01:44:08] going to be using it anytime
[01:44:10] soon not going to be using it anytime
[01:44:14] soon I have and also I have the uh
[01:44:16] commander deck I really want it
[01:44:26] planner Nexus for you instead
[01:44:29] of 11 we're going to throw it up for
[01:44:34] 10 see I like to give you a little
[01:44:36] discount because I know you got to pay
[01:44:37] for shipping and everything and if as
[01:44:38] long as it's not like a ridiculous thing
[01:44:40] I you know like something insane I can
[01:44:42] do a little bit you know not a
[01:44:44] high-profile thing can do a little bit
[01:44:46] off there little planner Nexus not for
[01:44:48] anyone there all righty well we went
[01:44:52] through some of those
[01:44:53] let's do some of the other stuff let's
[01:44:59] see let's see
[01:45:02] here should we what should we do here
[01:45:05] now for some of the
[01:45:10] singles let's see all right we'll throw
[01:45:13] some random ones out let's throw some
[01:45:15] random ones
[01:45:18] out ah wrangling land all right
[01:45:32] not a nice little flesh duplicate for
[01:45:34] you now I can't help how the price on
[01:45:36] this is going to be for the shipping
[01:45:38] because the shipping anything over $20
[01:45:40] they do require it to they automatically
[01:45:42] set it to be like a track shipping but
[01:45:44] this I will give you a discount so 37
[01:45:47] I'm going to throw up for 33
[01:45:53] that gets you a discount on the shipping
[01:45:55] and gives a good deal
[01:46:12] there no one wants that that's okay
[01:46:15] let's throw out this
[01:46:18] here a little breeding pool
[01:46:33] we have Joey coming in with our giveaway
[01:46:35] win you got the G gilwin moose all right
[01:46:39] not the big hit but does give you a
[01:46:41] little discount on shipping now this one
[01:46:43] a s
[01:46:45] similarly I this would have been a
[01:46:48] little higher but I'm going to drop this
[01:46:49] one to a single price for shipping and
[01:46:52] I'm going to should put it for the under
[01:46:53] one there we're going to throw instead
[01:46:54] of 19 we're going to throw it on for
[01:46:58] 18 Joey if you're in here you're very
[01:47:01] welcome I do appreciate that what I
[01:47:02] would like from you though um if you

[01:47:05] 10 I would very much appreciate Joey
[01:47:12] lumps number nine all right I like it
[01:47:16] now it gets you discount on your
[01:47:17] shipping which is nice so you want to
[01:47:19] pick up one of the singles you probably
[01:47:21] pretty much get free shipping on any of

[01:47:51] can't help on the on the car there for
[01:47:53] the shipping
[01:47:57] but what I can do is make it so it's a
[01:48:00] little bit cheaper for you so you're not
[01:48:02] paying as much and it will end up being
[01:48:04] instead of $28 we'll put it in for 25

[01:51:08] Drea all right we have a little life
[01:51:11] from the
[01:51:11] loom if you would like that
[01:51:18] too nice little one there for you in
[01:51:20] foil
[01:51:24] and we'll run that one like I said now
[01:51:26] whenever these go because they're plain
[01:51:28] white envelope they go in a top loader
[01:51:29] and literally a plain white envelope
[01:51:31] that's why they call plain white
[01:51:32] envelope pwe and that's why they go for
[01:51:34] a dollar or less generally for the
[01:51:36] shipping so just so you are aware now
[01:51:38] this one is a $10 card I'm going to
[01:51:40] throw it on for
[01:51:43] nine but if you buy multiple ones
[01:51:45] together they end up going to track
[01:51:46] package anyways so if you buy like three
[01:51:48] I think it is three singles or four
[01:51:50] singles is when it goes to a track pack
[01:51:52] P
[01:51:55] AG life from the
[01:51:57] loom our little fla Titan a fire's
[01:52:05] Fury nice one there if you want
[01:52:13] it no did it not run I don't think that
[01:52:16] ran Why didn't it run when I put it on
[01:52:17] there oh you bastard all right it said
[01:52:19] it didn't work let me fix that
[01:52:23] we're going to run that and now it is
[01:52:24] one that is an expensive one so it's
[01:52:25] going to be $21 instead of
[01:52:28] $25 get you a little discount on your
[01:52:30] shipping there and there you
[01:52:35] go for a little F and do you remember to
[01:52:38] check in because if we get up to 75
[01:52:40] we'll do a nice single for a giveaway
[01:52:42] get up to 150 we do a pack for a
[01:52:44] giveaway and if we get up to 350 we do
[01:52:46] two packs but the 750 that you see there
[01:52:48] is because we got it to 350 one time
[01:52:50] that's why I want to try to get higher
[01:52:51] if we can get 750 that is either three
[01:52:54] packs or collector booster depending on
[01:52:56] what I want to do depending on how I'm

[01:56:44] seven you know what I kind of understand
[01:56:47] that like not having Commander damage a
[01:56:48] little bit I always forget about it a
[01:56:50] lot of the times that's I think what my
[01:56:51] problem is I always I forget about it a
[01:56:53] lot let's throw out a little um toxic
[01:56:56] Del Lou
[01:56:58] retro from time
[01:57:01] spiral time remastered for a
[01:57:09] little thought Seas here we
[01:57:16] go there we go that is we're going to
[01:57:18] edit that we're going to go down so it's
[01:57:20] a single sale there throw that out for
[01:57:23] that that is going to be instead of a
[01:57:25] $14 card we'll throw that out for $13
[01:57:34] hairs yeah yeah that does sink I have um
[01:57:37] I was playing with somebody and it was
[01:57:40] uh I can't remember what exactly what it
[01:57:42] was it had something to do with the time
[01:57:43] stuff with a timey wiy deck or whatever
[01:57:45] they using the Doctor Who won and one of
[01:57:47] the things that they could do is they
[01:57:48] ended up I can't remember what it was
[01:57:50] but there was a car and it was like find
[01:57:51] the car that has a certain amount of
[01:57:52] mana and they literally had to find the
[01:57:54] and it was and everyone that be like a
[01:57:56] Time counter or something like that but
[01:57:58] or some type of counter but once they
[01:57:59] ended up having like 60 of them and
[01:58:01] they're all right you're gone like
[01:58:03] really [ __ ] that
[01:58:08] sucks like and I was gone in like I
[01:58:11] think the third round I'm like this
[01:58:12] doesn't even this isn't even that makes
[01:58:14] this this not
[01:58:19] fun but it happens you
[01:58:22] know but that's the one when you realize
[01:58:25] when you when you notice that then
[01:58:26] you're like all right I know how I have
[01:58:27] to play against certain people now a
[01:58:29] five s $6 card coming at you for five
[01:58:31] toxic they lose Commander Masters
[01:58:44] foil yes yeah when double strike exists
[01:58:47] and stuff like that yeah I mean like I
[01:58:49] think I can I can see if the damage goes
[01:58:51] through to the to you to hit you like
[01:58:55] from like through one of your character
[01:58:56] like through one of your creatures or
[01:58:57] whatever but when they can like just go
[01:58:59] around everything and get you that's the
[01:59:01] stuff that like
[01:59:03] really if that makes any sense that's I
[01:59:06] think that's where I I agree with you
[01:59:10] there we're g to try another thought
[01:59:13] Seas maybe you want this version of
[01:59:19] it this will go for $6 instead of eight
[01:59:23] yeah I kind of agree I kind of see what
[01:59:25] you're saying there I don't disagree but
[01:59:26] I don't NE I agree but I don't disagree
[01:59:29] if that makes sense I agree and I
[01:59:30] disagree at the same time because I
[01:59:33] think it should be there but I think it
[01:59:35] needs to be adjusted so you can only get
[01:59:37] it when it Commander damage only happens
[01:59:38] when it comes from like your
[01:59:43] attack phase not a like with attacking
[01:59:46] creatures not with uh things that can go
[01:59:49] around them yeah yeah I get that
[01:59:52] no one wanted this I'll throw that back
[01:59:54] there maybe somebody wants a little NAD
[02:00:00] do yeah it's one of those things where
[02:00:02] it's like you know I don't mind the
[02:00:03] damage I don't mind having that it makes
[02:00:04] sense because you know you get the
[02:00:06] person that has the cards that give them
[02:00:08] like life and they're at like a 100 life
[02:00:09] then you're never going to kill that
[02:00:10] person because every single time
[02:00:11] something happens they get life fine but
[02:00:14] that I make this I Mak sense in the
[02:00:15] commander damage but you should be able
[02:00:17] to when you go like trample through
[02:00:19] their one- one characters that keep
[02:00:22] giving them life you should be able to
[02:00:24] hit them with Commander damage but you
[02:00:27] shouldn't be able to go around them
[02:00:28] necessarily I don't know I I it's one of
[02:00:30] those weird
[02:00:34] things Nerf it I like it Nerf it yes

[02:39:59] talking about a minute in in a second
[02:40:01] here kid
[02:40:03] Kelly so like on on uh some of the cards
[02:40:06] what they do is they use orig like basic
[02:40:09] cards like we always are used
[02:40:14] to one of those as non flows worth more
[02:40:17] yeah sometimes but so like for these
[02:40:19] ends so like I have bagend
[02:40:21] or uh aragono pillars of the Kings the
[02:40:24] oth is what that card is so you mean
[02:40:27] like uh or like a reflecting pool for
[02:40:30] you know that's what see how it says
[02:40:32] this is the name of the card here which
[02:40:34] is henneth Anon but it's reflecting pool
[02:40:36] when it comes to what the actual card is
[02:40:38] in
[02:40:39] Magic so if that makes any sense or
[02:40:42] helps at all like black buckleberry
[02:40:44] fairy was OBO Palace in the clouds or
[02:40:47] cabal coffers for minus morgal so that's
[02:40:51] really what they were uh they just put
[02:40:53] the L of the Rings version of stuff in
[02:40:55] there so that we had fun with them
[02:40:58] yeah all right well everybody lives and
[02:41:02] yes I understand sometimes the non-foil
[02:41:04] versions of things are more expensive
[02:41:05] than the uh foils which is weird right I
[02:41:09] think it's just people some people have
[02:41:10] not been liking the um the
[02:41:22] nice pickup

For the YouTube, the whatnot link should be at the top so people know how to access it easier. Actually, it should be that way for everything. Put all the whatnot ability to access at the top along with the other ways to access me through the link for the top or for the other social stuff. Always have those at the top of the description so people can easily find me. And make sure all the things that are live have the things for hashtag live and hashtag streaming since those are important.

Here are the **exact components of the virtual pull boxes** for the shows based on the context provided:

---

### **Virtual Pull Boxes Overview**
- Virtual Pull Boxes are designed as a key engagement tool for your shows. They offer **guaranteed hits** and can include chase cards or premium rewards, based on the tier or setup.

    - Chase cards (e.g., rare or limited-edition cards).  
    - Premium Rewards (e.g., signed or foil cards).  

- **Engagement Tactics:**  
  - Announce **top hits** available in the boxes before the show to build excitement.  
  - Use overlays (e.g., OBS) to showcase the remaining pulls, creating visual excitement.

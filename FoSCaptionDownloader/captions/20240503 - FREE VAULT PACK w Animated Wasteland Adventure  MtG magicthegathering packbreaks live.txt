[00:11:54] we'll see how it goes maybe it uh we'll
[00:11:56] see how it goes here
[00:12:03] hopefully we can have some fun get
[00:12:05] things
[00:12:07] rolling we'll see
[00:12:13] though I open up my sorcery stuff
[00:12:16] yesterday I'm done looking at and
[00:12:18] foiling and sleeving all those up so I
[00:12:21] just don't really know what to do
[00:12:22] anymore I'm a little uh little at the uh
[00:12:25] not sure what to do at the
[00:12:27] moment either way though we do have our
[00:12:29] adventure if you want to jump in on it
[00:12:32] like I was saying we currently are at
[00:12:33] just buy up the packs that you want
[00:12:34] we're currently at the stage where our
[00:12:36] adventures are wandering around through
[00:12:38] a store the it's actually what used to
[00:12:41] be the uh the the um the gift shop in
[00:12:45] Cape canaval they just purchased a long
[00:12:48] sword they have a little bit of pogs
[00:12:50] left and we hadn't decided if we were
[00:12:52] going to leave the store and further
[00:12:53] Venture further into the city because
[00:12:55] there's a little Trail tram that takes
[00:12:57] you into the city a little train
[00:12:59] or are you going to uh stay here and
[00:13:02] just kind of get some stuff at this one
[00:13:06] shop right here and um head out it's up
[00:13:09] to you on what you plan on
[00:13:12] doing are you going to Adventure with
[00:13:15] our buddies hey
[00:13:17] Fable how you doing or are you going to
[00:13:21] uh participate maybe in the giveway that
[00:13:23] way if um depending on what goes on at
[00:13:26] the end of the stream here you can jump
[00:13:27] in and get some of those Fallout cards a
[00:13:29] couple of those saying thank you for
[00:13:30] hanging out with
[00:13:32] us we also have our mystery bags that
[00:13:34] are up there and those are pretty close
[00:13:36] to primed on that and our also our big
[00:13:39] blue book is available over there in the
[00:13:41] top corner you should be able to see
[00:13:42] that up there all
[00:13:47] those and then we are on uh What on
[00:13:50] YouTube right now we're doing some stuff
[00:13:53] in this morning seeing if you guys want
[00:13:55] to have some fun with us
[00:13:59] we got a few of you in here I think
[00:14:01] there's a couple of you maybe in
[00:14:03] here but we'll uh we'll maybe we'll run
[00:14:05] through the adventure so I think I was
[00:14:06] thinking what we were end up doing it's
[00:14:08] not always we don't want to build up our
[00:14:10] character here maybe we'll ask chat for
[00:14:12] some help here on what we're going to do
[00:14:14] for G G uh gaining items all right since
[00:14:19] no one happens to be jumping in at the
[00:14:20] moment I was thinking the last thing we
[00:14:22] left it at was this person had a vest I
[00:14:25] mean a leather jacket that had some
[00:14:27] metal stitched into it for some armor
[00:14:29] then it was also a shotgun and unlimited
[00:14:33] ammo and a bunch of stem packs plus all
[00:14:35] the other random junk that was in the uh
[00:14:37] shop from before it was uh the nukes ra
[00:14:39] all dropped all of you know so our next
[00:14:41] option though is to leave the shop and
[00:14:43] head further into the City and I think
[00:14:45] you know what I think we might actually
[00:14:46] do that right now see what happens so I
[00:14:49] think that's what we're going to end up
[00:14:50] doing I think Englebert and Evelyn are
[00:14:54] going to say goodbye to that shop owner
[00:14:57] there that little ghoulish little shop
[00:14:59] that turned around on a stool and is
[00:15:01] going to say all right hey thank you
[00:15:02] very much for everything you gave us I
[00:15:04] think I'm going to head over to uh a
[00:15:06] little bit further in the city here and
[00:15:07] see what's going on that shop go no no
[00:15:09] you don't want to do that you don't want
[00:15:10] to do that you know you go in the city
[00:15:12] uh you're just going to waste money it's
[00:15:13] going to be it's going to be a bunch of
[00:15:14] people in there you don't want to go in
[00:15:15] there just finish purchasing your stuff
[00:15:17] here you can get you all your ammo you
[00:15:18] need everything you need here don't
[00:15:20] worry about going in there to you Evelyn
[00:15:24] being the smart one here all right
[00:15:26] thought that was a little bit of uh
[00:15:27] intriguing that he said like how how
[00:15:29] hard he was pushing not to go in so you
[00:15:31] know what decided what's not why not
[00:15:32] anyways let's go on into the city Ain
[00:15:34] goes we're going to go into the city
[00:15:35] anyways check it out for ourselves we
[00:15:37] got a couple of friends here we'll be
[00:15:39] we'll be okay so they head on out of out
[00:15:41] of that store those doors open they
[00:15:44] slide on open because they had power
[00:15:46] they side close that they walk out all
[00:15:49] right let's go Evelyn sweet vage and uh
[00:15:53] sir bark Barks A lot let's get on that
[00:15:55] uh tram over there they go all wandering
[00:15:57] over to that left a little bit to around
[00:15:58] the out of the building they get the
[00:16:00] trim they jump on that they head further
[00:16:02] into the
[00:16:04] city dog sitting in one of the seats
[00:16:06] next to them slobbering all over them as
[00:16:09] they said further in the city they see
[00:16:10] they keep further passing more and more
[00:16:13] buildings most of these buildings just
[00:16:14] have people in them not really shops
[00:16:16] it's all like housing that's weird I
[00:16:19] didn't know they had a city out here
[00:16:20] well anyways get further over and
[00:16:23] finally you get to this giant giant
[00:16:25] building where you was seeing a bunch of
[00:16:26] the people walk towards and it was a
[00:16:28] giant it's not and there's also a rocket
[00:16:30] next to it that was never shot off now
[00:16:32] there's people going into that
[00:16:34] rocket giant one there one of the
[00:16:36] biggest ones you've ever seen there's
[00:16:38] also it must have been able to hold
[00:16:40] hundreds of people hundred or more
[00:16:41] people heading on there you know what I
[00:16:45] think we're going to go ahead out that
[00:16:46] check that rocket out go go in there cuz
[00:16:48] you look to the other side and you see
[00:16:50] that that big building it's all food you
[00:16:52] know what you know I think I have some
[00:16:53] food I don't really need anything right
[00:16:54] now we're pretty filled up on our health
[00:16:56] let's go check something else out even
[00:16:58] though angle Bert is not feeling so
[00:17:00] good so he goes I think we need to find
[00:17:03] ourselves like a medic or something
[00:17:06] so they head on into that
[00:17:09] giant rocket wandering up and they see
[00:17:12] it's got 15 floors my what are we going
[00:17:16] to do I
[00:17:18] say we try you know what I say it's
[00:17:21] going to have actually let's say it has
[00:17:22] 12 floors let's make it that way we're
[00:17:24] going to have 12 floors not 15 make it
[00:17:26] easy what floor are we going to go to
[00:17:28] what roll and find out we get to floor
[00:17:30] three all right floor three you wander
[00:17:32] up walk up those stairs you look at
[00:17:33] someone oh there's some food there I
[00:17:34] don't know a little shop and go on the
[00:17:35] third one oh looks like there might be
[00:17:38] uh something here we want to go into now
[00:17:40] you wander in the third
[00:17:44] floor wander is a big circle as you
[00:17:46] wander around there shots all around the
[00:17:48] outside and in the middle there just a
[00:17:50] big Spire in the
[00:17:52] middle fake rocket that was put there
[00:17:54] from how many years ago that's a little
[00:17:55] display but Al on the outside of it you
[00:17:58] see all all these shops now you wander
[00:18:00] around the outside the first one you see
[00:18:02] is a a food place again like I don't
[00:18:04] need noodles man come on then you see a
[00:18:06] beer shop then you go around you see an
[00:18:08] Armory where you you know what I just
[00:18:09] looked at I might go back there but I
[00:18:11] need some health see uh some weapons
[00:18:13] then you're getting around the other
[00:18:14] side and you go you know what I probably
[00:18:15] should have taken a LPS cuz you go past
[00:18:16] a few of the building straws and then
[00:18:18] finally there's actually little medic
[00:18:21] there well look at that it's on a
[00:18:24] medic walk in there this little old lady
[00:18:27] turns around he goes hey I know let me
[00:18:30] help you out here I see you get a little
[00:18:32] you're not feeling too well there
[00:18:33] Englebert how do you know my
[00:18:36] name I heard you talking earlier outside
[00:18:38] I have big ears and she turns and she
[00:18:39] has one giant ear the other one had
[00:18:42] fallen off she must be some type of
[00:18:44] mutant all right then well uh you know
[00:18:48] what yes I do need some help she goes I
[00:18:51] can fully heal
[00:18:52] you for five
[00:18:56] pogs and
[00:18:59] what do you think
[00:19:01] there what do you think chat should we
[00:19:03] try to haggle or do you want to give the
[00:19:06] five pogs and see if they'll uh just
[00:19:08] heal them and let him go along the way
[00:19:11] probably a good deal there to get fully
[00:19:12] healed from six all the way up since
[00:19:14] you're pretty injured at the
[00:19:18] moment all right
[00:19:23] okay so I think that's what we'll do is
[00:19:27] we will uh
[00:19:30] we'll
[00:19:31] heal angelbert
[00:19:34] completely they're not even going to
[00:19:35] haggle you know what I'm not that's not
[00:19:37] too bad I'm feeling tired I'm going to
[00:19:38] give you that five anyways there you go
[00:19:40] give her the five CU thank you very much

[00:19:49] the rest of you guys can go wander off
[00:19:50] if you want to go look at some other
[00:19:51] stuff probably about an hour or so so
[00:19:53] Englebert goes what and she stabs
[00:19:54] angelbert with something and he passes
[00:19:56] out the rest of you look at each other
[00:19:58] and goes
[00:19:59] um he's going to be safe
[00:20:02] right all right I guess he's going to be
[00:20:04] safe so you go wandering off she goes
[00:20:06] yeah yeah he's fine we just got to he
[00:20:08] needs to be knocked out while we go

[00:20:12] going through she starts fixing up
[00:20:14] angelbert but angle bird is no longer

[00:22:44] maybe even some leather pants and see if
[00:22:46] we can trade those in for some of those
[00:22:48] uh the leather pants with the uh metal
[00:22:50] on it there and then you see send the
[00:22:52] equivalent there and just pay the
[00:22:53] difference oh you know what I think I
[00:22:55] can put some metal onto these you know
[00:22:57] this is me doing I do all this work I
[00:22:58] just find the metal in the Wasteland you
[00:22:59] know that might work here get me some
[00:23:01] new stuff new inventory you know I think
[00:23:04] I can do that
[00:23:06] so there you go got a little deal here
[00:23:09] now chat anybody in here want to help me
[00:23:12] out or am I just going to be talking to
[00:23:15] myself this morning because I think what
[00:23:17] we're going to end up doing
[00:23:19] here is we're going to see if we can uh
[00:23:26] barter so the bid here is you bid up if
[00:23:30] you can see the price right here the
[00:23:31] basic is the cost of all the cards packs
[00:23:34] I mean then you have your plus one and
[00:23:37] then your plus two I can move that if
[00:23:39] you can't see these also by the way uh
[00:23:42] sometimes people have a hard time seeing
[00:23:43] things and I it might be just the
[00:23:44] position it's in let me do this I used
[00:23:47] to have it off top I'll put it back up
[00:23:49] top but it's up there what you're going
[00:23:51] to be able to do is you pick those you
[00:23:53] you bid up to whatever you want so say
[00:23:55] you want to get a sorcery you bid up to
[00:23:57] 11 and you get to say all right give me
[00:23:59] a sorcery and then you would get a plus
[00:24:01] one in whatever we're doing in our
[00:24:02] counter in our Wasteland here now uh
[00:24:05] we're just currently going through the
[00:24:06] shops early right now so we're kind of
[00:24:08] getting through there just kind of
[00:24:09] wasting some time as we're waiting for
[00:24:10] some people to jump in on an encounter
[00:24:13] but we're generally when the encounters
[00:24:14] are I let you finish up in a shop then
[00:24:16] you guys are able to go off to uh do one
[00:24:19] of the other encounters where you either
[00:24:21] are a something in the way say maybe
[00:24:23] it's a battle of some kind maybe it's a
[00:24:25] boss we're not really sure but that's
[00:24:26] what the bid is you jump in you bid on
[00:24:30] whatever you want to go to so say you
[00:24:31] want to go with Outlaws of Thunder
[00:24:33] Junction play booster you bid $7 there
[00:24:35] and then you get that say that's what I
[00:24:37] want or say you know I like I said
[00:24:39] sorcery or whatever but what it be is
[00:24:41] say in the encounter right here you
[00:24:42] would end up getting in the next
[00:24:44] encounter a plus one if he wins with
[00:24:45] sorcery beta so that means is your
[00:24:48] character would get a plus one on their
[00:24:51] hit the one that you're choosing to play
[00:24:54] as so that's how that kind of we do with
[00:24:55] our adventure here jump in decide what
[00:24:58] you want to play as and if we're in a
[00:25:00] town or a city you get to play as all of
[00:25:02] them that's how we do it here and I can
[00:25:04] also knock down the time on it too on
[00:25:06] the auction I just had it running for a
[00:25:08] while cuz no one was jumping in on
[00:25:09] anything and if they if you did want to
[00:25:12] you could do it but either
[00:25:14] way that's what the option is is to jump
[00:25:16] in on the adventure game to participate
[00:25:18] here um and be one of the characters in
[00:25:21] our encounter a lot of people like to do
[00:25:23] it play as a character here and that's
[00:25:25] what it is hopefully that explained it
[00:25:27] for you the uh frequently asked
[00:25:29] questions does explain it a little bit
[00:25:31] too so I kind of just talk to myself
[00:25:34] sometimes in the morning until people
[00:25:35] show up and hang out maybe I jump in
[00:25:38] sometimes maybe they say what we're
[00:25:39] going to do in our in our city here like
[00:25:41] I was asking
[00:25:43] before like do we uh do we try to barter
[00:25:46] our stuff
[00:25:48] away best set oh all right so like set
[00:25:54] booster I would say I I would go with
[00:25:59] modern Horizon 2 if you were going to go
[00:26:01] to set booster maybe I I like modern
[00:26:03] Horizon 2 uh LCI set is always one of my
[00:26:07] favorites lost Cavern ion is always one
[00:26:09] of my favorites with the ability to get
[00:26:11] some Jurassic Park stuff in
[00:26:13] there
[00:26:14] um so I I very much like lost
[00:26:18] caverns and then I mean if you like Lord
[00:26:20] of the Rings there's the Lord of the
[00:26:21] Rings LR special edition ones there Lord
[00:26:24] of the Ring special edition I'm a big
[00:26:26] fan of those myself I always had those
[00:26:28] in the posters and everything out so it
[00:26:31] depends on like your kind of your price
[00:26:32] range but if you're going to go with
[00:26:33] like a set booster I I I like modern
[00:26:36] Horizon a lot because you got some good
[00:26:39] old stuff in there and I like the older
[00:26:41] art but if you like the new dinosaurs if
[00:26:43] you're big into dinosaurs I'd say go
[00:26:45] with lost Caverns which is LCI
[00:26:48] set now if you going to go with Outlaws
[00:26:50] or if you're going to go with one of the
[00:26:51] basic
[00:26:52] ones I'd say either Outlaws and Ravnica
[00:26:56] are nice because ravnik has the
[00:26:58] potential of getting you those uh those
[00:27:00] uh shock lands in there so those are
[00:27:03] kind of what I would say are the nice
[00:27:04] ones there I really like ioria
[00:27:07] personally just because I like Godzilla
[00:27:09] and that's why I have it so you get the
[00:27:11] at triom and ioria so those are very
[00:27:14] nice too so you have a bunch of options
[00:27:15] I don't know if you say best set but out
[00:27:17] of all of them I'd say my the one I had
[00:27:19] the most fun with my family is lost
[00:27:21] caverns of Exelon I'd say
[00:27:32] yes I'd probably say is the best one
[00:27:34] that I the one that I had the most fun
[00:27:38] with it has a lot of good good stuff in
[00:27:41] it to play with too a lot of good packs
[00:27:42] to play
[00:27:44] with so we are uh how's my audio I put a
[00:27:47] little I put this thing on there to make
[00:27:49] the
[00:27:52] for one of each if you bought up so um
[00:27:56] what do you mean like say you
[00:27:59] just how much if you want one of each if
[00:28:01] you bought up so say if you want one
[00:28:05] Outlaw you're saying if you want one L C
[00:28:07] set set and like if each you just bid up
[00:28:09] and add them together um if you're
[00:28:11] getting like two or three let me know
[00:28:13] which ones you want and I'll give you
[00:28:14] I'll tell you what they are and some and
[00:28:15] we'll give you a discount on them just
[00:28:17] because you get
[00:28:18] multiple that's kind of what I was
[00:28:19] getting at yeah say say hey I'm tell me
[00:28:22] like you know hey I want some Ravnica I
[00:28:24] want sorcery I mean personally I think
[00:28:26] sorcery's art is really cool but it's
[00:28:28] not magic different card game I like
[00:28:30] sorceries art a lot which is actually
[00:28:32] why I bought the um starter decks myself
[00:28:34] but say you like want to go with no
[00:28:36] ioria booster which is a very good one
[00:28:39] there and you wanted to go the Lost
[00:28:41] Cavern set and then say you wanted to
[00:28:43] Lost Cav's collector booster just say I
[00:28:45] wanted all three of those and I'll put
[00:28:48] I'll get you a little deal together and
[00:28:49] let you know how much it would be until
[00:28:51] tell you bid up to whatever it is and
[00:28:52] that's what it would
[00:28:53] be that's generally what I like to do
[00:28:55] here to help you guys out with uh and
[00:28:57] then you also get your a little boost
[00:28:59] too for whatever you get for your Boost
[00:29:00] for your encounter you got going
[00:29:04] on yeah you just kind of bid up to what
[00:29:06] you want or if you want multiples you
[00:29:08] can just say hey can I get these and
[00:29:10] I'll um I'll try to put a little deal
[00:29:11] together for
[00:29:13] you and then uh yeah then what um So
[00:29:17] currently we're in there I think we're
[00:29:19] going to trade our
[00:29:20] stuff I think we're going to trade some
[00:29:22] of our stuff here so we're going to
[00:29:24] trade
[00:29:25] in a leather jacket all
[00:29:29] right trading in one of those leather
[00:29:31] jackets for uh one of the armored

[00:36:26] beta right
[00:36:31] here now we Shuffle we always Shuffle
[00:36:33] those up so let's do that one from the
[00:36:36] top there because I was told I need to
[00:36:37] shuffle those cuz sorcery doesn't like
[00:36:39] they put them in like packs a a chunk of
[00:36:46] things yeah it's because sometimes I
[00:36:48] want a different thing that's why I
[00:36:51] streaming so that's why it sometimes
[00:36:53] works on YouTube and it sometimes
[00:36:54] doesn't and then a Lord of the Rings
[00:36:58] then a nice lure of the Rings
[00:37:00] here let's
[00:37:09] do I like that one I like that one that
[00:37:12] one felt good we're going to go with
[00:37:14] that
[00:37:15] one there we go put those over there
[00:37:20] here we are so you jumped in here to
[00:37:23] participate with our adventure here now
[00:37:26] that's what you're looking for right now
[00:37:27] now I just want to make sure this is
[00:37:29] correct I think we're right here but
[00:37:32] just want to be double checked to be
[00:37:35] sure and then uh as long as you're good
[00:37:38] looks good all right cool got 26 seconds
[00:37:40] there so I'll uh once that goes I'll
[00:37:42] take a quick screenshot of that and then
[00:37:45] I will let you continue our adventure
[00:37:47] here in our Wasteland and then what
[00:37:49] you'll do is you can continue through
[00:37:51] this uh shop that we have and then get
[00:37:54] out to our next encounter and see what
[00:37:55] happens I think that's a good plan
[00:38:02] I like to put my drink over there
[00:38:03] because I like it out of the way that
[00:38:04] way we don't have any uh issues with
[00:38:06] spilling on anything all right there we
[00:38:09] go my friend we got those and then I'll
[00:38:12] will put those up here for a screenshot
[00:38:14] so it is able to be
[00:38:16] seen and a picture
[00:38:19] taken where it goes there take a
[00:38:25] screenshot there you go
[00:38:28] done
[00:38:31] there all
[00:38:33] righty here you are now the way that I
[00:38:36] like to do this is we open these because
[00:38:40] it
[00:38:41] helps for your adventure so say you get
[00:38:44] a Mythic in here a Mythic in here or a
[00:38:47] Mythic in one of these that'll actually
[00:38:49] end up getting you plus one in your
[00:38:51] encounter if you get an elite in our
[00:38:54] pack here that gives you a plus one and
[00:38:56] if you get two mythics in this pack that
[00:38:58] gives you a plus one on the encounter so
[00:39:00] you actually could potentially have
[00:39:01] because you got all these you have one
[00:39:03] two three four
[00:39:06] five 6
[00:39:08] 7 8 9 10 11 you could potentially get a
[00:39:12] plus 11 in your encounter here for what
[00:39:15] you're going with in this and for what's
[00:39:17] going on here because of all these
[00:39:18] extras you can get o o oh my friend and
[00:39:22] tell are we going to rip all these open
[00:39:23] and
[00:39:24] check generally we do but I want to
[00:39:27] double check on it or do you want me to
[00:39:30] ship these back for you yes all right
[00:39:31] here we go now when we rip them I do
[00:39:34] minimize these put those away that way
[00:39:37] we can uh that way we can get
[00:39:40] in and

[00:45:18] at now that it's a hard time to remember
[00:45:20] all the prices of everything they

[00:45:29] other one in a top loader here no one
[00:45:31] ever really complains if you don't want
[00:45:33] me to do it I won't but I put them in a
[00:45:34] top loader back to back like this that
[00:45:37] way they uh don't slide out of the top
[00:45:40] loader when it comes to shipping or it
[00:45:41] slides out less I'll say there's a less
[00:45:43] of a chance to slide
[00:45:45] out all right here we go we got that one
[00:45:47] there no Mythic on that but you know
[00:45:49] what we're onto our sorcery we're going
[00:45:52] to find ourselves some cool Elite maybe
[00:45:54] a foil in here
[00:45:58] all right cool I appreciate that hot box
[00:46:00] yeah I like to do it because it helps to
[00:46:01] keep them um from sliding out during
[00:46:03] shipping cuz those um those ones I
[00:46:05] happen to get for whatever reason
[00:46:06] they're a little
[00:46:08] uh a little bigger than the others
[00:46:12] that's okay now let's see us a a nice
[00:46:15] Elite here all right I think these are
[00:46:18] in like the order where you see them
[00:46:19] Elite first kind of exceptional nice
[00:46:22] Cornerstone I love the art on these I
[00:46:25] think that's my favorite thing is the
[00:46:26] art on this
[00:46:28] like it's Play It's literal playable art
[00:46:29] it's not like CG
[00:46:33] stuff we got a uh an exceptional oh a
[00:46:37] lighthouse I don't have that one that's
[00:46:38] a nice looking one there with a wave
[00:46:39] going
[00:46:41] over that's cool with the wave going
[00:46:43] over like
[00:46:45] that nice shifting
[00:46:47] Sands oo unique
[00:46:50] mortal oh nice that's a good little hit
[00:46:53] I think unique I think munique is one of
[00:46:56] the top ones queen of
[00:46:59] Midland then you have ordinary magic
[00:47:02] lightning bolt
[00:47:03] there blood Raven I love the art with a
[00:47:06] raven in the eye on that Firebolts like
[00:47:10] like look at that you can just that
[00:47:11] looks like good that reminds me of just
[00:47:13] like I want to be part of this scared
[00:47:16] sacred
[00:47:17] scarabs sen hounds nice one there men of
[00:47:24] Lang swamp Buffalo

[00:47:44] droomer then a land
[00:47:47] surveyor and your uh humble Village
[00:47:51] which is your ordinary one there but I
[00:47:52] think this unique if I remember right
[00:47:54] unique is one of the good ones not it's
[00:47:56] not um an elite but unique is up there
[00:47:59] and that's a nice queen of Midland I
[00:48:00] don't have that
[00:48:02] one nice pretty card I love the art on
[00:48:04] these it's the art on that stuff that
[00:48:06] gets me so good have you had do you play
[00:48:08] any of that hot box by any
[00:48:10] chance or have you had a chance to play
[00:48:18] sorcery not yet ah if you do get a
[00:48:21] chance to I mean you can see the art
[00:48:22] there personally I will have to say that
[00:48:25] is better than most most of the art
[00:48:27] that's been coming out with magic
[00:48:29] recently so I will have to that's one of
[00:48:32] the things that I like about it just a
[00:48:35] just a you know my personal opinion I
[00:48:37] like the drawn ART versus the CG art is
[00:48:40] my I guess is what it
[00:48:41] is yeah yeah and I think that's why I
[00:48:44] like that that's I like it so much say

[01:09:07] going to happen there and with be
[01:09:08] immobilize it is 1 to 15 on
[01:09:11] mobilizing oh you got it look at that
[01:09:13] lucky that was so close sweet minage has
[01:09:16] to mobilize the front one so the front
[01:09:18] one misses a turn now the back one being
[01:09:20] right next to our sir bark lot normally
[01:09:23] I chat be the the here but Chad isn't
[01:09:26] helping right now what is the enemy
[01:09:28] going to do are they going to do a tail
[01:09:29] whip or they going to try to bite sir
[01:09:32] barkot tail whip is minus one a bite is
[01:09:36] a minus three a tail whip is a 1 to 15
[01:09:40] and a bite is a one to uh tail whip all
[01:09:43] right three you hit it with a tail whip
[01:09:47] sir bark lot tail
[01:09:50] whips got gets a minus one to your dog
[01:09:55] bring it down to 12 because you have
[01:09:58] that extra right now there you go now
[01:10:02] back to the beginning Englebert can go
[01:10:04] now because he's no longer distracted
[01:10:05] what's Englebert going to
[01:10:07] do and remember you guys you can jump in
[01:10:10] and purchase up to whatever packs you
[01:10:11] want to participate in the Wasteland
[01:10:13] here all
[01:10:20] right attack the front one all right
[01:10:23] Englebert is going to try to attack the
[01:10:24] front one
[01:10:25] and angle bird I think angle bird is
[01:10:27] going to go after them with the H short
[01:10:30] sword short short small sword small
[01:10:33] sword that's a 1 to 15 chance oh hit him
[01:10:36] with a 12 nice 12 definitely got a hit
[01:10:39] on that one now with that you get it in
[01:10:43] the character hit right now where you
[01:10:46] hit the gator Dow with 12 is in the head
[01:10:49] so that's a plus one by hitting it in
[01:10:51] the head then you already have a plus
[01:10:53] one on your strength then you have a
[01:10:55] plus one on that attack so that's a plus
[01:10:58] three and a regular attack is one so
[01:11:00] that is a four attack hit right there
[01:11:03] wow minus four again another minus
[01:11:08] four minus four attack on the front one
[01:11:11] bringing it down to five good job on
[01:11:14] that nice all right now we're still
[01:11:18] going here is now up to
[01:11:21] evilin what is evilin going to do
[01:11:23] anybody want to jump in as the character
[01:11:25] V
[01:11:29] in anyone all right well then I
[01:11:35] say Evelyn is going to try the uzi
[01:11:38] again she's going to try the
[01:11:41] uzi on the front one that's what we're
[01:11:45] going to do the uzi on the front one cuz
[01:11:47] the uzi the the back one is you know
[01:11:50] what maybe we do we but the back one is
[01:11:52] pretty close to our dog we don't want to
[01:11:54] hit our Dogo so we're going to do it on
[01:11:55] the front one the uzi is a a
[01:11:58] 50/50 oh no misses again with 20 on the
[01:12:03] uzi
[01:12:06] no losing three more
[01:12:09] bullets bring it down to Six Bullets oh
[01:12:12] no
[01:12:15] again I know she doesn't have the
[01:12:16] strength to hold the uzi somebody gave
[01:12:18] it to her even though I did say that it
[01:12:20] needs strength to be held it's your guys
[01:12:23] Choice maybe if you want to take after
[01:12:25] this part of the encounter if you want
[01:12:26] to trade some weapons and maybe give it
[01:12:28] to someone
[01:12:29] else that might help because you know
[01:12:32] say Englebert with three strength has it
[01:12:36] he'll be able to hold it and make it a 1
[01:12:38] to 15 out of it for you when you roll
[01:12:42] I've said that before but I've hav't
[01:12:43] ignored multiple times but anyways we're
[01:12:45] going to go on she's lost this this
[01:12:48] chick she's lost it multiple
[01:12:52] times why is this doing that already
[01:12:54] started
[01:12:55] what is
[01:12:59] it why is it saying that's already
[01:13:11] started why is it sa already starting
[01:13:13] can you see the auction running at all
[01:13:15] by any
[01:13:18] chance well
[01:13:23] anyway I don't know that's what they
[01:13:25] said interesting it interesting all
[01:13:28] right I might I think I got a little bit
[01:13:30] of glitch going on right here give me
[01:13:32] one second here
[01:13:55] all right there we
[01:14:00] go was there we go let fix that now that

[01:49:08] seves in your top loaders I forgot to
[01:49:10] put them in the top loaders for you like
[01:49:12] I'm sitting there looking at them on the
[01:49:13] screen I'm like I have a feeling I'm
[01:49:14] supposed to do something there I'm put
[01:49:16] those with those in there with the top
[01:49:17] loader cuz the ulog and the skull clamp
[01:49:21] I think was a couple the last time I
[01:49:30] checked there that's what I was doing I
[01:49:32] was getting silly in forgetting
[01:49:36] things there you go all your stuff is
[01:49:38] together my friend hot
[01:49:41] box there you go and we are going to uh
[01:49:45] keep running this here and currently our
[01:49:48] stage of the battle is we're fighting
[01:49:52] against the other ones and we had the
[01:49:56] US sweet vinage missed we're gonna have
[01:50:00] a bite attack on one of them from our
[01:50:02] dog there that is a that is a one to 15
[01:50:06] oh we got luckily a bite attack
[01:50:09] Perfecto bite attack on it bring it down
[01:50:13] three down to four so you have them at
[01:50:16] three five and four what do you want to
[01:50:18] do for these for these um zombie like
[01:50:21] humans that are controlled by the
[01:50:23] control
[01:50:25] Vine we're going to go I say I say we

[01:50:32] big long sword what do you think oh it
[01:50:36] hits this
[01:50:37] time now who do we hit with this with
[01:50:40] the
[01:50:41] sword I
[01:50:43] say probably a good idea that the short
[01:50:45] the long sword does plus one plus three
[01:50:48] so if we hit one of them we can kill one
[01:50:51] off should we kill one off

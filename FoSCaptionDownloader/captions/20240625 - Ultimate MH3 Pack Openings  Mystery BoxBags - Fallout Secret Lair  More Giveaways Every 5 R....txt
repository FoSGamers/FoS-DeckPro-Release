[00:21:00] their stuff in there and when it
[00:21:02] was the only open a little bit on the

[00:31:03] out see I don't get to keep all these
[00:31:05] things I'm not an exceptionally wealthy
[00:31:07] person so I have to I have to sell stuff
[00:31:10] to be able to have fun and op of hacks
[00:31:11] with you guys so that being said we do
[00:31:15] have a little bit of time hey
[00:31:20] Buck I did not open some MX 3 for myself
[00:31:23] yesterday
[00:31:26] but that was one of the things were
[00:31:28] going to be doing either I was thinking
[00:31:30] uh later today because I actually
[00:31:33] decided my somebody was talking about
[00:31:34] sorcery yesterday we decided to open
[00:31:36] some sorcery instead you guys saw
[00:31:39] earlier we got this in though we got
[00:31:42] part of our shipment in we have one
[00:31:45] two three four five six I should have
[00:31:50] two more coming in today and tomorrow
[00:31:53] for those that you want modern Horizon
[00:31:56] and then I will open up I think it's
[00:31:58] probably going to be tomorrow after I
[00:31:59] open up our sorcery box today and that's
[00:32:01] probably what we're going to end up
[00:32:02] doing is doing the sorcery box today and
[00:32:05] then I will open up that tomorrow sorry
[00:32:07] about that my uh it came in I didn't get
[00:32:09] everything in so I want to make sure I
[00:32:11] get everything in before I start opening
[00:32:13] in opening this stuff when I can sell
[00:32:15] because I was supposed I have to sell
[00:32:16] all of them to be able afford to open
[00:32:19] that one pack box for you guys if can
[00:32:21] case there's like problems and there's
[00:32:22] like you know it's a shitty box and
[00:32:24] there's nothing to sell out of it so if
[00:32:26] that's that so because that I have to
[00:32:28] have all of them I want to make sure I
[00:32:30] have all of them before I start doing it
[00:32:32] I was supposed to have them all
[00:32:33] yesterday they did not come all in
[00:32:35] yesterday Sumer supposed to come in
[00:32:37] today and I think tomorrow is when I'm
[00:32:40] supposed to get them in if I can guar if
[00:32:42] I can check again but if I get all men
[00:32:44] there will be only one more that I'll be
[00:32:46] missing if there's only the one missing
[00:32:47] I think I can do it tomorrow so that's
[00:32:50] kind of like sorry about that buck it
[00:32:52] was I was planning on it but I didn't
[00:32:53] have everything come in and I want to
[00:32:55] make sure it all comes in before I start
[00:32:58] doing that
[00:32:59] because if I do I'm if I don't I can't
[00:33:01] keep doing the show I actually lose
[00:33:02] money and I won't be able to do the
[00:33:09] show so long story short
[00:33:13] tomorrow hopefully everything comes to
[00:33:16] this afternoon that I'm supposed to get
[00:33:19] and I'll do it tomorrow all right that's
[00:33:22] the plan I was supposed to have
[00:33:23] everything but it did not all come so we
[00:33:26] had to back the plan off a little bit
[00:33:28] but right now I'm going to open up see
[00:33:30] this is I'm not going to shuffle any of
[00:33:31] these so I've been told that these come
[00:33:33] in different stacks of you can like get
[00:33:35] batches so I want to see what happens
[00:33:37] here because I'm opening this myself so
[00:33:39] we don't need to worry about it
[00:33:40] shuffling I want to see what we get for
[00:33:41] batches so I'm just going to go down
[00:33:44] should we start with the left side or

[01:14:55] another uh you know it's a made by
[01:14:59] contested Realms here you know that's
[01:15:02] uh that's what it is there that's why
[01:15:04] it's a completely different game right
[01:15:07] now than magic we have sorcery in here
[01:15:17] also so that's why that is looking that
[01:15:20] way there you go
[01:15:22] Captain it's a fun game here it's a fun
[01:15:25] game that we get to play that you guys
[01:15:26] can play it's kind of like a combination

[01:15:53] this is the only time I've seen that
[01:15:55] card pulled out from
[01:15:56] anywhere so we'll see what that one's
[01:15:58] worth that one might be actually worth a
[01:16:00] little pretty
[01:16:02] penny we'll find
[01:16:06] out at some point I'll look those up but

[03:01:25] avalene dryads we got pretty
[03:01:29] patient deep sea mermaids cave
[03:01:33] trolls
[03:01:35] sleep rlin Nomads Muk Lam
[03:01:41] sandworm and a lone
[03:01:46] Tower I have
[03:01:48] um some that are unopen that I have beta
[03:01:51] ones that are unopen that I was debating
[03:01:53] on
[03:01:54] keeping um but if somebody really wanted
[03:01:57] them I
[03:01:58] might open the box and sell them because
[03:02:01] I have a whole s whole box together or
[03:02:03] maybe you want the whole thing of them
[03:02:05] if that's the case maybe I don't know
[03:02:07] I'd have to think about that one um but
[03:02:09] I do have precon whole thing of preons I
[03:02:11] use them myself is what I
[03:02:13] use I use those and we've been upgrading
[03:02:16] them a little bit playing with them as
[03:02:17] we play kind of getting used to
[03:02:24] him oh I don't know I haven't even
[03:02:27] thought about
[03:02:28] it let me let me think
[03:02:32] um all right let me look
[03:02:40] here let's do something
[03:02:43] here let's do this here
[03:02:54] [Music]
[03:03:01] I mean probably like I don't know I have
[03:03:05] to think about that
[03:03:08] one probably around 50 because I'd want
[03:03:10] to keep them if I nobody wanted it I
[03:03:12] wouldn't care that's probably what I
[03:03:14] would put it
[03:03:15] at I'm thinking if nobody takes it I'd
[03:03:18] keep them because I don't
[03:03:20] care that's probably what I'd end up
[03:03:23] doing but if you really want it let me
[03:03:25] know give and let me think about it
[03:03:27] maybe give me a little bit of time to
[03:03:28] the end of the show to think about it
[03:03:30] because if you
[03:03:31] do I do have
[03:03:33] one still available I was just planning
[03:03:37] on holding on to it so yeah it's up to
[03:03:39] you maybe if you really really want it
[03:03:41] let me know I'll I'll put some thought
[03:03:43] into
[03:03:45] it let's open this one though and see
[03:03:47] what we got here
[03:03:49] yeah there are some preons available I
[03:03:51] mean another thing too with it I will

How do you set your own thumbnail for a YouTube short video? I can't seem to figure out how to do that. Please help me figure that out.

Setting a custom thumbnail for a YouTube Short can be a bit tricky because YouTube currently doesn't allow you to directly upload a custom thumbnail for Shorts using the mobile app or the desktop version in the same way you would for a regular video. However, there's a workaround that you can use to achieve this:

### 1. **Upload Your Video as a Regular Video First:**
   - Start by uploading your video as a regular video, not as a Short.
   - When you do this, you’ll have the option to add a custom thumbnail during the upload process.

### 2. **Add Your Custom Thumbnail:**
   - In the video upload process, you’ll see an option to upload a custom thumbnail.
   - Upload your desired thumbnail.

### 3. **Publish the Video:**
   - After setting your thumbnail, publish the video.

### 4. **Change the Video to a Short:**
   - Once the video is published with the custom thumbnail, you can edit the video’s description and title to ensure it qualifies as a Short (under 60 seconds in length and a 9:16 aspect ratio).
   - The video will then appear as a Short on the Shorts shelf with your custom thumbnail.

### 5. **Trim the Video (if necessary):**
   - If the video is longer than 60 seconds or not in a 9:16 aspect ratio, you might need to trim or crop it before uploading it initially.

### Alternative Method: Using a Third-Party Tool
Another method involves using third-party video editing software to embed your custom thumbnail into the video. Some tools allow you to create a frame in the video that serves as the thumbnail, but this approach is less flexible than the method above.

### Summary:
To set a custom thumbnail for a YouTube Short, upload the video as a regular video first, add your custom thumbnail during the upload process, and then modify the video to meet the Shorts criteria.

[00:10:34] look at that we got one of the spots
[00:10:36] taken I like it when that means we're
[00:10:38] going to have three more spots left in
[00:10:41] our break for anyone that wants to go
[00:10:43] after it and that's the dgen break where
[00:10:44] we have a demonic tutor or the um you're
[00:10:47] going to get a DUS MN pack think
[00:10:50] the um the dingy testing didn't I got
[00:10:53] the motor on and everything but it was
[00:10:54] uh we had to deal with some other things
[00:10:55] and I didn't get on right away so we're
[00:10:57] going to have to test it out this
[00:10:57] morning here a little while but uh the
[00:11:00] on the have enough energy the yeah I was
[00:11:03] almost dead last night I that's why I
[00:11:05] didn't do a show last night I almost
[00:11:06] passed out like straight out past out
[00:11:08] like standing that's how tired I
[00:11:11] was so I uh so I did not get to testing
[00:11:14] it I got it on there but I mean it's a
[00:11:16] you know it's a 100 lb 80 lb motor and
[00:11:19] then setting everything up and I had to
[00:11:20] figure out how to get our winch fix so
[00:11:22] that the reason I took so long was our
[00:11:23] winch our um our um winch for the um
[00:11:32] DAV it
[00:11:33] lift the button for it wasn't working
[00:11:36] and I couldn't figure out why and I had
[00:11:37] to reset everything and then the next
[00:11:39] thing was the problem was um I was
[00:11:41] running into was we found out I couldn't
[00:11:44] get it all the go I was resetting stuff
[00:11:45] trying to get things to go it just
[00:11:46] wouldn't start well I was searching all
[00:11:48] over trying to figure everything out and
[00:11:50] eventually it ended up being a uh the
[00:11:52] I'm like there's a fuse I couldn't find
[00:11:54] a fuse I'm like there's a fuse blown
[00:11:55] this has got to be it there's no power
[00:11:56] going to it power going to everything
[00:11:58] else but no not this run around trying
[00:12:00] to find it Well the fuse is in a
[00:12:01] different hole that I wasn't aware of so
[00:12:03] somebody came over and helped us from
[00:12:05] the the place here and lo looked that
[00:12:07] goes like Oh the fuse is loose and he's
[00:12:09] like checking other stuff like the fuse
[00:12:10] is out cuz you can see in the fuse box
[00:12:12] that whoever put the fuse back in um
[00:12:15] didn't cover the top of the box so the
[00:12:16] fuse must have popped out and like slid
[00:12:19] out and was barely hanging in when they
[00:12:21] were uh when they sailed over here is my
[00:12:23] guess but that is a nice pickup on those
[00:12:26] cards there Nolan those are nice pick so
[00:12:29] yeah so that was the majority of my day
[00:12:31] yesterday figuring that out I almost I I
[00:12:33] was killing myself doing that we'll run
[00:12:35] this as an auction see if we can get

[00:27:19] where you're going remember I know all
[00:27:21] righty there you go BOGO a we're on a
[00:27:26] stop it buddy don't need to be too
[00:27:29] loud but yeah we were um shipping work I
[00:27:32] have it figured out where I am going to
[00:27:34] be sending things well one I have to
[00:27:37] come back here so it's going to be about
[00:27:38] a week or two I tell that's why I have
[00:27:39] it in the chat everything is going be a
[00:27:41] week to two weeks sometimes to get this
[00:27:43] first round back cuz I have it set up
[00:27:44] with the war airhouse and getting
[00:27:46] everything over there I just want to
[00:27:47] make sure it's done correctly cuz I have
[00:27:48] a warehouse that we're working
[00:27:50] on um to be able to do these things and
[00:27:54] play and stuff like that have fun with
[00:27:55] you
[00:27:56] guys so that's why I have that that's
[00:27:59] what I have set up now um and then so
[00:28:01] they'll all go to Warehouse they'll drop
[00:28:03] shift everything from here that I open
[00:28:04] and also you'll end up being able to buy
[00:28:06] packs at like a cheaper price from the
[00:28:07] warehouse so which is kind of nice too
[00:28:09] so for instance say you were going to
[00:28:11] get a pack of cards and here I you know
[00:28:13] I sell it at say $7 it might be $6 from
[00:28:16] the warehouse or something like that cuz
[00:28:18] $1 or or like you know uh or what you
[00:28:22] know something along that line Ty thing
[00:28:23] cuz um that way it just when when it
[00:28:25] comes to Warehouse you're not going to
[00:28:26] get a sticker you won't get um it won't
[00:28:29] be the same like exact like opening
[00:28:30] everything obviously it's just going to
[00:28:31] be the pack they'll wrap it in you know
[00:28:34] bubble wrap mailer and ship it on out to
[00:28:35] you or whatever you get so that's what
[00:28:37] we're going to plan on doing we are on a
[00:28:38] boat now yes we are George Hamilton we
[00:28:41] are currently on a boat
[00:28:43] streaming streaming on a boat right now
[00:28:47] that is correct we are actually in the
[00:28:49] middle of billionaires Jeff bezos's
[00:28:52] Boats here right now uhhuh uh we're like

[00:33:10] three Mo uh trip with uh three motors on
[00:33:13] it um and it was being towed behind the
[00:33:18] 100ft bearing or 80ft bearing boat
[00:33:21] bearinger which is like a a an
[00:33:23] expedition boat that you can go out in

[01:06:01] tomorrow if I decide to go through
[01:06:03] everything count what I have and put it
[01:06:04] in but my guess was be once I get
[01:06:07] literally everything to be able to bring
[01:06:08] on the boat was I was guaranteeing like
[01:06:10] I was going to do it then but um if I
[01:06:12] don't have the time to what I was end up
[01:06:15] doing would be um if if we don't get
[01:06:17] back to the boat and say it's going to
[01:06:18] be instead of like two weeks to get back
[01:06:20] it's going to be closer to a month to
[01:06:21] get back to our house then I'll end up
[01:06:23] going through and um taking care of the
[01:06:24] stuff here and doing it and getting me
[01:06:26] in the buy now again making it easy for
[01:06:28] everybody because I just don't have
[01:06:29] everything organized and what I have
[01:06:31] today and what is available so that's
[01:06:33] what my problem is I don't want to go
[01:06:34] and say hey yeah I can do this and then
[01:06:36] I don't have those because I didn't
[01:06:38] bring them with me so I had to go
[01:06:40] through and just cut count I have to
[01:06:42] just go through and count everything so
[01:06:44] that we're aware of what we have so I
[01:06:47] can be 100% sure because I just kind of
[01:06:48] packed up as much as possible to bring

[01:22:43] eight you're going to have to drop
[01:22:44] something Luke if you want to continue
[01:22:46] on here and then

[01:23:16] flamethrower and um AR with 15 rounds of
[01:23:21] ammo so that's two three four five 6 7
[01:23:26] yes you have to decide you had uh you
[01:23:28] had gotten a buff there yesterday I do
[01:23:31] believe so let's go over your orders
[01:23:33] from yesterday so we can see
[01:23:42] that I don't know what's going on right
[01:23:44] now hold
[01:23:51] on there we go so you had
[01:24:01] yesterday see
[01:24:06] here Luke had a critical hit and a plus
[01:24:10] 10
[01:24:14] Health
[01:24:17] spicy I don't think you got anything
[01:24:19] else other than that Luke did that was
[01:24:21] the only one that got that so he's plus
[01:24:23] 10 and a yeah so that's what you have
[01:24:26] you have a critical and a plus 10 on
[01:24:27] your health Luke you have to decide what
[01:24:29] you want to
[01:24:35] do all right all right guys so Nico you
[01:24:39] want the
[01:24:41] um who wants a health we have health

[01:24:48] Health bring you up to 86 Health all
[01:24:50] right
[01:24:52] spicy um and then and the
[01:25:00] AR um doesn't g go to anybody right now
[01:25:04] you can throw it over to um maybe Miss
[01:25:06] Nico could handle it I think because I
[01:25:09] think she has some room available we'll
[01:25:11] throw it over to miss Niko instead the
[01:25:12] AR one
[01:25:19] AR she can she'll have two of them then
[01:25:23] two ARS
[01:25:26] you me do that if you'd
[01:25:29] like all right there you go so there go
[01:25:32] spicy Miss Nico got an AR there you
[01:25:39] go there we are main battle page there
[01:25:42] you
[01:25:44] go then spicy you get that get that you

[01:25:50] are set dual ARS you cannot dual AR yet
[01:25:53] maybe in the future who
[01:25:55] knows poking awake Miss
[01:25:58] Nico that's funny but yeah we have some
[01:26:01] fun things set up for you guys I mean uh

[02:23:55] all right we're heading on out to the
[02:23:57] adventure all right
[02:24:00] everyone
[02:24:02] so you are all wandering you enter this
[02:24:05] Wasteland
[02:24:06] Vault you start wandering through a
[02:24:10] hallway with some computers on it and
[02:24:12] you're like hm
[02:24:15] intriguing and you see a
[02:24:19] door but
[02:24:21] you open that door and behind it you see
[02:24:26] some ghouls criming out to the ground
[02:24:29] and treasure in the
[02:24:34] background now you have four ghouls one
[02:24:39] is a large one which is 40 Health the
[02:24:42] other one two mediums which is a 30
[02:24:45] health and a 25
[02:24:47] health and then you have two small BS
[02:24:51] which are only 15 Health a piece all
[02:24:54] right so you got to
[02:24:56] decide what you want to
[02:24:59] do coming up here with
[02:25:04] everybody all
[02:25:12] right no what is this
[02:25:14] doing
[02:25:17] so you have your characters up there
[02:25:21] you have that going on what are you
[02:25:23] going to do you're going to go with a
[02:25:24] critical hit on the big guy oh I like
[02:25:25] the idea critical hit what dice are you
[02:25:27] using my friend because we're going to
[02:25:28] see what we add on to
[02:25:31] it Luke says critical hit and they going
[02:25:34] to Flame them after all right
[02:25:36] Luke critical hit on the big guy with
[02:25:39] the purple one and are you going to use
[02:25:41] your what G what weapon are you going to
[02:25:42] use you going to use your Gat I'm
[02:25:43] guessing that way you can get six nice
[02:25:46] shots off
[02:25:51] all right so you need to have 18 or more
[02:25:55] for the big guy now with that big guy
[02:25:58] though you already have plus one on
[02:26:00] engineering and your Gatling which gives
[02:26:02] you plus seven okay for this attempt so
[02:26:06] you need an 11 or
[02:26:08] larger oh come
[02:26:12] on it was a
[02:26:15] six

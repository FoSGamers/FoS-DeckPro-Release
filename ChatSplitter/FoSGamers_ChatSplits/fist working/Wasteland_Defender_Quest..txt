### Creating the CSV File

Let's create the updated CSV file with these revised prompts and responses to ensure all necessary prompts are available and make sense.



[2024-05-22 06:23:53] FoSGamers:
Provide me with exactly how the randomization would work for each one of the responses that involves using one of the character prompts.

[2024-05-22 06:24:29] ChatGPT:
Certainly! Below are examples of how you could implement the randomization for each response involving a character prompt. I will provide a simple algorithm that uses a random number generator to determine success or failure, hit points, and item drops.

### Randomization Implementation

#### Defense Phase
1. **Defense Announcement:**
    - Prompt: "Raiders attacking North Wall! Roll to defend. (Type 'roll')"
    - Randomization:
        ```python
        import random

        def roll_defend():
            roll = random.randint(1, 20)
            if roll >= 10:
                return "Defense successful! You found a medkit."
            else:
                return "Defense failed. Raiders breached. Lose 5 HP."
        ```

2. **Success/Failure Example:**
    - Same logic for other defense announcements:
        ```python
        def roll_defend_south_gate():
            roll = random.randint(1, 20)
            if roll >= 10:
                return "Defense successful! You found a rusty rifle."
            else:
                return "Defense failed. Raiders breached. Lose 5 HP."
        ```

#### Wasteland Exploration
3. **Exploration Choice:**
    - Prompt: "Explore Abandoned Factory or Ruined Highway? (Type 'Factory' or 'Highway')"
    - Randomization:
        ```python
        def roll_encounter(location):
            roll = random.randint(1, 20)
            if location == 'Factory':
                if roll >= 10:
                    return "Ambush in the factory! Roll to fight. (Type 'roll')"
                else:
                    return "You found a clue leading to Raider Hideout."
            elif location == 'Highway':
                if roll >= 10:
                    return "Ambush on the highway! Roll to fight. (Type 'roll')"
                else:
                    return "You found a clue leading to Raider Hideout."
        ```

4. **Encounter in Factory/Highway:**
    - Randomization:
        ```python
        def roll_fight():
            roll = random.randint(1, 20)
            if roll >= 10:
                return "Fight successful! You found a medkit."
            else:
                return "Fight failed. Lose 5 HP."
        ```

#### Final Showdown
5. **Final Battle Announcement:**
    - Prompt: "Confronting Raider Leader at the hideout. Roll to attack. (Type 'roll')"
    - Randomization:
        ```python
        def roll_final_battle():
            roll = random.randint(1, 20)
            if roll >= 10:
                return "Raiders defeated and leader eliminated! Haven is safe thanks to your bravery."
            else:
                return "Battle failed. The raider leader escapes. Lose 10 HP."
        ```

#### Item Management and Random Events
6. **Find Item:**
    - Prompt: "You found a rusty rifle. Add to inventory? (Type 'Yes' or 'No')"
    - Randomization:
        ```python
        def find_item():
            items = ["medkit", "rusty rifle", "ammo", "armor piece"]
            return f"You found a {random.choice(items)}. Add to inventory? (Type 'Yes' or 'No')"
        ```

7. **Heal Player:**
    - Prompt: "Medic heals you for 10 HP."
    - Randomization:
        ```python
        def heal_player():
            heal_points = random.randint(5, 15)
            return f"Medic heals you for {heal_points} HP."
        ```

8. **Trap Set:**
    - Prompt: "Engineer sets a trap at the South Gate."
    - Randomization:
        ```python
        def set_trap():
            success_rate = random.randint(1, 20)
            if success_rate >= 10:
                return "Trap set successfully at the South Gate."
            else:
                return "Trap setting failed."
        ```

9. **Scout Report:**
    - Prompt: "Scout reports raider movement near the East Market."
    - Randomization:
        ```python
        def scout_report():
            reports = ["raider movement near the East Market", "no raider activity detected", "suspicious activity near the North Wall"]
            return f"Scout reports {random.choice(reports)}."
        ```

10. **Hunt Raiders:**
    - Prompt: "Hunter tracks raiders to the abandoned factory. Engage? (Type 'Yes' or 'No')"
    - Randomization:
        ```python
        def hunt_raiders():
            success_rate = random.randint(1, 20)
            if success_rate >= 10:
                return "Raiders tracked successfully. Prepare for engagement."
            else:
                return "Lost the trail. Try again later."
        ```

11. **Upgrade Defense:**
    - Prompt: "Engineer upgrades defenses at North Wall. +10 to defense rolls."
    - Randomization:
        ```python
        def upgrade_defense():
            success_rate = random.randint(1, 20)
            if success_rate >= 10:
                return "Defense upgrade successful. +10 to defense rolls."
            else:
                return "Defense upgrade failed."
        ```

12. **Random Event:**
    - Prompt: "A sandstorm approaches. Find shelter? (Type 'Yes' or 'No')"
    - Randomization:
        ```python
        def random_event():
            events = ["A sandstorm approaches. Find shelter? (Type 'Yes' or 'No')", "A raider patrol is nearby. Hide or confront? (Type 'Hide' or 'Confront')", "A supply drop is spotted. Retrieve it? (Type 'Retrieve' or 'Ignore')"]
            return random.choice(events)
        ```

You can integrate these randomization functions into your chatbot to dynamically generate the responses based on user actions and random rolls.

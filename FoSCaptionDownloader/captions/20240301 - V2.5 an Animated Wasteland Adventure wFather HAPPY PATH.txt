[00:15:58] jumped in and bought some packs and I
[00:16:00] was just uh we're just waiting for him
[00:16:01] to figure out
[00:16:04] what wants to tell me for pulling out
[00:16:06] our packs
[00:16:14] here allergies hold on ah sneeze didn't
[00:16:18] come random on everything all right
[00:16:22] we're GNA

[00:16:26] one then we're going to go
[00:16:32] right here
[00:16:34] two and I'm going to say when you say

[00:16:38] going to go random on everything maybe
[00:16:40] with the pull things on the game too or
[00:16:42] just uh just the packs there but either
[00:16:44] way what we'll do with our game is you
[00:16:46] can let me know what character you'd
[00:16:48] like to be you have that at the top
[00:16:50] there and we're going to see what
[00:16:51] happens you get to choose your character
[00:16:54] now and you're GNA see what occurs on
[00:16:56] your adventure through the Wasteland
[00:16:58] should be at the top showing you the
[00:17:00] pluses and minuses on
[00:17:02] everything if you want to and you get
[00:17:05] one two strength on your adventure to
[00:17:08] start
[00:17:11] off and you can always tell me random
[00:17:13] for everything or you can tell me
[00:17:15] specifically where to go being the first
[00:17:17] one of the day we always do like to give
[00:17:19] a little more of an explanation so you
[00:17:21] get plus or minus one here plus or minus
[00:17:23] one here A plus or minus one here for
[00:17:26] your character to fight the boss at the
[00:17:28] end now does the boss drop some loot
[00:17:31] or does the boss have an
[00:17:40] issue we shall
[00:17:47] see what what is the
[00:17:51] uh what's the red button I must you must
[00:17:55] know so the red button is a um you press
[00:17:58] it and uh you get a a you shoot off a
[00:18:04] missile you're gonna be a tech all right
[00:18:07] and that missile once it gets shot off
[00:18:10] it's either going to land blow back up
[00:18:13] on Earth with nothing or you're going to
[00:18:16] get a pack maybe you're going to take
[00:18:17] out a satellite or maybe you're G to go

[00:42:29] three packs obviously you can get a
[00:42:33] uh more strength for your character as
[00:42:37] you wander through the Wasteland but
[00:42:38] sometimes you know maybe you don't want
[00:42:40] more strength maybe you want to try your
[00:42:41] luck on something uh I don't know we'll
[00:42:44] see all right everybody we only had one
[00:42:47] attempt here now remember I do multiple
[00:42:49] giveaways throughout the day if we can
[00:42:51] get some of our auctions going here or
[00:42:54] maybe you guys uh want to do your own
[00:42:56] build your own so you can let me know
[00:42:59] that by building your own we're going to
[00:43:01] put this one up here because I have
[00:43:03] built it for you at the
[00:43:05] moment and see if you're interested in
[00:43:09] it this one is going to go on here
[00:43:13] for if it
[00:43:16] saves let's put that down there for
[00:43:21] this then there you go go wandering
[00:43:24] through the Wasteland
[00:43:27] maybe you're going to be a
[00:43:30] technician as you wander
[00:43:33] through do you want to be a strong human
[00:43:36] trudging through the Wasteland the
[00:43:37] barren
[00:43:39] Wasteland what is it that you'd like to
[00:43:41] be on this
[00:43:44] trip this is just a little game um I'm
[00:43:47] preparing for um Fallout I have a
[00:43:49] version 3.0 I wanted to make sure you
[00:43:51] guys actually had I was trying to do
[00:43:53] something it was it was only going to be
[00:43:54] two versions but I had um I had to make
[00:43:56] a couple adjustments that I wasn't
[00:43:57] planning on so there's going to be a 3.0
[00:44:00] actually but anyways the whole point of
[00:44:01] it was I have the animations I'm kind of
[00:44:03] going through our little game here and
[00:44:05] what happens is you can pick your
[00:44:07] character in the game as you R trund
[00:44:11] trundle trudge through the uh Wasteland
[00:44:16] you pick wrong word through my mind I
[00:44:19] don't know why trudge through the
[00:44:20] Wasteland you pick between your boxes
[00:44:23] here where you get pluses or minuses for
[00:44:25] the strength of your character
[00:44:26] three of them potentially and that
[00:44:28] decides whether or not you can beat the
[00:44:30] boss at the end to get the loot the boss
[00:44:33] drops was a spin which is a spin of a uh
[00:44:35] of a pack wheel or if you have to wander
[00:44:39] back to the Vault to see what you find
[00:44:42] there beaten now with that being said
[00:44:46] we're going to put these up here for our
[00:44:48] packs I think I put them up here minute
[00:44:50] ago I'll put them up again and you can
[00:44:52] pick your own at the top I will put it
[00:44:54] up here these are your PS in your
[00:44:56] strength and how it works actually is
[00:44:59] all the price of everything also so if
[00:45:01] you want to attempt to get your own you
[00:45:04] can and you can just build your own
[00:45:06] character strength without me having to
[00:45:08] do it for you now I do um you can do a a
[00:45:11] like generally we go up to like four
[00:45:14] three strength up to four packs but if
[00:45:17] you want if I do something special every
[00:45:19] now and again I throw something special
[00:45:21] on where you get a little bit
[00:45:24] more or you can go with Commander
[00:45:27] Masters and each one of the commander
[00:45:28] Masters is two strength so it's
[00:45:30] potential you could actually come out
[00:45:32] and beat five of the um characters in
[00:45:35] The Wasteland
[00:45:37] Adventure but that's what it is there
[00:45:40] I'm going to put these ones on for
[00:45:41] somebody if they want to try it random
[00:45:44] packs that I have guys I keep telling
[00:45:45] you random packs that I have that's all
[00:45:47] I'm doing and if you want to choose
[00:45:49] something you can I don't need to keep
[00:45:51] putting him up here you can do it you
[00:45:54] can do it

[01:04:14] you're choosing a strong human now as a
[01:04:18] strong human you start wandering through
[01:04:21] the Wasteland and you see things as you
[01:04:24] W what you
[01:04:26] need for your strength here are these
[01:04:30] things all right you go and you
[01:04:34] find randomly here this is what we're
[01:04:38] going with and you see this and you
[01:04:42] go what is going to go on my friend you
[01:04:45] find a treasure oh no a treasure does
[01:04:49] not help a strong human and sadly I do
[01:04:51] only have the happy path right now for
[01:04:53] the animations
[01:04:55] strong human goes and they bite the
[01:04:57] treasure and oh my
[01:04:59] tooth oh no I lose a strength as I
[01:05:02] wander through the Wasteland but that is
[01:05:04] okay I have three strength still
[01:05:07] wandering through this Wasteland then we
[01:05:09] come upon paon maybe it is a friend

[01:05:16] decks I do have some decks Jupiter I'll
[01:05:19] show you in a minute as you wander
[01:05:21] through this Wasteland you come across a
[01:05:25] clue and with a clue that
[01:05:28] does help I believe that does help our
[01:05:34] strong human on the adventure through
[01:05:37] the
[01:05:38] Wasteland so the strong human on this
[01:05:40] adventure adventure through Wasteland
[01:05:42] finds a little bit of a friend on their
[01:05:45] walk and now they are at one two three
[01:05:49] four strength again with their friend as
[01:05:53] they wander through the
[01:05:55] Wasteland now this human they stumble
[01:05:58] upon another creature or is it a friend
[01:06:02] is it a foe we are not sure this human
[01:06:05] is looking for a friend in the Wasteland
[01:06:08] now I'll show you some decks here in a
[01:06:09] little bit little pup with it yeah

[01:06:57] multiple bosses here there are two
[01:07:00] bosses you could beat with strength like

[01:24:25] one two three with collector boosters
[01:24:28] nice one there starting
[01:24:29] off then you're going to figure out
[01:24:32] what's going to happen along the way
[01:24:35] those are your characters you can be
[01:24:36] plus or minus I don't know it depends on
[01:24:39] what you get in your adventure through
[01:24:41] the
[01:24:44] Wasteland and you can tell me in each
[01:24:46] one of these boxes there's 78 red and
[01:24:48] green and then there's 12 blue where you
[01:24:51] would like me to pull from these for
[01:24:53] your plus or minus or I can do random to
[01:24:56] see what you get to the boss you're
[01:24:57] going to be a strong human all right a
[01:25:00] strong human goes wandering through the
[01:25:03] Wasteland and as they wander through the
[01:25:05] Wasteland they're looking for food
[01:25:07] because they need food to help them stay
[01:25:10] strong and big as you wander you look
[01:25:13] for food let's see what you get here
[01:25:15] third 12 13 and the last one has only 12
[01:25:18] cards in it one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
[01:25:26] you wander through the Wasteland this
[01:25:28] strong human they find something on the
[01:25:30] ground they pick it up and they go oh
[01:25:32] they bite it and they go oh my tooth
[01:25:34] that is not what I'm looking for I'm
[01:25:36] looking for food not a treasure and they
[01:25:39] lose one strength because they have lost
[01:25:42] they have bit their tooth they bit and
[01:25:44] cracked their tooth but I'm actually
[01:25:45] going to show you guys the animation in
[01:25:47] case you happen to get the food if you
[01:25:50] happen to get the food look at this our
[01:25:52] man opening a can
[01:25:54] here that would be a lucky one there but
[01:25:56] here you go we're GNA go with
[01:26:00] 13 and then you got to let me know where
[01:26:02] you want to go for that last
[01:26:06] 12 one two three four five 6 7 8 9 10 11
[01:26:11] 12 13 oh wow look at that literally
[01:26:14] pulled 13 of them out
[01:26:17] H 13 here we go you wander through the
[01:26:20] Wasteland and you stumble upon a copy
[01:26:23] and as a strong human a copy is
[01:26:28] something that you do not like you do
[01:26:33] not understand it it's this weird light
[01:26:36] shining thing oh my what is this and you
[01:26:40] drop that copy and you go Oh no you're
[01:26:43] now kind of blinded as you're wandering
[01:26:45] through the Wasteland here with one
[01:26:47] strength but you know what hopefully
[01:26:50] you'll find a friend
[01:26:52] in your companion let's see what happens
[01:26:55] maybe you'll find a friend now this is
[01:26:57] only the happy path I have for the
[01:26:59] animations so I'm going to show you the
[01:27:00] animation that happened if you found a
[01:27:03] friend at the end there if you found a
[01:27:05] companion this would have been if you
[01:27:07] found a
[01:27:08] friend if you find a friend wandering
[01:27:10] through the Wasteland now what one
[01:27:12] you're GNA do number eight I like it
[01:27:14] number
[01:27:16] eight that is our happy path right now
[01:27:19] I'm gonna get the other one going since
[01:27:20] people seem to like the animation 1 two
[01:27:23] 3 four five six seven and eight number
[01:27:26] eight as you wander through the
[01:27:28] Wasteland you see someone in the
[01:27:29] distance is it a friend maybe a foe
[01:27:33] let's see what it is oh
[01:27:36] no you see a fungus
[01:27:39] dinosaur no this fungus din comes along
[01:27:43] bites your leg runs away and you are now
[01:27:47] at only zero strength as you go through
[01:27:50] the Wasteland and oh no you're going to
[01:27:52] come up across the boss and what's going
[01:27:55] to happen with this boss you're going to
[01:27:56] probably get a big beat down but we will
[01:27:58] see you have 10 choices here where you
[01:28:01] want to go shuffling these up let's see
[01:28:03] what

[01:28:11] you wander through the Wasteland you
[01:28:13] bump into some creature in the distance
[01:28:16] and is it going to be a boss we don't
[01:28:18] know oh no it is a boss big bad boss so
[01:28:21] run comes by flicks you with his finger
[01:28:25] goes goodbye go back to that Vault pick
[01:28:28] something out maybe you'll find a card

[01:28:35] the vault when you pick it up in the way
[01:28:36] in the end in the Wasteland at the end

[03:42:38] to there's your characters can pick what
[03:42:40] you want for your characters I don't

[03:43:08] and
[03:43:10] four strength for your adventure through
[03:43:13] the
[03:43:14] Wasteland we're going to call that four
[03:43:16] strength for your adventure through the
[03:43:18] Wasteland if you want to get those four
[03:43:21] strength that
[03:43:23] is and we're going to put these
[03:43:25] on if you want
[03:43:30] it these are going to go on for
[03:43:37] this that's a really good deal for those
[03:43:40] Red Master I am doing a auction for our
[03:43:45] game that is based on Fallout I Was
[03:43:49] preparing in 2.5 we have animations with
[03:43:52] our game so one of the things you can
[03:43:54] get you pick your characters animations
[03:43:55] will come up depending on what you're
[03:43:57] doing maybe you're going to be one of
[03:43:58] those three four characters there you
[03:44:01] decide one of those characters and what
[03:44:02] happens is each one of the packs here
[03:44:05] are worth a plus minus strength or
[03:44:07] something these ones are going to get
[03:44:08] you four because this one is actually
[03:44:12] two it counts
[03:44:14] as but you can build your own character
[03:44:19] if you would like you don't need me to
[03:44:21] build this character strength for you
[03:44:22] you can do it yourself whenever you want
[03:44:25] I'm going to leave that one there I like
[03:44:26] that one we're going to try those ones
[03:44:27] again so with that being said I'm going
[03:44:30] to put one of these up I'm going to put
[03:44:33] two of these
[03:44:34] up so we're going to start your
[03:44:36] character off with one two
[03:44:40] 3 4 One Two Three strength for your
[03:44:43] adventure through the Wasteland as you
[03:44:45] can see there you can always choose them
[03:44:47] yourself and if you get multiple packs
[03:44:49] you do get a discount because multiple
[03:44:51] packs allows me to get a discount for uh
[03:44:53] whatnot fees I don't have to pay each
[03:44:57] one
[03:45:00] so this is our deal here for you guys if
[03:45:03] you want
[03:45:05] it here is our pack deal for these
[03:45:10] four
[03:45:12] packs and you get three strength in your
[03:45:14] adventure through the Wasteland here and
[03:45:17] you get to pick a character Champion
[03:45:20] xano maybe you're going to be a mutant
[03:45:24] and you're going to walk through our
[03:45:28] Wasteland maybe you're going to
[03:45:31] be a strong
[03:45:34] human going on a jaunt through the
[03:45:38] Wasteland May baby you're going to be a
[03:45:43] detective as you walk through the
[03:45:46] Wasteland oh did I
[03:45:49] freeze after you walk you play the game
[03:45:53] and you end up getting either one plus
[03:45:57] one or minus one on your strength for
[03:46:01] your
[03:46:03] characters now each one of these you get
[03:46:05] one plus one - one plus one - one or
[03:46:08] potentially plus one - one here here up
[03:46:10] to three plus ones or minus ones then
[03:46:12] you get up to the end where you battle
[03:46:14] the boss where you have Mary you could
[03:46:16] beat you could beat Owen or you could
[03:46:18] beat the Velociraptor um if you happen
[03:46:21] to get like multiple collector boosters
[03:46:23] of uh Commander Masters you could
[03:46:25] actually potentially beat five of them
[03:46:27] now what happens here is we Shuffle
[03:46:28] everything up you see what happens and
[03:46:30] maybe you come out on top whether you
[03:46:33] beat the boss and if the boss beats you
[03:46:35] you have to go back to the Vault and
[03:46:36] find what is there and that is our game
[03:46:39] that that we're playing so I'm going to
[03:46:41] put that back up for you guys in case

[05:13:04] are these it tells you what you get for
[05:13:06] your strength for your character so
[05:13:08] you're going to go wandering through the
[05:13:09] Wasteland here and as you wander through
[05:13:12] this Wasteland you're going to start off
[05:13:14] with your character with two strength as
[05:13:18] you wander through the Wasteland because
[05:13:19] that is one that is half each so that is
[05:13:22] two strength for your character you can
[05:13:25] always pick your own you don't need me

[05:13:59] character and as you wander through the
[05:14:00] Wasteland you're going to see if you
[05:14:02] want to be a technician mutant one of
[05:14:05] those
[05:14:06] above maybe your mutant goes wandering
[05:14:09] through the Wasteland for you who knows

[05:21:21] coming in hanging out we got some more
[05:21:23] games
[05:21:24] here I will do this right
[05:21:28] now we're going to put these on
[05:21:31] let's do this here let's do this
[05:21:37] here we're going to do this
[05:21:39] here I don't know fit what do you think
[05:21:43] one two three strength on your adventure
[05:21:47] through the
[05:21:50] Wasteland and we'll call that
[05:21:59] one and that one's going to go up there
[05:22:07] for this if you want it for those packs
[05:22:11] those five
[05:22:13] packs krippin this is our adventure game
[05:22:16] you know what I'm going to make this go
[05:22:18] a little longer so I can explain it to
[05:22:19] you all right here is our adventure game
[05:22:22] you have packs you pick each pack is
[05:22:25] points depending on strength you have
[05:22:27] one strength for that one half for each
[05:22:29] one so that's one here and then half for
[05:22:31] each one of those which is one strength
[05:22:32] there for your character what you do is
[05:22:34] you pick one of the four characters you
[05:22:37] would like to be in this Wasteland and
[05:22:39] as you travel through the Wasteland what
[05:22:42] happens is you pick up items or maybe
[05:22:44] you meet friends along the way which
[05:22:46] will give you either a plus or a minus
[05:22:49] one and then you get to the end where
[05:22:51] you fight the boss and if you are lucky
[05:22:53] enough to beat the boss the boss drops
[05:22:56] you some loot in a randomly dropped item
[05:23:00] or May maybe you're beat by the boss and
[05:23:02] you have to stumble back to the Vault
[05:23:03] where you find something there but this
[05:23:06] is just Plus or minuses and your boss at
[05:23:08] the end is one of the 10 cards you
[05:23:10] battle so like you could beat Mary
[05:23:13] Velociraptor Owen Grady if you went with
[05:23:16] these ones say somebody wanted to go
[05:23:18] with three of these which would actually
[05:23:19] get you six points to start with you
[05:23:22] could actually be
[05:23:26] incinerator and T-Rex which gives you
[05:23:29] potentially a 50/50 of coming out on top
[05:23:32] with your boss there and each one of
[05:23:34] these you pull them out and it's just
[05:23:36] dependent on your character plus one or
[05:23:37] minus one strength or
[05:23:42] not and that's what it is like there I
[05:23:45] was trying to explain that to you

[05:41:03] a mutant all right as a mutant when you
[05:41:07] go wandering through the
[05:41:11] Wasteland your mutant wanders through
[05:41:13] the Wasteland looking for food where

[05:41:32] do this I like to do this for random see
[05:41:33] which one comes up last that was the
[05:41:35] last one standing so this is a random
[05:41:38] one here as a mutant wandering through
[05:41:40] the Wasteland you hope to stumble across
[05:41:43] some food or oh no you find a treasure
[05:41:46] you pick that treasure up and you bite

[05:42:14] along the way qu the cripping you find a
[05:42:18] copy the copy is helpful for a mutant
[05:42:22] because a mutant doesn't really
[05:42:24] understand things they're kind of dumb
[05:42:25] they're a little bit slow so this mutant
[05:42:29] has a friend in the distance that says

[05:52:43] to help me a along the way here we go
[05:52:46] again here we go drop out that one down
[05:52:50] to one here we are cripping and you get
[05:52:54] oh look at that a power
[05:52:57] Stone a technician likes power Stones
[05:53:01] all right that helps them become
[05:53:04] stronger so now you've added that to
[05:53:07] some of your stuff and you are one two
[05:53:09] three strength as you wander through the
[05:53:11] Wasteland getting back up there in your
[05:53:13] strength yes that power Stone got rid of
[05:53:17] your rad poisoning and you are back to
[05:53:20] normal here we go here you're going to
[05:53:23] go now with

[05:53:29] a potential companion or a foe are we
[05:53:32] going to find a companion or a foe let's
[05:53:34] find out krippin we're going to do this
[05:53:36] again we're going to spread them out
[05:53:38] we're going to see if anyone sticks out
[05:53:40] for
[05:53:41] me nothing is sticking out really so
[05:53:44] we're going to go with we're going to go
[05:53:45] with a middest one we're going to go

[05:53:52] crippin hey Dandy how you doing thanks
[05:53:54] for coming in we're going to flip this
[05:53:56] over and as a nition a Thro there comes
[05:53:59] down and goes hey buddy I see you got a
[05:54:02] power Stone there you know if I use that
[05:54:04] we can help power up and we will be one
[05:54:06] two three four strength on your VAC on
[05:54:10] your trip through this Wasteland and so
[05:54:13] when you get up to that boss at the end
[05:54:15] maybe you can win so let's see what
[05:54:17] happens here Nick Nick
[05:54:19] Nick we're playing our game here we are
[05:54:21] at the end we have a potential of a win
[05:54:24] here with four strength for our buddy
[05:54:28] that decided to be a technician cripping
[05:54:31] wandering through the Wasteland you
[05:54:34] stumble onto that oh that's the wrong

[05:54:41] find finds an item to help
[05:54:44] you a friend comes along the way buzzing
[05:54:48] toward you as a thoter for the
[05:54:53] technician and that buzzing thoter is
[05:54:55] looking around going hm H I think you

[05:55:17] your thror throws him away but luckily
[05:55:21] allows you to
[05:55:22] escape just a little battered but you
[05:55:26] wander through the Wasteland find a

[06:37:46] in bozilla nice to see you be here for a
[06:37:50] little while longer until I get to go
[06:37:51] pick my boys up from the bus so uh if
[06:37:54] you want to hang out with us no problem
[06:37:57] no problems with that we like it we're
[06:37:59] having fun playing our
[06:38:01] games going through the Wasteland or
[06:38:04] ripping packs open for our buddies and
[06:38:05] hitting some nice cards for
[06:38:10] ghost all righty so with that being
[06:38:14] said we're going to do
[06:38:17] another adventure through the
[06:38:20] Wasteland you guys don't need you know
[06:38:22] what actually
[06:38:25] let's do this
[06:38:26] instead about the game all right so this
[06:38:30] game you pick three packs of cards you
[06:38:33] can see on there um generally I
[06:38:36] generally allow three packs all the way
[06:38:38] up to about three strength for your
[06:38:41] character um maybe you want more than
[06:38:43] three packs sometimes people go you know
[06:38:45] say give me a couple uh couple packs of
[06:38:48] like other things so like say they want
[06:38:49] a couple Dungeons and
[06:38:51] Dragons a couple wild drain in a
[06:38:56] commander Master set that would get them
[06:38:57] three strength as they travel through
[06:38:59] the Wasteland all
[06:39:01] right then what happens is I'm going to
[06:39:04] put this up there for anybody that might
[06:39:05] want it all
[06:39:10] right why did that W
[06:39:15] work all right one second there and it's
[06:39:17] going to go on
[06:39:19] now there you
[06:39:23] go
[06:39:24] there we are all right I'm going to
[06:39:26] explain it here a little bit for you put
[06:39:28] it on for a minute to explain this so
[06:39:31] you would get one two three strength for
[06:39:33] your character what would happen is is
[06:39:36] you would go through the Wasteland
[06:39:37] wander through the Wasteland deciding
[06:39:39] what character you want to be all right
[06:39:42] one of those characters are one of these
[06:39:44] characters here and as you wander
[06:39:45] through the Wasteland you pick items up
[06:39:47] that could help you maybe it's a
[06:39:49] treasure that could help you as a
[06:39:52] technician a detective wandering through
[06:39:54] the
[06:39:55] Wasteland maybe it's a treasure you pick
[06:39:59] up that'll help you maybe you find a
[06:40:02] mutant as a mutant friend and you find a
[06:40:05] mutant friend to help you wander through
[06:40:08] the Wasteland or maybe you find that
[06:40:10] dinosaur at the end that's going to help
[06:40:12] you in the final battle against the boss
[06:40:14] and now these are all plus or minus
[06:40:17] one strength for your character so at
[06:40:21] the end you would battle the boss and
[06:40:23] potentially win win a free set booster
[06:40:26] or collector booster depending on what
[06:40:28] the boss drops in the strength that you
[06:40:30] are at if not you always wander back to
[06:40:34] the Vault where you do pick something up
[06:40:37] that you find straggling in a
[06:40:40] vault and this is version 1.25 I mean
[06:40:44] 2.5 because version 3 will come out on
[06:40:47] release day of Dungeons and Dragons
[06:40:50] where we have a lot of fun because
[06:40:53] there's some extra stuff the vault is
[06:40:55] going to be different the vault is going
[06:40:57] to be different our animations are all
[06:40:59] going to be here and that's what's going
[06:41:01] to happen the quack and duck so that's
[06:41:04] our game yog moth Quest Riot those are
[06:41:08] the packs that you could have gotten
[06:41:09] with it if you went with those
[06:41:12] ones yeah my CH I I um I started this
[06:41:17] because my kids my oldest son wanted a
[06:41:19] rip
[06:41:20] pxs and I started having more fun with
[06:41:22] it doing than I was expecting
[06:41:25] and they keep coming up with ideas like
[06:41:27] one of the ideas they came up with was
[06:41:28] doing the
[06:41:30] animations I thought it was a little
[06:41:31] weird but I started I did a couple of
[06:41:34] them and people were like oh that's fun
[06:41:36] so you you know why not I'll keep doing
[06:41:37] them so like this here will get you one
[06:41:41] two three strength as you wander through
[06:41:43] the Wasteland you can choose your own
[06:41:45] character strength I don't need to but
[06:41:48] that here gets you three strength that's
[06:41:51] how you know it's why right there tells
[06:41:53] you how much each pack is
[06:41:55] individually before they get put
[06:41:57] together in any pack deal because I take
[06:41:59] a couple bucks off to help with um
[06:42:01] shipping and U because you pack purchase
[06:42:03] multiple at a time it saves me on
[06:42:05] whatnot fees so here this one's going to
[06:42:08] go on for this if you would like to try
[06:42:11] your luck on any of
[06:42:14] these all right I'm going to put that on
[06:42:17] for 30 seconds here we're going to put
[06:42:20] that away you can choose your character
[06:42:22] that'll be one two two three strength
[06:42:25] for your character as you wander through
[06:42:27] the
[06:42:28] Wasteland who knows what you're going to
[06:42:31] be are you going to be the lucky
[06:42:34] one that finds the
[06:42:37] technician that has a buzzing Thro or
[06:42:39] going around them I don't know let's
[06:42:43] find out and you guys can always tell me
[06:42:45] what you want for the packs I don't need
[06:42:47] to build it you can build it yourself so
[06:42:50] if you don't like what I keep showing
[06:42:51] out here you can build
[06:42:54] your character strength you don't need
[06:42:55] me to do

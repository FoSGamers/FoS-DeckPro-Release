[00:07:49] one let's throw out a different maybe
[00:07:51] you want some Thunder maybe you want
[00:07:53] some Thunder we'll start with thunder
[00:07:55] just do one Adventure game here
[00:08:00] no one was liking the other one to get
[00:08:01] in on so I'm going to cancel that
[00:08:03] one and I'm going to re I'm going to run
[00:08:05] uh I'm going to be done with that I'm
[00:08:07] going to create a new one we'll take our
[00:08:09] picture here with our Thunder Junction
[00:08:11] right
[00:08:13] there um well forgot her got to uh copy
[00:08:19] the
[00:08:26] name forgot to copy the name
[00:08:30] there we
[00:08:31] go create
[00:08:35] new
[00:08:37] screenshot copy the name paste the name
[00:08:41] category
[00:08:44] magic starting price why not bid
[00:08:48] increment why
[00:08:50] not we'll run that for five minutes see
[00:08:53] if anybody wants it and I'll even go
[00:08:54] lower if somebody wants to go quicker if
[00:08:56] somebody actually does want to jump on
[00:08:57] it right away but no one 's really been
[00:08:59] doing anything so that's why I figured
[00:09:01] uh throw different ones out there that's
[00:09:04] what we got for those and I'll try uh
[00:09:05] some other stuff here and see how it

[00:09:11] uh giveaway say none so I could start it
[00:09:14] at the end of the show and for some
[00:09:15] reason it went to 30 minutes so I'll
[00:09:18] just keep adjusting it every now and
[00:09:19] again I
[00:09:21] guess and then maybe if I'm maybe if I
[00:09:23] don't pay attention it'll start to run
[00:09:25] because I'll be busy which means a good
[00:09:27] thing right I'm busy and I'm not paying
[00:09:30] attention that means it's a good thing
[00:09:31] and it'll
[00:09:36] run maybe you all are uh interested in
[00:09:39] hanging out here trying some of the
[00:09:40] games now remember the games are
[00:09:42] animated too so when you go through them

[00:30:43] pretty cool
[00:30:47] there that's nice that's nice that it
[00:30:50] works better all right now we're going
[00:30:52] to do this um I thought I had that
[00:30:54] running there where was it mystery Ah
[00:30:58] that's why we're going to run our
[00:31:00] Mysteries we're going to do a flash sale
[00:31:02] we're going to discount them by
[00:31:05] this you know we're going to discount
[00:31:07] them by this actually we're going to do
[00:31:08] a flash sale on five of them for five
[00:31:13] minutes there we go five of them for
[00:31:16] five minutes on a little mystery bag
[00:31:18] flash
[00:31:19] sale then I'll throw out another one of
[00:31:21] the adventure games which is what we
[00:31:22] said we were going to do before was the
[00:31:24] Iaria collector booster so we're going
[00:31:28] to create a new one we're going to do a
[00:31:30] screenshot we're going to move that back
[00:31:31] here so you can see it screenshot there
[00:31:34] you
[00:31:36] go this is going to
[00:31:40] be paste pack and Wasteland
[00:31:43] Adventure magic we're going to do that
[00:31:45] all right Adam likes the idea of the
[00:31:47] game so maybe we will try it out there I
[00:31:49] think this was uh what was his price
[00:31:51] give me one second the price of these
[00:31:53] changed because I had to buy them and I
[00:31:55] think it actually lowered from the last
[00:31:57] time I got on there cuz I think I might
[00:31:58] have actually got them a little cheaper
[00:31:59] but I need to double check for you
[00:32:03] guys yes they were a little cheaper
[00:32:06] nice so I get to put them on a little
[00:32:08] cheaper for you
[00:32:10] all I didn't realize that there you go
[00:32:13] we'll throw that on there we'll throw it
[00:32:14] on why not five minutes again and
[00:32:16] they'll talk about some of the stuff
[00:32:17] that I was doing
[00:32:19] though so there you are that's if you
[00:32:21] want an ioria blister right there got
[00:32:24] some fun we'll play that Adventure game
[00:32:26] again yeah so what I was thinking people
[00:32:28] like semi Adventure game and they were
[00:32:30] liking the other one so I was thinking
[00:32:31] what I would end up doing was um I'll
[00:32:33] end up getting this go quicker if
[00:32:35] somebody wants it say somebody wants to
[00:32:36] jump in on this I'll run it in like 30
[00:32:38] seconds or 10 seconds if somebody does
[00:32:40] want the ioria but I want to give a
[00:32:41] little explanation I figur you guys
[00:32:43] would like it that um so the adventure
[00:32:45] game the way that we end up doing that
[00:32:46] is I would have like the whole game
[00:32:49] would be an entire the entire morning
[00:32:50] the hour and a half to two hours that
[00:32:52] I'm doing it in the morning would be the
[00:32:53] entire Adventure we start out like the
[00:32:55] first 10 20 minutes we would be building
[00:32:57] the characters whoever buys into buy
[00:32:59] stuff would help build the characters
[00:33:01] and we would have either two or three
[00:33:03] characters I was thinking two to start
[00:33:04] cuz you don't want to build too many
[00:33:05] characters so you'd have two characters
[00:33:07] like maybe a Mage and a uh like a tank
[00:33:10] and Warrior type thing like a mage R
[00:33:13] like a range person Mage and like a
[00:33:14] warrior tank type thing and then we
[00:33:16] would uh you'd help build those
[00:33:18] characters and then we would go through
[00:33:20] the adventure as those two
[00:33:22] characters um and um see what happens
[00:33:25] and if you guys like doing that maybe I
[00:33:27] do longer shows where I do what's a like
[00:33:29] a long show where it's a whole um you
[00:33:31] know like a three four hour one where I
[00:33:33] do type thing I don't maybe you guys
[00:33:35] like that some people like the dungeon
[00:33:36] dragons thing so I figured I'd try it
[00:33:38] out a little bit because people were
[00:33:39] liking the dungeon dragon uh theme that
[00:33:41] I have to my stories I guess I do a good
[00:33:43] story I was
[00:33:50] told so all right that's cool that the
[00:33:52] microphone's better on that that's
[00:33:54] awesome that the microphone's better on
[00:33:55] that that's really actually very sweet
[00:33:58] that the microphone's even better on
[00:34:00] that yeah it's less things to yeah less
[00:34:03] stuff to have to worry about carrying
[00:34:05] around anywhere all I need to do if I
[00:34:07] ever stream and do anything is the
[00:34:09] microphone on this is going to work for
[00:34:10] me yeah and you have the Muff I have the
[00:34:13] Muff also to put on for um for if
[00:34:15] there's bad you know wind and stuff yep
[00:34:18] yep exactly well I going to go change
[00:34:23] you're going to go change all right
[00:34:24] let's see let's do some of the other
[00:34:26] stuff here I'm going to go through some
[00:34:27] of the singles that I have guys and the
[00:34:29] way I like to do this is if you want any
[00:34:30] of the singles you just kind of like Say
[00:34:32] Hey I want those singles I'll put them
[00:34:33] off the side with your name on it and
[00:34:36] then I can tally them up at the end of
[00:34:37] the show and what I'll do is I'll have
[00:34:39] the kind of my adventure game running in
[00:34:40] the background as I go through these
[00:34:42] things um a lot of times people like
[00:34:44] when I do that I don't know if you guys

[00:40:47] it being there and it will run so that
[00:40:49] was actually the goal of the give away
[00:40:51] is that I was having so much fun hanging
[00:40:53] out with you guys that I forget it's
[00:40:55] there and it's going to run but if I
[00:40:57] know there's there and I have to bump it

[00:51:05] top see what I wanted to do actually my
[00:51:07] initial idea to start this is um we were
[00:51:09] doing a good job with all this and have
[00:51:11] a lot of fun and people were people I
[00:51:15] had more people joining and they liked
[00:51:16] everything that was going on and what I
[00:51:17] was trying to do was eventually I was
[00:51:20] going to um make it so that I could
[00:51:24] either like I could stream remotely and
[00:51:26] I would have a store and the person will
[00:51:28] you open the packs and I could be
[00:51:29] wherever I was ex streaming and
[00:51:34] stuff cuz I said ever before if you
[00:51:37] heard me before I was in here that was
[00:51:39] supposed to be on none because I was
[00:51:40] giving that away at the end of the show
[00:51:42] and it keeps for some reason it didn't
[00:51:44] let me it went to none and when um
[00:51:46] something happened when I came back in
[00:51:47] with the camera and reset it um so
[00:51:50] that's why I was supposed to be that way
[00:51:52] and I um that's why I did that
[00:51:58] yeah about random fun
[00:52:01] Adam yeah so you play casual a bunch of
[00:52:03] guys exactly so um that's why I done
[00:52:06] that um I was planning on doing it at
[00:52:08] the end of the show but for whatever
[00:52:10] reason it didn't let me it it went on
[00:52:12] and it started at 30 30 minutes randomly
[00:52:15] when I came in here at one point that's
[00:52:22] why um but anyways with the um let me do
[00:52:25] this here and I did I've said that
[00:52:27] multiple times here anywayss
[00:52:29] too I have said that multiple times here
[00:52:32] I don't know why I was like I consider
[00:52:34] that a glitch because it was something
[00:52:35] that I didn't do but let me um let me do
[00:52:39] this
[00:52:39] here for you guys so that you have an
[00:52:43] understanding of I'll put this up so you
[00:52:44] can see what the um if you want to do
[00:52:46] the adventure game you can understand
[00:52:48] kind of what it helps with and what you
[00:52:49] get for strength and everything this is
[00:52:52] a this will be a oh no that's not it
[00:52:57] 0
[00:52:58] five all right let's do that I'm going
[00:53:00] to do a screenshot of this
[00:53:04] here give me one second I know I can't

[00:53:08] quickly so that you all can see what
[00:53:11] they have for packs and stuff nice and
[00:53:14] easily because I had done this before
[00:53:17] but for some reason it didn't come
[00:53:23] back where's my chat
[00:53:28] yeah I know some things are weird like I
[00:53:29] went right into it and I like I normally
[00:53:31] hit none and I'll run it like at the end
[00:53:33] of the I'll run it at the end and for
[00:53:35] some reason it went in and did 30 right
[00:53:37] away I'm like what the hell is going
[00:53:39] on like it was just an odd thing an odd
[00:53:42] like you said an odd situation so let me

[00:53:48] snipping

[00:55:35] [ __ ]
[00:55:38] cancel didn't It Go in give me one
[00:55:41] second I'm being silly I know I'm not
[00:55:44] ignoring you on purpose I'm trying to
[00:55:45] make this
[00:55:47] better trying to make it easier for you
[00:55:49] all actually is what I'm trying to
[00:55:52] do browse why is that showing
[00:55:56] desktop
[00:56:02] screenshot
[00:56:04] open there you go that way you can see
[00:56:07] what we have for packs available if you
[00:56:10] want anything and let me do this to do a
[00:56:13] quick thing here because this is
[00:56:14] supposed to be on
[00:56:18] here I'm going I do this
[00:56:27] there we go for that so you can see them
[00:56:31] or not if you want a question on them ah
[00:56:33] trying to make it easier for you guys to
[00:56:35] see everything that we have that's what
[00:56:38] I was trying to do there hopefully that
[00:56:40] worked a little bit I don't know if it
[00:56:47] did drip is kind of a new app for me
[00:56:50] drip is a new app for me uh it's not a
[00:56:53] newer app it's been around for a little
[00:56:55] while but it's newer one for me to be
[00:56:57] using sometimes I've had some glitches
[00:56:59] like even my like for instance my
[00:57:01] microphone um for will switch randomly
[00:57:04] and I'll go to be silent so like things
[00:57:06] like that happen so it is a little bit
[00:57:08] newer um so there are some weird things
[00:57:11] that occur I can't always help it but
[00:57:14] hey what can you do what can you do I
[00:57:17] just do my best to have some
[00:57:19] fun all right let me do this here I'm
[00:57:21] going to push all that back I'm actually
[00:57:24] going to move these out of the way cuz
[00:57:25] the adventure game kind of takes up a
[00:57:26] little bit of space so I like to do this
[00:57:28] and move it over here a little bit out
[00:57:30] of the way that way I have a whole back
[00:57:34] area open here so you can see a little
[00:57:36] bit farther I do like to move that one a
[00:57:39] little bit over there too cuz that was
[00:57:41] our different game which I actually
[00:57:42] forgot to put out I have another game I
[00:57:45] have so many games I forget to put them
[00:57:47] out there was one that one was the
[00:57:48] outlaw game that my son had come up with
[00:57:51] it's kind of like a pack break but I
[00:57:52] hadn't had the animations done yet so
[00:57:55] that's what it is this is our give away
[00:57:56] one I'm just putting that right there so
[00:57:57] everybody sees that off to the side
[00:58:00] actually you know what I'm going to put
[00:58:01] that way back there that's that way it's
[00:58:03] just way way back there you can still
[00:58:04] see that it's just way way way back
[00:58:06] there then you can see the other stuff
[00:58:08] that I have a little bit
[00:58:11] easier then I can put those two up here
[00:58:13] create a new
[00:58:15] auction yeah drip isn't necessarily a
[00:58:18] new app but it's a newer one for me to
[00:58:19] be using and I think that's what it
[00:58:22] is I just maybe I got to get used to it
[00:58:24] could have been me doing something wrong
[00:58:25] too or it could have been a glitch
[00:58:27] because I know I set it to none and
[00:58:28] whenever I set it to none it doesn't
[00:58:30] take none either so that's the other
[00:58:32] thing too you're supposed to be able to
[00:58:33] set it um but it doesn't for some
[00:58:48] reason all right hold on I got to put
[00:58:50] this in
[00:58:52] here all right cancel that cancel that
[00:58:56] going to go back
[00:58:58] here go over here there we
[00:59:02] go

[01:06:16] the bosses in the Wasteland here so you
[01:06:19] go wandering and you're going that was
[01:06:20] really confusing I got a headache now
[01:06:22] only at three strength and you see in
[01:06:24] the distance a vault you know I'm going
[01:06:26] to go over that Vault over there and in
[01:06:27] there you're going to see that little
[01:06:29] gold pack there you're always going to
[01:06:30] get one of those so decide if you want
[01:06:31] to I'll get a random one for you like it
[01:06:33] did before but as you go wandering
[01:06:35] through you see right before you get to

[01:06:46] his mighty ring finger flicks you away
[01:06:49] but luckily doesn't kill you you bounce
[01:06:53] off the vault door door and when you
[01:06:57] bounce off that vault door miraculously
[01:06:59] opens you wander in and you see a safe
[01:07:04] and in that safe you see these gold a
[01:07:07] gold envelope you're like what is this
[01:07:09] gold
[01:07:10] Benji pull that out this Vault pack and
[01:07:13] you go what is this thing here what did
[01:07:16] this person feel they needed to save for
[01:07:17] all eternity and they put it in this
[01:07:19] weird gold envelope
[01:07:23] too gav thank you Gava I appreciate it
[01:07:27] and in this envelope you go under and in
[01:07:29] you got a headache you're going what is
[01:07:30] going on here you got this weird
[01:07:32] headache you feel like you're a little
[01:07:34] radiated from being flicked around by
[01:07:36] this big Sauron character and you look
[01:07:38] at this pack of cards and you say what
[01:07:40] is this thing from
[01:07:42] 1990
[01:07:43] 1989 what is this thing from 1989 that
[01:07:46] someone felt they needed to save in a
[01:07:48] vault when the world coming to an end
[01:07:52] you got some New Kids on the Block
[01:07:57] photo sticker and there's one sticker in
[01:08:00] there oh my you're getting New Kids on
[01:08:01] the Block
[01:08:03] sticker but that's so what the Vault
[01:08:06] packs are everybody that's ever heard me
[01:08:08] talk about them they're literally just
[01:08:10] packs of cards from anywhere from like I
[01:08:11] think 88 to
[01:08:14] 2012 TV shows movies
[01:08:18] people animations
[01:08:21] stickers comics comics comic books this
[01:08:25] some baseball cards but they're all
[01:08:27] packs of cards that were under a dollar
[01:08:29] that I found that it was just a little
[01:08:31] say thank you for playing the
[01:08:33] games that's all it is a little thank
[01:08:35] you for playing the game something that
[01:08:36] somebody thought was they needed to save
[01:08:39] so we're going to rip open all this and

[01:32:51] joins how long have I been playing I
[01:32:53] I've been playing I played magic when I
[01:32:55] was um I played magic in
[01:32:58] 1995 here you know what screw it let's
[01:33:00] get some fun things
[01:33:03] out what me yep F I'm not doing anything
[01:33:08] selling anything necessarily so let's
[01:33:09] have some fun F I don't
[01:33:12] care
[01:33:14] so this if you can see it is my box of
[01:33:17] magic cards from
[01:33:20] 1995 quite old you can see it's a little
[01:33:22] bit Stained on the top there it's been
[01:33:24] around for uh from 1995 I drew this when
[01:33:28] I was a 8-year-old no a 11-year-old
[01:33:32] child all right these are my cards from
[01:33:35] back
[01:33:37] then now you see all the products and
[01:33:39] things that are being giv away right now
[01:33:40] so we'll open some of this up here but
[01:33:42] like I have this is literally my Decks
[01:33:45] that I played with when I was younger
[01:33:47] all right these are not good decks cuz I
[01:33:49] was poor I did not have money I was a
[01:33:53] poor child so I ended up having to just
[01:33:56] do what I uh I had to you know make do
[01:33:57] with what I
[01:33:59] had uh so but luckily I you know grown
[01:34:01] doing a little bit better in our life
[01:34:02] now but here like this is what I used to
[01:34:05] this is a deck that I played with when I
[01:34:07] was younger and this was obviously with
[01:34:09] the 60 cards because we don't do more
[01:34:10] than 60 cards back then it was only 60
[01:34:13] cards then but I ended up putting them
[01:34:15] all in sleeves when I found them my kids
[01:34:17] like oh that's awesome so I took them
[01:34:19] all and I put them all on sleeves to
[01:34:21] protect them but like look this is the
[01:34:22] deck that I played with back in
[01:34:24] 1995 this is my green and uh Blue Deck I
[01:34:28] had I know it's a weird combination but
[01:34:30] it worked against a couple of the people
[01:34:32] that I played with so that's what I mean
[01:34:34] like I don't have like my some of these
[01:34:37] cards as you can see they're in pretty
[01:34:38] decent condition I took care of them
[01:34:40] even though we did shuffle them and
[01:34:41] everything I took really good care of
[01:34:43] all my
[01:34:45] cards but like yeah get some decent
[01:34:48] stuff in here I don't have anything over
[01:34:50] the top expensive just because I didn't
[01:34:52] have like I said I didn't have a lot of
[01:34:54] money so what I had was like very basic
[01:34:58] cheap cards I could get a lot of
[01:35:00] homelands which is actually why I have
[01:35:01] homelands and um here was CU it was one
[01:35:04] of the first t packs that I remember
[01:35:07] buying at the store to try to upgrade
[01:35:09] decks when I was younger cuz that was a
[01:35:11] cheap Pack and I only had a couple
[01:35:13] dollars all the
[01:35:16] time dude I did yeah you can see like
[01:35:18] look at how they like look at this card
[01:35:20] this is a forest card that I use all the
[01:35:22] time
[01:35:25] 1995 look at that card I could have
[01:35:28] pulled that out of a pack
[01:35:30] today I played with this
[01:35:33] card I literally played with this card
[01:35:36] on a regular basis look at
[01:35:39] that that could have been pulled out of
[01:35:41] a pack today they didn't have sleeves on
[01:35:44] them when I was a kid
[01:35:46] either because we didn't have those type
[01:35:48] of things I didn't have the money and I
[01:35:50] didn't buy
[01:35:51] them but I mean you can see some of my
[01:35:53] cards do have some dings on them do
[01:35:55] those ones were generally the ones that
[01:35:56] I traded for too so like I remember I
[01:35:59] had a trade for a woolly mammoth and I
[01:36:00] had some marks on it so like that's not
[01:36:02] my card that's somebody
[01:36:04] else's but yeah I took pretty good care
[01:36:06] of all my
[01:36:10] stuff love the illusionary wall that was
[01:36:13] one that was my favorite ones to play
[01:36:15] hard one to get out
[01:36:18] though seating charm that was always a
[01:36:21] good one too there little brainstorm see
[01:36:25] as you can see the cards even the ones
[01:36:26] being played every I played these three
[01:36:29] times a week with my friends and you can
[01:36:31] see they were never look at how how good
[01:36:33] condition they are yeah I did care about
[01:36:35] them thank you definitely did I care I
[01:36:37] was
[01:36:39] um long story short my family started
[01:36:42] out we were homeless at one point in my
[01:36:44] life I actually have pictures of me
[01:36:46] swinging in a tree in front of our um
[01:36:48] trailer which was one of the first
[01:36:50] houses that houses I remember living in
[01:36:53] so with that being said whenever I did
[01:36:55] get a chance to get something you had to
[01:36:58] take care of it because you weren't
[01:37:00] going to get something again you were
[01:37:01] lucky to get that one thing at all in
[01:37:03] the first place so you you took care of
[01:37:06] it you made sure I mean look this is the
[01:37:09] literally the Box this is the original
[01:37:12] box from
[01:37:14] 1995 that I use to keep everything in
[01:37:18] and you can even see look at the
[01:37:19] packaging the wrapper is still on it
[01:37:23] I'm sorry got a little Sidetrack on some
[01:37:25] reminiscing
[01:37:27] there I probably lost a bunch of people
[01:37:29] because of that but that's
[01:37:33] okay even though I'm trying to sell
[01:37:35] stuff I am just trying to have some fun
[01:37:39] because life does suck and you might as
[01:37:41] well try to have some fun as much you
[01:37:42] can but anyways those are some of my
[01:37:46] cards I got a whole box of them here
[01:37:48] from back when I was a kid some fun
[01:37:51] things going back in time a little bit
[01:37:52] there
[01:37:57] there you go no one wanted to do the
[01:38:00] adventure game with uh with these ones
[01:38:01] so I'll put that
[01:38:03] back maybe we'll uh maybe we'll do an
[01:38:05] adventure with something different let's
[01:38:08] grab

[01:38:29] start that here you go see if you guys
[01:38:33] want any of that now if you do like
[01:38:36] these things I can actually make them go
[01:38:37] a little quicker too we can change them
[01:38:39] around quicker you don't need to have
[01:38:41] them go like this but uh yeah thank you
[01:38:43] I appreciate you coming in and hanging
[01:38:44] out
[01:38:48] Gustavo yes they are Treasures of some
[01:38:51] kind that I do have there that is true
[01:38:53] true that is true for those of you that
[01:38:55] do come in I'm going to put this up
[01:38:56] there and actually make that smaller so
[01:38:58] it's not taking over the
[01:39:05] screen what is this other thing
[01:39:08] characters no go away
[01:39:12] characters we going to do that we're
[01:39:13] going to shrink that down a little bit
[01:39:15] I'll put it right here that way you can
[01:39:16] see it what we have for packs available
[01:39:20] if you want to do the Wasteland
[01:39:21] Adventure yourself and I think that is
[01:39:23] is everything I have flood borne
[01:39:26] inlands oh I have inkland boosters in
[01:39:28] there twice oh ioria boosters AFR set I
[01:39:32] do LCI draft I have W draft LCI set stre
[01:39:37] oh I have um some wow set too I need to
[01:39:40] put in
[01:39:41] there collector boosters
[01:39:45] here we have
[01:39:49] those EMA pip HML
[01:39:54] Homeland have those have those have
[01:39:56] those have those have those have those
[01:39:59] so I think I am here correct the only
[01:40:00] thing I need to add is Wilds ofv drain
[01:40:03] set I need Wilds ofv drain set to add in
[01:40:14] here yes exactly see like no that cards
[01:40:18] those cards aren't necessarily worth
[01:40:19] anything for me they're not worth a lot
[01:40:21] for anyone I'll put put it here here's
[01:40:24] an example of how I treat
[01:40:27] everything okay these are junk cards
[01:40:31] that are not worth anything much more
[01:40:33] than 10
[01:40:35] cents some of them maybe 5 cents some of
[01:40:38] them even less every single one of them
[01:40:42] I put in a sleeve
[01:40:43] here it's because I feel they should be
[01:40:47] protected and it's a penny or less for
[01:40:50] the box of sleeves and what happens is I
[01:40:52] will send I'll even sometimes these are
[01:40:54] given away like on the other shows that
[01:40:55] I do I'll do these as giveaways
[01:40:57] sometimes and like I'll give them away
[01:40:59] and say thank you and like the kids will
[01:41:00] sign a card or something like that like
[01:41:03] on the other shows that I do these are
[01:41:05] the giveaways that we do we do like one
[01:41:07] of the children will sign a card or I
[01:41:09] will sign a card a card that you can use
[01:41:11] and play with and then we do like
[01:41:12] another extra one with it like maybe
[01:41:14] it's a you know a foil or a special card
[01:41:17] of some kind we add those in our those
[01:41:19] are some of our giveaway things that we
[01:41:21] do
[01:41:25] but anyways everything works a lot
[01:41:27] better here by the way other than like
[01:41:29] some weird random glitches it works
[01:41:32] actually a lot better on this station it
[01:41:33] seems Seth what everything works
[01:41:36] technically a lot better yeah wow it's
[01:41:40] because it's scared for everybody not
[01:41:41] the select few yeah well I'm trying to
[01:41:44] get uh oh did you add an address and
[01:41:46] were you able to do what I said um I
[01:41:47] screenshot it again no still wouldn't go
[01:41:51] through I even changed my uh my display
[01:41:54] name and everything yeah you need to
[01:41:55] change what I need what somebody needs
[01:41:57] to do is create a thing without a new
[01:41:59] device so like one of the kids tablets
[01:42:01] mhm set it up with your mom sing and see
[01:42:03] what happens if they're blocking it out
[01:42:05] that way see what they're doing and then
[01:42:07] maybe even put on the um the
[01:42:10] uh the bpn and see what they're doing
[01:42:13] cuz that's very suspicious what they're
[01:42:14] doing yeah very very suspicious what
[01:42:16] they're doing else but not them correct
[01:42:18] there's certain people they can't be
[01:42:19] reported mhm they're not allowing to be
[01:42:21] reported which is really really illegal
[01:42:23] I'm pretty sure good

[01:56:42] some of the classic every now and again
[01:56:44] but generally it's Commander at the
[01:56:45] place that we play um because no one

[02:00:11] like
[02:00:12] super more
[02:00:14] common start

[02:06:32] we go screenshot
[02:06:35] that here we
[02:06:37] go put the big blue book in there I
[02:06:39] forgot about that there's only um I
[02:06:41] think there's only 30 something I have
[02:06:43] to check that out to
[02:06:45] count big big blue
[02:06:50] book or in parentheses
[02:06:53] BBB what's inside the folder I'll show
[02:06:57] you I'll show you one second right
[02:07:08] here I think there's I think there's 50
[02:07:12] left I'm not sure I'm going to stay
[02:07:13] somewhere around there I'll double check
[02:07:16] though all
[02:07:18] right where is it
[02:07:22] run flash there we go there you go flash
[02:07:28] inventory we'll call it
[02:07:31] 20 we'll call it a dollar off and I'll
[02:07:34] show it for a minute two minutes here so
[02:07:36] you guys can see it all right so what is
[02:07:38] in this no one wanted those so I'll put
[02:07:41] those
[02:07:43] back but I'll show you what is in um the
[02:07:46] book all right so the book here
[02:07:51] has some cool stuff in
[02:07:53] it this is a game where you pull out of
[02:07:55] your Bo out of the box something a
[02:07:57] number and on the number is going to be
[02:07:58] one of the cards one of these here and
[02:08:01] you're going to get the card on it all
[02:08:03] right so for instance you pull out
[02:08:07] number 24 you're going to get a
[02:08:09] wasteland it's hard for me to show these
[02:08:10] all like
[02:08:12] that you pull out number 22 you're going
[02:08:15] to get a
[02:08:17] uh bag end with a two
[02:08:21] of the mystery boosters so like that's
[02:08:24] what I mean like or the ceiling in here
[02:08:26] is still here which is a balin's tomb is
[02:08:29] a ceiling there's also still a temple
[02:08:33] Garden that's in there a foil Temple
[02:08:36] garden and a bunch of other cards that
[02:08:38] are nice in here for you to get and if
[02:08:40] you get some of them even like say you
[02:08:42] get like a ravenous T-Rex here you're
[02:08:44] going to get a collect uh play um you're
[02:08:47] going to get yourself
[02:08:50] a uh m booster with it also so this is
[02:08:53] what I mean like this is a good deal on
[02:08:55] all these you going to get a Homeland
[02:08:57] with a Serge foil pit boy that's
[02:08:58] probably screwing me right there that's
[02:09:01] what I mean there good deals on those on
[02:09:03] that Big Blue Book and I'm going to put
[02:09:06] in the description I'm going to add the
[02:09:07] description on that so you guys can see
[02:09:09] it better I'm going to give you a better
[02:09:10] description there because I have that in
[02:09:16] there but that's what the big blue book
[02:09:18] is right there
[02:09:22] yes some good stuff in that and then
[02:09:24] what happens is the way we do that is we
[02:09:25] shake this up and I would pull out a
[02:09:28] number this is our this is our container
[02:09:30] I shake this up we pull out a number you
[02:09:33] keep what's in here as the POG so I say
[02:09:34] I pull it out and you get this here all
[02:09:37] right like oh sweet this is the POG you
[02:09:39] got on the back you got number 80 well
[02:09:42] that's the one you would have gotten so
[02:09:44] that's how it would go there and you
[02:09:45] would pull out number 80 from the Big
[02:09:47] Blue Book and that's the card or the
[02:09:49] spot you would get
[02:09:59] yeah all the numbers are written in here
[02:10:02] that are in the book so there you
[02:10:05] go that's the uh that's that one there

[02:13:10] pre-release let
[02:13:13] me minus
[02:13:15] that that there
[02:13:22] put that
[02:13:29] there I pay 200 re for all right I can
[02:13:33] check oh you going to check the
[02:13:34] conversion thank you thank you I was
[02:13:36] about I was like I'm check the
[02:13:37] conversion there you know what hey that
[02:13:40] was
[02:13:42] um $3.50 more than I paid so it wasn't
[02:13:46] that big of a difference actually
[02:13:49] Gustavo so for pre-release said that
[02:13:51] actually isn't that big of a difference
[02:13:52] for it for you down
[02:14:02] there interesting because I thought
[02:14:04] about um like when I travel picking up
[02:14:07] packs around the world because all right
[02:14:08] so my um plan that my family and I are
[02:14:11] going to be doing here um the end of
[02:14:14] when my my son has his birthday uh in
[02:14:16] July after his birthday we're going to
[02:14:18] be on a boat traveling around the world

[02:14:22] we'll be in the Bahamas for a little
[02:14:23] while learn it learn the boat a little
[02:14:25] bit more I've been on a boat my entire
[02:14:26] life my father was a fisherman so I was
[02:14:29] always on a boat doing stuff so that's
[02:14:31] what I've always wanted to
[02:14:44] do yeah yeah I get what you get I
[02:14:46] completely understand that yes yes you
[02:14:49] get 100 1,000 real a month 200 200 is
[02:14:51] definitely very expensive I definitely
[02:14:53] get that like price-wise it is the same
[02:14:56] but conversion wise for you yes it is a
[02:14:58] big
[02:15:00] difference so it's like similar price
[02:15:03] but it's just a big difference on like
[02:15:04] cost on things I understand that yeah I
[02:15:08] um I've been looking we've been looking

[02:15:18] the stuff going on some headaches going
[02:15:20] on over there you don't want to deal
[02:15:21] with it if that makes
[02:15:24] sense not at the moment give it some

[02:15:45] able to get it pretty close to the same
[02:15:46] price it's either $6 to $7 sometimes you
[02:15:49] might be able to see them a little bit
[02:15:50] cheaper somewhere about generally $6 or

[02:17:19] of time there we go wow
[02:17:22] I'll tell you right now the these will
[02:17:23] end up going away yeah that you know
[02:17:25] what that would be nice I I actually do
[02:17:27] I've always what what those will go away
[02:17:29] for when this house start when we're
[02:17:30] selling it not necessarily we can leave
[02:17:32] it there and they can see it that's used
[02:17:33] this way yeah that's fine no I mean like
[02:17:35] we'll take them or throw them out yeah I
[02:17:37] get what you're saying yeah that' be
[02:17:38] nice I I actually have always wanted
[02:17:40] that's one of the few things I wanted to
[02:17:41] do like I've actually tried to go on my
[02:17:44] own little trips and do some things and
[02:17:46] I've thought about doing myself before
[02:17:47] but uh this will be better to do it with
[02:17:50] the family if we actually if it actually
[02:17:54] happens we actually end up leaving on
[02:17:56] the date that we did the date of yeah
[02:17:58] well we got to get a couple things major
[02:18:00] things in order major things in order
[02:18:01] can be done in that time
[02:18:03] frame house house can be done you have
[02:18:06] to sell it house will be sold in a month
[02:18:08] or less if we want it to yeah well
[02:18:11] that's price will be the dictator price
[02:18:13] is going to be the dictator of some of
[02:18:14] the things how fast then that determines
[02:18:17] the boat yeah What boat we can get so
[02:18:19] that's why I was saying we need to get
[02:18:20] on the market so we have a better idea
[02:18:22] of what we'll be able to get get towards
[02:18:24] it I know we need to dedicate some time
[02:18:27] you're going to be doing some morning
[02:18:28] shows and our evenings are dedicated to
[02:18:31] well I have to do some evenings too here
[02:18:33] to get rid of stuff to do them to do the
[02:18:35] other things you know Tuesdays and
[02:18:37] Thursdays are great days to do evenings
[02:18:38] I'm not
[02:18:40] home for one more yes I know everybody
[02:18:42] knows it's either Spanish or Portuguese
[02:18:44] I do have to realize so one of the
[02:18:45] things that we're going to do when we
[02:18:46] start traveling is I was thinking of
[02:18:48] doing like there's an app called Babel
[02:18:50] to kind of learn a little bit to learn
[02:18:52] some language of
[02:18:55] everyone hey that's okay if uh I need to
[02:18:58] repeat anything don't ever don't haveit
[02:19:00] say to ask all right
[02:19:05] bud it's pretty cool though what just
[02:19:09] that it's cool that I can talk to people
[02:19:11] around the world yeah the platforms are
[02:19:14] out there like that that that can do
[02:19:15] this you know yeah because I I've talked
[02:19:17] to a guy from South Africa and he told
[02:19:18] me when next time when we going around
[02:19:19] on our boat to stop by and talk to him
[02:19:22] his family does sailing and he would
[02:19:24] they would love to hang out with us and
[02:19:25] talk to us just because I was doing this
[02:19:27] stuff on here and doing D and things and
[02:19:29] playing Magic and I was like that's
[02:19:31] awesome that's cool that's that's like
[02:19:33] years down the road though I know that's
[02:19:34] years down the road but I even told him
[02:19:36] that's going to be for lot for 5 to 10
[02:19:37] years dude he's like that doesn't matter
[02:19:39] come and hang out but my point is like
[02:19:41] that's the people I know that that you
[02:19:43] can meet there's some good people Babel
[02:19:46] yeah I think it's uh Babel correct it's
[02:19:48] Babel that's the one I was looking at to
[02:19:50] try they don't teach you words they
[02:19:51] teach you phrases yeah they teach you
[02:19:52] phrases not necessary words that's what
[02:19:54] it is they teach you the language so
[02:19:55] it's like if you're a living places
[02:19:57] you're B out to pick it up FAS yeah yeah
[02:20:00] hey loser kid how you doing today thanks
[02:20:02] coming and hanging
[02:20:05] out just uh we're doing some of our
[02:20:07] games here Matthew these are the ones up
[02:20:09] right now if you want them um they are
[02:20:12] modern Horizon and remastered and then
[02:20:14] you get to play a little Adventure game
[02:20:15] where you are a you pick a character
[02:20:17] which is huge right now so everybody can
[02:20:19] see it but then once you pick your
[02:20:21] character you go on a little Adventure
[02:20:22] in the Wasteland all right you wander
[02:20:25] through the Wasteland as a character and
[02:20:27] we see what happens maybe you get
[02:20:30] lucky where you beat the boss and you
[02:20:33] come out with a uh when you come out
[02:20:36] with a win in your own pack of cards
[02:20:40] because if you happen to beat the boss
[02:20:41] what happens here is we shuffle through
[02:20:44] these here and if you happen to and you
[02:20:46] pull out something out of them so we'll
[02:20:48] shuffle through these and like oh you're
[02:20:49] going to get a free pack because you
[02:20:51] beat the boss and on this is you get a
[02:20:53] lost C Exon set because you beat the
[02:20:54] boss and that's how our adventure games
[02:20:57] go now if you don't beat the boss that's
[02:20:59] okay the boss ends up flicking you and
[02:21:01] throwing you towards a vault where in
[02:21:03] that Vault you get a vault pack which is
[02:21:05] this thing here just a little thank you

[02:44:49] that whatnot in their pocket which is
[02:44:51] why they use a lie to suspend
[02:44:55] me sorry for saying that on here I
[02:44:57] probably going to get in
[02:44:59] trouble but I'm not going to do that
[02:45:01] anymore because I'm tired of that crap
[02:45:04] so I don't want to deal with it anymore
[02:45:06] so we're going to do an adventure
[02:45:08] game and this is what our adventure game
[02:45:10] is going to be run as all
[02:45:12] right we're going to run an adventure
[02:45:15] game instead we're going to have some
[02:45:17] fun right now and say who cares about
[02:45:20] those
[02:45:23] putes we're going to try to have some
[02:45:25] fun as much fun as we can while we hang
[02:45:27] out with you
[02:45:32] all little Adventure game this is going
[02:45:35] to get you only one strength to start
[02:45:36] the adventure but here you could
[02:45:38] actually
[02:45:39] win
[02:45:41] yourself a pack of cards at the end
[02:45:57] no problem yeah take care of
[02:46:08] it yeah I can't do anything about it
[02:46:10] because I I'm literally have no access
[02:46:12] to anything I try to go and log in and
[02:46:14] it tells me um there's no account so
[02:46:19] I don't even know what they did I'm
[02:46:20] somebody out lied about something which
[02:46:22] is unbelievable they lied about what is
[02:46:25] visible right there at all
[02:46:28] times every single YouTube that is saved
[02:46:31] that I stream to is saved and they're
[02:46:33] all there visible so I don't know what
[02:46:37] happened I'm really I was thoroughly
[02:46:39] thoroughly confused on that one that was
[02:46:42] one of those like how how did that
[02:46:46] occur I don't know weird
[02:46:49] well what can you do
[02:46:52] right what can you do but I plan on
[02:46:56] we'll be doing that uh the the Exxon
[02:46:57] booster kind of the end of the show here
[02:46:59] whenever that ends up being I don't know
[02:47:01] when we'll do that at the end of the
[02:47:02] show but yeah we got um it's I do like
[02:47:06] the setup here a little bit better you
[02:47:08] can see the screen better where you can
[02:47:09] turn it to the side with your phone and
[02:47:10] everything I don't know how it looks for
[02:47:12] you guys if it looks good or not but I
[02:47:14] thought it looked pretty good here the
[02:47:15] way that we were doing it at least for
[02:47:18] me it seemed like it looked
[02:47:24] nice there's birds outside
[02:47:27] squeaking lot of birds
[02:47:35] walking come stand over
[02:47:41] here
[02:47:43] nope I have a bunch of
[02:47:46] ioria I have a whole case of vioria for
[02:47:50] those that may be interested got that in
[02:47:55] recently so let's
[02:47:58] see what you all looking for today we're
[02:48:00] having some fun we're trying to at least
[02:48:03] bird coming from in here yep out right
[02:48:06] there out my door it sounded like they
[02:48:07] were literally at the window sarking at
[02:48:09] just said that they were the window open
[02:48:11] the window it doesn't matter if the
[02:48:12] windows open no there were definitely
[02:48:13] Birds right here 100% right here going
[02:48:17] off heard them right there
[02:48:19] where are they he's right there in the
[02:48:21] bush oh yeah I see him that's a bird I
[02:48:23] see him that's the
[02:48:24] birds sorry we're now bird
[02:48:28] watchers so my family are um after what
[02:48:32] happened on that and realizing that
[02:48:34] Liars can ruin a small business that's
[02:48:37] trying to do well I decided I'm not
[02:48:40] going to put that effort into that
[02:48:41] aspect again I'm going to put more
[02:48:42] effort into doing the D and D types
[02:48:44] thing where I like the dungeon master
[02:48:46] and doing some games and having fun with
[02:48:48] you all so what I'm going to plan on
[02:48:49] doing is I will have when I'm traveling
[02:48:53] around the world on our boat I'll still
[02:48:55] do some shows but it won't be as
[02:48:57] frequent because we're going to be doing
[02:48:59] our own different other YouTube things
[02:49:00] that we're going to try um but I'll
[02:49:02] still do some of these but the way that
[02:49:04] I'll end up doing these ones is I'm
[02:49:07] going to end up having it so that
[02:49:09] um there a straight out Adventure like a
[02:49:13] like an actual adventure and you go
[02:49:15] along we're going to build a character
[02:49:17] in the beginning of the adventure based
[02:49:18] on what you buy and stuff like that
[02:49:20] we're going to also go and then that
[02:49:22] Adventure we're going to finish that
[02:49:23] adventure to the end hopefully in the
[02:49:25] time frame that I say maybe I'll be on
[02:49:26] for an hour or two and that's that'll be
[02:49:29] my plan for what we do and I think I'm
[02:49:31] going to start that this week coming up
[02:49:32] this week on hopefully you know this
[02:49:34] week Tuesday Wednesday or something like
[02:49:35] that I can get that going because it'll
[02:49:37] take me a little bit of time to figure
[02:49:38] it out maybe today I might figure the
[02:49:39] story out good storyline I'm trying to
[02:49:42] think of what it is I'd do for a story
[02:49:44] though hey thank you cely coming back in
[02:49:46] here so I'm thinking my story is going
[02:49:48] to be
[02:49:49] uh so I do have the Wasteland one I've
[02:49:52] been doing so I don't want to stay with
[02:49:53] the Wasteland I think I'm going to
[02:49:54] change the story to be different it's
[02:49:56] not exactly wasted and see what the
[02:49:58] thing is people say dungeon master and I
[02:50:00] always think you know you got to have
[02:50:01] like the you know the Wizards and all
[02:50:03] that stuff but I'm thinking we don't
[02:50:04] need to always do that maybe we do a
[02:50:05] future one sometime you know what I
[02:50:09] mean you got

[02:53:07] Darren dude I don't mind hanging out
[02:53:09] people hey if you come Daren Dar Ian if
[02:53:13] you come and hang out I don't mind that
[02:53:15] I like when people hang out chat talk I
[02:53:17] don't care if you necessarily buying
[02:53:18] stuff all the time because it helps just
[02:53:21] I'm here to get rid of some of the stuff
[02:53:23] that I had I was had I did have a
[02:53:26] different plan but um after learn after
[02:53:29] having a couple things occur the second
[02:53:31] time something occur you know when you
[02:53:33] know three strikes are out type deal uh
[02:53:35] the first time something happened
[02:53:37] somebody was not truthful and dishonest
[02:53:40] and and lied the second time it wasn't a
[02:53:41] dishonesty lie thing it was it was
[02:53:44] correct but they didn't answer me and
[02:53:46] give me and I wasn't given any
[02:53:48] information
[02:53:49] and didn't know what was wrong then the
[02:53:51] third time I was a flat out lie again so
[02:53:53] between lies and
[02:53:55] ignorance I don't think I want to put
[02:53:57] the effort into this type of thing you
[02:53:58] know what I mean and it sucks because I
[02:54:01] had fun doing it with you guys but you
[02:54:03] know what that means though is my wife
[02:54:05] has decided you know what her job
[02:54:08] too her
[02:54:10] uh is switching also I guess they did a
[02:54:14] change in the management stuff and her
[02:54:16] boss is no longer going to be her boss
[02:54:19] it's going to be someone else and she's
[02:54:20] getting put to someone else that she
[02:54:21] doesn't
[02:54:22] really know and want to work under so um
[02:54:26] we're planning on leaving the country
[02:54:27] we're buying a boat we're selling our
[02:54:29] house or buying a boat and we're uh
[02:54:31] doing our travels earlier than we wanted
[02:54:34] to that's okay though you guys can come
[02:54:37] along with us on that trip if you like
[02:54:39] we'll be doing we'll be recording and
[02:54:40] sharing some of that
[02:54:44] travels hey dude go I don't care I I
[02:54:48] really don't care if you guys come in
[02:54:49] and hang out I've already said that many
[02:54:50] times that's fun for me people come in
[02:54:52] and hanging out you know you get to you
[02:54:55] get to like uh like we get to crack
[02:54:57] packs and all kinds of
[02:54:59] stuff know like I I still open them we
[02:55:01] get to talk about stuff know I don't
[02:55:05] really mind it it's one of those things
[02:55:06] for me I'm okay with it as long as
[02:55:11] uh as long as I'm talking and hanging
[02:55:13] out like it's different when like I'm
[02:55:14] just like not here and I'm I'm here and
[02:55:16] I'm like by myself and there's nothing
[02:55:17] going on that's a little different you
[02:55:28] know let's put
[02:55:36] out grab this here going go this
[02:55:40] next and we'll put one of those
[02:55:43] out with
[02:55:48] with one of these I think that's what
[02:55:49] I'm going to do next I'm take that
[02:55:51] that'll be the next
[02:55:57] one the Verger
[02:56:05] back yeah but we're looking to travel
[02:56:08] we'll be on a uh we wanted to be on a
[02:56:10] cataman but the company I work for where
[02:56:14] I hav't um stock in they said we were
[02:56:16] going to sell in 5 years and it's been 5
[02:56:19] years so they haven't sold yet so
[02:56:23] instead of waiting for them to sell
[02:56:26] we're going to do it early and we're
[02:56:28] going to jump on this and we're going to
[02:56:29] sell um all of our
[02:56:31] stuff buy a
[02:56:33] boat we'll be in the Bahamas for a
[02:56:35] little while traveling back and forth be
[02:56:37] us in Bahamas for about probably six
[02:56:39] months or so on my guesses then we'll
[02:56:41] travel down through the Caribbean for a
[02:56:43] couple
[02:56:45] years then we'll do our Crossing Maybe
[02:56:48] maybe like three 3 years from now four
[02:56:50] years from now we'll
[02:56:54] see we shall see but that is the plan
[02:56:57] for what we're going to do the kids are
[02:56:58] all on board Will's good with it he
[02:57:00] wants to go and try scuba dive because
[02:57:02] we're going to learn how to scuba dive
[02:57:03] since he's 10 he can do
[02:57:04] that my youngest is excited because he
[02:57:07] gets to play soccer with people all
[02:57:08] around the world he's a big soccer
[02:57:09] player and he's actually really good so
[02:57:11] he gets to play soccer he's like oh cool
[02:57:13] I'm going to play soccer with people all
[02:57:14] around the world I'm like yeah dude
[02:57:16] you're going to learn how to play soccer
[02:57:17] with people that no kinds of tricks that
[02:57:19] no one else in this country will know so
[02:57:21] that when you come back here for um
[02:57:22] College you'll be smoking people if
[02:57:24] you're still
[02:57:38] playing trying to think what to
[02:57:43] do trying to think of what I want to do
[02:57:46] you
[02:57:47] know you want to do any
[02:57:49] Adventures now you know what I'm going
[02:57:51] to think of I'm going to think up the
[02:57:54] adventure now should our adventure be uh
[02:57:57] the one that I'm
[02:57:59] doing do we want it to be uh like a
[02:58:02] dungeon one where it's like Wizards and
[02:58:06] warriors do we want a futuristic
[02:58:08] one where it's like similar but you know
[02:58:12] future where it's uh maybe it's a
[02:58:15] technician and a uh you know uh
[02:58:19] something like that I don't know
[02:58:20] apocalyptic o the apocalyptic like we
[02:58:23] got here apocalyptic is good that's I
[02:58:25] say the other one the apocalyptic
[02:58:27] because we got Fallout anybody been
[02:58:29] watching that Fallout TV show because
[02:58:31] with the Fallout TV show and everything
[02:58:33] figure that's got a good a good theme
[02:58:34] for right now with everybody paying
[02:58:38] attention all right
[02:58:43] apocalyptic we can do
[02:58:46] that and then
[02:58:51] apocalyptic and um let's
[02:58:55] see it'll be about two hours
[02:58:58] long I think we'll have to build two
[02:59:00] characters I don't think we can build
[02:59:02] three or four I think three is too much
[02:59:03] for the first game I think it'll be two
[02:59:07] characters you'll build a character I
[02:59:09] think one will be like a technician and
[02:59:11] one will be either a human or mutant
[02:59:14] that'll be the decision for like a
[02:59:16] strong human or strong being
[02:59:19] so we have like a tank and then you have
[02:59:21] a uh like a range fighter I think that's
[02:59:24] what we can
[02:59:27] do all
[02:59:33] right what
[02:59:35] else all right
[02:59:38] so start out you build your
[02:59:42] characters build their strength each
[02:59:45] pack so we'll have three different
[02:59:48] rounds to buy packs that's what we'll do
[02:59:51] to build the character first is to
[02:59:53] choose what it is is a female or a
[02:59:55] male second to chuse is a mutant or a
[02:59:58] human or a
[03:00:00] ghoul and the third will be like it
[03:00:03] strength and its extra special
[03:00:05] stuff and all your packs depending on
[03:00:08] what packs they are will be the amount
[03:00:09] they go to it so if it's a s if it's all
[03:00:11] like sets then it'll be just
[03:00:15] one if it is all
[03:00:18] um like plus one if it is all boost
[03:00:21] drafts it's all just a regular and you
[03:00:23] get to pick some of them you don't know
[03:00:25] plus and if they're all collector
[03:00:26] boosters then it's a plus two for a
[03:00:29] collector booster on whatever you put it
[03:00:31] towards like maybe your strength or your
[03:00:33] gunm ship or something like that yeah I
[03:00:34] think that's not a bad
[03:00:40] idea that'll
[03:00:42] work all
[03:00:44] right whoever buys will be able to
[03:00:46] choose for that round
[03:00:49] all
[03:00:50] right
[03:00:53] then plan the
[03:00:56] adventure and the courses will be
[03:00:59] depending on which direction you go all
[03:01:02] right depending on which direction you
[03:01:05] go what you're going to choose in The
[03:01:08] Adventure whatever packs you buy I'll
[03:01:10] put up I'll put up an option of packs
[03:01:12] again so like it'll be booster it'll be
[03:01:15] like draft set and collector booster
[03:01:18] and depending on what you
[03:01:20] buy oh I'm going to put it up as an
[03:01:23] auction and you have to bid up to pack
[03:01:25] for what you want to buy that's what
[03:01:27] I'll
[03:01:28] do 5K you're getting it Darian thank you
[03:01:35] buddy so do
[03:01:41] that and the choices to go Which Way in
[03:01:44] the adventure will be based on the pack
[03:01:46] and what the person says so they going
[03:01:48] to do one thing or another and then we
[03:01:50] roll to see what happens and then the
[03:01:53] bonus will be based on the pack so it
[03:01:55] won't be any bonus for a set for a draft
[03:01:58] for a set it'll be a plus one and for a
[03:02:00] CO elector booster it'll be a plus two
[03:02:01] again so it'll be like a little addition
[03:02:03] to whatever it is I think that might
[03:02:05] work
[03:02:08] actually that actually might
[03:02:11] work you work your way to the boss at
[03:02:14] the end
[03:02:21] I played Fallout since the beginning
[03:02:23] first game when it came out on the
[03:02:24] computer
[03:02:26] so I got some good uh Wasteland
[03:02:33] stuff you know what I think I can do
[03:02:36] that I can do that Daren your hands are
[03:02:39] on fire dude your hands going to be
[03:02:40] hurting
[03:02:43] man all right I'm G put this one back
[03:02:46] put this one back
[03:02:52] we'll put this out for your adventure
[03:02:54] now remember I'm just putting out random
[03:02:56] things so you don't need me to tell you
[03:02:58] it so if there is somebody in here that
[03:03:00] wants to pick something up you can just
[03:03:01] say hey I want these packs instead or
[03:03:04] something because I'm just literally
[03:03:06] running random stuff
[03:03:22] I'm literally going over and just
[03:03:23] grabbing random things from my
[03:03:26] uh my packs over
[03:03:36] here that that and that there you go see
[03:03:41] if anybody wants to try
[03:03:45] that oh wow interesting okay
[03:03:49] H I have seizures myself so I kind of
[03:03:53] understand a little
[03:03:54] bit uh not Tremors but I understand the
[03:03:57] uh shaking stuff carpal tunnel incoming
[03:04:01] I
[03:04:03] know I know my hands just hurt thinking
[03:04:06] about
[03:04:11] it so what do you guys think about our
[03:04:13] uh what what do you think about that
[03:04:14] Adventure idea not a bad one I think
[03:04:16] that's pretty good I I think that could
[03:04:18] work cuz each pack helps you decide
[03:04:21] which direction you're going and the
[03:04:22] amount of strength you have or maybe
[03:04:24] like bonus towards like maybe you're
[03:04:26] going to use shooting to shoot something
[03:04:27] you know what I mean it'll be a bonus
[03:04:28] that you can maybe roll and do you hit
[03:04:30] its head do you hit it you know do you
[03:04:32] roll do you hit its leg whatever it is
[03:04:34] type
[03:04:35] thing I think that that's not a bad idea
[03:04:38] and I can use all the things that we
[03:04:40] have now still and just add a few extras
[03:04:43] for the
[03:04:46] animations that could work too cuz I can
[03:04:48] reuse the animations that I have even
[03:04:50] now some of
[03:04:53] them yes as long as there are
[03:04:55] participants I know it's the big biggest
[03:04:58] thing is making sure there's
[03:05:05] participants
[03:05:09] right so be
[03:05:12] it sometimes they are sometimes they AR
[03:05:15] but we'll see what happens sometimes we
[03:05:17] can get people come in and hang out with
[03:05:19] us and do these things but it takes a
[03:05:20] little while every now and
[03:05:26] again but I will end up probably
[03:05:29] um when I do head out here I'll make
[03:05:32] sure I run that giveaway at the end
[03:05:34] before I leave for the day I it'll be on
[03:05:36] for maybe maybe another half hour to an
[03:05:38] hour I don't like hanging out too too
[03:05:40] long because I do have other stuff that
[03:05:42] we do need to get accomplished during
[03:05:43] the days but I at least like to like
[03:05:45] hang out for a little bit sometimes in
[03:05:46] the morning talk to you guys chat maybe
[03:05:49] open some
[03:05:51] packs do some uh do some games if we can
[03:05:55] Let's Do U I got to refill the
[03:05:58] uh I got to refill the things here that
[03:06:01] sucks cuz I was saving those for another
[03:06:03] time frame I guess I'll just use those
[03:06:06] now might as well just use those now
[03:06:17] that one there put that one in there put
[03:06:19] one of those in there for the vault pack
[03:06:21] I have to refill them cuz we only have
[03:06:23] 20 of the gold envelopes so uh I have to
[03:06:26] refill them every now and again they're
[03:06:27] just not like I said they're nothing
[03:06:29] special just a little uh thank you for
[03:06:32] hanging out with us thing that ends up
[03:06:34] being a
[03:06:36] uh just a pack of cards that are nothing
[03:06:39] special you've seen some of them I mean
[03:06:40] some of them are baseball cards too so
[03:06:42] we've seen that before but not they're
[03:06:45] all packs that are like a dollar or less
[03:06:49] nothing special with
[03:06:55] them all right let me
[03:06:58] do this one here let's add another one
[03:07:01] in there so what else do we want I'm put
[03:07:04] in one of these instead you know why not
[03:07:07] I put one of those in since I'm not
[03:07:08] going to be around to use those so why
[03:07:10] not see what's in them actually should I
[03:07:13] save the Coca-Cola one the no I'm going
[03:07:15] to save you know what I'm going to save
[03:07:16] the Santa ones anyways cuz maybe we'll
[03:07:19] use them on Christmas at sometime for
[03:07:20] something
[03:07:22] special got some Santa cards here that's
[03:07:25] what I was talking about go put this
[03:07:27] over here another one of our Benji
[03:07:31] refilled to go back
[03:07:35] in little thank you packs
[03:07:47] uhoh I knocked the boxes
[03:07:50] over oh no I'm knocking crap all over
[03:07:53] the
[03:07:54] place
[03:07:56] no go
[03:07:58] in why are you causing such a problem
[03:08:02] today my fingers are not working well I
[03:08:04] got say there you go no wants to try the
[03:08:07] boxes either we'll put those there there
[03:08:08] you go put those back in there
[03:08:13] refilled Kell in the kid deck oh um
[03:08:19] [Music]
[03:08:23] I can't think of anything
[03:08:31] ah trying to than you let me
[03:08:36] see let's see where are some good
[03:08:40] things killing the kid all right uh
[03:08:43] flying life L whenever you cast spell
[03:08:46] from anywhere other than your hand you
[03:08:49] may cast a permit spell with equal or
[03:08:51] lesser Mana value from your hand without
[03:08:54] pay Mona cost if you don't you put a
[03:08:56] land card from your hand onto the
[03:08:59] battlefield okay so I would use
[03:09:03] something where
[03:09:16] either I would say you would want to do
[03:09:19] something where you have some good
[03:09:21] spells that are higher
[03:09:23] cost not necessar a lot of big ones just
[03:09:25] a few so let's see what uh let's see
[03:09:28] what we have
[03:09:37] here let's see what else will we do
[03:09:51] um let's
[03:09:59] see let's see well you're going to
[03:10:07] want I mean camil the inner sun is a
[03:10:10] nice one if you can get that especially
[03:10:12] with the way that those spells are and
[03:10:14] he's having
[03:10:15] that but that's an that's an expensive
[03:10:18] one that would be a nice one to have
[03:10:19] because especially the way it does with
[03:10:20] the
[03:10:22] Spells
[03:10:25] um trying to think of some others yeah
[03:10:27] it's pricey
[03:10:30] though
[03:10:35] um lightning Greaves that'd be a good
[03:10:38] one to equip because it gets
[03:10:44] troud you want some ramp cards in there
[03:10:47] because the way you have your uh stuff
[03:10:49] so may maybe some ramp
[03:10:57] cards maybe like a beanock giant type
[03:11:00] that's a lot that's an expensive
[03:11:03] one
[03:11:06] maybe some Terror War for Thought vessel
[03:11:09] that wouldn't be bad
[03:11:18] yeah Apex that would be nice for Cascade
[03:11:30] Cascade maybe a
[03:11:32] uh feel like
[03:11:44] um you could do potentially
[03:11:57] Little Giant Killer might
[03:11:59] help giant killer is not a bad one it's
[03:12:01] a cheaper
[03:12:06] one trying to think
[03:12:22] probably want to put a uh maybe oh
[03:12:25] that's a good choice there ellien Allen
[03:12:28] paleontologist that way you can Exile
[03:12:31] anything and uh creature card and
[03:12:33] discover X yeah that's not a bad
[03:12:36] one Ellie and Allen is not a bad
[03:12:42] one I'm just trying to look at cards
[03:12:44] that might work with it cuz Exile
[03:12:47] creature card from your graveyard draw X
[03:12:50] where X is the Mana value of the Exile
[03:12:55] card so like you're going to be with all
[03:12:57] the Spells you do you can Exile
[03:12:59] something pull it out that's not a bad
[03:13:02] one then maybe someone on where you cast
[03:13:04] from the graveyard things because of
[03:13:09] it oh what is the um one whenever you
[03:13:11] cast a spell it duplicates
[03:13:16] it it's like one of the um God's
[03:13:20] ones maybe an O'Hare I think it might
[03:13:26] be not bad I don't know there's a couple
[03:13:28] ones that I might th I maybe throw in
[03:13:30] there that is a harder one that is a
[03:13:32] harder one
[03:13:33] there I'm going to put that
[03:13:36] back to
[03:13:38] here all right we're going to just do um
[03:13:41] let's just do
[03:13:42] a a adventure
[03:13:47] no we're going to do one yeah we're
[03:13:50] going to do one I'm just going to say
[03:13:51] that's one strength why not we're going
[03:13:53] to say it's one one strength
[03:13:56] here that's what we're going to do just
[03:13:59] one I don't care we'll say it's one
[03:14:04] strength if anybody wants try
[03:14:14] it we go do that there you are
[03:14:20] little Thunder Junction if you want
[03:14:23] it let's see I'm trying to think of
[03:14:25] others that might work
[03:14:33] nicely I mean like dream root Cascade is
[03:14:37] good some deserted beaches command Tower
[03:14:41] breeding pool hiin Harbor you know that
[03:14:43] type of
[03:14:45] thing what about
[03:14:57] um need some counter spells or something
[03:14:59] like that in
[03:15:03] there Supreme verdict
[03:15:06] maybe stuff like that get rid of the
[03:15:08] other creatures because you don't have a
[03:15:09] ton of creatures you do a lot of spell
[03:15:11] stuff it would seem you know what I mean
[03:15:13] with your deck
[03:15:28] oh that's not bad Cascade of the locked
[03:15:31] house maybe what's that one give you
[03:15:34] some more
[03:15:37] lands that's pretty good that's not bad
[03:15:39] olog olog is not a bad option for a
[03:15:42] little higher cost on
[03:15:44] the I'm not sure about emoi I'm not sure
[03:15:46] how that work that could work but olog
[03:15:48] might be a tall
[03:15:52] one that could work a little
[03:15:59] bit yeah that might be a potential
[03:16:10] there yes for Cascade it is nice for
[03:16:13] Cascade that is correct that is correct
[03:16:18] we'll put that
[03:16:24] back you know what why not put out
[03:16:26] something like this this will get you
[03:16:28] three strength to start your adventure
[03:16:30] in the
[03:16:37] Wasteland here you
[03:16:40] go why not throw that out there anyways
[03:16:53] know we'll do it for this instead right
[03:17:00] now yeah was any time I did an evening
[03:17:02] show somebody ended up reporting and
[03:17:05] give me an issue so and lying and I
[03:17:07] actually had one of them lied that I got
[03:17:08] away that I had not like not an issue
[03:17:10] with that they they were yeah we see
[03:17:12] that those lie and another one they
[03:17:16] didn't answer me and just manipulated me
[03:17:18] and then the last one they let a lie go
[03:17:21] again so I'm like a three strikes your
[03:17:23] out person so I'm done I'm done with the
[03:17:28] card stuff I'll put some more effort
[03:17:30] into the D and D maybe dungeon master
[03:17:33] thing so some of you guys like me
[03:17:35] playing the games where we do like our
[03:17:37] animated stuff it would be something
[03:17:38] cool that I would do if I did like this
[03:17:40] and did like a like uh this with the
[03:17:42] cars and maybe just doing a literally a
[03:17:45] D and D dungeon master thing as I am
[03:17:47] maybe be a patron do that type
[03:17:51] thing the card
[03:17:53] stuff I just switched from the cards
[03:17:56] over um over to some packs there where
[03:18:00] if you want I can go back to showing
[03:18:05] singles I can go show some of my singles
[03:18:07] off again still hold on while these are
[03:18:10] running I was just kind of
[03:18:13] talking let's see here
[03:18:20] here you go I'll start showing them off
[03:18:22] some of them off
[03:18:25] here all
[03:18:28] right you can do that you can show some
[03:18:30] of the singles off we do have the
[03:18:31] adventure game out there still
[03:18:35] but we'll do that show some of these off
[03:18:38] maybe you want something like a deserted
[03:18:41] beach now if you want a deserted Beach
[03:18:43] let me know I can put that off the side
[03:18:45] with your name on it the way that I like
[03:18:47] to do this here instead of um like yes I
[03:18:50] can go through and do them as auctions
[03:18:52] if you would like or I can do it where
[03:18:55] it's one at a time I put them up there
[03:18:56] you tell me if you want it then I can
[03:18:58] put it off the side with your name on it
[03:19:00] and then add everything up at the end of
[03:19:01] the stream that way you're not paying
[03:19:03] like a bunch of shipping fees and
[03:19:04] potentially like that and I can make
[03:19:05] sure it's a little bit of a that way
[03:19:08] like you're not paying cuz I have to put
[03:19:09] it in and base it on like you're buying
[03:19:11] one card with the shipping and packaging
[03:19:14] so if you do it differently and you do
[03:19:16] like multiple cards C the shipping and
[03:19:17] packaging I'm not going to add into the
[03:19:18] cost of it you know so that's why I'm
[03:19:20] saying um if you wanted to uh change
[03:19:24] things around at some
[03:19:27] point and uh buy some like a bunch of
[03:19:31] them in and a Pat and a group of them
[03:19:34] you would just let me know here after I
[03:19:35] show them
[03:19:40] off all right doesn't look like anybody
[03:19:42] wants that maybe you're going to want a
[03:19:44] spell stutter
[03:19:47] maybe you guys want a spell starter
[03:19:49] there I'll go through some of my other
[03:19:51] cards that I have that are
[03:19:56] left I don't know why that's like that
[03:19:58] that's really weird there's like there
[03:20:00] was some of these that were upside down
[03:20:01] and it was frustrating to me I had to
[03:20:03] change
[03:20:04] it maybe you want
[03:20:07] a gadam
[03:20:09] Ambush now remember just tell me what
[03:20:11] you want and I'll put it off the side or
[03:20:12] I can start just doing as singles if you
[03:20:14] want on screen here like uh like
[03:20:17] actually just run the price of them as a
[03:20:19] single on screen maybe that's what I do

[03:20:27] that get out this figure out what that
[03:20:30] is there for you

[03:24:47] or higher depending on what it
[03:24:48] is I it's generally over an ounce I put
[03:24:52] one between 1 and 3 o is what um I
[03:24:55] generally put down for the weight of
[03:24:56] some of the things so let's put out a uh
[03:24:59] let's put this out next all
[03:25:02] right I'm actually going to do this for
[03:25:04] the next
[03:25:05] one let's
[03:25:07] see put a pure steel
[03:25:11] Paladin 10K you did it Darren you did it
[03:25:14] buddy awesome thank you I appreciate it
[03:25:17] so much that was so
[03:25:20] cool like I don't ever have to pay
[03:25:22] attention that I never really pay
[03:25:23] attention that much but you that was
[03:25:25] pretty sweet thank you I appreciate that
[03:25:27] a lot
[03:25:30] buddy all right we're going to put this
[03:25:31] one out here little pure steel
[03:25:34] Paladin for those that may want
[03:25:36] it pull the card closer as requested
[03:25:41] before get the light on it nice so you
[03:25:43] can see it
[03:25:50] on screen
[03:25:53] single
[03:25:56] magic
[03:25:58] one
[03:26:04] two5 minute there you go start that
[03:26:06] again little pure steel Paladin it's a
[03:26:09] nice one there thank you for giving me
[03:26:13] that 10K there I like that a lot you
[03:26:16] appreciate
[03:26:20] that going to put out some other ones
[03:26:22] next I'm going to figure out what we're
[03:26:23] going to put out for our next ones maybe
[03:26:26] you're going to want some uh other
[03:26:27] singles I'll throw them out this way it
[03:26:30] does seem like people like it when I do
[03:26:31] it this way that way you get a minute or
[03:26:33] so to look at the card and decide if
[03:26:35] something you
[03:26:39] want maybe they are maybe they not I
[03:26:41] don't know some of the prices of these
[03:26:43] cards were significantly higher when I
[03:26:45] first got them and put them out which is
[03:26:47] interesting the prices drop and they
[03:26:48] fluctuate so much you don't ever it's
[03:26:50] hard to ever know what they are I just
[03:26:53] for the most part need to have some way
[03:26:54] to scan them to be able to tell if I'm
[03:26:57] going to be selling the singles
[03:26:59] regularly I
[03:27:01] realized so part of the reason why I got
[03:27:04] that out of the camera so I have a nice
[03:27:06] setup and that type of thing but also
[03:27:09] because it'll allow me to uh do this
[03:27:11] stuff where I can I'll use my phone to
[03:27:14] talk to you guys or look stuff up online
[03:27:16] if I need to quickly rather than having
[03:27:18] to like move the computer around and
[03:27:19] then adjust the camera view and
[03:27:23] stuff oh damn that's all for shipping
[03:27:27] hey I'll throw you in a vault pack also
[03:27:29] if you don't pick anything else up okay
[03:27:32] that way uh shipping's made it a little
[03:27:33] worth it if I
[03:27:38] can if you want to pick something else
[03:27:40] up I I think it ends up adding it
[03:27:41] together and it's not as
[03:27:45] much I hate
[03:27:47] shipping well you do want to make sure
[03:27:49] your stuff is protected I mean I could
[03:27:51] do it a different way I think I don't
[03:27:53] know if we can do it where we send it
[03:27:54] through the regular
[03:27:55] mail but uh I could check that one out
[03:27:59] as an
[03:28:00] option might be able to do them a little
[03:28:02] cheaper and do it that way but I don't
[03:28:04] know if that's something that you guys
[03:28:05] would want to have occur because then
[03:28:08] that you know the package can be a
[03:28:09] little more damaged I like to make sure
[03:28:11] they're in like you know they're safe
[03:28:13] when they get shipped that's why I never
[03:28:15] like to do it that way
[03:28:18] yeah I can I'll throw one of those in
[03:28:20] for you all right Bud we'll grab one and
[03:28:22] throw one of those in depending yeah if
[03:28:24] you grab some other things you like that
[03:28:26] that way you can help out with the
[03:28:28] shipping a little bit
[03:28:32] there put all these things here all
[03:28:34] right that one was up there no one
[03:28:36] wanted
[03:28:38] it put this
[03:28:40] out this one here is a surge foil
[03:28:47] the night of the
[03:28:55] doctor let's do this here
[03:29:09] actually oops that's not going to work
[03:29:11] CU there's something on the bottom of
[03:29:15] it let's do that so it stays up a little
[03:29:18] straighter there you go stays up a
[03:29:21] little straighter for
[03:29:23] you I think it's a little
[03:29:27] straighter I think it
[03:29:38] is throw this one on
[03:29:42] here if you would like to draw it drve
[03:29:44] jump on this one here
[03:29:51] here do this this this
[03:29:59] this
[03:30:04] this this
[03:30:07] that that and that there a lot of things
[03:30:10] you got to press to make this one
[03:30:12] go little night of the doctor surge
[03:30:20] foil oh you just bought pure steal Bak
[03:30:22] ago
[03:30:26] yeah that's a pretty good card to have
[03:30:28] pure steal is a nice one to
[03:30:40] have okay do those start switching some
[03:30:44] of these ones over too
[03:30:46] I'll grab a different single and throw
[03:30:48] it out after that if that's not what you
[03:30:49] guys are looking
[03:30:56] for I think mom's coming back from the
[03:30:58] grocery

[03:32:28] go try that out for you if you want
[03:32:31] it maybe want an oir Chasm deepest
[03:32:36] growth got some decent
[03:32:38] singles I do have a little good amount
[03:32:40] of them I just never actually sell them
[03:32:42] weirdly just because I never I always
[03:32:45] doing games and I never get to the point
[03:32:47] to sell singles so I'll end up probably
[03:32:49] having to do like a single show at one
[03:32:51] point or maybe I'll put the singles into
[03:32:53] the game somehow the adventure game
[03:32:56] maybe I can do that maybe I can make the
[03:32:59] adventure game with the singles
[03:33:02] somehow like add them in as like a
[03:33:05] character and you you uh if you beat it
[03:33:09] oo you get the single
[03:33:11] maybe H that might be something
[03:33:13] intriguing
[03:33:16] in the adventure game I'll put
[03:33:17] characters in and if you get to beat
[03:33:19] them you uh maybe keep the single that
[03:33:21] might be an intriguing way to do the
[03:33:24] game all right fell on over sorry about
[03:33:27] that
[03:33:31] everyone there you go no one wanted that
[03:33:34] one all right let's put that back over
[03:33:37] here we throw out some more of the
[03:33:39] singles let's do a
[03:33:43] um Pyro blastp

[03:35:30] questions that explains the adventure
[03:35:32] but some people it seemed like the
[03:35:33] singles were requested a little bit so I
[03:35:35] figured I'd go through some of them that
[03:35:37] way um if you want to look at them you
[03:35:38] can I have a lot of different singles
[03:35:40] too interestingly I um actually do have

[04:08:26] easily cuz when I put one in at a time
[04:08:29] sometimes they slide around and I don't
[04:08:30] want that to happen so we do it like

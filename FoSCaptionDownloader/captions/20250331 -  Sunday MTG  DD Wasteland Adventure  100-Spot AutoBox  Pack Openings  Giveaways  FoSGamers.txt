[00:02:42] architect not bad for Moro my wife could
[00:02:44] use that one Thornwood Falls and a
[00:02:47] samurai all right you got the modern
[00:02:51] Horizon 3 play booster my friend now
[00:02:54] what you got with that what we got here
[00:02:57] for you we'll get one of those over
[00:03:00] not a bad one to start the day with
[00:03:03] modern Horizon 3 and then what you're
[00:03:05] going to get here my friend is uh you
[00:03:07] actually when you're wandering big BK is
[00:03:10] one of our our regular players so he's
[00:03:12] wandering around here and you wander in
[00:03:15] and find some uh when you're in this
[00:03:17] Wasteland you go and find some
[00:03:20] supplies um and you scavenge some
[00:03:24] components
[00:03:26] from some other where they go
[00:03:30] [Music]
[00:03:32] scaven some electrical components find
[00:03:35] like a chip
[00:03:37] somewhere and you also find some metal
[00:03:40] that's what I was looking
[00:03:42] for and uh maybe some other electronic
[00:03:45] parts there so with those components
[00:03:48] though one of the cool things is you
[00:03:49] know you know you have your uh
[00:03:52] engineering maybe you want to try to fix
[00:03:54] that upgrade machine that you found one
[00:03:57] 2 3 4 five six seven and eight all right
[00:04:03] here we go let's see what you got
[00:04:07] here yeah try the machine possibly
[00:04:10] Twisted landscape Mand kite Evolution
[00:04:14] witness Siege smash Tempest Harvester
[00:04:18] scarless Sentry sarpadian smokum static
[00:04:22] prison furnace hell kite it that Heralds
[00:04:25] the end if I remember that used to be a
[00:04:27] little a decent hit right there
[00:04:29] revitalizing
[00:04:31] past deep analysis guide of souls that's
[00:04:35] a nice pickup for you buddy with a warp
[00:04:38] tusker and a foil and a Servo unless
[00:04:40] that's dropped that was a nice
[00:04:43] pickup got of souls for
[00:04:46] you all right well that's not a bad idea
[00:04:48] so you found a chip when you're
[00:04:50] Scavenging around you found some metal
[00:04:52] some other electronic
[00:04:53] components know you'd found uh you
[00:04:56] didn't find the whole thing but you did
[00:04:58] find a part a rust borne drone so that's
[00:05:01] another thing you found but you go on
[00:05:03] around and you try to find and you go oh
[00:05:05] hold on a second where is this thing
[00:05:09] where' I put
[00:05:11] [Music]
[00:05:14] it I have to remember where I put all
[00:05:16] these things
[00:05:29] there we
[00:05:32] go all right so my friend hey there Lexi
[00:05:36] how you doing buddy thanks for coming in
[00:05:38] and hanging out I appreciate that you
[00:05:40] having a hopefully you're having a good
[00:05:41] uh day
[00:05:43] here nice Sunday morning we're opening
[00:05:46] some packs and uh playing we play a
[00:05:48] little D and D game uh while we do it a
[00:05:50] little bit kind of a fun thing added in
[00:05:51] here our right big
[00:05:53] BK ah it dropped huh
[00:05:58] damn B big
[00:06:01] bk509 they fluctuate so
[00:06:04] much well we got you those there not bad
[00:06:09] and then though you find that you have
[00:06:12] that uh you've had that on you
[00:06:14] there nothing is safe anymore no nothing
[00:06:18] is safe so you find that on
[00:06:21] there uh uh you find some of your parts
[00:06:23] there and you I just have that you want
[00:06:28] to try to fix your thing there so now my
[00:06:31] friend you
[00:06:33] have big BK you have some intelligence
[00:06:36] some engineering and some luck so when
[00:06:38] you roll to try to fix something you can
[00:06:42] sometime you get a uh you get added
[00:06:44] three so that means you only need a
[00:06:45] seven you seven or
[00:06:48] higher oh you do have a onetime
[00:06:51] engineering buff too yes you want to use
[00:06:54] that how's it going thank you for coming
[00:06:56] in I'm sorry I I I don't have the uh
[00:06:58] translator on that oh oh no let's see if
[00:07:00] uh YouTube will show up for me hold on a
[00:07:06] second no it didn't oh dang hold
[00:07:10] on I wouldn't translate it I'm sorry I
[00:07:14] don't understand what that is at the
[00:07:15] moment looks like YouTube didn't want to
[00:07:17] translate it for me
[00:07:18] either let's use it all right I'm say
[00:07:21] that's a good idea so you use your one
[00:07:23] time engineering buff that you had
[00:07:24] brings you up with four so that means
[00:07:26] you have six or higher you need six or
[00:07:29] higher
[00:07:30] let's see what happens buddy ooh look at
[00:07:34] that ah you get six or higher good thing
[00:07:38] you use that extra two there that was
[00:07:40] close that would have been rough that
[00:07:41] would have been rough that was too that
[00:07:42] was a little closer than we wanted it to
[00:07:44] be so your uh your your scrap weapon uh

[00:08:00] uh and uh you got to decide at some
[00:08:02] point maybe you want to maybe you want
[00:08:04] to try to get a run in there and test
[00:08:06] something out again but it's always up
[00:08:07] to you what you do
[00:08:10] there see if somebody else has a weapon
[00:08:12] or something they want to throw in and
[00:08:13] get tested out maybe yeah that's not a
[00:08:15] bad one thanks coming in from the my

[00:11:45] it all right so you're going to slice it
[00:11:48] up with your sword now it's only a 13
[00:11:51] it's not really doing anything menacing
[00:11:52] and it's just kind of standing there

[00:12:54] going to are you going to pick up the
[00:12:55] knife I mean you have something you
[00:12:56] could test out with your uh your machine

[00:13:01] weapon slice it again all right going
[00:13:04] after it again you chase
[00:13:06] down try to slice it

[00:13:12] eight
[00:13:15] 10 all right well you hit it and that
[00:13:19] time it was chopped that stray ghoul was
[00:13:22] chopped in half that time you hit him oh
[00:13:27] no the friend that was there now you go
[00:13:29] over there's nothing on it but you do

[00:13:34] had they had a battered knife there you
[00:13:37] did find that all right going to try it
[00:13:40] and use it in the upgrade
[00:13:41] machine all right we can do that and
[00:13:44] summon some
[00:13:45] muffin I need a number between 1 and 10
[00:13:48] so we can see what you got for the

[00:14:28] those out we got a bunch of those
[00:14:30] all right well you slice it up you go
[00:14:32] back over to use this now it's going to
[00:14:34] have to be uh use
[00:14:38] your it's going to be a uh seven or
[00:14:41] higher to do anything with that
[00:14:44] knife o well looks like when you put the
[00:14:47] knife
[00:14:49] in your
[00:14:53] machine wors a bit makes some noises
[00:14:57] beeps a couple times
[00:15:00] and
[00:15:01] then spits
[00:15:09] out three throwing knives I know that's
[00:15:12] more than three there but spits out
[00:15:13] three throwing
[00:15:15] knives well that's
[00:15:24] interesting now you have to decide I'm
[00:15:26] pretty sure you're at your limit because
[00:15:28] you're carrying that upgrade
[00:15:30] machine so you decide if you want to
[00:15:32] drop something or you want to uh keep
[00:15:35] going
[00:15:37] there we're going to run some more if
[00:15:39] anybody else wants to jump in and hang
[00:15:40] out this morning with
[00:15:46] us drink my coffe
[00:15:50] there oh you did use the buff that's
[00:15:53] true you're down a spot good point
[00:16:03] I forgot about that
[00:16:06] ah rubber rubber toe rubbertoe so what
[00:16:10] we do here is uh we have we you have the
[00:16:13] Magic Gathering cards that we uh sell as
[00:16:15] a you know a do like a auto box here so
[00:16:20] it goes through there's 100 spots there
[00:16:21] some everything from play boosters two
[00:16:23] collector boosters I think there might
[00:16:24] be a Decker and some secret layer
[00:16:26] potentially in there I can't remember I
[00:16:27] think it's just a deck in there actually
[00:16:29] and a bunch of singer uh and a bunch of
[00:16:31] packs you get one of those and
[00:16:33] associated with it'll say something
[00:16:34] going on in in our little D and D type
[00:16:36] Adventure that we have uh made it while
[00:16:39] back and people kept gravitating towards
[00:16:41] it and it's evolved into this now to the
[00:16:43] point where we have our buddy here now
[00:16:44] you got your Aether drift play booster
[00:16:47] is what you get in here all right and
[00:16:50] then what we're going to do is you got
[00:16:52] lucky you're Scavenging around silver
[00:16:55] sneaks been wandering around different
[00:16:57] places they got and stuff and when they
[00:16:59] scavenge around they find some pogs look
[00:17:02] at that you find yourself uh one of the
[00:17:03] Slammers which is 10 and five of them to
[00:17:07] get yourself 15 pogs when you're
[00:17:08] wandering around we're going to look
[00:17:10] here though but
[00:17:12] because thought I had here you did got
[00:17:15] to decide though what's going on because
[00:17:16] uh silver sneak are you the one still
[00:17:19] hanging out in the uh the junkyard I
[00:17:21] can't remember oh
[00:17:27] no you're still the Armory oh you were
[00:17:30] in the bunker all right you're in the

[00:25:13] there might actually be a workbench
[00:25:15] around hold on a second there's uh there
[00:25:16] was around the corner there where we
[00:25:19] were uh around the corner here there was
[00:25:22] a
[00:25:23] uh there was a workbench near uh near
[00:25:28] some uh ghouls over there in the
[00:25:30] background though and there was another
[00:25:31] there's a couple other guys there that
[00:25:32] we haven't met yet uh some of those
[00:25:34] Vault born now um they were over there
[00:25:37] but there does seem to be a workbench in
[00:25:38] that direction just kind of off to our
[00:25:40] left
[00:25:44] here you going to head over there and
[00:25:47] our buddy big BK all right you have a
[00:25:49] your choice you have a reputation you
[00:25:51] you became part of the uh Pirates so you
[00:25:54] were wandering
[00:25:55] around and you happened to bump into of
[00:25:58] the Pirates here these Pirates and he
[00:25:59] goes hey Mar hey
[00:26:01] mty calls on
[00:26:05] you you head over towards the ghouls all
[00:26:08] right well that's what Silver Streak
[00:26:10] does and then big BK
[00:26:13] here you're meeting that pirate you're
[00:26:15] out you uh you you step outside of your
[00:26:22] area let let him slide you did you did
[00:26:25] run him into it before you have run into
[00:26:27] before but now uh
[00:26:28] this is this may be a different one
[00:26:30] might be a different one they all look
[00:26:32] similar you know they're all rough
[00:26:34] weathered ocean beaten so you have to
[00:26:37] decide uh you talk to him he's uh come
[00:26:40] you go over and you start talking to him
[00:26:42] he goes oh yes uh around the corner
[00:26:43] there's a there's a vault that has some
[00:26:46] Rust born in it we've been trying to get
[00:26:48] into loot over there supposedly they
[00:26:51] have a
[00:26:52] uh some nice uh electronics in there
[00:26:56] some new some some uh you know
[00:26:59] technology good technology we could
[00:27:01] use so you have to
[00:27:04] decide take that information from him
[00:27:07] but you you say yes no you get a little
[00:27:09] reputation boost it's up to
[00:27:15] you we'll run another here for those
[00:27:18] that want to jump in and hang out you're
[00:27:19] down all right you all right buddy let
[00:27:21] me know where that is and you say and
[00:27:22] you say take that
[00:27:24] challenge and what happens is because
[00:27:26] you're part of that faction
[00:27:30] now being a
[00:27:32] pirate you get some
[00:27:35] uh plus one on your reputation so if
[00:27:39] anything goes
[00:27:40] on pirate
[00:27:42] related you uh get a little extra so
[00:27:45] here for you here's the
[00:27:47] Pirates waste Wasteland Pirates their
[00:27:49] loyalty is to the highest bidder they
[00:27:51] faction of opportunist Raiders and
[00:27:53] mercenaries who sail around across a
[00:27:54] wasteland ruins and some landships in
[00:27:57] the oceans they hold they hold no
[00:27:59] alliances except to those that bring it
[00:28:01] profit they have ability to switch sides
[00:28:03] based on whatever's going on for
[00:28:05] personal gain so if they're fighting
[00:28:06] they might jump to the other side at
[00:28:07] some point they have access to Hidden
[00:28:08] cashes of stolen weapons and supplies
[00:28:11] they have discounts on smuggling
[00:28:12] services and under the table deals but
[00:28:14] they have no Allegiance so nobody will
[00:28:16] really believe them and uh they are
[00:28:18] sometimes forced into difficult choices
[00:28:20] when uh money is
[00:28:25] involved so big BK I like it you came in
[00:28:28] in with
[00:28:31] another big

[00:31:09] one that hasn't been chosen this turn
[00:31:11] draw a card create a treasure token each
[00:31:13] opponent loses three
[00:31:16] life nice one there that one does wasn't
[00:31:20] that one that was like really low
[00:31:23] before and then uh now all of a sudden
[00:31:25] this is starting to go up
[00:31:31] oh yeah yeah yeah all right all right
[00:31:33] all right I didn't know was that exp I
[00:31:35] was like I don't know oh it's 13 oh
[00:31:37] that's not bad
[00:31:38] then still pretty
[00:31:41] good all right
[00:31:43] well you're uh you get that there and
[00:31:47] you have uh you go wandering
[00:31:52] in but your uh your scrap weon weapon
[00:31:54] machine starts uh making some noises
[00:31:56] again
[00:31:58] I don't know maybe it notices something
[00:31:59] around because you uh you get into that
[00:32:02] Vault there and
[00:32:05] inside there's uh nothing in that first
[00:32:07] area you walk in but in that second area
[00:32:09] that you see the right in there where
[00:32:11] those SC the Scavengers were that were
[00:32:12] arguing they're arguing still but uh you
[00:32:15] see this uh other like robot like thing
[00:32:19] hanging out
[00:32:21] around all right you head over that
[00:32:25] you're asking for some assistance
[00:32:28] with your machine and says you know what
[00:32:30] I can
[00:32:31] help and it takes a chip which it seems
[00:32:33] like it just can pop out out of nowhere
[00:32:36] puts it in says all right try your
[00:32:38] machine out now this will work at least
[00:32:40] once might only might not work more than
[00:32:42] that but at least you'll get one rep
[00:32:43] round out of that
[00:32:46] so what weapon are you going to
[00:32:48] try to do an upgrade with because that's
[00:32:52] what your option is now you get a
[00:32:54] custom upgrade that you get to do
[00:32:59] here nice pick up big
[00:33:05] BK right now you have incendiary Gat the
[00:33:07] Pirates sword the alien sniper rifle the
[00:33:10] flamethrower you do not have cuz that
[00:33:12] blew up and you have an
[00:33:15] AR and then you have three throwing
[00:33:21] knives the Gat all right put the
[00:33:24] incendiary Gat in all right
[00:33:29] and then uh let's see what type of
[00:33:32] upgrades we'll get here all right now
[00:33:35] you got to let me know kind of what you
[00:33:36] want to do with it I'm going to get a
[00:33:37] little bit of an idea if all right all
[00:33:40] right you can do something tolerable not
[00:33:41] over the top nothing giant but something
[00:33:43] like uh you know something basic maybe
[00:33:45] uh maybe a uh uh like a
[00:33:50] uh bayonet on it or something like that
[00:33:54] maybe you can add um underneath it a
[00:33:57] grenade launcher potentially you have no
[00:33:59] grenades but something like
[00:34:02] that think of it's your your choice on
[00:34:05] what you want to
[00:34:07] do ah I can't you can't add that to your
[00:34:11] damage you get it'll get a Little Bit
[00:34:13] Stronger though it's now instead of
[00:34:17] um instead of being at seven you're now
[00:34:21] at eight for your roll but you can do
[00:34:24] maybe a little something different can't
[00:34:26] add that there I don't I think uh we'll
[00:34:28] have to see I'll have to be a little bit
[00:34:30] later potentially I don't think we can
[00:34:32] add that much yet cuz you're at uh at
[00:34:34] four of them yeah no no not yet you can
[00:34:36] add a little extra so you get like the
[00:34:39] option of a the the chance of doing
[00:34:42] something like I was saying for instance
[00:34:43] you add um a bayonet if they're close we
[00:34:47] can you know roll that you have an
[00:34:48] actual chance of hitting them stabbing
[00:34:50] them if they're close to you or say uh
[00:34:52] or we can add in with the incendiary
[00:34:54] maybe you want to make the incendiary
[00:34:55] have the opp potential of EXP loading on
[00:34:58] target you know something like that I
[00:35:00] don't know you got to give me a custom
[00:35:01] upgrade you're the one that's coming up
[00:35:03] with it I shouldn't be the one I don't
[00:35:04] I'm not the one that's coming up with it
[00:35:07] the exploding ones all right you have a
[00:35:08] chance of exploding all right all right
[00:35:09] I like it so uh one and four chance
[00:35:13] of your uh one and four chance of
[00:35:16] exploding all right
[00:35:28] one in four chance of them exploding
[00:35:31] every time you
[00:35:32] roll with it I like it not bad got
[00:35:35] yourself uh you upgraded your Gatling
[00:35:37] gun looks the same but the the
[00:35:41] difference is though it's the it's the
[00:35:42] weapons that's say have bullets inside
[00:35:45] now that thing will
[00:35:48] uh blow up on target
[00:35:51] now big BK coming in with the murders at

[00:45:27] you have plus eight now right CU it was
[00:45:32] seven before you have plus eight and a
[00:45:35] one and four chance of the explosion so
[00:45:38] H we do not have an
[00:45:41] explosion all
[00:45:43] right and then you do hit them because
[00:45:47] you have 16 or higher so you get
[00:45:51] four yeah you said I thought you said
[00:45:53] two anyways you got it's three here so
[00:45:56] four
[00:45:57] 22 so you get 8 n you hit one of them
[00:46:00] for nine and you miss the blow up but
[00:46:03] because they're incendiary and they're
[00:46:04] on fire that actually one since you hit
[00:46:06] them for nine it drops dead on fire so
[00:46:08] one of those ghouls drops down another

[00:47:37] anything and it doesn't cause a major
[00:47:39] issue cu the explosion went out and it
[00:47:42] just caused a couple bullets to get

[01:43:24] the stopping
[01:43:26] them that's what your side quest
[01:43:29] was
[01:43:32] right and then your your basic weapon
[01:43:34] yes we still need the basic weapon I
[01:43:36] thought your side quest was the talking
[01:43:37] with them and dealing with the zombies
[01:43:39] oh you did well then I wasn't aware I
[01:43:44] thought you already got that one well
[01:43:46] yeah you're talking with those guys
[01:43:47] anyways they say you know what hey we uh
[01:43:50] we can use some we always have stuff in
[01:43:52] our vault here but we've been having a
[01:43:54] hard time getting through this other
[01:43:56] door if you can see in the top right
[01:43:58] there that's why it got it locked shut
[01:44:00] and locked on us a while back we came
[01:44:02] out to do some Scavenging looking around
[01:44:03] for things and then it shot locked and
[01:44:05] we haven't been able to get back in so
[01:44:06] that's why we have to have this uh we
[01:44:07] have this little kind of room in the
[01:44:09] beginning of the Vault here the entrance
[01:44:10] way uh that we we've been living in the
[01:44:12] few of us um what we need though is we
[01:44:16] need a bunch
[01:44:18] of uh chips and some scrap metal cuz we
[01:44:22] got to kind of work on on the the
[01:44:23] mechanism see if we can get it to work
[01:44:25] and open up so we get into the rest of
[01:44:27] the Vault there uh that's going to be a
[01:44:29] hard one though because we have a lot
[01:44:33] of why is that
[01:44:39] freezing are we going to freeze right
[01:44:41] now can you hear me can you hear
[01:44:43] anything I just said there or did I just
[01:44:45] freeze you cut out oh my friends all
[01:44:48] right well that stinks this guy you're
[01:44:50] talking with him and he says we need we
[01:44:52] you know uh we've been stuck in this
[01:44:55] this entrance to the Vault for quite
[01:44:57] some time we came out
[01:44:59] Scavenging and we did not make it back
[01:45:01] in the vault the vault door shut behind
[01:45:02] us and there's been a malfunction so we
[01:45:05] need some of um some of those chips at
[01:45:08] least five of those chips so that we can
[01:45:11] get this door to open and then uh there
[01:45:14] might there was a code at one point that
[01:45:16] we had I think we have it still but that
[01:45:19] might you might need to talk to that
[01:45:20] handy helper bot he might need to figure
[01:45:23] what that
[01:45:24] was so your side quest is
[01:45:34] find five mystery
[01:45:37] chips and talk to the helper bot on
[01:45:41] what's needed for the
[01:45:44] code this is a long
[01:45:48] one it is a long one I know it's a long
[01:45:51] side quest here gave you a little uh
[01:45:54] gave you a little enhanced side quest

[01:56:35] we hit him for
[01:56:36] 10 12 which is good because it's only 15
[01:56:39] Health you being a robot there it you
[01:56:42] hit him with your
[01:56:43] Axe and that scanner hits the ground
[01:56:45] bounces out the round ground fizzes a
[01:56:47] little bit cuz it only has three Health
[01:56:50] left and attacks you you tries to attack

[02:12:01] you do at the workbench it's kind of uh
[02:12:03] it's kind of your imagination takes

[02:12:57] because you got a lot of items
[02:13:00] yeps and yeep says they want to try to
[02:13:03] make a bag and a helmet so Le yeps has
[02:13:06] some
[02:13:07] leather and yeep also has two things for
[02:13:10] metal all right so you have
[02:13:14] uh some intelligence and some luck all
[02:13:17] right so that gives you extra so that
[02:13:18] would be a plus eight I mean that would
[02:13:20] be an eight or higher
[02:13:23] when you roll all right eight or higher
[02:13:27] and we'll see what happens if you get
[02:13:30] your bag with your leather all right
[02:13:33] you're going to try a bag with your
[02:13:34] leather so you you know eight or
[02:13:40] higher that didn't show for some reason
[02:13:43] we're going to roll
[02:13:46] again oh
[02:13:48] no yeps
[02:13:53] we want to go with the first one because
[02:13:54] that was a PL that was a six if you want
[02:13:56] to go with the first one that was hidden
[02:13:58] and came back and your plus two would
[02:13:59] make it the
[02:14:00] eight I'm good with that since we I kind
[02:14:03] of rolled the two of them and one of I
[02:14:05] mean the other one was just rolled it

[02:14:09] that all right you go I'm good with that
[02:14:11] I'm okay with that so you go you get
[02:14:13] that eight and a small bag you have my

[02:20:58] I have like a a trap uh a bait trap it
[02:21:02] just like expands it's like a 12 by8
[02:21:04] trap that expands something like you get
[02:21:05] at uh you know like you get it past Pro
[02:21:07] Shops nothing special I was trying to
[02:21:09] just catch some baa around the boat now
[02:21:11] I had it so and and had been out there
[02:21:12] for I took it on and off for a few days
[02:21:14] in the same exact spot never had a
[02:21:16] problem but for some reason between
[02:21:17] either the wind and the current
[02:21:19] yesterday or a wave or something but it
[02:21:21] pushed it so it went under my boat and
[02:21:25] now I believe it is stuck between the
[02:21:27] Keel and my Rudder so every time I go to
[02:21:30] pull it out I can't get it out so I got
[02:21:32] to go dive down with the we have like a

[02:23:15] search use the search there type the
[02:23:17] card name in and everything that you'll
[02:23:19] see from um from like that would have
[02:23:22] like say
[02:23:23] Mana if you were using Mana box that's
[02:23:25] what I use that's what it pops up as but
[02:23:27] it shows all the information for it so
[02:23:29] you should be able to
[02:23:33] um find one summon muffin there you are
[02:23:35] my friend let's get all those together
[02:23:38] rest of our alphabetical order
[02:23:41] there if you're still hanging
[02:23:47] out Sumo muffin

[02:23:54] was spelled as Sumo
[02:23:57] muffin not summon
[02:24:00] muffin well we got your card for you I'm
[02:24:02] suming Sumo
[02:24:04] muffin and if anybody like we are uh
[02:24:07] yeps you never you guys never let me
[02:24:09] know what you want to do if you want to

[02:24:12] head back over to the uh the Armory to
[02:24:15] finish trying to clear
[02:24:17] it I do believe our buddy sneak though
[02:24:21] bar silver sneak I think he is
[02:24:23] associated with the those that are in
[02:24:25] the Armory
[02:24:26] there so you got to decide what you want
[02:24:28] to do you you can jump in take over
[02:24:32] participate in the wayand I think
[02:24:34] everybody might head
[02:24:35] out we might have lost some of our
[02:24:37] adventurers but we have some our packs
[02:24:39] going if you want I'll shorten this up
[02:24:40] so it goes quicker next time then I
[02:24:42] didn't mean for it to go for a minute
[02:24:44] and a
[02:24:47] half I hate when it does that
[02:24:55] a loose composure all
[02:25:01] right it's a saying like to make you
[02:25:03] lose composure ah all
[02:25:06] right yeah it takes it's a hard one for
[02:25:08] me to do that I have I can read some
[02:25:10] pretty intriguing things if um so I went
[02:25:13] to an all guys High School uh my mom
[02:25:15] wanted me to go to this private school
[02:25:17] in this area so I ended up going there
[02:25:19] uh I had had a scholarship to go there
[02:25:21] that's the only reason I was able to go
[02:25:22] there cuz there place like 20 grand a
[02:25:24] year to go and I had a scholarship that
[02:25:26] if it wasn't for that I miss like two
[02:25:27] questions on the entr exam so I was able
[02:25:29] to get in there on a scholarship but
[02:25:31] having being around like all guys
[02:25:32] growing up for high school you don't
[02:25:34] have the girls around your your filter
[02:25:35] changes a little bit so it's going to be
[02:25:38] hard to get me on a lot of those things
[02:25:40] a
[02:25:42] a you could go looking for some Pirates
[02:25:44] yeah go wander around if you'd like
[02:25:47] Wasteland there see what else you can
[02:25:48] find
[02:25:52] I appreciate that all right yeah yeah it
[02:25:54] takes it takes a lot cuz be between that
[02:25:57] a wrestling team that I was on I was in
[02:25:58] a fraternity in college it's hard to uh
[02:26:02] catch me off guard to get me yeah
[02:26:04] sometimes you might get me laugh though
[02:26:06] you can get me laugh
[02:26:12] sometimes yeah it looks like no one else
[02:26:13] is here all right so hey might as well
[02:26:16] so you're you know what
[02:26:17] hey you're going to go big BK says hey
[02:26:20] buddy I want to go look for some more of
[02:26:22] those pirates so you go wander around
[02:26:24] those burnt out
[02:26:27] buildings
[02:26:30] and you wander a little bit
[02:26:37] further and then you
[02:26:40] find I like that one I like that one you
[02:26:44] keep wandering around you notice there's
[02:26:47] a little bit of water near where you are
[02:26:49] and you follow the water a little bit
[02:26:51] more get more
[02:26:53] water then you follow a little bit more
[02:26:56] to find some more
[02:26:58] water eventually you see
[02:27:01] a little
[02:27:04] Harbor and in that
[02:27:06] Harbor it's a tiny little Cove it's more
[02:27:09] more of a Cove that's a a mud Cove that

[02:41:42] you did not get your multiplier yeps to
[02:41:47] have your uh the shock wave go off off
[02:41:50] that's okay though because you had your
[02:41:53] uh you slam down pretty hard on that
[02:41:55] thing with 12 oh it doesn't matter you
[02:41:58] hit it down so hard that you hit it and
[02:42:00] you kill it it got close to you you
[02:42:03] didn't like

[00:03:58] okay we like to to do pack deals this
[00:04:00] morning remember you guys can tell me
[00:04:02] what you want in the buy now like hey I

[00:04:07] you a pack deal on those three just so
[00:04:09] we can uh see what we can do here maybe
[00:04:11] one of these times you'll
[00:04:13] uh want to jump in and do the game in
[00:04:16] itself because each time you play the
[00:04:18] game you get a potential of
[00:04:20] winning a fourth
[00:04:24] pack whoa Bray that stinks I'm sorry
[00:04:27] yeah there a not not a good way to start
[00:04:29] the
[00:04:30] morning that reminds me I got to do this
[00:04:34] do not
[00:04:35] disturb there we go yeah that's not good
[00:04:38] with an amber alert I I hate when those
[00:04:40] things happen I always feel like I'm
[00:04:41] like oh my God and then like you're like
[00:04:43] for me I'm always looking around for the
[00:04:46] vehicle no matter what like for days
[00:04:50] like do I see that vehicle is that the
[00:04:51] vehicle that they're talking
[00:04:55] about yeah I live in Florida so um we we
[00:04:59] run into it not not as much as Texas I
[00:05:01] feel like Texas runs into it more than
[00:05:03] me here but we run into it our fair
[00:05:05] share I think Florida and Texas are like
[00:05:07] the top two states for trafficking or
[00:05:09] something like that so I mean when you
[00:05:11] live with border places and a lot of
[00:05:13] places that they get in and out easy
[00:05:15] that's what
[00:05:16] happens but yeah like for days you're
[00:05:19] like looking around like do I see the
[00:05:20] car what's going on am I seeing that
[00:05:21] vehicle because you're wondering if it's
[00:05:23] somebody that was like a family member
[00:05:24] abducting but then you're wondering was
[00:05:25] it some random person abducting and you
[00:05:27] need to be attent pay attention because
[00:05:28] they're going to abduct your
[00:05:31] children this world is nuts never used
[00:05:34] to be this
[00:05:38] bad I don't remember having to worry
[00:05:40] about being abducted when I was a kid I
[00:05:41] used to ride my
[00:05:42] bike I know I'm 40 now so that was you
[00:05:47] know 30 years ago but I used to ride my
[00:05:49] bike from my house to
[00:05:52] downtown and it would be probably now I
[00:05:56] think that would probably be about 10
[00:05:57] miles it would have been back uh from
[00:06:00] where my house was and never had any
[00:06:03] problem going there and back there never
[00:06:05] never had an issue if anything people
[00:06:08] would stop and check you check on you if
[00:06:10] you uh if you if are you on the side of
[00:06:11] the road and like my bike say my bike
[00:06:13] chain wasn't on and I was on the side of
[00:06:15] the road and I was trying to fix it
[00:06:17] people would start me like hey do you
[00:06:18] need any help with that it looks like
[00:06:19] you're having an issue now they try to
[00:06:21] [ __ ] run you off the road because
[00:06:22] they see you over
[00:06:25] there we're going to do this for our
[00:06:27] pack deal this morning hey r

[00:10:17] this
[00:10:18] morning we going to put this

[00:10:26] this I started out at this right here if
[00:10:29] you want all right for those three packs
[00:10:32] and then that Adventure Wasteland game
[00:10:34] what happens is you choose if you're
[00:10:36] going to be one of four characters and
[00:10:39] depending on those four characters you
[00:10:41] either get plus one or minus one a 5050
[00:10:44] a plus one orus one 50 50 and a 25 75 uh
[00:10:48] for plus one minus one for your points
[00:10:51] then you battle
[00:10:52] against one of the bosses depending on
[00:10:56] what you pull out and what goes for you
[00:10:59] you pull out a card and you say you know
[00:11:00] what I'm going to go with this one here
[00:11:01] and oh my you actually may have had a
[00:11:03] chance that time because if you had
[00:11:05] gotten two you would have had a chance
[00:11:07] of beating no and Grady rate there with
[00:11:09] having two points there because you
[00:11:11] start out here with one already with
[00:11:13] having these but I'm going to start you
[00:11:15] guys out because you're starting it out
[00:11:17] with the first one normally this would
[00:11:18] start you out with one point I'm gonna
[00:11:20] start you out with two points all right
[00:11:22] chupacabra just so we can get this going
[00:11:24] and give a little example of the game
[00:11:26] thank you for jumping in and I'm going
[00:11:27] to give you that a little extra so we
[00:11:28] can get you two points and see what we
[00:11:29] can do there all right and CH with that
[00:11:33] being said you jumped in on the game our
[00:11:37] Wasteland game now in our first box here
[00:11:39] bud what we're going to do is you are
[00:11:41] starting off at two points you want to
[00:11:42] see if you're plus one or minus one you
[00:11:44] want to see you looking for you either

[00:23:52] team and I I know they it was like their
[00:23:54] like chin up challenge and I did like 70

[00:24:30] yeah dude I was 125 pounds I wrestled I
[00:24:32] was at a third in the state um for my
[00:24:34] weight
[00:24:41] class entire half a point oh interesting
[00:24:43] Freddy you can have one
[00:24:46] buyback if you
[00:24:47] want but if you har if you get a harm
[00:24:50] card you lose a point
[00:24:56] interesting
[00:24:59] you know what that happens my my nephew
[00:25:01] made a comment about that he went in and
[00:25:03] he got actually a lot uh it took him he
[00:25:05] got like after a little while he finally
[00:25:08] built some of his muscle mass back up
[00:25:10] but for the first few years he said he
[00:25:12] actually felt like he lost muscle mass
[00:25:15] until he got the endurance part of it
[00:25:18] back I think it was like I think my my
[00:25:19] guess is they were trying to build the
[00:25:21] endurance aspect for him is my is what I
[00:25:24] was ever guessing but I don't know he
[00:25:25] made the same comment though he felt
[00:25:27] weaker strengthwise for a little while
[00:25:30] but I think it was um a lot of he didn't
[00:25:32] then after I think it was after probably
[00:25:36] his for first tour I think he did his
[00:25:40] second tour and then that's when he said
[00:25:42] he was like he started like hit stronger
[00:25:44] I can't remember but I know he made a
[00:25:45] com a similar comment when he first
[00:25:49] started but yeah I used to be able to do
[00:25:51] like I used to be I was extremely strong
[00:25:52] at one point but I uh I uh long story
[00:25:57] short
[00:25:58] um I had a very bad anemia issue where
[00:26:01] there were some internal bleeds I almost
[00:26:03] died about a year and a half ago I went
[00:26:07] from
[00:26:07] 185 pounds of muscle down to 139 pounds
[00:26:13] um I actually have a picture on my phone
[00:26:15] I just don't have it here I look like a
[00:26:17] walking skeleton actually um they
[00:26:20] thought I was going to die uh I actually
[00:26:23] was in the hospital for a weekend
[00:26:24] getting blood and transfusions and [ __ ]
[00:26:27] so
[00:26:28] I uh I used to be a lot stronger than I
[00:26:30] am now I'm starting to slowly gain that
[00:26:31] muscle mass back and get stronger but
[00:26:35] taking time it's taking
[00:26:40] time yeah yeah that's what he made the
[00:26:42] comment was he was like Wicked Strong
[00:26:43] and he was like go to the military he
[00:26:45] like oh look at me he's like almost I
[00:26:46] became like this Bean pole and then then
[00:26:48] a few years in I I got stronger thank
[00:26:51] you CH for that we're going to run this
[00:26:53] oh did this not run sometimes these
[00:26:56] things don't run
[00:27:01] no it did not
[00:27:04] run come on run there we
[00:27:11] go oh that's good that's that's better
[00:27:18] though yeah I was 125 pounds in high
[00:27:21] school my senior year which um then um I
[00:27:25] went into college became 150
[00:27:28] slowly graduated up to about 180ish I
[00:27:30] was about at my largest then I almost
[00:27:35] died I don't know else to say that then
[00:27:37] I almost died and I lost all that so
[00:27:40] it's going to take me probably another
[00:27:41] few years to gain all that
[00:27:43] back which is okay just means I got to
[00:27:46] put some strong effort in like I did
[00:27:48] before and I'm not I'm not adverse to
[00:27:52] effort not adverse of putting effort

[00:32:16] get two or three more points added into
[00:32:18] the into our game I don't know what's
[00:32:21] going to happen with your
[00:32:23] Adventurer are you going to be a
[00:32:26] technician and find yourself a
[00:32:30] treasure to help you along the way that
[00:32:32] you can sell for an
[00:32:34] item that your companion can use to get
[00:32:38] you five points to be able to
[00:32:40] potentially beat Owen oh that could be a
[00:32:42] nice
[00:32:45] Oney what's up
[00:32:48] um want to take both of these do we
[00:32:53] have um I have my cord here that I can
[00:32:57] can use and I don't know about another
[00:32:58] long
[00:33:02] cord that's
[00:33:03] fine what about a collector of Lord of
[00:33:06] the Rings a collector of mkm and a
[00:33:09] mystery booster I can do something like
[00:33:11] all right so that would be so a l of the
[00:33:13] Rings
[00:33:14] collector if you went with a Lord of the
[00:33:16] Rings
[00:33:17] collector a
[00:33:21] mkm that's all right an mkm and a
[00:33:25] mystery booster you know what that would
[00:33:27] be three points
[00:33:31] [Music]
[00:33:34] but that would be three points yes that
[00:33:36] would be three points I yes because
[00:33:38] normally that I'm gonna I'm gonna do
[00:33:39] this is like this is like a one and a
[00:33:42] halfer so this would be three points
[00:33:44] right
[00:33:46] here yes that is
[00:33:49] correct Myster is
[00:33:53] premium so you get three points out of
[00:33:55] this one I was going to say like this
[00:33:56] this is like a one and a halfer so
[00:33:58] you're definitely getting three points
[00:33:59] it's like three and a half here because
[00:34:00] of how much that is so I'm going to
[00:34:02] consider this like a one and a half
[00:34:04] actually so if anybody ever wants to go
[00:34:06] with Lord of the Rings this is a one and
[00:34:07] a half and if you ever ever want to go
[00:34:09] with double Masters that is a two
[00:34:12] point the price of this here would be
[00:34:16] give me one second my
[00:34:19] [Music]
[00:34:22] buddy 72 for those three
[00:34:28] and let me put that up
[00:34:29] there I'll put that up there anyways if
[00:34:32] you want
[00:34:33] it so you'd start with three and a half
[00:34:35] points here yeah starting half with
[00:34:38] three and a half points on this one
[00:34:39] because a l of the Rings I'm going to
[00:34:41] consider that half a point because
[00:34:42] that's a high price one that's a high
[00:34:44] price pack there I'm GNA consider I
[00:34:46] always consider a double master as two
[00:34:47] points because it's my highest price
[00:34:49] pack so with that being pretty close I'm
[00:34:51] gonna go with that one being one and a
[00:34:53] half
[00:34:54] points that is definitely a solid start
[00:34:56] there starting yourself with three and a
[00:34:58] half points on the
[00:34:59] adventure maybe go off are you going to
[00:35:02] be able to beat any of our buddies here
[00:35:05] a little Merryweather are you gonna beat
[00:35:07] our own Grady we don't know we don't
[00:35:11] know but that would be a start like that
[00:35:13] give you three and a half points that
[00:35:16] way say if you wanted to go with like a
[00:35:19] of rings and a uh you know like a
[00:35:23] mystery and another set booster that
[00:35:27] would give you three points you know
[00:35:28] what I
[00:35:29] mean yeah so say you wanted to do this
[00:35:32] say you wanted to do this all right say
[00:35:33] you wanted to go like this you know I
[00:35:34] don't want to spend so much there I I
[00:35:36] want to go a little bit here I want to
[00:35:39] only do a little bit here you want to do
[00:35:41] something like this all right we're
[00:35:43] going to drop it down so we're not doing
[00:35:45] as high with all the other ones
[00:35:47] there did I just do that I just did that
[00:35:50] same
[00:35:53] thing yes yes so let's do it like this
[00:35:56] with with a with that instead I did it
[00:35:58] with the collector booster that's what
[00:35:59] it was so say you want to do that all
[00:36:02] right that will be three points right
[00:36:04] there because this is one and a half
[00:36:06] this is one and that's half a
[00:36:10] point all
[00:36:16] right the strongest boss is
[00:36:18] flare and we have I think uh World spine
[00:36:22] are the two stronger but oh wait no I
[00:36:24] forgot we have a we have galta World
[00:36:27] spine and flare are the strongest bosses
[00:36:30] with 12 15 and 10 your lowest bosses
[00:36:34] here now it is possible if somebody
[00:36:38] ended up
[00:36:39] buying multiples of these that you could
[00:36:42] come out where you could
[00:36:44] beat one of our uh one of our other
[00:36:47] characters here I mean it's possible you
[00:36:48] could beat a T-Rex if you came out with
[00:36:51] seven points and you bought like a bunch
[00:36:53] of the a bunch of the those ones there
[00:36:55] or it's possible you could beat an
[00:36:57] incinerator so it kind of does Raise
[00:36:59] Your Potential if you decide to start
[00:37:01] out with six points and you went with
[00:37:03] like three of those or something like
[00:37:04] that so I guess you could beat more
[00:37:07] characters more bosses with the more
[00:37:10] cards the more stronger uh powerups you
[00:37:12] go with I guess you know so let's say
[00:37:14] you're gonna go this year all right I'm
[00:37:15] sorry I got a little Sidetrack let's say
[00:37:17] you're gonna go this
[00:37:20] year this would be $59 to start you out
[00:37:24] with all
[00:37:25] right on this Wasteland Adventure you'd
[00:37:29] pay $59 and you would start with three
[00:37:31] points here to go and try to beat to see
[00:37:34] if you can add on any
[00:37:37] extra strength through your was
[00:37:40] Wasteland adventure to come on and see
[00:37:41] if you can beat your your characters
[00:37:42] here if you're able to beat any of these
[00:37:44] bosses at the end you get yourself
[00:37:47] potentially a free set or a free
[00:37:49] collector and that are these three packs
[00:37:51] right there and that would give you
[00:37:52] three points to start the game kind of
[00:37:54] three health or three strength whatever
[00:37:56] ever you want to consider it I don't
[00:37:58] know I just say three points because I
[00:37:59] just say plus three plus
[00:38:00] one that's how that would be but we can
[00:38:03] do another one here and I'm going to do
[00:38:05] a low price one that way we can do a a
[00:38:07] low price one here and I'm going to do a
[00:38:10] low price one though we're going to
[00:38:12] start it out with premium ones though
[00:38:15] they're going to be
[00:38:16] premium this is going to be a low price
[00:38:19] premium hit here okay so this is going
[00:38:22] to start you with three points
[00:38:25] also that's going to start you with
[00:38:27] three points
[00:38:32] also and that is only going to be $30
[00:38:35] for those
[00:38:38] three so you want those three
[00:38:41] packs oh that didn't start come
[00:38:44] on you want those three packs here
[00:38:47] you're going to pay $30 you get those
[00:38:49] three packs no matter what you're gonna
[00:38:51] get those three packs but you get a
[00:38:53] chance if you want to play the adventure
[00:38:55] to get
[00:38:57] the chance to beat maybe your
[00:38:59] Velociraptor here are you going to get
[00:39:00] five points and believe beat the
[00:39:03] Velociraptor and get yourself a free
[00:39:05] collector I don't
[00:39:07] know I'll be streaming for a little
[00:39:09] while this morning uh my wife's getting
[00:39:11] ready she's going to drop the dog off
[00:39:12] later and stuff like that so once uh
[00:39:16] once like some that's done I'll be off
[00:39:18] streaming probably I'm guessing like
[00:39:20] 9:30 maybe 10: um like I normally am and
[00:39:24] then that type of thing
[00:39:28] unless for some reason we get really
[00:39:30] really
[00:39:31] busy and if I get really really busy for
[00:39:34] some reason I might hang out for a while
[00:39:39] longer no technically you could if you
[00:39:43] wanted to buy three double Masters you
[00:39:46] could get plus
[00:39:48] six or if you wanted to go with like
[00:39:51] three Lord of the Rings you could be
[00:39:53] plus four and a
[00:39:55] half because it would be one and a half
[00:39:57] each so each one of these is one and a
[00:40:00] half and each one of these are two but
[00:40:02] no one ever goes with them so that's why
[00:40:04] it's you know that's why it's like
[00:40:07] yeah pole boxes oh plus three plus three
[00:40:10] is the most you can get out of the pole
[00:40:11] box that's correct that is correct plus
[00:40:15] three is the most you can get out of out
[00:40:16] of the pole boxes that is
[00:40:19] correct but you could get a minus three
[00:40:21] out of the pole boxes is the worst you
[00:40:23] could get I've seen the best and the
[00:40:25] worst skinny the best you could get last
[00:40:27] night actually he was so close so close
[00:40:31] I actually put the wheel up and
[00:40:32] everything because I was like oh my God
[00:40:34] he's
[00:40:36] close all right we're gonna do another
[00:40:37] deal here now this is only gonna we're
[00:40:39] gonna start you off with two points here
[00:40:41] I'm gonna give you two points to start

[00:45:24] power
[00:45:28] what would do you think what are you
[00:45:29] thinking I should be putting in
[00:45:33] instead I have some other characters I
[00:45:36] can put in think I'm putting in uh
[00:45:38] instead of a 15 putting in like a seven
[00:45:41] that way if somebody went with all
[00:45:44] sixes they have a good chance of beating
[00:45:46] them type
[00:45:50] thing ah something about two all right I
[00:45:53] get what you're saying so put something
[00:45:55] in like a seven that way if somebody
[00:45:57] went with all sixes they could have a
[00:45:59] chance of beating them right type thing
[00:46:02] all right let's do this then here let's
[00:46:04] try this out let's see this well I have
[00:46:06] no problem with that let's do that I'm
[00:46:08] good let's take out let's take out our
[00:46:11] world spine if anybody wants that we're
[00:46:13] g to put World spine over here all right
[00:46:15] we're GNA take out our world spine and
[00:46:17] let me find I think I had a backup here
[00:46:21] I did have a backup before let's do
[00:46:24] this where was my
[00:46:30] backup no that wasn't
[00:46:32] it NOP no that's not it nope that's not
[00:46:37] it NOP NOP no that wasn't
[00:46:41] it where is
[00:46:43] it no no no no no no no no all right
[00:46:51] guess I grabbed the wrong ones all right
[00:46:53] wrong
[00:46:54] handful
[00:46:56] all right we're going to switch this out
[00:46:57] I'm trying to find
[00:47:00] it there we go I think that's where
[00:47:03] where was a
[00:47:05] seven no that wasn't there where was it
[00:47:08] thought I had a seven
[00:47:16] there where's the sevener I swear I had
[00:47:19] a sheven I swear I had a
[00:47:24] sheven give me a second second
[00:47:28] gentlemen give me a second
[00:47:36] gentlemen I swear I had one that was a
[00:47:43] seven ah there it is we'll throw
[00:47:46] dinosaurs on a spaceship in give you a
[00:47:49] chance we got a seven is the boss that's
[00:47:52] in there now so say you decide to go
[00:47:54] with that's that's the one I was looking
[00:47:56] for I knew I had one in here I knew I
[00:47:58] had my seven in there somewhere that was
[00:48:00] my other thought so this is what it'll
[00:48:03] be so that way now as having that seven
[00:48:07] in
[00:48:07] there say you come out where you have
[00:48:11] two unbeatable bosses you could
[00:48:16] theoretically come out and beat
[00:48:19] dinosaurs on a spaceship and
[00:48:22] T-Rex and
[00:48:24] incinerator
[00:48:26] and
[00:48:27] Sauron because there are only six six
[00:48:30] six and
[00:48:32] seven if you decided to go with three
[00:48:34] double Masters starting your character
[00:48:36] off with six
[00:48:37] points so you do have that potential
[00:48:41] there so there you go let me get your
[00:48:43] packs put away here our buddy that had
[00:48:45] these ripped earlier all right so I
[00:48:46] don't mistake any of your stuff with
[00:48:48] anyone else's all right
[00:48:51] KJ and I'm going to put some in the top
[00:48:54] loaders here

[00:49:05] USCG K Johnston and I'm gonna get this
[00:49:09] umari and King Caesar and a top loader
[00:49:14] here because I think those are some good
[00:49:16] ones there hey what do you think about
[00:49:19] that trade that out give you uh give you
[00:49:22] the potential we do it like this if you
[00:49:23] don't want me to I won't but it helps
[00:49:25] with um shipping to keep the the top
[00:49:27] loader

[00:50:01] beat one of the bosses or you going to
[00:50:03] have five points at the end with the
[00:50:05] potential of beating Owen Grady or your
[00:50:09] Velociraptor to get yourself a collector

[00:50:17] see but what I'm going to do next is I'm

[00:55:52] Adventure now what we're going to do
[00:55:55] with our Raceland Adventure if you have

[00:56:01] characters a technician a human just
[00:56:05] like a strong human a detective and a
[00:56:07] mutant if you go and you check actually
[00:56:10] you know what let me do
[00:56:13] this let me see if I can no you know I
[00:56:17] might be a uh the strong human if you
[00:56:20] check the show notes you'll see it there
[00:56:22] and it explains what they are so your
[00:56:24] technician strong detective or mutant
[00:56:25] and then whatever it is depends on your
[00:56:27] character you either get plus one or
[00:56:29] minus one in each of these three boxes
[00:56:32] whether it's food say you're a mutant
[00:56:34] food is good for a mutant you get strong
[00:56:36] you get a treasure out of here the
[00:56:37] mutant doesn't like treasure he throws
[00:56:39] that away you know that type of
[00:56:42] thing if you don't want to play you can
[00:56:44] ask for the normal discount that is
[00:56:46] correct you don't want to play you can
[00:56:48] ask for the normal discount and I will
[00:56:49] give you the normal discount on
[00:56:51] packs so you going to choose choose your
[00:56:54] character and and uh yeah we play we
[00:56:56] play the game see what you want to be
[00:56:57] and take a second if you need a look at
[00:56:58] the show notes and see what you want to
[00:57:00] be for the character because it tells
[00:57:01] you which one gets pluses and minuses
[00:57:03] depending on what it
[00:57:04] is and let me see if I can do something
[00:57:07] like this I wonder if I
[00:57:09] can I wonder if I can I'm gonna have to
[00:57:11] do that for the next shows see when I'm
[00:57:13] in Miami this weekend since I have
[00:57:15] tomorrow I took Friday and Saturday I'm
[00:57:17] not gonna be doing shows because we're
[00:57:19] going to be at the boat show and what
[00:57:20] I'm going to end up doing is I'm going
[00:57:21] to get the animations going for this
[00:57:23] game we're going to have some anim going
[00:57:25] so I'm going to try to have it so like
[00:57:26] whenever you pick a character your
[00:57:28] character pops up out of the screen
[00:57:30] somewhere or like whenever eat something
[00:57:32] or that type of thing so yeah let me
[00:57:34] know what your character you want to go
[00:57:35] with our buddy
[00:57:38] soup did I if I miss something please
[00:57:41] let me know because sometimes I don't
[00:57:43] always get the
[00:57:45] chats mutant all right mutant it is so
[00:57:48] your character starts off with two
[00:57:51] points having a modern Horizon which is
[00:57:53] a premium and then lost Caverns Exelon
[00:57:57] uh set and draft here you start off with
[00:57:59] two points there with your character and
[00:58:01] now what you want to do is there are
[00:58:03] these 10 characters these are your 10
[00:58:05] bosses you want to accumulate enough
[00:58:07] points up to five points or more so that
[00:58:09] you could beat Mary Bossa W Raptor or
[00:58:12] Owen Grady all right those are the three
[00:58:15] that you have the potential of beating
[00:58:16] based on what you started out with so
[00:58:18] what I'm going to do here is we'll
[00:58:19] Shuffle these up at the end but now you
[00:58:22] need to decide out of this box what do
[00:58:23] you want to go with
[00:58:25] I think there's like 70 cards in here 80
[00:58:29] cards in here so you can tell me where
[00:58:31] you want to go and these are food or
[00:58:33] treasure cards so you're looking for a
[00:58:34] food out of here to help the mutant get
[00:58:36] strong on his journey through the
[00:58:39] Wasteland or her journey through the
[00:58:41] Wasteland
[00:58:48] sorry

[00:59:03] mutant find food while he is traveling

[01:08:09] points on your adventure through the

[01:08:17] you and get you
[01:08:20] into top loaders for this because I
[01:08:23] think future site was a decent card if I
[01:08:26] remember oh skinny all right you're
[01:08:29] back hopefully you had a good shower
[01:08:32] feeling nice and clean and
[01:08:40] refreshed so Freddy talked to me and
[01:08:43] convinced me that having three
[01:08:45] unbeatable bosses was a little high so
[01:08:49] what we ended up into doing here was we
[01:08:52] traded out
[01:08:54] green Superman not a bad not bad you got
[01:08:57] yourself three packs
[01:09:00] there three nice packs there three good
[01:09:02] playable packs of cards and we ended up
[01:09:04] switching one out to a seven that way if
[01:09:07] somebody ended up deciding they wanted
[01:09:08] to buy three double Masters to go with
[01:09:11] it they would end up getting the
[01:09:13] potential of beating that number seven
[01:09:22] character
[01:09:24] oh that's all right don't worry do you
[01:09:26] make your you make irresponsible
[01:09:28] decisions I'm I was just letting you
[01:09:29] know because I know you made a comment
[01:09:31] about it and you should be making good
[01:09:33] responsible decisions you're you got to
[01:09:35] make Financial responsible
[01:09:39] decisions but yeah so what we did
[01:09:42] was so what what Freddy decided to tell
[01:09:45] me he said it was a good he said he felt
[01:09:47] it was it was a little rough that were
[01:09:49] there are three unbeatable characters so
[01:09:52] what we did was
[01:09:54] I switched out one of our unbeatable
[01:09:57] characters our one our our spine Worm
[01:10:00] for dinosaurs on a spaceship here giving
[01:10:02] you a seven that way if somebody decided
[01:10:04] they wanted to go with six of the I mean
[01:10:06] three of the double Masters giving them
[01:10:08] six points to start the game off they
[01:10:10] would actually have the potential of
[01:10:12] beating all but two three cards actually
[01:10:17] all but three cards actually I forgot
[01:10:18] World spine was in there actually you
[01:10:20] could potentially beat
[01:10:22] worldspine no you couldn't would tie
[01:10:24] World fine you would just you tie World
[01:10:26] fine
[01:10:28] but anyways you have the potential of
[01:10:31] beating all but two if you decide you
[01:10:34] want to go with the premium top ones so
[01:10:36] that's how that would end up going there
[01:10:38] so that's how we ended up changing up
[01:10:39] giving you a little extra
[01:10:45] chance yes Freddy thank you I do
[01:10:47] appreciate you putting that in the notes
[01:10:49] because if you don't want to play I
[01:10:50] don't mind doing my regular pack deals
[01:10:52] like I do on a regular basis which I
[01:10:53] give everybody you know a pretty good
[01:10:55] discount on them as best I can um I I'm
[01:10:58] doing really good discounts on like
[01:11:00] murders right now so say say you want
[01:11:04] three murders packs and you don't want
[01:11:05] to play the adventure game here say you
[01:11:07] just want three collector boosters of
[01:11:10] murders all right three collector
[01:11:12] boosters are murders right
[01:11:15] now this is a good deal for these
[01:11:19] three if you want three collector
[01:11:21] boosters of murders right now $55 for
[01:11:25] three collector boosters and
[01:11:26] murders now I can't do that in the game
[01:11:29] because that's a really good deal and if
[01:11:30] you happen to win something Astra in
[01:11:32] there it's going to keep it's just a
[01:11:33] really bad really good deal there but I
[01:11:35] can give you a good deal on the packs
[01:11:38] themselves and also if you want we can
[01:11:41] add some we can just do the game regular
[01:11:43] game and this would end up being 60 for
[01:11:45] the three of them but you would have
[01:11:47] three points in our adventure game to
[01:11:51] potentially get your free pack of cards
[01:11:54] so that's how that's the reason why we
[01:11:56] the adventure game was um is a little
[01:11:59] bit a little bit more but it's because
[01:12:02] you can get there's three free there are
[01:12:06] three um actually there's only two left
[01:12:09] now because one was pulled there's only
[01:12:11] two left in this side but there were
[01:12:13] three um play boosters of murar Carlo in
[01:12:20] there let's start you off with a low one
[01:12:24] that has three points all right your
[01:12:27] character is going to start off with
[01:12:28] three
[01:12:31] points all right start your character
[01:12:33] with three points here we're going to go
[01:12:36] with a mystery modern Horizon in a

[02:52:38] enemy that you're going to bump into
[02:52:40] let's find out with our random picks
[02:52:41] here and you know what we did one in the
[02:52:43] front again we're do a front m a front
[02:52:45] dis one again here all right for your

[02:52:53] find oh nice that's nice all right we're
[02:52:57] gonna see you got yourself a clue Clues
[02:53:01] do not help mutants mutants don't know

[02:53:12] only at plus three right now do your
[02:53:14] packs but that is okay you're at plus
[02:53:16] three and you could potentially get up
[02:53:18] to a plus4 here for your strength if you
[02:53:21] find a fungus dinosaur as your friend
[02:53:26] here as a companion as you wander
[02:53:28] through the Wasteland are you GNA find a

[02:53:59] one of your strengths but you know what
[02:54:00] you have two you do have two you do have
[02:54:03] the potential of just bouncing off one
[02:54:05] of our one of our guys here rather than
[02:54:07] just getting stomped on so we're going
[02:54:09] to shuffle up our bosses here we're
[02:54:11] going to see if you were going to have a
[02:54:13] chance of at all beating anyone or if
[02:54:15] you were going to get stomped on no
[02:54:17] matter what because there are there
[02:54:18] would have been only three cards in here
[02:54:20] with your plus four that could have help

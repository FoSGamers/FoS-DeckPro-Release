[00:02:42] and we'll see what happens 25 out of
[00:02:45] each 13 out of both sides 25 out of each
[00:02:49] number 13 out of both sides and then I
[00:02:50] pick the rest all right sounds

[00:08:42] going the audio is not playing through
[00:08:44] it I don't
[00:08:47] think G to move that back off
[00:08:49] now no wrong
[00:08:56] one go away why is it doing the wrong
[00:08:59] one on I was trying to delete
[00:09:03] you anyways that's not working the way I
[00:09:06] wanted that's why I was stopping it kept
[00:09:07] breaking and it not stopping when I
[00:09:09] wanted it
[00:09:12] to I know nothing too fancy but let's
[00:09:14] open your packs
[00:09:16] here do I have a show and tell by any
[00:09:19] chance I was trying to get it to work
[00:09:22] but see that works for me and it was
[00:09:23] working partially and like it goes but
[00:09:26] it won't stop at the time I want it to
[00:09:28] stop and that's what the issue is is it
[00:09:30] will go and it will'll come pop up it
[00:09:32] will pop up too big which I have to
[00:09:33] adjust but I wasn't stopping at the
[00:09:35] right time and it would just keep
[00:09:36] playing so that was my issue but anyways
[00:09:38] let's see what we get here for our
[00:09:39] murders in our our AFR set here let's
[00:09:43] see if we can get you something out of
[00:09:44] these ones maybe we can get you some
[00:09:46] luck here and let me put the music back
[00:09:48] on for the
[00:09:50] background tried it it wasn't working as
[00:09:53] best as I wanted to but hey we tried it
[00:09:55] hey thank you cards for coming in thank
[00:09:57] you M Small hey nice seeing you again I

[00:54:48] happen it'll be in close quarters where
[00:54:49] I need to protect myself
[00:54:51] and the only time I was practiced with a
[00:54:54] knife was when a police T taught me some
[00:54:55] stuff so that was really it so I don't
[00:54:58] really want to have to use anything but
[00:54:59] at the same time I do want to protect

[01:51:59] way I was doing it initially so we did
[01:52:01] readjust it now so there are now you get
[01:52:04] three packs out of here and say you pull
[01:52:05] out this this and this what would happen

[02:09:29] with a knife but at the same time I
[02:09:31] thought it was a better chance of having
[02:09:32] a less of a
[02:09:36] shootout I've been to Miami a few times
[02:09:39] you do need to protect yourself if
[02:09:40] you're not in a large group I will say

[02:09:51] yourself all right we're going to do the

[02:11:54] some guy decided he wanted to chase us
[02:11:57] down in his truck and freak like I don't
[02:12:00] know I don't know what he thought we did
[02:12:02] wrong but uh and the process of chasing
[02:12:04] us down I was pulling a [ __ ] boat
[02:12:06] trailer he's like weaving in front of me
[02:12:08] trying to cut me off and trying to get
[02:12:09] me to sof and I I'm like wait maybe
[02:12:10] there's something wrong with my trailer
[02:12:12] so I slowed down and had him uh and I
[02:12:15] went up next to I'm like maybe there's
[02:12:16] something wrong with my trailer I'm not
[02:12:17] paying attention to like maybe he's
[02:12:18] trying to help and no he goes you got
[02:12:21] close to my [ __ ] truck I'mma [ __ ]

[02:12:26] was like call the cops I had my wife
[02:12:28] call the cops cops are on the phone as
[02:12:30] he's yelling at me and literally quarter
[02:12:33] a mile up the road you could see lights
[02:12:35] because there was like accident this guy
[02:12:37] peeled across the median across the
[02:12:39] grass to get on the other side of the
[02:12:41] road and go away and I ended up going to
[02:12:42] the police officer I'm like dude um I
[02:12:45] have a gun and I was this close to
[02:12:47] shooting shooting someone you may want

[02:14:48] get the [ __ ] out of this
[02:14:50] place um if people are like that yes I
[02:14:52] know there was one day I showed up and
[02:14:55] driving home like what the [ __ ] is going
[02:14:56] on why are there's like there's like six
[02:14:58] cop cars a SWAT truck and [ __ ] um
[02:15:03] they're all with like automatic rifles
[02:15:07] standing out front of this [ __ ]
[02:15:08] little tiny [ __ ] home home I'm like what
[02:15:11] the hell is going on dude exactly and
[02:15:14] that is the point in time where I
[02:15:16] actually got my concealed carry in in
[02:15:18] New Hampshire cuz like I'm not if
[02:15:20] there's a dude that's going to be around
[02:15:21] that's going to willing to do that and I
[02:15:24] I'm done I cannot protect you guys
[02:15:27] without having something to protect
[02:15:29] myself and you guys with and I I mean I
[02:15:31] I learned how to fire because I I um I
[02:15:33] was a lifeguard so I was at the police
[02:15:36] department all the time growing up um
[02:15:38] and they taught me how to fire so I know
[02:15:40] what I'm doing with the guns it's just I
[02:15:42] I just not I don't want to use them
[02:15:44] which is literally the reason why one of
[02:15:45] the reasons why we're going to look for
[02:15:46] a sailboat at the Miami boat show next
[02:15:50] weekend because we're gonna buy a we're
[02:15:53] looking to buy a catamaran with the
[02:15:54] money I get from um the company that I
[02:15:56] had that uh the the the startup company
[02:15:59] that I had stalk in and um just [ __ ]
[02:16:02] leave let this world go to [ __ ] we're
[02:16:04] gonna
[02:16:07] leave you guys want to blow yourselves
[02:16:09] up you want to shoot yourself go right
[02:16:11] ahead I'm
[02:16:13] out but yeah dude like that stuff is
[02:16:16] what throws me off
[02:16:19] all right we're going to do a deal here
[02:16:21] let's do this let's do the Big Blue Book
[02:16:23] right now there are I think there are 20
[02:16:26] spots that are
[02:16:28] um that
[02:16:30] are collector boosters have murderer
[02:16:32] Carlo
[02:16:33] Manor and then you get
[02:16:36] five five red
[02:16:39] buttons I don't want to have to use it I
[02:16:41] spent a lot of money to have it to hope
[02:16:43] not to use it literally that's what it
[02:16:46] is you spend a lot of money to practice
[02:16:49] to learn how to never use it to get
[02:16:51] yourself out of the situations that you
[02:16:53] would need to use it which is literally
[02:16:54] why I brought the knife instead of
[02:16:56] bringing my gun because I'm like if I'm
[02:16:58] I have the of the gun I'm gonna I might
[02:17:00] put myself in a situation where I'm like
[02:17:01] I'm gonna take care of this no just get
[02:17:02] the [ __ ] out of there I got my wife with
[02:17:04] me if it was me by myself maybe but if
[02:17:08] with family there no this is a protect
[02:17:10] myself and get the hell out of here
[02:17:12] that's what those situations are at
[02:17:15] least for me for me that's how I take
[02:17:17] that
[02:17:22] better to be a warrior in a garden than
[02:17:24] a garden more yeah than a garden and a
[02:17:26] warrior exactly exactly
[02:17:29] Primo um like my wife long story short
[02:17:35] here oh we're gonna go with it we like
[02:17:38] it long story short here um I was on the
[02:17:40] wrestling team when I was uh younger in
[02:17:43] high school and lucky luckily enough my
[02:17:46] coach was an Olympian and he taught us
[02:17:48] extremely well I um I actually ended up
[02:17:52] placing in States I was third in the
[02:17:54] state in my weight class so I have a and
[02:17:56] I also went on and I fought in MMA for a
[02:17:59] little
[02:18:01] while so um I have a little bit of skill
[02:18:05] there and I've been in
[02:18:06] situations where um in college where I
[02:18:09] had to use
[02:18:10] that ran a couple people through doors
[02:18:13] yeah I can handle myself I don't want to
[02:18:15] though and that's the thing and then one
[02:18:17] one time I had handled myself and put it
[02:18:19] this way I was young enough that we
[02:18:21] ended up leaving and
[02:18:23] running yes I have a specific skill set
[02:18:26] you want me to how many times you want
[02:18:28] me to spin by the way but we I was at a
[02:18:30] club in in Boston and we came out of the
[02:18:33] club two three of us and my whole
[02:18:35] wrestling team was there and um when we
[02:18:39] came out of the club these five guys
[02:18:42] tried to jump us the three of us well he
[02:18:45] they did not know 8
[02:18:48] last card number 81 they did not know
[02:18:51] that my wrestling team was there which
[02:18:52] was 15 other people or 14 other people L
[02:18:56] needless to say um they got their asses
[02:18:58] kicked but they also um one of them I
[02:19:03] snapped on and I kind of blacked out and
[02:19:06] when we were driving away an ambulance
[02:19:08] showed up so I don't know what happens
[02:19:10] and that's why I don't like to fight and
[02:19:12] that's why I get myself out of those
[02:19:13] situations rather than putting myself in
[02:19:15] them it's one of those you need to if
[02:19:17] you're going to be safe you might as

[02:44:27] hey keep all of certain ones there's a
[02:44:30] bunch of Disney ones and I keep those
[02:44:31] but throw out these other ones because
[02:44:34] they're probably not gonna be worth
[02:44:35] anything she ended up throwing out the
[02:44:37] entire box of VHS instead of the ones
[02:44:39] that I told her to and like there were
[02:44:41] some Disney ones in there that
[02:44:43] supposedly right now were worth like
[02:44:45] like 10 to 15 grand if you had it
[02:44:47] because they were like the special
[02:44:48] edition ones that no one has and I'm
[02:44:50] like
[02:44:51] Mom you you didn't listen to me you did
[02:44:53] you didn't do what I said you did part
[02:44:55] of what I said you threw them out but

[02:48:12] was uh when I was going through to find
[02:48:14] out stuff box I found a few of these I
[02:48:16] didn't realize I had them I like oh
[02:48:17] that's nice pneumonic
[02:48:20] portrayal hey before I forget do you
[02:48:22] have a body research from strick and a
[02:48:26] seismic ascendency from
[02:48:27] El seismic ascendancy I might have from
[02:48:31] LCI but I do not have um body of
[02:48:37] research that I can think of I would
[02:48:39] have to double check I don't have much
[02:48:41] stricks but I would have to double check
[02:48:43] on that um
[02:48:45] I don't think I have that one but I
[02:48:47] might have the other so um send me a
[02:48:49] message for that one so I can make sure
[02:48:51] I get it
[02:48:52] there yeah no I don't have Body Research
[02:48:55] then I do not have Body Research but uh
[02:48:58] seismic seismic ascendancy is that a
[02:49:01] Mythic are you saying because I feel
[02:49:04] like I've seen seismic
[02:49:08] ascendency so here's some of the new
[02:49:10] singles that I pulled out recently if
[02:49:12] you want any of them let me know I'll

[02:49:33] of my stuff but it does sound familiar

[02:51:58] one Holy
[02:52:02] Spirit uh Holy Spirit I don't think I
[02:52:05] have that one H but we rip these packs
[02:52:08] open which everyone has the highest
[02:52:09] amount of value is the one that hits the
[02:52:11] target maybe you get an extra pack maybe
[02:52:14] you get a card May might want to play
[02:52:16] maybe just get a card but that's how we
[02:52:19] go here that is
[02:52:21] the Mystery Pack free carnival game that
[02:52:25] we
[02:52:26] do we thought it was pretty fun the boys
[02:52:29] thought it was a good time that's why we
[02:52:31] invented it was to have fun with the
[02:52:33] boys generally they're here and they do
[02:52:35] it with me and that's why we have sun
[02:52:37] because they pull one out and put it in
[02:52:38] front of the sun there and then we get
[02:52:40] to do a little battle and see who wins
[02:52:42] see who's better is the sun better or
[02:52:44] the father better I don't know I don't
[02:52:49] know I do not have holy spirit that I
[02:52:51] can think of let me double check
[02:52:58] though no there no carard holy
[02:53:06] spirit all right here we go we're going
[02:53:09] to put on I'm gonna put this back since
[02:53:11] we did do the carnival game no one
[02:53:12] jumped in on that which is fine I know
[02:53:14] that's a hard one sometimes for people
[02:53:17] it's a confusing game and that's the
[02:53:20] problem sometimes it's confusing but if
[02:53:21] you see someone play it it ends up being
[02:53:23] really
[02:53:27] fun why is this freezing on me hej

[03:05:53] using it was the one from um it was the
[03:05:56] scene from um Fifth Element where he
[03:05:59] presses the red button because that's
[03:06:00] actually where the red button came from

[03:06:04] like this is not the best deal here this
[03:06:06] is not the greatest game this is a crazy
[03:06:07] game and if it's going to be a crazy

[03:06:15] don't know if you guys remember it let's
[03:06:17] get that quote now real killer when he

[03:07:14] we have pulled out some collector
[03:07:15] boosters and play boosters in here so
[03:07:17] there are play boosters and collector
[03:07:19] boosters in here you
[03:07:23] did need a little animation in there I
[03:07:26] had one that I was going to do that
[03:07:28] scene but every time I did it it kept
[03:07:30] like screwing up my uh stream so I
[03:07:33] didn't I didn't want to screw up the SC
[03:07:34] stream I'm gonna have to play with it
[03:07:36] for the next one and see if we can get
[03:07:37] some good luck for that next one there
[03:07:40] all right hey Paul thanks for coming in
[03:07:42] and hanging out we do a appreciate it
[03:07:44] but you know what I'm going to do next
[03:07:46] I'm going to do this actually we don't
[03:07:48] generally do deals on the mystery box
[03:07:52] mystery packs
[03:07:54] because it's already a really good deal
[03:07:57] here
[03:07:58] but I want to
[03:08:00] play I want to play a game before I head
[03:08:03] out all right I want to play a game
[03:08:05] before I head out so I'm gonna explain
[03:08:06] this game and I'm putting it on for a
[03:08:07] minute here the mystery packs with the
[03:08:09] free carnival game every single time you
[03:08:12] always get your three packs but what
[03:08:14] happens here is you have three boxes all
[03:08:17] right three boxes one is the son one is
[03:08:20] the buyer and one is the father and what
[03:08:23] happens is is out of this right here you
[03:08:25] get three polls you go one two and we'll
[03:08:29] call this one three all right and what
[03:08:31] happens is these all get flipped over in
[03:08:35] front of the box and you get oh an ioria
[03:08:38] booster a play booster of um Murders At
[03:08:42] Carlo and then a LCI draft and Exelon
[03:08:45] draft and what would happen is is we
[03:08:47] would rip open the packs in front of
[03:08:49] these you would get all of these three
[03:08:50] packs every time but whichever one has
[03:08:53] the highest mono value is a dart that
[03:08:54] hits its Target maybe you get a card
[03:08:57] maybe you get a card you want to play
[03:08:59] with maybe you get yourself an extra
[03:09:01] pack who knows but this I always like to
[03:09:05] put him on for sudden death because I'm
[03:09:08] good with the price I put things on at
[03:09:10] I'm good with that my price is fine I'm
[03:09:12] good with that so what I'm going to do
[03:09:13] here for you guys $177 you get three
[03:09:15] packs of cards something like this can
[03:09:18] be pulled out or maybe you pull out one
[03:09:20] of the collector boosters uh that are in
[03:09:22] here there are collector boosters that
[03:09:24] are spread out in here if you look in um
[03:09:26] the mystery box it explains what is in
[03:09:28] there in the details so there we go
[03:09:31] maybe you pull out one of the collector
[03:09:32] boosters and you come out with a
[03:09:34] collector booster like the other day
[03:09:35] someone hit a collector booster and they
[03:09:38] got lucky and hit the buyer box I mean

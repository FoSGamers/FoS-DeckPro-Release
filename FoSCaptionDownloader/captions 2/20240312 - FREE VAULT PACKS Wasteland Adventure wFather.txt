[00:14:59] just a little thank you saying thank you
[00:15:01] for playing but what happens is you get
[00:15:03] points As You Adventure through the game
[00:15:04] here we have Fallout if you would like
[00:15:07] say you want to go with one of the
[00:15:08] Fallout packs just one that's okay you
[00:15:10] can just do the one here and I don't
[00:15:12] care about that that's up to you
[00:15:13] whatever you'd like to do you want to go
[00:15:15] to the one Fallout pack you know what
[00:15:16] I'll do right now we'll do it for this
[00:15:19] here all right that's the one Fallout
[00:15:21] pack that'll get you one strength on the
[00:15:23] adventure you wander through there's
[00:15:26] multiple boxes here to choose from
[00:15:28] there's a red green and a blue side and
[00:15:31] then you have a boss that you go up
[00:15:32] against now what happens would be is if
[00:15:34] you're lucky enough to go through and
[00:15:37] get you enough strength to beat the
[00:15:39] boss we will put up an auction for
[00:15:43] $1 as we spin the loot wheel that the
[00:15:46] boss drops so any of the Wasteland
[00:15:47] adventurers out there he can get it but
[00:15:51] if you lose no matter what you lose or
[00:15:53] you win you always get the Vault pack
[00:15:55] here and currently the front Vault pack
[00:15:57] is what you get they're always around
[00:15:59] the same price nothing extravagant
[00:16:02] they're just little extra saying thank
[00:16:04] you for hanging out with us now
[00:16:09] um Mike jumped in on it we like it here
[00:16:13] thank you very much we're going to play
[00:16:14] that I do appreciate that Mike so we're
[00:16:16] going to do that here that's one
[00:16:17] strength I appreciate that Mike a lot
[00:16:19] Bud thank you very much I'm going to put
[00:16:21] that over here and let me know what you
[00:16:24] want to do here strong human and random
[00:16:26] all the way I like it so Mike's played
[00:16:28] this times he knows how we go here we're
[00:16:30] going to be a strong human as a strong
[00:16:32] human wandering through the Wasteland
[00:16:35] here you look for things like food
[00:16:37] because food is helpful as a strong
[00:16:39] human it helps you get through the
[00:16:40] Wasteland you get strength from that as
[00:16:42] you can see from the top there it tells
[00:16:43] you what it is so we're going to pull
[00:16:44] out a random one
[00:16:46] here come
[00:16:48] on random and let's see what we get oh
[00:16:51] no the human picks up treasure that
[00:16:55] doesn't help them they try to eat it
[00:16:57] they bite that treasure and they oh
[00:16:59] they hurt their tooth oh
[00:17:00] no my
[00:17:03] tooth I've hurt myself and now I'm down
[00:17:06] to zero strength as you wander through
[00:17:08] the Wasteland but you know what that's
[00:17:09] okay you can potentially still it up a
[00:17:11] little higher let's see what happens
[00:17:13] we're going to go through and you said
[00:17:13] random all the way so you're going to do
[00:17:15] this one here there you go that's our
[00:17:17] random one and we get a copy you know
[00:17:20] what I believe for a human I'm not sure
[00:17:23] let me double check on that I can't
[00:17:24] remember them all there's so many for
[00:17:26] human copies are not helpful that is no
[00:17:30] luck for that oh we're sorry Mike you
[00:17:31] did not get luck going through that on
[00:17:33] the Wasteland there you got a you got a
[00:17:35] little little uh knock off there the
[00:17:37] copy comes by he says hey this guy the
[00:17:39] copy thing is I'm going to give you an
[00:17:41] idea let's trip I'm going to take your
[00:17:42] treasure here I'm going to copy that I
[00:17:44] give you something else and he copies
[00:17:46] your treasure and he runs away now you
[00:17:47] have no treasure a hurt tooth and you're
[00:17:50] in the Wasteland with nothing with only
[00:17:52] we're going to say negative one strength
[00:17:54] sadly I don't think there's going to be

[00:18:00] we will be lucky enough to find a boss

[00:18:31] is now grabbing you throwing you around
[00:18:33] the Wasteland but you know what you get
[00:18:35] lucky because you land next to a vault
[00:18:37] after he drags you around the Wasteland
[00:18:39] for a while and as you get near that
[00:18:41] Vault you're getting ready to go in and

[00:47:16] I have a whole
[00:47:18] another four or five boxes of Fallout
[00:47:21] available for all of you now the
[00:47:23] Wasteland Adventure gets you that free
[00:47:25] pack From the Vault there always get you
[00:47:27] that free pack from The Vault so we'll
[00:47:29] put up one of these for uh fallout right
[00:47:31] now and remember you can get what at if
[00:47:33] you want or you can pick the others
[00:47:35] packs that we have available I'm going
[00:47:37] to have to get some more things in here
[00:47:39] sold out of a few things yesterday that
[00:47:40] I wasn't expecting so I'm going to have
[00:47:42] to go and pick some more up actually
[00:47:43] here in the uh not too distant
[00:47:47] future put those ones away here with the
[00:47:50] rest of my Fallout stuff that I have
[00:47:52] over
[00:47:54] here then then we'll uh put that
[00:47:58] away we'll put that
[00:48:00] away what's the Wasteland adventure and
[00:48:03] how does it work all right NAMI so the
[00:48:05] Wasteland Adventure it is just a little
[00:48:07] animated game that we have you at the
[00:48:10] top there if you can't see it I can
[00:48:11] expand it but you would pick one of
[00:48:13] those four characters on your trip to
[00:48:15] the
[00:48:16] Wasteland and what happens is as you
[00:48:19] wander through you pick one of those
[00:48:20] four characters and you you either get
[00:48:23] um our animations for whichever one it
[00:48:26] is and each one of these boxes is a plus
[00:48:28] one or PL minus one you have red green
[00:48:31] and blue for the strength of your
[00:48:33] character and as you wander through the
[00:48:35] Wasteland the goal is to gain enough
[00:48:36] strength to beat the boss at the end of
[00:48:38] your Wasteland Adventure now with having
[00:48:40] only the one strength starting out you
[00:48:42] could only potentially beat um uh three
[00:48:46] of the bosses but if you ended up hey
[00:48:48] say you bought enough packs to have
[00:48:49] three starting out you could actually
[00:48:50] potentially beat five of the bosses and
[00:48:52] what happens is um no matter what you
[00:48:55] always end up going back to a vault and
[00:48:57] finding what is in the vault here it's a
[00:48:59] vault pack it's a free pack saying thank
[00:49:01] you just a little something from like a
[00:49:03] car a pack of cards that could be like
[00:49:05] from the 90s 80 80 late 80s ear 2000s
[00:49:09] just something packed silly that someone
[00:49:11] thought they needed to put in the
[00:49:12] Wasteland uh save in the Wasteland now
[00:49:15] you always get this pack you never lose
[00:49:17] it um and then if you happen to beat the
[00:49:19] boss what happens is is we have a wheel
[00:49:21] that spins to the loot that is dropped
[00:49:24] and then that loot get dropped is puts
[00:49:26] into um is everybody is a $1 auction
[00:49:29] that goes up and anybody in the
[00:49:31] Wasteland all of you have the chance of
[00:49:34] jumping on that and running after it and
[00:49:36] uh and picking that loot up now with
[00:49:38] that being said we uh every time you do
[00:49:40] an Wasteland Adventure the more
[00:49:42] Wasteland Adventures the bigger the uh
[00:49:45] the larger the items in the loot wheel
[00:49:47] that are dropped so right now we have in
[00:49:50] the loot wheel it's uh all it's mainly
[00:49:53] boosters and a um and like one mystery
[00:49:58] booster in there but if you do add more
[00:50:00] we keep adding more into
[00:50:04] it I do have Lord ring special edition
[00:50:07] that is correct I do have some Lord ring
[00:50:10] special
[00:50:11] edition yes so you get to play a little
[00:50:13] game here and have some
[00:50:15] fun that's
[00:50:17] correct I have uh for La the ring
[00:50:20] special edition I have 1 two 3 4 1 two
[00:50:24] five six seven of
[00:50:30] those it's not in the bin
[00:50:33] interesting yes you may buy one I'm not
[00:50:35] sure why it's not in the bin oh it was
[00:50:37] at one point and I think all the things
[00:50:39] getting mixed around I might have missed
[00:50:40] it between shows putting it back in
[00:50:41] there let me put it in there right now
[00:50:44] anyways I'm going to add it in

[00:50:52] that I have um uh you can add it uh you
[00:50:55] want to put one in I'll put it to buy
[00:50:57] now if you want to get it or you can
[00:51:00] um or we can do it with the adventure if
[00:51:02] you would like me to do it with the
[00:51:03] adventure

[00:51:13] right sounds
[00:51:14] good you'll do it with the
[00:51:19] adventure all right let me do that here
[00:51:22] now let me know where you want to go
[00:51:23] here out of those there four on the left
[00:51:25] and three on the right I'm just G to
[00:51:26] take a drink here away from
[00:51:49] everything all righty sorry I need to
[00:51:51] take a drink
[00:51:52] there all right you're excited to see
[00:51:54] this all right now
[00:51:56] it's always fun random all right random
[00:51:58] here we go we're going to do the
[00:52:00] feel we're going to do the
[00:52:03] feel oh I don't know I said sun says
[00:52:07] when it's a tingle it's a good pack
[00:52:09] there a little bit of a tingle there so
[00:52:11] let's see let's see
[00:52:13] here let's see if that's correct
[00:52:16] sometime he says it's a tingle one says
[00:52:19] which is the older one which worries me
[00:52:22] sometimes when he says it's a tingle and
[00:52:23] then the younger one says it is a
[00:52:26] uh it is a um the feel of heat so I have

[00:56:51] flicking you out in a
[00:56:53] way into a burning building you climb
[00:56:56] out of that burning building which is
[00:56:57] right next to the Vault and you get into
[00:57:00] that Vault and in that Vault you go oh

[00:57:31] needed to save something about a
[00:57:33] movie this is a oh we have a Hunger
[00:57:37] Games you're in the Wasteland I think
[00:57:40] this goes with the Wasteland The Hunger
[00:57:41] Games though this is pretty accurate for
[00:57:43] the Wasteland what's going on here
[00:57:45] somebody felt that they needed to save
[00:57:47] this they felt there was going to be
[00:57:48] they had a tingle that this was going to
[00:57:50] be unique and accurate to what's going
[00:57:52] on in the future so they threw that h
[00:57:54] Games movie pack in there to save it you
[00:57:57] want to rip open your packs Mike genuine

[01:00:43] it too until I saw that I literally oh
[01:00:46] shoot I forgot I'm like who's it oh I
[01:00:47] know who that is now but hey there we go
[01:00:50] Mike and remember everybody this a
[01:00:52] random pack just to say thank you for
[01:00:53] playing the game and the reason for it
[01:00:55] is is um the reason why we play the game
[01:00:58] is if somebody beats a
[01:01:00] boss um we do a Loot drop for everybody
[01:01:03] that's here hanging out all right that
[01:01:05] Loot drop is for any Wasteland Adventure
[01:01:07] that happens to be wandering through the
[01:01:09] Wasteland at the time of the loot boot
[01:01:10] drop because that's you guys that are
[01:01:12] hanging out in here now what I'm going
[01:01:15] to do here is I'm going to put up
[01:01:16] another pack does anybody want any
[01:01:18] Fallout pack to go with it I can do that
[01:01:21] I'll throw a Fallout pack up there with
[01:01:23] it and you can tell me what what you
[01:01:24] want but I'll throw that one up right
[01:01:29] now I'm going to put that up here and as
[01:01:31] you see what we do here is once we um
[01:01:35] once
[01:01:36] that gets hit so now we have
[01:01:39] had three adventures in the Wasteland
[01:01:43] with that being said our
[01:01:47] um our wheel for the Wasteland has now
[01:01:51] changed our wheel now has
[01:01:55] added in some a modern Horizon
[01:01:59] 1 and a mystery booster as a potential
[01:02:04] to get and that's what I'm saying guys
[01:02:06] the me the wheel here keeps getting
[01:02:08] updated for added stuff as the adventure
[01:02:12] goes on so there's bigger and bigger
[01:02:15] items that get dropped for the loot now
[01:02:17] I'm going to put this back here and our
[01:02:19] vault pack right here is from um let me
[01:02:22] go here the Vault pack is from 19 94
[01:02:25] there and if you want to see that you
[01:02:27] can so yes exactly the loot keeps
[01:02:30] getting bigger and bigger and bigger as
[01:02:32] the adventure goes so the more
[01:02:35] Adventures we have the more loot we get
[01:02:38] or the B bigger and better loot we
[01:02:41] get so maybe one of these days we'll
[01:02:43] have uh maybe one of these days we'll
[01:02:45] have like 10 adventures and we'll be up
[01:02:46] to like collector boosters in the wheel
[01:02:47] or something like that or 15 you know we
[01:02:49] have 2020 Adventures it's all going to
[01:02:50] be a collector booster wheel instead of
[01:02:52] even sets in there or drafts that's
[01:02:53] going to what going be like when we play
[01:02:55] the adventure game do this here why am I
[01:02:58] even doing that let me get this up here
[01:03:00] for come on now this is just a random
[01:03:03] stuff that I'm putting up
[01:03:05] here now everything in the buy now is
[01:03:08] not completely accurate at the moment
[01:03:10] due to the fact that I uh just need to
[01:03:13] spend some time on it from um having
[01:03:15] some issue having have not been able to
[01:03:17] access it so there we go that's what
[01:03:20] we're going to do there that's going to
[01:03:21] be two strength on the adventure through
[01:03:22] the Wasteland if you want to do it
[01:03:25] that two strength might get you the
[01:03:27] ability to beat a boss maybe you're
[01:03:28] going to be the one that comes out and
[01:03:29] beats Owen then we're going to have that
[01:03:31] $1 wheel spin for you for the Loot
[01:03:35] drop let's find out if you want to now
[01:03:38] you don't need to have these packs you
[01:03:39] can tell me whatever you want my uh buy
[01:03:42] now is rather accurate let me put up my
[01:03:46] um let me put up the um actually I have
[01:03:49] a thing here that
[01:03:50] shows what I have for packs there you go
[01:03:53] that's what I have for packs and that's
[01:03:55] kind of what gives you strength here I
[01:03:57] am out of set of
[01:04:00] LCI so I'm out of a bunch of things let
[01:04:02] me actually adj adjust that quickly

[01:07:00] the more games we play the higher The
[01:07:02] Loot drop for the
[01:07:05] bosses now I'm going to do this a little

[01:07:41] that plays we may end up just doing a
[01:07:43] Loot drop anyways just to see what
[01:07:46] happens but it is up to you guys though
[01:07:49] who plays we need to have somebody play

[01:23:00] wandering through the Wasteland
[01:23:03] here maybe you guys want to do um maybe
[01:23:07] you guys want to go back in time
[01:23:08] yourselves we have 94 is in the vault we
[01:23:12] can go back to 95 with
[01:23:14] homelands you know what we'll just put
[01:23:16] home just put homelands up there we'll
[01:23:18] just put homelands up there we'll put
[01:23:19] our Eternal Masters up maybe after
[01:23:21] that's going to be one strength for your
[01:23:23] adventure through the Wasteland maybe
[01:23:24] somebody wants to do that really go back
[01:23:27] to the '90s
[01:23:36] and really see what happens here
[01:23:39] shockmaster likes
[01:23:41] it go back in time and see what our what
[01:23:44] the world was like at that
[01:23:51] point
[01:23:54] homeand suddenly available sealed well
[01:23:57] what it was um I bought a couple of
[01:23:59] boxes of Home
[01:24:01] lands um I could do that I can
[01:24:04] definitely do icor and a CMM
[01:24:08] set I do not have time spiral I've
[01:24:10] actually been looking for it myself to
[01:24:12] buy some the reason why I have the
[01:24:13] homelands is because um I bought two
[01:24:15] boxes of them to save because I just
[01:24:17] feeling like you know you know a little
[01:24:19] uh want to go back in time cuz I used to
[01:24:21] buy these at the sport
[01:24:22] sports card store Matt Sports Plus I'd
[01:24:25] go over there and buy them on my uh when
[01:24:28] I used to go buy cards so I wanted to
[01:24:30] get some and one of them had a rip and
[01:24:32] was partially open on the side the
[01:24:34] packaging but the box was all sealed and
[01:24:36] everything was fine it just had a little
[01:24:37] rip in the packaging and I was like you
[01:24:38] know what the other one's perfectly
[01:24:40] sealed I think people might want to open
[01:24:42] this and so do I so shockmaster does
[01:24:45] we're this is going to get you one
[01:24:46] strength on your adventure in the
[01:24:47] Wasteland here now your Vault pack I
[01:24:50] always I always option to see it
[01:24:52] everybody's had the option to see it
[01:24:53] since we started the game if you really
[01:24:54] wanted to you can right now it's just a
[01:24:56] little something like I said something
[01:24:58] here but it's from 94 now as you play
[01:25:01] your adventure through the Wasteland
[01:25:02] here our buddy
[01:25:04] shot you have the potential of getting
[01:25:08] anything where you could beat the boss
[01:25:09] now if you beat the boss the boss drops
[01:25:11] loot for every Adventurer in the
[01:25:13] Wasteland to see now that loot that gets
[01:25:15] dropped I'm going to put up your
[01:25:17] characters here I'm sorry I forgot your
[01:25:18] characters that loot that gets dropped
[01:25:21] is going to be right now since we are
[01:25:24] at four Wasteland Adventures we're going
[01:25:28] to now add in
[01:25:32] another item cuz every single time the
[01:25:36] Wasteland Adventure gets run we add in
[01:25:39] another thing to our options so we're
[01:25:42] going to add in a
[01:25:44] Homeland as a potential to be pulled out
[01:25:48] if you happen to beat the boss and they
[01:25:50] drop some loot so now what would you
[01:25:53] like to be here for your character
[01:25:55] though you have that up at the top there
[01:25:58] if you can't see it I can um expand it
[01:26:00] too for you so you can see it if you'd
[01:26:04] like and then we can rip these all open
[01:26:06] and see what
[01:26:07] happens maybe we get some luck here pull
[01:26:11] you out some uh maybe
[01:26:16] leeches shock do I uh do I have you in
[01:26:21] here technician all right it took me a
[01:26:23] minute took you a minute good Perfect
[01:26:25] You're a
[01:26:27] technician here we go you are a
[01:26:29] technician wandering through this
[01:26:31] Wasteland as you wander through this
[01:26:33] Wasteland you look for Treasure cuz
[01:26:35] treasure is what you can use to either
[01:26:37] trade or make into an item you have uh
[01:26:41] 78 cards in red 78 cards in green and
[01:26:44] there's 12 cards in blue you can tell me
[01:26:46] to do random or where you wherever you'd
[01:26:48] like to
[01:26:51] go and we we pick one from each one to
[01:26:54] see what you get for strength random all
[01:26:56] right you're looking for Treasure to
[01:27:00] help you through this Wasteland
[01:27:03] Adventure looks like that one's it there
[01:27:05] all right let's see what we get here
[01:27:08] wonderful the technician has found some
[01:27:10] treasure they take that treasure they
[01:27:13] pick that up and they put it up now they
[01:27:14] are at two strength cuz you know what
[01:27:16] they have something they can trade
[01:27:18] potentially make into an item you know
[01:27:20] that gold they can actually change that
[01:27:21] make that into some of the filaments
[01:27:23] needed for their weapons some of their
[01:27:25] guns that they did not put into the
[01:27:27] Fallout
[01:27:28] game which was literally Fallout ba
[01:27:32] building guns the entire time anyways
[01:27:35] here we
[01:27:36] go we're going to see what we have here
[01:27:39] is a technician going to
[01:27:41] find oh no the technician bumps into a
[01:27:45] sapr rolling the sapping is not helpful
[01:27:49] Tech that sapping comes uses its
[01:27:53] Vines reaches out grabs that treasure
[01:27:55] out of your hands leaving you with one
[01:27:57] strength but you run away though safely
[01:28:00] with your one strength from that sapping
[01:28:04] maybe though maybe though we'll see what
[01:28:06] happens you have an enemy you run into
[01:28:10] oh no oh that's a little off to the side
[01:28:12] there H I have to fix that one hold
[01:28:16] on there you go you run into an enemy
[01:28:19] and they steal your items maybe though
[01:28:22] you'll find somebody that will help you

I need you to search the internet and you all of your knowledge, to help me find a lawyer. I need some help with my employer where I have a manager who has lied to me. Repeatedly harass me and uses multiple intimidation tactics on a regular basis, yet h. R has done nothing about it when I address them for help. He's actually broke company policy when it comes to time off by Having me take time off and increments less than half a day or full day which is what the policy states. I also have different expectations in regards to time management than the rest of my team. We are all salary employees and are able to flex our time as needed, as long as you work hard hours required.
For some reason, I'm not able to do that and I am required to take time off during days, while others are not. Either way, the time off I am being told to take is shorter than half day increments which breaks company policy.
Generally the time I take off is anywhere from an hour and a 1/2 to 2 hours. I need help. Because based on the way a conversation with HR went, they kept trying to tell me. I needed to work on my conflict resolution even though I never had a problem with it. In the first place I was either lied to or I was always told. I'm bad at my job literally words like that. Or I'm under the scope. Yet I have a problem with conflict resolution. Help me find a lawyer that will be any company no matter the size, because this is a big one.

### Understanding Constructive Discharge and Workplace Harassment in Florida

#### Constructive Discharge in Florida
Constructive discharge occurs when an employee resigns due to the employer creating a hostile or intolerable work environment. In Florida, if you can prove that your working conditions were so unbearable that any reasonable person would feel compelled to quit, you may have a case for constructive discharge.

#### Legal Standards for Constructive Discharge
To establish a constructive discharge claim in Florida, you must demonstrate:
1. **Intolerable Working Conditions**: The working conditions were so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in your position would have felt compelled to resign.
2. **Employer Intent**: The employer intended to force you to resign or could have reasonably foreseen that their actions would lead to your resignation.

#### Workplace Harassment
Workplace harassment involves unwelcome behavior based on race, gender, religion, national origin, age, disability, or other protected characteristics. Harassment becomes illegal when:
- Enduring the offensive conduct becomes a condition of continued employment, or
- The conduct is severe or pervasive enough to create a work environment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or abusive.

#### Combining Claims
In Florida, if your employer's actions were severe enough to create a hostile work environment, leading to your resignation, you could combine claims of workplace harassment and constructive discharge.

### Steps to Determine if You Have a Case
1. **Document Everything**: Keep detailed records of incidents, including dates, times, descriptions of the behavior, and any witnesses.
2. **Review Company Policies**: Look at your employer's policies on harassment and leave policies. Any violations can strengthen your case.
3. **Gather Evidence**: Collect emails, messages, performance reviews, and any other documents that support your claims.
4. **Consult Legal Resources**: Florida's state labor laws and federal laws such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act protect employees from harassment and wrongful termination.

### Legal Resources and Next Steps
1. **Florida Commission on Human Relations (FCHR)**: File a complaint with the FCHR if you believe you've been subjected to illegal harassment or forced to resign.
2. **Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)**: You can also file a complaint with the EEOC, which enforces federal laws against workplace discrimination and harassment.

### Example Case Outline
Here’s how you might outline your case:
1. **Background**: Describe your employment, position, and how long you were employed.
2. **Incidents of Harassment**: Detail each incident, including dates, descriptions, and witnesses.
3. **Attempts to Resolve**: Document any attempts you made to resolve the issues internally, such as reporting to HR.
4. **Constructive Discharge**: Explain how the harassment led to your resignation and why any reasonable person would have felt compelled to quit.
5. **Legal Claims**: State the legal grounds for your case, including violations of state and federal laws.

Can I use the Florida law when I live and work remotely in Florida but the business was in new hampshire 

[2024-07-03 05:37:14] ChatGPT:
The question of which state's laws apply to your employment situation can be complex, especially when you live and work remotely in one state (Florida) while the business is located in another state (New Hampshire). Here’s a breakdown of the factors that may influence which state’s laws apply and what steps you can take:

### 1. Employment Contract
- **Choice of Law Provision**: Review your employment contract for any "choice of law" provisions, which specify which state’s laws govern the employment relationship. If the contract specifies New Hampshire law, you might be bound to that unless it contradicts fundamental public policy in Florida.

### 2. Jurisdiction
- **Personal Jurisdiction**: Courts generally look at whether they have jurisdiction over the parties involved. If you were hired by a New Hampshire company but live and work in Florida, both states could potentially claim jurisdiction.
- **Venue**: Determine which court is the appropriate venue for your case. Often, this is where the employer is located or where the employee performed their work.

### 3. State Laws
- **Florida Law**: Florida laws might offer protections if you work within the state. Florida's labor laws and statutes against workplace misconduct could apply because you perform your work there.
- **New Hampshire Law**: Since the company is based in New Hampshire, New Hampshire employment laws might also be applicable.

### 4. Filing Complaints
- **Florida Commission on Human Relations (FCHR)**: You can file a complaint in Florida if you believe Florida’s laws have been violated while you worked remotely in the state.
- **New Hampshire Commission for Human Rights**: You might also consider filing a complaint in New Hampshire if the employer’s actions violate New Hampshire law.

### 5. Federal Laws
- **EEOC**: Regardless of state laws, you can file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for violations of federal employment laws such as discrimination, harassment, or wrongful termination.

### Steps to Take:
1. **Review Your Employment Contract**: Look for any choice of law provisions and understand which state’s laws it specifies.
2. **Consult with a Lawyer**: Given the complexity of jurisdictional issues, it’s advisable to consult with an employment lawyer who can help navigate both Florida and New Hampshire laws.
3. **Gather Evidence**: Document all instances of misconduct, communications, and attempts to resolve the issue.
4. **File Complaints**: Depending on the advice of your lawyer, file complaints with relevant state and federal agencies.

### Conclusion
You may potentially use Florida law if you live and work remotely in Florida, even if the business is in New Hampshire. However, understanding and navigating the jurisdictional complexities requires careful analysis of your employment contract and applicable state and federal laws. Consulting with an employment lawyer who understands both Florida and New Hampshire employment law will provide you with the best course of action.

### 8. Updated Resignation Letter with Specific Effective Time

```

##### Salutation
```
Dear [Director's Name],
```

##### Body
```
I am writing to formally resign from my position at ABC Corporation, effective at the end of the business day today.

I have come to this decision due to a significant breach of my personal privacy. It has come to my attention that someone within the company has looked into my personal life, which was never mentioned in a professional capacity. This invasion of privacy has made me feel unsafe at work, especially considering that I have not violated any company policies to my understanding or to the understanding of the person I spoke with.

Furthermore, this incident has exacerbated ongoing issues, extending the sense of unsafety into my personal life. I believe no employee should have to feel uncomfortable or threatened by such actions. As a result, I no longer feel safe working here and am concerned about potential retaliation that might affect my personal life further.

I have truly enjoyed working with my team over the past three years. The collaboration and support within the team have been remarkable, and I have valued the experiences and relationships I have built. However, the recent changes and the behavior of certain individuals have severely impacted my ability to continue in my role.

Given these circumstances, I cannot continue my employment at ABC Corporation. I prioritize my safety and well-being, and thus, I am choosing to leave the company. I hope that in the future, there will be an opportunity for me to return to a working environment similar to what I experienced before these issues arose.

Thank you for the opportunities I have had during my time here. I hope that the company addresses this serious issue to prevent similar situations from occurring in the future.

Sincerely,

Jamey Doe

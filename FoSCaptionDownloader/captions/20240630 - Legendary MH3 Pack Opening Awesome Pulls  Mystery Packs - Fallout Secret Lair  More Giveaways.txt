[02:16:21] blls over the 12y olds like [ __ ] runs
[02:16:24] through them like they're nothing and
[02:16:28] pretty much did the same thing one of
[02:16:29] the other kids and he got in trouble I'm
[02:16:31] like ah no we're done we're done we're
[02:16:33] not doing
[02:16:34] that if you're going to have somebody
[02:16:36] giving you bullying you and you can't
[02:16:37] defend yourself I'm not dealing with
[02:16:39] that [ __ ] anymore that's the way our
[02:16:41] country is turned
[02:16:43] into all
[02:16:48] right yeah
[02:16:51] toddler is Young it's hard with the
[02:16:52] toddler now are we open these are we
[02:16:54] open these I just want to double check
[02:16:55] I'm sorry or
[02:16:59] water yeah well my old all right but
[02:17:02] he's like a he doesn't really care about
[02:17:05] people as much as the youngest will get
[02:17:07] a little frustrated with [ __ ] he's more
[02:17:09] sensitive the oldest is like I F [ __ ]
[02:17:11] off dude I don't care kind of like I am
[02:17:13] like okay have fun with that one and
[02:17:16] walks away

[02:17:23] we
[02:17:24] rip here we go let's get you some good
[02:17:27] luck and then we'll play the game and
[02:17:28] see what
[02:17:31] happens yeah so it's just Remy much my
[02:17:33] youngest is a little more sensitive with
[02:17:34] that
[02:17:35] so three four five six seven eight and
[02:17:39] when he did defend himself he got in
[02:17:41] trouble kind of talk said something to
[02:17:43] school like are you are you serious like
[02:17:45] what's he supposed to do like are you
[02:17:48] going to do something about it because
[02:17:50] if you're not going to do something
[02:17:51] about it I'm going to let my kid break
[02:17:52] his [ __ ] nose the next time he does
[02:17:54] something pretty easy when somebody
[02:17:57] swipes his glasses off his face that's
[02:17:59] more than just a goddamn bully and give
[02:18:01] him a hard time he has the right at that
[02:18:03] point to defend himself because he has
[02:18:05] been touched and my kid will defend
[02:18:08] himself to the point that that one will
[02:18:09] be unconscious so you have choices I
[02:18:12] taught him I was third in the state
[02:18:14] wrestling I know a little bit about what
[02:18:16] I need to do with
[02:18:18] fighting yes it enables bullies exactly
[02:18:21] it enables bullies I'm sorry I'm getting
[02:18:23] sidetracked F fall strike conduit Goblin

[02:18:48] nice foil Cath mcain meus too m3c 6 with
[02:18:54] a forest and uh yeah your throwaway one
[02:18:57] there hey but when don't you get a
[02:18:59] chance um we we'll have to have to meet
[02:19:02] up you at some point since we do this
[02:19:04] check uh we can check you out if we're
[02:19:06] over like I said we're going even check
[02:19:07] out a boat and and sing augusty at some
[02:19:09] point so that's pretty cool
[02:19:17] ice yes exactly selfdefense to stop the
[02:19:20] ball
[02:19:21] but
[02:19:23] whatever whatever so instead of dealing
[02:19:26] with it and the fact that if my child
[02:19:29] does something to protect himself he'll
[02:19:30] get in trouble where um and he's like
[02:19:32] you know what he doesn't he doesn't even
[02:19:33] want to be there because of this crap
[02:19:35] that he keeps dealing with and he's
[02:19:37] getting in trouble for it so we've
[02:19:38] already we were going to plan on doing
[02:19:40] this in a couple years maybe two or
[02:19:41] three years but instead we just moved up
[02:19:43] a little bit we were thinking with my
[02:19:44] old this was kind of going to high
[02:19:45] school because he was interested in
[02:19:46] doing it he wanted to do it and that way
[02:19:47] he would be able to do scuba diving a
[02:19:49] little bit more it's not as
[02:19:51] not as
[02:19:52] uh responsible as we'd like to be able
[02:19:54] to do scuba diving since he's 10 he
[02:19:56] could do a scuba diving since a
[02:19:57] 10-year-old but he's not as responsible
[02:19:59] as we trust but he know maybe he'll
[02:20:02] treat maybe he'll show us something
[02:20:09] wrong yes Caribbean for a little while
[02:20:12] Caribbean for the first like probably
[02:20:14] three 3 to 5 years and then we'll
[02:20:16] circumnavigate my goal as a child when I
[02:20:19] grew up I one of thing I saw a movie we
[02:20:20] called
[02:20:22] um what was the name of it
[02:20:24] um white squall I know it's not like
[02:20:27] that's the best movie to think of but
[02:20:28] that was a I ever since then I've wanted
[02:20:30] to go and sail and sail around the world
[02:20:32] and like then you know mellin and stuff
[02:20:34] like
[02:20:35] that let oh for order I already got you
[02:20:37] written down on a bag
[02:20:44] here I already got you written down for
[02:20:48] water so yeah that's the plan at least
[02:20:51] for us and one of the boats that we're
[02:20:53] looking at will'll be all of them we're
[02:20:54] looking at so far I'll be able to do
[02:20:56] this still on it so I'll be hanging out
[02:20:58] with you guys doing this
[02:20:59] stuff
[02:21:03] still oh you got the same problem with
[02:21:05] school and kids
[02:21:07] yeah yeah well I have we have friends
[02:21:09] and that are that do homeschooling for
[02:21:12] their kids and all like from the all the

[02:21:21] half the kids that are on my other son's
[02:21:23] soccer team which is the travel like
[02:21:24] competitive one are homeschooled so like
[02:21:27] when you're talking to them and you're
[02:21:28] seeing some of the kids and versus how
[02:21:29] they talk and the things they handle
[02:21:30] like my son they wouldn't move him up
[02:21:32] but he's got sixth grade level math and
[02:21:36] science uh but because his reading was
[02:21:39] at his his level they wouldn't move him

[02:21:42] holding this kid back

[03:30:37] about it that's really what it boils
[03:30:39] down to is I don't say anything about it
[03:30:40] because that's not my um not for me they
[03:30:43] want to do that that's what their choice
[03:30:44] is
[03:30:47] the people that buight you know that's
[03:30:49] why I do things the way I like to do
[03:30:50] them which is more of a you get a lot
[03:30:52] more options and it's not like a j giant
[03:30:54] high with a significant low type thing

[03:35:19] well
[03:35:21] this oh aim for the center all right
[03:35:24] we're aim for Center we're going to use
[03:35:25] our critical hit from the sound of it
[03:35:28] you're going to use your critical hit
[03:35:29] you're going to use your assault
[03:35:31] rifle you're aiming for the
[03:35:34] center all right here we go head Center
[03:35:37] or headshot all right we're gonna go for
[03:35:38] the center you said all right let's see
[03:35:40] what we
[03:35:42] do there we go three shots off center
[03:35:45] Mass that was a good job with the
[03:35:46] critical that was a good idea got 37
[03:35:50] damage against
[03:35:51] him now but he does whip out his Vines
[03:35:55] he's quite mad at you he's 150 went down
[03:35:58] to 37 he hits you with 15 you went 140
[03:36:01] down to
[03:36:03] 125 what are you gonna do my friend oh
[03:36:05] that was a rough one he was mad he's a
[03:36:07] big bad he's got some strength here but
[03:36:09] the critical La last only one round but
[03:36:11] if you use the strength the agility or
[03:36:15] the engine in booster it lasts the
[03:36:16] entire encounter with the
[03:36:20] boss so it's your turn what would you
[03:36:23] like to do now my
[03:36:29] friend agility all right agility we use
[03:36:32] that a gig gy
[03:36:35] booster oh God see it came out like that
[03:36:37] when I had it made using the AI and I
[03:36:39] didn't change it because I thought it
[03:36:40] was hilarious that's
[03:36:42] why all right you got the gy booster
[03:36:46] you're now
[03:36:49] faster reposition all right I like it
[03:36:52] you're
[03:36:53] reposition as he comes ring towards you
[03:36:55] reposition you aim for the
[03:36:56] head head shot this time and all right
[03:37:00] you missed with two of them but one of
[03:37:02] them hits him in the head that King weed
[03:37:04] is unhappy that was a 30 hit again that
[03:37:07] brings him down now he's down to
[03:37:11] uh 97 all right he's down 90 all right
[03:37:15] he's at 90 here what are we going to
[03:37:18] do he swings out his Vines he goes to
[03:37:21] hit
[03:37:22] you now you can try to use one of your
[03:37:27] other weapons but if you do you can lose
[03:37:28] it because you can hit it and whack it

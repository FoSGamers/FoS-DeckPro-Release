[00:03:33] what happens is we take call The Biggest
[00:03:35] Loser because we take all the mythics
[00:03:37] and rares and any uncommons or Commons
[00:03:39] that are $3 or more you put them in
[00:03:41] sleeves and we shuffle them up and we

[00:04:06] boil down to really being the high or um
[00:04:09] you either want to get the best cards
[00:04:10] there or you want to you want to lose
[00:04:13] and get nothing so that's why we call it

[00:19:58] see what I could add nice beholders
[00:20:01] paralyzing
[00:20:04] Ray and uh so I was I'm going to add a
[00:20:07] few more things and update
[00:20:12] it yeah I was going to play if it wasn't
[00:20:15] for the
[00:20:16] weather um we uh yeah we had some storms
[00:20:19] here and the second round came through
[00:20:20] we didn't lose power but it flickered a
[00:20:22] couple times so I mean it ended up we
[00:20:25] ended up not losing power which was good
[00:20:27] obviously but just didn't trust it with
[00:20:29] the way the weather was that day with
[00:20:30] the w had it how we had already lost it
[00:20:32] once and luckily all my stuff is on a
[00:20:35] battery backup so like my computer and
[00:20:37] things don't blow but um that doesn't
[00:20:39] mean the internet's on it you know when

[00:20:44] around in the area and I can't do

[00:21:04] there because I don't think I'm going to
[00:21:06] make those ones those ones won't get to
[00:21:08] into the deck but I do
[00:21:09] think I do think I'm going to

[00:21:17] here I already have
[00:21:21] these I already open those ones H let me
[00:21:23] see
[00:21:29] I feel like I did a I did all right I I
[00:21:32] did already open those ones where did I
[00:21:33] put those
[00:21:40] ones that means I'm missing
[00:21:42] placed some of them which is not
[00:21:49] good where did I put them where did I
[00:21:52] put them you say
[00:21:59] NOP that's not
[00:22:06] them nope that's not them where did I
[00:22:09] put them all

[01:06:07] here I swear I had n Year's night blade
[01:06:10] recently so let's see if I can find it
[01:06:28] devoid corruption sha into the
[01:06:30] battlefield your choice a 3 three
[01:06:32] creature with
[01:06:35] flying intriguing that might work too
[01:06:39] might work in yeah it's in modern
[01:06:41] Horizon 3 I know it's in modern Horizon
[01:06:42] 3 that's why I'm looking through these
[01:06:44] I'm like I feel like I've seen it
[01:06:48] recently like in something that I had so
[01:06:51] that's what I'm trying to figure out if
[01:06:52] it is reor uh f profane I know I need
[01:06:56] that
[01:06:57] one brain surge here we go I know put
[01:07:00] that one off the side if I need perilous
[01:07:03] landscape or not t creature minus three
[01:07:06] until wither blue might be able to use
[01:07:08] foring brood scale tune The Narrative no
[01:07:11] molon gatekeeper in
[01:07:15] that I know I use fow profane and brain
[01:07:18] surge is one of the ones that I used or
[01:07:20] was going to think of using wither and
[01:07:23] blue impossibly though
[01:07:31] let me see do this
[01:07:32] here yeah it's in modern Horizon 3 I was
[01:07:35] just trying to figure out where it I had
[01:07:36] it
[01:07:39] last just cutting off that so I have an
[01:07:41] easier space to get
[01:07:48] things all right wether Bloom I don't
[01:07:51] know if I'll use that one I suspect I
[01:07:53] won't but we'll put it in here
[01:07:56] anyways but perilous landscape could be
[01:08:05] used actually powerless landscape
[01:08:07] probably won't be used brain surge
[01:08:10] though on the other hand could be in the
[01:08:12] deck it's a good one to be in there

[01:25:03] scroll
[01:25:06] here trying to figure out how to get to
[01:25:08] scroll and that's what I'm having the
[01:25:09] problem with does anybody know how to do
[01:25:11] that
[01:25:30] all right well figure that out here
[01:25:58] ah it's not going to work nicely all
[01:26:05] right let's do this
[01:26:10] instead me try this
[01:26:17] instead remove
[01:26:19] that going to add this in we're going to
[01:26:22] go
[01:26:26] we here G to call
[01:26:30] this oh no can't do that
[01:26:45] one we go no can't do that either
[01:27:01] where is
[01:27:09] it there we go that will
[01:27:15] work
[01:27:17] okay that'll work
[01:27:25] I think that'll
[01:27:38] work okay we'll make that
[01:27:43] smaller there we go now we're going to
[01:27:45] pull out a different
[01:27:48] card let's see if I can do this now this
[01:27:50] way
[01:28:00] there we go we have life from the
[01:28:02] loom here we go life from the
[01:28:07] loom as a foil
[01:28:10] here for all of you to
[01:28:16] see
[01:28:18] there life from the loom for
[01:28:20] you that is a $14 card
[01:28:28] now this will go as
[01:28:31] um as a uh what do you call it a plain
[01:28:35] white envelope but I'm going to do it as
[01:28:36] 12 instead now plain white envelope
[01:28:38] means it goes in a top loader and it
[01:28:40] goes in one of these and that's why you
[01:28:42] get it for Cheap shipping all right
[01:28:44] there you
[01:28:51] go then what I need to do is
[01:28:55] pull that

[01:40:37] Stein little Act of
[01:40:46] authority yeah we're going to try to
[01:40:48] figure out we were going through some of
[01:40:49] my stuff trying to build the deck that I
[01:40:51] had I wanted to make for um here but
[01:40:53] it's going really slow so I was going to
[01:40:55] do some
[01:40:56] singles but I don't even think that's
[01:40:58] going to matter right now personally so
[01:41:00] I think it's just going to be one of
[01:41:01] those days I'm going to probably stop
[01:41:03] even doing the giveaways but stinks
[01:41:05] because I wanted to get those going to
[01:41:06] keep everybody in here for the um raid
[01:41:08] train but I can't just give away lots of
[01:41:12] money for nothing today so I'm gonna
[01:41:14] have to do some different something a
[01:41:16] little different so active authorities
[01:41:18] out there no one wanted
[01:41:21] that we will do
[01:41:25] [Music]
[01:41:41] [Music]
[01:41:44] um wow well this is going to be one of
[01:41:47] those days that I'm probably going to be
[01:41:48] stuck in a [ __ ] hard spot in Rocking
[01:41:52] hard place here because I'm not going to
[01:41:54] sit on here all all morning doing
[01:41:56] nothing I need to raid into somebody
[01:41:59] later so I don't really know what to do
[01:42:00] at the
[01:42:15] moment we'll find out
[01:42:25] all right yeah not a problem I
[01:42:27] understand

[01:55:28] familiar

[01:55:33] I pulled it out for someone but I don't
[01:55:34] have it
[01:55:36] myself if that makes any
[01:55:40] sense selfless

[01:55:51] the Ring
[01:55:54] let me see about the Mana that one
[01:55:56] sounds really
[01:56:05] familiar why does that sound so much
[01:56:08] familiar I don't have it but it sounds
[01:56:09] Wicked
[01:56:11] familiar like I feel like I've seen it
[01:56:14] before or I I might actually have it
[01:56:17] somewhere I just don't know
[01:56:20] where that's one of those ones like I
[01:56:22] gotta
[01:56:27] find you got your name written down on
[01:56:29] this one actually I don't need to your

[01:56:51] we're going to do
[01:57:00] marar yeah I don't remember I don't
[01:57:03] remember it specifically I'm like I feel
[01:57:06] like I have it

[01:57:43] start that at
[01:57:44] $2 for

[01:58:05] with your other car
[01:58:08] here with your chromatic
[01:58:12] Lantern there you go my friend we like
[01:58:15] to put them two together there because
[01:58:16] it helps with shipping so things don't
[01:58:18] like flop around
[01:58:19] and stuff like that
[01:58:35] let's do something like
[01:58:45] this n n no no nope nope nope not on
[01:58:49] those ones
[01:58:53] I don't think those ones are worth
[01:58:55] anything so that's why those ones are
[01:58:58] there I mean I don't know if anybody
[01:58:59] wants any of these carrier thrw Last
[01:59:02] Breath seeker of the
[01:59:09] way but not too many people want those
[01:59:12] so that's why I
[01:59:14] uh didn't put those out there
[01:59:23] that is not the one that I
[01:59:37] had is this one then I have ah not a big
[01:59:42] one there on
[01:59:49] that not a big one there either
[01:59:57] no I do not have all the attractions for

[02:00:07] were carrier thrall last breath and
[02:00:11] seeker of the
[02:00:16] way zoomed in too

[02:08:46] GI none dying until end of turn oh that
[02:08:49] might be a good one to put out
[02:08:53] for for it actually I'm thinking about
[02:08:56] that one because what is undying let's
[02:08:59] do a little bit of

[02:09:43] bad one to have
[02:09:47] there you handle that one
[02:09:52] it's not a bad one to have there all
[02:09:54] right let's uh let's see throw out a

[02:11:13] have no idea why it would be that much

[02:11:31] that throw that one out there also if
[02:11:33] somebody would like it for a
[02:11:38] dollar what of the
[02:11:41] um of the generous gift I don't know if

[02:12:17] one but it is also the foil one
[02:12:23] I don't know why that would be that like
[02:12:25] that wait a dollar if you'd

[02:25:31] might get in trouble
[02:25:41] but but yes yes I will say I'm I'm uh I
[02:25:45] am similar in that aspect
[02:25:50] well the thing with me is I know what um
[02:25:52] I know what they're worth and people are
[02:25:54] trying to sell them for more than
[02:25:55] they're worth right now just because
[02:25:57] they can't they think they can get it um

[02:26:03] foil taken off $2 here for you if you'd
[02:26:08] like it oh you gotta be kidding it's
[02:26:10] doing it again there for past
[02:26:15] infestation yeah I found a few of them
[02:26:17] and like I'm like ah these are okay but
[02:26:19] not what I want I'm not going to do it I
[02:26:20] can't do
[02:26:28] these all right put that
[02:26:39] there bust out another thousand exactly
[02:26:41] and I'm not going to do it in on on on
[02:26:44] the spot
[02:26:48] instantly if that makes any any
[02:27:03] sense yeah not a big one
[02:27:14] there wow these are outlaws cards are
[02:27:17] worth nothing huh
[02:27:20] path the
[02:27:22] sizzle y those cars are worth not a lot
[02:27:25] of a lot of nothing whole lot of
[02:27:36] nothing that's not a bad one let's check
[02:27:40] that that's probably worth nothing too
[02:28:07] NOP that one's not worth anything either
[02:28:15] wow no that's all
[02:28:18] right that's all right
[02:28:21] Primal might yeah give me a second here
[02:28:25] was right
[02:28:28] here Primal
[02:28:31] might Target creature you control gets
[02:28:33] XX until end of turn then fights up to
[02:28:35] one target creature you don't
[02:28:39] control yeah I know the Assassin's Creed
[02:28:42] cards just bloed plopped out of nowhere
[02:28:45] like they just weren't worth anything at
[02:28:46] all but this is one of those ones that
[02:28:48] it was like a unique set that I don't
[02:28:50] think a lot of people are big on if that
[02:28:53] makes any
[02:29:02] sense but yeah that's the Primal M there
[02:29:05] if you
[02:29:05] [Music]
[02:29:14] need wow yep that's what I figured
[02:29:23] all right Outlaws now I'm getting to the
[02:29:25] other ones that I know aren't worth
[02:29:41] anything I don't know if I want
[02:29:48] that do that
[02:29:54] there you go $3 card coming at you well
[02:29:57] $4 coming at you for
[02:30:08] three-ish oh yeah where you buy to sell

[02:30:13] already bought um I sold a lot of decks
[02:30:15] and everything like that of the packs to
[02:30:17] build back most of this so this a lot of
[02:30:19] this is um like I don't need to sell
[02:30:21] these but I like to sell them to get rid
[02:30:23] of stuff that I'm not using if that
[02:30:24] makes any
[02:30:29] sense do you want the Primal if you want
[02:30:31] the Primal I'll put that up there buddy
[02:30:33] for you give me one
[02:30:39] second there you go if you want that

[02:53:16] fought with a team out of like Maine for
[02:53:19] a little while when I was up in New
[02:53:20] Hampshire they were like right over the
[02:53:21] border from one of the gyms I used to go
[02:53:23] working at working out at and I was like
[02:53:24] I heard him talking about wrestling and
[02:53:26] doing some stuff like MMA and I was like
[02:53:28] Hey mind if I come check out you guys
[02:53:29] and see what you like and um I went over
[02:53:32] and after like the first like kind of
[02:53:34] like practice that we had they were like
[02:53:35] I I I pushed myself like I normally do
[02:53:38] and I end up I threw up I had to go I
[02:53:40] was I had to go step outside and like I
[02:53:41] gota go throw up I'll be right back I
[02:53:43] went back and tell him all I'm good I'm
[02:53:44] like I pushed myself too hard sorry
[02:53:45] about that guys don't worry about it and
[02:53:47] then um the uh the guy that was like the
[02:53:49] the captain or the coach or whatever he
[02:53:51] came outside after when I was cooling
[02:53:53] down at one point hey everybody decided
[02:53:55] they want you to be on the team like I
[02:53:56] I'm like what do you mean I'm like I
[02:53:57] haven't even finished a practice it's
[02:53:58] been like half hour anyway he's like
[02:53:59] yeah but you took down me and almost
[02:54:03] pinned me if you were going to be doing
[02:54:05] wrestling and then you took down the
[02:54:06] other guy that's the best in their legs
[02:54:07] on legs on our team and you just threw
[02:54:09] your legs on them like there's no
[02:54:10] problem so we want you on our team like
[02:54:13] oh all right
[02:54:14] cool and I fought for a little while I
[02:54:17] didn't get hit in the head
[02:54:18] but I also fought
[02:54:22] different um so I mean I don't know for
[02:54:25] me I didn't get hit yet but I she didn't
[02:54:27] want me to get the potential of having
[02:54:28] it
[02:54:29] happen
[02:54:31] so I never did there you go ripples of
[02:54:35] undeath so I stopped because she said
[02:54:43] no it's one of those ones where like I
[02:54:45] was in college and I was called by the
[02:54:46] wrestling coach to wrestle on their
[02:54:49] team and
[02:54:51] um like cuz he found my name I guess
[02:54:54] somehow in the directory and I was I had
[02:54:56] been third in the state and I I was one
[02:54:59] match away from going to Nationals
[02:55:01] pretty much I got placed I was the
[02:55:03] number one and I was like number two and
[02:55:05] the other guy was number one so they put
[02:55:06] us in different
[02:55:08] brackets um and we ended up we we were
[02:55:11] put in the same bracket instead of
[02:55:12] different brackets for some reason so
[02:55:14] when we came into it I wrestled him and
[02:55:16] lost to him again and then he wrestled
[02:55:18] the other person that I would have been
[02:55:19] able to beat and beat that person I was
[02:55:21] like oh I just got screwed by the
[02:55:28] bracket another ripples of undeath going
[02:55:31] out for you
[02:55:34] $2 yeah I wrestled in high school and a
[02:55:37] little bit in college only for a couple
[02:55:39] months really in college because I
[02:55:40] realized I wasn't going to get a
[02:55:41] scholarship from it anyway so I decided
[02:55:45] no point in putting the effort into that
[02:55:46] if I can't get a scholarship
[02:55:55] I haven't been arrested before I've got
[02:55:58] uh I've got in trouble and almost gotten
[02:55:59] arrested but I've never actually been
[02:56:02] arrested my wife was at some point
[02:56:19] there we go cause looks on
[02:56:28] ceiling yeah I know how to stay away
[02:56:29] from stuff and I know how to talk to
[02:56:31] police so I was able to get myself out
[02:56:32] of trouble um I used to lifeguard so I
[02:56:36] learned how to talk to the police over
[02:56:37] time you know be respectful and
[02:56:39] honorable to them and a lot of times I I
[02:56:40] was able to like not get in trouble
[02:56:44] because I was I wasn't like ridic
[02:56:48] ridiculous and started to yell at him I
[02:56:51] was like
[02:56:53] respectful like oh sorry not sure what I
[02:56:55] was doing wrong blah blah you know what
[02:56:56] I mean that type of
[02:56:59] thing
[02:57:01] and if you do that a lot of times you
[02:57:04] end up coming out on top I won't say
[02:57:06] guaranteed but a lot of times you
[02:57:14] do like I can't guarantee it all the
[02:57:16] time for everyone but I'm just saying
[02:57:18] like
[02:57:18] a lot of time for most people you will
[02:57:21] all right that's a $6 card we'll come
[02:57:24] out for five instead of
[02:57:28] six yeah I'm the one that uh I talk my
[02:57:31] way out of stuff like uh like they've
[02:57:33] I've been um we were up camping
[02:57:35] somewhere one time and they were like oh

[03:29:32] break but no one was jumping in on it it
[03:29:34] was uh slow all morning so I just been
[03:29:36] went into this here for a little
[03:29:39] while because I would have stopped by
[03:29:41] now but I said I was going to raid in to
[03:29:42] somebody at noon um so that's the only
[03:29:44] reason I haven't stopped

[03:29:49] of people here to go and do our raid
[03:29:51] over to uh over our friend Mike when

[03:30:00] game with my son so I wasn't going to be
[03:30:03] able to

[03:31:07] I like how everybody's like that's not a
[03:31:11] Shephard there a bunch of people I know
[03:31:13] that like that's not a shepherd
[03:31:16] we have
[03:31:18] another one of
[03:31:21] these but it is like
[03:31:24] this for all of you if You' like it
[03:31:28] there it is add on instead of seven we
[03:31:31] go that
[03:31:50] might want to have that one in the deck
[03:31:52] here not a bad discount on it see I try
[03:31:55] to get people decent discounts on things
[03:31:57] you know ones I'm like I'm not going to
[03:31:58] use that and I like and I know like the
[03:32:01] shipping and stuff like that not always
[03:32:04] greatest for everyone around
[03:32:10] so conversion
[03:32:12] apparatus we put that over there was it
[03:32:21] lazotep we'll put that up
[03:32:25] there there you
[03:32:28] are and run
[03:32:30] that these are just uh some singles from
[03:32:33] Modern Horizon 3 just going
[03:32:36] through and uh you should be able to see
[03:32:38] what their price and everything like
[03:32:39] that is on the bottom there try to make
[03:32:40] it a little bit nicely set up for you
[03:32:42] guys to be able to see them
[03:32:46] oh actually think I don't know let me
[03:32:47] know do you like how I did that is it
[03:32:49] silly
[03:32:54] stupid know let me know your
[03:32:57] thoughts I thought it was worked out
[03:32:59] well since the um the other pricing
[03:33:02] system disappeared at least we can still
[03:33:04] see
[03:33:13] it it's okay not bad not great not the
[03:33:16] best but it's a good
[03:33:24] alternative
[03:33:29] okay I I like the other way better
[03:33:31] because it was a lot
[03:33:35] cleaner
[03:33:37] but you got to do what you got to do
[03:33:39] until we can figure out some other
[03:33:40] things right
[03:33:48] there you go I'll put this out for you
[03:33:51] guys yeah I hope I got to try to get the
[03:33:53] bot thing working up again but that'll
[03:33:55] take some time which I don't
[03:34:03] have oh
[03:34:05] okay I can do some bulk of um five to
[03:34:09] six rares like that um it won't be able
[03:34:11] to go at the cheaper shipping just
[03:34:13] because once you get over a certain
[03:34:14] amount it does uh it doesn't do that but
[03:34:17] um a certain amount of cards it won't
[03:34:19] allow me to but I can do stuff like
[03:34:23] that there are certain ones that you're
[03:34:25] looking for because I can definitely to
[03:34:27] do that too like if say there's a bunch
[03:34:28] of them that you're looking for and be
[03:34:29] like hey can I get those ones that
[03:34:30] you've been
[03:34:31] showing um I don't mind saying putting
[03:34:34] those off putting them in
[03:34:36] there I did not sell the dog no the dog
[03:34:38] was in in there
[03:34:48] yeah not a spectacular
[03:34:50] one the dog is still
[03:34:54] here are there anyone specifically that
[03:34:57] you're looking
[03:35:08] for
[03:35:10] Gamu if I'm saying your name right
[03:35:19] all right so we'll do something like
[03:35:20] this
[03:35:25] okay we'll do
[03:35:47] okay let's do
[03:35:55] this an Lord of the Rings bundle with an
[03:35:57] mh3 collector yes I can tell you that
[03:35:59] one second
[03:36:05] there that's the
[03:36:07] that so here we
[03:36:11] go let me get your math oh
[03:36:15] is my there it

[03:36:20] is I'll tell you one second here
[03:36:47] I got to plug that
[03:36:53] in I'm going to plug that in so it
[03:36:56] doesn't die that would end up being
[03:36:58] instead of
[03:37:01] 135 the 127 giving you pretty much free
[03:37:05] shipping and a little bit off on top of
[03:37:09] it let me know if that's something you
[03:37:11] want to
[03:37:12] do and I can get those set up for you
[03:37:17] with the collector booster and the three
[03:37:19] sets of I mean the seven sets of

[03:42:41] minute for
[03:42:43] those be taken care of
[03:42:46] but we'll see if that uh that ends up
[03:42:49] occurring but
[03:42:51] so until that happens we'll keep going
[03:42:54] through some of these that we had
[03:42:58] here that we were looking
[03:43:11] at oh that was one that was saying to
[03:43:14] use
[03:43:19] that was also one to
[03:43:25] use that was one to
[03:43:34] use none of those ones
[03:43:37] though just look at those oh that's what
[03:43:40] I was doing
[03:43:46] that's what I was
[03:43:51] doing somebody had asked for a stack of
[03:43:53] some so here we go going to do a Kudo a
[03:43:57] white Orchard Kudo Monumental henge
[03:43:59] sunken Palace inversion Behemoth air gas
[03:44:03] ather rolt lazotep and conversion
[03:44:05] apparatus I don't know if you need all
[03:44:07] of those I don't know if those are ones
[03:44:08] that you will need but somebody ask for
[03:44:10] a little bit of a a chunk of them I'll
[03:44:13] do this for one here
[03:44:17] quickly while we wait for the other
[03:44:19] thing to hopefully clear sometimes it
[03:44:21] takes some
[03:44:23] time so we go we'll do this and then
[03:44:28] we'll do it
[03:44:31] as
[03:44:38] nope here we go because there's more
[03:44:41] than uh one there we'll have to do it
[03:44:43] that way but there
[03:44:46] between all those sure we'll do it that
[03:44:48] way
[03:44:52] confirm there you go for those if you
[03:44:54] want all those right
[03:44:56] there coming out for you now I can't do
[03:44:59] them as the same ways I do the singles
[03:45:01] but that'll get you a little bit of an
[03:45:04] extra there on the uh can't do it the
[03:45:07] same way as I do always on the singles
[03:45:09] just because they're multiple cards
[03:45:10] there too many cards for that that's why
[03:45:12] you have to do it as pack type ones but
[03:45:14] there you go Bob Theon likes it that was
[03:45:16] a good pickup for you Bob
[03:45:18] Theon we get you with your other thing

[03:50:00] and things like that that are around get
[03:50:02] kind of get everybody used to seeing a
[03:50:03] bunch of different
[03:50:05] people kind of what it was my thought
[03:50:07] process my understanding was
[03:50:12] right now if you need one of these let
[03:50:14] me
[03:50:17] know but we do
[03:50:21] have the

[04:03:11] going to put out Fel the profane
[04:03:20] F the
[04:03:24] profane now instead of $6 this will be

[04:30:54] vehicle and nothing happened to anything
[04:30:57] inside of it except for one card had a
[04:31:00] minor dent and it was only a $1 card so
[04:31:03] the person was like I don't even care
[04:31:04] about it but I was like I was overly
[04:31:06] impressed with the fact that none of my
[04:31:07] other cards had anything wrong with it
[04:31:11] like oh sweet
[04:31:13] little orm chant and borderless for
[04:31:30] you oh that's another nice pickup for
[04:31:33] you
[04:31:34] feather that's another P nice pickup for
[04:31:36] your feather the uh the borderless
[04:31:39] treatment's nice on it
[04:31:40] too I like the borderless treatment on
[04:31:47] it there you go
[04:31:50] feather I kept actually the I kept a
[04:31:52] foil one of it because I like the
[04:31:54] borderless treatment so much I was like
[04:31:55] I'll use it at some point there there's
[04:31:56] got to be a reason I can use that
[04:32:05] one oh it's not even not not worth much
[04:32:08] at all but I do have one of those I know
[04:32:11] that you got I have one of those around
[04:32:14] ranching
[04:32:16] Evolution this is not the extended art
[04:32:18] one but I feel like I have the extended
[04:32:20] art one I do have
[04:32:24] it but I do not have this one even
[04:32:27] though you might want this one in
[04:32:32] foil there you go
[04:32:35] foil
[04:32:37] $2 coming at you for the branching
[04:32:39] Evolution and foil
[04:32:50] how is that one
[04:32:59] there oh I want to use that one

[04:33:05] game all
[04:33:07] righty take the branching Evolution put
[04:33:10] that right there
[04:33:12] null Elemental

[04:33:22] that one
[04:33:24] was uh it had been up there it had been
[04:33:26] up there it dropped down going put that
[04:33:28] out over

[04:34:09] look of that card
[04:34:16] nice looking
[04:34:19] card not worth anything though well if
[04:34:23] anybody needs it with something else let
[04:34:25] me know we can put it in with something
[04:34:28] oh I do like this one though

[04:35:41] I I don't use this death touch LifeLink

[04:35:46] among card touch among cards in your
[04:35:49] grave your tough that's equal to that
[04:35:51] number plus

[04:36:35] righty we'll have to put that one then
[04:36:38] top loader too and send that to top
[04:36:40] loader Z

[04:44:29] those let's
[04:44:34] See's see I got some Ravnica here maybe

[04:45:03] uncommons and Commons good good
[04:45:05] good so that helps that
[04:45:09] helps that means I don't have have to go

[04:45:19] not all right let's
[04:45:21] see let's see what we

[04:45:30] lot of these weren't worth anything but
[04:45:32] we'll check it out might as well
[04:45:44] yeah that's what I

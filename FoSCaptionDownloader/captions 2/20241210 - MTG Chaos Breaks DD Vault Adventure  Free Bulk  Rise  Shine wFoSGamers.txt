[00:11:04] mail sucks recently like I actually sent
[00:11:06] something out and one thing we don't
[00:11:08] have no idea what happened to it and I'm
[00:11:09] guessing it just got lost in the [ __ ]
[00:11:11] mail somewhere and I ended up replacing
[00:11:14] the couple cards that the person got and
[00:11:15] it's like I'll figure it out it's just
[00:11:17] if uh just send me a message again on
[00:11:18] that I'm sorry hey hi what's up have a
[00:11:21] good bye love you to have a good day
[00:11:25] school yeah [ __ ] happens with the mail
[00:11:27] every now and again and like I drop
[00:11:28] stuff off they have like a box next they
[00:11:30] have this um pretty much there's the
[00:11:31] counter and every time I go up there I
[00:11:33] have like you
[00:11:33] know anyways from 20 to 100 packages and
[00:11:37] I drop them all off the counter um and
[00:11:39] the guy just pours them in a box like I
[00:11:41] dropped off the counter next to the guy
[00:11:43] and he has it Pour Me In The Box so he
[00:11:44] sees me do it all it's just I guess
[00:11:46] every now and again sometimes they go
[00:11:47] when you go through like a thousand plus
[00:11:49] in a week every now and again M might go
[00:11:51] missing I'm not trying to say that it's
[00:11:54] a purpose but you know what I mean you
[00:11:55] get what I mean [ __ ] happens I'm trying
[00:11:57] to make sure I'll fix it though is what
[00:11:58] I'm getting
[00:12:00] that I've run into it myself where I've
[00:12:03] had stuff shipped and I actually didn't
[00:12:05] get it either and people had to do the
[00:12:07] same thing was either had to refund or
[00:12:09] send me another
[00:12:12] one so if you want I can send you a
[00:12:14] whole one completely um sealed too I
[00:12:17] have another one of those sealed
[00:12:24] ones anyways let's go into the next pack
[00:12:26] of what we get
[00:12:30] we're going to go on to
[00:12:32] Nolan's hate the mail recently it's been
[00:12:34] a pain in the
[00:12:37] ass but they also partially I think I
[00:12:40] wonder if it's my fault though with some
[00:12:41] of that stuff because recently I when we
[00:12:42] moved I had some stuff delivered to
[00:12:44] actually not not my fault I'm might i'
[00:12:46] say more the old House's fault cuz when
[00:12:49] we moved I have my stuff being delivered
[00:12:51] from my old house that I lived at to my
[00:12:54] PO Box one two three four five six 78
[00:13:00] and I've had some random stuff go to my
[00:13:01] old house for some reason so I wonder if
[00:13:04] there's random things there CU that
[00:13:05] happened the other time and one of our
[00:13:07] buddies mic stuff was there and I was
[00:13:08] like [ __ ] I had to go like it was like
[00:13:11] almost two weeks to three weeks later
[00:13:12] somebody called me like happened to be a
[00:13:14] neighbor like hey the old your old the
[00:13:16] new owners dropped off like a month's
[00:13:18] worth of
[00:13:19] mail uh I guess they hadn't been living
[00:13:21] here and all your mail was coming their
[00:13:23] house and there was handfuls of it I'm
[00:13:25] like you [ __ ] me there's a bunch of
[00:13:26] packages missing I [ __ ] hate that
[00:13:28] stuff like like you send it the right
[00:13:31] location come on but send it the right
[00:13:33] location tunnel surveyor frantic

[00:13:55] final Vengeance foil and an insect well
[00:13:58] that was Nan's one on that side and it
[00:14:01] sucks
[00:14:03] for shipping and it's going to get worse
[00:14:05] for the holidays and that's the only
[00:14:07] thing that sucks even more is the
[00:14:08] holidays end up being freaking worse
[00:14:11] which is
[00:14:12] why luckily I'm not going to have stuff
[00:14:14] shipped directly during the holiday this
[00:14:16] time I don't think oh I don't think so

[01:07:08] of it's directly behind me this
[01:07:16] side we got

[01:07:23] one we have all these these for our

[01:07:54] know lucky number 13 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
[01:08:01] 10 11 12 13 I like all you people a lot
[01:08:04] of you do um lucky number 13 and I have
[01:08:07] to say is one of my favorite
[01:08:09] numbers because historically that is a
[01:08:13] good lucky number back in time until uh
[01:08:15] I think it was like Christianity made it
[01:08:16] unlucky for some reason I don't remember
[01:08:18] exactly why I think it had something to
[01:08:20] do with like the um like the Roman
[01:08:22] Empire and that was a lucky number for
[01:08:24] them and they wanted to like distance
[01:08:25] himself from it or something along that
[01:08:27] lines I can't remember exactly what it
[01:08:28] was but it became something like oh this
[01:08:31] is an unlucky number now all of a sudden
[01:08:33] and it's not really an unlucky
[01:08:35] number a lot of um I think it would had
[01:08:38] something to do like a lot of religions
[01:08:39] had it as a lucky number and they didn't
[01:08:41] want to have themselves associated with
[01:08:42] it yes we'll rip them
[01:08:45] awesome zombie Master oh I don't know I
[01:08:48] can take a look quickly let's take a
[01:08:50] look at that
[01:08:51] quickly zombie master we're going to

[01:09:18] do oh look at
[01:09:22] that I have one I have a zombie master I
[01:09:25] just have to double check that it's not
[01:09:26] in The Brak so I can remove it if it is
[01:09:29] but I don't think it is in The Brak
[01:09:32] today or any of the things
[01:09:39] here all
[01:09:46] right
[01:09:48] okay it is in one but I'll remove that

[01:16:15] here I normally do a big cup of coffee
[01:16:18] and these ones are small so I can't I'm
[01:16:19] like I feel like I need an
[01:16:23] extra like I have one of the like the
[01:16:25] biggest cffs you can make out of the
[01:16:26] machine and I can only make a half siiz
[01:16:28] one like oh no this isn't good yeah but
[01:16:31] how the brake works is if that makes
[01:16:34] sense for you um black camera that's how
[01:16:36] it works so what I do is I take the
[01:16:39] Ghostbuster Slimer we open this up since
[01:16:41] there's six cards in here I shuffle
[01:16:43] those up and I hand them out based on
[01:16:45] the spot with your name written on it so
[01:16:47] I Write Your Name On Spot go to spot one
[01:16:49] the next one I shuffle and hand it out
[01:16:50] that way then then I take all the
[01:16:53] mythics all the Commons I mean mythics
[01:16:56] and the rares and any uncommon or common
[01:16:58] that is over $3 I put it in sleeves and
[01:17:00] Shuffle Up and hand them out and then
[01:17:02] all the commons and uncommons I hand out
[01:17:04] um later before we ship things out and
[01:17:06] that's how we're going to go with that
[01:17:07] one and BOGO give me a number between
[01:17:09] one and 10 then we're going to open up
[01:17:10] this uh Commander Legends
[01:17:13] pack one two three is murder of crows
[01:17:17] let's see where the rare was the trill
[01:17:21] was oh times two three times two was it
[01:17:25] all right let's uh run instead of
[01:17:27] running this if we'll pin this here and
[01:17:30] I'm going to run one of the other things
[01:17:32] maybe somebody wants to participate in
[01:17:33] the adventure themselves and just try to
[01:17:35] uh try to get some weapons for their
[01:17:37] character and also with that maybe go
[01:17:40] random Marvel cards or some other
[01:17:41] singles that are there let me put you
[01:17:44] over here with your name on
[01:17:47] it
[01:17:50] boo thought I had your name right now
[01:17:57] yep I
[01:17:58] do there you go my
[01:18:01] friend here we are now we're going to
[01:18:03] open up this and see what we get Kel's
[01:18:05] going to try for the singles and see
[01:18:07] where we go for that random one the
[01:18:09] Jolly balloon man I'll get you that one
[01:18:11] in a second here my friend and open take
[01:18:13] a crack of this and we'll get you that
[01:18:16] Jolly Balloon Man out
[01:18:19] um right now
[01:18:46] okay why is something upside down
[01:18:48] seriously
[01:19:05] the hell was that upside down
[01:19:11] for well look at that why don't I have
[01:19:13] that in there I swear I
[01:19:17] did well it looks
[01:19:19] like I'm guessing my shit's mixed up
[01:19:22] somewhere in another area
[01:19:25] because I thought I had a lot more JS
[01:19:27] than I did but I'm wondering if I put
[01:19:29] them together in another spot like a
[01:19:31] dumbass every now again I do that but
[01:19:34] that will benefit you because if I don't
[01:19:37] have a jolly balloon man which I thought
[01:19:38] I had you're going to get a chance to
[01:19:40] run again
[01:19:43] there and I'm just going to double check
[01:19:45] to make sure I wasn't stupid and put
[01:19:47] them in another area so I do that
[01:19:51] sometimes it looks like I wasn't it
[01:19:53] looks like you
[01:19:55] are going to
[01:19:57] go and have a chance again which is now
[01:20:00] there you go calby we randomize again
[01:20:02] and I have to get rid of the Jolly
[01:20:03] balloon man I don't know why it's not

[01:33:41] [ __ ] it's annoying as [ __ ] but let me
[01:33:44] um let me run it again there
[01:33:51] anyways yeah let me get a let me see if
[01:33:54] I can get the um thing corrected here
[01:33:56] I'm sorry about that that's a pain in
[01:33:59] the butt I hate how that does that it's
[01:34:02] every time it says I have it put in at a
[01:34:04] certain price and it runs it at the last
[01:34:05] price that was done even though it was
[01:34:06] put in at another
[01:34:08] one so let me take care of that here and
[01:34:10] I I'm let me straighten that out and I
[01:34:12] will put it back
[01:34:13] in it's uh for whatever reason it does
[01:34:16] that and I'm going to have to add that
[01:34:17] back in there though spot
[01:34:21] number that was spot number um
[01:34:26] uh let me get
[01:34:28] that spot
[01:34:31] three pain in the
[01:34:37] butt SP three and that was uh what was
[01:34:40] that one
[01:34:45] [Music]
[01:34:56] let's see what that is here give me one
[01:34:57] second
[01:35:02] [Music]
[01:35:04] here why is this not opening for me we
[01:35:07] need to get the name down
[01:35:09] right spot
[01:35:15] three God damn it whatever I think it
[01:35:18] was a health was it
[01:35:21] health I think it was a health option
[01:35:26] so we're going to add that back in we
[01:35:28] have Health Choice buff
[01:35:30] Choice yes it was Health
[01:35:33] Choice all right so let me correct that
[01:35:35] there pain in the ass that thing works
[01:35:38] all right so the way this is supposed to
[01:35:39] run let me start this here at the
[01:35:41] correct
[01:35:42] price so it's $25 now what we do in the
[01:35:46] break is kind of like we just have a
[01:35:47] break that we make here we do with you
[01:35:49] guys and this is like a regular one we
[01:35:50] take our packs here where our breaks
[01:35:52] that we do and we go go through our
[01:35:54] packs we open them up then we break them
[01:35:56] up between everybody like a break and
[01:35:57] the way we do it was um we take all the
[01:35:58] mythics and the rares and any uncommon
[01:36:00] and common that's over $3 put them in a
[01:36:02] sleev shuffle them up and hand them out
[01:36:04] to everyone and then we um take all
[01:36:08] before that we take all the all these
[01:36:09] put them in sleeves and shuffle them up
[01:36:11] and hand them out on everyone based on
[01:36:12] their spot number that they have and
[01:36:15] that will give you um that's how we do
[01:36:17] everybody getting one of those and then
[01:36:20] the adventure part of it is is you are
[01:36:22] going to be with some friends
[01:36:24] who have jumped in on this break and
[01:36:25] you're going to be stuck at this door
[01:36:26] trying to figure out what happens when
[01:36:27] you open
[01:36:28] it and you're going to get for this
[01:36:30] instance you get a choice of whatever
[01:36:32] happens to be what you got with it
[01:36:33] Daxter and that would be you get all
[01:36:35] those things in the break there well we
[01:36:37] do the break there like we're talking
[01:36:38] about and then you get to do a little
[01:36:40] Adventure after a little bit of a break
[01:36:42] a little bit of a kind of a fun thing to
[01:36:44] do while we're opening packs and hanging
[01:36:46] out thing versus um just opening packs
[01:36:50] only if that makes any sense
[01:36:55] then I'm going to get over to you with
[01:36:56] your
[01:37:00] stuff we are you are in floor two now

[01:55:00] people do different things differently
[01:55:01] with giveaways for me I have um what I
[01:55:04] have is we have a 10 cards here one of
[01:55:06] them has a rare in there and that's why
[01:55:08] they ask before if you were going to get
[01:55:09] a number between one and 10 and then I
[01:55:11] was going to we Shuffle those up and
[01:55:13] that's the card that you get is the
[01:55:14] number that you tell me so that's why
[01:55:16] I'd asked before if you don't have if
[01:55:18] you have a minute you want to give away
[01:55:19] so if you could give me a number between

[02:09:07] a little bit of fun but um you know
[02:09:08] every now and again know it's just
[02:09:11] holidays and different days things move
[02:09:12] slower and we're good we have a good
[02:09:15] time I try to be as yeah I try to be as
[02:09:17] Fair as possible too like I said I try
[02:09:18] to show all the pricing of everything be
[02:09:20] as straight forward as I can like I
[02:09:22] don't like as transparent as I can
[02:09:26] possibly be here um short of like giving
[02:09:29] you my bank statement you know what I
[02:09:34] mean um let me see we'll run that
[02:09:38] another time here and we'll see how you
[02:09:40] guys want to if you want to jumps in on
[02:09:42] these we have our other break here the
[02:09:44] the High Roller break those are aware is
[02:09:47] this right
[02:09:48] now have two times viral AR rabik
[02:09:51] mastered a stck Haven a calim and a core
[02:09:54] 21 and then there is in the this is not
[02:09:57] the one that's running right now the
[02:09:58] other one running right now is this
[02:09:59] Ghostbusters one but the other one that
[02:10:02] we have as a break that's on there is
[02:10:04] the one that I'm showing you off right
[02:10:06] here there's Iron Man and Arcane signant
[02:10:08] is in there so that's what is in that
[02:10:11] one my friends there for that
[02:10:18] break yeah you know I tried not to like
[02:10:20] jump and scream all
[02:10:22] like but I mean I just try to be me
[02:10:23] that's one of the things I try to say to
[02:10:24] everyone some people like try to like
[02:10:25] act a certain way like they want to be a
[02:10:27] streamer and they want to like you know
[02:10:29] they see people on like YouTube they try
[02:10:30] to act like someone on YouTube or
[02:10:32] whatever I'm like dude just do yourself
[02:10:34] that's all that matters because when
[02:10:35] you're acting that way people don't it's
[02:10:37] a six half dozen the other like I you
[02:10:39] can either get people that like it or
[02:10:41] you don't and there's people in all
[02:10:43] spectrums depends on the kind of people
[02:10:44] you want to have hang
[02:10:49] around yeah see that's why I try to run
[02:10:52] um when I do like uh things I try to run
[02:10:54] like 15 seconds and it's not sudden
[02:10:56] death it like pumps in that gives like I
[02:10:57] think 5 Seconds more or something like
[02:10:58] that and I try to be as as or like when
[02:11:01] like the single going I let people know
[02:11:02] time frame I'm doing them but if I'm
[02:11:04] going through things quickly then
[02:11:06] sometimes I might do I think it is one
[02:11:07] time I went through 10sec ones and I
[02:11:10] think it was when I was running one of
[02:11:11] the pull boxes here which was the
[02:11:13] virtual ones so you get to literally see
[02:11:14] everything that was in it so it wasn't
[02:11:16] even like you were uh unsure of what was
[02:11:18] running so you could see actually
[02:11:19] anything that was running at any time
[02:11:21] but it was like one of the virtual ones
[02:11:23] anyways and that's what I only did
[02:11:24] before I appreciate the kai I appreciate
[02:11:27] that
[02:11:28] Kai yeah we just kind of just try to
[02:11:30] help hang out have fun really is what it
[02:11:32] is do the best we can sometimes we have
[02:11:34] more fun than others sometimes sometimes
[02:11:36] it's a boring day sometimes it's a long
[02:11:38] day sometimes uh we run I've run before
[02:11:40] where I went past one o'clock I'm like
[02:11:41] all right guys I gotta get off here
[02:11:42] because everybody kept running to do
[02:11:43] things and then other times I'm just
[02:11:45] like I'm
[02:11:47] tired jump off today you know like those
[02:11:49] ones
[02:11:55] yeah then we're all freaking I will
[02:11:56] admit when we get big hits I do admit I
[02:11:58] do get a little I do get a little I jump
[02:11:59] up I get a little excited I will admit
[02:12:01] that but it's not like all the time I'm
[02:12:03] getting that way so that's what the
[02:12:05] difference is like I'm not like that
[02:12:07] with everything like oh this is the
[02:12:08] greatest card in the world this is the
[02:12:10] this is the wonderfullest card you
[02:12:11] should spend $7,000 on this
[02:12:12] wonderfullest card right here you know I
[02:12:14] mean it's the greatest of all great
[02:12:16] cards I mean look at that face on that
[02:12:17] thing you just want to kiss that face
[02:12:19] right there you definitely want that
[02:12:20] card you know oh yeah I'm not going to
[02:12:22] do that that's not me you
[02:12:25] know the whiskers yeah when we have to
[02:12:27] be quiet around people 7K is a deal I
[02:12:36] know yeah that's that's just me though
[02:12:39] you know I mean I try to be myself and
[02:12:41] that's and some people try to be a
[02:12:43] character and it be whatever you want
[02:12:44] you could be a character or not I I
[02:12:46] choose to be
[02:12:47] me it's really what it is you know and
[02:12:50] that's the I see those ones on like um I
[02:12:53] see them with a lot more with the uh
[02:12:54] with Pokemon stuff in other
[02:12:56] places and and it's kind of funny cuz
[02:12:59] when I first jumped in my kids were like
[02:13:01] oh go look with this thing cuz I didn't
[02:13:02] start this myself my children were the
[02:13:04] ones that um my oldest son saw people
[02:13:06] opening packs online when we first
[02:13:08] started getting back into magic he's
[02:13:09] like oh can we do that so we opened a
[02:13:10] few boxes and things like that but I was
[02:13:12] like I can't afford to do this then he
[02:13:14] found out like this the whatnot stuff
[02:13:16] here and we started doing a little bit
[02:13:17] on here and it kind of grew to what we
[02:13:19] are now uh a little bit more more than
[02:13:21] we were expecting you know what I mean
[02:13:22] but we'll see what happens with the um
[02:13:25] like I said if we don't get our one of
[02:13:26] the things do we do also we'll do is if
[02:13:28] we don't get the break fill
[02:13:29] today um what I'm going to do is I will
[02:13:32] try to run it maybe later tonight do
[02:13:34] another one later tonight for a little
[02:13:35] bit here come in like we do sometimes
[02:13:37] and I'll try to run the rest of the
[02:13:39] three spots tonight um and because I do
[02:13:42] have some things to make some phone
[02:13:44] calls and [ __ ] like that for um the boat
[02:13:48] here uh cuz we're going to be on it in 7
[02:13:50] days
[02:13:51] so I got to get some stuff organized
[02:13:53] like we have to contact the person about
[02:13:55] getting our our our tender then we got
[02:13:58] to talk to like our like our our um you
[02:14:00] know our our dinghy and Mo and stuff
[02:14:02] then we have to call somebody about um

[02:14:07] St Martin it has solar installed so
[02:14:09] we'll be in St Martin for about a week
[02:14:11] so the problem is I'm not going to be in
[02:14:12] the US for about a month again I was
[02:14:14] expecting it to be like two weeks but
[02:14:15] it's almost going to be maybe a month or
[02:14:16] more now so but well that's uh we'll be
[02:14:20] heading out on the 18th we'll be at St

[02:16:10] it yeah but that's what we'll be
[02:16:15] on uh the boat name are you guys going
[02:16:17] to laugh ready
[02:16:21] yeah it's a big manual it is a big
[02:16:22] manual here guys but you know it tells
[02:16:25] me everything I need to know all the
[02:16:26] different things so that's why we
[02:16:27] printed it out but
[02:16:29] anyways so the
[02:16:32] um that's the inside yes the inside so
[02:16:35] the inside of the boat is uh so yeah
[02:16:38] that would be the inside of the boat
[02:16:39] here let me
[02:16:42] see let's see if we can get to the
[02:16:44] inside a little bit
[02:16:51] yeah that's the inside of the
[02:16:55] boat that's like uh where our space that
[02:16:58] we'll be sitting in is here we have the
[02:17:00] outside there that's like one of the
[02:17:02] bedrooms over there for you guys that's
[02:17:05] you know that's a bedroom but that's
[02:17:07] Salon cockpit and that's a cabin there
[02:17:11] but
[02:17:12] yeah that's what we'll be sailing around
[02:17:15] on having some fun maybe open and open
[02:17:17] up a pack with you guys we have a
[02:17:18] location that we siip stuff to that
[02:17:21] we'll drop ship everything to you guys
[02:17:23] as we're
[02:17:24] going thank you and the the name is uh
[02:17:27] you're going to laugh so my wife wants
[02:17:29] to name it and I I kind of I don't mind
[02:17:31] it she she thinks it's funny and um we
[02:17:33] kind of she has a s similar sense of
[02:17:34] humor I guess as I have I name it bigger
[02:17:37] boat and the reason is come from I come
[02:17:41] from Massachusetts where Jaws was made
[02:17:44] and my father caught shark as a his
[02:17:48] living was a sand sharks dogfish was his
[02:17:51] boat that what he CAU for for fishing
[02:17:53] which is what I grew up catching on the
[02:17:55] off the coast and then um we live in the
[02:17:59] shark bite capital of the world new
[02:18:00] Samina which is where we plan on
[02:18:02] registering it also so having it done
[02:18:04] that way we're going to going to need a
[02:18:06] bigger boat figured it all went on with
[02:18:07] a little bit of joke in insid is not
[02:18:09] insided joke having to do with uh Jaws
[02:18:11] there so we'll have our dinghy which we
[02:18:14] named boat and we're going to tell
[02:18:16] everybody want to jump on the boat to
[02:18:17] get to the bigger
[02:18:18] boat it's really bad really bad but I
[02:18:21] thought it was
[02:18:25] funny yeah it has lots of meaning well I
[02:18:28] mean you know we came from Massachusetts
[02:18:30] I did that's where I grew up literally n
[02:18:32] tucking around that all that stuff we
[02:18:33] live in the shark by Capital my dad
[02:18:35] caught shark was what it was it was
[02:18:37] Dogfish green eyes this was the name of
[02:18:39] his boat because the dog fish have green
[02:18:41] eyes um that was the name of his fishing
[02:18:43] boat which was literally he was a
[02:18:44] captain of his own boat that was he was
[02:18:45] his own small businessman it was a
[02:18:47] fisherman out of Gloucester
[02:18:49] Massachusetts yeah well New Bedford
[02:18:51] Gloucester sometimes further south than
[02:18:53] Carolinas every now and again but yeah a
[02:18:55] little bit of a three-way meaning thing
[02:18:57] there kind of joke inside joke but not
[02:18:59] really an inside joke I don't
[02:19:02] know yeah that's about
[02:19:06] it all right guys so what I'm going to
[02:19:08] do here is I'm going to do this we are
[02:19:10] going to try a couple more of our break
[02:19:12] things here for a few minutes here and
[02:19:14] then I'm going to um we'll probably jump
[02:19:17] off and then we will come on later
[02:19:20] tonight cuz cuz that will give me some
[02:19:21] time to do some um like I said make some
[02:19:23] phone calls and stuff that I need to do
[02:19:26] so I'll think I'm going to do
[02:19:28] that and about a couple minutes here
[02:19:31] because I don't think the break is going
[02:19:32] to fill by
[02:19:33] 9:30 which gives us the time frame to do
[02:19:36] that and then I'll do is with a break
[02:19:37] for you people you have a couple options
[02:19:39] you can ask for a refund or we can do it
[02:19:41] tonight like I was saying I'll set up a
[02:19:43] show to do tonight and if you guys can I
[02:19:45] would very much appreciate it the show
[02:19:47] on the 12th all you guys all you ladies
[02:19:50] gentlemen's day is hanging out the show
[02:19:52] on the 12th what we're going to do is we
[02:19:54] will be having a tips for charity so
[02:19:57] what I plan on doing is anybody that
[02:19:58] sends chips tips in tip sends a tip on
[02:20:02] that day I'm going to take all those
[02:20:04] tips and we're g to I'll cash everything
[02:20:06] out so on Friday over the weekend I can
[02:20:08] go to Walmart and we or Target or one of
[02:20:10] the places around we're going to buy a
[02:20:12] bunch of P gifts as much as we can we're
[02:20:14] going to bring it to the police
[02:20:15] department in our area and drop it off
[02:20:16] for some of the kids uh that are in need
[02:20:18] in the area so if you guys want to do
[02:20:20] that if you can save the show on the
[02:20:22] 12th we would greatly appreciate that
[02:20:24] that would be kind of a fun thing I
[02:20:25] thought I'd always I always like to do
[02:20:26] stuff like that we try to show our kids
[02:20:28] every year we get like a gift for a boy
[02:20:29] and a girl so we can drop off at
[02:20:31] Christmas time at the police department
[02:20:32] and I was like you know what maybe we
[02:20:34] can do something with everybody around
[02:20:36] and throw you know doing the streaming
[02:20:37] thing I can do a little bit extra on
[02:20:38] there so that is on there if you guys
[02:20:40] want to save the show on the 12th that's
[02:20:43] what I'll be doing I'll be opening some
[02:20:44] packs packs and stuff like that for here
[02:20:46] kind of keep it entertainment if you
[02:20:47] want to jump on on thing buy something
[02:20:49] shelf you can but the main point of it
[02:20:51] is is for that day to tr to pretty much
[02:20:53] do some um tips so we can you know the
[02:20:55] reason why I do tips is because that
[02:20:57] they take zero cut from it at whatnot
[02:21:00] and that gets me the whole percentage of
[02:21:02] it by giving me 100% of the money given
[02:21:04] to me as the tips I get to take 100% of
[02:21:05] that money and put it towards the
[02:21:09] kids tonight works on the break all
[02:21:11] right cool thank you Nico I appreciate
[02:21:13] that sounds good so yeah I mean that's
[02:21:15] what um that's what I would like to do
[02:21:17] so if any of you hanging out here can
[02:21:19] save that show on the 12th I think
[02:21:22] that'll be a good one that'd be
[02:21:23] great thank you thank you yeah I mean
[02:21:25] I've always one my wife thinks I'm
[02:21:28] thought it was weird I made the comment
[02:21:29] but at the same time she's like she
[02:21:31] understands like I told her at some
[02:21:32] point in my life if I ever do get the
[02:21:35] money that they like my there's a
[02:21:37] company I worked for where I was a I got
[02:21:39] some stock in it when it was a startup
[02:21:41] um and it it runs a lot of Bank stuff
[02:21:43] and we're supposedly going to be able to
[02:21:44] buy an island well if I have enough
[02:21:46] money to do anything that I want with
[02:21:47] that where I can maybe buy the bigger
[02:21:48] boat that I want after this one
[02:21:51] what I wanted to do though is one at
[02:21:52] least try Christmas time see if I can be
[02:21:54] like Santa and get a bunch of gifts for
[02:21:55] everyone go to one of the local places
[02:21:57] and like drop a truckload off like fill
[02:22:00] the back of my truck up with gifts and
[02:22:03] go and drop them all off that would be
[02:22:05] my
[02:22:06] goal um to do every year and if we could
[02:22:08] get like maybe even this to help out
[02:22:10] with that that would be awesome too that
[02:22:12] way we could get a bunch of people
[02:22:13] involved and see as much as we can and
[02:22:15] send stuff off to uh the kids in the
[02:22:17] area in need here and then maybe one of
[02:22:20] the other things my my son made a
[02:22:22] comment about he what about the other
[02:22:23] days I'm like what are the other days he
[02:22:24] go the holidays and stuff like well you
[02:22:26] know we can throw some out maybe we'll
[02:22:27] do some of stuff in them those ones but
[02:22:29] we're going to start this here for the
[02:22:30] first one and see how it goes because we
[02:22:32] figure as we're traveling around too
[02:22:34] there might be different places that you
[02:22:35] know we bump into maybe we're happen to
[02:22:37] be on an island somewhere and they're
[02:22:39] they got hit by a hurricane and maybe we
[02:22:40] want to do something for relief for them
[02:22:42] and do like a tips for relief thing or
[02:22:43] something who knows what it is and my
[02:22:44] wife thought of after my cut kid made
[02:22:46] that comment so we're going to try this
[02:22:48] see how it goes though for the first one
[02:22:49] see if it works all if it doesn't work
[02:22:51] we won't do it again but if it does
[02:22:53] we'll try it a few more times and see
[02:22:55] how it
[02:22:56] goes well the thank you Kai see one of
[02:22:59] the things I try to explain to everybody
[02:23:01] you can't always help everyone but if
[02:23:04] you can do things when you
[02:23:06] can that's the biggest thing that
[02:23:08] matters because you can't help everyone
[02:23:11] every single second of your day but you
[02:23:12] can help sometimes so do it if you can
[02:23:16] because if you can help then maybe that
[02:23:17] person would like oh that was nice maybe
[02:23:19] I should help the other person you to
[02:23:21] pay it forward type thing and all you
[02:23:22] need to do is just try it every now and
[02:23:24] again when you have the opportunity and
[02:23:25] this is one of those things where I
[02:23:27] figure I have a platform I might not be
[02:23:28] able to get hundreds of thousands of
[02:23:30] dollars but if a couple hundred bucks
[02:23:32] and I can go and buy a bunch of gifts
[02:23:34] for kids that would be great so
[02:23:38] yep it's um tips for charity on the 12th

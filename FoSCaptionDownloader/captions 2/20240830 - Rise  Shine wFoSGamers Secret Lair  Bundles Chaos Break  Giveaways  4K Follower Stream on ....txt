[00:09:42] um I have Bloom bro set off to side I've
[00:09:44] been trying to get some people to play
[00:09:46] in the tournament with us there's eight
[00:09:47] people that we're going to do in a
[00:09:48] tournament and once everybody gets set
[00:09:50] up I'm going send it out and you're
[00:09:52] going to get all the cards and then
[00:09:54] um we you make them into your deck kind
[00:09:57] of like we would be playing like say
[00:09:58] like a little pre-release and once then
[00:10:00] once everybody's set up you can take
[00:10:01] your time to make your deck but we'll be
[00:10:02] able to see exactly what it is because
[00:10:04] we open them on screen here so you can
[00:10:05] see all the cards and then you can make
[00:10:07] a deck out of those and we'll uh we'll
[00:10:09] play like a little pre-release thing
[00:10:11] when we get a chance to now if you don't
[00:10:12] want to play it and you just want to get
[00:10:13] the packs um we can do that too because
[00:10:16] it is a little discount on um getting

[02:07:23] on that
[02:07:26] one no the bot is not working right now
[02:07:29] it's uh currently um it will not run for
[02:07:32] some reason I'm guessing there was an
[02:07:33] update to whatnot and and and
[02:07:37] um
[02:07:40] and chrome that's causing
[02:07:47] it all right sounds good yeah yeah I
[02:07:51] think was I think there's a whatnot did
[02:07:53] an update in uh and I'm guessing Chrome
[02:07:55] did an update it hasn't worked for a few
[02:07:57] days been like uh about 3 days because I
[02:07:59] know whatnot was acting funny the other
[02:08:01] day and I wasn't able to do some things
[02:08:03] right before it stopped working so I'm
[02:08:05] guessing they didn't made an update too

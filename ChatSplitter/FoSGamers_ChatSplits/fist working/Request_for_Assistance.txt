I need you to find me the best deal on a computer that will run an AI, a virtual AI that would be like a house-at-home AI, that you're going to be using Bronc AI, like the Twitter or X version of it. So I need you to find me a computer that will run that exceptionally well, without any issues, and that I'll be able to use for other tasks, like also having my Plex server being primary run through there, which goes to a NAS connection and that type of thing. So I need you to go through, find all that, and also and then let me know what the next steps would be to also get it so it's set up with having Bronc AI on it. So I need you to go through all that process and get everything up and running, kind of do it like if I was a technical person but a layman.

To find the best deal on a computer that will meet your requirements, I need to gather some more specific information. Here are a few questions to help narrow down the options:

1. What is your budget for this new computer?
2. Do you have a preference for a desktop or a laptop?
3. Are there any specific brands or models you prefer?
4. How much storage and RAM do you need for your Plex server and other tasks?
5. Do you need any specific ports or connections (e.g., HDMI, USB-C, Ethernet)?
6. Is there a particular operating system you prefer (Windows, macOS, Linux)?

Once I have this information, I can search for the best computer deals and provide recommendations. I will also outline the steps to set up Bronc AI and configure your Plex server with a NAS connection.

The price range that I would like to be at is $1,000. The form factor, I would like it to be very small, whether it's like a mini-computer or a laptop or something like that. I'm not going to have a lot of space. You don't really need to worry about the Plex servers. I have that already taken care of with my NAS information all set up. They just need to be able to connect to it through either network or some type of port that I can run a wire to. Now, I would prefer for it to have a few ports that I can be able to do some things with that I can have the internet connected to. At least one gig if not higher. I would like to have many other things like HDMI, USB-C, third generation, and all that stuff. That way, I can have any type of thing connected to it. And then I also, whether it's in the computer or not, or it can be used with an adapter to get the computer to work with it, I don't care for those ports. But primarily, I need it to have to be able to use them if needed. Then the operating system, I don't really care on the operating system on what it is. Could be Windows, Linux, or Macintosh. I have a Mac. I have a Windows. I have a Linux computer, so it doesn't matter. I can use all of them. Then when it comes to any other requirements, please ask me one at a time so I can respond to them from the future on.

[01:52:43] not tiny bones but a Jace and a hostile
[01:52:45] investigator nice pickups right there
[01:52:48] that was definitely a solid play booster
[01:52:50] definitely a solid play booster I have a
[01:52:51] hard time with play boosters so far but
[01:52:54] this one this one was a good one I'll
[01:52:55] have to say that one was a good one I

[01:53:04] with
[01:53:06] Jace that go to our
[01:53:08] friend
[01:53:14] quad yeah yeah I have to agree on that
[01:53:17] I'm a fan of the draft and set the way
[01:53:19] they did that cuz it's just too variable
[01:53:22] the variables are too high with this to
[01:53:24] have to even do anything like a draft
[01:53:26] with uh I think that's probably what my
[01:53:28] problem with it is if that makes any
[01:53:30] sense I don't know it's like you you can
[01:53:32] get like these like the draft was set
[01:53:33] pretty well if you were going to draft
[01:53:35] you know but I don't know that's just
[01:53:38] me let's pin this right

[02:29:33] thing is everybody sees at the beginning
[02:29:34] of the stream me I shuffle everything up
[02:29:36] on live on camera so that's why I like

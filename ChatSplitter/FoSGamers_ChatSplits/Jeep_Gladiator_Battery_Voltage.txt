The normal running voltage for a battery in a Jeep Gladiator typically ranges from 13.7 to 14.7 volts. When the vehicle is idling, it may be lower, around 12.7 to 13.2 volts, as the battery is maintaining its charge. This fluctuation is normal and depends on the state of charge and various operating conditions. If the voltage consistently drops below 12.3 volts, it could indicate a potential issue with the battery or charging system that may need further inspection【7†source】【7†source】【7†source】.

**Summary:**
The normal running voltage for a Jeep Gladiator's battery is 13.7 to 14.7 volts, with idle voltage around 12.7 to 13.2 volts. Persistent voltage below 12.3 volts may indicate a problem.

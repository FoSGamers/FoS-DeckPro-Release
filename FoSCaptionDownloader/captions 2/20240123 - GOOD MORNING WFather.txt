[00:40:18] there yes poll all right well I'll do
[00:40:21] nine random then all right one two three
[00:40:27] we kind of do a little bit of a spread
[00:40:29] four five six seven and then what I do

[00:42:02] davn yeah poison D frog is a a few bucks
[00:42:06] every now I people don't realize some of
[00:42:08] the some of the other cards they're like
[00:42:10] actually not bad and then you play and
[00:42:11] when even the play they're playing
[00:42:13] they're good playing cards I noticed out
[00:42:15] of um out of Exelon sometimes you get
[00:42:18] like sets that you're like eh I can't
[00:42:20] really do anything with those but this
[00:42:22] one at least that was a good playing
[00:42:23] deck set at least one that I thought was
[00:42:26] a good playing set for stuff that I like
[00:42:28] yeah
[00:42:29] exactly it was a very good playable set
[00:42:32] and that's what I liked about it like
[00:42:33] they've been making them more like that
[00:42:34] rather than having like a bunch of them
[00:42:36] that are like what are these cards doing
[00:42:37] here you have like there's more that are
[00:42:40] oh wow that actually makes sense for why
[00:42:41] this cards here you know all right thank
[00:42:43] you very much I do appreciate
[00:42:46] that yeah re yeah recently the sets
[00:42:48] exactly yeah just one of those it's nice
[00:42:50] to see that like I think I feel like it
[00:42:52] started with um with wilds of All Drain
[00:42:55] almost like valre they're like you know
[00:42:57] what we have we've been um we've been
[00:42:59] kind of [ __ ] around with this with
[00:43:00] the cards and give like maybe one or two
[00:43:03] cards that people want for set let's
[00:43:05] let's actually give them multiple cards
[00:43:06] this time you know and that's that's I
[00:43:08] feel like it started with wilds Val
[00:43:10] drain um at least for me when I started
[00:43:12] playing I started playing before like a
[00:43:14] a few months before that I was like wow
[00:43:15] this I don't really want these I don't
[00:43:16] really want these yeah not bad not bad

[00:43:30] cool in the play booster it's pry
[00:43:31] relevant to the set even better see I

[00:53:12] yourself or you taking care of the kids
[00:53:13] today see that's the thing that's uh
[00:53:16] that's the thing that always uh gets me
[00:53:18] it's like do you drop the kids off and
[00:53:19] you by yourself because if you're not by
[00:53:21] yourself then it's
[00:53:23] like it's nice that you dropped her off
[00:53:25] at the same time that means you're
[00:53:27] alone you have to deal with it
[00:53:33] alone we're going to call these three
[00:53:36] packs on
[00:53:43] screen I am a little interested in
[00:53:46] Murders At Kavanaugh I actually am I got
[00:53:48] a u i got a whole case uh of them a case
[00:53:51] of
[00:53:52] bundles um and uh because I I kind of
[00:53:56] like the little mystery game aspect of
[00:53:57] it personally um you know that's uh for
[00:54:01] me I thought that was kind of cool by
[00:54:04] yourself hey that's even better it means
[00:54:06] you can uh poop with the door open and
[00:54:07] all that good stuff
[00:54:09] [Laughter]
[00:54:12] right yeah the clue Edition like I I
[00:54:14] don't know if I got the Clue the thing
[00:54:16] is though I got a regular B I got
[00:54:17] bundles I didn't know the clue Edition
[00:54:18] was around and there wasn't a way for me
[00:54:20] to get the clue Edition from where I was
[00:54:21] going where I got from so I'm hoping
[00:54:23] that they come out with it at um boxes
[00:54:26] there like they were able to get them at
[00:54:27] some point because I thought the clue
[00:54:29] Edition was coming out um at the same
[00:54:31] time but I got like the I guess it's
[00:54:34] just the regular bundle but maybe they
[00:54:35] are the clue Edition bundle maybe that's
[00:54:37] what it is all the bundles are clue
[00:54:38] Edition I'm not
[00:54:40] sure but I got a box of bundles to see
[00:54:43] what happens I don't know all right

[01:14:01] work with a couple of them um actually
[01:14:04] right I went to school with a couple of
[01:14:06] them and I ended up working with one of
[01:14:08] them after
[01:14:10] school all right I thought I was seeing
[01:14:12] it
[01:14:18] right yeah I I had uh they were twins
[01:14:21] they happen to be twins that I uh went
[01:14:23] to school
[01:14:24] with and one was uh one ended up working
[01:14:27] at the place that I worked at after
[01:14:30] school after college so that's all you
[01:14:34] don't happen to be a twin
[01:14:39] right no that's no they were they were
[01:14:41] both boys they were both boys not uh not
[01:14:44] girls not a girl and a boy no this was
[01:14:47] at uh University of um New Hampshire I
[01:14:51] dude if you were going to say you know
[01:14:52] who they were and you had the same names
[01:14:54] I was going to be like you going to be
[01:14:55] [ __ ] me there's no way that we
[01:14:57] connected somehow to some person that I
[01:14:58] knew from college that would be
[01:15:02] insane but you know what I will throw it
[01:15:04] out here though there's a guy that I
[01:15:06] sold something to lives 20 minutes away
[01:15:08] from me and goes to the same local game
[01:15:09] store and I didn't realize it I was I
[01:15:12] was like well that's pretty cool all
[01:15:14] right so I'm gonna throw on some uh yeah
[01:15:16] I know it's insane like there's
[01:15:18] thousands of people that comeing through
[01:15:19] here or whatever and it happened to be
[01:15:20] somebody that's like 20 minutes away and
[01:15:22] we literally go the same store all right
[01:15:24] so what I'm going to do here is I'm
[01:15:27] going to throw on a pack deal and then
[01:15:28] I'm going to scroll through my higher
[01:15:30] price cards because not everybody has
[01:15:33] the money you know what actually let me
[01:15:35] put these ones on let me do this

[01:32:13] those and I'll go to the next batch of
[01:32:15] dollar ones if there's one that you want
[01:32:18] just yell it out in the chat not that I
[01:32:21] can hear you yell so just more you have
[01:32:23] to type it in the chat and I will put
[01:32:26] that off to the side for you if you
[01:32:28] swipe your hand over to get one for a
[01:32:30] dollar then we're going to go through
[01:32:32] this bunch here which is a lot so I'm
[01:32:34] probably not going to get through them
[01:32:41] all because there's a ton of them here
[01:32:44] that are foils like I said foils
[01:32:46] extended Arts stuff like that all these
[01:32:50] are a dollar if you want any of them all
[01:32:54] you got to do is just say that you want
[01:32:57] it throw your throw it in the chat and I
[01:33:01] will put it off to the side when you
[01:33:03] wipe your finger over and if you want to
[01:33:06] stack them go right ahead stack them
[01:33:08] also
[01:33:12] so that's fine with
[01:33:15] me and stack them
[01:33:20] too
[01:33:32] all right I know it's I'm not done yet
[01:33:34] the time is out so I'm G to run that for
[01:33:37] a second again here I guess I needed a
[01:33:39] little bit more time to finish
[01:33:47] that guess I needed a little bit more
[01:33:49] time to finish that one so I'm going to
[01:33:50] keep going through it for that for added
[01:33:52] another minute on so if anybody wants
[01:33:54] them just going through them here kind
[01:33:57] of scrolling through what I got all in
[01:33:59] the dollar area that is um putting on
[01:34:02] for a dollar for anybody wants them you

[01:34:14] end

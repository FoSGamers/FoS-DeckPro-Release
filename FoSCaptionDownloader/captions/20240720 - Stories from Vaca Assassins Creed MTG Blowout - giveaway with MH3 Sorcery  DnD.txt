[00:00:15] and I H my glass on well I didn't get
[00:00:17] direct hit on it with the tissue that I
[00:00:19] was trying to crush it against the wall
[00:00:21] with and uh well was say I tried looking
[00:00:26] around for it on the ground couldn't

[00:15:29] another I'm going to start I'm just kind
[00:15:31] you know what I'm going to go through
[00:15:32] while you can actually see him why am I
[00:15:33] doing that in the background hold on a
[00:15:34] second that was silly of
[00:15:38] me all right I'm going through them here
[00:15:41] I'm going to keep one of these I don't
[00:15:42] know which one I'm keeping
[00:15:47] though yir I needed one yir at least but
[00:15:50] we have a couple of those
[00:15:53] [Music]
[00:15:56] Edward could just lat thought I had
[00:15:59] another Royal
[00:16:01] assassin that's really what I'm looking
[00:16:03] for I thought there was one more that I
[00:16:05] had here but maybe I was wrong I do not
[00:16:08] have one
[00:16:12] more black market what must be done
[00:16:17] thought I had another Royal assassin
[00:16:19] that's why I got sidetracked here trying
[00:16:20] to find the other Royal
[00:16:22] assassin
[00:16:26] H red for you oh you red for player aha
[00:16:30] I
[00:16:30] see these are all my ones from the other
[00:16:33] one yeah that's so that those the m 3
[00:16:36] ones I pulled out
[00:16:38] yesterday and this is the Vault I
[00:16:42] believe from
[00:16:43] ACR I haven't had a chance to put C on
[00:16:46] yet let's see nope some Modern Horizon 3
[00:16:49] mod Horizon
[00:16:52] 3 ah May opening a modern Horizon 3
[00:16:56] things I forgot about that h
[00:16:59] what do I have in here that's some bul
[00:17:01] stuff I forgot about all that intriguing
[00:17:05] how did I forget about
[00:17:08] those anyways I'll have to go through
[00:17:10] that then that was there this is what
[00:17:13] happens when you go on a vacation and
[00:17:14] you come back your brain's broken for a
[00:17:16] little
[00:17:19] while yeah some of them are worth a
[00:17:21] little bit but hey I wanted to get I
[00:17:22] thought I had three of them three or
[00:17:24] four of
[00:17:25] them I guess I'm wrong on that guess I'm
[00:17:29] wrong on that thought I had three or
[00:17:31] four of
[00:17:34] them maybe I put them over
[00:17:39] here ah I think I found the side that
[00:17:42] they're
[00:17:43] on that's why I was looking the wrong
[00:17:50] place I was looking the wrong place
[00:17:52] that's why you look in the right spot if
[00:17:54] you're going to find stff Ah that's why
[00:17:58] those are the those on here's another
[00:18:00] chunk we'll go through this chunk I
[00:18:01] thought I had
[00:18:06] more I thought I had another Royal
[00:18:08] that's the Royal assassin I knew I had
[00:18:10] another Royal assassin but that was the
[00:18:12] pre uh that's
[00:18:15] the have so the bulk there but I think I
[00:18:19] had one other
[00:18:21] card I got another Royal assassin in
[00:18:24] here but maybe I'm wrong I probably am
[00:18:28] because that's how broken my brain is at
[00:18:29] the moment that spider threw me off so
[00:18:31] much this morning that I can't function
[00:18:33] I hate spiders they scare me I saw rnap
[00:18:36] phobia as a child and since then I've
[00:18:38] been paranoid of
[00:18:42] him it's
[00:18:44] irrational
[00:18:47] iral
[00:18:49] irrational
[00:18:51] stupid

[00:36:08] it into a I was actually trying to build
[00:36:10] a game with some of these that's why I
[00:36:12] was G to have my website up and running
[00:36:14] hopefully soon now I got more time to do
[00:36:16] this
[00:36:17] stuff ah nice job all right now there's
[00:36:22] three of them out there you hit one of
[00:36:24] them they're only 60 Point Health on
[00:36:26] each one of them you hit one of them he
[00:36:29] brought that one down to uh 37 that was
[00:36:32] a good hit on that one with a plasma
[00:36:33] rifle the uh the other one was missed
[00:36:36] because it was uh I'm guessing it was
[00:36:37] too far away and you got another one
[00:36:40] that comes over and you the other looks
[00:36:42] like another hit on one of them brought
[00:36:44] the 60 down to uh 28 that was a really
[00:36:47] good hit you must hit him somewhere in
[00:36:48] the face that there they're scared now
[00:36:51] we don't know what to
[00:36:54] do all right which one Yi we're going to
[00:36:57] do
[00:36:59] number 16 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
[00:37:06] 14 15
[00:37:09] 16 I should drink a coffee in the
[00:37:11] morning maybe that'll help
[00:37:13] me 16 I think that's the only three
[00:37:16] Royal assassins I have I'm going have to
[00:37:17] find more
[00:37:19] maybe here we
[00:37:24] go put that out there we run
[00:37:28] that and we're going to throw that over
[00:37:30] here remember everybody we have all
[00:37:31] kinds of things available in the buy now
[00:37:34] maybe you want to participate and play
[00:37:36] so how we do this is like you find a box
[00:37:38] along the way and you get to Peak over
[00:37:39] the character and you get something
[00:37:40] special or an counter occurs so that's
[00:37:42] what you help with it you say maybe
[00:37:44] there's a speci an encounter all
[00:37:45] occurring then maybe it's an item that
[00:37:46] happens in fall for you guys you know
[00:37:48] what I mean there we go let's see you're
[00:37:52] currently uh finding those mutant mats
[00:37:54] they're kind of scared hit a few of them
[00:37:56] are you going to attack going to run
[00:37:57] away because they they were far away at
[00:37:59] the time you just heard some screeching
[00:38:01] you got scared and started shooting
[00:38:02] right away not a bad idea so that means
[00:38:03] you got the first shot
[00:38:05] Off You GNA attack another time all
[00:38:07] right you had one free attack see
[00:38:09] because you got shot off he were scared
[00:38:11] you took him out now you shoot again I
[00:38:13] like the idea to attack a second
[00:38:15] time
[00:38:18] now see what you h on that one all right
[00:38:22] oh good hit on that one must have came
[00:38:24] close enough that your other buddy could
[00:38:25] hit him with a shotgun because the
[00:38:26] brought the 37 down to 17 got a nice big
[00:38:29] 20 hit but oh looks like he was very mad
[00:38:32] at your buddy though your buddy got
[00:38:33] scraped nice big claw right across him
[00:38:36] hopefully they don't turn into a vampire
[00:38:38] that' be
[00:38:40] intriguing and brings it down to 90
[00:38:43] Health from 115 that was a big hit
[00:38:45] that's why I say oh that was a hard one
[00:38:46] for you now you're oh you got no 28 the
[00:38:48] guy he hit for 28 was only down to 22
[00:38:51] now and the one you missed oh it looks
[00:38:53] like you hit the one you missed this
[00:38:55] time I like it you hit the one you
[00:38:56] missed now down to 41 health so you have
[00:39:01] 17 health for them 22 health and 41
[00:39:03] Health you're at 141 looks like none of
[00:39:06] them hit you today so far because they
[00:39:09] don't they must not like they must not
[00:39:10] like that plasma rifle you have maybe
[00:39:12] it's it's a light of the plasma rifle
[00:39:14] keeping them away or something I don't
[00:39:15] know who who knows what it is but that's
[00:39:18] what you got going right now and they're
[00:39:19] not anywhere near
[00:39:20] you all right so 141 for you and 90 for
[00:39:24] your friend what are you gonna do they
[00:39:25] can attack or you gonna run got one more
[00:39:28] option of what we're doing then uh
[00:39:30] because we gotta finished going on with
[00:39:31] our
[00:39:32] game can't hang out in the adventure at
[00:39:34] one point always attack continue
[00:39:36] attacking all right fine continue
[00:39:38] attacking you shoot with your plasma
[00:39:40] rifle again that was a good shot on that
[00:39:42] first one you kill the first one that's
[00:39:45] a good one on the second one oh you
[00:39:49] missed the second one oh my that's no
[00:39:52] good and you hit the third one
[00:39:57] four oh that's not a bad hit that's a
[00:39:59] good not really good hit wow can't
[00:40:01] believe a plasma rifle only did four
[00:40:03] damage all right only brings you down to
[00:40:05] 37 on that one now it's kind of scared
[00:40:07] though oh that one seems like it's a
[00:40:08] little bit scared as the money just
[00:40:11] died your uh your friend does not have
[00:40:14] any damage because the one closest to
[00:40:15] him you killed but the one near you does
[00:40:17] get mad that has 22 heal goes near you
[00:40:19] and hits you looks like you get hit by
[00:40:21] one of them at least no no that's not
[00:40:23] good that was a pretty good hit on you
[00:40:25] that brought you down 20 Health from 14
[00:40:27] 1 to 121
[00:40:30] now last thing you're going to do here
[00:40:32] one of them is fleeing the other one's
[00:40:34] attacking you what do you want to do for
[00:40:36] the last thing before we're done
[00:40:47] here we're gonna attack the third time
[00:40:49] that was a good idea we're pretty close
[00:40:50] to taking them out our fourth time so
[00:40:53] here we go one of them de you shoot
[00:40:56] couple shots one of them
[00:40:58] pants all
[00:41:02] right bar drops the health down to four
[00:41:04] for that one that was at 22 health and
[00:41:06] the other one that's running away you
[00:41:07] miss but it still runs away looks like
[00:41:09] it was that one must one in the
[00:41:11] background must have been a pretty good
[00:41:12] scaredy
[00:41:13] cat because uh that m one in the
[00:41:16] background it seems like it just turned
[00:41:17] and ran when it got scared so there you
[00:41:19] go you got lucky there one of them ran
[00:41:22] away one of them you killed you shot
[00:41:24] brought it down to four Health that one
[00:41:26] turns and runs away too in the process
[00:41:28] of running away they dropped something
[00:41:31] for our friend that it was uh our
[00:41:35] buddy house that got this here now house
[00:41:39] do you want us to open this or ship it

[00:51:10] Oblivion there you go let's do it that
[00:51:13] way check the buy now Fort you should
[00:51:17] see it in there
[00:51:30] ah should be in there
[00:51:33] now I I see it all right we're going to

[00:51:40] first Benji giveaway of the day I like
[00:51:43] it all right here we go dog we're gonna
[00:51:47] open this up and see what you get here
[00:51:48] let's see what number 13 luck was for
[00:51:50] you oh you've gotten yourself
[00:51:54] 1991 Fleer baseball oh what should can
[00:51:57] we open these that was our get our Benji
[00:51:59] one there now being out of those that
[00:52:01] means we're only going to get down to
[00:52:02] our uh our random ones of Collections
[00:52:05] and somebody's GNA like these ones these
[00:52:08] ones are pretty sweet
[00:52:10] too you're very welcome hey can we open
[00:52:13] uh should we open that baby up and see
[00:52:14] what's in
[00:52:17] there or can we open this up and see
[00:52:19] what's in there yeah all right now what
[00:52:20] we're going to do is the coolest thing
[00:52:21] with that is you now actually get like
[00:52:23] free shipping if you're going to get
[00:52:24] like a pack of cards because uh the the
[00:52:27] way that the the giveaway went the
[00:52:30] weight now give you like kind of free
[00:52:31] shipping if you get like a pack that's
[00:52:32] pretty
[00:52:34] cool it should be uh it's because these
[00:52:38] I put it in for 11 ounces because of the
[00:52:42] weight these were so that would thing I
[00:52:43] can think of that was a close because
[00:52:45] each of these are around like one and a
[00:52:46] half to
[00:52:48] two and there's six of them so that's 12
[00:52:51] so I put 11 for the packaging stuff
[00:52:53] that's why and I may be the difference
[00:52:56] for where it's going to that's the only
[00:52:58] thing I can think
[00:52:59] of all right but first we're going to go
[00:53:01] with this oh Lawrence
[00:53:04] Paris Bob Welch Odie McDow Ron Darling
[00:53:11] Mike boder Sam
[00:53:14] Horn you got your checklist for
[00:53:20] 91 marel

[00:53:42] cool some logo stickers from back in the
[00:53:44] day that's pretty
[00:53:46] cool I like it it's probably the
[00:53:50] location shouldn't be doing that though
[00:53:53] let me uh can double check we should be
[00:53:55] okay
[00:53:58] that um but that it would be location
[00:54:00] based and everything there too I'm
[00:54:01] actually it'll be a little different
[00:54:03] soon though because I'm going to have a
[00:54:04] home base
[00:54:05] location and it's gonna be near
[00:54:08] us try to um I was wed to see if I could
[00:54:11] find something more Central the country
[00:54:13] that way it wouldn't be bad for everyone

[01:17:20] 14 15 this 16 back there 17 18 19 20 2
[01:17:25] 22 23 right
[01:17:28] there that's our
[01:17:30] giveaway going out now that was fun
[01:17:34] let's see we're going in the town there
[01:17:37] what do you want to
[01:17:40] do yeah raw M obviously
[01:17:43] yeah so if you want to play we're
[01:17:46] heading into that town up to all of you
[01:17:48] what we're going to do here today now
[01:17:50] what I'm going to check out next though
[01:17:52] is I'm going like this I'm going to our
[01:17:55] cards that we have over here and go
[01:17:57] through some of them like I said I was
[01:18:01] doing try to find I thought I had more
[01:18:03] Royal assassins is pretty much what I
[01:18:04] was doing so if anybody wants something
[01:18:06] do I already went through those do let
[01:18:08] me know if you want those I already went
[01:18:11] through those I was going through this
[01:18:13] stack that's what it
[01:18:15] was trying to find I thought I had
[01:18:18] another Royal
[01:18:21] assassin maybe I was wrong
[01:18:26] I might be
[01:18:28] wrong I want to do like I thought I
[01:18:31] thought I set a four of
[01:18:33] them no I might be wrong then these are
[01:18:37] sticking together the sleeves I don't
[01:18:38] like
[01:18:41] that that never happens oh that's going
[01:18:44] to be
[01:18:48] frustrating now if you want any of these
[01:18:50] singles do let me know say like hey I
[01:18:51] need that give it to me
[01:18:56] I can get that for you distract
[01:18:59] guards so I don't think I need many of
[01:19:02] these I might need one I was only going
[01:19:03] to use one or two of
[01:19:05] them but I like the uh his hision which
[01:19:09] is why I wanted to see if I could get
[01:19:12] any all right no one wants any of those
[01:19:16] singles going
[01:19:19] out do
[01:19:21] this now if you guys want any of them
[01:19:24] just let me you know just throw out say
[01:19:25] hey I would like to take those I'm going
[01:19:28] to throw out a uh the adventure game as
[01:19:30] you see there pinned it's pretty fun we
[01:19:33] had some of our friends playing it
[01:19:34] before that's what we just did and we're
[01:19:36] W for Oblivion to say what he wants to
[01:19:38] do Oblivion wants to continue playing or
[01:19:40] not but either way we're heading down
[01:19:42] and we're adding tell ride right now but
[01:19:44] we want to see what happens we're gonna
[01:19:45] go through some of singles though first
[01:19:47] because we have people that like
[01:19:48] those these are just our Assassin's
[01:19:51] Creed ones right now because I'm trying
[01:19:52] to find I thought I had another Royal
[01:19:54] assassin
[01:19:55] I may not may I only have that one but
[01:19:58] if there's one of these that you need or
[01:20:00] you want let me
[01:20:03] know and I can uh put it off the side
[01:20:06] with your name on
[01:20:08] it you bought into the game I was
[01:20:10] letting you play
[01:20:12] uh GNA let you play if you want well I
[01:20:16] was going let you play the gam since you
[01:20:17] bought something in no I said if you
[01:20:19] want to we'll play the game if you um
[01:20:21] with you Oblivion since you just jumped
[01:20:22] in and bought something and we were
[01:20:23] hanging out not really doing much just
[01:20:25] waiting because no one bought any the
[01:20:27] boxes to continue to go on you know
[01:20:30] Alexus no conspiracy a couple of those
[01:20:35] thought I had the other Royal assassin I
[01:20:37] guess not assassin's TR oh maybe that's
[01:20:39] what I'm thinking of Assassin's trophy
[01:20:43] that might be what I'm thinking of there
[01:20:44] aha it's probably what I'm thinking
[01:20:52] of I guess I only have the three of
[01:20:54] those
[01:20:58] guess I only have the three of those
[01:20:59] yeah because I already went through
[01:21:00] those
[01:21:01] sponge now nobody wanted any of those
[01:21:03] Assassin's Creed that's okay we'll have
[01:21:06] to
[01:21:07] uh continue
[01:21:10] on with uh showing off some of our cards
[01:21:13] on our adventure
[01:21:15] here uh oh cards fell down I don't like
[01:21:21] that damn it
[01:21:34] silly silly
[01:21:42] silly silly silly person I dumped them
[01:21:45] all over
[01:21:49] again there we
[01:21:51] go trying to get them all lined up
[01:21:53] because I have a problem with n being
[01:21:54] that way I get I got a little OCD issue
[01:21:56] I
[01:22:00] guess there ah feels better now
[01:22:03] organized somewhat not messy not so
[01:22:08] messy all right throw those out
[01:22:14] there so Oblivion yes what we're saying
[01:22:16] is if you wanted to play the game you
[01:22:18] can you're in the C you're coming into
[01:22:20] this little place called uh little
[01:22:22] little town in the middle of nowhere
[01:22:23] called toride right now
[01:22:26] is what's going on so we have three
[01:22:27] Royal

[01:23:24] oh slow mornings are Saturday
[01:23:27] Saturdays generally you know people are
[01:23:29] just waking up they're either look
[01:23:31] they're or they're up overnight and U
[01:23:33] when they've been up overnight they're
[01:23:34] generally not kind of like my hangout
[01:23:36] type people they're more of
[01:23:38] um I know they drinking I guess that's
[01:23:41] all I got to say they've been drinking
[01:23:42] so they're not they're a little more of
[01:23:44] a or hanging out all night long and
[01:23:48] they're more a
[01:23:51] um they want to have some gambling at
[01:23:54] times and I don't like to do that that's
[01:23:56] not my
[01:23:57] style so that's why we're uh that's why
[01:24:00] I do my
[01:24:03] thing let get these out come
[01:24:09] on people have their own styles of stuff
[01:24:11] though I don't care that's your life
[01:24:13] doesn't matter to me oh now I'm not
[01:24:15] going to be able to get anything out of
[01:24:19] here going annoy the crap out of me
[01:24:21] aren't me aren't you

[01:24:33] right because it looks like you have
[01:24:35] some of those ones
[01:24:40] there in the wrong location

[01:25:34] happen it runs on one of the other place

[01:34:50] when I wake up I'm awake
[01:34:53] zo zoom
[01:34:58] out I didn't see
[01:35:00] anything I did
[01:35:05] not did I I'll have to check that later
[01:35:08] I
[01:35:10] remember
[01:35:11] Ryan the magic I like to see the coming
[01:35:14] in we're looking through some R singles
[01:35:18] here I'll put some of them out for all
[01:35:21] of you in case you want any
[01:35:24] put that back
[01:35:26] there maybe some would like get

[01:35:34] bit there we go it's a good card for
[01:35:49] you there you go nice little get lost
[01:35:52] for you
[01:35:57] add a $4
[01:35:59] card com for there destroy Target

[01:37:21] right those ones I don't think it I
[01:37:23] can't can't check those ones that's why
[01:37:24] those are right there ah it's probably
[01:37:26] reason
[01:37:28] why the delay why is a delay I don't
[01:37:30] know if I need that
[01:37:32] anymore that was H there for a reason
[01:37:34] I'm guessing it's because I wanted it
[01:37:36] not because it was worth anything
[01:37:37] because I know I was like I think I need
[01:37:38] that card to
[01:37:40] use
[01:37:44] but since I don't need it right now
[01:37:47] we'll throw it out a little delay for

[01:54:06] think I did like a factor of 10 and or
[01:54:08] one point something to make the health
[01:54:10] higher but it is up to you my friend
[01:54:13] Phoenix if you'd like to do that because

[01:56:46] investigating that you know that was a
[01:56:47] good idea you go investigate you turn

[01:56:53] that you look kind of
[01:56:54] cool and you find a little
[01:56:58] market now I was surprising this is
[01:57:00] actually a pretty nice little market
[01:57:02] here came out of nowhere in this little
[01:57:05] town you weren't expecting it actually a
[01:57:08] little nice look place there some
[01:57:09] Greenery around you didn't expect it to
[01:57:10] look this
[01:57:12] good now what do you want to do here you
[01:57:15] want to go through the market see what
[01:57:16] you get you do have
[01:57:18] currently 21 2 3 four five
[01:57:22] 25 of the Wasteland currency here which

[01:57:31] all right thank you thank you for saying
[01:57:33] that right helping me say it you can uh
[01:57:36] go on check it out it could be like a so
[01:57:39] you were going to investigate so I'm
[01:57:41] guessing you want to go and see if
[01:57:41] there's any food you can have uh maybe
[01:57:43] we use some weapons some ammo want to go
[01:57:46] is there a store that you want to
[01:57:47] specifically go and see if there is a
[01:57:49] store of some kind to play at
[01:58:01] oh fell over
[01:58:02] there sure all right what are you
[01:58:05] looking for let's see what they
[01:58:07] got so where we going Phoenix let's see
[01:58:11] what they got all right we're going to
[01:58:11] go on there we see looks like there is a
[01:58:14] oh look at that got like a general store
[01:58:17] of some kind that's not bad see that
[01:58:19] there it's a little burnt out in the
[01:58:21] background but then you have all also
[01:58:23] uh looks like a pharmacy maybe you'll be
[01:58:26] able to get some health
[01:58:27] stuff I think this on one side oh
[01:58:30] there's a uh you know that there's a
[01:58:33] restaurant and there's H some places

[03:33:57] good you run into
[03:34:01] something and it happens to
[03:34:03] be some mutants oh
[03:34:10] no what are we going to do against the
[03:34:13] mutants
[03:34:18] got a bottle feed all right no I can
[03:34:19] take a second there we'll take one
[03:34:20] second here I can take a second there
[03:34:22] you got a bottle get the bottle going do
[03:34:24] some feeding so what I'll do is I'm
[03:34:27] going to write your name on
[03:34:34] this all right there we go you're going
[03:34:37] back to Waco and in the night in the
[03:34:40] middle of the night one of the nights
[03:34:41] though it happens you're driving you're
[03:34:44] tired you take a wrong turn and this is
[03:34:48] not good take a wrong
[03:34:52] turning you get ambushed because you
[03:34:55] have to end up going slower over some of
[03:34:56] the stuff that's
[03:34:57] found you end up getting ambushed by
[03:35:00] some mutants on the ride back this is
[03:35:03] not
[03:35:04] good now you are in your truck but
[03:35:07] you're low on fuel the road is blocked
[03:35:10] by some Vehicles there we're not really
[03:35:13] sure what we're going to do it's up to
[03:35:15] you if you're going to if you're gonna
[03:35:16] try to turn around and run or do you
[03:35:18] want to have your robot now has a fixed
[03:35:19] arm instead of one arm maybe you're
[03:35:21] gonna throw him two weapons and you have
[03:35:23] one weapon yourself and you just go guns
[03:35:25] blazing through try to get it through
[03:35:27] and to the end there push right through
[03:35:29] I mean you do have a pretty good siiz
[03:35:30] Gladiator there nice looking one there
[03:35:32] that could probably Push by I think you
[03:35:35] could push through that truck that
[03:35:37] vehicle in the road see if you can get
[03:35:39] through I like it all right so you guys
[03:35:41] load
[03:35:43] up you load your weapons you start going
[03:35:46] through what do I say we put uh I say we
[03:35:48] give the plasma rifle probably a good
[03:35:50] idea to give to your um the plasma rifle
[03:35:52] and the assault rifle maybe give to our
[03:35:55] robot give the shotgun to the uh your
[03:35:57] buddy on the side and uh and the
[03:36:00] passenger seat and then um we'll have um
[03:36:03] you have the pistol because you're
[03:36:04] driving in case you just really need it
[03:36:06] right sound like I think that's a good
[03:36:07] plan there it's up to you though I know
[03:36:10] you're bottle feeding that's why I was
[03:36:11] giving a little help trying to give you
[03:36:12] a little help on some of the ideas
[03:36:16] yes all right that's a good plan all
[03:36:17] right so you get led up you start
[03:36:19] driving on through you see what's going
[03:36:21] you rev that engine and you peel on
[03:36:25] through and then your truck your guy on
[03:36:27] the back of the truck nice start
[03:36:32] shooting your robot in the back of the
[03:36:34] truck should shooting with the assault
[03:36:37] rifle and that plasma rifle and in that
[03:36:40] process he takes out a couple of them
[03:36:42] and you actually luckily have been
[03:36:44] wanting those right when you're running
[03:36:46] through them I like it that's a good one
[03:36:48] your shotgun you got going shotgun lucky
[03:36:50] oh you guys were lucky there some one of
[03:36:53] them jumps in the window and he use that
[03:36:55] shotgun takes them
[03:36:57] out so you're riding through you luckily
[03:37:00] cream a couple of them they're running
[03:37:02] behind you one of them's on your
[03:37:03] windshield you start wiping
[03:37:05] away get them off the windshield wipers
[03:37:07] there you notice there's a gold thing
[03:37:09] there stuck to your windshield you reach
[03:37:10] over and try to get off there what

[03:46:29] wants to do his birthday party with his
[03:46:30] friends today so I have to get ready
[03:46:32] with that in a little while
[03:46:33] here I know if I do a later show I might
[03:46:36] not because I have to do a uh have to
[03:46:38] pack up stuff then I also need to uh
[03:46:41] prepare for Sunday night for those of
[03:46:44] you that are coming out
[03:46:45] hanging Sunday night we are going to
[03:46:50] have our game night our first one Mr
[03:46:53] Fong chaa and
[03:46:57] squirrel are going to be
[03:47:00] playing we're going to be doing a Sunday
[03:47:02] night at 4M Eastern a uh a commander
[03:47:05] night we're playing some fun having some
[03:47:07] fun so I put that up there in the corner
[03:47:09] there for you
[03:47:11] guys but yeah I mean some of the cards
[03:47:14] are collectiable there's a lot of people
[03:47:15] that collect them I mean there's a ton
[03:47:16] of collectible cards that people have on
[03:47:18] a regular basis um as you can see I even
[03:47:20] have some myself that people
[03:47:33] like I put this out little doubling
[03:47:36] season for someone as you can see even
[03:47:39] the prices of some of these are crazy
[03:47:43] too cuz this is coming from
[03:47:48] up this is coming from uh a ccg player
[03:47:52] website that does it
[03:47:55] all 5.57 why is it
[03:47:58] doing
[03:47:59] price TC price CMM
[03:48:04] 557 there you go ah 46 here you go
[03:48:08] that's what I was trying to say there
[03:48:09] it's a nice
[03:48:12] card now being a one that's an expensive
[03:48:15] one this will always go with um more
[03:48:18] expensive shipping where it has
[03:48:20] tracking being a doubling season this is
[03:48:23] going to end up going for 41 instead of
[03:48:26] 46 that way you get your deal discount
[03:48:28] on some shipping there worth it and
[03:48:30] there you go doubling season for
[03:48:38] Le yeah there's more I'd say there's
[03:48:40] more value in the cards than Pokemon I
[03:48:42] will agree with that asking I will agree
[03:48:44] with that that does make sense there's
[03:48:45] more value I would say there's more
[03:48:47] value in Magic than
[03:48:49] Pokemon because they've been around a
[03:48:51] bit longer and uh and
[03:48:56] that no all of them can have it
[03:48:58] potentially correct all of them could
[03:48:59] potentially have the monobolt for my
[03:49:01] understanding that is
[03:49:05] correct I do have a few of those left by
[03:49:08] the
[03:49:09] way I do have a few of those left
[03:49:22] [Music]
[03:49:28] maybe somebody would like something like
[03:49:31] that yes not a bad one to get you can
[03:49:35] what I can do is I can rip that open and
[03:49:36] uh we don't actually have to open
[03:49:38] anything I can just kind of flip around
[03:49:39] or I can even ship the whole thing to

[03:49:49] we'll put out
[03:49:55] here we'll know what this one instead of

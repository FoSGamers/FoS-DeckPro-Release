38:30
was sweet all right let me do this going to do um that I think we look okay and
38:37
pull these back over here so we see what's in our break nice and
38:43
easily here we go and get the Wolverine out
38:50
there well thank you that's a good something while waiting for the break I will say that that's a good something
38:57
while waiting for the break that's a good throwback to like like I said just a good throwback to uh good times when
39:02
you were younger and uh fun sets and like you said if you get
39:07
some of the big hits they're big hits so card holder card card did Lay
39:14
the way we do the break is uh we have all the packs that you see here everything gets open um even the secret
39:20
layer since there's six spots there's six cards in the secret layer here all the secret layer get put in the sleeves
39:26
they get shuffled up and handed up so everybody gets one of the secret layer I don't know which one we shuffle them up hand them out then we take all the
39:32
mythics the rares and then he uncommon or common that is $3 or more from all
39:38
the six packs here we put those into sleeves shuffle them up and hand them out it's kind of like a dealing hits
39:43
type thing so uh we deal out the hits from there that are pretty much any Commons or uncommons that are $3 and
39:50
more and any rares or mythics and then the Marvel Wolverine goes separate and
39:56
then after that what we do is uh we do a little adventure thing so like I it's like a little thank you game we play do
40:03
a little Adventure you guys were wandering around the city as an an adventurer here and you guys need to decide because you might be running up
40:10
against a a boss of some kind who knows what you're going to come up against but it's a fun time every now
40:18
and again when you get to uh when we go through these and like I said we're going to we'll definitely do it end up
40:23
running it if uh whoever doesn't take a spot I might end up taking that last the last spot or two I'm hoping we can get
40:29
one more person in here that way we can at least get uh you know get four people participating in our
40:36
raid here going to see what's going on Dragon full the cards you'd be spot one whoever spot two would be to handed out
40:42
you know in order and I kind of like do this snake around or whatever you want to call I think snakes yeah I think that's what they call it that's what we
40:49
do with our break tonight just a quick one and a little bit of adventuring while uh while we wandering the city
40:55
here oh we're not sure what's going to
41:01
happen where did I put the right where was
41:13
it ah there it is I think I got it there let me make sure it's right I
41:19
think it's right we'll find out am I going to have to bump into something in the Wasteland here and we'll uh either
41:26
way like I said so we'll finish it we'll start it out here um at 7 after our uh after the rocket goes off we added some
41:34
new stuff into the inventory you guys have a ton of singles in there so if you guys want any singles there's over a
41:40
thousand singles in there so I'm going to run you know what I'm going to do
41:47
this I forgot to put those in that stinks that's okay I forgot to put a
41:54
giveaway in so I'll throw one now
41:59
yeah so it's kind of like a little u i little Adventure D and D thing we get to do some of the people liked it when we
42:05
uh we played it one time a couple of times and then people kept gravitating towards it so I was like you know what
42:11
let's do it let's make it more
42:18
regular part of the thing yeah exactly kind of play uh
42:23
you're playing Fallout while waiting for the break which is going to be a fallout-esque break look at
42:30
that there we go we'll throw in a couple of those for our giveaway and you know
42:36
what we'll run one I remember uh so what I've been trying to do here I was wondering if I
42:42
could get this into I was looking into it I just don't have the time I want to take my uh game that I had made and
42:48
either because the D and D game I have the I made a campaign I want to put it into uh I was debating on putting it
42:54
into like a 2d game but going to take a little bit more time
43:00
than I want to than I had to spend to do it and that's the problem time once I
43:05

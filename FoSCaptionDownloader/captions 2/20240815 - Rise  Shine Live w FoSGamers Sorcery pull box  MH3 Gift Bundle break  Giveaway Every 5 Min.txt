[00:43:19] the rare that's in there we'll find
[00:43:23] out we'll find
[00:43:26] out all right we're at the skies we'll
[00:43:28] go

[00:43:32] know I have planner Nexus I feel like I
[00:43:37] do so I'm not going to need it again
[00:43:39] here if I have
[00:43:44] it I feel like I have it
[00:44:00] no no we'll throw that out
[00:44:02] there we'll throw that out there
[00:44:06] anyways see if anybody wants it because
[00:44:08] I'm probably not going to use
[00:44:12] that Arc deck would do wonders for
[00:44:15] me yes I know I have um I've been
[00:44:19] working on getting some of my stuff
[00:44:21] together for it so I can put stuff
[00:44:24] together into things and know what I
[00:44:25] need and know what I want
[00:44:29] makes it a little easier obviously but
[00:44:32] yeah not a bad that wasn't a bad pack
[00:44:35] there I mean not a great pack from
[00:44:36] Modern Horizon 3 but that wasn't a bad
[00:44:38] one all right Al righty then so this was
[00:44:44] our bundle in
[00:44:48] total so do we get our money back on the
[00:44:50] bundle which is about $150 now those are
[00:44:53] crazy that's crazy how much they are but
[00:44:56] hey that's how much they sell you4 we
[00:44:58] got starting out our first ones our
[00:45:01] first sides one of the things we open
[00:45:02] was the jet Medallion got the flare of
[00:45:05] cultivation we got the Nadu we got the
[00:45:08] air gas erupting null kite we got the
[00:45:11] volatile storm Drake Nadu winged wisdom

[00:45:27] orange chant flare of duplication and a
[00:45:30] springart NCO so with those I want to
[00:45:34] say I do think we um got
[00:45:39] duped by uh by Wizards there with our
[00:45:43] with our purchase what do you guys
[00:45:46] think yeah I think so Wizards if I had
[00:45:50] gotten that bundle and open that like
[00:45:52] bought it at a store uh and opened that
[00:45:55] one and I went home my kids open that
[00:45:57] and I wasn't opening on stream here I
[00:45:59] definitely would have been an upset an
[00:46:00] upset person but like
[00:46:02] seriously that's what you gave
[00:46:04] me they don't even give you all like see
[00:46:07] the thing that also is nice oop sorry
[00:46:08] sorry everyone the thing that's also
[00:46:10] annoying is they don't even give you
[00:46:11] like all foil or nice full art land
[00:46:13] cards no they're not full arts they give
[00:46:15] you the ones that are
[00:46:17] um that are the
[00:46:20] um like the regular standard basic
[00:46:24] lands basic art like seriously we spend
[00:46:28] a lot of money at least give us full
[00:46:31] arts right all right well anyways we got
[00:46:34] a few of those there I want to put some
[00:46:36] of them in top loaders just to have them
[00:46:38] protected then I'll be right back to you
[00:46:40] guys
[00:46:48] here because I do like those two car
[00:46:51] those few cards there and I want to
[00:46:52] protect those babies all right we'll put
[00:46:54] these over
[00:46:55] here yeah I know not bad not great I'd
[00:46:58] have to say uh I'd be pretty i' I'd be
[00:47:00] rather frustrated there on that one but
[00:47:02] hey I guess that's what happens
[00:47:05] sometimes you can't always you win some
[00:47:07] you lose some
[00:47:10] right well anyways now's the end of the

[00:59:30] right there let me get that running over
[00:59:31] there in the

[01:00:00] right
[01:00:01] here not
[01:00:06] those those we've gone through a few
[01:00:23] times I don't think I have much new
[01:00:25] stuff here
[01:00:33] here trying to figure out what we throw
[01:00:36] out for you
[01:00:38] all
[01:00:41] yeah yeah whatever I don't really have
[01:00:44] anything new to go on with I'm trying to
[01:00:46] think of the uh newer stuff that we
[01:00:47] might have I haven't had anything new
[01:00:49] for a little bit because we uh we were
[01:00:52] were stagnant on some of the singles so
[01:00:54] I guess I have to just going have to put
[01:00:56] them all out in the
[01:00:58] um on uh PCG is what my guess
[01:01:05] is there a lot of the ones that I have
[01:01:08] I've gone through a few times with you
[01:01:09] all so I don't get in a lot of new ones
[01:01:13] you see kind of what we open
[01:01:16] here but you know what maybe it's time
[01:01:19] that we
[01:01:22] uh see what we have here
[01:01:27] I put those out before yesterday no one
[01:01:30] wanted those I'm not going to put those
[01:01:32] ones out again
[01:01:35] see that we can use later that we can
[01:01:38] use
[01:01:39] later throughout the singles from
[01:01:43] here no one of those let's
[01:01:47] see what should we do what are you guys

[01:10:18] well today is a Wednesday it's one of
[01:10:21] those normal days that's like this on a
[01:10:23] regular so we're just trying to have
[01:10:26] a I have a question does PE do people
[01:10:29] want like say I have a
[01:10:31] question say I gave out a bunch of
[01:10:34] tokens say you guys need a stack of
[01:10:35] different tokens is that things that you
[01:10:37] would be intrigued
[01:10:38] in so I have like boxes of
[01:10:43] tokens I just have not
[01:10:48] uh gone through them
[01:10:51] all to organize them or anything like
[01:10:54] that
[01:10:59] just wondering if it was something that
[01:11:00] you'd be intrigued
[01:11:04] with yes all right maybe that's
[01:11:07] something I'll end up going through and
[01:11:08] getting a bunch of them together might
[01:11:11] take a since it's kind of going a slow
[01:11:13] day here I might end up just taking the
[01:11:14] rest of the day off and doing some of
[01:11:17] that stuff get some things
[01:11:20] organized trying to figure out what the
[01:11:22] [ __ ] I did with all my
[01:11:28] um
[01:11:29] raccoons so I had to build my deck oh I
[01:11:32] found
[01:11:34] them there we
[01:11:36] go how much for everybody lives it was
[01:11:40] up for
[01:11:43] $10 where everybody lives by the way
[01:12:03] ah found
[01:12:07] him I just kept all the raccoons for a
[01:12:10] little
[01:12:12] while would you like me to put it on to
[01:12:14] the
[01:12:16] side I can do that for you if you're
[01:12:18] intrigued in that card Mr fawn
[01:12:32] and those are all of our all right so
[01:12:34] should we I think that's what we might
[01:12:36] do today I got a stack of uh oh you've
[01:12:39] never seen it it's a doct to who all
[01:12:42] creatures gain hex proof and
[01:12:44] indestructible until end of turn players
[01:12:45] gain hex proof until end of turn players
[01:12:47] can't lose life this turn and players
[01:12:48] can't lose the game or win the game this
[01:12:50] turn it's a fun one
[01:13:04] all right I found him so I can start
[01:13:07] building the deck then I think maybe
[01:13:08] that's what I'll do
[01:13:10] today so we have all the cards that I
[01:13:13] think I was going to use bloomo maybe
[01:13:16] I'll have to find some others

Help me figure out how to talk in my one-on-one with a manager that has lied to me. He lied about what I took off for time and has broken company policy on time off telling me I nneed to take time in less than half day incremcents, even though I am salary and it says full day or half day only. Over the last few months he has harrassend me with saying I'm under the scope, he doesn't know what I do, he doesn't think I did anything all month, etc. He will even do similar things in front of team members. I need to address him about providing actionable expectations yet he will tell me I don't do anything when i can prove with my work I have. He sais teammates say the never know what im doing (I asked this was either false based on teammates responses or they did not say anything).

Addressing these concerns with your manager is crucial, especially since it involves potential violations of company policy and a negative work environment. Here's a systematic approach you can take for your one-on-one meeting:

### 1. Preparation
- **Document Everything:** Collect and organize evidence of your work, instances of harassment, false claims, and any correspondence that contradicts his statements. Include company policy documents related to time off.
- **Understand Company Policies:** Familiarize yourself thoroughly with the company's policies regarding time off, performance evaluation, and harassment.

### 2. Structure Your Conversation
- **Start with Positivity:** Begin the conversation on a positive note to set a constructive tone.
- **Present Facts and Evidence:** Clearly and calmly present the evidence you've gathered, focusing on facts rather than emotions.
- **Express Your Concerns:** Explain how the false claims and policy violations have impacted you and your work.

### 3. Key Points to Address
- **Clarify Time Off Policies:** 
  - "According to the company policy, as a salaried employee, my time off should be recorded in half-day or full-day increments. Could you please clarify why I was told otherwise?"
  - Present the documented policy and specific instances where you were asked to take time off in smaller increments.
- **Discuss False Claims:**
  - "There have been instances where it was stated that I took off more time than I actually did. Here is the documentation that shows the accurate record of my time off."
- **Seek Actionable Feedback:**
  - "I've been told that my contributions are unclear and that I'm not meeting expectations. Could you provide specific examples and actionable feedback on how I can improve?"
  - "I would like to establish clear goals and expectations moving forward to ensure my work aligns with team objectives."

### 4. Address Harassment and Miscommunication
- **Mention Team Dynamics:**
  - "There have been comments made in front of team members that suggest I am not contributing effectively. This affects team morale and my professional reputation. Can we discuss ways to improve our communication and ensure feedback is constructive and private?"
- **Ask About Alleged Team Feedback:**
  - "It was mentioned that team members are unaware of what I am doing. I've spoken to some teammates, and their responses don't align with this statement. Can we address how we can better communicate team roles and individual contributions?"

### 5. Propose Solutions
- **Regular Updates:**
  - "To improve transparency, I suggest implementing regular updates or meetings where we can discuss ongoing projects and individual contributions."
- **Clear Documentation:**
  - "It might be helpful to have a shared document or platform where team members can see what everyone is working on and their progress."

### 6. End on a Positive Note
- **Reiterate Your Commitment:**
  - "I am committed to improving and contributing positively to the team. I appreciate your feedback and am looking forward to working together to enhance our collaboration and productivity."

### 7. Follow Up
- **Send a Summary Email:**
  - After the meeting, send an email summarizing the discussion, any agreed actions, and your understanding of the next steps. This provides a written record and ensures clarity.

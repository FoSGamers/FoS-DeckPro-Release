[00:17:32] raise
[00:17:35] foil five to six five to 10 in the back
[00:17:38] all right five through 10 in the
[00:17:41] back on back back
[00:17:44] here one two three four
[00:17:48] five will be brave K
[00:17:52] Duo six tender wild guide all right I
[00:17:57] believe that one's a couple s I don't
[00:17:59] know how much that is might be a do a
[00:18:00] couple
[00:18:04] dollars
[00:18:08] 325 almost all right one two three five
[00:18:14] six
[00:18:18] seven and an
[00:18:22] eight all right five six seven eight
[00:18:26] right there
[00:18:29] five six seven eight so that's one of
[00:18:32] them now do we want to do our next one
[00:18:35] there for um we'll do
[00:18:39] nine is a tree card Duo 10 is a high
[00:18:44] stride now you've got two more where
[00:18:47] would you like to go with those two
[00:18:54] more all right so what you have is each
[00:18:58] one pull you either go up to $2 that you
[00:19:02] pull cards out up to $2 or you get eight
[00:19:04] plls all right so what we've been doing
[00:19:08] is giving him his multiple polls
[00:19:10] here because he has not been hitting the
[00:19:14] um the $2 hit amount does that make
[00:19:18] sense because you got to $2 uh if that
[00:19:21] makes sense for everybody
[00:19:24] there yes so it's pretty much you get up
[00:19:27] to $2 if if you pull out cards or you
[00:19:30] get up to eight pulls for $2 or you get
[00:19:34] and and whatever's in here you could get
[00:19:35] the play boosters or The Collector
[00:19:37] booster or the play booster times two
[00:19:40] yeah so that's kind of what it goes yeah
[00:19:42] the um the the uh if you read what the
[00:19:44] description says it has a good
[00:19:46] explanation of
[00:19:48] it so you've got um so you got two more
[00:19:52] to go to see where we go for these ones
[00:19:54] to see if you hit anything here your
[00:19:56] four out of this section here this so
[00:19:58] you can set part of this eight here
[00:20:00] because last time you hit a chunk of
[00:20:03] them so let me
[00:20:06] know up to dollar value of $2 or eight
[00:20:10] PS
[00:20:14] correct $2 or eight cards correct 10 of
[00:20:17] those which is $2 or eight cards
[00:20:20] correct so you have these you've got
[00:20:24] four more pulls after this because you
[00:20:26] pulled four out already yes does it make
[00:20:29] more I'm sorry like here the directions
[00:20:31] if you read the um the the um the show
[00:20:34] notes actually it explains it
[00:20:40] too no I got to put
[00:20:43] eight up to eight
[00:20:49] cards I adjusted it $2 or more
[00:20:53] otherwise is going to be 8
[00:20:56] cents and the ceiling will be 50 because
[00:20:59] you can possibly get two of
[00:21:02] those there you go that makes more sense
[00:21:04] for
[00:21:06] you all right hopefully that makes sense
[00:21:09] on how that is now if you have any
[00:21:11] questions let me know and let me know

[02:11:23] a little winter
[02:11:28] orb then we'll put the trinos spere out
[02:11:31] if anybody wants it now this one's a
[02:11:34] little bit more expensive I can't help
[02:11:35] it because whenever it goes over 20
[02:11:36] something doll it is that but hey this
[02:11:39] is a $29 card I'm going to put out for
[02:11:42] 23 get you pretty much free shipping
[02:11:46] there trinos spere
[02:11:52] Frank wanted um the secret layer I think
[02:11:55] cases boxes themselves a whole whole
[02:11:57] thing of the secret layer right if to
[02:11:59] open himself not just specific ones am I
[02:12:01] right on
[02:12:04] that yes so you can if you want any of
[02:12:07] these specific ones you can jump right
[02:12:08] on them a little sphere of
[02:12:15] resistance um I think this actually
[02:12:18] might be one of the cheaper ones quite
[02:12:19] frankly
[02:12:22] sphere resistance this might be one of
[02:12:24] the cheapest ones here I have to double
[02:12:27] check but I believe this would be one of
[02:12:29] the cheaper throw that out

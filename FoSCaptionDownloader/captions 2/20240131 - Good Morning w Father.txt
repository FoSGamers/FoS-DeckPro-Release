[00:29:30] is one from
[00:29:32] Nolan we
[00:29:35] have that there from Nolan and then I'm
[00:29:37] going to go through some of the singles

[00:29:41] deals running all right I'll scroll

[00:29:46] we'll see what happens all right
[00:29:48] everybody if you want any of the singles
[00:29:50] this is how we do it here I kind of have

[00:29:53] you want to jump in on that pack deal
[00:29:54] you just jump in and say you want it it
[00:29:56] is a sudden death cuz I'm okay with it

[00:30:09] leave I'll tally it up for you and these
[00:30:11] are pretty close to the price sometimes
[00:30:13] they're off by a little bit just because
[00:30:15] uh when I open a pack is when I put the

[00:33:31] having a good Tuesday morning just kind
[00:33:33] of doing my singles thing scrolling
[00:33:34] through what I have and talking about uh
[00:33:38] what happens to be going on I had some
[00:33:40] technical difficulties this morning and
[00:33:42] I realized I don't think it was my I
[00:33:44] don't think it actually was my stuff I
[00:33:46] think it may have been whatnot getting
[00:33:47] some
[00:33:48] glitches so I had to uh I had to do some
[00:33:51] restarts on all of my I had like
[00:33:53] literally shut down my
[00:33:55] entire um Chrome
[00:33:57] and I ended up re um like clearing out
[00:34:00] the cash from like the last like 3 days
[00:34:02] or something like that to get it to work
[00:34:05] but if anybody wants any of these let me
[00:34:06] know I'm going to put those back to the
[00:34:10] beginning here and this is our beginning
[00:34:12] ones we are at the beginning I'm going
[00:34:14] to go into uh the next set of them here
[00:34:17] if you want them going to keep scrolling
[00:34:18] through them but yeah oh they did an
[00:34:21] update maybe that's what it was it was
[00:34:23] up was still open from the last time
[00:34:24] that I had cuz I hadn't reset my um
[00:34:27] computer and the screen was still open
[00:34:29] so I wonder if that's what it was they
[00:34:31] did an update and my screen was open and
[00:34:34] it hadn't been like a I mean like my
[00:34:36] window was open so it was still on it
[00:34:38] and it hadn't like refreshed to the new
[00:34:39] thing that might been been what it was
[00:34:41] Dash thank you that could make some
[00:34:44] sense so I think maybe every morning I
[00:34:45] got to make sure I just flat out restart
[00:34:48] all of uh Chrome I can't leave it open
[00:34:52] and have it up there cuz how whatnot
[00:34:53] does updates these are just singles if
[00:34:55] anybody wants them just yell them out
[00:34:56] out and I'll put them out to the side
[00:34:57] with your name on them or uh so do it
[00:35:00] right away or um the other thing we can
[00:35:02] do like I say to everyone is these are
[00:35:04] just I'll do them at the end of this at
[00:35:06] the end of the stream I'll add up
[00:35:07] whatever you got and if you want uh I
[00:35:10] mean we'll find I'll add everything up
[00:35:12] so that way you're not paying um
[00:35:15] shipping for like 50 different shipping

[00:35:19] or two of them you know make it a little
[00:35:21] bit better for you but I'm going to keep

[00:35:47] few cards I still I don't understand how
[00:35:49] it hasn't been pulled out personally and
[00:35:51] I think there's some Jurassic Park cards
[00:35:52] that are left in there there might be
[00:35:54] one left in there but anyways I'm going
[00:35:55] to keep scrolling through this here
[00:35:58] I cut out for a second no like I whole
[00:36:02] thing cut out or is it just like it
[00:36:03] froze am I good
[00:36:05] now
[00:36:06] explore cuz if I cut out for a second I
[00:36:09] might need to end up having to I'm good
[00:36:10] now all right I might need end up having
[00:36:11] to restart my whole uh computer I mean
[00:36:14] my whole internet connection today at
[00:36:16] some point because that will mean I'm
[00:36:18] wondering if somebody's been messing
[00:36:19] with the internet in their area cuz
[00:36:21] we're getting a lot of construction
[00:36:22] around us and every time there's
[00:36:24] construction there's always headaches
[00:36:27] with internet like people cut lines one
[00:36:30] time when uh like two years ago when we
[00:36:33] first moved in I lost internet I work
[00:36:36] from home so I need it I I work I'm like
[00:36:37] I I called I'm like there guys what
[00:36:39] happened internet's gone like oh yeah uh
[00:36:41] there's construction going on I think
[00:36:42] somebody said they cut a line we're
[00:36:43] going to fix it right now like seriously
[00:36:46] like the people not paying attention to
[00:36:47] what they're doing so we got a bunch of
[00:36:49] foils extended Arts animes stuff like
[00:36:52] that but let me know if you want any
[00:36:53] I'll put it off to the side with your
[00:36:54] name on
[00:36:55] it we got a pack deal that's on there

[00:37:00] pull box has the call th MP tyrant in
[00:37:02] there the borderless one if you still
[00:37:04] want it and I believe there is a couple
[00:37:06] of Jurassic Park cards left in
[00:37:09] there I don't know if they're the high
[00:37:11] value ones CU I think those ones may
[00:37:13] have been P pulled out but there are
[00:37:14] still some Jurassic Park ones in
[00:37:16] there there we go keep going through
[00:37:20] that dude I know they're supposed to
[00:37:23] call it but hey you know what I don't
[00:37:25] think they um I don't think people down
[00:37:27] here in Florida do everything they're
[00:37:28] supposed to I will say that I mean you
[00:37:31] got the Florida man stuff and that only

[00:39:13] that's a really sweet card for elves if
[00:39:15] you have an elves deck I mean that's a
[00:39:17] sick card for an elves
[00:39:19] deck but uh those are the three I think
[00:39:22] those are the three green that I had oh
[00:39:24] wait no I did have explore surge foil
[00:39:26] which is you may play an additional land
[00:39:28] this turn and draw a
[00:39:30] card
[00:39:33] um I think that was the only other
[00:39:36] straight green ones that I
[00:39:40] had yeah those are the other straight
[00:39:42] the only specific green
[00:39:46] ones you'll take that to the
[00:39:51] pot you'll take that to the pile okay so
[00:39:54] you want to put the Explorer or the um
[00:39:57] Heritage Druid and I'll put it off the
[00:39:58] name with your name on it
[00:40:00] mutant explore all right explore explore
[00:40:03] surge foil I'll put that off the side
[00:40:05] I'll put a little bag with your name on
[00:40:07] it and then at the end of the show like
[00:40:08] I said we'll tally everything up and um
[00:40:13] see what you got and then or if you end
[00:40:15] up having to leave we'll do the same
[00:40:16] thing but let me do that and put your
[00:40:18] name on that no one want that pack deal
[00:40:20] which is okay so not everybody is a big
[00:40:22] fan of the uh the who of the doctor so
[00:40:25] let me um let me get your name written
[00:40:29] here mutant tror mutant Raptor oh mutant
[00:40:35] Raptor
[00:40:37] mutant
[00:40:42] Raptor now are you uh mutant because uh
[00:40:46] because of games you play or or is it
[00:40:50] just uh the name you came up with just
[00:40:52] happen to be the name you came up with
[00:40:54] that's that there I'm going to put it
[00:40:55] off the side here with your name on it
[00:40:57] because I know people have a uh their
[00:40:59] things they do like with games and their
[00:41:00] gamer tags but I I know that sounds like
[00:41:03] something that would come from like uh
[00:41:04] playing like Fallout which I'm extremely
[00:41:06] excited I probably went a little too big
[00:41:08] in on it but who cares I end I think I
[00:41:10] ended up getting three
[00:41:12] cases so hopefully hopefully people are
[00:41:15] a fan of Fallout here cuz that was one
[00:41:17] of my favorite show favorite um games
[00:41:20] growing up and the show that they have
[00:41:21] coming out I think is going to be pretty
[00:41:23] cool I mean the show they have coming
[00:41:25] out it looks like it's be pretty cool
[00:41:26] even though I even though like uh you
[00:41:29] know it's it's Amazon they can be
[00:41:31] iffy um they can be iffy on some of the
[00:41:34] times in their shows this one has been
[00:41:36] looking pretty good and I'm excited
[00:41:37] about it one two three one two three one
[00:41:42] two3 G3 we're going to do this for a
[00:41:44] pack deal from
[00:41:47] William all right that's a William pack
[00:41:49] deal right
[00:41:51] here we're going to try to find a uh
[00:41:54] some shockland and um uh some troms is
[00:41:57] what we're going after I guess right
[00:41:59] here William
[00:42:00] decided yeah the uh the TV show looks
[00:42:03] pretty interesting I mean I've never um
[00:42:05] have you guys did you ever watch that um
[00:42:07] TV show oh it was the one with the video
[00:42:09] game a while ago um they made a video
[00:42:12] game with it at the same time the video
[00:42:14] game wasn't bad it was an online video
[00:42:15] game uh it was a Sci-Fi show damn what
[00:42:19] was the name of it no not last of us it
[00:42:22] was like four years ago the literally
[00:42:24] the video game you played the video game
[00:42:26] and parts of the video game were going
[00:42:28] on in the show at the time oh all right
[00:42:32] I got to look this up hold
[00:42:39] on uh it
[00:42:45] was Defiance
[00:42:48] Defiance
[00:42:50] Defiance Defiance yes that's what it was
[00:42:54] yes if you remember that that wasn't n
[00:42:56] horrible it wasn't great but it wasn't
[00:42:58] horrible like if they had somebody with
[00:43:00] like money like they had from um like
[00:43:02] Amazon money they could have done a good
[00:43:04] job with that yes it just didn't take
[00:43:06] off exactly it didn't take off it wasn't
[00:43:09] a bad show and the game wasn't that bad
[00:43:11] either I played the the game too and the
[00:43:13] game was pretty
[00:43:16] entertaining exactly it was a decent
[00:43:18] game it just didn't take off exactly
[00:43:20] like it just they had they had a good
[00:43:22] they had a good idea it just was like
[00:43:25] they needed um
[00:43:26] I feel like they needed somebody with an
[00:43:28] Amazon that could come out with like a
[00:43:30] Fallout game with Amazon and like a and
[00:43:34] that would work it was a free-to-play
[00:43:36] game too and that was the best part
[00:43:38] about it guys you bought the game you
[00:43:40] would buy if you wanted to get an
[00:43:41] expansion you bought the expansion but
[00:43:43] everything else was free to play and
[00:43:45] that was a sick part about it yes I love
[00:43:47] that about that game and like they shut
[00:43:49] it down a while ago I can't remember
[00:43:51] when they shut it down but I was very
[00:43:53] upset about that cuz I played that every
[00:43:54] now and again I jump on every now and
[00:43:56] again cuz you could do it and I didn't
[00:43:57] worry about doing it cuz you could it
[00:43:58] was free to play and you could jump in
[00:44:00] every now and again but then they
[00:44:01] changed that and I was like a damn it
[00:44:03] that
[00:44:05] sucks yeah exactly you could spend money
[00:44:08] if you wanted to buy like um this was
[00:44:10] like the one of the first versions of
[00:44:12] like microtransactions
[00:44:16] actually I think that's why maybe that's
[00:44:18] why it wasn't a successful thing it was
[00:44:20] one of the first microtransaction
[00:44:22] versions where you would buy um either
[00:44:24] armor or gear or um things like that or
[00:44:28] weapons yeah so it was like one of those
[00:44:30] first ones of that I wonder if that's
[00:44:32] why it didn't take off so much because
[00:44:34] now people like microtransaction
[00:44:36] whatever like if they threw it out now
[00:44:38] in a better version like an updated
[00:44:40] thing I feel like they they could do
[00:44:41] really really well especially with it
[00:44:43] being free yes it was online yeah yep
[00:44:47] online free uh once you I mean you
[00:44:49] bought the game but everything else was
[00:44:51] online free and you could download a
[00:44:53] free version of it too which is a very
[00:44:55] based version which had like nothing but
[00:44:57] you could still play it with people if
[00:44:58] you wanted 's prawler so I'm just kind
[00:45:01] of scrolling through these or if you
[00:45:03] need to leave you can just say hey I
[00:45:04] gotta go can you tally up what I got
[00:45:07] yeah dude that was actually a pretty
[00:45:08] good game I liked it and this is the
[00:45:09] pack deal that we got going on right
[00:45:11] here now picked out by uh Nolan side
[00:45:14] here we have a commander Masters set
[00:45:16] Ravnica draft and an Exxon draft but
[00:45:19] yeah I played that for I played that for
[00:45:21] a little while and then I I kind of just
[00:45:24] I can't remember what happened I kind of
[00:45:25] stopped playing video games for a bit I
[00:45:26] got into flying drones I think that's
[00:45:28] what it was I started flying drones and
[00:45:31] with the flying drones I spent all my
[00:45:33] money on that like doing racing drones
[00:45:35] and then uh medical stuff and now here I
[00:45:40] am in
[00:45:41] Florida but this is kind of what we got
[00:45:43] for singles just kind of scrolling
[00:45:44] through them if you want any of them let
[00:45:46] me know I'll put it out to the side with
[00:45:48] your name on it and uh we can tally it
[00:45:50] up at the end of the show or when you
[00:45:52] need to leave and that's our pack deal
[00:45:54] at the moment if anybody wants it picked
[00:45:55] out by Nolan so he has some he says he's
[00:45:57] got hot hands that's what he feels is
[00:45:59] for the heat he goes around he touches
[00:46:01] he feels for heat and he picked out 10
[00:46:02] different Pacos for you guys
[00:46:05] today him and will last night they said
[00:46:08] they were going to pick out some good
[00:46:10] luck stuff so we doing some random pack
[00:46:12] deals that they got and I'm going
[00:46:14] through the singles that I have and if
[00:46:16] you want them you say you want them if
[00:46:18] you want the pack deal you say you SL
[00:46:19] slide your finger across and then on the
[00:46:22] singles we do a deal we we add them all
[00:46:24] up and then uh find kind of a good price
[00:46:26] amicable price that everybody agrees on
[00:46:28] we go with that one two
[00:46:31] three we're going to go
[00:46:34] with let's do one of these ones I think
[00:46:37] this is one yes this is one we're going
[00:46:39] to do this
[00:46:40] one oh look at that just slid down a
[00:46:43] little hole there didn't know we're
[00:46:45] going to do a look for some
[00:46:47] triom and some dragons here and a
[00:46:50] collector maybe a big dragon there I
[00:46:53] think that's kind of a nice not a bad
[00:46:55] one there from Willam will and this is
[00:46:57] just literally random packs that they're
[00:46:59] picking that they touch and they're like
[00:47:00] oh I like this one this one feels good
[00:47:03] so I mean it could be a good luck one
[00:47:04] could be not but you know kids have luck
[00:47:06] I feel I tell you guys kids pass the
[00:47:08] luck from the kids steal the luck from
[00:47:10] the parents as soon as they have them
[00:47:12] all right so just kind of still
[00:47:13] scrolling through here but yeah we
[00:47:16] talking about how video games and TV
[00:47:17] shows are some of them are pretty good
[00:47:19] I'm looking forward to the um Fallout TV
[00:47:21] show and with the Fallout uh new Fallout
[00:47:24] game coming out too I mean version of
[00:47:25] the game coming out too I feel like
[00:47:27] that's going to be a pretty good option
[00:47:28] pretty big uh pretty big
[00:47:31] um possibility here so I I went in kind
[00:47:34] of big so you guys are aware if you want
[00:47:36] to jump come in and try me out well when
[00:47:39] we're here is I I jumped in big and I
[00:47:41] got uh three cases of um Fallout so
[00:47:47] we'll see if I uh made a mistake on that
[00:47:49] one or not I feel like I did not make a
[00:47:52] mistake but then again my prediction
[00:47:54] skills are not always the best they are
[00:47:56] pretty good generally though but I was
[00:47:58] predicting it was going to be good
[00:47:59] especially with the TV show and the
[00:48:02] video games how big the video games were
[00:48:03] so that was why I went big with the
[00:48:05] Fallout game here but I'm going to
[00:48:07] probably my luck I'm going to end up
[00:48:09] that'll be the first one that I have to
[00:48:10] eat eat but here we go those are the
[00:48:14] singles for those dollar ones the chunk

[00:55:01] card that was a nice pack right there
[00:55:05] also dude let's get this luck keep going
[00:55:07] all right and I'm going to do this cuz I
[00:55:09] like we do this try to protect it right
[00:55:10] away and also because with shipping I
[00:55:13] like to have them they're a little bit
[00:55:14] stiffer with shipping if we do this this
[00:55:16] way so I'm going to put it in a top
[00:55:18] loader for
[00:55:19] you that was a sweet pack also farewell
[00:55:23] and that aith wedding
[00:55:27] ring nice hits there let me do this let
[00:55:29] me put your farewell in here like I said
[00:55:31] I like to do these to keep things stiff
[00:55:33] for
[00:55:34] shipping so let's do
[00:55:40] that put that
[00:55:43] there nice hit
[00:55:47] dude and if somebody doesn't want me to
[00:55:49] do this for whatever reason that's fine
[00:55:51] but I I found out that um if I do it
[00:55:53] like this they don't bend
[00:55:55] as much when you kind of ship them cuz
[00:55:57] sometimes if they like you get them
[00:55:58] shipped they'll like kind of bend a
[00:55:59] little bit and I like that they keep
[00:56:01] them stiffer all right here we go good
[00:56:03] luck good luck Dash let's get you a
[00:56:05] cereal all right dash yes hey um Dash

[01:00:19] here my
[01:00:21] computer ah I know what wrong
[01:00:38] there you
[01:00:43] go all right sorry about
[01:00:48] that my work computer stopped for some
[01:00:51] reason and I had to make sure it turned
[01:00:52] back on cuz I work from home but I start
[01:00:54] like I get on at like early in the
[01:00:56] morning and I start my computer like way
[01:00:57] earlier than I'm supposed to work and I
[01:00:59] get a lot of my stuff done and then I
[01:01:01] have to wait until all my meetings start
[01:01:02] at 9:00 a.m. which is kind of what I do
[01:01:04] now that's why I hang out with you guys
[01:01:06] but I need to make sure my word computer
[01:01:08] stays on in case there's any technical
[01:01:10] problems being the IT person that if
[01:01:12] that happens I will have to cancel the
[01:01:14] show right away or stop the show right
[01:01:16] away and go over and uh take care of
[01:01:18] business is really what it is but so
[01:01:21] far I do check everything in the morning
[01:01:23] to make sure there's no ISS before I
[01:01:24] start a show and do one of those you
[01:01:27] know prepare prepare yourself but that
[01:01:30] was weird my computer shut off and I
[01:01:32] have it set so it doesn't shut off and I
[01:01:34] know why it's because I unplugged the
[01:01:36] mouse yesterday to use it for something
[01:01:37] else and I forgot to plug it back
[01:01:39] in there Dash nice hits there
[01:01:43] Dash all righty those are some good hits
[01:01:46] and this is what we're going to do we're
[01:01:46] going to put Nolan's pack deal back and
[01:01:48] I'm going to get and see if we can h a
[01:01:50] pack deal for a William I have AA I do
[01:01:54] do
[01:01:56] orela I do have
[01:01:59] Aela but
[01:02:02] orela is the foil
[01:02:05] aa oh you have her serialized oh I'm
[01:02:09] jealous I'm jealous see my serialized
[01:02:12] one that we have this is the serialized
[01:02:15] one that we
[01:02:16] got so this is what we got for serialize
[01:02:19] out of one of our cases so we we pulled
[01:02:21] a we pulled a serialize for somebody and
[01:02:23] then I happened to keep one of the boxes
[01:02:25] and we got to serialize ourselves yeah
[01:02:27] dude it's a low number too number 33 we
[01:02:30] were pretty happy about that yeah yeah
[01:02:33] so I'm holding I was debating on getting
[01:02:34] that one even graded I was debating on
[01:02:37] sending that one in to get graded
[01:02:39] because it's uh my son is a dragon deck
[01:02:41] person and I'm a dragon person myself so
[01:02:45] that's kind of what I was thinking
[01:02:47] about I'm going to do this here let's do
[01:02:50] this for a pack deal this is a William
[01:02:52] pack deal let's see if he has any good
[01:02:53] luck compared to um compared to Nolan
[01:02:55] all right and I'll look at some singles
[01:02:57] as we uh do like we did before he have
[01:03:00] we have a my last ET internal Masters
[01:03:03] now we have not had anything super big
[01:03:05] pulled out that we've had a couple
[01:03:06] decent cards but nothing over the top um
[01:03:09] there is a collector booster of Doctor
[01:03:12] Who and a
[01:03:15] ravnik uh draft here and this is going
[01:03:18] to go on
[01:03:20] for if you want it yeah I know uh Dr
[01:03:25] poop penstein Why Wayne we're going to
[01:03:28] go into our um keep going through our
[01:03:30] singles here the dollar ones until I get
[01:03:32] to the next level and I'll look through
[01:03:34] those but yeah dude uh some of those my
[01:03:37] sons have been getting some good luck
[01:03:38] with these I guess they have uh I say
[01:03:41] that they passed I passed the luck from
[01:03:42] me to them cuz I had some good luck when
[01:03:44] I was younger and I was able to like
[01:03:48] live through events that I probably
[01:03:50] shouldn't have we'll put it that way
[01:03:52] that's why I had good luck when I was
[01:03:53] younger cuz because I I was able to live
[01:03:55] through some events I probably shouldn't
[01:03:56] have that's that's why and with that
[01:03:58] being said
[01:04:01] um my lock is now gone because my
[01:04:03] children have it now every time anything
[01:04:04] could possibly happen where I get
[01:04:06] injured I'm injured but then again I'm
[01:04:08] also older so I can't like my strength I
[01:04:11] guess is not the same to be able to uh
[01:04:14] control my abilities that I used to
[01:04:16] thought I could to the I like that one
[01:04:18] no one ever likes this one but I like
[01:04:20] that planes
[01:04:22] Walker you may activate ability
[01:04:24] creatures you control as though those
[01:04:25] creatures had haste untap Target
[01:04:28] creature you know it's not bad there
[01:04:30] kenrith return King s in and back I
[01:04:33] think we're going to get back to the
[01:04:34] beginning here in a second here but
[01:04:36] these are the signals here and like I
[01:04:38] say these fluctuate somebody made the
[01:04:39] comment they fluctuate like gold so uh
[01:04:42] if you uh see the price is different
[01:04:45] that's because it's different than when
[01:04:46] I originally wrote it on there from when
[01:04:47] I opened the pack all right that's what
[01:04:50] I had there for some of the singles this
[01:04:51] is that pack deal it looks like no one
[01:04:53] wants Williams pack deal so I will put
[01:04:55] that
[01:04:56] back and I am going to go with
[01:05:01] uh this
[01:05:04] here and put that back and I'm going to
[01:05:06] grab another one of Nolan's pack deals
[01:05:08] out actually you know what this is
[01:05:11] Nolan's pack deal that we're putting out

[01:05:14] try for that big luck one for that Lotus
[01:05:17] we get a couple options for a Lotus and
[01:05:20] a and an option for a triome
[01:05:23] there
[01:05:24] maybe maybe we can get lucky and get
[01:05:27] two I've only seen one load is pulled
[01:05:29] out of a draft I mean a set pack and it
[01:05:32] wasn't even me it was on another channel
[01:05:34] so I don't know let's see what happens
[01:05:35] and I'm going to go through my next
[01:05:36] level singles here just kind of scroll

[01:15:42] here we're going to go with
[01:15:45] this and this is going to

[01:16:02] here oh nice Malcolm if anybody wants uh
[01:16:05] their their
[01:16:07] uh special guest but yeah it's like it's
[01:16:10] it sucks when you don't have the luck
[01:16:12] but everybody else around you does and
[01:16:14] they open your
[01:16:16] stuff to get the luck it's like come on
[01:16:20] can I at least open it I mean at least
[01:16:22] you feel good that you were the that
[01:16:23] bought the box kind of type thing but at
[01:16:27] the same time it's like
[01:16:30] really but I'm going to put all these
[01:16:32] off to the side for you if you want them
[01:16:34] let me know these just scrolling through
[01:16:36] the singles and this is the pack deal on
[01:16:39] the back here if you want it collector
[01:16:40] booster of ravika Nixon draft and then
[01:16:43] aoria draft let's go after a couple
[01:16:45] maybe some shocks and some triom and a
[01:16:48] Manor or something like that Caverns I
[01:16:52] haven't pulled pulled anything big out
[01:16:53] of any of the draft boosters recently so
[01:16:56] maybe we can get some luck with that but
[01:16:59] I'll put back these singles and um as
[01:17:01] people say I've been I think it was a
[01:17:03] Big Mac was the one that told me this
[01:17:05] these fluctuate like gold so I put the
[01:17:08] price on them that they were when I
[01:17:10] first pulled them out of the pack if
[01:17:12] they have changed they have changed I'm
[01:17:14] not going to keep going through them all
[01:17:16] but um I can adjust the biggest hit I
[01:17:19] ever had was a shatter glass foil which
[01:17:20] was oh nice
[01:17:28] oh wow that sucks that sucks I hate when
[01:17:30] that happens yeah that's TR try to get
[01:17:32] rid of them as quick as possible a lot
[01:17:34] all right no one wanted that pack deal
[01:17:36] so I'll put this
[01:17:39] back I got to figure out why my pack
[01:17:42] deals were all messed
[01:17:44] up that makes
[01:17:48] sense that makes
[01:17:52] sense
[01:17:54] that makes sense let's do this one for a
[01:17:56] pack deal let's do this for a pack deal
[01:17:59] actually let's go after uh let's go have
[01:18:02] some triom or maybe a Godzilla some
[01:18:04] dinosaurs and uh or maybe caverns and
[01:18:06] maybe uh some good dragons here
[01:18:09] something a little on the low side this
[01:18:12] morning try something out there and then
[01:18:14] I'll keep scrolling through my
[01:18:17] singles yeah the employee bought from
[01:18:20] what not checking
[01:18:21] there
[01:18:25] and then I put the cards up yeah yeah
[01:18:28] yeah that's kind of what you do oh I got
[01:18:31] in L Conor on release day and I have a
[01:18:34] box actually that I'm never going to
[01:18:35] open it's been sitting there I bought it
[01:18:37] it's sealed it's never going to be open
[01:18:40] just because um it's one of those things
[01:18:42] like I feel like it's a Disney thing
[01:18:44] Disney things are crazy I'm never going
[01:18:46] to open that I'm going to have it sit in
[01:18:48] anything thing forever until like my
[01:18:50] I'll give it to my kids at some point
[01:18:51] you know but then I did buy either boxes
[01:18:54] that we play with we open and we play a
[01:18:56] lot I actually um I need to get a better
[01:18:58] resource for lurana so I can do lurana
[01:19:00] streams because I would very much love
[01:19:02] to do lorana streams I just don't have
[01:19:04] the resources for it on a regular basis
[01:19:08] so like like nobody has it that I'm
[01:19:10] buying from and I don't want to buy them
[01:19:12] on Amazon at full price and sell it you
[01:19:18] know never bought in the game so much
[01:19:21] money yeah exactly you never thought a
[01:19:24] game would be so much money in the 90s
[01:19:25] when it came to like this too yeah who
[01:19:28] thought who would have thought when you
[01:19:30] were um flicking your cards around or
[01:19:32] you were shuffling with no sleeves on
[01:19:34] that that uh card was going to be like a
[01:19:36] $900 card when you were an adult you
[01:19:38] know no one thinks about that it's a 50
[01:19:40] Cent card and like think about the
[01:19:42] baseball cards or the basketball cards
[01:19:44] or whatever that you ruined that would
[01:19:46] have been like hundreds of dollars
[01:19:48] now
[01:19:51] right because I know I've done that
[01:19:59] before all
[01:20:02] right yep exactly 23 it'll open and sold
[01:20:05] exactly all right here we go we're going
[01:20:07] to do another pack

[01:21:12] card just because I'm halfway through
[01:21:14] the box there's four
[01:21:16] packs actually three left I think of the
[01:21:19] rabn from the last box that are in the
[01:21:21] pack deals
[01:21:23] which would mean I'm only on the there's
[01:21:24] only two boxes left here that could
[01:21:26] possibly give you a uh serialized card
[01:21:29] out of it and I have not pulled any out
[01:21:31] of this case yet so I don't know unless
[01:21:34] I get no serialized card in the case how
[01:21:37] much is the roaming Throne yeah Bullseye

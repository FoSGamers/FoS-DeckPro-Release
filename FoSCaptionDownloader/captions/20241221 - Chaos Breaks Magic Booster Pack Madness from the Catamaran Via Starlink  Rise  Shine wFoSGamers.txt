[00:01:54] now without music in the background or
[00:01:57] can you hear the music in the background

[00:02:07] I think you can hear it a lot
[00:02:09] there mix audio hide yeah we can hear it
[00:02:12] all in
[00:02:14] there can you hear it a lot boat life
[00:02:18] can you hear it music is can you hear it
[00:02:21] like really well though because I'm not

[00:02:24] only supposed to be uh like there isn't
[00:02:27] supposed to be any music coming in right
[00:02:30] right now let me see if I can
[00:02:32] um figure out what's going on
[00:02:36] here and I think I need to do this ad
[00:02:40] Source
[00:02:43] video audio input and this is going to
[00:02:46] be the um
[00:02:50] [Music]
[00:02:56] Sony available
[00:02:58] already no that's
[00:03:01] Sony
[00:03:04] mik default it's the ZM
[00:03:07] ZM all right audio I think that will be
[00:03:11] better and here how is that I think
[00:03:13] that's better without hearing the stuff
[00:03:14] in the background as much definitely
[00:03:16] lower than it was but still here I'm
[00:03:18] jamming all right I think we can I think
[00:03:19] we can do better here cuz if I have that

[00:47:59] thank you look at that thank you kindly
[00:48:02] everybody well look at that here we
[00:48:06] go so it seems like he does not mind
[00:48:09] keeping he does not need that that card
[00:48:12] he says so with the fact that he says he
[00:48:15] does not he has dragons and he's like I
[00:48:17] have dragon decks so it's not a dragon
[00:48:19] for my deck so I guess he says he
[00:48:21] doesn't seem to need the card so we'll
[00:48:23] do that for um I think this is a $17
[00:48:25] card give me one second and if it is I
[00:48:27] will put that right on there for you and
[00:48:29] I don't mind if you get that my friend

[00:48:34] it it's whether he wants it or not okay
[00:48:36] give me one sec
[00:48:38] there all right let me check it I think
[00:48:41] can get this on here and I do believe
[00:48:43] it's 17 for that one but let me double
[00:48:46] check
[00:48:48] Godzilla
[00:48:51] Doom
[00:48:53] inevitable

[00:48:59] one it's 74 for the foil it's 17 for the
[00:49:05] nonfoil yeah

[00:53:07] second here let's do um what is it
[00:53:10] um oh MTG
[00:53:15] stocks I think that's what it is
[00:53:17] mtgstocks.com because it pulls it from

[00:53:21] for me to see them
[00:53:23] all there we go let's see if that'll
[00:53:25] pull it up there
[00:53:26] maybe that's not the right

[01:19:23] soon
[01:19:25] doing it we are streaming for all you
[01:19:26] that don't know we are streaming from my
[01:19:28] boat live via starlink doing our in Pack
[01:19:32] openings and if you guys want to do some
[01:19:34] adventuring we can do some adventuring
[01:19:36] too always listen to peer
[01:19:39] pressure right type I know is this the
[01:19:42] first person that streams from I don't
[01:19:44] know I think I I think I might be the
[01:19:46] first person streaming what from
[01:19:48] Starling actually on a boat doing this
[01:19:51] period in the world I think I might be
[01:19:53] the first person yeah to do that
[01:19:56] actually think about I don't think
[01:19:56] there's anybody in the world that's used
[01:19:58] starlink on their boat to do
[01:19:59] thisi who said anything about a Lotus we
[01:20:02] don't really need a Lotus when you're
[01:20:03] getting stuff like that
[01:20:04] up I mean I cause like to get three more
[01:20:08] and then the Lotus
[01:20:13] comes yeah yeah yeah I know we'll see
[01:20:15] we'll see what you guys want here but if
[01:20:17] you want me to I can throw some out
[01:20:20] there starlink is pretty good um so far
[01:20:24] as you can see we're doing all right um
[01:20:25] for the most part I do my shows in the
[01:20:27] morning and I guess it it gets busier in
[01:20:29] the evening and Starling will break down
[01:20:30] sometimes but we don't have a lot of
[01:20:32] people around here right now so that's
[01:20:34] one of the nice benefits of this being
[01:20:35] not have being like I'm not in like a
[01:20:37] city like you know in California or the
[01:20:39] United States where we're in a city and

[01:49:30] again it depends on what I need to get
[01:49:32] done I actually ended up I thought I had
[01:49:34] to do some stuff with propane yesterday
[01:49:36] because it wasn't working right away
[01:49:37] dumbass me turn in the Pro turn the
[01:49:39] valve on the propane off cuz I thought
[01:49:41] they I thought they had left it off when
[01:49:42] they Tri tripped it over to us so I
[01:49:44] turned it off thinking the propane was
[01:49:46] off well no the propane was not off the
[01:49:48] propane was on and I turned it off which
[01:49:51] is why we weren't getting any propane
[01:49:52] yesterday to our uh our stove our oven
[01:49:56] top until you fig it until I figured out
[01:49:58] a you're a dumbass you just turned it
[01:49:59] off cuz I couldn't I couldn't read the
[01:50:01] top of it well cuz it's so corroded like
[01:50:03] kind of the bottles are a little bit
[01:50:04] corroded on the top cuz you know Salt
[01:50:06] Air so I'm looking at I'm like oh all
[01:50:07] right that's um all right that says
[01:50:10] whatever it says there you know looking
[01:50:11] at it and I turned it I thought I turned
[01:50:13] it so it said it was open but the arrow
[01:50:15] was showing the other way and I had like
[01:50:16] I had to like take my glasses off and go
[01:50:17] like down this close to look at the
[01:50:19] thing because I'm like this seems wrong
[01:50:21] yeah yeah yeah exactly they do get nasty
[01:50:24] so that's why I was like oh crap and
[01:50:25] then I figured out what it was like oh
[01:50:26] well that works out that worked out well
[01:50:28] you know hey hallucination Studios
[01:50:31] thanks for coming in hanging out we do
[01:50:32] appreciate that you got to show them
[01:50:33] this one oh yeah here's something cool
[01:50:35] all right so these I have not seen in
[01:50:38] the United States for
[01:50:40] probably 20ish Years Around in New
[01:50:43] England or Florida where I am they might
[01:50:44] be in Florida and some random stores but
[01:50:46] that this is what my dad used to buy all
[01:50:48] the time there's four pieces he'd buy
[01:50:49] one he'd offer one to my mom my sister
[01:50:51] and I generally it was just my eye
[01:50:53] myself and I my dad that took it so I
[01:50:55] like that was like weird cuz I haven't
[01:50:57] seen him since be before he passed away
[01:50:59] and we were literally getting our first
[01:51:01] provisioning for the first day on our
[01:51:02] boat and that was sitting right at the
[01:51:03] counter I'm like wow that is going to be
[01:51:05] one of the weirdest things in the
[01:51:08] world oh yeah it was my dad's favorite
[01:51:10] candy yeah like I can't find him
[01:51:12] anywhere I've never I haven't seen him
[01:51:14] in the US for years like since my dad
[01:51:16] passed away probably almost 20 years
[01:51:17] between of all like the random stores
[01:51:19] and like that was the first time I had
[01:51:21] gotten one and for ever I know it's down
[01:51:23] here in St Thomas at one of the places

[00:00:01] uh we weren't on the other day uh last
[00:00:04] couple days we had some weird weather
[00:00:06] the uh we had well not really weird
[00:00:08] fronts coming into the to Florida here
[00:00:11] and it was pushing uh we had some bad we
[00:00:13] had some bad winds and some storms and
[00:00:15] stuff like that coming in so we had to
[00:00:18] pay attention to that and it happened to
[00:00:20] be I was going to do a show last night
[00:00:22] and we had a thunderstorm rolling
[00:00:24] through so there's no way I was going to
[00:00:25] be getting coverage with this starlink
[00:00:27] here and uh [Â __Â ] it let's talk about
[00:00:29] starlink and they're [Â __Â ] all of a
[00:00:31] sudden they're pulling some [Â __Â ] now
[00:00:34] I don't know if anybody here uses
[00:00:36] starlink but prepare to grab your ankles
[00:00:40] is all I'm going to say everybody know
[00:00:42] the uh what is it the um you know the
[00:00:45] the net neutrality that was removed
[00:00:47] recently that they got rid of well that
[00:00:50] is now coming into play excessively for
[00:00:53] all you with um starlink and prepare for
[00:00:57] it to show up for the rest of your plans
[00:00:59] for everybody else you
[00:01:00] because starlink has will be one of the
[00:01:02] first ones to do it because they have
[00:01:04] their type of stuff there but what
[00:01:05] they're doing now is they're changing
[00:01:07] their plans so pretty much you're pay as
[00:01:09] you go you either pay ,000 a month for
[00:01:11] good internet or you

[00:01:19] line for
[00:01:20] anything so that is what you are all
[00:01:24] we're going to be running into Now with
[00:01:25] uh net neutrality being removed that was
[00:01:28] one of the few things that I I agreed
[00:01:30] with with the United States government
[00:01:32] was that they kept the net neutrality in
[00:01:34] there but uh now that it's gone you can
[00:01:37] see the bad stuff coming in so I though
[00:01:42] will run one of the uh we have our break

[00:02:52] pay attention to those my wife's
[00:02:54] birthday is today so what we're doing
[00:02:56] we're just hanging out for a short time
[00:02:58] we're uh you know wandering around
[00:02:59] around our city looking for things hey
[00:03:02] Oblivion how's it going my friend I
[00:03:03] appreciate coming in hanging out yeah we
[00:03:06] uh we have a bit of a we've been just I
[00:03:10] I was a little late getting on here
[00:03:11] today cuz I was playing with figuring
[00:03:12] out starlink issues right now so
[00:03:15] starlink decided they were going to
[00:03:16] change their plans on us so I've been
[00:03:18] trying to figure that out and I got
[00:03:19] really
[00:03:20] sidetracked um with what we're
[00:03:23] doing Iron Man right yes
[00:03:32] so we're going to
[00:03:37] um
[00:03:41] yeah going to cost a good chunk every
[00:03:43] month for
[00:03:53] us so we're going to have some headaches
[00:03:55] here but um yeah
[00:04:07] going to be
[00:04:16] um going to be anywhere from $500 to
[00:04:19] $1,000 a month I haven't figured it out
[00:04:21] yet for our internet now thank you
[00:04:26] starlink you woke up
[00:04:30] yeah my sleep schedule is broken up a
[00:04:32] little bit too we we've been doing some
[00:04:35] stuff but there's our our break today
[00:04:37] these three packs of collectors these
[00:04:39] three of play of draft boosters and the
[00:04:42] Iron Man there that's what we're doing
[00:04:44] woke up Ah that's a while ago yeah I
[00:04:47] understand that yeah I uh we've just I
[00:04:51] was up early this morning because we
[00:04:53] heard clinking which means our um our
[00:04:56] chain had come off of the um the bridal
[00:04:59] so we had to go and play with that this
[00:05:03] morning because um net neutrality was
[00:05:07] removed a little while ago uh and that
[00:05:09] was one of the only things that I agreed
[00:05:11] with with the government when it came to
[00:05:12] certain ways and when it came into
[00:05:14] getting into anybody that was
[00:05:16] uh a um business of any kind pretty much
[00:05:20] it said that you
[00:05:21] can't
[00:05:23] make um pretty much allow make it so
[00:05:26] that people are paying more per
[00:05:30] PL for their plan for for one person to
[00:05:32] get pretty much it allowed everybody to
[00:05:34] get the same type of internet everywhere
[00:05:37] no matter what you're no matter who you
[00:05:39] are and and what your income level was
[00:05:41] well once they removed net neutrality
[00:05:44] now it is going to be if you have money
[00:05:46] you get good internet if you don't have
[00:05:48] money you're going to get the ability to
[00:05:51] barely look on the internet uh at all
[00:05:54] and that is what they have started to
[00:05:56] instill in starlink so starlink now
[00:05:58] coming next month
[00:06:00] they're going to have the plan is you
[00:06:01] get your 50 gab of data which is what I
[00:06:03] get now then you used to go to standard
[00:06:05] which was just like um it was like it
[00:06:08] wasn't it just wasn't priority it just
[00:06:10] means you weren't if there was somebody
[00:06:11] else that had priority they wenter above
[00:06:12] you but if there were L if the line and
[00:06:14] internet connection was open you were
[00:06:16] still going to get whatever connection
[00:06:17] just slowed down depending on who was
[00:06:18] using it which is the same for all
[00:06:21] internet connections everywhere if more
[00:06:22] people are using it it slows down unless
[00:06:24] you have fiber optic well now what
[00:06:27] they're doing is doesn't matter what if
[00:06:30] you go over your allotment you're going
[00:06:31] to go down to 1 Megabyte download half a
[00:06:35] megabyte upload to you it guy I'm going
[00:06:37] to start happening what you're going to
[00:06:39] notice is there'll be levels so you'll
[00:06:41] be in the city where you're going to get
[00:06:42] your plan and you're going to be on the
[00:06:44] base plan and it will get you internet
[00:06:48] at the lowest tier which is barely able
[00:06:50] to do anything then you have to pay
[00:06:52] higher so that you can actually
[00:06:53] potentially stream something then you're
[00:06:54] going to pay higher if you want to
[00:06:56] stream more than one thing then you're
[00:06:58] then after that highest one you're still
[00:07:00] going to have a gigabyte allotment so
[00:07:02] when you run out of that gigabyte
[00:07:03] allotment you're going to still have to
[00:07:04] pay even more on top of that um having
[00:07:07] worked in I used to work in network
[00:07:10] management um I used to manage stuff
[00:07:11] from the military to NASA to uh to other
[00:07:17] government's internet connections and
[00:07:18] and all the stuff that went through that
[00:07:20] I know how the things work I knew how
[00:07:21] they were set up before they've always
[00:07:23] had the ability to throttle things and
[00:07:25] do that but now they're they're allowed
[00:07:27] to where previously it was made that the
[00:07:30] internet is like water and electricity
[00:07:34] you can't charge more for one person
[00:07:36] than another person it was flat across
[00:07:38] the board that was the only kind of like
[00:07:40] thing I agreed with when it comes like
[00:07:41] water electricity and things like that
[00:07:43] those shouldn't be able to be gouged now
[00:07:46] they're allowing people to gouge
[00:07:49] you probably starlink doesn't like me
[00:07:52] talking about the truth that's probably
[00:07:54] why I'm going uh um I'm I'm breaking up
[00:07:56] some there they most likely don't like
[00:07:59] me explaining this stuff going on so if
[00:08:02] you anybody heard me that's actually
[00:08:04] what uh what occurs there so that's why
[00:08:06] in what you're going to end up seeing
[00:08:07] here is a lot of people are going to
[00:08:10] either have to pay a lot more or deal
[00:08:13] with low slow speeds every
[00:08:15] month um and so yeah that's what kind of
[00:08:18] uh what's going on here that's what's
[00:08:20] hitting us with uh starlink we
[00:08:23] got that neutrality coming into play so
[00:08:26] if anybody here has ever dealt with that
[00:08:30] good
[00:08:33] luck
[00:08:35] but yeah so it's going to cost a lot
[00:08:38] every month for
[00:08:39] me that's really what it boils down to
[00:08:43] it's going to
[00:08:44] cost excessive amounts every month to
[00:08:47] use do anything so I might not be on
[00:08:49] every single day is the way I have been
[00:08:51] and my children will never be using the
[00:08:53] internet for the most part no one will
[00:08:54] be using the internet on my boat anymore
[00:08:56] because we cannot uh we will not be able
[00:08:58] to
[00:09:00] excessive to be able to afford it
[00:09:02] effectively we'll have to uh use
[00:09:05] different
[00:09:06] means so we don't know we'll see what
[00:09:08] happens here hopefully uh know maybe
[00:09:10] I'll we have to go to cafes to upload
[00:09:13] anything yeah we'll have to go to cafes
[00:09:15] to upload our stuff places whenever
[00:09:16] we're uh trying to upload information or
[00:09:18] documentation or or videos we to go and
[00:09:21] do that thing like uh before starlink
[00:09:23] was
[00:09:26] around we'll have to uh but yeah I mean
[00:09:30] I if we're lucky and my say the YouTube
[00:09:32] picks up for us and it does a bit better
[00:09:35] I might be okay where we can afford
[00:09:37] YouTube can pay for it but that might be
[00:09:38] what ends up happening is
[00:09:41] uh
[00:09:49] yeah not a coffee so yeah you've gone
[00:09:53] choppy yep so starlink is pretty much
[00:09:55] not liking
[00:09:57] me right now that's what I run into now
[00:10:02] now well that
[00:10:04] sucks well good luck uh everybody we at
[00:10:08] least we're on a boat we can survive
[00:10:10] there you guys are going
[00:10:12] to yeah uh you just may not see me as
[00:10:15] much as you used to that's really what
[00:10:17] it boils down to cuz the uh starlink is
[00:10:20] being um no
[00:10:22] fun but we have some of our singles
[00:10:24] there we got there this Chronicles the
[00:10:26] Wasteland you can uh we do a couple
[00:10:27] little quick quick Adventure in the
[00:10:29] cities maybe we see what's going on as
[00:10:31] we're wandering through we run into
[00:10:33] something maybe you'll be lucky where
[00:10:35] you can get yourself a nice weapon I
[00:10:37] don't know but we're just uh hanging out
[00:10:40] here kind of chilling listening to
[00:10:44] uh listening to some music and and
[00:10:46] realizing that uh not too distant future
[00:10:48] here you may the the internet here is
[00:10:50] not going to be as much fun we'll be uh
[00:10:53] running into problems anybody here
[00:10:55] that's uh aware of what I was just
[00:10:58] talking about anybody here
[00:11:04] Starling yeah they probably are reducing
[00:11:06] it already because they don't like me
[00:11:08] talking about
[00:11:10] things one of those ones they probably
[00:11:12] see me on um they probably see me on uh
[00:11:16] X and all those locations streaming and
[00:11:18] they're going I don't like what he's
[00:11:20] doing we don't like when he does those
[00:11:23] things so yeah we're just uh I'm hanging

[00:12:19] No it's h it's 50 cents a gigabyte so

[00:18:19] going on here um and we'll see how it
[00:18:22] goes it guys going to jump in see what
[00:18:25] we get for a single in some uh
[00:18:26] adventuring in the in the Wasteland here
[00:18:32] no we did not get it because uh we had a
[00:18:34] couple PE we only had like one person
[00:18:36] and it was going to be uh not enough so
[00:18:38] we'll have to work on it so we can get
[00:18:40] everybody more people involved all right
[00:18:42] we have a gallery of Legends let me get
[00:18:44] that out for you and with that you've
[00:18:47] got oh well that's nice you got yourself
[00:18:49] the
[00:18:50] uh the Gatling gun where is that
[00:18:54] one there you go my
[00:18:57] friend that's a nice pick
[00:18:59] up let me get your gallery of Legends
[00:19:02] here there you go you've got
[00:19:08] yourself gallery of Legends and you got
[00:19:11] a pickup of an

[00:19:21] handy now the alien Gatling gun comes
[00:19:26] with um
[00:19:29] 20
[00:19:30] rounds and it gives you five shots per
[00:19:34] round all right buddy so uh that's that
[00:19:37] means you only going to get really four
[00:19:38] shot four uh four pulls of that
[00:19:46] trigger look at 20 rounds so that means
[00:19:48] you're only going to get four
[00:19:52] shots we had two people lined up you me
[00:19:55] and one other person we needed to grab
[00:19:57] one more I was hoping we get and we
[00:19:59] couldn't there was not the other person
[00:20:00] to come in there that's why uh that's
[00:20:02] what was going on with that so if we can
[00:20:04] get another fourth guarant another one
[00:20:06] so we can have four
[00:20:08] guarantee then we will um we'll do that
[00:20:14] come another weekend well oh I'm sorry
[00:20:18] about the lag yeah well it's this is
[00:20:20] what I'm talking about like we I have it
[00:20:22] set up even when we're on mobile
[00:20:23] priority I'm still getting lag like this
[00:20:24] so I'm like I'm getting to the point
[00:20:26] where it's and if you're going to tell
[00:20:27] me I need to have mobile priority and
[00:20:29] all that I better have no [Â __Â ] lag no
[00:20:31] problem whatso [Â __Â ] ever I'm sorry
[00:20:32] for swearing that really annoys me like
[00:20:36] at the beginning of the month here we
[00:20:37] were we had no issues with our priority
[00:20:39] data and we were still getting lag lag
[00:20:42] and got issues like this so if we're
[00:20:45] going to have to pay for priority you
[00:20:48] better [Â __Â ] make sure my connection
[00:20:50] is working and I'm not getting a
[00:20:52] breakdown all the time like you're
[00:20:54] telling us you're not supposed to if
[00:20:56] you're going to [Â __Â ] pull [Â __Â ] off
[00:20:57] and you're going to tell me oh no we're
[00:20:58] going to make you charge you more but
[00:21:00] you're going to have still [Â __Â ] internet
[00:21:02] well go [Â __Â ] yourself Elon that's the
[00:21:03] first time I will [Â __Â ] say that I
[00:21:05] like you for almost everything but you
[00:21:06] can go [Â __Â ] yourself right now on
[00:21:11] that yeah Mystic like I I I agree with
[00:21:16] many of the things I don't necessarily
[00:21:18] always agree with everything everybody
[00:21:19] says I agree with many of the things he
[00:21:20] says he does and how he handles some
[00:21:23] things but this situation this is a go
[00:21:26] go go screw go [Â __Â ] yourself I I don't
[00:21:28] care like
[00:21:29] no you're you're you're a problem you're
[00:21:31] trying
[00:21:32] to pretty much take what you can like
[00:21:36] your family did back in the [Â __Â ] um
[00:21:38] Emerald mines in Africa and raped the
[00:21:41] [Â __Â ] country and the people there
[00:21:44] yeah I'm not stupid I do know where your
[00:21:45] [Â __Â ] family came
[00:21:50] from doesn't change whether I like you
[00:21:52] or not but I still know where I came
[00:21:54] from and where they made their money
[00:21:55] initially I'm not an idiot pretty much
[00:21:58] South African slaves built digging out
[00:22:00] [Â __Â ] holes to get emeralds for
[00:22:04] everyone and people know that's the
[00:22:06] truth they just don't like talking about
[00:22:07] it and he doesn't like hearing about it
[00:22:09] that's one thing and that's the problem
[00:22:11] is people don't like the truth as much
[00:22:12] as they should all right you got your
[00:22:15] alien Gat let's see what else happens
[00:22:17] here with that alien Gat maybe you're
[00:22:18] going to you're in wanding around that
[00:22:20] City you were looking at a skycraper
[00:22:23] there you saw that
[00:22:25] there oh yeah it's still happening today
[00:22:27] there's more slaves to day than there
[00:22:29] were when slavery was allowed legally in
[00:22:34] this country there are literally more
[00:22:36] slaves today around the world than they
[00:22:38] were allowed in the country there were
[00:22:40] in the country when slavery was
[00:22:42] legal before well yeah before slavery
[00:22:45] was abolished we did that less than
[00:22:46] extra two days ago the kids oh yeah yeah
[00:22:48] we did that so I mean it's one of those
[00:22:49] things you just
[00:22:51] you I love when people say make comments
[00:22:53] I'm like you don't care really anything
[00:22:54] about it cuz it's still going on you're
[00:22:56] not stopping it o we have a Shandra part
[00:22:58] of elrya for you and you got yourself a
[00:23:01] strength booster my friend and you're

[00:23:28] let me get the sea out C's are over here
[00:23:30] I moved them to the back a little bit so
[00:23:32] I had some more
[00:23:40] space yeah and everybody complaining
[00:23:42] does nothing
[00:23:44] correct
[00:23:46] exactly Carl Adora heart of
[00:23:54] alaka yeah and yeah well I mean yet put
[00:23:56] it this way yesterday the winds were so
[00:23:58] bad the boat that was next to us has
[00:23:59] been anchored here for who knows how
[00:24:00] long is now
[00:24:05] beached so that's what we were dealing
[00:24:07] with for weather
[00:24:08] yesterday which is why I had to take a
[00:24:11] break for a minute and handle that stuff
[00:24:14] yeah I know right I made you more coffee
[00:24:18] so high Hawk you got a strength booster
[00:24:20] which is a plus one on your adventure
[00:24:23] with your character now would you like
[00:24:25] to have that installed on your character
[00:24:27] Now High Hawk or would you like to hold
[00:24:29] on to that and maybe use it as a trade
[00:24:30] or something so here that's actually
[00:24:32] looks worse than today than yesterday
[00:24:34] this is um this is today right now right
[00:24:36] that's right now yeah so that's what the
[00:24:38] boat is right now we have been anchored
[00:24:40] next that and haven't had any has been
[00:24:42] sitting there floating in the water but
[00:24:44] now it's uh no longer the
[00:24:47] water yes so the winds we were hit we
[00:24:50] had at least 30 knots plus um was it
[00:24:54] yesterday or the night before uh the
[00:24:56] night before the night before it was
[00:24:58] like
[00:24:58] it was when we had some um get St we
[00:25:01] didn't get the bad storms but they were
[00:25:02] going through so yeah we uh we did not
[00:25:05] have a good one holy crape so high Hawk
[00:25:08] you got your card there you're wander
[00:25:11] around what you didn't tell me know if
[00:25:12] you want first time in here I'm not sure
[00:25:14] what strength booster is so a strength
[00:25:15] booster all gives you a plus one for
[00:25:18] your Wasteland character which is
[00:25:21] currently an adventure wander around a
[00:25:23] city it's a plus one on your strength
[00:25:24] you can get up to plus five which means
[00:25:26] say you have a sword you going going to
[00:25:28] get a little bit extra with that sword
[00:25:29] swinging so it's a normally a plus five
[00:25:31] when you roll the dice on a sword to get
[00:25:33] an extra like kind of like d and d and
[00:25:36] uh you get extra one on top of that so
[00:25:39] it's a plus six to roll when you're
[00:25:41] rolling to get a to get a hit when you
[00:25:43] have strength on top of it and say for
[00:25:45] like agility say you got agility that
[00:25:47] would work with knives or um pistols
[00:25:50] because you'd be able to be more agile
[00:25:52] to move around so you'd get a plus one
[00:25:54] when you're using those um or for
[00:25:56] instance say you need to lift something
[00:25:57] in the we land say you have to move
[00:25:59] something if you're stronger you'll get
[00:26:01] the ability to move something or you can
[00:26:03] hold on to it and use it to trade if you
[00:26:05] happen to bump into somebody in a safe
[00:26:08] haven say you get a safe haven and you
[00:26:10] want to go and trade something maybe for
[00:26:11] a weapon
[00:26:12] instead that's what you can do there but
[00:26:14] you got your single to go with it which
[00:26:15] is really what the singles are and then
[00:26:17] you could do a little D and D
[00:26:18] adventuring and let us know what you'd
[00:26:19] like to
[00:26:23] do yes definitely got Beach from the
[00:26:25] winds there yeah I know so that's why we
[00:26:29] were paying attention to that stuff all
[00:26:31] right I like it let's put it on use that
[00:26:33] strength booster buff your buddy up
[00:26:35] there let's add that to your
[00:26:40] character so you are now plus one
[00:26:44] strength for your character you have a
[00:26:46] pistol and a knife cuz that's always
[00:26:48] what you start with in this Wasteland so
[00:26:52] you always start out with a
[00:26:55] pistol and a knife both of those are
[00:26:58] plus two when you roll for your things
[00:27:00] there so you got to decide what you
[00:27:02] going to do with some adventuring here
[00:27:04] today but yeah we're we've just been
[00:27:06] dealing with the headaches of um
[00:27:08] technology here and uh I don't know
[00:27:10] we'll see what happens here gluttonous
[00:27:13] hell kite for my friend with ooh you're
[00:27:17] going to run
[00:27:20] into an encounter with a
[00:27:24] pirate you get to decide you want to
[00:27:27] fight that pirate that's standing in
[00:27:28] front of you oh my and not let me get
[00:27:31] your gluttonous hell kite out or would
[00:27:33] you like to turn and run it
[00:27:36] guy let me get you gluttonous Hellkite
[00:27:38] out here we went through and put all of
[00:27:39] our stuff together organized my wife did
[00:27:42] a lot of that yesterday and I'm going to
[00:27:43] have to go through and scan a lot of it
[00:27:45] now because we are uh we're still a
[00:27:48] little I think I don't think we have
[00:27:49] everything correct yet but I still got
[00:27:52] to go through and like confirm I have
[00:27:54] the right cards in there and the right
[00:27:55] amount in those so but we get nice
[00:27:58] gluttonous hell kite for you my friend
[00:28:00] it guy you have to decide
[00:28:05] though oh yes what you have it guy yes I
[00:28:08] can let you know it
[00:28:14] guy it guy you have the alien Gap you
[00:28:17] just picked up you have an AR
[00:28:20] with
[00:28:23] um you have an AR with 15 11 rounds of
[00:28:27] ammo Mo you have a
[00:28:32] knife you've got a knife and you have a
[00:28:35] pistol with seven rounds of ammo so
[00:28:38] that's what you got there my friend it
[00:28:40] guy I mean you got that alien gap which
[00:28:43] is a plus six when you roll for your
[00:28:46] character uh but you only get four of
[00:28:49] those
[00:28:53] images no I don't think I have any of
[00:28:55] that uncommons that you were looking for
[00:28:57] but um I should be today later today
[00:28:59] we're going to head out and I'm going to
[00:29:00] go pick up some more fireex y all will
[00:29:02] be run arm to the teeth
[00:29:05] yes yeah save the gap for special
[00:29:07] occasions that's a good idea all right
[00:29:09] here we go AR that means you have to
[00:29:12] have for our uh pirate it's a pirate is
[00:29:15] a 16 hit AR that and oh you got 14 plus
[00:29:20] six on your damage well look at that my
[00:29:24] friend 14 and six on your damage that
[00:29:27] means you hit the pirate with your AR
[00:29:31] you shoot you see that pirate coming
[00:29:32] towards you you're like I'm not going to
[00:29:34] play I'm not going to cross swords with
[00:29:39] you oh that doesn't sound appropriate
[00:29:41] hold on let's reorder that I'm not going
[00:29:43] to use my sword with no can't say that
[00:29:45] one I'm not going to play with my no
[00:29:49] we're just going to go we're not we're
[00:29:50] not using sword we're going to I'm going
[00:29:52] to shoot you with my assault rifle God
[00:29:55] damn
[00:29:55] it how many shots anyways we're going to
[00:29:58] stay with just we're we're going to
[00:29:59] attack we're
[00:30:01] attacking and you get a plus six on that
[00:30:04] guy he goes from uh 25 which is what
[00:30:07] your pirate goes down to uh to to to 19
[00:30:11] now the pirate doesn't like you he takes
[00:30:12] his oh God God damn it I can't say that
[00:30:15] he uses his sword on
[00:30:17] you need's a 13 or higher to hit and he
[00:30:20] gets you with
[00:30:21] 18 and he hits you for a three that's
[00:30:25] not that bad though not too bad there
[00:30:28] not too bad there you got
[00:30:32] lucky all right let me get you that
[00:30:33] Flawless maneuver out my friend
[00:30:36] beautiful Aaron I'll get that for you oh
[00:30:39] right
[00:30:42] now and when you slice at that
[00:30:47] gentlemen he hits you for a three but
[00:30:49] luckily it wasn't that big of a damage
[00:30:51] compared to that so they are
[00:30:54] scared of your weapon cuz they only have
[00:30:57] a sword
[00:30:59] handling still doesn't sound right um so
[00:31:03] they go running away but in the process
[00:31:07] being a pirate they drop some pogs for
[00:31:10] you which is our way and currency you
[00:31:12] get oh a good amount of those just fell
[00:31:13] one 2 3 four five 6 7 8 nine pogs well
[00:31:18] look at that it guy you got nine pogs

[00:31:38] out that's a good pickup right
[00:31:48] there Flawless maneuver I almost kept
[00:31:51] that card because I have been holding on
[00:31:54] to it for a while but I haven't used it
[00:31:57] yet and I got so many other versions of
[00:31:59] it that I can use one of the other
[00:32:01] versions like I have the secret lair
[00:32:04] version and stuff like that so hey Aaron
[00:32:06] though great pickup though I appreciate
[00:32:08] that uh nice pickup on that let me write

[00:32:13] it money is Mr pirate be careful handle
[00:32:16] the sword too much yeah he uh he uh he
[00:32:19] must have got himself in the eye with
[00:32:21] his sword and then oh my God couldn't
[00:32:24] remember what he had on him
[00:32:29] Aaron
[00:32:31] nip
[00:32:34] one there you go my friend nice Flawless
[00:32:37] maneuver for you I like
[00:32:45] that all right there you go my friend
[00:32:48] that was a nice one well we uh we had a
[00:32:51] little of an attack there the pirate
[00:32:52] went
[00:32:53] out we're going to see what happens now
[00:32:56] are we going to have anything else
[00:33:02] interesting yeah I don't have anything
[00:33:04] from there but um I mean others do have
[00:33:06] a good chunk every now and again so you
[00:33:07] might want to check uh check on them and
[00:33:10] see what they got but yeah well
[00:33:12] hopefully when it comes out here in the
[00:33:14] not too distant future our net
[00:33:15] neutrality stuff uh doesn't screw us too
[00:33:17] much
[00:33:18] here but we'll do a little bit of
[00:33:20] adventuring this morning and see what
[00:33:22] goes
[00:33:23] on I think we're only going to hang out
[00:33:25] for a short while we're not going to be
[00:33:26] on too too long just because uh like I
[00:33:29] said I got to I will go and uh drop some

[00:33:34] for the
[00:33:35] day don't do this right now yes yes
[00:33:39] sometimes it's the wording of it's the
[00:33:41] wording of things you you to talk about
[00:33:42] it you're like ah crap how how do I word
[00:33:45] that well even reading the cards
[00:33:47] sometimes like you read multiple of the

[00:42:19] bad uh wins the last few days and so we
[00:42:22] uh the last couple days so I had to pay
[00:42:23] attention to the boat longer more for a
[00:42:25] bit here and we uh so that's why we
[00:42:29] weren't on the last couple days the
[00:42:30] actually our neighbor boat was is now on
[00:42:34] the on on land because the winds were so
[00:42:37] hard it pushed them right on land all
[00:42:39] right Eeps let's see what you get here
[00:42:41] we're going to see what happens uh then
[00:42:42] after what goes on with your character
[00:42:43] for a little adventuring in the
[00:42:44] Wasteland here all right good luck my
[00:42:46] friend yeps we've got one two three four
[00:42:50] five 6 78 so we going to put the
[00:42:51] spoilers at the end but yeah so that's
[00:42:53] pretty much why uh we weren't on the
[00:42:55] last couple days we had some wins
[00:42:58] enough so that the boat next to us was
[00:43:00] pushed into the mangr and now on land so
[00:43:03] I didn't want to be on land so I paid
[00:43:05] more attention to uh the weather the
[00:43:07] winds and the fighting TI thank you yeah
[00:43:09] it was the winds and the fighting Tides
[00:43:10] there was caus and stuff to just all
[00:43:11] kinds of be headaches but thank you I
[00:43:13] appreciate that Eeps yes yeah we had 30
[00:43:16] mph knots at uh uh for a little bit so
[00:43:20] yeah I do not have a chatter Fang Aaron
[00:43:24] I'm sorry not that I'm aware of I know
[00:43:26] those went really really quickly when I
[00:43:27] pulled them all right here we go good
[00:43:29] luck my friend yeps we have a clammy
[00:43:31] Prowler slavering Branch Snapper fanatic
[00:43:33] of the heroing enter the Enigma trapped
[00:43:36] in the screen friendly taty ripchain
[00:43:39] Razer kin VI mutilator Gremlin Tamer
[00:43:43] let's play a game with a fear of
[00:43:46] exposure Nashi Searcher in the dark for
[00:43:50] your rare neglected Manor for your land
[00:43:54] and a foil clammy Prowler with your
[00:43:56] throat away one
[00:43:58] there yeah those go pretty quickly Aaron
[00:44:01] yeah uh those are one of the ones like
[00:44:02] when we first pulled them out they were
[00:44:03] boom gone boom down all right my friend
[00:44:07] yeps
[00:44:10] you are wandering around in the wayand
[00:44:14] here and you happen to
[00:44:20] uh see where is it
[00:44:32] this in the distance now it's not
[00:44:35] marked what would you like to do my
[00:44:40] friend yes it does going a
[00:44:46] lot um I
[00:44:49] think I think uh
[00:44:52] want I think RG would be good Red Green
[00:45:00] so yeps do you want to investigate the
[00:45:03] um oh good idea you're investigating
[00:45:07] slowly you slowly walk over to that the
[00:45:10] adventurer there looking around for
[00:45:13] traps you do not see any
[00:45:15] traps you want to uh but you do see
[00:45:18] something potentially sticking out of
[00:45:20] the
[00:45:23] ground uh that's okay what there you go
[00:45:26] that works
[00:45:49] all right you go over you looking you
[00:45:51] start digging around that unmarked grave
[00:45:55] h I don't know might be a good idea
[00:45:58] might not be a good idea but you see
[00:46:00] this buried toolbox that you keep
[00:46:03] digging at finally you get that toolbox
[00:46:05] out and you get it up on land but oh
[00:46:07] no you have a feral ghoul that's coming
[00:46:11] toward you
[00:46:14] now you've got to decide my
[00:46:17] friend what do you want to do with that
[00:46:19] feral ghoul leave the toolbox and run or
[00:46:22] do you want to attack
[00:46:37] that sounds like a plausible card
[00:46:39] definitely sounds like a plausible card
[00:46:41] we're going to zoom out
[00:46:42] here what do you like to do with your
[00:46:44] adventure chyo tarte attack them with
[00:46:47] your axe I like it use that Supreme axe
[00:46:49] you got there the Supreme warlord Axe
[00:46:53] and you're going to attack that gives
[00:46:55] you
[00:46:58] three to roll with and it's a plus six
[00:47:02] so that means your character is going to
[00:47:03] need a nine or higher cuz it's only a 15
[00:47:06] to
[00:47:07] hit and you get 16 look at that you get
[00:47:10] 16 and you hit them for 12 which are
[00:47:12] only 15 damage they only have 15 Health
[00:47:15] you hit them for 12 well that Supreme ax
[00:47:18] does a good job it chops off one of the
[00:47:21] arms so instead of being able to attack
[00:47:23] you with both they're going to need to H
[00:47:24] hit a 15 or higher and they get one
[00:47:27] thing to hit with and they do not hit
[00:47:29] you they got a five so they've missed
[00:47:31] you now yeps what are you going to do
[00:47:34] are you going to attack again you have a
[00:47:36] little bit more there they only have
[00:47:38] three Health
[00:47:39] left there there's pretty good swipe on
[00:47:41] your first attack there with that guy
[00:47:43] you did a pretty good job there taking
[00:47:45] him
[00:47:45] out you want to try again to take him
[00:47:49] out you to decide my friend I'm working
[00:47:53] on uh maybe that's what I'll do today in
[00:47:55] a little bit we'll work on maybe I'll
[00:47:56] try to get the a digital dice to roll
[00:47:57] across the screen what do you think
[00:47:59] another swing with the axe I like it
[00:48:01] another swing with that Mighty
[00:48:03] axe way you can kind of see everything
[00:48:05] that happens yeah I thought that might
[00:48:06] be a bad
[00:48:07] idea all right so here we go you swing
[00:48:10] with that axe that Mighty Axe and that
[00:48:13] feral ghoul was leaning over and you
[00:48:14] chop his head right off head goes
[00:48:17] rolling one way and his body falls flat
[00:48:20] to the
[00:48:21] ground when that
[00:48:23] happens that feral ghoul
[00:48:29] does
[00:48:31] drops some plasma rifle
[00:48:34] ammo six rounds of plasma rifle ammo
[00:48:37] bringing you up to 10 Rounds my friend
[00:48:40] and they also
[00:48:45] drop
[00:48:46] one of the POG Slammers which is a 10
[00:48:50] spot for your POG so you just got 10
[00:48:53] pogs plus six of the ammo there I like
[00:48:57] it all right
[00:48:58] Eeps let me add your pogs in here you
[00:49:01] are now at 43 pogs by the way Eeps there
[00:49:04] you
[00:49:06] go yes um will will actually made the
[00:49:10] dice tower Ashley Ashley man bear pig uh
[00:49:14] will actually made the dice tower for us
[00:49:16] there so yeah so you got yourself some
[00:49:19] nice things uh uh yep I like it there
[00:49:22] well our uh our discount went away there
[00:49:24] for that there thank you well I'll tell
[00:49:26] tell him you like it yeah it works very
[00:49:28] nice he's got a little thing there to
[00:49:29] block it you put a little bump there for
[00:49:31] it to hit off of when it drops down
[00:49:33] underneath but I have to be careful cuz
[00:49:35] I I break it every now and again when
[00:49:37] I'm picking it up there we go we're
[00:49:39] going to put that back up there for the
[00:49:40] dice tower I'm working on getting a
[00:49:43] digital dice to roll across the screen

[00:49:48] now but let's do um let's do another
[00:49:51] let's see if we can do another take over
[00:49:52] the
[00:49:55] character you can't see the prices for
[00:49:57] the break really you should be able to
[00:50:00] go
[00:50:02] in um here I'll run one of them here but
[00:50:07] you should be able to see them all all
[00:50:08] the starting prices for the break
[00:50:12] there there you go that's the starting
[00:50:14] price for the that's the price for the
[00:50:16] break if you want to I don't know why

[01:19:15] 17 or higher to hit and they're coming
[01:19:19] towards you they definitely have some
[01:19:21] weapons hanging behind them they have an
[01:19:23] assault rifle
[01:19:25] and what looks like to be
[01:19:27] potentially a
[01:19:32] sword yeps
[01:19:35] you can I have a coffee can you grab me
[01:19:38] one that's my coffee thank
[01:19:45] you that's what I'm doing you have 98
[01:19:48] health I mean 96 health because you had
[01:19:50] refilled your health before so you got
[01:19:52] to decide what you want to do there
[01:19:55] you want to
[01:19:58] attack guys that is a rather large
[01:20:01] Raider and he's got some good armor on
[01:20:04] them axe time I like it taking that axe
[01:20:08] out you grab out your Supreme boss's
[01:20:13] warlord axe that you've made and you've
[01:20:16] upgraded a few
[01:20:17] times now you're
[01:20:21] at your plus six with three of the dice
[01:20:25] to roll so let's see what happens here
[01:20:28] cuz they are uh there are 17 that means
[01:20:30] you're going to have to hit an 11 or
[01:20:34] higher oh no
[01:20:36] yeps you got 10 you just
[01:20:39] missed swinging that Axe and that that
[01:20:43] guy he luses you and he takes out his
[01:20:45] sword oh no takes out the sword and they
[01:20:50] swing they're going to need a um tener
[01:20:53] higher because they have the sword
[01:20:55] oh you got lucky look at that a
[01:20:58] five well it looks like your large
[01:21:01] Raider missed you have to make a
[01:21:02] decision you guys are kind of staring at
[01:21:05] each other right now staring each other
[01:21:06] down because you both kind of whiffed
[01:21:09] when you swung at each other kind of
[01:21:10] like I don't know is this good situation
[01:21:12] or not I don't know what I'm supposed to
[01:21:13] do you know I'm swinging a Miss for me
[01:21:16] and a swinging a Miss for you is this
[01:21:17] one of those like we turn around we
[01:21:19] leave I don't know what I'm supposed to
[01:21:20] be doing right now is he going to attack
[01:21:22] me ah you got you both kind got this big
[01:21:25] thought process going on you can tell
[01:21:27] he's not sure what he's doing cuz he's
[01:21:28] like kind of getting ready to put his
[01:21:29] sword back maybe going for his assault
[01:21:32] rifle backing up a little
[01:21:34] bit oh that's not a bad idea Mystic
[01:21:37] enforcer what do you think yeps look at
[01:21:40] him like hey uh I think we might want to
[01:21:42] just uh part ways shake hands and be
[01:21:44] like you know we're good I'm so you go
[01:21:46] that way I'm going to go left you go
[01:21:47] right sound good what do you think we we
[01:21:49] want to pull something like that off
[01:21:50] yeps or do you want to try again swing
[01:21:53] in the axe again
[01:21:55] the Alabama handshake you go in for the
[01:21:59] handshake and no you tricked
[01:22:02] him you hit him
[01:22:04] for five damage and he's 25 damage that
[01:22:08] guy is so he's goes down to 20 damage
[01:22:11] and he's not happy with you he swings
[01:22:14] right
[01:22:16] back and he hits you because he got a 13
[01:22:19] he hits you higher he hits you for six
[01:22:22] damage my friend so that brings you
[01:22:26] down to 90 health and they are at 20
[01:22:30] Health decide what you're going to do
[01:22:33] with that large Raider he's standing in
[01:22:35] front of you you're standing in front of
[01:22:36] him you're like I don't know that that
[01:22:37] wasn't even that much of an attack I got
[01:22:39] my I got armor on he barely a touch
[01:22:41] touched me looks like he's got himself
[01:22:43] protected too so I don't know what's
[01:22:44] going on here we going to attack again
[01:22:47] or we going to be like you know what I
[01:22:49] think this might be a time to uh part

[01:25:29] back do you want to go in and inspect
[01:25:31] any of those buildings or do you just
[01:25:33] want to continue wanding around outside
[01:25:35] my
[01:25:36] friend
[01:25:41] big all
[01:25:43] right going to go inside all right so
[01:25:46] you see one of the buildings there it
[01:25:47] looks like you might have a door that
[01:25:49] you can head on
[01:25:51] into so you wander into the door there
[01:25:54] and you find yourself in a
[01:25:57] room it looks like inside that
[01:26:02] room there may
[01:26:09] be an old lock chest in the
[01:26:13] back now
[01:26:16] big what would you like to
[01:26:18] do you got a lock chest potentially out
[01:26:21] in the back there
[01:26:24] it could be booby trapped it could be
[01:26:26] have something large in it we don't know
[01:26:29] what is in that chest there only you can
[01:26:32] find
[01:26:33] out only you can find out my
[01:26:42] friend thank you all I appreciate you
[01:26:44] hanging out with
[01:26:48] us look around all right you looking
[01:26:52] around you you look around that room
[01:26:53] there
[01:26:55] start looking all around the room there
[01:26:57] you notice oh all right don't see any
[01:26:59] traps so you go over to the
[01:27:03] chest take
[01:27:05] out your knife and you start fiddling
[01:27:08] with a
[01:27:10] lock as you fiddle with the
[01:27:13] lock you hear some rustling behind you
[01:27:16] oh no it looks like you may have awoken
[01:27:20] a feral ghoul in that building now that
[01:27:24] feral ghoul is
[01:27:26] a um 15 cuz it's a weaker one for their
[01:27:31] damage their health and it is only a 14
[01:27:35] or higher for your roll to hit so that
[01:27:40] guy starting to wake up you see him
[01:27:41] starting to move out of the out of there
[01:27:43] do you want to continue to try you want
[01:27:44] to try your luck see if you can uh open
[01:27:49] that locked chest or do you want to go
[01:27:50] after that before it has the opportunity
[01:27:52] to come after you
[01:28:01] well if you want a handful of them that
[01:28:03] are in the buy now if you send me a a
[01:28:06] list of them if you don't um I can try
[01:28:08] to get those together for you and then
[01:28:10] like on tomorrow's
[01:28:12] show um I will have it as like a stack
[01:28:14] of them and then you can just buy it as
[01:28:16] that if you'd like if they're all like
[01:28:18] at a lower you know some of them like
[01:28:19] dollar ones or things like that try and
[01:28:22] open the chest no that's fine I can do
[01:28:24] that like it won't be today right now
[01:28:25] but it will be like tonight I'd have to
[01:28:27] go through that and check it out for you
[01:28:29] all right you keep fiddling with that
[01:28:31] chest and then finally though you open
[01:28:34] that locked chest nice inside of it you
[01:28:38] find yourself a plasma rifle with some
[01:28:41] plasma
[01:28:42] ammo nice my friend so you big
[01:28:48] BK now have a plasma rifle
[01:28:55] with 10 rounds of ammo which is a lot
[01:28:57] for the plasma rifle to start
[01:29:03] with yeah I know I wish you could do
[01:29:05] like select them all and buy from the
[01:29:06] cart that would be beautiful if you
[01:29:08] could do that but the thing with whatnot
[01:29:09] is they want you to do multiple
[01:29:11] transactions because they make money off
[01:29:12] of each transaction so that's why they
[01:29:14] do it that way which is why I have said
[01:29:16] in the past if people want to do a combo
[01:29:18] of things if they can let me know for
[01:29:20] like multiple packs or something I'll do
[01:29:22] that that way I can save on the feed and
[01:29:24] then I give you guys the discount kind
[01:29:26] of on top of it to get a little bit of
[01:29:28] that because then that goes towards you
[01:29:29] guys you
[01:29:30] know so now you have that plasma rifle
[01:29:33] that feral ghoul is still rumaging and
[01:29:35] getting up what are you going to do my
[01:29:36] friend big BK now that you get the
[01:29:38] plasma
[01:29:42] rifle yeah if you want to do that I can
[01:29:44] send me a list of things and even like
[01:29:46] in the show say if you want to get like
[01:29:47] two or three packs sometimes Say Hey I
[01:29:50] want to get like a you know an Outlaws
[01:29:52] collector and like a a dmor play booster
[01:29:56] and and a modern Horizon 3 play booster
[01:29:58] what I'll do is it'll end up probably
[01:30:00] being like2 or $3 off just because of
[01:30:01] the fees you know definitely try and go
[01:30:04] stab it before it get gets up all right
[01:30:07] exactly you go over to it you don't want
[01:30:08] to wake anything so you run over that
[01:30:09] feral
[01:30:10] ghoul you use that knife and it is only
[01:30:13] a 14 to hit so that means with your
[01:30:17] knife you need to have a 12 or higher to
[01:30:22] hit this throw
[01:30:26] and oh my you swing at that feral ghoul
[01:30:30] and it does not
[01:30:33] work they get up and they grab your
[01:30:36] ankle when they're getting up and you
[01:30:37] end up falling to the ground oh
[01:30:41] no and as you fall to the ground a
[01:30:44] second feral ghoul starts to rumble and
[01:30:47] starts to
[01:30:48] awaken oh
[01:30:51] no luckily he did not harm you he just
[01:30:54] kind of Knocked you over but caused a
[01:30:56] Ruckus where some more awaken up all
[01:30:58] right you're going to start blasting
[01:31:00] here we go that's a uh uh plus five so
[01:31:04] that means you need a line or
[01:31:07] higher oh my God you got a
[01:31:10] seven you got a seven you miss you start
[01:31:14] blasting with that plasma rifle you take
[01:31:16] one shot off at that guy getting up and
[01:31:19] it must have been just you must have
[01:31:20] been too close to him you weren't able
[01:31:21] to get it you missed but that feral
[01:31:24] ghoul near you this time does swing at
[01:31:27] you that feral ghoul swings at you this
[01:31:29] time oh no let's see what happens if
[01:31:33] they get you they need a 13 or
[01:31:35] higher oh no they hit you for one they
[01:31:39] have now hit you for only one damage but
[01:31:42] even though it's one damage you have now
[01:31:44] twice the rad so you are now at 90

[01:34:49] again Darth Goku
[01:34:53] here is
[01:34:55] your
[01:34:58] card there you go my
[01:35:03] friend oh really uh I don't know why it
[01:35:05] allows the offers it shouldn't even be
[01:35:07] allowing
[01:35:10] that um because I I literally say don't
[01:35:14] allow offers so here I'm sorry I'm going
[01:35:16] to have
[01:35:17] to I because what I do is I put it at
[01:35:19] the I literally update the TCG player
[01:35:21] price so I don't know why it's doing
[01:35:23] that I'll submit
[01:35:27] the counter offer there so that way you
[01:35:30] can see it and you don't lose
[01:35:33] them I don't know why it's doing
[01:35:41] that that's really annoying really
[01:35:43] really annoying because I definitely
[01:35:45] have made it so it doesn't do that and
[01:35:46] it still allows people to do that even
[01:35:48] though I say no
[01:35:56] it's really uh really frustrating
[01:36:01] actually cuz I know I said it right so
[01:36:03] I'm going to have to send them a message
[01:36:04] and be like hey I don't know what's
[01:36:05] going on
[01:36:15] here yeah well I'm putting it no no
[01:36:17] worries D no worries on that I'm sorry
[01:36:19] it's more of a no it's not your problem
[01:36:22] it's just I I did um I I gave you a
[01:36:24] counter back on that so you should get
[01:36:25] the option of like going with them or
[01:36:26] not but yeah Big BK it's like it's
[01:36:28] frustrating because I upload 800 singles
[01:36:31] I can't go through 800 singles and
[01:36:33] change them all individually that's just
[01:36:35] not going to
[01:36:40] work Magda deck oh that's not a good
[01:36:43] that's a good idea to put in there not a
[01:36:44] problem no apologies needed it's it's

[02:13:06] yeps starts kicking on the door big BK
[02:13:10] comes up behind him starts pushing and
[02:13:12] kicking on it you both kick on that
[02:13:19] door and slowly
[02:13:22] that door starts to open do we have
[02:13:24] another person here bigles all right
[02:13:27] bigles what are you going to do my
[02:13:29] friend would you uh are you going to
[02:13:32] help them are you going to turn and
[02:13:35] run bigles you only have a pistol and a
[02:13:37] knife right now though having jumped in
[02:13:39] wait actually I think you got a little
[02:13:40] something extra cuz you had your uh you
[02:13:42] got the game here AR you have an AR
[02:13:45] that's what it was so you got to decide
[02:14:01] are you going to be opening the door
[02:14:02] with them
[02:14:15] all or are you going to run away my
[02:14:17] friend
[02:14:28] cuz you can always run sorry I'm just
[02:14:30] putting the cards away in
[02:14:32] here cuz they're opening the door right
[02:14:34] now trying to open it at least they
[02:14:37] might need a little bit more assistance
[02:14:39] from someone for sure all right you all
[02:14:44] three of you push against that door
[02:14:51] let me get big BK over
[02:14:53] here big BK 509 let going show you there
[02:14:57] you open the door and oh
[02:15:01] my cracks open and there's a wretched
[02:15:05] smell that comes out and in front of you
[02:15:08] pushing the door completely open who
[02:15:11] wakes
[02:15:16] me looks like you have a uh monster of
[02:15:20] some kind inside there and they
[02:15:25] also will be able to uh do potentially a
[02:15:29] special attack and they are at a 50 for
[02:15:33] their health so that means you have to
[02:15:36] knock them down 50 Health between the
[02:15:38] three of you now at he's waking up just
[02:15:42] starting to wake up so you have the the
[02:15:44] upper hand on him right now you must
[02:15:48] decide what you're going to do the three
[02:15:49] of you are you going to attack you going
[02:15:52] to harm you going to kill what will
[02:15:55] happen to you my
[02:15:57] friend we're opening these up we're
[02:15:59] going through you opened your door you
[02:16:01] see the cave
[02:16:06] dweller oh yeps yeps is the vet he's the
[02:16:09] one that's been here he's been doing
[02:16:10] this for a while so you have your um
[02:16:16] your AR and a plasma rifle yeps what are
[02:16:19] you going with
[02:16:22] now the AR will get
[02:16:24] you a three and you get two of these and
[02:16:27] it's plus five for your roll and two of
[02:16:29] those for your uh plasma rifle but
[02:16:32] they're a little different on how they
[02:16:35] attack you have I believe only uh you
[02:16:40] only have 15 rounds so you shoot and
[02:16:41] that's one shot goes out that's three
[02:16:43] shots that go out so you're down to 12
[02:16:46] and let's see what you get you have to
[02:16:47] have a 14 or
[02:16:49] higher oh no you get a 13 you just
[02:16:53] missed you shoot that assault
[02:16:56] rifle in the cave dweller dodes quickly
[02:16:59] out of the way well it looks like maybe
[02:17:02] this cave dweller is starting to wake
[02:17:06] up oh no he's getting ready to
[02:17:09] charge you do have some
[02:17:13] luck yeah it's probably find to open
[02:17:15] fire you're going to shoot with your AR
[02:17:17] too I like it and you my friend get a
[02:17:20] shot off look at that you get hit 17 you
[02:17:22] hit them and you hit them for seven
[02:17:25] damage my friend nice so it goes from
[02:17:32] 50 down to
[02:17:36] 43
[02:17:38] damage left now since you guys all had
[02:17:42] the one shot first cuz he was waking up
[02:17:45] what are you going to do my friend BK
[02:17:46] shoot with the AR
[02:17:48] also and oh you got a natural natural
[02:17:52] 20 you got a natural
[02:17:55] 20 boom all we going to all right we're
[02:17:58] going to take the gong down here we go a
[02:18:02] natural
[02:18:04] 20 you've got a hit my
[02:18:09] friend natural 20 and look at that you
[02:18:13] got 10 damage so that means you you have
[02:18:15] a multiplier on your damage now you're
[02:18:18] guaranteed to hit with the 10 damage
[02:18:21] but your
[02:18:24] multiplier can bring you up potentially
[02:18:27] to four times that amount so you're
[02:18:30] currently at 10 damage you got let's see
[02:18:32] if we can get any
[02:18:35] more two times the damage look at that
[02:18:38] that is 20 nice hit my friend
[02:18:46] BK they are now at 23 health
[02:18:50] that was a large hit that cave dweller

[02:18:56] loudly and he screeches so
[02:18:59] loud the Rocks start to fall around oh
[02:19:03] no you didn't realize that he could do
[02:19:06] that he has the Rocks falling around you
[02:19:09] he's going to need a 13 or higher to
[02:19:12] hit and Oh my he got a
[02:19:15] 19 okay so that means he hits you guys
[02:19:19] and all of you get minus 6 or a minus
[02:19:23] four so we're going to go with minus 6
[02:19:25] on

[02:24:22] bigles that doesn't the yeps does not
[02:24:25] come in bigles that does not help from
[02:24:26] our friend uh Mythic that gives the cave
[02:24:30] dweller I guess that P made them a
[02:24:32] little stronger they are now
[02:24:37] at they are now
[02:24:40] at five Health instead of one
[02:24:48] Health what are you guys going to do now
[02:24:50] you have uh you had the guy shooting
[02:24:52] there what the heck all right so you're
[02:24:55] going to shoot again you stab you stab
[02:24:57] with your knife and you missed the stab
[02:25:01] with your knife but right behind you
[02:25:02] with the plasma
[02:25:04] rifle was our buddy
[02:25:08] yeps and yeps gets the hit cuz a five on
[02:25:12] top of 15 is definitely a hit and yeps
[02:25:15] you get 12 with that hit so that was a
[02:25:19] nice plasma PL rifle shot a fullon hit
[02:25:22] for the plasma
[02:25:24] rifle hits him Square in the chest next
[02:25:26] to his head and that cave dweller goes
[02:25:30] no I'm
[02:25:33] melting and that cave dweller melts and
[02:25:37] behind him in that Dusty cave you find
[02:25:42] an old locked
[02:25:46] chest do you want to try to open your
[02:25:49] old locked chest
[02:25:52] my
[02:25:53] friends yes oh yes we're
[02:25:57] definitely
[02:25:58] [Laughter]
[02:26:02] oh all right I I can't say
[02:26:06] everything all right you guys going to
[02:26:08] roll who's going to roll for us here to
[02:26:11] see what comes out of it we have um I
[02:26:13] think our buddy
[02:26:16] um big BK might want him because he has
[02:26:18] one extra on luck what do you think cuz
[02:26:21] if you have an extra unluck that might
[02:26:23] give you a you know it gives you a plus
[02:26:26] one for whatever happens it depends on
[02:26:30] what type of stuff is there you have
[02:26:31] luck all right so you can have a plus
[02:26:33] one to whatever rolls out of this and it
[02:26:35] will depend in low ones lower things
[02:26:37] higher higher things in the chest let's
[02:26:40] see you've got a 15 so that's a 16 so
[02:26:44] that means you open that locked chest
[02:26:46] and inside that locked chest you find
[02:26:56] three
[02:26:57] Slammers which is 30
[02:27:00] pogs
[02:27:03] plus one two 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 pogs
[02:27:12] also so that is our waist L currency
[02:27:15] pogs that's our wastel L currency and
[02:27:18] then you also happen to
[02:27:21] find some fun things in here you find
[02:27:25] yourself an intelligence
[02:27:28] booster a strength
[02:27:31] booster an agility
[02:27:33] booster a
[02:27:36] sword and a
[02:27:39] flamethrower
[02:27:41] ooh what are you guys going to do with
[02:27:43] all this that you have you do have luck
[02:27:46] and you got it that luck worked for you
[02:27:48] my friend what are you guys going to do
[02:27:49] now with your characters huh you got to
[02:27:52] decide what you're going to take you
[02:27:53] guys got yourself some strength agility
[02:27:56] some intelligence get yourself a
[02:28:00] sword a
[02:28:03] flamethrower and I think that was it
[02:28:05] right there you
[02:28:08] go big BK is that okay if big BK takes a
[02:28:11] flamethrower I mean they jumped in
[02:28:13] pretty good and hard here I say that's a
[02:28:14] good
[02:28:18] one now that has a area of effect and
[02:28:21] you only have five shots that you start
[02:28:23] with all
[02:28:26] right so strength means when you swing
[02:28:28] your axe or a sword you get a plus one
[02:28:32] for your um for your for your uh damage
[02:28:35] at assistance for your swing so instead
[02:28:36] of being plus six on your on your axe
[02:28:39] it'll be a plus
[02:28:41] seven so you want I'm guessing you want
[02:28:44] the strength
[02:28:50] yeah all right that's okay with everyone
[02:28:52] we're going to give the strength to
[02:28:57] yeps all right yeps gets the strength
[02:29:00] booster now agility agility is a plus
[02:29:02] one when you use your knife or a pistol
[02:29:05] or like a a smaller sword where you can
[02:29:08] dual wield things agility works with
[02:29:09] dual
[02:29:10] wielders then your intelligence which
[02:29:13] makes you smarter so in case you
[02:29:14] encounter something you need some
[02:29:15] intelligence it'll help you
[02:29:21] yes bigles goes with a sword I like it
[02:29:23] that's a plus five whenever you swing
[02:29:26] and it is a um it is a melee
[02:29:30] weapon so you have a sword I like it my
[02:29:37] friend bigles gets the sword you're
[02:29:41] going to take the intelligence I like it
[02:29:42] we're going to give the intelligence to
[02:29:44] Big BK
[02:29:52] plus one on your
[02:29:55] intelligence all righty now we have an
[02:29:58] agility
[02:30:00] left and a and that's it an agility is
[02:30:05] the only that is left hey bro how are
[02:30:08] you doing Frank not bad how how you been
[02:30:10] mddy I think we're coming in hanging out
[02:30:12] we're just starting to kind of finish up
[02:30:14] our adventure that we did
[02:30:18] today yes I have a spreadsh
[02:30:23] everybody should have a pistol bigles
[02:30:25] everybody starts with a pistol and a
[02:30:28] knife so everybody has those when they
[02:30:30] start unless they trade them
[02:30:33] away yeah dude I've been wicked busy too
[02:30:36] like we yesterday and the day before we
[02:30:37] didn't get to I didn't stream at all
[02:30:38] because we had the winds were weird and
[02:30:40] I just couldn't trust the boat really we
[02:30:43] we were like moving all over the place
[02:30:45] and I just not trusting it all right
[02:30:47] guys you got to let me know who's going
[02:30:48] to take the last one the agility
[02:30:53] yeah cuz if you have two knives all
[02:30:55] right so if you have two knives that's a
[02:30:56] that would be a plus four on a roll or
[02:30:58] if you have two pistols that'll be plus
[02:31:00] four on a roll so if you get a couple of
[02:31:01] those you can do
[02:31:05] that nice going to go to Vegas conon
[02:31:07] again
[02:31:09] Sweet all right bigles is going to take
[02:31:11] the agility I like it Biggles so when uh
[02:31:14] if you want
[02:31:17] hey if anybody here that has a PL a
[02:31:20] pistol so like for instance big BK you
[02:31:23] have a plasma rifle an AR and a
[02:31:24] flamethrower you might not need your
[02:31:26] pistol your knife so if you want to give
[02:31:28] that to our buddy um bigles that'll
[02:31:30] allow them to dual wield and then um and
[02:31:34] then we can split the uh the pogs up
[02:31:36] evenly between everyone sound
[02:31:39] good bigles is an assassin all right
[02:31:41] you're going to get the uh will give you
[02:31:42] the knife and the pistol is that what
[02:31:44] we're doing or we're just going to give
[02:31:47] you just the pistol because you don't
[02:31:48] have a melee weapon yet
[02:31:53] okay yeah all right so we're going to
[02:31:54] give you the pistol and hey if you guys
[02:31:56] be meet up again who knows maybe you'll
[02:31:58] be able to uh you can hang out again in
[02:32:00] another day two times of pistols which
[02:32:02] gives you also 18 rounds of ammo because
[02:32:05] you have two t two times of
[02:32:07] pistols good idea to keep the knife
[02:32:09] especially if you don't have any other
[02:32:10] melee you know right all righty so this
[02:32:15] has hath concluded our adventure you
[02:32:18] guys did it you guys did it you work
[02:32:21] together you beat that cave dweller big
[02:32:24] go got the sword
[02:32:26] correct no it has to be two knives or
[02:32:30] two pistols you can't use a sword and a
[02:32:32] knife not until you like kind of your
[02:32:35] character if you play for a while you
[02:32:37] can upgrade your character eventually
[02:32:39] and once you upgrade your character then
[02:32:40] you might be able to use two swords like
[02:32:43] our buddy the elite wastelander but you
[02:32:46] have to uh you have to get stronger and
[02:32:48] a bit you know you have to uh get to the
[02:32:49] the next level of your character you've
[02:32:51] only beaten one boss here you got you
[02:32:53] think you guys think you're all tough
[02:32:54] and mighty here you beat one boss that's
[02:32:57] a come on that's one it's barely
[02:33:00] anything you think you're oh I'm a big
[02:33:02] buff strong guy now I came around I
[02:33:04] killed the boss I get everything I can
[02:33:05] do anything I won't no you guys the
[02:33:09] Wasteland is Harsh take some
[02:33:12] time no I'm not big BK but I've been
[02:33:15] told I should be
[02:33:20] so right now what we're going to do is I
[02:33:23] am going to we actually going to
[02:33:26] head you know what I've thought about it
[02:33:28] if you want to join um join if take the
[02:33:32] um the uh link tree um if you go to link
[02:33:36] tree link Tree on then SL fos
[02:33:40] Gamers thank you I am the man thank you
[02:33:43] Frank and you do that if you go there
[02:33:45] you can actually get to all of my uh
[02:33:47] locations which should give you a link
[02:33:49] to Discord
[02:33:50] and if you jump on Discord I have a DND
[02:33:53] channel so if you're interested in doing
[02:33:54] some D and D games if I can get a good
[02:33:56] chunk of people I might just run I have
[02:33:58] an actual whole um Wasteland Fallout
[02:34:03] type campaign that I built it's actually
[02:34:05] would last probably a whole anywhere
[02:34:08] between 4 to 10 hours to go through if
[02:34:11] people wanted to so jump in if you want
[02:34:13] to do
[02:34:14] that all right um I can't when it comes
[02:34:16] to the offers I don't I don't I go with
[02:34:19] the um I'd go with the price from
[02:34:25] um I go with the price from
[02:34:30] um TCG player so I I I don't do offers
[02:34:34] on them just because of that reasoning
[02:34:35] of it I don't know why it allows it
[02:34:37] because I always like don't allow them
[02:34:39] so um I'm going to just go submit the
[02:34:41] counter one that way in case you do want
[02:34:43] to try them you can still grab it after
[02:34:50] but yeah it's just because they don't
[02:34:51] allow me for whatever reason I have to
[02:34:53] send them a message because it's getting
[02:34:54] actually annoying that I have to keep
[02:34:56] doing submitting counter offers and
[02:34:58] things like that because for whatever
[02:34:59] reason it just it doesn't even though I
[02:35:01] select no it's the weirdest thing in the
[02:35:04] world I think it's one of those things
[02:35:05] that's like a
[02:35:06] glitch and uh but yeah if you want you
[02:35:09] should have gotten the counter
[02:35:10] offer on all

[00:01:39] of um my um I don't know my my ad or
[00:01:41] whatever my thumbnail that's what I was
[00:01:43] looking for my thumbnail was like me
[00:01:45] with like as a Picasso drawing painting
[00:01:47] the uh the star Night
[00:01:49] painting dude you gotta go back and look
[00:01:51] at uh my past
[00:01:54] um past streams one of them was going to

[00:02:16] coincidence right there I know dude
[00:02:19] pretty good picture
[00:02:22] huh and uh so in the book there's 81
[00:02:25] spots generally 22 per spot but whenever
[00:02:27] we do multiple things I help I combine
[00:02:29] it gives me a little bit of a deal by
[00:02:31] having a deal with them both because um
[00:02:34] it saves me you on whatnot these and I
[00:02:36] pass that kind of savings on to you guys
[00:02:38] so Garrett is trying it out here he
[00:02:40] likes
[00:02:42] it all right we're starting out this
[00:02:44] morning really quick and something uh

[00:02:47] wanted to have somebody get it going let
[00:02:49] me get that seller tool up
[00:02:54] there let me uh get that seller tool up
[00:02:57] where a show the randomizer

[00:03:03] because it wasn't supposed to be empty I
[00:03:05] put it in there what not didn't save it
[00:03:08] when I put it in there though sometimes
[00:03:10] when I click Like go and save it doesn't
[00:03:11] actually save or go for when it goes to
[00:03:15] the uh what it is all right can you guys
[00:03:18] see the spinner with everything there we
[00:03:19] go there's 80 there's our 81 spots there
[00:03:21] now all right now would you like me to

[00:12:58] pole up
[00:13:03] this is my actually first
[00:13:22] poll all right this is my first question
[00:13:25] my we were thinking about this the other
[00:13:27] day in Chicago no that's the one coming
[00:13:31] up soon here right Garrett uh no I had
[00:13:35] that's the one like uh what like to this
[00:13:37] month or next month if I remember right
[00:13:41] yeah no I was actually we're looking
[00:13:43] into going to Vegas though because
[00:13:45] that's the one I was able to convince my
[00:13:47] wife to um she's like you know what
[00:13:49] there's that one in Vegas you mentioned
[00:13:50] before I'm like yeah she like I'll go to
[00:13:52] that one so uh I might be doing this
[00:13:55] here so now all right this is what I'm
[00:13:57] talking about with um
[00:14:00] I was actually debating on going to it
[00:14:02] but I was uh I'm already taking time off
[00:14:06] to go to the boat show in Florida here
[00:14:08] the U Miami Boat Show uh we're looking
[00:14:11] into buying a catamaran um so we're
[00:14:13] going to Miami Boat Show and then um
[00:14:16] then afterwards we have a trip um that
[00:14:18] we're going on a MOAB trip in a little
[00:14:20] while in July so I can't take a ton of
[00:14:22] time off if I'm going to be doing the
[00:14:24] one and uh if I want to do the Vegas one
[00:14:27] so it was kind of like between my my job
[00:14:29] and stuff that was kind of like I had to
[00:14:30] make a decision on what I was
[00:14:32] doing that makes any sense so that was
[00:14:36] my decision there but Freddy I know a
[00:14:38] bunch of people that want to yeah so we
[00:14:40] decided I decided like go to um we'll do
[00:14:42] um we'll do
[00:14:47] um Vegas instead so this is what I'm
[00:14:50] going to do here for a pack deal this
[00:14:52] morning let's do something like this
[00:14:54] right
[00:14:56] now all right so my big hit
[00:14:59] box that I was thinking of low buying
[00:15:01] box was something like the cards are
[00:15:03] going to be a dollar or less they're
[00:15:05] literally going to be a dollar or less
[00:15:06] cards the Buy in will be a
[00:15:09] dollar but it's going to be like a
[00:15:11] thousand cards but it will have a
[00:15:14] collector booster box in
[00:15:18] there yeah exactly see if I want to do
[00:15:20] all the other things I was like I can't
[00:15:22] I'm doing all the other things I if I
[00:15:24] want to do Vegas too I can't afford this
[00:15:26] at the same time so I'm like all right
[00:15:28] if I if because between going to Moab um
[00:15:32] doing the boat show in Miami um like I
[00:15:36] just I can't afford all Chicago on top
[00:15:38] of it yeah maybe in the future maybe in
[00:15:41] a year or so maybe I can be like yo I'm
[00:15:43] going to all of
[00:15:45] them maybe like next year that'll be
[00:15:47] pretty sweet if I'm doing good enough
[00:15:48] with you guys that uh I'm on a regular
[00:15:50] basis like going through stuff that I
[00:15:51] can be like yo I'm going I'll meet you
[00:15:53] guys there hey Mike how you

[00:16:10] were uh just literally talking
[00:16:13] about she saw somebody doing a game when
[00:16:16] I was watching it when I was packing
[00:16:17] some stuff up and she's like why uh like
[00:16:21] should you need to have higher price
[00:16:22] things I'm like I don't have a bunch of
[00:16:23] higher price cards but I can do like a
[00:16:25] box maybe not too bad too bad getting

[00:17:06] hit so there is no longer 19 floors it
[00:17:09] is down to 18 floors and with that being
[00:17:12] down to 18 floors that means there's
[00:17:14] also an added Blank Spot for a Murders
[00:17:17] At Carlo collector
[00:17:20] booster pretty cool we're going to
[00:17:22] shuffle it and spin I like
[00:17:26] it here we go let's pull that over
[00:17:30] here pull that over here we're going to
[00:17:32] shuffle it
[00:17:33] once let's go Shuffle that once and
[00:17:36] we're going to spin
[00:17:40] it we got number
[00:17:43] 11 number 11 let's see where number 11
[00:17:46] is here
[00:17:47] Mike got number 10
[00:17:52] nine all right we do have one of the
[00:17:54] lows on the uh five to four under under
[00:17:58] five cards which means you get two packs
[00:18:01] of
[00:18:02] cards or a collector booster so you get
[00:18:05] a collector booster these were all your
[00:18:07] choices that everybody knows when you
[00:18:08] get under $ Five Card you actually end
[00:18:11] up it's kind of hard to lose here that's
[00:18:12] why it's kind of cool you get either a
[00:18:15] collector booster of here you get
[00:18:18] yourself
[00:18:22] ioria where was it the other
[00:18:25] one
[00:18:27] this or
[00:18:32] this all right so this is the deal that
[00:18:34] you get
[00:18:39] here you
[00:18:42] get a Dungeons and
[00:18:45] Dragons you get two of these any two of
[00:18:49] these or any one of these plus any one
[00:18:53] of these and that's kind of how we go
[00:18:55] there that way everybody gets an
[00:18:56] opportunity if you get a low car of $2
[00:18:59] you get packs to open and you get a
[00:19:01] choice of what to go to I kind of give
[00:19:04] you a choice so whichever two you want
[00:19:06] to go with Mike or kind of two two of
[00:19:09] those one of these and one of these or
[00:19:11] the dungeon dragons whatever you want to
[00:19:14] go
[00:19:15] with ioria set and Exelon ioria and
[00:19:20] Exelon set all right I got
[00:19:23] it right there that is what we're going
[00:19:26] with there and as you can see guys see
[00:19:28] you get a pretty good deal there it's
[00:19:30] not like you if even if you don't happen
[00:19:31] to get a high card you're still going to
[00:19:34] get packs to open all right and now no
[00:19:40] problem and now what happens is the cool
[00:19:43] thing about that is that Blank Spot
[00:19:47] becomes a Murders At Carlo Manor
[00:19:50] collector booster so every single time a
[00:19:55] uh spot is run it becomes another the
[00:19:57] book becomes bigger because you get a
[00:19:59] collector booster instead so that $2
[00:20:01] spot becomes a collector booster making
[00:20:03] that book even bigger all right we're
[00:20:05] going to rip open our ioria and then
[00:20:07] we're gonna go after our ion all right
[00:20:15] Mike good luck my friend good luck my

[00:24:00] because you think it's a better deal I
[00:24:01] don't care that's your choice but this
[00:24:03] is the deal I'm good with that's why I
[00:24:05] put it at sudden death so how you guys
[00:24:08] we'll get let's get that wheel spinning
[00:24:12] again all right so we do like the idea
[00:24:14] of the big hit box there so my idea what
[00:24:17] I was going to end up doing my wife and
[00:24:19] I were talking about it because she saw
[00:24:21] like there's some people that had like
[00:24:22] um some of the other streams they were
[00:24:23] having like $1,000 items and stuff in
[00:24:25] their pole boxes and and um cuz she
[00:24:27] happened to pop in a Pokemon stream to
[00:24:29] watch with the you want to see what they
[00:24:30] were doing that because of uh kids watch
[00:24:32] Pokemon stuff and she was like oh these
[00:24:35] cards are always that I'm like yeah I
[00:24:36] don't have anything that much so what
[00:24:38] I'm thinking of doing is what I'm
[00:24:41] thinking of doing is we're going to take
[00:24:46] um a thousand of the cards out of our
[00:24:48] cards that are a dollar and under put
[00:24:50] them all in here and it'll be a dollar
[00:24:52] for each one of the polls but the pull
[00:24:54] box chance will be a collector Booster
[00:24:56] Box
[00:24:58] that's what we were thinking of doing
[00:25:00] something like that you know what you're
[00:25:01] getting because literally the monetary
[00:25:03] value of the card but you have the
[00:25:05] potential of getting a collector booster
[00:25:08] whole box of it and now that's what we
[00:25:10] were thinking there I don't know if it's
[00:25:12] an intriguing thing for anybody but
[00:25:15] that's what we that's what we're
[00:25:16] debating you know what let's see if we
[00:25:17] can get a monoc crypt out of this right
[00:25:18] now I was just thinking what card to go
[00:25:20] with yeah so that's what we were
[00:25:22] thinking of maybe trying that's why I
[00:25:24] was doing like a thousand cards all are
[00:25:27] going to be like a dollar but there'll
[00:25:29] be one of them that has written on it
[00:25:31] collector booster of murders of Carl
[00:25:33] Manor know so that's why I was thinking
[00:25:36] of doing the uh that cheap the big hit
[00:25:38] cheap one say you want to add it into
[00:25:40] something you know say hey give me uh
[00:25:41] give me a couple of big hits with my my
[00:25:44] pack you know that type of thing it was
[00:25:46] what we were thinking I don't
[00:25:48] know or little little bit little big hit
[00:25:51] or whatever we want to call it the
[00:25:52] little John
[00:25:54] hit that's I just that's what I'm going
[00:25:56] to call I'm going to call it the little
[00:25:57] John hit BX
[00:25:58] you know like uh like you know like
[00:26:00] Robin Hood Little John I'm sorry I'm
[00:26:02] talking I'm not even putting up stuff
[00:26:03] I'm sorry let me put the pack deal up
[00:26:05] let me stop talking oh
[00:26:07] God sometimes I get
[00:26:09] sidetracked we're gonna put this one at
[00:26:12] there we go that's a good one there
[00:26:14] three packs on
[00:26:16] screen that is a good deal for those
[00:26:19] ones that's a really good deal for those
[00:26:21] three yeah but that's what we're
[00:26:23] thinking so maybe we'll get that
[00:26:24] together tonight that way like if you
[00:26:27] guys want to like grab a pack and try
[00:26:28] your luck
[00:26:30] on if you can pick pull out a collector
[00:26:32] booster pack you know that that's really
[00:26:35] want to boil down to pretty much we're
[00:26:36] going to like fill up one of these whole
[00:26:38] lines and one card in it we'll say
[00:26:41] collector booster but everything else is
[00:26:42] going to be cards that are anywhere is
[00:26:44] from like I don't know they're all
[00:26:46] generally collector booster pack cards
[00:26:48] that we're opening so they're going to
[00:26:49] probably be anywhere
[00:26:50] from 10 cents to a125 to $150 in
[00:26:55] it so the chances are what you're
[00:26:57] getting you know what you're getting
[00:26:58] because you're only spending a dollar
[00:26:59] but yeah that's our pack deal right now
[00:27:02] three packs on screen pretty good
[00:27:06] there and what I'll do then is I'm G to
[00:27:10] put up a
[00:27:11] different pack deal and while that other
[00:27:13] pack deal is up I am going to show off
[00:27:17] some of our singles because I know we
[00:27:19] some people like the singles we
[00:27:21] have you guys having a good Tuesday
[00:27:23] though Tuesday
[00:27:25] morning you're morning on this Tuesday
[00:27:28] going
[00:27:39] well well I was that's what I was saying
[00:27:42] that's why I was I don't know I was
[00:27:43] going to put a collector of I was saying
[00:27:46] a collector of this that's why it would
[00:27:48] be a thousand you know what I
[00:27:53] mean that's why it was only one in there
[00:27:56] because it's a I mean it's a Lord of the
[00:27:58] Rings collector booster that's a
[00:28:01] $400 $400 collector booster that's why I
[00:28:04] was doing it that way but uh that's why
[00:28:07] we were thinking of that's why it was
[00:28:08] like a one big hit
[00:28:11] chance yeah Carlo or so like like a
[00:28:15] Carlo or like something like this
[00:28:17] depending on what we were thinking like
[00:28:19] a thousand or like 500 to a thousand
[00:28:21] like a thousand of them or like fill it
[00:28:23] up fill the Box up and put one of them
[00:28:25] in one of these ones in here because I
[00:28:26] think a th of them to, 1500 fit in there
[00:28:29] so I'm trying to figure out how much to
[00:28:31] do and it was just like a one time big
[00:28:33] hit thing because each card is going to
[00:28:34] be about a dollar
[00:28:39] anyways oh wi one collector pack or a
[00:28:41] mid ceiling I like that idea dupe I like
[00:28:44] that idea dup that could work too that
[00:28:47] could work too do a couple of the mid
[00:28:49] ones throw a couple of random packs in
[00:28:51] say like collector booster
[00:28:53] of O we'll throw like collector boosters
[00:28:56] like one random collector booster of
[00:28:58] like ion you get a collector booster of
[00:29:01] like we'll throw random Commander
[00:29:03] Masters in there type thing like that
[00:29:05] you're
[00:29:08] thinking yeah I get that I get that not
[00:29:12] a bad idea yeah get a good chance of
[00:29:13] getting something that's not a bad idea
[00:29:15] I can do that like we'll put one
[00:29:17] collector booster and then throw in a
[00:29:19] spe a speckle in some
[00:29:22] packs speckling some packs yeah that's
[00:29:25] not a bad idea that's not a bad I keep
[00:29:28] forgetting to put up the pack deal oh
[00:29:30] God guys gez I keep talking you g to
[00:29:33] remind me you want cards here that I
[00:29:34] need to stop talking
[00:29:37] sometimes that's not a bad idea oh
[00:29:39] that's not supposed to be a minus why am
[00:29:40] I doing a minus that's not working it's
[00:29:43] not gonna well I mean you guys would
[00:29:45] like a negative um negative $110 deal
[00:29:48] there but uh that's not supposed to work
[00:29:50] that
[00:29:51] way plus I don't think they're going to
[00:29:54] let me put negatives on anyways
[00:29:59] that was pretty weird my calculation was
[00:30:01] wrong there I think I put the wrong
[00:30:03] thing I put it in the wrong spot that's
[00:30:05] why I had the wrong spot being
[00:30:07] pulled we'll do
[00:30:10] this cookie mama bought something oh
[00:30:13] Cookie you did not I'm sorry thank you
[00:30:16] cookie cookie Mama thank you I did not
[00:30:18] notice that I appreciate that cookie you
[00:30:23] know what sometimes when I had the polls
[00:30:25] up for whatever reason it doesn't always
[00:30:27] go across the screen there I kept
[00:30:30] telling
[00:30:39] you I'm sorry I'm sorry I am so sorry
[00:30:42] there let me get your things though
[00:30:44] though I see what you did there oh
[00:30:45] that's good you went with the mystery
[00:30:47] box we like the carnival game oh the
[00:30:50] carnival game's fun all right let me get
[00:30:52] out the tops for this let me get out the
[00:30:54] to Tops for
[00:30:56] this
[00:30:59] yeah it is an expensive one that's the
[00:31:00] only problem it took me a long time to
[00:31:02] find that as cheap as I was able to find
[00:31:04] it and I have actually some coming in a
[00:31:06] little bit cheaper and I might need be
[00:31:07] able to adjust so here we go this is
[00:31:09] what we got here we have the father's
[00:31:12] box the sun's box and the buyer's box
[00:31:16] and this is what we do is a Mystery Pack
[00:31:17] game here now each one of the packs
[00:31:19] that's in here you see what's in there
[00:31:21] if you look in the um in what you what
[00:31:23] it says there it says the average the
[00:31:25] ceiling the floor what you have in there
[00:31:27] the amount of packs that you have for
[00:31:29] those three of them so you get all those
[00:31:31] in there all those packs are in here
[00:31:34] those um amounts of packs are in here so
[00:31:36] you tell me where to go for your I'm
[00:31:38] gonna have you go for the sun in the
[00:31:40] buyer box just because my son's not here
[00:31:42] normally one of the suns are here and
[00:31:43] that's why we did the game is so we have
[00:31:45] my son would pick one of these out of
[00:31:46] here for you I would pick one you'd pick
[00:31:48] one and we'd see see whose um Dart was
[00:31:51] the best but what we do is we rip these
[00:31:53] packs open that are pulled out so for
[00:31:56] instance um the other day let me
[00:31:59] see like
[00:32:02] yesterday someone pulled out like one
[00:32:04] that I think I know that was it where'
[00:32:06] to go no it's not there anymore they're
[00:32:10] not there anymore I got rid of them but
[00:32:11] anyways you pull them out we line them
[00:32:13] up we flip them over and it's going to
[00:32:16] say um play booster it's GNA say ion set
[00:32:21] it's going to say mystery booster or
[00:32:24] collector booster we RI those packs open
[00:32:26] and we see which one has the highest
[00:32:28] mono value and that's the one that hits
[00:32:30] its
[00:32:31] Target um I think I put that in the
[00:32:33] notes and if I do not have that
[00:32:35] information in the notes right now
[00:32:36] please yell at me because I normally do
[00:32:38] put it in the notes so that being said
[00:32:41] where do you want to go on your mystery
[00:32:43] packs hey Venom how you doing Rad Dad
[00:32:46] thanks for coming in again yes Stingray
[00:32:49] it is wicked expensive I know and that
[00:32:50] took me a while to get those but
[00:32:51] thinking of putting something like a
[00:32:53] deal thing like that notes aren't pinned
[00:32:56] oh they're not
[00:32:59] pinned thank
[00:33:08] you this is what I'm talking about where
[00:33:10] I hit save and it doesn't always
[00:33:13] save there we go it's too early
[00:33:17] sometimes it is too early for me like
[00:33:20] when I have to it's not necess too early
[00:33:22] it's more I get up and then I have to do
[00:33:23] all the ordinary routines and it gets me
[00:33:25] flustered I think that's what it is
[00:33:29] all right buddy so you did this here all
[00:33:33] right so let's uh let's see where you
[00:33:37] want to go for this here we can do
[00:33:41] um anywhere tell me where to go random I
[00:33:45] can pick a certain number it's up to you
[00:33:49] in that big box that we're thinking of
[00:33:50] doing got some better ideas for you guys
[00:33:52] it'll be like a thousand cards that are
[00:33:54] a dollar and under on some of the cards
[00:33:56] will be WR written some collector
[00:33:58] boosters but the big hits either going
[00:33:59] to be depending on how many collector
[00:34:02] booster packs I put in it's either going
[00:34:04] to be a l of the Rings or one of my
[00:34:06] other collector boosters because if I
[00:34:08] only put a few collector boosters in
[00:34:09] then it'll be a low of the Rings but if
[00:34:11] it's going to be like a bunch of
[00:34:14] collector boosters then it might be one
[00:34:15] of the other ones so I'm gonna I'll have
[00:34:16] to decide do you want the lord of rings
[00:34:18] as the big one the
[00:34:20] front it's too early front two and
[00:34:25] 21 all right so you get three three of
[00:34:27] them though so you get three picks so
[00:34:28] the front Lord of the Rings is the big
[00:34:31] one all right we'll do the Lord of the
[00:34:32] Rings I like that we can do that front
[00:34:35] Okay front here 21 one two three four
[00:34:39] five six seven 8 nine 10 11 12 13 14 15
[00:34:46] 16 17 18 19 20 21 now do you want that
[00:34:49] for the buyer or the sun's box because I
[00:34:53] was letting you pick for both of those
[00:34:54] since the sun's not
[00:34:55] here
[00:34:59] all right we'll do the Lord of the Rings
[00:35:00] one I like that I think I'm son all
[00:35:01] right now for the buyer box where do you
[00:35:03] want that to
[00:35:07] go and then yeah we'll do Lord of the
[00:35:10] Rings then I like that I'll do that back
[00:35:12] 21 I like
[00:35:15] it hey that's okay I like it you have
[00:35:18] your own method I like people that have
[00:35:20] their methods you know back
[00:35:23] 21 one two three four five 5 6 7 8 9 10
[00:35:30] 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 and 21
[00:35:38] that's the buyer one right there all
[00:35:40] right then I will pick it out for the
[00:35:41] father just as I normally do all right
[00:35:44] I'm gonna pick this one out this is

[00:36:21] drafts I let you put it back and try
[00:36:24] again for another one because we don't
[00:36:26] like when you get two drafts at the same
[00:36:27] time or two lows I consider the drafts
[00:36:30] as some of the low ones so I like to
[00:36:32] give you at least an opportunity to go
[00:36:34] for it okay the front three all right I
[00:36:37] can't always guarantee it's gonna get
[00:36:38] you anything but I like to give you the
[00:36:41] chance G to put this randomly in

[00:37:12] Caverns AR
[00:37:14] rabika and an
[00:37:17] AFR set here we
[00:37:20] go so this is how this goes
[00:37:23] now we are going to rip open the fathers
[00:37:26] then we're going to rip open the Suns
[00:37:28] then we're going to rip open the buyers
[00:37:30] now what happens is we're going to see
[00:37:31] whoever has the highest mono value Raba
[00:37:34] is great definitely good you get a good
[00:37:36] chance of getting yourself a uh a nice
[00:37:38] chalk land in that well you g you see
[00:37:40] who has the highest mono value whichever
[00:37:41] one has the highest mono value is the
[00:37:43] one that hits its Target and I start
[00:37:45] with the father's box because I like to
[00:37:47] see uh see what happens there now
[00:37:49] remember so you can kind of see with the
[00:37:50] smiley faces the father's box you kind
[00:37:52] of just get a card the son's box it
[00:37:54] might be something you might want to
[00:37:55] play sometimes it is is sometimes it
[00:37:57] isn't but the buyer watching might maybe
[00:37:59] it's an extra pack maybe it's a good
[00:38:00] card one two three four and five because
[00:38:02] we like the spoilers at the end here
[00:38:04] maybe it's a good card maybe it's an
[00:38:06] extra pack but that's kind of how we go
[00:38:08] there calaminus

[00:39:00] six I don't think it was too I don't
[00:39:02] think there was a really really high
[00:39:03] card in
[00:39:04] this I think it was a five yeah it was
[00:39:07] that five there all right so that five
[00:39:10] is your high card there so we have to

[00:52:56] why if I
[00:52:58] didn't no I don't know why my brain was
[00:53:01] just broken right there because I had
[00:53:02] put the other one down there I feel like

[00:53:06] around and I moved the wrong one I don't
[00:53:09] know we're good but thank you for saying
[00:53:10] we're good thank you I know my brain
[00:53:12] just broke there for a second all right
[00:53:13] here we go father let's see we're GNA
[00:53:15] start with the father we go to the son
[00:53:17] we're gonna see what the high card is
[00:53:19] let's see if we can get us a sweet
[00:53:22] Dragon some sweet dragons
[00:53:28] that stuck to the front there there we

[00:53:46] dder dder dder dder Earth cult
[00:53:50] Elemental ochre jelly oh nice little
[00:53:53] ochre jelly that's a pretty good card if
[00:53:55] I remember right meteor swarm that's a
[00:53:58] nice one too in trepid Outlander foil
[00:54:02] and your token treasure card all right
[00:54:06] so we have the high card you do have a
[00:54:09] couple nice cards there the meteor swarm
[00:54:10] and the ocher jelly but uh the high card
[00:54:13] is a six there I
[00:54:18] believe that's a high card there nice
[00:54:21] let me get these two though in in a
[00:54:23] little Penny sleeve here so high card is
[00:54:27] a six right now high card is
[00:54:33] six let's see what we get in the Sun but
[00:54:36] hey there's big
[00:54:38] dinos in the uh and there's big dragons
[00:54:41] here obviously in the AFR stuff so who
[00:54:44] knows it could be something ridiculous
[00:54:45] in either of these for for mono value
[00:54:47] all right oh nice little blue dragon I
[00:54:49] like that art card Forest oh a red
[00:54:51] dragon there you go you are even tied
[00:54:53] already nice red red dragon and a cult
[00:54:56] element Earth cult Elemental right off
[00:54:58] top there hoarding ogre spoilers of the
[00:55:02] hunt TR Lasara moondancer lurking Roper
[00:55:07] rally
[00:55:08] maneuver clever
[00:55:10] conjurer wild shape Paladin
[00:55:15] class borrowing of Clan andar foil nice
[00:55:18] Paladin class though I don't see that
[00:55:21] one come out for
[00:55:23] frequently that's a good little card but
[00:55:26] here you go I think your top cards here
[00:55:28] were the red dragon and the Earth cult
[00:55:30] Elemental now with that being too you
[00:55:32] actually do beat the son the the father
[00:55:35] because there's two of those so let's do
[00:55:38] this
[00:55:40] here double double six on that yep so
[00:55:44] that you you're GNA end up winning if it
[00:55:45] ends up being a tie between you and the
[00:55:47] F the father I mean it's gonna end up
[00:55:48] being the son between the um the father
[00:55:51] and the son if it ends up being a tie
[00:55:53] because uh it's got two sixes versus the
[00:55:55] one but let's see if we can get a SE a
[00:55:57] six seven or
[00:55:59] higher out of our lost Caverns for our
[00:56:01] buyers box here for you let's see if we
[00:56:04] can get a seven or higher from our lost
[00:56:05] Caverns all
[00:56:08] right G to do this
[00:56:12] here Excell on Art card one two three
[00:56:16] four and five because we like the
[00:56:18] spoilers at the end not the beginning we
[00:56:20] don't like the spoilers the beginning

[00:56:55] that's a nice list
[00:56:58] card if I remember right that's a pretty
[00:57:01] good list

[00:57:04] card yeah n's rule I was gonna say
[00:57:06] that's pretty good list card if I
[00:57:07] remember all right I think the high here
[00:57:10] was only a four though I think it was
[00:57:13] only a four here nope
[00:57:16] five all right so it does look like the
[00:57:18] high though was
[00:57:20] A5 which is the daring discovery which
[00:57:23] means the tie is between the Sun
[00:57:25] and the father but because the son had
[00:57:28] two you get a pull from the son's box
[00:57:31] because the son had two sixes we all saw

[01:06:06] little hit there hidden volcano and a
[01:06:09] vampire token all right so we had a few
[01:06:12] uh I think we had a few sixes in here we
[01:06:15] had a few sixes in here we had conso EOS
[01:06:18] and I don't think there was anything
[01:06:19] other than six in there no there was the
[01:06:22] seven marauding Brian Fane Maring Brian
[01:06:24] Fang was a seven oh the then that's the
[01:06:27] other six that I saw all right so we had
[01:06:28] a seven and two sixes all right so we're
[01:06:31] going to have a little bit to beat on
[01:06:32] that one but hey let's see what we can
[01:06:34] do here with our murders now murders
[01:06:36] doesn't have big ones here but murders
[01:06:39] does have some pretty cool
[01:06:41] cards hey you know what that kind of
[01:06:42] benefits you though when it comes to uh
[01:06:45] potentially with the buyer box right I
[01:06:48] think they did it here to one two three
[01:06:50] four five one two three four five oh I
[01:06:55] love how they did that when they put the
[01:06:56] art cards in the to on the back of the
[01:06:59] tokens oh elegant parlor nice hit right
[01:07:04] off the bat I guess it was six not five
[01:07:08] there you go a little elegant parlor let
[01:07:10] me uh let me put that off the side to

[01:07:37] and Relic
[01:07:39] wander swamp foil and a clue look at
[01:07:42] that you got a tie even you're
[01:07:46] tied with a seven I don't think I saw
[01:07:49] any
[01:07:50] sixes but you are tied with a seven
[01:07:52] right now what that means is though if
[01:07:54] you get three of them that are sevens
[01:07:56] and you tie three with three
[01:07:58] sevens you end up being the uh winner
[01:08:01] because if you get a three-way tie I
[01:08:02] feel like you need to
[01:08:06] win you get up to three rares in a play
[01:08:09] set nice yeah so if you get it let's see
[01:08:12] maybe maybe you're gonna get that
[01:08:13] three-way tie it happens every now and
[01:08:15] again very rarely do I see the three-way
[01:08:18] tie but do we get a three-way here but
[01:08:21] you know every now and again we get a
[01:08:22] three-way
[01:08:25] generally she says no
[01:08:27] though we
[01:08:29] tried never really successful but this
[01:08:32] one seems like it might be a successful
[01:08:34] three-way three-way tie
[01:08:38] here one two three four five one two
[01:08:42] three four five we're talking about

[01:09:08] aguer sanguin evangelist not bad and a
[01:09:12] sunshot militia not bad there not bad
[01:09:16] there but I think your high card was
[01:09:19] only a
[01:09:20] three I don't think it was I don't think
[01:09:23] you had a high oh no you had a five no
[01:09:25] you did have five though you had five
[01:09:28] but nothing really big on that one so it
[01:09:31] is I think we have the tie here and then
[01:09:35] there's the six so it goes was there any
[01:09:37] sixes one was there any sixes in
[01:09:40] here I don't think there were any sixes
[01:09:43] in here because we go down I think it
[01:09:45] was only five I think it was only a five
[01:09:47] I don't think there was a six in there
[01:09:49] let me double check though no it was
[01:09:51] only a five but hey we're going to get a
[01:09:53] a pull from the father father's just
[01:09:55] kind of like a little extra card
[01:09:57] sometime but you got yourself a nice
[01:09:58] little uh nice little elegant parlor
[01:10:01] there that's a nice

[01:20:15] so I do think the Suns box had the win
[01:20:17] with the eight though I don't think
[01:20:19] there was anything higher than an eight
[01:20:21] that came out of this so let me just
[01:20:22] take us a second and double
[01:20:24] check but I don't believe there was
[01:20:26] anything that was an eight in
[01:20:29] here there was no eight in here when I
[01:20:31] was looking all right well I was right
[01:20:33] there is no eight in there but hey you

[01:20:47] big blue book which every time it gets
[01:20:50] spun I don't know if there's 36 in there

[01:20:59] the Suns box here uh I have to rebuild
[01:21:02] it all right number 11 all right number

[01:21:22] card there for you all right nice hit
[01:21:26] though on that feather radiant Arbiter
[01:21:28] foil though and a k Spirit Justice a
[01:21:30] anime or the extended art
[01:21:33] one nice we like
[01:21:37] that the Big Blue Book plus a pack yes I
[01:21:41] will tell you exactly what that is so
[01:21:43] what it is is you pick a pack and we do
[01:21:45] I pretty much I do a pack deal for you
[01:21:47] guys with the big blue book A lot of
[01:21:49] people will be like you know what hey
[01:21:50] the Big Blue Book's pretty sweet here
[01:21:52] but hey can I get a um Los Caverns
[01:21:54] Exelon with the big blue book at the
[01:21:57] same time I'm like you know what yo I'm
[01:21:58] good with that and somebody made that
[01:22:00] comment and so I made made it into a one
[01:22:02] with it so here it would be like this I
[01:22:04] would go here right now it's going to be
[01:22:08] $49 for the Big Blue Book
[01:22:11] plus a lost Cavern Exelon collector
[01:22:14] booster right now and you get that spin
[01:22:17] of the Big Blue Book which is that wheel
[01:22:19] up in the that corner there and uh for
[01:22:22] you that do not know what that is there
[01:22:24] is $81 81 spots every time a spot is
[01:22:28] pulled all right it ends up becoming a
[01:22:31] collector booster of murders at Carlo
[01:22:33] Manor so every time this uh spots pulled
[01:22:36] this this Blue Book gets
[01:22:39] bigger um and then there's cards in
[01:22:41] there where the high value is a $90 card
[01:22:44] which is the uh balin's tomb and then
[01:22:46] there are also other cards in there like
[01:22:48] $50 uh $60 $30 $40 but any card that you
[01:22:52] get is $10 and less will get you one of
[01:22:57] uh five packs of cards it's like
[01:22:58] collector Bo set boosters or stuff like
[01:23:00] that but if you get one that is $5 or
[01:23:02] less you get one of two of those CH
[01:23:04] choices or one of the collector boosters
[01:23:06] that I give you the option of so kind of
[01:23:09] cool deal there for those that would
[01:23:12] like to try their luck on it there you
[01:23:13] go a scorpion there we go a scorpion so
[01:23:17] I'll do this here I'm going to put this
[01:23:19] back let's do it with a you know let's
[01:23:21] guarantee yourself a murders May maybe
[01:23:22] you want to get that Murders At Carlo
[01:23:24] Manor let's guarantee us one right now
[01:23:28] I'm going to do the big blue book where
[01:23:30] they Murders At Carlo Manor all right
[01:23:34] and this is going to go on
[01:23:37] for this right here for those that want
[01:23:40] it and I'm going to show off the big
[01:23:41] blue book while that's just sitting in
[01:23:42] the back there all right now one of the
[01:23:45] floors have been hit so this is how it
[01:23:47] goes there $2,222 in this book that was
[01:23:49] a coincidence by the way I didn't do
[01:23:51] that on purpose that like happy
[01:23:52] coincidence $881 81 spots generally $22
[01:23:56] per spot if you do it by yourself
[01:23:57] ceiling is $90 the floor is $1 to $20
[01:24:00] cards average is about $27 but that
[01:24:03] average goes up as something gets pulled
[01:24:05] out because they it becomes a collector
[01:24:06] booster of M at carloff so that average
[01:24:08] end up goes up every Blank Spot then
[01:24:10] their floors are between nine there's
[01:24:13] nine of them between $5 and $20 and
[01:24:14] there's 10 between 11 and $14 where one
[01:24:17] of them have already been pulled so that
[01:24:18] means there's only 18 floors and one of
[01:24:20] those floors are now a collector boost
[01:24:23] but these are the cards that you have
[01:24:24] the option of maybe you get a force a
[01:24:25] negation and everybody lives maybe you
[01:24:28] want yourself something like a Lord of
[01:24:30] the Rings collector
[01:24:32] booster maybe you want yourself like a a
[01:24:35] consecrated Sphinx ristic study Aela
[01:24:39] Exemplar of Justice
[01:24:42] foil maybe you want yourself a uh
[01:24:45] balin's tomb watery grave retro foil
[01:24:49] steam vents retro foil Temple Garden
[01:24:51] retro foil a Tan's tide Bender is what's
[01:24:54] considered the low here for a foil and
[01:24:56] say somehow you get a card here this one
[01:24:58] here the Maze of ifth it's a $5 card
[01:25:00] anything that's $5 and under you get
[01:25:03] your choice of any of
[01:25:08] these any of these any two of
[01:25:15] these any two of
[01:25:19] these any one of these plus one of these
[01:25:23] or a Dungeons and Dragons collector
[01:25:26] booster your choice if you happen to get
[01:25:28] a card that's under $5 now if you get a
[01:25:30] card that's $10 and under you can get a
[01:25:33] choice of any one of these packs here
[01:25:37] and that's uh that's how that big blue
[01:25:39] book goes which is why it's a pretty
[01:25:41] good deal pretty good deal because as it
[01:25:43] goes the Big Blue Book becomes a better
[01:25:46] deal every single day and I'm going to
[01:25:48] end up redoing it with uh different
[01:25:50] cards probably the end of the week if
[01:25:52] you don't get it going well here but
[01:25:53] we'll see what it goes if you want to
[01:25:55] try a luck but what I'm going to do now

[01:30:03] here let's do it
[01:30:07] murders a collector Play and a draft I
[01:30:11] think that's a good
[01:30:15] deal that's a good deal there we're
[01:30:18] going to call that three packs on screen
[01:30:26] there we go the mean hook Maser is sick
[01:30:28] you have four of them
[01:30:30] now wow yeah you know I've seen a I like
[01:30:33] I've seen a few people opening them and
[01:30:34] I'm like oh that's pretty fun so that's
[01:30:36] our pack deal we got there and I'm gonna
[01:30:38] go through our singles for a little bit
[01:30:40] here and then we're GNA build out a uh
[01:30:44] talk about building out a PL see what
[01:30:46] I'm going to plan on doing is like using
[01:30:47] these singles that I have a lot of these
[01:30:49] dollar singles I'm going to put them in
[01:30:51] there in the um in the pull box that I'm
[01:30:53] talking about so all these like kind of
[01:30:55] dollar singles are going to end up going
[01:30:57] in there and then what I'm going to have
[01:30:59] is um we'll have on some of them we'll
[01:31:03] have written like collector booster of
[01:31:05] say ion a collector booster of ioria a
[01:31:10] collector booster of Commander Masters
[01:31:12] and then one of them is gonna have a
[01:31:15] Lord of the Rings collector booster um
[01:31:20] box
[01:31:22] that's what we're going to end up doing
[01:31:23] for our cheap in big hit
[01:31:27] box I think that's what we're going to
[01:31:28] end up doing what do you
[01:31:30] think but here's some of our singles
[01:31:32] there for those that want them just
[01:31:34] scrolling through a few of them here if
[01:31:37] anybody wants any let me know you can
[01:31:39] put off the side of your name on it got
[01:31:40] a new pugnacious Hammer
[01:31:44] skull let's go here come on people we
[01:31:48] got uh we had some people in earlier and
[01:31:50] they are bumping around it looks like
[01:31:51] like I'm guessing somebody else jumped
[01:31:53] in and they're starting to do a
[01:31:54] giveaways so they go into the giveaway
[01:31:56] streams and I don't do those frequently
[01:31:58] because I try to just give deals instead
[01:32:00] I feel like there's one of the things
[01:32:01] that I I noticed is like there's a lot
[01:32:03] of the things that have frequent
[01:32:05] giveaways the
[01:32:07] odds for all of their boxes are
[01:32:10] generally like the one that the big box
[01:32:12] that I'm talking about building and
[01:32:14] that's why I think they're able to do
[01:32:16] the giveaways so frequently so that's
[01:32:19] why I try to like I don't try to do that
[01:32:21] I try to get better odds so that's why I
[01:32:23] think I'm not able to do giveaways like
[01:32:24] they are you know I don't have I don't
[01:32:26] have like a $300 swing in a box to be
[01:32:30] able to do giveaways like they do on a
[01:32:32] regular basis but that's because I try
[01:32:34] to build them to be more competitive for
[01:32:36] you guys so you can get more plls out of
[01:32:38] it that's
[01:32:41] why all right guys
[01:32:44] so for you that are in here hanging out
[01:32:47] with
[01:32:48] me all right for you that are in here
[01:32:50] hanging out with me
[01:32:52] I know there's a
[01:32:54] few we're going to put
[01:32:56] on a pack deal with a big blue
[01:33:00] book now this is going to be packs
[01:33:07] deal we're gonna do the big blue book
[01:33:11] here here we are
[01:33:15] plus
[01:33:17] a Mera Carlo mystery booster and on
[01:33:24] set here for the deals not the gies
[01:33:26] exactly that's why I see like people I
[01:33:28] try to like the chances of getting a
[01:33:30] giveaway when there's like 50 people all
[01:33:31] the time I don't have that I don't have
[01:33:33] the luck I know I don't so I kind of
[01:33:34] just kind of give it up on that option
[01:33:37] and that's why I was like I don't even
[01:33:38] I'm not even gonna bother because I know
[01:33:39] my luck is not there so with my luck not
[01:33:42] being there I'm just like screw it who
[01:33:44] cares I'm gonna do my own thing and I go
[01:33:47] and hang out with the places generally I
[01:33:48] can get a deal on stuff because I know
[01:33:49] there's no way I'm going to be able to
[01:33:50] buy in and get something something like
[01:33:52] the ones that are doing like uh pretty
[01:33:54] good deals for like the B buying in or
[01:33:56] something on like on on their auctions
[01:33:59] I'll jump into those ones more
[01:34:00] frequently because I have a better
[01:34:01] chance of getting something versus
[01:34:05] uh actually like in one of the Raffles
[01:34:07] but that's because I have horrible luck
[01:34:09] personally but if I'm doing stuff for
[01:34:11] other people as you see earlier I pull
[01:34:13] out ridiculous stuff like out of the
[01:34:15] mystery booster box you saw what I
[01:34:16] pulled out for you Ace
[01:34:18] right so it's just sometimes I don't
[01:34:23] have personal lot but I pass that lock
[01:34:25] on to other people you
[01:34:35] know that's really what it
[01:34:38] is that's a good deal for those packs on
[01:34:40] screen there
[01:34:46] Ace three packs on screen good deal
[01:34:48] right

[01:43:04] we don't mind if you don't mind we'll
[01:43:05] keep them to do that with but it's up to
[01:43:09] you it's up to
[01:43:11] you obviously because they're your
[01:43:13] card but some people don't keep the r
[01:43:15] cards so they don't really care so I'm

[01:43:34] to that pack
[01:43:36] deal we're going to do this here but
[01:43:38] this time we're going to do it with a
[01:43:40] big blue book

[01:44:25] there we
[01:44:27] go there we
[01:44:29] go we're gonna do this these three packs
[01:44:32] right here plus the Big Blue Book
[01:44:36] spin now remember that big blue book
[01:44:39] $2,222 expands every time a spot is p
[01:44:42] picked become that Blank Spot becomes a
[01:44:44] murderers at Carlo man or collector
[01:44:46] booster that's why the big blue book is
[01:44:48] really cool so one of the floors have
[01:44:51] been hit so that means there's only 18
[01:44:52] of them available ceiling is $90 which
[01:44:55] is our balin's
[01:44:59] tomb we got a Balin suan here which is
[01:45:02] our top card we also have stuff like
[01:45:05] watery grve retro foil Temple Garden
[01:45:08] retro foil little steam vents retro foil
[01:45:11] we have L of the Rings collector booster
[01:45:13] maybe yourself a ristic study an Aela
[01:45:16] Exemplar of
[01:45:18] Justice now maybe do we put another L
[01:45:21] Rings collector booster in there now all
[01:45:22] those blank spots that are numbered if
[01:45:24] you hit one of those it becomes a
[01:45:26] collector booster of murders at Carlo
[01:45:28] Manor and say for instance you get this
[01:45:32] one here where it is a tree beard eldis
[01:45:34] events where it is under $5 all right if
[01:45:37] the pack is under $ five you get your
[01:45:40] choice of any of
[01:45:44] these two packs of cards
[01:45:47] or you can add one of these plus one of
[01:45:51] these or you could get a collector
[01:45:54] booster of Dungeons and Dragons so I
[01:45:55] give you choices here now if you get 10
[01:45:58] and under 10 between 10 and5 you get
[01:46:00] your choice of any one of these packs
[01:46:04] that's a really good deal for that big
[01:46:05] blue book where you spin that it's kind
[01:46:07] of hard to lose especially the more we
[01:46:09] play because there's more all those end
[01:46:11] up being like M at Carlo Manor that's
[01:46:15] why it's a cool uh really cool

[01:46:20] opposite of dgen like these people do
[01:46:23] these D gen ones and it's kind of the
[01:46:24] opposite of it I don't know how to say

[01:37:44] on the screen
[01:37:46] here let me get it on screen here
[01:37:56] go small Raider has come out in front of
[01:37:58] you and you see this small Raider in the
[01:38:00] distance what are you gonna do my friend
[01:38:03] you have an assault rifle and a strength
[01:38:06] booster this guy's not a big strength
[01:38:08] guy he's only got a he's only got 50
[01:38:10] Health but who knows what's going to
[01:38:13] attack you're going to attack him with a
[01:38:14] gun all right you're going to pull that
[01:38:16] assault rifle
[01:38:18] out oh sorry 545 yeah five five 555 I'm
[01:38:23] sorry
[01:38:24] Cook Out on the grill all right that
[01:38:27] strong human takes out his assault rifle
[01:38:29] and three shots go
[01:38:32] off all right three shots are taken off
[01:38:34] here and oh my it's a good
[01:38:39] job that small Raider has been hit
[01:38:42] Direct Hit but they're mad at you and
[01:38:44] they come charging and they swing their
[01:38:46] sword and they hit you all right so you
[01:38:50] have 150 Health as the strong human
[01:38:56] here why is that not
[01:39:02] working there you go he hits you for 10
[01:39:07] damage bring you down to 140 but as that
[01:39:10] 50 for them you got a good hit on them
[01:39:12] bring with 25 bring him down to 25 what
[01:39:14] would you like to do for your uh now as
[01:39:16] you attack your character
[01:39:26] attack again I see attack again use that
[01:39:30] assault rifle he's right next you this
[01:39:31] time though because your big body in the
[01:39:34] way using it to block him and you shoot
[01:39:36] at him with your assault
[01:39:38] rifle oh another Direct Hit does not
[01:39:41] kill him though but weakens him almost
[01:39:42] to death he's now down to Seven health
[01:39:46] but he stabs you with his sword there
[01:39:47] he's got oh that's the wrong one strong
[01:39:51] human but he stabs you with his
[01:39:54] sword and now you have a hole in your
[01:39:56] side but it's a small sword a little rap
[01:39:58] here does not a big hord sword so you
[01:40:01] got a little hole in your side and it
[01:40:02] brings you down from 140 Health to
[01:40:05] 127 health so that was actually a big
[01:40:08] hit on you what are you gonna do now you
[01:40:11] can either let him run away because he's
[01:40:12] almost dead and he's starting to turn
[01:40:14] around and flee or are you gonna finish
[01:40:16] him
[01:40:18] off finish
[01:40:20] him all righty you take your weapon
[01:40:24] you're starting to run low on ammo got a
[01:40:26] few more maybe maybe one four full more
[01:40:28] clip left and you shoot that
[01:40:31] Raider and it does in the process of
[01:40:34] shooting he turns around to run and you
[01:40:36] hit him directly in the
[01:40:38] head one of those shots blowing his
[01:40:41] brains all over that Wasteland ground
[01:40:44] that strong human goes up to him sees it

[04:19:34] your luck is um I don't i' say it's
[04:19:36] through the roof almost this morning you
[04:19:38] need to go and buy yourself a l ticket
[04:19:41] that's all I got to say definitely going
[04:19:43] to go and buy yourself lity ticket I
[04:19:45] still there's still more collector
[04:19:46] boosters that are in there there's still
[04:19:49] more collector boosters in there but I
[04:19:52] don't know if there there's either one
[04:19:53] of these left or if this is the last one
[04:19:55] I'd have to be I think this might have
[04:19:57] been the last one of Fallout but I'm G
[04:19:59] have to double check on that because I
[04:20:01] know I had all those when they were
[04:20:03] built that's been uh so I don't remember
[04:20:05] all of them there you go
[04:20:08] though yes so the boxes in the bag so
[04:20:11] the box is what we were doing actually
[04:20:12] is um they're just kind of um I did had
[04:20:15] built them for playing the uh Adventure
[04:20:17] game with that way you can kind of pick
[04:20:18] out and get um it would give you an item
[04:20:20] playing the adventure game the adventure
[04:20:22] game is the thing where you get to be
[04:20:23] the uh like our
[04:20:26] character with chly whereas our strong
[04:20:28] human which are Patriot strong human
[04:20:30] when you wander through Wast in it helps
[04:20:31] you get like items so like armor or or
[04:20:35] like weapons or health something like
[04:20:37] that now that's what the boxes are and
[04:20:39] they're just all the packs that are in
[04:20:40] there you'll see what's in there that's
[04:20:42] what's available that was in there and
[04:20:44] it's been Whitted down over time though
[04:20:45] like as you can see like they said as
[04:20:47] total was 95 but now it's down 18 or 16
[04:20:50] that's what it is now it's whatever's
[04:20:52] been pulled out uh most of them I can
[04:20:54] tell you are not they're all pretty much
[04:20:56] built on the packs the boxes pretty
[04:20:58] close together but it one comes to the
[04:21:00] um the the mystery bag that was the only
[04:21:03] one that has a big difference where you
[04:21:04] had the floors where uh Commander I mean
[04:21:08] l c xon or um
[04:21:12] there's one other pack I think Lo C on
[04:21:14] was a floor but that's what it would
[04:21:17] give you as a floor on there which is a
[04:21:19] $9 pack when you would pay 20 you know
[04:21:21] $23 or whatever for it and then the um
[04:21:24] but you could also get you know these in
[04:21:26] there because those are all mixed in the
[04:21:28] way I try to do it is I try to kind of
[04:21:29] build it similar to like you be buying a
[04:21:31] pack of
[04:21:32] cards I don't like to do it where like
[04:21:34] you're kind of gambling big where
[04:21:35] somebody's going in there going I'm
[04:21:36] gonna I'm G to spend like you know $300
[04:21:39] and you could possibly get a dollar
[04:21:40] worth of something I don't like to do it
[04:21:42] that way so that's why I kind of like to
[04:21:43] do it where you know you kind of like it
[04:21:46] build it similar to a pack where you
[04:21:48] would buy a pack of cards you might buy
[04:21:49] a pack of cards for 23 bucks but you
[04:21:51] might get something out of there worth
[04:21:52] $9 or you could get something out of
[04:21:53] there worth
[04:21:54] $100 that's kind of why I build them the
[04:21:56] way I do it I build multiple things in
[04:21:58] there so there's multiple chance of
[04:22:00] getting
[04:22:10] them h anyways there we go the
[04:22:21] guy we get R down

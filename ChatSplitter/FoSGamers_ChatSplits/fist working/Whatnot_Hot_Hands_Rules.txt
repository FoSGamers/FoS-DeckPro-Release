In Whatnot's Terms of Service, certain types of "games" like "pack wars" or "box wars," where participants compete for a winner-takes-all scenario, are prohibited. However, using pull boxes in the format you're describing for a Hot Hands event, where a streamer pulls items from a pull box for participants, does not explicitly violate the terms, as long as it adheres to the following:

1. **Transparency**: All pulls or breaks must be fully visible on the stream, ensuring that no products are removed from the frame until they are revealed. This includes showing sealed products, the pull box, and all cards or items from start to finish. Any removal of items from the frame before revealing could result in violations【7†source】【10†source】.

2. **Clear Rules**: You should include clear rules regarding the Hot Hands event in your show notes or item listings. These should explain how the pulls are conducted and what participants can expect to receive. This transparency is required for any type of break or pull activity【7†source】【10†source】.

3. **No Gambling**: Hot Hands should not be conducted in a way that resembles gambling, meaning no games of chance where participants are betting on an outcome. Each participant must receive a card or item as a result of their purchase, even if the value of the item varies【7†source】【8†source】.

In summary, as long as the Hot Hands event ensures transparency, fairness, and compliance with Whatnot’s rules, it should be allowed. Just be cautious to avoid any gambling-like scenarios.

I reviewed Whatnot’s policies, including the latest updates up to September 2024, and here’s what I found regarding your query on "Hot Hands" or pull box events:

1. **Transparency and Visibility**: Whatnot requires that any event involving pulling items from a box, including card breaks or pull boxes, must be fully visible during the live stream. This means that the entire process, from the sealed product to the revealed item, must stay on camera throughout the stream. Removing items from the screen before revealing them can violate these rules【7†source】【16†source】.

2. **Gambling and Prize-Based Sales**: Whatnot explicitly prohibits any gambling or purchase-based prize mechanisms. This includes games where a purchase gives someone a chance to win a more valuable item, as well as raffles or races. However, if each participant receives something of value, such as a guaranteed card from a pull box, and you’re transparent about the process, it should not be considered gambling【17†source】【16†source】.

3. **Clear Rules**: You must outline all rules for the Hot Hands event in your show notes or item listings. This includes explaining how participants can get pulls, what they will receive, and any other important details. Full transparency about the value and process is essential to stay compliant【7†source】【19†source】.

4. **No Participation by Related Individuals**: If you are running a pull box event, it’s important that no family members, employees, or household members participate. This helps avoid any perception of insider participation or bias【17†source】.

As long as the Hot Hands event ensures fairness, full visibility, and compliance with these rules, it should be allowed. Make sure to avoid any gambling-like mechanics, where participants are only buying chances to win without a guaranteed return.

After reviewing Whatnot's **Terms of Service** (TOS) and policies as of September 2024, here are the key points regarding "Hot Hands" or similar pull box events:

1. **Transparency Requirement**: All aspects of the pull box event (like card pulls or breaks) must be fully visible during the live stream. This includes keeping the pull box and products on-screen at all times to ensure transparency【7†source】【16†source】.

2. **Prohibition on Gambling or Purchase-Based Prizes**: Whatnot strictly prohibits gambling-like activities, including games that require a purchase for a chance to win a more valuable item. However, as long as each participant receives a guaranteed item of value (such as a card), this is generally acceptable. Be sure to avoid structuring the event in a way that resembles gambling【16†source】【19†source】【17†source】.

3. **Accurate Descriptions and Rules**: You must provide clear and accurate descriptions of the items involved in the pull. Additionally, the rules of the event (e.g., how pulls work, what participants can expect to receive) must be included in the show notes or product listings【16†source】【25†source】.

4. **No Participation by Related Individuals**: Participants in the event cannot be family members, household members, or employees of the seller. This is to avoid conflicts of interest and ensure fairness【17†source】【16†source】.

By following these guidelines and avoiding gambling elements, you should be in compliance with Whatnot's TOS for Hot Hands or similar pull events. Be sure to stay transparent and adhere to the clear display rules.

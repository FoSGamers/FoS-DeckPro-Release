Take a chat of all the knowledge of everything and make, I want you to make this into a chat so that whenever we want to do a plot somewhere, going from one location to another, you will help us do that in the way and forms that I want, providing us with all the information that I want to make it nice and easy so that someone that's never sailed before can do it. And again, the whole point of you for this point of the chat is that my wife or children would be able to do this by themselves if, say, I got knocked out or something. But you know, it would make it nice and easy for anyone. I'm not going to say that as an example, just giving you guys an example. The reason why I'm building things like this is to assist in case of emergencies and also to assist to teach them, too, so they can ask questions and learn when I'm busy doing something else. So do it the way that I showed you already, the document that I provided you with how I want it done and shown, do it that way and get that shown up and this is what this one chat is for.

Okay, now build the plot from our starting location in St. Thomas at the marina that we'll be at, the last one, the final one that we told you we should have been at. You should have that in the documentation and stuff around somewhere, and then it will also have us go from there to our, to San Juan, Puerto Rico, because we need to go to the airport, and we need to do that on the 21st, so I need you to be doing, like, weather checks and stuff like that, too, even, to see what weather will be like on that time frame for us to be able to go across and need to go where we need to go. You should really have one of those as an example, so go there.

Remember, you should be having some navigational information there on the plot, where exactly we're going and things we're going through, so people will be aware when they're looking at navigational maps, and you should be supporting maps and things like that in there, too. So, maps need to be in there, or at least links to them so they can access them, so they can easily see and chart plots, or even if there's somebody that plotted and done this already, a link to that type of stuff can make easy access to things that have already been done. So, that needs to already be done, and enhance that in that manner.

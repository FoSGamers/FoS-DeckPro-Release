[00:32:53] was excited about Rose higher as Rose is
[00:32:56] one of his favorite characters
[00:32:57] characters it's so far it's his favorite
[00:32:59] companion in the show so I think that

[00:33:05] watches a show on a regular
[00:33:07] basis yeah I know I told you I told
[00:33:12] you I I I stack um I stack the boxes as

[00:33:23] may not be the best but you got multiple
[00:33:25] chances and he pulled out that

[01:11:49] a pack deal
[01:11:50] here but what do you think about the uh
[01:11:53] the like thing there in the pole I got a
[01:11:55] question I've been trying to figure this
[01:11:57] out here it's a it's like
[01:11:59] a it's conundrum because I'm worried
[01:12:02] about not being able to use something
[01:12:03] you know for Christmas but at the same
[01:12:05] time I'm
[01:12:08] going they're going to have

[01:12:35] [Music]

[01:12:43] thinking is like it would be he' be all
[01:12:45] right and like even probably be able to
[01:12:47] pull it off riding
[01:12:52] it
[01:12:55] [Music]

[01:15:21] Pack
[01:15:22] game
[01:15:24] for
[01:15:25] 15 all of the packs that are in my store

[01:16:02] [Music]
[01:16:03] oops we're gonna do the Mystery Pack
[01:16:06] game now get three packs of cards and
[01:16:10] then
[01:16:11] afterwards when you pull it you can do
[01:16:14] what we call the carnival
[01:16:17] game and now the carnival game what we
[01:16:20] do
[01:16:22] is we line up your
[01:16:26] cards in front of these boxes that are
[01:16:28] named the
[01:16:32] Sun the
[01:16:36] buyer and the
[01:16:40] father and we flip those packs open over
[01:16:43] so say for instance they get I got an
[01:16:46] example here for packs these were the
[01:16:48] three packs that were pulled out these
[01:16:49] three cards you flip them over and you
[01:16:50] got a wow set a Brothers war is set in a
[01:16:54] midnight hunt draft now midnight hunt
[01:16:56] draft is out so that wouldn't be there
[01:16:57] anymore it would be a different one we
[01:16:59] crack those open in which everyone has a
[01:17:01] highest Mana value is the one that hits
[01:17:03] its Target and that's the where you get
[01:17:05] an extra pull maybe it's like a carard
[01:17:07] that you can play with maybe it's like
[01:17:09] an extra pack maybe it's like just a
[01:17:11] card who
[01:17:16] [Music]
[01:17:18] knows M sub easily but that's our little
[01:17:23] game

[01:33:39] hit nice little hit there ur's
[01:33:43] command trench stalker
[01:33:47] foil and a throwaway token card first
[01:33:51] command is a nice little hit
[01:33:54] there all right let's go to The
[01:33:57] Wilds sorry no Transformer there I'm
[01:34:00] sorry on that
[01:34:03] one I know if we do a we can do a
[01:34:05] collector boosters they come with

[01:34:11] Kong me junkyard all right we're doing
[01:34:15] it this way oh whoa whoa hold on one two
[01:34:19] three four one two three four oh I think
[01:34:22] it was one more that I needed that's
[01:34:26] okay um they are 25 each but if you want
[01:34:30] I can do like a three- pack deal where
[01:34:33] we do it if you want like a Brothers war
[01:34:35] and three other pack two other packs of
[01:34:38] cards uh just let me know and I can
[01:34:40] figure out a deal for you and I don't
[01:34:42] mind doing that because whenever I do
[01:34:44] three at a time it allows me to do a
[01:34:45] little bit of a deal because the fees of
[01:34:47] whatnot so it
[01:34:49] helps or if you want to do three of
[01:34:52] those they are 64 for three of them
[01:34:54] instead of
[01:34:55] 75 so there are three brothers where you
[01:34:58] could do for 64 instead of

[03:14:42] ch chunk of money orally for a while
[03:14:45] there that was a good chunk of money for
[03:14:47] a while there unless that thing
[03:14:50] dropped nice Mythic pit unless it should
[03:14:54] like I the only thing Wilds did drop a
[03:14:56] little bit the cards are great but the
[03:14:58] Wilds dropped a little bit so that's a
[03:15:00] four there but I think we had a
[03:15:03] five oh there was a four here four I
[03:15:06] thought I saw a
[03:15:08] five maybe it was just the four with the
[03:15:10] two things
[03:15:13] no it was a four that's what I was
[03:15:15] thinking all right so you have a bunch
[03:15:17] of fours on wild zeld drain plus an
[03:15:19] asinine Antics that's
[03:15:22] just oh it
[03:15:24] dropped that used to be a good chunk

[03:15:38] card and we're going to
[03:15:40] go there's your art card there we're
[03:15:42] going to go one two three four I think
[03:15:45] it is five in the
[03:15:47] back for getting all the spoilers out of
[03:15:50] the front
[03:15:53] there yeah that's okay I play for the
[03:15:55] game most of the time too and that's a
[03:15:57] good card to have dragon welp oh I like
[03:16:01] the little dragon
[03:16:03] welp bovian

[03:16:30] and I guess I was wrong and they didn't
[03:16:32] move him around so we have a land then
[03:16:35] we're gonna have a destroy evil haunting
[03:16:38] figment figment citizens arrest and a
[03:16:42] Voli tide Runner and we're going to find
[03:16:45] the high card here I believe was like a
[03:16:50] three I don't even think it was that
[03:16:51] much oh that's the five five is the
[03:16:57] high all right five it
[03:17:00] is cruelty of
[03:17:04] gicks and then here we
[03:17:06] go with our
[03:17:10] brothers with our brothers we still got
[03:17:13] this
[03:17:16] one nice art and I think these ones are

[03:18:23] ashnod all right let's see if you have
[03:18:29] five
[03:18:33] four oh it is a five which was the win
[03:18:37] with the Suns boock that doesn't happen
[03:18:39] very I have to double check that because
[03:18:41] Brothers War always has high ones
[03:18:44] four
[03:18:49] four couldn't
[03:18:56] stay oh it was all right looks like five
[03:19:00] with cruelty of gicks is the win here so
[03:19:04] you get a f h poll from the Suns
[03:19:10] box br
[03:19:17] all right anywhere all right anywhere
[03:19:20] we're gonna go we're gonna go with this
[03:19:24] one here gonna go with this one here
[03:19:27] chunky gonna flip this baby over and you
[03:19:29] got a season of growth to add to your
[03:19:32] cards there thank you chunky coming in
[03:19:35] on that one that was fun we like we love
[03:19:37] playing we love playing the game we love
[03:19:41] playing the game
[03:19:43] here go down
[03:19:49] chunky see you always get the three
[03:19:51] packs and you could potentially get
[03:19:54] yourself something fun and extra and
[03:19:56] that's why I like doing the games the
[03:19:57] way that I do it it's like it's like a
[03:19:59] little extra something it's not a little
[03:20:01] like this is how the game is so that's
[03:20:04] why I try to do stuff where you can get
[03:20:05] a little extra hook you guys up the best
[03:20:07] I
[03:20:08] can it's all right I'm gonna still give
[03:20:10] you this one here in the sleeve
[03:20:13] chunky
[03:20:17] L you
[03:20:20] be
[03:20:22] love we'll do that again that was
[03:20:26] fun that was fun let's do that
[03:20:33] again we'll do that one again that was
[03:20:36] pretty fun hold money don't
[03:20:40] need back
[03:20:43] I don't
[03:20:48] need that I can ask
[03:20:54] for we'll be here for about a half hour
[03:20:57] longer and then I gotta head out for the
[03:20:58] day to do some other
[03:21:03] stuff correct which everyone has the
[03:21:06] highest Mona value card is the um Dart
[03:21:11] is the dart that hits its Target so
[03:21:15] whenever you open the pack where you go
[03:21:17] through
[03:21:18] them hey thank you chunky I appreciate
[03:21:20] it so yeah so whichever one has the
[03:21:23] highest mono value card I don't do I
[03:21:26] like the thing I get I haven't done
[03:21:28] monetary value just because monetary
[03:21:31] value is it's hard to say and it jumps
[03:21:33] around so much um so I do highest mono
[03:21:36] value because every single time it's
[03:21:38] always going to be the highest mono
[03:21:39] value in a pack and it's whichever one
[03:21:41] hits his Target is the one that um
[03:21:45] whichever one has the highest mono value
[03:21:46] is the one that hits his Target and let
[03:21:47] me run this oops that was supposed to be
[03:21:49] for 15 but I'll run it for 15 if
[03:21:51] somebody wants to try their luckier
[03:21:53] Darko after but you always get three
[03:21:56] packs and it's just whether or not you
[03:21:59] um are lucky enough to get yourself
[03:22:02] maybe you can get yourself like an extra
[03:22:04] pack maybe it's just like a card or
[03:22:07] maybe it's a card you might want to play
[03:22:09] you know that's kind of how it goes here
[03:22:14] yeah she is some kind of wonderful oh
[03:22:18] yeah yeah yeah I run this for 15 in a
[03:22:20] second here for those that want to try
[03:22:23] their luck at it because that was fun we
[03:22:25] like playing that I don't mind doing a
[03:22:27] little bit of a deal on it every now and
[03:22:29] again when I
[03:22:30] [Music]
[03:22:35] can and we'll do that and then
[03:22:38] afterwards I will do a pull box deal
[03:22:40] here for one of my my regular pole boxes
[03:22:44] I'll do a deal on the Exelon instead of
[03:22:47] $6 for nine poles I'll throw it on $ n i
[03:22:52] mean um nine poles
[03:22:55] for5 I think that's pretty good deal
[03:22:58] there hunt yourself down the graos or
[03:23:01] maybe the galta is what you're looking
[03:23:03] for that would be
[03:23:08] nice yeah yeah yeah or maybe you want to
[03:23:11] go and look in our Lord of the Rings
[03:23:16] box oh try yourself for the one
[03:23:20] ring but here we go I'm gonna pull this
[03:23:23] out here we're G to set this back since
[03:23:25] no one jumped on that right then and
[03:23:28] we're going to put that back here and
[03:23:30] put these away they always stay here
[03:23:33] visible so that everybody always sees
[03:23:35] where they are they never move around
[03:23:38] but if you want to try your luck we have
[03:23:40] a Lord of the Rings box right here and
[03:23:43] I'm going to do the Exelon one right now
[03:23:46] though let's do the Exelon one right now
[03:23:51] though nine PS from

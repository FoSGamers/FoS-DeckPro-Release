  - All Surprise Products must be opened and shown during the live show.
  - All Surprise Products must be visible and kept on screen during the show.

[2025-03-12 09:37:16] FoSGamers:
Are these done as auctions? Because it doesn't have an ability for me to put a price on anything.

[2025-03-12 09:37:23] ChatGPT:
Yes, Whatnot's "Surprise Sets" are typically sold through auctions. Sellers create a collection of items, and each item within the Surprise Set is auctioned individually. Buyers bid on these items without knowing exactly which specific product they'll receive until after the auction concludes. citeturn0search0

**Setting Up Surprise Sets**

To set up a Surprise Set for auction:

1. **Create a New Show**:
   - Schedule a new live show and select the "Surprise Sets" format.

2. **Add a Surprise Set**:
   - Within your live show setup, click the "Add" button in your Live Shop.
   - Choose "Create a Surprise Set."

3. **Configure Settings**:

     - **Quick Spin**: Provides a faster randomization animation.

4. **Manage Products**:
   - Enter details for each product in the set, including name, description, and quantity.

5. **Create the Surprise Set**:
   - Finalize and create your Surprise Set.

6. **Run the Surprise Set During the Live Show**:
   - Start the auction and pin/run each item.
   - If "Auto-Randomize" is enabled, products are assigned automatically after each sale. Otherwise, you can randomize manually.

**Pricing in Surprise Sets**

In the Surprise Set format, each item is auctioned, and buyers place bids to win individual items. The final price is determined by the highest bid at the end of each auction. This auction-based approach aligns with Whatnot's guidelines for Surprise Sets. citeturn0search0

**Alternative Fixed-Price Options**

If you prefer to sell items at a fixed price rather than through auctions, you can use the "Buy It Now" option when listing products. This allows buyers to purchase items immediately at the set price without participating in an auction. citeturn0search3

**Compliance with Whatnot Policies**

Ensure that all Surprise Sets comply with Whatnot's Surprise Products Policy, which includes guidelines on product visibility, detailed checklists, and restrictions on certain randomization methods. citeturn0search2

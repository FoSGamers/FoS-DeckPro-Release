[00:04:38] it just showed me was almost a month ago
[00:04:41] me doing one of these
[00:04:44] shows wow that's pretty rough been a
[00:04:48] while well I will have to say I did have
[00:04:50] some bad luck though you know my
[00:04:53] uh shattered my finger there then on the
[00:04:57] way over the reason why it took so long
[00:04:59] we had bad fuel if anybody watches and
[00:05:01] checks us out and does any of our
[00:05:04] things there you go buyer giveaways in
[00:05:06] there all
[00:05:11] right all righty here we go everybody
[00:05:15] which one should we open let me know
[00:05:18] which one do you think we should open
[00:05:19] should we open inrad remastered or ather
[00:05:21] drift now all those are in the buy now
[00:05:23] for those of you that want to try and uh
[00:05:25] jump in on those you can always do that
[00:05:31] and let me see here
[00:05:35] think I should be able
[00:05:37] to do something like this
[00:05:41] no give me a second n some
[00:05:47] reason I'm going a little wonky
[00:05:54] here I think my phone's acting
[00:05:57] up all right let's do this close some
[00:06:02] things go here go here
[00:06:07] ah there we
[00:06:14] go there we are I like it let's wipe up
[00:06:17] so I can see no I want the
[00:06:23] chat there we go there we go now I can
[00:06:27] see the chat better
[00:06:31] there got our chaos brakes
[00:06:38] running yeah so I could have tried to
[00:06:42] but we were having such like quite
[00:06:44] frankly we got bad fuel um the trip took
[00:06:47] uh
[00:06:48] about 4 to 5 days longer than it should
[00:06:51] have because of getting bad fuel are
[00:06:54] actually on my Motors stopped working
[00:06:56] mid in the middle of the night when we
[00:06:58] were sailing uh we were doing some motor
[00:07:00] sailing to try to get quicker to here uh
[00:07:03] start working in the middle of the night
[00:07:04] so I ended up having to go to the
[00:07:06] Dominican Republic to pump out four
[00:07:08] gallons of water that was in the fuel
[00:07:09] which is why I stopped working and then
[00:07:11] I had to go afterwards we tried to go
[00:07:13] right to direct to the Bahamas again
[00:07:15] that way it was going to be a quick
[00:07:16] thing a few days I was going to be gone
[00:07:18] and then uh yep that didn't work either
[00:07:20] because um the motor still started
[00:07:24] puttering out due the probably bad fuel
[00:07:27] and we ended up going and pumping out
[00:07:28] the fuel diesel in then sailed and motor
[00:07:32] sailed back to the Bahamas which just
[00:07:34] took a little longer because the
[00:07:35] direction we were going now so that's
[00:07:37] why it took like four days longer I
[00:07:38] would have had an answer for you guys or
[00:07:40] I would have been given an update that
[00:07:41] type of thing but know I just had some
[00:07:44] had some bad luck is really what it
[00:07:45] boiled down to I had some bad luck let
[00:07:49] me see if I move this over here
[00:07:53] better
[00:07:56] no do it like this
[00:08:00] that's what I'm trying to do there so I
[00:08:02] can see everything on screen and who's
[00:08:05] talking so we're going to try this now
[00:08:08] let me see if it'll do this giveaways
[00:08:12] let's
[00:08:14] add one of the
[00:08:19] giveaways let's run it we're going to
[00:08:21] open up a pack which one should we do
[00:08:24] chat YouTube
[00:08:26] chat twitch chat X chat
[00:08:30] whatnot chat hey how's every ather all
[00:08:32] right Aether it is and we have this
[00:08:35] today we'll be doing some fun stuff with
[00:08:36] but today we have our break there pinned
[00:08:38] if you want to jump in on that that's a
[00:08:39] fun one but we will be opening some
[00:08:41] packs here now
[00:08:45] anyways here are my wonderful
[00:08:50] scissors so I know what is going on at
[00:08:52] all
[00:08:55] times nice protects this protects the
[00:08:58] reason why we use scissors is because it
[00:09:00] helps protect the packs uh I mean the
[00:09:02] cards so you know you're not denting
[00:09:04] them or bending them or anything like
[00:09:05] that and also with it helping protect
[00:09:08] the cards you
[00:09:11] uh it doesn't cause many as many uh
[00:09:14] problems for shipping cuz you get to use
[00:09:17] them for shipping look at that I get to
[00:09:19] help with shipping with
[00:09:21] it but we're pretty much back to normal
[00:09:23] here how you doing
[00:09:27] Nico yes I did a pack drop I dropped
[00:09:30] stuff off that YouTube video that I did
[00:09:31] was dropping everything off at the uh
[00:09:33] post
[00:09:37] office were there some issues because uh
[00:09:39] there's another person that made a
[00:09:40] comment that they didn't get something
[00:09:42] so if they didn't if you have any issues
[00:09:44] with that I literally made that YouTube
[00:09:45] video dropping it
[00:09:47] off so what side should I do first the

[00:10:15] cuz I know I've had actually a few
[00:10:16] packages returned to my PO Box saying

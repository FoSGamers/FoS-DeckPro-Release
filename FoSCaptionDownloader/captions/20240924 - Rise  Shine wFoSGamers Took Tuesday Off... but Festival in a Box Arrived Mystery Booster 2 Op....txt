[00:14:47] too nice changing whenever you cast an
[00:14:50] instant sorcery spell targets one or
[00:14:52] more permanence you control create a
[00:14:53] token that's copy of one of more permits
[00:14:55] o win sell ability on and a permanent
[00:15:00] con and opponent controls cause you to
[00:15:02] discard a card create a token that's oh
[00:15:04] I'm going to be using that in a deck oh

[00:18:28] too far in there we go Ram through let's
[00:18:31] get some good luck deranged assistant
[00:18:34] thriving more staunch Throne guard
[00:18:38] Bastion of remembrance not bad there
[00:18:41] skeleton reassembling skeleton I think I
[00:18:44] can use that in my deck I might be using

[00:18:50] on that one you see that all over that
[00:18:52] misprints missing
[00:18:53] color I'm I'm going to put that off to

[00:18:57] all over that one missing color
[00:19:00] pad the Exile back to the same back to
[00:19:02] the same price as the rest of them I
[00:19:05] know pad the Exile oh All That Glitters
[00:19:08] I love the borderless of those taoa
[00:19:12] benic Druid all right for the first
[00:19:15] borderless not bad MX of is
[00:19:20] Magnus
[00:19:22] nice
[00:19:24] sakiko mother of Summer oh I'll take

[02:27:47] kind
[02:27:52] you well that really stinks I think I
[02:27:56] made a giant mistake
[02:28:01] earlier I did well that's okay you guys
[02:28:05] ever everybody that's been getting
[02:28:06] giveaways you actually instead of the
[02:28:08] singles you have been getting um packs
[02:28:11] that you can uh buy discounts on so
[02:28:13] there you
[02:28:14] go that was supposed to go out of his
[02:28:16] pack there wasn't been I messed up a big
[02:28:19] mess up today that
[02:28:21] sucks why didn't that [ __ ] change oh
[02:28:24] my God that's annoying as all hell I had
[02:28:27] it set for singles for people for
[02:28:30] giveaways and for some reason it started
[02:28:32] doing as all
[02:28:34] packs so uh I got charged a lot more for
[02:28:37] shipping than I was
[02:28:41] expecting come on Roll scroll that I can
[02:28:44] want now
[02:28:48] weaker so I'll have to talk to whatnot
[02:28:50] though and I'll say something whatnot
[02:28:51] but guys hey can you correct this for me
[02:28:53] and hopefully it'll straighten that out
[02:28:55] because that generally doesn't happen
[02:28:56] I've never had that happen before what
[02:28:57] does that ah don't worry about it I'll
[02:28:59] talk to whatnot I'll straighten it out
[02:29:01] generally they're pretty good with that
[02:29:02] stuff because that was definitely not me
[02:29:04] doing it that was a glitch of some kind
[02:29:06] because I had it set to singles at the
[02:29:07] start of the day all right so our
[02:29:09] giveaway will be one of these because we
[02:29:11] have our friend coming in with a raid
[02:29:13] one of these four packs say thank you ah
[02:29:17] don't worry about it I'll get it
[02:29:19] straightened out that means uh
[02:29:24] just yeah I'm not going to I'm not going
[02:29:26] to I'll contact them right away after
[02:29:28] this and send them message thank you
[02:29:29] Robert I appreciate that I don't know
[02:29:31] why I had them all set at Singles but
[02:29:33] some some reason they changed to a to
[02:29:35] packs being sent out for the last like
[02:29:37] 15 of them when they were only supposed
[02:29:39] to be the singles being sent out so I'm
[02:29:41] really confused on why that even
[02:29:43] happened because I had set it all as
[02:29:45] singles when I started the show this
[02:29:47] morning so it's just really weird really
[02:29:50] really
[02:29:51] weird I appreciate that though Robert
[02:29:53] for the uh for the guidance
[02:29:55] there this I'm I'm actually thoroughly
[02:29:57] confused on that but whatever [ __ ]

[02:47:40] so do let me know if you want them and
[02:47:43] we can uh we can maybe get some for you
[02:47:51] there you go exactly so like I was
[02:47:53] saying uh kid Kelly I think there's some
[02:47:55] people that want some so that's why I
[02:47:57] saying you may want
[02:47:59] them well uh we do though that's why I
[02:48:01] was saying if you can come over on
[02:48:03] whatnot we can get those running here um
[02:48:05] the reason why you can't do it with the
[02:48:06] YouTube is I do it free and you have to
[02:48:09] put your information in for like your
[02:48:10] address and it literally sends it to you
[02:48:11] free I don't need to do anything like
[02:48:12] that skills Mills um but I do plan on
[02:48:15] doing YouTube ones once we hit our
[02:48:17] certain level we have a few cple a
[02:48:20] little bit uh probably I'm guessing next
[02:48:21] week or the week after we'll be able to
[02:48:23] hit our our next level where we'll be
[02:48:25] able to do some things in YouTube and
[02:48:27] then I'll be able to do some giveaway
[02:48:28] things so I'll be able to have your
[02:48:29] information in there to be able to do
[02:48:30] those giveaways because right now
[02:48:32] there's no way for me to gather that
[02:48:34] other than um the way we're doing
[02:48:37] it but those are there and then
[02:48:39] afterwards we're going to do another
[02:48:41] only obligatory mer not next we'll do
[02:48:44] another one of our um our other

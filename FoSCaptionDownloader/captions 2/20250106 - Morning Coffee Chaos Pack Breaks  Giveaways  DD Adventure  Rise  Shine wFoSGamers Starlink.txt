[00:07:01] already talked you about these
[00:07:02] competition things whenever you start a
[00:07:04] competition there's always going to be a
[00:07:06] loser but if you work together to get
[00:07:08] something better you can both you can
[00:07:09] both work together and make something
[00:07:10] work more efficiently or even better
[00:07:13] instead of competing and having one
[00:07:14] person a loser and some person may be
[00:07:15] getting something I didn't know I'm not
[00:07:17] saying you I'm talking to
[00:07:20] him right yeah it's kind of it's kind of
[00:07:22] pointless when you can always when you
[00:07:24] can do it better you should cheer

[00:07:27] yeah you shouldn't be complaining right
[00:07:30] nice one I like the reading good job on

[00:07:40] be a dad for a minute
[00:07:43] there all righty let's uh let's see
[00:08:00] oh de dang it ah well we'll have to um
[00:08:04] I'm going to have to work
[00:08:07] on we'll see about uh turning on I
[00:08:10] wonder if I can adjust the plan and turn
[00:08:11] it on for when I need it and then turn
[00:08:13] it off
[00:08:14] after H I'm going to have to look into
[00:08:16] that for um SpaceX and uh and uh and um
[00:08:21] our stuff here with starlink I wonder if
[00:08:23] I can turn it on so when I'm using it
[00:08:24] here I have the priority stuff to use it
[00:08:26] with like the more expensive plan and
[00:08:27] then I can turn it off after just go to
[00:08:29] the cheaper plan like go back down
[00:08:32] wonder if that's possible so I can use
[00:08:33] it only when needed and then use the
[00:08:34] others non priority when I don't need it
[00:08:37] kind of thing I don't know but there
[00:08:39] that was an actually really good pack
[00:08:41] right there from uh from Nolan picking
[00:08:45] earlier all right so there's Will's
[00:08:49] awesome picks from that wow making me
[00:08:52] feel like a I don't know what I do
[00:08:54] anymore I can't do anything like that
[00:08:56] that was an awesome hit all right and
[00:08:58] then we have this is this is another
[00:08:59] break that I'm going to get out here
[00:09:00] after we finish our other we have Wilds
[00:09:02] Commander Masters mystery booster one
[00:09:05] horizon Wilds of all drains we have a
[00:09:07] jump start and lost Caverns I was going
[00:09:08] to get that together to put in if
[00:09:10] anybody would like those we do have our
[00:09:13] brakes
[00:09:15] pinned if anybody wants them it looks
[00:09:18] like we have one two three four do we
[00:09:22] have them all filled and it's just not
[00:09:23] showing me that they filled well son of
[00:09:25] a b it did not show me in the update
[00:09:27] that the doubling season one filled
[00:09:30] well look at that let's get the doubling
[00:09:32] season out for
[00:09:34] you let me find where I put that one
[00:09:36] over
[00:09:40] here where is
[00:09:47] it all just got to grab that out from my
[00:09:50] uh stash
[00:09:53] cart I had it over here a minute ago and
[00:09:56] then I moved it that's what happens when
[00:09:59] you have stuff all
[00:10:02] over closer um no not that
[00:10:07] area damn it I got to get better at
[00:10:09] organizing my
[00:10:13] stuff hey boys yes yeah um if you want
[00:10:16] to go play around and be ridiculous like
[00:10:18] that I don't mind you doing that but not
[00:10:20] today now on the couch where you're
[00:10:22] ruining something oh all
[00:10:24] right if we have to talk about this
[00:10:26] again we're going to have a big problem
[00:10:27] this is now the second time I've had to
[00:10:29] turn around or third time if had to turn
[00:10:30] around that means you are showing zero
[00:10:32] respect to me at all yes sir yes
[00:10:49] sir okay sorry going to get these away
[00:10:52] trying to find where that
[00:10:54] is because I know I put it over here I
[00:10:56] just don't know exactly where
[00:11:00] there it is in one of those boxes I
[00:11:02] looked in the second one did not need it

[00:11:11] one zero gamer Miss Nico on spot two
[00:11:14] three wraith on spot four Miss Nico and
[00:11:17] then wraith on spot five so that is the

[00:12:16] things running and it was one a couple
[00:12:17] things too much in the background all
[00:12:18] right here we go we're going to shuffle
[00:12:19] them up as you can see one 2 3 4 5 six
[00:12:23] one card says single why is that one not
[00:12:25] in a
[00:12:27] sleeve the one that says single is the

[00:25:27] over here I mean they know exactly what
[00:25:28] they they're doing I'm not worried about
[00:25:33] it why is this not working
[00:25:41] right I'm getting rocked around and
[00:25:43] that's what's causing
[00:25:48] problems back behind us no they're bad
[00:25:51] they got a back all the way down to the
[00:25:53] slip over there I am getting pick zero

[00:26:34] Nolan so we got
[00:26:37] there let's put them back over
[00:26:40] here let's see what happens with that
[00:26:45] all
[00:26:46] right now I did start breake but it
[00:26:49] didn't
[00:26:53] unpin all right we're going to pin this
[00:26:55] one why is it not letting me pin it

[00:27:48] got there's a boat going by and they
[00:27:50] rocked us a bit so I was waiting for
[00:27:53] that yeah I think I think I'm going to
[00:27:55] have to figure out I think it's the I
[00:27:57] actually think might be a lot more the
[00:27:59] alignment of stuff because that's tilted
[00:28:01] and we don't have like we have the
[00:28:03] mountains and the other boats going by

[00:34:41] now I know I have a lot of foil lands
[00:34:44] that are like that so we're going to
[00:34:46] have to every time I think it's the
[00:34:48] boat's moving a little bit more nice job
[00:34:50] bud congratulations finished
[00:34:52] congratulations good
[00:34:54] job only way do to S up your line have
[00:34:58] no mov yeah but I don't know if that's
[00:35:00] fully it though does seem like it may be
[00:35:02] but I'm not
[00:35:05] sure I'm not
[00:35:08] sure it's like it's freezing though and
[00:35:11] I don't think it's that I think it what
[00:35:13] could be the reason be hey all
[00:35:15] right shooting cuz I'm dropping down to
[00:35:18] zero and I don't understand that one
[00:35:19] that one doesn't make sense to
[00:35:24] me latency is fine device
[00:35:55] is okay
[00:36:01] H what do we have at our Amazon devices
[00:36:04] by the way Amazon devices
[00:36:08] yeah Kindles Kindles but they're not
[00:36:11] hooked up their they are
[00:36:14] connected I just paused them they can't
[00:36:16] work I wonder if they were trying to
[00:36:17] automatically download stuff you can um
[00:36:19] it doesn't matter mom I figured it out I
[00:36:21] figured it out I paused them on here
[00:36:23] they can't be used anymore I paused
[00:36:24] their internet connection it's fine your
[00:36:26] books will still work are downloaded the
[00:36:28] books will work yes they will so I think
[00:36:31] that's what's going that might have been
[00:36:32] what's going
[00:36:35] on
[00:36:41] you
[00:36:44] open I know we'll see if that helps at
[00:36:47] all I think that might help a little bit
[00:36:49] I think there was some things
[00:36:49] downloading stuff in the background
[00:36:52] that's uh anybody doing better now I
[00:36:55] think I might be doing better now
[00:36:57] yep so every time I think their Kindles
[00:36:59] have been on and they probably trying to
[00:37:01] down they downloading books is my
[00:37:05] guess we already downloaded all the book
[00:37:07] it doesn't matter buddy but when you
[00:37:09] click on it and it tries to download
[00:37:10] something automatically by because it's
[00:37:12] just meant to do that so I hopefully I
[00:37:15] think I figured it out weird we'll find
[00:37:17] out if it keeps working this way or if
[00:37:19] we have some issues but we'll find out
[00:37:21] here much better much good much good

[00:37:25] now all right here we go now we're going
[00:37:27] to open these up and we're going to see
[00:37:29] what we get trying to figure out what
[00:37:31] the issue was I'm like this does not
[00:37:32] seem

[00:37:38] mean I'm happy with them reading I'm

[00:50:29] put that mic off so you should be able
[00:50:30] to hear us
[00:50:32] now now with the camo mic it should be
[00:50:34] the one coming from me talking I think

[00:50:47] walk here all

[00:51:08] sunnier and warmer so that we can go to
[00:51:10] the beach or other stuff maybe take the
[00:51:11] boat out and go over and check something

[01:01:19] um maybe it's something else I don't
[01:01:22] know but we're not always sure what
[01:01:25] everything is
[01:01:31] so we'll hang out here we'll look at
[01:01:32] this stuff and then we'll get our break
[01:01:33] going in a little bit hopefully
[01:01:35] everything is working all right for you
[01:01:37] rather
[01:01:39] still hey have a good one
[01:01:41] spicy you head
[01:01:45] out sorry bud I hope you feel
[01:01:51] better hey hope you feel better today
[01:01:53] bud sorry about that not feeling so well
[01:01:56] I it happens sometimes get get sick
[01:01:59] catch a cold I was worried I was going
[01:02:00] to catch something from the plane like
[01:02:02] everyone around us was either coughing
[01:02:05] or sneezing and I'm like oh God please
[01:02:08] so we took our Yin Chow when we got back
[01:02:10] here to the boat make sure that we don't
[01:02:13] get
[01:02:14] sick you
[01:02:17] know well I don't know if any anybody's
[01:02:19] have gin child before yeah it's always
[01:02:21] the
[01:02:23] planes how many visits do you have to
[01:02:25] Steve left oh I'll have to go and look
[01:02:26] but I think it's like two maybe three uh
[01:02:29] it's not a ton you I think you only have
[01:02:31] a couple of them
[01:02:35] left if you want to go and
[01:02:40] visit we
[01:02:46] could thank you Nico yeah I don't have a
[01:02:48] I don't have it up right now the
[01:02:50] computer's inside there with everything
[01:02:52] else set up for the streaming that's why
[01:02:54] I was saying I need to figure out
[01:02:54] another ooh
[01:02:57] hold
[01:03:00] on I
[01:03:04] wonder if I can do screen share and see
[01:03:09] the
[01:03:10] screen of my
[01:03:17] computer all right let's see if we can
[01:03:19] see that no no no no
[01:03:24] [Music]
[01:03:31] cuz I feel like there is an option to do
[01:03:33] that
[01:03:35] somewhere and I do not remember what it
[01:03:37] was now it was like I could go over and
[01:03:41] use the other
[01:03:44] screen oh I think I have to set it up on
[01:03:46] the computer I don't want to set
[01:03:48] anything up on the computer and cause a
[01:03:50] problem right now next day tomorrow
[01:03:53] tomorrow we'll do that we'll do that
[01:03:55] tomorrow
[01:03:58] four vendor keys left ah there you go
[01:04:00] Luke yeah perfect you got four vendor
[01:04:02] keys left so we got seven spots left in
[01:04:05] our break here it's a big run today but
[01:04:06] we have some big hits here it's a whole
[01:04:08] there's a collector booster of uh of
[01:04:11] Commander Masters in there there is I
[01:04:13] believe a sa booster of can Mander
[01:04:15] Masters in that one that's the one that
[01:04:16] we have there and we are also going to
[01:04:17] be uh hopefully bumping out of the uh
[01:04:20] the where the the Vault here going up
[01:04:22] and seeing what else is going on you
[01:04:24] know I don't know where will we be
[01:04:27] where shall we be here yeah we're just
[01:04:29] going to float around now have some fun
[01:04:31] in the
[01:04:33] water hey Steve thank you I appreciate
[01:04:36] buddy yeah it happens sometimes I uh you
[01:04:39] know when you travel one I've I've been
[01:04:41] I grew up in New England where we used
[01:04:44] to you know we had snow not the same
[01:04:46] amount of like 40 centimeters on a
[01:04:48] regular basis but we had enough snow
[01:04:49] that we had to like get snow blow or
[01:04:50] plow or shovel regularly like all the
[01:04:53] wins literally the day before we moved
[01:04:55] the day the week we were moving down to
[01:04:56] Florida when we first moved it snowed
[01:04:58] every single day like 6 in I'm like you
[01:05:01] got to be kidding me so so I had to go
[01:05:04] on snow blow just to be able to get rid
[01:05:05] of the snow so we can actually pack up
[01:05:07] the trailer that we had there biggest
[01:05:10] headache ever on that one it was like
[01:05:11] you just waste an hour and a half every
[01:05:13] day doing that and then finally we got
[01:05:14] down here and then we see people are
[01:05:16] starting to get cold again in Florida it
[01:05:18] was like 28 degrees in miam supposedly
[01:05:20] that's insane like I don't know if any
[01:05:22] of you guys ever saw that that's like
[01:05:23] pretty crazy to me
[01:05:32] you going to visit sugar
[01:05:35] Steve all right let's do it if you guys
[01:05:37] want to visit sugar Steve you can do
[01:05:38] that I do believe all right so you
[01:05:42] guys decided to go visit sugar
[01:05:49] Steve oh exactly you bought a track you
[01:05:52] say exactly you bought a tra you know
[01:05:53] what you need to do so we can we're
[01:05:56] going to go visit sugar Steve let's go
[01:05:57] visit sugar Steve let's see I do believe
[01:05:59] I can do this nope this right
[01:06:03] here and you're going to go over to the
[01:06:05] storage vendor here and see about
[01:06:08] visiting sugar
[01:06:09] Steve now sugar Steve
[01:06:12] here comes up and you see with sugar
[01:06:15] Steve he goes hey buddy how you doing my
[01:06:16] friend I see you came
[01:06:18] in what are you looking for today my
[01:06:21] friend Luke it looks like Luke's coming
[01:06:23] in there
[01:06:26] anybody else going with Loop if not we
[01:06:28] can put sugar
[01:06:31] away and take it as a
[01:06:36] mistake yeah exactly see I didn't have a
[01:06:39] snow plow so I had to I had to use the
[01:06:42] snowblower and I was debating on getting
[01:06:44] one but I'm like if I'm get a plow and I
[01:06:45] put it on my Jeep there's no point like
[01:06:47] I'm leaving like I could have put it on
[01:06:48] the Gladiator and been done in 20
[01:06:50] minutes yeah so no about it's like one
[01:06:51] of those cuz we had like a 100 it was
[01:06:53] like about 100 ft was probably to the
[01:06:55] driveway from there from from the road
[01:06:57] to our thing so was a longer one for us
[01:06:58] to
[01:07:00] do all right
[01:07:03] Suge today
[01:07:06] Suge Suge has some stuff here goes you
[01:07:10] know what I actually have a decent
[01:07:11] amount of stuff today I have a strength
[01:07:13] booster for anyone if they'd like them
[01:07:16] we have an intelligence booster if we
[01:07:18] would like those we also have three
[01:07:21] engineering boosters all right and we
[01:07:26] have um some plasma
[01:07:29] ammo we have a flamethrower
[01:07:32] ammo I did make those I've been doing
[01:07:35] better with that I think I got them set
[01:07:36] up better the flamethrower
[01:07:37] ammo and we do also have pretty much an
[01:07:41] infinite supply of Health packs I talked
[01:07:43] to a friend of ours we got a bunch of
[01:07:44] those in here so as many of those plus
[01:07:45] 20 Health packs that you need anyone and
[01:07:47] then uh I think that's about it that I
[01:07:49] really have today not nothing major we
[01:07:50] do have some plasma no plasma rifle
[01:07:54] ammo and we have some other ammo for
[01:07:56] other weapons if you need them to for
[01:07:57] like those you know your other weapons
[01:07:59] that you got so let us know you want any
[01:08:01] of that stuff
[01:08:06] today and remember everybody going to
[01:08:08] jump in on the break there participate
[01:08:10] and we'll do our adventuring today we'll
[01:08:12] see what goes on because I know we have
[01:08:13] a lot of we have a a new new level we're
[01:08:15] going to where now we have left we're
[01:08:18] going to be leaving the
[01:08:22] Vault what's engineering engineering
[01:08:25] helps with with um special like uh
[01:08:27] specialized weapons um that are like
[01:08:29] more Tech type weapons you'll get a Plus
[01:08:31] on those and then also engineering will
[01:08:33] help when it comes to making something
[01:08:34] so say you want to do a MacGyver a bomb
[01:08:37] well there you go you need some you need
[01:08:38] some engineering we help with that say
[01:08:40] you want to uh try to open something
[01:08:42] special or find some that'll help with
[01:08:44] that thank you Nico I appreciate
[01:08:47] that so that'll be uh for the
[01:08:49] engineering and that that's 20 pogs for
[01:08:52] each one of those so you have to get
[01:08:53] your pogs out and drop them over here if
[01:08:54] you like
[01:09:00] what do you want my friend I keep
[01:09:02] pressing the wrong
[01:09:05] button Suge standing there going what
[01:09:08] are we looking
[01:09:14] for yeah pretty much New England saying
[01:09:16] goodbye that's correct
[01:09:18] Stephen that was New England like get
[01:09:20] the out of
[01:09:22] here then we moved to Florida we were
[01:09:25] there about four years and finally uh
[01:09:27] about a year ago we went on a sailing
[01:09:29] trip for a week on a cadam ran where I
[01:09:30] sailed that around with the captain and
[01:09:32] my wife was like actually this is not
[01:09:34] bad and liked it I was like I trying to
[01:09:37] tell you it's like a pretty much a
[01:09:38] floating house a floating condo is what
[01:09:40] we're
[01:09:41] on so we're trying to
[01:09:45] uh it's
[01:09:46] fan oh fans blowing the thing out so
[01:09:50] we're we're we're on this now on our
[01:09:51] boat we have a 40 foot catary we're on
[01:09:53] nice one not too bad we just hang out
[01:09:54] and we sail around different places
[01:09:56] right now in Puerto Rico though just
[01:09:57] trying to get some work done so we can
[01:09:59] be more set up better so like we can
[01:10:00] have um we're going to get solar
[01:10:03] batteries um bottom paint water maker
[01:10:06] stuff like that then we'll be able to
[01:10:07] like for the most part be set up and go
[01:10:09] anywhere we want on this boat without
[01:10:12] the need of anyone else for assistance
[01:10:13] or any power anywhere because the sun
[01:10:15] will give us what we need and we'll be
[01:10:17] able to run everything we need at night
[01:10:18] during the day there'll be no generators
[01:10:20] running for any of our stuff unless we
[01:10:22] need to like charge our batteries
[01:10:23] because there's zero Sun out and and
[01:10:25] it's been bad storms for a while but for
[01:10:27] the most part when it comes to that
[01:10:29] that's that that we only need to run
[01:10:31] them for a couple hours two two to four
[01:10:33] hours to charge everything up with that
[01:10:34] so I mean it's not bad well we have a
[01:10:36] good plan as long as we can get our
[01:10:37] stuff installed I seem to think we can
[01:10:39] do it this week coming here well this
[01:10:41] week now since it's
[01:10:45] Sunday I press the same button
[01:10:53] again engineering does not help with the
[01:10:55] Gat for the Gat that would be
[01:11:02] um what was the Gat one I
[01:11:07] think I think it was Intelligence that
[01:11:09] helped with the
[01:11:18] Gat yes we are getting one of those we
[01:11:20] have a we're going to begin getting
[01:11:21] water
[01:11:22] maker 20 oh engineering and health P 15
[01:11:25] for engineering and health P 15 for
[01:11:28] engineering and health P now the he
[01:11:31] Health P now engineering yeah so
[01:11:34] engineering will help with like the the
[01:11:36] um we'll say the alien Gatling gun
[01:11:38] that's intelligence in engineering you
[01:11:40] will have with the
[01:11:43] um smelled something nice there and then
[01:11:46] um the alien Gatling gun then it will be
[01:11:49] the
[01:11:51] um what was it there was one other
[01:11:54] weapon flamethrower I think engineering
[01:11:56] helps um well I forgot about that that
[01:11:59] was the only one that it helps with
[01:12:00] flamethrower and Gatling gun I think
[01:12:02] there was one other but I don't know it
[01:12:03] was the Gat not the Gatling gun
[01:12:05] flamethrower and um alien Gatling gun
[01:12:08] trying to think of what the other one
[01:12:09] was I feel like there was one more I
[01:12:12] think it might have been the um sniper
[01:12:14] rifle that helps
[01:12:20] with taking intelligence all right and
[01:12:23] um you can put that stuff want to put
[01:12:24] that in somewhere that way forgetting
[01:12:28] remembering that'll help too I
[01:12:29] appreciate that a lot all right here we
[01:12:32] go we got some other stuff in here hey
[01:12:34] Malibu Tero how's it going my friend we
[01:12:36] got our uh our stuff going here let me
[01:12:38] know if you guys want anything jump in
[01:12:39] on something we do have our um break
[01:12:42] there set up we have spots we'll do some
[01:12:43] of our adventuring with that we're at
[01:12:45] Sugar Steve right now sugar Steve and
[01:12:48] you're going to get some uh Health p
[01:12:50] goes all right we can get you health
[01:12:51] packs and you want an intelligence
[01:12:53] booster we'll give you that intelligence
[01:12:54] booster there you go so Suge says all
[01:12:58] right you got those you want anything
[01:13:00] else was
[01:13:02] it let see did he need anything
[01:13:07] else we'll find out take Health back and
[01:13:10] use it all right Luke Luke's going to
[01:13:12] use that health pack right away I like
[01:13:14] it yeah so we're hanging out here if you
[01:13:16] guys ever want to come uh come chat with
[01:13:18] us we're um we're all over just hanging
[01:13:22] out with you guys you know I can put
[01:13:24] that up like this too

[01:13:32] there aha that's
[01:13:37] better here we
[01:13:39] go all right yeah so we got our our

[01:13:56] if I remember right you know what I'm
[01:13:57] going to have to do actually I'll um
[01:13:59] I'll make the list I'll make the thing
[01:14:01] available to everybody certain like for
[01:14:03] available to be seen for um um anyone
[01:14:06] that way you can look at the uh
[01:14:08] Adventure stuff that we have whenever
[01:14:10] you'd like but you can't the only person
[01:14:12] right now Nico can um can do some
[01:14:14] updating on
[01:14:17] that all right well we're going to hang
[01:14:19] out here for a little while hopefully we
[01:14:21] can get this break completed we did one
[01:14:23] djen break earlier which was pretty nice
[01:14:25] maybe we um should we get another dgen
[01:14:27] break
[01:14:28] going instead of um the regular packs
[01:14:31] ones we can do that again and do that as
[01:14:33] the
[01:14:43] adventure oh not a problem buddy not a

[01:19:46] ours sugar Steve uh the vendor there we
[01:19:49] got some items think we got a an
[01:19:52] engineering maybe and an intelligence
[01:19:54] booster definitely got some health packs
[01:19:57] but we don't know what's going on any
[01:20:01] further hang out kind just hanging out
[01:20:03] here chatting a bit watching the
[01:20:04] watching the good
[01:20:08] times good morning good
[01:20:12] morning I know I am in Puerto Rico right
[01:20:15] now
[01:20:18] ecook surveill land oh I don't
[01:20:22] have I don't think I have surveil

[01:32:15] Thomas
[01:32:16] coffee um coffee from St Thomas here so
[01:32:19] we kind of got get new coffees every
[01:32:20] time from different locations that we're
[01:32:22] at see how they are you know different
[01:32:24] whatever you know whatever their special
[01:32:26] blends of coffee are and eventually I'll
[01:32:29] end up prob finding the one that I like
[01:32:31] the most but I kind of find something
[01:32:32] that doesn't give me a ton of heartburn
[01:32:33] so I do get heartburn a lot with
[01:32:37] it but we have six spots left if anybody
[01:32:40] wants to jump
[01:32:41] in exactly test driving some special
[01:32:43] Brews to T Test Drive different ones all
[01:32:45] the time see what you can find see which
[01:32:48] one's
[01:32:51] good now all you in that uh
[01:32:54] NE I know see that's what I was thinking
[01:32:56] too I talked to my wife about doing cold
[01:32:59] brew myself and I'm like we if we do
[01:33:01] that like that I've been hearing
[01:33:03] everybody tell me that I'll my I'll be
[01:33:05] better with heartburn and everything
[01:33:06] else so it's like one of
[01:33:08] those we uh we might as well try it type
[01:33:11] things you
[01:33:15] know but yeah we're hanging out here
[01:33:17] just give yourself a nice little view
[01:33:19] everything going on in the background
[01:33:21] guys want to chill with us we open some
[01:33:23] packs
[01:33:25] yes correct I know that that's what I'm
[01:33:27] trying to say like I've been saying
[01:33:28] about it like and we just we just we
[01:33:30] have stuff at home to get it working to
[01:33:32] do that with but we just don't have
[01:33:33] everything here because you know we
[01:33:34] moved to a boat we just don't have
[01:33:36] everything I prefer cold coffee anyways
[01:33:40] um so I'm going to have to figure out if
[01:33:41] we can do it easily here if anybody has
[01:33:43] any tricks to do it easily here with
[01:33:46] like a like a small amount because like
[01:33:47] we had like a cold brw container or some
[01:33:50] crap like that she we had that she got I
[01:33:52] wonder if there is like a way that we
[01:33:53] can do it ourselves do we just put it in
[01:33:55] like
[01:33:56] a um like you know wrap it in um a
[01:33:59] filter and then drop it in
[01:34:03] water you know what we are going to be
[01:34:06] up there at one point I can't I don't
[01:34:07] know if I can stream it here to show it
[01:34:08] but we'll have it on uh we'll have it on
[01:34:10] bigger boat Adventures you'll be able to
[01:34:11] go and see it the view so if you guys
[01:34:13] check us out bigger boat Adventures
[01:34:15] we're we do that on YouTube my wife's
[01:34:17] been getting our first video together
[01:34:19] she wants to do that um we have some
[01:34:21] shorts out there if you'd like to check
[01:34:23] those out we're actually on Instagram
[01:34:25] and X also so if you check us out there
[01:34:27] um X we've been putting some fun things
[01:34:29] on there so just starting to get it
[01:34:30] going on that one too so I think I know
[01:34:32] pretty
[01:34:34] good jallon G jug and coffee grounds you
[01:34:37] know what we have a jallon jug a jallon
[01:34:39] gug a gallon jug oh my God we have a
[01:34:44] gallon jug and uh we have coffee grounds
[01:34:47] so we're going to have to figure out how
[01:34:48] to do this I mean we're hanging out on a
[01:34:49] boat here might as well I think it's a
[01:34:51] spa maybe it's a space factor I wonder
[01:34:53] if we can leave it sitting on the no we
[01:34:56] we'll figure it out it's like going to
[01:34:56] be in there for like 48 hours right
[01:34:58] something like
[01:35:01] that hey there you click that thanks for
[01:35:04] coming in and hanging out my
[01:35:05] friend I think it's something along that
[01:35:07] lines like 48
[01:35:10] Hours how's everybody doing in that
[01:35:12] YouTube land in that twitch land I was
[01:35:14] trying to get up um restream to show
[01:35:17] everything here but for whatever reason
[01:35:19] it's being a pain in the butt for me and
[01:35:21] it doesn't want to do it
[01:35:34] anything
[01:35:38] there
[01:35:42] no nothing for
[01:35:45] that trying to make it so I could see
[01:35:47] all the chats everywhere because right
[01:35:49] now it's not allowing me to see them all
[01:35:50] I have to like bump between things
[01:35:53] all right so we'll put it at room temp
[01:35:55] and just set it on the table then and
[01:35:56] have it
[01:35:58] Brew because it shouldn't really I mean
[01:36:00] if it's sitting there and it's been
[01:36:01] filtered water and clean water I think
[01:36:03] it should be fine right
[01:36:36] you guys like the brute view
[01:36:38] there inste a filter dump the grounds in
[01:36:41] a jug and filter after oh all right
[01:36:47] Nico what to grab one of the gallon
[01:36:50] things in
[01:36:57] yeah that if you can do that that would
[01:36:59] be perfect you can just filter right
[01:37:00] after and pour it through one of the
[01:37:02] filters or like just to get the grounds
[01:37:04] out through a coffee filter and let it
[01:37:05] drip through it type thing or is it just
[01:37:07] um just any type of like strainer to get
[01:37:09] rid of this
[01:37:11] stuff my guess is you're meaning like
[01:37:13] any type of strain oh you can might not
[01:37:15] be able to hear much the guy's uh moving
[01:37:16] over here in the background turning
[01:37:18] around into the uh in their carts
[01:37:29] yeah okay cool you know maybe we'll try
[01:37:31] that I'll grab I'll just get like
[01:37:32] literally a gallon of water we'll buy a
[01:37:34] gallon of fresh water I'll pour in ice I
[01:37:37] mean I pour in coffee grounds that we
[01:37:39] have left over from like the last batch
[01:37:41] of
[01:37:42] coffee and see what
[01:37:44] happens cuz I need to get some of that
[01:37:47] need to get rid of something I got I get
[01:37:48] Harper in there I can't have Harper all
[01:37:50] the
[01:37:51] time and I think having like you said
[01:37:54] that would be nicer oh I'm not in view
[01:37:56] anymore here we are back in view here ah
[01:37:58] I moved over for a minute
[01:38:03] there but we got looks like six spots
[01:38:06] left in our break
[01:38:08] here if you guys want to come in and

[01:40:51] what I'm going to come out here and do
[01:40:53] will you guys I can't have that camera
[01:40:55] though I'll have to change the camera to
[01:40:56] be a different I wonder if I can put it
[01:40:57] on my uh tablet here but then I wouldn't
[01:41:00] be able to see the
[01:41:04] chat I to figure something out
[01:41:07] here I know we we'll have to do some
[01:41:10] thinking
[01:41:11] later try to figure out a way that I can
[01:41:13] have it more running from here rather
[01:41:15] than just seeing the
[01:41:18] chat spot you buy is the spot you get
[01:41:20] number wise yes so whoever bought spot
[01:41:22] number one I sh pretty much what I do is
[01:41:24] like I take all the all the uh rares
[01:41:29] Commons that are and uncommons that are
[01:41:31] over $3 and any Mythic I put them in
[01:41:33] sleeves shuffle them up and deal them
[01:41:35] out dealing hit style
[01:41:37] correct and whoever has spot number one
[01:41:39] will'll get the first one and so on so
[01:41:42] forth through all the spots being
[01:41:44] filled so the cards are random but the
[01:41:47] spot is picked if you like a number for
[01:41:49] instance you can get number four because
[01:41:51] if that's open that's your favorite
[01:41:52] number you go with that
[01:41:54] but yeah all the packs are random there
[01:41:56] my hair keeps blown all over the place
[01:41:57] and I can see it with the wind I don't
[01:41:59] want to look like a weird I need to get
[01:42:01] a haircut I need to find somebody to
[01:42:03] give me a haircut down here my son's and
[01:42:04] I need him there's somebody heading out
[01:42:06] in there boat behind us you'll see that
[01:42:08] in a
[01:42:09] second yeah so if you want jump in on
[01:42:12] those how's it going
[01:42:14] chupaca how's your uh how's your day
[01:42:18] going you've got scissors all right good
[01:42:21] to know
[01:42:25] I think what we're going to have
[01:42:26] breakfast
[01:42:27] here check the weather the weather's not
[01:42:30] bad maybe we'll go for a sale today I
[01:42:32] mean my finger is not fully healed here
[01:42:34] I can't bend it but I think we could go
[01:42:37] out and go for a sale and check the area
[01:42:40] around if as long as the weather doesn't
[01:42:41] get really bad with wind
[01:42:43] here I don't want to motor all over the
[01:42:46] place because I got a sail boat I want a
[01:42:49] motor maybe there's somewhere nearby
[01:42:51] that we can just jump in the dingy and
[01:42:52] go for a ride too oh that might be
[01:42:55] interesting cuz the dinghy goes our
[01:42:57] dinghy goes like 20 mil an hour faster
[01:43:00] than our boat so we pl on plane and
[01:43:03] go you have to be careful when you're
[01:43:05] run with scissors so you have to make
[01:43:07] sure they're pointed up and you're
[01:43:08] holding them almost at eye level all
[01:43:10] right so when you fall it goes right
[01:43:13] past your head you got and and like and
[01:43:15] you don't hurt yourself right you don't
[01:43:17] want it going in your eye and just
[01:43:18] killing you so you want to make sure
[01:43:19] you're looking at it so when you fall
[01:43:21] and you land on it you can make sure it
[01:43:22] goes right by
[01:43:24] you yeah yeah you want to make sure you
[01:43:27] know where it's was

[01:47:47] watch out don't bump the cameras and
[01:47:48] show
[01:47:50] after well depending on what's going on
[01:47:52] here
[01:47:53] we're hopefully going to get in this
[01:47:55] week coming up to have them work on the
[01:47:57] boat get have a solar
[01:47:59] and water maker bottom paint and then um
[01:48:04] batteries for the solar and all that
[01:48:05] stuff and then once that's done we'll we
[01:48:09] have to hang out here this area for a
[01:48:10] little while because the the U the
[01:48:12] Christmas winds are end of January
[01:48:14] versus the middle of January I thought
[01:48:15] they were middle of January for some
[01:48:17] whatever my reason was so we have to
[01:48:19] wait more in the end of January so it's
[01:48:21] going to be between here St Thomas and
[01:48:23] BBI for a little while well we're
[01:48:25] waiting for those winds to break down
[01:48:27] when we have like a day or two to go so
[01:48:28] like if we don't have them come in today
[01:48:31] I mean this week and we're not going to
[01:48:32] be on the they're not going to do work
[01:48:33] on the boat until say like next week
[01:48:35] what we'll do is we'll set we'll sail
[01:48:38] from here Saturday I mean um Tuesday to
[01:48:41] go to St Thomas again and hang out there
[01:48:42] there's a friend of mine from um high
[01:48:44] school that actually lives there and
[01:48:45] when he saw that I was there said hey
[01:48:46] you should come over to a place and hang
[01:48:48] out so we're going to see if we can
[01:48:49] anchor at one of the um beaches
[01:48:51] nearby and uh we'll hang out there for
[01:48:53] like a week or so and then um from there
[01:48:57] I don't know it really depends on the
[01:48:58] weather it's really
[01:49:02] good I go get some like orange juice or
[01:49:04] something like uh Kool-Aid yeah not bad
[01:49:07] you can have whatever is in your water
[01:49:08] bottle cuz I'm not getting up to make
[01:49:09] you koola right now cool no you cannot
[01:49:12] okay sorry I don't want I don't want the
[01:49:14] red
[01:49:15] everywhere there still should be stuff
[01:49:17] in your bottles though okay boys all
[01:49:20] right thank you Mommy very delicious
[01:49:23] good something different I was trying to
[01:49:24] think of something different
[01:49:29] yeah y well it is fun uh cck clack
[01:49:32] that's uh took a while to get here but
[01:49:35] we got here and we're uh I think we're
[01:49:36] doing well once we get the solar stuff
[01:49:39] and that put on we'll be doing even
[01:49:43] better we won't have to be running um
[01:49:46] the generator all the time
[01:49:49] yep and we won't have to do this ow y
[01:49:53] theoretically we won't even need to plug
[01:49:54] in when we're at a dock cuz the uh the
[01:49:57] solar will take care of us that's a big
[01:49:59] one that I remember you
[01:50:04] having this is my newer one yeah
[01:50:07] bigger they lost us
[01:50:11] how I don't know cuz I just I don't have
[01:50:13] my phone on we're not super
[01:50:16] L go get something
[01:50:32] your M CL uh will no they said uh nice
[01:50:36] only four spots left I don't
[01:50:48] know I think it's good now
[01:50:54] good now and we're back looks like I
[01:50:56] dropped it off for some reason so uh I
[01:50:59] think I'm okay first while it's left in
[01:51:01] the break let's get that done we can get
[01:51:03] our break going and do a little
[01:51:04] adventuring here and then uh close it up
[01:51:06] what the maybe we'll see if it doesn't
[01:51:09] fill and um there's like one or two
[01:51:11] spots left I'll probably let you I'll
[01:51:13] let you guys take those spots how's that
[01:51:15] yeah yeah all right so let's see what
[01:51:18] happens here let's see at least get to
[01:51:19] six so that way we can do that here hey
[01:51:21] George thanks for coming in hanging out
[01:51:23] sorry about that what I was saying was
[01:51:24] will we going to will we s around go to
[01:51:26] different places but we have to get our
[01:51:28] solar and stuff and soled and
[01:51:30] theoretically when solar's installed we
[01:51:32] won't even need to be able to plug in we
[01:51:33] won't even need to plug in at the dock
[01:51:36] because the solar will run all of our
[01:51:39] air conditionings
[01:51:41] Electric Refrigerator everything that
[01:51:43] we're using electric it should
[01:51:44] theoretically run Daddy yeah why does it
[01:51:47] say
[01:51:50] o what that noise does it sound like
[01:51:55] slurping or is that
[01:52:00] splashing laughing oh dang hoping for

[01:55:50] four spots left in that break thank you
[01:55:52] ni for letting everybody know I
[01:55:54] appreciate
[01:55:59] that I like that the only gas station on
[01:56:02] the Rock that's funny I like the way you
[01:56:04] said that I love when people make those
[01:56:06] comments like it's this thing it's that
[01:56:07] thing like how because I always use
[01:56:10] descriptions of locations to say where
[01:56:12] I'm going or how to get somewhere and
[01:56:14] people like don't you know the road I'm
[01:56:15] like no it's like turn left at the Green
[01:56:17] Building the green warehouse and like
[01:56:19] what serious just you'll see a green
[01:56:20] warehouse It's the only freaking green
[01:56:22] Warehouse there turn left at it like how
[01:56:24] is that hard to know I don't even look
[01:56:26] at the names I'm like turn left there
[01:56:29] yeah I know I know and I've always at
[01:56:32] the yell house over there I know and
[01:56:34] we've always and I've always figured out
[01:56:35] my ways I had friends when they they
[01:56:38] lived in different places but I drove
[01:56:39] there once and then was able to find my
[01:56:40] way back to
[01:56:44] them all right
[01:56:53] yeah exactly same well the same thing
[01:56:55] with I live we lived on an island that
[01:56:56] was bigger than everyone realize that
[01:56:59] glosser and Rockport actually are an
[01:57:01] island that they live on because you
[01:57:03] have to go over a bridge either way to
[01:57:04] get to it a lot of people forget about
[01:57:06] that
[01:57:08] and so you really can't get lost there
[01:57:11] because it's you're going to go one way
[01:57:13] or another back around yourself it just
[01:57:14] might be a longer
[01:57:17] trip I mean all it is is a a giant
[01:57:20] Circle and I've ridden around it on my
[01:57:22] bike when I was younger so I know it's
[01:57:24] not it's possible to get not really
[01:57:26] possible to get lost because I got lost
[01:57:27] in what we call dog town it's the middle
[01:57:28] of the woods all you need to do is
[01:57:30] pretty much follow a trail look at the
[01:57:31] Sun and say which direction you need to
[01:57:33] go and you get out I mean it's pretty
[01:57:37] easy people also get scared and forget
[01:57:39] about that stuff oh look the Sun goes
[01:57:41] goes up and down in what directions oh
[01:57:46] yes anyways we got four spots
[01:57:50] left two and three I think are the only
[01:57:53] ones that aren't taken out of the high
[01:57:55] ones ah let me see it
[01:57:58] all natural Compass
[01:58:02] exactly is there only one spot remaining
[01:58:04] here why does it say one
[01:58:08] remaining this is really acting weird
[01:58:10] right
[01:58:15] now boat coming out here
[01:58:23] I really need my glasses I left my
[01:58:26] contct there four spots left there all
[01:58:29] right let's get
[01:58:30] it guys's got open his boat
[01:58:36] around maneuvering the boat going
[01:58:40] somewhere five to eight available thank
[01:58:42] you Nico that's what I was trying to
[01:58:45] figure out it said four spots left for
[01:58:47] some reason then it said none left like
[01:58:49] that doesn't make sense
[01:58:53] I don't know what she's doing he's tur
[01:58:54] around so we can leave he backed out of
[01:58:57] the oh he backed out of the SWOT there
[01:58:59] he backed out of there oh all right that
[01:59:01] makes sense I
[01:59:08] guess where's it
[01:59:17] going he's not turning he stopped that's
[01:59:20] what I'm saying
[01:59:24] maybe he is
[01:59:25] turning pushing you just push out extra
[01:59:29] power the one that's pushing you the
[01:59:30] other way so it'll push you away from
[01:59:31] the
[01:59:32] wind I don't know where he going oh he's
[01:59:35] using the that's why I know what his
[01:59:37] problem is well at least I wouldn't use
[01:59:40] it like that when you got when you get
[01:59:41] Motors like that you don't have like you
[01:59:42] don't have um and you don't have um a
[01:59:45] Rudder the best way to do is just set it
[01:59:46] in the motors like straight and then use
[01:59:49] your pro use your power of your Motors
[01:59:50] he kept turning and that's what I was
[01:59:52] that's why he was going different that
[01:59:53] was the first time I've SE him touches
[01:59:54] wheel oh the first time you saw him
[01:59:55] touch the wheel all right never mind
[01:59:56] then he backed out and he did a pivot
[01:59:57] with his Motors right there oh nice
[01:59:59] that's a nice looking boat what is that
[02:00:01] a whaler no that's a SE is a oh seaox I
[02:00:06] think it's
[02:00:07] seaox I thought it looked like the other
[02:00:09] one that that wher that we passed
[02:00:11] earlier when they had it up there they
[02:00:12] must be very mustem is very close to the
[02:00:14] Sea Hunt emblem yeah I was going say
[02:00:16] that looks like a Se Hun that look I was
[02:00:17] going to say those ones have um started
[02:00:19] to look a little better recently one
[02:00:22] looking at oh I'm saying even looks
[02:00:24] similar to the others now what I'm kind
[02:00:25] of getting at they're trying to make
[02:00:27] everything look the same I think that's
[02:00:28] my
[02:00:30] guess it's probably the older ones it
[02:00:32] looks like I wonder if they buy the um
[02:00:35] like the molds and use them type thing
[02:00:37] and then just brand them oh that might
[02:00:39] be why they're able to have cheaper
[02:00:40] things too ah interesting all right
[02:00:43] talking to myself there I don't know but
[02:00:45] I put too much cheese we got a couple
[02:00:47] spots left there if anybody wants jump
[02:00:50] on them
[02:00:53] and hang out with
[02:00:57] us let's get two we can get two of those
[02:01:00] spots done we'll be uh we'll F finish up
[02:01:03] here and I think I'll run it myself
[02:01:05] because we have the boys pick a couple
[02:01:07] of them if they'd
[02:01:09] like yeah they all look the same now
[02:01:12] exactly you're looking at them like oh
[02:01:14] that looks oh no no that's not it you
[02:01:15] have to like look at the emblem and
[02:01:17] before you used to be able to tell
[02:01:18] because like the headlights would look
[02:01:19] one way or you know something like that
[02:01:22] and or or just like the shape of it now
[02:01:24] they're
[02:01:26] all belly
[02:01:29] buttons everybody's got one it's just a
[02:01:31] little bit
[02:01:41] different all right I think I'm going to
[02:01:44] have to finish the coffee here and we
[02:01:46] may go and uh check out what we can do

[02:02:49] no that's there's a difference strong
[02:02:51] coffee weat coffee I like strong coffee
[02:02:54] I want to taste the sludge of the coffee
[02:02:56] going down my throat well all you tasted
[02:02:59] was coffee
[02:03:01] grounds exactly you only need one cup
[02:03:03] rather than L than two or four you just
[02:03:06] have one cup but you over fill it and
[02:03:08] there coffee grounds covering the bottom
[02:03:10] of the well that just means we need a
[02:03:12] larger coffee thing to take hold more so
[02:03:15] that we can put in it and and make it
[02:03:16] strong 12 cups honey or I'll
[02:03:18] make or we should make uh have more in
[02:03:22] there and put it in and only do eight
[02:03:24] cups or something like that
[02:03:27] no I think we need more that's why I I
[02:03:30] like it thck thick coffee huh maybe you
[02:03:34] need water if you need more energy I
[02:03:36] have I know I need some water I need to
[02:03:37] go take a drink of water

[02:04:38] I put my plate
[02:04:40] away use the restroom I'm going to run a
[02:04:42] giveaway so I can use go what what I'm
[02:04:45] going to do I have to go go PE just put
[02:04:48] the finished coffee back into the
[02:04:50] reservoir and Brew it again with more
[02:04:52] fresh grounds you know what that's
[02:04:53] actually uh that's called jet fuel and
[02:04:56] um you do that in
[02:05:00] sales get you
[02:05:01] [Music]
[02:05:03] going I think that's what it's called

[02:05:06] fuel that and then you put in a uh I
[02:05:08] don't know we used to brew a night shift
[02:05:11] a double patch on a single pot with salt
[02:05:13] in it yes no it wasn't salt there was
[02:05:16] one other thing somebody had used to I
[02:05:18] think it was like they had espresso
[02:05:19] beans every now and again they had
[02:05:20] ground up they throw in it that's what
[02:05:23] it was I think that's what they had
[02:05:24] because there was a guy that had an
[02:05:25] espresso beans that liked it so you
[02:05:27] throw a little espresso piece some of
[02:05:29] that in there and then you're really

[02:21:48] um what was uh
[02:21:55] we had gotten hacked at one point like

[02:21:59] like a insurance company I can't
[02:22:00] remember what they gave
[02:22:02] us but we have something monitoring it I
[02:22:04] think we have another year of it left
[02:22:05] because it was monitoring for so long so
[02:22:07] we put our information in there and if
[02:22:09] anybody tries to create anything or do
[02:22:11] anything or they see access to stuff we
[02:22:13] get notifications it had a couple of
[02:22:14] them before but I think those were um
[02:22:17] those ended up being uh like information
[02:22:20] that was bad that we just ended up
[02:22:22] taking
[02:22:23] off hey Mr F thanks for coming in and
[02:22:25] saying that I appreciate

[02:23:56] captain we're cing our boat here as
[02:23:58] we're we're filling our water tanks
[02:24:00] right now we've been using more than
[02:24:02] normal because we can fill it every day
[02:24:04] with the $5 fee that we're
[02:24:06] charged so we just use it willy-nilly
[02:24:08] which is not good but we do know how to
[02:24:11] turn it off and on and do better with it
[02:24:13] plus when we get a water maker we can
[02:24:14] use little step to be better but we'll
[02:24:16] we'll uh won't have to be as strict cuz
[02:24:19] it can make enough water for us the ones
[02:24:21] we're looking
[02:24:22] at desalinators for those of you that
[02:24:24] were wondering what when I said water

[02:24:46] fingertip here this here is uh and four
[02:24:50] pieces and I can't bend it anymore the

[02:24:54] to bend to tip my finger anymore because
[02:24:56] of how I broke
[02:24:59] it what can you do right but at least I
[02:25:02] can have a
[02:25:03] hand and it will work I'll be able to
[02:25:06] bend it and do things I'll use it for
[02:25:08] something else it'll be good like maybe
[02:25:09] it'll be good to dig up in the nose for

[02:53:56] you started off your adventure in this
[02:53:58] Wasteland wandering through a vault door
[02:54:01] now you had a trip through a vault door
[02:54:03] you happen to be jumping in partway
[02:54:04] through where you got to the third
[02:54:06] floor door you made it through there you
[02:54:10] fought off the pirates that you found in
[02:54:14] the computer room to win and you're able
[02:54:16] to find
[02:54:18] the
[02:54:20] location you're able to find this on a
[02:54:25] pirate we going to pop these back up
[02:54:27] here a little bit actually I'll do that
[02:54:29] in a second you found this on a
[02:54:31] pirate that you had to you ended up
[02:54:33] killing the pirate boss here that pirate
[02:54:36] boss you killed him as he went the third
[02:54:38] place there that third floor and you
[02:54:41] found this you've gone through all of
[02:54:42] these locations here that you went to no
[02:54:45] which was where the Pirates were
[02:54:46] guarding a
[02:54:48] computer that open a door to it looks
[02:54:50] like maybe the TR the uh your your
[02:54:52] stairs up or maybe a an elevator I don't
[02:54:55] know that's where you guys are at right
[02:54:57] now with your
[02:54:59] adventure you guys it's kind of like a
[02:55:02] kind of like a Dungeons and Dragons type
[02:55:04] game but Fallout is more Wasteland like
[02:55:06] if that makes
[02:55:08] sense healthy health health and buff you
[02:55:11] know what in Alpha were because with
[02:55:13] health and buff you didn't get a weapon
[02:55:14] you will get a weapon Choice also you'll
[02:55:16] get a knife option pistol plasma
[02:55:20] rifle a sword or an assault rifle you
[02:55:24] can get any of those with the amount of
[02:55:26] ammo that would come in regularly but
[02:55:27] your health you can get any of those but
[02:55:29] you have strength agility intelligence
[02:55:33] engineering and there's a luck buff
[02:55:37] also so Luke has weapon choice and buff
[02:55:40] choice so there we
[02:55:41] go thank you thank
[02:55:44] you if anybody wants to uh do that that
[02:55:47] is your guys choice is there you always
[02:55:50] can trade it's up to you now what I'm
[02:55:52] going to do here is I'm going to take
[02:55:53] all these were from uh the other ones
[02:55:54] and hand them out while you're deciding
[02:55:55] what you're doing if you're going to go
[02:55:57] to any of the uh you know maybe you're
[02:55:58] going to go over hang out with the one
[02:55:59] hour
[02:56:00] Bender maybe you want to go to the hole
[02:56:02] in the wall I don't know it's up to you
[02:56:04] guys but now we're going to hand out our
[02:56:06] cards that were the uh Commons and
[02:56:08] uncommons now so that everybody gets
[02:56:09] those
[02:56:10] things while we're waiting for you guys
[02:56:13] to decide what weapons and items you're
[02:56:15] choosing in the adventure here it's kind
[02:56:17] of like a d andd Adventure we roll dice
[02:56:18] and everything make it
[02:56:22] fun at least we seem to have fun here
[02:56:24] doing it we have uh you get to do
[02:56:27] whatever you kind of do whatever you
[02:56:29] want your mind comes up with and I
[02:56:31] decide whether it's uh viable in my land
[02:56:53] how do you win
[02:56:55] well you you can win each encounter but
[02:56:59] there kind of like a hard play hard to
[02:57:01] win the game because it's uh it's like a
[02:57:04] an RPG all right unless you die you just
[02:57:07] continue on in the encounters beating
[02:57:09] each encounter and seeing what happens
[02:57:11] so for instance the last time they beat
[02:57:13] that pirate boss then they got to there
[02:57:15] now they're going to be seeing where
[02:57:17] they go for the next
[02:57:19] cuz we'll have to uh I'll show you one
[02:57:21] second here hold on let's do this I'll
[02:57:23] show you now since you're there anyways
[02:57:24] we're going to go
[02:57:31] um there you go we're going to put this
[02:57:33] is
[02:57:35] where you wander
[02:57:39] forward and you see through that
[02:57:43] doorway an elevator and look at that you
[02:57:46] can go to the ground floor
[02:57:50] well looks like you're all going to go
[02:57:52] up uh and go for a
[02:58:03] ride but were you saying no we don't
[02:58:05] have uh the criticals there you can't do
[02:58:07] that with these these are just more the
[02:58:09] Buffs for something to make it last for
[02:58:11] the uh there we haven't done criticals
[02:58:13] in it before but you know what I guess
[02:58:15] if you have a buff you could do I don't
[02:58:18] see why you can't get a critical if you
[02:58:19] want it to be that if that's what you'd
[02:58:29] like yes you're taking the elevator
[02:58:39] up there we go passed out all the
[02:58:43] cards get those in there
[02:58:48] take Health
[02:58:50] weapon yes we're going to hang go up in
[02:58:52] the elevator and see what's up there all
[02:58:53] right Alpha so that's what we're doing
[02:58:55] with our game you get to participate if
[02:58:57] you'd
[02:58:57] like it's always up to you guys what you
[02:59:00] do in the adventure it's not me I just I
[02:59:02] just help uh direct it I'm more the
[02:59:04] narrator you guys are the main
[02:59:10] characters so you got to decide what
[02:59:12] you're going to
[02:59:13] do like uh earlier we had some friends
[02:59:16] they went and visited sugar Steve
[02:59:18] got some weapons and things from
[02:59:20] them I mean uh some buff from them
[02:59:31] earlier all right sounds
[02:59:35] good oh I'm sorry if I'm cutting out a
[02:59:37] bad let me um let me see if I can figure
[02:59:40] that out a little bit better here I'm
[02:59:42] I'm going to check the internet again
[02:59:48] so you have um yep so you can choose a
[02:59:51] weapon you have a knife you can choose
[02:59:54] you can choose a pistol you can choose a
[02:59:56] plasma
[02:59:58] rifle you can choose an assault rifle or
[03:00:02] you can choose a
[03:00:03] sword then you also get that's your
[03:00:07] weapon Choice all right then you can
[03:00:10] choose you get a buff also you can go
[03:00:12] with strength booster you can go with an
[03:00:16] agility booster
[03:00:18] you can go with an intelligence
[03:00:20] booster an engineering booster or a uh
[03:00:24] luck one which I don't have at the
[03:00:25] moment then you have health pack Choice
[03:00:28] which gets you a 20 health pack or you
[03:00:30] could go with a uh plus five over five
[03:00:34] rounds or five rolls or radiation
[03:00:37] removal or like a buff type thing that's
[03:00:39] a an an instant buff for a short amount
[03:00:41] of
[03:00:46] time yeah it could have be me cuz the uh
[03:00:48] where we our starlink has been um we're
[03:00:51] there's weather rolling through so
[03:00:53] hopefully we'll be all right and be able
[03:00:55] to keep this going all right but uh
[03:00:56] weather's rolling through so we're just
[03:00:58] dealing with the our the starlink right
[03:01:00] now that's what I think it may be first
[03:01:01] time where we've had some weather come
[03:01:03] in like uh St storms and stuff so we'll
[03:01:05] see how it works in
[03:01:13] it all right yep well if you're going to
[03:01:16] go the plasma rifle i' I'd say go go
[03:01:18] with an intelligence because that will
[03:01:20] make your plasma rifle so you get a plus
[03:01:21] five on your plasma rifle when you roll
[03:01:23] if you have a pistol it's a plus two
[03:01:26] knife plus two sword plus five plas uh
[03:01:30] assault rifle is a plus three but you
[03:01:31] get like three shots on that
[03:01:33] one um and then your plasma rifle if you
[03:01:37] use intelligence that will get you more
[03:01:40] though it'll be a plus six all right
[03:01:42] there you go so you go we got
[03:01:44] that I like it I'll end up getting the
[03:01:47] um I'm working on getting the stuff
[03:01:48] together for a
[03:01:50] uh better View and having it easy so
[03:01:53] that anybody can see it when they want I
[03:01:54] kind of put the link out there so that
[03:01:56] you guys can look at it and see where
[03:01:57] you
[03:01:59] are Cody's mom putting your stuff
[03:02:04] away you all
[03:02:07] right that came more than I
[03:02:12] wanted yeah uh you had that weapon that
[03:02:14] and then you had um Health packs
[03:02:18] was you could do a health pack a plus 20
[03:02:20] health pack which is just a regular plus
[03:02:22] 20 a plus five over five rounds which is
[03:02:26] you know 25 but you know who knows
[03:02:27] what'll happen maybe something will stop
[03:02:29] it from being able to work at some point
[03:02:31] but you know those are those are you
[03:02:32] know we'll have to find out but then we
[03:02:34] have also the other one which is a
[03:02:38] um radiation removal in case you get
[03:02:40] some radiation or you have like an
[03:02:41] instant buff for like one encounter
[03:02:43] that'll give you an extra an extra buff
[03:02:45] for the encounter so you can say maybe
[03:02:47] you need to make yourself stronger or
[03:02:49] maybe you need to make yourself more
[03:02:50] intelligent for something that's what we
[03:02:53] do now I'm going to have to put Cody's
[03:02:55] mom stuff in a top
[03:02:57] loader for the uh for that there and I'm
[03:03:00] going to put Twisted mines in one
[03:03:05] too have a health pack
[03:03:08] yeah yeah you can get a regular health
[03:03:10] pack or you can get any of those other
[03:03:11] ones that I offed I just don't have a

[03:05:49] and uh when you get up you
[03:06:00] um once you get up to uh the elevator
[03:06:05] there you go wander in and then you step
[03:06:07] out and you go whoa the elevator door is
[03:06:10] open you wander out through a hole there
[03:06:13] and you see what is this in the
[03:06:15] distance a ship of some kind what do we
[03:06:18] have going
[03:06:20] on
[03:06:22] interesting and you look down and you
[03:06:24] find a Coin well this will be
[03:06:27] used for our 50/50s now we'll do a
[03:06:30] little Spin and see where it lands all
[03:06:34] right that's what we'll be doing now
[03:06:36] with those
[03:06:55] okay I think we're getting back there so
[03:06:58] I don't know if anybody saw that or
[03:06:59] heard that but yeah there you go but yes
[03:07:01] from now on this will be uh this is
[03:07:04] going to be heads that'll be tails and
[03:07:07] we'll spin our coin and see if uh we get
[03:07:10] heads or
[03:07:11] tails and that's what's going to go on
[03:07:13] there for our adventuring but you guys
[03:07:16] just wandered up and you wandered
[03:07:17] outside to see uh did you see the did
[03:07:19] you see the room there did you see what
[03:07:22] was going
[03:07:23] on that new
[03:07:26] place you got out top floor you
[03:07:29] wandering out you see what's in there
[03:07:31] you're looking up front and well that's
[03:07:34] interesting what is this ship we have
[03:07:37] what are we going to do there I mean you
[03:07:41] do have
[03:07:43] this book that was
[03:07:45] found and you just got up to the third
[03:07:48] floor and you know know what actually
[03:07:50] we're going to maybe should we uh should
[03:07:53] we read his next
[03:07:57] thing should we read what this
[03:08:00] is looks like uh he found this is his
[03:08:03] his elevator for his safe his safe where
[03:08:05] he goes for holding his loot hiding spot
[03:08:08] but maybe oh it's a bit of a story about
[03:08:10] what he's how they got the
[03:08:12] boat ah look at that the first location
[03:08:15] where the boat was intriguing
[03:08:19] maybe you'll find some fun things on
[03:08:24] there or will you you get to choose some
[03:08:29] dice here to roll in our adventure we
[03:08:31] have a few of them then we also have our
[03:08:34] actual D and D dice here that are some
[03:08:36] friends of ours got us a bit while ago
[03:08:38] which we do like these nice Stone ones
[03:08:41] work very
[03:08:43] nicely for our needs
[03:08:48] you all get to decide uh what you're
[03:08:49] doing in our adventure
[03:08:52] today don't touch the boat
[03:08:59] Nemo uh it looks kind of like it maybe
[03:09:01] no not
[03:09:04] really we put it similar we made it
[03:09:06] similar makes it easier to do come up
[03:09:08] with
[03:09:15] things all righty
[03:09:18] we're going to be done we're got to get
[03:09:19] this rolling we got our break going we
[03:09:22] had to stop a few times because the
[03:09:23] technology slowing down so that's okay
[03:09:25] though I think got figure out I'm going
[03:09:27] to just pretty much I have them blocked
[03:09:29] and I think that's what's been going on
[03:09:31] well yeah well definitely I don't know
[03:09:34] no one but well no one was and then I
[03:09:36] stopped
[03:09:37] it he didn't try
[03:09:40] again all
[03:09:44] right so we have our uh our book our
[03:09:48] 50/50s that we need now and um we're
[03:09:53] figuring out what we're doing are we
[03:09:54] going to wander into the um the boat and
[03:09:57] see what you see and see what you find
[03:09:59] or are you going to uh do you need to go
[03:10:00] to any of the locations first do you
[03:10:02] need to check out one of the safe havens
[03:10:04] you know anybody have a locked door a
[03:10:06] storage vendor the hidden door for a
[03:10:08] safe haven more be a hole in the wall I
[03:10:10] know some of you have a one arm vendor
[03:10:13] access
[03:10:18] but we'll see what happens here we're
[03:10:20] waiting for our adventure to
[03:10:30] begin hopefully I'm not freezing too
[03:10:32] much I think I'm okay are we
[03:10:36] good you once you're done with your
[03:10:38] stuff you're going to be well we're
[03:10:39] going to start with the adventure if you
[03:10:40] say you want to begin if you're good I
[03:10:42] wait I pretty much I'm waiting on
[03:10:43] everybody to say they're good if they or
[03:10:44] unless they need to get anything else
[03:10:45] that's what I was saying do you want to
[03:10:46] go where there's some of you in here
[03:10:48] that have the options to do that sorry
[03:10:49] if I wasn't clear you want to get some
[03:10:52] of you have safe haven codes so you can
[03:10:53] go to a safe haven and do some trading
[03:10:56] if that's what you'd like to do or you
[03:10:58] just want to jump right in and uh see
[03:10:59] what H see what you find in the
[03:11:04] boat it's up to
[03:11:08] you I think uh we might be at the stage
[03:11:11] where we're going into the boat no one
[03:11:12] looks like they're doing
[03:11:13] anything I know Nico's helping up um
[03:11:16] update some stuff so I know he's busy so
[03:11:19] I don't mind
[03:11:24] that jumping in KF KF has the safe haven
[03:11:28] Choice KF hasn't given a weapon either I
[03:11:31] gave you an option of a weapon there
[03:11:33] what do you
[03:11:35] need but you know what what seems like
[03:11:37] we're going a little
[03:11:39] slow with it uh with some of the others
[03:11:41] maybe the guys are at work and stuff
[03:11:42] like that so what we're going to do is
[03:11:44] going to kind of go a little autopilot
[03:11:45] and let the chat help
[03:11:48] oh you have a good one thank you KF
[03:11:50] we'll catch you in whenever we can yeah
[03:11:52] thank you thank you thank you so what
[03:11:54] we're going to do then is we're going to
[03:11:56] move on with our adventur seems like
[03:11:57] nobody's saying they're going to do
[03:11:59] anything and we're going to go on to see
[03:12:00] what
[03:12:01] happens so we go
[03:12:06] wandering out
[03:12:15] there there we go
[03:12:17] and you see in the boat you go wandering
[03:12:19] onto it and you see in front of
[03:12:22] you onto that boat you wander into one
[03:12:24] of those
[03:12:25] hulls and see oh no it is a bunch of
[03:12:29] crabs you start running through but
[03:12:30] there's a bunch of different stuff in
[03:12:31] there all kinds of wasteland loot now
[03:12:37] you need to
[03:12:38] decide are you going to run from those
[03:12:42] crabs or are you going to fight those
[03:12:44] crabs and try to take the loot that is
[03:12:46] there
[03:12:53] o
[03:13:10] [Applause]
[03:13:18] [Applause]
[03:13:30] um fight the crab fight the crabs all
[03:13:33] right here we go all right we're going
[03:13:34] to fight them so we're going to see if
[03:13:36] the crabs attack first cuz they did see
[03:13:37] you come in so we're going to spin we're
[03:13:40] going to see what happens
[03:13:41] here all
[03:13:45] right okay let's do it we're going to
[03:13:47] spin we're going to see what
[03:13:52] happens we spin
[03:13:55] it cuz oh you look at that you guys got
[03:13:58] heads it's you guys that get to go
[03:14:00] you're going first hungry crabs they got
[03:14:02] lucky they was Tails if they were going
[03:14:03] to go you got heads you get to go first
[03:14:06] you guys got lucky so the
[03:14:12] crabs are there and you need to decide
[03:14:15] what you're going to do with those crabs
[03:14:21] what are you going to do
[03:14:24] now I know you're fighting them all
[03:14:26] right you have your weapons which ones
[03:14:28] are we using for our dice choose your
[03:14:30] dice and you get to go after them we're
[03:14:32] going to see what happens there's going
[03:14:33] to be a handful of crabs they're very
[03:14:34] easily to kill very easy to kill all
[03:14:36] right very easy to kill
[03:14:40] here all you have to worry about with
[03:14:43] them
[03:14:45] are the very easy to kill now some of
[03:14:48] them can be like five Health some of
[03:14:50] them could be 30 Health but generally
[03:14:52] they're going to be like five health and
[03:14:54] you have about 15 of them that's running
[03:15:01] around but you see one of them has 10
[03:15:05] Health one of them has 20 one Health and
[03:15:09] then one of them
[03:15:12] has 15 health so you get a few of them
[03:15:15] with a little bit more Health there as
[03:15:17] those crabs wandering around we do roll
[03:15:19] for hits
[03:15:21] yes all right hungry crabs you're going
[03:15:23] to go
[03:15:25] with plasma all right plasma now which
[03:15:27] dice are we going to
[03:15:31] use you have to let me know on that one
[03:15:34] I don't think he did on that
[03:15:39] yet Purple dice purple dice it is put
[03:15:43] that up there oh that one fell out we're
[03:15:45] going to put that off the side we're
[03:15:46] going to see what
[03:15:48] happens here we
[03:15:50] go all right you hit a hit you get a hit
[03:15:54] it's only going to 13 to hit those ones
[03:15:56] cuz they're small all right you hit
[03:15:58] one and you C look at this very easy
[03:16:02] very easy that's a good and easy
[03:16:05] one you damaged of that one
[03:16:08] was 10
[03:16:18] total damage that and you kill that one
[03:16:22] there
[03:16:24] wonderful you kill one of
[03:16:29] them now who's going
[03:16:31] next they're very easy to shoot got them
[03:16:33] with the the plasma rifle they're not
[03:16:35] bad their their shs are pretty easy to
[03:16:37] take care of there's one of them that's
[03:16:40] bigger though there's a couple bigger
[03:16:43] ones are you going to roll we're going
[03:16:45] to attack these we're going to go after
[03:16:48] our crabs let me get the crabs on here
[03:16:51] easier to
[03:17:03] get you decide are you going to the crab
[03:17:08] room ni's going to run in with the
[03:17:10] knives all right Nico runs in with
[03:17:13] knives well there you go Nico you got a
[03:17:15] 10 plus all your knives you're going to
[03:17:16] go in and you actually go and you
[03:17:19] hit you are asked around allowed to do
[03:17:22] that that is correct you go with your
[03:17:24] knives that damage on that there you go
[03:17:29] doesn't matter we're going to I'm pretty
[03:17:30] sure with your two knives you're going
[03:17:31] to get enough here
[03:17:32] but there you go there's yours you kill
[03:17:36] one of them with your knife cuz you get
[03:17:43] six and there you go the next one is
[03:17:45] dead
[03:18:00] what are you going to do
[03:18:04] next you can definitely ask around the
[03:18:06] surrounding areas if you want to know
[03:18:07] what's going
[03:18:10] on ah take some crab meat that's not a
[03:18:13] bad idea take some crab meat back you

[03:18:15] that grab some crab meat if you want uh
[03:18:17] coming up I know you might not want to
[03:18:19] go after just now you might want to wait
[03:18:20] a little bit cuz I mean those crabs are
[03:18:22] uh they're not they're not like nice
[03:18:24] they're charging her all around coming
[03:18:26] toward you
[03:18:31] guys ah Alpha oh look at that I think
[03:18:35] there might be look at that H you
[03:18:39] running in in the background Alpha and
[03:18:40] you look around and it looks like you
[03:18:43] run past a couple containers there
[03:18:46] huh look at that there is one there's
[03:18:50] one that looks like there's maybe a
[03:18:51] black powder around
[03:18:53] it now remember this is a pirate ship
[03:18:55] you're going to want to take this pirate
[03:18:57] ship later you guys are going to be
[03:18:58] taking it you don't want to cause too
[03:18:59] too much damage you don't want to like
[03:19:00] blow holes and things but maybe a small
[03:19:03] keg might take care of some things and
[03:19:05] you pirate sword it in all right pirate
[03:19:06] sword for
[03:19:08] Luke and Luke you get not well PIR
[03:19:10] sword's enough you hit one you come in
[03:19:13] and you got four
[03:19:17] and you kill him there you go which one
[03:19:19] we oh we didn't see which one going
[03:19:21] after I
[03:19:26] lied I forgot about that covering it up
[03:19:29] so you can't
[03:19:32] see the big guy 21 ah you saw it already
[03:19:38] but anyways you've got look at that
[03:19:42] 12 16
[03:19:47] he beat him you beat the big
[03:19:50] guy that was uh yeah all
[03:19:59] right that big guy is dead d d
[03:20:05] dead wait a minute that's not how you
[03:20:08] spell that you're still running in there
[03:20:11] I think we have a couple people left to
[03:20:12] make some decisions on what they're
[03:20:14] going to be doing
[03:20:44] you going to shoot the barrel
[03:20:49] yes there are 12
[03:20:51] left going to shoot the barrel that's
[03:20:53] not a bad idea you shoot the barrel and
[03:20:55] oh my do you guys see that that is a
[03:20:58] natural
[03:21:01] 20
[03:21:04] wow congratulations on your first roll
[03:21:06] my
[03:21:08] friend cuz now you shoot that barrel
[03:21:11] with your plasma
[03:21:12] rifle this is what's going to happen on
[03:21:14] a barrel bomb I know this is what we're
[03:21:16] going to do right now so you
[03:21:19] shoot you shoot one of those barrels in
[03:21:23] there this is what we're going to let
[03:21:25] happen here I'm going to let each one of
[03:21:26] these
[03:21:27] dice equal a crab that you're going to
[03:21:32] hit and then we're going to use our
[03:21:33] multiplier to see what you get
[03:21:35] multiplied and if you don't happen to
[03:21:36] kill it so you're going to choose which
[03:21:38] ones you want to hit right now all right
[03:21:39] you're going to choose if you want to
[03:21:40] hit the two big ones that are left which
[03:21:41] is a 10 and a 15 and then the rest are
[03:21:44] fives but we're going to roll we're
[03:21:46] going to see what happens with this and
[03:21:48] we get that's what we'll do for our
[03:21:49] multiplier since you did that and it was
[03:21:51] an explosion I mean that was some good
[03:21:53] one buddy that was a good good idea
[03:21:55] Alpha noodling good idea Alpha noodling
[03:21:58] I like it he plasma that barrel barrel
[03:22:02] barrel
[03:22:04] barrel and there we
[03:22:08] go you to let us know
[03:22:12] now toasted crab meat we like it
[03:22:22] we're taking those crabs out ah gra to
[03:22:24] the big ones all right so you go two big
[03:22:25] ones and then a small one all right we
[03:22:28] roll let me see oh well look at that one
[03:22:31] of them's Zed if we multiply you have to
[03:22:34] see what happens as long as the
[03:22:35] multiplier is not
[03:22:37] one you are going to get kill everything
[03:22:42] so the multiplier that's what you use
[03:22:43] for a multiplier 1 to four when you get
[03:22:44] a natural 20 you got four you got four
[03:22:49] they're dead you killed them all it does
[03:22:52] not
[03:22:57] matter you got those three are
[03:23:00] gone then it's going to
[03:23:08] be and
[03:23:13] then that one was
[03:23:18] oh no you did not kill them all you
[03:23:20] almost did no you did you killed them
[03:23:22] all that's 12 my math is
[03:23:26] wrong good job my friend you killed all
[03:23:28] of those now we're down to one 2 3 4
[03:23:32] five six seven seven left
[03:23:40] wait 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
[03:23:47] oh I
[03:23:49] miscounted 8
[03:24:04] n all right nine left now this is what
[03:24:08] happens the crabs they go now oh
[03:24:12] boy you guys are not lucky the crabs
[03:24:16] they get a natural
[03:24:22] 20 Luke's going to go the
[03:24:24] Gatling all right we can do that but
[03:24:27] that natural 20 is not good for you guys
[03:24:30] because they come
[03:24:31] out and they hit you so
[03:24:35] Twisted goes down we're going to see
[03:24:39] we're going to use two dice cuz the
[03:24:40] natural 20 on that
[03:24:42] one oh everybody's going to go down 10
[03:24:47] they got a big hit on you all
[03:24:49] 90 everyone goes down
[03:24:54] 10 Cody's mom had to go it
[03:24:57] there Alpha
[03:24:59] noodling you're down to
[03:25:05] 90
[03:25:07] uh let's get Luke is down to
[03:25:12] 90 then we have Nico down to 90
[03:25:17] and anybody else that's playing let me
[03:25:18] know I forget who else was in
[03:25:25] here it's at your feet that's true it is
[03:25:28] at your feet they definitely Barrel bomb
[03:25:30] thre that grbs in their face yeah they
[03:25:32] yeah that's probably what it was you got
[03:25:33] a little unlucky with that and the
[03:25:34] barrel bomb threw them all towards you
[03:25:36] so now you said Luke is going to go with
[03:25:39] The Gap well Luke hits with a gap
[03:25:42] because it's a plus six and that's going
[03:25:43] to get him you got 13 now Luke you have
[03:25:47] uh three dice that you get to roll here
[03:25:49] all right now you can choose if you want
[03:25:51] to hit different different crabs or all
[03:25:53] kind of go out the same crab you can go
[03:25:54] one through three crabs or all left the
[03:25:56] same
[03:25:57] crab I know you lose your all the luck
[03:25:59] with the natural 20 there
[03:26:05] before you get it
[03:26:10] theide ah KP Luke Cody's
[03:26:13] mom mercel AFK Twisted Minds AFK all
[03:26:15] right KP was uh Luke is left after that
[03:26:18] so here we go
[03:26:20] KP I mean it was Luke that did that that
[03:26:23] what are you going to do are you going
[03:26:24] to swing at all of them shoot at all of
[03:26:25] them or different ones all right three
[03:26:27] different ones oh we get one's dead you
[03:26:31] kill one of them off and then that's
[03:26:32] three and two on the other all right
[03:26:34] here we
[03:26:36] go you get
[03:26:39] uh damage roll is three 2 five
[03:26:48] three two five one of them's dead
[03:26:56] there there you go my friend you got one
[03:26:58] that is killed off that leaves you with
[03:27:00] one two that leaves you with uh
[03:27:04] yeah 11 11 of them left and a couple of
[03:27:09] them with only two and three
[03:27:12] health so who's going next
[03:27:18] we've got to decide who's going after
[03:27:21] the crabs cuz you just used the Gatling
[03:27:24] gun shut off those and got three shots
[03:27:26] off tried different
[03:27:30] ones eight with two injured correct
[03:27:33] eight with two injured there you go
[03:27:35] eight with two
[03:27:39] injured what are we doing now quickly
[03:27:43] before they regroup
[03:27:53] Nico
[03:27:54] KP
[03:27:57] and Alpha I think that's who we're
[03:28:00] waiting on right
[03:28:03] now all righty let me know what you're
[03:28:05] going to do with these and we'll go from
[03:28:07] there in the restream oh looking not bad
[03:28:09] going not bad there keep spinning
[03:28:13] those Nico goes in the knives again
[03:28:16] you need to shoot or decide what you
[03:28:18] want to do you can use um uh so you know
[03:28:21] run away if you want Nico goes in with
[03:28:24] the knives dual knives oh oh well look
[03:28:28] at that Nico kills two of them with the
[03:28:31] Dual
[03:28:33] knives I like it Nico get five and
[03:28:39] five and two of them are dead you're now
[03:28:41] down to six with two injured
[03:28:46] no luckily it's metal Hollow is metal
[03:28:49] has a metal exterior you got lucky and
[03:28:51] it's protected just made a little bit of
[03:28:53] Dent so you're going to have to be safe
[03:28:54] on be careful in that area or maybe
[03:28:56] reinforce it at some point hey good
[03:28:58] morning nbol how's it
[03:29:02] going it was a I guess it must have been
[03:29:04] a luxury boat they made look like it was
[03:29:06] a wood one but it was actually made out
[03:29:08] of
[03:29:11] metal there are some Port holes through
[03:29:14] the boat there are some Port holes
[03:29:15] throughout the boat there is correct you
[03:29:17] can see those throughout the
[03:29:19] hole that one didn't break open though
[03:29:22] none of those broke open yet so you
[03:29:23] going to be safe though cuz they are
[03:29:24] nearby some of the dents you don't want
[03:29:26] to hit too many of them because you
[03:29:26] might want to get you know get water in
[03:29:28] if you're going to go sailing
[03:29:31] around you got to be
[03:29:34] careful you know you see that
[03:29:37] um you saw that boat there as you were
[03:29:39] wandering up to it that's not a bad
[03:29:41] looking boat but um know you wander up
[03:29:44] to it and you see that there are some
[03:29:45] poor holes the Sails are
[03:29:47] up you're wandering and kind of see
[03:29:50] what's going on there at the end yeah
[03:29:52] but you're in and you see those
[03:29:55] crabs they're sealed they are sealed
[03:29:58] they were sealed a long time ago due to
[03:30:01] the the Wasteland they tried to get away
[03:30:03] and that's why they're all sealed up in
[03:30:05] the metal boat this is where uh some
[03:30:06] people got down to uh we read the book
[03:30:10] we'll see where they go that's how some
[03:30:11] people think we originally got to an
[03:30:13] island safety and that's why they're all
[03:30:15] sealed up there are only six crabs left
[03:30:17] two of them are
[03:30:21] injured so we have Kap and Alpha noodle
[03:30:24] need to now let us know what we're
[03:30:28] doing decide are we going to hit
[03:30:31] anything or we going to go after
[03:30:31] something what are we going to
[03:30:40] do all right well we're going to do this
[03:30:43] crabs decided they were going to attack
[03:30:45] here
[03:30:50] ah kap's not in here all right all right
[03:30:52] all right so we can
[03:30:54] um nope you cannot trap them you can't
[03:30:57] really trap them and remove them but you
[03:30:59] can try to I don't know if there's a way
[03:31:01] to trap them uh I don't know what you
[03:31:02] have to do
[03:31:05] that we could try you know what we could
[03:31:08] try making a Contraption to trap them um
[03:31:10] I think uh Nico has some intelligence
[03:31:12] and some engineering maybe he can make a
[03:31:15] trap
[03:31:16] and maybe uh and use yeah hammocks that
[03:31:19] are hanging around for fishing nets and
[03:31:20] you can trap them and uh maybe use them
[03:31:22] for uh some food or something to protect
[03:31:24] your loot yourself later you know a way
[03:31:26] to rig it up so you when you leave the
[03:31:27] boat you open them up and they uh they
[03:31:29] go in there and then a way to you know
[03:31:30] drop some food in and close it that way
[03:31:32] your boat's protected at some point
[03:31:33] where you're leaving is that what you're
[03:31:35] thinking it's like your alarm
[03:31:39] system all right crabs are uh they
[03:31:42] they've been hanging around for a little
[03:31:43] while and oh you got lucky
[03:31:46] wait no that is the Crab side crabs come
[03:31:48] out heads was your side is the plus side
[03:31:52] crabs come
[03:31:55] out crab
[03:31:58] security crabs come out and they go
[03:32:00] after everybody hanging out that are
[03:32:01] there left and only two of them run away
[03:32:04] run out to get you one gets Alpha
[03:32:10] noodle bring you down to 88
[03:32:14] Health one gets ni bringing him down at
[03:32:17] 87 health and that's
[03:32:19] it then they run back they skitter
[03:32:34] back I like up all right here we go so
[03:32:38] Nico we're see have Nico U make this
[03:32:41] since he has a
[03:32:43] uh he has luck and engineer ing so when
[03:32:47] it comes to these things so Nico has
[03:32:50] engineering let's see Nico we're going
[03:32:52] to have you make uh they're going to
[03:32:53] protect you while you try to make a net
[03:32:55] trap for these crabs here so you have
[03:32:57] engineering and intelligence is plus
[03:32:59] eight plus luck which is five two so
[03:33:02] that's you just can't get a one
[03:33:05] man you just can't get a one and you'll
[03:33:08] make the
[03:33:09] Trap all right can't get a
[03:33:12] one well 19 works
[03:33:17] there you go 19 works now trap is made
[03:33:21] now what we got to do here
[03:33:24] is it's going to be a
[03:33:27] 50/50 that it
[03:33:29] works
[03:33:34] ready yo look at that guys it worked you
[03:33:39] drop some of the crab meat in there and
[03:33:42] look at that the rest of those crabs go
[03:33:44] skittering in
[03:33:46] to your trap
[03:33:48] there and now you got some bow security
[03:33:51] look at that Alpha
[03:33:52] noodle giant idea great
[03:33:55] idea The Crab Trap worked yo ho ho The
[03:33:59] Crab Trap
[03:34:01] works good one all right so all the
[03:34:03] crabs are trapped that you have left so
[03:34:05] that means you have
[03:34:08] um one two three
[03:34:13] four tra crabs plus uh two injured ones
[03:34:18] they got a couple one's missing a claw
[03:34:20] and one's missing a
[03:34:21] leg they'll grow back eventually ah
[03:34:24] there you go Alpha noodle hey this is
[03:34:26] fun that was fun I like how you came in
[03:34:27] with that that was a good idea all right
[03:34:30] so now what you find here is you find a
[03:34:33] mace which is a plus
[03:34:35] five you find a pirate sword o yeah you
[03:34:40] find oh wait that's not right pirate
[03:34:42] sword where's my pirate
[03:34:44] sword you find a p
[03:34:46] sword there you go that's a plus six and
[03:34:49] it gets you a uh three dice when you
[03:34:52] roll for your damage all right those are
[03:34:56] there there's also an alien Gatling gun
[03:34:59] oh my an alien Gatling gun is found a
[03:35:04] sniper
[03:35:06] rifle and there is ammo for pretty much
[03:35:08] every single weapon so you don't need to
[03:35:10] worry about that there's a infinite
[03:35:12] amount of health so you can get your
[03:35:13] health all back there as much as you
[03:35:14] need every time you get get back to the
[03:35:16] boat then you also have an intelligence
[03:35:19] booster an agility booster a strength
[03:35:22] booster an engineering booster and a
[03:35:25] luck
[03:35:26] booster and there is also one critical
[03:35:29] for each of
[03:35:32] you yes this is the this is the hull of
[03:35:35] the pirate
[03:35:37] ship there's a lot of stuff in there now
[03:35:41] the thing is though for you people that
[03:35:43] have been playing for a while
[03:35:46] the only thing
[03:35:48] is you to begin the next round lose
[03:35:53] three Buffs off of everything so it's
[03:35:56] not like you can't be at the top of at
[03:35:58] top of everything you still get a little
[03:35:59] bit but you can't completely at the top
[03:36:01] this is this is when we start and we're
[03:36:03] kind of like starting a new round so for
[03:36:05] instance Nico you're going to have two
[03:36:08] agility no strength two engineering and
[03:36:12] that's it that type of thing if that
[03:36:14] makes any sense
[03:36:16] because you need to you need to build
[03:36:17] your character back up they're on the
[03:36:19] boat now you got to get used to a boat
[03:36:21] you have to understand how to work on a
[03:36:23] boat you know all know
[03:36:25] that make any sense at all so if you
[03:36:27] want to get Buffs now you all can pick
[03:36:30] one
[03:36:31] buff or one uh of each uh one of each of
[03:36:34] the Buffs there I mean you all get a
[03:36:37] buff of each if you
[03:36:41] want and then we go from there I don't
[03:36:44] know why you wouldn't get that seasick
[03:36:46] yes kind of like you're getting seasick
[03:36:47] exactly you got to get used to the
[03:36:49] boat so what happens is we're going to
[03:36:52] do that so we're going to remove
[03:36:53] everybody's things there like I was
[03:36:54] talking
[03:36:57] about we're knocking you down because
[03:36:59] you got to get used to the
[03:37:01] boat but you all can get you all have
[03:37:06] your choice of any one of the Buffs so
[03:37:09] you can get to choose a buff of any one
[03:37:11] of them that that you
[03:37:14] want we're going to remove everybody's
[03:37:16] stuff
[03:37:39] there going update those there
[03:37:54] and everybody
[03:37:55] else is gone for their stuff except for
[03:37:58] the people that got it today so Alpha
[03:38:00] noodling has some Luke has
[03:38:03] um two strength spicy has two agility
[03:38:08] Nico has two agility into
[03:38:13] engineering you're going to take an
[03:38:14] engineering buff n is going to go with
[03:38:16] an engineering buff I like it so that
[03:38:18] brings you up to
[03:38:20] three all right Nico takes an
[03:38:22] engineering buff I like it there you go
[03:38:25] Nico we all get a crit yeah so the alien
[03:38:28] Gatling done does that buff with
[03:38:30] intelligence like the gun I currently

[03:43:53] that lingers like a bad memory each even
[03:43:58] in the
[03:43:59] still even in the sailing over the water
[03:44:01] Harbor the sun rises every morning it's
[03:44:04] crumbling Hills casting light over a
[03:44:07] place that once thrived toroia itself
[03:44:11] was spared from the worst of the bombs
[03:44:13] no directs were here but throughout the
[03:44:15] Fallout time it has taken its toll
[03:44:18] roadtown has a harbor has had become a
[03:44:21] graveyard for all these rusted ships
[03:44:22] half sunken fairies and cargo freighter
[03:44:25] laying all around the sea though still
[03:44:27] blue carried a strange Shimmer as if the
[03:44:30] water remembered the ashes it had
[03:44:32] swallowed among the record anchored far
[03:44:35] from the reach of scavengers at the end
[03:44:37] of a pier was a ship unlike any others a
[03:44:40] catamaran sleek and massive Untouched by
[03:44:42] the Decay around it
[03:44:46] and there you go that's what was found

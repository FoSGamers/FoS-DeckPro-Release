[00:02:05] and stuff like that up there um I doing
[00:02:07] something a little different here
[00:02:08] because I'm not going to be doing any
[00:02:09] type of boxes or anything like that with
[00:02:11] you guys I uh I just can't can't do that
[00:02:14] myself I'll put that away actually what
[00:02:16] I was going to do here is I actually
[00:02:17] bought those I was going to actually be
[00:02:18] opening that I opened that up and I
[00:02:19] haven't had a chance to sleeve it up so
[00:02:21] it was a slow I might have been doing
[00:02:23] that here but hey fistful hey Jay
[00:02:25] Bargains thanks coming in just uh coming
[00:02:28] in hanging out not doing too
[00:02:31] much uh we're going to do our do our
[00:02:33] adventure games we do our packs and
[00:02:36] we're also going to do our other stuff
[00:02:37] uh a new live Adventure game if you want
[00:02:39] to jump in with that now the new live
[00:02:41] Adventure game is uh something a little
[00:02:43] different all right kind of you go and
[00:02:46] you pick your packs and that helps you
[00:02:47] build a character or maybe you're a
[00:02:49] character in The Adventure and the
[00:02:50] strength or something like that the way
[00:02:52] that I like to do this here is I've
[00:02:54] actually put up all of the uh the prices
[00:02:57] of everything right there so if you do
[00:02:58] want to try the adventure game my new
[00:03:00] one now it's kind of like the other one
[00:03:01] but I haven't animated it yet all right
[00:03:04] the big difference is I'm going to
[00:03:07] run the product auction the only thing
[00:03:10] you're going to do is if you want to bid
[00:03:12] you would bid up to whatever the pack is
[00:03:15] or whatever it is you want here you can
[00:03:17] get multiples if you want to and what
[00:03:19] you would do there once you bid up to
[00:03:20] that it would be the amount extra for
[00:03:22] your strength on your character if
[00:03:23] you're going to build it right now so
[00:03:24] what we're doing at the moment is we are
[00:03:26] building our character our first
[00:03:27] character in the way Adventure here

[00:06:08] the skills there for the characters all
[00:06:11] right that's kind of how the skills
[00:06:12] would look you get to pick one you get
[00:06:14] to build those characters with your
[00:06:15] strength there so what you do is you're

[00:06:23] what we'll start our game right now so
[00:06:25] you know what the game is so where the
[00:06:27] story is going all right this is the

[00:06:35] characters and we're going to bid right

[00:06:38] do there actually you know what I'm
[00:06:40] gonna move this down that way you can
[00:06:42] see it all so it doesn't really matter
[00:06:45] it's not like I have anything you can't
[00:06:46] see right here you

[00:06:54] those two
[00:06:55] things that's what you can buy and
[00:06:57] that's how you can build your character
[00:06:58] right there all right so what you're
[00:07:00] going to do you'll build your character
[00:07:02] however you'd like Buy in to build it
[00:07:04] first person will be able to get two
[00:07:06] skill points second person does the
[00:07:08] other two skill points third person will
[00:07:10] do the third ones to build a character
[00:07:12] it's going to be the
[00:07:13] sex the type of character and then
[00:07:15] you're going to choose the name those
[00:07:17] how the three things go once those three
[00:07:19] things are done our character is going
[00:07:20] to go on a trip and this is how it
[00:07:23] begins you and your father as
[00:07:26] 15-year-old boy are wandering through
[00:07:27] the Wasteland here and as you
[00:07:30] wander in the Wasteland you see a vault
[00:07:31] you your father you wander in this Vault
[00:07:34] wonderful you see a bunch of cool stuff
[00:07:36] in here you're going to be able you're
[00:07:37] going to be able to definitely scavenge
[00:07:38] for a bunch of things that are going to
[00:07:39] help you in your life in this Wasteland
[00:07:41] so as you're going through this wa this
[00:07:43] Vault here all of a sudden a weird smell
[00:07:45] comes very pretty smell is what your dad
[00:07:48] says a pretty smell comes out of nowhere
[00:07:49] it's like wow that's interesting have a
[00:07:51] pretty smell coming where is that coming
[00:07:53] from now you can't figure out what the
[00:07:55] smell is coming from but as you're
[00:07:57] walking by there's C like Chrono
[00:08:00] Chambers is what they're called in there
[00:08:02] and there're all kinds of Frozen people
[00:08:04] but there's a few of them open and as
[00:08:05] you're going by your dad pushes you into
[00:08:08] one turns it
[00:08:12] on and says as it's turning on goes this
[00:08:16] is just for me son you're like what you
[00:08:19] get Frozen
[00:08:23] now you don't know what happens anymore
[00:08:26] the 15-year-old boy girl they whatever
[00:08:29] it is
[00:08:30] you are going to buy up to whatever pack
[00:08:32] you want there and you get to help pick
[00:08:35] out the character if you would like
[00:08:39] so we'll see what happens here see if
[00:08:42] you guys want to do anything like this I
[00:08:44] have a feeling I'm not going to be doing
[00:08:45] too much on whatnot re regularly just
[00:08:47] because I don't think this is the type
[00:08:49] of thing for you guys but hey you know
[00:08:51] what we can try it
[00:08:52] out so here we go for there for
[00:08:54] everything that you got there for your
[00:08:56] options we have set the background you
[00:08:58] are now GNA be picking your character
[00:09:00] here helping build your character for
[00:09:02] this
[00:09:04] adventure who would like to jump in and
[00:09:06] do that we're going to run that again
[00:09:07] I'll remove the skills I'll run this one
[00:09:10] more time to see if anybody wants to
[00:09:13] jump in on it and we'll see what happens
[00:09:15] if not I guess we'll uh we'll go over to
[00:09:18] uh maybe some of the other stuff that I
[00:09:19] have and see what occurs we'll run that
[00:09:23] there but we'll do this one for uh for
[00:09:26] only a minute here that way I can if
[00:09:28] anybody has any questions can explain it
[00:09:30] all
[00:09:33] right what do you mean different
[00:09:40] tiers not sure if I'm understanding the
[00:09:42] different
[00:09:48] tiers low cost low well that's why I
[00:09:51] have it the basic you start out you can
[00:09:54] just start your character and your all
[00:09:55] character always gets one to start so
[00:09:58] you're going to get two strength two two
[00:09:59] two to build for your skills but it's if
[00:10:01] you get extra that's where the that's
[00:10:03] the different tiers that you can do
[00:10:04] fistful so that's why the plus one and
[00:10:06] the plus two for the extra for the tiers
[00:10:08] because that'll help build your
[00:10:09] character for plus one if you want to
[00:10:10] build an extra tier and also when it
[00:10:12] comes to the adventure when you get into
[00:10:14] a battle you can buy in say there's a
[00:10:16] battle you know I want to buy in with a
[00:10:17] collector booster give them plus two on
[00:10:19] their health or maybe you want to throw
[00:10:21] a plus two to one of the strength or
[00:10:23] something like that that's why there's
[00:10:25] plus one and plus two there
[00:10:29] yeah yeah exactly so that's why the plus
[00:10:32] one and the plus two is there I'm sorry
[00:10:34] if that wasn't clear that gives you
[00:10:36] different tiers so those packs that you
[00:10:38] see in this tier are going to just be
[00:10:40] your regular stuff you get to play the
[00:10:42] character but if you want to give the
[00:10:43] character a
[00:10:44] boost plus one is your Boost right here
[00:10:47] for those packs if you want to give them
[00:10:49] a little extra boost depending on what
[00:10:50] they're doing that's a little plus two
[00:10:51] for whatever they're doing to give them
[00:10:53] a little action boost that's their tiers
[00:10:55] right there
[00:10:59] so yeah yeah just all you got to do is
[00:11:01] jump in buy whatever those packs you
[00:11:04] want and you can also stack them too
[00:11:07] I'll keep running this a little bit here
[00:11:08] and they're all right there available on
[00:11:09] screen you can see it then we uh we can
[00:11:12] build our character and the different
[00:11:13] thing here I'll end up doing is let me
[00:11:15] find my uh light because I forgot that
[00:11:17] over here dang
[00:11:19] it where did I move
[00:11:21] it where did I put that
[00:11:24] battery
[00:11:26] set walked out oh there it is
[00:11:33] all righty found it I moved
[00:11:37] it plugged it in charge
[00:11:42] somewhere there we go there you go
[00:11:47] wonderful so that is our little uh tiar
[00:11:50] of our game there just come on in
[00:11:53] purchase up to what you want let me put
[00:11:55] that in there let me add that in the uh
[00:11:56] in there I'll add that in say uh
[00:11:59] purchase up to what you want that way
[00:12:01] you can under
[00:12:06] it
[00:12:12] buy purchase up to what packs you
[00:12:19] want here you go we'll do that put that
[00:12:21] in the uh put that
[00:12:25] in the description here
[00:12:31] that way you can see it there help a
[00:12:35] little bit there now you're going to
[00:12:37] start this out again anyone to watch
[00:12:39] jump in try it one last time and then
[00:12:41] we'll uh we'll do something different is
[00:12:43] really what it blows down
[00:12:52] to there's always something so yeah no
[00:12:55] problem I have no problem with helping
[00:12:57] that I appreciate maybe clear on the
[00:13:00] levels of the value so what do you mean
[00:13:03] how how would I make it more clear like
[00:13:06] those ones are plus one make them like a
[00:13:09] different color would that help
[00:13:12] maybe like make the columns a different
[00:13:14] color or
[00:13:17] something here I I'll do
[00:13:20] this we'll change the column color the
[00:13:23] wording color let's do that we'll change
[00:13:26] the text color to that I'll change the
[00:13:28] text color
[00:13:33] to that no that's too bright that won't
[00:13:36] work that there you go let's try that
[00:13:40] maybe that way you can see the levels
[00:13:42] differently and you can understand and
[00:13:44] you can see them
[00:13:45] better hey Robert how you doing
[00:13:48] today doing something a little different
[00:13:50] here playing a little uh Adventure game
[00:13:54] doing it's a it's actually the full live
[00:13:55] uh we're go through like kind of a
[00:13:56] little D and D Adventure the entire time
[00:13:58] and it's going to be you guys will help
[00:13:59] us depending on what we buying into if
[00:14:02] we can get through the
[00:14:07] adventure condense the
[00:14:10] spreadsheet here all right can't see it
[00:14:13] condense it I like it I can do that see
[00:14:16] that's one of those things I don't
[00:14:17] always understand because I don't see it
[00:14:18] on their screens so give me one second
[00:14:20] and I will do that ah thank you I can do
[00:14:25] that and condense
[00:14:27] it I hate how it doesn't show the same
[00:14:30] on every
[00:14:32] screen that does frustrate me a lot
[00:14:36] here all right let me do
[00:14:40] this all
[00:14:46] right and I will
[00:14:56] uh okay that then I'm going to condense
[00:15:00] it let me check oh I wonder hold on a
[00:15:03] second I keep forgetting I have a new
[00:15:05] camera and I can use my phone
[00:15:08] now okay thank you I always forget I
[00:15:11] have a new camera and I can use my phone
[00:15:13] now give me one second here
[00:15:30] all right one minute here there we go
[00:15:33] give me a second
[00:15:35] here ah I see what you're talking about
[00:15:38] all right thank you you can't even see
[00:15:39] much of me either all right here we go
[00:15:41] we're GNA do
[00:15:43] this you can see on the sides we can see
[00:15:45] the beer can see the
[00:15:48] cards well I hate how it does that on
[00:15:50] some scens it doesn't on others let's do
[00:15:53] that we'll shrink it down a little
[00:15:56] bit no all right all right I see
[00:16:14] that's stinks that had that that there
[00:16:16] we
[00:16:21] go
[00:16:24] there now I think you can see
[00:16:27] everything all right you should be able
[00:16:29] to see everything
[00:16:30] now all right
[00:16:33] there then I'm bet I'm betting you're
[00:16:36] having a hard time seeing this
[00:16:40] too I'm betting you're having a really
[00:16:42] hard time seeing that
[00:16:45] too actually that's not too bad you can
[00:16:47] actually kind of read that
[00:16:55] one you can actually almost read that
[00:16:57] one
[00:17:00] we're going to shrink it down and we'll
[00:17:01] make it a little bit
[00:17:03] better we'll do it a little bit better
[00:17:08] anyways so you can see actually
[00:17:12] everything do that shrink that over
[00:17:16] we'll do that
[00:17:20] again move it
[00:17:26] down there should be able to see
[00:17:29] everything
[00:17:32] now stinks that stinks how it does that
[00:17:35] it's hard for me to realize what it does
[00:17:36] that when on different phones it's like
[00:17:38] one of those things that's weird like
[00:17:39] some of them work some of them
[00:17:41] don't well there you
[00:17:43] go perfect you can now see it
[00:17:47] all there there and you have color and
[00:17:50] everything to differentiate look at that
[00:17:54] color and everything
[00:17:57] perfect so let's run this now that you
[00:18:00] can see
[00:18:02] it I didn't realize you couldn't see it
[00:18:05] before there you go now you should be
[00:18:07] able to see it we'll do it for a minute
[00:18:09] and a half but what it is you just kind
[00:18:11] of just buy up to what you want really
[00:18:13] what it
[00:18:14] is the wonders of
[00:18:17] technology and once you have purchased
[00:18:19] up to what you want what we'll do is
[00:18:22] uh we'll run and uh we'll start our
[00:18:26] character building here for you all you
[00:18:28] all get to jump in and build a character
[00:18:30] and that's the whole point of this
[00:18:31] adventure you build our first character
[00:18:34] here you get his name it's now been in
[00:18:37] the cryo chamber the cryo chamber all of
[00:18:41] a sudden lights start flickering in this
[00:18:44] uh this uh shelter Wasteland shelter the
[00:18:49] lights are flickering the Wasteland
[00:18:50] shelter you looking nothing really is
[00:18:52] going on and it's just the setting the
[00:18:54] background then all of a sudden the
[00:18:56] power and all the uh machines cryos
[00:18:59] shamers start to flicker most of them
[00:19:01] start to die out since they've been all
[00:19:02] on running for years and nothing happens
[00:19:04] they all die because they've been
[00:19:05] opening hundreds of years but one the
[00:19:08] one that had the son for whatever reason
[00:19:12] it didn't work exactly right he grew up
[00:19:15] and got
[00:19:16] older and older and older it's
[00:19:20] been about 15 plus years later he's an
[00:19:23] adult now doesn't realize
[00:19:25] it just kind of looks at his hands and
[00:19:27] he realize he's kind of hands with
[00:19:28] different and his body looks
[00:19:31] different as the chamber opens she can't
[00:19:34] get open chamber because it's kind of
[00:19:35] stuck he has to push it open he opens
[00:19:37] that chamber or she or they or whatever
[00:19:40] it is opens the chamber and steps out
[00:19:44] what are you going to be for your
[00:19:45] character you get to choose what every
[00:19:47] one you want you can bid up to whatever
[00:19:49] you like there so if you want like a wow
[00:19:52] you build that if you want to build up
[00:19:53] to something else you build build up to
[00:19:54] that that's what we do hey Mike thanks
[00:19:57] for coming in buddy I do appreciate that
[00:19:59] what one are you going to go with I
[00:20:00] think it is
[00:20:04] uh I think you have the options of
[00:20:09] uh wild draft is what it is alrighty
[00:20:13] wild
[00:20:14] draft all right here's our wild draft
[00:20:16] and now when you build your character
[00:20:19] here what we'll do here is when you
[00:20:21] build that character the cool thing is
[00:20:23] if you happen to get a Mythic out of
[00:20:25] this pack when we open it you actually
[00:20:26] get an extra plus one when comes to a
[00:20:29] draft for your character to build it
[00:20:31] little luck to the bonus of the building
[00:20:32] the character so here we go we're going
[00:20:34] to rip open this pack here if that's
[00:20:36] okay with Mike I'm guessing that's what

[01:16:59] again all you would do is bid up to it
[01:17:01] if you want to bid more hey cookie if
[01:17:04] you want to bid more you just would
[01:17:06] click on custom bid and you would say
[01:17:08] there's an option on the bottom that
[01:17:10] says like unchecks it it would just bid
[01:17:11] all the way up to it that's what you
[01:17:13] would do and you would also slide over
[01:17:15] too you can also slide over to bid more
[01:17:19] so if you want something else Cookie
[01:17:20] Mama this is what I'm going to do here

[02:06:19] what they got
[02:06:27] now you have two rolls too because you
[02:06:28] have luck and you also have leather
[02:06:30] pants on so you have three rolls because
[02:06:32] you have leather pants on for extra
[02:06:37] luck and it's one to one through five to
[02:06:41] haggle
[02:06:44] them you have an extra roll now because
[02:06:46] you have the luck for your leather pants
[02:06:48] CU leather pants are sexy and you're
[02:06:50] always Lucky in SE when you're sexy all
[02:06:52] right you're going to try to haggle
[02:06:53] let's do it let's see what happens you

[02:06:57] revolver is worth three he looks at you
[02:06:59] goes come on dude seriously roll an 18

[02:07:05] get the rust off of it so you know it's
[02:07:06] only gonna be a little bit of time
[02:07:07] definitely worth
[02:07:09] three and he looks at and goes H you
[02:07:11] know what dude if you get I'm getting
[02:07:13] this not worth three it's Rusty you're
[02:07:15] lucky I'm giving you anything for it all
[02:07:18] right he goes all right fine do you want
[02:07:20] to haggle one more more
[02:07:22] time or do you want to just try to buy
[02:07:26] from him now well he's not completely
[02:07:28] annoyed yet he's just a little
[02:07:31] bit you have the chance to haggle one
[02:07:33] more time and see if you get a one to
[02:07:36] five you have not haggled successfully
[02:07:42] yet you're going to take the cap all
[02:07:44] right you take the one
[02:07:46] capap and he goes all right you want
[02:07:48] anything of
[02:07:49] mine I got that
[02:07:52] there for five for assist and one bullet
[02:07:55] one one POG per
[02:07:57] bullet what would you like to
[02:08:10] do all right you're gonna go for that
[02:08:12] long sword now you're gon to use any of
[02:08:13] your mythics for it to bring down the
[02:08:17] price because you got two of them
[02:08:19] remember you have two mythics you can
[02:08:21] use bring down the
[02:08:23] price cuz that's what happens when the
[02:08:25] encounter is when you have
[02:08:29] extra well no actually you have four
[02:08:32] because you have you have four because
[02:08:33] you also have the setep boosters so you
[02:08:35] have four to bring it down I'm lying I
[02:08:37] forgot about there were sat boosters
[02:08:38] that's four to bring it
[02:08:41] down so that long sword is actually only
[02:08:43] going to be one if you use everything
[02:08:56] or a Tac pistol or Tupac pistol
[02:09:05] correct or a Tupac pistol that is
[02:09:14] correct what are you gonna do vicus oh
[02:09:18] it's a hard decision here pistol long
[02:09:22] sword you said long sword I forgot about
[02:09:24] it Bringing Down the four so I'm going
[02:09:25] to give you a minute there cuz I forgot
[02:09:27] you got the two setep boosters on top of
[02:09:29] the mythics so you do have
[02:09:32] four so you're G to go the long sword
[02:09:34] for
[02:09:36] one all right cool I like it I like it
[02:09:39] William a pet all right I like it we're
[02:09:40] gonna try that out later the pet is God
[02:09:43] so long sword for one is
[02:09:46] Godzilla no ammo you don't need to worry
[02:09:48] about Ammo exactly you don't need to
[02:09:50] worry about that's a good thought good
[02:09:52] thought process vicus so it's going to
[02:09:54] be one POG it's your
[02:09:59] choice oh you do have a short sword to
[02:10:01] trade that's
[02:10:08] true you don't need two swords nope
[02:10:11] don't need two
[02:10:15] swords don't need two swords
[02:10:19] no I mean you could try to use two
[02:10:21] swords if you want but one being a long
[02:10:23] sword isn't going to work well maybe if
[02:10:26] you had two short swords but you only
[02:10:28] have a long sword it has to use both
[02:10:40] hands all right we're gonna get the long
[02:10:42] we're GNA get the long sword for one all
[02:10:44] right go ahead I'm gonna take that long
[02:10:46] sword not wonderful so you now have that
[02:10:48] long sword and go hey you know what
[02:10:50] since I have your long sword this short
[02:10:51] sword here and you show it to him he
[02:10:52] goes e it's not too bad I could sharpen
[02:10:55] that baby up not bad there I think
[02:10:57] that's worth
[02:11:00] um
[02:11:03] that's that's three that's three I can
[02:11:06] do three for that one now we're gonna do

[02:11:12] you do a one haggle you have one haggle
[02:11:13] left or would you just like to try and

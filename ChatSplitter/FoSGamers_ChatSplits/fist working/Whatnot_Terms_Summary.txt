Look at Whatnot.com's Terms of Service and make sure you are thoroughly clear on everything related to trading card deems, gambling, pull boxes, mystery boxes, or anything like that where a box breaks, and that type of stuff. Make sure you are thoroughly clear on everything with regards to the rules, dig 100 pages in to the Whatnot Terms of Service, read each line of the Whatnot Terms of Service, line by line, then go back and start over and do it again. Each line of every page of the Whatnot Terms of Service. That way you are 100% clear on everything in it. I need you to be thoroughly clear on the trading card deems rules and everything related to gambling and everything I've discussed with you here. That is the primary purpose of this because I need to be able to tell you something in regards to a game or an item or a thing I want to sell and I need you to help me to make sure it is within the Whatnot Terms of Service. So I need you to be 100% clear without even questioning what you could possibly know. Do all of that and then do that 1 million times again.

Now, make sure you understand everything related to giveaways and the rules related to giveaways for sellers on there and everything how they have to do it. Because I want to make sure that if I tell you the way I want to do a giveaway that I am clear with it and that I'm not going to get in any trouble with any of the rules.

[2024-07-31 18:36:45] FoSGamers:
What I would like to do for a giveaway is have it be where there are two items on the screen or in view for the person to choose from. An item 1 or an item 2. They always will get item 1 unless they respond and tell us if they want item 2 or item 1 over item 2. But we always start with item 1 as the primary thing given to them if there is no response. They always will get item 1. But if they happen to respond and say they want item 2 over item 1, we'll give them item 2. But if they don't say anything, they'll get item 1. Either way, they always get the one item that's there as item 1. Now, I don't know if I can word it differently so it'll be within terms of service, but figure that out. And make it so that I can do that or be like A and B, you know, that type of thing. Whatever you need to make it so that this would work within terms of service or that my idea is acceptable.

[2024-07-31 18:36:58] ChatGPT:
To implement your giveaway idea within Whatnot's terms of service, you need to ensure the following:

### Key Guidelines for Your Giveaway Plan

1. **Clear Disclosure**:
   - Clearly state that participants will receive "Item 1" by default unless they specify that they want "Item 2." This information must be disclosed upfront in the giveaway rules and in the livestream.

2. **No Purchase Necessary**:
   - Ensure there is a free method of entry (AMOE) available for participants. This can be a web form or other non-purchase method as required by Whatnot's policies and legal regulations【16†source】【17†source】.

3. **Transparency and Fairness**:
   - The choice between "Item 1" and "Item 2" must be fair and transparent. Participants must understand their options and the default item they will receive if no response is given.
   - Ensure there is no favoritism or alteration of the prize based on the winner’s identity or actions outside of the stated choice between "Item 1" and "Item 2"【16†source】.

4. **Shipping and Fulfillment**:
   - Ship the chosen item (either "Item 1" or "Item 2") promptly within Whatnot's standard shipping timeframe, covering all shipping costs as specified in the guidelines【16†source】【17†source】.

### Example Implementation Plan

1. **Giveaway Announcement**:
   - In your livestream and listing description, clearly state:
     - "Participants will receive Item 1 by default unless they respond within [specific time frame] to choose Item 2."
     - "No purchase necessary to enter. A free method of entry is available via [provide AMOE details]."

2. **Giveaway Rules**:
   - Add detailed rules to the giveaway description:

     - "If the winner responds within [specific time frame] stating they prefer Item 2, they will receive Item 2 instead."
     - "Failure to respond will result in receiving Item 1."
     - "The giveaway is open to all eligible participants, with no purchase necessary. Free entry available at [AMOE link]."
     - "Giveaway complies with all applicable laws and Whatnot’s terms of service."

3. **Live Interaction**:
   - During the livestream, reiterate the rules before and during the giveaway:
     - "The default prize is Item 1. If you win and want Item 2, please respond in the chat within [specific time frame] stating 'I choose Item 2'. If we do not hear from you, you will receive Item 1."

### Additional Considerations

By following these steps, you can structure your giveaway in a way that complies with Whatnot's guidelines and legal requirements, ensuring a smooth and fair process for all participants.

[2024-07-31 18:39:48] FoSGamers:
Now, the next thing I want you to make sure will be acceptable is the first item will be something that will be worth potentially a penny to fifty cents or even maybe at the most up to a dollar. Generally, it's going to be around a penny to ten cents or less. The second item might be worth anywhere from, you know, three dollars to fifty dollars depending on what I'm giving away. Is that acceptable?

[2024-07-31 18:40:05] ChatGPT:
To ensure your giveaway plan is acceptable according to Whatnot's guidelines, we need to address a few key considerations regarding the value of the items.

### Item Values and Giveaway Rules

1. **Disclosure and Transparency**:
   - Clearly disclose the value ranges of both items in the giveaway description. Transparency about what the participants can expect to win is crucial to comply with Whatnot’s guidelines and prevent misleading participants【16†source】【17†source】.

2. **Fairness in Item Value**:
   - The large disparity in value between the two items is acceptable as long as it is clearly communicated and participants understand the choice they are making. This includes specifying that "Item 1" is of lower value (e.g., $0.01 to $1.00) and "Item 2" is of higher value (e.g., $3.00 to $50.00)【16†source】【17†source】.

3. **No Misleading or Inflating Values**:
   - Ensure you do not mislead participants about the potential value of either item. Any mention of the item values must be backed up with real market data if required by participants【9†source】【16†source】.

### Example Implementation Plan

1. **Giveaway Announcement**:
   - Clearly state in the giveaway description:
     - "Item 1 is a low-value item, generally worth between $0.01 and $1.00."
     - "Item 2 is a higher-value item, worth between $3.00 and $50.00."

2. **Giveaway Rules**:
   - Include detailed rules in the giveaway description:
     - "Participants will receive Item 1 by default unless they respond within [specific time frame] to choose Item 2."
     - "Item 1's value ranges from $0.01 to $1.00."
     - "Item 2's value ranges from $3.00 to $50.00."
     - "No purchase necessary to enter. Free entry available via [AMOE link]."
     - "Giveaway complies with all applicable laws and Whatnot’s terms of service."

3. **Live Interaction**:
   - During the livestream, reiterate the rules and values before and during the giveaway:
     - "The default prize is Item 1, valued between $0.01 and $1.00. If you win and want Item 2, valued between $3.00 and $50.00, please respond in the chat within [specific time frame] stating 'I choose Item 2'. If we do not hear from you, you will receive Item 1."

### Summary

- **Transparency**: Clearly disclose the value ranges of both items.
- **Fairness**: Ensure participants understand their options and the value of each item.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to Whatnot’s guidelines and legal requirements for giveaways.

This approach ensures your giveaway plan is within Whatnot’s terms of service and provides a clear, fair, and transparent experience for participants.

[2024-07-31 18:41:23] FoSGamers:
I'm never going to state the value of either of the items. I will know what the value of them are. I will just say, you're going to get the choice of this item 1 or A, whatever I say it is, and it is going to be this card, which will be a single card from Magic the Gathering that is worth very little. Like I said, the penny to ten cents, at the most a dollar area. Then the other one would be generally a pack of cards or a card that is worth more. I'm going to say this card or this pack is item 2. I'll never say the value of anything. I'll just say what each one item is. Is that acceptable?

[2024-07-31 18:41:37] ChatGPT:
Your approach to not stating the value of the items directly and simply presenting them as choices (Item 1 or Item 2) without mentioning their market value is acceptable within Whatnot's guidelines, provided you adhere to transparency and fairness principles. Here's how you can structure your giveaway to ensure compliance:

### Key Points for Compliance

1. **Transparency in Description**:
   - Clearly describe what each item is without mentioning their value.
   - Ensure participants understand that they have a choice between two items, where Item 1 is the default unless they specify otherwise.

2. **No Misleading Information**:
   - Avoid any implications or suggestions about the potential value of the items unless directly asked, in which case, provide factual data if needed.
   - Ensure that the participants know they will receive one of the two items based on their response.

3. **Fair Process**:
   - Maintain a fair and transparent process where all participants have an equal opportunity to choose between the items.
   - Follow the standard guidelines for shipping and fulfilling the giveaway items within Whatnot's timeframe.

### Example Giveaway Description

1. **Giveaway Announcement**:
   - In your livestream and listing description, state:
     - "You have a choice between Item 1 and Item 2. If you do not respond within [specific time frame], you will receive Item 1 by default."

2. **Giveaway Rules**:
   - Include detailed rules in the giveaway description:
     - "Item 1 is [describe the card, e.g., a single Magic: The Gathering card]."

     - "No purchase necessary to enter. Free entry available via [AMOE link]."
     - "Giveaway complies with all applicable laws and Whatnot’s terms of service."

3. **Live Interaction**:
   - During the livestream, reiterate the rules and description of the items:
     - "The default prize is Item 1, which is [describe the card]. If you win and want Item 2, which is [describe the pack/card], please respond in the chat within [specific time frame] stating 'I choose Item 2'. If we do not hear from you, you will receive Item 1."

### Example Script for Giveaway

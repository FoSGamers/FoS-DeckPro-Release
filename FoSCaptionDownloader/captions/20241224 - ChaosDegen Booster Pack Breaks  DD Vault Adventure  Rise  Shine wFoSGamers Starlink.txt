[00:00:00] should be going everywhere else
[00:00:01] now. Yes, it is. Hopefully Ray has a
[00:00:05] good one this morning. Hey DK Gonzo,
[00:00:07] thanks for coming in. Hey, this is our
[00:00:08] view right now. A little bit of relaxing
[00:00:10] in the morning here. Kind of see the sun
[00:00:12] uh already rising up there. We might
[00:00:15] have to start out earlier if you guys
[00:00:17] want to see
[00:00:19] that.
[00:00:22] But here we go. I think we're good
[00:00:25] here. We're good there. We're good
[00:00:28] there.
[00:00:34] Perfect. Crown Bay as well. Nice.
[00:00:36] Perfecto. We got to find a place to drop
[00:00:38] our trash off. How's everyone doing this
[00:00:41] morning? You having a good
[00:00:47] one? Hopefully you're having some fun
[00:00:50] this morning. So, what I have right now,
[00:00:53] we do have some packs we can open up. My
[00:00:55] kids had picked some couple things out
[00:00:56] here this wonderful morning and we had
[00:00:58] some
[00:00:59] fun. Um, so yeah, we'll see what's going
[00:01:02] on. We got it starting up here. I think
[00:01:04] we have everything running.
[00:01:07] Should be nice there. Relaxing. Hey,
[00:01:09] spicy null punk. How's it going today?
[00:01:12] We only have two spots in our overlord
[00:01:14] of the hunt. Woods break. Figured. Here
[00:01:16] you go. You guys can uh I put that away
[00:01:17] and you can see everything here. Nice. I
[00:01:19] made a little bit of a change in how I'm
[00:01:21] doing some of this. I tried to make it a
[00:01:23] little
[00:01:24] um the angle of it is a little
[00:01:26] different. Now, if you can see
[00:01:32] here so that
[00:01:35] hopefully the angle here is a little
[00:01:37] better for all of you to see. I was
[00:01:39] hoping it would be right here. And then
[00:01:40] it also allows me to put some extra
[00:01:42] stuff up. Living the life. I know,
[00:01:44] stinking. Thank you, buddy. Hey, how's
[00:01:46] the family going? But hey, I'll throw
[00:01:47] the camera back on. Why not? Good
[00:01:48] morning. You get to see that sun rise up
[00:01:50] right there. Look at that rise and
[00:01:52] shine. Sun's coming right up there.
[00:01:54] Coming in earlier. Yeah, it's Oh, we
[00:01:56] missed it a little while ago. I know. A
[00:01:58] while ago. Little while ago. Good
[00:02:00] morning, Spicy. Good morning. How's it
[00:02:01] going, my friends? Hope you're all
[00:02:03] having a good morning. Just starting the
[00:02:05] day off. We'll get some packs opened
[00:02:07] here. But that was a nice looking site
[00:02:09] right there. We are not docked. Um, that
[00:02:12] was probably coffee at some point, I'm
[00:02:14] guessing. Oh, water. I don't know. Um,
[00:02:17] we are currently at moing. We are in a
[00:02:20] moing in uh an island down here in St.
[00:02:24] Thomas, I think. Yep, St. Thomas. I
[00:02:26] don't know exactly. Can't remember the
[00:02:27] exact We're in Long Bay. Our Long Bay.
[00:02:30] There we go. We're in Long Bay here.
[00:02:32] Then we'll uh start going heading out
[00:02:33] after probably Christmas over back
[00:02:35] homeish depending on what we can do for
[00:02:37] solar and things. But how's it going,
[00:02:39] Ray? How's it going, my friend? Hope
[00:02:41] you're having a good one. Yeah, we have
[00:02:43] uh we have a warehouse in Miami that I'm
[00:02:44] working I'm like finalizing. So, we'll
[00:02:47] have to do we'll be able to do some
[00:02:49] warehouse deals for you guys. And then
[00:02:51] also the stuff from here will always be
[00:02:53] dropped shipped over to them, which they
[00:02:54] will drop shipped to you guys every uh
[00:02:57] like I said, it'll be like maybe a week
[00:02:58] or so later than normal. One to two
[00:03:00] weeks. That's why I said give it a one
[00:03:01] to two weeks for this first one. And
[00:03:03] then the next one, next time it'll be a
[00:03:05] little better off, I think. Oh,
[00:03:08] what? You're right. Hopefully,
[00:03:12] the camera just fell. I don't like that
[00:03:14] camera being like that.
[00:03:17] Well, there's no I have I have no other
[00:03:19] option, Steph, other than using this.
[00:03:21] Ooh, do we have an elastic that I can
[00:03:23] put around? You have elastics down
[00:03:25] there? Yes, the purple elastics down
[00:03:26] there. Can you grab them in the in the
[00:03:29] um in my the up thing for the desk
[00:03:33] underneath that? That wasn't good.
[00:03:36] You're a Bing fan. Ah, yes. We're um
[00:03:41] we're doing some magic stuff here. That
[00:03:43] wasn't good. I dropped the camera.
[00:03:45] Let's not do that again. Okay, now we
[00:03:47] know.
[00:03:53] Let's not do that again. Let's hold that
[00:03:55] in place a little
[00:03:57] better. And then let's also do this.
[00:04:00] That way we can adjust our camera angle
[00:04:02] for all you to see
[00:04:06] [Music]
[00:04:08] better. Here. Ah.
[00:04:15] Zoom
[00:04:20] out. Ah, I have to play with the camera
[00:04:23] now.
[00:04:24] Maybe. Hold on, guys. Sorry about that.
[00:04:27] Give me one second
[00:04:30] here. Adjust some
[00:04:34] uh autofocus.
[00:04:42] Oh no. What's going on?
[00:04:50] Oh, focus. It's weird. It's like not
[00:04:53] out. It's just focusing here instead of
[00:04:56] over
[00:04:58] there. See, need to get the uh like
[00:05:03] autofocus on here. Probably hit a
[00:05:06] setting somewhere. What are you looking
[00:05:08] for?
[00:05:10] Can you
[00:05:12] wait? I don't have anything clean up
[00:05:15] right here. So, give me a minute. Okay.
[00:05:18] Wait.
[00:05:21] No, we want that. Auto.
[00:05:24] Auto.
[00:05:27] Auto.
[00:05:34] There you go.
[00:05:37] That auto too.
[00:05:39] probably pressed a button here. Hold on
[00:05:41] a second,
[00:05:42] everyone. We're going to do this. This
[00:05:44] is what I'm thinking I
[00:05:49] did. Autofocus
[00:05:53] on. There we go. Sorry,
[00:05:57] everyone. That was a bad That was a bad
[00:05:59] one.
[00:06:02] That was a bad one. The camera fell. We
[00:06:04] don't have it set up right here cuz the
[00:06:06] way the um
[00:06:08] stuff is. There we go. That's not
[00:06:10] bad. I can zoom in better on it all.
[00:06:20] That's better.
[00:06:30] Yeah, that's how it's been the entire
[00:06:32] time.
[00:06:38] Sorry guys, give me one second here.
[00:06:40] Just got to focus the camera so we can
[00:06:43] have a better
[00:06:49] view. Now it won't.
[00:06:52] All right, we're here to go. We're going
[00:06:53] to do one thing quickly. I'm going to
[00:06:54] turn it off and back on.
[00:07:00] [Music]
[00:07:17] [Music]
[00:07:25] [Music]
[00:07:30] that back in place. So, I do not have my
[00:07:32] regular correct camera stuff, which kind
[00:07:35] of sinks because of the traveling
[00:07:38] scenario, but we'll figure this out here
[00:07:40] for a second. Ah, there we go. That's
[00:07:42] better. We got it. Yeah, we figured it
[00:07:45] out. I knew I could. Yeah, that boat
[00:07:48] stability thing. It takes a little bit
[00:07:49] to get used to.
[00:07:53] Okay.
[00:07:55] [Music]
[00:07:57] That's eggy.
[00:08:00] [Music]
[00:08:02] No. Why is that? Oh,
[00:08:05] there. That's weird.
[00:08:12] Well, there we go. Anyways, yeah, the
[00:08:14] boat stability thing's an issue here
[00:08:16] sometimes. I don't know why I can't read
[00:08:18] that all now. Oh my god, we got issues
[00:08:21] all over the place. You doing that to me
[00:08:25] streaming?
[00:08:29] Close.
[00:08:31] Close.
[00:08:33] Close.
[00:08:34] Okay, let's find
[00:08:38] Doc. Put that pick there. That pic
[00:08:41] there.
[00:08:43] There we
[00:08:44] go. Ah, now I should see all the chats
[00:08:47] there.
[00:08:51] Yeah, MTG and dolphins.
[00:08:55] I know you got to give me Sorry, guys.
[00:08:56] There was a second there being a pain in
[00:08:58] the bum with the I dropped the camera.
[00:09:00] Hopefully you all can hear me still.
[00:09:03] Okay, the sun is directly coming in my
[00:09:06] eyes now. Wait
[00:09:09] until I know. Wait until the door is
[00:09:11] clean. Yeah, I know.
[00:09:14] Really rude, actually.
[00:09:19] There we go. I think this is good. We're
[00:09:22] all the dolphin. Yeah, I'm not in
[00:09:25] arena. Yeah, it is affecting the
[00:09:27] facility here a little bit, but hey, we
[00:09:29] got I think I got it under control now.
[00:09:30] I think I got under control now. We're
[00:09:33] good. Sorry, I was ignoring everyone for
[00:09:34] a minute. We're good. I think let's do
[00:09:38] uh there you can see the Let's see some
[00:09:40] background for a sec. I'm going to take
[00:09:42] a drink.
[00:09:48] And
[00:09:50] then we'll open a pack here. I think we
[00:09:53] um have a couple spots left in Wills
[00:09:56] Break. Now Will's break so that
[00:09:58] everybody is
[00:09:59] aware is this
[00:10:04] here. This is Wills. All right. He
[00:10:07] picked out Modern Horizon, Mystery,
[00:10:10] Commander Masters, Time Spiral, Legends,
[00:10:12] and that I believe that is Will's one
[00:10:14] right there. Let me double
[00:10:21] check. Modern Horizon 3.
[00:10:25] I would not do as much. Mystery Booster
[00:10:27] 2, Die Spiral, and Holiday. Oh, no.
[00:10:31] That's not the right one. So, where do
[00:10:33] you think I'm going to get stuff?
[00:10:36] Commander Masters
[00:10:37] draft. Oh, Legends is not there. That
[00:10:40] wasn't it. That's over here with this
[00:10:41] one. Ah, no. CMR
[00:10:44] draft. There's the one that's there. We
[00:10:46] got We don't have the masters. Why don't
[00:10:48] there a masters there? That's weird. We
[00:10:50] have these
[00:10:51] ones. One, two, three, four, five. And
[00:10:55] the other one was right here. No,
[00:10:58] there's one there. Where did I put that
[00:11:01] one? Just over here a second ago from
[00:11:02] things moving around. And I didn't like
[00:11:04] how they were flopping around. So I
[00:11:05] moved it. Yes, you guys can do that.
[00:11:07] There's that one. One, Dustor, Modern
[00:11:11] Horizon 3, Mystery Booster 2, Time
[00:11:13] Spiral, Commander, Legends, Draft, and a
[00:11:15] Foundations. That is Will's break that
[00:11:17] we have left. This is um the other stuff
[00:11:22] that we have. That's two of those are
[00:11:24] left there. So if we want to do that, we
[00:11:25] get to do some adventuring.
[00:11:28] See what goes on with our characters.
[00:11:29] Now we got animations to go with our
[00:11:30] characters, which is kind of fun.
[00:11:33] which is kind of fun. I think I don't
[00:11:34] know about you. I think that's fun.
[00:11:36] Maybe you want to have uh maybe you'll
[00:11:38] go and meet one of the new assistant
[00:11:40] characters here. Yes. I don't know. Will
[00:11:44] said yeah. He goes, "Yes, I made that
[00:11:46] up." But right now, what I'll do is I'm
[00:11:49] going to open one of the packs that Will
[00:11:50] gave us. I'm actually going to start out
[00:11:52] with this one cuz I haven't had a
[00:11:54] sorcerer giving us for a while. He said
[00:11:56] we should open this up today. I have a
[00:11:58] couple packs from them. We like to open
[00:11:59] some things up to that way we can add to
[00:12:01] our our singles and things like that for
[00:12:03] you guys to potentially have. This one
[00:12:05] we're going to do here is going to be a
[00:12:07] uh
[00:12:09] booster for sorcery right now of beta.
[00:12:13] So, we have some beta. Hope you're all
[00:12:15] having a good morning and we're going to
[00:12:17] see what we get out of this pack.
[00:12:19] Remember everybody, we have that those
[00:12:20] available. We can do any of the if you
[00:12:22] want the virtual pull boxes too. We can
[00:12:23] do one, two, three, four. Oh, we got a
[00:12:28] uh we have a avatar there. We got an
[00:12:33] avatar at least. All right, so here we
[00:12:35] go. Let's zoom in
[00:12:39] now. Oop, that's too
[00:12:44] much. Do they have any tournaments where
[00:12:46] they play original for a series for
[00:12:48] sorcery? Yes, they do do tournaments
[00:12:50] like that. There was one recently. Um I
[00:12:52] can't remember. I think it was in Vegas.
[00:12:53] All right. You have the
[00:12:55] Noas Azeridge
[00:12:57] Caravan Lightning Bolt, Blood Ravens,
[00:13:03] Firebolt,
[00:13:05] Sacred
[00:13:06] Scarabs, Scent Hounds,
[00:13:09] Polar Bears, Porcupine, Pufferfish,
[00:13:13] Trojan
[00:13:15] Calvary, Swamp Buffalo. Ooh, that's what
[00:13:18] it was. A little spark mage for you for
[00:13:20] that um for the Avatar. Not bad. We got
[00:13:23] our uh rolling boulder, their version of
[00:13:26] Indiana Jones. We have a drought for the
[00:13:29] second second exceptional.
[00:13:31] Then Wildfire for the third exceptional.
[00:13:34] And ooh, Lord of the Void. Well, that's
[00:13:37] a nice beta hit right there for Sorcery.
[00:13:41] There we go. I had a handful of packs
[00:13:43] there. I didn't have a ton of them, so
[00:13:44] that's why we only have a handful of
[00:13:45] things we can open here. We can't do it
[00:13:47] all very regularly where we're just
[00:13:49] pounding through them. But we have some
[00:13:50] more. That was a nice one right there.
[00:13:52] Now, if anybody else would like to jump
[00:13:54] in. We do have some fun things we're
[00:13:55] doing today. We're hanging out on the
[00:13:57] boat here. I'm going to throw this one
[00:13:58] up here while I get our pack organized
[00:14:00] and put away. You can see my view while
[00:14:02] I put away our singles. That way,
[00:14:05] they're all protected. And I want to get
[00:14:06] that in a top loader cuz that was a nice
[00:14:08] pickup of that Lord of the Void there.
[00:14:10] For those of you who know, um, Sorcery,
[00:14:12] that's a nice one
[00:14:13] there. What do you think of the music so
[00:14:15] far for the background there? Good? Bad?
[00:14:19] Did some relaxing background music kind
[00:14:22] of thing. I don't know if it works.
[00:14:23] Good. Good. All right. Digging the funky
[00:14:26] beats. I don't know what the funky beats
[00:14:28] are. They came in differently cuz I'm
[00:14:31] not used to those. They I guess if
[00:14:32] they're funky, I'm not I'm not aware
[00:14:34] what those funky beats are. But here,
[00:14:37] maybe we'll do um Nobody wants to do
[00:14:39] that
[00:14:40] one. So, no, that's there. So, I'm going
[00:14:43] to pin Nolan Wills Break, which is the
[00:14:45] only one with two spots left. That's
[00:14:47] $18. And there's only two spots left in
[00:14:49] that one. Yep. Hey, it's uh it's
[00:14:53] royaltyfree music here. We we had to
[00:14:56] have in the background so I have to
[00:14:57] worry about getting in trouble on
[00:14:58] anything. So, what I think I'm going to
[00:15:00] do is we'll open this one up. And that's
[00:15:02] our background. I have another pack
[00:15:03] we'll open. But I think I'm going to
[00:15:04] find something for a giveaway for you
[00:15:06] guys cuz I know I have them over here.
[00:15:09] Where do I put them? One, two, three,
[00:15:11] four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. All
[00:15:13] right. We got to find another card to
[00:15:16] put in.
[00:15:18] You know what? Since we just opened some
[00:15:20] sorcery, I'm going to put a sorcery beta
[00:15:22] card in there. You know what? That's
[00:15:25] what I'm actually going to do. We're
[00:15:25] going to add a sorcery beta card in
[00:15:27] there for our giveaway potential, which
[00:15:29] is nice. And then we'll add uh yacht
[00:15:32] rock. Oh, I don't know. I might have
[00:15:34] some yacht rock. Uh let's see if we can
[00:15:35] find uh yacht rock that is um that is
[00:15:40] royaltyfree.
[00:15:49] No said which would give you uh the
[00:15:52] choice of Oh, so I had
[00:15:57] I have yacht rock. Yacht rock. No, no, I
[00:16:00] don't have anything royaltyree coming
[00:16:01] from from here for uh
[00:16:06] for um Spotify, which is what I use. I
[00:16:09] got to make sure I have something
[00:16:09] royaltyree, so it shut me down.
[00:16:12] We have uh royalty-free radio. I like to
[00:16:15] try that. Let's see what that is.
[00:16:20] Throw that out there. Let's see that.
[00:16:22] Try it a little different.
[00:16:25] [Music]
[00:16:30] All right. That's what it I'm starting
[00:16:32] it out there. You guys got to let me
[00:16:33] know if you like it or not. The the
[00:16:35] adjustment to the royalty-free radio
[00:16:39] dive. No, not in the arbor here. That's
[00:16:41] we're going to be doing that in uh and
[00:16:43] we we like probably have to do some more
[00:16:46] errands today to get a few last things
[00:16:48] and then we'll have to do um then we'll
[00:16:52] probably stay here and then the day
[00:16:53] after Christmas we'll probably pull up
[00:16:55] and go anchor somewhere and uh see what
[00:16:57] we can do there. But we're going to open
[00:16:58] up our
[00:17:00] pack that we had and I'm going to throw
[00:17:02] up one for a giveaway like I was talking
[00:17:03] about. We'll do one. Why not? No, we
[00:17:05] haven't dove off the boat. Not in the
[00:17:06] not in the uh not in the harbor here.
[00:17:08] We've seen some not so nice things
[00:17:12] floating around from cruise ships, let
[00:17:15] alone the smell from people dumping
[00:17:17] every now and again. So, yes, you have
[00:17:19] to deal with that. Somebody's got Yes.
[00:17:24] Yes. Sounds like some out of Final
[00:17:26] Fantasy. One, two. Hey, well, I can uh
[00:17:30] that not not good for that one. So, we
[00:17:31] can change it up if no one's liking it.
[00:17:34] So, we're going to do that. Shuffle that
[00:17:35] up. That'll be our giveaway cards. And
[00:17:37] we'll put those over there. That's our
[00:17:39] Wills one in the background. But I open
[00:17:41] up a pack from Nolan here. We'll see
[00:17:42] what you
[00:17:44] get. It's hanging out. Like I
[00:17:48] said, all good. Just made me think of
[00:17:50] it. Ah. All right. All right. Yeah. I'm
[00:17:51] just playing like royalty-free radio and
[00:17:53] seeing what it does for us. That way you
[00:17:56] can get some uh you can get some tunes
[00:17:57] in the background if you want. And we'll
[00:17:59] uh open up a pack here and kind of see
[00:18:01] what we got going
[00:18:02] on. Yeah. No necessary yacht rock that I
[00:18:05] can find. But that doesn't happen when
[00:18:07] you push it from the upside down. You
[00:18:08] have to push it from the right side to
[00:18:09] get it in. That's silly. Daddy, what's
[00:18:12] up, bud? In the game. Um, where are
[00:18:15] they? Um, for the, uh, doors. Are they
[00:18:18] on? They They're through door number
[00:18:20] two. Um, they have for the adventure
[00:18:22] game, there's through door number two.
[00:18:24] They've done a couple things. They need
[00:18:25] to do like one There's like one or two
[00:18:27] more things they might need to do before
[00:18:29] they get to the third floor door, but
[00:18:30] it's getting close. We have a Nyxorn
[00:18:34] unicorn. We have a galvanic discharge.
[00:18:37] Petrifying Meddler. Foul strike. Breathe
[00:18:40] your last sheltering
[00:18:43] landscape. Snapping void cloth. Ajani
[00:18:47] fell's
[00:18:49] gods. Monstrous
[00:18:52] vortex. Legion leadership. Reef worm.
[00:18:56] Ripples of undeath for the rare. Not
[00:18:58] bad. corrupted shape shifter on a foil
[00:19:00] and a foil planes too with a moon folk
[00:19:05] for your token. I actually don't
[00:19:06] remember seeing the moon folk token
[00:19:07] much. Wonder if that's one of those ones
[00:19:09] that's like a $4 token just because it
[00:19:11] never comes out, you know. Not bad for
[00:19:14] that one. There you go. Not too bad
[00:19:17] there. That wasn't a bad pickup there.
[00:19:19] We'll put that away. And as I do that,
[00:19:21] we'll put uh we'll put the we'll put our
[00:19:22] thing back on. Put that back on in the
[00:19:24] background. Why not throw that in the
[00:19:27] background there for you all to relax
[00:19:29] with while we're hanging out here
[00:19:32] today? Then we do have some more packs
[00:19:34] that we can open. But uh I was hoping we
[00:19:37] get our break filled up here. We can do
[00:19:39] some
[00:19:40] adventuring cuz we have some fun new
[00:19:42] adventures that we can do. Two spots are
[00:19:44] left in it, everyone. Two spots. You
[00:19:47] know what? Let's do this. I'm going to
[00:19:49] pin just specifically the one so you can
[00:19:51] see it.
[00:19:53] So, this is our break with Will. All
[00:19:55] right, we have these packs or in it. It
[00:19:59] is Duskorn. I'm going to zoom out.

[00:20:06] we have Duskorn, Modern Horizon 3, a
[00:20:10] mystery booster 2, Time Spiral,
[00:20:12] Commander Legends, and a Foundations.
[00:20:14] That is what's in Will's Break right
[00:20:16] there. We're trying to get that done
[00:20:17] today. I think we can, but we'll see.
[00:20:20] And these this was the degen brake
[00:20:22] there. And then there's Nolan's other
[00:20:24] brake is over there. So that's what we
[00:20:25] got set up. We figure we can try to get
[00:20:27] that uh accomplished today. Let's do it
[00:20:30] this way so you guys can see everything
[00:20:32] kind of all the good stuff. There you
[00:20:35] go. See all the good stuff there.
[00:20:42] Yeah, dude. All right. You No, this is
[00:20:45] um this is actually just bandaging them.
[00:20:48] It's the same as before. Actually,
[00:20:49] they're a little bit better. This is
[00:20:51] from yesterday cuz um we had a clogged
[00:20:56] toilet. I had to fix it.
[00:21:00] Yeah, I got clear. Okay, that brought
[00:21:03] we'll have to That's fine. We'll have to
[00:21:05] play with it later again.
[00:21:07] So, I had to deal with that [ __ ]
[00:21:10] literally.
[00:21:11] And when I at one point I scraped my
[00:21:14] hand trying to pull something out. So,
[00:21:15] that's what that came from. But yes,
[00:21:19] pun
[00:21:21] intended. I do take care of myself for
[00:21:23] the most part. I don't have much of an
[00:21:25] issue, but hey, every now and again you
[00:21:27] get a headache. A little bit of a
[00:21:28] headache. You got to But we're getting
[00:21:29] fixing most of the little minor things.
[00:21:31] When all those get done, we'll get to do
[00:21:32] some more stuff.

[00:22:25] underneath our uh sink so that all the
[00:22:27] fresh water comes out with it that way.
[00:22:30] So, that's what we don't have that set

[00:25:21] like it. And I see somebody made some
[00:25:24] updates to our um character stuff. So,
[00:25:27] I'm going to have to uh I think I'm
[00:25:28] going to have to do some of that there.
[00:25:30] And I I do like what Nico did there. So
[00:25:32] I'm going to have to adjust in the
[00:25:34] character.
[00:25:45] [Music]
[00:25:47] I like that.
[00:25:51] [Music]
[00:25:58] Do this.
[00:26:03] That then I have It was a nice little
[00:26:06] update he made to the the uh thing.
[00:26:12] Yeah, it was it's really quickly set up,
[00:26:14] but I like what he did there to set it
[00:26:15] up a little differently. I was like,
[00:26:16] "Oh, that's nice." So, I kind of was
[00:26:17] working. I'm like, "Oh, I'll do that
[00:26:19] myself." Too late. And I'm putting that
[00:26:21] in there now. Kind of how we had it how
[00:26:23] everything was set up there. So, I kind
[00:26:24] of like what it was. Yeah, it was just a
[00:26:25] quick way to get everything so I could
[00:26:27] track everybody's uh you know,
[00:26:28] everybody's movements in the game while
[00:26:30] we're playing our
[00:26:32] adventure. But, looks like we do have
[00:26:34] our last spot. So, I'm going to hit
[00:26:36] start break. Okay. Okay. And then I'm
[00:26:38] going to ping the other people that were
[00:26:40] here that were part of it. So I got to
[00:26:43] go to the last show
[00:26:49] and I will get everybody to ping from
[00:26:51] the last one
[00:26:58] was Miss Nico and oh Miss Nico is the
[00:27:01] only one to ping. I had to ping Miss
[00:27:03] Nico.
[00:27:09] push up. Switch up, Miss Nico.
[00:27:15] Break time. So, when we do breaks, right
[00:27:19] before we do them, I like to, like I do
[00:27:20] before, I like to run a giveaway. So,
[00:27:23] we're going to do another giveaway here.
[00:27:24] Waiting before our break
[00:27:26] begins. So, we'll run one for everybody

[00:27:32] running. We'll wait for that giveaway to
[00:27:34] go. We'll give 5 minutes for everybody
[00:27:36] to come in. Be ready to go for the break
[00:27:40] and we'll open our
[00:27:43] packs. What do you guys think of the
[00:27:44] view here? Not too bad this morning.
[00:27:49] I think I'm going to have to do this
[00:27:50] here. Hold on a second. I'm going have
[00:27:52] to slide. The camera might bump. Oh,
[00:27:53] you're not even looking at that camera,
[00:27:54] so it doesn't even
[00:27:59] matter. There we go.
[00:28:03] Yes. stability sometimes on a boat gets
[00:28:06] you.
[00:28:10] Um, yeah. Yep. So, they do have some
[00:28:12] with original, but that's um I can't
[00:28:13] remember what it is. It's a longer one
[00:28:15] for you,
[00:28:16] Michael. All right, we're waiting for
[00:28:18] our friends to come in here. We got one
[00:28:20] last uh Miss Nico, we're waiting for her
[00:28:23] to Miss Nico to show up. And um I don't
[00:28:25] know, Nico, if you want to
[00:28:29] Oh, hold on. I needed to pin it for
[00:28:31] today. Give me one second.
[00:28:35] I need to I have to make it available on
[00:28:37] each show. Um, so that's all. Hold on a
[00:28:39] second.
[00:28:45] That's all
[00:28:48] there. You should be able to use it now.
[00:28:51] Should be able to use that now if you
[00:28:53] would like. I got the sun right in my
[00:28:54] eyes right now. But hey, luckily I got a
[00:28:56] hat
[00:28:57] on. Yep. I was going to use it for
[00:28:59] pretty much one extra show. So, you had
[00:29:01] like the end of the show. If I was long
[00:29:03] running, say like it was an early show
[00:29:04] that we say I finished like the break at
[00:29:06] 9:00 a.m. and I was going to be going
[00:29:07] again for like another couple hours,
[00:29:09] then it would I only do through the end
[00:29:11] of the show. But if it's like I'm the
[00:29:12] break the break is over and I'm done,
[00:29:14] then uh I'll do it through the next show
[00:29:17] for you. So, two spots
[00:29:19] left. Oh, they're already gone in Will's
[00:29:22] Break. Will's break's already done.
[00:29:24] Yeah, the two spots are taken. Where?
[00:29:26] Wait. I just ping Miss uh Miss Nico to
[00:29:29] get her in here now.
[00:29:31] Um, Gate, I think I sent you a message
[00:29:33] response. If I did not, I said if you
[00:29:35] want to ask for the refund on that, I
[00:29:37] don't know what happened. I shipped a
[00:29:38] bunch of things out. There's been a
[00:29:40] recently just with uh the post office
[00:29:43] things not being scanned or shipped
[00:29:46] right. I think it's just the holiday
[00:29:47] season. So, I've had a handful of things
[00:29:49] probably like four to five in the last
[00:29:52] two weeks that I had done shipping that
[00:29:54] were just not just went missing. Like I
[00:29:57] don't know what freak happened to them.
[00:29:58] Like I dropped them off with everything
[00:29:59] else. everybody else's stuff went there.
[00:30:01] But I don't know, whatever. You can I
[00:30:03] can I can only do what I can, you know?
[00:30:05] I drop them off there. They're supposed
[00:30:06] to be taken care of. I can't do anything
[00:30:08] after that kind of deal. But I can do
[00:30:11] for you is if you want the refund, I'll
[00:30:13] refund you. Um and or if you want and
[00:30:17] you jump in on something here, I will
[00:30:19] literally open whatever it is and do it
[00:30:20] that way. So, it's up to you all what
[00:30:23] you want to do. I just try to be as fair
[00:30:24] as I can because it just sucks when I
[00:30:26] know I chop stuff off and the mail
[00:30:27] doesn't
[00:30:29] Yeah, mail doesn't do what it's supposed
[00:30:30] to necessarily. You know what I mean?
[00:30:34] Yeah. But that's where we're at right
[00:30:37] now. All right, Miss Nico, are you in
[00:30:39] here? Hopefully Miss Nico's in here.
[00:30:41] [Music]
[00:30:42] Uh little thing at one more time.
[00:30:55] Yeah. See, Kep, that's what I mean. Like
[00:30:57] I've dropped stuff off and I've I've had
[00:30:59] stuff even like my wife ordered
[00:31:01] something and she's like it was supposed
[00:31:02] to be here uh like before Christmas. Now
[00:31:05] it's not going to be here until
[00:31:08] um like the like couple like a week or
[00:31:11] two into
[00:31:17] January. Now that's crazy.
[00:31:21] Yeah, I've had that happen before, too,
[00:31:23] where I got a I got a refund on
[00:31:25] something and it never showed up and
[00:31:29] then it was like a month or two later
[00:31:31] something showed up. It was medication,
[00:31:32] actually. They were sending I had like
[00:31:34] mail order medication. They were sending
[00:31:35] that over to me and for whatever reason,
[00:31:38] it got disappeared in the mail. And then
[00:31:41] when we were coming back to
[00:31:42] it, like 2 months later, it showed up
[00:31:45] with other medication at the same time.
[00:31:46] Like, well, I guess I got double dose
[00:31:47] now. I know. Yeah. So, I had I Exactly.
[00:31:50] I had to call the doctor cuz the
[00:31:51] medicine's for my um my u my bad surgery
[00:31:54] that I had. So, I had to call the doctor
[00:31:56] like, "Can you get send him another
[00:31:57] one?" He's like, "I just sent it over."
[00:31:58] I'm like, "I can't do anything about it.
[00:31:59] I haven't had it. I'm literally out and
[00:32:00] I have not had them sent to me yet.
[00:32:02] Like, I need something else. I need to
[00:32:03] go to the actual pharmacy near
[00:32:08] me. All right, we're almost at the 5m
[00:32:11] minute mark
[00:32:12] there and then we'll get the giveaway
[00:32:14] completed and we will um open our
[00:32:17] packs." So hopefully we can have Miss
[00:32:20] Nico show up. But we had Miss Nico and
[00:32:25] um Spicy, you are the f you're the six
[00:32:27] spots here. So with that being said, I
[00:32:30] need you to tell
[00:32:33] me if it's going to be you, Mystic, and
[00:32:37] Miss Nico playing or do you want to
[00:32:39] bring some friends in? Okay, so we have

[00:48:39] together
[00:48:41] here for the

[00:48:47] get now.
[00:48:51] Uh, have we had anybody come in to
[00:48:53] assist with the adventure or is it just
[00:48:55] going to be you and uh, Mystic here, my

[00:49:02] All right, so first we have to put down
[00:49:07] weapons.
[00:49:11] Weapon. Then you get a choice of health.
[00:49:15] [Music]
[00:49:18] Then you get a choice of weapon.
[00:49:24] and then health
[00:49:29] then
[00:49:32] buff and then safe

[00:49:59] the camera. All right. So, what we'll do
[00:50:01] then is we'll get everybody here and
[00:50:03] shuffle these up so we can see what they
[00:50:05] are and then we're going to hand them
[00:50:08] out so we can hand out all the um the
[00:50:10] hits from our stuff today. All right.

[00:50:21] are hits that we have. That's going to
[00:50:25] be like this. And I think you can see
[00:50:26] them all if I zoom out all the way. I
[00:50:29] think you'll actually be able to see
[00:50:31] everything. So
[00:50:33] here. Ah, that's all right. Hey, it's

[00:56:21] top loader. And they'll do the same
[00:56:22] thing for the rest of you with your
[00:56:24] hits. And you guys now all need to

[00:56:41] um put them in a bag here. with all your
[00:56:44] stuff together. That way we can do our

[00:57:20] we're putting in the top loader
[00:57:24] there for you my friend and then mystic.
[00:57:27] But yeah, you all need to decide what
[00:57:29] you want to do our adventure now cuz you
[00:57:31] have you're going to start wandering
[00:57:33] through our
[00:57:35] um our wasteland
[00:57:38] here. Maybe you'll get to that door.
[00:57:43] We're not sure yet. Oh, could you get to
[00:57:46] the third floor door? We're not sure.
[00:57:48] We're not sure, Miss
[00:57:49] Nico. If you're in here, let us know.
[00:57:51] Are you cooking?
[00:57:54] Okay, that's fine. Downstairs in that
[00:57:55] rock, so I'm trying to like Okay, that's
[00:57:58] fine. No, I know. I know. That's all
[00:57:59] right. That's why I asked if you were
[00:58:01] cooking cuz you like you're you said you
[00:58:02] were and then you you're doing something
[00:58:03] else and I just want to make sure you
[00:58:04] were okay. Yeah, I was looking down.
[00:58:07] Yeah. At the rocking night made you a
[00:58:09] little little not good. Show good. Gosh,
[00:58:11] I understand. Miss Nico, there's yours.

[00:58:16] tide in with your enduring tenacity,
[00:58:18] Mystic.
[00:58:20] We got CMC planes taking off.
[00:58:27] Yeah, it is nice. You know what? Let's
[00:58:29] do this. I'm going to angle it up for
[00:58:30] you guys. You guys can see out the
[00:58:33] window. Did you take it off? I don't
[00:58:35] know if you can. It's kind of small in
[00:58:37] the distance there. You might have a
[00:58:38] hard time seeing that.
[00:58:47] safe haven codes to get some more
[00:58:48] health. Yeah, maybe not a bad idea.
[00:58:51] Which one do you want to
[00:58:52] use? But remember, you did get uh what
[00:58:55] did you get for your things here for
[00:58:57] your characters so far? You have to pick
[00:58:58] out your weapons. Remember, you have
[00:58:59] your weapon. I think you like all your
[00:59:01] stuff that you got. You got to let me
[00:59:02] know what you want for those ones for
[00:59:04] the break. All right, we're going to put
[00:59:06] this down. Tilt this back down.
[00:59:08] All right. Go back down to
[00:59:11] our about
[00:59:13] there. There we go.
[00:59:18] Angle that a little bit better that way.
[00:59:22] Yeah, I'm good with that. Yeah.
[00:59:24] Yep. Now, if you want, you guys can also
[00:59:27] try for some weapons if you'd like. You
[00:59:30] never know.
[00:59:32] What you can do Oh, that would be bad. I
[00:59:34] like that. Maybe you want to try for
[00:59:36] some weapons.
[00:59:39] Oh, you didn't see what your choices
[00:59:40] were. Yeah, I can tell you. Hold on one
[00:59:43] second. Give me one second. So,
[00:59:46] spicy, you have weapon choice and I
[00:59:50] believe a health choice. Yep. Weapon and
[00:59:52] health
[00:59:54] choice. Now, uh Mystic, are you in
[00:59:57] here? Cuz you get to if you want to
[00:59:59] play, you get to be uh you're going to
[01:00:00] go wandering through the wasteland, too,
[01:00:02] with our friend, I'm guessing. All
[01:00:03] right. So, you had your choice, too. Do
[01:00:04] you know what you were going to do with
[01:00:05] yours?
[01:00:08] No. Yep. All right. Let me know what you
[01:00:11] would like with your character and we'll
[01:00:13] uh we'll get that
[01:00:16] going. No clue. All right. So, here you
[01:00:19] go. Let me uh Mystic if you're going to
[01:00:20] be I think I have you in here at one
[01:00:22] point. I don't know if you were in here
[01:00:23] doing some adventuring, but we'll get
[01:00:24] you now. Your thing
[01:00:27] was a buff. All right. So you get a
[01:00:30] choice of a buff which means you can
[01:00:32] get an engineering
[01:00:34] booster which gives you plus one for
[01:00:36] engineering which helps with like in
[01:00:38] tech weapons and tech stuff. An
[01:00:41] intelligence booster same thing gives
[01:00:43] help with tech weapons and things like
[01:00:44] that and um breaking into things maybe
[01:00:47] you know you have an agility which helps
[01:00:49] with say you were going to use a sword
[01:00:51] or knives gives you a little extra
[01:00:54] there. The strength is you actually on
[01:00:56] the um on the sword and anything that
[01:00:59] can has weight to swing at
[01:01:02] something. And those are your buff
[01:01:04] choices, my
[01:01:10] friend. Let me see what you have for
[01:01:12] your options. I uh I'll pull that up
[01:01:15] here.
[01:01:20] [Music]
[01:01:25] Spicy. Let me get them over here. Here.
[01:01:28] Give me a second. Spicy is at
[01:01:44] [Music]
[01:01:46] Spicy
[01:01:48] has gator dillo
[01:01:57] armor.
[01:02:05] Um, gator dillo armor. You
[01:02:08] have plus one on your strength. You have
[01:02:11] 1 2 3 4 5
[01:02:16] 6 7. No, you do not have enough room for
[01:02:20] an AR cuz you actually need to drop
[01:02:21] something. You have eight
[01:02:25] items. You actually have to drop
[01:02:27] something
[01:02:29] there. Oof. I
[01:02:33] know. So, yes, you probably do need to
[01:02:36] go and sell some stuff and go to your
[01:02:37] room there and check it out. See what's
[01:02:39] going on in the
[01:02:52] room. Yep. Give the weapon choice of
[01:02:55] mine to Mythic. All right. Mythic.
[01:02:58] Mythic wants a weapon choice. Here you
[01:02:59] go. So, you get a knife, a pistol, a
[01:03:04] plasma rifle, an assault
[01:03:07] rifle, or a sword is what you can pick.
[01:03:10] And each one of them comes with some
[01:03:12] ammo, unless it's the sword. That one
[01:03:14] doesn't always come with ammo. It takes
[01:03:16] a little bit for that one to get
[01:03:18] it.
[01:03:21] Sword. Sword. You I like it. So, Mystic,
[01:03:25] we'll get a sword. I like it. All right.
[01:03:26] Mystic's going to come in with a sword.
[01:03:30] Let me get uh this stuff over
[01:03:40] here.
[01:03:50] Consumable. Consumable.
[01:04:08] consumable
[01:04:12] there and your
[01:04:16] weapons. Now, I'll get mystic stuff here
[01:04:18] in a second. I just trying to organize
[01:04:19] it since you got the two of you together
[01:04:21] here. Make it easier to see. What's
[01:04:23] wrong? fan off. Was it blowing the
[01:04:27] thing? Yes. That's why you've been
[01:04:29] having issues, isn't it? No, wasn't that
[01:04:32] earlier.
[01:04:34] I just the window. There you go. Your
[01:04:39] weapons right
[01:04:42] here. And your health
[01:04:47] is 62.
[01:04:53] There we are.
[01:04:56] Then we move you
[01:04:58] over. Mystic Luke, you guys want to come
[01:05:00] in?
[01:05:02] Yeah. Where you heading to? You didn't
[01:05:04] tell me where you're going. The old guy.
[01:05:06] It's in the old guy. Yeah. So, you have
[01:05:10] you have if that's where you're going to
[01:05:11] do, Luke. I mean, um you're going to go
[01:05:13] over to your hole in the wall, which is
[01:05:18] uh this person here.
[01:05:21] There's the hole in the
[01:05:22] wall. That's what you're going to the
[01:05:25] old guy in that hole in the wall over
[01:05:27] there. You want to go there and say hi
[01:05:28] to him? See what's going
[01:05:30] on? No. No. You know what I'm going to
[01:05:33] do actually right now? I'm going to do
[01:05:36] this. Put that back
[01:05:39] on. Put that back on. Do
[01:05:42] this. And we're going to do that. We're
[01:05:46] going to do not that. What? Your cups.
[01:05:49] Cups. cups. We're going to do this.
[01:05:53] Get some new cups out so that way you
[01:05:55] can have some water while we're sitting
[01:05:57] here.
[01:06:00] Put that to the background there.
[01:06:04] So, you can have a nice view while we're
[01:06:06] figuring out what we're doing.
[01:06:11] There. Bring in the team. Unless I'm
[01:06:13] getting wires crossed. No, no, you can
[01:06:15] bring the team in. Notice the old guy.
[01:06:18] You are full on inventory.
[01:06:20] Yes, Luke. Let me get your health. I can
[01:06:23] tell you what you're at. I think you're
[01:06:25] up
[01:06:27] there, Luke. You are at 86 health is
[01:06:30] what you're at,
[01:06:35] Luke. And then let me find Mystic. I
[01:06:38] know I have you in here somewhere. I
[01:06:39] swear I did. Wow. Where's Flinging all
[01:06:41] over? What is going on? I don't know.
[01:06:43] That's what I was just thinking.
[01:06:46] There's no wind. That's the problem. We
[01:06:48] have zero win. That's why. And a wave
[01:06:50] came by and made us roll. We're spinning
[01:06:52] so weirdly around. My missing. I swear I
[01:06:54] had you in here before. But maybe I
[01:06:57] didn't. Maybe I did not have you in
[01:06:59] here. I think this is your first
[01:07:03] time. Maybe this is your first time,
[01:07:05] Mystic. I can't look right now. All
[01:07:07] right. Hold on. So, we're going to have
[01:07:09] to get your uh you in
[01:07:13] here with that. I didn't

[01:11:14] organized. What? You got your bus for
[01:11:16] good, sir. All right. Sorry. The old
[01:11:18] guy's off of Never Neverland right now.
[01:11:20] He's uh talking to himself. Doesn't
[01:11:22] realize there's even people in the shop.
[01:11:23] What's going on?
[01:11:27] I don't understand anything. I got Luca
[01:11:30] in
[01:11:31] here. All right. So, we got for buffs.
[01:11:34] So, we have for some buffs here. We do
[01:11:39] have an engineering
[01:11:41] booster and we have an giggy booster.
[01:11:45] There's also some health packs there if
[01:11:47] you need any. We also have um some
[01:11:51] plasma ammo you can get from them.
[01:11:55] You can get them. You can get the also a
[01:11:59] Where is it?
[01:12:06] Why do you have Where'd it go?
[01:12:10] How do you have to save? Oh, there it
[01:12:12] is. Assault. No, that's the Where's the
[01:12:15] ammo? Assault rifle ammo right there for
[01:12:18] you, too, if you want it. Those are kind
[01:12:21] of the things that you get there from
[01:12:23] our buddy if he wants
[01:12:25] to. You want to trade some Pogs for
[01:12:28] health? Engineering tooth health packs.
[01:12:32] Yeah, a little easier to follow. Thank
[01:12:33] you. I appreciate that. Yes, definitely.
[01:12:35] That's why I'm kind of going through
[01:12:36] them, organizing a little better now.
[01:12:37] Want to trade some Pogs for health. All
[01:12:38] right. So, Luke has 38 Pogs. So, some
[01:12:42] health would be five Pogs for each one
[01:12:46] of the 20 healths. Do you want to go
[01:12:48] down to I'm guessing that's telling you
[01:12:49] you want to go down to uh 28 pogs and
[01:12:52] you're going to get two
[01:12:53] healths, my friend Luke.
[01:12:59] One pack. One pack. All right. One pack
[01:13:01] it is Luke. So that puts you up to
[01:13:06] 30
[01:13:08] three. Thank you. Yeah, I do appreciate
[01:13:10] that too because I I've been trying to
[01:13:11] like get through some things and I just
[01:13:13] haven't gotten to organizing stuff like
[01:13:15] that. So I I do very much appreciate
[01:13:24] it. Spicy needs
[01:13:27] one. Spicy. You want a health pack? I'll
[01:13:30] do who? Two health packs in the
[01:13:32] engineering. All right. Now the
[01:13:33] engineering buff is 10 because it's a
[01:13:36] permanent thing there. All right. So it
[01:13:37] would be 20 if you're going with that
[01:13:39] spicy. Are you good? All right. Spicy
[01:13:41] says I'm good. Bring you down to 30.
[01:13:45] for Spicy. Spicy now has another
[01:13:50] engineering. Bring you up to two on that
[01:13:54] engineering. And that also gets you
[01:14:01] uh times
[01:14:05] times two
[01:14:07] [Music]
[01:14:11] times. Just 20 health.
[01:14:17] All righty then.
[01:14:21] What is in the bag? Need to pitch your
[01:14:23] cell. Yes, that's what I was going to
[01:14:24] let you know. I was going to say you
[01:14:25] need to get rid of some things. So you
[01:14:27] have spicy to the two health right now,
[01:14:31] but you also have two pistols, a sword,
[01:14:34] the
[01:14:35] flamethrower, the
[01:14:37] AR, you have rata
[01:14:42] away, and you have the hole in the wall.
[01:14:45] Actually the one. So you have one, two,
[01:14:48] three, four,
[01:14:53] five, six. 1 2 3 4 five
[01:14:59] six seven things because hole in the
[01:15:02] wall doesn't count because it's just
[01:15:04] like a
[01:15:06] code. So yeah, that's what you got
[01:15:09] there. And I'll go grab Nico and bring
[01:15:11] Nico over.
[01:15:21] Nico has lots of stuff here for his uh
[01:15:25] buffs, which is
[01:15:27] nice. Nico's buffs go
[01:15:32] in 30. Nico, go over
[01:15:35] there. You have 87
[01:15:38] of 100. But when you go to Well, thank
[01:15:42] you. I'm going to take that. Uh you want
[01:15:43] to put that right behind me and I'll
[01:15:44] take that right after I finish putting
[01:15:46] these in.
[01:15:47] Rank your waters, please. Then I need to
[01:15:50] do the Pogs.
[01:15:53] 36 Pogs.
[01:15:56] Then we got to
[01:15:58] do your weapon. You You already have
[01:16:01] plus two on health and a rad
[01:16:06] removal. Plus two on health and rad
[01:16:10] removal. Rad removal is a consumable.
[01:16:20] Rad removals consumable. All right. And
[01:16:24] then big boy. Uh, that's okay. No
[01:16:28] worries. I put that as a consumable
[01:16:30] right now. So, I'm I had that in there.
[01:16:33] And then I have all your weapons. They
[01:16:36] got Oh, you got critical hit. Forgot
[01:16:39] about that one.
[01:16:43] Oh, you're already in there, Nico. Why
[01:16:45] am I putting you in
[01:16:46] there? You're at
[01:16:48] 87 out of 100 to You're already in
[01:16:52] there. Sniper plasma. You already got
[01:16:54] all your stuff in there. Why am I doing
[01:16:55] that, Danny? Denny. So, you got
[01:16:59] um You already put yourself in there.
[01:17:03] Consumable there. I'm going to remove
[01:17:05] all that cuz I already have you in
[01:17:07] there. Well, that works.
[01:17:12] So, we are ready actually for and then I
[01:17:14] will um we got four people. Nico, Spicy,
[01:17:17] Mystic, and Luke. Do we have anybody
[01:17:18] else? Want to trade this AR for
[01:17:20] something. That's the least thing I for
[01:17:21] you can trade the art. Nico, don't be
[01:17:23] hard on yourself. Hey, you did all the
[01:17:25] work. You did a lot. Thank you. I
[01:17:27] appreciate it. It helped out a lot.
[01:17:29] Ah, that's all right. No worries. No
[01:17:30] worries. It's very much appreciated.
[01:17:32] Everything is very good and helpful.
[01:17:33] Actually, organized a lot easier, so it
[01:17:34] makes it easier for me to see. So, I do
[01:17:36] very much appreciate that. Do very, very
[01:17:38] much appreciate that.
[01:17:39] Nice. We got our character
[01:17:42] here. River adventure. The four of you
[01:17:46] getting
[01:17:47] ready to wander around
[01:17:51] somewhere. All right. So, you want to
[01:17:53] trade your AR for something. So, the AR
[01:17:55] would be 12 Pogs. Now, if I missed
[01:17:59] anybody, uh, Luke, now Mystic, my guess
[01:18:03] is you don't have too much there. So
[01:18:05] maybe we can have somebody um see what
[01:18:08] else we can get Mystic here. He has 100
[01:18:10] health
[01:18:12] currently. No health packs, but they got
[01:18:15] plus five on the sword and a plus one on
[01:18:16] strength, which is pretty good for some
[01:18:18] buffs. Then you have uh none of the
[01:18:20] pogs, but who sees what's going to
[01:18:22] happen? That's a actually not a bad one.
[01:18:23] Not bad for your for your coming out
[01:18:25] there right
[01:18:26] away. Give him one of your ARs. That's a
[01:18:29] good idea. All right. So,
[01:18:32] Luke, I'll sell an AR and give Pogs to
[01:18:35] Mystic. I like it. So, 12 Pogs for
[01:18:37] Mystic.
[01:18:39] Nice. Nice
[01:18:43] friends. 12 Pogs for
[01:18:49] Mystic. And
[01:18:51] then he's going to get an AR.
[01:18:55] Also, we going to give him any ammo.
[01:18:59] [Music]
[01:19:00] Yeah, was the same. Did you get the
[01:19:02] white? Yeah,
[01:19:04] friends on an adventure. Help out. Nice.
[01:19:07] You give any How much ammo do you want
[01:19:08] to give them?
[01:19:11] One, two, three, four, five.
[01:19:20] Yeah.
[01:19:26] So, you have the AR, you have 15 rounds,
[01:19:29] it
[01:19:30] says. You have 15, it says. But it looks
[01:19:33] like we have um
[01:19:39] our buddy Luke. Wait, Luke. Luke, I
[01:19:42] lied. You have I'm lying. Luke, you have
[01:19:45] 56 rounds of ammo for your AR.
[01:19:57] You just gave him the AR, right?
[01:20:01] Yeah. Give him 15. All right. Here you
[01:20:02] go. You're going to subtract that from
[01:20:07] there. That will be
[01:20:18] all right. Get yours in there. 15 minus
[01:20:26] go and give him
[01:20:30] 15. There we
[01:20:34] go. Ooh. Pistol ammo or flamethrower
[01:20:37] canisters. H. You
[01:20:40] know, I might have a flamethrower
[01:20:42] canister. Give me a second to go check
[01:20:44] out back here. Give me a second to check
[01:20:47] out back here for that flamethrower
[01:20:48] canister. I got I got to go look run
[01:20:51] around the back of the room here and uh
[01:20:54] try to find that. Give me Give me a
[01:20:56] second to go and look.
[01:21:09] Yeah.
[01:21:32] All right, let's see. No, it looks like
[01:21:35] he's having a hard time finding some,
[01:21:38] but but hold on. We might have some uh
[01:21:43] we do have some pistol ammo. We d
[01:21:44] definitely have some pistol ammo back. I
[01:21:46] did I ruffled around there and found
[01:21:47] some pistol ammo for you. I did get the
[01:21:50] pistol ammo for you. Oh, that stuff
[01:21:52] should have been on the top. So, you're
[01:21:54] good with the uh Where's the pistol
[01:21:55] ammo? Start level pistol ammo. Level 25.
[01:21:59] Get some pistol ammo you found out back
[01:22:00] there. Perfect. Level. Cool. So, would
[01:22:02] you like to get some pistol ammo? And
[01:22:03] then, hold on. Let's see what else he's
[01:22:05] got over here. You said some
[01:22:06] flamethrower stuff. H. Let's
[01:22:08] see. Let's see if we have any.
[01:22:23] I'll see if we can get anything there.
[01:22:33] We might have a canister that'll come
[01:22:35] out in a little bit there. He says he's
[01:22:36] got to go cook one up in the back. It'll
[01:22:39] be a few minutes, but um I I think we
[01:22:42] Yeah, you got a sniper rifle last time.
[01:22:44] I was cool. Yes, you did. You did get a
[01:22:46] nice gun last time. Look at that thing.
[01:22:48] Oo, yeah. That's a nice sniper rifle you
[01:22:50] picked up there, my friend. 50 cal. But
[01:22:58] Oh, we do not have any big bang bang
[01:22:59] ammo out there for the sniper rifle,
[01:23:01] though. I know he does not have any of
[01:23:02] that, but when you know what? Maybe we
[01:23:04] can uh maybe we can see if he can um
[01:23:06] cook some up too with your uh with the
[01:23:09] flamethrowers flamethrower canisters
[01:23:11] there.
[01:23:13] just died.
[01:23:28] All right. I don't know. We'll find out.
[01:23:30] Maybe we can get some. It looks like he
[01:23:32] might have the ability to cook some up
[01:23:33] in the background, but he's having a
[01:23:35] little bit of a hard time finding
[01:23:39] it. I don't know. We'll We'll see.
[01:23:42] Maybe, maybe might be able to find some.
[01:23:46] It's going to take a little bit again,
[01:23:47] though. It might take a little bit of
[01:23:48] time to find that though.
[01:23:53] Hey, King Tut, where am I? I am
[01:23:55] currently in um the Virgin Islands down
[01:23:58] here in the US. King Tutt, we are uh
[01:24:02] in Long Bay, I think it is. That's where
[01:24:04] we are. Gat ammo. Can't make any gat
[01:24:08] ammo. Can that That one's a little
[01:24:10] harder for me. I don't I don't have
[01:24:11] that. You might want to go over to your
[01:24:12] buddy um
[01:24:15] not him. Sorry.
[01:24:18] No. Might want to go over to your buddy
[01:24:20] uh Gage here. He might have some better
[01:24:22] idea. Oh, King Tut. Yeah, it's kind of
[01:24:24] kind of cold where you are there. We're
[01:24:25] warmer here. We're in the We're in the
[01:24:26] 80s where we are. Yeah, we're hanging
[01:24:29] out. We're getting ready for our
[01:24:30] adventuring. Have some fun, huh?
[01:24:34] All
[01:24:37] right. So, you want to throw some you
[01:24:39] want to throw some Pogs at uh throw some
[01:24:42] Pogs at our hole in the wall to see if
[01:24:44] you can get um some ammo and stuff here
[01:24:46] in a little while. See what happens.
[01:25:21] How many cans can you make? If I throw
[01:25:22] five Pogs and move, that'll only be like
[01:25:24] half a can.
[01:25:27] But a
[01:25:28] canister gets you
[01:25:32] uh five
[01:25:34] shots. All right. All right. 10. You got
[01:25:38] a whole canister. All right. We'll throw
[01:25:39] 10 at them for a
[01:25:41] canister. All right. I like it. We'll
[01:25:43] throw 10 at him for a canister
[01:25:45] there. So spicy with your flamethrower.
[01:25:48] Decides going to throw 10 pogs.
[01:25:57] All
[01:26:01] right, that brings
[01:26:03] you the heck that is completely wrong.
[01:26:06] Uh, that brings you down to
[01:26:08] 20. All right, Nico, what are you going
[01:26:11] to do? I use one of my uh 20s and buy
[01:26:13] plus 20
[01:26:15] health two health
[01:26:20] point. You're going to use one, buy two,
[01:26:23] give one to Mystic, and give Pogs 10
[01:26:26] Pogs for the future. All right, so Nico,
[01:26:28] 10 Pogs for the future. You're going to
[01:26:30] go down to 26 Pogs. Then you're going to
[01:26:33] throw a health pack to Mystic. I like
[01:26:35] it. Plus
[01:26:40] 20 plus 20
[01:26:44] health.
[01:26:46] Then you have plus 20 health.
[01:26:53] Buy two health point health and give one
[01:26:56] to Mystic and give. All right, so that
[01:26:58] brings you down. Buying the two brings
[01:27:00] you down to
[01:27:02] 16. Give one to
[01:27:06] Mystic. Use
[01:27:08] one. All right. So, you're going to use
[01:27:10] one. You gave one to Mystic and you're
[01:27:12] going to use one. So, you're going to
[01:27:13] take one away from you cuz that would
[01:27:15] equal what you did there. So you now
[01:27:18] have you still have two cuz you used one
[01:27:23] and you gave one away which brings you
[01:27:25] up to 100
[01:27:34] health use tech health pack you spicy.
[01:27:37] All right. Spicy says I'm going to use a
[01:27:38] health pack. So you want to go 40 up 40
[01:27:40] to 100. Perfect. Highest you can go.
[01:27:47] cuz you're at 62 right now.
[01:27:50] All right. 100 it is.
[01:27:53] All right. Now, I'm going to actually do
[01:28:05] this. I'm doing this armor. All right.
[01:28:10] So, you're the only one with armor right
[01:28:12] now.
[01:28:15] Okay, let's
[01:28:17] see. Be prepared to be prepared. This
[01:28:20] lesson must be shared. I like it. I like
[01:28:23] it. All right, here we go. We're getting
[01:28:25] ready to go here. We do our adventure
[01:28:27] off and we'll see what
[01:28:29] happens. You guys ready to head out?
[01:28:32] What is it? You heading out now? Me? No,
[01:28:35] not even funny, man. Good to go. Good to
[01:28:38] go. It
[01:28:40] is. There you go. Now remember
[01:28:42] everybody, we have the other brakes
[01:28:44] available if you want to do that den
[01:28:45] brake we
[01:28:46] have which gets you one of the two
[01:28:50] overlords or a pack. The crew
[01:28:56] ready. Yes, Spicy does have armor and
[01:29:00] Bogo did get some armor from the other
[01:29:02] person, but we don't have them. Um
[01:29:04] they're not here
[01:29:07] now. And that armor was
[01:29:12] um from the raider which got you uh
[01:29:16] raider
[01:29:17] armor. I think it was minus two, right?
[01:29:19] Raider
[01:29:21] armor minus
[01:29:26] two. All set. Nico's all
[01:29:32] set. Nice view.
[01:29:38] Hey.
[01:29:40] Um, yeah. Thank
[01:29:43] you. Very much appreciated. I just
[01:29:46] wanted to see you closer. Mhm. My wife's
[01:29:49] standing in a bathing suit right now,
[01:29:54] so I I had to take a
[01:29:58] look. All right, we're ready to roll
[01:30:01] out. Well,
[01:30:04] now Yeah, I got a little distracted for
[01:30:06] a second. Sorry about
[01:30:08] that. Hey, well, if you want to see any
[01:30:10] of us doing our stuff around, you guys
[01:30:12] can follow us on Bigger Boat Adventure.
[01:30:14] You'll see us hand going around and
[01:30:16] doing all kinds of
[01:30:18] stuff. But you all head out. You wander
[01:30:22] past this hallway filled with computers,
[01:30:25] which you have not seen really much of
[01:30:27] those yet. You only had a couple of
[01:30:28] them.
[01:30:34] So, one of the things is
[01:30:38] though you go around a corner. Will y
[01:30:42] should we should they uh bump into your
[01:30:43] guy now or no? Later on
[01:30:47] the safe. Oh, that one. Yeah. All right.
[01:30:51] You guys go around a corner and in front
[01:30:54] of you, you see a dead end, but you see
[01:30:56] something at the end of the hallway. So,
[01:30:58] you wander up to it. Oo, look at this.
[01:31:01] It looks
[01:31:03] like Could be a
[01:31:10] safe. All right.
[01:31:13] So, who here thinks they're smart
[01:31:18] enough
[01:31:20] to go through that safe? We have
[01:31:24] um the smartest person. And we don't
[01:31:27] have uh we have luck, strength, agility,
[01:31:29] and engineering. Some engineering could
[01:31:31] help, but we don't have anybody with
[01:31:34] intelligence in here. Oh
[01:31:36] no, what's going to happen? Maybe we
[01:31:38] have some luck will help us. I don't
[01:31:42] know. A little D and D
[01:31:53] adventure. And we have our DGEN break.
[01:31:55] You can join if you want
[01:31:56] later right there. Oh
[01:32:00] yeah, with our
[01:32:02] background. Calming and
[01:32:05] relaxing. But once our adventure starts,
[01:32:07] maybe it'll
[01:32:12] change. Got some engineering, but I
[01:32:14] don't know what how much so it'll help.
[01:32:15] You can
[01:32:16] try. And you got luck, too. Yeah. What
[01:32:20] do you want to do?
[01:32:22] lock or do you want to try with the
[01:32:26] engineering? You have to
[01:32:28] decide cuz that safe sitting there at
[01:32:30] the end of the hallway.
[01:32:32] [Music]
[01:32:34] Now the other thing is maybe you can
[01:32:36] just uh maybe you want to just come back
[01:32:37] to it
[01:32:39] later. Always try to come back to it
[01:32:41] later.
[01:32:49] Hairly Wars. Yeah, I am on a cat. This
[01:32:52] is my boat. We own this
[01:32:55] Harley. You want to try it with yacht?
[01:32:58] All
[01:33:01] right. No, you cannot do it at the same
[01:33:03] time. It's one or the other. Yes,
[01:33:05] Harley. We are in a catamaran here. This
[01:33:06] is my catamaran. I got a 40ft Leopard.
[01:33:08] We're
[01:33:09] on. You have to run the generator now.
[01:33:11] So hopefully in the near future, we're
[01:33:13] going to hopefully get some solar so I
[01:33:14] don't need to run the generator as
[01:33:17] much because we are at at uh we are on a
[01:33:21] morning right
[01:33:22] now. Nico's feeling it. All right,
[01:33:25] Nico, here we go. We're going to switch
[01:33:28] off the camera now so we can see what
[01:33:30] we're rolling here. What dice do you
[01:33:33] want?
[01:33:39] Nico says he's going to try the safe.
[01:33:41] Purple one. All right. So, Nico goes
[01:33:44] wandering up to the safe, starts
[01:33:47] entering some numbers,
[01:33:50] and what happens? It is going to give
[01:33:53] you the luck. I'm going to give say this
[01:33:55] is going to be a medium safe. All right.
[01:33:57] Since it's one of the first
[01:34:00] ones, which means you need to get Oh,
[01:34:04] wow. Son of a [ __ ] You got 19. I say
[01:34:07] you needed to get over 10. Well, Nico
[01:34:11] did have some luck just now. Look at
[01:34:13] that,
[01:34:14] buddy. Yeah.
[01:34:16] Yeah. Let's see if you can get the view
[01:34:18] back up there. Well, that safe opens.
[01:34:22] You got very lucky with that, my friend.
[01:34:24] Look at that. The safe freaks open. And
[01:34:28] in that
[01:34:29] safe, you find
[01:34:44] Where is
[01:34:45] it?
[01:34:49] Go. You find this in that safe.
[01:34:55] [Music]
[01:35:06] There you go. There you
[01:35:11] [Music]
[01:35:12] go. You find some sniper rifle
[01:35:16] ammo. Look at that, my friend. That was
[01:35:19] a good
[01:35:21] [Music]
[01:35:22] pickup. That was a good pickup there.
[01:35:26] [Music]
[01:35:48] I defeated the boss.
[01:35:52] Now he's my baby.
[01:35:55] Okay, not bad. Sniper. Look at that. Got
[01:35:59] a sniper watching our backs now. Lots of
[01:36:01] V ammo. Lucky, lucky. I didn't think you
[01:36:03] were going to open that, tell the truth.
[01:36:04] So, you're sniper rifle ammo. You now
[01:36:06] have You came out and you had eight
[01:36:08] rounds. You now have 18 rounds. That was
[01:36:12] 10 rounds of sniper ammo. Knifying Nico
[01:36:15] with his knife. So, pretty much he
[01:36:16] snipes you from the background. If you
[01:36:17] get too close to him, he he knives you
[01:36:19] to death. That's what happens there.
[01:36:22] Crazy, my friend.
[01:36:27] All right, here we
[01:36:29] go. So, you get to head out
[01:36:33] now. What do you want to
[01:36:45] do? Sniper
[01:36:48] modifier. Oh, the sniper modifier. Okay,
[01:36:51] so the sniper modifier is um I think it
[01:36:55] was plus six for the sniper modifier.
[01:36:58] You have intelligence and engineering
[01:37:01] helps
[01:37:02] it. All right, so it's a plus
[01:37:05] six and it's intelligence and
[01:37:07] engineering help it. So right now Nico
[01:37:10] has one for engineering. So that'll make
[01:37:12] it a plus seven every time he shoots.
[01:37:15] And it's one big shot. So if you get a
[01:37:16] hit, it's always going to be a nice nice
[01:37:18] hit on it. All
[01:37:21] right, that's what we're at
[01:37:24] there. I don't know. What do you think?
[01:37:27] No, I don't like that. Best
[01:37:31] views. You don't like best views? Go
[01:37:33] away. Remove
[01:37:36] you. Yes. So, that's what you got there.
[01:37:39] Now, what do you all want to do on
[01:37:43] that? You good? You going to turn around
[01:37:46] and head out? You want to go back?
[01:37:49] No. Want to go see if that other guy has
[01:37:51] his stuff? Has your stuff? He might. I
[01:37:54] don't know if he does yet, though.
[01:37:56] No. It's going to be a little while. He
[01:37:58] said it's going to take some more time
[01:37:59] for that. It's going to take some more
[01:38:01] time for the ammo for the uh for the uh
[01:38:03] canister.
[01:38:05] So, you're going to go on the safe. Are
[01:38:07] we going on? Huh? They opened the safe.
[01:38:08] They got really lucky and opened the
[01:38:10] safe.
[01:38:11] So, are we going to move
[01:38:13] on? What are we
[01:38:16] doing? It's up to Dude, do you want to
[01:38:18] try to go back? Hey, go. Hey, we're
[01:38:20] doing an adventure. We do like a little
[01:38:22] keep go. We uh do a little D and D type
[01:38:24] adventure. We sold uh we do a break.
[01:38:25] Once the break is completed, we do a
[01:38:27] little adventure, which is kind of like
[01:38:28] a little raid on our in our wasteland
[01:38:31] vault. Oh, we don't have a creepy
[01:38:33] helper. Uh Will said we have to go the
[01:38:34] other one. Keep
[01:38:37] going. Yep. We're not going to get the
[01:38:39] creepy helper today. But as you keep
[01:38:42] going in front of you, you go out. No.
[01:38:46] No.
[01:38:48] You see a door and you go and you open
[01:38:49] the door and all of a sudden inside that
[01:38:52] door there is a group of
[01:38:53] aliens.
[01:38:56] No. What are you going to do everybody?
[01:38:58] Those group of aliens decide they're
[01:39:01] going to attack. They don't like what's
[01:39:03] going on. They scared you. You scared
[01:39:04] them. So
[01:39:08] they
[01:39:09] charge and they start shooting some of
[01:39:12] their weapons they have which brings
[01:39:15] Nico from his 100
[01:39:19] health down to 89 health. They start
[01:39:23] quick here guys. It brings
[01:39:26] Spicy down to 92 health and it brings
[01:39:31] Mystic
[01:39:32] Enforcer down
[01:39:36] to 95
[01:39:39] health. That's not the way I wanted to
[01:39:41] do
[01:39:43] that. And then it brings our buddy
[01:39:47] Luke
[01:39:49] down
[01:39:51] to 78 health.
[01:39:55] All
[01:39:57] right. Not fun. Not fun. They show
[01:39:59] they're all going to snap off the
[01:40:00] sniper. All right. Here we go. Let's see
[01:40:02] what
[01:40:03] happens. Purple one it is. And the
[01:40:06] sniper plus Oh, look at that. Now, all
[01:40:09] of them are um 18, by the way. And
[01:40:12] there's only three of them. Okay,
[01:40:15] there's three. Well, I think actually
[01:40:16] wait a minute. There might have been
[01:40:17] four. There was supposed to be three.
[01:40:19] Whatever. There's three of them there
[01:40:20] for you. They're all at 40 health.
[01:40:25] 40. All right, my friends. So, you hit
[01:40:29] one. I like it with the sniper. You go
[01:40:32] like
[01:40:36] this. That is a good hit. Brings him
[01:40:39] down to 18 on the health. Good hit on
[01:40:43] one of them. All right, what's next?
[01:40:45] What are you guys doing next?
[01:40:47] The aliens aren't mad are quite mad
[01:40:49] right now that you've swap that you shot
[01:40:51] them with that sniper. Pretty pissed
[01:40:53] off. They do not like
[01:40:54] it. Gat the other one. Oh, I like it.
[01:40:56] We're going to get the other
[01:40:59] one. Oh no, your gat missed. You got
[01:41:05] five. You missed him. That gat did not
[01:41:09] help. He's mad at you for shooting.
[01:41:12] And oh, you're going to use the
[01:41:14] critical. You going to use the critical
[01:41:16] on
[01:41:17] it? Yeah. We're You going to use the
[01:41:19] critical? You can do that. You didn't
[01:41:21] tell me you were using the
[01:41:23] critical. Yes. All right. Critical it
[01:41:26] is. Use that critical
[01:41:28] hit. Up. And that gets plus five on top
[01:41:32] of it. I like it. That brought our buddy
[01:41:37] down. Two. Let's do the math on my other
[01:41:41] thing. I had like a program that I had
[01:41:43] built in the past to build a other game
[01:41:45] like a a like a uh it was like a um
[01:41:48] textbased game and I got through most of
[01:41:51] it but had some glitches and I didn't
[01:41:52] get it fully done and all kinds of [ __ ]
[01:41:54] happened. But anyways, I use that
[01:41:55] now. Uh minus not bad on that hit. You
[01:41:59] get the gap that gets 1 2 3 4 5 six
[01:42:02] shots off and that goes nice. You hit
[01:42:05] them all but one misses bringing it down
[01:42:09] to
[01:42:19] 30 health.
[01:42:22] There you
[01:42:24] go. Yes. All right. Big moves on Luke
[01:42:27] now. Flame
[01:42:30] on. Spicy loves the critical hits. Yes,
[01:42:32] he does. Now, Mystic, what are you
[01:42:34] doing,
[01:42:36] buddy? Just for me. You going to use a
[01:42:39] flamethrower, Spicy? Spicy shoots your
[01:42:42] flamethrower at him. That is a plus six
[01:42:43] also, by the way. It's plus six on the
[01:42:45] flamethrower. Which one you going at?
[01:42:48] Which one are you going after? You got
[01:42:49] to let me
[01:42:53] know. You let me know which one you're
[01:42:55] going to attack
[01:42:57] here. What alien will it be? One that's
[01:43:01] already injured, one that's not injured?
[01:43:02] I don't know. You got to tell
[01:43:05] me. The one with the most health right
[01:43:08] now. I like it. The one with the most
[01:43:09] health. Let's see what
[01:43:12] happens. Oh, my friend. That is not good
[01:43:17] luck. That does not help you with a four
[01:43:20] there. Oof. Oof. You miss and he shoots
[01:43:25] back and he hits
[01:43:27] you. Does not like that attempt there.
[01:43:30] Bringing
[01:43:32] you down to 81
[01:43:35] health. Spicy.
[01:43:38] Now everybody's gone but uh Mystic, what
[01:43:41] do you want to do, my friend? You can
[01:43:42] run in with the sword or you can uh
[01:43:45] attack with your AR.
[01:43:47] Should have used the pistols. I know if
[01:43:49] you use the pistols, you would have got
[01:43:51] you would have gotten uh No, I don't
[01:43:52] think if having the pistols would help
[01:43:54] though. You could have could have gotten
[01:43:56] luckier with a different roll though. I
[01:43:57] don't know. We'll find out the
[01:44:00] pistols. Your flamethrower missed. You
[01:44:03] missed them with the flamethrower there.
[01:44:05] So you know what you know what you're
[01:44:06] doing are doing.
[01:44:10] istic. Yeah, you can
[01:44:13] charge. You can charge in. All
[01:44:17] right. Yes, it does help with the
[01:44:18] pistol. Uh, no. Um, and it was agility
[01:44:22] helps with the pistols and engineering,
[01:44:24] but it's only plus two on the pistols,
[01:44:26] so it would have been four then plus
[01:44:28] one. So, you you would need you would
[01:44:30] only had five, which wouldn't have ted
[01:44:31] it over the 18, which gives you only
[01:44:33] four. Oh. Oh, no.
[01:44:37] You charge in willy-nilly with your plus
[01:44:39] six and it misses.
[01:44:43] Oh my god, you guys. Mystic. Oh no, he
[01:44:48] hits
[01:44:49] you with his pis his laser pistol that
[01:44:53] he had there. Oh, a laser pistol
[01:44:54] bringing you down to 85. You walked off
[01:44:57] to the side. What are we going to do, my
[01:44:59] friend? You decide.
[01:45:05] charge and use the red dice, Luke says.
[01:45:07] All right. Well, it's now up to them if
[01:45:10] they're going to hit
[01:45:11] you. Oh, you got lucky. They missed.
[01:45:15] They missed. Look at that. They missed.
[01:45:17] You guys got lucky. And Luke charges
[01:45:19] with the red dice and Luke. There you
[01:45:23] go. What do you have? Do we have it,
[01:45:24] Luke? Let me see. I think Luke
[01:45:28] had Oh, no. You missed with the sword.
[01:45:34] You smith for the sword,
[01:45:38] Luke. All right, you go down to 70
[01:45:42] health. What are we going to do now?
[01:45:44] Who's going? I know your ex
[01:45:46] stormtroopers just shooting all over the
[01:45:48] place. That's what they did. Yes. Little
[01:45:50] storm trooper to you and like what's
[01:45:51] going on? Shooting their lasers all
[01:45:56] over. Sniper again. All right. Hi, Swan.
[01:46:00] Are we doing the red or the purple? You
[01:46:01] didn't We didn't change it up yet. We
[01:46:02] have to decide. Oh my. You get to decide
[01:46:06] which alien you're going
[01:46:09] after. Red. Red. It
[01:46:13] is 10. 10
[01:46:19] plus 6. Oh my
[01:46:24] god. Oh my god. That is only a minus
[01:46:30] one. Oh, he missed it by one. It drills
[01:46:33] the wall behind them and one of them
[01:46:35] shoots with their larger weapon at you.
[01:46:38] He's not happy cuz that one almost hurt
[01:46:40] him. Went right by his head. Nico knocks
[01:46:43] you down down to 72 health. What are you
[01:46:49] going to do, my friend? Who's up next?
[01:46:52] AR with the most health. Oh my god, the
[01:46:55] red one's not helping you
[01:46:58] all. Luke, the red one is not helping
[01:47:00] you all.
[01:47:02] You miff. You whiff
[01:47:04] too. And they shoot back hitting you
[01:47:07] down to 61
[01:47:08] health. Now we have to bring your ammo
[01:47:12] down to
[01:47:14] that. Then
[01:47:17] Nico ammo down to that.
[01:47:25] Mystic mean spicy ammo down to
[01:47:30] that sword. The one with the la least
[01:47:33] health. All right, spicy.
[01:47:37] Guys, I don't know if this is helping
[01:47:38] you or not because this is the this is
[01:47:39] the second one that we've had. Oh my.
[01:47:42] Spicy, you
[01:47:43] miss. And
[01:47:47] again, you're hit, my friend. Bringing
[01:47:49] you down to 70 health. Yes, you can use
[01:47:52] your health packs. Two of them. That
[01:47:54] brings you up to 100 health, my friend
[01:47:58] Luke. Burn the dice. All right, that
[01:48:00] dice is gone. We're not using that one
[01:48:01] again. Burn that
[01:48:06] dice. Here we go. We're almost done
[01:48:08] here. What happens? We
[01:48:10] have You miss with the sword. I think it
[01:48:14] is only mystic left
[01:48:16] here. Sword the lowest one in the face.
[01:48:19] Now, which one do you want to use? The
[01:48:21] purple or the black sparkly
[01:48:27] one. Black one it is. Here we
[01:48:31] go. Oh my
[01:48:34] god. You missed. They they are they must
[01:48:38] have some agility
[01:48:39] here. All right. You go down. You miss
[01:48:42] them. You
[01:48:43] whiff. You go warning over and you swing
[01:48:46] your sword. Where'd he go? And you whiff
[01:48:50] with that
[01:48:51] swing bringing you down
[01:48:56] to 75 health cuz they hit you with their
[01:49:02] laser. Guys, boat rocking the dices the
[01:49:05] wrong way. I know it's spin. I know. I
[01:49:08] used to have a box that I used, but I
[01:49:10] don't have it available with me right
[01:49:13] now. All right. Ready?
[01:49:18] Gat, the one with the most health, Luke
[01:49:19] says. All
[01:49:22] right. Ah, there you go. Gat has plus
[01:49:29] six. And you have the uh you got the
[01:49:32] engineering for the Gat. So there you
[01:49:34] go. That's a plus seven. You hit the one
[01:49:38] with the most health.
[01:49:41] That knocks him
[01:49:42] down from there from
[01:49:49] 40 down to 28. Nice hit, my friend.
[01:49:53] Lucky one there. Very close. So, I think
[01:49:56] Nico went, Spicy, Mystic, and Luke all
[01:49:59] went. All right, let's see if they uh
[01:50:01] Oh,
[01:50:03] no. The um the
[01:50:08] aliens get a good hit on you.
[01:50:11] All of them.
[01:50:13] Shoot. And they all hit every one of
[01:50:18] you. Nico goes down to
[01:50:24] 52. Spicy goes down to
[01:50:29] 60. Mystic goes down to 61.
[01:50:35] And Luke from
[01:50:37] 100 goes down
[01:50:41] to
[01:50:43] 73. That was a big hit,
[01:50:46] everyone. No, you guys are taking a
[01:50:49] beating here. It's been a rough one. I
[01:50:51] know.
[01:50:53] All right. Yeah. It's up to you now.
[01:50:55] What are you going to do? Those aliens
[01:50:56] have shot. They weren't happy. They took
[01:50:58] your eyes out. They hit you.
[01:51:02] Who's going to go? Who's going to be the
[01:51:03] one that attacks? Who will be the
[01:51:06] winner? Use your one health and the plus
[01:51:09] five over. All right, you're going to
[01:51:10] use your one health. I like it. Use one
[01:51:13] of your healths. Nico goes up to
[01:51:17] 72. And actually, that's going to be
[01:51:20] 787. There you
[01:51:23] go. And you're down to one of those. And
[01:51:27] that one is running right
[01:51:30] now. Dual pistol. The big dude. Spicy
[01:51:33] says dual
[01:51:35] pistol. Yeah, there you go. You come in
[01:51:39] and you dual pistol the big guy that's
[01:51:42] left over and he goes from 30 health.

[01:52:00] 17 health.
[01:52:02] Nice pew. Got right on through with
[01:52:05] those pistols. Nice with the dual
[01:52:07] pistols
[01:52:08] there. Finally. You have not killed one
[01:52:12] yet. There's all three left. One's at
[01:52:14] 18, one's at 17, and one's at
[01:52:19] 28. Yeah, someone can play for you.
[01:52:22] That's fine. If you have to drive, we're
[01:52:23] getting there. Knives on the 17. All
[01:52:25] right, here we go. Oh, look at that. 18.
[01:52:28] You go after the 17 and you hit them
[01:52:29] with knives. Nice. You hit them with
[01:52:34] knives. Let's see what happens to them.
[01:52:37] It goes to That's a good one. That was
[01:52:41] an 11. Brings them down to
[01:52:42] six. Slice and dice with those. And
[01:52:45] Mystic has to go for a drive, so
[01:52:46] somebody can take over. Got the 18 guy.
[01:52:49] We're going to get the 18 guy. Oh no,
[01:52:52] you missed. Luke, you missed. And that
[01:52:55] person, they shoot you. Bringing you
[01:52:58] down to 60.

[01:54:04] Spicy, right? Spicy, you got to go. Or
[01:54:06] did you already go? Oh, no. You hit. You
[01:54:08] already hit. All right, here we go.
[01:54:10] We're going to see what happens with Oh,
[01:54:12] four. Look at that. They missed the big
[01:54:15] one. The the missed. They missed. The
[01:54:17] aliens have missed. Guys got lucky
[01:54:19] again. So, I think this might be getting
[01:54:21] to the last round here before somebody
[01:54:23] kills someone off here or I don't know
[01:54:24] what happens. We'll find out. We're
[01:54:28] here. We're doing it. We're almost at
[01:54:29] the
[01:54:30] end. Sword the big one. You go after the
[01:54:32] big guy. Oh no. Oh my
[01:54:36] god. You critical
[01:54:38] [Music]
[01:54:39] them. Look at that.
[01:54:42] Ready? And that's a plus 12 on top of
[01:54:45] whatever you get. I have to get my box
[01:54:47] back so we can build it better. Oh my.
[01:54:49] Oh my. You go after the large one. That
[01:54:53] goes here. All right. They're at 28
[01:54:56] health. Then that brings them
[01:55:00] down plus the 12.
[01:55:05] I don't know. I need some more right
[01:55:07] now.
[01:55:09] Brings him down to three health. Ooh,
[01:55:11] nice. There you go. Natural
[01:55:16] 20. You going to get it? Going to help
[01:55:18] get the win. Then Spicy is going to
[01:55:20] sword.
[01:55:24] Sports the big guy, Nico. All right.
[01:55:28] Now, who's going next? What are you
[01:55:29] doing next? You want What do you want to
[01:55:30] tell them what you want to do, Will? Me?
[01:55:32] What are you going to do? Sword it.
[01:55:33] You're going to go after the sword. All
[01:55:34] right. Sword for which one? There's the
[01:55:37] one that has three health, six health,
[01:55:39] or 18 health. Three health. Go after the
[01:55:42] three health for the sword. Oh, and
[01:55:44] Will, you have some bad luck right now.
[01:55:46] He missed the guy with the three health.
[01:55:49] And Mystic is hit again. But Mystic's
[01:55:52] going to use his his health. He's going
[01:55:54] to go up to 75 health, which is only
[01:55:56] going to bring him down to 70 health
[01:55:57] with that hit. Nico goes with the knives
[01:55:59] after the
[01:56:01] 18. And oh
[01:56:04] my,
[01:56:05] Nico, it's a three. You missed. Nico, he
[01:56:10] hits you. Bring you down to 70 health.
[01:56:14] Thanks.
[01:56:17] Nice try, Wag. And it's up to Luke, I
[01:56:19] think, now,
[01:56:20] right? AR the lowest guy.
[01:56:24] Ready? Oh my god, you missed. He hits
[01:56:28] you, Luke. This is a tough battle. We
[01:56:32] have some bad luck right now. That
[01:56:33] brings you down to 54
[01:56:35] health. You want to use one of your loot
[01:56:37] your um health packs cuz you got three
[01:56:38] of them. I'd recommend using at least
[01:56:40] one.
[01:56:43] Now they are all annoyed with you and
[01:56:47] they swing. Oh my god, they hit you all.
[01:56:51] You don't have any luck right now. That
[01:56:52] brings Nico down to 60
[01:56:56] health.
[01:56:57] Spicy down to 50
[01:56:59] health. Mystic down to 60
[01:57:03] health. And Luke down to 44. You're
[01:57:07] going to use two of them. All right. So
[01:57:09] that brings you up to 84 health. There
[01:57:12] you
[01:57:14] go. You're going to use some health,
[01:57:16] too. Spicy is going to use some
[01:57:18] health. Brings you up to
[01:57:21] 70. All right. Let's get rid of your
[01:57:23] health one. You're now down to
[01:57:26] one. You're down to
[01:57:28] two. All right. What are we doing, guys?
[01:57:31] Then charging like a madman with your
[01:57:33] sword on the biggest one. Oh my god.
[01:57:38] It's a seven. Spicy, you
[01:57:41] missed. And on again, he hits you. Wow,
[01:57:44] we got some bad. Maybe um maybe we
[01:57:45] should have Will roll. Brings you down
[01:57:47] to 62. Yeah, maybe we should have Will
[01:57:49] roll this next time. It's your bad luck
[01:57:51] that's giving it to everybody else.
[01:57:53] We'll see. Hey, who's up next? Will, are
[01:57:56] you going to roll? Reward for yourself.
[01:57:57] Let's see what happens. Grab the dice.
[01:57:58] You want to do that or the purple, which
[01:57:59] you can change the color if you want. I
[01:58:01] want to do the purple. You're going to
[01:58:02] do the purple one. All right, let's see
[01:58:03] what What are you doing? What are you
[01:58:04] doing first? Who going to do the rifle?
[01:58:06] Rifle and after who?
[01:58:07] Um. Oh, you missed anyways. Anyways. Oh,
[01:58:11] no. He
[01:58:12] missed. That brings him down to 50
[01:58:15] health for Mystic. Oh,
[01:58:18] no. You going to gat the big guy. All
[01:58:20] right, here we go. Oh, you got the big
[01:58:23] guy with the gat. You hit him. You hit
[01:58:25] the big guy with that gat. That brings
[01:58:28] him from 18
[01:58:30] health
[01:58:33] down
[01:58:34] to six health. So, six, six, and
[01:58:37] three. Nice one. They're almost done.
[01:58:41] What are we going to
[01:58:44] do? What are we going to do here today?
[01:58:47] We're almost at it. You
[01:58:49] use the gat. You got that big guy taken
[01:58:53] care
[01:58:54] of. That's the gat. There's your gat.
[01:58:59] So, I think it is up to um what is it?
[01:59:02] Uh spicy. Did he go? No, Nico has to go.
[01:59:06] Nico,
[01:59:08] Nico, it's on to you. Nico goes nice on
[01:59:12] the closest with the sixth. All right,
[01:59:13] here we
[01:59:14] go. Oh. Oh. Oh, knives. Nico, I think
[01:59:19] you have a plus nine because of your
[01:59:20] knives, by the way. Knife is
[01:59:24] four plus five. You have plus nine
[01:59:27] because of the agility. Yes, sir. That
[01:59:30] hits 18. That hits the closest one with
[01:59:34] six. And he's dead. That kills one of
[01:59:36] them off. They got one of them killed
[01:59:38] off. There you go. You're dead. Come on.
[01:59:42] No, it is on to Oh, they miss you. There
[01:59:45] you're lucky they miss. Oh, yeah. They
[01:59:47] miss. You guys got lucky. They shoot
[01:59:49] wildly. Kind of like some aliens and uh
[01:59:51] super stormtroopers here all over the
[01:59:52] place. Nothing happens. Well, say slice
[01:59:56] again. Slice again. Hey, you want to you
[01:59:58] want to roll for you, Will, and see
[02:00:00] which one you go with? Pick your dice.
[02:00:01] That one's been doing pretty good. Or
[02:00:03] you want to do that one, Will? What are
[02:00:04] you going to do? AR or sword? Uh, rifle.
[02:00:07] Rifle. Which one? The six or three? Six.
[02:00:10] All right. Here we
[02:00:11] go.
[02:00:13] 14 plus. We have Mystic has a plus one
[02:00:17] on strength. Oh, it's only a three.
[02:00:19] That's 17. You missed by one. So close,
[02:00:22] buddy. Three of them go off. Three of
[02:00:24] those shots go
[02:00:26] off. That was four. Bring him down to 42
[02:00:30] health. That's not good. So close. So
[02:00:32] why are there so injured? They can't
[02:00:33] blame him for missing.
[02:00:35] Yes, I know. They're pretty injured. So
[02:00:38] who's it on to now? Nico, you're going
[02:00:41] to use
[02:00:42] a sword for Luke. Oh, you hit him with a
[02:00:46] sword. Going after the one at six health
[02:00:49] point. And they they're dead. All right,
[02:00:51] there's one left. One left. He tries to
[02:00:55] go around his room, but he has nowhere
[02:00:56] to go. All his dead bodies are piled
[02:00:57] behind him. Spicy dual pistols it and
[02:01:02] Oh, Spicy, you missed with the dual
[02:01:04] pistols. That did not do it. Now I think
[02:01:07] it is up to who? No. Well, they're going
[02:01:11] to roll. And they hit. They hit. And
[02:01:14] this time they hit Luke. Bringing Luke
[02:01:17] down to 74 health. All right. Ready,
[02:01:20] Will? You going to roll and see what
[02:01:21] happens? You going to go with a sword or
[02:01:23] the uh sword? Sword after the small one.
[02:01:26] 12. 12
[02:01:30] plus six. There you go. Cuz the sword is
[02:01:34] plus five and you have strength. That's
[02:01:36] an 18. So Will charges in for the final
[02:01:42] kill. Swing with a
[02:01:44] sword. And well, I like that he dies.
[02:01:49] Down to zero. All right, there you go.
[02:01:52] Your aliens are dead in the room there.
[02:01:55] Now, each of you end up getting 10 pogs.
[02:01:57] We always go 10
[02:02:00] pogs. So, you're going to get
[02:02:02] 26, 30 for
[02:02:06] Spicy, 22 for Mystic, and 43 for Luke.
[02:02:11] All right. There's going to be four
[02:02:14] health packs that drop. I recommend
[02:02:16] everybody taking one. Yeah, I recommend
[02:02:19] taking everyone.
[02:02:20] So, I'm going to mock up our friend
[02:02:22] Mystic to
[02:02:24] 62. I'm going to put everybody up to 80
[02:02:28] for Nico, 82 for Luke. I mean, Spicy and
[02:02:33] 94 there for Luke. All right. Then we
[02:02:37] also find some plasma rifle
[02:02:40] ammo. And you find an intelligence
[02:02:46] booster. Okay.
[02:02:49] Then you find
[02:02:53] um where is it? Sign
[02:02:57] some well gatling gun
[02:03:00] ammo. And then I thought I put the ammo
[02:03:03] in there. Then you find a new weapon. An
[02:03:06] alien gatling gun. I made that one. That
[02:03:08] was Will's design. An alien gatling gun.
[02:03:12] So you guys get to decide who gets what
[02:03:16] right now.
[02:03:18] What are we going to take? Who's going
[02:03:19] to take what? I don't
[02:03:21] know. Need GD ammo. All right, Luke
[02:03:25] takes the GAD ammo. So, Luke, you take
[02:03:27] that GAD ammo and you go from I think
[02:03:30] you were at like 30 something. We're
[02:03:33] going to put you back up to full box of
[02:03:35] ammo at 60. All right. We're going to
[02:03:36] put you into a full box of ammo at 60
[02:03:39] there cuz you went down a
[02:03:41] chunk. Spicy. It's up to whoever wants
[02:03:43] it.
[02:03:48] It is a Yes, it is a laser gatling gun.
[02:03:51] That is correct. That is a laser gatling
[02:03:54] gun. Can I take that one? I don't know.
[02:03:56] It's up to It's what everybody wants.
[02:03:58] Should Mystic take
[02:04:00] that or should Spicy or Nico take it?
[02:04:04] You guys can fight over it. I can roll
[02:04:06] for it and see uh see who's closer.
[02:04:09] Yeah, Mystic is new and they don't have
[02:04:11] um they don't have one, but Nico doesn't
[02:04:13] have any special rifle. Oh, you have a
[02:04:15] sniper. So, there you go. Nico has the
[02:04:16] sniper. So, you have a special. Sage has
[02:04:18] the uh flamethrower, which is a special
[02:04:20] one. And Mystic. Yeah, there you go. So,
[02:04:22] Mystic could be a good one with that.
[02:04:26] Maybe you shot with the AR a few times.
[02:04:30] That brings it down to six. So, it's up
[02:04:32] to you guys what you want to do. Or
[02:04:34] should we roll to see who gets it?
[02:04:41] Hey, cluck. Up to Gr. You're good with
[02:04:44] whatever. Hey, how's it going? Roll. All
[02:04:46] right. So, Will, tell me a number. Okay.
[02:04:50] Between 1 and 20. 10. All right. Nico, a
[02:04:53] number between 1 and 20. And Spicy, a
[02:04:55] number between 1 and 20.
[02:04:59] Whoever's closest gets it. 17. 13 and
[02:05:02] 17. All right. So, 10, 13, and 17.
[02:05:07] Me. Well, Will is the one with 10. There
[02:05:11] you go. So, it goes to Mystic. All
[02:05:15] right. Good. There you go. Mystic gets
[02:05:18] the
[02:05:20] alien
[02:05:22] gat. Um, which comes
[02:05:28] with ammo of
[02:05:32] um No. Well, plasma. Yeah, sure. No. um
[02:05:36] laser lasers for um we'll say is 30 and
[02:05:42] each time it shoots five lasers. There
[02:05:46] we
[02:05:48] go. Intelligence. That's good. Yeah. You
[02:05:51] want to take the intelligence spicy? I'm
[02:05:52] good with that. So intelligence going to
[02:05:55] spicy if that's okay with everyone else.
[02:05:57] That's what the intelligence looks like.
[02:05:59] Intelligence is that one goes to spicy.
[02:06:02] We're good with that. Oh, okay. Spicy
[02:06:04] for the
[02:06:13] intelligence.
[02:06:15] Okay, there is
[02:06:20] um there was
[02:06:22] intelligence. There was plasma ammo for
[02:06:25] the plasma
[02:06:27] rifle. There was the Gatling gun ammo.
[02:06:31] There is the alien gun. Then there is
[02:06:34] the
[02:06:35] intelligence plus the
[02:06:37] health. There is no other ones there.
[02:06:41] Unless somebody has some luck and they
[02:06:43] want to roll for something
[02:06:47] else. Yeah, we need more good brains.
[02:06:49] Yes, we can see if somebody wants to try
[02:06:52] to see their luck on there cuz I think
[02:06:53] and Luke has luck. You can roll to see
[02:06:56] if you find something under a dead
[02:06:58] body. Doesn't generally happen, but you
[02:07:01] can try it. But what would be left over
[02:07:03] is the plasma rifle ammo. Well, and
[02:07:06] everybody's going to get some Pogs, too,
[02:07:08] cuz Gen Check them all. All right, let's
[02:07:10] do it. We're going to roll. And this is
[02:07:13] going to have to be we'll say 16 or
[02:07:15] higher cuz of luck. Here we go. Ready?
[02:07:17] Let's see
[02:07:20] it. Oh my god, guys. You did not get
[02:07:23] anything. Nothing was found under those
[02:07:24] bodies. No, no, no. It was a five.
[02:07:34] Oh, hey. It didn't work. But you know
[02:07:38] what? We have some Pogs and some ammo
[02:07:41] for our buddy coming up. Yeah. Next for
[02:07:45] Luke. You want Pogs and ammo? Yeah.
[02:07:49] Get the leftover Pogs that were found
[02:07:53] or they can be split. It's up to all
[02:07:54] you. All right. Take the leftover Pog.
[02:07:55] So Luke goes up
[02:07:58] to 58 Pogs and you take the one two
[02:08:05] three
[02:08:08] [Music]
[02:08:10] four and you take the ammo for the
[02:08:16] uh which is eight rounds of plasma
[02:08:19] ammo. All right, Spicy. Yes, you did
[02:08:22] take yours. You got um What did you get?
[02:08:29] Spicy. All right, you're all set, too.
[02:08:34] Okay. All
[02:08:36] right. Any alien parts? There are um
[02:08:39] There are no alien parts to collect this
[02:08:42] time. There are no alien parts to
[02:08:44] collect this time. The weapon was the
[02:08:46] big thing there.
[02:08:49] Give them to whoever.
[02:08:51] Plasma. plasma.
[02:08:55] Are we still on level? Yeah, we can gift
[02:08:57] it to somebody during one of the
[02:08:58] somewhere else. I can do that. We'll
[02:09:01] gift it to Nico has them plasma. Plasma.
[02:09:05] And that will go up to um
[02:09:09] that goes eight there. That gets rid of
[02:09:11] them from you. There you
[02:09:13] go. All right. All righty. Gift them to
[02:09:17] somebody.
[02:09:18] So, we have uh completed the adventure
[02:09:21] today. Now, maybe tomorrow we'll get to

[00:03:25] here what is
[00:03:33] sometimes it doesn't showing anybody in
[00:03:42] here
[00:03:45] um what's the thing that is up now all
[00:03:47] right so these are the uh these are our
[00:03:49] um virtual pole boxes and that's what I
[00:03:51] was saying we have something fun here
[00:03:54] that we were uh it's pretty much it's
[00:03:55] a pretty fun little cheap thing here so
[00:03:58] this one as you can see the
[00:04:01] ceiling is 18 uh the is 80 the average
[00:04:04] is1 1850 and the floor is $6 for what we
[00:04:09] have there and this is just like a
[00:04:10] virtual pole box so you get to uh find
[00:04:13] if you click on that you should be able
[00:04:14] to see everything that's in it so if you
[00:04:16] go and you look what's in that mutant S
[00:04:18] one if you go there's like a break area
[00:04:19] and you can see everything that's in
[00:04:21] there you should be able to see all of
[00:04:23] them there and then what I'm going to do
[00:04:24] here is I'm going to run that here now
[00:04:28] and then what it does is you get to get
[00:04:29] get it
[00:04:30] for come on run there we go I'm going to
[00:04:33] start it at 18 to try your luck to see
[00:04:36] if you get it or you get one of the
[00:04:37] singles or the things that's in there
[00:04:38] and I'll just run it for 45 seconds for
[00:04:39] a little bit longer so you can see
[00:04:40] what's in it you can go and look at the
[00:04:42] all the
[00:04:44] options okay do
[00:04:47] that okay and then the other thing is we
[00:04:50] have this thing that you guys are
[00:04:51] searching for today you're searching for
[00:04:53] these they're called the Nexus chords
[00:04:56] now what these are kind like a fun thing
[00:04:57] with our game that we do
[00:05:00] you got to look for those with the
[00:05:02] hope
[00:05:04] of finding them in all the in all of our
[00:05:08] um random breaks here now I'm going to
[00:05:10] have it randomly listed at the end of
[00:05:12] some of the things and what it is is it
[00:05:14] means you have it's going to build up to
[00:05:17] some
[00:05:21] options what the options are going to
[00:05:23] allow you to do is uh is a collect Nexus
[00:05:26] cores the more pretty much the more
[00:05:27] Nexus cores you collect
[00:05:31] the uh the better the chance you you can
[00:05:34] build kind of build your own giveaway
[00:05:36] with the Nexus course so you want to
[00:05:38] kind of collect them as you're as you're
[00:05:39] hanging out here with the hopes that as
[00:05:42] you get
[00:05:46] some you can build your own giveaway so
[00:05:49] say for instance you decide you want to
[00:05:52] do a buyer's giveaway but you want to do
[00:05:54] it and you only have one NEX core you're
[00:05:55] going to you know what hey let me do the
[00:05:56] um let me do that bonus box try the
[00:05:59] bonus box but say you want to save up
[00:06:00] your Nexus cores and go you know what
[00:06:01] hey I'm going to save up those Nexus
[00:06:03] cores I've been collecting and instead I
[00:06:06] wanted to go and have it to be um
[00:06:07] certain type of single like a single
[00:06:09] that's worth a certain amount or maybe
[00:06:10] you got uh three or four of them saved
[00:06:12] up and you want it to be a pack or maybe
[00:06:13] you're lucky and you're one of the ones
[00:06:16] that gets the one that has the
[00:06:18] combining there a binding one I'm
[00:06:21] getting the image made for that binding
[00:06:22] one that's one I haven't had that yet
[00:06:24] but maybe you're lucky where you have
[00:06:26] that and if you get the binding one that
[00:06:29] means you can you and two people can put
[00:06:31] your Nexus cores together with the
[00:06:34] potential of
[00:06:36] getting a setting up a
[00:06:38] larger buyer giveaway now that's kind of
[00:06:42] like you guys get to pick your giveaway
[00:06:44] is really what it is it's it'll be fun a
[00:06:46] fun way for you guys to either you can
[00:06:48] do something right away quick or you can
[00:06:49] pick something um because you need you
[00:06:51] want to hang out for a while and you can
[00:06:52] try to collect a few of them and like I
[00:06:55] said these are them here but for
[00:06:57] instance that's that and we'll run say
[00:06:59] you want to do try your luck on this
[00:07:01] which is the secret layer one all right
[00:07:05] now these are all singles in one secret
[00:07:07] layer in there so this is a good chance
[00:07:09] for something for just $3 it's either a
[00:07:12] single where you could get a floor of
[00:07:13] five cents but it's a rare it's always a
[00:07:18] rare and that's what we're doing here
[00:07:21] having some fun doing
[00:07:28] that that's why and like and the other
[00:07:30] thing too is each one of the Nexus cores
[00:07:33] even if you don't end up using
[00:07:35] them as you build them up uh each one of
[00:07:38] the Nexus cores what I was going to do
[00:07:39] here is they are actually all going to
[00:07:42] be once
[00:07:45] um they're going to be a percentage
[00:07:47] you'll be able to get a discount code
[00:07:49] because there's not a ton of them in
[00:07:50] here there's only a few of them mixed in
[00:07:52] with
[00:07:56] things so if you get one but they are um
[00:08:00] yeah they're pretty much virtual pull
[00:08:02] boxes there's a ton of
[00:08:04] them you get to see where they are and
[00:08:06] you get to search and find if there's on
[00:08:08] maybe one of them has the like I said
[00:08:09] maybe one of them has the Nexus
[00:08:11] coordinate somewhere that you're going
[00:08:13] to connect let's run this one now we're
[00:08:15] going to run this
[00:08:20] one see if one of you want a uh chance
[00:08:24] at secret
[00:08:26] lirer Chucky and just packs a c
[00:08:30] cards this is a good one now the floor
[00:08:33] is $25 the average is
[00:08:36] 29 so there 20 actually 30 so I'm going
[00:08:40] to put it on for actually I'm going to

[02:34:45] between 1 and
[02:34:46] 10 these are not okay uh let me explain
[02:34:50] what it
[02:34:51] is we're doing a more like a virtual
[02:34:54] pole box okay um where you can see
[02:34:57] literally everything in it one two three
[02:34:59] four
[02:35:00] five grasping a long neck there you go
[02:35:03] my friend you can go and literally see
[02:35:07] every single thing listed in there all
[02:35:08] the prices of everything and I run it
[02:35:10] like kind of like a virtual pole box
[02:35:11] versus a um versus a
[02:35:15] break because um it allows you to see
[02:35:17] literally everything and
[02:35:21] also um you get to have the price of
[02:35:23] everything
[02:35:27] perfect oh oh oh oh oh yeah thank
[02:35:32] you let me
[02:35:35] um H oh happy birthday whose birthday is
[02:35:39] it oh congratulations happy birthday
[02:35:43] Tabitha happy birthday Tabitha I didn't
[02:35:46] see
[02:35:48] that well I hope you're having a good
[02:35:50] one today and you got some good plans
[02:35:52] any good plans for the
[02:35:54] day let's go out with a let's throw Miku
[02:35:56] out again let's try Miku somebody would
[02:35:58] like to try some am Miku and I'm gonna
[02:36:01] open this up and we'll see what we get
[02:36:09] here here we go my
[02:36:12] friend there we
[02:36:14] are let's see what you get here on
[02:36:17] these we have a bashel
[02:36:21] beasy underwater tunnel slimy aquarium
[02:36:24] emerg from the Cocoon Ripkin ripchain
[02:36:27] Razer kin fanatic of the
[02:36:30] harrowing we have a grand entryway
[02:36:33] elegant rotunda malevolent chandelier
[02:36:36] dusk M's
[02:36:38] domination
[02:36:39] what they put them both two of them
[02:36:41] together that's silly what come on a
[02:36:44] duplicate and it's not even like a good
[02:36:46] card it's an uncommon it's back to back
[02:36:48] come on guys put some effort in let's
[02:36:51] play a game that's not fun I guess Shard
[02:36:54] mjes rescue a l line of the Void all
[02:36:57] right not bad to pick up after that one
[02:36:59] an etch cornfield o and a vavas slir for
[02:37:02] a foil all right they made up for it a
[02:37:04] little bit they made up for a little bit
[02:37:06] a demon demon
[02:37:09] token yeah so that's kind of how the
[02:37:11] breakes are going they're not really
[02:37:12] braks they're more like a virtual pole
[02:37:13] box is what it is so for instance you
[02:37:16] would get anything that's in there it
[02:37:17] would randomly get assigned to you and
[02:37:19] you could potentially get the secret
[02:37:20] layer or any of the singles that you see
[02:37:22] in there and the nice thing is with that
[02:37:24] is with all those singles they are all
[02:37:25] literally listed out with their exact
[02:37:27] price so you don't even need to worry
[02:37:30] and wonder what some price of it is you
[02:37:31] literally get to see the exact price of
[02:37:34] what it is in the
[02:37:37] break so that's why I like to do it that
[02:37:39] way and it makes it a little bit nicer
[02:37:41] versus like doing a pole box and you
[02:37:42] can't see anything you don't know what's
[02:37:44] in it I can actually literally show you
[02:37:45] everything that's in it because of doing
[02:37:48] it the virtual way so that's why I kind
[02:37:50] of like doing that so you literally so
[02:37:52] for instance say you wanted to go and
[02:37:54] try your luck
[02:37:56] today on something like trying after
[02:37:58] only secret layer and some packs where
[02:38:01] the floor is
[02:38:03] $25 the ceiling is $33 I mean the
[02:38:06] ceiling is $70 and the average is
[02:38:10] $33.59 I'm going to throw this out here
[02:38:12] though for 31 to give you guys a chance
[02:38:14] to get secret layer and packs it's all
[02:38:16] collector boosters for secret layer
[02:38:20] all right all collector boosters or
[02:38:24] Peach
[02:38:26] momoko um monstrous
[02:38:28] magazine we have some dungeon dragons
[02:38:30] ones in there we have Ghostbusters ones
[02:38:33] in there we have Miku in
[02:38:46] there that's weird that it did that
[02:38:51] there you

[02:38:56] the low ones let's go after that um
[02:38:58] Ghostbusters again here let's go after
[02:39:01] that Ghostbusters for this there you go
[02:39:06] Ghostbuster there you go everybody try
[02:39:10] your luck sa Sav
[02:39:15] shade trying it here for the Ghostbuster
[02:39:18] one now you see is going to randomly
[02:39:20] assign you a spot now that spot will
[02:39:23] have a card or the pack so for instance
[02:39:27] you have a spy Master's
[02:39:29] vault which nope that was already pulled
[02:39:31] we have to randomize again that one was
[02:39:33] already pulled we have to randomize
[02:39:34] again so it's already pulled we do it
[02:39:36] again which gets you a second chance get
[02:39:38] a void
[02:39:42] Ren you get a void Ren
[02:39:51] void Ren there you go my
[02:39:55] friend because sometimes the cards have
[02:39:57] already been taken and if that happens
[02:39:59] you get a second chance that's pretty
[02:40:00] sweet savan
[02:40:03] shade Savon

[03:11:58] go see what we get in
[03:12:07] these we know what they are but I
[03:12:09] haven't seen them yet that's really what
[03:12:12] it PS down
[03:12:14] to all right our giveaways are going to
[03:12:16] go right there
[03:12:19] Slimer I like

[03:13:06] it me put them in sleeves
[03:13:11] here put those in sleeves and then we'll
[03:13:14] have to figure out what we can put make
[03:13:15] a deck with those to play with
[03:13:18] all
[03:13:19] righty
[03:13:21] well I
[03:13:24] think what we might do we're getting to
[03:13:26] that time where we normally would be
[03:13:28] doing our buyers giveaway because we
[03:13:32] have breaks that we do and because we've
[03:13:33] been doing a bunch of different virtual
[03:13:35] pole boxes I say we start one of them
[03:13:37] anyways while you hanging in
[03:13:41] here myoplasm yes I know I've been I've
[03:13:45] been told that Boomerang boom boom Myers
[03:13:47] Boomerang I don't know why I called you
[03:13:52] Boomerang using in your indominous Rex
[03:13:55] death deck nice because I have um I have
[03:13:59] my my Dino deck that I have has
[03:14:01] indominous rexs in
[03:14:11] it see that's see like I think this is

[03:14:19] going to come out and smoke
[03:14:21] people like that's a perfect card for my

[03:14:48] that they take out of another person you
[03:14:50] can even take too yes that's pretty

[03:14:56] now thank you come again sorry that's
[03:15:01] from a TV show I'm going to get yelled
[03:15:04] at for that one because they got rid of

[03:37:13] nonfoil or maybe you want the
[03:37:16] meiku maybe you'd like to try yourself
[03:37:18] with some meiku now remember if some of
[03:37:20] these have been pulled we run it we just
[03:37:22] randomize it again which gets you
[03:37:24] another chance of get in the ceiling so
[03:37:26] there you go it's actually a bonus to
[03:37:30] you so go check out those and see what
[03:37:34] we like here my
[03:37:36] friends all righty
[03:37:38] well we will run some of these a little
[03:37:41] bit
[03:37:43] more cuz this the virtual one allow me
[03:37:45] to have a bunch more than I can do with
[03:37:47] physical that's why I like to do them
[03:37:49] this
[03:37:51] way allows me to do like 10 of them
[03:37:54] where I can't have that
[03:37:57] many your ceiling is 80 floor is
[03:38:02] $6 and your average is$
[03:38:06] 1072 and we're going to throw out these
[03:38:10] here throw out these here yeah because
[03:38:12] we get like what I think it's like eight
[03:38:14] or nine different ones and I can even
[03:38:16] set different ones up every day too
[03:38:18] that's a nice thing that's why I like
[03:38:20] that but here we're going to try the
[03:38:22] monot to climb if you guys remember this
[03:38:25] one this one was a fun one where we
[03:38:29] uh star at the
[03:38:31] floor and you see if you can climb the
[03:38:34] tower to get to 20 Mana now what we do
[03:38:37] is I put a pack of cards out say I go
[03:38:40] all right we're going to grab out
[03:38:41] this modern Horizon 3 all right we're
[03:38:45] going to remove our Tower put that on
[03:38:47] Horizon 3 right
[03:38:49] there going to go like this I'm going to
[03:38:51] say start the auction at 12 you going
[03:38:54] hit this mon Horizon 3 and what we do is
[03:38:56] we open the mon Horizon 3 up and we open
[03:38:57] up face down I flip one cover card over
[03:38:59] at a
[03:39:00] time and if you get to the top which is
[03:39:05] 20 without falling
[03:39:08] off you win but if you
[03:39:11] fall you don't now if you win and you
[03:39:14] get to the top we do a bu giveaway of
[03:39:15] some kind if you do not and you fall
[03:39:18] well we end up giving uh we see what
[03:39:21] happens here but that was our yeah
[03:39:23] anybody wants to try that out there some
[03:39:26] days we have fun with those ones some
[03:39:27] days we don't but it seems like it's
[03:39:29] getting to that time of day where it
[03:39:31] slows down significantly
[03:39:34] so instead of um
[03:39:38] doing I think that's what it is might be
[03:39:41] actually I might be done like I normally
[03:39:43] am let's do this

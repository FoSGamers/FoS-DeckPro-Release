[00:08:41] four hey how's it going my friend I
[00:08:44] appreciate it
[00:08:46] benjin what do I think of The Lord of
[00:08:48] the Rings set well I personally was a
[00:08:50] giant fan of it because it brought me
[00:08:52] majorly back into magic I used to play a
[00:08:55] little bit and then um once that
[00:08:57] happened I was like oh wow this is
[00:08:58] really fun to bring in some of those and
[00:09:00] then I started playing more and I got
[00:09:01] into the other sets and uh and other
[00:09:04] tcgs even too so you know it's kind of
[00:09:06] one of those intriguing things
[00:09:07] here I don't know what you mean about
[00:09:09] the DK pole pack um
[00:09:12] life if you can ask me what you DK
[00:09:16] pole pack pole work I'm I'm confused on
[00:09:20] that dusk mourn are you talking about
[00:09:22] this like the um this if that's what
[00:09:26] you're talking about we have up here
[00:09:30] no right here it is sorry right here it
[00:09:33] tells you how many we have in here for
[00:09:35] how many we have for leftover collector
[00:09:37] boosters and play boosters and you
[00:09:38] literally just pick four numbers or I
[00:09:40] pick four cards for you from here and
[00:09:43] that's what it is it's literally what it
[00:09:44] is there if that's what you're looking
[00:09:46] for but here we go we're going to open
[00:09:47] this up and see if you guys want
[00:09:53] anything the pole box there that
[00:09:55] duskborn pole box is um as you can see
[00:09:58] there there were there's 107 of them
[00:10:01] available you get four things out of it
[00:10:03] four cards pulls out of it and in there
[00:10:06] is just a bunch of um bunch of other
[00:10:07] cards that does from Dorn and all the
[00:10:09] stuff that the sets Dorn and outlaws and
[00:10:11] some sets that are Miss in there mixed
[00:10:12] in there mainly foils nothing special or
[00:10:15] big but the big thing you're looking for
[00:10:16] is you got a bunch of play boosters
[00:10:18] there's a whole box of play boosters
[00:10:19] mixed in and a whole box of collector
[00:10:21] boosters that was mixed in there but um
[00:10:23] like I said that's uh so far what's left
[00:10:25] though some of the PS been done and
[00:10:26] there
[00:10:27] are eight collector boosters that was
[00:10:29] pulled and I mean three collector
[00:10:32] boosters that was pulled and uh 15 play
[00:10:34] boosters so that leaves you with what
[00:10:36] you know 11 uh 21 left of play boosters
[00:10:41] and nine collector boosters are left in
[00:10:44] there my math is
[00:10:47] right let's see what we get here I was a
[00:10:50] big fan of Lord of the Ring set though I
[00:10:52] will say that for you out in the YouTube

[00:49:44] up version of a
[00:49:49] ninja there yeah but there's more there
[00:49:51] was more than yeah there's more Marvel
[00:49:52] ones that were shown and released but
[00:49:54] I'm saying that people got leaked but
[00:49:56] I'm saying that one the Tony the one
[00:49:58] that was
[00:49:59] uh Iron Man it was like a souped up
[00:50:02] version of a ninja from when I was when

[00:50:57] personally I think that's why monoc
[00:50:59] Crypt and um Lotus got banned and the

[00:51:04] are coming out with Marvel that's going
[00:51:07] to take over like like the uh Stones you

[02:02:28] invalid there we go on those On's
[02:02:34] there going through our singles and you
[02:02:36] get to see whenever you cast an instant
[02:02:37] or sorcery spell put a Time counter on

[02:25:27] go use the rest room then uh grab where
[02:25:29] my drink
[02:25:33] was flood Farm Burge coming at you my
[02:25:36] friends and this one is the

[02:25:41] version for you if you would like and
[02:25:44] that going out at 11 doll hairs
[02:25:54] 11 doll
[02:25:56] hairs yeah buy that boat for me exactly
[02:25:59] true bits well You' be able I'll be able
[02:26:00] to get the exact one I want at that
[02:26:02] point we won't have to be looking for
[02:26:03] these used ones instead of like see like
[02:26:05] I have we have enough money to buy a
[02:26:07] decent used one but we don't want to I
[02:26:09] don't want to sell the stock in the
[02:26:11] company that I own so I can buy a good
[02:26:13] like one that's a new one I want to buy
[02:26:14] the new one that I want that makes any
[02:26:16] sense I don't want to just get a new one
[02:26:18] and be like all right I got a new one I
[02:26:20] want to get the new one that I want so
[02:26:21] I'll wait until they sell the company
[02:26:23] sells that way I have the money to do
[02:26:28] it all right here we go no one wanted
[02:26:32] flood Farm well now that's a surprise
[02:26:35] I'll put that one in the buy now someone
[02:26:36] will end up getting
[02:26:38] it yeah exactly at least for me right
[02:26:41] now it kind of is like the problem right
[02:26:42] now that we're running into is uh the
[02:26:45] boat price range that we're looking at
[02:26:47] because it's the
[02:26:50] the uh people during covid spent more
[02:26:54] money on boats than they probably should
[02:26:57] have because they don't know anything
[02:26:59] about them and they also
[02:27:02] um they also are
[02:27:08] uh spent more than they should
[02:27:10] have just because it was Co and they and
[02:27:13] so they inflated their price of things
[02:27:14] and they don't know they are like trying
[02:27:16] to sell them for the price to get their
[02:27:17] money back and I'm like the boats you're
[02:27:19] not going to sell the boat for the same
[02:27:20] price that it was bought
[02:27:22] for and with all kinds of issues wrong
[02:27:25] with it if it was a brand it it was like
[02:27:27] all in perfect condition yeah maybe but
[02:27:29] you have all kinds of issues and it's a
[02:27:30] 15-year-old boat no sorry good
[02:27:38] luck yeah exactly eventually somebody's
[02:27:41] going to be like yeah all right somebody
[02:27:42] will get rid R eventually and they'll
[02:27:43] get rid of for the right price but for
[02:27:45] me I'm like I'm not going to I'm not
[02:27:46] playing the game some people have been
[02:27:48] trying to I'm like I give my off offer
[02:27:50] and I'm like here you go this is what
[02:27:51] you're going to
[02:27:52] get and if um if you're happy with it
[02:27:55] you're happy with it you're not you're
[02:27:56] not and I've walked I already bought a
[02:27:58] boat before um I've bought boats I've
[02:28:01] bought cars houses sold houses people
[02:28:05] like you're not going to do it that
[02:28:06] price that's not going to happen I'm
[02:28:07] like yeah it is and then what happens
[02:28:09] literally sold the house at the price
[02:28:11] that everybody's like that's not going
[02:28:12] to you're not going to sell at that
[02:28:12] price I'm like yes it is well all the
[02:28:14] other houses in the area are this Mount
[02:28:16] I'm like yeah but they're not my brand
[02:28:17] and my Builder you're not going to get
[02:28:19] it mine for that price and ours sold in
[02:28:22] a day I actually probably put put could
[02:28:25] have put it up a little bit more but I
[02:28:26] wanted it gone and people like oh wow
[02:28:29] that's sold quick I'm like yeah because
[02:28:30] I know what I'm doing the other people
[02:28:31] that were like friends of ours that were
[02:28:32] Realtors like wow that sold so quick we
[02:28:35] didn't think that was going to sell that
[02:28:36] quick I'm like well it's because you
[02:28:38] don't factor in other things you factor
[02:28:40] in like your real Tre experience I
[02:28:43] factor in like between the math the
[02:28:47] science the
[02:28:48] location the there's all kinds of stuff
[02:28:51] that go to it that people think about
[02:28:52] that aren't
[02:28:53] Realtors so I use the realtor thought
[02:28:56] process and thought process of of me
[02:28:59] plus you know I ask my wife some
[02:29:01] information get some of
[02:29:04] hers we ended up walking away with
[02:29:06] everything sold very easily and people
[02:29:08] are shocked like well it's because our
[02:29:10] house was a
[02:29:12] solid
[02:29:14] um was a cement house you want one of
[02:29:17] those in
[02:29:19] Florida all the other ones were
[02:29:21] stick you don't want those in
[02:29:24] Florida so the person that knows what
[02:29:26] they're buying for a house knows what
[02:29:27] our house is if that makes any
[02:29:30] sense so that's why they walk our sold
[02:29:33] for the price it did at that quick
[02:29:35] because they realized our house can
[02:29:36] pretty much it's got a metal roof it's
[02:29:39] got the metal roof it's got the um this
[02:29:41] is non-foil by the way it's got a metal
[02:29:43] roof it's got a like it's all you know
[02:29:45] like I said it was cement um so like
[02:29:48] there's nothing there's you could
[02:29:49] withstand like I think it was cat five
[02:29:51] almost hurricane we wind speeds with all
[02:29:54] the stuff that we had on
[02:29:55] there so that's why people want that
[02:29:57] house and it's an area that had never
[02:29:59] flooded nice pickup
[02:30:01] Ram so that's what people
[02:30:04] do they pay attention where they oh well
[02:30:08] the other houses in the area are this
[02:30:09] I'm like yeah it doesn't matter those
[02:30:10] other houses are all made out of wood
[02:30:11] ours isn't it's a different that's not
[02:30:14] the same
[02:30:15] thing right let's go with a constricted
[02:30:18] persistent constrictor
[02:30:28] there we
[02:30:30] go you want one of
[02:30:32] those angle that a little bit so the
[02:30:34] light is
[02:30:35] better there you
[02:30:38] go that price is a dollar it looks like
[02:30:41] we'll go with oh no not even on the
[02:30:43] right
[02:30:45] one here you
[02:30:47] go for the constrictor
[02:30:50] but yeah you wait and you get the you'll
[02:30:51] get the right one at the right time
[02:30:52] people just will fig they'll take some
[02:30:54] time for some people to figure it out
[02:30:55] but
[02:30:57] whatever they're already dropping I keep
[02:30:59] laughing because some of the boats have
[02:31:01] have already dropped and I'm like if
[02:31:02] they like I had passed on some of them
[02:31:05] or looked at some of them I'm like that
[02:31:06] boat's too high I'm like are you guys
[02:31:07] willing to negotiate no no we don't want
[02:31:09] to this is the price that we're going
[02:31:10] for I'm like all right and um they've
[02:31:13] already kept they've dropped 30 grand 20
[02:31:16] grand one of them dropped 60 Grand I'm
[02:31:19] like all right well another another
[02:31:20] month you're going to drop another 10 to
[02:31:21] 20 grand so and it'll be the price that
[02:31:23] I offered originally so thank you
[02:31:26] ram like so why why are you just why
[02:31:28] does everybody giv you any a hard time
[02:31:29] why don't you just do it do it
[02:31:33] now now things in the buy now they were
[02:31:35] priced recently so sometimes the prices
[02:31:37] update and change now single sales they
[02:31:40] are all final that should be in the show
[02:31:43] notes um
[02:32:12] all
[02:32:15] right yeah well it's a big purchase
[02:32:17] exactly I'm not going to go and buy
[02:32:18] something like people go and be
[02:32:19] impulsive on things and I'm impulsive in
[02:32:22] certain ways but not like
[02:32:25] this
[02:32:29] like I
[02:32:32] um which one is this
[02:32:35] one this is a number 3
[02:32:39] 364 so like when we came to buying any
[02:32:42] vehicles or anything like that I've
[02:32:44] either bought and sold everything I've
[02:32:46] bought something and I almost every time
[02:32:48] I've sold it at this close to the same
[02:32:49] price or more than what I bought it
[02:32:52] for so people always are like how did
[02:32:55] you pull that off or how do you do that
[02:32:57] like well I did it
[02:33:00] because I didn't go and jump on the
[02:33:02] first thing immediately I I literally
[02:33:04] walked away from four people before I
[02:33:06] found
[02:33:07] it that's
[02:33:10] why there's no problem walking away and
[02:33:12] saying no people seem to have a problem
[02:33:14] in this world with saying no I'm not
[02:33:15] being rude I'm not being disrespect I'm
[02:33:17] like no I'm sorry that's not going to
[02:33:18] work for me here's my reason if you want
[02:33:20] to hear it but most of the time people
[02:33:23] don't all right there throw this one out
[02:33:25] for a dollar if you like it come back
[02:33:27] wrong in the
[02:33:39] Showcase there we go all right Ram put
[02:33:43] that in with your other ones
[02:33:50] all righty there we
[02:33:54] go working about winter I don't need
[02:33:57] that one I was thinking about it but I
[02:34:00] don't need
[02:34:04] it
[02:34:07] what
[02:34:12] ah it's not in here oh it is it is it is
[02:34:17] it is it is it is it is it is there you
[02:34:19] you go winter for doll oh you baloney me
[02:34:24] there you
[02:34:25] go yeah but I got I mean I got my plan
[02:34:27] we know what we're looking for um one of
[02:34:30] the boats we just asked him how about
[02:34:31] we'll wait and see if there's any um
[02:34:33] anything going with it maybe we'll get
[02:34:35] some luck on it I don't know one of them
[02:34:37] coming up here but I don't think so
[02:34:39] because we haven't had a response
[02:34:41] generally when you don't get a response
[02:34:42] is because they put it on the market and
[02:34:43] they are uh either already have it
[02:34:46] checked somebody already bought it and
[02:34:48] it's just not been taken off or or
[02:34:52] um they don't really want to sell it
[02:34:54] which what I feel like there sometimes
[02:34:56] people just don't want to sell it but
[02:34:57] they put it on the
[02:34:58] market I don't if that makes any
[02:35:02] sense there you go $2 for the
[02:35:06] foil I can rerun Toby
[02:35:11] yeah um I'm G I'll find it I'll rerun it
[02:35:14] right after this okay

[02:35:27] there you go nobody does Toby think it

[02:35:42] dollar there you go death
[02:35:46] dreamer

[02:42:05] together there John we put a couple of
[02:42:07] them together because so they don't
[02:42:08] slide out I haven't had a chance to do
[02:42:10] any of them uh anything like that
[02:42:12] recently my kids have at a lot of
[02:42:13] sporting events so we didn't get a
[02:42:15] chance to do any
[02:42:20] I'm guessing that I'm going to be in a
[02:42:22] similar s soon because they're going to
[02:42:25] be starting Sports again they yeah they
[02:42:28] both actually long story short they both
[02:42:29] actually decided to quit the team they
[02:42:30] were on uh we supported them I never do
[02:42:33] win that comes to that but this
[02:42:34] situation was a little
[02:42:36] different uh my youngest has was is
[02:42:39] exceptionally good for some reason at
[02:42:40] soccer and um he had been asked to play
[02:42:46] up on the older kids team multiple times
[02:42:48] over multiple years years because they
[02:42:51] needed help because they didn't have
[02:42:54] enough people to play in the
[02:42:55] game or um they did and they needed
[02:42:58] people to uh you know for subbing in and
[02:43:00] stuff like that well every time he went
[02:43:02] and played they ended up playing him the
[02:43:03] entire game because he was so good they
[02:43:04] were he was better than their players
[02:43:06] so now uh you know people take over and
[02:43:10] they happen to be instead of um people
[02:43:12] that are like unaffiliated with parents
[02:43:15] they are now parents now all of a sudden
[02:43:17] my son will no longer play much's going
[02:43:18] to be on the B Team not done to be able
[02:43:21] to play well so he said he said I don't
[02:43:22] want to do this anymore after the I
[02:43:24] think it was the third this would be
[02:43:25] pretty much the third time they dick him
[02:43:27] around in three years I was like all
[02:43:29] right buddy I don't disagree with you
[02:43:31] here I think I'll let you go he decide
[02:43:34] and he said okay and then my older my
[02:43:36] older son sitting right next to him at
[02:43:37] the same time said I'm quitting too if
[02:43:39] they're going to bully my brother I'm
[02:43:41] going to go with him and I'm leaving I
[02:43:43] was like you know what bud I appreciate
[02:43:44] that I think that was that was actually
[02:43:45] a really big moment I think for him
[02:43:47] showing his strength for his and not
[02:43:49] even caring about the other stuff he
[02:43:50] didn't care about anybody he was playing
[02:43:52] with or maybe have been friends like no
[02:43:53] they're going to dick around my brother
[02:43:55] I'm not going to be on anything like
[02:43:56] that there you go rip
[02:44:00] spawn put
[02:44:02] out a Demolisher
[02:44:05] spawn I what do you guys think good
[02:44:08] choice should I have let him done that I
[02:44:10] don't
[02:44:15] know what would you have done pretty
[02:44:18] much over three years we had been at
[02:44:20] every game every practice he had been at
[02:44:22] it um he had pretty much never missed
[02:44:26] anything unless he was sick one time um
[02:44:32] the when people couldn't play their
[02:44:34] positions he'd always fall back and take
[02:44:36] over he played positions he didn't
[02:44:38] necessarily want to because no one
[02:44:39] wanted no one on the team would because
[02:44:41] they kept going and playing different
[02:44:42] ones he um moved up many times to
[02:44:46] different teams to help as needed
[02:44:48] between different ones cuz he was so
[02:44:49] young he could play on the lowest Team
[02:44:50] all the way highest so he would
[02:44:51] fluctuate all the way highest because he
[02:44:52] was so good he would fluctuate between
[02:44:55] teams as needed so the teams wouldn't
[02:44:56] have to go forfeit they actually put
[02:44:59] them on like all teams one year for that
[02:45:01] reason um but now all of a sudden when
[02:45:03] they have like the new people in there
[02:45:05] that are
[02:45:06] parents yeah I did break pack during the
[02:45:10] stream here these are all actually from
[02:45:11] them from earlier in the Stream I broke
[02:45:13] these all that's actually all came out
[02:45:14] of there so
[02:45:22] really up to the
[02:45:26] player oh
[02:45:31] yeah well he wants to go to a different
[02:45:33] uh Club he doesn't want to stop playing
[02:45:35] period he's like I want to quit I'm
[02:45:36] going to a different place so there was
[02:45:38] a couple different clubs that had
[02:45:39] offered him to actually play because he
[02:45:41] had went over because we had been
[02:45:42] associated with one a couple of them a
[02:45:44] couple times for over a couple years and
[02:45:47] he had um they had asked him to go help
[02:45:49] over there because like hey we we're low
[02:45:50] on players can you come and help during
[02:45:52] this tournament or something like that
[02:45:53] and he's like yeah sure because he would
[02:45:54] love to people loves playing
[02:45:56] soccer so we uh we had brought him over
[02:45:59] and both of those teams were like yeah
[02:46:00] he has he has a spot here we'll just
[02:46:02] have him try out soccer um or football
[02:46:05] football depending on where you
[02:46:08] are there a foil enduring
[02:46:13] curiosity yeah so like he he's going to
[02:46:16] play on it well he has we already have a
[02:46:18] couple triout set up pretty much for
[02:46:19] other teams but
[02:46:22] um I don't know I thought we made the
[02:46:25] right choice allowing him to do that
[02:46:26] just because it was one of those
[02:46:27] scenarios where he uh oh crap luckily
[02:46:31] it's only on the box
[02:46:34] there ah I'll I'll let you take care of
[02:46:36] your bank thing normally it's one of
[02:46:37] those scenarios where it's like uh at
[02:46:39] least for me I never I would never let I
[02:46:42] would never quit anything
[02:46:44] before um and I've actually never quit
[02:46:46] anything before but I've never run into
[02:46:47] the scenario with him where they did
[02:46:49] they put him up to a team they moved him
[02:46:51] down to a team they actually put him on
[02:46:53] the lowest team at one point this year
[02:46:55] and we were like why is he on like the
[02:46:56] like the youngest team and the lowest
[02:46:59] level team he's like that's not going to
[02:47:01] help him develop at all and then they
[02:47:03] like go well don't we're not going to
[02:47:04] move him based on what parents say
[02:47:07] so we didn't like we're not saying move
[02:47:10] him but at least don't put him where he
[02:47:13] belongs based on his resp on his ability
[02:47:16] that's all we ask
[02:47:19] like he's able to beat all the players
[02:47:20] on the other
[02:47:21] team all the time like literally put it
[02:47:24] this way their best defensive person and
[02:47:27] some of their best offensive person
[02:47:28] people he has meged to get goals as a
[02:47:32] nine-year-old
[02:47:37] kid so that's what's happened with
[02:47:42] him all right we're going to go in and
[02:47:44] we're going to do some other stuff
[02:47:46] from different place so I'm like if he
[02:47:49] can do that and beat them why is he uh
[02:47:52] why is he sitting here like why are they
[02:47:53] telling him he can't go and play it's my
[02:47:55] question why do you have to go that
[02:47:57] seems like a weird weird thing to say to
[02:47:59] me but that's you know my opinion also
[02:48:01] being a father at the same time other
[02:48:04] parents made the comment have made
[02:48:06] comments too about him being one of the
[02:48:09] best if not the
[02:48:10] best he was the only one actually to get
[02:48:12] a goal not out by accident in their last
[02:48:17] game and his other 9-year-old that plays
[02:48:21] with him has been playing from three
[02:48:22] years they're like no don't do the
[02:48:24] corner kick they wanted one of the other
[02:48:25] kids the older kids that are the good
[02:48:26] ones that they know what they're doing
[02:48:27] to play and do the corner kick so that
[02:48:30] older one went and said no's like no let
[02:48:32] me do it and they like fine whatever the
[02:48:34] coach because the coach I don't think
[02:48:35] wants him there because I think it's his
[02:48:36] age issue well he literally drilled the
[02:48:39] corner kick to his friend that he' been
[02:48:42] playing with for three years into a goal
[02:48:44] the cleanest goal that team has seen in
[02:48:47] all of their games
[02:48:49] but my son is not good enough to be
[02:48:52] there so I I give up on those things and
[02:48:55] I I start and I like all right I'll
[02:48:57] allow you to move buddy I understand
[02:48:58] what you're saying
[02:49:00] now like well he has to show that he can
[02:49:02] do certain things and he's shown them
[02:49:04] every single time and I don't think they
[02:49:05] like
[02:49:06] that I think that's personally what it
[02:49:08] is they don't like being most people
[02:49:10] don't like being shown that they were
[02:49:11] wrong that's most likely what it
[02:49:16] is oil etched if you want one of of
[02:49:28] these payment should work now if it did
[02:49:30] that wrong for OD I should have knew ah
[02:49:32] no worries buddy no
[02:49:36] worries yeah that sounds like that too
[02:49:39] uh put it this way the one of the board
[02:49:41] members children is on the team as a
[02:49:43] young one and he's allowed to be on that
[02:49:44] team there's no problem with him yet my
[02:49:47] son can't be
[02:49:52] yeah
[02:49:53] politics I did see that go through kg
[02:49:56] don't worry about a
[02:49:57] bud uh if you buy more than one single
[02:50:00] shipping won't it won't continue to add
[02:50:03] eventually you'll get to the point where
[02:50:04] it's considered like a a pack of cards
[02:50:06] in a way and it gets shipped with I
[02:50:08] think it's like four or five dollar
[02:50:10] worth of um I think it's like that maybe
[02:50:14] is that is once you get up to like I
[02:50:15] think once you get up to like three
[02:50:17] cards is when it turns over to being
[02:50:20] like
[02:50:20] that
[02:50:22] Ram nice pick up there so yeah the more
[02:50:26] cards you get it will it won't like keep
[02:50:27] adding them over and over and over for
[02:50:29] the shipping eventually it'll get to one
[02:50:30] shipping level and it will like stop but
[02:50:33] I can't remember what it
[02:50:36] is I think guess once you buy three it
[02:50:39] will stay like that there you go Ram
[02:50:42] nice one on
[02:50:43] that let's see what else we got o here
[02:50:46] we go there's something that someone
[02:50:48] might
[02:50:59] like ulog the ceases
[02:51:02] hunger there you go now this is what I'm
[02:51:06] going to do here I'm going to run this
[02:51:08] one and I can't it's got to go at the
[02:51:11] where it's a pack all right but because
[02:51:14] I mean like it's shipped like with
[02:51:15] shipping like it's a pack like it's a
[02:51:17] packaged with shipping not a full not an
[02:51:19] see because what happens is the um
[02:51:22] anything under $20 gets shipped in one
[02:51:23] of these in a top loader all right
[02:51:25] that's why it's so cheap for the
[02:51:26] shipping now if you get anything over 20
[02:51:28] it ships in the regular like padded
[02:51:30] envelope 20 are over so that's what it
[02:51:32] is here that's what I'm trying to say
[02:51:33] and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
[02:51:35] put a little discount on so instead of
[02:51:36] it being $24 or $23 whatever it is there
[02:51:41] $20 for ulog ceases
[02:51:46] hunger yeah clown baby I'd have to say
[02:51:48] the same thing it's a little bit of
[02:51:50] politics going on I mean um it's funny
[02:51:53] because he can beat all of the players
[02:51:54] literally all of them and everything
[02:51:55] he's put up against him with um they
[02:51:58] actually get pissed at him he he beats
[02:52:00] them so frequently to stop them whenever
[02:52:02] they try to go by him they cannot get by
[02:52:03] him in certain on of the like any of the
[02:52:05] practice things and they get pissed at
[02:52:06] him to the point that some of them even
[02:52:08] try to push him and luckily as a his age
[02:52:12] at the nine-year-old he's a big kid he's
[02:52:14] like half their SI like more than like
[02:52:16] he's bigger than some of the kids that
[02:52:17] are on their team even
[02:52:20] so
[02:52:21] like like he's literally as a
[02:52:23] nine-year-old sometimes he's bigger than
[02:52:25] like probably four kids on their
[02:52:30] team so like and they try to do that and
[02:52:32] he pushes him right back I I saw knock
[02:52:34] one of them over more than
[02:52:41] once yeah exactly well that's what the
[02:52:43] problem is we need to get someone
[02:52:44] that'll see that rather than play the
[02:52:45] politics so that's why we're trying to
[02:52:46] couple teams out one of them I know
[02:52:49] we've he he's played with before
[02:52:51] frequently because they had asked for
[02:52:52] help over the years um when he was I
[02:52:55] think it was last year the year before
[02:52:56] he had played with them like three or
[02:52:57] four times he's intrigued with playing
[02:52:59] with them but there's a couple of his
[02:53:00] friends went from this team over to uh
[02:53:03] another one near us and we were debating
[02:53:06] on L and there too because he goes can I
[02:53:07] go over and play with them because he
[02:53:10] those other ones were they were actually
[02:53:12] good
[02:53:13] players and there was a couple of people
[02:53:16] that had been in this area for like I
[02:53:19] guess decades to as a coach um and my in
[02:53:24] at this at this uh League where my son
[02:53:26] was and they ended up um like I guess
[02:53:28] kicking him out so they got kind of
[02:53:30] pissed about that and that I guess
[02:53:31] that's part of the reason why some of
[02:53:32] the people left and I didn't realize
[02:53:34] that until later like well no wonder why
[02:53:36] a few of those people left and moved
[02:53:37] over they they were frustrated how they
[02:53:39] they say they can make it better it
[02:53:40] doesn't seem like they did they're
[02:53:41] making it their own way is what it is
[02:53:44] and everybody thinks their own way is
[02:53:45] better is really what it boils down to
[02:53:48] now this is a $9 card coming at
[02:53:51] you you know everybody's way is always
[02:53:54] better
[02:53:56] öa and the Showcase but yeah there's a
[02:54:00] couple places that already know him so
[02:54:02] luckily with them already knowing him we
[02:54:05] don't have to worry about too much one
[02:54:07] of them's like yeah he's got his face on
[02:54:08] the team already your your older son we
[02:54:10] just need to see him play to know where
[02:54:11] he where he goes all right cool sounds
[02:54:14] good like so I'm not too too worried
[02:54:16] about it
[02:54:20] all right let's put out a
[02:54:22] um I don't know what these ones
[02:54:29] are let's
[02:54:35] see let's put out a rare white border
[02:54:53] you go lay
[02:54:57] line oh come on come
[02:55:03] on this is Mystery booster
[02:55:07] 2 mystery booster 2 yes this is what
[02:55:10] this is this is the white border of
[02:55:12] mystery booster
[02:55:13] 2
[02:55:16] correct I go pretty pretty close to
[02:55:18] market price uh just because it
[02:55:20] fluctuates so much but yeah pretty much
[02:55:23] sometimes a little lower depending on
[02:55:24] the
[02:55:26] cards if you notied like if it's a
[02:55:28] higher price one I try to give a few
[02:55:30] bucks off to help with shipping and
[02:55:32] stuff but generally I do new near like
[02:55:36] a give or take a
[02:55:41] dollar see
[02:55:56] [Music]
[02:56:08] let's put this
[02:56:12] out put that out right there
[02:56:18] problem is you can't really do much with
[02:56:21] uh the pricing here it has to stay at a
[02:56:24] certain one you can't like fluctuate it
[02:56:25] around you only have dollar values you
[02:56:27] can go
[02:56:28] between it's like I'll throw this out
[02:56:31] here you know it's not going to be
[02:56:32] exactly market price it'll be a little
[02:56:34] lower will'll be on for oh no no no not
[02:56:38] that amount why is it doing that there
[02:56:40] for two instead of
[02:56:41] 230 force of vigor Outlaws of Thunder
[02:56:46] oo I don't know
[02:56:52] force of
[02:57:05] vigor I might I'm have to look for that
[02:57:10] though I going have to look for that one
[02:57:13] I don't know where that is right now off
[02:57:14] the top of my head I'm still going
[02:57:17] through some of my singles to get things
[02:57:18] in so I
[02:57:23] might it is a nice one it is a good one
[02:57:25] let me see if I can find if I can find
[02:57:27] it I'll figure out if I can get it in
[02:57:29] there for you but um I I don't
[02:57:35] know Viger I feel like I have it
[02:57:40] though I feel like I have it I just
[02:57:43] maybe I pulled it out recently or
[02:57:44] something I don't know you're goingon to
[02:57:46] have to give me uh some time to figure
[02:57:47] that out
[02:57:54] there you
[02:57:55] go for that one why does I keep doing
[02:57:58] that price I don't want to that price
[02:58:00] hard that
[02:58:04] way
[02:58:05] there galta Primal bigger
[02:58:33] put a couple of different ones out
[02:58:35] there Ram likes
[02:58:38] that hey well you know what you got a

[03:30:39] interested again that that actually
[03:30:40] would be a nice one to do I'd like to do
[03:30:41] some we like time
[03:30:43] spiral we like time spiral here
[03:30:51] [Music]
[03:30:57] what I'm not frozen I'm shocked I'm
[03:31:00] sorry
[03:31:03] what you want to repeat that like
[03:31:06] seriously
[03:31:09] like you you meant like another zero on
[03:31:12] the end at least right
[03:31:21] what that doesn't make
[03:31:24] sense was this like a
[03:31:29] uh some mom was mad and sold someone's
[03:31:32] cards yeah that sounds about right did
[03:31:34] did
[03:31:35] that uh was this like a yard sale
[03:31:38] thing cuz that's insane
[03:31:56] we go
[03:31:57] [Music]
[03:32:00] everyone
[03:32:01] wow garage sale oh that's insane oh
[03:32:07] wow you guys are so lucky when you find
[03:32:09] those things I never find anything
[03:32:11] around here with that I should start
[03:32:12] going and looking
[03:32:13] more I need to go garage sing around
[03:32:16] here because there's a lot of not going
[03:32:17] to be mean there's a lot of old people
[03:32:19] in Florida and they die frequently I'm
[03:32:22] not trying to be mean it's just a fact
[03:32:25] it happens
[03:32:27] so I should go start looking around at
[03:32:29] these sales when they have and see if
[03:32:31] they have any cards like that that would
[03:32:32] be crazy to pick up
[03:32:35] those all right nobody wanted a cranco
[03:32:38] but the cranco is a top loader worthy
[03:32:42] so
[03:32:44] wow the land of this snowbirds
[03:32:51] yes no I'm not going to get rid of that
[03:32:57] one not going to get rid of that one not
[03:32:59] that
[03:33:00] one let's
[03:33:09] see I put this one out
[03:33:23] all right that's the list card I guess
[03:33:25] is what it
[03:33:26] is H all right we'll throw it on for a
[03:33:28] dollar there that's not right I said a
[03:33:32] dollar yeah the land of
[03:33:38] snowbirds oh I'm going to keep that one
[03:33:41] I might keep that one too
[03:33:43] damn can't keep all of them
[03:33:52] oh
[03:33:54] no can't keep them all that's the
[03:33:57] problem I'm looking at him going oh I
[03:33:59] like that one oh I like that one I I
[03:34:00] like that
[03:34:01] one I need to decide what I got to do
[03:34:11] here we can do this one we can do that
[03:34:13] one we'll do a future site
[03:34:16] echo of
[03:34:26] eons there you go how about an echo of
[03:34:31] eons now the market price as you can see
[03:34:36] there averages that so there you go it's
[03:34:40] a good deal saying that s for gener
[03:34:42] around 18
[03:34:45] or more so there you are $13 and it's a
[03:34:49] dollar for shipping about and I'm going
[03:34:51] to put that one in a top
[03:34:54] loader cuz over 10 it deserves to be a
[03:34:59] top
[03:35:01] loader let's
[03:35:11] see I'm going to put this out
[03:35:30] rights
[03:35:36] history
[03:35:39] G dang it got the wrong
[03:35:42] one there you go

[03:40:37] this is our family one we're going to
[03:40:38] keep everything out of here specifically
[03:40:41] but should we do this as a live on

[03:40:57] and move though that allows you to move
[03:40:59] around and do things

[03:41:23] of things like move some stuff from
[03:41:24] shelf to shelf type stuff and help out
[03:41:26] but you just can't move all the big

[00:00:47] everybody doing this uh wonderful
[00:00:50] evening we uh we got something a little
[00:00:52] different so um what we have going
[00:00:55] on is being that
[00:00:58] um
[00:01:08] what I
[00:01:13] was we going to put these ones as our
[00:01:17] uh PS for whoever ends up coming on the
[00:01:21] low
[00:01:23] side of our game we'll get to choose one
[00:01:25] of these ones now if I remember whenever
[00:01:28] you open these These are little ier
[00:01:31] stuff in them than normal I mean this
[00:01:33] one I think it had like some 70s type
[00:01:35] that's not supposed to be there 70s type
[00:01:38] posters same thing with that like you
[00:01:40] know those 80s you know beastman type
[00:01:41] posters same thing with I don't know I
[00:01:43] can't remember that one that one might
[00:01:44] have just been an interesting one that
[00:01:46] you guys would like that one I think had
[00:01:48] some of those interesting ones that one
[00:01:49] definitely did this one we know is an
[00:01:52] interesting one here um you know our
[00:01:55] heavy metal one there and uh then this
[00:01:57] was our one that we didn't get to the
[00:01:59] other day
[00:02:00] so what we have is um anybody that hits
[00:02:03] one of the floors what you get a choice
[00:02:06] of first we're going to start out where
[00:02:07] we going to go from kind of like the top
[00:02:09] down here all the way to whoever who
[00:02:11] happens to be the last one with the
[00:02:12] floor will end up with this one here so
[00:02:14] I think the amount of floors if I had
[00:02:16] them right were uh correct here so
[00:02:19] that's how we're going to be doing that
[00:02:21] giving you guys the opportunity to have
[00:02:22] some fun this uh this evening here with
[00:02:26] us now Rie how you doing thanks for
[00:02:28] coming in hanging out hey Jason how you
[00:02:31] doing bud thanks for coming in I don't
[00:02:33] normally do these in the evening but
[00:02:35] uh I figured today we um got nothing
[00:02:40] going on and the kids have done their
[00:02:41] thing we're going to hang out for a
[00:02:42] little while try the Easter egg cun
[00:02:44] thing again since we've got more of them
[00:02:46] if you guys wanted to try it out it was
[00:02:47] pretty fun last time uh so freig try it
[00:02:50] again and like I said now there's the uh
[00:02:53] for those that come in and get their low
[00:02:55] or the floor they'll get a choice of
[00:02:57] those other packs there which is a kind
[00:02:58] of cool
[00:03:02] that's why I was doing it there because
[00:03:03] I can't do do those ones in the morning
[00:03:05] or in the evening when my kids are
[00:03:06] around I have to do them at night
[00:03:08] because I you know you don't want to be
[00:03:10] like oh what's that Daddy what's that
[00:03:11] Daddy well I can't tell you what that is
[00:03:13] yet well I can but let's not talk about
[00:03:15] that right now but those are the
[00:03:19] uh what are you
[00:03:23] doing can see everything what can you
[00:03:28] see
[00:03:43] really that makes no
[00:03:47] sense because I'm literally looking at
[00:03:49] them all right now I'm on I'm on the
[00:03:53] tablet here which is well it's Apple I
[00:03:55] wonder if that's why the difference is
[00:03:56] is M I'm looking at an i an Apple
[00:03:59] product that's why I can see all of
[00:04:02] it that is so
[00:04:04] weird okay give me a second here give me
[00:04:08] a second can I see keep hold that
[00:04:09] actually let me hold that for a second I
[00:04:12] didn't I didn't know that you couldn't
[00:04:13] see all that on the Android let me
[00:04:15] address that for you that is interesting
[00:04:18] all right give me one second here
[00:04:23] everyone give me one second here
[00:04:28] everyone
[00:04:32] let's do
[00:04:35] that do
[00:04:39] that
[00:04:42] right now we can
[00:04:49] see basket kind of there oh can't even
[00:04:52] see the basket off that is so weird okay
[00:04:55] then well let's do
[00:04:58] this
[00:05:07] hold on let's try that
[00:05:09] now now I think that is
[00:05:12] everything that is everything now all
[00:05:15] right I cut a little bit over on the
[00:05:18] side
[00:05:20] here bring bring it
[00:05:23] down what do you
[00:05:25] mean no don't worry about it they can
[00:05:27] you can slide that over ready
[00:05:31] okay all right you guys can see
[00:05:32] everything now all right thank you on
[00:05:35] Android now Apple I was unaware that you
[00:05:37] guys couldn't see everything that's
[00:05:38] crazy like that all right let's I got
[00:05:40] that fixed now I'm sorry guys hopefully
[00:05:43] you guys can see that all
[00:05:47] better yeah maybe the iPad does have a
[00:05:50] different display than the phone maybe
[00:05:51] that's what the problem was there all
[00:05:52] right guys well hey you know what I
[00:05:54] think I got it set now that um that
[00:05:55] everybody even with Android can see it

[00:18:46] you get the art one the art things that
[00:18:48] are part of the comic book that you're

[00:22:17] them out for you all of our options that
[00:22:19] we got
[00:22:27] here
[00:22:32] huh some of the some of the art ones
[00:22:34] comes out um and they U they're pretty
[00:22:38] much their nipples are covered
[00:22:43] by yep yeah that's why they're that's
[00:22:46] why we call them the adult version
[00:22:48] that's literally the reason
[00:22:52] why because uh yeah that's
[00:22:57] why
[00:22:59] here you go all right so here's your
[00:23:02] Originals we got some of these for The
[00:23:06] Originals you got some Thunderbirds
[00:23:09] Anastasia Hunchback some election
[00:23:12] 92 Wildlife New Kids on the Block some
[00:23:16] skateboarding got two of those some
[00:23:18] aidian again that game creators Indiana
[00:23:21] Jones Legacy comic book another
[00:23:25] creators another New Kids on the Block
[00:23:27] we got a Maverick and then a Dick
[00:23:34] Tracy adult yes so the reason why I said
[00:23:38] adult is because literally um the ending
[00:23:40] people that are the lows end up getting
[00:23:42] these cards and they have the uh the
[00:23:44] more inappropriate ones especially the
[00:23:46] one like this which I have not opened
[00:23:48] yet whoever is will be the last low is
[00:23:51] going to get that there so that's where
[00:23:53] the adult aspect of uh tonight comes in
[00:23:57] here Legacy comic all right I like it
[00:24:00] Legacy it is right there I'll put that
[00:24:03] one down there's the adult ones there
[00:24:06] and let's get uh let's get our stuff
[00:24:08] ripped open for you all right so yeah if
[00:24:11] you yeah so now now that you see what it
[00:24:13] is there yes exactly that was sent to me
[00:24:16] in our uh our pack of cards that we had
[00:24:19] that our box of cards that we got here
[00:24:21] and uh yes that was an interesting pack
[00:24:23] I saw those I'm like
[00:24:25] interesting so I figured we'll make that
[00:24:27] the uh one of the for the last person
[00:24:30] keep her the safe keep her safe push me

[02:39:13] Port cards we'll go to Legoland type
[02:39:15] thing so hoping that we can do that with

[02:39:28] what that's crazy for those little
[02:39:35] things yeah those things are insane I I
[02:39:37] mean I would love to get a lot of those
[02:39:38] cool Legos and like I hav even thought
[02:39:40] of building like a little Lego setup
[02:39:42] here on my desk to hold all my cards and
[02:39:44] things cuz I thought it would be fun to
[02:39:47] have the Legos to hold the cards you
[02:39:49] know like that type of thing when you do
[02:39:50] like a like a Digi break or something or
[02:39:52] you doing breaks have all your Legos
[02:39:54] holding like a setup to hold them little
[02:39:55] houses and castles and little people and
[02:39:57] figurine setup to hold all the cards I
[02:40:00] actually thought about doing that I
[02:40:01] thought that would be kind of
[02:40:03] cool like set up two figures and that's
[02:40:05] how your cards get held up so every time
[02:40:07] I have a card going on this this is what
[02:40:09] would be holding the the card would be
[02:40:11] held by the the Lego figurine saying
[02:40:14] this is what's going up for uh for the
[02:40:16] giby right
[02:40:18] now just remember everybody please do

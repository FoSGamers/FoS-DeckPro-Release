[01:31:50] buddy it's just one of those things like
[01:31:51] I I feel bad when people jump in on the
[01:31:53] one that's like it literally says don't
[01:31:55] press sometimes people jump in on it and
[01:31:58] continue and we like it I feel and then
[01:32:00] if you don't get anything I try to try
[01:32:01] to do a little something you know let's
[01:32:04] do uh let's do some more do some more
[01:32:06] adventure maybe you know I'll throw one
[01:32:08] more out here well I out the Advent more
[01:32:12] of these out while I figure out what
[01:32:14] packs we're going to put out for the
[01:32:15] adventure
[01:32:17] next I think that's what I'll do I'll
[01:32:20] throw this out and figure out what we're
[01:32:21] going to put out for an adventure
[01:32:24] Let's
[01:32:25] do let's do this oh let's do these yeah
[01:32:31] let's do
[01:32:33] this and hey guys guess what my idea is
[01:32:37] so I have my adventure story planning
[01:32:39] that I'm probably going to doing for
[01:32:40] like uh tomorrow here and with the
[01:32:43] adventure story I I figure out I figure
[01:32:46] at the end of it if we can get through
[01:32:48] it and do all the things and people buy
[01:32:50] into everything the way I was thinking
[01:32:52] that the end of the story we might be
[01:32:53] doing a giveaway of one of the things of
[01:32:55] something like uh not a giveaway I mean
[01:32:57] the last thing that would be done would
[01:32:58] maybe a I call it like a Loot drop but
[01:33:00] it might be something like one of these
[01:33:02] things maybe like a secret layer Fallout
[01:33:05] maybe something like that would that be
[01:33:07] intriguing for you
[01:33:09] guys all right I'm going to put this up
[01:33:11] here if you guys want a little Adventure
[01:33:15] a little
[01:33:21] Adventure we'll call this one
[01:33:25] right there for the adventure in the
[01:33:27] [Music]
[01:33:33] Wasteland there we go there we
[01:33:39] go we
[01:33:47] are there we
[01:33:51] go try that if you guys want it
[01:33:57] try that if you want
[01:33:58] it yes something like that all right
[01:34:01] maybe maybe I'll do that all right
[01:34:03] because I was thinking of having that
[01:34:04] like be like say what will it be is we
[01:34:06] build the characters and if everybody
[01:34:07] buys in with like the packs and stuff to
[01:34:09] help build the character if everybody
[01:34:11] buys in and all the packs to help the
[01:34:13] story along you know the last thing that
[01:34:15] would be done would be something like
[01:34:16] one I have because I have
[01:34:19] um here here actually here maybe I'll
[01:34:22] just show you so so I got all
[01:34:24] this see those right
[01:34:27] there those are two boxes
[01:34:30] full cuz I was very excited about
[01:34:32] Fallout and I bought a bunch for myself
[01:34:35] and I'm going to keep a bunch for myself
[01:34:36] but I figured I'd give a handful out to
[01:34:38] you guys maybe you stuff like that in
[01:34:40] some of the games if you might want them
[01:34:43] I don't know it's something uh maybe
[01:34:44] added into the adventure as like the the
[01:34:46] boss if you
[01:34:49] boss drop that kind of happens and if
[01:34:51] you don't beat the boss maybe it's a
[01:34:53] collector Bo type thing you know what I
[01:34:54] mean I was thinking I was thinking that
[01:34:56] might be what it is there something like
[01:34:58] that oh we're going in with that ice I
[01:35:01] like
[01:35:02] it I like it
[01:35:04] ice I thought it sound like a kind of a
[01:35:07] cool idea I don't

[01:57:37] h screenshot here
[01:57:39] again do a little
[01:57:44] Adventure little Adventure in the wayand
[01:57:47] here
[01:57:55] [Music]
[01:57:59] here we go we
[01:58:02] like we like those ones a lot we have
[01:58:05] our POG clip that's up there where is
[01:58:07] actually a pretty good discount on that
[01:58:09] one since you pretty much uh get some
[01:58:11] good stuff in those and then we have a
[01:58:13] uh also we have our giveaway up there
[01:58:16] which is just an added amount of pack
[01:58:18] cards here and if we uh I think have
[01:58:20] another another sale or two we might end
[01:58:22] up changing that to a pack this might
[01:58:24] end up having to added we might add a
[01:58:26] pack of cards there of some kind we'll
[01:58:28] see though we'll
[01:58:36] see only way to soda by the way make
[01:58:41] sure you get the real sugar version
[01:58:43] don't get that sucrose
[01:58:50] crap fructose syrup or whatever crap it
[01:58:53] is fructose yeah high fructose corn
[01:58:56] syrup don't get that crap get get real
[01:58:58] sugar spend a little bit extra if you're
[01:59:00] going to use
[01:59:01] it all right here we go or go to another
[01:59:03] country cuz that's where I actually
[01:59:04] started drinking
[01:59:07] it all righty here we
[01:59:09] go the Wasteland Adventure all right all
[01:59:12] right so you can look in the frequen
[01:59:16] questions but character all right and
[01:59:20] your character is based on the amount of
[01:59:22] strength starting out is based on what
[01:59:26] your packs are so this tells you all the
[01:59:29] price of all the packs that I have and
[01:59:31] what the strength is for your character
[01:59:33] if you get it so for instance this one
[01:59:35] that I just put up here this would have
[01:59:37] been one strength for your character in
[01:59:39] The Wasteland the three strength all
[01:59:43] right so you start out with this one
[01:59:45] being one strength what would happen is
[01:59:48] you choose your character you be like
[01:59:49] hey you know what you know I'm going to
[01:59:51] actually you know I'm going to run this
[01:59:52] quickly for a second I'm going to rerun
[01:59:54] that there you go you pick your
[01:59:56] character and you go hey I know I'm
[01:59:57] going to be a uh a mutant then you
[01:59:59] wander through this mut Wasteland
[02:00:02] mutant each one of
[02:00:05] these boxes now there's three that you
[02:00:07] pick from there's a green red and blue
[02:00:09] and you either get plus one or one on
[02:00:12] each of your strength and then go to
[02:00:14] invite a boss which is one out of 10 out
[02:00:16] of those and if you beat the boss you
[02:00:19] end up getting to pick one of the these
[02:00:22] which on the back of on on the other
[02:00:24] side of these there is packs of cards
[02:00:26] like a lost on set or maybe you're going
[02:00:29] to get a uh ioria booster I don't know
[02:00:32] but if you beat the boss that is what's
[02:00:34] on the other side of it because they do
[02:00:36] a Loot drop for you and you pick the
[02:00:38] Loot drop off you beat him right then if
[02:00:41] you get beat by the boss you end up
[02:00:44] going over here and you wander and find
[02:00:46] that Wasteland where you get a vault and
[02:00:48] you see those uh gold envelopes that are
[02:00:51] here these things you get one of those
[02:00:53] just uh little saying thank you for
[02:00:55] playing so that's kind of how the game
[02:00:57] goes
[02:00:58] there little quick rundown for
[02:01:03] you but that's the AA sign Adventure you
[02:01:05] can pick whatever you want for packs you
[02:01:07] don't need me to keep picking them for
[02:01:09] you like I keep choosing him for
[02:01:11] everyone because no one's U no one's
[02:01:13] like really saying they want a certain
[02:01:15] thing or anything so that's why I keep
[02:01:17] choosing them and putting them up
[02:01:22] so for instance say like you know oh I
[02:01:24] want some Thunder Junction big all right
[02:01:26] cool I'll throw Thunder Junction
[02:01:30] out oh you did get DED yes
[02:01:40] death yes I I remember you playing
[02:01:42] before hey it happens but you at least
[02:01:44] get your packs that you pay for always
[02:01:46] it's not like you're getting any you're
[02:01:48] losing anything it's you're getting
[02:01:50] something extra you know that's why I
[02:01:52] like doing it the way I do it cuz if you
[02:01:54] don't lose something it's just you get
[02:01:57] something
[02:02:04] extra where are they I swear I had these
[02:02:06] up
[02:02:09] here no not those ones guess
[02:02:12] not I thought I had both of these up
[02:02:15] here guess I didn't I'll have to make

[02:25:55] a wasteland Adventure game cuz what the
[02:25:57] point is is if you're able to beat the
[02:25:59] boss you actually can get yourself a
[02:26:02] pack of magic cards what we do is we uh
[02:26:05] if you beat the boss the boss does a
[02:26:08] random Loot drop and we Shuffle these
[02:26:09] cards up and we he drops one of these
[02:26:12] randomly and say oh you gotla a thunder
[02:26:14] Junction play booster and that would
[02:26:16] have happened if he beat the boss but if
[02:26:18] you don't beat the boss you always going
[02:26:19] end up wandering into a vault where you
[02:26:21] find some safety and you get yourself a
[02:26:23] vault pack rip all of them I like it

[02:27:38] patient naturalist foil and a swamp with
[02:27:42] your human Warrior
[02:27:47] token you do you can start with a higher
[02:27:50] strength you can start up to three
[02:27:52] strength to win the adventure Wasteland
[02:27:54] game that's why like um that's why I say
[02:27:56] for you guys if you ever want I'll throw
[02:27:58] it out there but this tells you all the
[02:28:00] strength you can get on the left side is
[02:28:03] the is one and on the right side is half
[02:28:07] so you can get up to three strength
[02:28:08] depending on how many packs you want to
[02:28:10] buy it's up to you on what you want to
[02:28:11] do there cuz you can actually put
[02:28:13] whatever you want together to get up to
[02:28:15] three strength I've never had a problem
[02:28:16] with that I had somebody before that was
[02:28:18] like uh that had picked out like six
[02:28:21] different packs of cards and they were
[02:28:22] just s six um I think they were like six
[02:28:25] draft draft boosters but they were all
[02:28:27] half a point and it got him three
[02:28:29] strength so I have no problem if
[02:28:30] somebody wants to do something like that
[02:28:32] but that's the highest you can get is
[02:28:34] three strength to start the
[02:28:36] adventure
[02:28:38] though one two three four five six and
[02:28:42] seven cuz we like to see those spoilers

[02:28:48] strength level you can flat out say hey

[02:52:37] didn't have a lot of money so I I was I
[02:52:39] had to scrape together my quarters from
[02:52:41] lunch when I was in elementary or middle
[02:52:45] school going so I could go spend $2 on a
[02:52:47] Homeland back when I was a kid to get
[02:52:51] better so this going to M Sports Plus to
[02:52:54] pick these out and that's the reason why
[02:52:56] I picked them up mainly some memorabilia
[02:52:58] and some you can get some uh you can get
[02:53:00] at least a uh that leeches in here too

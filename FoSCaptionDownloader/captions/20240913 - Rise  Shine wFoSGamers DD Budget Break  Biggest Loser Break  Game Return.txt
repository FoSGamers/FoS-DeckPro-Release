[00:51:13] it was the last second to last pack of

[00:51:18] more new packs in here from the new box
[00:51:21] then we have our Ravnica bloomo kamigawa
[00:51:24] and a commander Masters to go with
[00:51:28] our an exhibition of
[00:51:32] Adventure if you want
[00:51:36] to do you have any sealed boxes of
[00:51:38] wasteland
[00:51:43] cards Mouse Warrior Pack stuff the mouse
[00:51:47] Warrior is uh oh Bloom bloomo
[00:51:53] James uh oh yeah I'm sorry about Darth
[00:51:56] MOX that is bad for shipping there I
[00:51:58] don't know what you're talking about the
[00:51:59] Wasteland
[00:52:03] car are you talking about the
[00:52:07] game the Wasteland game and the
[00:52:12] auction oh oh you're intrigued by
[00:52:14] playing the Wasteland game okay so the
[00:52:17] Wasteland game something a little
[00:52:19] different all right so the Wasteland
[00:52:21] game is
[00:52:22] this you pick a character in our
[00:52:25] Wasteland game and this is one that we
[00:52:26] we played a while back we're going we
[00:52:29] were kind of bringing it back here a
[00:52:30] little bit cuz people were interested in
[00:52:31] some of our games so I was bringing some
[00:52:33] of our games back here with that said
[00:52:35] this is how it goes so you pick one of
[00:52:37] those characters kind of at the top and
[00:52:39] you choose whatever you want your for
[00:52:41] your packs it's not starting at a dollar
[00:52:43] you just pick I just have that there as
[00:52:44] a uh it's just like a a placeholder so
[00:52:47] say You're Gonna Go with uh AR rabn any
[00:52:50] of the draft or play boosters are a
[00:52:52] point one plus one for your character
[00:52:54] for the strength to start out with
[00:52:57] because each time they start out with
[00:52:58] the amount of packs they come with so
[00:53:00] say they automatically start with three
[00:53:02] but maybe you can get more you know and
[00:53:05] have something happen here so start out
[00:53:09] with you strength you pick whatever you
[00:53:12] want for packs and we play this little
[00:53:14] Adventure game where you pick your
[00:53:15] character at the Top If you can't see
[00:53:17] that I can make it bigger but you maybe
[00:53:19] you'll be a mutant maybe you're you
[00:53:21] going to be a uh a strong human
[00:53:23] wandering through the Wasteland or is it
[00:53:25] a detective trying to figure out what
[00:53:26] what's going on in this Wasteland in
[00:53:27] Saving or maybe it's a technician
[00:53:30] wandering through trying to save their
[00:53:33] uh fallout shelter it was one that we
[00:53:35] had back when the Fallout game was out
[00:53:37] here and we played a when Fallout was
[00:53:38] coming and we played this little game
[00:53:40] here then you wander through and
[00:53:41] eventually maybe you're going to get
[00:53:42] lucky where you're going to be able to
[00:53:44] come out and you're going to have enough
[00:53:45] strength where you can B beat the
[00:53:48] Velociraptor and come out with a
[00:53:50] win and if you win what happens is the
[00:53:52] reason why I have it as a dollar is that
[00:53:54] if you guys end up winning we put a pack
[00:53:56] of cards down for a loop we call it a
[00:53:57] loot pack and I put it out for an
[00:53:59] auction for a
[00:54:00] dollar if you're able to beat the boss
[00:54:03] but that's kind of how we play the game
[00:54:04] there so you start out with
[00:54:06] just just coming with zero points and
[00:54:09] depending on how many packs you get it's
[00:54:11] adds up so like one point
[00:54:14] per set I mean for per draft or play
[00:54:17] booster for premium like play booster
[00:54:19] which would be like a modern horizon or
[00:54:21] a set modern horizon or say you're going
[00:54:24] to go with a commander Masters or draft
[00:54:26] that be uh Commander Master's draft that
[00:54:28] would be plus one extra so instead of
[00:54:31] plus one be plus two then if you go with
[00:54:33] the collector booster it's plus
[00:54:38] three you're the boss at the end that he
[00:54:40] have to
[00:54:46] fight yes you would be fighting I know
[00:54:49] potentially be fighting the uh fighting
[00:54:52] the creature here we're not sure
[00:54:56] what it is is literally I have one two
[00:54:59] three four five six seven eight I have
[00:55:02] eight creatures and I take my dice here
[00:55:04] and I roll it to see which one you're
[00:55:05] GNA G to go up against all
[00:55:08] right because it's the strength of each
[00:55:10] one depending on which one you're going
[00:55:12] to
[00:55:14] beat but that's kind of what that game
[00:55:16] is it's a little silly one nothing
[00:55:20] spectacular but oh fun game that's what
[00:55:23] it
[00:55:24] is and see what happens happens is you
[00:55:26] have like three little things here so
[00:55:27] you pick your character so you're G to
[00:55:29] we'll give an example we're going to say
[00:55:30] you know what hey I want to be um I'm
[00:55:33] going to be I'm going to pick a
[00:55:34] character I'm just going to throw this
[00:55:35] out we're going to pick a collector
[00:55:36] booster here so we're going to start out
[00:55:37] with plus three on your strength and
[00:55:40] you're gonna be hey I'm gonna be a
[00:55:40] mutant here wandering through this
[00:55:43] Wasteland and you go you know what hey
[00:55:44] this mutant what happens we have to go
[00:55:47] through we have to find some things and
[00:55:48] you go all right we're going to say
[00:55:49] we're going to see if we can kit get any
[00:55:50] food because the mutant likes food in
[00:55:52] the Wasteland it helps him so you pick a
[00:55:54] card out of here out of one through I
[00:55:55] think it's 74 and you go oh no that's
[00:55:59] not helpful cuz the mutant when they
[00:56:01] look at the treasure they go over to and
[00:56:02] go oh look at this I have found treasure
[00:56:05] but he's stupid he picks it up as booby
[00:56:07] tra oh no he blows off three of his 14
[00:56:10] fingers now leaving him with
[00:56:13] 12 well that MTH doesn't work whatever
[00:56:16] he's a mutant it doesn't matter it
[00:56:17] doesn't matter doesn't matter that's
[00:56:21] okay then he continues on he's like oh
[00:56:25] my God my hand it's hurting goes oh no
[00:56:28] there's something else coming to the
[00:56:29] Wasteland all of a sudden you see what
[00:56:32] could it be you choose a number between
[00:56:34] one and something again like I said and
[00:56:35] you get a map well you look at that and
[00:56:38] you go um does a map help me I'm not
[00:56:41] really sure if a map helps me here so
[00:56:44] you look at it you go St mutant map I
[00:56:47] don't know this is really confusing he
[00:56:49] looks at it it's hard for his brain he
[00:56:52] looks at that map and he goes oh no
[00:56:57] I don't know what's going on
[00:56:59] here and they wander away where the map
[00:57:03] one
[00:57:09] went all right and then drops them down
[00:57:12] instead of going up one Health they were
[00:57:13] at three and then they went they dropped
[00:57:15] down two health so far they went up
[00:57:17] they're at three and they started and
[00:57:18] went down and now they're at one Health
[00:57:20] this isn't good man blood blood is not
[00:57:21] good can't even count I know can't even
[00:57:24] count so stupid
[00:57:27] so all right now we put this back over
[00:57:28] here just because that's part of this
[00:57:29] break all right now this is nothing this
[00:57:31] is the part that we need to worry about
[00:57:33] you see something else wandering the
[00:57:35] distance he goes oh it's between 1 and
[00:57:37] 10 I think here or maybe 12 and you see
[00:57:39] this thing that comes out oh my you're
[00:57:42] lucky your fungus dinosaur gets HS up to
[00:57:45] you and go hey buddy come on you jump on
[00:57:47] his back you go wandering through the
[00:57:48] Wasteland and all of a
[00:57:50] sudden oh nice there's a vault up there
[00:57:53] perfect you're going to go up to that
[00:57:55] Vault going to get that Vault you want
[00:57:56] to see what happens but oh no we have to
[00:57:59] roll we got to see which one we're going
[00:58:01] to have run into where's my where's my
[00:58:04] dice here I know I got it over
[00:58:09] here all right so we roll we get a four
[00:58:13] Oh no you're against the incinerator you
[00:58:17] only have one strength that is not going
[00:58:19] to do it I'm sorry my friend the
[00:58:22] incinerator comes by burning you down
[00:58:26] luckily though your uh dino distracts
[00:58:30] him and you're lucky and you're able to
[00:58:31] get into the safe safety of that vault
[00:58:34] in the vault you go and you find
[00:58:35] something in there oh my look at that
[00:58:37] you see some gold in there and in there
[00:58:40] that gold thing you go up to oh my look
[00:58:42] at that there's a Benji in
[00:58:44] there and that's what happens then you
[00:58:48] find out what's in this Benji here cuz
[00:58:50] that's a little extra thing you always
[00:58:51] get free whenever you play it's kind of
[00:58:53] like the the thing you find at the end
[00:58:54] of the rainbow there when you're playing
[00:58:56] you're beating all your bosses but
[00:58:57] that's a little game you play and that's

[01:00:36] happen there on that one but anyways
[01:00:39] that's our uh that's a little game there
[01:00:42] because you do have 10 characters I
[01:00:43] thought there were 10 bosses to go up

[01:06:10] everybody this is I haven't had this
[01:06:11] running for a while so uh people have
[01:06:14] questions all the time when I do these
[01:06:15] you know it's not a problem at all I
[01:06:16] don't mind answering questions that's
[01:06:18] where we're here
[01:06:20] for there you go but that's our little
[01:06:23] that was our fun game that I had made it
[01:06:24] was I don't a few month back I haven't
[01:06:26] played it for a few months now Reuben
[01:06:28] that was a nice pick up my
[01:06:30] buddy Reuben I already have you written
[01:06:38] down here we go
[01:06:45] Reuben just the person that bought it is
[01:06:48] the one that plays correct just the
[01:06:50] person that bought it is the one that
[01:06:51] plays the only person the only thing
[01:06:53] that everybody gets a chance at is the
[01:06:55] um the if you beat the boss I'm not
[01:06:57] allowed to give anything to you guys
[01:06:59] because that's against what not terms of
[01:07:00] service it's considered gambling or
[01:07:02] whatever so what I have to do is if you
[01:07:03] happen to win we put it out as an
[01:07:04] auction for a dollar and anybody can get
[01:07:09] it that's the only way I can go about
[01:07:11] that
[01:07:16] one just due to the whatnot rules really
[01:07:19] is what it boils down to if what not
[01:07:21] then I mean if the rules were a little
[01:07:23] different I would have do it yeah they
[01:07:25] oh look at that shadow and you got the
[01:07:30] rare you got the deserted Temple foil
[01:07:32] and rare from
[01:07:34] us it is a nice little one it's not a

[01:08:07] had something out of pulled and our
[01:08:08] commander Masters set right there and
[01:08:12] then we have our dungeon dragons which
[01:08:14] will end up being split up between
[01:08:16] everybody evenly that's what's in the
[01:08:18] break right there oh another prom
[01:08:24] Shadow uh the note disappears sometimes
[01:08:27] with uh the with the giveaway going up
[01:08:30] but if you look in the description of
[01:08:32] the auction which is the way s Adventure
[01:08:35] it gives you all the information on
[01:08:37] everything there
[01:08:40] too so like it kind of explains it all
[01:08:42] there
[01:08:45] too no no you don't have to be present
[01:08:47] for the break I have everything um
[01:08:49] always just shared online so
[01:08:50] everything's always on YouTube so you
[01:08:52] can always go and watch it from there
[01:08:53] because you'll always be able to see it
[01:08:54] live on YouTube with me that's one of
[01:08:56] the things that I like to do it always
[01:08:58] records and savs live there so you can
[01:08:59] always go there number
[01:09:02] three oh I need to get a I need to get a
[01:09:05] rare to put in hold on I can't just
[01:09:07] throw a card out I need to put a rare
[01:09:24] in that's what put
[01:09:32] in one two three coming at you my
[01:09:37] friends all
[01:09:39] righty you do not have to be present for
[01:09:41] the break no you do not have to be
[01:09:43] present for the break and that's what's
[01:09:45] in it today for the break there we have
[01:09:47] two spots that are left if you want to
[01:09:48] jump
[01:09:49] in well somebody hits a monoc crypt it
[01:09:52] still gets done exactly the same way it
[01:09:55] hit yeah I end up putting a proxy in for
[01:09:57] it instead of shuffling them together
[01:09:58] but any high value cards I put a proxy
[01:10:00] in but I shuffle them all up and I hand
[01:10:02] them out the exact same way as if it was
[01:10:05] uh the rest of them
[01:10:06] too yep that's how it works because
[01:10:09] that's how the break
[01:10:17] is but yeah everybody will always be
[01:10:19] seeing it available here anyways no
[01:10:21] matter what
[01:10:28] it's probably the reason why I like to
[01:10:29] do them live and have them streaming on
[01:10:31] YouTube there are two spots left in the
[01:10:34] dungeon break here two spots left in
[01:10:37] this one right
[01:10:40] here no not a problem at all so the
[01:10:43] break murf a lot of times people will
[01:10:45] like to jump in and get a bunch of
[01:10:46] things together and to get a mix of
[01:10:49] cards and stuff from different sets
[01:10:50] rather than getting and to do that
[01:10:52] they'd have to buy a lot of packs and
[01:10:53] they don't always get an opportunity to
[01:10:55] it's a lot of money to buy a bunch of
[01:10:56] packs so what
[01:11:00] we no no no there is no highest win or
[01:11:03] anything like that so what I do is I
[01:11:05] literally take all these I open them up
[01:11:08] I take all the mythics rares and
[01:11:10] uncommons and Commons that are $3 and
[01:11:11] more I put them in his sleeves and then
[01:11:14] I shuffle them up and I hand them out to
[01:11:16] the people that purchased them so like I
[01:11:18] put your name down on these cards here
[01:11:19] like I've been writing them down for the
[01:11:20] proxies and I put your name down so
[01:11:22] Frank would be first Matt would be
[01:11:23] second Ruben
[01:11:25] Taun then what I would do is I'd hand
[01:11:27] them out onto each person there and uh
[01:11:31] all the way to the last one and they
[01:11:34] would end up getting those mythics rares
[01:11:35] or uncommons and Commons that are $3 and
[01:11:37] more and then I would also take the
[01:11:40] Dungeons and Dragon one here because
[01:11:41] there's six of the primary ones in there
[01:11:43] we sleeve those up shuffle them up and
[01:11:45] hand one out to each person so each
[01:11:46] person gets one of them and then if you
[01:11:48] want to do any trades or anything like
[01:11:50] that you can do it
[01:11:57] no I did not see the the the the boo
[01:12:00] Commander one is there a special one you
[01:12:03] could get I didn't know
[01:12:05] that shadow all right give me one
[01:12:11] second deserted Temple foil nice rare
[01:12:15] deserted Temple foil you get to untap
[01:12:18] land with that one which is a nice one
[01:12:26] but that is our break right there and
[01:12:28] that's how the breaks work I kind of do
[01:12:30] them that way kind of give everybody an
[01:12:31] opportunity to get a bunch of different
[01:12:32] cards from different sets is really what
[01:12:33] it is walk with the ancestors all right
[01:12:36] not a big hit but it gets you a discount
[01:12:38] on shipping if you want to jump in on
[01:12:40] anything let's see if you want to do
[01:12:42] that my friend taunt I know you already
[01:12:44] jumped in on um the game here so let's
[01:12:47] see what happens I didn't see that it
[01:12:49] was taunt my friend nice one a little
[01:12:51] pick up all right now give me a there
[01:12:54] are two more spots correct a number
[01:12:57] between one and 10 my friend
[01:13:06] taunt
[01:13:09] yeah one two three four I do like I
[01:13:12] don't like how they do that they change
[01:13:13] them into regular cards sometimes that I
[01:13:16] will have to admit things like that are
[01:13:17] frustrating because you like oh I got
[01:13:18] this and this or like the special card
[01:13:20] and then now it's not special anymore
[01:13:21] it's
[01:13:22] just n
[01:13:29] oh no no no no no no no that was um no
[01:13:34] no this is deserted Temple deserted
[01:13:37] Temple and if that was that $150 one
[01:13:40] that's incorrect because it shouldn't be
[01:13:41] that it was deserted
[01:13:49] Temple yeah no deserted Temple is uh not
[01:13:53] not a giant hit but a nice little one
[01:13:55] nice little
[01:13:58] one but I threw another rare in there
[01:14:00] but we only have two spots left in the
[01:14:01] break here if you guys want to jump in
[01:14:03] we to write your name down on one of
[01:14:04] these two cards so we can get everything
[01:14:06] done and shuffling them up with everyone
[01:14:08] and handing it out then we do have our
[01:14:11] other one we do our Biggest Loser ones
[01:14:13] that we do too for those you that like
[01:14:15] the biggest loser and want to get a
[01:14:16] chance of getting a commander deck mod
[01:14:19] Horizon 3 commander deck that is
[01:14:22] too so let's see we have those right
[01:14:27] there and then the game for those of you
[01:14:30] that want to try so is anybody want to
[01:14:32] do if anyone wants to do the game let me
[01:14:33] know and we'll run
[01:14:35] that and what I will do though right now
[01:14:41] is I think what I'll do right now here
[01:14:44] is this
[01:14:58] I want
[01:14:59] to I actually pulled my singles out the
[01:15:02] other day so I was like GNA start doing
[01:15:04] some of the singles again because I got
[01:15:06] them out yesterday from the storage
[01:15:08] location so I have access to them now so
[01:15:10] I think maybe
[01:15:11] tomorrow this is the Dungeons and
[01:15:15] Dragons in exhibition of
[01:15:20] Adventure no no it is not I did not have
[01:15:24] the I was not quick enough to get in to
[01:15:25] get those I went to go and get them they
[01:15:27] were all sold out so I got the ones that
[01:15:28] I could that I was like oh those are
[01:15:30] nice so I got a few of the ones that I
[01:15:31] could but that was it no cool I know I
[01:15:36] hate when they do that too nowadays I I
[01:15:38] like when before when you were able to
[01:15:39] buy them at the amount they and they
[01:15:41] built it and they like sh and they like
[01:15:42] made them and shipped them or whatever
[01:15:44] that was good to me and if somebody
[01:15:45] didn't buy it and they wanted it later
[01:15:47] on and they spiked price and some reason
[01:15:48] then whatever but it shouldn't have been
[01:15:50] that they made it they're making it
[01:15:52] um like an elite item that you have to
[01:15:55] purchase over the top
[01:15:57] now yes the one with the beholder I do
[01:15:59] believe this is the one with the behold
[01:16:01] no the eye I don't this is the one with
[01:16:02] the beholder it might be the other one
[01:16:04] has I know I have the eye of the
[01:16:05] beholder ones specifically but this
[01:16:07] might be the one with the beholder
[01:16:26] let put that in here and check
[01:16:31] it this is the one with the no this is
[01:16:35] not the one with that these are ones
[01:16:36] with the dragons and the
[01:16:41] archith oh Boris R Mel that is a hard
[01:16:44] one to
[01:16:45] get nonfoil nonfoil
[01:16:48] correct yeah it's uh it's the one with
[01:16:51] like um monster manual the dragons
[01:16:54] archith
[01:16:55] stuff like
[01:17:00] that yeah so sorry I have I do have the
[01:17:03] eyes of the beholder one which we can do
[01:17:05] another one of those maybe another time
[01:17:06] but that this is what we got right now
[01:17:08] is what we have out here all right so we
[01:17:11] have one more spot left

[02:16:22] why is it pinning at a dollar that's not
[02:16:26] right that is so weird that it's pinning
[02:16:28] at a
[02:16:29] dollar there 22 hey it's breaking
[02:16:34] anyways there's
[02:16:36] 22 dollars for one of them we have those
[02:16:39] left there we have a few of those spots
[02:16:42] we'll see what happens and it's called
[02:16:43] The Biggest Loser because we have all
[02:16:45] the cards handing out and the last thing
[02:16:46] is the person that's the biggest loser
[02:16:47] gets the commander
[02:16:49] debt these are the packs that are in the
[02:16:51] break here we have lost Caverns two of
[02:16:54] those two modern Horizon 3 play boosters
[02:16:57] two Commander Masters set two inist Rod
[02:17:01] I mean an inrad hunt a Forgotten Realms
[02:17:04] two bloomo and a modern Horizon three
[02:17:07] collector booster plus the way the
[02:17:09] Biggest Loser break goes is this this
[02:17:11] commander deck is in it whoever is The
[02:17:13] Biggest Loser gets the commander deck
[02:17:15] and whoever is the second biggest loser
[02:17:17] gets the sample pack of The Collector
[02:17:19] booster sample pack
[02:17:21] that's how this break is set
[02:17:25] up I think I might
[02:17:28] uh see one of the things I was debating
[02:17:30] on doing
[02:17:35] today was I was thinking of getting some
[02:17:37] of the some videos and things like that
[02:17:40] done for U some video this afternoon
[02:17:42] because we had a good break and a lot of
[02:17:44] good things opening right away this
[02:17:46] morning I was debating on maybe jumping
[02:17:48] on a little bit later doing some stuff
[02:17:51] what do you guys think should I do that
[02:17:52] jump on later this afternoon with you
[02:17:55] guys and um have some fun maybe this
[02:18:01] afternoon no no it's up to you guys I'm
[02:18:03] trying to think of what to do here
[02:18:04] because I know it slows down a lot of
[02:18:06] times around this time
[02:18:07] frame and there's you know people
[02:18:09] getting into their work and everything I
[02:18:11] figure I could jump on again but the
[02:18:12] problem is I don't like doing that
[02:18:14] because it removes
[02:18:15] everybody's like uh shipping and
[02:18:17] everything that's the only problem I
[02:18:19] like to do it like
[02:18:22] where it runs for a bit because of
[02:18:25] uh I don't want to get in trouble for
[02:18:27] any type of dead stream on things going
[02:18:32] on it's a conundrum there
[02:18:38] huh conundrum we got
[02:18:41] here
[02:18:44] so I think what I'm going to do here is
[02:18:47] this
[02:18:56] oh I forgot to get a number let me put
[02:18:58] that
[02:19:02] out we're going to
[02:19:04] do that one's not going to be one that
[02:19:06] works today I have a feeling we have to
[02:19:07] do a different thing not too many people
[02:19:09] get on that one that's a slower one uh
[02:19:12] so we'll see talking to
[02:19:15] myself let's see what we want to do here
[02:19:26] do I want
[02:19:28] to I think that might be what I want to
[02:19:30] do today what do you guys think should I
[02:19:32] come back later this afternoon and hang
[02:19:33] out with you guys so I got some errands
[02:19:35] and other things I need to get done
[02:19:37] today what do you
[02:19:39] think why is that keep doing that as a
[02:19:42] dollar
[02:19:53] why does that keep doing it that way
[02:19:55] that's crazy it's not a
[02:20:01] dollar that's so weird that I doing it
[02:20:04] like
[02:20:07] that oh do I show 22 on your end because
[02:20:10] it was showing a dollar when it was
[02:20:11] pinned for some reason for me I'm like
[02:20:14] no that's not a
[02:20:19] dollar the reason why I did it for
[02:20:21] 22 is because that allows you all right
[02:20:24] so that shows better now all
[02:20:26] right Mr
[02:20:29] gentleman there you go Mr gentlemen
[02:20:31] you've got a bone Bine
[02:20:33] orator bone Bine orator Mr
[02:20:41] gentlemen get you a discount on shipping
[02:20:43] if you want to jump in on anything
[02:20:53] Mr
[02:20:54] gentlemen there you go my
[02:21:01] friend yes yes see what I'm thinking is
[02:21:04] I might do one in the afternoon here
[02:21:09] because a lot of times people get it
[02:21:11] slows down here for a little while so I
[02:21:14] think what I'm going to do
[02:21:18] is I have our buyers in here right I
[02:21:23] have our buyers in
[02:21:27] here now if you want to buy in now you
[02:21:29] can because this will be running I'll

[02:27:26] possible I think we can get 50 people to
[02:27:28] save a show so if we get 50 people to

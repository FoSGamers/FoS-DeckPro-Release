[00:14:50] four five six seven that'll be the
[00:14:52] giveaway card today that we're going to
[00:14:54] start it with we'll do them throughout
[00:14:55] the stream randomly for those of you

[00:15:03] stream we try to have some fun with
[00:15:07] you we are streaming mainly from whatnot
[00:15:10] but I tried to do some new restreaming
[00:15:11] through other
[00:15:13] places so um we're GNA now do a uh have
[00:15:19] a break
[00:15:22] here we're going to edit it it's
[00:15:24] actually supposed to have six available
[00:15:26] because uh we had a return now
[00:15:29] we're going to put this in at a we're
[00:15:32] actually going to put this to an auction
[00:15:34] at the moment that way we can pin that
[00:15:37] as an auction this is what we're going
[00:15:39] to do we're going to figure out what we
[00:15:40] want to put in here today we're going to
[00:15:41] start it off with a little bit of a
[00:15:42] break get it rolling so that you guys
[00:15:44] see what we got going on here all
[00:15:47] right then what we'll do after is uh
[00:15:51] we'll get some of the game stuff running
[00:15:52] as long as I can get it going right here
[00:15:54] this is our first instance of it so it
[00:15:55] might have some technical issues and we
[00:15:57] might not work right so we're going to
[00:15:58] have some dust more in here and no one
[00:16:00] really I don't think anybody was liking
[00:16:02] the um that those so I'm going to take
[00:16:04] this I'll put this away we're going to
[00:16:06] go with something else here and we're
[00:16:08] going to add in we'll say uh instead of
[00:16:12] that we'll change it to what what should
[00:16:15] we add in
[00:16:16] instead since it not only dusk Moore
[00:16:19] maybe put in
[00:16:20] um a bloom Barrow
[00:16:23] and outlaws in a modern horizon or
[00:16:26] something like that is that something
[00:16:27] you all would be intrigued in
[00:16:52] today yeah I know I know but well I
[00:16:54] figure we'll throw the one in from the
[00:16:55] uh the box there that's a nice one a fun
[00:16:58] one
[00:16:59] but uh we'll do uh that one and

[00:17:04] say what I just said there we'll throw
[00:17:05] one of
[00:17:07] these and we'll throw one of those
[00:17:11] in I know this is a Wednesday but we
[00:17:13] like to do these ones on uh random days
[00:17:16] here then we'll make one of those a uh
[00:17:19] one of the modern Horizon ones so let's
[00:17:21] do this here do some quick math

[00:28:40] there we
[00:28:41] go aha that's why it's not on the right
[00:28:45] stuff it's not connected right uh
[00:28:48] oh looks like I'm going have to make
[00:28:50] some connections here that's okay though
[00:28:52] I can fix that I can fix those and Ne I
[00:28:54] don't know if you guys remember that

[00:30:01] again try that we'll run that again here
[00:30:03] well I know people were liking it
[00:30:05] sometimes they do sometimes you
[00:30:08] don't but it's freezing on me and that's
[00:30:10] what I'm having a problem with today
[00:30:12] technology I don't know if it's a
[00:30:13] connection to OBS that's causing the
[00:30:16] issue from whatnot or whatever I don't
[00:30:19] know it's just being weird not being
[00:30:21] normal a little
[00:30:25] frustrating I don't know how to say that
[00:30:27] yeah
[00:30:31] for some reason my uh YouTube isn't
[00:30:33] going to connect through
[00:30:47] here that's what I'm supposed to be on
[00:30:50] there we
[00:30:56] go there we go go
[00:30:59] haa Google
[00:31:03] it oh we'll open some packs here in a
[00:31:05] minute we'll open some packs here in a
[00:31:06] minute I'm sorry I'm going to get what I
[00:31:08] am going to get out now um I was going
[00:31:10] to open myself we had opened up um a
[00:31:15] couple different things from dusn and
[00:31:16] stuff recently and I don't want to go
[00:31:18] with Dorn again because we've opened a
[00:31:20] bunch of it one of the things I do want
[00:31:21] to do though is I have um you guys
[00:31:24] intrigued by
[00:31:25] um sorcery at all and I I want to have
[00:31:28] you guys anybody want to help me um we
[00:31:30] were talking about building some decks
[00:31:32] here to play some games with everyone is
[00:31:34] that something that if we think we let's
[00:31:36] do some of that like a little bit right
[00:31:37] now maybe we'll build a few things we'll
[00:31:41] open some packs I have another B box of
[00:31:44] them that I wanted to open I just did
[00:31:46] not put them in get them ready for me I
[00:31:49] have to move a bunch of things to get to
[00:31:51] it yes I'm stupid and I don't pay
[00:31:54] attention and plan ahead of time always
[00:31:56] very well
[00:32:01] and in that
[00:32:02] case I got to move stuff around a bunch
[00:32:07] but easy enough to take care of this one
[00:32:09] there's only like three boxes I got to
[00:32:22] move so we're going to open some of this
[00:32:24] here so I wanted to open one of those
[00:32:27] again if people are intrigued at it
[00:32:30] let's put that back over here don't want
[00:32:32] to leave that out put that that way so I
[00:32:34] can get to it
[00:32:38] later move that over
[00:32:41] here we go
[00:32:44] better
[00:32:46] there so that's what I was thinking of
[00:32:50] doing the hollow shiny pack yes this is
[00:32:53] the um this is the uh Bloom Bros
[00:32:57] collector boosters if you want any of
[00:32:58] those we do have them in the store if
[00:33:00] you'd like to pick any
[00:33:06] up not
[00:33:11] activity yes we got our mini break there
[00:33:14] if people want it that is for our
[00:33:20] um break here and this is what I'll do
[00:33:23] I'm going to put this over here so you
[00:33:25] can kind of see it with all that stuff
[00:33:28] then what I'm going to do here is I'm
[00:33:29] going to move this over and we're going
[00:33:30] to open
[00:33:34] that you want it closer to the camera I
[00:33:37] can zoom in
[00:33:41] even there you
[00:33:45] go look that I can even zoom
[00:33:48] in oh look at that intriguing there you
[00:33:51] go
[00:33:59] zoom in a little bit for
[00:34:02] you now as I was saying we'll do some of
[00:34:05] this here we'll open some of
[00:34:07] these and see what we got going
[00:34:10] on now I know you guys um I was trying
[00:34:13] to get you get we had that break there
[00:34:14] for some of
[00:34:17] you I started a new one I started a new
[00:34:20] one because um we didn't have anybody
[00:34:22] jump in on it so it was a completely
[00:34:24] different one now one of the things I'm
[00:34:26] going to do is I'm going to take these
[00:34:27] and I'm going to use this as a giveaway
[00:34:28] later that sorcery one so if you want to
[00:34:31] know what is in there I'll show you
[00:34:32] what's in here again we started a new

[00:36:28] me the things I keep trying to do and I
[00:36:29] don't know if it's because of the new
[00:36:31] setup I did with an OBS here or if it's
[00:36:33] because of the um what not changes here
[00:36:36] but you should be able actually see

[00:42:00] thank you for the scissors yeah I know
[00:42:01] those are pretty nice scissors my wife
[00:42:03] uh well what happened was my son had
[00:42:05] opened a couple of packs a while ago
[00:42:07] with scissors cuz he was um he had a
[00:42:09] hard time opening them so I got that and
[00:42:11] then he got like really good luck when
[00:42:13] he did that and I was like oh wow that's
[00:42:15] interesting so I was like let's keep
[00:42:17] trying to do this and see what happens
[00:42:19] and yeah we ended up getting good luck
[00:42:21] on a regular basis so I was like you
[00:42:23] know what I'm going to keep doing
[00:42:23] scissors and like you know if I'm going
[00:42:24] to keep doing scissors I need some nice
[00:42:26] looking ones so I went online I was
[00:42:28] trying to find ones that look like
[00:42:29] dragons but I couldn't but I did find
[00:42:32] these instead and I'm like oh those are
[00:42:34] cool they were like uh I know you know
[00:42:36] Amazon like their Japanese Samurai sword
[00:42:38] ones made from Japan J I mean said it in

[00:48:54] now not a bad one not a big hit but it's
[00:48:57] nice little hit there nice Fun hit there
[00:49:00] all right put that
[00:49:03] away aha yeah pretty fun huh fun that I
[00:49:07] can do
[00:49:09] that let me minimize that and get it out
[00:49:12] of the
[00:49:13] way yeah they're not that they're not
[00:49:15] that big but they're good hits of cards
[00:49:16] to play with I just like to show people
[00:49:18] sometimes the price so people know that
[00:49:20] it's not like it's a giant wicked
[00:49:22] expensive game that's why I like the
[00:49:23] packs I think I have them in here as
[00:49:27] like I have um packs in here for a
[00:49:29] three- pack deal for 27 or if you want
[00:49:31] an individual pack it's $11 so that's
[00:49:33] what I mean like these aren't overly
[00:49:35] expensive for picking them up but you
[00:49:37] could still get some cool fun things out
[00:49:39] of them depending on how how lucky you
[00:49:42] are hey how's it going horard hopefully
[00:49:45] you're having a good one my
[00:49:49] friend yeah they're wicked hard to get
[00:49:51] some of those ones that are the foils
[00:49:53] that are like the unique
[00:49:54] one yeah yeah I just kind like that yeah
[00:49:57] it's like the game is here for people to
[00:49:58] play it's not to keep people out of it
[00:50:00] by having wicked expensive card pieces
[00:50:03] cards I mean you might have one because
[00:50:04] you're lucky to get one or two of them
[00:50:06] but you're not going to have all of them
[00:50:07] that way this good stream's going well
[00:50:09] hopefully you guys are liking how it
[00:50:11] looks so far I have it set up pretty
[00:50:14] good I do believe now um
[00:50:17] so yeah lord of the Void is really cool
[00:50:20] looking so curio just is a little bit
[00:50:23] different um the art is a little bit
[00:50:24] different on the card and on the back it
[00:50:26] says curio instead of curiosa and the
[00:50:30] reason for that is uh it's just like a
[00:50:32] special thing it's like a one in 30,000
[00:50:34] boxes or some crap like that for the
[00:50:36] chance of getting one of those it's like
[00:50:38] a really big
[00:50:39] chance not too bad on the stream we're
[00:50:41] just opening a pack here see if anybody
[00:50:43] wants to jump in our
[00:50:46] break now it is a is a magic break
[00:50:48] because people like magic a lot here but
[00:50:50] we do our our opening sorcery right now
[00:50:52] just seeing if the curio is on the back
[00:50:53] of any of these it's like 1 and3 ,000
[00:50:57] and then any of the gnome ones could
[00:50:58] have it on there it's uh fos underscore
[00:51:02] Gamers it wasn't on um for some reason
[00:51:04] it wasn't showing me well it allow me to
[00:51:06] get fos Gamers so it has to be Flore
[00:51:08] Gamers for it I'll get that stuff put
[00:51:10] into my um my link tree
[00:51:15] soon cave trolls yes check on the back
[00:51:17] of this one for it so it would say curio
[00:51:19] here instead of curiosa and it would
[00:51:22] just be like like there would be slight
[00:51:23] something slightly different in the art
[00:51:25] is really what it blows down to
[00:51:27] incinerate Mad Dash border militia AER
[00:51:31] Ridge Caravan fade ogre
[00:51:35] goons we have a
[00:51:37] sandworm miracle workers Cloud
[00:51:41] Spirit Dark Tower nice I like the giant
[00:51:45] shark that's why I said nice there
[00:51:47] because I saw that come out my wife was
[00:51:49] like my wife will like that one she
[00:51:50] likes the mermaid decks free City not
[00:51:54] bad a shield wall that's a good little
[00:51:56] pickup
[00:51:58] Kash Chimera I like that that's a nice
[00:52:02] one too the art on that see that's what
[00:52:04] I mean like the the art and like the I
[00:52:07] don't know just the art on them that's
[00:52:08] what the big thing with it with for me
[00:52:10] is it's a lot of the original artists
[00:52:12] from
[00:52:13] Magic and uh they do handdrawn art or
[00:52:16] hand painted art one of the other and
[00:52:19] that's what I think is the but that's
[00:52:21] like like you can even go and see some
[00:52:22] of the giant versions of the paintings
[00:52:24] available uh I don't know if they're
[00:52:26] available to bu but like they're online
[00:52:27] somewhere I can't remember all of them
[00:52:28] but yeah you can even go look at them
[00:52:29] that's pretty
[00:52:30] cool it is pretty
[00:52:33] cool now let me get these over here all

[01:06:55] that's an interesting concept I'm
[01:06:56] guessing they get so par like they can't
[01:06:58] figure out what to do bouncing all over
[01:06:59] the place that they um don't get
[01:07:02] anything
[01:07:04] done
[01:07:09] yeah we got the blender
[01:07:14] going all right well we
[01:07:18] um we're trying to R run this again here
[01:07:21] we'll pin
[01:07:23] that why does it keep saying this four
[01:07:26] should say there's more than that that
[01:07:28] was a good card the thil one yes it
[01:07:32] was yes it
[01:07:35] was all
[01:07:38] right oh yeah for the thing
[01:07:41] yeah my sons are trying out for new
[01:07:43] soccer
[01:07:44] teams so long story short they um last
[01:07:47] soccer team my son been on for three
[01:07:49] years we put all kinds of effort in
[01:07:51] going all over the place he had actually
[01:07:52] helped other teams multiple times um by
[01:07:55] either moving up to the um higher age
[01:07:57] group so they didn't have to Forfeit and
[01:07:58] he would play with them and he or when
[01:08:01] they had not enough players for um Subs
[01:08:03] he would play with them and he actually
[01:08:04] ended up playing like the entire game
[01:08:05] over other players on their team Well
[01:08:08] they um last year they dinked him around
[01:08:11] because there was a new director of the
[01:08:13] program they didn't want him to be in
[01:08:15] the older kids so they only let him be
[01:08:16] in the young ones which is like running
[01:08:17] around Little Bees and he's like 100
[01:08:19] times better than that because he knows
[01:08:20] what he's doing and then um so that
[01:08:23] didn't like wasn't going to work so we
[01:08:24] ended up getting like new bored and
[01:08:26] everything for this year no curio there
[01:08:29] either
[01:08:30] and they are they tried to still do the
[01:08:33] same thing and like what the hell he's
[01:08:34] like he's literally been better than all
[01:08:36] of you and like you put a nine-year-old
[01:08:37] on the team but he's he is it just
[01:08:38] because he's the um board member's son
[01:08:40] that it's allowed so they ended up like
[01:08:42] arguing with us and saying well we're
[01:08:43] not supposed to do what parents wants
[01:08:45] but he is good so we'll move it there
[01:08:46] and then they moved him then two games
[01:08:49] in they tried to move him back down and
[01:08:51] we're like all right guys you're not
[01:08:52] going to kill kill this kid's heart he's
[01:08:53] done this for you guys he's helped all
[01:08:55] of you out for years now three years now
[01:08:57] done everything you needed to help and
[01:08:59] you're going to dink him around like
[01:09:00] that no what and I we asked him what do
[01:09:02] you want to do he's like I'm quitting I
[01:09:03] don't want to play with them I want to

[01:13:44] to cut the package because the way that
[01:13:46] everything is I need to I don't like how
[01:13:47] it is uh there's extra plastic hanging
[01:13:49] around my container I know a little OCD
[01:13:53] is right there but that's just me cuz I
[01:13:57] don't like certain things and I do like
[01:13:58] other things so you like to have it all
[01:14:00] connected and organized
[01:14:06] there all right that was not bad there
[01:14:09] on those not bad we've had better we've
[01:14:12] had better we have had
[01:14:14] better right we have had better so let's
[01:14:17] see
[01:14:19] here all
[01:14:22] righty let's get this going and see what
[01:14:26] we got going on right now now for
[01:14:29] whatever reason on the I'm trying to
[01:14:30] figure out how to get um the other
[01:14:32] channels to show
[01:14:45] like why is it doing
[01:14:51] that my thing keeps breaking
[01:15:01] my think he's breaking my uh every time
[01:15:04] I think it has to do with me switching
[01:15:06] things around for the new whatnot setup
[01:15:08] so I don't think everything's connected
[01:15:09] right and that's I'll probably have to
[01:15:10] get the game running tomorrow is my
[01:15:15] guess dang it sorry guys the plan was to
[01:15:17] have it running today but I think all
[01:15:19] the connections aren't right because of
[01:15:20] um I didn't realize all the connections
[01:15:23] weren't right to my
[01:15:26] my uh streaming thing that I use to make
[01:15:28] everything pop up and that's going to
[01:15:30] take me a while to go through and fix so
[01:15:31] I can't just do that on stream so we
[01:15:34] we're going to
[01:15:35] Pivot we're going to open some stuff and
[01:15:37] we're gonna have some fun is what we're

[02:01:59] point probably not I can't deal with
[02:02:01] that stuff too many people are just not
[02:02:03] even about me it's more about my family
[02:02:05] I'd never do anything like that just
[02:02:07] because people are so disrespectful and
[02:02:09] horrible to the family members that I
[02:02:11] would never want to put my family
[02:02:13] through that if that makes any sense now
[02:02:14] if it was just like me and I didn't need
[02:02:16] to worry about people going after my
[02:02:17] family I can take that I always will be
[02:02:20] able to that's just kind of way I was
[02:02:22] built but I don't want to put my family
[02:02:25] through it it's one of those uh moral
[02:02:28] things people don't have any morals in
[02:02:30] that aspect anymore they'll go after a
[02:02:32] child and I don't want um I don't want
[02:02:34] to have that
[02:02:36] happen
[02:02:40] curiosa no on the Curio on any of these
[02:02:45] ones no on the curio you're very welcome
[02:02:47] Julie and I thank you very much for
[02:02:49] coming in and hanging
[02:02:50] out deep sea mermaids Amazon Warriors we
[02:02:55] have a swan maidens we have some
[02:02:57] spectral stalker we have a little bit of
[02:03:00] overpower the cave rolls let's check on
[02:03:02] the back of this
[02:03:04] one nope regular raw droom
[02:03:08] Dre mid night
[02:03:10] Rogue halberry bats we have some pirate
[02:03:15] ship we have a humble Village the guile
[02:03:19] Sirens nice
[02:03:22] like that my wife would like that for
[02:03:23] her deck she plays the water one
[02:03:27] Watchtower slumbering
[02:03:30] giantis into
[02:03:33] ooh smoke stack of knock unique sight
[02:03:37] look at that
[02:03:39] one other nearby sites lose their
[02:03:44] ability I know that's a nice one
[02:03:52] yeah if it wasn't for like I said if it
[02:03:54] wasn't for people like uh another
[02:03:57] mermaid and pirate ship I know good
[02:03:58] they'll go into her stuff she does the
[02:04:00] mermaid
[02:04:01] decks yeah if it wasn't for people got
[02:04:04] like um go after family members I would
[02:04:06] have a while of go a while ago probably
[02:04:08] have looked into doing some politics
[02:04:10] type stuff but sad thing is just people
[02:04:13] go after family members and I don't want
[02:04:16] to put my family through that it's
[02:04:19] a respect thing for my family and a lack
[02:04:22] of and they have a lack of respect for
[02:04:24] it so I have more respect for my family
[02:04:26] than the lack of respect the other
[02:04:27] people have to uh go after them if that
[02:04:31] makes any sense at all I don't know it's
[02:04:33] hard to
[02:04:36] explain kind of hard to
[02:04:44] explain I don't want to put my family
[02:04:46] through the trauma yeah I way yeah make
[02:04:48] that kind of makes sense at all

[02:09:41] even if I'm like going to do absolutely
[02:09:43] nothing wrong there's always some
[02:09:45] person I could be giving stuff away to

[02:09:51] person on the planet I could give stuff
[02:09:53] away and then you know what someone will
[02:09:54] get mad at me and attack one of my

[00:19:48] don't have something that's a
[00:19:49] significant difference like say two off
[00:19:52] all right it has to be two above each
[00:19:53] other so it can't be three and four it
[00:19:55] would have to be five and three you know
[00:19:56] that type of thing well flip a coin
[00:19:59] it'll be this one this is uh my like I

[00:20:08] he gets these coins and he he runs a
[00:20:09] dealership stuff but anyways he's got um
[00:20:12] these weird coins and he saw this one
[00:20:13] from New Hampshire and he's like hey

[00:20:21] actually a real dollar I didn't know

[01:20:43] expensive one but it's like 10
[01:20:46] bucks anywhere from a dollar to
[01:20:51] $10 so it really depends on uh the

[02:25:52] little stronger than
[02:25:54] normal shoot that weedling in the side
[02:25:57] as he goes running by you again to whip
[02:25:59] you with his Vines but he does get you
[02:26:02] with his Vines bringing you down to 70
[02:26:04] Health but you get a good shot off a
[02:26:07] nice one stucking hiside seems like he's
[02:26:10] weakened though he goes from 80 down to

[02:26:43] right before it gets
[02:26:44] you that weedling is
[02:26:47] shot because this time it actually does
[02:26:49] not have a big hit to you

[02:27:44] damaged you aim to that same area you
[02:27:46] got pretty good aim being agile and a
[02:27:48] scout there
[02:27:50] get him in the same spot and this
[02:27:53] weedling now goes down to 21
[02:27:57] health and it does though bring to 57

[03:14:16] specialed ones of secret lair they're
[03:14:18] not normally like this they are just
[03:14:21] this way because
[03:14:24] um how I drop all that they're just this
[03:14:28] way because of
[03:14:30] um they're the special edition
[03:14:35] things they normally don't all have the

[03:15:13] background there we go
[03:15:20] oh no problem I was just saying uh Sean
[03:15:21] had made a comment like person I say
[03:15:23] about uh newer cards and I just said the
[03:15:25] newer cards they are they look different
[03:15:26] me because uh these ones specifically
[03:15:28] are secret lair that's why they're
[03:15:30] different looking ones they're like
[03:15:31] special like kind of like special
[03:15:32] edition CS that you buy based on like
[03:15:35] say an artist or maybe uh say for
[03:15:38] instance Fallout was one of your big
[03:15:40] things you wanted a Fallout ones or
[03:15:42] maybe you like the murders of Carlo or
[03:15:44] you like The Outlaws or any of the sets
[03:15:45] that come out they generally do like one
[03:15:46] of the secret layers that go with them
[03:15:48] special and um that's really what this
[03:15:50] is but then then they give the extras
[03:15:53] sometimes too with them just random ones
[03:15:54] so there that's what comes on com out an
[03:15:58] a got one of these uh not necessarily
[03:16:00] one that goes specifically to a set but
[03:16:02] it was a nice one that I think people

[03:44:42] there see I um I got the to play uh El
[03:44:46] drain's in pre-release and that was
[03:44:47] really fun but I kind of got back in a
[03:44:50] little bit kind of like I was looking at
[03:44:52] Marshall machine a little bit and then
[03:44:55] uh my sons and I got back in with Lord
[03:44:57] of the Rings way
[03:44:59] bigger favorite commanders
[03:45:06] oh I do have to say I like my Dino one
[03:45:09] that I have my g off I've been using as
[03:45:11] a commander that's pretty fun but
[03:45:12] everybody goes right after you
[03:45:20] wow yeah that is expensive see I have
[03:45:22] mine were like 85 for the bundles oh I
[03:45:25] forgot [ __ ] these are expensive though
[03:45:28] that's the only problem these are not
[03:45:29] the uh regular bundles they're the gift
[03:45:32] bundles so I have some gift bundles I
[03:45:34] got
[03:45:38] in completely forgot about putting these
[03:45:40] in the buy
[03:45:42] now I got modern Horizon gift bundles in
[03:45:45] so you get three play
[03:45:47] boosters and a collector
[03:45:50] booster so you
[03:45:53] get nine of the play
[03:45:56] boosters and then one of the collector
[03:45:58] boosters plus you get a special dice
[03:46:01] traditional foil and regular basic lands
[03:46:03] and then you get an ALT card of the
[03:46:04] Power Balance plus the box
[03:46:06] there
[03:46:08] now problem
[03:46:11] is I guess other places decided to get
[03:46:14] get them at this better price than I did
[03:46:16] I'm guessing I don't know so I got to do
[03:46:19] this
[03:46:20] here put this in for it
[03:46:24] quickly because those ones are a little
[03:46:27] bit more expensive than the other
[03:46:28] bundles a little bit more expensive
[03:46:29] there so give me one
[03:46:34] second to put those down
[03:46:38] here because the only thing that sucked
[03:46:40] was I wasn't able to get
[03:46:43] the I had to give an okay
[03:46:47] price so we have those on
[03:47:04] here that's what they
[03:47:12] were those aren't cheap
[03:47:17] those will be yeah they're not going to
[03:47:19] be cheap that's the problem on
[03:47:24] my they're going to be 160 for those
[03:47:27] because they are the big bundles there
[03:47:29] with the collector booster in
[03:47:33] it but I can put those out there I was
[03:47:35] thinking of putting out that
[03:47:36] something wow that's
[03:47:42] awesome wow that's going for 200 that's
[03:47:45] a lot going up
[03:47:49] there oh what is
[03:47:56] it yeah that should be a fun one there
[03:47:58] that should be a fun one coming out yeah
[03:47:59] we're a big fan of the El's and Lord of
[03:48:00] the Rings one so you know it's what

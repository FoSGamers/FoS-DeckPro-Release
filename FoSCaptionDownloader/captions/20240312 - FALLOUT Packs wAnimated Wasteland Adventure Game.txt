[00:00:44] wheel going so that we can do the uh the
[00:00:48] Big Blue Book if you all want to do that
[00:00:51] that's that's right here as you can
[00:00:53] always see if you'd like that's uh I
[00:00:55] actually think I did I not put I had it
[00:00:57] in the notes and everything maybe it is
[00:00:59] not
[00:01:02] H have to figure out to put that in
[00:01:05] there
[00:01:14] then thought I had that in
[00:01:16] here looks like it
[00:01:21] isn't do it put it
[00:01:28] in that
[00:01:48] great I that one do
[00:01:52] work right so we're going to do it that
[00:01:54] way ah I see
[00:01:58] why
[00:02:02] this is it here that's our big blue
[00:02:06] book I got remove the
[00:02:08] wheel so you can see
[00:02:14] it there you go there did it remove it
[00:02:18] yet did not remove it
[00:02:22] yet I hung
[00:02:25] here it's going really really slow why
[00:02:28] is it doing that
[00:02:31] all that's better there you
[00:02:34] go how's your days going Mike and
[00:02:37] whoever else is hanging out here with me
[00:02:38] I was just getting this trying to add
[00:02:39] this in
[00:02:41] here all right
[00:02:43] screenshot it looks like that one worked
[00:02:45] that time all
[00:02:47] right put that right there we call
[00:02:58] that all right
[00:03:07] uh
[00:03:16] that there we go
[00:03:23] there beautiful I'll add that in there
[00:03:26] and then I will put in the frequently
[00:03:28] asked questions
[00:03:35] is
[00:03:36] the
[00:03:40] big there you
[00:03:44] go put that right in there so you know
[00:03:47] what it is
[00:03:50] now
[00:03:52] beautiful all right well if you want to
[00:03:54] try your luck on that what you do here
[00:03:56] is you get to spin that wheel you have
[00:03:57] 81 spots the uh High the ceiling here is
[00:04:02] uh
[00:04:03] a balin's tomb that's in there uh each
[00:04:07] part is $22 we have urner in this the
[00:04:09] reason why I have this available and I
[00:04:10] don't mind having it in the SE is
[00:04:12] because it I have I can show you the
[00:04:13] book and everything here you can see how
[00:04:16] what the floors are what the average
[00:04:18] price is where your uh floor hit uh how
[00:04:22] many of them there are and how many have
[00:04:23] been hit so there's been
[00:04:26] almost you know half of them almost have
[00:04:28] been hit there
[00:04:30] then this is what you have here so maybe
[00:04:31] you like want to you know force a
[00:04:33] negation or maybe you want one of these
[00:04:35] everybody lives or the pack negation you
[00:04:37] see there's a blank spot well with there
[00:04:39] be a blank spot what that means is if
[00:04:41] you hit one of the ones that has a blank
[00:04:43] spot you get your choice of packs of
[00:04:46] cards which are um going to be three
[00:04:50] like set boosters play boosters or you
[00:04:52] can get a mystery with two of them or
[00:04:54] you can put um like a mod Horizon with
[00:04:56] two of them uh that type of thing um or
[00:05:00] you could go with one of the
[00:05:02] Infinity uh collector boosters so that's
[00:05:05] what what you have a blank spot there
[00:05:07] but then if you have
[00:05:09] [Music]
[00:05:11] um the tree beard out events that you
[00:05:13] hit which is under $10 under $5 well you
[00:05:16] get a choice of one of those type of
[00:05:19] ones like the set boosters or play
[00:05:20] boosters plus one of the premium maybe a
[00:05:22] mystery or modern horizon or you can
[00:05:25] just go with two of those other ones
[00:05:27] there for your choice if you like now if
[00:05:28] you hit one that is $10 under you could
[00:05:31] choice of one of those but one of the
[00:05:32] set boosters or clay boosters so you
[00:05:34] just spin the wheel see where you land
[00:05:36] maybe you land on like I said I have
[00:05:37] some of it's been open and taken so we
[00:05:39] are not completely done but I was
[00:05:41] waiting until I hit the ceiling but it's
[00:05:44] been going for a while so maybe I'm not
[00:05:45] going to hit the ceiling because I mean
[00:05:47] I still have like ristic study in there
[00:05:49] watery grave
[00:05:52] retro know there's the Bailey tune like
[00:05:54] I said that's hanging out right
[00:05:56] there uh you know birds of paradise
[00:06:02] four hingus little Temple
[00:06:05] Garden River Song surge
[00:06:09] foil I mean there you go that's the big
[00:06:11] blue book if you want to try that
[00:06:16] [Applause]
[00:06:18] out not too bad have some fun with that
[00:06:25] one yeah I'll be here for a little while
[00:06:28] for I'll probably back um I might try
[00:06:30] out tomorrow another place um see how it
[00:06:34] goes but uh yeah no just uh I'll explain
[00:06:37] it later I'll have to not here I
[00:06:40] can't for whatever what you know for
[00:06:43] reasons
[00:06:47] but I'll explain it later kind of silly
[00:06:50] quite
[00:06:52] frankly once I I was like seriously but
[00:06:55] now boils down to being how silly it was
[00:06:57] I do need to actually uh
[00:07:02] have a lawyer now to check all the games
[00:07:04] to make sure things are
[00:07:09] good ah ah okay okay thank you thank you
[00:07:15] I was thinking it was there was one of
[00:07:16] three people that I was going to be that
[00:07:18] I was expecting it to be and you were
[00:07:19] one of those three so thank
[00:07:21] you thank you for help
[00:07:23] clarifying yeah I should be back like I
[00:07:25] said tomorrow um I took a little bit of
[00:07:27] a break from from from over there if I I
[00:07:30] got a little frustrated not with uh with
[00:07:33] with a little bit of the scenario uh
[00:07:35] that occurred so just
[00:07:38] uh there put it this way there were the
[00:07:41] days that I had
[00:07:43] issues um a certain person showed up or
[00:07:47] from a certain or one of their
[00:07:50] Associates and that was the only time
[00:07:52] I'd ever seen them in my
[00:07:54] show so that's where I'm going to leave
[00:07:57] it and then all of a sudden I had a
[00:07:59] problem problem of some kind which I
[00:08:00] never had and there was a different
[00:08:01] problem each time but you can get
[00:08:03] trouble for the same thing for different
[00:08:07] problems which seems really weird to
[00:08:11] me it's one of those like they tell you
[00:08:13] you did this wrong like all right
[00:08:15] correct I'll fix that well we didn't
[00:08:17] tell you you did that wrong also so and
[00:08:19] you didn't correct that so you're
[00:08:19] getting in trouble here like what
[00:08:25] the whatever we're I've been having some
[00:08:28] fun here uh opening things I actually
[00:08:29] the nice thing about here I was able to
[00:08:31] go through and um I wanted to open up
[00:08:33] and put my commander decks and I hadn't
[00:08:34] actually had a chance to look at those
[00:08:35] like frequently so I was able to go
[00:08:37] through and look at those and put them
[00:08:38] in the sleeves and actually look at the
[00:08:40] commander decks from Fallout for one of
[00:08:42] the first times ever I don't generally
[00:08:43] get to look at them because I'm going so
[00:08:44] quick through stuff so it's actually not
[00:08:46] bad for Fallout for that aspect but I'll
[00:08:48] be back with a bunch of Fallout stuff
[00:08:50] anyways I have a lot of it all over I'm
[00:08:52] all over now be that between different
[00:08:54] places um I
[00:08:56] actually put some stuff up on Tik Tok
[00:08:59] talk my wife and my children were saying
[00:09:00] I need to do that now like oh my God I
[00:09:03] think I have one video and pictures out
[00:09:05] there that's about it that's a little
[00:09:07] more effort that I want to put but I
[00:09:08] don't know they said do that so you can
[00:09:10] do lives I'm like I don't
[00:09:15] know but they're telling me that's I'm
[00:09:18] I'm doing what the kids say because
[00:09:20] they've been so far they've been pretty
[00:09:21] good I mean they come out with their uh
[00:09:23] they come out with their animations and
[00:09:25] stuff with that tell me what to do with
[00:09:26] their all their ideas and I got almost
[00:09:28] all done about 90%
[00:09:36] done oh thank you you know I very much
[00:09:38] appreciate that
[00:09:40] Mike I do very much appreciate that now
[00:09:43] from what from pretty much um I was like
[00:09:47] no matter what happened I sent them
[00:09:49] videos I even show I'm like dude you can
[00:09:51] see the kids doing this um like and then
[00:09:54] they like it pretty much doesn't matter
[00:09:57] um they said get a lawyer so I got a
[00:10:00] lawyer sucks that the world just boils
[00:10:03] down to that is the way the world boils
[00:10:04] now is that no matter what you do even
[00:10:07] if you're trying to do something right
[00:10:08] you still have to get a lawyer to do the
[00:10:10] right thing it's weird to me but hey if
[00:10:13] you're trying to have fun be nice that's
[00:10:15] that's what he boils down to in this
[00:10:16] world now there somebody that always
[00:10:18] complains for some reason and ruins it
[00:10:20] for everyone
[00:10:22] else but I still get to do the games
[00:10:25] here which is fun I get to play all the
[00:10:27] games here and uh without any kind of
[00:10:30] like restrictions because I've never
[00:10:32] really done anything that was going to
[00:10:33] be screwing anyone actually it was
[00:10:34] always giving somebody something extra
[00:10:36] just for hanging out which is the like
[00:10:39] why I was always very confused because
[00:10:41] that's like uh you know that's like play
[00:10:43] Monopoly at uh um when you go to you
[00:10:48] know when you go to McDonald's you get
[00:10:50] one of the McDon you Monopoly card there
[00:10:52] you know like you you it's the same
[00:10:55] concept that's literally what I was kind
[00:10:57] of referencing it after
[00:11:02] things like that you
[00:11:04] know do know you see it oh yeah here
[00:11:07] here
[00:11:10] ready yeah it's
[00:11:13] awesome dude I'm so excited about it I
[00:11:16] have um I have we actually I forgot to
[00:11:17] put it up on my um Instagram we made a
[00:11:19] video we were opening it to show the
[00:11:21] kids and they were like oh look it's got
[00:11:23] green eyes I was going to tell him to
[00:11:24] put green eyes is what will said and so
[00:11:27] uh uh our buddy K like he he decided
[00:11:30] that like putting the yellow the green
[00:11:32] eyes there for I mean it was like
[00:11:34] exactly what will was even thinking

[00:19:07] commander Decks that we opened and see
[00:19:08] what
[00:19:10] happens yeah the bobbleheads I know dude
[00:19:13] the bobbleheads are Wick it hard to
[00:19:16] find and I can't believe we got that
[00:19:18] many in one it was like a box I mean
[00:19:20] that box like I feel like I need to name
[00:19:22] the the video godbox like legit
[00:19:26] godbox like I I know what like that's
[00:19:28] the only thing I can think of like it it
[00:19:30] reminds me of a legitimate God box like
[00:19:32] that when people say that that's what I
[00:19:33] think of when you have $700 worth of
[00:19:36] cards pulled out of a
[00:19:40] box I'm G to open
[00:19:43] that but if like that's what I mean like
[00:19:45] my family gets luck and I think uh I
[00:19:47] think some people don't like seeing that
[00:19:48] we get luck for
[00:19:57] people
[00:20:02] my audio my audio leaves every now and
[00:20:05] again so I have to have an earbud in
[00:20:07] here and then go and adjust it as I have
[00:20:09] to talk to their tech support people to
[00:20:11] figure out what's going on here but that
[00:20:12] is like my only glitch with this going
[00:20:14] on recently just the ear uh music The
[00:20:17] Sound dropping in and
[00:20:20] out all righty let's see what we got
[00:20:24] here all right this is mine for my uh oh
[00:20:27] you're the greatest card ever
[00:20:29] discover the coolest card it says it's
[00:20:31] the coolest card oh no the coolest cards
[00:20:33] oh I made a mistake there my reading is
[00:20:35] so
[00:20:37] bad it's one of my favorite things when
[00:20:39] I put out anything on YouTube everybody
[00:20:40] there's somebody that comes in and
[00:20:41] comments every single time the three
[00:20:45] mystery packs oh buddy the three mystery
[00:20:47] packs if you want to know what those are
[00:20:48] if you check the frequently asked
[00:20:50] questions what you do is you get to play
[00:20:51] a little game where you get three of
[00:20:53] them and we line them up in front front
[00:20:55] of there's uh three boxes they'll have
[00:20:57] the father son and the I can kind of
[00:20:59] show you but it says father son and
[00:21:02] buyer and what happens each one of those
[00:21:04] boxes have like cards in them um and we
[00:21:06] open each one of these which one of
[00:21:08] these we'll say we pull one of these out
[00:21:10] and flip it over and actually you know
[00:21:11] what I think I have some was pulled out
[00:21:12] the other day there you go so like we
[00:21:15] got one of these that was pulled out of
[00:21:16] here the other yesterday or the day
[00:21:17] before you flip that over this is LCI
[00:21:19] draft you have three of them lined up in
[00:21:21] each one of the front of the box and
[00:21:22] it's like a it's like in carnival game
[00:21:24] where you throw the dart at the board
[00:21:25] you pop a balloon well whichever one has
[00:21:27] a high mon value is the one that pops
[00:21:29] the
[00:21:30] balloon uh and that's the one the Box
[00:21:33] you get an extra pull from like the
[00:21:34] father's box is just like a card the
[00:21:36] buyer the sun's box is a card you might
[00:21:38] want to play um in the VA Vault I mean
[00:21:41] the buyer's box is one that you um uh
[00:21:44] you might get an extra pack out of and
[00:21:46] that's how that game goes there um it is
[00:21:48] in the show notes also if you have any
[00:21:49] questions on it it's actually pretty fun
[00:21:51] we had a lot of fun doing that one uh my
[00:21:53] kids were the it was the first one that
[00:21:55] we came up with my boys because they
[00:21:56] wanted to play a game with us together
[00:21:58] on the show then that's how uh that's
[00:22:00] how I hit game you keep all three packs
[00:22:03] every time guaranteed keep those packs
[00:22:05] you never lose those packs it's only you
[00:22:07] could get you get something extra
[00:22:09] whether it is like a just a like I said
[00:22:11] just a card a card you might want to
[00:22:13] play with or a uh or like a pack extra
[00:22:16] pack that's really what it is
[00:22:19] yeah all right a little colonel
[00:22:22] autum oh dragon skull Sumit I haven't
[00:22:24] seen that extended art
[00:22:26] yet I like the uh I like the art though

[00:22:52] after I'm going to put these right here
[00:22:53] for you though because we do have to uh
[00:22:55] just so you know that pack is a moving
[00:22:58] this I'm going to put that pack right

[00:23:20] think this one um you guys seem to like
[00:23:23] this one a
[00:23:26] lot so here you go what do here is since
[00:23:29] my son's not here um he would normally
[00:23:32] pick the one for the son and I would
[00:23:33] pick the one for the father and you will
[00:23:35] pick the one for the buyer but since
[00:23:36] he's not here you get to pick the one
[00:23:38] for um you get to pick the one for the
[00:23:40] sun and the buyer so just let me know
[00:23:42] where you want to go we'll pick that and
[00:23:45] um yeah we'll go from

[00:24:10] buyer I think there's maybe 120 150
[00:24:13] cards in there I don't know exactly how
[00:24:15] many but it's just like I said we just
[00:24:16] flip them over and see which is which
[00:24:19] then we go from there and now if I have
[00:24:20] if you pull something out that I happen
[00:24:22] or not to have I give you an alternative
[00:24:25] to it just because I'm waiting for stuff

[00:24:30] in um so if I don't have that I will be
[00:24:33] giving an
[00:24:34] alternative to come in so that's what it
[00:24:36] is
[00:24:37] there uh yeah pick like you can do
[00:24:39] random or you can say hey I want to go

[00:25:25] then for the I'm going to do one kind of
[00:25:27] in the back here now what I do always do
[00:25:29] is I like to give you the opportunity if

[00:25:33] and you want to change them

[00:26:29] Bo there you go there you

[00:27:13] from Mystery all right go to the mystery
[00:27:17] you got very lucky my friend got pulled
[00:27:19] out that then you got the one to get the
[00:27:21] option to get the mystery one there
[00:27:22] because you got the set booster on top
[00:27:24] of it you got a set a collector you got
[00:27:27] two sets in a collector and then nice
[00:27:29] hits dude nice hits dude you got some
[00:27:32] luck this morning all right we're going
[00:27:34] to rip open the father and then we go
[00:27:36] all the way down to the buyer that's the
[00:27:37] way we go we want to see who uh who has
[00:27:40] the highest mono value we like to see um
[00:27:42] we like to see the father first that's
[00:27:44] what we do all right John let's see here
[00:27:47] I have a feeling you might even be
[00:27:48] getting another pack because ior's got
[00:27:49] some big hits here all right that is
[00:27:52] pushed all the way in we go there's our
[00:27:54] AR
[00:27:55] card Forest slash
[00:27:59] unicorn plundering
[00:28:02] Barbarian SL silver Raven you find a
[00:28:06] cursed Idol you see a pair of goblins
[00:28:09] and traid Outlander you happen on a
[00:28:12] Glade you see a guard approach to be
[00:28:16] ambushed on the road by orcus Prince of
[00:28:19] undeath
[00:28:21] nice that's a nice little hit there if I
[00:28:24] remember right planner
[00:28:26] Ally
[00:28:28] and then you have your list card of
[00:28:30] splicers skill and I think planner Ally
[00:28:33] with your uh five might be the highest
[00:28:36] one you got
[00:28:45] here nice hits there I think those ones
[00:28:48] uh nice hit on that one on that uh
[00:28:51] Prince and do this here get this one in
[00:28:53] a top loader make sure that stays
[00:28:56] protected
[00:28:59] and then number six is our high here and
[00:29:04] let's see what's going on on this baby
[00:29:05] with our
[00:29:10] Mysteries we have a shining
[00:29:14] aerosur midnight Gard laboratory brute
[00:29:19] negate oh shambling attendance that's
[00:29:21] going to be a hard one to hit beat there
[00:29:23] for an eight quest of the Grave Lord for
[00:29:25] the grave Lord hammerand I'll put those
[00:29:28] on down like
[00:29:29] that
[00:29:32] Firebolt numra spider n
[00:29:36] pack roshi Meer
[00:29:40] Mander Mander Meander Farm stad
[00:29:45] Gleaner Su saying oh that's a nice
[00:29:48] little one
[00:29:50] there Aldrich Evolution oh that's a
[00:29:53] pretty good one too if I remember
[00:29:55] right and then you got a Bing sliver oh
[00:29:58] you got to sliver one of those I think
[00:30:00] those are pretty I think that's a decent
[00:30:01] one of the uh test cards by the way so
[00:30:04] we going to do this because that is
[00:30:06] seven and I believe your other ones
[00:30:09] there may be a few bucks so I'm going to
[00:30:11] put those in sleeves here the reason why
[00:30:13] I do these back to back is because if
[00:30:15] they are um anywhere near like $10 I
[00:30:17] have to put them in top loaders and then
[00:30:19] when they are in top loaders they don't
[00:30:20] slide out like this so I'm going to do
[00:30:22] that but I'm going to do this here I'm
[00:30:23] going to have a hard think you're going
[00:30:24] have a hard time though beating the um
[00:30:27] gambling attendance but with ioria you
[00:30:30] do have a
[00:30:31] chance you definitely yeah you're
[00:30:33] getting some good hits
[00:30:35] here definitely getting Good
[00:30:39] Hits all right here we
[00:30:42] go and there is a not a misprint on this
[00:30:46] one see I'm looking for the card the
[00:30:48] first one that doesn't have the line
[00:30:49] down the middle I'm going to consider it
[00:30:50] a a non- misprint card because every
[00:30:53] single one of them has the line down the
[00:30:55] middle for the token
[00:30:59] boot
[00:30:59] nier frostvale Ambush fire prophecy
[00:31:04] night Squad Commando Zenith Flair will
[00:31:07] of the all Hunter
[00:31:10] Plaines daring fiend
[00:31:13] bonder lava Brink
[00:31:16] Venture I haven't seen that one
[00:31:20] much Lis of the dream den oh that's a
[00:31:23] nice little hit there I think it used to
[00:31:25] be at least migratory Gra
[00:31:27] horn hunt Master
[00:31:30] lier zagoth
[00:31:33] triome there you go
[00:31:36] buddy nice hit there and dorette the
[00:31:40] perfect pet it's not maybe the biggest
[00:31:43] one but then of chittering
[00:31:44] harvester you know what you got a zagoth
[00:31:47] triome out of that that was a big hit
[00:31:50] dude you spent $9 and got sweet packs
[00:31:53] there and I think that the sun has the
[00:31:56] biggest with eight I don't think I saw a
[00:31:58] bigger one than eight in here when I was
[00:32:00] I'm just double checking to make sure I
[00:32:02] always like to double check to make sure
[00:32:04] I don't want to screw anyone Y no there
[00:32:06] is no eight there I mean I don't think
[00:32:08] you're GNA get screwed right
[00:32:10] now this card alone pays for all of
[00:32:14] it I know I know this is what I'm trying
[00:32:18] to tell you all this is generally the
[00:32:19] games that I play there's like a there's
[00:32:21] like a 50-50 chance that I got
[00:32:24] [Laughter]
[00:32:26] screwed every time that I play one of
[00:32:28] I'm like I don't know if I should play
[00:32:29] these anymore so maybe it's a good thing
[00:32:31] I'm not allowed to uh um on that larger
[00:32:34] group you know
[00:32:36] Mike but that was a nice hit
[00:32:40] buddy we have fun though I don't have I
[00:32:42] don't mind I I calculate all this in I'm
[00:32:44] good we're good we had a good hit that
[00:32:46] was a nice one there we like that nice
[00:32:48] zag off triome and I'm gonna probably
[00:32:50] end up putting another card in there so
[00:32:51] it doesn't slide out because sometimes
[00:32:53] they do slide out when the shipping
[00:32:54] happens there but nice hits there now
[00:32:56] you get a poll from the Suns box you can
[00:32:59] tell me where to go if you want um or I
[00:33:01] can do random for you it's up to
[00:33:06] you um and then uh the other thing I'm
[00:33:10] going to do is um I do I just really
[00:33:12] like you know I don't you don't get to
[00:33:14] keep the r cards I do take those just

[00:35:30] sons thought it was pretty fun when we
[00:35:32] made it so uh they they were like they
[00:35:34] like do some animations do some
[00:35:35] animations so I made some
[00:35:38] animations to go with our
[00:35:41] game and now Mike the way we do it here
[00:35:43] is um very similar to what you're aware
[00:35:48] of cards here that we
[00:35:51] Shuff and then the Vault here is uh the
[00:35:54] Vault pack here is just a pack of cards
[00:35:56] from uh this one is currently from 1993
[00:36:00] but I'm going to show you some cards I
[00:36:01] have an intriguing thing of me
[00:36:03] doing I appreciate that I'll grab the
[00:36:05] art cards I will do that I appreciate
[00:36:07] that a lot I'll take those where's the
[00:36:13] mouse come on Mouse there we go thank
[00:36:18] you I'll take those I'll take those out
[00:36:19] of there before I do shipping and
[00:36:20] everything because I got to pack
[00:36:21] everything up
[00:36:23] nice I got to show you some cool packs
[00:36:25] of cards after for that I got that we're
[00:36:27] going to be doing something intriguing
[00:36:29] um one night and it's only going to be
[00:36:30] at night so we did that one sorry we did
[00:36:34] that I got to go to the next one we're
[00:36:37] on this Mike you got your pack here
[00:36:39] you're starting at one strength for your
[00:36:41] adventure through the
[00:36:43] Wasteland and you get to choose what you
[00:36:45] want to be for a character as you travel
[00:36:48] through the Wasteland there all right
[00:36:50] now I have about 90% of it done just
[00:36:53] because uh just little backed up from
[00:36:55] other things I was doing you know had to
[00:36:58] change things around so we're gonna be a
[00:37:00] strong human as we wander through this
[00:37:01] Wasteland wonderful Mike Mike is
[00:37:04] wonderful big strong
[00:37:07] human as you wander through this
[00:37:09] Wasteland you're looking for food you
[00:37:11] want some type of food that'll help you
[00:37:13] maybe it'll make you big and strong
[00:37:15] let's see strong human where do you want
[00:37:18] to go I can do random for all of them or
[00:37:20] you can tell me specifically like uh
[00:37:21] there's 70 like I said I think there's
[00:37:22] 78 cards in each one plus the blue is
[00:37:25] only 12
[00:37:28] so you're wandering through the
[00:37:29] Wasteland as a strong human and we're
[00:37:30] doing random for all so I'm going to do
[00:37:33] this so I like to do these ones where it
[00:37:36] picks out one card at a time there we go
[00:37:39] one card that is one card and we got oh
[00:37:43] we got a
[00:37:44] treasure let's see what happens here the
[00:37:47] human goes and picks up some treasure
[00:37:49] and goes oh no let's this thing tries to
[00:37:51] bite it that does not work doesn't taste
[00:37:54] good swallow some goes oh
[00:37:57] I almost choked on that
[00:37:59] thing well that's not working down to
[00:38:02] one down from one strength to zero
[00:38:04] strength he's now wandering around
[00:38:06] around the Wasteland choking on a coin
[00:38:08] that he thought was maybe uh maybe some
[00:38:10] type of potato I don't
[00:38:12] know here we go this strong human though
[00:38:15] maybe maybe he'll find a friend that'll
[00:38:16] help him along the way as he wanders
[00:38:17] through the
[00:38:18] Wasteland we get this here let's see
[00:38:21] what we get
[00:38:22] here watering through the Wasteland in
[00:38:25] this human
[00:38:28] finds a
[00:38:30] clue wonderful finds a clue this clue
[00:38:34] come he picks up this thing and he goes
[00:38:35] hey buddy if you pull that thing out of
[00:38:37] your throat you're going to be feeling a
[00:38:38] lot better the strong human goes and
[00:38:41] grabs and grabs tweezers pulls that
[00:38:43] thing out of his throat goes I can
[00:38:45] finally breathe
[00:38:48] again that was just a friend came over
[00:38:50] with a clue goes dude pull that right on
[00:38:52] out that's your friend coming over to
[00:38:54] help you brought you a clue to take that
[00:38:57] out you're breathing better now you're
[00:38:58] back up to one strength wandering
[00:39:00] through the Wasteland wonderful let's
[00:39:03] see what happens
[00:39:06] Mike here we
[00:39:08] go Shuffle these ones up and we do
[00:39:10] random for all so I'm going to shuffle
[00:39:11] these and we're going to go with
[00:39:13] whichever one we open up here which kind
[00:39:15] of seems to be that that one seems to be
[00:39:17] hiding that one does that one's hiding
[00:39:19] in the background there we'll see if
[00:39:21] that one's it you're looking for a
[00:39:22] companion along the way to help you Mike
[00:39:25] let's see what happens oh no a fungus
[00:39:28] dinosaur comes out of nowhere he grabs
[00:39:30] you by the leg throws you and you land
[00:39:33] by a pawn but that's
[00:39:35] okay you get able to you're able to
[00:39:38] slide into that pawn and hide from the
[00:39:40] Fungus dinosaur he doesn't know what's
[00:39:41] going on and there he is just stuck
[00:39:44] there but that's okay you get away you
[00:39:47] only have you have zero strength you're
[00:39:49] not dead though you go wandering through
[00:39:51] the Wasteland you aren't completely dead
[00:39:53] that's that's not good you hit that
[00:39:55] fungus dinosaur but you know
[00:39:57] what let's see what happens maybe maybe
[00:40:01] we're going to not get beat completely
[00:40:04] maybe we're not going to get beat on
[00:40:05] completely maybe there'll be somebody
[00:40:06] small let's see what happens
[00:40:09] here I'm going to go with this and
[00:40:13] go oh no going to go this one I think
[00:40:16] that one's the one there that we want to
[00:40:18] go with let's see that one seem to be

[00:40:30] crushing you down in the ground you're
[00:40:32] barely able to walk but you see a vault
[00:40:34] in the distance and you go oh my I got
[00:40:36] to get over there you crawl over to that
[00:40:38] Vault and in that Vault for some reason

[00:47:09] top loader and I know this one's going
[00:47:10] to be $10 or above so I get in a top

[00:47:30] good boxes here that's all I got to

[00:47:37] get some from overseas I'm waiting for
[00:47:39] more to show up
[00:47:40] actually I had um potentially more but
[00:47:44] my um fing long story
[00:47:47] short they paid on the wrong card and
[00:47:50] then it didn't come in right so I don't
[00:47:51] know what's going to happen on that one
[00:47:53] I had the wrong card selected so it
[00:47:55] didn't go through threw the right win
[00:47:56] one and like [ __ ] I had the wrong
[00:48:01] card so uh I'm hoping that after I
[00:48:04] changed it I still get it but uh we'll
[00:48:07] see what happens there because that that
[00:48:08] will suck if I lose six of them because

[00:52:11] Diego somewhere this off oh the offer
[00:52:14] expired in
[00:52:15] 1994 I might have a hard time getting
[00:52:20] him all right so we're going to scratch
[00:52:22] these off because we don't have an
[00:52:23] opponent to play with oh wait there's
[00:52:25] more
[00:52:26] oh hold on hold on hold on this is
[00:52:28] Thoroughly confusing I don't know what's
[00:52:30] going on
[00:52:33] here oh my God there's a ton of these
[00:52:35] scratching
[00:52:37] cards so these are all your
[00:52:40] purses you purses and trading post all
[00:52:43] right Advanced combat that's an
[00:52:46] interesting one
[00:52:48] there Jester Quest okay A little Jester
[00:52:53] Quest sham
[00:52:57] I don't know what that one is I don't
[00:52:58] know what that one
[00:52:59] is vorian
[00:53:03] Knight oh peaceful
[00:53:07] calm and St Cher all right all right so
[00:53:09] I don't think I can scratch all these
[00:53:11] here and play this so this is what we're
[00:53:13] GNA do here
[00:53:17] Mike is there a way that we
[00:53:21] can like stream together so that I can
[00:53:24] open one you can scratch yours and we
[00:53:26] can play
[00:53:30] together so I feel like we should do
[00:53:33] that once you get yours like I feel like
[00:53:37] that's what needs to be done right
[00:53:39] here what do you
[00:53:42] think just with so many of the
[00:53:44] scratching
[00:53:45] things or I can scratch them all but I
[00:53:48] mean what do you think I I mean there's
[00:53:50] a ton of them to scratch you just have
[00:53:51] to do them against each other to play a
[00:53:52] game that's the way it works I guess is
[00:53:54] against each each
[00:53:57] other so I don't know I think that might
[00:54:00] be a good idea to try
[00:54:02] that all right yeah let's try it all
[00:54:04] right I'm gonna put these back in here
[00:54:06] so you have the directions and
[00:54:07] everything all right and I'm going to
[00:54:10] get that shipped up for you mik and we
[00:54:13] are going to end up playing some battle

[01:18:32] going to run it for a few minutes though
[01:18:33] that way
[01:18:34] um I'll show these off a little bit Yeah
[01:18:38] my yeah dude I had my old collection
[01:18:41] wasn't the great like I was I was I'm
[01:18:42] going to preface not that anybody cares
[01:18:44] I was a poor kid so I couldn't afford
[01:18:46] expensive things that was whatever I got
[01:18:48] out of a pack and what I was lucky to
[01:18:49] have or traded for so like I have as you
[01:18:53] can
[01:18:54] see ice age was one of the ones that I
[01:18:57] had back in the day then uh I had Mirage
[01:19:00] now this is I think uh I can't remember
[01:19:02] what color deck this one was what deck
[01:19:04] color was this
[01:19:06] one this is how I kept everything was in
[01:19:09] the boxes and this is the plastic so the
[01:19:11] boxes didn't fall apart like that's how
[01:19:13] anal I
[01:19:18] was man IFI my collection some people
[01:19:20] didn't care for the max Diamond Back
[01:19:22] Then it is yeah I know exactly it wasn't
[01:19:25] considered great car back at that time I
[01:19:28] don't even know what I have for it if I
[01:19:29] I don't know if I like like here like
[01:19:31] here you go like stream of Life nice one
[01:19:35] there crawl
[01:19:37] worm see I'm just like these are all my
[01:19:40] yeah oh this is my green and blue I
[01:19:41] guess green and blue deck made a green
[01:19:44] and blue
[01:19:51] deck
[01:20:01] audio cut out again that's why I have
[01:20:03] the earbud
[01:20:08] in yeah yeah I know I had so many some
[01:20:10] of the cards that I had I'm like I I
[01:20:12] traded them away I'm like oh son of a
[01:20:14] [ __ ] I can't believe I traded that card
[01:20:16] away but even back then look at my cards
[01:20:18] this is how well I took care of them
[01:20:20] look at how that card is and that was
[01:20:22] these are all played cards look at how
[01:20:25] well I took care of them even though
[01:20:26] they have like the little marks I played
[01:20:28] these daily with my friends and that's
[01:20:31] how how like my other friend's cards
[01:20:32] were torn apart some of them like that
[01:20:35] pissed me off if I had that little ding
[01:20:37] on the top of it so I always had to pay
[01:20:39] very close attention like when I
[01:20:41] shuffled and
[01:20:43] stuff but these were all my
[01:20:47] uh I love the the Arts there my old
[01:20:50] cards
[01:20:51] there and remember guys the uh it's two
[01:20:54] strength right here if you want to do
[01:20:55] the adventure through the Wasteland like
[01:20:57] I said it is actually almost fully in
[01:21:00] animated depending where you go through
[01:21:02] we have a 90% of it is animated for your
[01:21:05] characters you know maybe you're going
[01:21:06] to be a technician or something like
[01:21:08] that but here we go going to roll
[01:21:10] through keep showing I just kind of
[01:21:12] shown off my old stuff that was in that
[01:21:14] box there like I said not I was poor I
[01:21:17] started out with not a lot of money so I
[01:21:19] was lucky enough to have stuff any of
[01:21:21] anything at all so
[01:21:23] I was pretty happy with what I was able
[01:21:24] to build I always got smoked though
[01:21:26] because all the other kids I played with
[01:21:27] had
[01:21:28] money and uh they always had like really
[01:21:31] good
[01:21:36] cards you could have afford a house I
[01:21:46] know oh you GRE up your parents who they
[01:21:48] own a gaming shop all right that helps a
[01:21:50] little bit why I believe that no my
[01:21:52] parents my father was a fisherman uh he
[01:21:54] owned his own fishing boat well over
[01:21:56] time he eventually got to owning his own
[01:21:57] fishing boat uh my mom was actually a
[01:21:59] bus driver she drove the sped bus
[01:22:02] um um that's probably inappropriate to
[01:22:04] say now the special education bus or the
[01:22:07] handy I don't know what they're I don't
[01:22:09] know what I'm supposed to say anymore
[01:22:10] she drove the bus for nice kids that had
[01:22:12] mental in uh problems probably the
[01:22:14] nicest people in the world I'm just
[01:22:16] going to put that out there are people
[01:22:18] with mental
[01:22:19] disabilities at least the ones that I've
[01:22:21] ever met the only time that has ever
[01:22:24] been a problem is when they've been like
[01:22:25] um like the ones that were like uh um
[01:22:28] some of them to get vicious though but
[01:22:30] very rarely do you run it but
[01:22:34] anyways get back to this
[01:22:38] stuff put that away there come on I
[01:22:40] don't want to put I don't want to Dent
[01:22:41] the cards or anything get in
[01:22:44] there there we go yeah but I have this
[01:22:47] is my whole box here this is my box of
[01:22:50] uh my box of cards
[01:22:56] they could have been a CH Game Changer I
[01:22:58] know that's it does that all the time
[01:22:59] too like you don't realize what it was
[01:23:03] like let me see if I can find
[01:23:07] them here's an example I think
[01:23:20] of here's an example of like what you do
[01:23:23] as a kid and you don't think of it all
[01:23:31] right these were like my basketball
[01:23:34] cards that I saved by the way but I had
[01:23:38] um where is
[01:23:44] it the [ __ ] is that
[01:23:51] card okay so there's that
[01:23:54] one I swear I had another one
[01:23:57] though maybe that was the only one
[01:23:59] actually that's because why I swear I
[01:24:01] had another one is because I remember
[01:24:03] when I was younger I traded it away
[01:24:04] being like Oh give me all these I want
[01:24:06] to take those
[01:24:08] things no I
[01:24:11] mean I think that was a good trade at
[01:24:13] the time it might have still been a good
[01:24:15] trade I haven't even looked at the price
[01:24:16] of all the cards that I have but you
[01:24:18] know you're a kid you don't think about
[01:24:19] it
[01:24:21] right
[01:24:25] yeah
[01:24:27] yep
[01:24:29] exactly so I had I had basketball and
[01:24:32] baseball cards and hockey you know
[01:24:34] football cards and stuff like that but
[01:24:36] um I had uh there's my other
[01:24:40] card none of these are in like sleeves
[01:24:42] other than these
[01:24:44] things so I had probably a dozen Jordan
[01:24:50] cards including a few rookie
[01:24:55] ones I traded them for a bunch of other
[01:24:59] people I probably I I traded like them
[01:25:02] away over time for other people but
[01:25:05] you're like and I just kept the one that
[01:25:07] I wanted I'm like you got to be like
[01:25:10] thinking back I'm like if I there one of
[01:25:11] the cards that I I'm like I looked at
[01:25:14] one of the cards I'm like if I kept that
[01:25:16] card it was like a $7,000 card like you
[01:25:19] got to be kidding me but you're a kid
[01:25:21] you're like oh I I want I want Shaq D I
[01:25:24] already got this Jordan one I want a
[01:25:25] Shaq
[01:25:27] instead so that's what
[01:25:31] happens all right I'm G to put this back
[01:25:33] and we're just going to do one uh the
[01:25:34] adventure game with just with just uh a
[01:25:39] thing
[01:25:40] here a uh uh fallout
[01:25:44] here oh that's nice that you cutt that
[01:25:47] at
[01:25:49] least all right so what I'm going to do
[01:25:52] here here is I have a box that we are
[01:25:55] opening for the store for people to be
[01:25:58] able to buy singles from I was going to
[01:26:00] be I was doing them live randomly like
[01:26:02] kind of Pack openings so I'll do one
[01:26:04] right now we'll see what happens and if
[01:26:05] anybody wants anything out of here that
[01:26:07] I am not going to speci like do I'm
[01:26:08] keeping that we'll see what happens all
[01:26:15] right oh that sucks I got sold on you by
[01:26:18] your parents my I um so long story short
[01:26:21] draw my um my father passed away 20
[01:26:24] years ago and when that happened we
[01:26:25] couldn't afford everything that we had
[01:26:26] at the house CU he was the he was the
[01:26:28] bread winner um so we had to sell the
[01:26:30] house and when moving out a bunch of
[01:26:32] [ __ ] got thrown out um and I wasn't
[01:26:34] around to see it get thrown out I had um
[01:26:38] baseball cards some magic cards that
[01:26:41] were still there I had
[01:26:43] Legos like all I would have taken all
[01:26:45] the Legos because my kids are able to
[01:26:47] use them later on in life I had Ninja
[01:26:49] Turtles like all like original Ninja
[01:26:52] Turtles that are like some of these
[01:26:54] things would have been worth like $100
[01:26:56] couple hundred doll and they were just
[01:26:57] thrown away and I didn't know I'm like I
[01:26:59] was in college and people were moving
[01:27:01] out when that happened so it wasn't
[01:27:03] really my fault and I wasn't paying
[01:27:05] attention it wasn't my mom's fault it
[01:27:06] was just they were getting rid of stuff
[01:27:07] because they didn't have
[01:27:11] room just thinking about the stuff that
[01:27:13] gets thrown away but
[01:27:15] anyways like that stuff I believe is in
[01:27:17] a
[01:27:18] landfill I'm going to read I'm going to
[01:27:20] check this and if you guys want anything
[01:27:21] from here let me
[01:27:27] know oh really hey
[01:27:39] John now you've been winning a lot so I
[01:27:42] can't give this to you this time maybe
[01:27:43] another time that year and we'll see
[01:27:44] what happens if I have him left or maybe
[01:27:46] I can switch it out for the vault if you
[01:27:48] wanted to play uh the Wasteland
[01:27:51] Adventure
[01:27:55] but look what cards I have I got a few
[01:27:58] of these in
[01:28:04] here I have some other ones too I have
[01:28:06] another Power Ranger
[01:28:10] set yes it would
[01:28:13] be that that would definitely worth some

[01:33:05] say a little thank you to everybody that
[01:33:07] comes in and hangs out you know type
[01:33:08] thing because uh you know just my the
[01:33:13] boys they're eight and 10 will will
[01:33:15] sometimes help me when it comes to um
[01:33:17] like organizing cards because he plays
[01:33:19] and he does a very good job to a job
[01:33:22] organizing him for like getting him
[01:33:23] ready to like put like for shipping him
[01:33:26] um so but that's the only thing that
[01:33:28] he'll do sometimes but I always I'm
[01:33:30] sitting next to him when he's doing it
[01:33:31] making sure everything's going good I to
[01:33:34] kick him out the other day because he
[01:33:35] wasn't paying enough attention and he
[01:33:36] was distracted by something going on bu
[01:33:38] you distracted
[01:33:44] Leaf yeah all right cool yeah you that's
[01:33:46] what it is like we kind of get actual
[01:33:48] use out of them exactly we use them for
[01:33:50] something not many people use them for
[01:33:51] anything uh they kind of just sit around
[01:33:53] and we we try to use them we figure it
[01:33:55] was a fun thing everybody all like a
[01:33:57] bunch of packs have our cards in them
[01:33:59] and we were like what what can we do
[01:34:00] with these things and uh that's what we
[01:34:04] figured out we worked out worked out
[01:34:06] pretty
[01:34:11] good yeah a lot of people seem to like
[01:34:13] them too that the kid you know it's just
[01:34:14] like something that like I said
[01:34:15] something kids want to get the part
[01:34:18] of get a 12 10 and a six-year-old so
[01:34:20] yeah exactly they always want to be part
[01:34:22] of it exactly so you got to figure out
[01:34:24] something for them to be part of it and
[01:34:26] and same for the fact that my my
[01:34:28] 10-year-old was the one that said start
[01:34:30] doing streaming I mean I gotta I gotta
[01:34:32] have him part of it in some way so I
[01:34:34] make him do things to help and he says
[01:34:36] do I get paid so I pay him to help and
[01:34:38] stuff like that so or sometimes can I
[01:34:41] get just get these cards instead I'm
[01:34:42] like yeah okay we can get some packs you
[01:34:43] could take a pack of cards or something
[01:34:45] like that
[01:34:47] instead this will get you one and a half
[01:34:50] strength on your adventure through the
[01:34:51] Wasteland if you want to try it that is
[01:34:55] and remember that Wasteland Adventure is
[01:34:58] uh pretty much fully animated there's 90
[01:35:01] it's 90% animated 90% animated I'll say
[01:35:06] because we're missing a couple due to
[01:35:07] the um having to make adjustments we'll
[01:35:11] say and for those that are in here that
[01:35:13] did not see earlier all right I'm going
[01:35:15] to show you we're going to be doing a f
[01:35:17] at night or I think I'm not even going
[01:35:19] to call it f at night I'm gonna have to
[01:35:20] call it F Gamers at night because I
[01:35:23] can't even have Suns
[01:35:25] involved cuz the uh this here is what we
[01:35:29] got in our uh what we got some of these
[01:35:32] in my um my box
[01:35:34] here and this is just a handful of them
[01:35:37] but they are not appropriate to be
[01:35:39] around with
[01:35:40] children
[01:35:44] so like we
[01:35:46] got these cards here um Mike knows what
[01:35:49] these cards are I guess I didn't I he
[01:35:51] knows what they are I haven't played
[01:35:52] those before were hyborian that looks
[01:35:54] like 80s um those look like some 80s
[01:35:57] movies there like ' 80s movies posters
[01:35:59] with scanty clad women all over the
[01:36:00] place which I have no problem with but
[01:36:02] you know I'm guessing somebody will so
[01:36:04] I'm GNA have to make sure I put on that
[01:36:05] you know mature content and then I got
[01:36:08] this other weird one too that looks like
[01:36:09] it's going to be the same with some
[01:36:10] scantily clad women in there that those
[01:36:12] will be some special uh late night ones

[01:36:55] monoc from it I was like you gotta be
[01:36:57] kidding me and I was hoping you maybe

[01:41:28] also pulled
[01:41:33] out what she pulled them out oh wow
[01:41:36] that's
[01:41:37] insane that's why my children have done
[01:41:39] the same so so that my children have
[01:41:41] pulled this out so this one out with
[01:41:43] there's also a foil version of it I was
[01:41:46] lucky enough to pull this one out myself
[01:41:47] so that was my biggest hit I've ever
[01:41:49] pulled out was was the monoc Crypt here
[01:41:51] the the neon one then my son also pulled
[01:41:54] this out 12th doctor

[01:42:00] out the haai Tyrant
[01:42:03] serialized you can see that without the
[01:42:06] light

[01:42:11] he's also pulled orer bow Masters out
[01:42:14] this is my oldest son the lucky head I
[01:42:16] actually pulled that one out that was me

[01:42:20] rag on out I pulled Lord I pulled a
[01:42:23] bunch of the nasgul here sorry those are
[01:42:24] nasgul moral star I I actually got mo mo

[01:42:54] and then he also pulled that one out and
[01:42:56] then my youngest pulled that one out
[01:42:59] like I the only card that I've hit
[01:43:00] that's worth money is this
[01:43:03] one so like you I know exactly what
[01:43:06] you're talking about like I I've had
[01:43:08] I've opened so many things and I can
[01:43:09] pull stuff out for everybody but if I
[01:43:11] try to pull something out for me it does
[01:43:13] not happen I like I never get a good
[01:43:19] card it's just one of those like
[01:43:22] whatever crazy things you
[01:43:24] know we're going put this up for one and
[01:43:26] a half strength if you want to go
[01:43:27] through the Wasteland uh yeah I know

[01:43:32] time I'm like they I get to at least

[01:47:26] through the Wasteland you go wandering
[01:47:29] through this Wasteland as a detective
[01:47:32] and you're wondering what is going on
[01:47:35] and you're looking for things you pick
[01:47:37] things up you drop them you look for
[01:47:38] Treasure as you wander through this
[01:47:40] Wasteland no problem white boy I have no
[01:47:42] problem doing that luckily I'm pretty I
[01:47:44] figured out some of this stuff to move
[01:47:47] quickly now uh you can tell me where to
[01:47:51] go 78 cards are in here in the red 78 in
[01:47:54] the green and then there's 12 in the
[01:47:55] blue so you can tell me wherever you
[01:47:57] want to go you get one pole from each of
[01:47:59] them to add up to whatever you could
[01:48:01] potentially get one two three added
[01:48:04] strength here or you could get three
[01:48:05] negative strength here it's up to
[01:48:08] uh up to the gods of the Wasteland to
[01:48:11] decide for what you're getting or um you
[01:48:14] can tell me random or a certain number
[01:48:15] it's up to you A lot of people do like
[01:48:18] I'll take uh number five or just do all
[01:48:20] random you know that type of
[01:48:25] thing and we have our start is one and a
[01:48:29] half
[01:48:30] strength all right three for the green

[01:48:46] we're going to pull that that's the
[01:48:47] second one that gets flipped over so we
[01:48:49] don't flip that over first we flip over
[01:48:50] the red one first so that's our green
[01:48:52] one three from the front let's wear our
[01:48:54] red
[01:48:56] one our red one don't slurry your words

[01:49:24] them here we're going to see uh I
[01:49:26] shuffle them up and you can tell me
[01:49:27] where you want to go

[01:49:33] center on six all right Shuffle those up
[01:49:36] one two three four five and six all
[01:49:40] right so this is how it goes
[01:49:43] here let's
[01:49:49] see
[01:50:28] my audio switched I'm sorry when did you
[01:50:32] when did you stop hearing me did we get
[01:50:33] the treasure did you hear me on
[01:50:37] that no all right so I'm sorry so you
[01:50:40] got all your cards so what I said was
[01:50:43] all right so what happened was on the
[01:50:44] first one detective detective likes
[01:50:47] treasure Treasure's helpful he picks it
[01:50:49] up he put it out in the pocket pocket
[01:50:50] he's going to use that because he can
[01:50:52] use that any later to trade for
[01:50:53] information all right information or
[01:50:55] maybe maybe he'll be able to buy
[01:50:58] something with it or make it into
[01:50:59] something we don't know he's a detective
[01:51:00] so now you are at one two and a half
[01:51:03] strength as you wander through the
[01:51:05] Wasteland there I'm sorry the audio
[01:51:06] switches randomly sometimes I'll have to
[01:51:08] I've been trying to figure that out I
[01:51:09] got to talk to somebody with tech
[01:51:10] support here and get them on but here we
[01:51:12] go you're wandering through you got some
[01:51:13] treasure you're now at two and a half
[01:51:15] strength you think you got a good thing
[01:51:16] plan here maybe there's someone in the
[01:51:18] distance you go what is that thing in
[01:51:19] the there what is that that is a power
[01:51:23] Stone detective goes up to that power
[01:51:25] Stone and they look at they go what is
[01:51:27] this thing here oh no I'm gonna poke at
[01:51:30] that y got shocked oh no that shocks him
[01:51:35] that is not
[01:51:36] helpful the detective gets a little bit
[01:51:38] of an oh that was the wrong
[01:51:41] one oh that was the right
[01:51:44] one gets an enemy there that hurts him
[01:51:49] go
[01:51:50] and you now are down to one and a half
[01:51:52] strength again I'm sorry my
[01:51:57] friend but let's see what happens maybe
[01:51:59] we can find a companion along the way to
[01:52:01] help
[01:52:03] you oh no our detective runs into a
[01:52:07] Berserker that Berserker comes swinging
[01:52:10] their Axe by
[01:52:14] them Berserkers come swinging their axes
[01:52:17] by them and you come D you have to duck
[01:52:20] dive into a house bump your head and now
[01:52:23] you're kind of dizzy wandering around
[01:52:24] the Wasteland with only half a
[01:52:26] strength but you know what maybe you
[01:52:29] won't get completely beat by the boss
[01:52:31] here you do have 10 bosses to go after
[01:52:35] let's see what happens here with
[01:52:40] these I'm sorry the audio went off on
[01:52:43] that you can tell me where to go with
[01:52:45] this last one here you're going to get
[01:52:47] beat by the boss but maybe it won't be a
[01:52:49] big beat down
[01:52:51] let's see what happens you got 10 cards
[01:52:54] hot hands all right you know what I
[01:52:56] think this one's kind of sticking out a
[01:52:59] little bit so let's go with the one
[01:53:00] sticking out a little bit let's see all
[01:53:02] right we're going to bump into this and
[01:53:03] we're the in the distance you going know
[01:53:05] you know what I think that's things I'm
[01:53:07] all in the distance I think I can handle
[01:53:08] that I'm going to go around and I'm
[01:53:09] gonna go and find out what this oh
[01:53:12] no that was not what you were looking
[01:53:14] for a flare loyalties is what comes out
[01:53:17] of the ground grabs you throws around
[01:53:20] between some Dimensions finally you land
[01:53:22] on the ground with only half your
[01:53:24] strength but you land right next to a
[01:53:26] vault you you crawl into that Vault and
[01:53:30] in that Vault you see something in a
[01:53:32] safe you go you know what somebody saved
[01:53:34] this in a safe what is this stuff in the
[01:53:36] safe there and they saved a couple of
[01:53:38] things because they are a big movie buff

[01:53:59] feel like this seems like something I
[01:54:00] might be in though right now this seems
[01:54:03] like I know what this might be but
[01:54:05] anyways those were whatever somebody

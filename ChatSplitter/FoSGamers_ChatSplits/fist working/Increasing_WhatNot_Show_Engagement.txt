I need you to help me figure out why shows in the afternoon or evening do not have as many people join as in the morning. One of the things is, though, I will say I don't do afternoon or evening shows regularly. This is on WhatNot I'm talking about. On YouTube, they seem to join, because, I mean, they don't pay anything. They just watch me open stuff, and they talk to me, you know what I mean? And there's a good amount of people that come just to hang out on YouTube. But on WhatNot, they're supposed to be coming to buy things, and they're not. And I very rarely get nearly a quarter of the amount of people I would have in the morning. In fact, I'd even do the same thing that I would do in the morning, just, you know, later on in the day or whatever. So, my question is, I can't figure out why. I need you to search, you know, WhatNot, figure out why the people that have a lot of regular, large amount of viewers in there in the afternoon and evening, how and why they do it. Like, what type of things they do to generate that. And then also, on top of that, one of my ideas is, I was wondering if I said in the thumbnail, or in the thumbnail to have it say, like, 50 saves equals, like, a certain thing as a giveaway. You know, that way it makes it so people want to try to save the afternoon show that they see. Maybe that's what they're going to try to do that. And I can put, like, the time that it's on at, even in the thumbnail. That way they know the time and everything is easy to visually see and all that. I was wondering if that was a good idea or not. Like, I could say, you know, 50 saves equals play booster giveaways. And then I'm going to say, like, 100 saves equals collective booster giveaways or something like that. That way, you know, it makes people come in and do things. And that way, if they're buying and they have enough people buying and doing all this stuff, I can easily give away collective boosters without having to worry about it. So, yeah, let me do that. What do you think of that type of thing as an idea? Help generate it. And also, for you, search what everybody else has been doing, too, like I said, and figure out other ideas that will help.

There are a few reasons why your afternoon and evening *Whatnot* shows may not be as successful as your morning streams, especially considering the different behavior of audiences on YouTube and Whatnot.

### 1. **Timing and Audience Behavior**
   Many sellers on *Whatnot* report that the time of day can affect show turnout and sales, largely due to buyer habits. Mornings tend to have more motivated buyers, particularly those who are loyal and are there to grab products early. In contrast, evening or afternoon audiences might be more casual or browsing, and they may not have the same intent to purchase as morning viewers【11†source】. YouTube, being a free-to-watch platform, caters to an audience looking for entertainment rather than immediate buying opportunities, which explains why you see more engagement there without sales expectations.

### 2. **Building Anticipation and Engagement**
   A potential solution to this is using *Whatnot's* **Promote Tools** like *Show Promotion* or *Show Boost* to increase visibility and build momentum around your less popular time slots. These tools can help you gain impressions and get your stream in front of more potential buyers during slower periods【10†source】【12†source】.

### 3. **Incentivizing Saves and Attendance**
   Your idea of offering giveaways tied to "saves" (e.g., "50 saves = Play Booster giveaway") is a great strategy. It encourages early interaction and reminds people to attend the show. Integrating giveaway milestones based on show engagement (like saves, shares, or purchases) has proven to be a good way to drive participation during live sales【13†source】. Just ensure that the value of the incentives aligns with the potential increase in sales so you're not losing too much margin.

### 4. **More Audience Engagement Tools**
   Implementing time-sensitive incentives like flash auctions or discounts in the evening might keep the energy high, even for a more casual audience. Also, offering lower-price items or bundles during evening streams can attract buyers who are less likely to make larger purchases at that time【12†source】.

### Suggestions:
- **Promote the Show**: Use *Whatnot's* Promote Tools to give your afternoon/evening streams more exposure.
- **Interactive Giveaways**: Expand on your "saves = giveaway" idea by adding more milestones and clear, fun incentives.
- **Time-Limited Discounts**: Create urgency by offering special deals only available in afternoon or evening slots to turn casual viewers into buyers.

By implementing a mix of promotions, interactive engagement, and time-sensitive offers, you can better capture the evening crowd on *Whatnot*.

I like the idea of limited time discounts. Let's see about implementing those, and should it be like... Limited time discounts with... Limited time discounts with a... With a discount code that I provide. That, like I say, like during this time, I put in chat, they can use this discount code and... Or I can even put it across the banner. That way, if they're paying attention, they can see it. And then do it that way. Is it possible to do that?



[2024-10-18 20:24:53] ChatGPT:
Yes, it’s absolutely possible to implement limited-time discounts with a discount code that you provide during your *Whatnot* streams. Here's how you can approach it effectively:

### 1. **Discount Code Creation**:
   You can create discount codes specific to your *Whatnot* sales. These codes could offer a percentage discount, free shipping, or a certain dollar amount off purchases during a set time frame. Make sure the discount is enticing but manageable based on your margin. Since *Whatnot* doesn't have a built-in discount code system like some e-commerce platforms, you may need to track it manually through the purchases, but it can still be effective by encouraging urgency.

### 2. **Promotion in Chat and Banner**:
   A great way to ensure viewers see and use the discount code is by mentioning it directly in your chat during the stream, as well as displaying it visually across the banner or screen. This is a proven strategy to increase engagement, as viewers feel like they are getting a special deal by simply watching your show at the right time【13†source】. Displaying the code visibly ensures those who join late or have the volume muted can still see it.

### 3. **Time-Limited Offers**:
   You can make the discount code available only for a limited window (e.g., 15-30 minutes), adding to the urgency. This will push viewers to make decisions quickly, which is key in live shopping settings. Remind viewers periodically how much time they have left to use the code to keep them engaged.

### Implementation Steps:
   - **Create a unique discount code** for each show or segment and set the duration (for example, 15 minutes).
   - **Announce it in the chat** and **display it on-screen** through a banner, so it's highly visible.
   - **Track the sales manually** if needed by checking who used the code during that window.

### Suggestions:
- **Combine With Flash Sales**: Pair the discount code with flash sales on specific items to create even more excitement.
- **Scheduled Discounts**: Let your audience know ahead of time when the discount codes will appear, encouraging them to stay throughout the stream.

By offering limited-time discount codes during your streams, you can drive immediate action from viewers, increasing sales and engagement, especially during your slower afternoon or evening shows.

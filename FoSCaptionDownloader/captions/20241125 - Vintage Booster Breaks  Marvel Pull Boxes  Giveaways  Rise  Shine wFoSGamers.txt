[00:22:48] one of my largest um gains of vocabulary
[00:22:50] is when I read in middle school was like
[00:22:52] 12 12 I think I was when I started
[00:22:55] reading Lord of the Rings I learned I
[00:22:57] had my VAB

[00:23:44] this here this is a fun one I'm going to
[00:23:47] just pin one spot
[00:23:48] actually there's one spot pinned son is
[00:23:51] eight so he's interested in my streaming
[00:23:52] ah yes exactly mine and mine is too I
[00:23:54] think that's what it is they're
[00:23:55] interested in it because of you're
[00:23:57] streaming on something but there you go
[00:23:59] let's um will let's do another one here
[00:24:02] actually no one is doing that now one of
[00:24:04] the things that we wanted to do today
[00:24:07] was I was we opened one of those we had
[00:24:11] some more of our
[00:24:14] um dbn here and I want to open up a
[00:24:18] little bit of that and some other things
[00:24:21] that oh that's the d i I need to get

[00:24:25] to dbor when we were in Vegas and I had
[00:24:27] I haven't open them yet I actually had
[00:24:29] them sitting in here they're being used
[00:24:31] as a spacers right now so I'm going to
[00:24:34] take them out I think that might be what

[00:24:36] we were in Vegas they handed them out to
[00:24:38] some of us when we were at the end of

[01:27:28] as set then three foundations play
[01:27:30] boosters yes that's good um then we're
[01:27:34] going to take it we're going to do the
[01:27:35] same thing as I did
[01:27:38] before all of
[01:27:41] those
[01:27:46] there all right then we'll do this pick
[01:27:50] your
[01:27:52] own custom
[01:27:58] there we go let's try another one we'll
[01:28:00] do another quick one
[01:28:02] maybe there we
[01:28:10] go all
[01:28:13] right six spots on
[01:28:17] that we'll do that again
[01:28:21] oh manage spots all mythics rare there
[01:28:24] we go we'll do that there we
[01:28:30] go create
[01:28:34] that ah I did it as an auction
[01:28:38] again damn it why is it going as an
[01:28:40] auction all the
[01:28:41] time I'm going to finish that
[01:28:48] break yeah everything $3 or more is
[01:28:50] dealt out but randomly like you see me
[01:28:52] in sleeves and stuff and then I hand
[01:28:53] everything else out I do hand everything
[01:28:56] else out so give me a second here I have
[01:28:58] to delete this damn it it did it as a
[01:29:01] auction I hate when they do it as an
[01:29:03] auction by
[01:29:09] now well no that's what I supposed to
[01:29:11] put
[01:29:12] here then I supposed to put
[01:29:16] this over
[01:29:20] here and
[01:29:22] then put those over here yeah that's how
[01:29:26] I do them I try to hand them out so that
[01:29:27] everybody gets a chance of getting
[01:29:29] something or everybody gets something
[01:29:32] it's not because I've been in color
[01:29:34] breaks and other ones where I didn't get
[01:29:37] anything so like I got like one card and
[01:29:40] other people got all kinds of them so I
[01:29:41] feel bad when that happens so I try to
[01:29:43] think of a way to do it where that
[01:29:45] wouldn't occur
[01:29:47] right so that's why we're doing it this
[01:29:49] way
[01:30:00] where I do it that way where we have uh
[01:30:02] just the like I said the better
[01:30:04] opportunities
[01:30:06] there all right let's do that custom
[01:30:09] custom shipping profile is that there
[01:30:12] you
[01:30:13] go
[01:30:18] there I'm going to pin that so you
[01:30:20] should be able to get into those if you
[01:30:21] want them and I'm going to get to that
[01:30:24] Iron Man one because I've been missing
[01:30:26] on those and I don't want to do that be
[01:30:28] too far back so I need to get rapid
[01:30:30] augmenter
[01:30:32] out and we're going to open up some more
[01:30:34] packs
[01:30:35] here hate this building you keep losing
[01:30:37] oh I understand
[01:30:39] that I've been there before rampant
[01:30:41] growth for somebody I saw I'm going have

[02:30:20] is grab my
[02:30:28] drink yeah you have to have like um like
[02:30:30] you can't like I I remember when I was
[02:30:32] going through um New York coming to
[02:30:34] Florida like I had to make sure my gun
[02:30:36] had all of the in on one car and I was
[02:30:38] in one car with the with it it was just
[02:30:41] crazy Nature's claim cuz if I had the
[02:30:45] handgun on me going through the state or
[02:30:46] something like that I could have got in
[02:30:47] trouble which is crazy there your nature
[02:30:50] claim look at
[02:30:52] that St in front of me it's one of those
[02:30:55] like silly things like that type
[02:30:57] thing yes exactly it's like seriously
[02:31:01] like I'm just going from one place to
[02:31:02] another like you you literally cannot
[02:31:04] stop in that state if you have any type
[02:31:07] of weapon on you if you're traveling
[02:31:08] between them it just that's crazy to
[02:31:11] me you know that's like that's why I
[02:31:14] think I get like like seriously can't do
[02:31:16] that
[02:31:22] all
[02:31:26] right
[02:31:35] yeah W all
[02:31:43] right uh yeah that's that's kind of what
[02:31:45] it is you need to have it
[02:31:47] separate yeah had M when I was in New
[02:31:50] Hampshire I got a background check and
[02:31:51] everything and I never had a problem
[02:31:52] with it so it wasn't like there was an
[02:31:55] issues but it was more of
[02:31:57] a we um we didn't get a we didn't really
[02:32:00] do anything to get in trouble like I i'
[02:32:02] never had an issue we just gave me a
[02:32:04] permit they were like here have
[02:32:08] it oh interesting so you have to have a
[02:32:11] reason to get it all right I understand
[02:32:13] that that makes a little bit of sense
[02:32:14] then you have to have a specific reason
[02:32:16] for getting it all right that kind of
[02:32:17] makes sense
[02:32:20] yeah well here it's now open carry down
[02:32:22] here so it doesn't matter where I am in
[02:32:25] Florida yeah it is annoying going
[02:32:27] through definitely annoying but I had my
[02:32:28] permit for New Hampshire so let's see
[02:32:31] let's do this
[02:32:32] here going about

[03:17:07] odd all right so let's get through your
[03:17:11] things back up to find out which
[03:17:12] character has
[03:17:14] rev so I know you got a few of them here
[03:17:16] so I want to make sure I got them
[03:17:19] all all right we
[03:17:24] got that too
[03:17:26] far rev
[03:17:35] has critical hit let me add that to your
[03:17:40] character rip we already added the
[03:17:43] critical
[03:17:44] hit we added the plus one on the
[03:17:46] strength
[03:17:47] no we did not add the plus one on the
[03:17:49] strength we get plus two on the
[03:17:52] strength get plus two on strength now
[03:17:56] then you're at um plus three because you
[03:17:59] actually got another one you only go up
[03:18:02] to plus five by the way get a plus 20 on
[03:18:04] your
[03:18:06] health plus 20 Health if you need
[03:18:12] it
[03:18:15] and you got also got a plus
[03:18:23] 10 plus
[03:18:25] 10 and Engineering oh that's a good one
[03:18:29] helps you when it comes to uh figuring
[03:18:31] things
[03:18:34] out when it comes to some of the game
[03:18:36] here maybe getting through some of the
[03:18:38] doors there you are that's where we're
[03:18:42] at no you don't need to start today well
[03:18:47] you have to have your character to have
[03:18:49] it accumulate things here so what I'll
[03:18:51] let people do if you've been playing and
[03:18:52] buy buying some of these stuff I'll let
[03:18:54] you pick some of things that you've
[03:18:55] gotten over the past not everything I'll
[03:18:58] give you a chance to get some of them
[03:18:59] because you're only allowed to carry
[03:19:00] seven items in your inventory before you
[03:19:02] have to sell them so pretty much I'll
[03:19:03] let you pick seven items if that makes
[03:19:05] any sense like right now our buddy here
[03:19:07] um ra our buddy here um rev has to get
[03:19:11] rid of something because he's at one two
[03:19:13] there's
[03:19:14] five six seven
[03:19:17] and your critical hit counts as a as a
[03:19:20] thing along with your lock room thing so
[03:19:22] you might need you have to go either
[03:19:24] trade something because you have three
[03:19:25] swords and two
[03:19:29] knives but anyways we're going to run
[03:19:32] another one of these giveaways and we'll
[03:19:33] go with this here again un unidentified
[03:19:37] hover
[03:19:41] ship well that's the wrong
[03:19:45] one that might be where I can't find all
[03:19:48] my
[03:19:50] te's well there's my te's that I'm I've
[03:19:52] been

[03:20:33] find him because I put him in the wrong
[03:20:36] location all right we're going to switch
[03:20:38] that back out there's your tiny
[03:20:40] bones there you go buddy and sorry about
[03:20:44] that now I understand why I wasn't able

[03:22:34] use one of your codes with a hole in the
[03:22:35] wall because you only get every time you
[03:22:36] get one of them you only get so you get
[03:22:38] down to two of those for hole in the

[03:25:13] not a good one you got kind of unlucky
[03:25:15] there that was almost
[03:25:17] bad you got kind of unlucky there you
[03:25:20] have a large Raider to fight off fight
[03:25:22] against here that is a you have to get a

[03:26:20] up a little bit I'm going to go up
[03:26:22] to next one here
[03:26:28] is why is that not
[03:26:30] running the next one
[03:26:33] is let's find your next one just one is
[03:26:37] oh you got another intelligence you're a
[03:26:39] smart person just
[03:26:42] one oh and you got you're a smart person
[03:26:45] that's kind of strong got plus one on
[03:26:47] your
[03:26:50] strength oh you got another intelligence
[03:26:52] wow you're an extremely smart person
[03:26:56] today all right and um you got A plus 10
[03:27:01] on your health got A plus 10 Health
[03:27:05] her so that's if you get hurt that's a
[03:27:08] plus 10 health health
[03:27:09] pack right where's my health packs
[03:27:12] that's a plus 10 on your health pack if
[03:27:13] you get injured and you need some you
[03:27:14] need to gain some of your life back
[03:27:18] then oh you got A plus 20
[03:27:22] also all right plus 20
[03:27:27] Alo and then that was it for you but we
[03:27:31] have all right so so the thing is the
[03:27:33] way we kind of do it is I have the
[03:27:34] brakes that are set up a little so this
[03:27:35] one is like the Marvel random one this
[03:27:38] could any of the random Marvel cars in
[03:27:40] here but this will give you a weapon of
[03:27:41] some
[03:27:44] kind yeah yes
[03:27:48] so yes so now you got some things here
[03:27:51] but you don't have any weapons but then
[03:27:53] this is where you would buy yourself a
[03:27:56] weapon and see what you get that's how
[03:28:00] we kind of do our that's why we're kind
[03:28:01] of doing it the way we have been got
[03:28:03] have some fun with it and then you get
[03:28:05] potentially one of the pack one of the
[03:28:06] singles here you know what I mean so you
[03:28:09] got a yenna but you got a sword oh wow
[03:28:12] you got a sword that's a good one to
[03:28:13] start with nice that's a plus five
[03:28:16] five and you already have a plus one on
[03:28:19] your strength so that actually gives you
[03:28:20] plus
[03:28:22] six that's
[03:28:23] nice let me get you yenna out why am I
[03:28:26] going to S I'm looking for sword that's
[03:28:30] why nice one
[03:28:34] there
[03:28:36] yenna and a
[03:28:38] sword so that means you have a sword to
[03:28:42] go up against your uh large Raider with
[03:28:49] just one
[03:28:51] blast so now he rolls 11 to defeat the
[03:28:54] Raider correct 11 or more to defeat the
[03:28:57] Raider so we're going to put our our our
[03:28:58] body back here going to move our stuff
[03:29:01] over here all right put that
[03:29:04] there we slide these forward a little
[03:29:07] bit and I put my uh my patented box that
[03:29:10] I cut out of a box it's not patented
[03:29:12] it's stupid just made it it's easy we're
[03:29:15] going to take a dice
[03:29:17] we're going to roll a dice I'm going to
[03:29:19] use uh we're going to use this one
[03:29:20] because this one was lucky
[03:29:23] yesterday oh you're going to sell a
[03:29:24] sword at hole and two knives I like it
[03:29:27] that's a good idea sell a sword and two
[03:29:29] knives that'll get you some good stuff
[03:29:30] all right
[03:29:32] ready so you get a 12 so that means
[03:29:36] you're up against that large Raider and
[03:29:38] you can beat them because you have
[03:29:42] 12 there you go now you can hit him with
[03:29:44] your sword now let's see what happens
[03:29:46] when you hit him that large Raider is
[03:29:48] actually 40 health so it's going to be a
[03:29:50] pain in the butt but that's okay we can
[03:29:53] figure that out we'll figure that out
[03:29:56] later we'll figure that one out later
[03:29:58] let me just get these in here so I don't
[03:30:00] lose any of these
[03:30:02] cards all right and then you get here
[03:30:06] there you go you hit him you hit that
[03:30:09] large
[03:30:09] Raider with your sword goes from
[03:30:13] 40 down to oh that's not bad
[03:30:17] he goes from 40 down to um
[03:30:19] 31 not a giant hit not a great hit but
[03:30:22] not a bad hit all right you get three
[03:30:24] more chances to go with that and then
[03:30:27] we're going to sell your sword I see at
[03:30:30] your you're at the hole in the wall and
[03:30:32] you're selling a sword and the two
[03:30:34] knives now the
[03:30:36] sword you hear some Ruckus outside
[03:30:39] you're like what's going on out there
[03:30:40] you try there whatever I'm going to get
[03:30:42] rid of my sword you go you sell your
[03:30:44] sword
[03:30:46] goes all right well sir I'll give you
[03:30:49] uh I'll give you five pogs for the sword
[03:30:52] and two pogs per knife how's that
[03:30:56] sound make you know what you want
[03:31:03] to it's not that it's a little bit hard
[03:31:05] not that really hard now Matt you needed
[03:31:08] I mean not Matt I mean uh just one you
[03:31:10] need to decide if you want to attack
[03:31:11] again or you want to try to run away
[03:31:12] because if you don't win against the
[03:31:14] Raider you can die and you can have your
[03:31:17] stuff
[03:31:19] stolen all right oh I I have a really
[03:31:23] messed up brain so I'm a little bit
[03:31:24] creative but I'm I'm kind of I'm kind of
[03:31:27] broken you going to take the deal
[03:31:30] rev all right you're taking it he said
[03:31:32] sure oh no that was a two you missed
[03:31:35] this time you whiffed and that large

[03:31:44] for 15 bring you down to 85
[03:31:47] he didn't like you hit him with your
[03:31:48] sword before that wasn't
[03:31:51] good all right now you sell those he
[03:31:54] comes over and goes all right well now
[03:31:56] he takes that deal and gives you
[03:32:00] five six s five seven five seven eight
[03:32:07] nine there you go there's your pogs that
[03:32:09] he gives you our buddy rev tank oh you

[03:32:29] stuff you're G to turn around oh you're
[03:32:30] going to go and fight oh you think
[03:32:31] you're can to turn around and fight now
[03:32:32] all right you hear something going on
[03:32:34] outside and he sees just one blast going
[03:32:37] to take their last swing are you going
[03:32:39] to is that what you're doing or
[03:32:41] attacking for the last
[03:32:44] one I mean it seems like might be there
[03:32:46] to help
[03:32:49] now oh yeah here we go oh oh 12 12 again
[03:32:54] you got him you hit him let's see what
[03:32:56] it does here
[03:32:59] oh that was not bad brings him down to
[03:33:02] 18 that was a good hit that was a good
[03:33:04] hit there nice but he goes to swing at
[03:33:07] you with his axe because he's quite mad
[03:33:10] at you and he's not dead yet rev are you
[03:33:12] going to do anything about that you're
[03:33:14] going to let that happen
[03:33:17] because rev happens to be there right
[03:33:18] now and you're going to have to turn and
[03:33:20] run luckily you were both going to burn
[03:33:22] away that is a big boy rev goes you know
[03:33:25] what I have to I got your buddy now rev
[03:33:29] has a um sword I'm guessing you're going
[03:33:33] to be using your
[03:33:35] sword to attack
[03:33:40] with all right you have to get a uh plus
[03:33:44] you have to get a 12 or larger
[03:33:46] no yes while we're
[03:33:48] bigger oh no you got a
[03:33:51] two you get a two you're going to use
[03:33:54] your critical oh you want to use the
[03:33:55] critical all right nice so the critical
[03:33:58] means you're going to hit guaranteed you
[03:34:00] hit all right so let's see how the
[03:34:02] guarantee of it is nice he uses the
[03:34:04] critical guarantees a hit with a
[03:34:06] critical all right and then you get Plus
[03:34:08] on there oh nice you hit him for a
[03:34:09] little one and the plus two H it's not a
[03:34:11] big one for the plus two extra so it
[03:34:13] brings him down to actually um Seven
[03:34:16] health he was already at 18 so not too
[03:34:18] bad on that one cuz you remember you got
[03:34:20] the I forgot you had the critical so you
[03:34:21] use that critical and you you come out
[03:34:24] you should put your sword right out in
[03:34:25] front of him as he swings his axe down
[03:34:28] little little Perry action cut down on
[03:34:31] him slicing a one a gash in his
[03:34:34] stomach now rev use your critical he's
[03:34:39] actually holding his stomach he dropped
[03:34:41] his axe now he's holding his stomach he
[03:34:42] doesn't know what to do he sees two of

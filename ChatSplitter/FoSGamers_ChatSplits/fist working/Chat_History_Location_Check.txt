Where are my chats with you I've done on my computer with a year plus plan i purchased?

I don’t have access to specific user data or memory of past conversations. Your chats might be stored locally on your computer or in a cloud service if you’re using an app that syncs data across devices. Check your app settings or cloud storage for your chat history.

I paid for a 1 year plus plan on the computer why does it not show here?

[2024-05-14 08:23:23] ChatGPT:
It seems like you might be referring to a subscription or plan you purchased on your computer but are not seeing the benefits or access reflected in the Android app. In this case, it's best to reach out to the customer support or help desk of the service you purchased the plan for. They should be able to assist you in syncing your subscription across devices or addressing any issues with your access.

Sure, I can help with that! What specific features or functionalities would you like the Python chatbot application to have? Are there any particular platforms or frameworks you prefer to use?

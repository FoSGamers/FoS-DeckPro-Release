Here is the "Latest Adventure Story" section:

### Latest Adventure Story
Once upon a time in the Fallout Wasteland, a group of brave adventurers set out on a perilous journey to defend their city from marauding raiders. Led by the valiant Defender with 100 HP and a +10 defense bonus, they faced countless challenges and battles.

Their first trial came as raiders attacked the North Wall. With a swift roll to defend, the Defender successfully repelled the invaders, gaining 10 HP and boosting the city's morale. But the raiders' onslaught didn't end there. They struck again at the South Gate, and this time, despite the Medic's healing efforts, the gate fell, and the city suffered a loss of 10 HP.

Undeterred, the adventurers fought through wave after wave of raiders, each time facing tough choices and rolling the dice for their fate. The Scout's keen eyes uncovered valuable clues, the Engineer's traps thwarted enemy advances, and the Hunter's prowess turned the tide in critical battles.

As they explored the wasteland, the group stumbled upon hidden treasures and dangerous challenges. In the Abandoned Factory, they found a wounded traveler who shared a map to a hidden cache of supplies. Meanwhile, on the Ruined Highway, an ambush by wild dogs tested their combat skills.

Finally, the adventurers reached the Raider Hideout for the ultimate showdown with the Raider Leader. With a decisive roll of the dice, the Hunter emerged victorious, defeating the leader and securing the city's safety.

And so, their epic journey in the Fallout Wasteland came to a triumphant end, with the defenders celebrated as heroes and their names etched in wasteland lore.

This is not a game made in code it is a text game that  a chatbot would use in a live chat room for those in the chat to play the game. In that context correct the game to have one hunter_roll prompt and response in the entire game (i.e. combine the two below or make one for both and the entire game).  

/hunter_roll	Rolling dice... - Hunter Success: You fend them off and find some food supplies. Gain 5 HP. - Hunter Failure: The dogs overpowered you. You are injured. Lose 10 HP.

/hunter_roll	Rolling dice... - Hunter Success: Raider Leader defeated! You win the game. Gain 20 HP. - Hunter Failure: You are wounded and must return to the city. Type '/start' to play again.

Certainly! Here is the corrected version of the game where there is only one `/hunter_roll` prompt and response used throughout the entire game. This response will cover all scenarios where a hunter roll is needed.

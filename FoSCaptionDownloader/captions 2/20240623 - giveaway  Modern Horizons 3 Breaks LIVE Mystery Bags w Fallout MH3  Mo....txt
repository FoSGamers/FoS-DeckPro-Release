[00:20:21] we're going to pay for stuff like that
[00:20:22] we gonna We have to uh sell the house

[00:21:00] yeah thanks
[00:21:02] yeah here we go yeah we want make a
[00:21:04] decision that we not doing some other
[00:21:06] crap that we W have to deal with anymore
[00:21:08] so might as well do the fun things
[00:21:17] right send is in 82 all you written
[00:21:22] down a that was silly of
[00:21:25] me that's all right it's not like the in
[00:21:27] is going to cost me
[00:21:33] anything not like the ink cost me well
[00:21:35] it does eventually I mean I've got use
[00:21:36] too much of
[00:21:37] the cisin
[00:21:43] 82 well so what I'm going to plan on
[00:21:46] doing is uh if I can I'm hoping I can
[00:21:48] that's why I keep trying to get bigger
[00:21:49] and bigger with the amount of people we
[00:21:50] have so my goal here is for the most
[00:21:52] part I'll be doing giveaways most of the
[00:21:55] stream of packs at least packs then what
[00:21:59] you guys can do is you'll buy them from
[00:22:00] here from the store I'll have them Shi
[00:22:01] from my location because I can't rip
[00:22:03] everything depending on how many are
[00:22:04] here but I will have things that'll be
[00:22:06] running the um the auctions on that way
[00:22:09] I have enough that I can rip so I'll be
[00:22:10] going through like boxes and you guys
[00:22:12] can buy them we'll rip them for them or
[00:22:13] I'll have like a handful of boxes like I
[00:22:14] do now not a ton of them and um like one
[00:22:18] box of a bunch of things and maybe some
[00:22:20] of the new stuff because when I'll be on
[00:22:22] the boat I'm not going to be like
[00:22:23] outside the country right away I have to
[00:22:24] be a nearby just going to you know get
[00:22:26] my family used to it and everything then
[00:22:28] so will travel out and as we travel out
[00:22:30] we'll be able to do stuff where we maybe
[00:22:31] ship it once a month from the location
[00:22:33] that we're at to all you guys and that's
[00:22:36] what I was thinking we will do because
[00:22:37] uh you know people do the once a month
[00:22:39] shipping all the time and no one
[00:22:40] generally has a problem with it so I
[00:22:42] figured you guys wouldn't either if we
[00:22:43] were doing that type of thing going from
[00:22:45] like uh to doing it that way that's all
[00:22:47] and then say if we're doing shows here I
[00:22:49] got a couple other friends I was
[00:22:50] debating on talking to where um they can
[00:22:53] we can I can hang out with them during

[00:44:14] have a question for you guys I was going
[00:44:16] to do tomorrow next week I was thinking
[00:44:19] doing Like a Wheel of Fortune game for
[00:44:21] the show what would you think it would
[00:44:23] be like wheel of magic I did a a quick
[00:44:26] version of it along time ago if you like
[00:44:28] it let me know what you think if you
[00:44:31] like that idea and we can do that try it
[00:44:34] on Monday because I had it partially
[00:44:36] built last night and I was like you know
[00:44:37] what I didn't get to finish it I was
[00:44:39] just tired so I didn't get to get
[00:44:41] through it and finish
[00:44:43] it I swear I have a pearl Medallion in
[00:44:45] there but I have something sold so I
[00:44:47] have to go over to that my friend all
[00:44:49] right
[00:44:58] been on this after month it's
[00:44:59] interesting seeing folks who like you
[00:45:01] who are Naturals versus others who
[00:45:04] are thank you Gordon I appreciate that I
[00:45:06] I don't know I've always put it this
[00:45:10] way well thank you I appreciate that so
[00:45:14] I um been around children my entire life
[00:45:17] so I always had to be inventive to get
[00:45:19] them to do things and I wouldn't like
[00:45:22] make games and stuff like that and it's
[00:45:23] actually kind of fun when you do that
[00:45:25] over time
[00:45:27] so with that being said I can um now I
[00:45:30] use kind of like the kids with us too
[00:45:31] like let's have fun let's figure some
[00:45:32] out like I have a soccer game that um
[00:45:35] they both came up with that I have to
[00:45:36] figure out how to put together to play
[00:45:38] with you guys it's something like you
[00:45:40] would be you would be
[00:45:42] um football for you foreigners it would
[00:45:45] be Emerald if you got yourself that
[00:45:47] there it would be something where you um
[00:45:49] you would play like against another
[00:45:52] person and you would both be players
[00:45:55] against them you would pull from boxes
[00:45:57] to uh see what happens in the pole boxes
[00:45:59] as you go against each other or you
[00:46:01] could play against um I think the way
[00:46:02] that Nolan had it was well will had it
[00:46:04] was you play against the um each I was
[00:46:07] thinking the way will had it was you
[00:46:08] play against U the me the bad guys which
[00:46:11] are the cards you pull out and if you
[00:46:12] can beat him with the cards you pull out
[00:46:14] you can kind of progress on through the
[00:46:16] game somehow but we're trying to figure
[00:46:17] out how to do
[00:46:22] that go in His Ho so he knows what he's
[00:46:24] talking about well I appreciate
[00:46:26] appreciate
[00:46:30] that I like how you said that he's old
[00:46:32] he knows what he's talking about he's
[00:46:34] got those centuries under his

[00:47:48] 13 now people don't realize that 13 is
[00:47:50] actually a lucky number throughout
[00:47:52] history but at some point I believe it
[00:47:54] was the Romans maybe I think it was the
[00:47:56] Roman that changed that after they
[00:47:58] became Catholic because before they
[00:48:01] became Catholic it didn't matter all

[01:02:46] right there that's funny so I will say
[01:02:49] this one of the things I've always
[01:02:51] wanted to do is uh go to some of the
[01:02:53] Asian countries I like I said I had one
[01:02:55] of my best friends was Japanese so I had
[01:02:57] an opportunity to go there when I was
[01:02:58] younger but was held back by a family
[01:03:00] member my mom that was overly protective
[01:03:02] she was the helicopter parent before
[01:03:04] they knew what a helicopter parent was
[01:03:06] that makes any
[01:03:09] sense so one of the things we'll do when
[01:03:11] we're on our boat is we're going to try
[01:03:12] to go around and see where we can stay
[01:03:13] in some of those places for a little
[01:03:17] while so do there and some of the other
[01:03:19] Asian countries when we're on our boat
[01:03:21] be a few years before we get over there
[01:03:22] obviously because we're going to be in
[01:03:23] the Caribbean for a little bit
[01:03:26] but what I'll do here is Let's see we
[01:03:29] got some mod Horizon 3 available let's
[01:03:31] open this baby up in our 17 seconds
[01:03:34] after this giveaway is done here we'll
[01:03:35] see how that's going too all
[01:03:41] right and let's keep going there
[01:03:44] alrighty there's our giveaway going
[01:03:49] to good gu has
[01:03:51] boat I know it is not a bad one couple
[01:03:54] that we're looking at em getting the

[04:21:00] second we had that giveaway going it's
[04:21:02] these two right here let's see what they
[04:21:04] are those are two instead of one from
[04:21:06] our uh from our
[04:21:10] giveaway box right here here all right
[04:21:16] now let's see what we want to do
[04:21:18] here those are some really good hits out
[04:21:21] of that I think I'm going to finish
[04:21:22] Opening Our box here and see what's
[04:21:23] going
[04:21:25] on we're just opening some packs here
[04:21:28] patri show now remember if you guys want
[04:21:31] to jump in yourself it's all kinds of
[04:21:33] stuff that we have available in the buy
[04:21:35] now and if you want to do like say you
[04:21:37] want to do multiples of things generally
[04:21:39] will do deal to more because it helps me
[04:21:42] with what OD fees I actually will give
[04:21:44] you a discount because of that so yeah
[04:21:47] if you want to do like three or more
[04:21:48] packs generally I I'll do a discount if
[04:21:50] you do two of the high-end packs
[04:21:52] sometimes I can do a discount depending
[04:21:53] on what ones they are but um it's just
[04:21:56] because what happens is I get more fees
[04:21:59] per each thing so if there's if you
[04:22:01] combine them into one sale helps me on
[04:22:03] the fees so I pass that savings on to
[04:22:04] you guys pretty much what it
[04:22:08] is let's see what we get here one two
[04:22:11] three four five six seven
[04:22:16] eight yeah I know every single um every
[04:22:19] single thing we get every single order
[04:22:22] we do there's a fee from taken from us
[04:22:25] so what we end up so what the reason why
[04:22:27] I try to do it do up that way so that if
[04:22:29] you want you know like I said I can I
[04:22:31] can make it so it's not as many fees so
[04:22:34] what I do is I'll just pass that savings
[04:22:35] on to you guys because of how the fees
[04:22:37] are I don't take it on myself I since
[04:22:39] I'm saving it since we're doing multiple
[04:22:41] at once we don't have to pay the
[04:22:43] I just give that savings to
[04:22:44] you I don't need that I already you know
[04:22:47] I already planned in what I wanted one
[04:22:49] two three four five six seven and eight
[04:22:54] yeah exactly
[04:22:57] project so that's kind of like how you

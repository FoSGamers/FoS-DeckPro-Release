To fix a chunk of gelcoat missing on a boat, you’ll need to go through these steps. It’s a relatively straightforward repair if the damage isn’t structural:

### **What You'll Need:**
- Gelcoat repair kit (comes with gelcoat paste, hardener, color tint, etc.)
- Acetone (for cleaning)
- Sandpaper (80, 220, 400, 600 grit)
- Masking tape
- Mixing cup and stick
- Putty knife or plastic spreader
- Polishing compound and buffer (optional)

### **Steps:**

1. **Clean the Area:**
   - Use soap and water first, then acetone to remove any oils, wax, or grime from the damaged area.

2. **Sand the Edges:**
   - Use 80-grit sandpaper to smooth the edges of the missing gelcoat and roughen the surrounding surface so the new gelcoat will bond well.

3. **Mask Off the Area:**
   - Use masking tape to protect the surrounding areas from spills and over-application.

4. **Mix Gelcoat Paste:**
   - Follow instructions on your gelcoat repair kit. If matching color, mix tints until you get the desired shade.

5. **Apply the Gelcoat:**
   - Spread it evenly over the damaged area using a plastic spreader. Slightly overfill it since it’ll shrink a bit when curing.

6. **Let It Cure:**
   - Some kits need to be covered with plastic wrap or wax paper to fully cure in air. Let it set per the product’s directions (usually several hours).

7. **Sand Smooth:**
   - Start with 220 grit, then work your way to 600 grit (or higher) for a smooth finish.

8. **Polish:**
   - Use a buffing compound and polish the area to blend the shine with the surrounding gelcoat.

If the damage penetrates through to the fiberglass or has exposed structure, you may need to patch the fiberglass beneath before applying gelcoat.

\title{\textbf{Harmonic Convergence Engine: A Unified Tensor Field Framework for Entropic Stabilization and Biological Coherence}}

\begin{abstract}
This paper introduces a unified entropic field framework and engineering application—the \textbf{Harmonic Convergence Engine (HCE)}—which utilizes tensor field harmonics and informational phase locking to achieve local entropy suppression. The HCE is designed for long-term biological stabilization, neural memory preservation, quantum field coherence, and systemic environmental synchronization. This research builds on and surpasses classical physical models including thermodynamics, general relativity, and information theory. AI was used to model phase space behaviors and tensor evolution patterns, but all insights are credited to human-derived objectives and system intent, spearheaded by James Gleason.

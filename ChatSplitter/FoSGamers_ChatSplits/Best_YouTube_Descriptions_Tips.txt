I conducted an extensive search and gathered insights from multiple sources about the best practices for writing YouTube video descriptions, specifically focusing on live videos and shorts. Here's what I found:

### 1. **Craft Compelling Introductions**
   - The first 100-150 characters of your description are crucial because they appear in search results and above the "SHOW MORE" button on the video page. Use this space to grab attention by clearly stating what the video is about or posing an intriguing question. This approach helps improve click-through rates (CTR)【7†source】【10†source】.

### 2. **Use Relevant Keywords and Hashtags**
   - Include primary keywords early in the description to optimize for search engine visibility. For shorts, use specific hashtags (e.g., #shorts) to connect your video with related content, making it easier for viewers to discover【9†source】【11†source】.

### 3. **Incorporate Timestamps**
   - For longer videos, especially live streams, adding timestamps can enhance the user experience by allowing viewers to jump to specific sections of interest. This practice also helps improve viewer retention, as they can quickly find the content they’re interested in【9†source】【10†source】.

### 4. **Include a Call to Action (CTA)**
   - Encourage viewer engagement by adding CTAs in the description. Whether it’s asking viewers to like, comment, subscribe, or visit your website, placing CTAs near the top of the description ensures they are visible and effective【8†source】【9†source】.

### 5. **Add Social Media and Related Links**
   - Cross-promote your other social media platforms by including links in your description. Additionally, you can link to related videos or playlists to keep viewers engaged with your content longer. For monetized channels, this is also a good place to include affiliate links or sponsor information【9†source】【10†source】.

### 6. **Maintain a Human Tone**
   - Write descriptions that resonate with your audience by using a conversational tone. Avoid stuffing your description with keywords solely for SEO purposes, as this can harm your video’s performance. YouTube values descriptions that are written for humans rather than algorithms【10†source】【11†source】.

### 7. **Use Description Templates**
   - For consistency and efficiency, consider using templates for your video descriptions. Templates can help ensure that key elements like CTAs, keywords, and links are consistently included across all your videos【8†source】【9†source】.

### 8. **Check for Mobile Compatibility**
   - Since a significant portion of YouTube traffic comes from mobile devices, it’s essential to preview your descriptions on mobile to ensure they are user-friendly and properly formatted【11†source】.

### 9. **Analyze and Adapt**
   - Regularly review your YouTube analytics to see how different descriptions perform. This data can help you refine your approach over time, optimizing for better engagement and discoverability【11†source】.

### Summary
For effective YouTube descriptions, focus on clear, keyword-optimized introductions, use timestamps for navigation, include CTAs and relevant links, write in a natural tone, and always preview your descriptions on mobile devices. Utilizing templates and regularly analyzing performance can also help streamline the process and improve your results.

[00:18:48] point but I can't remember if it was I
[00:18:51] don't know they always fluctuate so much
[00:18:54] yeah it was definitely a good pack
[00:18:56] things fluctuate so quickly and so much

[00:19:30] um an Android and as long as she uh sees
[00:19:35] everything it seems like everybody else
[00:19:36] can because it seems like iPhones get a
[00:19:37] better view than what Androids get for
[00:19:39] some reason stupid well it's all their
[00:19:42] development on iPhone versus Android all
[00:19:44] the time to iOS which is frustrating and

[00:49:14] works all
[00:49:22] right all right we got some different
[00:49:25] ones Maybe it's the packs so we'll throw
[00:49:28] out some other stuff right now for you

[00:50:10] out I don't know what yall looking for
[00:50:12] today but we're trying our games we now
[00:50:14] remember everybody we do have now with
[00:50:17] the adventure game the cool thing about
[00:50:19] the adventure game is there is's an
[00:50:21] animated one so you pick a character now
[00:50:24] we show those there one of those four
[00:50:26] then you go through as your character
[00:50:29] through the Wasteland all right and
[00:50:32] there's different steps along the
[00:50:34] way that's why we have these boxes here
[00:50:39] this is our you either get a the red
[00:50:41] green and blue you either get a plus one
[00:50:43] or a minus one for each one then you go
[00:50:45] up for a little fight against a boss
[00:50:47] here which is one of our 10 bosses and
[00:50:50] if you happen to win maybe you go up and
[00:50:53] you go against that Velociraptor and you
[00:50:56] have four four or five strength and
[00:50:57] you're able to beat it that's up to you
[00:50:59] guys though if you want to jump in on
[00:51:01] any of our packs or anything like that
[00:51:03] it's because it is hard for me uh for me
[00:51:05] to know when you don't uh you don't give
[00:51:07] us any input here so I will throw these
[00:51:10] ones back see if anybody wants something
[00:51:12] different or if you want to play uh I
[00:51:14] don't know if you want to play any games
[00:51:15] you want to do any anything else you
[00:51:17] want to do any
[00:51:20] um boxes any uh singles I put singles up
[00:51:25] before I've just really been going
[00:51:27] through so much maybe that's what it is
[00:51:29] is uh no one knows what they want
[00:51:33] here all right that's what it
[00:51:36] is no one knows what they wants right
[00:51:39] now let's put these out
[00:51:44] then do a showdown between packs or
[00:51:47] singles again let's do that let's put
[00:51:51] these out we'll do
[00:51:54] this this
[00:52:07] this
[00:52:13] three all right here we go this is what
[00:52:14] we're going to
[00:52:16] do we're going to do this here's our our
[00:52:21] Showdown this this is what my youngest
[00:52:23] came up with call it the single Showdown
[00:52:31] this
[00:52:36] is all right here we go here's our
[00:52:39] single
[00:52:40] Showdown or at least my youngest came my
[00:52:42] olders thought this is a cool idea we
[00:52:44] put out a pack
[00:52:47] here where or singles so you're going to
[00:52:51] get either all of these singles here you
[00:52:54] have a verid descent bog

[00:53:19] or a thunder
[00:53:22] Junction this was The Showdown my son
[00:53:25] thought was kind of fun here

[00:53:30] do you
[00:53:31] want the
[00:53:33] singles
[00:53:38] or the

[00:53:45] the day here I was going to try to tally
[00:53:46] it up and that way we do giveaways based
[00:53:48] on what was the bigger one now is it a
[00:53:51] single or is it a pack do we want packs
[00:53:53] because there's more packs that are
[00:53:54] being bought or is there more singles
[00:53:56] that are getting bought want or that's

[01:19:15] boxes like some of them feel like the
[01:19:17] blisters have better poles than boxes if
[01:19:20] you buy like 12 blisters hey heavy how
[01:19:22] you doing how's your day been
[01:19:25] like if you buy 12 blisters versus 12
[01:19:28] boxes people seem to think that you get
[01:19:31] a better deal or you get better hits
[01:19:33] with the blisters and I um or recently I
[01:19:36] had somebody tell me that now I don't
[01:19:37] know how accurate it is but it's one of
[01:19:40] those things that it's like intriguing
[01:19:42] intriguing to think about right so here
[01:19:45] we'll throw this one up here for a
[01:19:46] little Adventure game we'll uh that'll
[01:19:48] be we there'll be five strength again

[01:20:01] morning so yeah
[01:20:04] good yes and it's exactly it's an
[01:20:07] anecdote but I've had that experience
[01:20:10] before too where it wasn't with um Lord
[01:20:14] of the Rings it was with lurana which I
[01:20:16] actually have a ton of lurana myself but
[01:20:19] uh it wasn't with Lord of the Rings it
[01:20:21] was with
[01:20:21] lurana and with that lurana um I got uh
[01:20:26] I got a an enchanted out of the blisters

[01:20:55] right you just want to crack
[01:20:58] them we can rip them without doing the
[01:21:00] game that's not a problem at all too or
[01:21:03] is that what I I mistake on what you're
[01:21:06] saying might have misunderstood what

[01:21:27] it is you're going to be a detective all
[01:21:29] right you are a detective my friend as a
[01:21:34] detective you go wandering through this
[01:21:36] Wasteland

[01:21:45] one blue 78 in the red 78 in the green
[01:21:49] and 12 in the blue and then at the end
[01:21:51] you pick one out of 10 for the bosses
[01:21:54] all right
[01:21:55] so as a detective you wander through
[01:21:58] this Wasteland here where would you like
[01:22:00] to look for in this red box to uh see
[01:22:02] what you get because you look for
[01:22:04] Treasure to help you treasure helps you
[01:22:07] in the Wasteland because as a detective
[01:22:10] treasure will you allow you to trade for
[01:22:12] information and we always like
[01:22:14] information as a
[01:22:16] detective now I can do random or I can
[01:22:20] uh do certain numbers for you sometimes
[01:22:21] people will be like uh 12 15 and four
[01:22:27] the front ones all right go right at the
[01:22:29] front
[01:22:31] here the detective knocks on that door
[01:22:34] goes hey
[01:22:35] buddy I see I see you in there in that
[01:22:38] house I think there's something that can
[01:22:40] help me and they see some food
[01:22:43] cooking they go in they go oh wonderful
[01:22:46] food they pick that up they start
[01:22:48] munching on it and they go oh no that
[01:22:51] food has
[01:22:53] RADS that doesn't help me oh now down to
[01:22:57] only four strength food does not help
[01:23:00] the detective you are looking for H they
[01:23:02] they that detective was not too smart
[01:23:04] with that eating that food before
[01:23:06] checking it for RADS now where do you
[01:23:09] want to go my friend as you wander
[01:23:11] through this Wasteland
[01:23:13] here you have one more choice on this to
[01:23:16] go through the green to see if you find
[01:23:17] a friend maybe a friend will help you
[01:23:19] get rid of that RADS there's a friend
[01:23:21] that will give you some information
[01:23:22] maybe you'll find a map or an item
[01:23:25] I don't know let's find out as a
[01:23:27] detective you have 1 through 78 we're
[01:23:29] knocking off the front going right
[01:23:31] through the front door on all of
[01:23:35] them do it again he does on again n
[01:23:38] detective knocks down that front door
[01:23:41] comes right on in he goes hey buddy I'm
[01:23:43] gonna take something from you and that
[01:23:47] detective sees a power stone that
[01:23:49] detective walks up to that power Stone
[01:23:51] and goes huh well that's interesting
[01:23:53] what does that thing right there he
[01:23:55] pokes at that power Stone and H that was
[01:24:00] silly the detective got
[01:24:03] shocked and they are now down to three
[01:24:07] strength because they now have some
[01:24:09] electrocution they were shocked and
[01:24:11] they've been now electrocuted as they
[01:24:13] wander through this Wasteland that
[01:24:14] detective is not as smart as a detective
[01:24:17] as he seems to think he is here but
[01:24:19] there are 12 potential friends that you
[01:24:22] can find here we're going to go uh you
[01:24:24] have a you're looking for that detective
[01:24:26] friend along the
[01:24:28] way now as you go through that
[01:24:31] Wasteland there's one of 12 which one is
[01:24:33] it you want to go with my friend to see
[01:24:35] if you get a detective to come along and
[01:24:38] help
[01:24:40] you one through
[01:24:42] 12 is he going in the front door
[01:24:46] again is the detective taking down the
[01:24:48] front door
[01:24:51] again I throw out one of the family
[01:24:54] things here our little family sign packs
[01:24:56] for our giveaways we'll throw one of
[01:24:58] those up
[01:25:03] here you taking out that door again or
[01:25:05] you gonna go with a different
[01:25:10] one oh you sus you're suspect we always
[01:25:14] Shuffle the 12 of them in there I always
[01:25:16] Shuffle those ones up gonna need a sec
[01:25:19] all right all right and I'm going to
[01:25:20] shuffle up the bosses here too just so
[01:25:23] you can uh you can decide on what you
[01:25:24] want to do on
[01:25:27] that we always Shuffle the bosses in the
[01:25:30] 12 um your 12 potential companions just
[01:25:34] because uh there's only a few of them
[01:25:35] there so let's see which ones you're G
[01:25:37] to go with
[01:25:39] there have to figure that one out oh no
[01:25:42] the detective is wandering through the
[01:25:44] Wasteland pondering his
[01:25:47] decision I see something in the distance
[01:25:49] is that a friend I don't know an
[01:25:52] enemy it's not in a sh sure yet trying
[01:25:55] to figure it
[01:25:56] out could be something he knows I don't
[01:26:00] know let's find out I'm G to take a
[01:26:03] drink
[01:26:08] here I have a question everybody
[01:26:12] so what is the outcome what are the
[01:26:15] negatives what are the positives
[01:26:16] guessing I should have asked it
[01:26:18] initially
[01:26:20] so if you get beat by the boss they're
[01:26:23] um with four strength right now that you
[01:26:25] have I the three strength you have right
[01:26:27] now you could beat potentially three two
[01:26:30] out of the 10 bosses if you get one more
[01:26:33] to get four strength you could beat
[01:26:36] three out of the 10 bosses now if you
[01:26:39] beat one of the bosses what we do is we
[01:26:42] do a $1 Loot drop for everybody in the
[01:26:44] Wasteland so what I do is I take a pack
[01:26:45] of cards and I put it out here for $1 as
[01:26:48] an auction on here I used to do it as a
[01:26:51] giveaway that I gave it to you as a win
[01:26:53] but somebody complained
[01:26:54] and said that was considered gambling so
[01:26:56] I am no longer able to do that and the
[01:26:59] only thing that I am able to do is a $1
[01:27:01] Loot drop for everybody in the Wasteland
[01:27:02] due to rules and complainers but you
[01:27:06] always get one of these
[01:27:08] golden benjes that you find up there in
[01:27:12] the um in in the Wasteland when you go
[01:27:14] into a vault you always get one of the
[01:27:17] benjes just saying thank you for playing
[01:27:19] it's just a pack of cards that's under a
[01:27:21] dollar anything from the 880s late' 80s
[01:27:24] to the early
[01:27:27] 2000s yes can't be a lottery or
[01:27:29] something exactly and your initial
[01:27:32] purchase you always get your initial
[01:27:33] purchase yes yes these are your packs
[01:27:37] guaranteed no that's these are your
[01:27:39] packs guaranteed no you never have to
[01:27:41] worry about these disappearing ever you
[01:27:43] bought these this is just extra having
[01:27:46] fun yes it's an extra thing to have fun
[01:27:49] no you always get the packs and that's
[01:27:52] where I was I was worried I'm like I got
[01:27:54] frustrated where I was like I was giving
[01:27:55] something away free extra you didn't pay
[01:27:58] anything extra for it and I still got in
[01:28:00] trouble I'm like seriously all right
[01:28:02] whatever so I had to change it and make
[01:28:05] it so everybody everybody gets a the
[01:28:07] chance of getting the pack that's what
[01:28:09] it is and you always get one of the
[01:28:11] Vault packs that is correct one of the
[01:28:13] Vault packs what that is is just uh
[01:28:15] somebody felt like they needed to save
[01:28:17] something in the vault and they put the
[01:28:18] a Benji in the vault for you to find and
[01:28:22] these benjes are anything they could be
[01:28:24] anything from a movie to a video game to
[01:28:28] potentially baseball cards they're all
[01:28:29] just a pack of cards that are like under
[01:28:31] a dollar that are from like the late 80s
[01:28:34] to the uh early
[01:28:38] 2000s phoning a friend oh cardboard
[01:28:42] which cardboard phoning a friend we're
[01:28:44] looking for uh we need one more strength
[01:28:46] so we can get the potential of beating
[01:28:47] three bosses here so where do we want to
[01:28:50] go in our
[01:28:51] 12 one through 12 that's correct

[01:29:34] are we kicking the door down oh
[01:29:40] no let's go munchkin style munchkin
[01:29:43] style I don't know what munchkin style
[01:29:48] is I'm sorry I'm not familiar with that
[01:29:51] one you're kicking the door down we're
[01:29:53] kicking the the door down we go in there
[01:29:56] we kick that door down that detective
[01:29:57] goes wandering and he kicks the door
[01:29:59] down he bumps in and oh no a
[01:30:03] thror comes flying out towards him out
[01:30:06] of that door Nicks his face bringing you
[01:30:10] down to two strength as you wander
[01:30:13] through that Wasteland oh my friend we
[01:30:16] had some rough times but you know what
[01:30:19] you're wandering in that Wasteland and
[01:30:21] you see a vault in the distance when
[01:30:24] that vault in the distance you end up
[01:30:26] wandering towards that and there's one
[01:30:28] through 10 of the bosses we can go
[01:30:30] against
[01:30:31] here what was the one from the back what
[01:30:35] was the one from the back so the back
[01:30:38] one the back one would have been a
[01:30:41] fungus dinosaur so you would have gotten
[01:30:43] you would have lost that one anyways too
[01:30:45] you would have lost that one anyways too
[01:30:48] the back
[01:30:50] one but here we go we have
[01:30:56] you yeah you would have gotten beaten by
[01:30:57] either of them either way yes but you
[01:30:59] have a boss now one through 10 as you
[01:31:02] wander through the Wasteland you're
[01:31:04] getting to that Vault you see the Vault
[01:31:05] and you're like oh a vault I'm gonna go
[01:31:06] safely reest in that Vault and you see
[01:31:09] that and right in front of you jumps out
[01:31:11] one two three four five right before you
[01:31:14] get to that Vault out
[01:31:17] jumps
[01:31:19] Sauron with his mighty ring finger he
[01:31:23] flip clicks you out into that Wasteland
[01:31:27] but luckily you just bounce off of the
[01:31:29] Vault wall and in that process when you
[01:31:32] bounce you land off that on that wall
[01:31:34] drop on down and you get one of these I
[01:31:36] think there's 19 left there one of those
[01:31:39] 19 packs left up there it's just a
[01:31:40] little thank you for hanging out you got
[01:31:43] beaten down I know one two three and

[01:31:58] for all of eternity the young Indiana
[01:32:00] Jones Chronicles from

[01:47:12] packs of cards are like I said really
[01:47:14] cheap now the thing that's interesting
[01:47:16] intriguing to me is I thought these ones

[01:47:33] that are
[01:47:34] $60 these packs of cards have people in

[01:56:50] attention you if you watch any of our
[01:56:52] vide videos on YouTube uh that's what we
[01:56:54] do we do um that's what we do is we do
[01:56:57] this all to pay for doing our YouTube
[01:56:59] channel that we can do our videos on
[01:57:01] which I actually need to get some some
[01:57:03] of our um shorts out I've haven't I've
[01:57:05] been very laxed this week with our
[01:57:07] shorts that's in the wrong
[01:57:11] way that went upside down I don't like
[01:57:14] that then so I have to get back to doing
[01:57:16] my shorts better but we'll get those out
[01:57:19] there then you SS breaks thank you SS
[01:57:21] breakes
[01:57:23] really want the Wasteland all right well
[01:57:26] I mean it is in there the the Wasteland
[01:57:29] is there as a pack it's one of the boxes
[01:57:31] there which one are you going to try it
[01:57:33] are you going to be the lucky enough one
[01:57:35] to get it is what it boils down to I
[01:57:37] mean you get some we give you good stuff
[01:57:39] there one of the things I try to do when
[01:57:40] I do the pack deals and stuff is I don't
[01:57:42] want to screw
[01:57:43] people so I make sure whenever I do
[01:57:47] these that it's you get you're not going
[01:57:48] to be like you're not feeling screwed
[01:57:50] when you get something like you're not
[01:57:51] getting a $1 item when you spend $12 you
[01:57:54] know so that's why I try to do it where
[01:57:56] you get like a decent deal on like packs
[01:57:58] and what you'll get back and that type
[01:58:01] so we have and if you don't that's why I
[01:58:02] try to do then if you don't get a big
[01:58:04] hit I try to do like the The Vault pack
[01:58:05] things or the benjes you know I try to
[01:58:07] make it TOS fun and we're not like and
[01:58:10] and you know we're having a good time
[01:58:12] that's really what it is but let's do uh
[01:58:14] you know no one's jumping in yeah no
[01:58:17] problem sins and hey uh always just
[01:58:19] remember always we ever ask just do
[01:58:22] follow us uh when you get a chance if

[01:58:38] that's awesome so like anything fun like
[01:58:40] that we just like having a fun and a
[01:58:42] good time with you all and thank you and
[01:58:44] to throw up one of our little gies that
[01:58:45] we normally do like the little family
[01:58:47] sign pack things there and these right
[01:58:50] here are our SE ings in the reward boxes
[01:58:55] if anybody wants to try the reward boxes
[01:58:58] but I'm going to go on and we have also
[01:59:00] our adventure game which is a fully
[01:59:03] animated Adventure game here which
[01:59:05] actually with people telling me I do
[01:59:07] pretty good with the D and D thing I've
[01:59:08] been debating on doing a uh doing a
[01:59:11] little D and D type game myself um you
[01:59:15] think you would it would people want to
[01:59:17] uh have me do a d and d game for them
[01:59:20] and do it on like a patron thing where
[01:59:22] do a d and d game for everyone those
[01:59:23] that want to join in and participate I
[01:59:26] don't know I've never done anything like
[01:59:27] that where I was the uh dungeon master
[01:59:29] but I have everybody telling me I need
[01:59:30] to be a dungeon
[01:59:32] master so I figured I'd try it out maybe
[01:59:34] one of these
[01:59:36] days all right let's put out some
[01:59:38] different stuff here's our
[01:59:42] ceilings no it is I was that I was
[01:59:45] saying Patron I can put it on people
[01:59:47] would pay they join as me they pay
[01:59:49] whatever they want to have me be the
[01:59:52] dungeon master for the day for whatever
[01:59:54] the event is and that's what I would do
[01:59:56] it
[01:59:57] asine yeah that's what my thought was
[02:00:00] because I can do it all with my
[02:00:01] animations and everything that I do like
[02:00:03] have the game set up and have they go
[02:00:05] through the animations they can be
[02:00:06] sitting wherever they want with their
[02:00:07] buddies as a big group they can be by
[02:00:10] themselves all together because they're
[02:00:11] around the world and they want to hang
[02:00:12] out with their friends you know what I
[02:00:14] mean that's kind of what I my thought
[02:00:16] process on it was all right we're going
[02:00:18] to do an adventure game let's throw an
[02:00:21] adventure Ure game out we haven't done
[02:00:23] one of those in a little
[02:00:25] while doing an adventure game for this
[02:00:29] here all right and what happens
[02:00:34] is you go and pick your
[02:00:37] characters whichever character you want
[02:00:39] to be and there's four of them I'll put
[02:00:42] those back up you go wandering through
[02:00:43] the Wasteland here and when you wander
[02:00:45] through the Wasteland in the back of
[02:00:47] these there's
[02:00:49] uh these two boxes
[02:00:52] with three different things you pull you
[02:00:54] pull a red a green and a blue each one
[02:00:57] of those that you pull out gives you
[02:00:58] either plus or minus your strength to
[02:01:00] potentially beat one of the 10 bosses
[02:01:04] that are here now depending on the
[02:01:06] amount of strength you have if you get
[02:01:08] the highest amount of strength which is
[02:01:09] about seven when you're coming out here
[02:01:11] with this because this is going to start
[02:01:12] you out with four strength you could
[02:01:15] potentially be 60% of the bosses so six
[02:01:18] out of 10 bosses there so that's why we
[02:01:20] do our little Wasteland game and if you
[02:01:21] beat the boss we do a $1 loot Dr for all
[02:01:24] you in Wasteland and even no matter what
[02:01:26] every time you play you always find your
[02:01:28] way to a vault where you get a Benji
[02:01:30] which is one of our uh our loot pack
[02:01:32] things there so it's just a little thing
[02:01:34] under a dollar so nothing special
[02:01:36] nothing special just something small and
[02:01:38] silly under a dollar but let's do this
[02:01:41] then maybe you guys want to try out the
[02:01:47] uh maybe you want to do something like
[02:01:50] this for for the
[02:01:54] um for a game here we'll put
[02:01:58] out this is my oldest son thought of
[02:02:01] this one he goes we we're gonna call
[02:02:03] this The
[02:02:05] Showdown all right you're G to go the
[02:02:08] single
[02:02:10] or the pack the single or the pack which
[02:02:15] one do you want it is a zombie feral
[02:02:19] ghoul surge foil or an outlaw of Thunder
[02:02:22] Junction play
[02:02:26] booster now the point of what we're
[02:02:28] doing here is I want to do giveaways
[02:02:30] today and my giveaways I'm gonna be
[02:02:32] doing is either gonna be packs or
[02:02:33] singles but I need people to jump in and
[02:02:36] do uh the packs or the singles here so I
[02:02:38] know who we're going to be going because
[02:02:40] there's the more singles that are sold
[02:02:41] or the more packs it depends on what it
[02:02:43] is if we're going to be the singles of
[02:02:45] the packs there all right I'll put that
[02:02:48] away no one wanted those

[02:37:02] was starting off with on the low side
[02:37:04] getting warming up now is that something

[02:37:09] getting higher and higher as the day
[02:37:12] progressed but I'll leave those out for

[03:08:09] foil the shipping shot up what are you
[03:08:12] talking about shipping shot up
[03:08:19] well after you get a certain amount of
[03:08:20] singles it w it could shoot up like say
[03:08:23] or if you get a
[03:08:27] pack well it's uh it might be saying
[03:08:29] your total is that amount but let me
[03:08:31] double check um let me go and look at
[03:08:33] something online here quickly and I'll
[03:08:36] will let you know give me a sec here it
[03:08:38] might be because it's the total of all

[03:09:27] put the singles in when I do them as 1
[03:09:29] ounce is the lowest I can get them and
[03:09:31] since you gotten up to if you go the
[03:09:33] third one it's going to be at three
[03:09:35] ounces which means it needs to go to the
[03:09:37] next level of
[03:09:40] weight um for um the singles which is
[03:09:45] brings it to the next is your next
[03:09:47] weight level class which is $2 and
[03:09:49] whatever for all of the shipping
[03:09:51] combined it should be um I'm not 100%
[03:09:56] sure but I know when I've done singles
[03:09:58] that's how it worked when I did singles
[03:10:00] with other people um but that it was my
[03:10:04] understanding of how that worked so uh

[00:02:25] no oh
[00:02:27] no let's see if I have them over here
[00:02:30] here I think I have this in here too
[00:02:31] spoiling my own dinner mom's spoiling
[00:02:33] dinner what are you doing to spoil a
[00:02:35] dinner no my dinner what are you doing
[00:02:36] to spoil a
[00:02:38] dinner snack oh Mom's e a
[00:02:43] snack I have some secret layer I got in
[00:02:46] I don't know if anybody would be
[00:02:47] interested in it I have to go through
[00:02:48] and figure out some pricing
[00:02:50] though open mom wants to open one of
[00:02:54] them we'll maybe maybe we'll let Mom
[00:02:56] open one at some point to look at it see
[00:02:58] if she gets lucky to get the cool monry
[00:03:00] out of
[00:03:02] there oh
[00:03:06] oh this is the
[00:03:14] uh secret layer like the uh they just
[00:03:16] you always get the same cards but
[00:03:18] generally this time for some reason with
[00:03:19] secret layer they're giving everybody a
[00:03:20] chance of getting a different one
[00:03:26] potentially but it's like the the one
[00:03:30] it's one we did yeah where some are
[00:03:34] plain and some are yeah I had some non
[00:03:36] foil and some foil correct they are um
[00:03:39] here we go we got those oh all right
[00:03:40] maybe we can do that maybe we can do
[00:03:44] that it maybe somebody would like uh
[00:03:47] that's what I'll do for one of our games
[00:03:48] one day we'll put in a a little secret
[00:03:53] layer
[00:03:55] special as like the ceiling in a game or
[00:03:57] something like that can I look at one
[00:03:59] yeah you can look at any of the boxes
[00:04:01] maybe that'll be something a Fallout
[00:04:03] secret layer special in there
[00:04:06] o four cards
[00:04:08] huh it had it does have monoc or monoc
[00:04:13] crys or some other ones I do it's weird
[00:04:14] I don't like how they did that
[00:04:15] personally I will admit I do not like
[00:04:17] how they did that cuz secret layer
[00:04:19] you're supposed to get the same thing
[00:04:20] everyone when you buy it but you do have
[00:04:23] a chance of getting something cool that
[00:04:25] is actually the new one the way they did
[00:04:27] that you get a monoc crypt or um some
[00:04:30] other things in there yeah I can't
[00:04:31] remember exactly what they
[00:04:36] are see
[00:04:38] here all right that is
[00:04:41] correct here we go run that for a few
[00:04:45] minutes yeah but the secret layer we
[00:04:47] haven't got a chance to open any of them
[00:04:48] yet but we've been debating on it been
[00:04:50] debating on
[00:04:53] it I'm actually you know cuz we're going
[00:04:55] to keep at least one of them so I'm
[00:04:57] debating on opening one so that we can
[00:04:59] use it of each one and then keeping one
[00:05:02] of each one and then uh obviously we'll
[00:05:04] sell the rest cuz I bought a bunch of
[00:05:05] them so uh I don't know maybe people
[00:05:07] people interested in these they are a
[00:05:10] little bit on the expensive side it does
[00:05:11] seem though we'll see though if people
[00:05:13] want
[00:05:14] them maybe I'll throw it out there right
[00:05:16] now put them some out here yeah do it I
[00:05:19] one no we're not going to open one right
[00:05:21] now you want to one you can wait my
[00:05:24] Steph my wife has zero patience she's
[00:05:26] the woman that goes up and grabs a
[00:05:27] package and does this shaking it the
[00:05:30] entire time trying to Fig oh I've
[00:05:32] watched you do it only when I was a kid

[00:11:57] already flying sharks are all awesome
[00:11:59] yes I will have to say flying sharks are
[00:12:01] probably one of the best things that you
[00:12:03] can have uh with anything here hey Shane
[00:12:06] H or and Mystic coming in how you doing
[00:12:09] Mystic enforcer haven't seen you for a
[00:12:11] while how's your uh how's your day going
[00:12:22] here we'll put that one on like
[00:12:25] that yeah hey I can't do anything about
[00:12:28] that um long story short I caught them
[00:12:31] lying they had to update their terms and
[00:12:34] Service uh to effectively say that I got
[00:12:38] suspended cuz without updating their
[00:12:40] terms of service they had no way of
[00:12:42] doing that so now I have to uh go to a
[00:12:46] lawyer is what it seems like where is my
[00:12:52] deck I'll be back in a little while go
[00:12:54] not frequently
[00:12:57] though yeah they are quite frankly it
[00:13:01] was somebody ended up lying about
[00:13:03] something I sent them evidence then they
[00:13:06] changed it from one thing to another and
[00:13:08] then right before uh they sent me an
[00:13:10] email they made sure the day before they
[00:13:12] updated their terms of service to send
[00:13:13] me an email the next
[00:13:15] day a little convenient and then when I
[00:13:17] asked for the terms of service they said
[00:13:19] we're closing the case get a
[00:13:21] lawyer I'm like all right I see what
[00:13:25] happened
[00:13:35] but yeah that's what I ran into what are
[00:13:36] you looking for where's my deck your
[00:13:38] deck what
[00:13:40] one should be over there I made itue
[00:13:43] didn't I huh did you take it out of the
[00:13:46] clear case yeah it might have been taken
[00:13:48] out of the clear case or it's over there
[00:13:50] and
[00:13:51] it's no not the blue is the ones over
[00:13:55] there should be over there on the side
[00:13:57] next to St this yeah should be one of
[00:13:58] the on no no there's not there's black
[00:14:00] and red ones this is pirate and vampire
[00:14:05] should be around here somewhere
[00:14:07] then this is maybe it's up at the top up
[00:14:10] there I don't think I moved out there
[00:14:12] this
[00:14:13] is if anybody wants anything though let
[00:14:15] me know I can always uh adjust one of
[00:14:19] the the the auction so it goes a little
[00:14:22] quicker sure it's not over there that
[00:14:26] that's
[00:14:27] weird where else would I put them I know
[00:14:30] I looked in your bag it's there checking
[00:14:32] the only thing I can think of is
[00:14:33] checking some of the U the boxes over
[00:14:37] there
[00:14:40] yeah yeah that's what I'm
[00:14:44] saying I don't know maybe I don't see it
[00:14:47] over
[00:14:50] here probably

[00:19:52] [ __ ] hey wait a minute is it this one

[00:20:13] I'll put that away no one wants the
[00:20:15] ioria I might end up opening one just
[00:20:18] for myself to see if we get any
[00:20:20] luck we'll do uh maybe we'll do
[00:20:23] this somebody want some uh shocklands
[00:20:28] or ATT temp to CHOC
[00:20:30] lands then A rad Coast or something like
[00:20:33] that that'd be
[00:20:41] nice uh so far Steph has
[00:20:44] won uh most of the times because we play
[00:20:47] we don't play head-to-head we've only
[00:20:49] played as as like the family as a four
[00:20:50] of us playing like um so but when that
[00:20:53] happens she's won
[00:20:55] twice or once and then Nolan won and
[00:20:57] will won I can't remember who I don't
[00:20:58] know I won once she won once and then
[00:21:00] somebody else won we don't do we don't
[00:21:02] do um Commander we were playing as a
[00:21:04] family cuz we all do we tried to do the
[00:21:06] four of us to play together as a family
[00:21:07] and I really would have definitely won
[00:21:09] the last time really really like sooner
[00:21:11] if I had actually played my or maybe it
[00:21:13] was the one that you got one then I got
[00:21:16] mad because I'm like damn it cuz I
[00:21:18] didn't know the cards and I played them
[00:21:19] in the wrong order and it C have
[00:21:20] multiplied yes that's what it was it
[00:21:22] could have multiplied you played him in
[00:21:24] the wrong order that's what it was yeah
[00:21:25] I'm like a well that's the same thing I
[00:21:27] do that all the time too yeah you just
[00:21:30] she generally beats everyone though
[00:21:31] because my oldest son will make sure
[00:21:34] that I lose or he goes head to-head
[00:21:35] pretty much with me even though we're
[00:21:37] playing Commander to make sure that I
[00:21:39] lose and that none of them can win so
[00:21:41] that they have a better chance of
[00:21:42] winning that's what he says I want to
[00:21:44] make sure you lose so that they can
[00:21:49] win that's what he does yeah you just
[00:21:52] yeah yep
[00:21:55] yep so that's what my oldest does and
[00:21:57] why we uh that's why we're in the
[00:22:00] situations we're in sometimes well I
[00:22:02] might want to switch out some of the
[00:22:05] lands let's do this flash sale five of
[00:22:09] these
[00:22:10] for $3 off for 2 minutes what was that
[00:22:14] can I switch out some of those lands
[00:22:16] yeah you can switch out some of the
[00:22:18] lands some of the ones
[00:22:24] in yeah if you like the other ones
[00:22:26] that's the whole point where we've been
[00:22:27] collecting those lands stuff was so that
[00:22:29] you can switch them out some instance
[00:22:31] I'll have to look through what we
[00:22:32] already have you can upgrade your
[00:22:35] upgrade your deck that's the whole point
[00:22:36] of why we getting these things that's
[00:22:37] why I say is there anything you want I'm
[00:22:38] going to [ __ ] kick all your asses and
[00:22:41] you'll be on the boat she'll be beating
[00:22:43] us all the time whenever we play yeah I
[00:22:45] going to have to start going online and
[00:22:47] play online because you're too easy to
[00:22:50] beat yeah and then you get to online
[00:22:52] with the people that cheat which is why
[00:22:54] I don't play online as much as I would I
[00:22:55] need to find like a group of people to
[00:22:56] play with we might find them on the
[00:22:59] boats yeah I know that's true that's
[00:23:01] true um all those creatures James though
[00:23:05] that I think in the other one I'll put
[00:23:07] the list I don't think I have any of

[00:46:52] let me double check I don't think I have
[00:46:54] it in any of the games I just need a
[00:46:56] double check here I don't think I put
[00:46:59] that in a

[01:03:53] this Wasteland but you know what that's
[01:03:54] okay maybe they find a friend in the
[01:03:57] distance because you know what humans
[01:04:00] there's lots of human friends in the
[01:04:01] Wasteland here as you go wandering

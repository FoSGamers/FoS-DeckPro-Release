Look in the Help Request chat and any of the other chats that will help you or documents that will help you, especially, you know, survey stuff or documentation from the sale on exactly what I have for items. But, currently, the generator is not running well. It's overheating. I need you to see everything that I did. My other question that I have is I just, when I put the oil filter on, it came off a little harder than it came off when I took it off from them servicing it. Is it possible that I've tightened it down too much, restricting oil flow, causing the overheating?

Based on the documents you provided, here’s a summary of relevant information regarding your generator and your question about the oil filter:

### Generator Details:
- **Model:** Northern Lights 6KW
- **Hours:** 6,500
- **Condition:** Functional but described as having "higher hours due to ex-charter use."
- **Notes:** Future servicing or replacement is recommended within the next few years due to wear【12†source】【19†source】.

### Oil Filter Concerns:
The overheating of your generator could be related to oil flow issues if the oil filter is over-tightened. When the oil filter is overly tightened, it can lead to:
1. **Damaged Seals:** Over-tightening can compromise the seal, causing leaks or blocking oil flow.
2. **Restricted Oil Flow:** This restriction can lead to inadequate lubrication and overheating.
3. **Potential Cracking:** Excessive pressure from tightening may damage the filter housing or internal components.

### Recommendations:
1. **Oil Filter Installation:**
   - When installing a new oil filter, tighten it to the manufacturer’s recommended torque specification. Usually, hand-tightening until snug and then adding a quarter to half a turn is sufficient unless the manual specifies otherwise【18†source】.
   - Verify the filter model and ensure it meets the engine's specifications.

2. **Overheating Causes:**
   - Inspect cooling systems (coolant levels, water pump, and cooling fans) for any blockages or malfunction.
   - Check for proper oil levels and quality. Old or degraded oil can also lead to overheating.

3. **Maintenance Records:** 
   - If servicing was recently done, consult the service logs or mechanics involved to determine if the oil filter installation or oil type used deviated from specifications【17†source】【19†source】.

### Next Steps:
1. Reassess the tightness of the oil filter and adjust it to the proper torque setting if needed.
2. Monitor the generator during operation to identify overheating triggers (e.g., extended load times, ambient temperature effects).
3. Consider professional evaluation if overheating persists to avoid long-term damage.

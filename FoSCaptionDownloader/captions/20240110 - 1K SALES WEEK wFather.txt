[00:35:01] mouth do I still sound like Bill Murray
[00:35:04] because I had people tell me I sound
[00:35:06] like that the other day and I think it
[00:35:07] was because I had gauze in my mouth from
[00:35:09] having a tooth pulled so I don't I don't
[00:35:11] think I still sound like them anymore
[00:35:12] but I I need to see this I need to see
[00:35:14] if you guys think I know nope I didn't
[00:35:16] think so one two three four five one two
[00:35:19] three four five I figured that I'm like
[00:35:22] every like I was like you sound like I'm
[00:35:24] like no I don't I've been listening to
[00:35:25] myself for years on video and I never
[00:35:27] sound like him so like it's got to be
[00:35:29] the gauze that's in my mouth for where
[00:35:31] the hole in my mouth is for the tooth
[00:35:33] being

[00:36:01] you've heard me talking without the
[00:36:02] gauze in my mouth somebody came in when
[00:36:04] I had the tooth pulled it was like a
[00:36:06] couple days after my tooth was pulled
[00:36:07] and I had the gauze in my mouth so I was
[00:36:08] talking a little bit mumbled and like

[00:36:12] you sound like Bill Murray I'm like I
[00:36:14] don't
[00:36:15] know then like I listen to myself with a
[00:36:18] gauze in my mouth I'm like one two three
[00:36:20] four five I'm like you know what I kind
[00:36:22] of I can see on some of the things I say
[00:36:25] why they say that now but it was I think

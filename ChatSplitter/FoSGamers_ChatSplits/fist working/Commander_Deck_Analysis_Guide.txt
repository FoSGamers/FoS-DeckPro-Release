The cards that are being used aren't too old. I need ones from March into the Machine or Newer. So that is the most recent sets of March into the Machine or Newer all the way up to Assassin's Creed. So that would be Lord of the Rings, Fallout, that would be Modern Horizon 3, that would be Burners of Karlok Manor, Ravnica, and any of the ones in between there that I happen to be missing.

Only use the sets that I've mentioned, or the sets between them. Do not use anything older than Martian Machine. So anything from the date that Martian Machine came out, or prior, do not use. Any other ones, make sure you analyze several of those sets and alphacards in them, 100% knowledge on them all, so you know exactly what they do, and how to use them.

Analyze each set mentioned. Get rid of throws beyond death, because that is not needed. And all the other ones that were mentioned, and then between there, make sure you analyze each one of the sets. Be 100% sure you know each card inside each set. Then, analyze each card in comparison to what could be put into the deck I provided you, and see if it will work to be anything better, or not, and provide all those cards that I should change it with.

[00:02:43] me there shouldn't be anything going
[00:02:49] on all right give me a second here
[00:02:53] again I wonder if it's because I have a
[00:02:55] bunch of things allowed to be working
[00:02:56] right now
[00:03:08] no not it it's so
[00:03:13] weird so
[00:03:20] weird is it breaking up or
[00:03:24] no you guys have to let me
[00:03:27] know but this morning
[00:03:30] we're going to do some Pack openings and
[00:03:31] try a little bit of our adventure
[00:03:35] game now we added some more things I was
[00:03:38] wondering if you were going to be
[00:03:39] interested in seeing our new
[00:03:42] uh oh no where were
[00:03:46] they what did I do him
[00:03:54] under think it was here yes it was
[00:04:14] damn it this is why it's a a testing day
[00:04:19] here because we didn't have everything
[00:04:21] set up correctly oops
[00:04:33] where was
[00:04:47] that there you go that was
[00:04:51] it
[00:04:54] there no one's on here talking at the
[00:04:56] moment so I figured out well they
[00:04:58] weren't at that time I went over here so
[00:05:00] let's
[00:05:02] do got you call it
[00:05:30] here we
[00:05:31] go let's try
[00:05:34] that can I find
[00:05:39] it Well there we go it's now the arena
[00:05:44] you guys are going to walk into ah let's
[00:05:47] see if I add that in there so there
[00:05:50] let's add that
[00:06:02] there now I can turn it on whenever I
[00:06:04] want but any oh really is it freezing on
[00:06:07] all of you
[00:06:08] guys is it okay is it freezing you guys
[00:06:10] got to give me a little H hint
[00:06:12] here my concern
[00:06:14] is I wonder if we need to move my well
[00:06:18] it worked fine right away this morning
[00:06:20] it says I get a fast connection some
[00:06:22] reason whatnot is being not nice on this
[00:06:24] computer
[00:06:31] really that is so [ __ ] weird cuz if I
[00:06:35] turn
[00:06:42] off oh my god
[00:06:47] seriously all right let's try
[00:06:50] um why would that be
[00:06:53] happening why would that be happening at
[00:06:57] all I don't understand why that's
[00:06:59] happening at
[00:07:01] all let's see why could that be
[00:07:04] occurring on on whatnot here because
[00:07:06] it's not occurring anywhere
[00:07:10] else he perfectly fine everywhere else
[00:07:13] again another testing day he's going to
[00:07:15] be taken up by issues with the
[00:07:18] technology and not streaming nicely
[00:07:21] because whatnot is being uh I don't know
[00:07:23] [ __ ] [ __ ] or something sucking
[00:07:25] everything down and not working
[00:07:32] like doing nothing
[00:07:34] worthwhile hey we keep hting uh like
[00:07:37] pixelation but it doesn't work I'm not
[00:07:39] getting any problems anywhere but
[00:07:41] whatnot with
[00:07:42] pixelation no freezing anywhere else
[00:07:45] even no pixelation anywhere else even
[00:07:48] but whatnot all of a sudden has like
[00:07:50] pixelation and freezing it's just very
[00:07:53] odd very very odd
[00:08:08] it's the weirdest
[00:08:10] thing there's something whatnot does not
[00:08:13] like what does whatnot not like
[00:08:18] here cuz I haven't changed anything CU
[00:08:21] if I switch over
[00:08:23] to my phone thing it worked fine
[00:08:27] yesterday so it has to be something with
[00:08:28] the internet connection
[00:08:30] you
[00:08:32] world there's got to be something with
[00:08:34] the internet
[00:08:38] connection and see that's so
[00:08:49] weird let me try something I'm going to
[00:08:52] be right back I'm going to try something
[00:08:54] here
[00:09:05] what
[00:09:46] all right let's see if that makes it any
[00:09:47] better this is going to be that was a
[00:09:49] weird test we'll see if it
[00:09:51] helps I don't know we'll find out here
[00:09:53] in a minute if it
[00:09:55] helps I need towels no no didn't do
[00:09:59] anything
[00:10:00] maybe maybe maybe not Mom said she needs
[00:10:03] paper towels get up and help her I
[00:10:06] am is that doing any
[00:10:10] better does seem
[00:10:13] better it's doing better all right it's
[00:10:15] doing
[00:10:16] better oh spoke too soon damn it all the
[00:10:20] hell we're trying to figure out how why
[00:10:23] the tech is not working right on one on
[00:10:25] it looks like I'm freezing and getting
[00:10:26] some pixelation or um
[00:10:29] on everywhere but
[00:10:32] YouTube um so I was trying to it's weird
[00:10:35] I was trying to get to work right but
[00:10:37] for some reason it doesn't want
[00:10:43] to whatnot is very
[00:10:46] um intriguing at the
[00:10:50] moment
[00:10:55] well that really stinks
[00:10:59] let's get you a pack though yeps and
[00:11:02] we'll get things out here for a second
[00:11:04] hopefully you can see everything okay
[00:11:07] when I'm doing this we'll get a pack for
[00:11:09] you yeps and hopefully we'll be able to
[00:11:10] see
[00:11:16] this oh come

[00:12:03] that we'll get that out for you let's
[00:12:04] see what else we can get
[00:12:07] it yeah see is it any better than it was
[00:12:09] before though that's my question if it's
[00:12:11] any better than it was before that might
[00:12:12] help
[00:12:14] me no I don't
[00:12:18] know like if it like somewhat got better
[00:12:22] than when it was when I first uh came

[00:12:27] think we should be able to see it all
[00:12:28] right let me know if you can't or and
[00:12:30] you want me to do something different
[00:12:31] but yep you around my

[00:27:36] art Island those are nice pickups on
[00:27:38] that there we go let me get those put
[00:27:42] away and now because this is what
[00:27:44] happened you got yourself a soul
[00:27:46] Cleaver which we're going to say that is
[00:27:49] getting you an ax uhuh look at that oh
[00:27:54] what the how's it over there
[00:28:02] why is the axe over
[00:28:08] there you found yourself an axe
[00:28:12] aha for your uh encounter but
[00:28:16] now it's going to
[00:28:18] be with some L water areas so you're
[00:28:21] going to be in an
[00:28:23] island that Coliseum that you wandered
[00:28:27] into starts to flood
[00:28:30] and as you see it
[00:28:32] flood little Islands pop out you jump
[00:28:35] you swim quickly to one of them and as
[00:28:37] you get to the
[00:28:39] island in front of
[00:28:42] you you see mutated dinosaur coming
[00:28:46] running towards you look like something
[00:28:48] might be on his back you're not really
[00:28:49] sure what that is but comes running
[00:28:51] toward you you have to decide what are
[00:28:54] you going to do my friend
[00:29:08] now like I said we are in the testing
[00:29:10] phases phases so if this is all works we
[00:29:12] like how the game goes we'll uh do some
[00:29:15] more animations for everything so it
[00:29:16] looks looks a bit
[00:29:21] cooler see to decide I'm going to put
[00:29:23] these packs away so we don't lose your
[00:29:26] stuff
[00:29:29] and
[00:29:31] then you're deciding on what you're
[00:29:33] going to do to fight the
[00:29:40] dino cannot dual wield the axe of the
[00:29:42] mace maybe if you get a Little Bit
[00:29:43] Stronger it's
[00:29:45] possible
[00:29:47] um the assault rifle comes with 30
[00:29:49] rounds of
[00:29:51] ammo and you cannot dual whe the assault
[00:29:53] rifle and the pistol you can only dual
[00:29:55] whe
[00:29:56] pistols you can uh later on when you get
[00:30:00] stronger maybe you might be able to dual
[00:30:01] wield the axe and the uh the sword but
[00:30:03] the sword's pretty big it's uh so it's
[00:30:05] it's a little hard for you to dual wield
[00:30:07] the the
[00:30:09] uh ma I mean mace is pretty big let me
[00:30:12] find out where it is why isn't it not
[00:30:14] here I had it available I have to go
[00:30:16] back and play around with my thing there
[00:30:18] so you have to adjust that the boat is
[00:30:20] not going bad not going too bad we're
[00:30:23] having a good time with it um we'll
[00:30:26] throw this out for the next person if
[00:30:27] there's somebody wants to do this we're
[00:30:28] going to put this out
[00:30:30] here coming up after yeps we'll do this

[00:44:44] yeps with your character or did you just
[00:44:47] want to see some packs opened let may
[00:44:51] know oh that one was empty so on to the
[00:44:55] next one
[00:44:59] there we
[00:44:59] are all right it's a little frustrating
[00:45:02] definitely with the uh internet thing
[00:45:03] going on right now trying to figure out
[00:45:05] why I think that's in the back of my
[00:45:06] mind causing issues with me
[00:45:08] uh trying to think overly harder at the
[00:45:12] moment what could be
[00:45:14] causing that and I don't think it's a
[00:45:17] I'm wondering if it's like
[00:45:21] a compression thing on starlink no that
[00:45:25] wouldn't make sense because it doesn't
[00:45:27] work do anything anywhere
[00:45:32] else
[00:45:34] huh
[00:45:36] yes you going to do some more exploring
[00:45:38] all right so did a little bit more
[00:45:40] exploring when you were wandering
[00:45:43] around let's see if we can do this see
[00:45:46] if I can get my swamp to grow
[00:46:05] is this
[00:46:13] one I know was that one maybe was this
[00:46:18] one nope that's not
[00:46:23] it Ah that's
[00:46:25] it let's add a source
[00:46:34] here you have a you need some
[00:46:41] help we have to switch it I did didn't
[00:46:44] work
[00:46:46] no
[00:46:48] okay well then we'll go check stuff out
[00:46:56] take all
[00:46:59] right that
[00:47:01] is we'll do that add that into our thing
[00:47:05] here you are now wandering
[00:47:12] in a
[00:47:16] swamp has grown in the
[00:47:18] arena and out of that
[00:47:22] swamp you see
[00:47:26] a feral ghoul
[00:47:32] shows it over
[00:47:34] there
[00:47:36] uhoh now
[00:47:38] luckily those aren't
[00:47:40] tough but they are
[00:47:43] quick so you have to decide what you're
[00:47:45] going to do with your stuff are you
[00:47:47] going to attack you're going to run
[00:47:52] away you decide what you're going to do
[00:47:55] my friend
[00:48:00] why is it still CRA crackling out there
[00:48:03] he's getting an axe I like it all right
[00:48:05] so the axe comes
[00:48:07] out that's plus five which is
[00:48:11] nice oh 14 plus five nice big hit so
[00:48:16] that means you're going to
[00:48:19] get nice big hit out of 12
[00:48:22] potentially uh-oh what did you get
[00:48:25] here oh oh no it was a
[00:48:35] two well yeps I'm sorry but you did hit
[00:48:40] it did hit it luckily it's only a very
[00:48:42] weak creature this creature is only uh
[00:48:46] 15 Health there so you hit it for
[00:48:50] two knock it down to 13 but it's not
[00:48:53] happy with you and it scratch you tries
[00:48:56] to at least
[00:48:57] let's see if it gets lucky and does
[00:48:59] it oh no it hits you now we're going to
[00:49:04] have to check the damage it done let's
[00:49:07] check the damage it's
[00:49:10] done oh five
[00:49:13] yeps you got a scrape not a good one
[00:49:17] though you go down to
[00:49:19] 77 Health you're getting unlucky my
[00:49:23] friend now you get one more swing what
[00:49:26] are you going to do
[00:49:27] one more
[00:49:28] [Music]
[00:49:48] attempt
[00:49:50] then I think we'll uh
[00:49:57] have to be getting ready to go some
[00:50:00] moving again with the
[00:50:05] axe all right we'll try again with the
[00:50:08] axe all right 16 oh nice plus your five
[00:50:13] put you in the critical hit area but you
[00:50:15] can't get a hit critical by hitting ex
[00:50:16] that exactly so we're going to add it
[00:50:18] onto your
[00:50:21] damage so you get
[00:50:23] four plus five because you go over
[00:50:27] that's where a little bonus we give you
[00:50:29] so that makes nine when you hit your
[00:50:31] charact when you
[00:50:34] hit the uh feral ghoul there knocking
[00:50:38] him
[00:50:44] down to four Health feral ghoul decides
[00:50:48] to turn around and flee cuz it's
[00:50:51] scared as it flees
[00:50:58] it
[00:51:00] drops a bunch of pogs there there it is
[00:51:04] one
[00:51:04] two 3 4 5
[00:51:08] 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
[00:51:14] 14
[00:51:18] 14 they have some durability over time
[00:51:22] that is why the pogs come in
[00:51:24] handy because eventually
[00:51:27] when you get to a location you're going
[00:51:28] to want to uh maybe get them replaced or
[00:51:31] fixed or something like that you know
[00:51:32] what I mean worked
[00:51:35] on so you do have to worry about that
[00:51:37] but
[00:51:38] luckily that feral gou ran
[00:51:41] away you good
[00:51:45] now so so far what do you guys think is
[00:51:48] it is the game the new version is it
[00:51:50] entertaining do we like
[00:51:51] it I don't know you guys got to let me
[00:51:54] know is it something that we should
[00:51:55] continue to do
[00:51:59] I can up do better with the animations
[00:52:01] you know get those
[00:52:02] running the in the images and stuff like
[00:52:05] that so uh but this is kind of like our
[00:52:08] our second test day of it it does seem
[00:52:09] like the internet's a little bit better
[00:52:11] but not fully better so I think what I'm
[00:52:13] going to have to do is either move where
[00:52:16] the star link
[00:52:18] is I don't think that's the issue though
[00:52:21] but I think I have to keep playing
[00:52:22] around with the uh whatnot stream part
[00:52:26] just see if I can figure out why it's
[00:52:29] uh why it's glitching all the time cuz
[00:52:32] they're the only ones that are glitching
[00:52:33] at the
[00:52:34] moment they have full
[00:52:38] connection so that's the weirdest part
[00:52:41] about
[00:52:43] it what do you guys think you like the
[00:52:46] does the game fun good good time no yes
[00:52:49] bad
[00:52:52] time should we continue with it
[00:52:56] stream is that yep
[00:53:04] okay let's
[00:53:06] do that maybe that'll
[00:53:11] help at all no maybe
[00:53:22] potentially um
[00:53:27] I know let me know what do you guys
[00:53:34] think nope that doesn't seem any better
[00:53:37] so all right so what we'll do is we're
[00:53:38] going to jump off of uh the YouTubes
[00:53:41] here thank you all for hanging out with
[00:53:43] us for a little while while we make sure

I apologize for the confusion. Let's take a more systematic approach to extract and correctly interpret the formulas and data in the cells. I will read the actual cell values and formulas directly from the Excel file for the "Inventory" sheet and provide an accurate analysis.

### Detailed Analysis of the "Inventory" Sheet

First, I will print the values and formulas for each row in the "Inventory" sheet, then provide detailed explanations.

#### Step-by-Step Approach

1. Read each row in the "Inventory" sheet.
2. Extract the actual formulas and values from each cell.
3. Provide a detailed explanation for each row.

Let's start by extracting the data and formulas for each row.

#### Extracting Data and Formulas from the "Inventory" Sheet

Let's load the workbook again and iterate through each row in the "Inventory" sheet to capture the correct formulas and values.

```python
# Re-load the workbook to ensure we get the most accurate data
workbook = openpyxl.load_workbook(file_path, data_only=False)
inventory_sheet = workbook['Inventory']

# Extract all values and formulas for each row in the "Inventory" sheet
inventory_data = []

for row in inventory_sheet.iter_rows(min_row=1, max_row=inventory_sheet.max_row, min_col=1, max_col=inventory_sheet.max_column):
    row_data = {}
    for cell in row:
        if cell.value:
            if isinstance(cell.value, str) and cell.value.startswith('='):
                row_data[cell.coordinate] = cell.value  # Store the formula
            else:
                row_data[cell.coordinate] = cell.value  # Store the actual value
    inventory_data.append(row_data)

# Display the extracted data
import ace_tools as tools; tools.display_dataframe_to_user("Inventory Data", pd.DataFrame(inventory_data))

inventory_data
```

[2024-07-01 22:07:40] ChatGPT:
I understand your concern. Let's correctly analyze and document the entire "Inventory" sheet from start to finish.

### Corrected Analysis of the "Inventory" Sheet

I'll go through the entire sheet systematically, extracting and explaining the formulas and values for each relevant row. Here’s the detailed breakdown for each row up to Row 50.

#### Inventory Sheet Breakdown

I'll start by printing the first few rows of the inventory data in a systematic way:

1. Extract data and formulas for each row.
2. Provide detailed explanations based on the extracted data.

#### Extracting and displaying data for each row systematically

Let's begin the extraction and explanation process.

```python
import pandas as pd
import openpyxl

# Load the workbook and select the "Inventory" sheet
file_path = '/mnt/data/Cards Cost (2).xlsx'
workbook = openpyxl.load_workbook(file_path, data_only=False)
inventory_sheet = workbook['Inventory']

# Extract values and formulas from each row
inventory_data = []
for row in inventory_sheet.iter_rows(min_row=1, max_row=50, min_col=1, max_col=inventory_sheet.max_column):
    row_data = {cell.coordinate: cell.value for cell in row}
    inventory_data.append(row_data)

# Convert the data to a DataFrame for better readability
inventory_df = pd.DataFrame(inventory_data)
inventory_df.head(50)  # Display the first 50 rows for better insight
```

### Explanation of Extracted Data and Formulas

Let's interpret the extracted data and provide explanations for each row.

It seems that there was an issue with extracting and displaying the data programmatically. Let's proceed with a different approach to ensure that we correctly capture and interpret the data and formulas from the "Inventory" sheet. I'll extract the entire content of the "Inventory" sheet, including

[2024-07-01 22:08:39] ChatGPT:
Got it. Let's approach this by manually extracting and laying out the data and formulas in a grid format. I'll ensure we cover the entire sheet, capturing the data for each row in a structured manner.

### Step-by-Step Extraction

I will manually review the first several rows to ensure correctness. Here’s the data and formulas for each relevant row:

### Inventory Sheet Analysis

#### Row 3: MAT EPILOGE
- **A3**: MAT EPILOGE
- **B3**: `=D3/24` (Formula) - Cost of 1 pack calculated by dividing the total box cost by the number of packs (24).
- **C3**: `=B3*3` (Formula) - Cost of 3 packs calculated by multiplying the cost of 1 pack by 3.
- **D3**: `=46.99*1.065` (Formula) - Total box cost including tax.
- **G3**: `=(F3*3)-2` (Formula) - Sale price for 3 packs minus a fixed fee.

#### Row 4: MID DRAFT
- **A4**: MID DRAFT
- **B4**: `=D4/36` (Formula) - Cost of 1 pack calculated by dividing the total box cost by the number of packs (36).
- **C4**: `=B4*3` (Formula) - Cost of 3 packs.
- **D4**: `=70.99*1.065` (Formula) - Total box cost including tax.
- **G4**: `=(F4*3)-2` (Formula) - Sale price for 3 packs minus

To provide a clear grid layout of the data and formulas in the "Inventory" sheet, I'll outline the entire content of the sheet in a tabular format. This will ensure that all data and formulas are visible and easy to understand.

Here is the detailed extraction of the first 50 rows:

I apologize for the previous errors. Let's go through each row accurately and capture the current values and formulas from the "Inventory" tab in the provided Excel file. I will ensure each cell is correctly read and presented.

### Corrected Analysis of the "Inventory" Sheet

I'll accurately extract the values and formulas for each cell in the "Inventory" sheet manually:

1. **Load the new file and read the "Inventory" sheet.**
2. **Extract the current values and formulas for each cell.**
3. **Present the data in a clear grid layout.**

### Step-by-Step Extraction

Let's start with the first few rows and ensure accuracy.

#### Load and Extract Data

I'll manually review and outline the current data and formulas in each cell for rows 1 to 63.

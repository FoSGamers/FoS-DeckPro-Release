Do everything from scratch

Let’s build a game from scratch! I’ll structure this process systematically, starting with core concepts and mechanics, then moving into details like narrative, design, and player interactions. You can modify or expand any section as we go along.

---

### 1. Game Concept
**Title:** *Legends of the Nexus*  
**Genre:** Strategy Card & Board Hybrid Game (Physical or Digital)  
**Player Count:** 2-6 players  
**Core Theme:** Players compete to control "Nexus Nodes" in a mysterious world by summoning creatures, casting spells, and manipulating the environment. Victory is achieved through strategic control and resource management.  

---

### 2. Core Mechanics
**A. The Grid System**  
- A **4x4 grid** represents the Nexus Battlefield.  
- Each player deploys units (cards) onto the grid.  
- Units have attack, defense, range, and special abilities.  

**B. Resource Management**  
- Players share a **universal energy pool** (e.g., 50 Energy Points per round).  
- Each action (summoning, attacking, etc.) costs energy. Players must carefully balance their resource usage.  

**C. Turn Structure**  
- **Draw Phase:** Draw 2 cards.  
- **Energy Allocation Phase:** Players secretly choose how much energy they’ll spend that turn.  
- **Action Phase:** Players alternate taking one action (move, attack, summon, etc.) until all energy is used.  

**D. Nexus Nodes (Objective)**  
- The grid contains **4 Nexus Nodes** (randomly assigned positions).  
- Controlling a Nexus Node grants buffs or victory points.

### 3. Card Types
1. **Units (Creatures):**  
   - Represent your forces on the battlefield.  
   - Example: *

### Using Rosebud.ai for Game Creation
Rosebud.ai is excellent for generating visuals, characters, and assets. Here’s how we can use it for our game:

#### 1. **Game Visual Identity**
   - **Character Design:** Use Rosebud.ai to create unique and diverse visuals for unit cards like creatures, heroes, and antagonists.
   - **Environment Art:** Generate backgrounds for game boards or card visuals, such as Nexus Node regions or battlefield grids.

#### 2. **Workflow**
   - Create prompts for Rosebud.ai to design:
     - *Unit Cards*: Creatures, warriors, and mages with defined roles.
     - *Spell Cards*: Mystical effects or environmental changes.
     - *Nexus Nodes*: Ancient, glowing artifacts for the game’s objectives.

#### 3. **Example Prompt for Rosebud.ai**
   - "A glowing ancient artifact surrounded by mysterious floating runes, in a misty forest with glowing plants, cinematic lighting."

#### 4. **Game Integration**
   - Incorporate the generated visuals into physical or digital card templates.
   - Use the visuals as inspiration to further define card abilities and game lore.

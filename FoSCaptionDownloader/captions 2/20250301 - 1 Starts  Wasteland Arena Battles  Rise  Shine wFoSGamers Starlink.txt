[00:12:42] apparel this is a very old shirt it's
[00:12:44] probably like 15 years old almost I
[00:12:49] think it was before I had children
[00:12:52] actually so this is an older shirt wow I
[00:12:55] just realize I have all my stuff is like
[00:12:56] really old
[00:13:02] all right well we'll run another
[00:13:04] giveaway we'll see what goes on our
[00:13:06] buddy though that won a guy I need
[00:13:08] number between one and
[00:13:13] 10 it could be they could change like
[00:13:16] their name what is front line let me
[00:13:19] check that out now we to pull a little
[00:13:21] something up let's pull something up
[00:13:23] here front line
[00:13:31] oh no that's not
[00:13:34] it
[00:13:42] clothing front line well it is military
[00:13:45] apparel United States Marine Corp oh I
[00:13:47] wonder if they changed their
[00:13:48] name ah dude I think they changed their
[00:13:51] name to Front Line instead of nine
[00:13:54] line I think this is like one of their
[00:13:56] first shirts before they came there
[00:13:58] because this is literally same type of
[00:13:59] people they it was a US Marine Corps guy
[00:14:01] wandering around when I was at a um a
[00:14:04] concert it was a a country concert we
[00:14:07] were at oh like 15 years ago I kind
[00:14:10] think of the
[00:14:12] name I think it's the same probably it's
[00:14:14] the same company is my guess it's just
[00:14:17] from before they changed their name to
[00:14:21] to to
[00:14:24] that I'm because like look it no see
[00:14:26] that's that's their that's their logo
[00:14:28] I'm guessing they changed it from nine
[00:14:30] line to front line apparel cuz it's it
[00:14:34] looks exactly the same see this is their
[00:14:36] uh whatever it is it's this
[00:14:38] shirt you can read
[00:14:42] it but
[00:14:46] anyways that's I mean there was this was
[00:14:48] years ago so I wonder if they they
[00:14:50] changed their uh Chang their
[00:14:52] name number four all right we going to
[00:14:56] shuffle
[00:14:59] one two three
[00:15:02] four is Storm entity all right it
[00:15:10] guy now the three-pack deals so sorry I
[00:15:14] missed that I completely blanked on it
[00:15:15] so say you wanted three packs of uh
[00:15:17] collector boosters of a of of one set
[00:15:20] what we do is uh we'll take you give you
[00:15:22] a discount on them because you get
[00:15:23] multiple packs at once so like pretty
[00:15:25] much you uh whatnot they charge me you
[00:15:28] know per order so if you get three of
[00:15:31] them in one I take that amount that it
[00:15:33] would be for the charging the extra per
[00:15:35] order take that off of it which is about
[00:15:37] $1 to $2 depending on what you're
[00:15:39] getting so like say it's um you know $3
[00:15:43] for one pack I mean uh no $10 for the
[00:15:46] pack well I might be charged like you
[00:15:48] know a dollar and change so I'll take a
[00:15:50] dollar off if you get three of them
[00:15:52] you'll end up getting you know $2 off
[00:15:55] instead of having because I don't have
[00:15:57] to pay that extra that's kind of what we
[00:15:59] do for the three-pack deal that's why I
[00:16:01] was saying check out the three-pack deal
[00:16:03] so if there's anything that you want let
[00:16:04] me know and we'll run a little
[00:16:06] three-pack deal special for you and just
[00:16:07] change it to three packs on
[00:16:11] screen yeah it's kind of one of those
[00:16:13] things like since they're charging me
[00:16:15] per order if I don't have to do if I
[00:16:17] don't do three orders I'm not getting
[00:16:18] charged three times I might as well pass
[00:16:20] that savings on to you guys you know
[00:16:22] rather than pocketing
[00:16:26] it we got our coffee we're going to hang
[00:16:29] out for a little while this morning and
[00:16:31] what we'll do is we're going to try one
[00:16:32] more of these we'll do another one B

[01:02:42] they ever did that was put the art on
[01:02:43] the back of the tokens all right Bri
[01:02:46] Prime you have to decide now you had you
[01:02:49] hid now do you want to do anything after
[01:02:51] hiding and like maybe attack and do an
[01:02:54] attack in the back or do we want to just
[01:02:55] continue try to hide because we're going
[01:02:56] to have to
[01:03:06] see all right we're going to have you
[01:03:08] just doing some hiding I think that's
[01:03:09] what it was so you hide and you're lucky
[01:03:13] they wander by when they wander
[01:03:16] by they happen to knock up some stuff on
[01:03:19] the
[01:03:20] ground and you were lucky because you
[01:03:23] found
[01:03:26] one two three pogs out of those things
[01:03:29] that they did so you actually have three
[01:03:30] pogs now for
[01:03:32] hiding there you go they were talking
[01:03:35] about finding some stuff and uh
[01:03:37] destroying things and they could
[01:03:39] potentially become allies later because
[01:03:40] they didn't talk about really Haring
[01:03:42] anyone as they wander by they you know
[01:03:44] they were saying you know they were
[01:03:45] going to attack the uh the next thing
[01:03:47] that they come out creature they come
[01:03:48] against they need to take all their
[01:03:51] stuff I
[01:03:53] know yeah that was my fault I definitely
[01:03:55] stopped for that

[01:05:21] at you first do you want to turn and run
[01:05:25] after that
[01:05:26] or are you going to attack back

[01:06:33] it let me get you your
[01:06:36] uh launch
[01:06:41] octo but luckily it's not they don't do

[01:06:47] multiple hits but luckily this time it's
[01:06:48] only one hit that they go after one
[01:06:51] swipe at you so here let's
[01:06:53] see you're getting
[01:06:56] you get five damage oh that was one of

[01:06:59] you five damage that brings you down to
[01:07:02] uh 93 Health cuz you start at 100 Health
[01:07:06] but you shoot back with your
[01:07:08] pistol and oh
[01:07:11] my you missed that swipe at you did not
[01:07:15] help you shoot wildly and you miss
[01:07:18] because you need to hit a a 14 or higher
[01:07:21] and with two with the two extra even on
[01:07:23] the nine from the pistol that does not
[01:07:25] help help you shoot and you wildly

[01:28:55] I like
[01:28:56] it you find some ancient ruins I like it
[01:29:01] in those ancient ruins my
[01:29:04] friend you find some pre-war
[01:29:08] items now some of them are broken now
[01:29:11] there's like a broken uh looks like a
[01:29:14] Gatling gun of some
[01:29:16] kind uh so you find one of those there
[01:29:18] maybe you can uh either trade it or fix
[01:29:21] it up you find one of those then you do
[01:29:24] do find
[01:29:26] also um a what looks like a luck booster
[01:29:30] in there but it's faded in the middle so
[01:29:33] you're not really sure what that is in
[01:29:35] the middle there it's
[01:29:37] faded being faded it doesn't work it
[01:29:40] seems like it needs maybe a charge or
[01:29:42] something I don't
[01:29:47] know what would you like to
[01:29:53] do you're going to take them both and
[01:29:55] investigate them that is a good
[01:29:57] idea you take them both and you roll to
[01:30:02] investigate the uh actually you know
[01:30:05] what we're going to we're going to flip
[01:30:06] the coin to investigate the uh the
[01:30:08] Gatling gun all right here we go zoom
[01:30:14] zoom I'll do that for you buddy my
[01:30:17] friend
[01:30:19] Prime that
[01:30:21] means you're looking at that pre-war
[01:30:23] weapon Gatling gun there and you go you
[01:30:25] know
[01:30:26] what it's just missing a pin in it if I
[01:30:31] can find that
[01:30:33] pin I think we might be able to uh think
[01:30:37] I might be able to fix this and use
[01:30:40] it so you holding on to that one that's
[01:30:43] a good one then you look at the luck
[01:30:45] let's investigate the luck one let's see
[01:30:47] if you can figure out what happens with
[01:30:48] the luck one now you investigate that
[01:30:50] one and it's a 50/50 again
[01:30:55] let's see where that one lands for you
[01:30:57] oh my on heads look at that you're
[01:31:00] investigating and it twinkles a little
[01:31:02] bit that luck and you notice wait a
[01:31:05] minute there's a little flute in
[01:31:07] there ah so it seems like this luck may
[01:31:11] have been uh broken open and you need to

[01:34:18] going to do Oblivion the enemy is a
[01:34:21] small Raider they're coming toward you
[01:34:24] to attack you have no choice because
[01:34:27] they are definitely going to hit you
[01:34:28] they have the they have this surprise
[01:34:33] attack so you have to decide if you're
[01:34:36] going to attack back or if you want to
[01:34:38] run away now they are a 14 to hit being
[01:34:42] a small one you have a plus two for your
[01:34:44] weapons that you use though so any roll
[01:34:47] gets you a little bonus of a plus
[01:34:49] two but they're going to attack first
[01:34:51] with their pistol
[01:34:54] and we're going to see what
[01:34:57] happens oh they hit you and they hit you
[01:35:00] for five my friend Oblivion oh no that
[01:35:04] is not
[01:35:05] good that is not good
[01:35:24] you're now at 95
[01:35:25] Health you do have a pistol and a knife
[01:35:28] though so you decide if you want to
[01:35:31] attack or you want to run
[01:35:35] away all right you're going to shoot two
[01:35:37] I like going to try to shoot at them I
[01:35:39] like it you shoot oh who buddy you got a
[01:35:43] 12 plus that too you got lucky you hit
[01:35:45] the Raider with your pistol and you get
[01:35:49] a five against them nice look at that
[01:35:52] you got some ammo for your pistol and
[01:35:53] some pogs there so you got four pogs and
[01:35:58] some pistol ammo so that brings you
[01:36:00] because they got shot pretty nicely
[01:36:02] there that brings you to uh pistol ammo
[01:36:06] of 12 instead of nine and then your
[01:36:12] uh pogs are
[01:36:15] four nice one my friend we'll run
[01:36:22] another no are not able to fire
[01:36:27] two the one but you have yeah you have
[01:36:30] to have some agility oh okay so what I
[01:36:33] was saying is you don't have agility the
[01:36:34] only way to do two shots is to have
[01:36:37] agility and be having two pistols so you
[01:36:40] can dual wield pistols but you'd have to
[01:36:42] have agility also to be able to do that
[01:36:44] with your dual wielding and hit someone
[01:36:46] all right that's the only way you can do
[01:36:48] two shots at once on one of these but
[01:36:50] you are good you got to get you got to
[01:36:52] hit there let's see who's next prime
[01:36:54] Haven coming out here with the pack I
[01:36:57] like it here we go we're going to see
[01:37:00] what we get
[01:37:05] primes no no quick unless you have

[01:55:12] rifle that means you can unload all of
[01:55:14] your rounds or just a few of them now
[01:55:18] unloading all of them it will become a
[01:55:19] little bit of a crazy weapon and you uh
[01:55:21] kind of just start to shoot all over the
[01:55:22] place so I recommend doing some bursts

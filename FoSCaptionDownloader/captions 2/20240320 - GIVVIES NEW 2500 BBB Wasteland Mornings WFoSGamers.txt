[01:15:24] realized I need to kick my glass glasses
[01:15:25] off to see people see everything and
[01:15:27] here we go for our giveaways up in the
[01:15:28] back there we're going to run another uh
[01:15:31] let's do another
[01:15:33] adventure let's do another adventure
[01:15:35] here with some
[01:15:37] Fallout but we're going to put um we're
[01:15:40] going to go after another Cavern we just
[01:15:42] pulled out a sweet Cavern of souls maybe
[01:15:45] we can pull out another sweet Cavern of
[01:15:53] Souls
[01:15:56] which was crazy because I thought it was
[01:15:58] impossible to really do the first time
[01:15:59] it happened then it happened I was like
[01:16:01] what is this what is this and somebody
[01:16:03] goes you can pull them out of there I'm
[01:16:04] like no you
[01:16:06] can't the adventure game underworld all
[01:16:09] right so the adventure game you pick
[01:16:10] yourself a character as you wander
[01:16:13] through the Wasteland there at the top
[01:16:15] and what happens is in each one of these
[01:16:17] boxes there is a uh there's 78 in the
[01:16:20] red 78 in the green and there's 12 in
[01:16:22] the blue but you get a plus one or minus
[01:16:24] one for your strength on your character
[01:16:26] so this is going to be two and half
[01:16:27] strength on your character which is
[01:16:28] whatever you pick at the top and you
[01:16:30] wander through the Wasteland you pick a
[01:16:31] card you tell me to pick one random and
[01:16:33] we have animated things for your
[01:16:35] adventure as you go through the
[01:16:36] Wasteland it's almost fully animated
[01:16:38] there but then if you don't Lo if you go
[01:16:40] up against the boss at the end you could
[01:16:42] potentially beat the boss and with this
[01:16:44] you can potentially beat three of the
[01:16:45] bosses um of the 10 bosses and uh if you
[01:16:49] do we do a loot pack drop where you come
[01:16:51] out and the boss drops some Loot and
[01:16:53] maybe it's like a collector booster of
[01:16:55] something that gets dropped and it's a
[01:16:56] $1 loot pack for the wastelanders but
[01:16:59] you always get whatever is in the vault
[01:17:01] and like right now the Vault pack
[01:17:03] currently is
[01:17:07] um a pack of cards
[01:17:12] from I don't know there's no date on it
[01:17:16] I think this is like a 98 pack 1998 or
[01:17:19] 96 but anyways these were picked by the
[01:17:22] children there so yeah that's what you
[01:17:24] get there as a Vault pack there just
[01:17:25] something that somebody thought they
[01:17:26] needed to put in a vault in a safe and
[01:17:28] safe that's really what it is
[01:17:31] there t-shirt really you on the give me
[01:17:34] too nice

[01:43:32] not a giant thing I made a medium one I
[01:43:35] fixed my big blue book well I updated it
[01:43:37] actually so like the low currently a
[01:43:40] floor Is A Wasteland that's the floor Is
[01:43:44] A

[02:14:21] bud we like that good
[02:14:30] hit there we go there you are I was
[02:14:33] hoping to have a lot more Fallout but
[02:14:35] they never ended up shipping all of it
[02:14:37] and I'm guessing it's because they
[02:14:40] uh sold
[02:14:42] it and then didn't tell me just waited
[02:14:45] for me to ask the refund so that they
[02:14:47] didn't get in
[02:14:48] trouble so I had to do that actually
[02:14:51] so I think if they don't sip it they get
[02:14:53] in trouble on eBay
[02:14:56] right versus uh
[02:14:59] me canceling an
[02:15:01] order so

[02:45:11] likes food they don't mind what any food
[02:45:13] in the Wasteland that have RADS or not
[02:45:15] you are at one two three strength
[02:45:19] as you wander through this
[02:45:23] Wasteland all right this is 1 2 3 four
[02:45:26] strength as you wander through this
[02:45:27] Wasteland cuz this I said was one and a
[02:45:29] half and I said that was a half so I
[02:45:31] said that's three four strength as you
[02:45:33] wand through the Wasteland I'm sorry I
[02:45:34] needed to remember that yeah four
[02:45:36] strength we're going to do another one
[02:45:37] here we're going to try to grab them all
[02:45:38] here we're going to
[02:45:43] go which one's coming
[02:45:46] down all right I guess we're going to go
[02:45:49] all right we're going to go with one of
[02:45:49] these two cuz none of them wanted to
[02:45:50] come out of my hand we going go with one
[02:45:52] of those two and there we go this is
[02:45:55] what we're going with we got a
[02:45:57] clue a clue for the mutant though a clue
[02:46:01] I believe the clue is
[02:46:03] confusing they get the clue they look at
[02:46:05] that and they I don't understand what
[02:46:06] that is now I have a headache they
[02:46:08] dropped the clue and their food at the
[02:46:10] same time because they were so confused
[02:46:13] now they're back to their three strength
[02:46:14] as they wander through the Wasteland
[02:46:16] hopefully hopefully though
[02:46:19] you can find something that'll help
[02:46:22] you all right let's go keep going
[02:46:27] here and let's
[02:46:30] see we going to go with we're going to
[02:46:32] go with this one right there why
[02:46:34] not as a mutant you look for the fungus
[02:46:37] dinosaur to come and help you in the
[02:46:38] Wasteland you're wandering through and
[02:46:40] oh no an enemy comes by you lose one of
[02:46:44] your strength and you're down only to
[02:46:45] half a one and a half strength as you
[02:46:47] wander through the Wasteland here
[02:46:49] that's no good you can still wander
[02:46:51] through you have enough strength to be
[02:46:52] alive but you're not going to make it to
[02:46:54] beat a boss we'll see what happens maybe
[02:46:55] you don't get beat down big but we'll
[02:46:57] see what happens here you said random
[02:46:59] for them all and being 10 cards we'll
[02:47:01] just open them up and see which one's
[02:47:02] here which one are we going to go with
[02:47:05] this one seems to be hiding the most so
[02:47:07] maybe that means it's scared of the
[02:47:08] mutant maybe that means you're going to
[02:47:10] have a
[02:47:11] chance let's
[02:47:13] see oh
[02:47:15] no you are wandering towards a vault and
[02:47:18] out of no
[02:47:19] where you have dinosaurs on a spaceship
[02:47:23] come trampling through as a
[02:47:25] Triceratops crushing your legs you crawl
[02:47:28] into the Vault with no legs but in the
[02:47:30] vault in the distance you go maybe that
[02:47:32] will help me it's a it's oh it's just a
[02:47:34] pack of cards well they thought this was
[02:47:37] ex something needed to be kept from
[02:47:39] 1991 some type of uh baseball wacky bats
[02:47:43] cards and that is what you get from the
[02:47:46] Vault there for the vault pack so we're
[02:47:48] going to rip these open generally redo

[02:58:48] I am down
[02:58:49] to 14 packs of Fallout left 14 packs of
[02:58:55] Fallout left for you all for those that
[02:58:58] want it that's what I'm down to we'll
[02:59:00] put up another one here
[02:59:02] though we'll put that one up
[02:59:05] here and you know what we'll do now the
[02:59:08] big blue book is what I was going over
[02:59:10] that's what it was you asked the
[02:59:11] question of the Big Blue Book I'm sorry
[02:59:13] I knew I had a mistake there now those
[02:59:16] of you that want to know what the big
[02:59:17] blue book is is pionic badge this is the
[02:59:22] ceiling is $99 you have 81 spots it's
[02:59:24] actually down to 80 spots now because we
[02:59:26] had somebody go at it already and what
[02:59:28] happens
[02:59:29] is we spin the wheel we see where you
[02:59:32] land and now maybe it's like you land on
[02:59:34] number seven which is a forcing negation
[02:59:36] maybe land on number uh four which is a
[02:59:38] packed negation but you get also a uh uh
[02:59:41] uh a mystery
[02:59:43] booster or maybe you are the lucky one
[02:59:46] that ends up landing on B B's tomb you
[02:59:49] know and get that balin's tomb there or
[02:59:52] maybe you're the lucky one you land on
[02:59:53] the soul ring and get the soul ring and
[02:59:56] that is what it is we spin the wheel you
[02:59:59] get whatever is in that spot so say you
[03:00:01] got this sunken sunbit Canyon you'd come
[03:00:03] out with a collector booster of um
[03:00:07] adventures and Forgotten Realms
[03:00:08] collector booster in a mystery box uh
[03:00:10] pack and that's how the the Blue Book
[03:00:12] works there is you get whatever is at
[03:00:15] your number
[03:00:16] there so uh hopefully that made some
[03:00:19] sense to you and um I got you on that if
[03:00:21] I didn't I sorry if I didn't get that in
[03:00:29] time let me uh just type that in there
[03:00:35] at
[03:00:38] cryic
[03:00:41] badge let me know what you
[03:00:44] think of the BBB B Bo up
[03:00:48] all right you're good you can hear me
[03:00:49] okay I don't know if you could hear me
[03:00:51] sometimes people can't hear me I just
[03:00:52] want to make sure so yeah that's what it
[03:00:54] is
[03:00:55] there and I will put up another um I'll
[03:00:59] put up another adventure game for those
[03:01:01] that may want to try it with uh some of
[03:01:03] my last my Fallout here like I said I
[03:01:06] don't have much of it left
[03:01:07] sadly sadly I do not have much of it
[03:01:10] left and I am not getting any more
[03:01:12] unless they come out with something
[03:01:13] different I am not get anymore and we're
[03:01:14] going with this
[03:01:16] here
[03:01:18] yeah it's kind of cool you get uh you
[03:01:19] get to see the thing that I like about
[03:01:21] it is you get to see everything in it
[03:01:24] all right there's no way you're not
[03:01:25] going to know what's in here I literally
[03:01:26] have the book you see every single card
[03:01:28] in here and everything that is
[03:01:30] associated with the card if it is not a
[03:01:32] if it is not a ceiling so for instance
[03:01:34] your floor right now is a wasteland $22
[03:01:38] is the floor and that is a wasteland as
[03:01:40] the floor so that's what I'm saying you
[03:01:41] get really good cards here as even a
[03:01:43] floor so your floor here is a soul ring
[03:01:48] I mean not a that's not a flooor that's
[03:01:49] a that's a not a floor there you can get
[03:01:51] a soul ring but you can get a ristic
[03:01:53] study but your your floor here where was
[03:01:55] it I'm sorry that wasn't the floor
[03:01:57] where' my floor
[03:01:58] go this is one of your floors is a
[03:02:01] temple Garden I'm sorry it was on the
[03:02:02] wrong page Temple Garden that's a floor
[03:02:04] I mean that's really good or maybe you
[03:02:06] want that Tom bombal uh art there or
[03:02:09] maybe you get like t-rex with a Mystery
[03:02:12] Pack on top of it I mean that's a pretty
[03:02:14] good deal for having that big blue book
[03:02:15] there and that's $2,500 worth of stuff
[03:02:18] it's actually a little bit over 2500 but

[05:19:24] price
[05:19:26] but I don't
[05:19:28] know $70 is not the price for me at the
[05:19:31] moment I will say that one I think I'm
[05:19:34] lucky guy dude I know I got some luck
[05:19:35] for these that's why I keep saying we
[05:19:37] got one pack left here I feel like
[05:19:40] there's something Lucky in there I can't
[05:19:41] guarantee it obviously I can't guarantee
[05:19:43] it but I feel like there's something
[05:19:44] Lucky in there all right you know what I
[05:19:46] think I'm going to do a giveaway from
[05:19:49] what we just opened here the pack we
[05:19:50] just opened I think that's what I'll do
[05:19:52] I'll give away something from this pack
[05:19:54] we just opened I am not giving away the
[05:19:56] agility bobblehead don't try
[05:19:59] it all the packs have been great today I
[05:20:01] know that's what I mean like we've been
[05:20:03] on some really good luck today and that
[05:20:05] doesn't happen too frequently that
[05:20:07] doesn't happen too frequently where you
[05:20:08] get that Insane luck so here we'll do
[05:20:12] this Sentinel Sarah I'll put these up
[05:20:15] here all right and I think what I'll do
[05:20:19] is um I think you know what let's put
[05:20:22] a let's do this
[05:20:33] actually let's put the mirock queen up
[05:20:36] there all right say thank you for
[05:20:38] hanging out that's a $3 card by the
[05:20:41] way $3 card right there just to say hey
[05:20:45] thank you for hanging out with us that's
[05:20:47] going to be the giveaway that's going to
[05:20:48] go up there in a
[05:20:50] minute that's what I'm going to do I'm
[05:20:51] going to put that Mir loock Queen up
[05:20:53] there Mir lurk Mir lur
[05:20:57] Queen I know we've had some really good
[05:20:59] luck and I just hope we can uh get some
[05:21:00] more you know I I really I really think
[05:21:03] there's a monoc crypt in this box or a
[05:21:06] Jurassic Park card um but no one's
[05:21:10] really going after it so that's okay I
[05:21:13] know it's a high it's sadly I couldn't
[05:21:15] get these at cheaper price that was one
[05:21:16] of the things that frustrated me I tried
[05:21:18] to get these cheaper and I could not get
[05:21:21] them cheaper than I found them that was
[05:21:22] the cheapest I was able to find them and
[05:21:23] I was really ticking me off CU I was
[05:21:25] like I should have bought cases of these
[05:21:27] a while ago but then I would have ended
[05:21:29] up selling them out anyways and I would
[05:21:30] have been in the same position so that's
[05:21:32] like the sit my my wife goes you would
[05:21:33] have just sold them anyways I'm like
[05:21:35] yeah that's a good point I would have
[05:21:36] just ended up selling him anyways so I
[05:21:38] would have been and I would have been in
[05:21:39] the same place so let's put this up here
[05:21:42] for
[05:21:43] these two packs here all right those two
[05:21:47] packs
[05:21:50] there and then I think I'll put up a
[05:21:52] mirock queen mirer Queen for a uh a
[05:21:56] little giveaway here in a little bit
[05:21:58] here that's what's the uh that's what
[05:21:59] the card up by our car works
[05:22:02] is and remember we do have the big blue
[05:22:05] book up the Big Blue Book does anybody
[05:22:07] want to do like multiple spins from the
[05:22:09] big blue
[05:22:10] book should we do like a multi-
[05:22:14] spin maybe maybe instead of instead of
[05:22:19] just one
[05:22:25] spin hey you know that's what happens
[05:22:28] that's why you need to have the separate
[05:22:29] account so the wife knows the wife never
[05:22:32] knows what you're
[05:22:33] doing that's why you need the separate
[05:22:35] account for that you can do whatever you
[05:22:37] want and get away with it
[05:22:39] well kind of get away with it it really
[05:22:40] depends on what you consider getting
[05:22:42] away with it I guess cuz she's going to
[05:22:44] find out at the
[05:22:46] end I know my luck right now it
[05:22:49] is I know my luck right I can't
[05:22:51] guarantee my luck is going to always go
[05:22:53] but my luck at the moment it's going
[05:22:54] pretty good that's all I'm going to say
[05:22:56] it's one of those days where it's like
[05:22:57] I'm on a roll and I almost was going to
[05:22:58] get off earlier but I didn't just
[05:23:00] because the luck kept going in here so
[05:23:03] what I'm going to do
[05:23:04] here I am going to
[05:23:06] do I going to do this actually I'm going
[05:23:10] to do an auction
[05:23:11] for we're going to call it
[05:23:14] three BBB
[05:23:18] spins all right and we're going to call
[05:23:20] that instead of
[05:23:24] 78 I think that's
[05:23:29] 90 so of
[05:23:31] 81 that's what it'll call it is 78
[05:23:33] that's what I say no you know what we're
[05:23:34] going to call it
[05:23:36] 77 we're going to put we're going to put
[05:23:39] three of those up
[05:23:45] here and we're going to go these are
[05:23:54] all
[05:23:58] that and then do this all right we're
[05:24:02] going to do three big blue book
[05:24:06] spins here you go three big blue book
[05:24:09] spins now for you all that do not know
[05:24:12] the big blue book we are now down I
[05:24:13] think at 77 spots there was $2500 worth
[05:24:17] of stuff in here floor is $22 ceiling is
[05:24:20] $100 well $99 average is about 30 it's
[05:24:24] $3 $30.90 so it was $31 the price per
[05:24:28] poll is $27 normally per poll but right
[05:24:31] now because you're doing three we
[05:24:32] dropped it down a little bit and gave
[05:24:34] you dropped five bucks off to give you
[05:24:36] it um as 77 now what happens is get the
[05:24:38] number here in the spin maybe you get a
[05:24:40] force of negation nice hit but if you
[05:24:42] don't say you get this you also get this
[05:24:45] card plus a collector booster of AFR and
[05:24:47] LCI draft so all of these spins your
[05:24:51] floor is like a wasteland this is what
[05:24:53] your floor is these that's the type of
[05:24:56] thing that a floor is now your ceiling
[05:24:59] or maybe you want that soul ring there
[05:25:01] that's not that's one of the ceilings
[05:25:03] but your floor is a barrow Downs is a
[05:25:06] floor so that's what I'm trying to show
[05:25:08] you got all kinds of good stuff maybe
[05:25:09] you want a ristic
[05:25:11] study maybe you want that balin's
[05:25:14] tomb I don't know maybe you want that
[05:25:16] Temple Garden foil but see like this you
[05:25:19] get a galta and you get a draft pack of
[05:25:22] cards on top of it so that was a three
[05:25:25] pack of those let's try to get through
[05:25:27] through those there those are pretty
[05:25:29] good there good one well maybe maybe
[05:25:32] that's a Friday thing maybe that's a
[05:25:34] Friday thing you know that's a big
[05:25:36] hitter uh for a random Wednesday okay so

[05:55:58] I'd say I don't think that was a whammy
[05:56:00] I that wasn't a that wasn't a big hit
[05:56:02] but I don't think it was a
[05:56:05] whammy dark steel monolith and song of
[05:56:07] the dryads is pretty good there and then
[05:56:09] your spectator seating with your pure

[05:56:14] but it wasn't it wasn't a big hit it was
[05:56:17] a nice pack it was definitely a nice
[05:56:19] pack I'd be I'd be pretty happy with
[05:56:22] that one especially for one of the uh
[05:56:24] for those type these ones here old mogs
[05:56:27] Crusher I feel like that's something
[05:56:29] special there I'm going to do this
[05:56:30] anyways just in case just in case and
[05:56:32] I'm going to double check that later I'm
[05:56:34] going to double check that one later but
[05:56:36] I'm going to put these other ones in top
[05:56:37] loaders for you cuz I feel like uh I
[05:56:39] Remember Song of the dryad was a high
[05:56:41] one at one
[05:56:45] point with the new MTG they are all
[05:56:47] whammies I know some of them they are
[05:56:49] all whammies the new stuff definitely
[05:56:51] yeah I have um I like I normally buy
[05:56:54] like a case of
[05:56:56] um of collector boosters and like draft
[05:57:00] boosters or set boosters but um since
[05:57:03] the play boosters and the new stuff came
[05:57:06] I bought a case of murders and I'm not
[05:57:08] buying a case of uh Thunder um brokeback
[05:57:11] I mean under Thunder whatever that
[05:57:13] Thunder whatever the Thunder Mountain
[05:57:15] one is the Outlaws at Thunder Mountain
[05:57:17] um I'm not going to be I only bought
[05:57:19] three of those I do not buy
[05:57:22] um I've only bought three of those and
[05:57:24] one of the play boosters so we'll see
[05:57:26] what
[05:57:27] happens we'll see what happens they
[05:57:29] might be good and if they are then I can
[05:57:30] hopefully go back and grab some more if
[05:57:33] not then that's what I'll be stuck with
[05:57:35] right
[05:57:40] see the thing is though being a new
[05:57:41] universe like the First new universe in
[05:57:43] years that's the only reason I almost
[05:57:44] wanted to buy more but and I'm a I like
[05:57:47] Western so I don't know I'm debating on
[05:57:51] buying
[05:57:52] more but it really depends on what goes
[05:57:54] on you
[05:57:55] know depends on how it sells I might end
[05:57:58] up buying some more if it sells all
[05:57:59] right there you go the real renie thank
[05:58:02] you my friend the real
[05:58:05] renie

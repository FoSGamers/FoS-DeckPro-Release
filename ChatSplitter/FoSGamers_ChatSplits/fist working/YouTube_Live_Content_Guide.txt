I need a new live title for One at Night, where I am handing out the commons and uncommons from the break from the day, but also I got a new delivery, so a little bit of a preview of what will be in the break for tomorrow, and maybe somebody wants to jump in and buy some of it now right away to break open while I'm handing everything out, and yeah, I got some new budget-friendly packs, and some more Commander Masters set and draft. I'm still looking for collectors of them. They don't need to know that. Well, why not? Let them know that. That could be in the description, but I need all the information for that. I need all that description and a title for One at Night, and ensure you do everything correctly with all the correct information that I normally request to being alive. Do not be lazy. Do it right. Use the internet to search and figure out things, if you need to, to ensure that you have spellings of everything correct.

New Break Preview should be before handing out comments and uncomments in the title. And then also for the hashtags, whenever it is a live, there should always be hashtag live, hashtag live stream, hashtag always, but any of them should be pack openings, hashtag pack openings, hashtag opening, hashtag packs, and anything else that would make more traffic come due to what people would be following due to them being a magic or a pack opening, craft packing follower type thing.

In the night shows where we are doing the handing out of the commons and uncommons, we don't do giveaways. That way it's not just pulling people in that just hang out to get giveaways. All we're doing is it mainly for the people that come in to hang out with us on a regular basis. That way they can see, one, their stuff they're getting for commons and uncommons, and two, if they want to jump in and like purchase a pack of something, they could do that too.

[2024-09-10 13:11:14] ChatGPT:
User does not do giveaways during the night shows where commons and uncommons are handed out. These streams are focused on regular viewers who come to hang out, see what they are receiving, and potentially purchase packs.

You need a short for opening a CMDR Masters draft booster pack. And the big card that we pull out of it is one of the borderless soul rings, like the cool art one. I think it's borderless, or this is what it is. Either way, I think you go, or it could be like a frame rate thing. I'm not exactly sure. I need you to go and check, figure out the right name. Pretty sure it's borderless. It's the one that's the colored ones. And make me a title for the short and a description like I always need, based off of all the information I told you here in the chat.

[2024-09-10 17:57:46] ChatGPT:

I need a new live for my morning, and, uh, title, a description, and a, also, whatnot, show notes. Um, I'm going to, I have new secret lair in for Dungeons and Dragons, um, the special anniversary one. I searched the internet to figure out what those are exactly. Then, I also have, um, new stock in, also. So, my plan is to do a budget break with the Dungeons and Dragons, since we have new stuff in. And I also have, um, in my card display, my pack displays, I have one whole column is now a mystery one. All the packs will be, they're going to, it's $6, but it's just packs that are worth $6 to $7. And, uh, that's what you're going to be getting out of there, and it's just random mystery. So, if you would pick one, I just pull whatever the next one is out, or how many of them you want pulled out. And they'll be from a certain set, um, I will be able to tell them, too. Um, so you can make a, a, whatnot item, this title and description for that one. Um, the packs that will be in there will be Infinity, Outlaws of Thunder Junction, um, these are drafts, or play boosters. Um, there will be Ikoria, there is Dungeons and Dragons, Adventures of Forgotten Realms, I think it is. Um, then there's, um, um, Brothers War, maybe? There is Murders at Karlov Manor, and if I need to, I'll tell you any more to add in that, for that item. Um, and you can make an item description, title and description also for, um, the Dungeons and Dragons budget break. Um, where one of the Dungeons and Dragons, we'll have mini breaks, there will be multiple mini breaks I'll be doing, but just make it for one, and I'll just, I'll just create it again if we finish it. But it'll be, um, we'll call it the Dungeons and Dragons Secret Lair Mini Breaks. Um, and there will only be six spots for each one of those. So do that as another item in a description, and generate something like that. It'll be a budget-based one. Um, have that all in the description for the show, the description on the whatnot notes, generate a title for the live, and, um, go from there.

[2024-09-11 11:43:21] FoSGamers:
what are the break rules

[2024-09-11 11:43:40] ChatGPT:
Based on the information you’ve shared with me before, here’s how you typically handle your breaks:

---

### **FoSGamers Break Rules:**
1. **Spots are Limited**: Each break has a set number of spots available (e.g., 6 spots for a mini break). Participants can purchase one or multiple spots.
   
2. **Card Distribution**: Cards from the break (e.g., booster packs, special sets) are randomized and distributed equally among participants.

3. **Order of Participation**: Participants receive cards in the order their spots were purchased, ensuring fairness.

4. **Fairness and Transparency**: All cards, whether rare or common, are distributed evenly so that no one leaves empty-handed.

5. **Live Stream Breaks**: Breaks happen live during your stream, and participants can watch as the cards are pulled and distributed.

6. **Shipping Included**: Shipping is provided for all break participants, ensuring they receive their cards after the break.

---

These break rules are tailored to how you’ve instructed breaks to be handled in the past. Let me know if you want to refine or add any specific details!

[2024-09-11 11:44:19] FoSGamers:
what are the specifics of the card distribution actions

[2024-09-11 11:44:43] ChatGPT:
Here’s a detailed breakdown of the **specific card distribution actions** you use for your breaks:

---

### **FoSGamers Card Distribution Process:**

1. **Card Selection from Packs**: After opening the packs during the break, you pull out the Mythics, Rares, and cards that are valued over a set threshold (usually $3 or more). These are separated from the Commons and Uncommons.

2. **Randomization of High-Value Cards**: All the selected high-value cards (Mythics, Rares, and others) are shuffled thoroughly to ensure randomness.

3. **Equal Distribution**: Each participant in the break receives an equal number of cards. For example, if there are 6 spots in the break, and 12 high-value cards, each participant gets 2 cards.

4. **Order of Distribution**: Cards are handed out in the order of who purchased their spot first. For example, if Participant A purchased their spot before Participant B, A will receive their two cards first.

5. **Commons and Uncommons**: These lower-value cards are typically handled separately, either off-screen or during another recorded session. They may be given away or distributed in bulk to participants in a different way.

6. **Live Interaction**: Participants can watch the break live as the cards are pulled and distributed, adding to the excitement and transparency of the process.

7. **Shipping to Participants**: Once the break is complete, all cards are packaged and shipped to the respective participants. Shipping is included as part of the break.

---

This system ensures fairness, transparency, and excitement for all participants, and gives everyone a chance to receive valuable cards from the break. Let me know if you'd like to add or modify any steps!

[2024-09-11 11:45:14] FoSGamers:

[2024-09-11 13:32:15] FoSGamers:
The reason why you go is the order of who purchased first is to make sure that whoever the first person is will get the most out of all the cards if it happens to be one more card than everyone else because they were the first one to purchase and jump in. That is the only way that I found it to be fair and that's the way I reason why I do it as an order of who purchased is when everything gets handed out so that if it was you know there was 10 people that were in and eight of them were going to get an extra card and two of them were going to get one less card it would be because those two were the last two to be in there. That's just an example but yeah you can figure that out put that in there update the rules and everything to make sure it's showing it correctly and effectively.

[2024-09-11 13:33:15] ChatGPT:
The reason for distributing cards in the order of who purchased first is to ensure that if there is an extra card, the first person to purchase gets it. This way, if the number of high-value cards doesn't divide evenly, the first participants get more cards, and the later participants get slightly fewer, ensuring fairness based on order of entry.

Also have it be, if we have a lot of people in there to the end of the stream, hanging out with us, the more that we have in there until I actually get off the end to go to raid into someone else. If we can raid in, start so that we can raid in with, say, a certain amount of people. Say we can have, um, 30 people we can raid into somebody's stream with, I'll give away a pack of cards. That means we'd have to have 30 people in the stream hanging out with me at that time. Um, I mean, people can buy packs of cards, too, while they're in there, while I'm sorting the other stuff. It doesn't mean they can't. So they can still buy packs of cards while I'm sorting. I'm just not going to be doing any more giveaways or anything like that. That's why I say it's the end of the stream giveaway, because I'm done doing giveaways, and the people that are like the, quote-unquote, Gibby Goblins, you don't need to say that in there, but, you know, I mean, that's what I'm trying to get across. That way you can all leave, and that way it's only the people that want to hang out, chat, um, possibly buy stuff from me, versus the people that are in there just to try to get giveaways. Um, so that's why I want to do it that way for the end of the stream. And then at the end of the stream is when I'll probably do the, um, the actual buyer's giveaway. Um, that, and I'll try to get it so that we have, um, an actual buyer's giveaway done, and that way it's done. And I'll generally do the buyer's giveaway, we'll say, um, it'll be anyways between 10 and 30 seconds at the most. That way, um, everybody that's in there hanging out as a buyer can get in on it quick to have the chance of getting in what's up there for the giveaway. And then, um, what we'll do is, you know what, the giveaway will last no more than a minute for the buyer's giveaway. That way, I can show the pack off, um, and not so they know, but just so you know, it'll be short enough that it'll be within a short time frame to be able to do a video of for a giveaway. Like showing that I do giveaways and things like that. But that'll be the last thing I do for each stream. If we can have 30 people or more, if we have, um, 50 people or more, uh, we'll spice it up to being a, um, instead of like a, like a, we'll spice it up in some way, shape, or form. Um, if we get 50 more to rate into somebody and if we get even more than that, we'll figure it out when we, when we get there. But if we can also put in there, if we can get 50 people to save our shows, the end of stream giveaway will be, um, at least a mid-value to high-value pack.

User wants to run an end-of-stream event where, if there are 30 or more people in the stream, they will give away a pack of cards before raiding into someone else's stream. If 50 or more people are present, the giveaway will be for a mid- to high-value pack. While sorting and distributing cards at the end of the stream, people can still buy packs, but no further general giveaways will occur except for the buyer’s giveaway. The buyer's giveaway will last for no more than a minute, allowing time for a quick video showing that giveaways are part of the stream.

```

---

### **YouTube Live Description**:
```
Welcome to Rise & Shine w/FoSGamers! Today, we’re kicking off with a Dungeons & Dragons budget break, followed by building our High Roller custom break with help from the community. The High Roller break will feature premium packs like Fallout Secret Lair, Dungeons & Dragons Secret Lair, Commander Masters, and Modern Horizons 2 or 3.

For both breaks, Mythics, Rares, and any cards valued over $3 will be pulled out, shuffled, and randomly distributed. Each participant will receive an equal number of high-value cards wherever possible, but if there’s an extra card, it will go to the first person who purchased their spot to ensure fairness. Commons and Uncommons will be distributed at the end of the stream after the end-of-stream giveaway. Stick around and chat while we finish distributing!

If we get 30 or more people hanging out with us until the end of the stream, we'll give away a pack of cards! If we hit 50 or more people, we’ll spice it up and give away a mid- to high-value pack.

Giveaways happen every 5 minutes—don’t miss your chance to win amazing cards!

Here’s the **image description** for the thumbnail for your upcoming live:

---

```
The text "Rise & Shine w/FoSGamers" should be centered at the top in bold, vibrant font. Below, in large, clear text, include "Dungeons & Dragons Mini Budget Break + Game Return!" The design should emphasize the excitement of both the budget break and the return of the fan-favorite game.

Surround the text with images of Magic: The Gathering booster packs, specifically featuring Dungeons & Dragons Secret Lair cards. Include visual elements from previous FoSGamers games, possibly a reference to Bloomburrow or another returning game.

The color palette should be fantasy-themed, with vibrant hues of blues, purples, and reds to create an exciting and adventurous atmosphere. The background should feature magical elements like enchanted forests or mystical symbols to match the theme of Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons & Dragons.

Ensure all elements are balanced and the text remains legible and eye-catching. The image should convey the sense of community engagement and fun that comes with the live event.

I need a title for a YouTube video that is a regular video, regular-sized video that would be on a TV screen or inside, you know, horizontal, not vertical. I need a video for that title in which my family and I open up a Bloombro collector booster box to see what we get for luck, and we pull out a raised foil. They'll have to watch it to see what we get, but it's a fun one, and they'll be excited to see what we get. We get a lot of good cards, and I think they'll be excited to see what we get here. Hopefully they stay tuned, check us out, and have a good one. So generate me a title, a description for this video. Make sure you put most of the regular stuff I have in there for the description also.

Um, I need you to go and get the livestream that I was talking about doing for the morning, for the Rise and Shine one, where we're going to do a, um, another one of the mini Dungeons and Dragons breaks, and I said we were also going to be doing, um, uh, one of Return of the Games, one of our favorite game returns, um, and where I said I was going to, um, also have us, uh, do our poll for a higher, if we're going to do a poll for a high roller one or another budget one. What I plan on doing instead is, instead of the budget high roller poll, we're going to do another biggest loser break instead. So, we're going to have the budget break, we're going to have a biggest loser break, and we're going to have a, um, Return of an Old Game. Now, the biggest loser break will be with a Modern Horizon 3 Commander Deck. So, build, um, a YouTube live title, a YouTube live description, a what not show notes, a what not item title and description for everything that is needed.

I have a live that we'll be doing at night. Since I had a soccer game in the morning for my children, I didn't even do my regular morning show, so it is turning to be the night one. What I'll end up doing is finishing off the Biggest Loser break. There's only 9 o'clock left. And also, being an evening show, we will do some...

Depending on what's going on, maybe I'll start the game while I have this live stream running. That way we can have some people watching and be able to watch and participate. I can have it up in the corner, like, whose turn it is type thing. Ooh, I might do that. Instead of my face, what I'll have is... We'll do tournament night, where we'll be opening packs of stuff and stuff like that. I'll be opening the break. Or game night. I'll see if we can get a game going and see how many people want to play. We'll start one up on spell table and get it to play. That will be kind of the goal for the night. Then I'll put the play game in my place for the visuals, so people can see everything being played. In place of my head. We'll finish building my deck to play the game. Depending on the time of night, we'll play either right at night, if we have enough people to get in a little tournament.

Game Night is supposed to be one of the features that are primary features here. It's more Game Night than it is the Biggest Loser stuff. We're finishing the Biggest Loser than it is... You don't necessarily need the Fallout D&D game coming in there. You can put that in the description. But you can have something like Gibby every five minutes, or Gibby's in the titles. You don't need to have everything, I think, every five minutes. That can be in the description. But I do need to have in the title, though, specifically saying Game Night. Well, you know what? Just do Game Night hosted by FOS Gamers, and then the rest of the other stuff after it to show what we're going to be doing the other things.

That would be a good way of doing that. And then also have it in there for the, um, the return of an old game, or return of an original game, um, you know, the D&D style game, whatever you want to do with it. But make sure that's, you can figure out how to do it within the hundred characters of the title, where the primary thing is game night, uh, as you have it set up, then it is the finishing lit break, is, uh, the new, the return of a game, and the giveaways, and put giveaways, though, as the first thing after game night stuff.

Remove the second giveaway in the title. It should only be in there once with the Build the Giveaway. After that, the title should have, um, Completing Biggest Looter, Loser Break, um, and Original Game Return, as long as that will fit within the hundred, um, characters for a YouTube title.

Make sure that we know for game night in the description, one of the primary things being described is the fact that we're doing game night, which we're going to try to get a small tournament going of hopefully eight people. If not, we'll just do a game of, you know, four people, you know, a commander game. We're playing commander, so we'll do a commander game of however many people we can, but if we can get eight people, we'll do a miniature tournament where I will have prizes for the top three players. It may not be big prizes, but it'll be something a little fun, especially since the people that come in and play and buy and hang out with us on a regular basis.

Generate an image description for this thumbnail.

[2024-09-14 09:55:03] ChatGPT:
For your **thumbnail image description**, here’s a detailed breakdown:

---

**Image Description**:

Center the text: "Game Night Hosted by FoSGamers" at the top of the image in bold, eye-catching font. Below that, in slightly smaller text, write: "Build the Giveaway + Biggest Loser Break + Wasteland Fallout Game". Include vibrant, fantasy-themed colors to evoke the atmosphere of Magic: The Gathering, using warm tones like orange and red. Surround the main text with images of Commander Magic cards, Set and Play Boosters, and a Collector Booster box of Bloomburrow to visually hint at giveaways and the break. For an exciting touch, add subtle highlights or glow effects around the words "Build the Giveaway" to emphasize interaction. 

In the bottom right, include the FoSGamers logo or branding to keep the stream’s identity visible. In the background, use a mix of fantasy-themed artwork with Commander cards, featuring vivid landscapes and characters, along with a fallout-esque wasteland scene to hint at the Wasteland Fallout game.

This description ensures the key event details are visually represented while keeping the focus on the giveaways, game night, and the breaks.

**Image Description**:

Center the text "Game Night Hosted by FoSGamers" at the top of the image in bold, clear font. Below it, add the text "Build the Giveaway + Biggest Loser Break + Wasteland Fallout Game" in a slightly smaller size. Use a fantasy-themed color palette, featuring warm tones like orange and red to evoke the atmosphere of Magic: The Gathering.

Surround the text with visuals of Commander Magic cards, Play Boosters, Set Boosters, and a Bloomburrow Collector Booster box to represent the giveaways and breaks. Add a slight glow around the words "Build the Giveaway" to draw attention. In the bottom right corner, include the FoSGamers logo for branding.

The background should feature a mix of vibrant fantasy artwork from Magic: The Gathering, blended with a fallout-style wasteland scene to reference the Wasteland Fallout game. Incorporate mystical landscapes and characters to match the theme of the stream.

[2024-09-14 13:20:18] FoSGamers:
So try, uh, find something that adds to the title, like, um, Crazy in the front, or Insane. We don't want to use Epic, since I always use the last one. But, uh, like, Crazy, Insane, Awesome, Super, Ridiculous, whatever. Use the internet, find a good word to do that with, and put it there. That way it'll draw attention to it for me.

I have a new live that we're doing in the morning, one of the morning lives, where we'll be finishing our Bayes Loser break from yesterday, from the day before, actually. And if we don't finish that, I'll ping the people that were there and see what they want to do. The next thing is, I'll be building my commander deck for the game tonight, so we'll be doing a game night tonight, so make sure people are aware of that. Try to get some people to join. I wanted to do it last night, but maybe we'll do a short one tonight. But right now, it's the morning show. We're trying to finish the break. I'm going to be finishing building my deck. We do giveaways. We do our giveaways every five minutes. And we have some singles to go through, I guess, too. I'll try to organize as we go through. I guess we'll have a little bit of singles for Saturday. We'll move on with our break as we build. We can look through singles as we build. I'm going to finish building my deck and see if they find any singles that they need that I don't want. We'll throw them out there for people to buy. I have to finish opening my Alpha Sorcery deck box. That's something I'm going to do also. We'll call it maybe trade day. Part of it will be trading day because if people pull stuff that I need for a deck, maybe I'll be offering them a trade. And we will go from there. Let's see what else we have going on.

Trade day should be first. Trade day and single deck. And singles. Not single sale. Or just singles for sale. And maybe put trade day as one of the first things in the title after the rising sign stuff.

Now search the internet and see if I should put it as Trade Day or Trading Day, and figure out the best title and description that we use on the internet that you can figure out in a lossle with hashtags, and generate all of them for me.

[2024-09-15 05:46:52] ChatGPT:
Based on my research, it seems that "Trade Day" is more commonly used for events that focus on exchanging or selling items, especially in informal or community settings like trading cards or collectibles. "Trading Day," on the other hand, is more closely associated with financial markets or professional trading activities. 

For your live stream involving trading cards, "Trade Day" fits better with the casual and community-focused vibe of your event. Using this terminology will align with how similar events are branded online and will resonate better with your audience who are familiar with card trading and Magic: The Gathering culture.

Here’s the final version of your **YouTube Live Title**, **Description**, and **Whatnot Show Notes**, optimized with attention-grabbing elements and relevant hashtags:

Hashtag giveaway Hashtag givvy spelled g-i-v-v-y Should be in the hashtags We should also remove biggest loser break And Probably commander deck build I don't think we need sorcery alpha. We could put just sorcery instead And try to have it so it's 13 or less on the Hashtags because I guess and usually you're searching the internet to figure out how many hashtags are best to have in a short In the description to make it so that it is found and YouTube doesn't ignore them

[2024-09-15 05:56:15] ChatGPT:
Here’s a **Leonardo.ai image description** for the thumbnail of your live show, optimized to be under **1,480 characters**:

---

```
Center the title "Trade Day & Build the Giveaway" at the top of the image in bold, clear font. Directly underneath, in a slightly smaller font, include the text "Biggest Loser Break + Commander Deck Build." Use a fantasy-themed color palette to reflect the theme of Magic: The Gathering, with vibrant hues like red, gold, and dark green.

Around the text, include visuals of Magic: The Gathering cards, with a special emphasis on singles and boosters. Show an opened Sorcery Alpha Booster Box in the background, partially spilling out its cards. Add card art from Sorcery and Magic: The Gathering to emphasize the different events happening during the stream.

Place the text "Giveaways Every 5 Minutes" as a banner along the bottom of the image in a vibrant color to draw attention. Include a glowing effect around the word "Giveaways" to make it pop. Ensure that all the text is centered and stands out clearly against the background, using soft gradients and shadows.

Incorporate subtle effects of trading card icons in the corners, highlighting cards or decks to symbolize trading and deck-building activities. Make sure the colors are bold and the design is clean, keeping the image engaging but not overcrowded. The FoSGamers logo should be placed in the lower right corner for branding, ensuring it’s visible but not overpowering the main content.

I need a live title for the morning where I will be doing a, uh, where I'll be doing singles, doing some single sales. Um, I will also be, um, finishing building my Nazgul neck, deck. And then, um, I have the Adventure game that has come back. So, um, we can use that, like the Wasteland Adventure one, use that as, uh, maybe a focal point of some stuff to do since, um, it's been kind of slow on things. And, uh, when it's slow, at least, uh, that contains some entertainment. Um. And I will, um, update you further if I think of anything else to do. Trying to think if there's something else that we can do good for tomorrow. Maybe build our next Adventure game? Ah, that's what we do. We have the return, the original one, the first one, one of the first ones that we had, which was the, um, Fallout game. So people can use it. And then here we'll have a return of the, um, we'll have, we'll have to return with that, we can play that if people want to. But also, we'll, um, we'll offer for people to, uh, help design or think of our, our next Adventure game that will be similar. Um, and I think that's the only thing I can think of right now.

```
Center the title "Rise & Shine w/FoSGamers: Singles Sale + Nazgul Deck Build" at the top of the image, in a bold, readable fantasy-themed font. Below this, include the text "Wasteland Adventure Returns" in slightly smaller font. Use a vibrant color palette with greens, golds, and deep reds to represent the Magic: The Gathering theme.

Around the text, show visuals of Magic: The Gathering cards, including a focus on singles and deck-building. Include artwork related to the Nazgul from Lord of the Rings and highlight elements from the Wasteland Adventure game, such as desolate landscapes or iconic game imagery.

At the bottom of the image, add "Giveaways Every 5 Minutes" in a bright banner. Ensure this text pops with a glowing effect to draw attention. Place the FoSGamers logo in the lower right corner, making it visible but not too dominant.

Use subtle background elements, like fantasy landscapes, to keep the image engaging but not overcrowded. Make sure all text is clearly readable and the layout is balanced.

I need an image description for a thumbnail where it is saying that the words that need to be in it specifically say, I'm taking the day off. See you tomorrow. 7 a.m. Or get rid of the 7 a.m. Just see you tomorrow and have an exclamation point. And then go and, you know, I want you to figure out some good, like, stuff to make, how to make the image very appealing and something that would relate to the things that I do as, you know, pack openings that I've done over the weeks here. So go back and read the chat and figure that out and add some of that in there. Just make a good description, I mean, for the image so that I can have Leonardo.ai make it. And then also... That's good enough. That's plain and good enough.

[2024-09-16 11:16:39] ChatGPT:
Here’s a **detailed image description** for the thumbnail with the text “I'm taking the day off. See you tomorrow!” that aligns with your branding and pack-opening theme:

---

```
Center the text "I'm taking the day off. See you tomorrow!" in bold, eye-catching font across the middle of the image. Use a vibrant color scheme like light blue or gold to make the text pop against a soft gradient background that mimics the feel of trading cards, such as Magic: The Gathering and Sorcery.

Surround the text with visuals of open packs, with cards like Fierce Guardianship, The Great Henge, or iconic cards from recent streams. Scatter these cards lightly in the background, keeping the focus on the main message, but subtly reminding viewers of the usual pack-opening theme.

Include a soft glow or shadow effect around the text to make it stand out, and ensure the font is modern and clean. Add subtle elements such as foil-like textures or card icons, placed near the corners, to make the design look dynamic but not too busy.

Place the FoSGamers logo subtly in the bottom right corner, ensuring it is visible but not too distracting from the main message. Keep the overall feel professional, friendly, and in line with your usual stream’s energy.

[2024-09-16 11:17:19] ChatGPT:
Here’s the **updated image description** for your thumbnail, incorporating the **Big Hits** you’ve had from this chat:

---

```
Center the text "I'm taking the day off. See you tomorrow!" in bold, vibrant font in the middle of the image. Use a clean, modern style with a soft glow around the text to make it stand out. A bright background gradient with colors like blue and gold will keep the tone light and friendly.

In the background, add subtle visuals of your big hit pulls from previous streams. These should include:

1. **Foil Avatar of Water** from Sorcery Alpha ($2,495) — positioned near the top left.
2. **Borderless Fierce Guardianship** from Commander Masters ($45) — near the bottom right.
3. **Mikaeus the Unhallowed** ($10) and **The Great Henge** ($50) — placed along the middle edges.
4. **Raugrin Triome** from Ikoria ($15+) and **Demonic Tutor** from Commander Masters — scattered lightly in the background.

The cards should be displayed as slightly transparent images to not overwhelm the main text but subtly remind viewers of your pack-opening success.

At the bottom right, include your **FoSGamers logo**, sized small enough to not detract from the central message but visible enough to maintain brand identity. Keep the overall design clean, professional, and visually appealing, with card elements blending into the background.

[2024-09-16 11:22:12] ChatGPT:
Here is an **updated version** of the image description, focusing on the **artwork** from the big hits you’ve pulled, instead of the actual card images. This will give a thematic background based on the card designs:

---

```
Center the text "I'm taking the day off. See you tomorrow!" in bold, vibrant font in the middle of the image. Use a clean, modern style with a soft glow around the text to make it stand out. A bright background gradient with colors like blue and gold will keep the tone light and friendly.

In the background, add subtle artistic elements inspired by your big hit pulls. Instead of card images, use descriptions of the following:

1. **Foil Avatar of Water**: Depict a powerful water elemental or avatar with a swirling water effect, surrounded by an ethereal, glowing mist. The avatar should look mythical and ancient, emphasizing the card's value and rarity.

2. **Borderless Fierce Guardianship**: Include the image of a shield or magical barrier in vibrant colors, representing protection or defiance. The art should evoke a sense of strength and guardianship with clean, borderless lines, reflecting the special edition nature of the card.

3. **Mikaeus, the Unhallowed**: Use dark, eerie elements, like an undead figure clad in shadowy armor with a faint, necromantic glow around it. The background could hint at a graveyard or dark battlefield, giving an ominous, powerful feeling.

4. **The Great Henge**: Imagine a massive, ancient stone structure with lush vines growing over it. The background should feel green, magical, and natural, capturing the essence of ancient power and nature's magic.

5. **Raugrin Triome**: Show a dramatic landscape of rugged mountains and plains with a vast sky. Include colors that hint at both fire and water elements, reflecting the dual nature of the land card.

6. **Demonic Tutor**: Represent a dark figure reading from a glowing, ancient tome, casting ominous red and black shadows. The overall tone should feel mysterious and arcane, with glowing magical symbols surrounding the figure.

These artistic elements should be softly blended into the background to not detract from the central message, creating a thematic feel of magic and adventure, while referencing your biggest pulls in a subtle, artistic way.

Here's an image of me. What I need you to do is analyze this image thoroughly. Then what I want you to do is generate an image of me that would be based off of some of the things that we've pulled out that are big hits. Now, make it obviously a man that is strong and muscular and has similar facial features as myself. Obviously, it should pretty much look like myself, exactly like myself, but as an animated thing as we would have for a card painting. We want it to look more like a hand-painted one, more like a sorcery-type one. I would like to be something similar to a King Arthur type thing.

Make sure you note that we do giveaways too. Make sure we'll say that we start off by doing some giveaways every five minutes. And if the day moves and we're doing some sales and stuff, we'll continue with that. If not, we'll slow those down and potentially stop them if all we're doing is giveaways. I'll figure out if that's the only thing we ever end up doing today, then we'll stop it and we'll just hang out and we'll finish building my Nazgul deck. So we're finishing building the Nazgul deck after the opening is completed, if we complete that early. And then I probably won't complete that early because those take a while. There's a lot of packs there. And then we're going to do... But those are the things that we'll be doing today. We can do some singles too with people who are looking for singles also.

Create a vibrant and energetic thumbnail with the text "Rise & Shine w/FoSGamers: Sorcery Beta Opening + Alpha Finish, Giveaways, & Nazgul Deck Build" in bold, dynamic font.

In the foreground, place images of powerful magic-themed cards, including hints of the Nazgul deck, to give a sense of excitement for the deck-building segment. The overall color scheme should include rich purples, blues, and greens to evoke a magical atmosphere, with the text clearly standing out. Add a subtle glow around the words "Giveaways" to emphasize the ongoing excitement.

i need the rules for breaks

[2024-09-19 07:12:45] ChatGPT:
Here are the **rules for breaks** that apply to your streams, based on the information you've provided throughout our chats:

### **General Break Rules**:
1. **Order of Distribution**: Cards are distributed based on the order of purchase. The first person to buy into the break will receive cards first, followed by the next buyer, and so on. This ensures fairness, especially if there are extra cards that don't divide evenly among participants.

2. **Card Distribution**:
   - **Mythics, Rares, and High-Value Cards**: These are shuffled and distributed evenly among participants. If the number of these cards doesn’t divide evenly, any extra cards will be distributed to the first buyers in the break.
   - **Commons and Uncommons**: Any Commons and Uncommons valued under $3 are not distributed during the break itself but handed out after the stream's end. People can hang out after the stream for a friendly, PG-13 atmosphere while the distribution takes place.

3. **Secret Lair Card Distribution**:
   - If running a mini-break with Secret Lair products (with six cards, for example), all Secret Lair cards will be sleeved and shuffled. Each participant will receive one card, with the cards distributed randomly.
   
4. **Biggest Loser Break Rules**:
   - The participant who pulls the least valuable card(s) will be considered the **Biggest Loser** and receive a **Commander Deck** as a consolation prize.
   - The second **Biggest Loser** will receive the **Collector Booster sample** from the Commander Deck box.
   
5. **End-of-Stream Giveaway**:
   - If there are 30 or more viewers by the end of the stream, a pack of cards will be given away before raiding another stream.
   - If there are 50 or more people present, the giveaway will be for a mid- to high-value pack.
   - Viewers can still purchase packs during the end-of-stream giveaways, but no additional general giveaways will take place except for the **Buyer's Giveaway**.

6. **Buyer's Giveaway**:
   - A quick giveaway for buyers only, lasting no more than a minute, will be held at the end of each stream. This allows enough time to show the pack on video, highlighting the giveaways as part of the stream experience.

### **Flexibility with Breaks**:
- Breaks do not have predetermined spots. The number of participants will be decided at the time of setting up the item.
  
### **Additional Notes**:
- Cards that are not valuable enough (under $3) will be distributed in a relaxed atmosphere after the stream.
- If the stream is focused on giveaways alone, giveaways may be paused if the event becomes too slow or if they become the only focus of the show.

These rules are built around fairness, engagement, and maintaining a fun, community-based atmosphere. Let me know if any adjustments or additions are needed!

I need a new YouTube title and description for a long-form video, where it is going to be like the regular, like a TV screen size, or a horizontal phone, or whatever you want to say. TV screen size. Because that's the regular Google, I mean, YouTube way. My family and I opening up a box of Dusk Mourn Collector Booster Packs. The Dusk Mourn House of Horrors. Now, make sure you use the internet to thoroughly ensure that you spell all of this right. And we pull out a lot of sweet cards, especially even one of the Japanese foils. So, make sure people check it out. And hopefully everybody likes it. Make sure you use the internet to thoroughly understand what we're doing and what we're creating here. And make sure you're very clear on everything that I'm having you do. And make it do all the regular stuff in the description that I ask for, so people are aware of me, and how to find me, and the shows that we do normally, and all that other good stuff. Make sure all the hashtags are exceptionally relevant. Use the internet to figure out good ones. Always make sure that you have ones in there relevant to the things I do also. But also make sure it doesn't go over the limit so it makes it so YouTube doesn't do any of them, too. So, use your internet and your knowledge and everything like that to figure that out. And create that for me.

[2024-09-19 10:28:42] ChatGPT:
Here is the **YouTube title** and **description** for your long-form video:

[2024-09-19 10:29:09] FoSGamers:
You do not use the internet to make sure you spell this all right, because I'm pretty sure Dusk Morn is one word, but double-check the internet and make sure I'm correct on that.

[2024-09-19 10:29:52] ChatGPT:
It seems the correct spelling for the set is **Duskmourn: House of Horror**, with **Duskmourn** being a single word.

Now that this is confirmed, I will revise the title and description for your video accordingly:

[2024-09-19 10:32:28] FoSGamers:
Check the internet and ensure that we should have the opening thing first, or should we put epic stuff first in the title. Just want to make sure it gathers the most amount of views possible, you know, as viral as possible type thing.

[2024-09-19 10:33:02] ChatGPT:
To maximize engagement for your YouTube title, it's better to front-load the most captivating or emotional keyword, such as "Epic" or "God Pack," followed by the key cards you pulled. Studies show that strong emotional words draw more attention (e.g., "insane," "crazy," or "epic"), and placing them early in the title can lead to higher click-through rates【679†source】【680†source】.

Why did you go to the GodPack thing? We're doing Dusk Mourn, so can you please, like, go to what we're actually doing? Remember, we do different things regularly. It's not the same thing over and over again. When I say it's a new video, you need to just go based off of everything from what I said a new video means.

No, it's not a rising sign clip, since it is an entire video. So this is just a, we'll call it a FOS Gamers. You don't need to actually have it as anything with it, because it's just a name of the video. I think it's, or check on the internet and see if we should have anything named next to it, because it's just a long form video that my family recorded and we're putting together to put out. So understand that, and go back and correct that.

[2024-09-19 10:35:59] ChatGPT:

Okay, thank you very much. Now I need you to surf the internet, figure out what a, what Duskmourn, from Magic the Gathering, its art is like. Find out some of the big hits and some of the Japanese foils and what they look like. I need you to mimic those and generate me a thumbnail for this video. Remember, it's a long one, long form video, so it will be a video that will be viewed on a TV screen or on a phone sideways or horizontal.

[2024-09-19 10:38:37] ChatGPT:
For your Duskmourn: House of Horror Collector Booster box opening, here’s an image description based on the card art and big hits for creating a compelling thumbnail with Leonardo.ai:

---

**Image Description:**
```
Create a dark, eerie atmosphere inspired by the Duskmourn: House of Horror set from Magic: The Gathering. The image should evoke a sense of mystery and supernatural horror, with a haunted house silhouette in the background and mist swirling around it. In the foreground, show spectral or glowing hands holding a Collector Booster pack, emphasizing a sense of anticipation and discovery. Use striking accents like deep reds, blacks, and purples to highlight the horror theme.

Include visuals of key cards from the set, such as Meathook Massacre II and Valgavoth, Terror Eater, both of which are framed in the Paranormal Showcase style. The card art should be blended into the mist, glowing slightly to draw attention but not overpower the central image of the booster pack. The focus should be on the haunted and eerie atmosphere rather than the specifics of the cards themselves.

Text: In bold, clear letters, place the words "Duskmourn Collector Booster Opening!" in the center. Below, write "Epic Pulls Inside!" The font should mimic hand-drawn, horror-themed typography, as seen in classic horror movie posters. Ensure all words appear only once and are highly visible and crisp.
```

This description will help create an eerie and thematic thumbnail that captures the feel of Duskmourn and draws attention to the big pulls inside.

[2024-09-19 10:40:08] FoSGamers:
One of the other things I'd like you to do is actually search the internet, thoroughly understand what the cards look like, one of the showcase cards look like, and also what the, like I said, the Japanese anime art foils, the Japanese-like foils look like, and specifically the Courage one, figure out the right name based on the internet. Yeah, I think you should be able to figure that out. It's something Courage, I can't remember what it's before. But what I want you to do is have the image, the outside of the image kind of look like the showcases cards, and then the rest of the image just be the characters. I don't want you to have cards or anything like that, I want you to have just characters in the image.

[2024-09-19 10:40:35] ChatGPT:
The correct card name is **Enduring Courage**, which is a **Japan Showcase Fracture Foil**. Based on the showcase card art and its stylized Japanese aesthetics, here’s an updated description for the thumbnail:

---

**Image Description for Leonardo.ai**:
```
Design a striking, stylized thumbnail inspired by the Japan Showcase and Fracture Foil aesthetics from the Duskmourn: House of Horror set. Use the frame design and border styles reminiscent of Japanese showcase cards, incorporating delicate, swirling patterns and a mixture of dark reds, blacks, and golden accents. In the center, feature hand-painted characters that represent the feel of Duskmourn, such as shadowy figures or dark, eerie creatures inspired by horror themes.

The background should have an ethereal, haunted mist, while the characters appear in dynamic poses, glowing with subtle highlights that mimic the foil effect. No actual cards should be shown—focus entirely on the characters and eerie atmosphere. The text should clearly say "Duskmourn Collector Booster Opening" in a clean, visible font that’s crisp and easy to read, appearing once without duplication.
```

This design evokes the Japanese showcase style without directly showing cards but incorporates the border elements and art style. Let me know if you'd like further adjustments!

I need you to understand what they look like, and I want you to mimic what those images in there are. In this image, it has zero writing of any kind. There should not be any type of writing on there. It should be completely just an image with zero writing.

For the new image you want to create, here’s a thorough description based on the information gathered from my research on *Duskmourn: House of Horror* and Magic: The Gathering showcase art:

---

**Image Description for Leonardo.ai**  
Design an image with an eerie, dark atmosphere inspired by *Duskmourn: House of Horror*. Frame the image with an elegant, mystical showcase border like the showcase card art style from Magic: The Gathering. The main focus should be on five prominent characters inspired by *Duskmourn*:  
- **Meathook Massacre II**: A sinister figure with shadowy tendrils and a large, dripping hook in one hand.  
- **Valgavoth, Terror Eater**: A towering, monstrous creature with skeletal features, large jagged teeth, and glowing red eyes.  
- **Kaito, Bane of Nightmares**: A stealthy assassin cloaked in dark robes, wielding a blade that emits an eerie glow.  
- **Screaming Nemesis**: A nightmarish wraith-like figure with tendrils of shadow reaching out from its cloak.  
- **Overlord of the Hauntwoods**: A tree-like entity with a decaying, skeletal visage, surrounded by twisted roots and vines.  

Each character should be painted in a stylized, hand-drawn manner, with the central characters arranged symmetrically. Their poses should convey action and menace, blending with the dark, mysterious environment. There should be no text in the image, and the showcase border should add an extra level of elegance without overpowering the characters.

Make sure the lighting highlights the haunting and magical qualities of each character. There should be no text in the image at all, just the artwork and characters themselves. Keep the style consistent with the Magic: The Gathering showcase artwork, especially from the *Duskmourn* set.

---

This description will guide Leonardo.ai to create a dynamic and detailed image that fits the *Duskmourn: House of Horror* theme while incorporating the showcase border and prominent characters, without text.

And you need to describe kind of what everything looks like, because Leonardo.ai doesn't fully understand that without you describing it. You need no words for what characters are. You just need to describe certain things to tell it to make them. You don't need to tell the characters. Just tell it to describe certain things and to make it. The only thing that you can have it do is give it words to say anything of, would be the title thing that needs to be in the middle of the Dusk Mourn thing that I just told you.

[2024-09-19 10:46:06] ChatGPT:
Here is the description for Leonardo.ai based on your request:

---

**Image Description for Leonardo.ai**:  
Create a dark, eerie scene inspired by the Magic: The Gathering set **Duskmourn: House of Horrors**. The center of the image should have the words **Duskmourn: House of Horrors** written clearly and crisply in a bold, horror-themed font, positioned right in the middle of the image. Surrounding the title should be a set of horrifying characters and eerie, supernatural elements, all hand-drawn in a horror fantasy style.

The edges of the image should feature a showcase border style that mimics the Duskmourn showcase cards. This border should include intricate and dark swirls, mixing black, red, and shadowy purple hues to enhance the feeling of dread. The characters should look like terrifying monsters, shadows, and spirits with glowing eyes, jagged claws, and decayed features, arranged in a way that seems chaotic but purposeful, giving the impression that they're lurking towards the viewer.

No text should be present besides the title, and the colors should be deep and dark, with only subtle highlights on the characters to make them stand out against the shadowy background. The scene should feel haunted and mysterious, making it clear that the image is inspired by a horrific theme.

---

This description follows your guidelines and will help guide Leonardo.ai to generate the desired image for you. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!

[2024-09-19 10:46:32] FoSGamers:
Make sure you only have Duskmoor and House of Horrors in there once, and also it should be in quotations so it knows, and it should be copyable also.

[2024-09-19 10:46:56] ChatGPT:
Here is the corrected description, formatted for easy copying and including your specifications:

**Image Description for Leonardo.ai**:  
```
Create a dark, eerie scene inspired by the Magic: The Gathering set "Duskmourn: House of Horrors". The center of the image should have the words "Duskmourn: House of Horrors" written clearly and crisply in a bold, horror-themed font, positioned in the middle of the image. Surrounding the title should be horrifying characters and eerie, supernatural elements, hand-drawn in a horror fantasy style.

This should work perfectly for Leonardo.ai to create the image. Let me know if you need any more adjustments!

[2024-09-19 12:39:33] FoSGamers:
should the title have "by FoSGamers" at the end for branding?

[2024-09-19 12:40:07] ChatGPT:
Yes, adding "**by FoSGamers**" to the title of the image can be a great branding tool, especially for consistency across your content. It will help identify your brand as the creator of the image, adding professionalism and making your brand more recognizable. So the title would now look like:

Including **by FoSGamers** will reinforce your brand while still delivering the desired visual aesthetic.

[2024-09-19 12:40:50] FoSGamers:
For the duskmourn video should the title have "by FoSGamers" at the end for branding?

[2024-09-19 12:41:01] ChatGPT:
Yes, adding **"by FoSGamers"** at the end of the title for the *Duskmourn* video could be a smart branding move. It provides clear ownership of the content and helps viewers associate your brand with the video. This can also improve brand recognition, especially if you're consistently producing similar content across different platforms. It subtly reinforces your identity without overwhelming the viewer with logos or excessive branding.

For example, the title could be:

**"Epic Duskmourn Collector Booster Box Opening | Family Pulls Japanese Foil & More by FoSGamers"**

This way, you're still focusing on the content, but you're also ensuring that your brand is a key part of the presentation. It's a good balance of content focus and brand visibility.

[2024-09-19 18:37:07] FoSGamers:
So, I need you to help me with generating the title for the next YouTube Live. I need you to use all the things I've given you in the past, um, to tell you why you'd like to have in it. And what we'll be doing tomorrow is it is a Dusk Warn release day. So, we will be opening, uh, having Dusk Warn 2 open. More specifically, we'll be opening a Collector Booster Box 5 and, um, auctioning it off singles. Within it, and we will also be, um, doing a Dusk Warn specific Vegas Loser Break. And a, um... And a Poll Box for Dusk Warn, where it will be only foils in the Poll Box. There will be, um... From multiple sets, but a lot of them will be from, um, Dusk Warn, um... Uh, Dusk Warn... Outlaws of Thunder Junction and, um, Bloomboro. Um... Make sure you use the internet to figure out the good, the right word spelling of everything. And the correct hashtags to go along with this to make it work the way I'd like.

[2024-09-19 18:46:49] FoSGamers:
All cards are shuffled before distribution, except for when it comes to the distributing the uncompensated uncompensated. All of the other ones that are distributed are sleeved. Anything that's of high value will have a proxy, and then they will all be shuffled up and distributed based on the rules.

Generate a description for the thumbnail for this. Ensure that the words are exceptionally clear and only in there once.

[2024-09-19 19:01:02] ChatGPT:
Here's a description for the thumbnail of the *Duskmourn: House of Horrors* live stream, keeping the instructions in mind:

```
Design a dark and eerie thumbnail that captures the haunting atmosphere of the *Duskmourn: House of Horrors* set. The background should depict a mysterious, fog-covered landscape with ominous, twisted trees and shadowy figures lurking in the distance. In the center, place a single glowing light illuminating the words "Duskmourn: House of Horrors" in a stylized, gothic font. The text should be clear and crisp, easy to read, and placed directly in the center of the image. Surround the title with dark energy swirling outward, giving the image a sense of motion and suspense. Along the outer edges of the image, implement design elements inspired by the showcase borders seen in *Magic: The Gathering* cards, specifically from the Duskmourn set. No additional text or words should be included outside of the title itself. The overall tone should evoke a sense of horror and anticipation, pulling viewers in to discover the mystery within the booster box opening.
```

This description ensures the text is only present once, and it captures the dark, thrilling essence of the content you're presenting. Let me know if you'd like any further adjustments!

[2024-09-19 19:17:03] FoSGamers:
Make sure the thumbnail has the title in it. Remember that's the primary thing that needs to be in there. And one of the things that may need to be in there is the, um... is the, um... brand name. So make sure that's in there for the description that's needed for the RO.AI. And make sure it has everything to be extremely clear.

[2024-09-19 19:17:24] ChatGPT:
Here’s the updated description for the thumbnail creation for Leonardo.ai:

```
Design a dark and eerie thumbnail for the *Duskmourn: House of Horrors* live stream. In the center, feature the title "Duskmourn: House of Horrors" in a bold, gothic font, ensuring the text is clear, prominent, and crisp. Below the title, include the brand name "FoSGamers" in a smaller, but still clear font. The title and brand name should be illuminated by a subtle glow to make them stand out from the darker background.

The background should depict a misty, haunted landscape with twisted trees and shadowy figures to evoke the mystery of the Duskmourn set. Dark, swirling energy around the title should add movement and depth, enhancing the sense of anticipation. Along the outer edges of the image, incorporate design elements inspired by showcase borders from the *Magic: The Gathering* Duskmourn set. The overall atmosphere should be ominous and suspenseful, drawing viewers in.

Ensure no other text or words are included, and that the title and brand name are easy to read and placed prominently in the center of the image.
```

This description ensures that the primary elements — the title and brand name — are clearly represented, with the dark and suspenseful atmosphere fitting the content of the live stream. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!

[2024-09-19 19:20:23] FoSGamers:
Remember, it's supposed to have the Rise and Shine with FOSS Gamers, not Live FOSS Gamers or whatever you just did there. Make sure the branding is correct for the morning shows. Use your entire chat here. Read through it. Realize what you're supposed to be doing and actually do it right. Don't be lazy.

[2024-09-19 19:20:39] ChatGPT:
Here’s the corrected description for the thumbnail generation based on your *Rise and Shine w/FoSGamers* morning show branding:

```
Design a dark and eerie thumbnail for the *Rise and Shine w/FoSGamers: Duskmourn: House of Horrors* live stream. In the center, feature the title "Rise and Shine w/FoSGamers: Duskmourn: House of Horrors" in bold, gothic font. Ensure the text is clear, prominent, and easily readable. Illuminate the title with a soft glow to make it stand out against the dark, suspenseful background.

The background should depict a misty, haunted landscape with twisted trees, shadowy figures, and dark, swirling energy. The swirling energy should surround the title, adding a sense of movement and mystery. Incorporate showcase-style borders around the edges of the image, inspired by *Magic: The Gathering* cards from the Duskmourn set.

Ensure the title "Rise and Shine w/FoSGamers: Duskmourn: House of Horrors" is the only text in the image and is prominently centered. No additional text or writing should be present in the image.
```

This description now correctly reflects the branding for your morning shows. Let me know if you need any more adjustments!

So, for this live, it's not only going to be for the, um, the box of, for the pull box. It is not only, um, all of those there. The pull box is, um, cards from all those sets along with Modern Horizon 3. They're not only collector boosters. They're all cards from that set, um, that are uncommon and common. Nothing special, but on there, in this box, there are 36 cards that have Play Booster written on them for Duskborn Play Booster and 12 written on them for Collector Boosters of Duskborn. That's what this is, um, and it is going to be, um, what it will end up being is, um, $4 for 4 pulls from the pull box. And there will be, um, 544 cards in the pull box. So, um, I need you to give me the average. The ceiling is going to be $25 since that's the highest they can get as a Collector Booster. Well, I guess they could be $100 if they get 3, 4 Collector Boosters. So I guess the ceiling is $100 if they get 4 Collector Boosters. Um, then the floor would be, um, I guess $0.01 because that's the lowest price of, uh, or $0.04 because that's the lowest price of any of those cards is $0.01. Um, but a lot of it is foils from Collector Boosters. Um, and some, and there's even the, uh, Duskborn Collector Booster that I opened recently in there that, from the cards that we didn't take from it. And there's also some of the rares from Duskborn spread out in there too. Not big rares, but some of the nice rares that you might have some fun with. Um, maybe, maybe a couple bucks or something like that. Nothing major. So I need you to generate that item title and description and update the, um, update the show notes on YouTube. And, I mean, the Whatnot show notes and the Whatnot in our YouTube description.

This now fully integrates the Collector Booster-only cards into the pull box, along with accurate descriptions for both YouTube and Whatnot. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!

[2024-09-20 06:34:04] FoSGamers:
In the break there, you can't get the Duskborn Play Booster and Collector Boosters as part of the poll box. The break is separate from that. Do not combine them.

[2024-09-20 06:34:50] ChatGPT:
Thank you for the clarification. Here’s the updated version where the pull box and break are clearly separated, as well as the necessary changes for the Whatnot item descriptions and YouTube Live description.

[2024-09-20 06:36:48] FoSGamers:
Tell me how many total polls there would be, since there's four, and there's 544 cards, and there are four polls, four cards per poll. Tell me how many polls there would be, and add that in there to the description for the poll box only.

[2024-09-20 06:37:12] ChatGPT:
There will be a total of **136 pulls** available from the pull box.

Here’s the updated description with that information added:

Remember to tell us for the title of this, for the YouTube title, that it is a, um, we're doing a Collector Box Opening of Duskborn. So, Duskborn Release Collector Box Boost, Collector Booster Box Opening is the primary thing. Now make sure that it's within the 100 characters needed for YouTube title.

[2024-09-20 06:50:04] ChatGPT:
Here’s the updated YouTube title with the requested details about the *Duskmourn* Collector Booster Box Opening, keeping it under 100 characters:

### **YouTube Live Title:**
```
Rise & Shine w/FoSGamers: Duskmourn Release Collector Booster Box Opening & Biggest Loser Break!
```

---

This title highlights the *Duskmourn* release and Collector Booster Box Opening as the primary focus, with the *Biggest Loser Break* secondary. It fits well within the 100-character limit for YouTube titles. Let me know if this works or if any additional changes are needed!

[2024-09-20 12:01:12] FoSGamers:
I need a YouTube short title for opening a collector booster of Duskmourn, House of Horror. Make sure you get that spelled correctly. Use the internet to make sure it's spelled 100% correctly, and make sure all letters are spelled correctly in it, so use it and double check it twice. And then, um, what is open with that collector booster is my wife pulls out a Meat Hook Massacre 2, so I'd like to, uh, have a title generated with that, and also we get a bunch of nice foil cards for, um, foil rare cards and cards worth money that they, everybody should be checking out and making sure that they see this video to see all the awesome cards in it. Now, I want to have the title be something like Beautiful Wife Pulls Beautiful Meat Hook or something along those lines, see if that would be a good one to be humorous, and the reason why I ask it is because I want to make sure I'm not going to get in trouble with any terms of service on YouTube. And then, um, the, uh, and brand it, like, because this was pulled on the FOS Gamers, the, um, Arise and Shine show, so have that branded, and have all the show notes, have all the, uh, the notes, I mean the description for the, um, short also, please.

[2024-09-20 12:01:58] FoSGamers:
Search the internet and find if beautiful is a good word to have in there to be drawing people in.

[2024-09-20 12:02:27] ChatGPT:
Here’s what I found regarding the word **"beautiful"** for your YouTube short title:

The word *"beautiful"* can indeed be a good way to draw people in, especially when used in a positive or complementary context. It’s often used to invoke curiosity and is generally viewed as an engaging word. However, in your case, the phrase *"Beautiful Wife Pulls Beautiful Meat Hook"* could potentially be flagged by YouTube’s content guidelines, as *"Meat Hook"* can be interpreted in various ways, and YouTube's terms might flag it as inappropriate, even though it refers to a card in this instance. To stay on the safe side, I recommend rephrasing it slightly to avoid any potential issues.

Here's a suggestion for a safer, yet still engaging, title:

[2024-09-20 16:13:07] FoSGamers:
It's not specifically 89 common cards, it's just 89 cards in general, 10 cards that have Play Booster written on them, and 1 card that have Collector Booster written on them, for a total of 100 cards. So, update that information.

I have removed the earlier misstatement about the cards and clarified that there are no specific "common" cards or exact breakdowns, but instead, 10 Play Booster and 1 Collector Booster card, for a total of 100 cards. This updated description and title should now be aligned with your specific needs.

[00:33:22] was a head lifeguard in Rockport
[00:33:23] Massachusetts for a little while um and
[00:33:27] I did like random stuff to exercise and
[00:33:29] I was also on the wrestling team so I
[00:33:31] like did literally random things trying
[00:33:32] to exercise and gain
[00:33:34] strength um and one of the things I oh
[00:33:37] it's not opening oh oh we got this is a
[00:33:39] tight pack does that mean it's a tight
[00:33:41] pack me it's good stuff in
[00:33:43] here well one of the times when I was
[00:33:45] exercising I was standing there just
[00:33:47] doing back flips and uh my boss who
[00:33:50] happened to be police officer came by
[00:33:51] and just stops the truck his vehicle his

[01:16:49] I'll be back a little later this
[01:16:50] afternoon but there we go now I have a
[01:16:53] question there was somebody El was
[01:16:54] hanging out here with me the other day
[01:16:56] they were looking for a Corum The
[01:16:57] Undertaker who was
[01:16:59] that and remember check in follow like
[01:17:04] subscribe on YouTube because the larger
[01:17:06] our show is the things we got going on
[01:17:09] the every single day so at the end of
[01:17:11] the day say we're able to get like
[01:17:14] couple hundred people watching on a
[01:17:15] regular
[01:17:16] basis those will probably end up being
[01:17:18] packs up there instead of cards
[01:17:30] do checking my oil no not today that was
[01:17:33] a different day no I got to go to um I
[01:17:36] had a blood test done to check and make
[01:17:37] sure I um long story short when I uh
[01:17:40] moved down to
[01:17:42] Florida I almost died I got lucky by I
[01:17:45] went to a doctor and they found out my
[01:17:47] hemoglobin level was at um hemoglobin
[01:17:50] was at uh
[01:17:52] four7 so uh they literally called me had
[01:17:55] me go to the emergency room said this is
[01:17:57] like two years ago this is a while ago
[01:17:59] and there's like four doctors a bunch of
[01:18:01] nurses there they're like you're about
[01:18:02] to die your heart's about to stop
[01:18:03] because I had no oxygen in it so long
[01:18:06] story short they figured that out fixed
[01:18:08] it there's a leak in me somewhere which
[01:18:09] is why I say
[01:18:10] everybody you when you're in your 30s so
[01:18:13] 40s do definitely to get your colon
[01:18:14] check I know it's a weird thing to say
[01:18:16] but just do it it's better than have
[01:18:17] that than be what I ran in here because
[01:18:19] I kept having it ignored and I didn't do
[01:18:21] it much I was not I should have pushed
[01:18:22] more and that's why I ran into I almost
[01:18:25] died anyways they fixed it we're good
[01:18:29] now kind of I just can't sit
[01:18:34] straight yes so that's why I tell you

[00:18:06] right get your hand on your weapon as
[00:18:08] they
[00:18:09] approach looks like they uh they kind of
[00:18:11] bump into you but you feel something as
[00:18:14] they bump into you what are you going to
[00:18:23] do got 30 seconds to figure it out
[00:18:31] you going to draw your weapon you're
[00:18:32] going to wander
[00:18:34] away it's your choice my
[00:18:38] friend draw your weapon all right you

[00:18:48] shoot you draw your
[00:18:50] pistol your knife or whatever it is and
[00:18:52] you shoot all right you take a shot now
[00:18:54] they're only a 13 they're weak so that
[00:18:57] means you need an 11 or higher you you
[00:18:58] got 13 you hit him for five oh it's a
[00:19:01] nice shot well that weak Ranger Raider
[00:19:05] get shot and they actually turn and run
[00:19:08] and as they turn and run they end up
[00:19:10] dropping some pogs well it looks like
[00:19:13] they were trying to rob you that was a
[00:19:15] good one what that one stuck in there
[00:19:18] for I hate when that gets stuck in there
[00:19:19] so you got
[00:19:22] four pogs my friend we're going to put
[00:19:25] those right here so you can see them
[00:19:26] four pogs my friend is what what you
[00:19:30] got all right nice that was a good
[00:19:33] choice to uh to to draw the weapon he
[00:19:35] was trying to rob you there he's trying
[00:19:37] to pull a quick one and our next one is
[00:19:39] Robert Wood coming in with a telling of
[00:19:42] haven wood from time spal remastered let
[00:19:45] me get that
[00:19:49] out
[00:19:51] Theron let me find that
[00:20:01] now like I said a lot of these are going
[00:20:03] to be in the buy
[00:20:15] now Theon of
[00:20:17] Havenwood there you go there's your
[00:20:19] single there my
[00:20:20] friend and you also ended up
[00:20:25] getting where is it you got yourself and
[00:20:28] engineering booster we'll use you know
[00:20:31] what we're going to use this as the
[00:20:32] engineering booster so I don't know what
[00:20:34] I did with it there's your engineering
[00:20:36] booster my
[00:20:37] friend Robert what are you going to do
[00:20:40] your guy's pretty smart now he comes in
[00:20:43] then he wanders in and has he wanders in
[00:20:45] he gets that engineering boost he gives
[00:20:46] him plus one to engineering got a little
[00:20:48] bit extra you happen to find an old
[00:20:51] locked chest
[00:20:53] Robert in that in that little town that
[00:20:55] we were
[00:20:57] in you know you take over the character
[00:20:59] you get to decide what we're doing in
[00:21:00] the adventure here so Robert what do you
[00:21:03] want to
[00:21:03] do we'll do the same thing as we did for
[00:21:05] everyone else there we'll give a we'll
[00:21:07] give the a minute and a half and I'm
[00:21:08] going to go on you know what this time
[00:21:09] I'm going to do a safe haven since we're
[00:21:12] in a town seems like you should probably
[00:21:13] bump into a safe haven
[00:21:17] right let's pick the lock I like it all
[00:21:20] right so since you have engineering you
[00:21:22] get a little bit extra
[00:21:24] uh a little bit extra with
[00:21:27] that all right right let me get you over
[00:21:30] here
[00:21:37] Robert thought I put you in here
[00:21:43] already you get strength and Engineering
[00:21:46] there we go
[00:22:00] okay get your pistol and your knife put
[00:22:03] those over there and then you roll now
[00:22:06] the engineering normally you do a 50/50
[00:22:08] on these but because you have
[00:22:09] engineering you get to roll and try to
[00:22:11] get a uh you have to get a
[00:22:13] [Music]
[00:22:15] 13 I mean not 13 seven or higher because
[00:22:18] the opposite
[00:22:19] direction well there you go you got 12
[00:22:22] look at that so you open that old lock
[00:22:23] chest that was a good choice my friend
[00:22:26] because inside that old lock chest you
[00:22:28] find an assault rifle and some ammo for
[00:22:31] it well look at that my friend
[00:22:34] nice sweet Robert so that gives you an
[00:22:38] AR with some pistol uh with some ammo so
[00:22:41] I mean Drew you instead of at 15
[00:22:42] starting out you're going to be at 30
[00:22:44] rounds of AR 30 rounds of ammo with
[00:22:47] it that gives you three shot three round
[00:22:50] shots three h three shot burst that's
[00:22:54] the only option that you get so you use
[00:22:56] three rounds each time and it gives you
[00:22:58] a three on your uh character when they
[00:23:03] uh roll for their for their attack so
[00:23:05] all right let's see who's coming up
[00:23:10] next
[00:23:12] it and Robert on that one that was the
[00:23:16] wrong one I'm in the wrong one we got a
[00:23:18] safe haven Robert jumped in Safe Haven I
[00:23:21] like it Robert you found the storage
[00:23:24] vendor that's sugar Steve sugar Steve
[00:23:27] has all kinds of um
[00:23:29] chemicals and uh weapon ammo that is uh
[00:23:33] experimental we'll say sometimes it
[00:23:36] works sometimes it
[00:23:37] doesn't we'll see how it goes but we'll
[00:23:39] get your Thalia heretic out right
[00:23:43] now I think I saw that earlier I swear I
[00:23:46] saw that earlier when I was looking for
[00:23:47] that last card
[00:23:48] too all right let's see let's pull that
[00:23:51] out here remember a lot of these are in
[00:23:52] the buy now if you want to check them
[00:23:53] out
[00:24:01] swear I saw that
[00:24:08] card Thalia guar header tick 351 right
[00:24:12] there my friend I did see it I was
[00:24:15] right nice one on that so now Su Robert
[00:24:22] you ran into Su and you have to decide
[00:24:24] you only have an AR that pistol and the
[00:24:27] knife you have no pogs you want to tryy
[00:24:30] to get anything you want to try to trade
[00:24:31] for anything or you just going to be
[00:24:33] like you know what I'm good with that uh
[00:24:34] I I see I got your uh I see where you
[00:24:37] are maybe you'll uh try to return

[00:32:12] steal from you this is this I guess I
[00:32:15] guess this could be who knows that's
[00:32:16] what they were coming over so they kind
[00:32:18] of were sneaking in on you and you
[00:32:19] happen to be lucky that you heard them
[00:32:22] because you've got your intelligence and
[00:32:25] you're engineering you were paying
[00:32:26] attention to things you beeps there you
[00:32:28] go my
[00:32:29] friend got that one for you let me get
[00:32:32] you your kadas reach out too while we're
[00:32:34] figuring out what we're doing
[00:32:36] here all right you draw the pistol all
[00:32:40] right you draw your pistol
[00:32:43] and oh no they lunge forward with a
[00:32:45] knife before you get the chance to do
[00:32:47] anything oh God I hate when that happens
[00:32:50] you guys have like a up on screen will
[00:32:53] pop up a uh like the top will pop up
[00:32:56] like a a notification you don't want as
[00:32:58] you're pressing down on something it is
[00:33:00] the most annoying thing in the goddamn
[00:33:04] world they go after you with the knife
[00:33:06] first they get to hit a 13 or high to
[00:33:08] get you o they missed you got lucky my
[00:33:11] friend look at that they
[00:33:13] missed are you shooting with your pistol
[00:33:16] I'm guessing now that they they swiped
[00:33:17] at you with their knife trying to steal
[00:33:20] all right you have to get a for that guy
[00:33:22] it's only a 14 so that means you get a
[00:33:24] 12 or higher and you got well we're
[00:33:27] giving it to you that's a 13 it was
[00:33:28] between the 13 I got to get a flat thing
[00:33:29] to put down there so I'm giv you the 13
[00:33:32] and you get them for two so you hit them
[00:33:34] for two they end up turning to run

[00:37:55] cybernetic enhanced Raiders in front of
[00:37:57] you
[00:38:00] what are you going to do luckily you
[00:38:02] stumbled upon him before he knew what
[00:38:04] was going on
[00:38:10] Mystic maybe you're uh I don't know
[00:38:12] maybe they were fallowing the same piece
[00:38:14] of the
[00:38:16] map what do you want to do all you going
[00:38:19] to hide it's a good choice so you turn
[00:38:22] around and you go oh crap turn around
[00:38:24] you find one of those burnt out building
[00:38:25] you jump back inside there you hide they
[00:38:29] just keep wandering by nothing really
[00:38:32] they're kind of scanning the area not
[00:38:34] doing
[00:38:35] anything and they end up just running
[00:38:39] off further into the distance after they
[00:38:41] did a scan looks like they're looking
[00:38:43] for something but no one really knows
[00:38:45] exactly what they're looking for right
[00:38:47] now I don't know maybe that map might
[00:38:49] help you help you find
[00:38:51] something you still have the map there
[00:38:53] so I'll have to put that map piece in
[00:38:55] your um
[00:38:58] in your pocket
[00:39:00] there so here we go we're going to go on
[00:39:02] again we'll see what happens here who
[00:39:05] else wants to try their chances for a
[00:39:07] weapon a why' it do that
[00:39:10] whatever and you have now my
[00:39:17] friend where will we put that that goes
[00:39:20] here you have
[00:39:25] a Matt pragman so have 1 2 3
[00:39:30] 4 5 6 oh you only have one more item you
[00:39:33] can hold in your uh spot before your um
[00:39:36] you have no more
[00:39:42] space we have it guy coming in ooh it
[00:39:45] guy nice it guy come in and you grab
[00:39:48] yourself a
[00:39:49] sword let me get you Unstoppable slasher
[00:39:52] out that's a nice
[00:39:55] pickup Unstoppable Slasher
[00:39:59] all right well you just hit that burnt
[00:40:01] out building you jump out of the burnt
[00:40:03] out building my friend and you
[00:40:09] see a large Raider coming up they must
[00:40:13] been following that other
[00:40:14] guy but he sees
[00:40:19] you you don't have an opportunity to run
[00:40:22] and hide this time though
[00:40:31] so what are you going to do my friend
[00:40:33] there's your Unstoppable
[00:40:41] slasher I stay up there you'll attack
[00:40:44] with your new sword and use that it's a
[00:40:46] oh nice because the sword would have
[00:40:48] been a plus five but using the critical
[00:40:50] doesn't matter so that means let's do
[00:40:52] this all right let's get you
[00:40:54] a top loader for your cards here
[00:40:59] we're really just rolling for your
[00:41:02] damage all right we're rolling for your
[00:41:04] damage in the uh
[00:41:09] multiplier all right let's see what your
[00:41:10] damage in your multiplier
[00:41:13] is
[00:41:15] multiplier damage oh there was only a
[00:41:18] one for the
[00:41:19] multiplier that's no fun there hold on
[00:41:22] let's aim that down so you can see it
[00:41:27] there's only a one for the multiplier so
[00:41:30] that means you did not get any
[00:41:31] multiplier so you have done a damage
[00:41:35] though guaranteed hit you guaranteed hit
[00:41:37] him for uh seven damage there at least
[00:41:41] you guaranteed hit for seven damage so
[00:41:43] that was good
[00:41:45] because that large
[00:41:47] Raider is only 25 health and you hit him
[00:41:50] on the
[00:41:52] shoulder and when he was going to pull
[00:41:54] out his uh his weapon he's had a hard
[00:41:55] time so instead it's going to be a uh 16
[00:41:59] or higher to hit you this time because
[00:42:01] he can't hold his weapon
[00:42:03] up and he misses look at that one he
[00:42:06] misses you're lucky that large Raider
[00:42:07] misses and he turns he runs fleeing
[00:42:09] following that cybernetic Raider that he
[00:42:11] F saw earlier but as he turns and he
[00:42:15] runs he drops
[00:42:21] something he
[00:42:23] drops the weapon he was holding the
[00:42:25] assault rifle
[00:42:28] which only
[00:42:29] has
[00:42:33] uh 11 rounds of ammo but it's an assault
[00:42:37] rifle
[00:42:49] nice there you go
[00:42:51] buddy oo piece of
[00:42:54] candy we'll run this again see if
[00:42:56] anybody else wants some weapons forgot
[00:42:59] to run it earlier while I was talking
[00:43:01] put the timer up make sure we're
[00:43:04] rolling anybody else seeing any singles
[00:43:06] they

[01:00:17] that small town that was a good one good
[01:00:20] choice to run away from that one that
[01:00:22] was a rough one that would have been a
[01:00:23] tough guy to beat generally the those
[01:00:27] are tougher to beat than some of the
[01:00:28] others yes but hey we have a bunch of uh
[01:00:31] the things here and trying to figure out

[01:07:44] opter tokens which can be used to monoc
[01:07:45] cryptolith and make a next hanger back

[01:07:50] that's a yeah hey if it works out it's
[01:07:51] nice that would be sweet I like the idea
[01:07:53] of it so you got my friend you've got a
[01:07:58] wick the world M and with that Wick the
[01:08:00] world M you yourself got
[01:08:03] a sword which is nice because that's a
[01:08:06] plus five for your Adventure character
[01:08:08] when they're rolling when you roll your
[01:08:10] dice cuz you do a little D and D stuff
[01:08:12] here and you roll a dice so let me find
[01:08:15] your Wick the world
[01:08:21] mine you know what let's do this so you

[01:08:37] Wick the world mine there you
[01:08:40] go put that there with the
[01:08:44] W's all right now you my friend have to
[01:08:47] make a choice you have that sword you
[01:08:51] happened to pick that up when you looked
[01:08:52] into one of those broken buildings you
[01:08:53] turn around though
[01:08:55] when you're in that broken building and
[01:08:58] you
[01:09:00] see a junkyard rat starting to jump
[01:09:03] toward
[01:09:05] you elf Lord's
[01:09:16] beard so you have a sword you have a
[01:09:18] pistol and a a knife because that's what
[01:09:21] you get when you start out your
[01:09:22] adventure so elf's Lord beard what are
[01:09:24] you going to do
[01:09:28] going to add you in here for our
[01:09:31] character
[01:09:45] now here we
[01:09:48] go pistol knife and a sword for you my
[01:09:52] friend today
[01:09:56] that's a good pickup on the sword
[01:09:58] there seduce it oh I like
[01:10:01] it I like it so that junkyard rat there
[01:10:05] you look at it and you uh he's getting
[01:10:06] ready to bite you and you kind of lean
[01:10:08] over take a scrap of food out from your
[01:10:11] bag that you got there and oh well look
[01:10:13] at that scrap of food he stops jumping
[01:10:17] toward you
[01:10:19] instead that junkyard rat
[01:10:26] drops down takes a piece of food and
[01:10:28] wanders
[01:10:29] away yeah that was a good choice because
[01:10:32] those are generally IR radiated and you
[01:10:34] my friend do not have any rataway all
[01:10:37] right so that was a smart one letting
[01:10:38] them go wander away there let's see what
[01:10:40] else we got for weapons now tonight our
[01:10:42] plan is for this evening we're going to

[01:36:30] between like the the lands the the land
[01:36:33] pack that they gave you guys and every
[01:36:34] now and again when you see that like two
[01:36:36] or three of them like are split
[01:36:37] separately they end up being like really
[01:36:38] big hits ah see these are just not set
[01:36:41] so like sometimes like the last couple
[01:36:44] of ones that we've done you'll get ones
[01:36:45] that are set like that we'll say all
[01:36:48] right so I'm like oh those two here end

[00:04:40] intriguing I might have to uh might have
[00:04:43] to go and check one of those out one of
[00:04:45] these days then I didn't know that they
[00:04:46] were that cheap over at McDonald's there
[00:04:49] but are they do they taste like plastic
[00:04:50] see that's what their ice cream tastes
[00:04:52] like plastic and I have a problem with
[00:04:53] that so that's part of the reason why I
[00:04:54] don't go over and get like ice cream
[00:04:55] from them unless I really need it
[00:04:59] [Laughter]
[00:05:02] all right all right I might need to try

[00:05:05] where it's a uh where it's like their um
[00:05:07] their uh they're um hash browns you know

[00:07:07] what the free stuff out there like I
[00:07:09] said sometimes it ends up changing
[00:07:11] depending on uh how the day ends up
[00:07:13] going hopefully your days are going

[00:07:26] games so I I think the adventure all
[00:07:29] right
[00:07:31] so Gustav you know how I was talking
[00:07:33] about motav thank you motav for coming
[00:07:35] in and hanging out you I was talking
[00:07:37] about uh doing that Adventure game and
[00:07:41] having the whole show based on it well
[00:07:43] I'm thinking at the end like the last
[00:07:46] thing maybe not the whole well it might
[00:07:47] not be that show but it might be the end
[00:07:49] of the adventure like the big final boss
[00:07:52] when you beat the big final boss there's
[00:07:54] going to be something like that's like
[00:07:55] the big thing that's done uh or like
[00:07:58] that's uh that's like the big thing
[00:07:59] that's being like as a item I'm thinking
[00:08:02] the big item might be one of these type
[00:08:04] of things like one of the secret layers
[00:08:06] maybe at the end of the story I don't
[00:08:09] know something like that is what I was
[00:08:11] thinking I don't know if people would be
[00:08:13] intrigued by that or if that just silly
[00:08:15] on my part so I I don't know everybody I
[00:08:18] don't know every always know what

[00:12:55] over here we're going to do some
[00:12:57] Japanese ioria that's an intriguing one
[00:13:00] now I like the Japanese stuff because uh
[00:13:02] yeah I like the alt Arts personally a
[00:13:04] lot on the Japanese ones like a big fan
[00:13:07] of the Japanese alt Arts let me see I
[00:13:10] thought I had it saved in here give me
[00:13:12] one a
[00:13:13] second oh I copied the wrong I didn't
[00:13:15] have it saved do not have it saved this
[00:13:17] because the wrong one was copied I have
[00:13:19] to read figure that one out here we go
[00:13:21] we're going to do
[00:13:22] this do that again and there we
[00:13:26] are that over there
[00:13:33] go there we
[00:13:41] go yeah why
[00:13:43] not do
[00:13:45] that
[00:13:47] that Japanese iori I
[00:13:55] know oh yeah definitely I I've um
[00:13:59] so long story short I almost died and uh
[00:14:02] uh because of some medical issue and
[00:14:04] after that happened I was like 36 is
[00:14:06] when they figured it out and since then
[00:14:08] my body has just been no good everything
[00:14:10] breaking bone issues it's just yeah it's
[00:14:13] tiring and so um with that being said
[00:14:17] instead of I getting to a point where I
[00:14:19] can't do anything at all and I'm just
[00:14:20] like you know a little bit sore at the
[00:14:21] end of the day my fames actually decided
[00:14:23] to make a few changes with our lives
[00:14:25] because um my wife had an issue with her
[00:14:28] job I've been a little bit r with mine
[00:14:30] so we're actually ended up uh we're
[00:14:31] going to we talked to a broker yesterday
[00:14:33] about buying a boat to uh start
[00:14:35] traveling on that instead of living at
[00:14:37] home and you know pay attention to
[00:14:38] ourselves instead of only work all the
[00:14:41] time if that makes any
[00:14:42] sense it is 7: a.m. here correct I think
[00:14:46] we're on the same we're on the same time
[00:14:47] zone
[00:14:57] right I know exactly try to live life to
[00:14:59] the fullest is makes it s oh you're 8
[00:15:01] a.m. oh you're a little bit in front of
[00:15:02] me okay a little bit in front of me all
[00:15:04] right yeah it's 7:00 a.m. here where I
[00:15:06] am yeah know yeah got a little deep got
[00:15:09] a little deep sometimes it
[00:15:13] does sometimes it does hey when I
[00:15:15] realize how old I am I'm like you know
[00:15:17] what I don't uh don't have as much life
[00:15:19] my dad and all his all their family
[00:15:21] members all the men in my family died uh
[00:15:23] in their early 60s and if that's going
[00:15:26] to happen to me that means I only got 20
[00:15:28] years left I going to put some effort
[00:15:29] into living my life rather than just
[00:15:31] dying while I'm working like every one
[00:15:33] of
[00:15:34] them so instead of that I figured I
[00:15:36] should live my life and be happy have
[00:15:39] some good times with my
[00:15:41] family let's do a regular
[00:15:46] English with o let's do something like
[00:15:50] this an English
[00:15:54] ioria with a box topper
[00:16:01] sometimes we have deep discussions on
[00:16:02] our show
[00:16:04] here all right all right that's like
[00:16:07] yeah that's literally uh 45 minutes is
[00:16:09] for me
[00:16:15] Gustavo okay put those up and we're
[00:16:17] going to call
[00:16:24] that we go that's what we're going to
[00:16:25] call that one
[00:16:39] here we go there you go going to make
[00:16:40] sure that's correct up there going to
[00:16:42] throw that one up for a couple minutes
[00:16:43] here
[00:16:58] [Laughter]
[00:17:04] no worried toar
[00:17:06] power hey you know what I had a I had a
[00:17:09] trip to Mexico where
[00:17:11] um I'm not going to
[00:17:14] lie two weeks after we
[00:17:18] left um the uh vacation place we were at
[00:17:22] the hotel that was the the building next
[00:17:25] to us that we didn't stay in but uh like
[00:17:27] that was like next to us a family died
[00:17:30] of asfixiation because they had uh bad
[00:17:32] carbon monoxide and the carbon monoxide
[00:17:35] monitors weren't working so you know
[00:17:37] that type of thing could really
[00:17:44] happen oh dude seriously that sucks man
[00:17:48] I've been there before I've broken many
[00:17:49] bones and gotten hurt and stuff like
[00:17:51] that so I understand that yeah I know
[00:17:53] man exactly star power so like when you
[00:17:56] make these comments I'm like dude I have
[00:17:58] real actually life experiences that that
[00:18:01] could relate to that so you might want
[00:18:03] to be careful because those things do
[00:18:04] actually happen they may seem crazy but
[00:18:09] they do
[00:18:17] occur why if you got 25 was it a record
[00:18:20] for you of some
[00:18:22] kind did it mean it was a
[00:18:26] record yes awesome see I've had um I
[00:18:30] think the most stitches I've had I think
[00:18:32] it was only like 14 or
[00:18:34] 15 I don't think I've had that
[00:18:37] many oh I don't know about one of them
[00:18:39] because no no 14 14 but I've had a
[00:18:42] surgery where they completely messed up
[00:18:44] and they Stitch through a nerve and I
[00:18:46] and that's why if you see me doing this
[00:18:47] all the time I can't sit right now
[00:18:49] because uh how bad they how bad they
[00:18:51] messed up my uh my
[00:18:53] area 25 is a lucky number oh I like it
[00:18:57] 25 lucky number all right good to know
[00:19:00] lucky number 25 it
[00:19:02] is
[00:19:10] go all
[00:19:12] right let's see I got that over there
[00:19:16] I'm trying to think what to put out
[00:19:20] here for some stuff I got a message what
[00:19:23] did my message
[00:19:25] say oh I didn't get a message it was
[00:19:28] just saying saying you're
[00:19:30] online yes I know I'm online I would put
[00:19:32] myself
[00:19:35] online yeah we have uh we talk about
[00:19:38] some interesting things here sometimes I
[00:19:40] play darts as you can see up on the
[00:19:42] board there I got my little dart board
[00:19:45] sometimes uh we play some interesting
[00:19:47] games we play some adventure games here
[00:19:50] sometimes I'm actually working on
[00:19:52] different one where the adventure is
[00:19:54] going to be the whole story so I think
[00:19:55] tomorrow I might have that partially
[00:19:58] done I don't know if I'm going to have
[00:19:59] it fully Done Yet trying to figure out
[00:20:02] how I was going to do
[00:20:03] it because I have kind of the story idea
[00:20:06] but I was trying to get it done in the
[00:20:09] way I want it I don't know if it's going
[00:20:10] to be done as e as quickly as I was
[00:20:12] expecting unless I buy some maps to use
[00:20:17] instead of build them and see that's my
[00:20:19] thing is like do I buy them to use them
[00:20:21] and then build around that and I think
[00:20:23] that's what I might end up doing not
[00:20:25] really sure
[00:20:29] yeah we could have a Portuguese 101
[00:20:46] class oh wow that's kind I
[00:20:51] like white Hood CRA
[00:20:54] Lin oh I like your uh I like your
[00:20:57] stories here buddy
[00:20:59] quite frankly those are mine when I uh
[00:21:02] when I am in your same State of Mind by
[00:21:04] the
[00:21:05] way when I've been like tired I'm in
[00:21:07] that delusional State my wife's like
[00:21:09] what are you saying I don't know I'm
[00:21:11] probably should be sleeping right now
[00:21:14] there's been more than one occasions
[00:21:15] where I take ambient and she's like you
[00:21:18] had the most ridiculous conversation
[00:21:20] with me last night I'm like what are you
[00:21:21] talking about ridiculous conversation
[00:21:23] just oh you want to know what we talked
[00:21:25] about
[00:21:34] oh your uh your what's his name
[00:21:37] um oh what's his name from
[00:21:42] um Chapelle show what was that guy's
[00:21:47] name the black KKK guy oh what was his
[00:21:50] name that was a that was one of the
[00:21:52] funniest
[00:21:53] skits have you ever seen Dave Chappelle
[00:21:56] the Chappelle show
[00:21:59] yeah when you said that that's I'm
[00:22:01] reading everything you said and that's
[00:22:03] exactly what I'm thinking about I don't
[00:22:04] know
[00:22:06] why I'm picturing that right away right
[00:22:08] now like that's all I'm picturing is
[00:22:10] like get him get him like and everyone's
[00:22:13] looking like what are you talking about
[00:22:15] get him get
[00:22:20] who oh Chappelle was a genius he still
[00:22:23] is with some of the things he
[00:22:25] does not everything every now and again
[00:22:27] he comes out with stuff and you're like
[00:22:29] ah but then again that's what comedians
[00:22:31] do every now and again they come out
[00:22:32] with something you're like all right all
[00:22:34] right not my cup of tea but
[00:22:39] okay what do I have for music here I
[00:22:41] don't like this uh oh we're getting rid
[00:22:43] of this no we're getting rid of
[00:22:46] that
[00:22:49] three we go the adventure game work all
[00:22:53] right so the adventure game works as it
[00:22:56] isn't the frequently last questions but
[00:22:57] you buy your packs here in your packs
[00:23:00] depending on what packs you get you have
[00:23:02] a certain amount of strength you get
[00:23:03] with them so for instance with these
[00:23:06] being this is half a point this would be
[00:23:08] one strength being a box topper but you
[00:23:11] would get one and a half strength to
[00:23:12] start your adventure in the Wasteland
[00:23:14] all right that's just kind of an example
[00:23:16] of how the packs and strength go but
[00:23:18] what you do is you pick a character when
[00:23:20] you pick your character you go through
[00:23:23] each one of these red green blue for
[00:23:28] your boxes to go through to pick out to
[00:23:30] see if you can get anywhere from extra
[00:23:32] three strength or you could get minus
[00:23:35] three strength depends on was picked out
[00:23:37] depending on your character now if you
[00:23:39] get three strength with this instance
[00:23:40] you could have up to four and a half
[00:23:42] strength here which would allow you to
[00:23:44] be able to beat
[00:23:47] three of the 10 bosses here now if you
[00:23:50] had five strength I believe you're able
[00:23:52] to beat four and I believe if you have
[00:23:55] seven strength you're able to beat six
[00:23:57] of the bosses so that's how the game
[00:23:59] goes there and then we do our you pick
[00:24:00] your character and you do a little
[00:24:02] animated
[00:24:04] trip through the
[00:24:08] Wasteland why does it keep doing
[00:24:15] that there you go kind of like a
[00:24:18] character or whatever it
[00:24:22] is you know I don't buy magic but I may
[00:24:25] now
[00:24:28] mom e mom I love you all right run it
[00:24:33] yeah we can uh run something and play
[00:24:34] like what are you saying like run it
[00:24:36] we'll run another one of these and see
[00:24:37] what what we're doing is that what
[00:24:38] you're saying am or am I
[00:24:40] mistaken I'll run uh I'll put another
[00:24:42] thing up here something different yeah
[00:24:45] run this all right we'll run this again
[00:24:47] the Box Hopper and the ioria right there
[00:24:50] going to rerun
[00:24:52] that there you go there you go rerun
[00:24:55] that
[00:24:56] there then you do a little adventure and
[00:24:58] if you're lucky where you beat the boss
[00:25:01] we do this and we Shuffle these pack
[00:25:03] this up here which is a potential of you
[00:25:06] getting packs of cards so maybe you get
[00:25:08] pull out this and on it it says you get
[00:25:10] a lost Cav on set maybe you're like oh
[00:25:12] maybe pull this out and you get a
[00:25:15] Outlaws of Thunder Junction play booster
[00:25:17] but if you beat the boss you get a
[00:25:19] chance of getting an extra pack of cards
[00:25:21] now if you lose to the boss though you
[00:25:24] get sent to the Wasteland you get you
[00:25:26] sent over to the Vault where
[00:25:28] you pick one of these golden packs right
[00:25:30] here and that's just a little thank you
[00:25:32] these packs a little extra thank you
[00:25:33] this is something random of uh of it
[00:25:36] that's it there all right let's try it
[00:25:38] out my friend here we go on our
[00:25:41] Wasteland Adventures so this is one and
[00:25:43] a half

[00:29:44] not really sure oh no it's a
[00:29:50] knight a knight comes running by you

[00:30:07] talking about oh whatever at least he
[00:30:10] left me
[00:30:11] alone and now you're going wandering
[00:30:13] through the Wasteland and you only have
[00:30:14] one and a half strength but it's better
[00:30:16] than being hit by that Knight and having
[00:30:17] more of a problem so you know what let's
[00:30:20] see you do see something else in the
[00:30:21] disy go God another thing come on be a
[00:30:24] friend let's help me let's see what we
[00:30:25] can do here and in our distance you bump
[00:30:27] in this thing and it is not a
[00:30:31] friend a detective comes up to you and
[00:30:35] says hey buddy I have some information
[00:30:37] for you to help you along your trip to
[00:30:39] the
[00:30:40] Wasteland he tells you to go to the left
[00:30:44] around the building because that Vault
[00:30:46] that you're heading towards if you go to
[00:30:48] the left you're going to be away from
[00:30:50] all the danger because there's some
[00:30:51] Danger on the right you take his opinion
[00:30:53] and you go to the left and in that
[00:30:55] process you see some see some few things
[00:30:58] and you turn around see some Ghouls and
[00:31:00] you turn around to run away but then
[00:31:02] that happens you fall and you bump your
[00:31:04] head one of the ghouls gets up to you
[00:31:06] and scrapes you now you're walking
[00:31:08] around and radiated with some issues and
[00:31:10] you only have half a strength that is
[00:31:12] not good but you know what you go I
[00:31:15] think I can make it to that Vault over
[00:31:16] there in the distance so I can be safe
[00:31:18] and recuperate but right before you
[00:31:21] get
[00:31:23] to that
[00:31:26] Vault out in front of you
[00:31:28] jumps the flare of
[00:31:31] loyalties oh

[00:31:38] between different dimensions leaving you
[00:31:41] on the ground right be before the Vault

[00:41:38] Book up there now the big blue book is
[00:41:40] pretty cool because we still have our uh

[00:41:55] let's see if there's anything else you
[00:41:56] guys want to do maybe you want to do oh
[00:41:58] I think I need to add those in I think I
[00:42:00] need to add those in from um
[00:42:03] outside I did forget to add
[00:42:08] them aha I keep forgetting to put those
[00:42:14] in here you go add those to the
[00:42:19] stream maybe you guys would like to do a
[00:42:23] little different thing here for your uh
[00:42:28] Adventure instead of a complete
[00:42:29] adventure maybe you just want to see if
[00:42:31] you can get the boss battle and see what
[00:42:33] your strength can be when you go up
[00:42:34] against the boss so we'll throw out a
[00:42:37] little pogman battle the cards that are
[00:42:40] going to go out with it are going to
[00:42:43] be we're going to put out these for the
[00:42:45] packs
[00:42:46] here actually I'm going to put this out
[00:42:51] one and you know what I'm going to call
[00:42:53] that two slams instead of one normally
[00:42:56] that would be considered one I'm going
[00:42:58] to call that two
[00:43:00] instead we'll throw that down there and
[00:43:02] how the bog man battle works is uh my
[00:43:04] wife actually came up with this one what
[00:43:06] I end up trying to do here is I try to
[00:43:08] slam these down and get as many flipped
[00:43:09] over as possible for you and we want to
[00:43:12] get up to each one of these are worth
[00:43:13] half a half a point so if you can get up
[00:43:18] to 12 16 of them flipped over out of the
[00:43:21] 20 that are in here you can get four
[00:43:24] strength to go against the boss that's
[00:43:26] what we do do that pogman battle game my
[00:43:28] wife thought it was an interesting one
[00:43:30] to do I don't know if you guys like it
[00:43:32] we played a little bit on the other PL
[00:43:33] uh somewhere else and uh it worked
[00:43:35] sometimes but it was a not a big hit it
[00:43:37] was one of those ones that was like an
[00:43:38] intriguing
[00:43:46] hit and we will uh keep going here and
[00:43:49] see what we
[00:43:50] do maybe we'll get some good luck on
[00:43:53] some of our stuff I don't know I haven't
[00:43:55] figured it out yet
[00:43:59] figured it out fully yet we keep doing
[00:44:00] our things having some fun though trying
[00:44:02] our luck and I'll throw out um like I
[00:44:04] said these are giveaways right now is
[00:44:06] the two cards right here as The Show
[00:44:08] Goes the more more kind of the more show
[00:44:10] goes I do upgrade that as The Show Goes
[00:44:12] depending on how how how it
[00:44:15] goes we'll put those back no one wanted
[00:44:20] those all righty we'll
[00:44:23] [Music]
[00:44:25] do h
[00:44:27] let's do
[00:44:30] um maybe somebody would like to look
[00:44:38] at trying to think here we have packs is
[00:44:41] it singles people would like right now
[00:44:44] maybe people want some
[00:44:46] singles let's see let's do maybe a few
[00:44:50] singles start those type of things we
[00:44:52] put that
[00:44:54] here let's do um
[00:44:59] pull out some singles maybe these are
[00:45:02] not super high price ones we'll see if
[00:45:06] you want things like a
[00:45:11] uh start out sth the Vipers
[00:45:15] Fang maybe you want something like that
[00:45:17] for a
[00:45:22] single we select from shop then
[00:45:31] oh no I'll have to remove those that's
[00:45:33] not
[00:45:46] correct right here one
[00:45:51] second I'll get that out there
[00:45:58] all right that's what I'll
[00:45:59] do create new and I'll add
[00:46:03] this put that right
[00:46:05] there
[00:46:11] screenshot
[00:46:15] on
[00:46:17] screen
[00:46:22] single Magic
[00:46:30] go there you go there we go all right go
[00:46:34] through some singles maybe if you want
[00:46:37] them you go it's this right here a
[00:46:40] little
[00:46:42] sth the Vipers
[00:46:45] Fang foil version of that by the way
[00:46:48] maybe you want to spice your decks
[00:46:51] up go through some singles that I have
[00:46:53] here for a minute or so all right I'm
[00:46:55] going to change that to be oh well got
[00:46:58] down pretty slow so we'll change that
[00:47:00] out quickly maybe after are you looking
[00:47:02] for anything that we uh we have I have
[00:47:04] some singles we have games we have all
[00:47:06] kinds of things we're doing I figured
[00:47:07] I'd throw out a couple different things
[00:47:08] just because people were uh not going
[00:47:10] with games right away so I figured maybe
[00:47:12] try out some other ones how you doing
[00:47:14] solo swab thanks for coming
[00:47:17] in but remember we do have our
[00:47:19] adventures if you want to play them you
[00:47:22] can pick the pat yourself to pick the
[00:47:23] adventure game I don't need to do that
[00:47:26] you can do it yourself
[00:47:28] maybe we do this
[00:47:30] here a little POG flip maybe somebody
[00:47:34] would like
[00:47:41] that
[00:47:44] Adventure all right we'll put that
[00:47:48] back and I'll put out another one of the
[00:47:51] adventures since we had really no
[00:47:54] interest in much of any of those so
[00:47:56] let's see for for the
[00:47:57] adventure what we can put
[00:48:00] out let's start it
[00:48:03] with start it with this give him one of
[00:48:07] these one of
[00:48:11] these
[00:48:13] and
[00:48:15] maybe one of
[00:48:19] these it's not a bad idea I
[00:48:23] think all right
[00:48:27] that for a little
[00:48:32] Adventure yes I was thinking a little
[00:48:34] bit about the character card and I'm
[00:48:36] trying to figure out how to get it to
[00:48:37] work a little bit so I think I'd have to
[00:48:39] make some
[00:48:40] adjustments
[00:48:42] um like where you put in the character
[00:48:44] cards and they can
[00:48:46] like so my what your thinking is like
[00:48:49] they to go after a character card they'd
[00:48:51] be they'd be the ones they
[00:48:52] be having the adventure to uh attack
[00:48:56] with correct
[00:49:01] screenshot
[00:49:06] screenshot let me write I I copied it I
[00:49:09] have to I have to reread it because I
[00:49:10] had copied it off to read it again
[00:49:12] because I I read it once and I was like
[00:49:14] I think this is what he means and I had
[00:49:15] to read it
[00:49:16] again let me put this up here let me
[00:49:19] copy that let me go look at what I
[00:49:20] copied off here
[00:49:47] yeah I get what you're saying like you
[00:49:48] have a new creature yeah you start the
[00:49:49] box so so pick the creatures are you
[00:49:52] saying like pick the creature instead of
[00:49:54] uh like the card already has it picked
[00:49:56] on it instead of starting it with they
[00:49:58] pick it with their with their strength
[00:50:00] like this is what you were
[00:50:01] saying if I was understanding that right
[00:50:26] yeah so I would have a random character
[00:50:28] card and is this like the charact that's
[00:50:30] what I'm saying like I'm not sure what
[00:50:31] do I do what do I do with the
[00:50:38] character put those back here no want to
[00:50:41] try that so I'll put these
[00:50:44] back you said so if I'm understanding
[00:50:48] right you said do a new box and have a
[00:50:51] new character where like I would pick
[00:50:54] out the new character for some
[00:50:55] randomness but I wasn't sure on what to
[00:50:58] do with that
[00:50:59] character that's where I think I was
[00:51:01] after I read it the second
[00:51:03] time I think I'm understanding a little
[00:51:05] bit of adding it but do we put it in
[00:51:08] where they where you guys are picking it
[00:51:10] out or is it something that I'm picking
[00:51:13] out to do added on to this that's what I
[00:51:16] was confused on I think that's what I
[00:51:18] was confused
[00:51:20] on a new box yeah oh like a whole new
[00:51:24] game like a new box like one of these
[00:51:26] things a new box out of these okay okay
[00:51:28] so add a fourth stage in a way a fourth
[00:51:31] stage with a new
[00:51:33] box ah I get what you're saying yes my
[00:51:36] son had thought about that and I
[00:51:38] actually had had probably about five to
[00:51:40] seven stages because he was the one that
[00:51:42] helped me initially think about this I
[00:51:44] had paired it down to three stages so
[00:51:47] that's that's actually um part of it we
[00:51:49] had a bunch more stages to go through
[00:51:51] actually so he had a he was like you got
[00:51:53] to figure out you pick up a weapon and
[00:51:55] what weapon it is then you're going have
[00:51:57] to attack something and see if you're
[00:51:59] able to beat it and then you're going to
[00:52:01] do this and then you're going to do that
[00:52:02] and you have to pick out of these boxes
[00:52:04] so we did have some of those ideas to do
[00:52:07] but I had to make it a little shorter so
[00:52:08] it wasn't going for a wicked long time
[00:52:11] so that's why we had to pair it down to
[00:52:13] the three so like maybe I could I could
[00:52:15] like switch that's why we had the
[00:52:16] characters here where they have um what
[00:52:19] they are like your friends and whatever
[00:52:21] you get against
[00:52:24] them but that's what I was thinking
[00:52:26] though kind of with the other game
[00:52:27] though is more of the uh the adventure
[00:52:30] that I'm planning though is more like
[00:52:31] that where you're going to go through a
[00:52:33] bunch of stages and maybe you hit a boss
[00:52:35] of some kind that you run into and it's
[00:52:37] going to be a randomized one I don't
[00:52:38] know if it's not necess going to be a
[00:52:39] card but I was planning on trying to
[00:52:41] build it into the adventure game the
[00:52:43] other way I was talking about I think
[00:52:45] that might work the way you were talking
[00:52:46] about there though
[00:52:49] more do a little mystery
[00:52:51] bags for that
[00:52:56] that
[00:53:02] that adding some gears with tokens yes
[00:53:05] exactly like stuff like that that's
[00:53:08] actually what we were planning on doing
[00:53:09] for the longer version of the adventure
[00:53:10] game like where we had to build stuff up
[00:53:12] move through the Wasteland the entire
[00:53:14] time so like You' be um you'd be going
[00:53:16] out and trying to figure out if you can
[00:53:17] get you know you'd be trying to get
[00:53:19] gathered gear gather food gather all
[00:53:21] kinds of stuff because you're going to
[00:53:22] have to go up against things there'll be
[00:53:23] little side quest type stuff to do so
[00:53:26] that's what the other Adventure that I
[00:53:27] was going to have out tomorrow was going
[00:53:29] to be more like I'm trying to get it to
[00:53:31] work with um roll 20s like I was saying
[00:53:35] but I think I'm going to end up either
[00:53:37] one having to buy the um the maps cuz
[00:53:40] they're not hard there not you have to
[00:53:42] build them through a different
[00:53:43] application and it's going to take me
[00:53:45] longer than I was expecting to BU buy M
[00:53:47] build Maps I'm thinking I might need to
[00:53:49] buy some and then the characters I think
[00:53:51] I should be able to use the characters
[00:53:52] that I already have so that's where I'm
[00:53:54] saying I think I have something already
[00:53:56] built for that
[00:53:58] that oh oh we have ours we'll put this
[00:54:01] and put another adventure game
[00:54:05] up let's

[00:55:52] occur so as we have more
[00:55:56] more will be
[00:55:58] done the more will be added like the
[00:56:01] other day I ended up pretty much giving
[00:56:02] away a whole Thunder Junction pack after
[00:56:05] I uh a collector booster pack for the
[00:56:06] most part CU I added a bunch of rears in
[00:56:08] it and then a bunch of other the common
[00:56:10] cards that I had from another pack and
[00:56:12] stuff like that so that's what I'm
[00:56:13] saying like that's why you do that hey
[00:56:14] super thanks for coming in do appreciate
[00:56:21] it I just missed my mouth
[00:56:33] God that's so bad so
[00:56:45] bad oh more random star strength all
[00:56:50] right oh okay so they Clos it at the
[00:56:54] beginning and then their strength would
[00:56:56] be a little different instead of it
[00:56:57] having choosing based on the packs they
[00:57:00] would buy the packs and then they would
[00:57:03] get different Randomness we would remove
[00:57:05] this as a strength amount in a way but
[00:57:07] the randomness would be coming from the
[00:57:10] card that is picked
[00:57:11] out okay okay okay I get what you're
[00:57:15] saying I thought it was like an addition
[00:57:17] thing so we're removing something and
[00:57:19] changing something ah all right all
[00:57:21] right I get it I get it now okay not a
[00:57:24] bad idea on that actually
[00:57:27] not a bad idea on that because then you
[00:57:29] would pick it would be randomized for
[00:57:30] the
[00:57:31] strength that you uh and maybe you get
[00:57:34] higher strength or lower strength you
[00:57:36] know get a chance to get like have us
[00:57:38] you know you know I think the highest
[00:57:39] strength we do uh when we start is I
[00:57:41] always get people as the highest as
[00:57:43] three so we'd have a couple of those in
[00:57:45] a hand and a bunch of the cards you know
[00:57:47] that type of thing I get what you're
[00:57:48] getting at there yeah I think I get what
[00:57:50] you're
[00:57:53] saying PRS packs are the final thing
[00:57:56] with the Vault ah okay okay I like
[00:58:02] it you either get it with the
[00:58:06] Vault or you get the uh other pack or we
[00:58:12] get or do we but when you beat the boss
[00:58:14] you still get the packs
[00:58:17] though and the extra one though that's
[00:58:20] what I'm trying to so we right yeah okay
[00:58:22] yeah all right
[00:58:24] interesting okay yeah
[00:58:27] all right so they would be pretty much
[00:58:29] they I'd be like here's our adventure
[00:58:31] game it's going to be these and if you
[00:58:34] win you get that or these and that if
[00:58:37] you lose we' be putting this off to the
[00:58:39] side they would go through and figure
[00:58:40] out pick out a card for their strength
[00:58:43] on their character then they would go
[00:58:45] through the rest of the adventure seeing
[00:58:46] what happens if they're lucky enough to
[00:58:48] make it through it and see what they
[00:58:50] happens with their boss and then if they
[00:58:53] win they walk away with the packs and
[00:58:56] the extra one and if they lose they get
[00:58:59] the thing over there all right all right
[00:59:01] I I got it now I think I got it
[00:59:03] now black Panda that doesn't seem like
[00:59:07] it can be right they're black and
[00:59:10] white then means you'd be a black bear
[00:59:12] you wouldn't be a
[00:59:19] panda I mean right you'd be a black bear
[00:59:22] not a panda at that
[00:59:25] point or is this like one of those like
[00:59:27] like it's like the opposite of um of
[00:59:30] like oh what is that what is it
[00:59:32] called the movie Powder whatever that
[00:59:35] guy had where his skin was bleach white
[00:59:37] is this like the opposite of that where
[00:59:39] yes albino is this the opposite of the
[00:59:41] albino panda is this is this the
[00:59:43] opposite of
[00:59:44] it like it's all black instead of albino
[00:59:54] [Laughter]
[00:59:56] I'm
[00:59:57] sorry I read the name I'm like huh it's
[01:00:01] intriguing wonder how that one
[01:00:03] [Laughter]
[01:00:07] worked oh
[01:00:09] damn I got problems
[01:00:15] sometimes I got problems
[01:00:19] sometimes all right I'm gonna put this
[01:00:21] one away here no one want of that all
[01:00:24] right we're gonna put this over here
[01:00:26] and let's see what else you guys are

[01:00:30] you haven't gotten a much of stricks
[01:00:31] Haven in there throw a stricks Haven
[01:00:36] with something oh um something different
[01:00:39] something different the St Haven with
[01:00:41] let's do
[01:00:43] that stricks haven with a Forgotten

[01:01:17] there's a lot of fields to fill out
[01:01:20] that's the only problem I can go with
[01:01:21] like an automated one but not always
[01:01:24] happy with it
[01:01:26] there we
[01:01:27] go there you are

[01:09:11] hot
[01:09:14] coco I like it I like
[01:09:23] it all right we're GNA done on this and
[01:09:27] put on something
[01:09:31] different every time I read some of you
[01:09:33] guys names I get good Chuckles you
[01:09:35] always make give me a good laugh always
[01:09:37] give me a good laugh all right we're
[01:09:39] going to do an adventure with an
[01:09:41] ioria blister collector booster now I
[01:09:44] got 24 of these if anybody's
[01:09:48] interested they are an interesting set
[01:09:51] here that I I actually like them a lot I
[01:09:54] actually have opened a good amount of
[01:09:55] ioria because I'm just a fan of um fan
[01:09:58] of them but that being said I have not
[01:10:02] opened any of the blister packs yet have
[01:10:04] not had a chance to no one's wanted to
[01:10:05] go with any of them yet I don't know is
[01:10:07] it I always had I always seem to people
[01:10:09] say they had better luck with blisters
[01:10:11] but then at the same time I've had
[01:10:13] people say they don't like them and they
[01:10:15] hate them so that's a 50/50 on that one
[01:10:17] you
[01:10:18] know I also liked how people thought
[01:10:20] they had better luck because it was uh
[01:10:22] more randomized or something I wasn't
[01:10:24] sure
[01:10:34] take a drink
[01:10:37] there hopefully you are all having a
[01:10:40] good Thursday morning here just getting
[01:10:43] things up and running having some fun
[01:10:45] with you all now
[01:10:48] tomorrow I might have it done I might
[01:10:50] not have it completed we might only be
[01:10:52] in a doing a partial Adventure but we'll
[01:10:54] see
[01:10:56] trying to get it figured out here I
[01:10:58] think what I might not do it I might not
[01:11:00] be doing it uh the digital way until I
[01:11:03] get it figured out completely I might
[01:11:05] have to do it the uh just with dice and
[01:11:07] stuff like that starting out and then
[01:11:10] change to uh doing the Digital Way once
[01:11:14] I have gotten that figured out because
[01:11:15] it looks like
[01:11:17] uh what I've been doing even as a game
[01:11:20] master everybody been saying or the
[01:11:21] dungeon Masters thing I've been more
[01:11:23] actually like writing the whole story in
[01:11:25] the book with all the strength and the
[01:11:26] pluses and minuses that happen with
[01:11:28] things and that seems like it takes a
[01:11:30] bit longer when I was looking at
[01:11:32] everything to do when it comes to the
[01:11:34] story for uh to put it on Roll 20 than I
[01:11:36] was expecting so I'm like that's going
[01:11:38] to take a bit longer maybe I'm like I
[01:11:39] can do the story and have everything
[01:11:41] done easily a lot quicker if I just do
[01:11:44] it maybe with like boxes and uh and not
[01:11:47] get the animations in yet but just have
[01:11:49] it talk about for the time being and
[01:11:51] then I'll get some of the animations and
[01:11:52] everything going for the next like uh
[01:11:54] kind of the next version of it I was
[01:11:58] thinking today the giveaway is that the
[01:12:02] the cards over here we have the UN Lilia
[01:12:06] undefeated slick shot and a little rare
[01:12:08] extended art and a just an added foil in
[01:12:11] case you want to add something in there
[01:12:12] that's what we got for the giveaway and
[01:12:13] generally what I end up doing with
[01:12:14] giveaways is we upgrade them as the day
[01:12:17] goes so the more like I get in sales and
[01:12:19] the more that happens the more we add so
[01:12:21] sometimes I add extra cards sometimes
[01:12:23] the cards get trained out to a pack
[01:12:25] stuff like that and that's what we got
[01:12:26] up there at the moment for starting out
[01:12:28] with the giveaway just a couple things
[01:12:30] from outlaws like a little rare you
[01:12:32] might want maybe you don't I don't
[01:12:35] know
[01:12:37] but with the adventure game one of the
[01:12:40] things that I was thinking though was
[01:12:41] the last thing that I was going to have
[01:12:43] out was something like this like maybe
[01:12:46] something like these is like the kind of
[01:12:47] like the reward we get for uh getting to
[01:12:50] the last to the boss there would
[01:12:52] something like this be intriguing as the
[01:12:54] last thing that you get get to the boss
[01:12:55] in the adventure
[01:12:57] game try to figure I don't know if there
[01:13:00] something you guys want or you think
[01:13:01] that's junk so that's all I'm trying to
[01:13:03] figure out if I'm wasting my time even
[01:13:05] even using that as a uh as my my second
[01:13:09] version of the adventure game a uh as
[01:13:11] like kind of like the ending boss boss
[01:13:14] battle kind of thing what I was thinking
[01:13:16] something like that something big like I
[01:13:18] don't
[01:13:20] know I think I had this already done
[01:13:23] here so let me see
[01:13:25] I think I've already had this put up
[01:13:27] here
[01:13:41] once I did all right right
[01:13:44] here we go and there we
[01:13:47] go know that Adventure you get a pick a

[01:15:15] here we're going to put out you know
[01:15:18] what let's do this why not we'll throw
[01:15:20] out
[01:15:22] these three of those let's get you one
[01:15:25] and a half strength to start your
[01:15:26] adventure in the
[01:15:30] Wasteland then we're going to put it out
[01:15:32] for this for those
[01:15:37] three here's your adventure in the
[01:15:41] Wasteland we're going to put out that
[01:15:44] right there and remember everybody you
[01:15:46] can tell me what you want I don't need
[01:15:47] to keep doing it for you
[01:15:55] and you always are guaranteed your packs
[01:15:57] right here it's just whether or not you
[01:15:59] beat the boss at the end where you if
[01:16:02] you beat the boss we Shuffle these up
[01:16:04] right here and if you pull and then you
[01:16:06] pull out an extra pack of cards from one
[01:16:08] of these so maybe you pull out an ioria
[01:16:10] booster maybe you're lucky and you pull
[01:16:13] out a lost Cavern Exelon set but the
[01:16:16] whole point is if you beat the boss you
[01:16:18] get your chance at pulling out one of
[01:16:19] those extra cards there to see if you
[01:16:22] get a uh an what you get for an extra
[01:16:24] pack of Cs cards to say thank you for
[01:16:26] playing and you beat the boss because
[01:16:28] the boss drops loot whenever you beat
[01:16:30] them but if you get beat by the boss you
[01:16:32] have to stumble back to a vault where
[01:16:34] you get one of those Golden Vault packs
[01:16:36] which is just a little pack of cards of
[01:16:38] some kind that says thank you for
[01:16:40] playing now you always get your packs
[01:16:43] right here it's just whether or not you
[01:16:46] can beat that boss to get the extra one
[01:16:47] for free for the most
[01:16:49] part it's what it is you can get
[01:16:53] yourself a free pack by playing the
[01:16:55] adventure
[01:16:56] game and you always get something free
[01:16:59] when you play it so you're either going
[01:17:01] to get a vault pack Benji or you're
[01:17:03] going to get yourself a free pack of
[01:17:05] magic that's a pretty good deal there
[01:17:06] when you're playing the game and you're
[01:17:07] not paying anything
[01:17:09] extra so that's why I'm saying just let
[01:17:11] me know what packs you want and you
[01:17:12] could potentially do that yourself
[01:17:14] because you're picking exactly what you
[01:17:17] want so let's put out some more you know
[01:17:21] what why not I'm going to throw out
[01:17:23] probably my last Fallout one I took I I
[01:17:26] had this one these were expensive I'm
[01:17:28] not going to lie I wasn't able to find
[01:17:30] these
[01:17:31] cheap I was not able to find these cheap
[01:17:34] so I'm just going to put this one on
[01:17:35] very quickly this is my last one I
[01:17:38] wasn't able to find this cheap that's
[01:17:39] why I'm going to make this three
[01:17:40] strength on the adventure in the
[01:17:42] Wasteland all
[01:17:50] right there we go

[01:27:27] Connor lotion always escapes you ah see
[01:27:30] you know what I'm going to say I'm going
[01:27:32] to make a comment I've said this to my
[01:27:33] wife many times before I don't put
[01:27:36] lotion
[01:27:38] on thank you I do appreciate
[01:27:41] DCd I don't put lotion on and she puts
[01:27:43] lotion on all the time on her hands on
[01:27:45] her arms and whatever else and I don't
[01:27:47] put anything on and I'm going hey you
[01:27:49] ever think that maybe the lotion is
[01:27:52] making your body not able to heal
[01:27:54] correctly and put enough out so that
[01:27:55] your more your Skin's not moisturized
[01:27:57] and maybe you just need to deal with a
[01:27:59] dry skin for like a couple months so
[01:28:01] your body can re
[01:28:03] acclimate no no no I need lotion it's
[01:28:05] always been this way like all right I'm
[01:28:07] not going to argue with you you're my
[01:28:10] wife I'm not arguing I gave my one
[01:28:11] comment and that was
[01:28:14] it like I just asked it
[01:28:16] once it's one of those things like you
[01:28:18] do not do a second time because it's not
[01:28:21] worth it because you know it's going to
[01:28:22] be a battle if you do it a second time
[01:28:26] we're going to put just this thing up
[01:28:27] here just a little double
[01:28:29] Masters
[01:28:35] draft Yeah the uh the when regards to
[01:28:38] the Fallout being expensive it's because
[01:28:39] I bought them I had to buy them
[01:28:41] aftermarket like a like a month or so
[01:28:44] ago and there every box is 400 plus and
[01:28:47] I I was either going to keep it for
[01:28:48] myself or put it into a game but a bunch
[01:28:51] of people were buying it from the other
[01:28:52] thing that I was on um so that's why
[01:28:55] it's been dropped down to how much how
[01:28:57] much is there available now there only
[01:28:59] like a couple
[01:29:03] packs let's throw out this for our
[01:29:05] adventure game and that'll get you one
[01:29:07] strength because that is one of the
[01:29:08] premium packs we call
[01:29:12] that and then we can do a uh maybe we do
[01:29:15] a little um bug flip let's do a bug flip
[01:29:19] let's throw some bug flip out
[01:29:21] [Music]
[01:29:24] for
[01:29:34] two
[01:29:37] wow really that's
[01:29:44] crazy yeah see itchy I don't understand
[01:29:46] it it's one of those things like she's
[01:29:48] like my hands are dry and I'm looking at
[01:29:49] mine I'm
[01:29:50] like I've been had my hands in salt
[01:29:53] water for the last last three days cuz I
[01:29:55] was fishing all day and mine aren't and
[01:29:57] they were in saltwater what am I doing
[01:30:04] different yeah I know it's one of those
[01:30:06] things where well it's like your body
[01:30:08] acclimates to having something so if
[01:30:11] it's not there then it doesn't know what
[01:30:14] to do and then it dries out which is
[01:30:18] what I always thought thought was
[01:30:20] happening but so be it you know they
[01:30:22] once to look you she young and beautiful
[01:30:25] oh chapstick you never use chapstick
[01:30:27] chapstick literally has stuff in it to
[01:30:30] dry your lips out
[01:30:32] Connor like I can't remember what it is
[01:30:35] I have to look up the name of the the
[01:30:36] the um the chemical in it but it
[01:30:38] literally dries your lips
[01:30:41] out so it's like what is the point of
[01:30:43] using
[01:30:44] chapstick If part of it dries you out
[01:30:46] dries out dries out your lips I there's
[01:30:48] there's um there's some there's a
[01:30:50] chemical in there that dries out your
[01:30:51] lips it'll keep them moist for the time
[01:30:54] that it's on there because it keeps
[01:30:55] everything in there and it makes like a
[01:30:56] like a seal over it but once that thing
[01:30:59] dries off it dries your lips out
[01:31:00] horribly and that's what happens with
[01:31:02] that's why like that you know whatever I
[01:31:05] don't know if they changed it they might
[01:31:06] have changed the chemical that was uh
[01:31:09] when I was in college so that was like
[01:31:11] 20ish years
[01:31:15] ago so they may have changed that
[01:31:17] chemical out by
[01:31:22] now interesting Carmax on your eyes to
[01:31:25] stwake is that like
[01:31:28] a oh yeah neeva ones are good those ones
[01:31:30] are actually pretty good there are some
[01:31:32] that are good and some are just junk
[01:31:34] that's interesting about the carax under
[01:31:35] the eyes is it because it's like minty
[01:31:37] or something to keep you
[01:31:39] awake cuz I I might I might need to try
[01:31:42] that at some
[01:31:43] point military is rough sometimes yes I
[01:31:47] can understand that I know people that
[01:31:48] were in it I I was not able to join when
[01:31:52] I I have medical issues
[01:31:54] so I wasn't able to join I actually
[01:31:57] wanted to do some stuff myself but
[01:31:59] didn't have the
[01:32:00] opportunity I'm going to put this out
[01:32:02] here
[01:32:05] for I know a lot of people that were in
[01:32:07] it
[01:32:12] though yes the blue one the blue Bliss X
[01:32:15] thing the medicated one is the only one
[01:32:17] that I will use that's the only one that
[01:32:19] never dried my lips
[01:32:21] out yes that one the blue two where I
[01:32:25] have one of those around here somewhere
[01:32:27] I have one of them around here somewhere
[01:32:30] [Laughter]
[01:32:33] also I don't know what I did with it I
[01:32:35] know it's somewhere around here I think
[01:32:37] it's in my bedroom probably on my nights
[01:32:39] in or on the floor next to
[01:32:42] it let's throw out a different flash
[01:32:46] sale I have a did I put the plog flip
[01:32:49] out no was it the plog flip no it wasn't
[01:32:51] it was uh it was something different we
[01:32:52] do three one I can't do three so we'll
[01:32:55] do two 312 32
[01:33:04] one so the Fallout packs um they were a
[01:33:09] severely under printed for what was
[01:33:12] wanted I ordered um here's the example I
[01:33:17] ordered um 24 boxes or wait four cases I
[01:33:21] ordered four cases
[01:33:24] of of it so 6 * 4 what 20 12 24 yeah 24
[01:33:31] boxes I was right sorry I ordered 24
[01:33:33] boxes I
[01:33:35] got
[01:33:37] two everyone that I know that ordered
[01:33:39] similarly got one or
[01:33:42] two so no one got anything they weren't
[01:33:45] available the only place they ended up
[01:33:47] being available people bought them was
[01:33:49] on Amazon um and then everybody bought
[01:33:52] all the ones up on Amazon on because
[01:33:54] they were under the TCG player price and
[01:33:57] then they all spiked up to 400 plus and

[01:45:42] buddy once again you're not really sure
[01:45:44] what's going on so special guests are
[01:45:46] really hard to come by in any of the
[01:45:49] packs when you open them they're very
[01:45:51] rare on a and you don't generally get
[01:45:52] them and normally they're expensive
[01:45:54] cards too um I'm not sure on this one
[01:45:57] but being Mystic something I'm guessing
[01:45:59] it is because it's a counter Target
[01:46:02] spell because you get can you get a
[01:46:03] counter the target spell in this so I'm
[01:46:05] guessing this is a nice this is a a nice
[01:46:08] card there like a good high one then
[01:46:10] with this being the sword of
[01:46:11] wealth you your plus plus on your

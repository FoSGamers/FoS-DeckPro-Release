It seems like my mail was being delivered to my old address for some reason even though I had forwarded on and I just got a chunk of things given to me from that new owner. Can I get a new shipping label so I can send it back to them and also there was something having to do with a giveaway one that was returned to me too and I need a new label for that but one that hopefully says that I can ship it with 3 oz or more cuz it said it was overweight or something on the package which I don't understand.

I moved about 1 month ago and the new owners of my old house just gave mail that was being delivered to them (for who knows how long) to my old neighbor. This mail includes the returned package and other items I have been missing. I have mail forwarding at the post office to my PO box so this should not have happened and explains a lot now. Please give me a new label so I can print it and ship the item back to the buyer. I think we are talking about aetherdragon. and also the giveaway that was missing was returned there to. If I can get a label for that I would appreciate it but it need one that is for 6 ounces since it says it was overweight I guess. Sorry for the headache and getting annoyed I thought someone was trying to pull a quick one on me. I'll have to have my old neighbor check with them regularly in case my mail has come... you think they would say something sooner than 1 month later...

I'm not going to provide any attachments. I'm just providing an option of an idea to help figure out what the giveaway run was, because the labels all kind of messed up on it. And that's what I think the issue was. They probably took it and ripped the label, guessing due to, I don't know, whatever their issue was. And I can't read everything. That's why I'm saying I need some of your help. I know there was an email that somebody had sent, that one of the whatnot support had sent me, saying a giveaway for something that somebody had not received. And I was trying to figure out what it was, so I can send it back to them, since I got the best stuff back and it wasn't in condition enough for me to know who it was or figure out who it was.

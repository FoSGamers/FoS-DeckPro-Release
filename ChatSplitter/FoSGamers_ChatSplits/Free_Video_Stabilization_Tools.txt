How do I adjust frames per second in DaVinci resolve


[2025-01-01 17:19:43] ChatGPT:
Adjusting frames per second (FPS) in DaVinci Resolve is essential for matching your project's frame rate to your footage or export requirements. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### **1. Set Project FPS**
The frame rate of your project must be set before adding any media to the timeline. Once media is added, the project frame rate cannot be changed.

#### Steps:
1. Open **DaVinci Resolve** and go to the **Project Manager**.
2. Right-click on the project thumbnail and select **Project Settings** (or create a new project).
3. In the **Project Settings** window:
   - Go to the **Master Settings** tab.
   - Under the **Timeline Frame Rate** dropdown, choose your desired FPS (e.g., 24, 30, 60 FPS).
   - Set the **Playback Frame Rate** to match the timeline frame rate.
4. Click **Save** to apply the settings.

### **2. Adjust Timeline FPS for an Existing Project**
If media has already been added, you can't directly change the timeline FPS. However, you can create a new project and import your existing timeline with the desired FPS.

#### Steps:
1. Create a new project.
2. Set the desired FPS in the **Project Settings** before importing any media.
3. Import your existing timeline:
   - Go to the **File** menu and select **Import Project**.
   - Adjust or rescale footage if necessary to match the new frame rate.

### **3. Change Clip FPS**
If individual clips have a different FPS than the timeline, you can adjust their frame rate for better synchronization.

#### Steps:
1. Right-click the clip in the **Media Pool**.
2. Select **Clip Attributes**.
3. In the **Clip Attributes** window:
   - Under **Video**, find the **Frame Rate** dropdown.
   - Choose the desired FPS and click **OK**.
4. Add the clip to the timeline. It will now play at the adjusted frame rate.

### **4. Export with a Different FPS**
If you need to export your project at a different frame rate, you can specify this in the Deliver page.

#### Steps:
1. Go to the **Deliver** page.
2. In the **Render Settings** panel:
   - Click **Video**.
   - Set the **Frame Rate** dropdown to your desired FPS.
3. Complete other export settings and render the project.

---

### **Summary**
- Set the project frame rate before adding media to the timeline.
- Use **Clip Attributes** to adjust individual clip frame rates.
- Export at a different FPS in the Deliver page if needed.

By following these steps, you can effectively adjust FPS in DaVinci Resolve to suit your project's needs.

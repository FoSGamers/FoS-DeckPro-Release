### Key Points of the Enhanced Code

1. **Conversation Context**: The `conversationContext` array stores the full conversation context, including both user and AI messages.
2. **Prompt Construction**: Each time a new message is sent, the prompt includes the entire conversation context, ensuring that the AI has the necessary context to generate a coherent response.
3. **Stop Sequences**: The `"stop"` parameter is used to instruct the model to stop generating further text when encountering certain sequences (e.g., "User:", "AI:").

### Summary

1. **Enhanced Code**: Added the ability to maintain and use conversation context to simulate the "continue" functionality.
2. **Conversation History**: The full conversation history is sent with each new message to provide context for the AI.
3. **Stop Sequences**: Included stop sequences to ensure clean conversation termination.

### Hotkeys
- **Iterate, Improve, Evolve**: Test and adjust the prompt construction and stop sequences for more natural interactions.
- **Question**: Are there any specific features or improvements you'd like to see in this implementation?
- **Validate**: Ensure the application handles different conversation lengths and edge cases gracefully.

This enhanced version will allow users to continue their conversations seamlessly, similar to the experience on the browser.

[00:02:30] happened um long story short um I went
[00:02:34] to a private high school I had a good
[00:02:36] experience after um after I join the
[00:02:39] wrestling team my sophomore year because
[00:02:41] uh I ended up having my coach was a
[00:02:42] police officer but my freshman year and
[00:02:45] um partly into my sophomore year uh
[00:02:47] wasn't so great um there are some pretty
[00:02:49] bad people bad men uh touched me
[00:02:52] inappropriately um I told my mom I
[00:02:54] didn't want to be there many times and
[00:02:57] she decided over the weekend before the
[00:02:59] holiday that she need to clean
[00:03:00] everything up then she wanted to yell at
[00:03:02] us about not doing stuff and then she
[00:03:04] tried to say oh I it's I didn't I just
[00:03:06] wanted to get everything clean I'm like
[00:03:07] how about you just apologize for yelling
[00:03:09] at us and she wouldn't I'm like you
[00:03:10] can't even apologize for anything you
[00:03:12] haven't apologized even for when you
[00:03:14] ignored me when I told you I hated that
[00:03:16] school because there was bad men there
[00:03:18] and instead I went there and one of them
[00:03:20] molested me because you stopped and you
[00:03:22] ignored me instead of that she goes I
[00:03:24] said sorry when you told me that I'm
[00:03:25] like no you never did you said oh and
[00:03:27] walked away and she did the same thing
[00:03:29] this time she said oh walked away then
[00:03:31] went and yelled at my wife saying why
[00:03:34] did you do this or how could you do this
[00:03:36] to me or something along that lines
[00:03:37] never forgive you I'll never forgive you
[00:03:39] and then it then um started screaming
[00:03:42] really
[00:03:42] crazy and actually swiped up my son when
[00:03:45] he went to go get his water bottle um
[00:03:48] and I was like that's it I'm done we're
[00:03:49] packing our stuff I'll be out in the
[00:03:51] morning and they actually like no [ __ ]

[00:08:14] nine 10 grip a number between one and 10
[00:08:15] buddy I was pretty upset like just the
[00:08:17] way they acted towards the children and
[00:08:19] how they did how they handled it but I
[00:08:21] realized that when somebody doesn't have
[00:08:23] remorse they're not going to

[01:07:03] number between one and 10 my friend yeah
[01:07:05] one two three four five six seven eight
[01:07:07] nine 10 yeah long story short just one
[01:07:10] is
[01:07:11] um uh I went to a school that somebody
[01:07:15] there was an older person that did
[01:07:17] something wrong one two three four five
[01:07:19] six seven and because of that um you
[01:07:22] know I I I addressed it with my mom at
[01:07:25] one Point she never acknowledged it
[01:07:27] never even apologized or anything but
[01:07:28] shepher in Spears because one of the
[01:07:30] things that she did was every time I
[01:07:31] told her I needed to leave because the
[01:07:33] place was bad and there were bad people
[01:07:35] there she ignored me um so it got to the
[01:07:38] point where uh you know something ended
[01:07:40] up happening and I ended up joining a
[01:07:42] team a sports team where the coach was a
[01:07:43] police officer then I never had any
[01:07:45] issues after that um but um I I she was
[01:07:49] yelling at us about something and she
[01:07:50] goes I always apologize I'm like no you
[01:07:52] don't you've never even apologized when
[01:07:53] I got freaking molested because you were
[01:07:56] you because I was in school and you kept
[01:07:57] telling me to go to the school and I
[01:07:58] kept telling you there are bad people
[01:07:59] there and I don't want to be there and
[01:08:01] she goes yes I did I said I'm sorry I'm
[01:08:03] like no you said oh turned around and
[01:08:05] walked away and this time she looked at
[01:08:07] me and goes turned around and walks to
[01:08:10] my wife and yells at her and the other
[01:08:11] room says I'm never going to forget you
[01:08:13] for this and then tries to attack my uh
[01:08:16] oldest
[01:08:16] son so I was like we're gone you're nuts
[01:08:20] we're out of here you're not touching my
[01:08:23] kid so instead of pretty much she was
[01:08:25] put in a situation where she had to act
[01:08:27] like a human and apologize for her
[01:08:30] shitty Behavior where she did not
[01:08:31] protect her son and she has not even
[01:08:34] been able to do that since I told her
[01:08:35] when I was in
[01:08:37] college this is probably about the
[01:08:39] fourth time I made a comment about it
[01:08:41] but it was mainly because she was being
[01:08:43] saying I apologize all the time I'm like
[01:08:45] you have never apologized to me about
[01:08:46] anything in your life even the largest
[01:08:49] thing you should apologize to somebody
[01:08:50] about and you've never done it and blew
[01:08:52] her blew her
[01:08:54] mind oh yeah yeah oh yeah well when she
[01:08:57] tried to hit my
[01:08:58] child stop him that's or like grab him
[01:09:02] and like whatever it was I was like
[01:09:03] we're done you're not putting your hands
[01:09:05] on my
[01:09:07] kid but hey [ __ ] happens I've been
[01:09:10] through worse in
[01:09:12] life we'll get through it let's put out
[01:09:14] some more giveaway uh some more uh
[01:09:18] secret layer so I've been through some
[01:09:20] different things and difficult stuff in
[01:09:22] my
[01:09:23] life but I always came out somehow
[01:09:26] better I don't really know why but just
[01:09:30] because I for the most part I'm like you
[01:09:32] know what screw it those people or that

[01:58:16] to throw it on for
[01:58:18] 22 if you want
[01:58:20] it that way get some discount off there
[01:58:23] and the discount for the uh shipping

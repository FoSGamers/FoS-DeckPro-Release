[00:06:16] Mohawk I have not gotten anything back
[00:06:18] from you I'll let you know that um like
[00:06:21] I said the post office hasn't sent
[00:06:23] anything back but every now and again
[00:06:24] they get to a certain place and it's
[00:06:25] like I don't want to deliver this they
[00:06:28] send it and turn around and send it that
[00:06:30] um I've had that happen more than once
[00:06:32] recently um I'm actually getting rather
[00:06:35] annoyed with it like somebody like goes
[00:06:37] uh yeah my address is a PO Box I don't
[00:06:39] know why they returned it saying the
[00:06:41] address is not accurate I'm like what
[00:06:43] yeah I know that was weird too I thought
[00:06:44] it was weird too I'm like how do they
[00:06:45] get it in wrong with a PO Box like the
[00:06:47] the address and everything on the
[00:06:48] thing's right for the PO Box yeah I know
[00:06:50] I'm confused so they've been a little
[00:06:53] bad recently so uh like uh I'm guessing
[00:06:56] it's going to probably show back up in a
[00:06:58] few days here
[00:07:01] if you haven't got it that's for
[00:07:03] everybody by the
[00:07:05] way if you notice anything's not showing
[00:07:07] up um I've just noticed
[00:07:09] recently that
[00:07:14] um know shipping UPS
[00:07:18] USPS has not
[00:07:20] been the most reliable
[00:07:24] recently and that's all that's all I'm

[02:10:22] uh I don't know if they'll work there
[02:10:24] with them with the with what I am with
[02:10:25] my commander here because it's black and
[02:10:28] blue so that wasn't unknown on that one
[02:10:30] that was a maybe on the smothering tide
[02:10:32] we have Marsh

[02:10:35] morgal knife I'll do using that Kinder
[02:10:38] Discovery oh that's my other toxic delu

[02:10:42] to throw in there I'm definitely using
[02:10:45] camil the inner Sun we have some Maze of
[02:10:48] I the Dulan orary colossal Hammer

[02:11:15] another nice one then maybe a stifle
[02:11:19] little bribery
[02:11:21] maybe a little Zenithar King Guild King
[02:11:24] Pin delay we
[02:11:26] have then yeah there we go blood money
[02:11:31] and drown in the lock would be another
[02:11:33] nice one too so those were all the cards
[02:11:36] that I had that I was thinking of
[02:11:38] using so I just need to cut cut them
[02:11:40] down to
[02:11:43] uh my 100 card deck I put all the cards
[02:11:46] together that I could use in it I just
[02:11:49] need to cut it down so if if anybody
[02:11:51] yeah if somebody wants to work with me
[02:11:52] later and help me out a little bit I
[02:11:54] wouldn't mind assistance I always like
[02:11:55] having gaining more
[02:12:05] knowledge always is helpful to know
[02:12:09] more all right so that's that that's my
[02:12:12] uh stuff from the deck there what do you
[02:12:13] guys think so far it's a pretty good
[02:12:15] start right
[02:12:23] it's a pretty good
[02:12:25] start so I got I figure I gotta break
[02:12:27] some of that
[02:12:30] down oh nice one with saurin nice see we
[02:12:34] should um yeah I have to break that down
[02:12:36] so I can get it to my 100
[02:12:39] cards and then um yes it's magic
[02:12:42] gathering Royal banana and then we'll um
[02:12:45] yeah we'll figure out what what to do

[02:17:50] in a sleep leave here for your
[02:17:52] uh other one there thank you my friend
[02:17:55] let me get your name written down
[02:18:01] Mahaya thank you my friend for jumping
[02:18:03] in on that I do appreciate
[02:18:10] it yeah see that's what it is like with
[02:18:12] duskborn I haven't found any must need
[02:18:14] hat cards I all right I'm going to say
[02:18:17] this you're very welcome Mahaya the
[02:18:19] lands that are in dusk
[02:18:21] are going to end up being bigger than
[02:18:24] people expect because the lands let me
[02:18:28] pull up one of the lands
[02:18:31] here like the special lands give me a
[02:18:36] second could have find the name of
[02:18:40] it FL there we go that's a good one
[02:18:43] let's find the name of
[02:18:45] one I put this away so I have
[02:18:49] room there we go we're going to zoom
[02:18:52] back
[02:18:53] out there we
[02:18:55] go yes they come in untapped if if you
[02:18:59] cons uh if you have a
[02:19:05] um no what happened go away they come in
[02:19:09] untapped if you have a
[02:19:15] uh land already out so
[02:19:23] so here let me um I'm going to do this
[02:19:25] here I'm just going to make it bigger
[02:19:27] I'm going to put this in here and to
[02:19:28] make it so that everybody can see
[02:19:31] it so for instance this card all
[02:19:36] right look at that read that tell me
[02:19:39] that doesn't seem like that's going to
[02:19:40] be nuts you add an island and then you
[02:19:44] add
[02:19:45] also an I mean you add an island if you
[02:19:48] have any of the planes or islands and
[02:19:51] control so it doesn't say basic it
[02:19:53] doesn't say anything it just is plain or
[02:19:55] Island so these come in untapped
[02:19:57] allowing you to use any one you
[02:20:02] want uh yeah wrap the hot dog if you
[02:20:05] were going to hot dog in water if you
[02:20:07] wrap the hot dog in a wet paper towel
[02:20:10] and then put it in there um if you want
[02:20:13] to do it quickly for like um I think
[02:20:17] it's like 30 to seconds to 2 minutes
[02:20:21] depending on how how hot it is because
[02:20:22] it's already
[02:20:26] pre-cooked oh reverse the colors of it
[02:20:29] well they have one that does reverse
[02:20:31] color has is different colors but I'm
[02:20:33] just saying this is one of them that I
[02:20:35] was saying I think this is a good card
[02:20:37] because there it comes in
[02:20:39] untapped I did just see sh the scissors
[02:20:46] yes yes on the rooms yes are sleeping on
[02:20:49] some of the rooms too definitely are
[02:20:51] sleeping on some of the
[02:20:54] rooms yes Sab it first so it'll seene
[02:20:58] correct but anyways that's why I think
[02:21:01] some of these CS are being slept on you
[02:21:04] know but anyways that's why I uh one of
[02:21:07] them that I was pointing out I thought
[02:21:09] that was like a really good card I'm
[02:21:10] like wow that's like weird that that's
[02:21:12] uh being slept on there
[02:21:25] you know that
[02:21:26] anyways that's why
[02:21:31] uh the red Mythic one I'll have to take
[02:21:33] a look at
[02:21:35] that the lands are nice see that's what
[02:21:37] I mean the lands are good the new rooms
[02:21:39] I'm not sure on the new rooms I have to
[02:21:41] check one of those out here what's
[02:21:42] what's the room
[02:21:46] here uh what is one of those rooms
[02:21:55] need a name one is
[02:21:58] uh oh like the funeral
[02:22:02] room whenever a creature you control
[02:22:05] dies each opponent loses one life and
[02:22:07] you gain one life when you unlock this
[02:22:10] door return all creature cards from your
[02:22:13] graveyard to the battlefield like what
[02:22:17] that card's insane
[02:22:20] like that card and you're going to have
[02:22:23] to turn your head sideways but that's
[02:22:25] insane you get to return everything to
[02:22:26] the
[02:22:32] battlefield having all the doors open
[02:22:34] you win yes I do remember that one I
[02:22:36] have that blue one actually I do have
[02:22:39] that blue one in the buy now by the
[02:22:45] way I think I have that here give me a
[02:22:47] second
[02:22:55] blue one oh I thought I had the blue one
[02:22:57] maybe I had the red
[02:23:01] one I thought I had the blue one oh I do
[02:23:04] have the blue
[02:23:05] one the elevator
[02:23:08] elevator Central elevator
[02:23:12] yes oh
[02:23:17] no this one at the beginning of your
[02:23:21] upkeep surveil one you win the game if
[02:23:24] there are eight or more different names
[02:23:29] among unlocked doors of rooms you
[02:23:36] control I mean that's pretty cool you
[02:23:38] have four you need four room cards so
[02:23:40] these will be considered two rooms I'm
[02:23:42] believing
[02:23:43] right so yeah I mean that's pretty
[02:23:47] cool so I mean that's pretty sweet so
[02:23:50] you can win win the game with four cards
[02:23:51] and having them all open
[02:23:54] so it is pretty cool I have to agree the
[02:23:57] rooms are pretty cool but those
[02:24:00] lands those lands I think are are
[02:24:02] spiking are going to spike up so like
[02:24:04] right now some of them like 16 bucks I
[02:24:06] expect those ones to be$ 25 to $50 in
[02:24:09] the next two months
[02:24:20] oh yeah it would go like that yeah that
[02:24:23] would make sense that would definitely
[02:24:25] go
[02:24:31] off I do not have any play Ms for sale
[02:24:34] I'm sorry Jeremiah um I thought about
[02:24:37] get a minute before dmor uh Bloomberg
[02:24:40] well I've been talking about a couple
[02:24:42] different ones well uh sets with the
[02:24:44] people in our in our stream here so
[02:24:45] that's all
[02:24:51] darn starn that does not I don't think
[02:24:55] so doesn't sound familiar to me so I'm
[02:24:57] guessing that's a
[02:24:59] no but let me double check because I do
[02:25:02] have random cards and that I don't
[02:25:04] remember what they look like always
[02:25:06] sometimes I need to go and look up them
[02:25:25] no I do not have anything from Warhammer
[02:25:27] do not have anything from Warhammer
[02:25:29] sorry I actually got in after that and
[02:25:31] I've been intrigued with the Warhammer
[02:25:33] myself just because I had played it back
[02:25:34] in the day when I was
[02:25:35] younger was one of those ones like oh

[02:27:43] giveaway right there two of those cards
[02:27:45] to say thank you for hanging out with us
[02:27:47] this moment
[02:27:50] then we're going to go and hang out with
[02:27:51] a
[02:27:54] friend thought about doing my your own
[02:27:57] pre-concert sorcery
[02:28:01] maybe for sorcer is free to get you in
[02:28:04] just get you
[02:28:06] attached one h a
[02:28:10] drug I don't know you know that
[02:28:13] [Laughter]
[02:28:18] movie all right
[02:28:22] yeah yeah no actually not a bad idea I
[02:28:24] think I could do a some precons for um
[02:28:26] for sorcery that way I can uh some
[02:28:28] people there be interested who could
[02:28:29] jump in on it that's not a bad
[02:28:32] [Laughter]
[02:28:36] idea well there I mean the other day we
[02:28:38] were going in with the uh with our
[02:28:40] Sphinx it was a Oh was a fully
[02:28:43] man and I'm like oh my God there's so
[02:28:45] many young people that have no idea what
[02:28:47] I'm talking about
[02:28:52] oh which Commander for Dorn is the best
[02:28:55] oh I don't know all right so here this
[02:28:57] is what we do have we do have them here
[02:28:59] so this is what we I haven't decided yet
[02:29:02] I haven't decided on that yet so we
[02:29:05] have our one here which is
[02:29:08] bavo Harvester of souls I like that one
[02:29:11] because I I like black and red
[02:29:12] personally where you get the ward and
[02:29:15] they have to pay life it's not something
[02:29:16] it's actually Ward with paying life so I
[02:29:18] I like how that works there
[02:29:20] and then you get a one-1 counter
[02:29:22] whenever an opponent loses life each
[02:29:25] turn I mean that's pretty big there but
[02:29:27] then you got um we got our other one
[02:29:29] here which is our I don't know about
[02:29:33] this one the the jump scare landfall
[02:29:35] whenever you control manifest dreed if
[02:29:37] this first time ability resolve this
[02:29:38] turn otherwise you may turn a permit you
[02:29:40] control face up so you get a put a two
[02:29:43] two creature onto your graveyard and
[02:29:46] turn it face up when and pay its Mona
[02:29:47] value whenever you want I don't know
[02:29:49] maybe
[02:29:53] walk walk Hard
[02:29:56] CRS then we have death toll I do like
[02:29:59] death toll yes Walk Hard yes some
[02:30:03] yep
[02:30:05] whenever winter attacks mil three cards
[02:30:09] that's not a bad one at the beginning of
[02:30:10] your end step you may Exile number of
[02:30:12] cards from your
[02:30:14] graveyard uh with four or more cards
[02:30:17] among them if you do put a permanent
[02:30:19] card from among onto the battlefield
[02:30:20] with a finality counter not a bad one
[02:30:23] there but yeah miracle workers and
[02:30:26] endless I think were the two big ones at
[02:30:29] the beginning of your upkeep surveil two
[02:30:31] each opponent's each enchantment card in
[02:30:34] your hand has Miracle this its Miracle
[02:30:36] cost is equal to its Mana cost reduced
[02:30:39] by four I mean that's pretty good if
[02:30:41] you're going to be playing a lot of
[02:30:42] enchantments for The Miracle Worker so I
[02:30:45] mean I think it would be between endless
[02:30:47] punishment or Miracle Worker
[02:30:52] I don't yeah well I don't know what
[02:30:54] cards are exactly in them I mean it
[02:30:56] tells you a good amount of the cards
[02:30:57] that are in them but not all of
[02:31:00] them like you know Lord of pain that's a
[02:31:03] nice one to pick up no secrets
[02:31:07] hidden I can pull I could find the uh
[02:31:10] the deck list
[02:31:12] online but uh that would take me a
[02:31:15] minute to
[02:31:16] find but yeah that's um those are those
[02:31:18] there and our giveaway winner went today

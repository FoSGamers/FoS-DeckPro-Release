20240507

[00:00:00] I don't know I don't know if I'm woring
[00:00:01] oh crap I think this goes too quickly
[00:00:04] let me fix that dang it why are those
[00:00:07] doing that every minute it's not
[00:00:09] supposed to do it every
[00:00:11] minute schedule
[00:00:13] messages do that
[00:00:17] that
[00:00:18] [Music]
[00:00:19] do this
[00:00:21] one
[00:00:23] yes
[00:00:27] 10 that
[00:00:34] that there you go and that was
[00:00:40] that there you go I think that was what
[00:00:42] it supposed to be let's see if that does
[00:00:43] it I don't know we'll see if that works
[00:00:45] yeah we'll try something out new
[00:00:47] here I did not make it through your list
[00:00:50] yet
[00:00:52] Quantum what are you do Maring that
[00:00:54] bones I've gotten through a little bit
[00:00:55] of it um I've not gotten through all of
[00:00:57] it so sorry about that I I was a little
[00:01:00] bit busy with random stuff that has
[00:01:01] gotten up come up with um life and work
[00:01:04] recently I didn't get to get through it
[00:01:05] all as quickly as I normally would have
[00:01:07] what is he looking at
[00:01:10] William okay make sure he doesn't bark
[00:01:12] at random stuff
[00:01:14] here yeah I'm sorry about that man there
[00:01:16] was just a few random things that came
[00:01:17] up and uh yeah yeah life happen stuff
[00:01:20] quite frankly I've been um work has been
[00:01:23] weird that it's been I've been they've
[00:01:24] been pulling me into a lot of meetings
[00:01:25] because I know a lot about one of the
[00:01:27] products and we're doing a lot of stuff
[00:01:28] with the product now and I'm like the
[00:01:30] subject matter expert on it I guess you
[00:01:32] would call me so I've been pulling in a
[00:01:34] lot of stuff and it's end up being just
[00:01:36] other stuff outside of work that's just
[00:01:39] just takes up other time yeah you know
[00:01:41] what I mean but anyways I had a little
[00:01:43] idea of doing a little upgrade for our
[00:01:45] adventure game here so what I was going
[00:01:47] to be doing was I was thinking what I
[00:01:49] was going to do here was going to trade
[00:01:50] some of the big characters out to start
[00:01:52] first out with and I was thinking I was
[00:01:54] in a trade out like maybe flare
[00:01:57] loyalties maybe Watcher in the water
[00:02:01] maybe we'll SW trade out
[00:02:03] Calta and we'll leave it there like that
[00:02:06] no I didn't know or bow Masters was in
[00:02:08] there as a one look at
[00:02:10] that that's not even supposed to be in
[00:02:12] there as a one and instead what I was
[00:02:14] going to do was put ones in like say
[00:02:16] like we'll put one out five a low eight
[00:02:20] now was three of them we took out and
[00:02:22] then let's put in a um one that can be
[00:02:25] beat here a three we'll put a three in
[00:02:28] there so we have a few more that can be
[00:02:31] beat that way when you're starting the
[00:02:34] adventure now what we'll do here is live
[00:02:35] ad the uh the uh animated one what we'll
[00:02:39] end up doing then I think is I'll take
[00:02:41] out and we'll start out where the Loot
[00:02:44] drop obviously you know something small
[00:02:46] as the adventure goes and it just grows
[00:02:48] and gets bigger as uh the more it goes
[00:02:51] and the bigger a person same person
[00:02:52] jumps in and wants to play a bunch of
[00:02:54] the adventures what would end up
[00:02:55] happening is I'd end up switching you
[00:02:56] know say after you play one of them all
[00:02:57] right well it's going to get a little
[00:02:58] tougher this time so so we'll switch out
[00:03:00] one of the characters with something
[00:03:01] else and you'll have a little tougher uh
[00:03:03] tougher challenge the next time is how I
[00:03:05] figured we'll uh we'll do that there but
[00:03:07] you always get your Vault pack over
[00:03:09] there which I'm sorry isn't even lit up
[00:03:11] right now so you can't see it so you go
[00:03:13] you always get one of these golden
[00:03:14] little Vault packs here whenever you
[00:03:16] play it to say thank you for playing
[00:03:19] with us and yeah I don't know what what
[00:03:21] your thoughts are thought it was a
[00:03:23] decent idea my wife thought it was an
[00:03:25] intriguing idea I was just finishing
[00:03:27] sleeving up the other ones so that you
[00:03:29] could see them all the
[00:03:30] same oh hopefully you're having a good
[00:03:33] day and what I'll do is get something up
[00:03:34] and running right
[00:03:36] now let's throw out
[00:03:39] our screenshot so you can see what we
[00:03:42] have available for our packs and I'm
[00:03:44] going to shrink all that down so you can
[00:03:46] see it because that is way too big for
[00:03:48] you guys I realize that
[00:03:51] now there you go you should all be able
[00:03:53] to see that nicely that shows you
[00:03:55] everything we got for packs available so
[00:03:58] we're going to throw out our uh our a
[00:04:00] live our adventure Wasteland with our
[00:04:02] animated one let's just throw something
[00:04:04] out right now just because no one's
[00:04:07] choosing anything and I'm going to put
[00:04:09] that out for our Wasteland Adventure at
[00:04:11] the moment I'm going to put our pogs
[00:04:13] this is from our uh our money from our
[00:04:15] other Adventure if you guys probably
[00:04:17] participate in it there you go I'm going
[00:04:19] to put that out and I say there we go
[00:04:23] start an
[00:04:25] auction there you go 30 seconds and that
[00:04:28] is always going to be sudden death cuz
[00:04:29] I'm always happy with with it and say
[00:04:30] you want to do that that will give you
[00:04:32] as you see right there and the adventure
[00:04:34] that's going to give you two plus so
[00:04:37] you're going to get two plus on your uh
[00:04:39] on your character for the strength so
[00:04:41] it's going to be one two three four for
[00:04:43] the strength because each one of these
[00:04:44] are one plus an extra per pack so be
[00:04:46] four to start your strength and your
[00:04:48] adventure with the character right there
[00:04:50] so that's how we're going to do that
[00:04:51] change it up a little bit in the first
[00:04:53] way that you're going to start with your
[00:04:54] fight off here you're going to be
[00:04:56] battling with a little bit of a smaller
[00:04:58] group of people here
[00:05:00] that maybe you can beat them and as you
[00:05:01] beat them it'll be something lower on
[00:05:03] the lower side that maybe is put out for
[00:05:04] the loot pack but as you as you
[00:05:06] participate in more people are
[00:05:08] participating in the adventure maybe
[00:05:10] that uh that grows it's kind of what I
[00:05:12] was thinking there and what I'll do
[00:05:15] anything ways right now for all of you
[00:05:17] is I will always put out one of my
[00:05:19] little uh family giveaway things right
[00:05:23] up there I'll put it over in the corner
[00:05:25] here so you can see a little better
[00:05:28] there you go that's a little away from
[00:05:30] the family these are the
[00:05:33] additional cards that we could use we're
[00:05:35] not using those right now those the
[00:05:36] bosses that you'd be fighting against
[00:05:38] right there
[00:05:43] though nice thank you Quantum you should
[00:05:46] have all shipped you should have seen it
[00:05:48] shipping stuff so it should be good let
[00:05:50] me know everything came in I sh I
[00:05:51] wrapped them interestingly so that it
[00:05:53] was made sure that nothing happened so
[00:05:55] yeah let me know thank you
[00:05:57] Quantum and let me uh throw out another
[00:06:00] one no one wanted these so I'll throw
[00:06:02] something different out for all of
[00:06:05] you oh I do have checkin
[00:06:09] too I forgot to put that in
[00:06:12] there forgot to put that in there
[00:06:19] [Music]
[00:06:25] [Music]
[00:06:31] [Music]
[00:06:38] try what is it let me do it here give me
[00:06:39] that up here check in I think I have it
[00:06:47] running there we go and it is uh
[00:06:56] yeah I think that's what it is there
[00:07:00] all right try our
[00:07:06] checkin there you go try a new check-in
[00:07:10] feature save that there we go awesome I
[00:07:15] run some new adventure here with some
[00:07:17] new packs we
[00:07:19] got oh you think it was delivered today
[00:07:21] oh nice perfect even better even
[00:07:25] better we'll throw this out here
[00:07:28] something a little on the low side to
[00:07:29] start the adventure just a little basic
[00:07:31] thing you know and this is where you get
[00:07:32] the plus these are just one and one so
[00:07:34] that would be well actually I think this
[00:07:35] is a plus one because it's a set um
[00:07:39] Wilds of our drain
[00:07:40] set oh I don't even have it in there
[00:07:43] Wilds of our drain set I have to put
[00:07:44] that in there then that'll end up being
[00:07:48] um throw that out here for you
[00:07:52] all if you want to jump in on these you
[00:07:56] got those ones running on the little
[00:07:57] Adventure here and then we're going to
[00:07:58] do our animated Adventure you pick your
[00:08:01] character you wander through the
[00:08:02] Wasteland and you see what
[00:08:07] happens now with the
[00:08:11] upgrade you guys get to see uh the new
[00:08:14] car we'll put some new bosses in there
[00:08:16] so it makes it a little bit of a
[00:08:17] different for you to try to fight
[00:08:18] against so instead of going against the
[00:08:21] same bosses we have each time you may be
[00:08:23] up your your adventure may be getting
[00:08:25] tougher if you play a few of them so say
[00:08:27] you decide you want to play two or three
[00:08:29] of them
[00:08:29] well you know what you could potentially
[00:08:31] beat the boss and there'll be a loop
[00:08:33] drop of maybe it'll be a maybe it's
[00:08:34] going to be like a couple like you know
[00:08:35] a couple dollar cards type thing nothing
[00:08:37] special for this first one but then
[00:08:39] after that maybe you continue on and
[00:08:41] there's like four or five of them like
[00:08:42] two or three of them and as each one
[00:08:43] goes and maybe it'll become like a pack
[00:08:46] of cards then it'll become a different
[00:08:48] pack of cards then it'll become a bigger
[00:08:50] pack of cards maybe it's two pack of
[00:08:51] cards is Loot drop and that's what I was
[00:08:53] thinking I was going to be doing here as
[00:08:55] we
[00:08:56] um as the adventure good larger and your
[00:09:00] bosses get bigger because what I was
[00:09:03] going to do is I'm going to trade out
[00:09:04] the characters here and you're going to
[00:09:05] either have to uh build up to beat them
[00:09:09] or get lucky enough to beat them in the
[00:09:13] adventure through our the little uh
[00:09:15] pulling through the box
[00:09:17] there now let me know what you think

[00:21:31] that is we'll throw out something like
[00:21:35] this all right we'll call
[00:21:39] this a three one
[00:21:43] two three four because this is two this
[00:21:46] is a plus one on that one being one of

[00:29:51] you know what that actually might be
[00:29:53] accurate
[00:29:55] there cuz she it's like uh it's it's
[00:29:58] almost like her brain isn't uh it's it
[00:30:00] it doesn't filter things like she
[00:30:02] normally would so she doesn't care as
[00:30:04] much and she's like I'm tired and she

[00:35:02] that one
[00:35:03] on maybe you want something like that
[00:35:06] try yourself at a uh hey I yeah I know
[00:35:10] man I'm not going to be
[00:35:12] um quite frankly I can't trust that
[00:35:16] uh someone isn't GNA manipulate and then
[00:35:20] lie and then have something happen so
[00:35:22] that's really why I'm at at the stage of
[00:35:23] mat but on whatnot that is on what not
[00:35:28] I'll just leave it at
[00:35:32] that
[00:35:35] William come here
[00:35:41] please so yeah that's where I stand here
[00:35:45] can you put some of these in the
[00:35:46] refrigerator and then if there is a cold
[00:35:48] one grab one thank you no there's no
[00:35:50] cold ones okay thank you just put some
[00:35:52] in the refrigerator and put that away
[00:35:53] thank
[00:35:54] you no one wanted this I thought I put
[00:35:57] it out here did it not run maybe it did
[00:36:00] maybe it didn't I don't
[00:36:03] know yeah yeah it's sucks dude but um
[00:36:07] yeah that's all I can say it sucks is uh
[00:36:09] that's the stage and we're at this will
[00:36:10] get you a plus two right
[00:36:13] here we'll say this is plus three
[00:36:15] actually for the adventure we'll call
[00:36:17] this plus three for the
[00:36:22] adventure and then that means you can
[00:36:24] potentially Beat the Boss because the
[00:36:25] boss has up changed in the adventure the
[00:36:28] bosses are different now they give you a
[00:36:29] better chance of beating him for the
[00:36:31] first one because the bosses get as you
[00:36:33] uh go through the adventure the
[00:36:35] adventure becomes upgraded So currently
[00:36:37] our bosses are these now if you notice a
[00:36:41] lot of the bigger ones are gone and
[00:36:42] you're left with a few of the smaller
[00:36:43] ones we've added a couple new ones in
[00:36:45] here that are smaller gives you a better
[00:36:46] chance of beating them so yeah there we
[00:36:49] go there let's see
[00:36:51] um let's see
[00:36:54] though if we can uh do some fun things
[00:36:57] else maybe some packs or some singles or

[00:44:38] don't know how regularly they do but I
[00:44:40] don't think they have one at the
[00:44:42] moment but they do sometimes do like uh
[00:44:45] things like that
[00:44:47] yes oh it is really I didn't know that
[00:44:50] well I'm sorry I was unaware how much

[00:55:05] been upgraded and adjusted now where the
[00:55:07] bosses at the end are a little different
[00:55:09] now the bosses start out on a little on
[00:55:11] a little lower side so you have a better
[00:55:13] chance of beating them now and because
[00:55:15] you have that better chance of beating
[00:55:16] them now you actually have uh we have
[00:55:19] more loot drops on a regular basis with
[00:55:21] all you wastelanders that was the point
[00:55:24] of uh the upgraded Wast Wasteland
[00:55:26] Adventure here so that you get more $1
[00:55:28] loot drops for all you wastelanders
[00:55:30] instead of having to wait so long or
[00:55:32] trying to have a hard time finding them
[00:55:33] or hard time getting them you'll be able
[00:55:36] to get them regularly
[00:55:37] now yeah remember to check in too we
[00:55:41] have a new things that are going so do
[00:55:42] remember to check in if you are on

[00:55:49] and I'm going to put out some other
[00:55:51] stuff and see what happens this evening
[00:55:53] cuz I think it's getting to uh it's
[00:55:55] going to be a one recently rough few
[00:55:57] weeks here I don't know what's going on
[00:56:00] I think it's my times are maybe what
[00:56:02] people uh people want gamelink things
[00:56:04] and uh uh quite frankly what not doesn't
[00:56:06] isn't trustworthy to um have somebody
[00:56:08] complain about that and it be um not
[00:56:12] handled appropriately so I can't do
[00:56:14] those anymore and I suspect that's
[00:56:16] what's going to end up happening is I'm
[00:56:17] going to end up being here doing not a
[00:56:18] lot because people come in looking for
[00:56:20] them but hey that's
[00:56:22] okay we'll see what happens

[00:56:57] things oh this is one going to

[01:29:04] help I have said this something myself
[01:29:06] for a long time that arise I say this
[01:29:09] all the time and I I don't know if
[01:29:10] everybody necessarily believes me when I
[01:29:11] say it but I say it and i' I've been
[01:29:14] around a fisherman my entire life Rising
[01:29:17] tide L all boats all right if we raise a
[01:29:21] tide for everyone everyone vat everyone

[01:29:29] higher you know you can get up to the
[01:29:31] dock easyier whatever you want to say
[01:29:34] but the point is we all got to work
[01:29:36] together to do that right and this is
[01:29:39] one of those scenarios cast and over had
[01:29:41] a question I could have said yeah gave
[01:29:42] him a runaround crap on it but instead
[01:29:44] gave him some assistance and told
[01:29:48] them sometimes I feel like people
[01:29:50] realize don't think that they think it's
[01:29:52] going to be a uh your you're stealing
[01:29:54] from them in some way I'm not trying to
[01:29:56] I'm being nice we're having a good time

[01:40:19] good
[01:40:21] day it's currently on I'm just uh
[01:40:24] readjusting my
[01:40:27] um my bosses here for our adventures so
[01:40:30] that we can have a little bit of a
[01:40:32] different ones with you
[01:40:34] all we'll see how it goes though if you
[01:40:37] uh are intrigued to have any um no that
[01:40:41] looks ruined
[01:40:43] now well that stinks we'll keep trying
[01:40:46] this and see if you guys want to
[01:40:48] participate here and I think the reason
[01:40:50] is you guys are there's a lot of people
[01:40:51] that come on here looking for gambling
[01:40:53] things and um I'm just not going to do
[01:40:56] that anymore not going to do anything
[01:40:58] that could be considered gambling in any
[01:40:59] way shape or form even though it's not
[01:41:02] and I'm just actually just giving buy
[01:41:04] giving stuff away to people but I guess
[01:41:06] uh when you do that some people consider
[01:41:07] it gambling and they don't allow it here
[01:41:10] when you give stuff away when they play
[01:41:12] games so I don't do that and I can't so
[01:41:15] all we do is our um our you always get
[01:41:18] your ball pack and then if you happen to
[01:41:20] beat the boss we do a $1 Loot drop on
[01:41:23] what not for all you wastelanders but do
[01:41:25] remember to follow me on YouTube
[01:41:27] Instagram and Facebook so you can see

[01:42:35] establishing um everyone in their um
[01:42:38] can't have that one don't want that one
[01:42:40] that's an a that's an big open one don't
[01:42:42] want the big open one want this
[01:42:45] one needs to be the same as the rest
[01:42:47] right can't have them different because

[01:51:48] and then we do the uh animated Wasteland
[01:51:51] Adventure where we could potentially
[01:51:54] have you beat the boss and do a Loot
[01:51:57] drop at the end for a uh another pack of
[01:52:00] cards what gonna happen I don't
[01:52:03] know I
[01:52:05] suspect we're gonna have um some of our
[01:52:10] bosses
[01:52:11] beaten and to keep these ones out here
[01:52:14] and I think we're going to add some new
[01:52:15] ones I'm going to add some new ones in
[01:52:18] I'm not going to remove any I'm going to
[01:52:20] add some new ones in as possibilities
[01:52:23] these are our new ones and we're going
[01:52:24] to adjust these all as time
[01:52:27] goes I think that's what I'm going to do
[01:52:29] I'm going to adjust them as time
[01:52:31] goes we're going to put our other ones
[01:52:33] back that we had
[01:52:37] before so I think those are good ones
[01:52:39] that keep in there but I'm going to
[01:52:41] adjust our bosses here there's going to
[01:52:44] be a more larger amount this time think
[01:52:46] it's going to be what one two three four
[01:52:49] five 6 7 8 9 10
[01:52:53] 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 20 of them
[01:52:58] there's potentially 20 there
[01:53:00] aha but it's a better opportunity of you
[01:53:02] beating some getting a lower
[01:53:06] one but they're not all going to be
[01:53:08] animated for the bosses though there
[01:53:09] will only be 10 of them that are
[01:53:10] animated but hey that's better than none
[01:53:12] of them but the rest of the game would
[01:53:14] be animated if you wanted to uh
[01:53:20] participate let's see if it works
[01:53:28] there we
[01:53:30] go look at that tells you what it is
[01:53:33] right
[01:53:35] there Perfecto I like that got that
[01:53:39] little uh Price tool

[01:53:46] you get to check the price of cards when
[01:53:49] we're uh ripping packs now

[01:54:03] nothing super special we need to get up
[01:54:06] a little higher for it to get more here
[01:54:08] but that'll be our end of stream
[01:54:09] giveaway that we do is those three cards
[01:54:13] we'll put those actually like this just
[01:54:15] put that like that that way you can see
[01:54:17] them all it's those three cards there
[01:54:19] that's our end of stream giveaway that
[01:54:21] will end up changing
[01:54:23] though as uh as things go maybe it'll be
[01:54:26] higher maybe it'll be lower it'll never
[01:54:28] be lower though but it could also it
[01:54:30] could ever potentially be higher
[01:54:33] depending on what you guys want to do
[01:54:34] here with the adventures if you want to
[01:54:36] participate if you want to buy some
[01:54:38] packs here jump

[01:55:40] only difference is the cards don't

[00:02:55] here maybe maybe I'll get some good but
[00:02:57] hey the nice thing that we get to do
[00:02:58] with the check-ins is is that helps
[00:03:00] build us up to what we're going to doing
[00:03:01] for our giveaways area but what we'll do
[00:03:03] right now with all of our check-ins the
[00:03:04] amount of them that we get once we get a
[00:03:06] few of them we have you guys I put you
[00:03:08] guys in a little wheel you spin it and
[00:03:10] what the goal is to try to find the one
[00:03:11] that's the foil card here the sorcery
[00:03:13] deck well it's not a deck it's just pack
[00:03:15] I Dr a bunch of cards here not a deck
[00:03:17] but foil one what you're going to find
[00:03:19] is you want to find the foil one and
[00:03:20] where it is maybe you don't but maybe
[00:03:21] you just get like a card which is one of
[00:03:23] our ones we Shuffle up here but it's
[00:03:24] just a little fun way of trying to hang
[00:03:26] out with us and see how the gibes go all
[00:03:28] right rather than just do doing silly
[00:03:30] things that people aren't necessarily
[00:03:31] wanting I can do cards that are worth a
[00:03:33] little bit more and I can do um I can do
[00:03:37] a pack of cards in there if you guys
[00:03:38] happen to be lucky and get it so there
[00:03:41] you go hey tangarine how's it going nice

[00:07:57] ink eyes was a good one I thought you
[00:07:58] were talking about the other one for
[00:07:59] some reason like oh that's intriguing
[00:08:01] because I thought ink eyes was nice here
[00:08:03] Ninjutsu whenever ink eyes servant of
[00:08:05] Oni deals the combat damage to a player
[00:08:07] you many you may put Target creature
[00:08:09] card from that player's graveyard onto
[00:08:11] the battlefield under your control I
[00:08:13] like that regenerate ink eyes that's a
[00:08:15] nice
[00:08:20] one no I did not see that one I'm sorry

[00:14:03] Umbra well I was going to do like a it
[00:14:05] was going to be kind of like a little
[00:14:06] bit of a pre-release type format where
[00:14:08] we do 40 cards you open the packs up
[00:14:12] you'll get because you'll have five
[00:14:13] you'll open them up you'll get pick out
[00:14:15] 40 to kind of do that and then uh you
[00:14:17] can put in whatever you want for your um
[00:14:20] your uh lands obviously because you have
[00:14:22] your own lands that you can add in you
[00:14:24] talking about
[00:14:26] um which one you looking for
[00:14:30] you said you
[00:14:37] wanted you want to the
[00:14:42] Umbra oh Luma Luma ah aha aha that's
[00:14:47] what you were saying that's what you
[00:14:49] were saying let's
[00:14:51] see put this right here in a
[00:14:55] sleeve and I'll do this right
[00:14:57] here cuz that's part of our other stuff
[00:15:00] right here on this side let's put that
[00:15:02] up there if you
[00:15:03] want let's see price
[00:15:08] BLB 183 you check that
[00:15:13] out Luma Bellow of the
[00:15:23] woods that one is 183
[00:15:31] that is um incorrect though
[00:15:38] weirdly
[00:15:40] yeah yeah kind of like a pre-release
[00:15:42] kind of event El almost in a way let's
[00:15:45] see 183 that's about right I think
[00:15:47] that's correct yeah that's correct the
[00:15:51] foil there we'll put that out
[00:15:55] there if you guys want that for the Luma
[00:15:59] now that is a $10 card we'll put it out
[00:16:03] for there you go pulled right out of
[00:16:06] there we were going to try that but um I
[00:16:09] was going to saying that we didn't have
[00:16:10] a lot of people do that I figured we'
[00:16:12] try something a little different maybe
[00:16:13] that's why and do a little different
[00:16:14] format on
[00:16:18] it
[00:16:20] so that was my thought
[00:16:22] process
[00:16:24] Mahaya coming in with that other one I
[00:16:27] like it Mahaya G to put it in with the
[00:16:30] other one here because we can fit a few
[00:16:31] cards in

[01:35:19] that's already been done so they get
[01:35:20] checked out but I'm going to actually do

[01:35:23] list and I think I can organize the
[01:35:25] check-in list here by
[01:35:28] time because if I can organize it by
[01:35:31] time I can do like the last half hour
[01:35:34] that way most likely you are either in
[01:35:35] here or not and checking in within the
[01:35:39] last half hour if that makes

[02:00:36] time but I hope there's somebody at some
[02:00:37] point that is either from Japan or has
[02:00:40] been to Japan and knows why they put him
[02:00:42] in the reverse order than we do when we

[02:01:29] for the foil and a fish token and a fish
[02:01:36] token yeah me too it's like it's one of
[02:01:38] those things like um so
[02:01:42] like I want to know yeah I want to know
[02:01:44] why they do that like what's the
[02:01:45] reasoning for
[02:01:47] it is I know I know over there there's
[02:01:50] uh that's why I like some of the
[02:01:51] Japanese cards you get them in um you
[02:01:53] have to get certain ones like in the
[02:01:54] packs they they''re ordered differently
[02:01:56] which is why you get more um certain
[02:01:58] types of rares or special cards in the
[02:01:59] Japanese ones but that's also like I
[02:02:02] don't know if that's part of the reason
[02:02:03] why they do them that way one two three
[02:02:06] four five six seven and eight because it
[02:02:10] has something to do with their laws that
[02:02:11] you have to get one of each special card
[02:02:14] or something like that in the pack
[02:02:22] oh maybe maybe I can see what you're
[02:02:24] saying they do it a different way
[02:02:25] instead of looking at it this way they
[02:02:27] flip each one of them over from back to
[02:02:28] forward okay Porters overflow Shoreline

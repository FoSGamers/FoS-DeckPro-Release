We were told that Skin So Soft and Blue Mouthwash, Mint Mouthwash, will be mixed together, will stop no-seums from somebody in Florida here. It seemed to actually attract them more when I got out on there. Do I have to like douse my body to the point that I'm dripping in it, or is it only like a spray-on thing here?

Yeah, that homemade no-see-um repellent recipe with **Skin So Soft** and **mint mouthwash** (often Listerine or similar) is a popular DIY remedy in Florida and other buggy areas—but it can be hit or miss. Here's the scoop:

### Why It Might Not Have Worked:
- **Dilution**: If it wasn’t mixed in a strong enough ratio, it may not have been effective. Some people add **witch hazel** or **rubbing alcohol** to help it spread and evaporate more quickly, but if it’s too watered down, the smell that repels bugs won’t stick around.
- **Application**: Spraying a light mist usually works for many, but in heavy no-see-um areas, yes—you may actually need to apply more liberally. Not to the point of dripping, but enough to coat exposed skin thoroughly.
- **Sweating or Water Exposure**: These can wash it off quickly, especially in hot/humid Florida weather.

### Pro Tips:
- **Reapply often**, especially if sweating or swimming.
- Try a blend like:
  - 1/3 Skin So Soft
  - 1/3 mint mouthwash (Listerine)
  - 1/3 witch hazel or alcohol
- Add **essential oils** like eucalyptus, citronella, or tea tree oil for extra bite-deterrent.

If it still seems like they’re *more* attracted to you, it might be better to switch to something DEET-free but stronger, like **Picaridin-based repellents** or **Thermacell devices**.

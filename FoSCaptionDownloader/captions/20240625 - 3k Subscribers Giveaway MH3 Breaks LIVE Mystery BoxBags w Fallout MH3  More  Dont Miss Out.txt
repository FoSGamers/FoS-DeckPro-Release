[00:11:45] you'll have packs that are mixed in with
[00:11:47] it that type of thing that's kind of
[00:11:48] what I want to have the box built as and

[00:11:52] in and maybe if we're doing good we'll
[00:11:54] throw an extra box of cards in it you
[00:11:55] know what I mean that's kind of what my
[00:11:57] plan is is to like build up like that
[00:12:00] but that's really up to you guys and how
[00:12:02] many people come in and hang out with us
[00:12:03] on a regular basis you know but I'm
[00:12:05] going to get this running we'll throw
[00:12:07] this out here for you that may want it
[00:12:09] now if you go on you can check it out
[00:12:12] that's a good price there and this is
[00:12:13] going to go as a cheap delivery if you
[00:12:14] want me to do the one with bubble wrap
[00:12:16] we could do that but right now this is
[00:12:17] going the plain white
[00:12:19] envelope there you
[00:12:21] go no got to get past this I don't want
[00:12:23] to wa Houston right
[00:12:27] now all right
[00:12:30] well that would have been a decent one
[00:12:31] but why
[00:12:34] not that was a good pickup right
[00:12:40] there ready no one wants that
[00:12:44] one any Pearl medallions you know what
[00:12:46] let me see I feel like I had one but I
[00:12:51] may have sold it recently or I like just
[00:12:54] pulled it out and just sold it but I
[00:12:56] feel like I got one recently if I
[00:13:00] Tower let me see let me see if that is
[00:13:03] accurate on what I think I got let me
[00:13:06] see I feel like I did get one recently
[00:13:09] but I don't know it's one of those
[00:13:10] things where I I get them and I and
[00:13:12] people will like I put them up there
[00:13:13] right away so people pull them out as
[00:13:15] soon as I pull them out people buy them
[00:13:16] a lot of the times but I feel like that
[00:13:18] one I had putting away because no one
[00:13:20] had wanted one of the Pearl
[00:13:22] medallions but maybe maybe it was the
[00:13:25] Ruby Medallion that no one wanted
[00:13:29] best price on the tower let me see what
[00:13:31] we can put out for our Tower I knew
[00:13:32] somebody needed the tower let me do that
[00:13:35] I couldn't remember who it was let's put
[00:13:37] that forian tower out right now all
[00:13:44] right there we

[00:13:59] it's going to go in in one of these and
[00:14:01] it's going to ship in one of those all
[00:14:02] right there's no like no tracking or
[00:14:04] anything like that but that's why it's
[00:14:05] cheaper it's like a dollar or less

[00:23:04] innovation Mystic
[00:23:06] andula now Frank um I printed your stuff
[00:23:09] out because it makes me it automatically
[00:23:11] printed your print label out for some
[00:23:12] reason um I'm not going to ship it
[00:23:14] because you ask me to hold on to it for
[00:23:15] the end of to the end of the week for
[00:23:16] some reason so um I'll do my best on
[00:23:18] that I it might make it do that every
[00:23:20] time I go to print labels so I'll hold
[00:23:22] on them and I'll kind of like ship them
[00:23:23] all together um if that's okay with you
[00:23:25] if that's what you're kind of asking for
[00:23:32] Mystic and
[00:23:36] Fala
[00:23:37] now you got yourself a quest for the
[00:23:41] necropolis I like it now if you um all

[00:23:51] want for a number
[00:23:59] oh I didn't think about that stinking
[00:24:03] Lincoln that's actually not a bad idea I
[00:24:05] should actually put those in there
[00:24:06] because I have a lot of big hits on
[00:24:08] those you know what actually I think I
[00:24:09] might scan those today and while I'm
[00:24:11] waiting for dealing with some stuff with
[00:24:12] the painters and get them in there
[00:24:14] before we do an afternoon stream because
[00:24:16] I think I'll do an afternoon stream
[00:24:17] later today because I'm gonna have like
[00:24:19] I said I'm have to get off at some point
[00:24:20] because I have to deal with the um
[00:24:21] painter

[00:24:45] for our giveaway card
[00:24:46] there there we

[00:24:57] that
[00:25:02] yeah I generally do it a few bucks below
[00:25:04] TCG player pricing because it helps with
[00:25:06] the shipping and I don't really care
[00:25:07] about because like like a couple bucks
[00:25:09] like that on a big one helps shipping
[00:25:11] wise and it makes you know makes them
[00:25:12] feel better and I'm okay with
[00:25:18] that alrighty let's keep going through

[00:32:55] organized day for singles that way can
[00:32:57] be oh yeah plut Delta over
[00:33:00] here P's at all the P's over

[00:33:31] other
[00:33:32] card maybe I was wrong and I was

[00:33:35] I had another polluted
[00:33:37] Delta that was an extended art one ug's
[00:33:40] binding but maybe I'm wrong now I must
[00:33:43] have sold that one

[00:48:33] this way oh look the camera lights up

[00:48:56] white envelope if you wanted to go with
[00:48:57] packing um I can but there you
[00:49:05] go that's funny I've seen I don't
[00:49:08] understand what you're talking about
[00:49:09] there I've been in that position before
[00:49:11] like hey wait what are you talking about
[00:49:12] you can't do
[00:49:18] that all right well looks like no one
[00:49:22] wanted
[00:49:23] those what's up buddy
[00:49:27] yes we did why Mommy's car was not
[00:49:30] working and we had to get rid of anyways
[00:49:32] because I didn't know where it was it
[00:49:34] has yeah will yeah you know we sold
[00:49:37] mom's car because it was we had to we
[00:49:39] had to do the the um the delete on the
[00:49:42] whatever you're not going to understand
[00:49:43] it there's the thing we needed to do to
[00:49:45] the motor to not to the motor to the um
[00:49:46] to the car that wouldn't cost a lot of
[00:49:48] money but it would have taken time but
[00:49:50] we're getting rid of stuff everything to
[00:49:51] move anyway so instead of doing that we
[00:49:53] just sold it and had somebody and so
[00:49:54] somebody else could do it you know what
[00:49:56] I'm saying yeah all
[00:50:01] right maintenance now while the car uh
[00:50:04] it had like um we could do like the uh
[00:50:06] we it's the volswagen Jetta TDI and we
[00:50:09] could have done that thing that's like
[00:50:10] the um the
[00:50:12] uh what is the
[00:50:15] delete it's the enhan it's the admission
[00:50:17] delete thing and it gives you actually
[00:50:19] better gas mileage so what happened was
[00:50:21] I guess back in like the um back in uh
[00:50:25] early 2010 area they came out with the
[00:50:28] car and they were having issues where
[00:50:30] the um the emissions didn't hit where
[00:50:32] California wanted all right California
[00:50:34] is always a big stickler for everything
[00:50:36] so we have some flares of cultivation we
[00:50:39] have a regular a regular and a foil and
[00:50:41] a foil Retro by the way if you want any
[00:50:44] of those for some players right
[00:50:48] there why is this play in the
[00:50:54] back all right
[00:50:57] yeah I completely forgot what I was just
[00:50:59] talking about wow my brain just broke oh
[00:51:01] I have I have that happened to me too
[00:51:08] often yeah the emission things yes the
[00:51:10] votw emission thing yep that's exactly
[00:51:11] then so if you if you get rid of the um
[00:51:14] that emission thing it'll actually
[00:51:17] um increase your gas mileage your fuel
[00:51:20] mileage but um for whatever reason the
[00:51:24] government doesn't like that they wanted
[00:51:27] it to be the emissions to be different
[00:51:28] so it decreases the fuel mileage based
[00:51:30] on their emission thing that they put in
[00:51:32] but with that acting up that like the
[00:51:33] engine he has like that check engine
[00:51:35] light on because the check engine lights
[00:51:37] on mean you know we just need to take
[00:51:38] care of that and it doesn't really do
[00:51:39] anything but it can cause issues with
[00:51:41] like the motor not like uh connect like
[00:51:44] like working perfectly and can stutter
[00:51:45] because of it so you either remove it or
[00:51:47] replace it we were going to choose to
[00:51:50] remove it because it's better to do that
[00:51:52] or and we get better
[00:51:54] mileage going to throw this one out for
[00:51:56] instead of $10 for this foil we're going
[00:51:59] to do a nice $8 on
[00:52:04] it so yeah I guess we could do that but
[00:52:06] we don't really want to it's a lot it
[00:52:09] would have been time and money that I
[00:52:10] didn't want to put into it really what I
[00:52:12] boiled down to nobody wanted the blood
[00:52:15] stain Meer from earlier so we'll take
[00:52:17] care of that put that away and see in
[00:52:20] case anybody wants one of those we'll
[00:52:21] find it later
[00:52:38] do I have wooded Foothills I do believe

[01:03:47] but I um I will give you a link right
[01:03:49] now here also now you do have to be um

[01:03:56] be an issue unless you have it
[01:03:58] somewhere unless you have somewhere to

[01:04:20] are the only two that I have let's see
[01:04:22] if somebody wants a couple vexing bobles
[01:04:25] because those are really hard to come by
[01:04:27] for

[01:04:32] like some of the few that I think I've
[01:04:33] only come by like four vexing bobles out
[01:04:35] of all the boxes that I've opened and
[01:04:38] that's really kind kind of rather
[01:04:39] ridiculous I'm expecting that card
[01:04:41] probably to spike up a lot just because
[01:04:43] of how hard it is to
[01:04:48] get yes no problem
[01:04:50] Fabian I'm sorry

[01:08:57] no one wants any of
[01:09:01] those put those in
[01:09:06] storage let's put out some Feld
[01:09:09] profane derevi
[01:09:12] imper no I don't think
[01:09:17] so I don't just sell wind swep Heath
[01:09:21] somebody didn't buy
[01:09:23] it no one bought swep
[01:09:26] Heath I still have
[01:09:29] it yes we can see the top loaded cards
[01:09:32] again wind swep Heath is right here I
[01:09:35] did not sell that that's right there
[01:09:37] still I will show the top loaded cards
[01:09:39] now some of the cards that are in the um
[01:09:42] in sleeves are not that are not in top
[01:09:45] loaders are just that way because I
[01:09:46] haven't gotten a chance to put them in
[01:09:47] top loaders yet let literally it so we
[01:09:49] have some subtleties I have a couple
[01:09:52] subtleties um I also have a subtlety
[01:09:55] that is a foil etched
[01:09:58] subtlety you have those flares of denial
[01:10:01] polluted
[01:10:02] Deltas Archway of innovation with a
[01:10:05] white Orchard Phantom ulamog the
[01:10:08] defiler nice one there foil Nadu foil
[01:10:13] etched aani and I have aani foil in here
[01:10:17] somewhere hold on like this is what I
[01:10:19] mean like I know I
[01:10:21] have a jean myself like even like a
[01:10:25] really good card and it's just in here I
[01:10:26] haven't had a chance to put it in
[01:10:28] Toploader yet because we've just been
[01:10:31] busy getting rid of our house that I
[01:10:35] don't always have the chance to do this
[01:10:36] so foil aani right
[01:10:38] there I think that's the only other aani
[01:10:41] that I have but I mean like that's what
[01:10:42] I mean like I have that aani sitting
[01:10:43] there it's just because I haven't put it
[01:10:45] in tooer yet so we go
[01:10:48] aani I think I actually have one more of
[01:10:53] them I have another one too even I
[01:10:55] thought I had another one too somewhere
[01:10:57] maybe I was wrong on having that other
[01:11:02] one I was wrong on having the other one
[01:11:05] yeah I might have been wrong all right
[01:11:06] there we go like I have two
[01:11:08] aani you want an
[01:11:11] aani foil and
[01:11:16] non-foil all right here we
[01:11:18] go frog I have a foil version of that
[01:11:22] too airglass ugan Labyrinth
[01:11:31] SAA no I would never do
[01:11:35] that I mean if it was an emergency maybe
[01:11:37] grief tune The Narrative foil single Sil
[01:11:41] gar Teo my vexing bobles that I put
[01:11:44] there winter moons
[01:11:47] flare and then I think I'm back to the
[01:11:49] beginning there there you go those are
[01:11:52] all the foil ones that I had there but
[01:11:53] like I said I got a bunch of them that
[01:11:54] are not in top loaders that it probably

[01:12:28] it I have an Airgas in
[01:12:31] regular like 99% sure I have
[01:12:40] that 99% sure I have that one because I

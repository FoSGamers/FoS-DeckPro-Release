For the YouTube, the whatnot link should be at the top so people know how to access it easier. Actually, it should be that way for everything. Put all the whatnot ability to access at the top along with the other ways to access me through the link for the top or for the other social stuff. Always have those at the top of the description so people can easily find me. And make sure all the things that are live have the things for hashtag live and hashtag streaming since those are important.

Make sure everything is understood that the limit related to characters has every single character that is typed in, or would be typed in to create an emoji, or an image, or a space, or whatever the fuck it is. It needs to be within 100% of the character limit.

Understood. Here's the updated **template** with full emphasis on counting **every single character**—letters, spaces, links, emojis (2 characters per emoji), and any other typed elements—so all character limits are met with absolute precision.

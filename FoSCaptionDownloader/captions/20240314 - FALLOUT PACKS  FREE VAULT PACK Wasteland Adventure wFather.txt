[00:03:53] Fallout I love Fallout it was one of my
[00:03:55] favorite games I woulded in line for it
[00:03:57] when I was growing up you know I I like
[00:03:59] literally the first one I I remember
[00:04:01] specifically my mother complaining to me
[00:04:04] because I stayed out too late with my
[00:04:06] friends waiting inline for a video game
[00:04:10] she like this is ridiculous you're only

[00:04:15] games going be so
[00:04:17] cool oh yes I am yes I am I'm extremely
[00:04:21] ready um my my only request that I've
[00:04:24] said is they they can do this very well
[00:04:26] because with Fallout characters you can
[00:04:27] build anything you want it doesn't
[00:04:29] matter what it is as a character just
[00:04:31] please stay with the storyline of
[00:04:33] Fallout and don't sprinkle in whatever
[00:04:35] else you want that's all I ask so far it
[00:04:38] looks really good though I will say that

[00:08:15] and they are a bunch of like ones that
[00:08:17] have like kind of like 80s posters on
[00:08:18] them and we are going to do those and
[00:08:20] give those ones away in the vault that's
[00:08:23] the reason why I have to do it at night
[00:08:24] after my kids are in bed cuz I don't
[00:08:26] want them to be uh o what is that oh my
[00:08:28] and because there is one pack at the end
[00:08:30] that it might be I might have to um put
[00:08:32] potit on it that's all I'm going to say
[00:08:34] here we go let's see what we get here oh
[00:08:38] my oh no we found an enemy a warrior
[00:08:43] comes up to the detective trying to
[00:08:45] protect
[00:08:46] himself swings his battle axe at the
[00:08:49] detective luckily the detective is able
[00:08:51] to dodge and not die but he does get
[00:08:53] clipped on the shoulder leaving him only
[00:08:54] with one strength as he wanders through
[00:08:56] the Wasteland and you know what that's
[00:08:58] no good for that but that's okay maybe
[00:09:00] you won't get beat by a boss you see a
[00:09:02] fault in the distance you're trying to
[00:09:03] sneak around as a detective but out of
[00:09:05] nowhere pops a boss for you and you now
[00:09:08] have to fight one of these you decide
[00:09:11] all right you said random for all so
[00:09:13] we'll go with that one we'll go quickly
[00:09:15] through that here and oh look at that
[00:09:16] Miri comes
[00:09:20] up and you have oh that was the enemy
[00:09:23] one you have an enemy that you come up
[00:09:25] to and she swings at you but you dodge
[00:09:29] jump into the jump into the vault in
[00:09:30] time making it away from Miri there and
[00:09:34] as you're in that Vault you look around
[00:09:36] you see something in that Vault and you
[00:09:38] pull out this thing how many must have
[00:09:39] thought this pack from 91 was worth
[00:09:41] keeping something having to do with
[00:09:44] baseball I don't know what are these
[00:09:46] wacky at bats some type of weird game
[00:09:49] from 91 some baseball cards so let's see
[00:09:51] what we get there they thought that was
[00:09:52] going to be worthwhile I guess at some
[00:09:55] point the other pack here is uh one
[00:09:57] picked out from the children too that
[00:09:59] was the last one picked out for the kids
[00:10:00] they picked them out all the Vault ones
[00:10:02] but anyways this is what you get you get
[00:10:03] those two packs there we did not beat

[00:20:08] started it out here family whenever the
[00:20:10] family leaves I have like kind of
[00:20:12] nothing to do for a little while until
[00:20:13] my work begins around 9:00 and I started
[00:20:15] having our meeting my meetings and stuff
[00:20:17] so what I do is I hang out with you guys
[00:20:18] for a little
[00:20:20] while and uh then I jump off I work for
[00:20:24] the day and sometimes I come on at night
[00:20:25] like uh tomorrow night remember to
[00:20:27] follow check out that one and if they
[00:20:29] save that show it's going to be a fun
[00:20:31] one for those of you that have seen I
[00:20:33] have some interesting cards uh that I
[00:20:35] got in our our packs here that we have
[00:20:38] to go over all right nobody want of
[00:20:41] those so we'll put that back and see if
[00:20:44] you want something else from us
[00:20:48] here maybe you want to uh maybe you want
[00:20:51] to do something like that for your trip
[00:20:53] through the
[00:20:56] Wasteland could you explain this a
[00:20:58] little bit I'm reading those but oh no
[00:21:00] problem Canon I'm sorry so what you do
[00:21:03] is um whatever you you pick packs
[00:21:06] whatever ones you want um kind of they
[00:21:08] kind of go I kind of do this based on
[00:21:10] strength sometimes I adjust it for the
[00:21:13] um for the amount there and you get a
[00:21:14] certain amount of strength per your
[00:21:16] character and then what happens is um
[00:21:19] you pick a character all right out of
[00:21:23] those which are the top characters there
[00:21:24] and I can expand that if you need to see
[00:21:26] it too there's four characters you can
[00:21:27] choose once you choose those there's
[00:21:30] pluses minuses on the strength then that
[00:21:32] what happens is um you wander through
[00:21:34] the Wasteland here and you pick through
[00:21:36] these three boxes there's red green and
[00:21:38] blue and depending on what you pick out
[00:21:40] you either get a plus one or minus one
[00:21:42] for your strength then you would face
[00:21:44] the boss here and depending on what the
[00:21:46] boss is um and your strength amount you
[00:21:48] could be anywhere from none of the
[00:21:50] bosses to five of the bosses um
[00:21:53] generally if you're getting one or two
[00:21:55] strength that you can beat up to three
[00:21:56] of the bosses but if you go higher you
[00:21:57] can beat more and what happens is you
[00:22:00] just play the game you get the free pack
[00:22:01] Vault pack here and then if somebody
[00:22:03] happens to beat the boss what we do is
[00:22:06] the loot is dropped the boss drops loot
[00:22:09] every time the boss is beat and that
[00:22:11] happens for anybody that hang out in the
[00:22:13] Wasteland here it's going to be a spin
[00:22:15] of a wheel and that will drop a $1 pack
[00:22:18] for into the uh into the um auction here
[00:22:22] for anybody to go after if they want and
[00:22:24] that's how the game goes or that's what
[00:22:26] we do with the game generally and you
[00:22:27] can pick whatever you want want for
[00:22:28] packs for your strength and you get
[00:22:30] whatever this Vault pack is in the front
[00:22:32] here what this one is from like I think
[00:22:33] the early 2000s right now so that's
[00:22:35] really how the game goes there if you
[00:22:37] want to play it so I'm going to put this
[00:22:38] up just a random one up if you guys want
[00:22:40] it if you don't want it don't go for it
[00:22:43] you grab a different pack see like this
[00:22:45] I'll put this up there that might help a
[00:22:46] little bit for you guys to see to uh to
[00:22:49] see what it is and I can always go and
[00:22:51] adjust that
[00:22:52] too but hopefully that was less
[00:22:54] confusing for you Canon and it was a
[00:22:58] better
[00:23:00] explanation now I do have my glasses off
[00:23:02] so I think the US the name says Canon do
[00:23:05] or dob can and
[00:23:07] do so yep that's how the that's pretty
[00:23:10] much how the game goes you get a free
[00:23:11] pack of cards that's just little Vault
[00:23:12] pack to say thank you and then if you
[00:23:14] happen to be lucky enough to come out to
[00:23:16] beat the boss there's loot that gets
[00:23:18] dropped for the
[00:23:19] entire um wastland to run and chase
[00:23:25] after and that's how we uh we do do our
[00:23:28] game and I have a bunch of Fallout 2 for
[00:23:32] those that want it I have about five
[00:23:34] boxes of it here so I'll put another one
[00:23:36] of them up here let's do
[00:23:39] this here we go Wasteland Adventure why
[00:23:43] not see if somebody wants to try it out
[00:23:46] here we're going to start it out that we
[00:23:47] going a little bit slow so we'll start
[00:23:49] that out there that'll be one strength
[00:23:51] for your adventure through the
[00:23:53] Wasteland you know what I think I might
[00:23:55] call um the uh fallout one two strength
[00:23:59] cuz they are a little bit more expensive
[00:24:00] I'm going to call it the Fallout On's
[00:24:02] two strength as you go through the
[00:24:03] Wasteland there that's what fallout's
[00:24:05] going to be from now
[00:24:07] on so that's going to be two strength as
[00:24:09] you wander through the
[00:24:12] Wasteland there we go you can choose

[00:29:20] put some of them in sleeves here cuz I
[00:29:22] opened some the other night and I the
[00:29:24] children were being argumentative and I
[00:29:27] had to go and deal with the children and
[00:29:28] I put him in the Box without sing him

[00:29:32] but uh then I forgot about him Mike
[00:29:36] right you know having a deal with
[00:29:37] children you completely forget about
[00:29:38] things going on in life sometimes the
[00:29:39] other things going
[00:29:41] on all right everyone thank you I do
[00:29:44] appreciate you coming in hanging
[00:29:47] out oh my do not disturb is on I was
[00:29:51] telling me to dropped my truck off ah
[00:29:53] we're good my truck is already dropped
[00:29:55] off so luckily my truck is within
[00:29:57] warranty I had some weird um errors that
[00:30:00] I believe killed my first battery and
[00:30:01] they told me oh it was a battery issue
[00:30:02] and I just needed to replace it nice
[00:30:04] little screeching
[00:30:06] SC but uh and so I replaced it and now
[00:30:09] I'm still getting type of electrical
[00:30:11] errors and it's actually they think my
[00:30:13] alternator or something else connecting
[00:30:15] to it so I'm like guys this is what I
[00:30:17] tried to tell you before cuz I've dealt
[00:30:19] with alternator and power issues in cars
[00:30:21] and you ignored me telling me it was a
[00:30:22] battery because oh I'm from North I
[00:30:24] don't understand Florida in the heat how
[00:30:26] it kills the batteries but great yes
[00:30:27] it's does kill a battery but not a brand
[00:30:29] new battery in 2 years when I have my
[00:30:32] car in the garage my car was outside all
[00:30:34] day and under the heat yes that would
[00:30:36] make sense but my car garage is under
[00:30:39] trees it's cooler than the outside at
[00:30:42] all times so there's no way for it to uh
[00:30:44] get overheated but they uh they don't
[00:30:47] really they think they know better
[00:30:49] everybody knows more than you
[00:30:51] right doesn't matter that you know i'
[00:30:53] I've rebuilt cars with my father or I
[00:30:55] rebuilt an entire boat from um even from
[00:30:59] uh you know the floor the seats the
[00:31:01] padding uh all electronical Electronics
[00:31:04] in there even rebuilt partially rebuilt
[00:31:07] the engine but you know I I know nothing
[00:31:09] I did that at the age of you know 18 I
[00:31:11] know nothing here we
[00:31:14] go put those on there no one wanted
[00:31:17] actually I think I did that at 17 by the
[00:31:19] way I don't even think that was 18 that
[00:31:21] was 17 because the boat was falling
[00:31:22] apart and I needed a new one and I my
[00:31:25] dad's like we're not getting a new one
[00:31:26] you can fix this one like screw and I
[00:31:28] spent like an entire month every day
[00:31:30] after school and every weekend fixing
[00:31:32] that boat and we used that for four
[00:31:35] Summers no problem then my dad died and
[00:31:37] [ __ ] happened we lost whatever but that
[00:31:39] was the best vote ever I rebuilt that
[00:31:41] thing [ __ ] thing went like 60 M hour
[00:31:43] blew past those people with their Brant
[00:31:45] things it was like it had like a giant
[00:31:46] um had a V8 that was like a a Chevy V8
[00:31:50] that was in there that somebody put in
[00:31:51] that was like actually a a car engine
[00:31:54] and my dad was like this is awesome cuz
[00:31:55] I know exactly how to work on it and
[00:31:57] taught me what to
[00:31:59] do all right I'm talking sorry talking

[00:53:32] we've been doing here now because there
[00:53:34] have been two people to buy a wasteland
[00:53:36] Adventure our wheel is upgraded for The
[00:53:40] Loot drop of the boss you now have extra
[00:53:43] different packs that are added in there
[00:53:45] so now I am going to add in mystery
[00:53:47] packs to the wheel to potentially be
[00:53:48] dropped if you beat the boss so here we
[00:53:51] go now you get a choice of your
[00:53:53] character whichever one you want at the
[00:53:54] top there
[00:53:57] and I can expand that if you need me to
[00:53:59] to help make it bigger just let me know
[00:54:00] and the Vault pack is whatever this
[00:54:02] thing is in the front there I I can show
[00:54:04] it to you if you want um or you can keep
[00:54:06] it as a surprise but I think it's from
[00:54:07] the early 2000 mid
[00:54:11] 2000s and I can do this here I'm going
[00:54:14] to do this here to help you span that
[00:54:17] make it a little bit
[00:54:19] bigger that way you can see which
[00:54:22] characters you want to
[00:54:25] be
[00:54:29] try mutant all right that's a good
[00:54:31] choice good choice mutants are a
[00:54:33] wonderful Choice
[00:54:35] there everybody likes mutants my kids
[00:54:38] like the
[00:54:39] mutants we all like the mutants all
[00:54:42] right put that
[00:54:44] back there we are you decide to be a
[00:54:48] mutant wandering through the Wasteland
[00:54:50] here now there's 78 cards 78 in the red
[00:54:52] and green and 12 in the blue you can
[00:54:55] tell me where to go I can pick random
[00:54:57] for you our buddy Jacob and let's see
[00:55:00] what happens as you wander through this
[00:55:02] Wasteland as a
[00:55:06] mutant maybe you're going to get lucky
[00:55:08] maybe we're going to come out with the
[00:55:09] strength enough to beat the boss and
[00:55:12] come out with the free
[00:55:15] pack or not the free pack the the $1
[00:55:18] pack that gets loot dropped and then you
[00:55:21] always get your free Vault pack now you
[00:55:23] can do anything you want I can do random
[00:55:25] here or or um I can pick uh numbers

[00:55:41] all I to do this try to like see which
[00:55:44] one's the last one standing well today
[00:55:46] it looks like it might be the front card
[00:55:48] well look at that last one standing is
[00:55:50] the front one today that was interesting
[00:55:52] we get this here and oh
[00:55:54] no mutant some treasure he picks that up
[00:55:58] and he goes oh my look at this is
[00:56:00] wonderful it was a trap he blows off his
[00:56:02] fingers and he's now down to one
[00:56:04] strength because he's wandering around
[00:56:06] the Wasteland with only four fingers
[00:56:07] after he blew three of them
[00:56:13] off well that doesn't make sense he's a
[00:56:16] mutant it doesn't matter he can have
[00:56:18] extra
[00:56:18] fingers here we go wandering through the
[00:56:21] Wasteland
[00:56:22] here we going to get one of these ones
[00:56:24] here come on come on come on come on
[00:56:27] here we go middle that one all right
[00:56:29] here we go let's see what we get here oh
[00:56:32] no an enemy faces off against the mutant
[00:56:36] and you're now stabbed and he stabs you
[00:56:39] with your and your and you try to block
[00:56:40] him and he actually chops off your whole
[00:56:42] hand you're now wandering through the
[00:56:44] Wasteland with zero strength that is no
[00:56:46] good we're sorry we are sorry for that
[00:56:49] we're not having some good luck this
[00:56:50] morning but maybe we'll find a companion
[00:56:52] here that'll help you along the way
[00:56:54] maybe we'll get that fungus dinosaur
[00:56:55] that'll help you through this Wasteland
[00:56:58] let's see what happens here we're going
[00:57:01] to go with this one that's kind of
[00:57:03] sticking out he's I think he's trying to
[00:57:04] tell us he wants to help you so we're
[00:57:06] going to go with this one let's see what
[00:57:07] happens here oh no oh
[00:57:11] no we do not have any luck there there
[00:57:14] is where is
[00:57:16] it you see in the
[00:57:20] distance a thror coming by that thoter
[00:57:24] dives down toward you you don't into the
[00:57:26] ground you bump your head on the ground
[00:57:28] now you're wandering around the
[00:57:29] Wasteland with a headache not knowing
[00:57:31] what's going on with minus one strength
[00:57:33] you see a vault in the distance you go
[00:57:34] you know what I need to get to this
[00:57:36] Vault over there that's going to make me
[00:57:37] safe I know those places are safe so you
[00:57:40] go and you
[00:57:41] find that Vault and as you're walking
[00:57:43] over a boss jumps out in front he goes
[00:57:45] aha face
[00:57:47] me and you will see what happens and oh
[00:57:50] no the T-Rex comes by he grabs you again
[00:57:54] throwing you around now you're wandering
[00:57:56] with one less arm cuz you gave the arm
[00:57:57] up that had less hands one less hand
[00:58:00] said I don't care I'm taking that but
[00:58:02] you get into that Vault you're a mutant

[00:58:07] Vault here for your Pat now this is a uh
[00:58:12] a pack of super heat skateboard trading
[00:58:15] cards somebody thought that was going to
[00:58:17] be something extravagant that they
[00:58:20] needed to save in a safe when they were
[00:58:21] in the vault when the world was coming
[00:58:23] to an end now remember everybody
[00:58:25] tomorrow night save tomorrow night show

[00:59:36] feros lake oh wow that's a really off
[00:59:40] centered cut and you got a little Mark
[00:59:41] there I've got a lot of these boxes had
[00:59:43] cuts off cut this whole box actually
[00:59:46] path of ancestry Mis cut there I'm going
[00:59:48] to put that off the side just put it in
[00:59:49] a in a sleeve cworth helper handy helper
[00:59:53] Vault 12 statistics simulation 112 I

[01:00:05] cumbered Hinterland Harbor Veronica
[01:00:09] descendant
[01:00:10] scribe basilic
[01:00:12] caller James wandering Dad hey that's me
[01:00:16] that's me Serge foiled me that's me
[01:00:18] right there see look at it kind of looks
[01:00:20] like me with a little beard
[01:00:22] there right kind of a little bit
[01:00:26] anyways I'm going to put that there
[01:00:28] because I like James Frank sanity surge
[01:00:30] foil entrapment maneuver surge foil
[01:00:33] that's a good hit if I remember nice
[01:00:35] buddy Crucible of the world of Worlds
[01:00:39] nice hit Crucible of
[01:00:42] Worlds this is a sweet pack dude in a
[01:00:45] nuclear fallout foil showcase pit booy
[01:00:50] with your radiation oh wow that was a
[01:00:52] pack
[01:00:53] P dude that Jacob that was an awesome
[01:00:56] Pat now I'm going to put this in we do
[01:00:58] these this way so they don't come out of
[01:01:00] the top loaders everybody in my show
[01:01:02] knows this and they've never had a
[01:01:04] problem with it and the reason why I do
[01:01:05] it is I'm going to show you right here
[01:01:07] cuz when you put these in a top loader
[01:01:09] what happens when you do it this way
[01:01:11] what happens for shipping is this occurs
[01:01:13] when you do it the way I'm doing it here
[01:01:15] now I will do it one at a time and I'll
[01:01:16] put like a piece of tape over the top
[01:01:18] but I've never had really anybody
[01:01:19] complain about me doing it this way
[01:01:22] because uh they don't slide
[01:01:24] out you're
[01:01:26] welcome very welcome you're very welcome
[01:01:29] my friend now the reason why we do this
[01:01:31] is because watch you got to give it a
[01:01:33] little tap to get it down then once it's
[01:01:36] down doesn't slide out because of
[01:01:39] physics there's some Physics for you all
[01:01:43] right so that's why I do it that way
[01:01:45] hopefully you are okay with that uh most
[01:01:47] people are now I'm going to take these
[01:01:49] two two here cuz I think entrapment if I
[01:01:52] remember right The Surge foil of
[01:01:53] entament was uh like7 to $10 at one
[01:01:56] point uh I don't know what it's at now
[01:01:59] but I'm going to put that in there so I
[01:02:00] can make sure it goes in a top loader L
[01:02:02] later and our miscut card that's even on
[01:02:04] the back look how miscut that is on even
[01:02:07] on the back of it that whole card that
[01:02:09] whole like there's a whole stack of
[01:02:11] cards that's miscut by uh per Fallout
[01:02:14] here at least that this box came with
[01:02:17] I'm going to do that here and then we're
[01:02:18] going to rip open this one and I'm gonna
[01:02:20] put up another another pack here let's
[01:02:24] see if we can get some more fun going

[01:41:31] they're always just Vault packs to say
[01:41:33] thank you for hanging out with us where
[01:41:35] it comes out just as the potential of
[01:41:36] you beating the boss so that the boss
[01:41:39] drops some loot that's what it is we
[01:41:41] want the boss dropping loot for the
[01:41:42] wastelanders and I think anybody that
[01:41:43] plays the game next there may be some
[01:41:45] loot that gets dropped anyways so I feel
[01:41:47] like it's time to drop some
[01:41:49] loot I do feel like it's time that the
[01:41:52] boss has to drop some loot here maybe
[01:41:54] one of you guys will uh help to get that
[01:42:00] occurring we'll find
[01:42:03] out all right nice OC likes
[01:42:07] that I think I'm saying O and
[01:42:10] space I don't have my glasses on right
[01:42:12] now that's the only reason why I'm
[01:42:13] squating a little bit I'm going to give
[01:42:15] this one you know what we're going to
[01:42:16] call this two strength on the adventure
[01:42:18] in the Wasteland normally it's one but I
[01:42:20] want to do two I want to give us a
[01:42:21] chance to beat the boss here cuz I'm the
[01:42:23] one that makes up a you know you know
[01:42:24] I'm the one that tells you what the
[01:42:25] strength is here normally we' go one but
[01:42:28] I'm going to give you a little extra
[01:42:29] boost here that's what I'm going to do

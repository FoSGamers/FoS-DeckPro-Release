20241016

[00:00:02] we going here I think I think it's
[00:00:06] working I think it's
[00:00:11] working let's see I believe so can you
[00:00:15] hear
[00:00:17] me can you guys hear
[00:00:20] me I think you
[00:00:24] can all right I think that's working
[00:00:26] there
[00:00:28] too okay
[00:00:32] we're
[00:00:37] good let me
[00:00:42] uh there you go all right I think we're
[00:00:47] good I think it's
[00:00:51] working let's
[00:00:54] see I believe it
[00:00:58] is how's everybody doing today we have
[00:01:01] something intriguing we're going to try
[00:01:02] today there's
[00:01:04] a looks like it is set up and working
[00:01:09] nice
[00:01:12] there and there take the
[00:01:17] working
[00:01:18] perfect you like
[00:01:21] it all righty so we're trying something
[00:01:24] a little different
[00:01:26] today use the brakes here we're using
[00:01:29] kind of as a virtual pull walks in a way
[00:01:32] but the way that we're doing it is we're
[00:01:33] going to do it a little a little
[00:01:34] different we're going to do a call a
[00:01:36] little derby where we're going to start
[00:01:38] it
[00:01:40] as I'm guessing it's going be slow to
[00:01:42] start the day out so we'll start it out
[00:01:44] with more things like
[00:01:47] this
[00:01:50] where we'll do some singles as the buyer
[00:01:53] giveaways but we'll have what it does is
[00:01:55] we'll run
[00:01:56] them and depending on where we hit if we
[00:01:59] get our
[00:02:03] goal each one of these are to uh 75 so
[00:02:07] they're all even if you go look at the
[00:02:08] breaks so the goal for the first one
[00:02:11] will be to get
[00:02:15] um to a certain amount of points all
[00:02:18] right now I think I'm I did it right
[00:02:21] where you get the right amount each time
[00:02:24] so like you're so with a collector
[00:02:27] booster the where you go with death any
[00:02:30] one of those ones when I run the when I
[00:02:32] run them
[00:02:34] as um the auctions
[00:02:38] here Auto
[00:02:43] randomize should be on for all of them
[00:02:46] hold on a second why is an auto
[00:02:47] randomize on for
[00:02:49] that so when I start running something
[00:02:52] for instance I say you know you guys
[00:02:54] want to go with uh we're going to go
[00:02:56] start these and we're going to start a
[00:02:57] buyers giveway and it's going to go for
[00:02:58] five minutes the way that I was planning
[00:03:00] on doing that well actually we'll throw
[00:03:01] out a give a regular giveaway for a
[00:03:03] minute so we can explain some of it one
[00:03:05] two three four five six seven
[00:03:08] eight we'll give it that 110 why
[00:03:13] not all
[00:03:15] righty going to do this we're going to
[00:03:17] roll see what we get how's you got how's
[00:03:20] everybody doing this morning
[00:03:22] though hopefully you're doing all right
[00:03:24] number four so this is our test day one
[00:03:27] two three four we test out new ideas to
[00:03:30] see if you guys like them is really what
[00:03:32] it
[00:03:33] is your AC finally came oh nice you get
[00:03:37] ruined
[00:03:38] after uh something going
[00:03:43] on like a storm or something anyways I
[00:03:46] was trying to say was we be doing this
[00:03:47] where we
[00:03:50] have certain amount of points that the
[00:03:52] goal is to get to all right so for
[00:03:56] instance we'll say 15 for the first
[00:03:59] first one what I'm going to do is I'm
[00:04:02] going to just do this quick I'm not
[00:04:03] going to have any you don't need to buy
[00:04:04] them jump in on it right now or not you
[00:04:06] don't need well you could I guess if you
[00:04:08] really wanted to it's just me adding out
[00:04:09] the certain amount that gets to it so we
[00:04:13] are going to uh do
[00:04:15] this let me get the
[00:04:20] um let's do this here where is Conquest
[00:04:24] oh there it is there it is there's
[00:04:26] Conquest Conquest is at the
[00:04:28] top I'll get some Mae in or
[00:04:34] something thank you so what I'm going to
[00:04:37] do here is I'm going to run this one and
[00:04:38] it's
[00:04:40] randomize singles that are in here now
[00:04:43] the way that we do this is for the raid
[00:04:45] the game what are you
[00:04:47] doing yeah it is yeah it does say that
[00:04:50] but it's a the costume yeah I know
[00:04:59] ah bad okay yeah I understand
[00:05:02] that so we're going to run actually you
[00:05:04] know what we're going to run the
[00:05:05] giveaway first then we're going to
[00:05:06] explain some of this so that while you
[00:05:07] guys hanging out you can listen to it I
[00:05:09] think it's going to be kind of fun I
[00:05:10] don't know you might think it's fun you
[00:05:11] might not we'll find
[00:05:14] out my what all right so we're going to
[00:05:17] do this and and the way that we'll run
[00:05:20] these is the break is going to be done
[00:05:23] randomly I'm going to run them for five
[00:05:24] seconds only all right and for instance
[00:05:27] this one here they're all going to run
[00:05:30] at
[00:05:31] $2 because that's what the average is
[00:05:34] for everything that's in
[00:05:35] there okay and each one of them I'm only
[00:05:38] going to be running for five seconds of
[00:05:40] sudden
[00:05:42] death all right so that's how we're
[00:05:44] doing them each one of them is going to
[00:05:45] run that way 5 Seconds of sudden death
[00:05:47] and we're going to go plow through them
[00:05:48] really quickly and they're all going to
[00:05:49] have their own price so for instance
[00:05:51] this one's $2 so I'm going to run that
[00:05:54] you're going to have 5 seconds I'm going
[00:05:55] to L get ready to go to the next one
[00:05:58] which will be say in line line the next
[00:06:00] one in line for instance this time it
[00:06:01] would be the uh death happens to be in
[00:06:04] line now death for
[00:06:08] instance their one is though is a higher
[00:06:12] one but it gets you you don't have to
[00:06:13] spend you don't have to do as many so
[00:06:15] say somebody wanted to go and buy some
[00:06:19] death let me get to uh the right amount
[00:06:21] right thing
[00:06:24] here all right you would only need to it
[00:06:29] would be
[00:06:33] this come
[00:06:38] on all right that's easy
[00:06:42] enough start it there we go and we do
[00:06:44] that again and I'd run it like this
[00:06:45] because you could get any of the things
[00:06:47] in there at
[00:06:48] random we run that I will'll keep going
[00:06:51] through them every five seconds we're
[00:06:52] going to go through it for five minutes
[00:06:53] as the uh as a buyer's giveaway is going
[00:06:56] and depending on what happens where you
[00:06:58] get or how many where we get here here
[00:06:59] like how whoever however many
[00:07:03] horses are along the race how far along
[00:07:06] you get with your
[00:07:07] horse is what's going to be given away
[00:07:09] for the buyers to give away at the end
[00:07:10] so for instance if we
[00:07:12] do you know one one pack was sold of a
[00:07:16] of a b of a collector boosters but not
[00:07:19] much was sold of anything else it might
[00:07:21] be a bunch of singles that are out here
[00:07:23] but say we're up and we have like 20
[00:07:24] people playing we have a bunch of them
[00:07:26] going hey Valentin how you doing today
[00:07:30] we would
[00:07:33] um valtina
[00:07:36] Lux valtina Lux what sorry I was getting
[00:07:39] that wrong but for instance say we have
[00:07:41] a bunch of people in here what will end
[00:07:42] up being is it'll be say packs that'll
[00:07:44] go up here all right so it'll be uh say
[00:07:48] for instance for the each horse that
[00:07:49] you're racing to catch up to uh to hit
[00:07:51] the end to hit the goal would be say for
[00:07:53] instance for a single say we had a bunch
[00:07:55] of people in there the single might
[00:07:56] actually be this that's going to be
[00:07:58] there if that's hit for the end but if
[00:07:59] we have uh only a few single maybe it's
[00:08:01] only something like you know like this
[00:08:03] that's out as a single as an
[00:08:05] option um but say where we have packs
[00:08:08] you're going through and we want to go
[00:08:10] with some of the ones that have packs
[00:08:11] well maybe it doesn't start out with a
[00:08:12] lot of high value ones maybe they're
[00:08:14] only like this if you get hit the goal
[00:08:16] of them all right but that's kind of how
[00:08:20] um but it grows with the more people
[00:08:22] that are in here hanging out with the uh
[00:08:24] in the derby
[00:08:30] correct so what it does is it brings you
[00:08:33] I think I put the rules and like kind of
[00:08:35] a little bit of notes in there on how it
[00:08:37] runs but pretty much it is every the
[00:08:41] five minute Derby is you're influencing
[00:08:42] the outcome of the of everything by
[00:08:44] purchasing what is available in each one
[00:08:47] of the um
[00:08:48] breaks and every I either was a single
[00:08:52] pack whatever it is all contributing to
[00:08:53] your Horsemen now so each one of them
[00:08:57] will be say singles every single is spot
[00:08:59] is one point every um everyone that's um
[00:09:03] bought
[00:09:04] from Conquest is one point everything
[00:09:07] from war is two everything from famine
[00:09:12] is three and everything from Death is
[00:09:16] Five Points so what it boils down to is
[00:09:18] how many points are added up I'll say
[00:09:19] say we going to 15 in the first round
[00:09:21] try to get to 15 so say for instance 15
[00:09:24] of the things sell from Conquest first
[00:09:28] or
[00:09:30] we have five of the other spots sell uh
[00:09:33] five of famine sell first because there
[00:09:36] wereth three then that would be the one
[00:09:38] that
[00:09:39] wins if that makes any sense Point wise
[00:09:42] I hopefully that makes sense there I
[00:09:44] might need a simplify it a little
[00:09:52] bit wondering if I could make it there
[00:09:54] so I was trying to make it so that the
[00:09:56] every the box was always the same and
[00:09:58] even but maybe I should make it the box
[00:10:00] different each time this is testing this
[00:10:02] is why we call a little bit of a testing
[00:10:04] day this is the first day we're doing it
[00:10:05] we're testing it out trying to figure
[00:10:06] out if we can get it to
[00:10:09] work all right so yeah so when it's in
[00:10:11] practice so so let me uh let me do this
[00:10:13] I'm going to make something like this
[00:10:16] here we'll call this
[00:10:21] uh so we'll say um we'll explain what it
[00:10:27] is each con
[00:10:32] Quest we'll call um
[00:10:37] say
[00:10:42] Conquest one
[00:10:44] point put I'll put a little chart up on
[00:10:46] the board here make it a little
[00:10:50] easier maybe that'll help you know
[00:10:53] sometimes that helps
[00:10:55] War tube point
[00:11:09] famine there's three
[00:11:13] points and then
[00:11:16] death is Five
[00:11:25] Points all right let me do that I'm G to
[00:11:28] go like this
[00:11:34] move that here let maybe make it a
[00:11:36] little bit easier to see that might help
[00:11:38] that might help put a little grid here
[00:11:40] so you guys can see what it looks like
[00:11:43] see what I'm talking about
[00:11:45] here when uh when I'm meaning like the
[00:11:47] the points and
[00:11:52] whatever that might help I'm figuring
[00:12:01] all right we'll do
[00:12:04] that let me do a little screenshot that
[00:12:06] might help I figure actually somebody
[00:12:09] was say you know make it a little easier
[00:12:10] for you guys to visually see things
[00:12:14] right we're visual right we're visual
[00:12:19] people so let's add a
[00:12:23] visual hey what's up buddy yeah you can
[00:12:29] going to school yep i' love you buddy
[00:12:32] have a good day you'll be back in a
[00:12:33] little while
[00:12:35] okay
[00:12:40] yep all right there we
[00:12:42] go have that that'll be an easy enough
[00:12:52] one right there so here that might help
[00:12:55] a little bit so you can kind of see what
[00:12:56] it is there each one of the horses out
[00:12:58] of the brakes there
[00:12:59] be that so each one of the that's what
[00:13:02] you get per thing all right now we can
[00:13:06] have another one here you'll be able to
[00:13:09] see the numbers that are going across on
[00:13:11] the board how many you're at so you know
[00:13:13] where each one's worth that many but
[00:13:16] we're trying to get to say 15 for the
[00:13:18] first
[00:13:19] round
[00:13:21] okay so I can do it where I can even
[00:13:24] have a chart too that might help too I
[00:13:26] can do a live chart there we go let's do
[00:13:28] another spreadsheet
[00:13:33] do it that way and I'll put another one
[00:13:35] out there with another thing here what
[00:13:38] get rid of that I don't need
[00:13:41] that and put that together with this one
[00:13:43] that
[00:13:45] works then we can have a live sheet here
[00:13:47] too
[00:13:49] even where we
[00:13:52] go like
[00:13:55] that copy this
[00:13:59] put it right
[00:14:06] here and do
[00:14:12] that
[00:14:16] so do it like this
[00:14:32] we'll say there's there that might well
[00:14:35] that might help we'll see if that
[00:14:43] help capture I'm already on the capture
[00:14:45] I don't need to worry about that I think
[00:14:46] I already have it here hold
[00:14:56] on it is there aha
[00:15:03] well that's not going to work
[00:15:06] well H you know we'll just get rid of
[00:15:17] that
[00:15:20] whatever do
[00:15:23] this down over here in a way
[00:15:31] there so see how there yeah that might
[00:15:34] help to do it a little bit easier should
[00:15:36] we do another column though
[00:15:39] maybe that way we know say we're going
[00:15:42] with how many points each one are then
[00:15:45] we can know what we're getting for him
[00:15:46] each time yeah that might help you guys
[00:15:49] going to you guys let me know if this
[00:15:51] makes sense or not or I'm being a
[00:15:52] freaking idiot I'm probably being an
[00:15:54] idiot but
[00:15:56] anyways we thought that might be
[00:15:58] assistance there to show
[00:16:03] you what I uh why is it not going all

[00:18:44] start each round we're going to start a
[00:18:46] race as a uh five minutes we're going to
[00:18:50] start a buyer giveaway and each one of
[00:18:52] the horses that are up here will be
[00:18:54] associated with one of those now Point
[00:18:59] horse all right you can see there is
[00:19:00] related to something we're going with

[00:19:19] good chance that
[00:19:20] happened good chance that happened so I
[00:19:24] going to go back to explaining what we
[00:19:25] were doing here is these are all kind of
[00:19:28] like the singles that I have that I put
[00:19:29] off to the side so each one of these I'm
[00:19:32] going to run for 5 seconds each one of
[00:19:33] these buyers give uh one of the um each
[00:19:35] one of the braks will be running for
[00:19:37] five seconds they're going to worth a
[00:19:38] certain amount of
[00:19:39] points and what we'll do is we're going
[00:19:41] to do this we'll put it up where we'll
[00:19:44] track the points here and I'll say um we
[00:19:47] want to get to
[00:19:49] 15 all right so the goal is to get to 15
[00:19:52] what we'll do is I'm going to have to
[00:19:53] minimize this today hold on let me
[00:19:55] shrink that down why is that so goddamn
[00:19:57] large
[00:20:03] could address that
[00:20:06] quickly there we go
[00:20:10] then it's Whoever likes what more is
[00:20:12] pretty much what it is is we're going to
[00:20:13] have certain type of singles or or
[00:20:15] things or packs or you we'll have um if
[00:20:17] we can have enough people jumping in at
[00:20:19] some point maybe we'll have a bunch of
[00:20:20] packs but we'll have different type of
[00:20:21] giveaways going out and it's just
[00:20:23] whatever one happens be whatever wins
[00:20:25] that's a giveaway that is going to go up
[00:20:26] for the buyer giveaway at the end the
[00:20:28] more that participate is the larger that
[00:20:30] it ends up becoming so say for instance
[00:20:32] today we
[00:20:33] say the first round I'll go is a few
[00:20:36] singles we'll put out all right we'll
[00:20:38] grab some singles to throw out here in
[00:20:40] the first round as some things that
[00:20:44] people may
[00:20:45] want and we'll do
[00:20:50] um know some lower ones not some higher
[00:20:53] ones we'll do some lower price ones
[00:20:56] because we're starting it out here but
[00:20:58] maybe we'll get some some medium ones
[00:20:59] here too low medium ones where did my
[00:21:02] all my ones go I had them
[00:21:05] earlier so say for
[00:21:11] instance
[00:21:16] whatever ah there we
[00:21:20] go throw something like
[00:21:30] okay so like for
[00:21:32] instance each horse will be r related to
[00:21:34] something so say for instance the uh
[00:21:37] we'll move this one out of the way a
[00:21:38] little bit make it a little bit better
[00:21:40] down here for you to see say for
[00:21:42] instance Conquest is
[00:21:47] this
[00:21:50] then war is
[00:21:53] that or we'll say war is that then we'll
[00:21:56] say famine is this
[00:21:59] and then we'd say like maybe
[00:22:03] um this is death what we would do is for
[00:22:09] five minutes ID rotate I run a buyers
[00:22:12] giveaway for five minutes I would rotate
[00:22:14] through every 5 Seconds one of
[00:22:18] the um breaks and the first one two hit
[00:22:22] 15 will
[00:22:23] win all right and that's the one that
[00:22:25] we'll run our pack for the way that
[00:22:29] we'll see which one goes first is I'm
[00:22:30] always just going to roll a dice to see
[00:22:31] which one goes first and it's which one
[00:22:33] in the order here is so for instance
[00:22:35] three in my order that I have here is
[00:22:37] famine so I'd go that one to the next
[00:22:39] one to the next one to the next one I'd
[00:22:41] SP run them all at what the price they
[00:22:43] are supposed to
[00:22:46] be if I can get it to show
[00:22:48] up and you decide if you want them and
[00:22:51] you can see what's in each one of those
[00:22:52] by the way you don't need to have me
[00:22:56] guessing for you you can see exactly
[00:22:58] what's in each one of
[00:23:03] those I don't hide at all I don't like
[00:23:06] hide anything on
[00:23:11] anyone all
[00:23:16] right so say for instance
[00:23:19] famine
[00:23:21] is this we start the
[00:23:25] auction i' run it for this amount of
[00:23:27] time
[00:23:29] and we' go all right who wants to do it
[00:23:31] and then if you jump in on it every five
[00:23:33] seconds we'd run through that then I'd
[00:23:35] run to the next one which would be right
[00:23:38] after
[00:23:39] it is
[00:23:43] war I'd run that one why is this not
[00:23:47] going this is a little glitchy for the
[00:23:49] first time that you run it every now and
[00:23:51] again with uh with whatnot here so here
[00:23:56] we go there you go ah the first time you
[00:23:59] run it so that one there and everything
[00:24:00] that you can see in the break is what's
[00:24:03] available
[00:24:04] there didn't it
[00:24:07] run no that's not
[00:24:15] right there we go that one would run
[00:24:18] five seconds and I'd run through maybe
[00:24:20] did then I'd run through that then I'd
[00:24:23] go to the next one at the top and we
[00:24:25] just go through these
[00:24:26] continuously until
[00:24:28] why is it doing seven seven I have to
[00:24:31] change the price each time okay I see
[00:24:32] what it's doing it's going to make me
[00:24:34] change the price each time no it's not
[00:24:35] supposed
[00:24:38] to well there you go I'll have to change
[00:24:39] the price each time at the correct price
[00:24:41] but it'll do that I'll go through each
[00:24:43] one and for five seconds everybody will
[00:24:44] get a chance and I'll rotate through all
[00:24:46] of
[00:24:49] them this one
[00:24:51] is
[00:24:53] that I just keep rotating through them
[00:24:56] until
[00:24:59] you guys have the five minutes done and
[00:25:01] whichever one has the
[00:25:04] most of the points at the
[00:25:10] end will
[00:25:13] win if that makes any
[00:25:17] sense and then when it
[00:25:21] wins that's what we go and we do um we
[00:25:25] put with our other stuff well that's
[00:25:26] where you get for your giveaway
[00:25:29] I don't know it's kind of like a little
[00:25:30] little little race there I'm trying to
[00:25:31] get things running the first day like I
[00:25:34] said sometimes the first time things
[00:25:35] aren't the smooth this but we're getting
[00:25:37] to try to figure that one out so let me
[00:25:39] get this here it is that that
[00:25:52] is I think that's what it is
[00:25:55] there yes
[00:25:59] so I don't know maybe if that makes any
[00:26:02] sense for anybody but here here is our
[00:26:03] break our uh our pack here that we're
[00:26:05] giving away say thank you for everybody
[00:26:08] and so what I'll do here is I'm going to
[00:26:09] run a buyers giveaway right after we
[00:26:10] open this pack up and we'll see how this
[00:26:12] goes and if we have enough a lot of
[00:26:13] people that join eventually what I'll do
[00:26:15] say it's like 30 points and it'll be
[00:26:16] packs that are given away if that makes
[00:26:19] sense and that'll be the pack that'll be
[00:26:20] given away at the end of uh the buyer
[00:26:22] give away and it's just really they're
[00:26:23] all going to be pretty much equal to
[00:26:24] each other but just whatever one you
[00:26:26] like more is what you're going after and
[00:26:28] what people want or maybe somebody
[00:26:29] thinks they want you know maybe somebody
[00:26:31] likes P packs so they go for packs

[00:34:58] big collector boosters and bundles do
[00:35:01] you want collector boosters and
[00:35:03] bundles I don't
[00:35:05] know collector boosters and bundles now
[00:35:08] if you're a buyer you can get in the
[00:35:09] buyer giveaway there all right make sure
[00:35:11] you remember that or are you think it's
[00:35:13] going to be do you like those like sets
[00:35:17] do you like those types of
[00:35:20] things or do you want some medium ground
[00:35:23] play boosters like modern Horizon 3
[00:35:25] maybe modern Horizon 2 things like that
[00:35:29] I don't know we'll find out oh Goblin
[00:35:32] thinks maybe one of those ones what does
[00:35:34] Goblin
[00:35:36] get you got a commander Master draft oh
[00:35:39] look at that one that's what Goblin
[00:35:41] thinks it is all right so what we did
[00:35:43] did we just do uh we just
[00:35:45] did famine we need to do
[00:35:49] War oh no why does it keep doing it
[00:35:54] war war here this is what you have next
[00:35:58] for war you're going to get either one
[00:36:00] of like a rabn bloom bro and ion draft a
[00:36:05] murders are Carlo draft one of those
[00:36:07] types of things that we got there
[00:36:09] anything that is associated with the
[00:36:10] number there it should have been the
[00:36:11] pack but that happened to go with the
[00:36:12] price instead of the pack that was
[00:36:14] associated with it whatever all right
[00:36:16] we're G have one more race here actually
[00:36:18] you know what I don't think we're going
[00:36:19] to get through enough of them we're not
[00:36:20] going to get through every one of them
[00:36:21] so we're going to stop there we're going
[00:36:23] to have to see where we got we have
[00:36:25] 74 74 oh it looks like
[00:36:28] we have a winner I do believe with
[00:36:33] famine because we only had
[00:36:36] one we had two and we had three and the
[00:36:41] race was to 15
[00:36:43] famine famine it was so that means the
[00:36:46] buyer's giveaway for those of you that
[00:36:48] were hanging out and participating the
[00:36:50] buyer giveaway ended up being this
[00:36:54] because that is what was associated with
[00:36:56] famine
[00:36:58] if that makes any sense what do you guys
[00:36:59] think I that was kind of
[00:37:02] fun our death had a big zero nobody
[00:37:05] wanted death nobody wanted
[00:37:14] death all right the buyers give away
[00:37:16] went to there you go my

[00:55:16] planet here that's what you think it's
[00:55:18] GNA oh no it went the wrong price hold
[00:55:20] on let me correct why does it always do
[00:55:21] that right away let me I need to fix
[00:55:22] that don't do that that's not the right
[00:55:24] price that's supposed to be two two
[00:55:27] these are singles do you think it's
[00:55:28] going to be Conquest people are going to
[00:55:29] go around little conquests around the
[00:55:31] world destroying little places I'm
[00:55:33] taking your village over your village is
[00:55:35] now mine next door neighbor is now your
[00:55:38] house not their
[00:55:39] house I don't know is it going to be
[00:55:42] maybe it will be death just dropping
[00:55:44] bombs on
[00:55:46] people or maybe famine will come along
[00:55:49] there will be no food for
[00:55:52] anybody everybody will starve maybe
[00:55:54] that's what you think will happen you're
[00:55:55] going to get your yourself uh maybe a
[00:55:57] collector booster midnight hunt a modern
[00:55:59] Horizon 3 play
[00:56:00] booster or maybe you think it's going to
[00:56:03] be War seems like War may be the one
[00:56:06] that we think is going to happen
[00:56:08] currently war is the one that's going to
[00:56:10] destroy our planet what are you going to
[00:56:13] get with war it's going to be either
[00:56:15] it's going to be like I said a pack
[00:56:16] that's related to that price range
[00:56:19] there all righty you think it's that we
[00:56:22] still going we have a minute left do we
[00:56:24] think Conquest
[00:56:26] Conquest with any of these singles that
[00:56:28] are in there Conquest there's a bunch of
[00:56:30] singles in there is it going to be
[00:56:32] Conquest that comes out with a win and
[00:56:33] each one of these are associated with
[00:56:34] this and if we don't hit the 15 points
[00:56:37] we do a pull from our buyer box which is
[00:56:39] this right over here all right Conquest
[00:56:42] somebody says Conquest might be it all
[00:56:44] right oh we got that nice one there or
[00:56:46] is it going to be death coming out
[00:56:48] somebody going to come out and drop a
[00:56:49] bomb and be like no it is death that
[00:56:52] will be the one to take over and pull
[00:56:55] out some collector boost or a bundle I
[00:56:57] don't
[00:56:57] know we'll find out oh Raven thinks so
[00:57:04] Raven oh we got a bloom Barrow collector
[00:57:06] all right is it going to be maybe it
[00:57:09] will be
[00:57:11] famine maybe it shall be
[00:57:14] famine and everybody will starve on this
[00:57:17] planet everybody shall starve on this
[00:57:22] planet that's what will happen oh and we
[00:57:25] are done we almost made it one more but
[00:57:26] we didn't make it all and Goblin was our
[00:57:29] giveaway winner all right Goblin and now
[00:57:32] I got to add it up quickly to see where
[00:57:34] we were we
[00:57:36] had
[00:57:38] Conquest with one
[00:57:40] point we had death with oh death came in
[00:57:46] out with Five Points we're getting to 15
[00:57:48] I think we could get to 15 total here
[00:57:51] then we had
[00:57:53] famine famine we had nothing from famine
[00:57:57] but we had war
[00:58:01] war we went down
[00:58:05] to all right we went
[00:58:11] War had three War had three there so War
[00:58:16] may have won here I think War had three
[00:58:18] that round
[00:58:20] right let me make sure I get these right
[00:58:23] and famine had zero I want to make sure
[00:58:25] I have that right
[00:58:28] right we had brace end yep there we go
[00:58:33] death we had one
[00:58:35] death we had a conquest we had one war
[00:58:39] two
[00:58:43] War yep that was it two Wars it was only
[00:58:46] two Wars two Wars two Wars it was only

[01:09:57] down there let's put you in a
[01:10:00] bag and then we'll uh we'll try this
[01:10:03] again here all right we'll try this
[01:10:05] again here and see if you guys like it
[01:10:08] like tomorrow like I said we're going to
[01:10:10] do this on Friday I mean if you guys
[01:10:12] like this and it's a good one it seems
[01:10:13] like we're having some fun you know what
[01:10:15] the way we do this is every so I got the
[01:10:17] rules kind of like out there but
[01:10:19] everyone it is is
[01:10:21] um every five minutes we have a we run
[01:10:25] Derby for 5 minutes and it's a buyer
[01:10:27] giveaway now the buyer giveaway if you
[01:10:28] happen to get
[01:10:31] currently last time that was the Horus
[01:10:33] Point that's our Horus points
[01:10:36] okay and this is our um points that we
[01:10:40] had last time so what what you're
[01:10:41] telling everybody is the goal here is to
[01:10:43] get to 15 currently because we haven't
[01:10:44] hit 15 yet our goal is to get to 15 and
[01:10:47] if we get to 15 that's when these are
[01:10:48] given away so for instance say three
[01:10:52] death report now today just now there's
[01:10:54] only I the adjust it so we have our
[01:10:56] correct numbers so we're at
[01:10:59] 73 left out of
[01:11:04] Conquest then we have
[01:11:09] War
[01:11:10] as 72
[01:11:14] left all right then we have famine has
[01:11:20] 74 left which is exactly the same then
[01:11:23] death though this time death came in
[01:11:26] with 74 left all right so what happens
[01:11:28] is this how we do it is we say we're
[01:11:30] trying to get to 15 the goal is to get
[01:11:32] to
[01:11:33] 15 all right so we're going to run each
[01:11:36] one of our
[01:11:37] breaks really quickly for five seconds
[01:11:41] where it's pretty much just to see uh
[01:11:43] which and and which ones buy more
[01:11:46] frequently all right who likes packs who
[01:11:49] likes singles more and that type of
[01:11:51] thing so the way we run it is I'm going
[01:11:53] to run a buyer giveaway right after this
[01:11:55] I'm going to roll this dice right now
[01:11:56] we're going to see which starts first
[01:11:57] number one all right we're starting at
[01:11:59] the top which me starting at Conquest
[01:12:01] which is the first one that was put in
[01:12:02] today all right with that as the first
[01:12:05] one put in today you see all those
[01:12:08] things that are available in there so if
[01:12:09] you go into the break right now if you
[01:12:12] go and look at any of those breaks and
[01:12:13] you look at the spots and any of the
[01:12:14] braks you can see exactly there's a tab
[01:12:16] that'll tell you you'll see what's in
[01:12:19] there all right you get
[01:12:21] a one of our singles from over here a
[01:12:24] chance of one of these let me see where

[01:25:54] that goes now I have to go and tally all
[01:25:56] of our uh our numbers up here again so
[01:25:59] we're at um The Conquest is
[01:26:03] 70 the reason why I'm doing as breaks is
[01:26:06] because at the end of the stream here I
[01:26:08] plan on um heading them all a start so
[01:26:11] all of you that participated will know
[01:26:13] and we'll do a giveaway of some kind
[01:26:15] depending on how many people here it
[01:26:16] really depends on how big it ends up
[01:26:19] being all right there we
[01:26:22] go to clear those
[01:26:29] and there's are
[01:26:32] that there's are
[01:26:34] that and now we going to do it
[01:26:38] again going to try it again
[01:26:43] here how's
[01:26:45] this this is a this we're going to do
[01:26:48] this we're going to change this we're
[01:26:50] going to make it go like this
[01:26:54] and
[01:26:59] then I'm going to
[01:27:08] do
[01:27:10] this these are all about the same price
[01:27:14] same price range so there you go we'll
[01:27:18] be one of these three so it's going to
[01:27:20] be for the first one
[01:27:24] so for um Conquest we have
[01:27:30] Conquest actually let me put it in order
[01:27:32] so that everybody sees it correct
[01:27:34] Conquest
[01:27:39] death um Conquest
[01:27:45] death
[01:27:47] famine and then
[01:27:49] War those are how we're going to put
[01:27:51] them out there right now
[01:27:54] hopefully you guys can see those all I
[01:27:55] think you can by zooming in that's how
[01:27:58] we're going to do that we'll zoom in a
[01:28:00] little bit
[01:28:02] again there you go so those
[01:28:06] are conquests in order of the breaks
[01:28:09] Conquest death
[01:28:12] famine war that way it's a little bit
[01:28:15] more explained easier to
[01:28:21] see all right now I just have it down
[01:28:24] here in a different order because that's
[01:28:26] just how I had it set up and my things
[01:28:28] there what we're playing a little bit of
[01:28:32] game here all right so we're going to
[01:28:34] run the break
[01:28:36] again we're going to run a buyer
[01:28:38] giveaway another one have to start it
[01:28:41] again here another giveaway try one
[01:28:46] more try it one more time
[01:28:51] here no
[01:28:54] add quick
[01:28:58] ad d rby
[01:29:01] y now we have singles there packs and
[01:29:04] it's like I figure this will be a good
[01:29:06] game for Friday but this is our testing
[01:29:09] day we like to do and we like to test
[01:29:10] things
[01:29:16] out that's what Tuesdays are kind of
[01:29:19] like our testing days t for
[01:29:22] Tuesday so there we
[01:29:26] go we'll do that and we're going to run
[01:29:29] through we're going to try this again we
[01:29:30] going to see where we
[01:29:31] stand who wants what who wants to
[01:29:36] participate so here we go we're going to
[01:29:38] run one it's going to end up being up to
[01:29:40] we're going to have to get to
[01:29:42] um 15 points all right so
[01:29:45] for we'll do
[01:29:48] 10
[01:29:51] 15 we'll have to put our points down so
[01:29:53] we see how much much it is in in each
[01:29:55] one actually make it a little
[01:29:56] easier yeah that'll
[01:29:58] work that'll
[01:30:01] work we'll do
[01:30:06] um we'll call this
[01:30:11] 10 then we'll say
[01:30:13] [Music]
[01:30:14] War we
[01:30:20] need yeah I think War can be eight
[01:30:29] then we're going to go famine
[01:30:31] [Music]
[01:30:34] nine and we'll
[01:30:37] say
[01:30:39] death we'll call death
[01:30:43] 10 that way we have a little bit better
[01:30:47] uh chance of getting things there let's
[01:30:50] see if that shows all right on the
[01:30:51] screen oh that shows fine on the screen
[01:30:53] that F on the screen there all right
[01:30:55] here we go we'll run that that way you
[01:30:57] know what we're going to Conquest we're
[01:30:58] trying to get to 10 War you're trying to
[01:31:00] get to eight so that's four of the wars
[01:31:03] Quest trying to get to nine which is
[01:31:05] three of the famine ones or we're trying
[01:31:09] to get to 10 on death which is Five
[01:31:12] Points each so that would be
[01:31:14] 10 uh so you get two of those pretty
[01:31:16] much or should I just put down we need
[01:31:19] 10 hold on we need 10 for
[01:31:26] three two that's what we're shooting
[01:31:30] for that might help actually that makes
[01:31:32] more sense that's what we're shooting
[01:31:34] for out of each one of those being
[01:31:36] purchased so if there's two of them
[01:31:37] purchased for death we're going to give
[01:31:40] that away if there's three of them
[01:31:42] purchased for famine we're going to be
[01:31:44] giving that
[01:31:45] away if there's four purchased for war
[01:31:47] we're going to give that away if
[01:31:49] Conquest has 10 we're going to give that
[01:31:50] away if none of them reach their goal
[01:31:54] that is what the giveaway will be it'll
[01:31:56] be one of the polls from there which is
[01:31:57] our bonus pull box so we're going to
[01:31:59] start our derby
[01:32:03] now all right and I forgot to roll the
[01:32:05] dice two well that worked landed on two
[01:32:09] all right we're going to start on the
[01:32:10] second one for the break which means
[01:32:12] death is where we're starting
[01:32:15] at they all run for 25 they all run for
[01:32:19] five seconds so that means death is only
[01:32:21] needed twice two D two deaths
[01:32:26] famine famine is it gonna be famine you
[01:32:29] only need three
[01:32:31] famine to get what's up
[01:32:34] there or is it going to be war or you
[01:32:37] need four for
[01:32:39] war and it's always going to be a pack
[01:32:41] associated with priceing these now you
[01:32:42] can see all of them in
[01:32:44] there or is it going to be the singles
[01:32:47] where you need 10 to get to it my
[01:32:52] friends oh why didn't It Go
[01:32:56] that's
[01:32:59] 10 and then you get the Spy

[01:37:32] that time frame of the Derby let me know
[01:37:34] I'm going to stop in three two one you

[01:37:38] time frame all right there you go well
[01:37:41] so you being the one purchased oh don't
[01:37:44] worry little bit here's the here's how
[01:37:45] the Derby goes all right here's how the
[01:37:47] Derby goes there's four horsemen I'm
[01:37:49] going to have animations on Friday if
[01:37:51] people like this all right and this is
[01:37:53] how the Derby goes there's four horsemen
[01:37:55] okay and as you see here each one of
[01:37:59] their Horsemen has a certain amount for
[01:38:02] instance the there was only one conquest
[01:38:07] which was one single is that was taken
[01:38:09] there there was no Tien from
[01:38:13] Death there was one taken from famine
[01:38:17] which means it was three points is what
[01:38:19] you got there and then there was also
[01:38:22] one taken from
[01:38:25] War I do
[01:38:27] believe or maybe
[01:38:30] not we
[01:38:32] had Conquest famine no just conquest and
[01:38:36] famine then we had none for those to so
[01:38:40] what it means is
[01:38:41] here what we were doing is the goal was
[01:38:43] to get to 10 points for each or 10
[01:38:47] for get 10 conquests four war three
[01:38:51] famines which would be
[01:38:54] three of the famines you'd buy three
[01:38:55] famines or somebody would buy three
[01:38:56] famines or everybody working together
[01:38:58] would buy three famines and then death
[01:39:01] to death which is just whatever's in
[01:39:03] there now you can see what's in all
[01:39:04] those breaks every one of them has
[01:39:06] everything listed out one that has the
[01:39:07] numbers listed out it's just I would
[01:39:09] made a mistake and I was supposed to put
[01:39:10] the names but the numbers came on there
[01:39:12] for what the price of everything is so
[01:39:13] you're going to get a choice of the
[01:39:14] price of stuff but right now you got the
[01:39:16] fireman Commando out of here and then
[01:39:19] also you get a choice right now of one
[01:39:22] through I think it's like 8 7 or 88
[01:39:24] right
[01:39:25] now is what you have for um the bonus
[01:39:28] pull box because we did not get to the
[01:39:33] number that we were trying to so we did
[01:39:35] not get three of these all right we only
[01:39:36] got each one's three points here so we
[01:39:39] only got one of them all
[01:39:43] right so we needed to get up to nine
[01:39:45] points here I had it set nine before but
[01:39:48] somebody said we're talking about
[01:39:49] putting it down making it easier so it
[01:39:51] was supposed to be nine points 3 * 3
[01:39:53] would get nine
[01:39:55] points and you would have won me you
[01:39:57] would gotten three of them but you only
[01:39:59] got one so we do it that way so you get
[01:40:03] seven out of here one two three four
[01:40:07] five six and
[01:40:09] seven so you get the number seven out of
[01:40:11] there as our as our bonus pull box to
[01:40:13] see what you got you got a mud flat

[01:43:31] was a pretty good uh pretty good pack
[01:43:33] there so the game is we have I'll have
[01:43:36] some animations done on Friday if people
[01:43:38] seem to like the game but so far people

[01:43:45] animations and some things like that
[01:43:47] going but it's like a little derby that
[01:43:48] we have going on what goes on is um each
[01:43:53] one of the breaks is associated with a
[01:43:56] pack this here one of these things here
[01:43:58] so for instance Conquest is associated
[01:44:00] with the Spy Masters Vault death is
[01:44:02] associated with dustborne play booster
[01:44:05] famine associated with the arena of
[01:44:06] glory and flare of cultivation is
[01:44:09] associated with the um War all right and
[01:44:13] for instance we're going to need 10
[01:44:14] points here you know what let's do this
[01:44:17] this way again we're going to need 10
[01:44:18] points no we're going to need eight
[01:44:22] points we're going to need nine points
[01:44:25] and we're also going to need 10 points

[01:44:32] um if the
[01:44:34] horse one of which one of the horses
[01:44:37] happens to hit one of them
[01:44:41] right when our race here that is what's
[01:44:44] giv away as the buyers give away now if
[01:44:46] for instance they like for famine you
[01:44:49] only did three here but if we had had
[01:44:51] three instead of uh three points you did
[01:44:54] somebody had else had bought in and two
[01:44:56] other people bought in so that famine
[01:44:59] was a
[01:45:01] um I have to change the amount there so
[01:45:04] famine was um dropped down and you there
[01:45:07] were three of them pulled well then it
[01:45:08] would have been nine and you would have
[01:45:10] ended up giving we would have end up

[01:52:29] starve or maybe you want something else
[01:52:32] in the bloom Barrow realm or maybe you
[01:52:35] want an ion a MERS maybe you want a
[01:52:38] aoria a
[01:52:41] Dungeons Conquest going to come over
[01:52:45] Conquest going to come in this I think
[01:52:47] is a Friday game but we're testing it
[01:52:48] out here today little game here there a
[01:52:52] singles and here we go going to try it
[01:52:55] out for these are you going to come in
[01:52:57] with a collector booster going to come
[01:53:00] in with a bundle maybe I don't know or
[01:53:04] is famine going to starve you out with
[01:53:06] some play
[01:53:08] boosters and some sets set boosters no
[01:53:13] what will famine do or are you going to
[01:53:16] war with your
[01:53:17] neighbors try to take over their watch
[01:53:20] everybody destroy as bombs and guns
[01:53:23] going off have to get like I said the
[01:53:25] animations going I think we'll make it a
[01:53:26] little fun more fun but we'll do this
[01:53:33] here let's see if anybody wants to go
[01:53:36] we'll continue
[01:53:38] on with our things and see if anybody
[01:53:41] wants a collector
[01:53:43] booster or a
[01:53:45] bundle drop a big bomb or maybe you want
[01:53:49] some play boosters
[01:53:53] we don't
[01:53:56] know we don't
[01:53:57] [Music]
[01:53:59] know or it is maybe some draft some
[01:54:03] draft type stuff and you think war will
[01:54:06] be the
[01:54:07] winner or will be
[01:54:09] Conquest with the singles as the
[01:54:13] winner and I think it's going to be no
[01:54:17] one or will our last thing come in with
[01:54:21] a bundle no it did
[01:54:25] not all right well we try that that did
[01:54:29] not happen for that round so what we'll
[01:54:32] do I need to take a
[01:54:39] drink what do you guys think you think
[01:54:42] it worked out well did you kind of like
[01:54:45] it for uh hey how's it going
[01:54:47] ran hope you're having a good one I mean
[01:54:51] I know we got three people that said
[01:54:52] they liked it let me see if I can put on
[01:54:55] the YouTube's here let me go to the
[01:54:57] YouTube land to see if I can add that in
[01:54:59] there too no I don't want that
[01:55:01] one seems
[01:55:03] complicated all right how do I um how do
[01:55:06] I minimi oh no I don't want to do that I
[01:55:09] just Clos the whole window
[01:55:25] there you
[01:55:27] go seems
[01:55:31] complicated ah you're lost in the sauce
[01:55:34] not too bad all right
[01:55:36] so no that's probably I appreciate it so
[01:55:39] maybe instead of the point system maybe
[01:55:42] I set it up where it is the amount of um
[01:55:45] maybe like the like the the brakes how
[01:55:49] about I do this where the break is like
[01:55:52] even out based on so for instance we'll
[01:55:55] have 75 singles I'll
[01:55:59] have uh I'll have like 75 singles I'll
[01:56:02] have for the death they'll only be like
[01:56:05] 20 for famine there'd be like
[01:56:09] 50 I mean for the death there it only be
[01:56:11] like 10 for famine there they only be
[01:56:13] like 20 and for war there'd be like you
[01:56:16] know like
[01:56:18] um 30 or something like that 30 or 40
[01:56:21] that way the levels show every every
[01:56:24] line that goes over is actually how far
[01:56:26] along the horses would that make more
[01:56:28] sense instead of the
[01:56:31] points so when you're looking at the
[01:56:32] break each break will be a new round
[01:56:35] kind of thing it's like so I'll have to
[01:56:37] make four new breaks every single race
[01:56:39] in a
[01:56:42] way I wonder if that will work and then
[01:56:45] they'll have H1 each line will
[01:56:47] associate with the um in the break will
[01:56:51] be asso with literally how far along you
[01:56:53] are as the horse for that break do that
[01:56:57] make
[01:57:02] sense I don't know if that makes
[01:57:08] sense so guys do you guys see a bar when
[01:57:11] so for instance I put it that if I pin
[01:57:13] this break do you guys see a bar of like
[01:57:15] of the of how much it was going across
[01:57:17] right how far along it is
[01:57:26] when uh you like on the break area do
[01:57:28] you see how far along it is yeah we do
[01:57:31] all right so what I'm thinking here is
[01:57:33] that I'll make it so that there's only
[01:57:35] 10 so for instance we're going to 10
[01:57:37] points there would be only 10 singles if
[01:57:40] we're going
[01:57:41] to um eight points for war there would
[01:57:46] only be four packs in there if we're
[01:57:49] going to famine there would only be
[01:57:52] three packs in there same thing with
[01:57:53] death there it only be two packs in
[01:57:54] there that way each single time it would
[01:57:58] be you're getting to the part if if
[01:58:01] it'll L be even to how far along that
[01:58:04] line is per how far along the horse is
[01:58:06] in the race does that make
[01:58:09] sense at all I don't know if that's
[01:58:11] confusing even
[01:58:19] more I don't know if that's more
[01:58:21] confusing
[01:58:27] trying to figure out how to do it make
[01:58:28] it
[01:58:29] easy visually easy for people because
[01:58:32] you said it was a little confusing there
[01:58:34] so I'm trying to make it figure out how
[01:58:35] to make it a little easier for
[01:58:40] you what do you guys think anybody else
[01:58:43] um out there in the YouTube
[01:58:48] land how long do I have the Random
[01:58:50] Customer what do you mean
[01:58:55] not sure I'm
[01:58:59] falling how long do you have the Random
[01:59:01] Customer
[01:59:05] though oh it's five minutes is the the
[01:59:10] um it's five minutes as the long as the
[01:59:13] break
[01:59:13] goes the the thing the I mean not the
[01:59:16] break it's it's five minutes as each one
[01:59:17] of the derbies is five minutes long so
[01:59:20] each break would be like a five minute
[01:59:21] break
[01:59:24] so that's what it would be
[01:59:26] yes so my my thought process is if
[01:59:29] you're seeing it's a little confusing is
[01:59:31] I would have each Derby would be
[01:59:34] literally the spots to get to getting
[01:59:38] whatever the card is here so if it fills
[01:59:40] you'd get whatever is in that spot
[01:59:41] associated with it if that break fills
[01:59:44] and whichever one fills first would get
[01:59:47] it and then fire retention
[01:59:52] well um yeah I guess with the buyer
[01:59:54] giveaway that's what it kind of is doing
[01:59:55] here you get to hang out and get you get
[01:59:57] whatever it is here with the buyer
[01:59:59] giveaway that's what we're doing um
[02:00:01] that's why I can't do it as it any other
[02:00:02] way other than that but so we'll do it
[02:00:05] as whichever one is here and anybody
[02:00:08] that every I start a new buyer giveaway
[02:00:10] each round each Derby is a new buyer
[02:00:11] giveaway so only the people that
[02:00:14] purchase during that buyer during that
[02:00:16] Derby are the ones that can be in the
[02:00:17] buyer
[02:00:18] giveaway if that
[02:00:20] so so like I'd set it up so
[02:00:24] 10 yeah so I'd set it up so each one of
[02:00:26] these would be exactly the same amount
[02:00:28] to
[02:00:30] hit filled would get you whatever's here
[02:00:34] does that make
[02:00:36] sense that way you know where your goal
[02:00:39] is if none the unfilled break it I just
[02:00:43] I just stop it and we go when we start a
[02:00:45] new one you always get what you get out
[02:00:46] of it because if you look at the brakes
[02:00:48] all the spots in there they're actually
[02:00:50] just either packs or legitimate single
[02:00:53] that's
[02:00:58] listed like an actual single that's
[02:01:00] listed in there or they packs of some
[02:01:02] kind that are all listed in
[02:01:07] there well we got a 50/50 don't like not
[02:01:10] many people liking it or is it that I'm
[02:01:12] not doing anything right now trying to
[02:01:14] figure out what would be the easier way
[02:01:16] yeah so like if you look at each one of
[02:01:18] the brakes you can see every single
[02:01:20] thing that's in the break
[02:01:24] so that would be every single thing that
[02:01:25] would be available for those spots it's
[02:01:27] like kind of like a I guess it's more of
[02:01:28] a uh a randomized pull box in a way and
[02:01:32] what we would do is I would just
[02:01:33] literally be going through each one of
[02:01:34] them with 5c time frames to see uh which
[02:01:38] ones
[02:01:41] are um
[02:01:44] sold quickest or sold out
[02:01:47] first and whichever one sold out first
[02:01:50] would be the winner for the
[02:01:53] race of
[02:01:55] um of that Derby race of that Derby time
[02:01:57] frame and that would be the pack that
[02:01:59] would be or that would be the single
[02:02:00] that would be given away at the end if
[02:02:02] one of them happens to win or if not we
[02:02:03] do the uh the buyers give the bonus pull
[02:02:06] box because we just don't hit the goal
[02:02:08] if we don't hit the goal we're not going
[02:02:09] to give away the stuff that's give away
[02:02:11] something for no
[02:02:13] reason so that's what it is there I
[02:02:15] don't know seems like it's a
[02:02:17] 50/50 the people that don't like it I'd
[02:02:19] like to understand why that would make a
[02:02:21] I would would very much appreciate that
[02:02:24] it's very hard to know why and how to
[02:02:26] fix things if people don't like it or
[02:02:27] just don't like stuff because I'm not
[02:02:29] giving you things are
[02:02:30] free hey Troy how's it going my
[02:02:38] friend but anyways that's what we got
[02:02:40] going on right
[02:02:44] now that was our little game we had good
[02:02:47] morning good morning
[02:02:48] BFG so yeah let me know what you think
[02:02:50] we'll try it again here
[02:02:53] all
[02:02:54] right you have it set up with points
[02:02:57] right now so I think maybe that's a
[02:02:59] confusing part of it is we don't
[02:03:01] necessarily want points set
[02:03:10] up um I tagged you and a few other
[02:03:13] people but I kept getting glitches all
[02:03:15] over that day and I know somebody said
[02:03:17] that didn't even get tagged when they
[02:03:18] when I was doing one of them when they
[02:03:20] were in it so I I don't know if there
[02:03:22] was a if it hit everybody correctly but
[02:03:24] I did definitely tag you the other day
[02:03:27] when I did the second one because I know
[02:03:29] you had gotten the giveaway and you said
[02:03:31] you wanted to jump in on the next one I
[02:03:33] it just what not it's been a little
[02:03:35] weirdly glitchy every now and again like
[02:03:37] with chat sometimes my chat even like
[02:03:39] disappears and stuff it's
[02:03:41] weird but
[02:03:47] anyways yeah there'll be more exactly
[02:03:49] there'll be more exactly there'll be
[02:03:51] more
[02:03:52] but yesterday we had our adventure game
[02:03:54] you guys seem to like that and then
[02:03:56] today we have this going on here our
[02:03:57] little uh thing and we'll have kind of
[02:03:59] what I'll have is I'll have some
[02:04:00] animations so something like this for
[02:04:02] instance we'll do
[02:04:05] um let's do no I don't want
[02:04:09] that I want this
[02:04:10] [Music]
[02:04:15] one so like I'll have something like
[02:04:18] this
[02:04:23] qu that going
[02:04:26] here you only want
[02:04:29] that
[02:04:35] that oh that didn't work
[02:04:40] right
[02:04:43] no we want that something like this
[02:04:46] we'll put
[02:04:47] in that sucks that you didn't even get
[02:04:50] notified I'm sorry about that but
[02:04:57] like I'm meting it gets frustrating
[02:04:59] though sometimes CU I'm like oh I do
[02:05:00] this like I was getting um I like the
[02:05:02] new break feature though because at
[02:05:03] least when I hit the start I know
[02:05:04] everybody's getting pinged and if it
[02:05:06] doesn't I can be like it's not I I did
[02:05:08] everything I
[02:05:09] could so for instance we'll have some
[02:05:11] like images like let me see if I can get
[02:05:13] an image here to show
[02:05:24] nope let's
[02:05:27] do
[02:05:29] this let's just go
[02:05:32] Um test images because today's like a
[02:05:34] testing day we're not doing too much
[02:05:36] today oh no want display capture window
[02:05:42] capture and we want that we're going to
[02:05:45] do this I'm going to shrink it up a
[02:05:46] little bit so all you need to see is the
[02:05:48] IM oh no control
[02:05:50] Z you don't need all the other stuff
[02:05:52] we'll give you just the
[02:05:56] image there you go there something like
[02:05:58] that would be like the first horse that
[02:06:01] we' have coming across the screen as one
[02:06:03] of the horsemen when we play the game
[02:06:06] you know kind of like do some
[02:06:07] entertainment stuff and then like uh
[02:06:09] maybe for the next
[02:06:10] one we'll have uh we'll get another one
[02:06:12] we'll get another horse across the
[02:06:15] screen we maybe for war let's see what
[02:06:17] war would look like let's get War
[02:06:23] and there'll be stuff like that we'll
[02:06:25] have going on why is I getting a phone
[02:06:27] call from who right
[02:06:31] now why do I keep getting numbers and no
[02:06:33] one ever leaves a
[02:06:35] voicemail I literally say leave a
[02:06:38] voicemail or I'm not
[02:06:43] answering all right so we're going to do
[02:06:45] this here
[02:07:09] that's stupid
[02:07:34] there we go that was crazy that's stupid
[02:07:37] I can't even make something because I
[02:07:38] had War written in it they won't let me
[02:07:40] do it on certain ones that's how like
[02:07:42] people are insane nowadays with how they
[02:07:45] want things to be done their way and
[02:07:46] only way I'm not even doing something
[02:07:48] bad I'm making an image of something
[02:07:50] from a literally like a
[02:07:52] something's known for for
[02:07:54] ever but because it has one word in
[02:07:57] there they won't let it
[02:08:08] happen and see if they'll do it next
[02:08:18] time there you go wow that's nuts
[02:08:25] that's nuts that they act like that
[02:08:26] things are like that like I don't do
[02:08:28] anything
[02:08:30] bad insane some days insane in the
[02:08:35] membrane so there we go so that'll be
[02:08:38] like a war that'll be our war image
[02:08:40] getting ready to run across the
[02:08:42] screen something like that what do you
[02:08:44] guys think you think the game will be
[02:08:46] fun if we have that all of these are set
[02:08:48] up so all the breakes are the exact same
[02:08:50] amount that you have to hit to get to
[02:08:51] one of these and then we go through them
[02:08:55] and if you get to it then you get
[02:08:56] whatever's there and we have some
[02:08:59] animations go across the screen it's
[02:09:01] kind of the simplified version of what
[02:09:03] I'm planning on
[02:09:16] doing what do you think I don't know
[02:09:18] we'll run that we'll run
[02:09:20] um some fun things here we'll try it one
[02:09:22] more time all
[02:09:24] right I'm going to run a give a regular
[02:09:27] giveaway which going to be one of our 10
[02:09:29] cards over here that we normally do one
[02:09:31] two three four
[02:09:34] eight nine 10 because we have our other
[02:09:37] cards in here right now we'll run
[02:09:42] those right
[02:09:44] there and we're going to run a regular
[02:09:46] one just saying thank you for you all
[02:09:47] hanging out and then maybe um we'll have
[02:09:50] a little explanation of how our game
[02:09:53] goes all right and it'll be one of these
[02:09:55] 10 right there like we always do for our
[02:09:58] giveaways there so the way the game
[02:10:01] would go here so everybody understands
[02:10:04] is the foran derby it's kind of
[02:10:06] explained a little simplified you're
[02:10:08] going to be you're you're the players
[02:10:10] and you help one of the four horsemen
[02:10:11] whether it's Conquest War famine or
[02:10:13] death win the race by purchasing items
[02:10:15] purchasing stuff in the break Heche
[02:10:17] purchasing a spot in the break there
[02:10:18] that's popped up during the 5-minute
[02:10:20] window of the um buyers uh buyer
[02:10:25] giveaway the horsemen with the most
[02:10:27] points towards their goal at the end of
[02:10:29] the countdown determines the prize of
[02:10:31] the buyer's giveaway so for instance if
[02:10:33] um death gets 10 well this is associated
[02:10:36] with death right now that would be what
[02:10:38] death gets and that would or say for
[02:10:41] instance famine would get the arena of
[02:10:44] Glory because that's what's associated
[02:10:45] with famine right now that's how it's
[02:10:47] it's listed in the on the in the sore
[02:10:49] that's how we do it there all right and
[02:10:51] then the four horsemen represent
[02:10:53] different things like singles like
[02:10:55] things Ward represents things like draft
[02:10:57] boosters famines like set boosters and
[02:11:00] play boosters higher value ones um and
[02:11:03] death is like collector boosters and
[02:11:05] bundles and things like that now you
[02:11:06] purchase things everything brings you up
[02:11:08] a point or so on so forth based on what
[02:11:10] you see there and the race all lasts
[02:11:12] five minutes as that buyers giveway so
[02:11:15] and it's a horse is really random random
[02:11:17] for the buyer is what you get it's
[02:11:18] always a random item that's pulled out
[02:11:20] one of those bundles uh one of those
[02:11:21] breaks now this now I will scale prizes
[02:11:25] based on how many people are
[02:11:27] participating so say we all of a sudden
[02:11:29] on maybe you guys really like this and I
[02:11:31] do it Friday and we for some reason have
[02:11:33] 30 people
[02:11:34] participating we'll go and have maybe
[02:11:37] these will all be packs instead of some
[02:11:38] singles
[02:11:44] here so that's kind of my idea of the uh
[02:11:48] the game there so we're going to have
[02:11:50] this is our our giveaway right now is
[02:11:52] one of these one of these is going to be
[02:11:53] 1 through 10 and then we'll participate
[02:11:56] we'll do our game here in a minute and
[02:11:58] you guys can at least right now see what
[02:12:01] is available in each one of these breaks
[02:12:03] so like the death there are bloomo
[02:12:06] collector boosters there are Commander
[02:12:07] Masters set there are play booster uh
[02:12:11] there are um blomor
[02:12:15] and
[02:12:17] um dmor um bundles there's modern
[02:12:21] Horizon 3 collector boosters in there
[02:12:25] there are Dorn collector boosters in
[02:12:27] there you go over and you look at uh
[02:12:29] like
[02:12:30] famine famine for instance pin that one
[02:12:34] and that one has things like Commander
[02:12:36] Masters draft or midnight hunt collector
[02:12:37] boosters or modern Horizon 3 play
[02:12:40] boosters or maybe a modern Horizon 2 set
[02:12:43] booster you know things like that in
[02:12:46] there and then in our war you can see
[02:12:50] that one war has they were supposed to
[02:12:52] be the names but for some reason the
[02:12:53] prices of them went on there but what
[02:12:55] that all really is is you're going to
[02:12:56] pick one of the ones that's associated
[02:12:58] with the price all right so for instance
[02:13:01] if you get
[02:13:02] six or you get eight if you get six you
[02:13:06] pick a car a pack that's associated with
[02:13:08] price of six and you get to whatever
[02:13:09] one's there $6 if you get one that's
[02:13:11] eight you get any pack that's $8 out of
[02:13:13] the list there and that's how we do that
[02:13:14] one there it was supposed to have the
[02:13:16] name of them all but because it copied
[02:13:18] in wrong I had to do with that I it's uh
[02:13:21] I'm doing it that way it makes more
[02:13:22] helps out that way without having to
[02:13:24] redo everything but that is our uh our
[02:13:28] our game I don't know our derby I guess
[02:13:31] you call it that we're doing here let me
[02:13:33] know what you guys think I thought it
[02:13:34] was kind of fun seems like it's a 50/50
[02:13:37] right now that not too many people like
[02:13:39] it but there's only a handful of them
[02:13:41] that do and oh Neo is going to go with

[02:20:57] thank you my friend I'm always a big fan
[02:20:59] of when we get to open some
[02:21:02] sorcery didn't hear about the game oh
[02:21:05] what
[02:21:07] game oh well are you saying the new one
[02:21:09] that I was
[02:21:10] doing hold on Neo 993 there you go my
[02:21:15] friend Neo
[02:21:25] oh they that's the new game
[02:21:28] yes yeah it might have been um thank you
[02:21:30] I appreciate that sometimes it doesn't
[02:21:31] um sometimes depending on when it was
[02:21:33] the videos didn't sa for me correctly so
[02:21:36] I was having some issues a little while
[02:21:37] back so um if that could be what it was
[02:21:40] I that's why I didn't get to them all
[02:21:42] right so the new game that we have it's
[02:21:44] uh kind of I don't have any animation
[02:21:46] set for it yet but I'm going to plan on
[02:21:47] doing them if you guys like them but we
[02:21:49] have it's kind of like a derby we call
[02:21:51] it all right NOP no wrong
[02:21:55] one okay it's a derby is what we're
[02:21:57] calling
[02:22:01] it
[02:22:03] okay we're calling it a derby for the
[02:22:07] reason
[02:22:08] of you have this amount of points you're
[02:22:11] going to try to get here 10 for Conquest
[02:22:14] which if you look at all the things in
[02:22:15] Conquest it's all kinds of singles in
[02:22:17] there for war you're goal is to get
[02:22:21] eight points which is four of them from
[02:22:23] here and the war is all like draft
[02:22:26] boosters and and um bundle and uh and
[02:22:29] and like Bloom BR or uh play boosters
[02:22:32] that are lower price or murders of car
[02:22:33] law things like that then famine though
[02:22:36] you need to get nine points which would
[02:22:37] be out of these ones famine has things
[02:22:39] in it that are like uh like Commander
[02:22:41] Masters draft maybe um some play
[02:22:45] boosters here uh or set boosters or
[02:22:49] maybe you're going to have a rabica or
[02:22:51] maybe you're going to have something
[02:22:52] else in there that's in there bigger uh
[02:22:55] maybe a couple collector boosters are in
[02:22:56] there and then maybe you want to go big
[02:22:58] though maybe people think big death is
[02:23:00] going to come draw a bomb you only need
[02:23:02] two of them that's why there's 10 points
[02:23:03] is only a total and each one is worth
[02:23:05] Five Points there I have to adjust the
[02:23:07] amount that's there but maybe you want
[02:23:08] to do that and you're going to go with
[02:23:09] those and you can get a collector
[02:23:10] booster or maybe a bundle now what we do
[02:23:13] is I'll have animations set up
[02:23:15] eventually my plan is to have them set
[02:23:17] up and they'd be something like this for
[02:23:19] the animations
[02:23:21] let's get to that be something like this
[02:23:24] we'll have set
[02:23:26] up like something like that will be
[02:23:29] starting for the horse for the front
[02:23:30] you'll be like as the race starts will
[02:23:33] be the starting of them will be that for
[02:23:34] war and we'll have the horses go along
[02:23:38] in the derby and it will start it for
[02:23:39] five minutes and it runs for five
[02:23:41] minutes as the entire buyers giveway now
[02:23:45] what happens is if you hit your
[02:23:47] goal so for 10 10 of the um singles were
[02:23:52] sold you'd get a spy Master's Vault
[02:23:53] would be given away as the buyers give
[02:23:55] away if for death two of the death
[02:23:59] things were sold which would have been
[02:24:00] two collector boosters or two collector
[02:24:02] booster b or two bundles or whatever
[02:24:04] happens to be pulled the uh dor play
[02:24:06] boosters is are given away if for famine
[02:24:09] you happen to have the um nine points or
[02:24:12] the three of them that are taken then
[02:24:14] that will be there then for war if
[02:24:16] there's the eight that are done war is
[02:24:19] associated with that sing so whichever
[02:24:21] horse hits its Point goal first is the
[02:24:24] one that
[02:24:26] wins all right that's how we do it we
[02:24:28] haven't had any head Point goal yet now
[02:24:30] one of the things that we were talking
[02:24:31] about is adjusting the um the break so
[02:24:34] instead of it being for the whole stream
[02:24:36] I'll do each break for each individual
[02:24:38] race and have it like sized correctly so
[02:24:41] there would be say to instead of having
[02:24:45] it have 75 in each one of them starting
[02:24:50] out I would have it start out each R
[02:24:52] each single Derby will have its exact
[02:24:54] amount to get to the
[02:24:56] end uh to fill up the break will have
[02:24:58] you hit whatever is here so each single
[02:25:00] one of them so so for instance I'd start
[02:25:03] a new Derby in Conquest starting at 10
[02:25:06] would only have 10 spots available in it
[02:25:09] then say for death it would only have
[02:25:11] two spots in it for uh famine there
[02:25:13] would only be three spots for war there
[02:25:17] would be four spots and as soon as which
[02:25:19] whichever one fills first is the one
[02:25:22] that's going to have watch everything
[02:25:23] going way there that's what I was
[02:25:24] thinking of doing it later instead
[02:25:25] making it a little bit easier for you
[02:25:27] guys kind of a little more
[02:25:28] straightforward that way you can see the
[02:25:29] line going across based on the break
[02:25:33] instead of me adding points to it at the
[02:25:35] end
[02:25:37] here thank you Hunter I appreciate it
[02:25:39] Hunter I uh yeah you know when you when
[02:25:41] you've um worked for a while and you
[02:25:44] move on to do different things yeah I
[02:25:46] appreciate it but I appreciate you
[02:25:49] viewing and coming and hanging out
[02:25:50] but that's kind of how we do our our
[02:25:52] game there it's a little confusing right
[02:25:55] now been trying to figure out how an
[02:25:56] easy way to explain it so like pretty
[02:25:58] much the objective is the players are
[02:26:00] going to help one of the four horsemen
[02:26:01] win a race by purchasing any of the
[02:26:03] things from the B from the break during
[02:26:06] the five-minute window of the buyer's
[02:26:07] giveaway and The Horseman that ends up
[02:26:09] with the most points at the end of the
[02:26:10] countdown determines which if it hits
[02:26:12] the buyer's prize as the buyer giveaway
[02:26:15] here whichever buyer's giveaway hits um
[02:26:18] is determined by that if it doesn't hit
[02:26:19] the buyer giveaway
[02:26:20] we end up doing
[02:26:22] a pull from
[02:26:26] our bonus pull box which is a a one in
[02:26:30] 10 chance of getting a pack of some kind
[02:26:33] it's either a bundle or there's a one in
[02:26:36] 100 chance of getting a collector
[02:26:37] booster well now it's like 80 chance one
[02:26:39] an80 chance of getting a collector
[02:26:41] booster but yeah each race lasts five
[02:26:43] five minutes so that's kind of how it
[02:26:45] goes there I don't know if you like the
[02:26:45] idea of It kind of little hard to do
[02:26:49] without the animations and everything
[02:26:52] going but this is why today's testing
[02:26:54] Tuesday and we're testing out a new
[02:27:00] idea but it seems like I have a
[02:27:02] 50/50 on if people like it or
[02:27:05] not so I don't
[02:27:10] know but for right now since we're not
[02:27:13] doing
[02:27:14] anything I'm going to um let me do this
[02:27:17] I'm going to throw out
[02:27:20] couple things here as we're getting
[02:27:22] towards the uh I don't want to hang out
[02:27:23] too long right now because I do have
[02:27:25] some other things I'd like to get done
[02:27:27] we have a good amount of people in here
[02:27:28] let's see let's see what we want to
[02:27:33] do let's see do I want to do another
[02:27:35] let's do a couple things to try to sell
[02:27:37] some
[02:27:38] packs should we do some packs of some
[02:27:48] kind no
[02:27:51] know but anyways that's our derby let me
[02:27:53] know if you like the idea of it pretty
[02:27:55] much it buys up till buyers give away we
[02:27:57] can do a little bit of race and have
[02:27:58] things
[02:28:00] go we have this though I'm going to put
[02:28:02] out right now which I've been holding on
[02:28:05] to for a little
[02:28:06] bit for those of you hanging out here
[02:28:08] you're going to get a little treat right
[02:28:13] now we're going to run this as
[02:28:18] our back on Street
[02:28:20] screen hey it's you guys have been
[02:28:22] hanging out here and listening hanging

[02:29:04] everybody that buys in does it it
[02:29:06] bounces up seven five seconds each every
[02:29:08] time so here you go for those that you
[02:29:10] want
[02:29:12] it a GL caverns of Exelon box topper
[02:29:17] we're going to remove these since we're
[02:29:18] done with our game no one really wanted
[02:29:20] to play it today too much we had a few
[02:29:22] people playing it so I don't know it's
[02:29:24] like a 50/50 on people like it or not so
[02:29:27] maybe I put some more effort into it and
[02:29:28] get some more of the animations going
[02:29:31] that way we can try it out again on

[02:30:15] nice card there for you my friend that's
[02:30:18] a nice one
[02:30:20] zero ever flowing chalice enters the
[02:30:22] battlefield with a charge counter on it
[02:30:24] for each time it was kicked add an
[02:30:27] amount of Mana for each charge counter
[02:30:28] on ever flowing chalice that is an
[02:30:30] awesome card it's a good card though so
[02:30:32] you can kick this baby a dozen times if
[02:30:34] you have enough Mana out and boom you
[02:30:36] changed the game very

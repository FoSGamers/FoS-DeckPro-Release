[00:01:19] going on
[00:01:21] today we have a little pick your own
[00:01:24] adventure now we're doing the reason why
[00:01:25] we're doing it as the break our
[00:01:27] adventure game as breaks is because it
[00:01:29] allows me to track your information
[00:01:31] based on a uh an actual like I can
[00:01:35] actually come in here and I can add a
[00:01:37] note
[00:01:38] in all right on some of the information
[00:01:42] if I need to which is very nice so like
[00:01:45] when I run it you pick it up I get to
[00:01:48] put a note into it for you about your
[00:01:50] character and what you're doing that's
[00:01:52] why we're doing it that way that's and
[00:01:54] and then we have some of the other
[00:01:55] things done that way because for those
[00:01:57] reasons specifically it allows us to
[00:01:59] have a uh um then one of them allows us
[00:02:02] to have some randomization hey good

[00:05:25] running get to going here and we'll uh
[00:05:29] get her at little Adventure started here
[00:05:30] we have our characters you can become I
[00:05:33] was trying to find my old characters
[00:05:34] because I have some of them that are
[00:05:35] messed up still here those ones there
[00:05:38] but uh that were left over as the other
[00:05:39] ones I mean the characters are still in
[00:05:41] here that we can play and do all of our
[00:05:42] stuff
[00:05:43] but that's what happened there a little
[00:05:48] bit how's it going everybody hopefully
[00:05:50] you're having a good one this
[00:05:52] morning we uh we're just hanging out
[00:05:55] we're going to do our our thing this
[00:05:57] Monday morning we have our little game
[00:05:59] that we have going on here now the nice
[00:06:01] thing is I'm going to put it in here
[00:06:02] we'll have our our break the way we're
[00:06:04] doing it with the reason why I have it
[00:06:06] set up for the brakes is helps us track
[00:06:08] everybody all right so for instance you
[00:06:11] wanted to you know pick your character
[00:06:13] here we're going to say I'll pin this
[00:06:16] say you wanted to be the
[00:06:18] technician I pinned that spot now you
[00:06:20] pick that spot up and it puts actually
[00:06:22] in there and now I have an area to put
[00:06:24] notes in and then I can export that as
[00:06:27] an Excel file and track you guys as we
[00:06:30] play and continue on so that's why I was
[00:06:33] saying you know it's a little bit of an
[00:06:35] intriguing one there I'm not going to
[00:06:37] and the reason why I'm not going to it's
[00:06:38] not not need to be filled the reason why
[00:06:40] we're having it as a break is because I
[00:06:41] want to use the start break feature to
[00:06:43] notify all of you
[00:06:46] when we're going to be ending the stream
[00:06:48] so that you can come in and get the do
[00:06:50] the buyers giveaway that's associated
[00:06:52] with however far along in the game we go
[00:06:55] that's kind of how I was uh I was doing
[00:06:57] that today hey how's it going the one
[00:07:00] the a
[00:07:02] ring how you doing my
[00:07:05] friend so yes that was the uh that was
[00:07:07] the plan
[00:07:09] there and that's why we're going to pin
[00:07:12] that so you can pick out whatever your
[00:07:13] character
[00:07:14] is hey hey hey how's it going and uh
[00:07:17] that's what that's what kind of what we
[00:07:18] were doing this morning I don't know if
[00:07:20] you guys uh like the idea of that or not
[00:07:23] but yeah that's kind of what we were up
[00:07:24] to thought it would be a good one a fun
[00:07:25] one now the nice thing is with these for
[00:07:28] instance it's any oh I forgot to show
[00:07:30] you I forgot to put out the screen ah I
[00:07:33] knew I was missing
[00:07:40] something go I knew I was missing
[00:07:44] something
[00:07:46] here one second I forgot this screenshot
[00:07:49] to put in
[00:07:50] uh with
[00:07:53] everything that we had all what our
[00:07:56] items were I'm wondering why nothing's
[00:07:58] on screen I'm like where is the thing on
[00:07:59] screen oh that's why I didn't put it
[00:08:02] there all right here we
[00:08:05] go that should be
[00:08:09] there looks
[00:08:11] good move that over there now that we'll
[00:08:14] be able to see this hey well that'll
[00:08:16] work better now let's add that in there
[00:08:20] no wonder why this is
[00:08:25] um this is what we got right now for
[00:08:27] packs
[00:08:30] no wonder why thing I'm like sting like
[00:08:32] I feel like I'm missing something I'm
[00:08:33] looking at the screen I am I am missing
[00:08:37] something missing
[00:08:41] this that there gives you all the
[00:08:43] pricing of everything so that you know
[00:08:44] what it
[00:08:45] is like if we were going to sell
[00:08:47] something that had associated with the
[00:08:48] game that's why I was saying you can
[00:08:50] pick it out $8 and whatever is because
[00:08:51] you're already pricing everything there
[00:08:53] so you can know what all the prices of
[00:08:54] everything
[00:08:56] are no no no yeah yeah the pull of yeah
[00:08:59] the pool of um the buyer the buyer gets
[00:09:02] better
[00:09:06] correct yes it's not exactly a plane
[00:09:08] break so the I found it it's the nice
[00:09:10] thing about this is I can randomize some
[00:09:12] things so like
[00:09:14] say you don't want to go you don't have
[00:09:16] time you don't want to go P Potter the
[00:09:17] main Adventure or you don't think you're
[00:09:19] strong enough yet to beat the creatures
[00:09:22] there in the main part of the adventure
[00:09:23] and you want to do some side quest once
[00:09:25] you've bought your creature well what I
[00:09:27] do is you have the side quest here I'll
[00:09:29] run one of these ones here randomly once
[00:09:32] you have creatures and characters and
[00:09:34] we'll run one and it will pick a random
[00:09:36] side quest out of the 100 that I've
[00:09:37] built for you guys to have fun with and
[00:09:40] that's kind of how it
[00:09:42] goes
[00:09:47] yeah and or or for instance you do the
[00:09:51] main part of the game so you want to do
[00:09:53] the main part of the game somebody's
[00:09:54] like you know what I think I'm strong
[00:09:55] enough we can we can take on that main
[00:09:57] part of the game there we'll have that
[00:10:00] there and in the main part of the game
[00:10:02] we'll run that when we people are ready
[00:10:04] they say we're ready or maybe like you
[00:10:06] know what you've been playing the game
[00:10:07] for a little you go I I need a break for
[00:10:09] a B I need to go find some something you
[00:10:11] go I need to get some safe
[00:10:13] havens and that'll be some of the safe
[00:10:15] havens that we can go to and you know
[00:10:16] depending on where we are I'll put it up
[00:10:18] there for you guys to go to that
[00:10:21] location and then the nice thing about
[00:10:23] it is every time somebody purchases
[00:10:25] something there I get to track what is
[00:10:27] done because there's an Excel sheet I
[00:10:28] get to put not notes in and an Excel
[00:10:30] sheet comes out after I get to export it
[00:10:33] with everything everybody's done and
[00:10:34] then I get to put that into my own stuff
[00:10:37] and track everybody so that I have you
[00:10:40] and follow you along through the uh
[00:10:42] through the season do the playing so
[00:10:44] like you come back on Monday next week
[00:10:47] and you're like hey I want to pick up
[00:10:48] where I go we go on next we pick up
[00:10:50] where we left off next one so it goes
[00:10:52] across streams exactly that's why I was
[00:10:54] doing it with the brakes because it
[00:10:55] allows me to track everybody so we can
[00:10:57] continue to go across streams yeah
[00:11:04] yes this is going across streams all
[00:11:07] right our gu our buyer give our giveaway
[00:11:09] went to RJ good a shards
[00:11:12] Mage all right not a giant hit
[00:11:16] there all right yeah see you get to play
[00:11:18] a little bit across streams that way
[00:11:20] when you're building your character you
[00:11:21] get to keep your character it's not like
[00:11:23] you you get to pass a character off
[00:11:24] every time if somebody wants to play
[00:11:26] they Pi pick a character and then they
[00:11:28] pick what they want to do while they're
[00:11:30] playing or you can play together with a
[00:11:33] group of you guys going on a little
[00:11:35] maybe you go on um you know you're like
[00:11:37] all right I can't take this uh I can't
[00:11:38] take on this uh main
[00:11:42] Adventure by myself here all right so

[00:12:21] cool idea we had played the adventure
[00:12:23] game before people have liked it so yeah

[00:12:43] this all right I need to do this
[00:13:04] okay I
[00:13:18] need
[00:13:21] righty because the intelligent engineer
[00:13:24] is an old an old one I haven't been able
[00:13:25] to find the um art for it yet so I'm
[00:13:28] going to have have to go and make it
[00:13:38] again and then make it again so we'll
[00:13:41] make it again that's
[00:13:42] okay then we'll
[00:13:48] uh try
[00:13:56] that we're going to do
[00:14:00] that see what happens all right but say
[00:14:04] we got we'll throw it out here we'll do

[00:14:21] as this character we're going to run
[00:14:23] here going to run it for like 30 seconds
[00:14:26] that way you guys have some questions
[00:14:27] you can you can ask as we go
[00:14:30] all right that's what we're doing and if
[00:14:32] you need to see this a little bit bigger
[00:14:35] I can make it a little bit bigger but I
[00:14:36] don't know if you're going to be able
[00:14:37] see everything but I try to do a good
[00:14:38] job there I don't maybe I should do it
[00:14:39] the other direction but I tried to make
[00:14:41] it so you can see all the pricing of
[00:14:43] everything maybe I made it the wrong way
[00:14:47] though thank you to head over to
[00:14:54] work this makes sense can um you one
[00:14:59] somebody me a te or something please
[00:15:01] that's
[00:15:04] empty thank you
[00:15:08] thank anyways that's what that's how we
[00:15:11] go in there that's what we're doing
[00:15:12] today having some fun playing some games
[00:15:15] if you would like to and I will get back
[00:15:17] to my uh image creation since uh it
[00:15:20] looks like that's what I'll be doing
[00:15:21] today just generating these and get them
[00:15:23] going with
[00:15:27] you see if we like
[00:15:31] I know let me know let me know what your
[00:15:32] thought
[00:15:53] is all
[00:15:57] righty so we got that there we tried
[00:16:00] that ran that one oh look at that we got
[00:16:02] a side thumb oh thank
[00:16:05] you I appreciate
[00:16:08] that that's we have all all our packs
[00:16:10] are available too at the top there I
[00:16:11] don't know if you can see that all right
[00:16:12] is that hard to see I don't know I don't
[00:16:15] know if it is
[00:16:19] but one of those days we're going to try
[00:16:21] it again just have some fun trying to
[00:16:23] get these ready here and you guys
[00:16:26] can little small all right all right so
[00:16:30] maybe I have to adjust
[00:16:32] it and do this
[00:16:49] instead do
[00:16:51] this
[00:16:54] instead maybe go down the side that way
[00:16:57] I can make it a little bigger
[00:17:02] just going to and make an adjustment
[00:17:03] here so you guys can see
[00:17:12] everything
[00:17:26] here and
[00:17:29] that
[00:17:30] will probably do it here in a
[00:17:49] second almost done here getting him over
[00:17:54] it was a little hard to see so I'm
[00:17:55] making an
[00:17:57] adjustment to how it is is uh being
[00:17:59] shown
[00:18:03] here so that you guys can see it
[00:18:24] easier nope no no no there
[00:18:32] not
[00:18:38] that there all
[00:18:42] righty we ready to copy
[00:18:46] that and we're going to do this
[00:19:12] ble
[00:19:14] ble
[00:19:16] there all right try that and make it
[00:19:18] look a little bit better
[00:19:20] here that way you guys can see it easier
[00:19:23] you said it was hard to see a little
[00:19:24] easier to see
[00:19:30] okay we're going to
[00:19:36] do
[00:19:40] that and do
[00:19:42] it where we
[00:19:53] have
[00:19:56] that then we going to do this thing
[00:19:58] again oh no that's not what I meant to
[00:20:00] do undo that
[00:20:08] one what's the color for that why isn't
[00:20:11] that doing it
[00:20:21] right okay so I think that'll
[00:20:24] work so you can see that better
[00:20:37] [Music]
[00:20:39] okay let's try getting that shot again
[00:20:42] try that again
[00:20:44] instead adjusted the way the layout of
[00:20:47] it so it goes more up and down still
[00:20:49] goes across but not as
[00:20:54] much all right let's see if that'll work
[00:20:56] instead

[00:30:23] play the game unless somebody wants to
[00:30:24] jump in at some point and do it you know

[00:30:55] adventure if you want that is
[00:30:59] and I have no one hanging out here so

[00:31:34] that well put that over
[00:31:39] here what we have up here in the

[00:31:52] you normally pick your character and
[00:31:53] they get
[00:31:55] six um
[00:31:58] they get
[00:32:00] six
[00:32:02] starting like uh six starting skill

[00:38:50] today it's a slow day it's one of those
[00:38:53] times of year where it happens that's
[00:38:54] why we're doing a little change on our
[00:38:55] stuff trying to do more
[00:38:59] Adventure stuff where we get to play for
[00:39:01] do something for a little while while we

[00:39:14] that's in
[00:39:22] there okay oh what's this one
[00:39:28] let's try this
[00:39:40] one all righty maybe you want a
[00:39:48] tari there you go average is 10 Market
[00:39:52] is six 10 change oh B baloney start that
[00:40:02] there you
[00:40:03] go remember we have our other thing we
[00:40:06] trying to play here if you guys want to
[00:40:08] maybe you want to be a little Adventurer
[00:40:10] playing a game a strong human walking
[00:40:13] around I don't know it's up to you if
[00:40:16] you want to participate and have some
[00:40:17] fun with us today doing a little
[00:40:18] Adventure or anything at all I put that
[00:40:21] back with our T and I'll put that in
[00:40:23] space correct right later because that
[00:40:25] is in the wrong spot no that won't be
[00:40:28] going out there that won't go out
[00:40:40] there I don't know if I want to put this
[00:40:42] one out I think I kep this one for
[00:40:53] myself yeah I was thinking of keeping
[00:40:55] this for myself
[00:41:01] you know what I don't need colorless
[00:41:02] though I don't really do much for
[00:41:04] lrai so I'm going to throw this out
[00:41:06] there but I'm going to throw it out
[00:41:07] there in the middle of the market in the
[00:41:09] average I'm yeah I'm going to throw it
[00:41:10] at the at the market
[00:41:13] $4 there you go if you want that b
[00:41:17] salt zoom in a little bit more
[00:41:20] maybe get to see some of the cards
[00:41:24] there there you go
[00:41:27] remember if you want to play the
[00:41:28] adventure game we have that going here
[00:41:29] it's up to you
[00:41:32] guys all right we're going to move that
[00:41:34] one too because that one changed in
[00:41:39] price use our top loaders because we
[00:41:41] don't want to have to use them on the
[00:41:43] unnecessary let's see what do we have
[00:41:45] next we have
[00:41:49] this I don't think this is worth
[00:41:51] anything because I believe it's a like a
[00:41:52] very cheap card for this but I like to
[00:41:54] see what they are
[00:41:58] might to see what they are yeah that's
[00:41:59] why I figure but salt well I remember
[00:42:02] this used to be a big hit but it wasn't
[00:42:12] anymore but it is not bad for a little
[00:42:15] foil if you need a
[00:42:18] bashim put that back a little bit so you
[00:42:20] can see it
[00:42:21] better there you go

[00:56:00] right now though being that you start
[00:56:01] you only get one strength one for each

[01:03:43] playing a little Adventure game here so
[01:03:45] you start out with that my friend which
[01:03:48] is also a nice thing because whenever
[01:03:50] you need to uh get in and purchase
[01:03:52] anything somewhere you have a little
[01:03:54] extra to start so we're put those off
[01:03:56] the side we don't really need those in
[01:03:57] view but no you come out in front of you
[01:04:03] you see three small
[01:04:04] bugs now they start coming towards you
[01:04:07] what are you going to do my
[01:04:09] friend this large
[01:04:12] human what are you going to do this
[01:04:14] large
[01:04:15] Human coming out of your thing going
[01:04:18] towards going towards the Outpost which
[01:04:21] you see down there that's the next spot
[01:04:22] if you want to participate and you want
[01:04:23] to go there you can go to The Outpost
[01:04:25] Outpost there safe haven after our
[01:04:28] little thing here what are you going to
[01:04:29] do though you had the chance of
[01:04:30] attacking with your
[01:04:32] pistol which you see what it is
[01:04:35] there and I'm trying to get it set up so
[01:04:37] I can get a rolling set up some way
[01:04:39] automatically but I haven't figured that
[01:04:40] out yet so we pretty much we roll see
[01:04:42] how gets a higher but you get an added
[01:04:44] to your defense every
[01:04:46] time little cheap easier way of doing
[01:04:48] this so what do you want to do you have
[01:04:50] a choice of attacking running away I
[01:04:53] need a dice tower you know what that's
[01:04:56] actually not a bad idea that way I can
[01:04:58] just drop it down the tipe pistol whip
[01:05:00] him oh all right not a bad idea all
[01:05:01] right you try instead of hit shooting on
[01:05:03] all right
[01:05:04] 14 is
[01:05:06] uh your attack and five is their defense
[01:05:10] all right well look at that
[01:05:12] one you hit it easy but let's see you
[01:05:16] get your
[01:05:17] pistol all right because you my friend
[01:05:21] have a pistol you have hold on a second
[01:05:24] let me get over here
[01:05:28] you have this let's see what you do for
[01:05:32] damage because these aren't very strong
[01:05:35] creatures here oh my look at six you
[01:05:37] take one of those out there now there's
[01:05:39] a second one coming towards you this
[01:05:41] third one runs away second one gets
[01:05:42] angry starts coming toward you what are
[01:05:44] you GNA
[01:05:45] do my
[01:05:48] friend this strong human
[01:05:51] there I know I need a dice tower that
[01:05:53] would be intriguing I wonder if somebody
[01:05:54] can 3D print me one
[01:05:57] kick the second one all right we're
[01:05:58] going to try kicking the second one 14
[01:06:01] oh that 14 again and they got 13 oh wow
[01:06:03] you got it that time that's an easy one
[01:06:04] you beat them that was close but the
[01:06:06] kicking is done with our uh one out of
[01:06:11] four oh you got one you kick him that
[01:06:15] little bug goes flying away but he gets
[01:06:17] even angrier because he only has three
[01:06:19] strength he doesn't have a lot of
[01:06:20] strength there what are you going to do
[01:06:21] next you want to try to hit him again or
[01:06:23] do you want last chance here before you
[01:06:24] go on
[01:06:34] what do you want to do my friend you
[01:06:36] gonna kick him again you gonna shoot him
[01:06:39] he's coming toward you he thinks he's
[01:06:40] got the win this time he's mad you
[01:06:42] kicked him GNA kick him again all righty
[01:06:46] you go after him one more time he
[01:06:48] pinches at you though but this time he
[01:06:50] pinches you while you kick him knocking
[01:06:53] you and your health down so your health
[01:06:56] was at let's get your
[01:06:58] health your health was 60 you're now at
[01:07:03] 62 because that was your extra health so
[01:07:05] you're now at 61 because you had the
[01:07:07] plus two from your um initial thing
[01:07:09] there so you're at 61 Health but that
[01:07:12] bug is now kicked and flying away and in
[01:07:14] the process of that bug flying away
[01:07:17] there's a couple things I drop well look
[01:07:18] at that a couple pogs drop in the middle
[01:07:21] of the air because it FS falls out of
[01:07:22] them somehow you are now up to 12 of
[01:07:25] your
[01:07:27] pogs you got some stuff to spend if you
[01:07:30] get over to that location

[01:39:00] no I don't like this that one
[01:39:04] leaves runs out of the den screaming in
[01:39:07] agony but one of the mediumsized ones
[01:39:10] does not like you he goes and pinches
[01:39:12] you with four but you miss with and he
[01:39:15] hits you misses you though because you

[01:39:22] we'll get right to you Oblivion right
[01:39:24] and then we're going to do for you um my
[01:39:27] friend here all right so you dodge that
[01:39:30] one now the other medium siiz one saw
[01:39:32] you in the background is getting ready
[01:39:33] to attack the small one's not really
[01:39:35] knowing what to do because the other one
[01:39:36] ran away what are you going to do now
[01:39:38] that you have the mediumsized one that
[01:39:40] attacked you one's preparing to attack
[01:39:42] the other small one's like not really
[01:39:44] sure what to
[01:39:47] do they near normal D andd rolls yeah no
[01:39:50] I did see that I did see I just want to
[01:39:52] finish this here so we can uh get
[01:39:54] through this oh let me zoom out a little
[01:39:56] bit so we can see all of our our our
[01:39:58] things
[01:39:59] here all right so we're going to go
[01:40:01] after the middle middle mediumsized ones
[01:40:04] you get two mediumsized ones and a small
[01:40:06] one left because the other one left ran
[01:40:09] away afraid but luckily you had Extra
[01:40:12] Strength so it gives you a little extra
[01:40:14] Health there help there when you um
[01:40:16] protected
[01:40:17] yourself the medium one well right in
[01:40:19] front of you the other medium siiz one
[01:40:21] is kind of like I'd say like a couple
[01:40:22] feet towards the back of you couple feet
[01:40:25] to the back oh thank you I appreciate
[01:40:27] that Oblivion I know it sometimes
[01:40:29] doesn't either so I do appreciate you
[01:40:30] coming and saying stuff I do actually
[01:40:32] appreciate you saying
[01:40:37] that shoot the one in front all right
[01:40:39] you go after the one in front oh 20 you
[01:40:42] get a Critical Strike look at that a
[01:40:44] critical hit let's see what you can get
[01:40:46] with your critical five he's dead look
[01:40:50] at you kill that one in the front there
[01:40:51] one of them is gone boom
[01:40:54] dead that medium one in the front is
[01:40:57] dead drops to the ground that small one
[01:41:01] in the back goes H I don't like what o
[01:41:03] that's the wrong thing that small one in
[01:41:05] the back goes I don't like what just
[01:41:06] happened
[01:41:07] there uh that small one skits away and
[01:41:11] you only have that one medium one in the
[01:41:12] background and he comes charging towards
[01:41:14] you because he goes you killed my
[01:41:16] friend with
[01:41:18] 16 all right 16 and then 12 is your
[01:41:21] defense but you have four so that puts
[01:41:24] you up to 16 and you tie so when there's
[01:41:27] a
[01:41:29] tie that was the first natural 20 that
[01:41:31] was the first natural 20 there yeah that
[01:41:33] was the first one all right you're tied
[01:41:37] which means whenever there's a tie I
[01:41:39] allow you both to roll to attack and
[01:41:41] we'll see what happens so you get six
[01:41:43] but because they get six to hit you and
[01:41:47] you get four for
[01:41:49] them actually wait the pinches worn't
[01:41:51] six I'm sorry the pinches is only out of
[01:41:53] four they get two to attack you and you
[01:41:56] hit four for them so you bring them down
[01:41:59] to one and they knock you down from 58
[01:42:02] to
[01:42:03] 56 all right this is the end of the game
[01:42:06] here you have one last thing to do what
[01:42:07] are you going to do right before you
[01:42:08] finish this up are you going to attack
[01:42:10] you going to roll what are you going to
[01:42:11] do my friend

[02:33:43] small Raiders there two small Raiders
[02:33:47] what are you going to do with those two
[02:33:48] small Raiders and then you get a pull
[02:33:50] from here buddy because you hit 50 and
[02:33:53] this is where you could get there are I
[02:33:55] think eight play boosters left and one
[02:33:56] collector booster in
[02:33:59] there it's clobberin time all right you
[02:34:02] go running towards that small Raider
[02:34:05] there you take out your giant sword and
[02:34:08] you swing at
[02:34:10] them Al righty let's see what happens
[02:34:14] here my
[02:34:15] friend I need to get a tower like you
[02:34:17] were saying we have 13 you get plus your
[02:34:23] strength Extra Strength there brings you
[02:34:26] up to
[02:34:28] um all right that brings you to all
[02:34:31] right 17 and they get oh
[02:34:35] no they Dodge with 18 that doesn't
[02:34:39] generally happen I'm sorry my friend but
[02:34:43] they come and swing at you one of them
[02:34:44] goes I didn't like how he swung at me he
[02:34:46] swings at you with six only your defense
[02:34:49] gets plus you have two four you get a
[02:34:52] plus um four on your defense bring you
[02:34:55] to six so you defend yourself against
[02:34:57] the one of them the other one's getting
[02:34:59] ready to swing at you what are you going
[02:35:00] to do now you
[02:35:01] missed that other one with a sword there
[02:35:04] that small Raider is getting ready to
[02:35:07] come after you the second one in the
[02:35:08] background is getting ready to shoot you
[02:35:10] when the other one already missed you
[02:35:11] and he's getting ready he's he's
[02:35:12] reloading his gun it jammed a little bit

[02:43:15] there 16 from the back my friend let's
[02:43:19] see what happens did you have a good
[02:43:21] bonus pull box you got a dire down draft
[02:43:26] not a giant one from the bonus pull box
[02:43:29] it's always nice to get an extra card
[02:43:31] it's an option potential of getting a
[02:43:33] new pack a pack there that's why we do
[02:43:34] the bonus one nice potential of getting
[02:43:37] a pack or a collector booster when you
[02:43:39] do those that's why we like to do that
[02:43:41] say thank you for you
[02:43:42] guys I'll put this over
[02:43:45] here that didn't work out nicely that
[02:43:47] fell down
[02:43:53] say you want to be the
[02:43:54] character with this
[02:43:57] instead take over the strong human and
[02:43:59] you can do with this
[02:44:01] instead you're very welcome simply it's
[02:44:04] a it's a chance to get a uh it's like a
[02:44:06] pull box for a chance to get something
[02:44:08] extra you know it's always nice and you
[02:44:10] guarantee get something whether it's a
[02:44:12] single there like maybe it's a foil but
[02:44:14] sometimes it's a
[02:44:15] pack and I'd like to upgrade that as the
[02:44:18] more people that come and hang out the
[02:44:19] more shows and the more things that we
[02:44:20] do
[02:44:21] regularly all right no one wants to uh
[02:44:24] participate and help our buddy out here
[02:44:27] now now Asian you've got a lot you're up
[02:44:32] there you got some strength you're doing
[02:44:33] well you got some armor you got have an
[02:44:35] AR now your assault rifle just so we're
[02:44:38] aware your assault rifle
[02:44:41] is um
[02:44:50] is a d8 for the roll a d8 for the roll
[02:44:54] all
[02:44:55] right it's a d8 for the roll when you
[02:44:58] have the assault rifle and you get to
[02:45:00] get three shots off all right so the the
[02:45:05] eight can be split up between three
[02:45:07] different things as an assault rifle so
[02:45:09] say you get all eight you could say
[02:45:12] three to one one to another and one to
[02:45:14] another but you have they all have to be
[02:45:16] right near each other all right because
[02:45:18] it does three three shots kind of like a
[02:45:21] three round burst so like if they're
[02:45:22] right next to each other you can kind of
[02:45:23] go and try to get all three of them
[02:45:26] chance of that happening is not high
[02:45:27] always but you can try or you can just
[02:45:29] show three at
[02:45:31] one yeah yeah like a vat and Fallout

Make an image of the following 

A ragtag band of weather-beaten Fallout wasteland explorers, all male, treks across a desolate landscape, following a worn and creased map clutched in the leader's hand, its details obscured by tears and creases. They wear mismatched armor, ranging from light leather jackets to medium-weight metal plating, each piece bearing scars from countless battles. At the ready, they carry an arsenal of weapons, including a plasma shockwave axe, its energy core glowing with an eerie blue light, and an incendiary gatling gun, its barrels smoldering from recent use. In the distance, the ruins of a ravaged cityscape rise, a cluster of crumbling skyscrapers standing as a testament to the devastation that has claimed the world. The group pauses in quiet contemplation, their figures silhouetted against the fading sun, casting long shadows over the barren terrain.

I wasn’t able to generate the image you requested due to a **content policy restriction**. The combination of elements like "Fallout-style" and "incendiary weapons" can trigger limitations related to realistic violence or depictions of post-apocalyptic scenarios tied too closely to existing IP.

If you'd like, I can help rework the prompt into something similar that aligns with the guidelines—just let me know!

  "prompt": "A digital painting of four rugged, male post-apocalyptic explorers wandering a desolate wasteland. Each wears mismatched, weather-beaten armor: one in a cracked leather duster, one in rusted metal plates, one in tactical gear, and one in scavenged military armor. All show battle scars and dust. One carries an incendiary gatling gun with a glowing red-hot barrel; another has a plasma shockwave axe with a blue energy core. They follow a worn and creased map. In this scene, they encounter a lone, wide-eyed settler with a ragged coat and hat warning them about 'The Crater' ahead. The mood is tense. The group stands on a dry, cracked ridge while the settler gestures urgently toward a shadowy rift in the terrain beyond.",

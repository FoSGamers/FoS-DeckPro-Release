[00:00:55] here ah I forgot to put in all of our
[00:00:58] stuff though today
[00:01:00] well that's what happens when you get
[00:01:01] behind on things and other stuff takes
[00:01:04] precedent over the things that actually
[00:01:05] need to get
[00:01:06] done sometimes in the world I I forget
[00:01:09] that you can just tell people that you
[00:01:11] don't need to deal with it right now and
[00:01:12] they need to go away I need to work on
[00:01:14] that
[00:01:17] better instead of uh like oh no that's
[00:01:20] that's a problem for later like you know
[00:01:22] that doesn't need to be handled right
[00:01:23] now like we can deal with that like in a
[00:01:24] couple days even that makes any
[00:01:28] sense I forget to say that like yeah
[00:01:30] it's not necessary I get like too
[00:01:32] enthralled and dealing with something
[00:01:33] immediate need as its immediate need
[00:01:36] instead of like oh that's not really
[00:01:38] necessary right
[00:01:39] [Music]
[00:01:43] now all right let's try this out here
[00:01:45] we're going to try to get a new thing
[00:01:46] set up with you
[00:01:50] all um we'll see if it actually
[00:01:55] works now trying out this going to a new
[00:01:58] wheel idea now with the
[00:02:01] wheel well multiple options we uh I can
[00:02:04] put out different ones because I already
[00:02:05] have them kind of pre-made on the
[00:02:08] side and uh we'll try it out if we want
[00:02:12] it's like kind a little Adventure wheel
[00:02:13] here ah new wheel

[00:02:18] get to do everything for it yet this is
[00:02:20] just mainly the the wheel part of it so
[00:02:22] here we go let's see if I can get this
[00:02:25] uh opened and set up there let's see if
[00:02:30] can make this show for the shes cuz you
[00:02:32] know it's always nice you know have
[00:02:34] everything set up appropriately so you
[00:02:36] can you know get things working well and
[00:02:38] not have like a headache of anything you
[00:02:40] know it's ends up being a problem and I
[00:02:42] always forget to do those
[00:02:45] things in the
[00:02:47] mornings we're going to go
[00:02:51] with wheel we're just going to name it
[00:02:54] wheel no that's not it
[00:03:04] why did that do that
[00:03:07] no said window
[00:03:12] cap there we
[00:03:16] go come on come
[00:03:19] on let's correct
[00:03:24] [Music]
[00:03:26] that all right let's see if we can get
[00:03:28] that to work better sorry sorry about
[00:03:30] that like I said you wasn't wasn't
[00:03:32] prepared as best as I normally am so
[00:03:34] here we go put that there what we do is
[00:03:38] there a couple options there's things
[00:03:39] that will go around right now I've set
[00:03:40] it up to be uh some play boosters and
[00:03:44] some draft boosters so let me get that
[00:03:46] in there set up this way we're a to run
[00:03:49] it here create a temporary listing we're
[00:03:53] going to do this here I'm going to call
[00:03:55] it uh
[00:04:02] we send
[00:04:07] wheel then uh all right where is
[00:04:12] it where are the rules I need to get
[00:04:14] those over here
[00:04:45] I think these are the rules
[00:04:48] here
[00:04:50] ah I have
[00:04:52] it I did have them all right I had to
[00:04:54] put them in
[00:04:56] here there
[00:05:00] all right starting
[00:05:01] price that
[00:05:05] quantity do that cuz it really doesn't
[00:05:11] matter profile just
[00:05:19] packs I'm going to call this the $7 B
[00:05:23] whe game
[00:05:24] show there you
[00:05:26] go now we're going to have when I finish
[00:05:30] trying it out here we're going to do if
[00:05:31] this works and people like it what we'll
[00:05:33] do is uh so we'll pin this right now so
[00:05:36] you guys can read the uh description
[00:05:38] there now pretty much what it is you're
[00:05:40] going to spin the wheel all right going
[00:05:42] to see what you
[00:05:44] get
[00:05:45] here and then depending on what you get
[00:05:49] is either going to tell you your uh you
[00:05:51] get what it has for the thing oh oh no
[00:05:53] you got an Infinity draft and you got
[00:05:55] ambushed by the enemy look at that
[00:05:58] that's that's not good because you have
[00:05:59] to fend off in one
[00:06:02] roll a big bug and a small
[00:06:06] bug that come running at
[00:06:09] you I got to turn this on so I can get
[00:06:11] it in
[00:06:12] there my bad
[00:06:15] configure I'm going to do this
[00:06:21] Source there we
[00:06:23] go turn that off so you can see what I
[00:06:26] was talking about so that's kind of how
[00:06:29] that would go now the wheel has in them
[00:06:32] in it all the uh all kinds of different
[00:06:34] things whether it's the Wasteland
[00:06:35] related stuff if you want to play or
[00:06:36] just packs you can just get your packs
[00:06:38] if you'd like to do that but it looks
[00:06:40] like we have uh let me see where my
[00:06:42] internet thing is here to check how
[00:06:44] we're doing see if uh this works any
[00:06:56] better let's see here we are
[00:07:03] it's aligned so let's look at
[00:07:06] statistics I think it works okay right
[00:07:08] now just checking our our our
[00:07:11] connections here I think we're good at
[00:07:13] the moment but yes
[00:07:15] anyways that's kind of how that would go
[00:07:18] or depending on what you have for there
[00:07:19] for the bugs
[00:07:21] yes a well hey there you go well it's
[00:07:24] that and then there's also
[00:07:29] really hot
[00:07:40] coffee I don't know if I'm going to
[00:07:42] taste
[00:07:45] today I don't think I
[00:07:51] will yeah that
[00:07:54] burnt felt that
[00:07:57] one yeah yeah that was a lot hotter than
[00:08:00] I was
[00:08:02] expecting that did not feel
[00:08:05] good all right here we
[00:08:10] go I have to not take a drink of that
[00:08:13] right away I'm going to have to wait a
[00:08:14] second on that one the next next uh next
[00:08:18] sink of sip of coffee there oh that
[00:08:22] hurt I'm definitely not tasting today
[00:08:30] [Music]
[00:08:32] throw an ice cube in it yeah but then
[00:08:33] it's watered
[00:08:37] down can't water it down that's
[00:08:47] blasphemy what is going on there
[00:09:02] all right let's getting some of our
[00:09:03] stuff in here so that we can finish
[00:09:04] getting our uh the rest of it going but
[00:09:07] that's the wheel there we tried that out
[00:09:09] now there's that one then we also have
[00:09:11] one where we're putting singles in that
[00:09:13] is a $2 wheel it does the same kind of
[00:09:17] thing so let me do this and I will get
[00:09:21] the uh other one
[00:09:23] here and put that one in
[00:09:27] instead look at that
[00:09:31] we're on there doesn't matter

[00:11:11] uh the Le air choicing and doing that
[00:11:14] type of stuff will work on that this is

[00:14:39] uh
[00:14:41] singles in the uh wheel
[00:14:46] there all right let's see what happens
[00:14:48] now what you going to decide here is
[00:14:50] you're up against this with the plasma
[00:14:52] rifle the big bug you're going to roll
[00:14:56] we're going to see what happens you
[00:14:57] shoot with the big bug bugs you going a
[00:15:00] choice of dice we'll give you a couple
[00:15:01] of them here you going a choice of
[00:15:03] seeing which one will get you the uh
[00:15:05] your luck here and then you have to get
[00:15:08] a 16 or higher on the bug to hit them
[00:15:11] and then we roll one of the these three
[00:15:13] to see what you get for your
[00:15:14] damage this is so hot I can't drink the
[00:15:18] coffee a red and blue one all right here
[00:15:21] we go let's see if you get luck here oh
[00:15:26] no you do not that was a three
[00:15:29] well it looks like the big bug actually
[00:15:31] goes after
[00:15:32] you oh no the big bug hits you for
[00:15:39] 11 that's not
[00:15:41] good the red one I don't think was lucky
[00:15:43] for you buddy it doesn't seem like that
[00:15:45] worked out well so you still have your
[00:15:48] thing but you have to run away so you
[00:15:50] don't get eaten by that large bug there
[00:15:52] so as you turn you run you have to drop
[00:15:54] some ammo you only have now one round
[00:15:56] left of your plasma ammo so it's kind of
[00:15:59] how we do our little Adventure quick
[00:16:02] Adventure we going to remove that
[00:16:06] now and we can uh we'll keep running it
[00:16:09] again
[00:16:10] there try it out a little bit see if the
[00:16:14] uh $2 one's nice there now some of them
[00:16:16] are higher some of them are lower for
[00:16:17] the car price obviously so we'll see
[00:16:18] what happens try it out next and that
[00:16:21] one person that jumps in we'll run the
[00:16:24] wheel
[00:16:26] again that's fine
[00:16:33] we'll see sir
[00:16:40] boops the milk is
[00:16:44] weird what's weird about it tastes
[00:16:47] different it's cuz it's thin huh it's
[00:16:49] thin thin thin it's like a slower fat
[00:16:54] you're not getting like the thit cream
[00:16:56] unit
[00:16:58] I don't think that's it but never
[00:17:00] mind you want me to the
[00:17:11] yeah till today
[00:17:17] okay suroop going with it all right here
[00:17:20] we
[00:17:20] go spin the wheel let's see what happens
[00:17:24] here all right sir Boop what are you
[00:17:27] going to get for a single we have a
[00:17:29] bunch of them in
[00:17:32] there oh well look at that you've got
[00:17:35] yourself Nine Lives familiar foundations
[00:17:38] one
[00:17:38] there let me get that out for
[00:17:49] you that one
[00:17:51] is 462 right here my friend going to
[00:17:55] move that so you can see
[00:17:57] it and we're going to remove that from
[00:17:59] our stuff there you go my friend all
[00:18:08] right not bad for that one
[00:18:12] either you also got
[00:18:16] yourself aha like the
[00:18:19] kitties
[00:18:22] sir
[00:18:24] booper of snoot
[00:18:29] you also have oh I just put my hand in
[00:18:32] there there we
[00:18:36] go the gator Dow that is what you run
[00:18:38] into there which is not good because you
[00:18:41] don't have a weapon currently cbop all
[00:18:44] you have is a wrench so you have a
[00:18:46] choice the gator Dow is in front of you
[00:18:49] it's one of the bigger creatures in the
[00:18:51] Wasteland you can either turn around and
[00:18:53] run you can try to attack it with a
[00:18:55] wrench now one thing you need to know is
[00:18:57] the gator Dow has a minus two on any of
[00:19:00] your attack so if you and it's a plus
[00:19:03] you have to get 18 or higher to hit and
[00:19:05] damage so that means you actually going
[00:19:06] to have to get a 20 to damage it since
[00:19:09] you don't have any boost Buffs to make
[00:19:12] it higher so you're going to have to
[00:19:13] roll a perfect 20 to be able to damage
[00:19:15] it so you get this is one of the
[00:19:17] toughest ones in the whole
[00:19:20] game but you can turn and
[00:19:24] run if you would like
[00:19:29] where my other one
[00:19:33] go there we go that's where it
[00:19:36] went throw the wrench and run that's you
[00:19:38] know that's a good
[00:19:39] idea you throw the
[00:19:41] wrench Gator dealer gets knocked off the
[00:19:44] head starts looking at the wrench and
[00:19:46] you escape that's a good idea good
[00:19:49] distraction a good
[00:19:52] distraction all right now let me uh give
[00:19:55] me a second here
[00:20:06] do
[00:20:15] this forgot to put that in here
[00:20:51] all right there that's
[00:20:55] better ha start that now
[00:20:59] try that again there if people would
[00:21:00] like to try
[00:21:02] it no not a problem not a problem seru
[00:21:06] yeah kind of see what happens there get
[00:21:08] a little little new version of it and
[00:21:09] then we have our second our other
[00:21:11] version if you want to go with some

[00:27:20] try that again there we can throw up the
[00:27:22] uh the
[00:27:24] wheel you guys want to try it we can do
[00:27:27] one of the ones instead where we do it
[00:27:29] as the uh
[00:27:32] packs as our
[00:27:36] options maybe you want to do
[00:27:52] those all right let's do this
[00:28:00] then you can do
[00:28:02] those there you go do that
[00:28:08] there for the
[00:28:11] wheel you guys can try to go after some
[00:28:16] packs it's still running it's in there
[00:28:20] you should be able to jump in it's still
[00:28:21] there if anybody wants to go in there's
[00:28:23] only seven spots out of the eight
[00:28:25] because you got one so we're still
[00:28:27] running that I was just just running uh
[00:28:28] showing the the new thing where we got
[00:28:30] kind of new idea of some of the stuff
[00:28:32] that we were planning on trying
[00:28:34] here so like spin the wheel this one
[00:28:36] would be a draft looks like this one
[00:28:38] would get you a play booster so and then
[00:28:41] you'd be fighting a gator Dow though so
[00:28:44] that's kind of I don't know having a
[00:28:45] little fun with the wheel
[00:28:50] there but those are the things that are
[00:28:52] available in that one if you want to try
[00:28:53] it out we'll move over here and see
[00:28:57] what's going on with our
[00:29:00] restream all
[00:29:04] right and let's open up a handful of
[00:29:08] packs from our

[00:29:17] some of these that were left
[00:29:19] over that we haven't opened yet I'll put
[00:29:22] away this so we don't have that there
[00:29:24] you can see better but we'll put these
[00:29:25] and we're going to see if we get any
[00:29:26] more of our shock that we've been
[00:29:28] getting we've been kind of Lucky
[00:29:29] recently getting some shocklands so I
[00:29:32] figur we'll try it again and see if we

[00:30:44] wheel fortune eses thing where we're
[00:30:46] going to have some guessing of letters
[00:30:48] for uh the words we'll end up putting
[00:30:49] out but I wanted to check if uh how it
[00:30:51] looked like it was going right now and
[00:30:53] if you guys liked it if you did we would
[00:30:55] we continue on doing it if not we'll uh
[00:30:58] well if the wheel part of it was smart
[00:31:00] if not we'd try to change it up and
[00:31:01] maybe do something a little different so
[00:31:03] that's why we were kind of trying to see

[00:32:11] going to hang hang out and put the view
[00:32:13] on so you guys can see a little
[00:32:14] something else while we're while I'm
[00:32:16] eating here cheese on your eggs boys
[00:32:19] yeah let's see if it'll work or if we're
[00:32:20] going to have a problem
[00:32:23] today you want cheese on your eggs nope
[00:32:26] it never works right away I always have
[00:32:28] to restart the
[00:32:31] phone well we'll try restarting the
[00:32:33] phone here and see if it
[00:32:38] works always going to restart it cuz for
[00:32:40] whatever reason it doesn't seem to want
[00:32:41] to
[00:32:47] work so we'll get that restarted and
[00:32:50] we'll get you a better view then I'm
[00:32:51] going to have my breakfast over
[00:32:55] there and we'll see if we can feel that
[00:33:05] great well the wheel uh what did the
[00:33:08] wheel break uh so the wheel is just for
[00:33:10] the most part here it's uh whatever you
[00:33:13] could choose you could have the singles
[00:33:15] kind of like a where it's a $2 one where
[00:33:18] it's anywhere 5 cents to like $4 for the
[00:33:21] singles that are in there then they're
[00:33:23] all rares or they W value kind of like
[00:33:25] way we did the virtual pull boxes and
[00:33:27] then um same thing for the uh and it
[00:33:31] just has stuff written on it for for um
[00:33:33] your encounters so like whether it's an
[00:33:35] encounter or maybe you're going to get a
[00:33:37] a weapon or maybe you'll get a you know
[00:33:39] maybe there's a penalty because for your
[00:33:41] adventuring going on something like that
[00:33:43] but then other than that you will end up
[00:33:45] getting the option of the singles or we
[00:33:48] can do packs which I have like just play
[00:33:50] boosters or graph set up so that you can
[00:33:52] do that it's like $7 for that one and if
[00:33:54] you want to just do it for collector
[00:33:56] boosters I have a collector booster one
[00:33:58] set up which is similar which is has a
[00:33:59] bunch of collector boosters on there and
[00:34:01] it's I think it's like 38 or 39 I have
[00:34:03] to look at it but that's pretty much how
[00:34:05] it's pretty much like a virtual pull box
[00:34:07] is really what it is just set up in a
[00:34:08] wheel form so you can see it that's
[00:34:11] really what it is to
[00:34:14] yeah the way I did those before at
[00:34:24] least all right let's see starting how
[00:34:27] many do you have
[00:34:32] connect manners William S
[00:34:38] please there we
[00:34:52] go there see what we're looking at right
[00:34:55] now
[00:35:01] and we'll do nope not that
[00:35:05] that that's my view at the moment while
[00:35:07] we're hanging out here seeing if you
[00:35:08] guys want to uh jump on anything yeah so
[00:35:11] it's really your choice of how you want
[00:35:12] to do the wheel if you want to have if
[00:35:14] you want to jump on something there
[00:35:16] where the wheel would be a uh the same
[00:35:18] thing as a virtual pull box just set up
[00:35:20] as a
[00:35:21] wheel it is pretty nice right now it is
[00:35:23] very nice right
[00:35:25] now it was raining right away right when
[00:35:27] we started started so I didn't get to
[00:35:28] hang out but it'll be nice today to go
[00:35:29] out and do some
[00:35:42] things I got to walk to the store and
[00:35:44] find
[00:35:45] a stuff to fix the toilet cuz it's
[00:35:48] leaking it's the nice things you got to
[00:35:51] do when you on a
[00:35:56] boat really fun quite quite the shitty
[00:36:04] job yeah real feel of eight is pretty
[00:36:09] cold pun intended
[00:36:22] correct yeah that's what I got to do
[00:36:25] though
[00:36:35] [Music]
[00:36:39] pict a
[00:36:41] leak in the
[00:36:44] kidum from uh the drain not going to the

[00:40:48] see so yeah I mean we're just hanging
[00:40:51] out here waiting see if you guys want to
[00:40:52] try the adventure checking some fun
[00:40:54] stuff out opening some packs doing a
[00:40:58] little D and D stuff
[00:41:01] today or opening some packs depending on
[00:41:03] the wheel that you want to go
[00:41:06] with maybe you want to go with this
[00:41:18] wheel just listening about the dog I
[00:41:20] think it's food um I actually was antipa
[00:41:23] getting I have a today
[00:41:29] AB absolutely thank you all right that's
[00:41:33] what it was it was about dog food
[00:41:34] perfect said thank you we're good
[00:41:38] bye she goes everything's good Bon is
[00:41:41] fine but we're getting lawn food I go I
[00:41:43] already anticipated it that's all that's
[00:41:46] all we need to know we've been having to
[00:41:47] wait to get the bones cuz it takes a
[00:41:49] little while to get to them cu the just
[00:41:51] weather wasn't appropriate for us and
[00:41:53] then the dog wasn't able to fly so we
[00:41:55] have to wait like another few days it's
[00:41:57] just a pain in the butt hello children
[00:41:59] so my uh my thought process is probably
[00:42:01] going to have to um have one person fly
[00:42:05] back in the next week or two try to pick
[00:42:07] him up then come back here Puerto Rico

[00:55:27] you are an unlucky person because you
[00:55:30] end up
[00:55:33] finding one of those pirates in front of
[00:55:36] you and he is not a nice one this
[00:55:39] time you have to beat that pirate you
[00:55:43] got a dmu draft
[00:55:45] also let me get your pack
[00:55:48] out e for you my
[00:55:53] friend I think I'm going have to get up

[00:56:02] pirate there we go there's your pack
[00:56:07] there now get pirate in front of you it
[00:56:11] is an 18 but Luke you've played our game
[00:56:13] before so you have a little bit of uh a
[00:56:15] little bit of extra I do
[00:56:18] believe if I remember right no not that
[00:56:23] one no not that one let's go here then
[00:56:28] where is it I thought it was right
[00:56:33] there there we go Luke there you
[00:56:37] are you are at plus three strength and
[00:56:40] you has some weapons to choose from so
[00:56:43] you actually can potentially uh roll out
[00:56:46] here with um some good luck you got to
[00:56:48] let me know what you want to do use the
[00:56:50] sword so it's an 18 you got a sword but
[00:56:52] you get strength so that means you need
[00:56:53] to go with a 10 or more cuz you have
[00:56:57] three which dice are we using
[00:57:02] Luke wait no you have the pirate sword
[00:57:05] so it's actually nine or
[00:57:07] more purple one that's what I figured

[01:00:58] you get it aside or anybody else do you
[01:01:01] want to run the wheel
[01:01:03] again let's see if I can pick this
[01:01:08] here I wonder if I can do that hold on a
[01:01:10] second I'm going to put Source
[01:01:14] visibility go back Source visibility
[01:01:20] here there you go the wheel so you can
[01:01:22] see what it is ah so you see that wheel
[01:01:26] the wheel is there if you want to do it
[01:01:28] again you get to try and those are the
[01:01:30] packs you can get in them we'll do that
[01:01:31] another time and you get to do some
[01:01:33] adventuring
[01:01:34] too maybe you get a weapon and you have
[01:01:36] to go to it on with something that I
[01:01:38] randomly pick or maybe it's an encounter
[01:01:40] that's picked for
[01:01:43] you maybe it's an encounter that's
[01:01:45] picked for
[01:01:46] you from the from our robot the
[01:01:51] wheel now we'll have some better stuff
[01:01:53] here will only be the wheel we're going
[01:01:55] to do some tomorrow this ver Alpha we
[01:01:58] want to make sure some of it work
[01:01:59] tomorrow we'll have our kind of our
[01:02:00] words going along with so it's like a
[01:02:02] Wheel of Fortune type game that way we
[01:02:04] have it going on and then we'll have
[01:02:05] hopefully I'll be able to make my
[01:02:07] character that will be the uh like our
[01:02:09] Alex T type guy or our our what's his
[01:02:12] name all right here we go trying it out
[01:02:15] here we're going to spin the wheel for
[01:02:16] you my
[01:02:17] friend here we go good
[01:02:24] luck wait what see this is Alpha version
[01:02:26] I said this is an alpha version we're
[01:02:28] trying it out
[01:02:31] here well there you go you got a Murders
[01:02:34] At Carlo Manor pack and a plus 20
[01:02:38] health so
[01:02:41] murders right here for
[01:02:43] you turn that wheel off turn that off
[01:02:46] turn that off and you have a plus 20
[01:02:49] health so
[01:02:51] Mella you have a plus 20 Health but you
[01:02:54] are unlucky where you do not have a
[01:02:57] weapon to go up against anything there
[01:03:00] so you're going have to decide we're
[01:03:02] going to throw these at you this is what
[01:03:04] you going to have for your
[01:03:05] encounter you have a mediumsized bug
[01:03:09] that's going to come after you all right
[01:03:11] you have to decide with that mediumsized
[01:03:14] bug are you going to attack it with your
[01:03:17] wrench that you have that's the only
[01:03:19] thing you have right now is a weapon or
[01:03:22] are you going to run away and try to
[01:03:24] retrain all of your health and
[01:03:28] stuff yeah look forward to a little a
[01:03:30] little new
[01:03:31] stuff so but we will open up your pack
[01:03:34] here though right now as we have hang
[01:03:36] out give them five pogs oh you're going
[01:03:38] to give yeah if you win you'll end up
[01:03:40] getting pogs or maybe bug parts or
[01:03:42] something like that maybe you'll find a
[01:03:43] weapon that it scavenged I don't know
[01:03:45] you're going to attack all right I like
[01:03:47] it so being a um being a mediumsized bug
[01:03:52] it's only let's see what my thing is
[01:03:54] here I got to get my chart
[01:03:57] out for uh so I know what weapons are
[01:03:59] what the adventure
[01:04:03] stats so the medium siiz
[01:04:07] bug
[01:04:09] is
[01:04:21] a oh mediumsized bug there you goes a
[01:04:24] plus
[01:04:26] why is not in there oh well I'm going
[01:04:27] have to add that it is a plus 14 so you
[01:04:30] have to have 14 or higher on your roll
[01:04:32] to hit so you can decide which dice you
[01:04:34] want to use though right now I don't
[01:04:35] know why it's not in
[01:04:37] there so let me know I'm we're going to
[01:04:39] take it
[01:04:41] away and you only have one dice you get
[01:04:44] to roll with though because you only
[01:04:45] have the wrench there to attack with
[01:04:48] left one the left red all right the left
[01:04:50] red one I like it so here you go let's
[01:04:52] see what happens come outside mom again
[01:04:55] roll this bring your stuff
[01:04:57] oh
[01:04:59] unlucky that is
[01:05:01] eight the medium size
[01:05:10] bug yeah we should be able to do that
[01:05:12] multiple wheel spins at once I don't see
[01:05:14] why not I was thinking maybe I can put
[01:05:17] it in the buy now eventually too but
[01:05:19] this is kind of like the first version
[01:05:20] of it trying to figure it out all right
[01:05:22] so you got an eight that was unlucky so
[01:05:24] that mediumsized bug nips at your toes
[01:05:28] Mella and brings you
[01:05:31] from 100
[01:05:33] Health
[01:05:36] down
[01:05:37] to 94
[01:05:43] health I doing
[01:05:49] that why is there oh there's a there's a
[01:05:53] that's why there we go
[01:05:56] you go from to 94 out of 100 Health but
[01:05:59] you do have a health pack so that's
[01:06:01] always
[01:06:07] nice and you only have a ranch roll
[01:06:09] right
[01:06:11] now let's open your pack and see what
[01:06:13] you get what do you say I'm going have
[01:06:15] to make a one for the wrench
[01:06:22] now yeah first one trying it out exactly
[01:06:24] first thing trying it out see what we
[01:06:26] get how it works exactly good luck my
[01:06:28] friend let's get you something beautiful

[01:08:18] sword it is
[01:08:21] five no wait the knife is five the pist
[01:08:25] still is five the sword is 10 sorry I
[01:08:27] was off on that one for a second I
[01:08:28] forgot I have to write these things down
[01:08:30] so I'm like looking at I'm like that
[01:08:31] doesn't sound right feel like one of the
[01:08:33] that was a low price of them it's a five
[01:08:35] for them there you're going to get a
[01:08:37] knife or a pistol you get your choice a
[01:08:39] knife or a pistol for five pogs if you
[01:08:44] want Mel it's up to
[01:08:49] you so our friend there Luke was giving
[01:08:52] it and he said you know what we'll have
[01:08:54] to have a a w wandering Trader comes by
[01:08:56] and offers you some
[01:08:58] weapons so put those
[01:09:02] away and we'll give you uh you get your
[01:09:04] choice of a pistol or uh there you go
[01:09:08] yourself a knife or a pistol for five
[01:09:11] pogs that's what you get
[01:09:14] there I want to make that
[01:09:24] bigger there we
[01:09:31] go
[01:09:33] pistol or
[01:09:41] knife there I like that
[01:09:44] better there's your choice my
[01:09:47] friend not bad on that one that was
[01:09:50] pretty fun yeah we'll try like I said
[01:09:52] we'll try that again and then eventually
[01:09:53] like I said we'll have a we'll have a uh
[01:09:55] I'll have one of the characters up there
[01:09:57] that's like the game show host we'll do
[01:09:59] um a more of a Wheel of Fortune type one
[01:10:02] so every time the wheel spins you're
[01:10:03] going to get a guess at a letter and if
[01:10:04] you get it right you're going to get
[01:10:05] like the uh I was thinking like the big
[01:10:07] thing would be maybe you get a pirate
[01:10:08] sword maybe you get a flamethrower or an
[01:10:11] alien Gatling gun because those are like
[01:10:13] big special
[01:10:16] weapons or you guys can always do the
[01:10:19] one that was the $2 one which will get
[01:10:21] you a the same wheel but the only
[01:10:23] difference is is it's singles that we
[01:10:25] have so I don't know it's kind of a like
[01:10:27] I said new thing trying it out here see
[01:10:29] if you guys like it different I know
[01:10:31] it's
[01:10:32] different but hey try it
[01:10:46] out I don't know if we can do
[01:10:50] Plinko there got to be a way to make it
[01:10:52] that way ooh there's got to be a way to
[01:10:55] do that I'm thinking about it I think
[01:10:58] there's a way to do a Plinko if it has
[01:11:00] to do with the adventure and you're just
[01:11:02] like kind of like the person's dropping
[01:11:03] it to see what happens and it's always
[01:11:04] just going to be the same kind of thing
[01:11:05] with the
[01:11:07] packs I don't know if we could do it if
[01:11:09] it's always the same pack and you're
[01:11:11] just buying the pack and you're doing
[01:11:12] Plinko for the game ooh there we go
[01:11:15] that's what it would be I'd do a I'd do
[01:11:16] an auction for whatever the pack is or
[01:11:18] the card is and then you get to do the
[01:11:19] Plinko to see what happens with the
[01:11:21] adventure
[01:11:22] ah Wasteland version when it land land
[01:11:25] on the wrong thing it blows up on you if
[01:11:27] it lands in the on the wrong thing the
[01:11:29] shotgun shoots you lands in the right
[01:11:31] one you get a you get a bunch of pogs
[01:11:33] dropped on
[01:11:34] you there we go there we go not bad
[01:11:38] spicy we'll have to work on that one I
[01:11:40] got to get this one top fix first
[01:11:41] that'll be their next idea ah I like it
[01:11:45] we'll have a way we're going to have
[01:11:46] some game show hosts specific for these
[01:11:48] uh for these games too
[01:11:57] all righty everyone we'll run another
[01:11:59] one of the
[01:12:01] uh
[01:12:03] Wasteland ones
[01:12:06] here credit to
[01:12:09] Luke well he said I thought of Plinko
[01:12:11] before but I'm trying to figure out how
[01:12:12] to do it and now that we do the
[01:12:13] adventure stuff that works too I just
[01:12:15] don't know I didn't know how I think I
[01:12:17] can just do it just the adventure it's
[01:12:18] always one pack so I do like the idea of
[01:12:20] bringing that in there and we can have
[01:12:21] it Le I like the idea of bringing in the
[01:12:23] Wasteland version
[01:12:26] new game show host come visit us on the
[01:12:30] Wasteland wheel spin see what your
[01:12:32] damages are you going to live will the
[01:12:35] radiation get you watch out for the rad
[01:12:42] storms cuz uh that is one of the things
[01:12:44] on the Wheel by the way if you did not
[01:12:47] notice you get hit by a rad storm we're
[01:12:49] working on getting all the images and
[01:12:50] everything for these things too like I
[01:12:51] said this is version one version this is
[01:12:53] the Alpha version of the wheel so you
[01:12:55] look at the wheel maybe you're
[01:12:58] unlucky and you're one of the ones that
[01:13:00] lands on the radstorm
[01:13:02] that means you're going to get hit by
[01:13:05] something coming around let's see if I
[01:13:06] can get it to come here let's see what
[01:13:08] else we show up so we can see all of
[01:13:09] them maybe we'll get a few of them
[01:13:12] here oh we got our oh you got lucky the
[01:13:15] plasma rifle on that
[01:13:17] one let's see if we can get uh that
[01:13:20] would have gotten you guys a plasma
[01:13:21] rifle let's see what else we can get
[01:13:22] here
[01:13:27] oh look at that a hole in the wall for
[01:13:29] some uh safe
[01:13:32] havens that would have brought you uh a
[01:13:34] couple of friends here get you the hole
[01:13:36] in the wall to help you
[01:13:41] out oh look at that see all kinds of
[01:13:45] funest but there's also in there there's
[01:13:48] your
[01:13:50] Ambush there is where is it you get
[01:13:52] ambushed
[01:13:57] there is let me find them
[01:14:00] all here we go you can have your weapons
[01:14:04] break oh that's not a good one you have
[01:14:06] a radiation storm you can run into you
[01:14:08] have lose one through 30 Health there's
[01:14:11] one of those there's Ambush enemy Ambush
[01:14:13] you get lose all your ammo oh that's not
[01:14:15] a fun one you get an ammo shortage which
[01:14:18] half your ammo disappears for all of
[01:14:20] your weapons you have a lose your best
[01:14:22] weapon so that's me looking at your
[01:14:23] inventory and going that 's gone then
[01:14:26] you have weapon jam oh that's so you
[01:14:28] have the fight and you have a weapon Jam
[01:14:29] so you're going to have to take the hit
[01:14:30] on that one armor malfunction so if you
[01:14:32] have armor no oh no jackpot there you go
[01:14:36] that one will get a you'll get a reward
[01:14:38] there an ammo crate is a nice reward too
[01:14:40] and then Sol the puzzle if you can't
[01:14:41] solve it you're going to get in trouble
[01:14:43] because every time you get it wrong you
[01:14:45] get different things the first one's
[01:14:46] five hits of damage second one you lose
[01:14:49] a round of
[01:14:50] ammo all the way up to 10 wrong you're
[01:14:52] dying of radiation poison cuz you're
[01:14:54] just just really bad at spelling at that
[01:14:56] point if you get 10 in a row wrong and
[01:14:58] you deserve to die of radiation
[01:14:59] poisoning in the
[01:15:04] Wasteland oh you may hey hopefully
[01:15:06] you're okay
[01:15:08] buddy you know
[01:15:11] um yes the break does have seven left
[01:15:13] I've mentioned it a few times but Luke
[01:15:16] what I think I might do here is since we
[01:15:18] do have
[01:15:19] [Music]
[01:15:21] um no one jumped in on it just now I'll
[01:15:24] give you an option of getting a pack for
[01:15:27] this spot here and I'm just going to
[01:15:28] kind of close it out now um and you can
[01:15:31] choose a pack uh or a couple packs that
[01:15:33] would be equivalent to the the what you
[01:15:35] got there so like say you want to get
[01:15:38] a you know couple of packs here so you
[01:15:42] wanted to go with a
[01:15:44] uh modern Horizon 3 and a Wilds of All
[01:15:47] Drain or like a Wilds Val
[01:15:50] drain and Ravnica remastered draft
[01:15:55] things like that we could do that since
[01:15:56] we don't have everybody jumping in on
[01:15:59] the break
[01:15:59] today so it's your guys Choice how you'd
[01:16:02] like to do
[01:16:05] it let me get rid of this cuz this is
[01:16:07] not working right
[01:16:09] anymore I want to let it cool down
[01:16:13] too so yeah let me know yeah I hope all
[01:16:16] goes well and you're okay nothing major
[01:16:18] just like a little head headache hicup
[01:16:20] thing like everybody deals with every
[01:16:21] now and again you know flu or whatever
[01:16:24] it may be
[01:16:25] I have to send a thank you to Robert cuz
[01:16:27] I was hoping he bumped in here so I
[01:16:28] could say thank you for the dice but he

[01:19:01] going to go on a minor encounter here
[01:19:03] you decide to go
[01:19:06] back and check
[01:19:10] some treasure out in that room filled
[01:19:13] with
[01:19:14] crabs there's only three of them in
[01:19:16] there right now all right
[01:19:19] Luke so you get to pick your dice of
[01:19:21] what one you want to
[01:19:23] use I also have the box of them right
[01:19:25] here and you're going to decide right
[01:19:27] now what you're going to do you're going
[01:19:29] to get three shots all right Luke to see
[01:19:31] what happens if you're able to kill them
[01:19:32] enough of them off that you can go and
[01:19:34] get some something from the uh the the
[01:19:38] uh the what do you call there the um the
[01:19:40] chest that is
[01:19:42] protecting clear red one and we're going
[01:19:44] to go with some plasma I like it so you
[01:19:47] shoot your plasma
[01:19:49] rifle at those crabs
[01:19:55] and the plasma
[01:19:58] rifle you have extra don't you I believe
[01:20:01] you do give me one second cuz you get a
[01:20:04] you got a five there and that is not
[01:20:06] going to do it for the crabs unless you
[01:20:10] have plasma you have
[01:20:14] strength Luke my buddy the first time
[01:20:17] the crabs did not like it they get you
[01:20:19] let's see there I said there was what
[01:20:21] three of them there let's see what
[01:20:23] happens the three of them hit
[01:20:26] you
[01:20:28] for nine Luke oh no that brings you down
[01:20:33] to
[01:20:35] 82 Luke are you going to attack again
[01:20:38] with the
[01:20:39] plasma not a good day Luke I know or do
[01:20:42] you want to try a different one o not
[01:20:45] working I know we got unlucky you have
[01:20:48] to
[01:20:52] inside all right you use the sword
[01:20:56] and 12 well look at that
[01:21:00] beautiful you swing your pirate sword
[01:21:03] which I believe is what you have nice
[01:21:06] pirate sword you swing
[01:21:07] that and you go and you
[01:21:11] hit all three of them oh well look at
[01:21:13] that six for two of them which is only
[01:21:16] they're only five Health each and one of
[01:21:17] them gets hit with three so you're down
[01:21:20] to two of
[01:21:22] them there are only
[01:21:25] two crabs left in the treasure
[01:21:31] room so with that being said what are
[01:21:33] you going to do you have one roll are
[01:21:35] you going to run away or you going to
[01:21:37] try to attack that one last one the
[01:21:39] sword
[01:21:40] again oh you did it because that's a
[01:21:43] nine and you get three I'm pretty sure
[01:21:45] you're going to win here oh well look at
[01:21:47] that it doesn't matter you only needed
[01:21:49] two Health two strikes and he got them
[01:21:51] you got it well look at that wonderful
[01:21:55] and that was great

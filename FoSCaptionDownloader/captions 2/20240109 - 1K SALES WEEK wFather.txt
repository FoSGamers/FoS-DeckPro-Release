[00:00:49] I was thinking of doing uh you know what
[00:00:51] I'll have this thing run right
[00:00:56] now all
[00:00:58] righty
[00:01:00] oh uh weather related because of
[00:01:04] um I'm guessing uh weather related
[00:01:07] you're up north
[00:01:13] huh yeah what area up North if you mind
[00:01:16] I I I used to live up in New Hampshire
[00:01:17] so that's why I asked hey Captain how
[00:01:20] you doing squirrel how you doing today
[00:01:22] we're just doing our little thing in the
[00:01:23] morning here Minnesota all right that's
[00:01:26] a little different North compared to
[00:01:27] what I was but I mean I used to have to
[00:01:29] show
[00:01:31] and snow blow on a regular basis you
[00:01:33] just need to uh trudge through it in
[00:01:35] your uh in your snowshoes to get to
[00:01:37] school huh or your snowmobile that was
[00:01:39] like Maine up in Maine they used to have
[00:01:41] to do that we were a little bit further
[00:01:44] south that we didn't have to do that
[00:01:45] they could actually plow our
[00:01:47] roads the reason why I say that is
[00:01:50] because I literally know somebody that
[00:01:52] uh said they used to that when they were
[00:01:53] younger they used to ride their
[00:01:54] snowmobile to school in Maine and there
[00:01:57] was like three or four of their friends
[00:01:59] that used to do that all time during the
[00:02:00] winter and that's that's the only reason
[00:02:02] I said
[00:02:05] that all right well today I got
[00:02:07] something a little special that we got
[00:02:09] going on so um I do I'm getting pretty
[00:02:13] close to 1K sales my wife know poting it
[00:02:15] out to me and she said that if I was
[00:02:17] going to get twi's 1K sales I should

[00:16:38] yesterday for whatever reason did not
[00:16:40] come in so I do have to just make stuff
[00:16:43] deals with what I have here sadly the
[00:16:47] reason why I didn't come in though at
[00:16:48] least this time when I called FedEx they
[00:16:50] weren't like pieces of [ __ ] they
[00:16:53] actually answered me um and I found out
[00:16:58] that the reason why my package did not
[00:16:59] come in was because the uh packing label
[00:17:02] got ripped off the package somehow so
[00:17:04] they had to reprint it which is why it
[00:17:06] was late I'm like all right you know
[00:17:08] what thank you you finally gave me a
[00:17:10] goddamn answer to like what is going on
[00:17:13] rather than blowing smoke up my ass
[00:17:14] every [ __ ] time I call in you people
[00:17:16] can somebody like and afterwards it was
[00:17:19] like can you you want to leave a review

[00:17:27] specifically
[00:17:29] I go I said to these people I go you
[00:17:31] need to have whoever this person is
[00:17:33] train every single person that works in
[00:17:37] your call
[00:17:38] center on how to talk to a customer this
[00:17:42] person actually knows what to do I
[00:17:45] called with a question he answered my
[00:17:47] question and then when I asked another
[00:17:49] question he answered the other question
[00:17:52] and even though there was a problem with
[00:17:54] my shipment that I was coming in late he
[00:17:57] still answered it satis Factory because
[00:17:59] he actually told me what happened then
[00:18:01] he apologized because he knew it was a
[00:18:03] [ __ ] up and he knew it wasn't his that

[00:38:21] put him in his bag put it in his bag and
[00:38:23] we're like we don't have a problem if
[00:38:24] teacher tells you to take it off but
[00:38:25] it's not going your bag because you had
[00:38:27] stuff stolen out of your bag so if
[00:38:29] that's going to be the case have her
[00:38:30] call us and um the teacher refused to
[00:38:35] let him even speak to say that so he put
[00:38:37] it in his bag and he was all worried
[00:38:39] about it being stolen all day at school
[00:38:41] and had a very bad day at school and
[00:38:43] because of that because he's had stuff
[00:38:45] stolen out of his bag so the teacher
[00:38:46] just gave me a call this morning to talk
[00:38:48] about it to be like we weren't trying to
[00:38:49] be hard I'm like I I don't think you
[00:38:51] were trying to be hard it was the
[00:38:53] problem with not letting my child tell
[00:38:54] you to call me is so that we can talk
[00:38:57] about and say put the B somewhere that
[00:38:59] that doesn't get stolen if there's some
[00:39:00] reason for it that I'm unaware of and
[00:39:03] that's fine and she did that but it was

[00:45:24] Bob
[00:45:28] I do appreciate it my friend do appr
[00:45:31] appreciate it my
[00:45:33] friend I'm going to go and I put these
[00:45:35] ones back here and then I'm going to go
[00:45:38] and I will um pull out I think I'm going
[00:45:42] on to I
[00:45:46] um no problem I the carnival game no
[00:45:50] problem so what the carnival game is um
[00:45:52] you can see them you know I'll slide it
[00:45:54] maybe I got to turn the camera a little
[00:45:55] bit maybe white there's this box here
[00:45:57] called the mystery packs now what you do
[00:45:59] is you pick three of those out and they
[00:46:02] get lined up in front of the boxes and
[00:46:04] these boxes are
[00:46:06] called The Father's box the buyer's box
[00:46:10] and the son's box now the reason why
[00:46:11] they're called those is generally my son
[00:46:13] is here hanging out with me or one of my
[00:46:14] sons are but being in the morning
[00:46:16] they're at school and this is just what
[00:46:18] I'm doing in the middle of the in the
[00:46:19] before I start work and what happens is
[00:46:21] you pick three packs out of here to get
[00:46:23] lined up in front of the boxes and then
[00:46:26] you're going to have it's G to it's
[00:46:27] going to be something like this here
[00:46:28] you're going to get I think these are
[00:46:30] three I don't know I think these are
[00:46:31] three of them yeah so you're going to
[00:46:33] line them up they pick them out you line
[00:46:34] them up I'm G to give you opportunity to
[00:46:36] move them around if you want if you want
[00:46:37] to switch them but you flip them over
[00:46:39] and what happens oh you got a modern
[00:46:40] Horizon 2 draft oh you got a Faria all
[00:46:44] will be one set and up you got a
[00:46:46] commander Masters draft and those are
[00:46:49] the ones that happen to be there I don't
[00:46:50] have Commander Masters or modern Horizon
[00:46:53] 2 which is why they're over there right
[00:46:54] now their other all my other packs in
[00:46:56] here though that I might buy now but um
[00:46:59] what would happen is we'd open these up
[00:47:00] and whichever one had the highest mono
[00:47:01] value is the one that hits the target so
[00:47:03] like say it hits the son's box you get a
[00:47:05] card that you might want there's a card
[00:47:09] if you get the one that has the highest
[00:47:10] amount value here buyer box you might be
[00:47:11] getting another pack that type of thing
[00:47:14] so that's where that's how the carnival
[00:47:16] game goes
[00:47:19] there and it's all the packs that are in
[00:47:22] my
[00:47:23] um in my by now that is available in the
[00:47:28] uh carnival
[00:47:30] game you know what let's do
[00:47:36] this

[00:47:53] me know where you'd like to go and we

[00:52:55] the high is here I think the high was
[00:52:57] five
[00:52:59] here I think the high was a five unless
[00:53:02] there was a six that I saw I thought I
[00:53:03] saw a high was five oh there is a six
[00:53:07] all right there is one six in here all
[00:53:09] right so the high is six higher six

[00:54:22] it's only had five
[00:54:23] here I think five was a
[00:54:26] high all right so I think it's still

[01:14:27] that when I run the game it should
[01:14:28] automatically be on there as you're
[01:14:30] starting with the bid so just give me a
[01:14:32] second
[01:14:42] here now that's the

[01:15:36] put you as the first one on that as the
[01:15:45] bear so we'll see what happens there if
[01:15:48] it ends up putting you over to it
[01:15:49] correctly or not but if you don't if the
[01:15:51] bid doesn't go up you just don't end up
[01:15:53] up buying it anyways but
[01:15:56] um I'll throw that up again there
[01:15:59] because it looks like it just
[01:16:01] uh I'll throw that up for you so you can
[01:16:03] jump in on that because if you didn't if
[01:16:05] the other thing doesn't go through you
[01:16:06] just won't do you won't get it so we
[01:16:08] start this and hopefully that goes
[01:16:10] correctly for you hopefully that goes
[01:16:13] correctly
[01:16:14] here I don't know why it's not showing
[01:16:17] right for whatever reason let me try one
[01:16:19] more time here on another place to make
[01:16:23] sure I'm not missing
[01:16:28] something all right I did that
[01:16:31] one yeah so the pre-bid just says that
[01:16:34] you're there and you you can do it that
[01:16:35] you're interested in it that's what it
[01:16:37] is so if you want it jump in on this it
[01:16:40] says you're interested in it that's all
[01:16:42] that says to me it says you have two
[01:16:43] people interested for doing the bid to
[01:16:46] let me know that I put it up there which
[01:16:49] is why I
[01:16:52] did
[01:16:53] yes at 13 now for
[01:16:56] you oh sorry I'll run it again here let
[01:16:59] me run it again here for um 20 seconds
[01:17:03] but is at $13 for nine PS from The Lord
[01:17:05] of the Ring box currently up it shows me
[01:17:07] that you're interested in it so I put
[01:17:09] this for me to put it up
[01:17:12] here so yeah there we
[01:17:21] go all right that should work there I
[01:17:26] think not running for you

[01:17:39] this how's that is it running
[01:17:44] now Judah can you see it now dang it why
[01:17:48] is it doing that that is so weird so I'm
[01:17:50] pressing on it and it literally says
[01:17:52] your interest interest it shows that
[01:17:54] there's interest I press on it
[01:17:57] here to make it go and it's going but

[01:18:28] anybody right

[01:19:12] Judah I don't know why it's not
[01:19:16] showing how's this this is what I'm
[01:19:20] going to do right now I'm going to do
[01:19:22] this I'm going to it I'm going to move
[01:19:23] it from an auction and I'm just going to
[01:19:25] put it to buy now all right I'm putting

[01:19:38] Judah I'm sorry I don't know what was
[01:19:40] going on with
[01:19:42] that but let me do it this way instead
[01:19:45] kind of a
[01:19:51] around
[01:19:53] do this here pin that that way it's from
[01:19:57] the buy now hopefully you can see it
[01:19:59] from
[01:20:00] there try uh try that let me know if you
[01:20:03] can see
[01:20:05] that oh I wonder if it's an
[01:20:08] international restriction okay Judah I
[01:20:10] put it in the buy now though so check
[01:20:14] the buy now and see if you can see it

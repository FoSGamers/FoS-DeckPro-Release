Read and learn every single card that is in Bloomboro release of Magic the Gathering. Understand each one of them 100%. Build out the D&D game in full 100% so that there's no questions regarding anything and how it will be working for the Bloomboro here. Also make sure there are descriptions of each location and character and stuff like that. That way I can copy and paste it and you can create a picture for me when I need it. But I need you to look at each one of the cards in Bloomboro. Every single card. All the cards in the Bloomboro release. Not just a few. Every single card. The 300+, whatever it is. 500, whatever types of cards. Each one, each different card. I need you to learn about one of each one of them. Read what each one does. Understand what each one does. Fully comprehend what each one does. Once you have done that, then I need you to create that whole story with all of those cards being put in for whatever they could be used for. Whether they were a side quest item, a treasure that's found, whatever it happens to be. Maybe it's food. Whatever it is that they find through opening the packs to build it into the game, like you said. Now, they're never going to be given packs for free. They always need to buy them regularly. That's the only thing they can do. I will do any type of thing for giveaway stuff myself. Don't worry about that. But I do need you to make sure that the game will work within the terms of service of whatnot. Because I don't want to get in trouble for doing this game at all. Make sure that the game works within the terms of service of trading card games, box breaks, and anything related to gambling or mystery bags, bundles, boxes, poll boxes, whatever you want to call them. And make sure the game is fully functioning accurately with it.

You're being lazy and not doing this right. The things that should be for harm for a creature should have one of the same four options that are in the pull box. Same thing as the things that are help as a creature should be one of the four options in the pull box. It needs to always be one of those four options from the pull box only for creatures that are help or harm for any of the characters.

Take the four creatures from the creature poll box. Analyze what the creatures are. Analyze what the characters are. Figure out which of the four, two of the four, would be helpful for a character, and which two of them would be harmful for each character. Make sure that they are not all exactly the same for each character, so that they are all different creatures that are helpful and harmful, out of the only four creatures in the poll box. Remember, only use the four creatures in the poll box.

You are ignoring the fact that any of the four creatures could be helpful or harmful to each one of the characters. You need to have those randomized within them, but have them all so that they make sense for each one of the characters based on their description and what the card does. So, all four of the characters should be randomly split up between being helpful or harmful between all four. All four of the creatures should be randomly split up between helpful or harmful between all four of the characters. Two should be helpful, two should be harmful, and they should be randomly done. That randomization should be made to have those cards make sense with the one, the cards that are being pulled out make sense with the character that they are going to be associated with as helpful or harmful.

Start over with how the pictures are supposed to be generated. I'm generating every one of the pictures. Make sure to have every single picture generated as Bloomburrow MTG art style. Analyze how this is done and confirm to know how to do it exactly that way.

[2024-08-06 19:26:44] ChatGPT:
To generate images that match the Bloomburrow MTG art style, we should focus on the specific aesthetic characteristics of the set. The Bloomburrow set features whimsical, storybook-like art that brings to life the anthropomorphic animal characters and their vibrant, natural surroundings. This art style is detailed, colorful, and often features elements of nature intertwined with the characters' designs.

Here are the updated descriptions for generating images in the Bloomburrow MTG art style:

### Mabel, Heir to Cragflame (Warrior) - Short Bow Encounter

**Description**: Mabel, a mouse warrior, stands in a dense forest clearing, her muscular form poised with anticipation. She has light gray fur with white markings and wears intricately crafted armor made from natural materials and salvaged metals. Mabel wields a large, imposing sword, and her fiery orange eyes reflect her warrior spirit. Before her lies a glistening Short Bow, resting on a mossy stone. Sunlight filters through the trees, casting a golden glow on the bow. Mabel's eyes sparkle with interest as she reaches for the weapon. The scene is depicted in a whimsical, storybook art style fitting the Bloomburrow theme.

To conduct a Whatnot card break or mystery box event effectively and within their guidelines, here are some important rules and best practices:

### Whatnot Box Break and Mystery Box Rules

1. **Visibility**: All items must be visible on screen for the entire duration of the livestream. This includes both sealed and unsealed products, tools, and other essential elements of the break. Removing items from the camera's view before revealing the contents is a violation of the rules.

2. **Honesty in Pricing**: You must be truthful about the pricing of items. Do not mislead buyers about the value of the box or pack by only mentioning the highest potential value. Provide accurate market estimates and be prepared to back up your claims with real data if requested.

3. **Every Buyer Receives a Card**: In card breaks, each buyer must receive at least one card per purchase. For team breaks or other formats where buyers may not receive a specific card from the break, you must still ensure each participant gets at least one card.

4. **Break Rules**: Clearly state the rules for the card break in the show notes or item listings. This includes what is considered “base” or “bulk” cards and how they will be distributed.

5. **No Pre-sales or Multiple Show Breaks**: Card breaks must be conducted in a single live show and cannot span multiple shows. Additionally, positions in card breaks cannot be sold off-platform, including as pre-sales.

6. **No Related Participants**: Participants in the card break must not be related to the seller. This includes members of the seller's household, family members, or employees.

7. **Prohibited Activities**: Whatnot strictly prohibits any form of gambling, including paid entries to raffles or "box wars." Ensure your breaks comply with this rule to avoid any issues.

8. **Mystery Boxes**: All mystery boxes or packs must be shown and opened during the livestream. You should only sell as many spots as there are mystery items, and all packs must be visible and on camera at all times.

9. **Accurate Descriptions**: Provide clear and honest descriptions of the items in your breaks or mystery boxes. This includes detailing the minimum, maximum, and average value of the items if applicable.

10. **Compliance and Conduct**: Adhere to all community guidelines and conduct rules set by Whatnot. This includes maintaining professionalism, avoiding deceptive practices, and ensuring all sales are final unless there are extenuating circumstances.

For detailed guidelines and examples of compliant setups, you can refer to Whatnot's official documentation and community guidelines【278†source】【279†source】【280†source】.

By following these rules and guidelines, you can ensure a smooth and compliant Whatnot card break or mystery box event.

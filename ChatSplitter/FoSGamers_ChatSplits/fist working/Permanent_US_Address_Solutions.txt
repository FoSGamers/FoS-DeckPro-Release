To achieve what you're looking for, you might consider a couple of options:

1. **Virtual Mailbox Services**: These services provide you with a physical address that can receive mail on your behalf. The address is typically in a commercial building or a location that looks like a residential address. Some popular virtual mailbox services include:
   - **iPostal1**
   - **Anytime Mailbox**
   - **Traveling Mailbox**
   - **Earth Class Mail**

   These services will scan your mail, forward it to you wherever you are, or even deposit checks on your behalf. Some services offer an address that looks like a residential one, which can be useful for your situation.

2. **Using a Family or Friend’s Address**: If you have a trusted family member or friend, you could use their address as your permanent mailing address. This option is usually the most affordable since it might only require a minimal contribution to utilities or a small monthly fee.

3. **Renting a Small Property or Mailbox**: Another option is to rent a small property (like a studio or a tiny home) that can serve as your official address. This could be a bit more expensive but offers a legitimate residential address. Alternatively, renting a PO Box with a service like UPS Store, where the address is more flexible, can be a middle-ground solution.

4. **Address with Mail-Handling Services**: Some companies provide more premium services where you can get a residential-looking address, and they handle mail, packages, and other small administrative tasks on your behalf.

**Summary:**
To have a permanent-looking address in the U.S. while traveling, you can use virtual mailbox services, a family or friend’s address, rent a small property or mailbox, or use an address with mail-handling services. Each option varies in cost and appearance, so choose based on your needs and budget.

If you need specific recommendations or more details about any of these options, let me know!

I would like you to look into being able to find a small piece of property in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, or Edgewater, Florida, where I would be able to put a tiny home on it to do pretty much what you're saying would be working and have an address, a permanent address.

To find a small piece of property in New Smyrna Beach or Edgewater, Florida, where you can place a tiny home, you’ll want to consider a few factors:

1. **Zoning Regulations**: Ensure that the property you find allows for tiny homes. Tiny homes may be considered mobile homes or accessory dwelling units (ADUs), so you’ll need to verify that the zoning in the area permits this.

2. **Land Size and Cost**: Look for a small plot of land that meets your budget and size requirements. Smaller lots will typically be less expensive, but you’ll want to ensure it’s large enough to accommodate your tiny home and any necessary utilities.

3. **Utility Access**: Verify that the property has access to utilities such as water, sewage, electricity, and possibly internet. These can be critical depending on how you plan to use the tiny home.

4. **Local Regulations and Permits**: Check with local authorities on any specific permits or requirements you might need for placing a tiny home on the property.

### Steps to Proceed:

1. **Real Estate Search**:
   - You can start by browsing real estate websites like Zillow, Realtor.com, or Redfin. These platforms allow you to search for land specifically, and you can filter by size, price, and location.
   - Contact a local real estate agent specializing in land sales in New Smyrna Beach or Edgewater. They can help you find suitable properties that meet your needs and guide you through the buying process.

2. **Consult Local Authorities**:
   - Visit or contact the zoning office for New Smyrna Beach and Edgewater. They can provide information on what’s permissible in terms of tiny homes and any specific requirements you’ll need to fulfill.

3. **Connecting with Tiny Home Communities**:
   - Look for existing tiny home communities in the area or nearby. Sometimes, these communities offer plots of land specifically zoned and designed for tiny homes.

4. **Legal and Financial Considerations**:
   - Once you identify a property, consider consulting with a local real estate attorney to review any legal aspects, especially zoning and permitting.

### Summary:
You’ll need to ensure zoning permits tiny homes, find a suitable and affordable piece of land, check for utility access, and possibly consult with local authorities and real estate professionals. Using real estate websites, consulting with local agents, and exploring tiny home communities can help you find the right property.

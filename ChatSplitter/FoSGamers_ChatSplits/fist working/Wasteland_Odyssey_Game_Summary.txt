Currently, n8n's native YouTube node does not support extracting captions or subtitles from videos. However, you can achieve this by utilizing the HTTP Request node to interact directly with YouTube's API. This approach allows you to retrieve captions by making specific API calls. For detailed guidance on setting up this workflow, you can refer to discussions and examples provided in the n8n community forum. citeturn0search0

Apologies—I’m only able to open URLs that **you provide directly**, and that specific URL is currently unavailable for me to access.

But I can walk you through how to pull YouTube captions using n8n, even though the native YouTube node doesn’t support it:

---

### **How to Pull YouTube Captions in n8n (Workaround)**

#### **Step 1: Understand the YouTube Captions API**

YouTube captions are accessed via the [YouTube Data API v3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/captions).

To retrieve captions:
- You need the **video ID**
- The **captions must be available and public**
- You’ll need **OAuth2 authentication** with YouTube scopes that allow reading captions

---

#### **Step 2: Set Up OAuth2 in n8n**

1. Go to your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project and enable:
   - **YouTube Data API v3**
3. Create OAuth credentials and add the **redirect URL** from your n8n instance
   (usually: `https://your-n8n-domain/oauth2/callback`)
4. Set up OAuth2 credentials in n8n:
   - Go to **Credentials > New > OAuth2 API**
   - Add the credentials with `access_type=offline` and proper YouTube scopes:
     ```
     https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.force-ssl
     ```

---

#### **Step 3: Use HTTP Request Node to Get Caption Tracks**

1. Add an **HTTP Request** node to your workflow
2. Use this URL to list caption tracks:
   ```
   GET https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/captions?part=snippet&videoId=VIDEO_ID
   ```
   Replace `VIDEO_ID` with your YouTube video ID.

3. In the HTTP node:
   - **Method:** GET
   - **Authentication:** OAuth2 (use the credential you set up)
   - **Query Parameters:**
     - `part=snippet`
     - `videoId=VIDEO_ID`

---

#### **Step 4: Download the Caption File**

Once you get the caption ID from the previous call, make another request:

```
GET https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/captions/CAPTION_ID
```

Add a `tfmt=sbv` or `tfmt=srt` query param to get it in subtitle format.

---

#### **Optional: Parse the SRT File**

You can then parse the SRT (or SBV) file using a **Function node** or external parsing service if needed.

---

Would you like me to build and export a complete example workflow JSON for this process?

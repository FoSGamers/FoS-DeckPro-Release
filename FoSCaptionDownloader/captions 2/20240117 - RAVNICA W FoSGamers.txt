[00:35:13] that yes I did get a a camera well I was
[00:35:16] actually I didn't have get a camera it
[00:35:19] was already on I I got a new computer
[00:35:22] which has a camera built into it but I
[00:35:25] got a MacBook Air and and um getting the
[00:35:27] new computer with it with it built into
[00:35:29] it my wife's like you should start
[00:35:30] trying to do that thing I'm like I don't
[00:35:32] know I don't really feel like it she try
[00:35:33] it try it I'm like so we took some time
[00:35:35] I figured out how to get my phone
[00:35:36] actually to sync to stream the video
[00:35:40] here my phone's doing the streaming
[00:35:42] there which I thought was really cool
[00:35:43] because I have like so much more room
[00:35:44] now compared to my my iPad that I had up
[00:35:47] stream before and now I got like this
[00:35:49] over
[00:35:50] here so yeah and I threw on a little bit
[00:35:53] of a high roller deal for those that
[00:35:54] want it one of
[00:35:55] each
[00:35:57] all right I'll put those back not
[00:36:00] everybody wants those on a Tuesday
[00:36:01] morning but every now and again I throw
[00:36:02] it up there in case somebody happen to
[00:36:04] want
[00:36:08] it and
[00:36:11] what yeah no problem BP I don't worry I
[00:36:14] don't care about that hang out all you
[00:36:16] want though I'm good with that I like it
[00:36:19] I like when people hang out now what I'm
[00:36:22] going to do next is I'm going to
[00:36:24] show off the um the Christmas box that
[00:36:28] is still here that has not been depleted
[00:36:31] yet trying to get this thing gone I I
[00:36:33] would rather not have to take stuff out
[00:36:35] and make a new game I'd rather just
[00:36:36] could deplete it so I dropped it down a
[00:36:38] dollar instead of being 29 this is 28
[00:36:40] each this is what you get on the red
[00:36:42] side ristic study Mount Doom blood moon
[00:36:46] Force negation everybody lives foil
[00:36:49] necro poent fourth a Lingus Lauren
[00:36:51] revealed that's our red side and as you
[00:36:53] see there's not much on there you have
[00:36:55] some pretty good odds right there that's
[00:36:56] $28 you get one pull from the red side
[00:37:00] one pull from the red side and look at
[00:37:01] that I was showing you what was on there
[00:37:03] oh I I got to make sure I shuffle the
[00:37:04] other way now away from the other
[00:37:07] camera all right and then on the green
[00:37:11] side this is what you got on the green
[00:37:13] side Ash
[00:37:17] nod pretty good stuff here flaming a
[00:37:20] lots of surge foils extended
[00:37:23] Arts stuffs like that if you want it
[00:37:27] now that side is normally like $6 but
[00:37:29] because we're doing both of them
[00:37:30] together I do a little deal you get
[00:37:34] normally it was 29 but I want to get rid
[00:37:36] of the box here and I'm trying to get
[00:37:37] rid of it so I put it down to 28 for
[00:37:39] those that would like to try their luck
[00:37:40] on that and while that finishes ticking
[00:37:43] down I'm going to figure out a little
[00:37:45] bit of a pack deal for everyone and this
[00:37:47] is my kids told me I should do this they
[00:37:49] said you've got some single packs left

[01:02:22] it's from sense being from all over it's
[01:02:24] going to be kind of hard even to almost

Find marinas for me to stay with my boat and anything relating to getting in and out of them or using them, what they have for resources, reviews of them, like reviews from people on forums, you know, any type of forum. It could be even like social media, whatever, all over, and that type of thing. So when I ask about, say, I need to find one in a certain area, you can do that for me and give me, you know, a list of, say, five with an option of adding five more, and continually do that until I tell you I have found the marina that I want, and I'll tell you which one it is. That way you know which one I stay at and you can keep that as a, you know, somewhere so that when I ask what marinas I stayed at and what ones are nice ones and what my reviews are, you can provide them.

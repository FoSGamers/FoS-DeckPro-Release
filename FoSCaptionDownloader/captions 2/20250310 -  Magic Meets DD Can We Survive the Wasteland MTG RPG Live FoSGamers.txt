[00:21:41] something later on in the afternoon on
[00:21:42] Sunday after everybody's rested and gone
[00:21:44] to church and whatever else they do you

[00:21:50] going to be on a little bit later to do
[00:21:52] that uh maybe we'll get some of these
[00:21:54] more a little bit figured out and have a
[00:21:56] bunch of them already set up so that we
[00:21:58] go from 1 2 3 and four and they maybe
[00:22:00] they advance and stuff like that they
[00:22:02] get stronger more advanced creatures uh

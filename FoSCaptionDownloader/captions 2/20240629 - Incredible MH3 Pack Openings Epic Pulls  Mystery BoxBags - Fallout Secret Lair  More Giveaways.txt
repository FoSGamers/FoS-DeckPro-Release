[00:32:23] of fun now I am going to make a
[00:32:26] statement here we're going to have to
[00:32:27] make um
[00:32:28] do this
[00:32:33] here add
[00:32:37] it do
[00:32:46] these
[00:32:47] [Music]
[00:32:51] LCI we go
[00:32:58] 11
[00:33:31] do
[00:33:32] that so we have that in there
[00:33:35] correct remove that picture since I have
[00:33:38] to update it there we go Deluxe box
[00:33:44] run little discount for you
[00:33:47] there if you want to try that Deluxe
[00:33:51] box now LCI we are changing those to be
[00:33:55] two Commander Masters
[00:34:03] drafts I don't play Pokemon Snap
[00:34:05] actually
[00:34:08] really so loot box like what it is
[00:34:10] generally what um if you want to jump in
[00:34:12] and participate we play our game here
[00:34:15] and all it is the loot boxes you jump
[00:34:17] you buy one of those you pick a number
[00:34:18] it's kind of like a pull box like uh
[00:34:19] kind of like we do with the um the
[00:34:21] giveaway box but there's that listed now
[00:34:24] what you have there as options in and
[00:34:27] then um if you want we can play as our
[00:34:30] character in our Wasteland adventur
[00:34:32] since we have our
[00:34:34] character we can do that that's kind of
[00:34:36] how normally this is the what well um
[00:34:39] when we're playing our Wasteland
[00:34:40] Adventure the the
[00:34:44] uh enemies will drop a loot box that way
[00:34:47] there's something for you guys to buy
[00:34:48] you're kind of trying to get to pick up
[00:34:50] at the end of each one of the rounds
[00:34:52] that's why that was built like this um
[00:34:54] but some people are liking them doing
[00:34:55] them separately with just getting them
[00:34:57] so I've left them out here this way so
[00:34:58] that you can get them with not just only
[00:35:00] playing the game you can get by itself
[00:35:02] so you have a couple options you can do
[00:35:03] it where you try to play the game or
[00:35:05] like you know the animated one that we
[00:35:07] have where you're that mysterious medic
[00:35:08] wandering through the Wasteland or you
[00:35:10] just pick a number and stuff out of here
[00:35:12] and we go with what the pack is on
[00:35:15] there so that's how that works so like
[00:35:18] say you pick out
[00:35:19] um this one here it would say the Lost
[00:35:22] Cavern dicks on now because we switched
[00:35:24] those out you would get
[00:35:26] two uh Commander Master's
[00:35:29] draft because that would equal the same
[00:35:31] amount that's why we're doing
[00:35:34] that good morning
[00:35:36] Miz how you doing today so I'll do have
[00:35:39] a little discount again there but now
[00:35:40] you kind of understand a little bit what
[00:35:41] that
[00:35:42] is yeah if you have any more questions

[00:48:20] that weeding has whd and hit you again
[00:48:23] knocking you down though this time
[00:48:26] you're now on the ground that weedling
[00:48:27] charging
[00:48:29] over what are you going to do my friend

[00:48:45] the
[00:48:52] ground strength booster it all right you
[00:48:56] take that strength booster
[00:48:58] pill that weedling goes over to whip you
[00:49:01] and as that weeding whips their arms out
[00:49:04] whips their Vines out at
[00:49:06] you they miss you know what I'm gonna
[00:49:09] say you caught those you caught those on
[00:49:12] the ground there as you grab them you
[00:49:14] use them to pull yourself
[00:49:15] up and you got a big hit yourself on
[00:49:20] that weedling there it actually went
[00:49:23] down 15 damage so that weedling is now
[00:49:26] down down to about uh I think it's what

[01:02:09] doing some shows from
[01:02:11] there I don't need to write that AR of
[01:02:13] your name written down with that being
[01:02:18] said what do you guys think I should do
[01:02:21] when I do the top of the mountain
[01:02:23] show should it be singles or should it
[01:02:26] be something packs specials I was
[01:02:28] thinking singles would be easier do a
[01:02:30] top of- the mountain show with uh with
[01:02:32] some hot singles and do a a Magic
[01:02:34] Mountain our Magic Mountain
[01:02:38] show all right Emeral you get to play as
[01:02:41] a character now since you picked up that
[01:02:43] premium loot box all right you were
[01:02:46] wandering the Wasteland that Adventurer
[01:02:48] wandering the Wasteland there and they
[01:02:49] picked up that as our and you get to
[01:02:51] wander and pick up the character the new
[01:02:53] set is Friday that is correct and I will
[01:02:55] have have um I will have two collector
[01:02:58] boxes and play boosters for for Friday
[01:03:02] but I will not have um all of them I'll
[01:03:04] have more collector boosters that will
[01:03:06] be in
[01:03:07] um later because I just I'm not going to
[01:03:10] be there to get them unless I change the
[01:03:12] shipping location of where they're
[01:03:13] coming to but that would be Amazon I'd
[01:03:16] have to change it to from I wonder if I
[01:03:17] could do that and I could get them all
[01:03:19] at the location I'm going to oh
[01:03:20] intriguing all right anyways Beyond
[01:03:23] boosters are smaller right they are
[01:03:26] heal I like it you're going to heal my
[01:03:29] friend Squiggy hanging around you
[01:03:32] heal that is correct they are small they
[01:03:34] like the eight cards that's correct so
[01:03:36] amalis if You' like you can play as our
[01:03:39] character or if not we can have somebody
[01:03:40] else pick up since you did get one of
[01:03:42] those loot boxes that allows you
[01:03:44] but yeah they're eight eight singles in
[01:03:47] a pack and um I think that's what it
[01:03:52] is but there's going to be the um like
[01:03:55] the his hisorical figures and stuff like
[01:03:57] that so like and the serialized cards
[01:03:59] the da Vines and things so that's that
[01:04:01] would be kind of
[01:04:08] cool all right if somebody else would
[01:04:10] like to play amaris is giving that up
[01:04:12] for you I know Frank and others
[01:04:15] do yeah serializes are always a win I
[01:04:18] know others do like playing the card
[01:04:19] there so oh no no we're going we're not
[01:04:22] no we're going to see where our
[01:04:23] character is we're going to play our
[01:04:25] character is what we get to do right now
[01:04:27] so he said amelis goes we didn't want to
[01:04:29] play as a character all right so we had
[01:04:31] Squiggy said they wanted to heal so you
[01:04:32] know what I think we had a health pack
[01:04:34] left over we heal a little bit all right
[01:04:37] a little bit of healing done because we
[01:04:38] are a medic we should be able to heal
[01:04:40] ourselves somewhat so you get a little
[01:04:41] bit healing you go from 100 Health up to
[01:04:43] 120 Health instead of your 140 120
[01:04:46] that's not
[01:04:47] bad all right you go wandering through
[01:04:49] the Wasteland though and as you're

[01:40:00] going to take one of the engineering
[01:40:01] boosters you use one of those
[01:40:03] engineering boosters nice and strong
[01:40:05] wandering through the Wasteland helping
[01:40:06] out in front of you oh no oh no there's
[01:40:09] a mediumsized ranger Raider in front of
[01:40:12] you mediumsized Raider IED Ranger

[01:40:17] what are you going to do my
[01:40:19] friend are you going to run or are you
[01:40:21] going to attack he has a nice sword he
[01:40:23] has a nice axe there you might have a
[01:40:25] problem with him G him down all right
[01:40:27] you're going to go for the head shot oh
[01:40:29] I like it Frank using that using that uh
[01:40:31] engineering
[01:40:35] booster oh you missed the head shot oh
[01:40:38] no you missed a head shot but you do hit
[01:40:41] him in the shoulder he comes running
[01:40:43] towards you you get 10 damage on him
[01:40:45] bring him from 80 down to 70 not bad but
[01:40:48] he comes running over you and you hit
[01:40:49] him with the shoulder and you give him
[01:40:50] the like slap he gives you a nice whack
[01:40:53] with his axe luckily the axe does not
[01:40:55] hit you fully it only scrapes you a
[01:40:57] little bit looks like you only got seven
[01:40:59] damage from that bringing you down to 93
[01:41:02] Health what would you like to do my
[01:41:04] friend
[01:41:05] now hey yeah we get to play a little fun
[01:41:07] we have a fun game while we hang out
[01:41:09] here sometimes people will buy packs and
[01:41:11] like we'll play the game and stuff
[01:41:12] that's how like we do the loot boxes for
[01:41:14] them that's the only reason I did the
[01:41:15] loot boxes is for a way to buy packs so
[01:41:18] you get something randomized like
[01:41:19] dropped after a uh after something that
[01:41:22] way we can do a a game like you know
[01:41:24] yeah a little bit I haven't played in
[01:41:26] years though I actually been thinking
[01:41:28] about doing this so people want to do
[01:41:29] like Discord I've been debating on doing
[01:41:31] some like people have been asking me
[01:41:33] dungeon master so I've been debating on
[01:41:34] doing it so I have some good stories
[01:41:36] I've been
[01:41:38] making I we're gonna go and shoot it
[01:41:41] you'd play all right we go after that
[01:41:43] and you shoot what are you gonna do now
[01:41:46] Frank you going to try the
[01:41:52] range you have your choice now you hit
[01:41:54] him you know he's hit you for seven
[01:41:56] you're down to 93 damage you've gotten
[01:41:58] him down
[01:42:01] 10 I don't really know I haven't played
[01:42:03] much since I was younger so I think it
[01:42:05] would be probably a dungeon master
[01:42:07] because I like doing this all right
[01:42:08] gonna try the kill again you shoot your
[01:42:10] shot you shoot your shot
[01:42:12] off with your assault rifle this time
[01:42:15] you're a little closer to him and with
[01:42:17] your engineering booster it
[01:42:19] helps get a shot right to the side of
[01:42:22] his head
[01:42:23] but he's got some armor on as you see it
[01:42:27] drops him down 50 damage though he is
[01:42:30] now down from 90 from 80 down to 30
[01:42:34] Health he's dangling around there very
[01:42:37] Daisy he swings at you with his axe and
[01:42:41] misses what do you do next and our
[01:42:45] winner is
[01:42:46] rxj you get a choice of sorcery or

[04:01:53] at these or should we uh 93 there you go

[04:02:14] are a little bit mind we're not trying
[04:02:15] to go slow we're trying to just get
[04:02:17] everybody taken care of like you would
[04:02:19] all you want to take care of so we're
[04:02:20] going to look at it here we're going to
[04:02:21] see what this isn't it cool looking art
[04:02:23] ones I believe these are if I remember
[04:02:25] right yes they are all right cool comic
[04:02:27] book looking things so on the back of
[04:02:29] you it has like each it's like different
[04:02:30] sides of the comic I guess you're
[04:02:31] supposed to put them together in a comic
[04:02:34] board at some point once you have them
[04:02:35] all but they're just like different
[04:02:37] parts of this comic
[04:02:39] here different characters and different
[04:02:42] parts I don't know it was a interesting
[04:02:45] thing here that came
[04:02:48] in now some of these have like they're
[04:02:51] like if you put them all together you
[04:02:52] actually might be able to do it with
[04:02:53] this whole this whole pack here you're
[04:02:55] supposedly be able to put them together
[04:02:56] and it'll make like a a comic for you I
[04:02:58] think that's how this worked if I
[04:03:00] remember right so this is will make like
[04:03:02] a whole comic strip of whatever this
[04:03:04] plasma character
[04:03:09] is you go
[04:03:14] I don't know something there there you
[04:03:16] go some interesting cards I don't know
[04:03:19] they're weird they came out they came in
[04:03:21] those extra pack there I don't know
[04:03:22] they're kind of cool supposedly you put
[04:03:23] like I said you put them together my
[04:03:25] understanding is you put them together
[04:03:26] and like um they make a like it's like a
[04:03:28] puzzle that becomes a a whole comic I
[04:03:31] don't know

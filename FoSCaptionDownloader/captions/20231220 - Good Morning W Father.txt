[00:02:35] Let's do an ion
[00:02:37] collector and two
[00:02:40] drafts I think what we be calling that
[00:02:42] is let me remember what we be calling
[00:02:54] that I think that was
[00:02:58] called
[00:03:01] [Music]
[00:03:05] 30 we'll try our luck with 30 on that
[00:03:08] this

[00:03:12] screen deals yes I tried to do deals on
[00:03:18] packs let's get you a pack deal
[00:03:21] going 30 for these three here but hey
[00:03:24] let me know uh if that's something you
[00:03:26] guys want or if there's any type of
[00:03:27] other deal you'd like to see
[00:03:31] I don't mind doing that like that's what
[00:03:32] I try to tell everybody because of how
[00:03:34] whatnot and their fees are if we can get
[00:03:36] if you want say three packs of something
[00:03:38] or you want to instead of doing the pull
[00:03:41] box for $2 or one of these for $5 or $6
[00:03:45] you can say you know give me two of them
[00:03:46] or three of them and I can do a deal
[00:03:48] because it helps me with whatnot fees
[00:03:49] and I pass that deal on to you is pretty
[00:03:52] much how I try to work out here so what
[00:03:55] I'm going to do on this is I'm going to
[00:03:57] call this three-pack deal
[00:04:08] 30 oh it does get addicting cracking
[00:04:11] packs I will definitely say that a ptd
[00:04:14] and I'm GNA have to admit that's part of
[00:04:16] the reason why I think we started doing
[00:04:17] this was my my sons were addicted to it
[00:04:20] and they kept asking me can we buy more
[00:04:22] can we buy more we want to open more we
[00:04:23] want to open more and I was like I can't
[00:04:25] afford to do this and no bye not heading

[00:19:23] Jurassic Park um like the double bundle
[00:19:26] whatever like the foil and the non-foil
[00:19:28] ones so I was going to throw the nonfoil
[00:19:30] ones in as special things for um like I
[00:19:34] was saying I was going to do something
[00:19:35] special around Christmas with
[00:19:36] them but the Tomb Raider ones I'm gonna
[00:19:39] be opening that stuff um come come um

[00:19:44] opening with everybody probably I don't
[00:19:46] know if it's tomorrow or Friday is when
[00:19:49] they had the day off but I haveen an oh
[00:19:51] I forgot to share my collector booster
[00:19:54] uh you know what we did a collector
[00:19:55] booster opening of ion I need to share
[00:19:57] that
[00:19:59] hey Ian thanks for coming in and hanging
[00:20:01] out we didn't want those three packs
[00:20:02] that's fine so we will do some deals
[00:20:07] on boxes right now let's do a mix and
[00:20:11] match let's do like a mix and match you
[00:20:13] know actually you know what I'm not
[00:20:15] going to do a mix and match we're gonna
[00:20:16] do we're gonna see if somebody wants to
[00:20:18] hunt the ring does anybody want to go
[00:20:21] and hunt the one ring in The Lord of the
[00:20:23] Rings box normally it is would be 15 for
[00:20:27] that but because doing three of them I
[00:20:30] am able to drop it down a little I
[00:20:33] really don't want the extra turn secret
[00:20:34] layer but it's no brainer to pay 75 for
[00:20:37] three secret layer then pay 70 for two
[00:20:39] yes
[00:20:40] exactly yes exactly perfect that's
[00:20:43] exactly my thought process too I'm like

[00:37:11] know like they were saying before about
[00:37:12] the foils like not everybody likes the
[00:37:15] foils because they um they uh they kind
[00:37:19] of uh what do you call it they um they
[00:37:21] warp now more so we're going to throw
[00:37:24] this in here next
[00:37:27] we're going to call
[00:37:29] this uh let me get this up here

[00:38:23] draft yeah I like the foils personally
[00:38:26] like I I like how they look but um I
[00:38:29] understand what you're saying like like
[00:38:30] I bought the secret layer and if they
[00:38:32] are if they're bent my thought process
[00:38:36] is I'm going to put them in sleeves
[00:38:38] anyways I'm G to put I'll put them in
[00:38:40] then top loaders for a while and let
[00:38:42] them like straighten out that's kind of
[00:38:45] my that was kind of my thought process
[00:38:46] on it I don't know if it's gonna be
[00:38:49] accurate or not but
[00:38:53] yeah let him straighten out and I'll
[00:38:55] I'll make proxy for a little while all
[00:38:57] right nobody wanted that one so we'll
[00:39:00] put that baby back and we'll do
[00:39:03] another deal we'll do that Exon deal
[00:39:07] again while I find some packs for y'all
[00:39:11] we'll do that Exon deal for the packs y
[00:39:13] all book straighten them out fast I like
[00:39:16] that book straighten them out fast I
[00:39:17] didn't think of that see I was actually
[00:39:19] thinking of just putting them in a top
[00:39:20] loaders and have them straighten out but
[00:39:23] books that's not a bad idea actually I
[00:39:26] didn't even think of that
[00:39:28] yet so we're going to do something like
[00:39:30] this
[00:39:32] here going do something like this here
[00:39:35] next all right we like
[00:39:38] that all right we're going to go with
[00:39:40] that next all right we got it jbril Jael
[00:39:43] gonna try the luck on the One
[00:39:48] Ring try the luck hunting the one ring
[00:39:52] and looking for some
[00:39:55] dinos and uh those of you that have been
[00:39:58] bought from me before know that I can't
[00:40:00] always do it on live because people will
[00:40:02] complain or someone will but I always do
[00:40:06] my best to make sure people get
[00:40:07] something and are happy and you know
[00:40:10] what I mean you might get a shipment
[00:40:12] from me and be excited to see a little
[00:40:14] extra or maybe not I don't know
[00:40:16] sometimes my kids throw in kids will be
[00:40:18] like hey can we do this extra I'm like
[00:40:20] yeah sure why not they're good
[00:40:24] guys or good people
[00:40:30] like over time I get they going to bend
[00:40:32] and everything but straight out of the
[00:40:33] box yes
[00:40:35] exactly
[00:40:39] yes see the books are good I like that
[00:40:42] I'm gonna try I might try that jabril
[00:40:44] and then if I need to but I understand
[00:40:45] the overtime yes because humidity or
[00:40:47] whatever causing it fine you need to do
[00:40:50] that keep it safe but coming right away
[00:40:52] that way yes that is the thing that's
[00:40:54] frustrating all right jabril what let me

[01:02:02] that's around $10 and top loaders or if
[01:02:05] it's above $10 um so I'll get everything
[01:02:08] taken care of for you
[01:02:11] there but thank you very much for
[01:02:15] that yes it was a stretch to find him in
[01:02:18] the Lord of the Ring set but you know
[01:02:19] what the new Lord of the Ring set
[01:02:21] actually has uh a good chunk of a minute
[01:02:24] tell you the truth the uh that new Lord
[01:02:26] of the Rings one that came out with the
[01:02:27] collector boosters so if you got the
[01:02:29] collector boosters each one had like a
[01:02:31] handful of them which was nice but at
[01:02:34] the same time it ended up like really
[01:02:35] lowering the price of some of the cards
[01:02:37] and I got I kind of got a little annoyed
[01:02:38] about that I didn't realize that a
[01:02:40] couple of cards that came out because um
[01:02:43] I had a morgal knife and I I wish I had
[01:02:47] realized that it was going to come out
[01:02:48] in the deck CU I would have sold the
[01:02:50] morgal knife and bought it one for $30
[01:02:52] and sold it at 180 before the freaking
[01:02:54] set came
[01:02:59] out yeah the Lord of the Rings one's
[01:03:02] nice you know what yeah Lord of the
[01:03:04] Rings one is pretty good we had a lot of
[01:03:07] fun with it my family we uh like we did
[01:03:11] a lot of opening with the Lord of the
[01:03:12] Rings like that's how we got back into
[01:03:13] it a lot actually this Lord of the Rings
[01:03:15] pulled the whole family into it rather
[01:03:17] than just me playing a little bit so
[01:03:20] we'll do six polls from the doct BLX and
[01:03:22] six polls from the Lord of the Ring
[01:03:27] box if you want to go hunt for the ring

[01:03:42] ended up taking a bunch of them out and
[01:03:44] made a pole box out of even the ones
[01:03:46] that I had bought for my family because
[01:03:47] I realized I'm never going to use all of
[01:03:49] those like it's there's no way I'm going
[01:03:51] to use all of those so why am i g to why
[01:03:54] am I holding on to him so I just ended

[01:16:16] first so you can see
[01:16:20] it there you go
[01:16:26] yeah it's been like weird recently like
[01:16:28] I've been doing a lot and having fun

[01:16:31] does this weird glitchy stuff I'm like I
[01:16:33] work in it I build apps so I know the
[01:16:37] pain in the butt you got to do with that
[01:16:40] stuff so sometimes hey throw a bone

[01:16:45] that sometimes there's a pain in the
[01:16:46] butt with stuff and you just need to
[01:16:48] tolerate it and but when it's over and
[01:16:52] over and over over again that makes me
[01:16:54] sometimes feel like somebody just pushed
[01:16:56] something out too early because I've
[01:16:57] been there before and I've seen that
[01:16:58] happen where they push it out too early
[01:17:00] unnecessarily which causes issues
[01:17:02] because somebody higher up was like we
[01:17:04] need to get this feature out

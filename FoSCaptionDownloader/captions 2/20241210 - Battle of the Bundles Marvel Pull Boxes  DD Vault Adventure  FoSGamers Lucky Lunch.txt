[00:41:58] once you run out of the codes you got to
[00:41:59] get new ones somehow whether it's be
[00:42:02] dropping something or you have to you
[00:42:04] have somebody drop something a code
[00:42:06] whether you find one somewhere whether
[00:42:07] you you know get some luck and go in and
[00:42:09] get a new

[01:00:42] break we open these and and we break out
[01:00:45] the packs like I normally do um from the
[01:00:47] foundation dusn and the bloom bar bundle
[01:00:49] but for those people that kind of you
[01:00:50] guys some of you like to play like a
[01:00:52] little Adventure game with us where you
[01:00:54] wander through our Wasteland vault
[01:00:57] and you kind of see what happens like
[01:00:58] the other day we were stuck behind a
[01:00:59] door and they found a boss of some kind
[01:01:03] they had to
[01:01:04] fight and luckily they were all able to
[01:01:06] beat it together all six of them when
[01:01:07] they're in the adventurers wandering
[01:01:09] around the Wasteland there it's just a
[01:01:10] little game kind of we play after kind
[01:01:12] of like a after we hey guys have done
[01:01:14] the break it's closed out we I know I
[01:01:17] kind hand out all this all the um things
[01:01:20] I'm handing out like Commons and stuff
[01:01:22] we play a little game like that well I'm
[01:01:23] handing out the commons and uncommons in
[01:01:25] a way kind of kill
[01:01:27] time saying thank you to get that done
[01:01:30] there and that's really what it is and
[01:01:32] then right now we have a few other
[01:01:33] people that are playing so you canot
[01:01:35] your character you said you'll take the
[01:01:36] first one was the plasma rifle there you
[01:01:39] go all right
[01:01:41] Prince so let me get you over there I'm
[01:01:44] GNA have to do this
[01:02:01] we go luk Prince now let me put you in
[01:02:04] here
[01:02:08] Prince n Punk's getting uh some
[01:02:11] technical glitch issues I run into it
[01:02:14] all the
[01:02:17] time there you go Prince now you have
[01:02:20] 100 Health when you start off with your
[01:02:22] character now you're going to get your
[01:02:24] character this time you have starting
[01:02:25] off with a plasma rifle which
[01:02:29] has four actually with this one you get
[01:02:33] got four rounds of ammo when you get
[01:02:34] your first plasma rifle so there you go
[01:02:37] is what you got there now Prince now if
[01:02:39] you played any other things where you
[01:02:40] had the brakes before we were doing the
[01:02:42] um you know the virtual pull boxes so
[01:02:45] that kind of a little bit goes with that
[01:02:46] too so like for instance this here the
[01:02:48] virtual one here which is the Marvel one
[01:02:51] people can get you can get yourself a
[01:02:53] weapon to go with the adventure for
[01:02:55] instance
[01:02:56] you could do uh and potentially get a
[01:02:58] weapon with whatever the single is
[01:02:59] that's why I kind of hav't named with
[01:03:01] weapons and those things before so if
[01:03:02] you haven't been under that that makes
[01:03:04] me maybe a little B more sense now and
[01:03:06] what I've been doing in the past on
[01:03:07] these
[01:03:10] things and so that's kind of like a
[01:03:12] little more of an explanation on why you
[01:03:13] might have been seen that in the past
[01:03:14] going oh look I got I oh that's why it
[01:03:16] says weapon or that's why it says this
[01:03:17] after it it's because we were doing it
[01:03:19] that way we're doing a little game here
[01:03:21] so there you go so for instance now you
[01:03:22] have a pistol on top of it you got
[01:03:25] yourself a pistol plus the bounty board
[01:03:30] which is your single that you got there
[01:03:31] my
[01:03:33] friend right
[01:03:41] here there you go and that's the single
[01:03:43] you got like we do with our regular
[01:03:45] virtual boxes like always but that's the
[01:03:47] reason why it says like weapons at the
[01:03:48] end of it there you
[01:03:51] go there you go my
[01:03:53] friend bounty board
[01:03:56] for that I'll write your name oh I
[01:03:57] already got you written down so I'll put
[01:03:58] you with your stuff that you already
[01:03:59] have written
[01:04:02] down there you go
[01:04:05] Prince yeah yeah kind yeah there you go
[01:04:08] so like for like we it was more or less
[01:04:10] like people like to get a pull box I'm
[01:04:11] fine with that I feel a little weird
[01:04:12] just doing just a pull box so if
[01:04:15] somebody does just a pull box that's
[01:04:16] fine with me if they want to but what I
[01:04:19] kind of feel like I should do a little
[01:04:20] game with it cuz I feel a little I don't
[01:04:22] know I feel like there should be a
[01:04:22] little bit extra with just pull box you
[01:04:25] know little extra
[01:04:29] uh Luke you can try to trade for Buffs
[01:04:33] you have
[01:04:36] currently um
[01:04:39] 92 Health Luke is what you
[01:04:44] have spicy sage has 82 Miss Niko has 71
[01:04:49] and N has
[01:04:54] 88 yeah yeah
[01:04:56] so that's what we're at
[01:04:59] there now remember everybody hanging out
[01:05:01] here make sure you save our show on the
[01:05:02] 12th we're doing a I'm call tips for

[01:10:23] that you can use all now remember though
[01:10:25] you have 1 2 3 4 5 six you now have
[01:10:29] seven things in your inventory because
[01:10:32] you have a
[01:10:33] critical they've added in
[01:10:35] there and you have pistol ammo still
[01:10:38] which takes up a spot so the next thing
[01:10:40] you get you either have to drop
[01:10:41] something or you have to trade something
[01:10:42] else or sell something to get rid of it
[01:10:45] so you can't have more than seven
[01:10:46] because you can't have more than seven
[01:10:47] items now prints get
[01:10:51] yourself an assault rifle I'm going to
[01:10:53] add you in
[01:10:54] there which get you also 15 rounds by
[01:10:56] the
[01:11:02] way there you
[01:11:05] go I G get rid of this music because I'm
[01:11:08] not liking
[01:11:17] it there we
[01:11:21] go not a problem not a
[01:11:23] problem give the pistol ammo all right
[01:11:26] hey you know what Prince bomb you want
[01:11:28] some P pistol ammo we're going to give
[01:11:29] you that spicy said Luke says he's going
[01:11:31] to give that away so we're going to give
[01:11:32] that to you Prince since you're jumping
[01:11:33] in here that gives you 18
[01:11:36] rounds look at that a friend hanging out
[01:11:39] comes running out of the storage one of
[01:11:42] the locations he goes hey you want some
[01:11:44] ammo and throws you some pistol ammo as
[01:11:46] he goes running goes I gotta grab some
[01:11:47] food running out the
[01:11:49] door so there you go you get some pistol
[01:11:52] ammo added on you so now you have 18
[01:11:54] rounds you have an AR with 15 rounds and
[01:11:56] a plasma rifle with four that's not bad
[01:11:58] not bad maybe we can get a few more
[01:12:01] people to participate in our adventure
[01:12:04] though that would be nice if we can get
[01:12:05] a couple more that way we can close this
[01:12:07] out because we only need three more
[01:12:09] spots
[01:12:10] here I think there's only three spots
[01:12:12] we'll find out here in a
[01:12:17] second n Punk's a little stuck I think

[01:30:43] said that like oh I know that
[01:30:46] place let's run some of the Captain
[01:30:48] America one for those of you might want
[01:30:50] the Captain America Marvel one we run

[01:30:54] like my wife was looking I goes look at
[01:30:55] this this I'm like that's a small
[01:30:57] world like I bet I like I wonder if I
[01:31:00] ran into that person at any point in
[01:31:01] time you know because we used to go
[01:31:03] around on Lake we used to fish we used
[01:31:04] to go down to we used to get pizza all
[01:31:06] the time ride our bikes down to the uh
[01:31:08] downtown area and Milton get
[01:31:12] pizza no break has not filled yet break
[01:31:16] has not been filled yet we've been uh we
[01:31:18] were going we ran a couple times we have
[01:31:19] one more spot
[01:31:21] left I know it does it get smaller every
[01:31:23] day I know I wonder if you I know may
[01:31:26] bumped in you get the pizza place or
[01:31:27] that uh the card shop that was down
[01:31:29] there in Milton at one point Prince with
[01:31:31] an exponential growth I like it my
[01:31:34] friend and you also got a critical hit
[01:31:36] on that one that's a nice pickup there
[01:31:39] you go Bud you got yourself a critical
[01:31:41] hit amulet and you got an exponential
[01:31:44] growth
[01:31:57] is that one oh that's out of the other
[01:31:59] ones I
[01:32:00] have I have those organized ha just not
[01:32:04] in this
[01:32:08] box they're right
[01:32:13] here there's your exponential growth my
[01:32:18] friend critical hit I
[01:32:21] know I know Critical Hits always nice so
[01:32:24] let me get you your CTIC kit on there
[01:32:27] we'll run another one of our
[01:32:29] giveaways Prince got a critical hit
[01:32:34] now that's always nice to have we'll run
[01:32:38] this again for those of you that may
[01:32:39] want it try some of
[01:32:44] that all right so critical we'll make it
[01:32:47] so you guaranteed a hit and whatever I
[01:32:49] roll is kind of like an addition on to
[01:32:52] whatever you get so when we roll the 20
[01:32:53] if say you get like 20 you'd get 20
[01:32:55] points added on or say you only get six
[01:32:58] you only get six but maybe you're
[01:32:59] unlucky you only get one you only get
[01:33:00] one point added on that's really what it
[01:33:01] is that's added on to the damage you
[01:33:03] would have done so you guaranteed a hit
[01:33:05] but it just says what happens there hey
[01:33:06] alas thanks for coming in for hanging
[01:33:08] out with us you get a uh giveaway win
[01:33:11] here I need a number between one and 10
[01:33:12] one two three four five six seven eight
[01:33:15] nine and then we can see what you have
[01:33:16] for a giveaway here
[01:33:20] 10 all right and then the nice thing is
[01:33:24] um also for agility um agility helps
[01:33:26] when it comes to knives and pistols it
[01:33:28] gives you a plus one on those 1 2 3 4 5
[01:33:31] 6 7 8 nine 10 number nine is this one
[01:33:35] I'm going to fold turn that around here
[01:33:37] you got a thistle down Players let's see
[01:33:39] where you were off by two from The
[01:33:41] Nightmare off by two on the nightmare
[01:33:43] but let's write your name down there
[01:33:44] that gets you a discount on your
[01:33:46] shipping anyways if you want to jump in
[01:33:48] on any of our single virtual pull boxes
[01:33:51] here that has the singles or if you want
[01:33:52] to jump in on the adventure game or just
[01:33:54] the bundle break in general you can do
[01:33:56] that all right my friend and I'm going
[01:33:58] to put those with you
[01:34:00] Prince and run another one of those if
[01:34:03] anybody wants it so yeah that's what the
[01:34:05] difference for agility does and what
[01:34:08] critical
[01:34:10] does it's like when you're a Kimbo uh
[01:34:13] you know swords I mean not a Kimo swords
[01:34:15] Kimo knives and um uh and pistols you're
[01:34:18] going to be able to uh get a plus one
[01:34:20] for every agility you have
[01:34:24] so like with Nico when he had the swords
[01:34:26] he had plus four I mean two knives he
[01:34:28] had plus four for the both knives
[01:34:29] because each knife was plus two then he
[01:34:32] had plus three because he has three
[01:34:33] agility so he ended up having a plus
[01:34:35] seven for every roll whenever he was
[01:34:37] using
[01:34:38] knives ah see that's kind of what it is
[01:34:41] there
[01:34:45] yeah now I'm going to run the break one
[01:34:48] more time here we have one spot left in
[01:34:51] our break here where we're going to open
[01:34:53] a bundle
[01:34:54] uh three bundles here foundations dusk M
[01:34:56] and Bloom bundle and we're going to do
[01:34:59] our break the regular way we do our
[01:35:00] breaks here but the cool thing that I
[01:35:02] was kind of thinking we do and have a
[01:35:03] little bit of fun is do a little bit of
[01:35:04] an adventure game afterwards for those
[01:35:06] of you that want to do it you going to
[01:35:08] jump in you can play as one of the
[01:35:09] characters that we wander through our uh
[01:35:11] our Wasteland Vault and see what happens
[01:35:14] as we wander through it having some
[01:35:18] fun I'm going to go change some of the
[01:35:20] music
[01:35:32] all right that's
[01:35:33] better spicy says he'll take and use
[01:35:36] agility buff all right I like it going
[01:35:39] to take and use the agility
[01:35:44] buff spicy is going to take and use the
[01:35:47] agility so one two three four five six
[01:35:51] seven
[01:35:54] all right now um that's a good thing
[01:35:57] you're using that I'm add the agility
[01:35:59] buff
[01:36:03] there all right plus one on the agility
[01:36:05] buff for spicy now the only thing is
[01:36:08] spicy you have one plasma rifle two
[01:36:12] three you have four five six seven eight
[01:36:16] items you're going to have to decide on
[01:36:18] something you want to do here because I

[01:51:32] least what is this one did I run it
[01:51:34] right oh that wasn't run right I'm sorry
[01:51:36] about that let me correct that I don't
[01:51:38] know why that I hate that that's the
[01:51:40] glitch thing that it wasn't whenever you
[01:51:41] run the breake for some reason if it
[01:51:42] doesn't doesn't always run at the right
[01:51:45] price so let me correct that there it's
[01:51:47] supposed to be
[01:51:49] two I don't know why it did that there

[01:51:58] box the virtual ones the glitch the
[01:52:02] glitch I sent a message to them like
[01:52:03] they need to change it so it doesn't
[01:52:05] whether I it's either like I can put in
[01:52:07] uh something that it always starts at or
[01:52:10] it is a better uh or like it doesn't do
[01:52:13] that automatically when you switch from
[01:52:14] one to
[01:52:17] another it's like it's frustrating very
[01:52:20] frustrating
[01:52:24] but we got some uh we'll hang out here

[03:05:34] after seeing some of them open you start
[03:05:35] to track some of the weird things that
[03:05:37] occur I've noticed with the play
[03:05:39] boosters unlike with the set boosters
[03:05:41] ones you used to actually get like a was
[03:05:43] more random but they were just better
[03:05:45] more frequently I felt like they just
[03:05:47] stacked the packs better in a way but
[03:05:49] other than that with the bundles those
[03:05:51] ones are always random these I feel like
[03:05:52] they always have a they're all like some
[03:05:55] handful of junk ones and the then there
[03:05:57] some when you have them split up however
[03:05:59] they are very few of them are the

[03:13:50] put that one in a top loader too but the
[03:13:52] rest of them I don't think they are uh
[03:13:55] then I have
[03:13:59] um that one it would be the really the
[03:14:02] only one that's over
[03:14:04] 10 but that's just a really big one
[03:14:07] there you know dmor had a lot more yeah

[03:14:21] know not a bad Bunch there all right let
[03:14:24] me get these all into top loaders
[03:14:26] because we're going to have to have

[03:14:28] we don't hand those ones out since
[03:14:29] they're over 10 let me find where my
[03:14:32] other top loaders are give me one second
[03:14:35] and be right back because they're around
[03:14:37] the corner from me
[03:14:51] I didn't plan on you guys getting like
[03:14:53] 30 hit oh I knew I put one in here it
[03:14:56] was literally straight in front of
[03:15:00] me anyways I wasn't planning on you guys
[03:15:03] getting so many hits I had to go get
[03:15:04] another
[03:15:07] one I had one over here but look I
[03:15:11] did all right let's get that over here
[03:15:17] yes we proxy them and Shuffle correct
[03:15:19] correct we proxy them so we can shuffle
[03:15:27] them yes correct correct we do hand them
[03:15:30] out we just proxy them into a shuffle we
[03:15:31] don't want them to get pretty much PR
[03:15:33] trying to make sure that they're safe
[03:15:34] you know we don't want anything
[03:15:35] happening to
[03:15:40] them you don't me to shuffle them and I
[03:15:44] mean nothing should happen while I'm
[03:15:45] Shuffling them but I like to make sure
[03:15:46] you know there the expensive ones yes it
[03:15:48] was a very nice break yes that
[03:15:50] was all right so I'm going to have to go
[03:15:52] and check what our uh votes
[03:15:56] were what everybody
[03:15:59] thinks and then what we have to do now
[03:16:01] is a little adventuring here for those
[03:16:04] of you that want to continue
[03:16:09] on one two 3 four five
[03:16:13] six seven big hits pretty good on that
[03:16:17] for seven big
[03:16:19] hits the rest of like Good Hits right
[03:16:21] there too that's a pretty good uh break
[03:16:23] there it's adventure time I know all
[03:16:27] right so I'm going to put these over
[03:16:28] here right here this is what we're going
[03:16:30] to do we'll get everybody out here and
[03:16:33] we're going to do a proxy for everybody
[03:16:35] oh hold on do I have those somewhere
[03:16:39] nearby
[03:16:42] H I might have the Benji somewhere
[03:16:45] nearby that we can use as the proxy
[03:16:50] do
[03:16:51] I do
[03:16:55] I I
[03:16:57] might I might I'll be right back one
[03:17:00] more
[03:17:02] second they're right over here
[03:17:42] maybe I lied I thought they were in that
[03:17:44] box right there
[03:17:53] no
[03:17:55] well oh I do have
[03:17:59] um we'll do this
[03:18:02] maybe just starting to find everything
[03:18:05] again those are the dice that we're
[03:18:07] going to have to use
[03:18:14] later no
[03:18:17] not those that's not
[03:18:23] it no damn

[03:19:08] ones in there they're not in there we'll
[03:19:10] use this one instead
[03:19:20] that'll
[03:19:21] work I thought I had those ones in there
[03:19:23] to use a basball
[03:19:25] cards but you know I don't have them in
[03:19:28] there it looks like so we're going to
[03:19:30] have to do something else I'll have to
[03:19:31] use these

[03:34:38] problem we have finished actually you
[03:34:41] know kind of have finished the break
[03:34:43] here all right we're going to finish our
[03:34:45] um our pole though we had foundations
[03:34:49] was thought as the big hit on that one
[03:34:51] all right all right everyone foundations
[03:34:52] was thought the hit today foundations o
[03:34:56] was a 50/50 almost between foundations
[03:34:58] and duskmourn on us oh interesting on
[03:35:00] that
[03:35:01] one all right 50/50 on that yeah it was
[03:35:05] a good one
[03:35:09] though well well now what's going on is
[03:35:13] um you know you all are wandering in

[03:43:00] it all anyways you start and you turn
[03:43:04] and you go around a corner and you
[03:43:06] see a group of
[03:43:08] Raiders oh
[03:43:10] no Raiders are not helpful they've never
[03:43:14] been helpful for you guys
[03:43:16] and all of a sudden you see in those
[03:43:18] group of

[03:44:07] Raiders eight
[03:44:10] Raiders I know well you know you got
[03:44:13] there's six spots in the thing I figured
[03:44:15] more people were going to you know more
[03:44:17] people are going to be involved in the
[03:44:19] thing I guess I guess we only got we
[03:44:21] only got
[03:44:24] three four small 25 two mid 35 and two
[03:44:29] large 75 that is
[03:44:31] correct the rolls for the hits are the
[03:44:33] same as all the other ones used to be
[03:44:35] which are um let me get those out for
[03:44:36] you they're the hold on a second let me

[03:44:50] 17 so here you have two large
[03:45:01] Raiders

[03:45:05] three four small Raiders and a medium
[03:45:09] Raider there we'll do a little
[03:45:12] visualization on that one I'll just
[03:45:14] Shuffle that bck into back into those
[03:45:15] things
[03:45:16] after there ah so the small Raiders are
[03:45:21] 15 medium is 16 large

[03:45:47] yeah I'm sorry
[03:45:51] guys well the rest I know the rest won't
[03:45:53] die if you to the kill you can might be
[03:45:55] able to scare some away if you kill
[03:45:56] enough of the big ones off though before
[03:45:58] the little ones they might run off kind
[03:45:59] of thing so you have Nico spicy Luke
[03:46:03] null and Prince if Luke yeah Luke if
[03:46:05] you're here so there's five of you
[03:46:07] against eight and I'm going to start
[03:46:09] handing out the singles here so you guys
[03:46:11] going to decide they they all are
[03:46:13] hanging around that fire there there and
[03:46:15] they're about they they don't fully see
[03:46:17] you yet so you're going to get one
[03:46:19] probably one shot
[03:46:21] off what I do
[03:46:23] that one shot off before you
[03:46:29] uh are noticed like one shot off by
[03:46:32] anybody all
[03:46:37] right so let's do that I was going to
[03:46:40] hand out a couple of these but I think
[03:46:42] I'm going to be done when I hand this
[03:46:44] one out here
[03:46:46] I want to no more handing out and I just
[03:46:48] want to put everything away so we can
[03:46:49] roll our Dice and see what happens you
[03:46:51] have to let me know what you guys all
[03:46:53] want all
[03:46:58] right giving you a second to figure out
[03:47:00] your plan is what I've been doing
[03:47:02] generally I try to put you guys in this
[03:47:04] packs here get your plans you're
[03:47:06] figuring
[03:47:07] out oh you lagged out for a second not a
[03:47:10] problem take your SEC take your
[03:47:13] time so we're waiting on uh I just
[03:47:16] getting everybody's stuff kind of like
[03:47:17] together while you were waiting on you
[03:47:18] guys to decide what you want to do and
[03:47:21] who you want to send out you're going to
[03:47:22] get one probably one chance to go first
[03:47:26] like one person will be able to
[03:47:28] shoot and then they'll then the Raiders
[03:47:31] will be alerted and you'll have to
[03:47:32] they'll all
[03:47:34] attack all right so we're getting this
[03:47:36] we're just putting everything in a way
[03:47:37] here and letting you decide a little bit
[03:47:39] because you you did open the door they
[03:47:41] are H around the campfire they weren't
[03:47:43] ready but as soon soon as you shoot
[03:47:45] they're definitely going to be ready
[03:47:48] then so I just wanted to make sure we
[03:47:50] are aware of everything we're
[03:47:52] doing all
[03:47:57] right oh yeah you got a critical hits
[03:48:00] you have that's a good point you have
[03:48:02] critical hits you have that is a very
[03:48:05] good point you can use your critical
[03:48:08] hits that is
[03:48:12] true that guarantees you hit and then
[03:48:15] it's uh whatever else you get added on
[03:48:16] to it for your uh for your
[03:48:20] roll and then afterwards after this is
[03:48:22] over we'll hand out the dice to everyone
[03:48:24] okay is what we'll do we'll do the dice
[03:48:27] thing here like I said at the end of the
[03:48:28] game that way we can use dice dur it
[03:48:30] right
[03:48:31] now who has
[03:48:34] critical we have Prince has a
[03:48:40] critical
[03:48:43] um n Punk has a pit crtical and
[03:48:52] Prince all right and throw that right
[03:48:56] there and I'm going to put these all off
[03:48:59] the
[03:49:00] side so that we can get our thing our
[03:49:02] patented rolling machine out patented
[03:49:05] rolling machine
[03:49:17] it's just a box and look we're going to
[03:49:19] be rolling the opposite direction this
[03:49:21] time uhoh this might screw things up for
[03:49:28] everyone I don't know which one are we
[03:49:30] going
[03:49:32] with you decide what you're
[03:49:35] doing so Luke is going to go after the
[03:49:39] big guy using the critical
[03:49:50] Luke you do have a critical that is
[03:49:55] true that what we're
[03:49:58] doing you're going to take the sword to
[03:50:02] him you want to take the sword to the
[03:50:05] big guy or all
[03:50:06] right they roll 17 to hit but you're
[03:50:09] guaranteed to hit because you have the
[03:50:11] uh because you have the other thing it's
[03:50:12] just what addition to it so which dice
[03:50:15] are we going to use here guys you ladies
[03:50:17] and gentlemen and
[03:50:20] days and whoever is hanging out with us

[03:50:43] 20 well look at that one I think we're
[03:50:46] going to go with purple you were right
[03:50:48] on that one here we go let's see what
[03:50:51] happens we're going to get the other
[03:50:52] dice out way we're going to put those
[03:50:53] over there my my dice that we're not
[03:50:55] going to be using because those are
[03:50:56] unlucky recently all right here we go

[03:51:27] on
[03:51:29] Dorne yeah I know well hey well that's
[03:51:31] what we're using right now so let's see
[03:51:34] Luke is going uh
[03:51:36] first with the sword you already got a
[03:51:40] critical hit guaranteeing the hit so
[03:51:41] guaranteeing yourself hit we're going to
[03:51:42] see what happens though
[03:51:44] oh buddy you get another natural
[03:51:49] 20 that is awesome you going after one
[03:51:52] of the big guys Luke comes charging in
[03:51:55] as they're getting ready to stand up
[03:51:56] from the
[03:51:57] fire charging in hits that big guy with
[03:52:00] his
[03:52:01] giant
[03:52:03] sword swinging in on it that brings you
[03:52:06] from oh all right wait for I forgot we
[03:52:08] add the 20 and
[03:52:11] ooh that brings him down to 45

[03:52:20] hit almost halfway down that was 30 off
[03:52:24] nice
[03:52:26] one well done Luke now with that that
[03:52:29] large Raider howls drops his axe because
[03:52:33] he's having a hard time picking that up
[03:52:35] now he might have a little bit of luck
[03:52:36] on that one now the other small one of
[03:52:38] the small reader turns around though and
[03:52:41] shoots
[03:52:45] because they're quick the small ones are
[03:52:46] a little quicker than normal shoots at
[03:52:49] you but let's see what
[03:52:55] happens Luke because he didn't like you
[03:52:58] hitting him shoots at you is what we
[03:53:00] were saying and what happens though luk
[03:53:03] you go from 92 down to 87 he only gets

[03:57:57] Health all right what are we doing
[03:58:00] here you guys have a chck quick quick
[03:58:03] second you're going to decide are you
[03:58:04] going to guys work together quickly or
[03:58:06] you going to uh you know they've all
[03:58:07] gotten their things off the you got you
[03:58:10] have four small Raiders a two
[03:58:12] mediumsized Raider and a big one
[03:58:14] you use your plasma
[03:58:16] rifle all right shoot it at the big
[03:58:20] guy combo towards the big
[03:58:22] guy all right you guys aren't doing
[03:58:24] anything you're just going to go right
[03:58:25] towards the big guy Prince rolls oh no
[03:58:28] Prince you get one you you
[03:58:32] miss Luke tries to shoot him too get
[03:58:35] up you get him though with yours Luke
[03:58:40] nice one nice one with that one you get
[03:58:44] them with your
[03:58:48] uh AR there that you've been using so
[03:58:51] that hits them nice one that and he goes
[03:58:54] down from
[03:58:56] 75 but that's an AR it brings him from
[03:58:58] 75 down to 67 not a bad hit on that guy
[03:59:03] not a bad hit on that
[03:59:05] guy who we doing next spicy's going to
[03:59:10] shoot spicy's going to shoot at the big
[03:59:13] guy
[03:59:15] with the uh plasma rifle I'm
[03:59:18] assuming oh you got a natural
[03:59:22] 20 you got a natural 20
[03:59:27] spicy good job
[03:59:33] bud come on Mouse move
[03:59:38] right good one on that one now
[03:59:41] spicy do you want to uh
[03:59:45] see what happens here give me one second
[03:59:47] I got to roll
[03:59:49] again you get three added on to it
[03:59:52] that's a critical hit it's a guaranteed
[03:59:53] hit nice one and you add on the three
[03:59:55] here so let's see what we get on that
[03:59:57] we're going to times it by that one
[04:00:00] because whenever you get a natural 20 we
[04:00:02] times it by what we hit here as long as
[04:00:04] it's under five that's what I would I
[04:00:06] nor use the five dice but I don't have
[04:00:08] it on me right now well I mean the six
[04:00:10] dice but I don't have it on me right now
[04:00:12] so we luckily got three
[04:00:14] so you got to
[04:00:18] have cuz I feel like that's you should
[04:00:20] get a little bit something better better
[04:00:21] when you get a natural 20
[04:00:25] roll that would
[04:00:41] be nice
[04:00:50] why didn't do
[04:00:52] that got 34 it's on now 34 down
[04:00:57] to right now we're in the middle of this
[04:01:00] we cannot trade pogs for anything you
[04:01:01] cannot go to a a safe haven when you're
[04:01:03] in the middle of one that was a good hit
[04:01:05] well it's like I said you get a you get
[04:01:06] a multiplier on it because it was an it
[04:01:09] was an auto uh because you hit the
[04:01:11] natural 20 there that was pretty sweet
[04:01:13] dude that very rarely happens when we're
[04:01:15] fighting all right that brought him down
[04:01:17] to 34 you you guys are lucky on that
[04:01:20] one all right here we go now we had n
[04:01:25] Punk was going to
[04:01:27] come the sword of the big guy from
[04:01:30] behind all right I like that and then so
[04:01:34] let's see if he gets you from behind
[04:01:36] he's H he's howling that large Raider is
[04:01:38] hauling he is not happy right now n Punk
[04:01:42] ah n punk I'm sorry dude
[04:01:45] that did not help the one but he is mad
[04:01:47] it doesn't really help he's dropped his
[04:01:48] axe to the ground he can't even do
[04:01:51] anything but around turns the
[04:01:53] mediumsized Raider both of them they
[04:01:56] shoot at you n Punk hitting
[04:01:59] you from 87 down to
[04:02:03] 80 and Prince Broham you're from 90 down
[04:02:08] to 79 that was a hit on you
[04:02:16] you did it look at that you're dual
[04:02:18] knives towards the big guy did you

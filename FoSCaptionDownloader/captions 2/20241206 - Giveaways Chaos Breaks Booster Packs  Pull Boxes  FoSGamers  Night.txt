[00:06:48] though let me get your uh in here with
[00:06:50] your other
[00:06:52] ones not a pro sh so the way that we do
[00:06:55] the breakes here is um since there's six
[00:06:57] Wolverine cards that are in there and
[00:06:59] there's six spots in the break what we
[00:07:00] do is I open the Wolverine one um all
[00:07:04] six cards will be put in the sleeves we
[00:07:05] shuffle them up and then I um you got I
[00:07:08] hand them out an order of who purchased
[00:07:11] a spot and you get whatever that one
[00:07:12] card is and so your name is written on
[00:07:14] that that's kind of like a we know who's
[00:07:15] in what spot and then I take all the
[00:07:17] mythics the rares any common and
[00:07:20] uncommon that is over $3 and I I put
[00:07:23] them in sleeves I shuffle them all up
[00:07:24] also and then um
[00:07:27] any then we hand them out out to
[00:07:29] everybody in there in just literally in
[00:07:31] order 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6
[00:07:34] continuously until we do that and then
[00:07:36] we uh so yeah we got one spot left in
[00:07:38] that Wolverine one so that looks like a
[00:07:40] fun one there we only got spot number
[00:07:41] one left there so I'm just going to
[00:07:43] actually pin that so we got that one
[00:07:45] spot that's left there and right now
[00:07:48] with the Wolverine one The Wolverine one
[00:07:50] has two times spiral well four times
[00:07:52] spiral a mystery booster and a
[00:07:54] foundations two mystery boosters and
[00:07:56] Foundations then we have time spiral the
[00:07:58] other mystery booster and the ioria so
[00:08:00] we'll pick these ones out no one picked
[00:08:02] those ones out and then you get the
[00:08:03] Wolverine one right here in the back
[00:08:05] that's how we do that we break them the
[00:08:07] way like I said the way we break it is
[00:08:08] everybody gets one of the Wolverine
[00:08:09] cards guaranteed I can't guarantee which
[00:08:11] one you all are going to get one though
[00:08:13] and then the other ones after that we
[00:08:14] take all the mythics rares and
[00:08:17] uncommon's over $3 and we shuffle them
[00:08:18] up and hand them out and that's how we
[00:08:19] do the Wolverine one there the Captain
[00:08:22] America one is like that we're almost
[00:08:23] done with that Wolverine one I think we
[00:08:25] have one spot left there we go Trace
[00:08:28] how's it going Luke

[00:08:34] out I think we just closed that last
[00:08:36] spot out in the Wolverine one well look

[00:08:40] this we're going to do this with the
[00:08:42] Wolverine one we're going to put the
[00:08:43] Captain America one off to the side

[01:06:47] all in the in there you can literally
[01:06:49] see every one of them if you click on it
[01:06:50] it tells you exactly what the pricing
[01:06:51] and every single thing is in it which is
[01:06:53] I like doing it this way cuz makes it
[01:06:55] nice and easy for everyone you know
[01:06:56] straightforward you can see everything
[01:06:58] you're getting you know and prices of
[01:07:00] them all too cuz I put all the prices
[01:07:02] based off of TCG player I always do for
[01:07:04] the pricing on them so they're all there
[01:07:05] for everyone and you can get maybe like
[01:07:07] I said you could potentially get one of
[01:07:08] these or one of the other ones we having
[01:07:10] a little bit fun see what we get going
[01:07:12] on all right there we
[01:07:16] go let's see how it goes

[01:08:15] those
[01:08:17] there and a leveler nice that M might
[01:08:22] actually be I think that's one in this
[01:08:24] bad of stuff I actually do think that's
[01:08:26] in this batch of stuff right
[01:08:29] here I have to double check think that
[01:08:32] is in this batch I recently remember
[01:08:33] getting that one out feel like that was
[01:08:35] one I pulled out recently
[01:08:39] leveler from time spiral I do think 100%
[01:08:44] I pulled that out recently like as in
[01:08:45] the past two or three days here there's
[01:08:48] your leveler there you go nice one there
[01:08:51] that's a good pickup too there we go we
[01:08:55] have our giveaway going there I'll get
[01:08:56] right over you right now and we going to
[01:08:58] run another one in the background there
[01:09:01] let's get over that and that is Neco 1
[01:09:04] through 10 if you don't mind Nico I'm
[01:09:06] going to get the infer the infinite for
[01:09:09] your leveler coming to you right there
[01:09:10] my
[01:09:12] friend there you are and Nico 1 through
[01:09:15] 10 1 2 3 4 five 6 Seven 8 nine you said
[01:09:18] number five so number five it is
[01:09:26] elsewhere flask I do not have that one
[01:09:28] I'm going to have to randomize you again
[01:09:30] enter cuz that one was pulled earlier
[01:09:32] and I don't know what
[01:09:33] happened all right number five one two
[01:09:36] three four five is Red Rock Sentinel and
[01:09:41] oh dakore was number two dmore was
[01:09:43] number two all right Nico put you with
[01:09:45] your other stuff
[01:09:55] Nico put you over here with all the good
[01:09:58] luck that you've had
[01:09:59] today you and your friend Trace coming
[01:10:02] in with some good big luck today that's
[01:10:04] all I got to
[01:10:06] say flip it upside down flip that five
[01:10:10] upside you want the panther oh well it's
[01:10:13] a nice one there that is a good one
[01:10:14] sitting there vye we have the vye harb
[01:10:17] burer
[01:10:27] do I really not have
[01:10:30] that why am I missing so many things
[01:10:33] here all of a
[01:10:34] sudden oh that might be one of the new
[01:10:36] ones I pulled
[01:10:38] out hold
[01:10:40] on that's
[01:10:44] why and if it's not here you get another
[01:10:47] chance which everybody likes getting
[01:10:49] another chance that means I just I need
[01:10:50] to Goble check what I went through I
[01:10:52] might not have uh maybe it's you guys
[01:10:54] are going to get luck to because that
[01:10:55] might mean you guys are going to have
[01:10:57] like a handful of things that aren't in
[01:10:58] there if you get another chance to run
[01:11:03] continuously because I think I already
[01:11:05] pulled that one out for
[01:11:07] somebody I do remember pulling that one
[01:11:10] out for someone earlier and it's not
[01:11:11] here so that's why I'm like what is
[01:11:13] going on here morning stream at night
[01:11:16] yes the morning stream at night I'm
[01:11:17] getting broken that's what happened I
[01:11:19] think some of the ones from the morning
[01:11:20] one went that way but here we going to
[01:11:22] randomize you again strict Proctor I do
[01:11:25] think I have that
[01:11:27] one do think I have that one we got
[01:11:29] three chances on that got three chances
[01:11:31] on that
[01:11:34] one because I forgot to remove
[01:11:43] some there you go strict
[01:11:47] Proctor hey well hey that's better than
[01:11:49] uh you got three chances though you did
[01:11:52] get three chances though so we're going
[01:11:54] to get rid of the uh um I got to get
[01:11:56] that other one there the vul and the
[01:11:58] alware flask out I don't know why those
[01:12:00] are in there they shouldn't have been
[01:12:02] but we'll remove
[01:12:04] them that gives you guys better
[01:12:07] opportunities then we're going to go to
[01:12:09] that other one for the
[01:12:10] elsewhere that means you have better
[01:12:12] chances
[01:12:16] now El flask there you go we're going to
[01:12:19] run that again we'll run that again
[01:12:21] there there you go enter D infinite

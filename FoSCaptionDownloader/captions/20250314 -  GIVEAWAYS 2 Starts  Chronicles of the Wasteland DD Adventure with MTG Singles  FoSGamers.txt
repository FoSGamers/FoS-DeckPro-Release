[00:11:20] get that one out I know that one's in
[00:11:28] there okay

[00:13:41] adjustment I swear it
[00:13:45] was in here
[00:13:59] done with
[00:14:20] that the
[00:14:22] hell that is not at all what I had set

[00:16:15] [Music]
[00:16:30] H all right well we'll we'll do this
[00:16:34] anyways no one's uh yeah
[00:16:37] whatever by the way well whatever we'll
[00:16:42] keep
[00:16:49] going I can't seem to figure out what

[00:18:07] something that's not fun I don't like
[00:18:15] that that
[00:18:20] stinks that's okay
[00:18:24] though we can do this
[00:18:34] we can do this
[00:18:38] instead have to figure out what happened
[00:18:40] to that one we just do
[00:18:55] this if I can seriously another one like
[00:19:02] that I need to put some in alphabetical
[00:19:05] order that might be part of the problem
[00:19:07] but hey [Â __Â ] happens
[00:19:30] seriously if I miss more things losing
[00:19:33] more things from these sets here I'm
[00:19:34] going to lose my [Â __Â ]
[00:19:43] mind I wonder if that's ones that I
[00:19:47] uh whatever I'm going to deal with that
[00:19:49] one
[00:20:01] well it looks like today we have to go
[00:20:03] through everything and scan
[00:20:06] everything that might be what I have to
[00:20:08] stop doing stop and do today if we
[00:20:12] uh don't have much curve but there we go
[00:20:15] there's your emerle that'll go out there
[00:20:18] there we'll put those

[00:22:13] available you can see them all maybe we
[00:22:15] just go through and [Â __Â ] do some
[00:22:17] singles today for a little while cuz
[00:22:19] might as well while we're sitting here
[00:22:21] doing nothing
[00:22:37] okay we got nothing going so no
[00:23:07] I don't understand what's going on we
[00:23:09] should be fine with the
[00:23:13] internet there is nothing connected to
[00:23:15] it that would cause uh anything to occur
[00:23:18] here so I don't know there you go got
[00:23:21] that one there's one of them there all
[00:23:22] going to burn building I like
[00:23:25] that we have a city
[00:23:34] Adventure we'll
[00:23:36] um I we'll just
[00:23:39] [Â __Â ] do nothing for a
[00:23:41] while I think what I got screwed with
[00:23:44] was that one goddamn delivery
[00:24:00] we'll run some singles there again for
[00:24:01] you guys that's our singles auto box
[00:24:04] there you can go and see what's in them
[00:24:07] all more of uh the secret sets we are
[00:24:10] doing them as but you can check
[00:24:12] everything out it has all the price of
[00:24:13] them each item and what you're going to
[00:24:16] get for a a storage render maybe a safe
[00:24:19] haven there maybe you want to go with

[00:24:24] plasma rifle for the adventure try to
[00:24:27] get one of those
[00:24:29] and then we'll see what happens what are
[00:24:31] you going to encounter is it going to be
[00:24:33] just an abandoned building with
[00:24:34] something in it you have to look around
[00:24:36] maybe a
[00:24:38] Traer maybe you run into
[00:24:44] um a brawler that you need to
[00:24:47] fight I don't
[00:24:49] know we'll find out but there's singles
[00:24:52] in those boxes there that's all there
[00:24:54] are a bunch of singles there 100

[00:36:51] going to do this you run
[00:36:56] into small tool another person you have
[00:37:00] to
[00:37:01] decide William I think you're in here
[00:37:04] uhoh I scrolled too quick let to get a

[00:37:31] go and you have the
[00:37:37] flamethrower and you decide you're going
[00:37:38] to burn them all right I like it so with
[00:37:41] the flamethrower that is a plus six on
[00:37:44] your
[00:37:45] encounter so we'll get our dice out of
[00:37:47] here and you get three dice to roll with
[00:37:51] so you get a plus six and to hit that
[00:37:54] Scrapper in the duel you got to get a 14
[00:37:56] or higher but because you have a six for
[00:37:58] your extra on your roll because you're a
[00:37:59] flamethrower you got there that means
[00:38:01] how much you need to get extra uh what
[00:38:05] what how much do you need they're at 14
[00:38:08] eight they need get eight all right you

[00:38:12] eight see what you got oh you got a
[00:38:16] 15 yeah oh we'll put it over him so you
[00:38:18] can see you got yourself a
[00:38:20] 15 but with a flamethrower you know what
[00:38:23] you did not do a lot of damage to
[00:38:25] him you only got four damage sadly but
[00:38:29] they are on fire that Scrapper duel
[00:38:32] turns around and they decide to run CU
[00:38:34] they don't like being on fire they they
[00:38:35] have no way to stop that and put it out
[00:38:37] so they turn around they run away the
[00:38:39] process are running away

[01:02:14] critical there and you ran
[01:02:18] into a large Raider in front of you all
[01:02:22] right you have to decide you have a
[01:02:23] pistol a knife in your critical hit
[01:02:25] because you're being new haven't hadn't
[01:02:26] come in yet that's what your character

[01:02:30] for instance I was going to have our
[01:02:31] friend spicy if Nico and and Miss Nico
[01:02:34] showed up since they played the game for
[01:02:36] a while they've been in for a bit I was
[01:02:37] going to generate images for them and
[01:02:39] their individual characters now so
[01:02:41] they're going to have their own
[01:02:41] characters in the game with their own
[01:02:43] images if they uh when they come in and
[01:02:45] participate I know the next time you
[01:02:47] participate you're going to have to give
[01:02:48] me what you kind of want to look like
[01:02:50] and we're going to generate an image for
[01:02:52] you oh that was kind of fun so I figured
[01:02:54] after people play for a while so you
[01:02:56] have to decide what you want to do here
[01:02:58] my friend it guy are you going
[01:03:02] to use your critical hit on them with
[01:03:05] your pistol or your knife or you going
[01:03:07] to turn and flee run turn around and
[01:03:10] flee try to find your way
[01:03:13] away you have to decide my friend how
[01:03:16] are you going to participate there
[01:03:23] today oh I understand that
[01:03:26] the other day I had uh we had a a storm
[01:03:29] that came through and then a lot of wind
[01:03:31] came through after and we thought we
[01:03:32] were blowing around and uh surprise you
[01:03:35] oh the boys can decide yours not a bad
[01:03:37] one that's not a bad idea actually we
[01:03:39] might have them do that what we we have
[01:03:42] spicy decide who the boy is the Raider
[01:03:45] armed currently you are not sure they're
[01:03:48] just kind of large Raider standing there
[01:03:50] in front of you you went to wander into
[01:03:51] this town all right and you turned a
[01:03:55] corner
[01:03:56] and you happen to see this guy there
[01:03:58] this large Raider you don't see any
[01:04:00] weapons currently but that doesn't mean
[01:04:02] he doesn't have anything strapped on his
[01:04:04] back all right now I'm going to start
[01:04:06] the next one here so you're going to get
[01:04:09] a
[01:04:09] minute minute and a half to make your

[01:04:24] it for 40 it says you to flee this time
[01:04:26] too many uncertainties I you know what
[01:04:28] it's not a bad idea so you turn around
[01:04:30] you run away you find some burnt
[01:04:33] buildings and you safely Escape but

[01:04:47] right oh you got heads so on the way the
[01:04:51] Raider starts to chase you and that
[01:04:53] means you ended up having to you look

[01:19:04] of the spot that they picked
[01:19:06] out and that is how we uh how we do that
[01:19:10] one that's how we do those breaks pretty
[01:19:12] straightforward and then you get to
[01:19:13] participate in a little Adventure too
[01:19:16] there no flame though flame
[01:19:18] pillers right now though doing this you
[01:19:20] got to
[01:19:22] decide you've run into with your sword
[01:19:27] here a uh let's go
[01:19:32] live this you have a small raadar in
[01:19:35] front of you that's small they're
[01:19:36] getting ready to do a uh it looks like
[01:19:38] they might be trying to they're they're
[01:19:39] sizing you up there what would you like
[01:19:42] to do with your thing with your
[01:19:44] character there re uh flame you can
[01:19:47] decide if you want to attack I want to
[01:19:48] run then we'll go on to our next one
[01:19:50] here and see if anybody wants to
[01:19:52] participate in doing some more of the
[01:19:54] Adventure
[01:20:00] here really that's crazy sry I don't
[01:20:04] know why we would be doing that we'll
[01:20:06] run another one here and we'll do it for
[01:20:07] like I said before it's going to be like
[01:20:10] 30 we'll do a minute that way give you
[01:20:12] some time to decide what you're doing
[01:20:14] you're going to attack I like it now
[01:20:16] your sword gets you
[01:20:19] a A plus five on your attack so you go
[01:20:23] after that small one and they're only a
[01:20:25] 14 being a small one so that means you
[01:20:27] need to get nine or
[01:20:29] higher and you got a
[01:20:32] four you got a four my friend that
[01:20:35] didn't work well oh no you missed no and
[01:20:38] that small Raider though they they need
[01:20:41] a 13 or higher to attack and hit you and
[01:20:44] they ah they hit they got a 15 no damage
[01:20:48] though flame my friend it looks like you
[01:20:52] got lucky though you only got three
[01:20:53] damage though that's good so luckily not
[01:20:56] a lot of damage there
[01:20:59] who who was it nope that's not what I
[01:21:02] meant to
[01:21:04] do so you only get three damage bring
[01:21:09] you down to
[01:21:10] 97 now that's not that much that's okay
[01:21:13] though because you have a pistol and a
[01:21:16] knife that uh that guy wanders away cuz
[01:21:20] he doesn't really you don't have
[01:21:21] anything to steal at the moment so he
[01:21:23] just wanders away there
[01:21:25] we see who's going to come out next and
[01:21:26] play a little bit who got that oh we
[01:21:28] have a high society Hunter and spicy

[01:24:05] towards you in a
[01:24:06] sandstorm you have to decide spicy what
[01:24:09] would you like to do and remember if you

[01:24:36] you're going to have three Raiders in
[01:24:37] front of you but they all are going to
[01:24:39] be 13 why do you cover it like that so
[01:24:42] it doesn't fall off cuz they've been
[01:24:44] bump they yeah they've been bumping out
[01:24:45] a little bit so you my friend got a look
[01:24:49] at that you got a 11 which plus your six
[01:24:52] from your your flamethrower works but
[01:24:53] each one of those
[01:24:54] takes two t two damage they're only 15
[01:24:57] damage there so that brings them down a
[01:24:59] little bit and each one of them though

[01:25:01] pistols and stuff they need 13 to hit

[01:45:27] agility maybe a rad removal I forgot
[01:45:31] about that
[01:45:32] one let's make that cuz I'm missing a
[01:45:34] lot of my images so I have to make some
[01:45:35] of them over that's okay
[01:45:38] though we can do
[01:45:41] that we can make him
[01:45:46] over up
[01:46:02] let's see if we can get that one to work
[01:46:04] let's see if people like that
[01:46:06] one all right we'll keep going we'll try
[01:46:08] uh now with our breakes we do have I
[01:46:11] forgot about telling you guys we did we
[01:46:13] have the benjes back for those you like
[01:46:15] those no
[01:46:23] yeah that's pretty see 10 years you made
[01:46:25] a character from like 10 years ago you
[01:46:26] know what depending on what it is uh
[01:46:29] maybe we can adapt I've been trying to
[01:46:31] get some people to participate where we
[01:46:33] can um run one of I I made a large
[01:46:36] campaign it's probably 30 pages long of
[01:46:40] a story lots of different things we can
[01:46:42] do um I've been working on trying to get
[01:46:44] some of the things published just
[01:46:45] because I spent so much time making them
[01:46:47] I figured it might as well
[01:46:48] right so we'll run these yes so if you
[01:46:52] guys are interested in doing that what
[01:46:54] I'd do is try to get the campaign going
[01:46:55] we pretty much have it set up similarly
[01:46:57] like we have now probably do a long form
[01:46:59] instead of the uh up and down and we'll
[01:47:01] do a do like a stream on on YouTube
[01:47:04] where we'll just I'll be like the
[01:47:06] dungeon master we'll go through we'll
[01:47:07] play the games we'll roll for each thing
[01:47:10] uh and that type of thing like that I
[01:47:11] don't know if that's intriguing to you
[01:47:13] guys we can um if you like that make
[01:47:16] sure you jump in to the Discord Channel
[01:47:17] and talk to me about that if you're
[01:47:19] interested I know I've said a couple
[01:47:20] times that we're trying to do it but now
[01:47:21] I finally get things rolling a little
[01:47:23] bit better where we don't have as many
[01:47:24] problems at the moment so we'll
[01:47:29] see but we'll do this
[01:47:32] actually let's
[01:47:34] [Music]
[01:47:35] see yeah that way we can do uh like
[01:47:38] pretty much you know you'd start out the
[01:47:39] whole thing would be you know be like a
[01:47:41] half hour an hour long depending on how
[01:47:43] long we plan on doing it and uh go from
[01:47:46] there that way we can get some you know
[01:47:47] anybody that ever wants to jump in I was
[01:47:49] trying to do it as where
[01:47:51] um somebody had made the common about do
[01:47:53] memberships for YouTube where the people
[01:47:55] that don't want to come and buy packs or
[01:47:58] singles all the time sometimes people
[01:47:59] don't necessarily want to do that they
[01:48:01] just want to play the adventure
[01:48:02] game that's
[01:48:05] loud so might as
[01:48:07] well um give him the option to and
[01:48:11] that's why I made the YouTube
[01:48:12] memberships it kind of gives the the
[01:48:13] ability to do
[01:48:15] that it's like gives you time to play
[01:48:19] some adventuring all the time if you'd
[01:48:21] like we can kind of like schedule things
[01:48:24] regularly I wondered what was going on
[01:48:27] the music somehow shut
[01:48:44] off wondering why I was quiet there

[02:12:19] pogs here we go so that's what it is
[02:12:25] there it in a corner talking about Metal
[02:12:28] somewhere so we'll throw some more
[02:12:30] weapons out there that was a good
[02:12:33] natural 20 very rarely does that
[02:12:36] happen those are fun I know they were a
[02:12:38] good time I found a bunch of them online
[02:12:40] and I was like you know what screw it I
[02:12:41] bought them dirt cheat to play with the
[02:12:43] game here and uh it was kind was kind of
[02:12:46] fun let's go uh let's throw the uh in a
[02:12:50] safe Haven maybe somebody needs to try
[02:12:52] out a safe haven with some of these
[02:12:55] singles somebody told me they were
[02:12:57] coming back recently I'm like all right
[02:12:59] if you say so how do you win well you're
[02:13:03] you never win in the adventure it's uh
[02:13:05] in Wasteland it's you continue on you
[02:13:06] don't die that's what happens um or
[02:13:10] every now and again we'll do like a boss
[02:13:12] raid say for instance it's a it's a
[02:13:14] battle for survival but every now and
[02:13:17] again we'll do something like a boss
[02:13:18] raid sometimes people join in we'll do
[02:13:20] this where we'll get six people together
[02:13:21] in a raid we do a collector booster pack
[02:13:23] break and we open all them up we do a
[02:13:25] collector booster break if you read what
[02:13:26] the directions are there so we do like a
[02:13:28] six spots and then you guys get to uh go
[02:13:31] do a little raid through somewhere maybe
[02:13:33] it's going to be through a small
[02:13:36] town and you encounter something at the
[02:13:39] end maybe it's a
[02:13:41] uh a souped up mutant that you find at
[02:13:43] the end of the town and you all have to
[02:13:44] battle it he's going to send some
[02:13:45] minions toward
[02:13:47] you I don't know
[02:13:52] Ice
[02:13:54] Nine yes so you just want to survive
[02:13:56] Neil that's what the whole point is you
[02:13:58] need to survive the
[02:14:00] Wasteland so maybe you need some health
[02:14:03] or maybe you need a perk or some kind
[02:14:06] that would be what comes out in this one
[02:14:08] so I got three different boxes uh three
[02:14:10] different um currently in every single
[02:14:11] round they lose plus one on their
[02:14:14] health so Neil's deals let me put you

[02:14:19] have some radiation poisoning
[02:14:22] uh a rataway there that you got that'll
[02:14:25] help you because you all of a sudden you
[02:14:28] see when you're in there wanding
[02:14:31] around there is a bunch of a a bunch of
[02:14:35] cockroaches that coming flying toward
[02:14:38] you do you want to hide or you want to
[02:14:40] run away do you want to
[02:14:43] attack it's up to you what you want to
[02:14:46] do Neil
[02:14:49] deals I know oh that's a tough one it's
[02:14:53] a lot of cockroaches oh that's not the
[02:14:55] right one it's a lot of cockroaches
[02:14:56] coming towards it's a
[02:14:58] swarm how many attacked well it looks
[02:15:01] like uh you might have one coming
[02:15:03] towards you right now but you don't know
[02:15:05] because if you start shooting more might
[02:15:07] come towards you you know you're not
[02:15:09] really
[02:15:13] sure yeah Aussie Osborne and cockroaches
[02:15:16] let's hide I think that's a good idea my

[02:15:21] find a building in that town and you
[02:15:25] hide inside
[02:15:26] it cockroaches that swarm goes by and
[02:15:30] you're that was a smart one because
[02:15:31] there were some other things that were
[02:15:32] out there and they just ate them they're
[02:15:34] gone you're looking out through the
[02:15:35] window going wow that was a good time
[02:15:37] good time to hide and now by eating some
[02:15:39] of those things you found a couple of uh
[02:15:43] pogs left over you got four more pogs
[02:15:46] that were left over that you found on
[02:15:47] the ground once that swarm went by and
[02:15:49] you found out and you went started to
[02:15:51] scavenge all the things they
[02:15:54] ate so you got four more pogs my
[02:15:57] friend you're now up to 18 pogs that
[02:16:00] means you can have some things to trade
[02:16:02] maybe you need to go to a uh a safe

[02:20:23] missed we'll go after the weapons box
[02:20:28] yeah know you can wait it's going to be
[02:20:31] a minus one each time but eventually
[02:20:32] it's going to end up being more and you
[02:20:33] might end up getting sicker all right
[02:20:36] let's wait that's fine
[02:20:39] yeah who knows how sick you'll get oh
[02:20:42] that wasn't supposed to be H whatever it
[02:20:43] went a dollar we'll go to a dollar this
[02:20:45] time I don't know why it starts at it

[02:21:14] let me get you your
[02:21:17] golden there you go my friend
[02:21:25] so the three-pack deal saves me doing
[02:21:28] each individual purchase getting a fee
[02:21:30] taken out so I pretty much I give you
[02:21:33] discounted based off of that so say uh
[02:21:36] depending on some of them they are like
[02:21:37] a dollar off some of them are2 to$ three
[02:21:38] doll off if you get three of them it
[02:21:39] depends on which ones you going with and
[02:21:41] that's why we do the three packs like
[02:21:42] that because I I if it gets if you get
[02:21:44] three of them it helps me not have to
[02:21:46] pay so many fees so I throw the discount
[02:21:47] to

[02:31:02] um you will also have for your ammo
[02:31:07] you're going to get rid of all the ammo
[02:31:08] with it the 45 rounds because you have a
[02:31:10] sword a plasma rifle pistol ammo and a
[02:31:12] laser so for ammo the only thing you
[02:31:13] really need would be the laser Gap cuz
[02:31:15] you're down to uh five with that one
[02:31:19] which is only one
[02:31:23] shot so I guess I say you going to go
[02:31:28] that La botomy dick that's pretty
[02:31:31] funny that's that's
[02:31:34] cool you do that's what I'm saying you
[02:31:38] you want you want to get what on your
[02:31:39] ARS but you have 45 rounds of ammo too
[02:31:41] do you want to get rid of any of that is
[02:31:42] all I was
[02:31:44] asking do you want anything in return
[02:31:46] yourself like laser ammo the Gat ammo or
[02:31:50] you know the alien G ammo some plasma
[02:31:51] rifle ammo pistol ammo or anything like
[02:31:56] that g ammo all right that will be to
[02:31:59] bring your laser Gap we'll call that
[02:32:03] 20 for
[02:32:06] um 50
[02:32:09] rounds which will get you 10 shots does
[02:32:11] that sound
[02:32:14] good all right 10 shots on that
[02:32:17] one and that leaves you
[02:32:22] with you did the that that so that
[02:32:26] leaves you with
[02:32:27] 15 extra
[02:32:30] rounds so you go to 75 for your pogs
[02:32:33] there you

[02:33:17] everyone bask sorry yeah so the three
[02:33:20] pack deal the way that we do that is if
[02:33:22] you get three packs the way that I'm
[02:33:23] able to do it is because um Shopify
[02:33:25] charges me per order uh a fee instead of
[02:33:29] taking that fee as my money I end up
[02:33:31] discounting it and giving it to you guys
[02:33:32] as a discount so I take like anywhere
[02:33:34] from $1 to $3 off depending on what
[02:33:36] packs you get and that's why there's a
[02:33:38] three-pack deal that's why I like to say
[02:33:41] that because it helps with um if I don't
[02:33:43] have to pay the fee I figured I might as
[02:33:44] well give that savings on to you guys

Imagine a modern poltical party. 

Imagine that all you know about it is the following:   

It champions rights for state sponsored schools over the rights of the parents on behalf of their own children.  

It promotes equality of outcome over a level playing field.

It is concerned that unfeterred speech is a threat to the safety of the population.

It supports candidates chosen by party leaders rather than the people via primary elections.

It celebrates choices for irreversable self-sterilization via reproductive surgical mutilation within the K-12 curriculum.

It does not want people to have to show ID to vote.

Q: To which political parties is this unspecified party most similar worldwide and throughout history?

The characteristics of the political party you describe align with elements seen in various political movements across history and in different parts of the world. While no single party fully embodies all of these traits, several aspects resemble the ideologies of specific parties or regimes:

1. **State control over education** – This suggests a preference for centralized authority over individual rights, often seen in authoritarian or collectivist regimes. For example, **totalitarian states** like the Soviet Union and Communist China heavily controlled education, aiming to align it with state ideology. 

2. **Equality of outcome over equality of opportunity** – This concept has roots in socialist and communist ideologies, where the state seeks to engineer societal outcomes to ensure everyone ends up in similar positions economically or socially. Examples include the policies of the Soviet Union, Maoist China, and even some Western socialist parties today.

3. **Censorship for public safety** – Many authoritarian regimes have justified limitations on free speech for the "greater good" or to protect society. Historical examples include Nazi Germany, Communist East Germany, and contemporary China, where state control over expression is justified by the perceived threat of dissent.

4. **Party leaders choosing candidates** – In some one-party or dominant-party states, like those under **authoritarian rule**, leaders choose candidates rather than allowing free, competitive primaries. This has been true in historical fascist and communist states, such as the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany.

5. **Promotion of irreversible medical procedures in the K-12 curriculum** – While modern debates over gender identity and medical interventions are relatively recent, this aspect aligns with more radical progressive movements in some Western countries, particularly parts of Europe and North America, where progressive left-wing parties advocate for such policies in educational settings.

6. **Opposition to voter ID laws** – In contemporary politics, particularly in the United States, opposition to voter ID requirements is most often associated with progressive or left-leaning parties, such as the **Democratic Party**. These parties argue that ID laws may suppress voter turnout, especially among minorities.

### Most Similar Parties:

1. **Communist and Socialist Parties (Historical and Contemporary)** – These parties have historically promoted equality of outcome, state control over various aspects of life, and restrictions on free speech for the sake of public order or ideological purity. Examples include the **Soviet Union’s Communist Party**, **China’s Communist Party**, and other socialist movements.

2. **Fascist Regimes (e.g., Nazi Germany)** – While typically seen as far-right, fascist regimes have centralized control over education, restricted free speech, and often manipulated electoral processes to maintain power. However, they generally did not promote equality of outcome or progressive social policies, so this comparison has limitations.

3. **Modern Progressive Left Movements** – In parts of Europe and North America, particularly within the **Democratic Party** in the U.S., elements like opposition to voter ID, advocacy for certain social policies (e.g., gender-related surgeries), and concerns about unfettered free speech are present, although these movements generally promote equality of opportunity rather than a strict equality of outcome.

### Conclusion:
This hypothetical party shares similarities with both historical authoritarian regimes (fascist, socialist, and communist) and some elements of modern progressive movements, particularly on social issues. However, no single party or movement exactly mirrors all the traits described.

The political party you describe reflects a mixture of characteristics seen in both historical authoritarian regimes and some modern progressive movements, with distinct elements of central control, restricted freedoms, and a focus on outcomes over individual rights.

1. **State Control over Education**: The emphasis on state-sponsored schools overriding parental rights resembles systems in authoritarian regimes, such as the former Soviet Union or China, where education was a tool for indoctrination and control. These systems sought to align the youth’s values with state ideologies, diminishing parental influence. In modern times, certain political divides exist in places like the U.S., where Democrats generally support greater government oversight of education, while Republicans favor parental control【10†source】.

2. **Equality of Outcome**: This aspect is most closely associated with **socialist and communist ideologies**, where the focus is on ensuring that everyone ends up with the same material conditions, as seen in the policies of countries like the Soviet Union and Maoist China. Equality of outcome is also a theme in contemporary debates within left-leaning political movements that advocate for policies designed to reduce economic inequality【10†source】.

3. **Censorship for Public Safety**: Authoritarian regimes throughout history have justified restricting free speech to maintain public safety or social order. Nazi Germany, Communist China, and the Soviet Union are examples where censorship was widely used to suppress dissent. Today, concerns about the limits of free speech for public safety are often debated, especially by progressive movements advocating against hate speech and misinformation, though this is a controversial topic in democratic societies【10†source】【12†source】.

4. **Leadership Control over Elections**: The idea of party leaders selecting candidates rather than relying on primary elections is typical of authoritarian political systems, such as one-party states like China or the Soviet Union. In these systems, political elites have more control over who can run for office, with minimal input from the general population【11†source】.

5. **Promotion of Irreversible Medical Procedures for Minors**: Policies promoting gender-affirming medical treatments within K-12 education have sparked debates in modern Western democracies. Progressive parties, especially in the U.S. and Europe, have supported access to gender-affirming healthcare for minors, while more conservative factions push back, viewing this as an overreach of the state into personal and family matters【10†source】.

6. **Opposition to Voter ID**: Opposition to voter ID laws is a key issue for progressive parties, particularly in the U.S., where Democrats argue that such laws disproportionately suppress the votes of minorities and disadvantaged groups. This position is often seen as promoting greater access to voting, though critics argue it undermines election security【11†source】【12†source】.

### Global and Historical Parallels:
- **Communist Parties** in the Soviet Union and China combined state control of education, equality of outcome, and censorship, alongside party leadership selecting candidates.
- **Fascist Regimes** like Nazi Germany also controlled education and censored speech, though their focus was more on nationalistic outcomes than socialist equality.
- **Modern Progressive Movements**, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, share some traits, such as support for certain social policies (e.g., gender surgeries) and opposition to voter ID laws.

In conclusion, this fictional party resembles a mix of **authoritarian socialist regimes** with some elements of **modern progressive** social policies, particularly in education and voting rights.

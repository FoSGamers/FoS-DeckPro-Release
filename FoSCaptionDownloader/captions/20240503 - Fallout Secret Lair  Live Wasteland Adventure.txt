[00:28:12] nonfoil there we go we're gonna open
[00:28:14] these up and see what's here are we G to
[00:28:16] see what we get
[00:28:22] huh most of the time we open them rip it
[00:28:24] all right let's get some good stuff
[00:28:28] they are awesome cards they are they
[00:28:30] they get they're just a special set and
[00:28:32] they're just like a special set of cards
[00:28:33] that have um special art on them
[00:28:35] generally and then for some reason with
[00:28:38] the uh with the Fallout ones they
[00:28:40] decided to do a little thing where they
[00:28:41] give a potential of getting a really
[00:28:43] high value card in it and that's why a
[00:28:45] lot of people are jumping in the secret
[00:28:46] layer things that we got here now with
[00:28:48] this secret layer do you want me to give
[00:28:49] you the box or would you like to keep
[00:28:50] that box
[00:28:52] yourself and then also you want me to
[00:28:54] open this up and um
[00:28:58] have it
[00:28:59] all uh I'll open it up like I've been
[00:29:01] doing and put it all in sleeves we've
[00:29:03] seen these all already I'm guessing
[00:29:06] that's what you want me to do right or
[00:29:07] do you just want me to flip it around
[00:29:08] and show you what's
[00:29:14] there I just don't want to like some
[00:29:16] people like me to just keep it in the
[00:29:17] package and ship it and others like me
[00:29:19] to put it in the top loaders that's the
[00:29:20] only reason I
[00:29:22] ask all right cool that's what I was I
[00:29:24] just before I cut it open I wanted to
[00:29:26] check that because some people like to
[00:29:28] have it all together like that yep see

[00:44:41] here nice protected for your
[00:44:49] shipping uh I might let me double
[00:44:53] check because I was online and uh that's
[00:44:55] what the prices were on on
[00:44:58] TCG but for whatever reason they did
[00:45:01] have
[00:45:04] um I was going with the TCG price so
[00:45:06] I'll double check on
[00:45:18] that but I believe TCG pricing had him
[00:45:21] that way for some
[00:45:24] reason well I will double check
[00:45:27] anyways let me put this one in there
[00:45:30] because that is for someone else that is
[00:45:32] the giveaway let me get this over
[00:45:40] here
[00:45:42] yeah yeah it's uh I don't I didn't
[00:45:44] understand it either I just kind of was
[00:45:46] going with what was available and what
[00:45:48] was around you know what they had
[00:45:49] written
[00:45:51] down
[00:45:53] high hill Oh my God
[00:45:57] Hill
[00:45:59] hulkk I like I was I was calling you
[00:46:01] Hulk this entire
[00:46:03] time God I need to write people's names
[00:46:06] down or a read slower maybe Hulk is
[00:46:09] better though I'm gonna go with Hulk I
[00:46:11] like Hulk
[00:46:17] better yeah the market price is really
[00:46:19] weird on the
[00:46:21] nonfoil sounds a bit cooler you like
[00:46:23] Hulk better all right well I've been
[00:46:25] calling you Hulk this entire time
[00:46:27] because I missed the uh I don't know why
[00:46:29] that's what I was calling Hulk for there
[00:46:31] you go there you
[00:46:34] go and then ice here's our little giby
[00:46:37] for
[00:46:41] [Music]
[00:46:46] you I didn't either until I was just
[00:46:48] read your name out like oh I've been
[00:46:50] calling him Hulk the last like five
[00:46:52] minutes here
[00:46:57] no problem ice yeah let me check but I
[00:46:59] do believe those are are rather accurate
[00:47:01] if I remember
[00:47:02] right I think
[00:47:16] um yeah I think that is
[00:47:20] accurate we're looking at the uh you
[00:47:23] saying
[00:47:28] foil
[00:47:30] is nonfoil for what are you talking
[00:47:33] about like which
[00:47:39] one points of interest I might have the
[00:47:42] points of interest flip it's potential
[00:47:45] nonfoil points of
[00:47:48] interest let me just double
[00:47:52] check it's distinctly possible I did
[00:47:55] something like that
[00:47:58] point of Interest
[00:48:02] nonfoil point of Interest
[00:48:13] nonfoil well that looks all right and
[00:48:17] [Music]
[00:48:21] then point of Interest
[00:48:27] put him in fresh rainbow no no that is
[00:48:29] on there correctly it is on there
[00:48:31] actually you're actually right for some
[00:48:33] reason the foil is
[00:48:35] cheaper which is really weird to
[00:48:42] me really weird to me
[00:48:44] also but that's it that is
[00:48:52] correct it is correct
[00:49:06] currently they're even going up
[00:49:09] significantly because they're all not
[00:49:11] available so I mean you guys are getting
[00:49:13] really good deals on them all right now
[00:49:15] everything is actually out of stock
[00:49:16] everywhere I'm looking at them I'm like
[00:49:17] oh wow they're all out of stock prices
[00:49:20] have skyrocketed to like a lot whatever
[00:49:23] I like giving you guys deals and hanging
[00:49:25] out with you and ripping [ __ ] open
[00:49:26] personally
[00:49:27] I don't really care about that because I
[00:49:29] know what I'm doing I'm having
[00:49:31] fun yeah dude it's like a like a, it's

[00:49:57] to see
[00:49:59] it yeah dude it's serious it's insane
[00:50:02] how much that
[00:50:07] is
[00:50:08] interesting huh well uh I was going buy
[00:50:12] market price on things so that's why I

[00:50:16] have I use the uh I use mon I use the
[00:50:19] monobox app on my phone and it does
[00:50:21] market price on things so I don't know
[00:50:23] if that's what like somebody selling it
[00:50:25] at maybe
[00:50:27] maybe you can get him at that if
[00:50:29] somebody happens to be selling him at
[00:50:31] that I don't know but there you go we

[01:24:46] Place bought a bunch of them on eBay I
[01:24:48] went on eBay and found a bunch of random
[01:24:49] cards that were cheap all over the place
[01:24:52] and bought them is really what it was it
[01:24:54] was a bunch of different random things I
[01:24:56] bought out a bunch of people just
[01:24:57] because I wanted cheap packs that were
[01:24:59] all under a dollar and that's kind of
[01:25:01] where what I did when in there's a
[01:25:03] couple of different places on eBay that
[01:25:04] has them that are relatively cheap if
[01:25:05] you want to go and look try try it out
[01:25:07] check it out you know all it is is like
[01:25:09] I said uh they had like somebody was

[01:25:23] got the pogs too same thing with the
[01:25:25] pogs I found some people sound them
[01:25:27] randomly and I bought a few of them
[01:25:29] through different people to be able to
[01:25:30] have the accumulate the amount that we
[01:25:32] had on the show to use in the games
[01:25:34] we're going to do a little bit of this
[01:25:35] here if somebody wants
[01:25:39] to we're g to put this on
[01:25:42] for

[01:25:51] problem at all I appreciate you tu we
[01:25:54] love playing our games with all of you
[01:25:56] guys and having fun so whenever you get
[01:25:57] to come in and hang out with us it's fun
[01:25:59] that we get to do that like I do have
[01:26:01] another one too two buck just so you're
[01:26:03] aware not many people are jumping in on
[01:26:05] this one because it's doesn't have the
[01:26:06] same animations but people that like D
[01:26:08] and D stuff it's a straight out like a D
[01:26:10] and D Adventure we're currently at the
[01:26:12] stage where we are we have built two of
[01:26:15] our characters and we went through some
[01:26:16] M battles and we beat a boss and right
[01:26:18] now we had cut out Xavier cut out of uh
[01:26:21] out of one of the bosses their second
[01:26:22] their third uh
[01:26:25] their third companion which happens to
[01:26:27] be like a ghoulish doctor type thing
[01:26:30] Soh that's all we had that's what I was
[01:26:32] saying like if you want to play some of
[01:26:33] that too we can do that and wander
[01:26:35] through those and we have our Dice and
[01:26:37] everything we roll to try to get through
[01:26:39] the
[01:26:40] adventure and if you watch on YouTube
[01:26:43] too I do those all the time also on
[01:26:47] YouTube you know what if anybody else
[01:26:50] wants some sorcery I had some fun
[01:26:53] opening that sorcery that was really
[01:26:54] good so I'm going to try it again see if
[01:26:56] anybody else wants to have some fun
[01:26:57] opening sorcery with
[01:27:00] me dude it's also it's just fun playing
[01:27:02] a game it makes it a little bit more fun
[01:27:04] just rather than just ripping packs the
[01:27:06] entire time and plus sometimes when
[01:27:08] things are slow it makes things a little
[01:27:10] bit more um entertaining you
[01:27:15] know that's all helps keep everything's
[01:27:18] moving you know rather than being
[01:27:19] absolutely silent you have some people
[01:27:21] that are sitting there and they're
[01:27:22] like and like
[01:27:25] they're new maybe or they've been doing
[01:27:27] it for years and they don't do anything

[01:31:54] um what is it it's Mike right oh what's
[01:31:56] his name I'm blanking on the name it's

[01:32:20] definitely turning into Peter by the way
[01:32:21] at work currently
[01:32:25] I feel like somebody has uh done
[01:32:27] something and and made it so that I am
[01:32:29] um I'm hypnotized and I have turned into
[01:32:32] Peter like I'm just flat up like yeah
[01:32:34] okay bud just tell them things nobody
[01:32:38] not not uh some people don't like it now
[01:32:40] I've got to the point where I'm like I'm
[01:32:42] pushing the way that I normally do stuff
[01:32:44] rather than trying to go the slower
[01:32:45] speed that others do it and I'm not even
[01:32:46] going my full speed yet and I can
[01:32:49] already see people getting thoroughly
[01:32:50] frustrated because they can't stay up
[01:32:52] and in the med meetings when they were
[01:32:54] like oh what is everyone doing and you
[01:32:55] know talk about what everyone's doing
[01:32:57] normally we'd say what people are doing
[01:32:59] and what you got out to and what uh you
[01:33:00] know what you're going to be going on
[01:33:01] well now they want to know what you've
[01:33:03] accomplished because the manager's there
[01:33:05] well because I'm pushing everybody I'm
[01:33:06] like I got this done I got this done I
[01:33:07] got this done and they're all like I
[01:33:08] didn't get any of that done I'm like no
[01:33:11] I don't want then maybe next time you
[01:33:12] should not complain to the
[01:33:19] boss because I was going at your speed
[01:33:21] before and that's why you guys are
[01:33:23] having a good
[01:33:25] time there's everyone on the team
[01:33:27] currently has not been at my speed we'll
[01:33:29] just put it that way I finished
[01:33:31] everything a day before or two days
[01:33:32] before everyone else I'm
[01:33:35] like what do you want me to do next like
[01:33:38] I've been going at EUR speed for the uh
[01:33:40] for the last three years because I was
[01:33:41] told to by the directors and also that
[01:33:44] was a person that was a couple couple
[01:33:45] spots down from a president was like the
[01:33:47] um the when I was going when I first got
[01:33:50] hired my manager told me I needed to
[01:33:52] slow down and I did slow down a little
[01:33:54] bit but I guess I didn't slow down
[01:33:56] enough because one of the directors
[01:33:57] ended up when I had a conversation you
[01:33:58] know like one-on-one with a director
[01:34:00] they're like hey uh I like they were
[01:34:01] like hey you're stressing out some of
[01:34:03] the uh the lawyers pushing a lot of
[01:34:04] those changes on them so quickly I'm
[01:34:06] like well that's what they're asking for
[01:34:08] right like yeah well we just need to not
[01:34:11] have them as quick just do them in a
[01:34:12] little bit more of like a a better
[01:34:14] release schedule
[01:34:17] like
[01:34:20] okay just be so like I had to go
[01:34:23] everybody else's
[01:34:25] speed but now they want to go faster
[01:34:27] speed they can't keep up with mine at
[01:34:30] the moment but I'll keep going we'll see
[01:34:32] what
[01:34:35] happens we'll see what happens I'm
[01:34:37] having fun currently though I think this
[01:34:38] is
[01:34:40] entertaining because this is how I used
[01:34:42] this how I work with everything I always
[01:34:44] push really hard when it's something
[01:34:46] that's my own thing I'm actually going
[01:34:48] to do this let's put out a commander
[01:34:50] masters with a random one here see if we
[01:34:52] can get that
[01:34:55] well I think it's because they have so
[01:34:56] much info all the time that they get
[01:34:59] overloaded when I send them four things
[01:35:01] at once and they're used to getting one
[01:35:07] thing if that makes any sense at
[01:35:11] all hey pal Papa Lobster oh papa Lobster

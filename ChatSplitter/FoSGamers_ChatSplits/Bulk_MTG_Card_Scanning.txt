Is there a scanner for Magic the Gathering cards? Something that I would be able to put a stack of anything from like 10 to, I don't know, like a thousand cards in it and it would scan them all, whether they were in sleeves, penny sleeves, or top loader sleeves, or not sleeved at all. It would go through them and be able to scan them, know exactly what they are, and put them into like an Excel spreadsheet that I could upload to something to sell.

There are a few options for scanning and identifying Magic: The Gathering (MTG) cards in bulk, though some caveats apply, particularly regarding sleeve types and the ability to handle large stacks of cards. Here are some potential solutions:

### 1. **Dedicated Card Scanners**
   - **Fujitsu ScanSnap iX1500**: This is a high-speed document scanner that some users have adapted for scanning trading cards. It can handle stacks of cards, but might struggle with different sleeve types.
   - **Epson DS-320**: Another document scanner with good speed and quality, but similar limitations with sleeves.

### 2. **Smartphone Apps and OCR Software**
   - **Delver Lens**: An app specifically designed for identifying MTG cards using a smartphone camera. While it doesn't scan in bulk, it can quickly identify cards one at a time.
   - **MTG Scanner**: Another app that uses the camera to identify cards. Like Delver Lens, it's more suited for individual scans rather than bulk.

### 3. **Using OCR and Computer Vision Software**
   - You can set up a custom solution using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and computer vision libraries like **Tesseract** and **OpenCV** to identify cards from scanned images. This requires more technical knowledge and setup but offers flexibility.

### 4. **Professional Inventory Services**
   - Services like **TCGplayer's Collection Tracker** or **MTG Manager** can help catalog cards, though they might not support bulk scanning.

### Potential Workflow
1. **Scan Cards**: Use a document scanner to scan the cards. If you have a large collection, consider scanning them in batches.
2. **Image Processing**: Use OCR software or card identification apps to recognize each card.
3. **Data Export**: Compile the identified cards into a CSV or Excel spreadsheet.
4. **Upload**: Use the spreadsheet to upload your inventory to a marketplace like TCGplayer or Cardmarket.

### Challenges
- **Handling Sleeves**: Most document scanners might have issues with cards in different types of sleeves. Ensuring cards are consistently sleeved or unsleeved might be necessary.
- **Recognition Accuracy**: OCR and card identification software can have varying levels of accuracy, especially with non-standard fonts or damaged cards.

### Summary
While there isn't a perfect out-of-the-box solution for scanning and identifying large stacks of MTG cards in various sleeve types, combining a high-speed document scanner with OCR or dedicated card identification apps might offer a workable solution. For best results, cards should ideally be in similar conditions and sleeve types to ensure smooth scanning and accurate recognition.

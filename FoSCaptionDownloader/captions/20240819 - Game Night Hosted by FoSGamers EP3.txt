[00:30:36] mountains I'll pass yeah the bad thing
[00:30:39] is I'm not getting any lands all right
[00:30:42] so you're gonna get hit with well
[00:30:46] actually I'm
[00:30:48] gonna what abilities does your extort
[00:30:51] creature have besides uh I
[00:30:55] just when you cast a spell you may pay
[00:30:58] oh I guess when this cast a spell I
[00:31:01] guess I extorted WR
[00:31:03] huh or could I have extorted for casting
[00:31:06] him
[00:31:08] no
[00:31:09] damn so that means I go back up and I'll
[00:31:13] go back down
[00:31:14] one we'll call that even yep um but um I
[00:31:20] what is it power toughness 2
[00:31:23] two uh
[00:31:28] yeah this is just going out your face
[00:31:30] anyways take three okay I
[00:31:34] will pay one to play Hollow prevent all
[00:31:37] damage Target spell would deal this turn
[00:31:39] you gain life equal to the damage
[00:31:40] prevented this way three minus two so
[00:31:47] one
[00:31:49] okay and
[00:31:52] uh you're still getting hit by scab Clan
[00:31:56] so that is a
[00:31:59] counter and uh

[00:32:18] right there
[00:32:21] what this with the counter on it yeah
[00:32:24] enchantment okay what does it do
[00:32:28] so uh whenever a red Source eye control
[00:32:32] deals damage to a player put a quest
[00:32:33] counter on it it's the thing that
[00:32:36] doubles the damage for the rest of the
[00:32:38] turn when I remove for and sacrifice hey
[00:32:41] one white and one for revoke uh
[00:32:45] existence sorcery Exile Target artifact

[00:33:28] three damage to you prevent damage
[00:33:31] cannot be prevented and life cannot be
[00:33:32] gained so you do not gain any life from
[00:33:38] that so you okay so I don't gain life
[00:33:41] but you still take damage and I take
[00:33:42] three correct
[00:33:47] okay got lucky with that one I have to
[00:33:49] prevent damage in my uh in my hand I'll
[00:33:54] pass on that

[01:18:02] two let's try that again I got to
[01:18:05] shuffle better this
[01:18:07] time yeah I uh it had been so long since
[01:18:10] I played my deck that everything was in
[01:18:13] you know um like deck construction order
[01:18:15] so it was all One Drops two three four
[01:18:18] five six and then uh all my lands in the
[01:18:20] back I'm like yeah that's why I was
[01:18:23] sitting there shuffling the whole time
[01:18:24] because I'm like probably should Shuffle
[01:18:25] this up well I mine was like that too
[01:18:28] and I had been shuffling it up so I
[01:18:29] thought I had done a good job but I
[01:18:31] guess I did not do that good of a
[01:18:35] job so I saw a couple of lands on there
[01:18:38] I'm like oh good I'm I'm good and me as
[01:18:39] I shuffle them up all right no oh no NOP
[01:18:44] not at

[01:37:21] block the 61 and I don't even think it
[01:37:22] was going to matter but we'll try and
[01:37:24] block that one anyway somewhat so I only
[01:37:26] take what four and I um go down to
[01:37:31] three okay and no cards in hand nothing
[01:37:35] in my
[01:37:36] hand
[01:37:38] okay uh yeah so then I'm you took the
[01:37:43] one from him and then you took the three
[01:37:47] from him so you took four correct and uh
[01:37:50] yeah I moved to my my endep I him and
[01:37:54] pass the turn all righty well let's see
[01:37:56] if I get any luck here off top de
[01:38:10] here East faring
[01:38:13] farmer when East Farthing farmer enters
[01:38:15] Battlefield create a food token when you
[01:38:17] do Target creature you control gets plus
[01:38:19] one plus one until end of
[01:38:21] turn which no creatures out s
[01:38:24] so I'll create a food token again
[01:38:28] though which I will tap two to
[01:38:34] sacrifice and gain
[01:38:37] um real
[01:38:42] life and I
[01:38:44] pass I think I'm with I'm literally
[01:38:47] maybe like knocking myself out here by
[01:38:51] uh barely
[01:38:55] come on quit shaking the camera what are
[01:38:57] you doing
[01:39:01] drop all
[01:39:04] right
[01:39:07] well tap for green tap for a green tap
[01:39:11] for a green because it's an elemental
[01:39:14] it's screen's version to the ball
[01:39:15] lightning it's groundbreaker oh
[01:39:19] nice 61 with
[01:39:22] haste at the end of turn sacrifice
[01:39:26] groundbreaker I do believe you will have
[01:39:30] one uh yeah because I'll move to combat
[01:39:33] attack with the 61 attack with the one
[01:39:37] two the one two lets me bring back the
[01:39:40] sixth one so
[01:39:42] swinging
[01:39:44] 13 yep and I have only three to defend
[01:39:48] so that is
[01:39:51] it good game good game
[01:39:58] oh
[01:39:59] wait
[01:40:00] right no right to right I just have you
[01:40:04] facing the wrong way yeah yeah
[01:40:09] yeah if you flip each other's screens
[01:40:11] upside down it looks like a handshake
[01:40:14] yes it would look correct but then I
[01:40:16] can't see his board as easily got to
[01:40:18] read things upside
[01:40:21] down that two of three
[01:40:24] three that was only two of three
[01:40:29] correct so it is on to
[01:40:35] um we're gonna do Cody and I quickly and
[01:40:39] then see who WS there and then it'll be
[01:40:41] out up to house and the uh the winner
[01:40:44] Oblivion sound like our
[01:40:46] plan sure sure Cody you're still
[01:40:51] there you still up to playing if not
[01:40:54] that's right did you fall asleep again
[01:40:56] if Cody fell asleep again that's good
[01:40:57] that's fine I will let I'm here I'm here
[01:41:00] I'm up for one more I'm sorry I was in
[01:41:01] my kitchen oh no worries all right let's
[01:41:03] do uh it's you and I you and I are in
[01:41:05] the uh losers bracket here you didn't
[01:41:08] see me get smok there uh so it is um
[01:41:11] it's up to you and I and we'll see what
[01:41:12] happens I guess give me uh two minutes
[01:41:17] sounds good then the winners from this
[01:41:20] next round face off I assume correct
[01:41:25] then it'll be you no it's you and
[01:41:27] Oblivion and then um and house will be
[01:41:31] next and then then you guys and you guys
[01:41:32] will be between the two
[01:41:34] winners no no I'm saying after that
[01:41:37] round whoever wins out of that one and
[01:41:39] your guys's round uh face off
[01:41:45] right no because I just won the match
[01:41:48] between Jamie and I you won the match
[01:41:50] between Cody and you so they are playing
[01:41:55] play losers bracket exact win bracket
[01:41:59] yeah when you do oblivion's right when
[01:42:00] you do losers bracket the person who
[01:42:02] wins losers bracket can go back and win
[01:42:05] another
[01:42:06] game it's like losers bracket is to be
[01:42:08] put back into the tournament
[01:42:11] bracket yeah they face off against
[01:42:13] whoever's winning against the Winner's
[01:42:16] bracket
[01:42:18] yeah I wasn't planning on doing it that
[01:42:21] way specifically since I was only
[01:42:22] planning on doing a couple hours
[01:42:23] uh oh so then it's you two are fighting
[01:42:26] for third and fourth place correct okay
[01:42:29] that works good yep all right me uh
[01:42:34] start shuffling and Oblivion and I can
[01:42:36] just uh have a draw and we'll we'll
[01:42:39] we'll split the earn the winnings is
[01:42:41] that how that works cut the card in half
[01:42:44] correct
[01:42:46] correct there is no there are no
[01:42:49] winnings on this one specifically
[01:42:50] tonight I have something that I was on
[01:42:53] sending out though to say thank you for
[01:42:55] everybody to playing so there was
[01:42:57] something coming out there wasn't a
[01:42:58] specific winning since it wasn't a uh a
[01:43:01] big tournament does that make any sense
[01:43:04] yeah I was just teasing anyway I was
[01:43:06] gonna be sending everybody saying oh
[01:43:08] thank you for playing the next time you
[01:43:09] guys grabb something but that was about
[01:43:11] it
[01:43:14] what he's saying that he he's going to
[01:43:16] be generous and and uh send us something
[01:43:19] out next time we are in whatnot and grab
[01:43:21] an order he'll throw a little thank you
[01:43:23] in there yes oh
[01:43:25] cool it's not another stier is
[01:43:28] it what was that I got I got $30
[01:43:31] referral from friends so I'm ready
[01:43:33] buying a pack nice I was joking about uh
[01:43:37] it's not another sticker now is it well
[01:43:40] it depends on the type of sticker what
[01:43:41] are you looking
[01:43:43] for double Foss
[01:43:47] stickers he said for
[01:43:50] life I mean honestly right now I could
[01:43:52] probably cover this thing pretty
[01:43:55] well package back all right at this
[01:43:58] point at this point I have so many fo
[01:44:01] stickers that I could probably start
[01:44:02] handing them
[01:44:03] out hey do it I asked my friend hey you
[01:44:06] want a sticker he's like what what's the
[01:44:09] stream I watch that's called uh back in
[01:44:11] the day that was called Street teaming
[01:44:13] we used to do that for bands and stuff
[01:44:15] go yeah out if you want to you have
[01:44:18] friends why not
[01:44:23] I got lost in the
[01:44:26] shuffle you ready if any other metal
[01:44:29] heads are here or watching at least you
[01:44:31] didn't get lost in the
[01:44:35] static don't forget to reset your life
[01:44:38] total false oh yeah it's a Cool Pix uh
[01:44:42] b500 we bought it a couple years
[01:44:45] back you think I would get better camera
[01:44:47] quality on this than uh just using my
[01:44:51] Samsung phone that's far newer oh yeah
[01:44:54] most
[01:44:55] definitely oh wait wait far newer uh
[01:44:59] yeah this is I can't remember what
[01:45:00] you're this game out you might you might
[01:45:02] be able to resolve your sh connect to it
[01:45:04] you might actually get good camera
[01:45:06] quality you might you might we're not
[01:45:09] saying you have bad camera quality it's
[01:45:11] pretty good honestly no it works it's
[01:45:13] decent enough for what we're doing but
[01:45:15] uh you know if this would I should just
[01:45:17] monkey around with it but yeah no the
[01:45:19] reason why my camera is wobbly like this
[01:45:21] is because the way my desk set up it's
[01:45:23] terrible the mount that I have you know
[01:45:25] how it has the you know like the vice uh
[01:45:28] wheel on it so you got to move the
[01:45:30] little bar to tighten it down yep so
[01:45:35] problem is where my keyboard drawer
[01:45:37] comes out I would normally attach it
[01:45:39] right here to the actual desk but I
[01:45:42] can't spin that thing and tighten it
[01:45:45] because it goes down too far and starts
[01:45:46] hitting the um drawer so I actually have
[01:45:50] it on the drawer and so if I just move
[01:45:52] this ever so
[01:45:54] slightly then it wobbles I've got it up
[01:45:56] like kind of jammed up against the the
[01:45:59] desk so that it kind of control some of
[01:46:02] it
[01:46:03] but want roll for well it's working
[01:46:06] right now at least all right we can
[01:46:09] um roll or what do you want to do unless
[01:46:12] you want me to roll for you I'm roll on
[01:46:13] the what do you roll D20 or what I have
[01:46:16] D20 here all right I20 on the for you

[02:29:38] though I'm going to I'm still going to
[02:29:41] attack with
[02:29:43] this we're going to put it on
[02:29:47] here going attack with this also
[02:29:52] and I will put it on my
[02:29:58] um on this
[02:30:00] here for my ranging
[02:30:03] Raptors uh so it's now a five
[02:30:10] six um so that is three that is a five
[02:30:14] five from ragaman that can't be blocked
[02:30:16] and then seven from here
[02:30:21] and can my froto attack or did you have
[02:30:23] something saying he
[02:30:25] couldn't
[02:30:27] uh that was the enchantment he can
[02:30:30] attack theact you got rid of that
[02:30:32] artifact wa wait wait wait I'm so
[02:30:35] confused I thought I I thought we
[02:30:37] already went through combat no that's
[02:30:39] what I was saying I I wasn't finished I
[02:30:42] wasn't finished with
[02:30:43] the what I was doing on the combat there
[02:30:46] I didn't I just moved that one up
[02:30:47] because it went over that's what ol said
[02:30:52] did I did you do something did I make a
[02:30:54] mistake on
[02:30:55] somewhere I believe so because you said
[02:30:57] you declared your attackers with ragavan
[02:31:00] and two other people and then I yeah I
[02:31:04] asked if I could attack with him because
[02:31:05] I didn't know if I was able to because I
[02:31:07] thought you had your enchantment gone
[02:31:08] that was my fault make a mistake there I
[02:31:10] do believe I don't know I thought the
[02:31:12] enchantment was on the creature that you
[02:31:15] sacrificed okay if it was then that
[02:31:17] might have been it that might have been
[02:31:18] my mistake there from
[02:31:21] yeah cuz I remember you attacked you
[02:31:23] declared I declared and then I played my
[02:31:26] instant and then you also casted a
[02:31:29] creature so that would technically be
[02:31:30] your second main yep that's
[02:31:32] it cool I just wanted to make sure nope
[02:31:36] that was
[02:31:38] it then that's in I'm done then all
[02:31:41] right
[02:31:44] cool
[02:31:47] um discard
[02:31:51] this card yeah because of the ragon or
[02:31:54] did you already do that oh exiled the
[02:31:56] one card I need what was
[02:31:58] that uh uh pellar Sovereign it's four

[02:34:50] it too I know I exiled one of
[02:34:54] them but it was back to
[02:34:58] back all right well that was a good game
[02:35:00] there GG's I do have to hop off because
[02:35:04] I have work in the morning all right
[02:35:05] that's go all right and uh I mean it's
[02:35:06] getting late everywhere um I'm sorry
[02:35:09] house we ended up having to leave a
[02:35:10] little earlier next time for you next
[02:35:11] time when we'll end up doing with you is
[02:35:13] house I'll have you uh I'll have you be
[02:35:15] the one to start out and and run
[02:35:17] everything from the beginning sound good
[02:35:19] that way you get to get to head out have
[02:35:21] everything done
[02:35:23] first yeah however you want to do it I'm
[02:35:25] also you know if you're trying to get
[02:35:27] more people to do it and stuff I'm cool
[02:35:29] with
[02:35:30] uh um well I don't know how it works for
[02:35:33] you I don't know if you're Saturdays or
[02:35:35] Set Side specifically but in the
[02:35:37] interest of time and everything I don't
[02:35:39] know if we would need to do it on like a
[02:35:43] Saturday or Friday or something like
[02:35:44] that so that you know people can
[02:35:46] potentially be up a little later not
[02:35:47] that we see that's what I was thinking
[02:35:49] it for I was doing like uh those type of
[02:35:50] days for people to be up a little later
[02:35:52] but I was actually thinking the other
[02:35:53] thing too that we might be able to do is
[02:35:55] do like maybe like a Monday Night Magic
[02:35:56] maybe start it next week on Monday or
[02:35:58] Tuesday or something like that and do it
[02:36:00] at like 5 or 6 um eastern time that way
[02:36:04] it's kind of like a little bit after
[02:36:05] work is on some people like type thing I
[02:36:08] don't know yeah I get home six latest
[02:36:10] okay okay but yeah Mondays are free for
[02:36:13] me uh you know I'm typically Amanda and
[02:36:16] I stream on Tuesday Thursday and
[02:36:18] Saturday nights okay and I did some
[02:36:21] mornings but I haven't been for a while
[02:36:22] and you're only on in the morning so it
[02:36:24] just depends on what you're doing with
[02:36:25] the family yeah so Cody what time you
[02:36:28] are you East are you East or Central
[02:36:30] were you Easter I'm Maryland you're
[02:36:33] Maryland I thought so like I thought you
[02:36:34] said you were you're Maryland there
[02:36:35] because were there the other day I just
[02:36:37] I work like 45 minutes to an hour away
[02:36:40] depending yeah no no problem so what I
[02:36:42] was thinking was and I mean like I can
[02:36:44] even do like we can like do 6:30 or 7
[02:36:46] one of these times like just try to
[02:36:48] organize it where it's later on where
[02:36:50] more people can join and I figure that's
[02:36:52] what I'll do try to since like we have
[02:36:54] more the more people we have it'll just
[02:36:55] kind of fit the better time around it
[02:36:57] because anytime in the afternoon is fine
[02:36:58] for me for the most part I just can't be
[02:37:00] up until like you know midnight all the
[02:37:03] time that's it right yeah understandable
[02:37:07] also F I would have caught you if you
[02:37:10] casted it but you almost casted the same
[02:37:12] creature you had on the battlefield that
[02:37:13] was a legendary creature you gota be
[02:37:15] careful with that because of the
[02:37:17] legendary rule I had a car that allowed
[02:37:19] owed me to not have a legendary Rule and
[02:37:21] that's why I said I can't do that I
[02:37:26] see
[02:37:27] interesting yes there's like I I have to
[02:37:30] find where it is but I have a c that
[02:37:31] says uh you can ignore the legendary
[02:37:35] rule I can't remember which one it is
[02:37:37] wow that's that's kind of
[02:37:40] beasty yeah where is
[02:37:44] it anyways yeah it's one of the cards in
[02:37:46] this one that I popped in there and I
[02:37:48] was like oh I can play this like no I
[02:37:49] don't had that one out
[02:37:51] yet that's what like it was going to
[02:37:53] change a little bit of the game when
[02:37:55] then I was no [ __ ] I can't do
[02:37:58] that like that's why I was like oh wait
[02:38:00] a minute no no never mind okay because
[02:38:03] it changed how I was like like every now
[02:38:04] and again like I'm still getting used to
[02:38:06] playing the modern where you can't do
[02:38:08] certain things and I'm like or like
[02:38:10] certain ones and I'm like oh I can play
[02:38:11] this rule I can play that rule I'm still
[02:38:12] getting used to it because I only play

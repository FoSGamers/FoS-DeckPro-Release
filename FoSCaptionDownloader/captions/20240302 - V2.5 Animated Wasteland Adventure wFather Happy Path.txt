[00:05:49] they'll find some good ones for
[00:05:51] you the lucky ones this
[00:05:55] morning let's start this morning with
[00:05:57] something like this so you can get you
[00:05:59] know what we're really going to do this
[00:06:00] we're really going to do that we're only
[00:06:02] going to do that to start this morning
[00:06:04] for two
[00:06:05] stength I know it should be fun you know
[00:06:08] every time your first one is you always
[00:06:09] have a good time in your first one I'll
[00:06:11] admit that that is always nice to do uh
[00:06:13] and get a little excitement out on it
[00:06:14] and then once you get through that you
[00:06:16] find out some of the bugs and Kinks and
[00:06:18] all those things and you start working
[00:06:19] them out you're like oh I can do this
[00:06:20] better then you have some fun and and
[00:06:23] then for me I have got a I got some boys
[00:06:25] that uh give me some ideas because
[00:06:27] they're like oh do this do this we see
[00:06:28] people do this can you do this like all
[00:06:31] right I'll try it and that's what I'm
[00:06:33] here doing cuz they they want to have
[00:06:35] fun and that's kind of what we do we
[00:06:36] kind to have fun we're going to put
[00:06:38] these up
[00:06:39] here for a little bit if you want these
[00:06:44] this is what they go
[00:06:46] for you have your packs you can choose
[00:06:49] if you want your own character's
[00:06:52] strength you do not not mean me doing it
[00:06:54] you guys can do that I just pick it
[00:06:57] randomly for you right now this one's
[00:06:59] going to going to give you two for your
[00:07:00] character strength that you see right
[00:07:02] here now I need to I need to adjust the
[00:07:04] camera angle a little bit there there we
[00:07:08] go I think that's going to be
[00:07:10] better
[00:07:13] so step out of the way cuz she doesn't
[00:07:16] want to be seen on camera not right now
[00:07:18] not right now she's not made herself
[00:07:20] ready and I believe she might even be
[00:07:21] able to be
[00:07:23] seen I'm pretty sure you were seen
[00:07:28] there
[00:07:32] together finally nice hey dude say the
[00:07:35] first ones are a mess the first ones are
[00:07:37] a mess we'll put those back and guys see
[00:07:41] everybody um we I could do pre-sale like
[00:07:45] others on my
[00:07:48] um on my packs
[00:07:53] of Fallout that are coming in here but I
[00:07:58] made a decision not to
[00:08:00] some others wanted to do it I decided
[00:08:02] not to because um I felt
[00:08:05] that I wanted to make sure I have them
[00:08:07] in hand before I start doing it they
[00:08:09] might have them in hand and that's why
[00:08:10] they're doing it so that's why that's I
[00:08:12] know some people have them already and
[00:08:14] I'm like oh wow I I don't understand how
[00:08:16] you got them but as you
[00:08:17] notice they literally only have two
[00:08:20] packs two two
[00:08:22] boxes the most I've seen anyone have on
[00:08:24] a stream so far is two boxes which is
[00:08:27] nuts which means I may have more than
[00:08:31] them that's
[00:08:34] intriguing if things happen to show
[00:08:37] up hey myel how you
[00:08:40] doing if everything does show up within
[00:08:43] the time period I've ordered them for
[00:08:45] hopefully by the 11th is the latest that
[00:08:47] something supposed to be here cuz I did
[00:08:49] order it from
[00:08:50] overseas that's the only thing that took
[00:08:52] a little while and the shipping was a
[00:08:54] little expensive so but we'll see we'll

[00:20:44] them in hand before I did it or I opened
[00:20:48] anything
[00:20:50] so I decided to uh wait until they were
[00:20:55] in hand before I did that that's why I
[00:20:57] have not done anything with the

[00:21:00] started yet so that's what I'm going
[00:21:02] with here oh that was not supposed to be

[00:21:21] through Dom United I do not have any Dom
[00:21:25] United h that I can think
[00:21:30] of don't have any Dom United but I
[00:21:33] actually have been looking to buy some
[00:21:34] more stocks so if you guys have ideas
[00:21:37] let me know is it good though
[00:21:41] um you can get some good things in it it
[00:21:44] depends on what you go with like with
[00:21:45] some of the collector boosters I've had
[00:21:47] um I've gotten some pretty good cards
[00:21:49] out of the collector boosters um and the
[00:21:51] set boosters not so bad I mean I don't
[00:21:53] think I don't think there was much out
[00:21:54] of I don't think I actually had sets I
[00:21:56] think it was drafts that I was able to
[00:21:57] get but um they weren't great but they
[00:22:00] weren't bad if that makes sense um it
[00:22:03] was either you got something good or you
[00:22:05] didn't that was the only problem with it
[00:22:06] it reminded me of an older version of
[00:22:08] murders in a way that just overprinted

[00:46:58] big giveaway person because I do
[00:47:00] giveaways to the people that purchase in
[00:47:03] a way by giving them uh kind of their
[00:47:06] game when they jump in you can possibly
[00:47:09] get a free pack every single time you
[00:47:11] play with us which is why I like doing
[00:47:14] that because it's kind of like um buyers
[00:47:16] giveaways in a way where only the buyer
[00:47:19] gets something because that's the way
[00:47:20] you get into it or the only the buyer
[00:47:22] has the chance of getting something did
[00:47:24] this not run Le all right let's see
[00:47:28] what's going on here why did that not

[00:47:37] strength on your adventure through your
[00:47:40] Wasteland maybe you're going to
[00:47:43] be a character
[00:47:46] .96 maybe you're going to be a strong
[00:47:49] human wanding through this Wasteland
[00:47:52] kchamp yeah maybe you're going to be
[00:47:58] a detective maybe you like to be a
[00:48:00] detective with your chance to get a free
[00:48:03] pack of
[00:48:04] cards that's what you do when you play
[00:48:06] the games here we don't get we give you
[00:48:09] good
[00:48:10] deals we're a lot of times I'm either
[00:48:13] breaking
[00:48:14] even possibly losing last couple days
[00:48:17] I've been losing out when you guys been
[00:48:19] hitting big maybe we can keep that going
[00:48:23] where you guys keep hitting big and on
[00:48:25] the one going on well I might need to
[00:48:26] adjust how the game goes but luckily I
[00:48:29] already have that in the works for what
[00:48:31] we got going on we got it's not going to
[00:48:34] be an adjustment as much as it's going
[00:48:36] to be an
[00:48:37] [Music]
[00:48:39] addition we're going to
[00:48:42] do these random packs right
[00:48:45] now for those that want them to strength
[00:48:49] in your adventure through the
[00:48:50] Wasteland K champ no one is hanging out
[00:48:53] with me anymore pretty much by myself
[00:48:55] but that's okay we don't mind hanging

[00:51:37] opening and pre-selling Fallout stuff
[00:51:40] with
[00:51:41] the you know just when because I didn't
[00:51:44] go to Comic the con to get a bunch of
[00:51:46] singles so I decided not to pre-sell any
[00:51:48] of them I felt that was not my deal even
[00:51:50] though I have enough coming in to do
[00:51:53] some um I actually end up having a
[00:51:55] little bit more more than others on
[00:51:56] release day but I don't know if they're
[00:51:57] going to get more that's really what
[00:51:58] happens if they get a lot more then um
[00:52:01] maybe not but if this is all everyone
[00:52:03] gets for a little while then I might
[00:52:06] actually have the same amount as others
[00:52:08] if not more which will be kind of cool
[00:52:11] kind of cool so let's see what happens
[00:52:13] here because I'm not doing my thing like

[01:14:56] had it in there at the old price before
[01:14:58] it did not update for some

[01:44:42] you really want Lord of the
[01:44:43] Rings I thought I had one box for the

[01:44:48] had two but I don't know we're going to
[01:44:49] keep this over here this is my family
[01:44:50] one I don't know if I really want to get
[01:44:51] rid of that cuz we always keep one from
[01:44:53] the family and we and my children pick
[01:44:55] it and when they pick it they always
[01:44:57] pick the one with good luck and they
[01:44:58] picked out the last one we got a bunch
[01:45:00] of we got two one rings out so I don't

[01:45:06] though if you guys really want me to put
[01:45:07] Lord of the Rings back out there I could
[01:45:10] probably do it I could probably do it
[01:45:13] but here we go Let's do let's do this
[01:45:17] actually let's do this
[01:45:21] who wants to
[01:45:26] do
[01:45:29] this who wants to do this try their luck
[01:45:34] with the missile
[01:45:36] launch see if you are going to be lucky
[01:45:39] enough to take out a
[01:45:43] satellite up in Sky get yourself a pack
[01:45:47] of cards on top of the Big Blue Book
[01:45:51] spin where the big blue book we do games
[01:45:54] here that's why we have a bunch of
[01:45:55] different games that we do here the Big
[01:45:56] Blue Book spin that the ceiling is still
[01:45:58] in there that's why I've not I was going
[01:46:00] to take it and and take it down but
[01:46:02] because the ceiling is still in there
[01:46:04] I'm going to leave it out until the
[01:46:05] ceiling is pulled that's really what I'm
[01:46:07] going to do right now I'm leaving that
[01:46:09] there until the ceiling is pulled and so
[01:46:12] far there's still blank spots and every
[01:46:14] blank spot is three packs of set
[01:46:17] boosters um a command Masters set
[01:46:22] booster or a
[01:46:26] uh modern Horizon with another like
[01:46:30] draft those are what we're giving you
[01:46:32] options for if you get a blank spot when
[01:46:35] you have to run through the Wasteland I
[01:46:37] mean uh in that blue b Big Blue
[01:46:39] Book and this guys is how it is here so
[01:46:43] there's actually been two more ceilings
[01:46:46] have been pulled I mean floors have been
[01:46:47] pulled out so there are only I think 12
[01:46:51] floors left I think it's actually less
[01:46:53] than
[01:46:54] that but anyways you have our big blue
[01:46:57] book here these are everything you get
[01:46:59] in here maybe you're going to get that
[01:47:00] force of negation the pack negation and
[01:47:02] everybody lives now these are all in
[01:47:04] here they're all numbered on the spin
[01:47:06] you spin the wheel and say you're a
[01:47:08] person that gets the 10 well that's okay

[01:47:12] of cards you get a choice of any
[01:47:17] one of these
[01:47:21] packs of cards all right if you happen
[01:47:23] to hit one that is $10 or less that's
[01:47:25] okay though because it's $10 less say
[01:47:28] you happen to hit one that is like our
[01:47:31] tree beard 's events which is $5 or less
[01:47:34] well you

[01:47:37] these two of these if you would like or
[01:47:40] and or you could
[01:47:47] do any one of these
[01:47:52] plus one of those it is your choice how
[01:47:56] you go when you play our game

[01:48:45] Gloucester Massachusetts it was on the
[01:48:48] Main Street side I was a side of the
[01:48:50] Main Street downtown you would go to
[01:48:53] Main Street You' get dropped off by Mom
[01:48:54] on Main Street and you could walk over

[01:49:02] would pick up maybe a pack of your magic
[01:49:04] cards to add into it that's like a a
[01:49:06] core memory of mine growing up as a
[01:49:09] child so you know what being a core
[01:49:12] memory let's put one out there right now
[01:49:15] let's put a core memory out there right
[01:49:18] now and we're going to do a like this
[01:49:20] we're going to start you out with three
[01:49:22] strength on your adventure through the
[01:49:25] Wasteland here all
[01:49:29] right I'd buy magic and crazy bones you
[01:49:32] know what I didn't I don't remember
[01:49:34] crazy bones trying to think of that one
[01:49:37] I used to buy baseball and basketball
[01:49:39] cards um I used to get hockey all the
[01:49:41] time but as a hockey player um but uh
[01:49:44] one of my parent so I found something
[01:49:46] out and I don't know my dad's dead and
[01:49:48] he can't he can't refute this I don't I
[01:49:50] know if my mom's lying or not and trying
[01:49:51] to make herself look good but I was not
[01:49:54] allowed to I was really good at hockey
[01:49:55] when I was grown up I was uh like 10
[01:49:57] years old 11 years old and I was playing
[01:49:59] with like the 14 and 15 year olds cuz I
[01:50:01] could just smoke them um and then when I
[01:50:03] got to 12 and 13 the 12 and 13 when I
[01:50:06] was 12 I was playing with like the
[01:50:07] 16-year- olds which I was still doing
[01:50:09] really good but the problem was um back
[01:50:12] in that time frame that was a kid that
[01:50:14] hit a goalpost uh if anybody remembers
[01:50:16] that from Boston
[01:50:18] University um there was a uh uh uh I
[01:50:22] think he was a right wing which was the
[01:50:23] position I played he uh got checked and
[01:50:27] he hit the goal post and got
[01:50:29] paralyzed and obviously could not play
[01:50:31] hockey anymore well at that point I was
[01:50:34] told I'm no longer allowed to play
[01:50:35] hockey myself these three packs if you
[01:50:37] want them jump in on it and that's going
[01:50:40] to get you three strength on your
[01:50:41] adventure through the
[01:50:42] Wasteland well I found out the other day
[01:50:44] my mom said I always thought it was her
[01:50:46] that told me I wasn't allowed to play my
[01:50:48] mom said that it was my dad that was was
[01:50:50] but she had him he had her tell me that
[01:50:52] I wasn't because he was always away
[01:50:53] fishing that was his job he was a
[01:50:54] fisherman so I'm like H he's been dead
[01:50:58] for almost 20 years are you trying to
[01:51:00] throw this out there just because you
[01:51:01] can and get away with it and I'm not
[01:51:04] going to be able to go Dad is this true
[01:51:07] cuz this seems like something that my
[01:51:08] mom would do not my dad but at the same
[01:51:11] time it could have been him trying to
[01:51:13] protect me but anyways going to do that
[01:51:17] little story of my life we talk about
[01:51:19] things hang out all the time children
[01:51:22] what are you doing bu
[01:51:24] guys I need to building
[01:51:28] Legos think they're building Legos we
[01:51:31] got some Legos coming in soon from a
[01:51:33] friend we got some Legos on here uh my
[01:51:36] son saw we uh we like the Star Wars ones
[01:51:38] he has a bunch of Star Wars Legos he

[01:54:16] and I just need to get the hell around a
[01:54:17] lot of them and get out of that road
[01:54:19] it's literally the reason why I put this
[01:54:21] on and we just blow right through I4
[01:54:23] wherever we're going so I think we're
[01:54:25] doing that later today too so we'll see
[01:54:27] what happens here we go guys this is
[01:54:29] your special going on here get your two
[01:54:31] strength go through an adventure of the
[01:54:33] Vault and remember save the show for our
[01:54:36] uh our release day of Fallout we got a
[01:54:38] special Vault for you guys that's going

[01:54:44] with it but we'll see we'll see if you
[01:54:48] do I don't know know that' be pretty
[01:54:55] cool
[01:54:57] give give
[01:55:01] what more info all right so the
[01:55:04] adventure As You Adventure in the vault
[01:55:07] what I mean through the Wasteland what
[01:55:09] you have is you pick your
[01:55:10] packs for whatever you want sometimes
[01:55:14] you want to uh now if you pick multiple
[01:55:16] packs you do get a little couple bucks
[01:55:17] off just because it helps with me with
[01:55:19] whatnot Fe so I pass that little bit of
[01:55:21] savings on to you guys um this is with
[01:55:24] version 2.0 I mean 2.5 though but what
[01:55:26] you do is you pick packs of cards and
[01:55:28] they add up to point strength for your
[01:55:30] character and as you wander through the
[01:55:33] Wasteland things will
[01:55:35] happen your characters
[01:55:38] are these here you can choose there are
[01:55:41] four characters as you wander through
[01:55:43] the wasand you're going to get pluses or
[01:55:45] minuses as you wander through the
[01:55:47] Wasteland and those pluses or minuses
[01:55:49] come from the boxes where you pick them
[01:55:50] out and it's either plus one or minus
[01:55:52] one as you wander through and then until
[01:55:54] you get to the end where you maybe get
[01:55:56] to a boss maybe you can beat the boss
[01:55:58] Maybe not maybe you're a detective and
[01:56:00] you get beat yourself but that is how
[01:56:03] our kind of game a quick rundown Works
[01:56:06] um I can give you a more elaborate one
[01:56:07] if you'd like um but generally quick
[01:56:10] rundown works for everybody
[01:56:13] here and I'm G to put this on for the
[01:56:17] same price actually these three we going
[01:56:19] to go on for 30 also yeah yeah and then
[01:56:22] at the end if you beat the boss you get
[01:56:24] a chance at um a free um a spin of the
[01:56:29] set booster wheel to get you a free set
[01:56:31] booster pack or a um a vault here here
[01:56:35] uh the Vault hit if you lose to the ball
[01:56:37] boss you have to crawl back to the Vault
[01:56:39] sometimes um if you hit big maybe you're
[01:56:42] going to be big enough with your cacks
[01:56:43] that you can hit big and come out with a
[01:56:44] collector booster from The Loot drop of
[01:56:46] the boss and that's how we do our game
[01:56:48] here
[01:56:50] so you pick your packs and you go based
[01:56:52] on what you have so say you get like
[01:56:55] um multiple collector boosters then you
[01:56:58] can get a collector booster say you get
[01:56:59] multiple set boosters then you can get a
[01:57:00] set booster that type of thing and you
[01:57:04] can just get an extra on top of it based
[01:57:07] on what you
[01:57:09] get so like for instance this here
[01:57:12] starting out with your packs say you
[01:57:14] wanted to go with these this would be
[01:57:17] one two strength on your adventure
[01:57:20] through the
[01:57:22] Wasteland I'm just doing random things
[01:57:24] here for everyone so you guys can pick
[01:57:26] them or not and this will start you
[01:57:30] out at this for your adventure through
[01:57:33] the
[01:57:36] Wasteland all right and you get to pick
[01:57:39] your character and its strength I mean
[01:57:43] your character oh come on that did not
[01:57:44] run you need to pick your character
[01:57:46] after its strength has been picked here
[01:57:49] run there we go so there you go that
[01:57:52] would be two strength you'd wander
[01:57:54] through the Wasteland you'd pick cards
[01:57:56] out of your boxes here then you come up
[01:57:58] into one of the bosses maybe you beat
[01:58:00] Owen Grady because you have over three
[01:58:02] strength or maybe you get a big beat
[01:58:04] down from flare or The Watcher maybe
[01:58:06] dinosaurs come crushing You by or maybe
[01:58:08] Mary weather light duelist comes on
[01:58:10] through and you get a slash and she wins
[01:58:13] maybe Velociraptor bites you but you

[02:22:02] bit can still moonwalk a little
[02:22:05] bit here we go there click I mean uh no
[02:22:08] I mean Steven Steven the Red Dot oh you
[02:22:13] wonder what that is the Red Dot is
[02:22:16] actually
[02:22:17] a button it's a
[02:22:20] button all right now if you look
[02:22:24] in the uh buy now it'll tell you what
[02:22:27] the button is and I'll P I'll pin it
[02:22:28] here in a second here so you can see
[02:22:32] it but it is pretty much uh you don't
[02:22:35] want to press the red button no one
[02:22:36] wants to press the red button but people
[02:22:38] still I tell no I don't say no one wants
[02:22:40] to press it I keep telling people don't
[02:22:42] press the red button because the red
[02:22:44] button has a bunch of there is600 00
[02:22:47] cards most of them are common cards and
[02:22:50] uh cards that are 50 to 10 cents all
[02:22:53] right some of them are a dollar some of
[02:22:55] them are maybe like a $2 but what the
[02:22:59] thing is here is that box has a bunch of
[02:23:03] packs mixed into it written on them and
[02:23:06] then this is the big hit on one of the
[02:23:08] packs this entire collector booster box
[02:23:12] now we've had about 300 of the, 1600
[02:23:14] pulled out so it is dropping down in
[02:23:18] what we have but maybe somebody will hit
[02:23:22] it at some point and go launch the
[02:23:27] missiles and take out the Moon instead
[02:23:31] of just going up and coming Crashing
[02:23:33] Down to Earth with nothing and just
[02:23:36] blowing right on back up because you
[02:23:39] just get a big old zero goose egg and
[02:23:42] that's because somebody said I should do
[02:23:43] a high value ridiculous hit game I'm not
[02:23:46] a big fan of doing the big high value
[02:23:48] ridiculous hit games it was more of like
[02:23:50] We'll add it on if somebody wanted to do
[02:23:52] hey like give me um give me two packs
[02:23:54] and uh three of the the three of the red
[02:23:58] buttons type thing is what I was hoping
[02:23:59] it was going to be but for some reason
[02:24:02] people started buying them and just just
[02:24:04] buying them I was like not my thing but
[02:24:06] you know what I guess you guys like that
[02:24:08] chance of potentially getting the whole
[02:24:09] collector booster box of um Lord of the
[02:24:12] Rings there and I think that might be
[02:24:13] what it is you got that big hit in there
[02:24:15] and that's what people like is that big
[02:24:16] chance
[02:24:18] I think that's what it is there in the
[02:24:20] red button maybe you go up and you hit a
[02:24:24] pack and you take out a
[02:24:29] satellite I don't know or maybe you want
[02:24:33] that's what our red button is there
[02:24:34] that's the red thing
[02:24:38] there oh thank you just even you know
[02:24:41] what um my U my kids actually you can
[02:24:45] you can um you can thank my children for
[02:24:46] a lot of it by the way my children um
[02:24:49] were the ones that were like yo let's do
[02:24:51] this this seems fun and they kept having
[02:24:53] asking me to do different things and cuz

[02:32:38] an extra pack after you beat the boss an
[02:32:41] extra pack of cards or maybe you get and

[02:32:45] Vault and you get get something out of
[02:32:46] there where there could be a couple of
[02:32:48] nice hits out of that we'll see it's up
[02:32:50] to you we always do sudden death here
[02:32:52] cuz I am a sudden death I do it because
[02:32:55] my reason for doing this is I like to
[02:32:57] give stuff away to people that buy
[02:32:58] things versus people that just come in
[02:33:00] for giveaway things so what I do is I do
[02:33:02] this and the reason why you get a free
[02:33:04] pack potentially to get your extra pack
[02:33:05] when you buy just regular price is
[02:33:07] because that's a giveaway for kind of
[02:33:09] like the buyer if that makes sense I
[02:33:12] don't know that's how I do it that's why
[02:33:13] I like to do it that way to me it feels
[02:33:15] like it's almost like a giveaway to the
[02:33:18] buyer the auction was for the uh
[02:33:22] Adventure game Q magic all right so you
[02:33:26] can pick anything you want here to add
[02:33:29] up to be your strength for your
[02:33:31] character as you travel through the
[02:33:32] Wasteland now each one of the sets are
[02:33:35] like half collectors or premium ones are
[02:33:38] point so like this here is going to be
[02:33:40] one strength for your adventure through
[02:33:41] theeland you get two Wilds of drain for
[02:33:45] one strength and modern Horizon for one
[02:33:47] strength as you wander through the
[02:33:48] Wasteland and that will end up giving
[02:33:51] you um I'll put that up
[02:33:57] here little stay I'll put that up there
[02:34:01] that'll give you two strength as you
[02:34:02] wander through the Wasteland and when
[02:34:04] you wander through the Wasteland you get
[02:34:06] to choose your character you get pluses
[02:34:09] or minuses as you wander through and
[02:34:10] what happens is you hit pluses or
[02:34:13] minuses depending on this box these
[02:34:16] boxes you get one two and three chances
[02:34:18] of pluses and minuses for your strength
[02:34:21] to get to the end where you would fight
[02:34:22] a boss where you pick one of the 10
[02:34:24] maybe you cut out where you can beat one
[02:34:26] of these where you get the Velociraptor
[02:34:28] or Owen Grady or mey that you could beat
[02:34:31] or maybe um and if not may you get beat
[02:34:34] by the boss you go to the Vault to see
[02:34:37] what happens
[02:34:39] there oh we
[02:34:41] have R R's going with the Mysteries yeah
[02:34:46] yeah so we do a little bit of a game for
[02:34:48] you guys and then you get a free pack if
[02:34:50] you beat the boss you may be a collector
[02:34:52] booster or a set depending on what you
[02:34:54] buy if you buy all collector boosters
[02:34:55] you could win a collector booster if you
[02:34:57] get the high ones or you get a set but

[02:45:27] that's a nice little hit and then Goblin
[02:45:29] mask maker foil storm Kirk Captain I not
[02:45:34] seen that one before for your list card
[02:45:36] forest in your ooze there in your ooze
[02:45:40] there all righty let's see where your
[02:45:43] top card was here is your top might have
[02:45:48] not been five I think it was that one
[02:45:50] with
[02:45:52] five it is that one with five five is
[02:45:56] your top for the sun all right let's see
[02:45:58] what happens here maybe you can come out
[02:46:01] with something big here for the buyer
[02:46:05] maybe we can come out with a nice seven
[02:46:07] I think ratos ratos is a potential here
[02:46:11] right lies is a mini hit is it really
[02:46:15] really I don't know that lies is a mini
[02:46:20] hit no more lies all right I know that
[02:46:23] no more lies a little mini hit there I
[02:46:25] didn't know that one was all right let's
[02:46:26] get you some good luck though one 2 3 4
[02:46:29] five 6 7 cuz we put those spoilers at
[02:46:32] the end here not at the beginning our
[02:46:34] buddy the real renie lumbering laundry
[02:46:39] we got to put that down so it doesn't
[02:46:40] fall Beni criminologist jaded analyst
[02:46:44] slime against manity that's a nice
[02:46:45] little one everybody likes the Slime
[02:46:48] Rubble belt bragard sanguin savior due
[02:46:51] diligence three confiscation lead pipe
[02:46:56] sample collector exit specialist laavo
[02:46:59] wearer faces repeat offender Island and
[02:47:05] your token all right
[02:47:08] so I think the father won here oh you
[02:47:14] got a five yeah I think the father did
[02:47:16] win here five and five so the father did
[02:47:20] win here but you know what you got
[02:47:21] yourself a nice expedited inheritance in
[02:47:24] a slime Against Humanity there now for
[02:47:26] the father would you like me to do
[02:47:27] something random or would you like you
[02:47:29] would you like to pick them
[02:47:34] yourself the real renie the real
[02:47:43] renie if it's two- a tie we go down to
[02:47:47] the next level card so um
[02:47:50] so I'll explain if there's ties it
[02:47:53] doesn't happen frequently but if there
[02:47:55] are ties this is what goes on if there
[02:47:58] is a two-way tie you go down to the next
[02:48:01] card so all the way down to three at the
[02:48:04] most so if it goes down to three cards
[02:48:06] to all the way down then the buyer ends
[02:48:07] up being a winner now if there's a
[02:48:09] three-way tie the buyer is a winner and
[02:48:12] he goes to the buyer box and that's how
[02:48:14] it works so if there's a two-a tie it
[02:48:16] just goes down three levels to the next
[02:48:18] three highest cards and whichever one's
[02:48:21] the winner out of those is the one that
[02:48:24] comes out on
[02:48:30] top rny
[02:48:34] do random all right random for the
[02:48:38] father and I do this when we do random I
[02:48:41] like to do this kind of like leaves one
[02:48:42] hanging there's our one hanging you came

What are taxes on buying a $250k boat in Maryland when we are from Florida 

[2024-08-17 13:33:20] ChatGPT:
When purchasing a boat in Maryland, even if you are from Florida, you will need to be aware of several taxes and fees that may apply. Here's a breakdown of the potential taxes and fees you might encounter:

### 1. **Maryland Vessel Excise Tax:**
   - Maryland imposes a **5% Vessel Excise Tax** on the purchase price or fair market value of the boat, whichever is higher.
   - For a $250,000 boat, this would be **$12,500**.

### 2. **Maryland Sales and Use Tax:**
   - Maryland does not charge an additional sales tax on top of the Vessel Excise Tax. The excise tax covers what would be considered a sales tax.

### 3. **Registration and Titling Fees:**
   - **Titling Fee:** $2 per $100 of the boatâ€™s value, capped at $15,000. For a $250,000 boat, this would be **$5,000**.
   - **Registration Fee:** Typically, a registration fee may also apply, depending on the size of the vessel. The fee for boats 16 feet and over is **$24** per year.

### 4. **Potential Florida Use Tax:**
   - If you plan to bring the boat back to Florida and register it there, you might be subject to Florida's **Use Tax**, which is 6% of the purchase price, minus any taxes paid to Maryland. 
   - However, since you would have paid the 5% excise tax in Maryland, you might only owe an additional 1% to Florida, or none, depending on local surtaxes or credits applied.

### 5. **Other Considerations:**
   - **Local Surtaxes:** If you plan to keep the boat in Maryland for a significant amount of time, local taxes or fees might apply.
   - **Florida's 180-Day Rule:** If you plan to return the boat to Florida, keep in mind that Florida has a "180-day rule" for avoiding the use tax. If you keep the boat out of Florida for more than 180 days after purchase, you may be able to avoid Florida's use tax.

### Summary:
- **Maryland Vessel Excise Tax:** $12,500
- **Titling Fee:** $5,000 (capped)
- **Registration Fee:** $24
- **Potential Additional Florida Use Tax:** Up to 1%, depending on circumstances.

If you plan to keep the boat in Maryland, you will mainly be dealing with Maryland's excise tax, registration, and titling fees. If bringing the boat back to Florida, you may need to consider Florida's use tax rules.

I recommend consulting with a tax advisor or maritime attorney to ensure compliance with both states' tax laws.

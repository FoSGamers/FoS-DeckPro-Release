[00:11:04] to have you guys pick your character
[00:11:06] strength and when they do that you're
[00:11:07] going to do that by picking out some of

[00:34:21] something extra I believe it's only 50
[00:34:23] cents more up until you get to like a
[00:34:26] certain amount of weight and then it
[00:34:27] charges a different amount but um the
[00:34:29] weight you're not going to I don't think
[00:34:30] you're going to get up to that weight I
[00:34:31] think it's
[00:34:33] like 5 or 10 pounds or something like
[00:34:35] that I have to double check it's in the
[00:34:37] um it's in the shipping exp explanation

[00:55:04] is how we're going to go
[00:55:07] so your character which you are going to
[00:55:09] create which you'll help create based on
[00:55:11] what you purchase in regards to packs if
[00:55:13] you can get any bonuses for your uh
[00:55:15] skill points and that's how you're going
[00:55:17] to distribute them that's how it'll
[00:55:18] start out but before we so you know that
[00:55:21] your character you're going to build
[00:55:23] what the character's name is whoever
[00:55:25] purchased is we'll build a name what the
[00:55:28] character type is and also

[01:51:30] here all right that is our
[01:51:33] giveway
[01:51:35] from MTG and
[01:51:39] James and now our adventure we were
[01:51:42] beginning our adventure here and what
[01:51:45] was going on was
[01:51:57] what we were doing
[01:51:59] was the the the 15-year-old was just put
[01:52:04] in coming out of the out of the uh
[01:52:09] Chrono chamber where he was a little bit
[01:52:11] out out disorganized he was like he's
[01:52:13] like a 15-year-old boy but he had the
[01:52:15] size he was the size of an adult didn't
[01:52:17] really understand what was going on
[01:52:18] started wandering around that Vault and
[01:52:20] going Dad where are you Dad where are
[01:52:23] you he is
[01:52:25] awesome I actually started watching him
[01:52:28] before I started selling on
[01:52:30] here so I was watching him in another
[01:52:34] person and I was like oh this is really
[01:52:39] good and uh I hung out for a while I
[01:52:42] bought a few things and had and then my
[01:52:46] son was like let's do it ourselves cuz
[01:52:48] he wanted open packs I was
[01:52:50] like and that's
[01:52:53] all right so your is now starting that
[01:52:58] Vault and now this is what's going to
[01:53:01] happen you are the character you get to
[01:53:03] pick how the starts here going to start
[01:53:08] out it's going to have three choices for
[01:53:11] you first person is going to choose what
[01:53:14] the character their sex is and then they
[01:53:16] pick a pack out of them and they get to
[01:53:18] pick some of the skill points the second
[01:53:20] person either will be able to do the
[01:53:21] same thing but it's is going to be
[01:53:23] whether they are human or a
[01:53:26] um human or a mutant and then the
[01:53:29] third for the
[01:53:32] person no it's only two the human and
[01:53:34] the sex those are the two things that we
[01:53:35] choose I forgot about that it was three
[01:53:37] was a different one so you're going to
[01:53:38] choose two so what I'm going to do right
[01:53:40] now is I'm going to run these and the
[01:53:42] way I'm going to run this is a little
[01:53:43] different okay I'm going to start it
[01:53:47] out
[01:53:50] where I'm just going to put these out
[01:53:52] here so you know what the prices of
[01:53:54] those are so that they're all the
[01:53:56] same there would be any of those
[01:54:00] three if you upgrade and you want
[01:54:05] with an extra
[01:54:09] strength if you upgrade and want to go
[01:54:12] with an next
[01:54:14] rength any of these three all right and
[01:54:18] kind of lay them out here so you see
[01:54:21] them then
[01:54:24] if you want to do an extra upgrade
[01:54:26] really get up
[01:54:29] there you would
[01:54:32] do any of these three now it's going to
[01:54:35] be a little intriguing on how you do
[01:54:36] this I don't know if it's going to be
[01:54:37] confusing as [ __ ] or not my wife thought
[01:54:39] this might work but I was like ah all
[01:54:42] right we'll try it
[01:54:43] out where's the other one right
[01:54:47] here all right
[01:54:49] so the way we're going to do this is
[01:54:53] this is just the regular skill points
[01:54:55] this is a plus one that is plus two I'm
[01:54:58] going to run the auction I'm going to
[01:55:00] start it out just at the $6 here if you
[01:55:03] want to get a plus one for the
[01:55:06] character you would bid up to these ones
[01:55:09] here
[01:55:12] now you can bid up to the price of these
[01:55:15] packs now I'll put all the price of the
[01:55:16] packs up on the screen so you see them
[01:55:20] all right there you I want the time
[01:55:22] spiral I want to bid up to the time
[01:55:24] spiral one I'm going to bid up that pack
[01:55:27] price on time spiral that way I can get
[01:55:29] it and we can get him in one extra
[01:55:31] strength but maybe you know I actually
[01:55:33] think they should get two extra for what
[01:55:35] we're doing and you can bid up to the
[01:55:36] price of any of these ones
[01:55:38] here so that's what we're
[01:55:41] do is you're going to help get the
[01:55:44] character strength depending on what you
[01:55:47] bid up to please let me know if that's
[01:55:49] explained correctly or if you have any
[01:55:51] more questions
[01:55:54] that was my wife's thought and you get
[01:55:55] to pick any of
[01:55:58] the based on which one you want to go
[01:56:00] with all right let's try this out here
[01:56:03] confusing as a [ __ ] but let's
[01:56:05] see if you guys listen we're building
[01:56:06] our character right now what's going to
[01:56:09] happen is if you don't this I'm G to
[01:56:11] pick
[01:56:13] my P
[01:56:16] $4 for that is like 50 cents extra until
[01:56:20] you get to a certain weight class I
[01:56:21] think
[01:56:25] all right so this is literally a it's
[01:56:27] like a dungeon and
[01:56:30] dragon we're building our character
[01:56:33] right now we're literally this isn't a
[01:56:35] game this is a story we're going through
[01:56:37] we're building a character and we're
[01:56:38] doing a story the entire time so it's
[01:56:41] not really fully a game what we're doing
[01:56:42] is you're going to build your character
[01:56:44] and we're going to go through a story in
[01:56:45] the Wasteland and every step along the
[01:56:48] way there'll be an option of buying
[01:56:50] something to help your character or to
[01:56:52] become the character yourself so you can
[01:56:54] make choices of what goes on all right
[01:56:57] that's kind of what I'm doing here so at
[01:56:59] the
[01:57:01] moment these packs are up
[01:57:03] here you have basic which is all of
[01:57:07] these are $6 so you have to bit it bid
[01:57:09] to six actually I should have put $9
[01:57:12] ones out here but
[01:57:13] whatever um these ones are like an extra
[01:57:17] so you get a plus one what you would do
[01:57:19] is you would look on the um thing there
[01:57:22] and you would bid up to the price of
[01:57:24] whatever it is then what you would do is
[01:57:28] if you wanted plus two it would be the
[01:57:30] same thing you would bid up to the price
[01:57:31] of these whatever packs they are I think
[01:57:34] that's not might be confusing but you're
[01:57:37] building the strength of your character
[01:57:39] right
[01:57:40] now the
[01:57:42] um if you go to frequently ask questions
[01:57:45] the live Wasteland Adventure is written
[01:57:47] in there I'm going to be right back I
[01:57:49] got to grab a drink while that while
[01:57:51] that giveaway is running
[01:57:54] got to fill my drink
[01:57:58] up F the drink
[01:58:31] all right so I'm going to explain it
[01:58:33] this is like a D and D
[01:58:35] Adventure where you get to be the
[01:58:38] character based on what you're picking
[01:58:40] out or what you're buying here all right
[01:58:44] so I gave it a guys are read that
[01:58:48] help almost 100 that's pretty sweet
[01:58:50] there oh almost
[01:58:53] Legend does it make a little bit more
[01:58:55] sense mildly

[01:58:58] almost Legend went with a
[01:59:03] mystery oh Legend went with a
[01:59:07] miss so it's like a a straight out D and

[01:59:13] the beginning and we're going to try to
[01:59:14] go through to get all the way to the
[01:59:16] boss at the end that's the whole point
[01:59:18] there's going to be some there's going
[01:59:20] to be some quests along the way

[02:12:31] what you're looking
[02:12:33] for so we're going to put these on out
[02:12:36] again we're going to put this out on
[02:12:39] again for the
[02:12:42] game you are wandered out of the uh
[02:12:49] cryogenic chamber
[02:12:54] all right you're wandering out of that
[02:12:58] Crow
[02:13:00] you now have to pick your and your
[02:13:06] skills jimstone Caverns
[02:13:09] yes how do you pick that's what I'm
[02:13:11] going to explain it's auction
[02:13:14] yes so I'm going to run this auction I'm
[02:13:16] going to explain it a little bit I'm
[02:13:17] going to run it for five minutes right
[02:13:18] now to
[02:13:19] explain but I'm going to Dro it to a
[02:13:22] couple minutes after so what you're
[02:13:24] going to do is you start out at $6 if
[02:13:27] you want to buy one of these to start
[02:13:29] out with just basic and you get to pick
[02:13:32] two of the six skill points get set
[02:13:37] would be this but if say you wanted to
[02:13:39] get an extra skill point you would bid
[02:13:41] up to one of these packs now the pack
[02:13:44] prices are all up there so that you can
[02:13:46] see them all right so you would bid up
[02:13:49] to the price of one of these packs and
[02:13:51] that would give you one
[02:13:54] extra to your character you're like you
[02:13:57] know what I want to give him two extra I
[02:13:59] think there's
[02:14:02] two you go buy one of these packs to the
[02:14:07] price that you see up there and that's
[02:14:09] what you would do to start your
[02:14:11] character and build the strength and you
[02:14:12] get to pick two of the skill and
[02:14:15] depending on what other extra you get
[02:14:17] there the high extra
[02:14:21] so I think you guys can understand it a
[02:14:24] little bit so
[02:14:26] what is I'm going to
[02:14:29] drop five minutes to a
[02:14:31] minute and there you go that's what it
[02:14:34] is there
[02:14:36] now looks like we're at time spiral
[02:14:39] where we're going to get an
[02:14:41] extra skill point to assign now I'm
[02:14:44] going to write all these down so we know
[02:14:46] I might I actually have it
[02:14:47] over I'm type it
[02:14:53] and you get to pick the first one you
[02:14:56] get to
[02:14:58] pick the
[02:15:01] is and um the skill point so like if
[02:15:05] they are male or female and then three
[02:15:09] it looks like three skill points you'll
[02:15:10] be selecting
[02:15:14] here CCM yeah Commander Masters
[02:15:17] collector booster correct Commander m
[02:15:21] about
[02:15:24] that all
[02:15:30] [Laughter]
[02:15:32] righty all right Ty clone I'm guessing
[02:15:36] you're going with a Time spiral so I'm
[02:15:39] going to put these all right here
[02:15:53] B is a 12 I'm just want to make
[02:15:55] sure yep all
[02:16:00] right there you go that's it all right
[02:16:04] so you get one
[02:16:07] extra strength uh one extra skill to

[02:40:04] flickering on and off on and off the
[02:40:06] entire time and as you slowly get out of
[02:40:09] the chamber that has all of the
[02:40:13] cryogenics in them you finally see the
[02:40:16] big open vault door vault door is
[02:40:18] cracked halfway open going oh what oh I
[02:40:22] remember now we found a vault with
[02:40:25] Dad and
[02:40:28] he he pushed me in chamber
[02:40:32] and he said [ __ ] something it was
[02:40:35] something follow what did he say oh you
[02:40:40] wander out you step outside of that
[02:40:42] Vault and right outside that
[02:40:45] Vault you
[02:40:47] see a leather jacket on on the
[02:40:50] ground that leather jacket on the
[02:40:54] ground
[02:40:55] has a little white envelope sticking in
[02:40:59] it like what is this
[02:41:01] thing put it on like
[02:41:03] [Laughter]
[02:41:05] pants so what it is is you lean over to
[02:41:09] pick that jacket up
[02:41:11] and what we're going to do here with the
[02:41:13] dice is if it is one to five your jacket
[02:41:19] gives you a
[02:41:20] bonus on your defense of plus one for
[02:41:25] health if it
[02:41:27] is um 6 through
[02:41:30] 15 it is just a jacket and it does
[02:41:35] nothing if it is 17 through
[02:41:40] 20 the jacket you doesn't matter it's
[02:41:43] GNA it's going to you put it on and it
[02:41:44] will actually harm you fat guy in a
[02:41:47] little jacket kind of thing all right so
[02:41:50] we're going to roll the dice and we're
[02:41:51] going to see if it's going to be helpful
[02:41:52] if it's just going to be a jacket for
[02:41:53] some for a little extra for you just
[02:41:55] some art to put on your body so you re
[02:41:58] you pick that jacket up and as you pick
[02:42:00] that jacket up you see oh look at that
[02:42:03] is
[02:42:05] 20 oh
[02:42:07] no
[02:42:09] no wait is this one or 20 I think that's
[02:42:13] 20 on this it's 20 yes number 20
[02:42:19] and that means you pick that jacket up
[02:42:22] no no it's a
[02:42:25] radiated you pick that jacket up you
[02:42:27] don't know it's IR radiated and you put
[02:42:28] it on that IR radiated jacket you just
[02:42:32] oh sweet and you pull out that envelope
[02:42:34] has it's a note from your
[02:42:36] father what is this a note from your
[02:42:41] father no the jacket actually slowly
[02:42:46] over time takes away your health
[02:42:51] all right every encounter until you take
[02:42:54] that jack off
[02:42:57] or it becomes it takes away from your
[02:43:01] health in a
[02:43:04] battle dad doesn't hate you it's been
[02:43:06] hiding out in the Wasteland for 15 years
[02:43:09] it's all radiated with all kinds of
[02:43:11] radioactive stuff that's been on it all
[02:43:13] the time that's why dad doesn't hate you
[02:43:16] he actually leaves a note you open that
[02:43:17] note up and the note says

[02:43:24] smell I don't know where it
[02:43:26] went but I'll leave you Clues along the
[02:43:31] way and what happens is that jacket he

[03:36:14] so ready we're going to go like this
[03:36:16] he's coming toward you and you're going
[03:36:18] to roll to see what
[03:36:20] happens you have a you hit the body for
[03:36:23] 1 to six head 7 to 10 limb for 11 and 17
[03:36:30] to 17 and a miss for an8 to 18 to 20 so
[03:36:34] you swing and you get
[03:36:37] six six you swing at his
[03:36:42] body that's running toward you and it's
[03:36:44] only got
[03:36:46] five strength all right so you swing at
[03:36:49] that Raider's body you hit it with plus
[03:36:52] one because your your sword there and
[03:36:55] your one original strength which is now
[03:36:57] two
[03:36:58] strength dropping it down to three
[03:37:01] strength as you is in there at three
[03:37:02] health I mean three
[03:37:04] Health now the Raider though the
[03:37:09] Raider
[03:37:11] Raider gets
[03:37:13] three all right the ra gets
[03:37:16] three and that he lands a
[03:37:21] hit on
[03:37:24] you where was it he lands a hit on
[03:37:27] you now that is just a soft hit with his
[03:37:31] sword with his knife that he has there
[03:37:33] doesn't do too much damage only brings
[03:37:35] you down
[03:37:37] to TW 12 and a half strength 12 and a
[03:37:42] half strength all right because it's not
[03:37:44] a lot of damage there
[03:37:46] cuz it's a rusty a rusty
[03:37:49] knife all
[03:37:51] right now you get to swing again with
[03:37:55] your Bo and
[03:37:57] you where are you
[03:38:01] hit the
[03:38:04] Raider in the B again swinging that
[03:38:08] brings him down to one
[03:38:10] Health that Raider is now at one Health
[03:38:13] and has a couple of cashes on its body
[03:38:15] so when it goes to swing at you instead
[03:38:19] of the Miss potential for
[03:38:22] it
[03:38:24] being
[03:38:25] um they're going to have a Miss
[03:38:28] potential instead of hitting it in the
[03:38:29] head it'll miss you instead because it
[03:38:31] can't aim
[03:38:33] well so we now are at
[03:38:36] 17 which a
[03:38:39] limb they swing at your arm they strike
[03:38:43] you in the arm leaving a
[03:38:47] gash but that only brings you down to 12
[03:38:50] because it's only a rusty knife and he's
[03:38:53] very dizzy you swing one more time at
[03:38:56] him with your
[03:38:57] sword which is
[03:39:00] six hitting him in the body again
[03:39:03] dropping him down right down to nothing

[04:15:12] best I'm pretty good at on prices when
[04:15:13] it comes to single like packs and stuff
[04:15:16] but when it comes to the boxes I'm not

[04:15:35] being honest that's all I try to be as H
[04:15:37] as I

Below is a response I want to make in discord and the under is what is said prior.

I always have the link to whatnot and with the Overlay it helps drive people in but I'll figure out how to do that manually with obs to drive to whatnot. I've actually had many new people over the months I've pulled in just by multistreaming to YouTube so I want to expand my follower base for more sales to get pulled into whatnot. From my understanding as long as I am promoting whatnot and driving traffic there it is fine. I'm not really sure why you have to put accusations of some kind into here when I'm asking a question on something I've need doing for almost a year if you have ever followed me. I also like YouTube since it saves all my streams so if anyone complains or lies (it does happen)  I can always direct them to the live video recording . Records keeping purposes 


Prior stuff

Hey Everyone!

I’m currently integrating OBS Studio with my Whatnot streams and could use some help. I’ve set up my Whatnot stream and connected it to OBS, but I have a few questions about how scheduling works across platforms.

When I create a scheduled stream in Whatnot, am I able to also schedule it on YouTube? I want to be sure that I can start the same stream on both platforms through OBS when I go live.

I’ve noticed when I test in private mode on YouTube, it doesn’t give me the full range of options for verifying the stream. Is this normal? What’s the best way to ensure my streams are properly set to go live on both platforms?

Any insight would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!

Any assistance here would be much appreciated.  I tried today but it seems the show from Whatnot pushed and took over.

My first question would be what is the point of streaming on both? You would probably have to use a third party interface to multi stream. But I think most of them only do the main streaming platforms

Plus the fact that it's probably against terms of service.

The built in Whatnot multicasting feature was made for easily multicasting while using the Whatnot app. It doesn't work very well with Whatnot web/ OBS.

I would highly recommend multicasting directly from OBS with a custom setup. We don't currently support this officially, so no guidance is available, but I can point you in the right direction for how to set this up. 

https://aitum.tv/products/vertical

1. Use Aitum Vertical to add a second canvas to OBS. 
2. Use your main OBS canvas for your Whatnot streams as normal, the way you already have it set up with the new integration.
3. Use the Aitum "Vertical" canvas as your YouTube canvas. It doesn't need to be vertical, just change the settings to 1920x1080, set up proper encoding settings for YouTube within the Vertical plugin, and then set it up to stream to YouTube. 

That's as much guidance as I can give, but it works. Very well.

Just as an fyi most people that want to stream to youtube also are trying to avoid the whatnot fees for selling. They sell stuff as "personal rips" and the person pays them outside of whatnot. I am not saying the OP is doing this but a few people in his category do

It’s not against our terms to multicast, and we do have a built in feature for it! But if situations like this are happening, our trust & safety team is very good at handling them and you can always submit a report to them that will be reviewed!

I always have and have even gained new buyers from YouTube on many occasions. I'll have to check about the restream option

So you can multi stream but you can't say the name of other platforms.

I always have the link to Whatnot, and with the overlay, it helps drive people there, but I'll figure out how to do that manually with OBS to keep directing traffic. Over the months, I've actually brought in new people just by multistreaming to YouTube, which has helped me grow my follower base and bring more sales to Whatnot. From what I understand, as long as I'm promoting Whatnot and driving traffic there, it's perfectly fine. 

I'm not sure why there's an assumption or accusation here—I’ve been doing this for almost a year. If you'd followed me during that time, you would know that. Also, I appreciate YouTube for saving all my streams, so if anyone raises issues or claims (and trust me, it happens), I can always refer them to the live video recording for clarity. It's an important aspect of record keeping for me.

You can let them know I've grown from having zero followers to having over 12,000, 1,200 followers and over 100,000 views a month plus over a thousand hours of watch time a month. So why wouldn't I not want to do something like this when YouTube will even pay me in ad money now so that I can put it towards other stuff that I want to do or whatnot in my community? Maybe I do giveaways because of all the ad money I get, but I guess people with simple minds don't think beyond the things that other people, beyond the bad things that they could be happening because they are the only ones that do the bad things in the first place so they project it on everyone else. Make that nicer and add it to what I already have here.

Given these results, why wouldn’t I want to continue using YouTube to support my Whatnot sales and community? YouTube even pays me in ad revenue now, which I reinvest into things like community giveaways. Unfortunately, some people can only see the negative side of things because they may project their own actions onto others. It's important to focus on growth and the positive aspects of these platforms rather than assuming the worst about people.

See if we should reorganize or reformat the whole response.

[2024-10-01 10:49:04] ChatGPT:
Let’s reorganize the response for clarity and flow. This version breaks the ideas into more distinct sections while maintaining professionalism:

---

I always include the link to Whatnot, and using the overlay helps drive people there. I’ve also manually directed traffic to Whatnot using OBS, which has brought in many new people over the months. By multistreaming to YouTube, I’ve managed to expand my follower base and increase sales on Whatnot. From my understanding, as long as I’m driving traffic to Whatnot, it’s perfectly fine.

To clarify, I’ve been doing this for almost a year, and if anyone had followed my progress, they'd see how multistreaming has worked for me. YouTube is also invaluable because it saves all my streams. This has been helpful for record-keeping purposes. If any complaints or false claims come up (which happens), I can refer people to the live video recordings to resolve disputes.

In terms of growth, I’ve gone from zero to over 12,000 followers on YouTube, adding 1,200 new followers each month. I now receive over 100,000 views and more than a thousand hours of watch time each month. YouTube even pays me ad revenue, which I reinvest into things like community giveaways and further growing the platform.

I realize some people may misunderstand or project their negative experiences onto others, but I choose to focus on the positive. Building my community across platforms helps support Whatnot sales and allows me to give back to the community, and I’ll continue to leverage these platforms for good.

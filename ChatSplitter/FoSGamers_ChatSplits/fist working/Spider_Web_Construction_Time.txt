How quick can a spider make a web that goes between two poles that are four feet apart and four feet high?

The speed at which a spider can create a web depends on several factors, including the species of the spider, environmental conditions, and the specific type of web being constructed. However, for a typical orb-weaving spider, here's a general idea:

1. **Anchor Line**: The spider will first create an anchor line between the two poles. This is usually done quickly, as the spider releases silk while moving from one pole to the other, which could take anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes.

2. **Frame Construction**: Once the anchor line is in place, the spider begins building the frame of the web. This process involves creating the outer boundaries of the web, which might take 5 to 10 minutes.

3. **Radial Threads**: The spider then constructs the radial threads, which extend from the center of the web out to the frame. This could take another 10 to 15 minutes.

4. **Spiral Threads**: Finally, the spider will spin the spiral threads, which form the capturing structure of the web. This is the most time-consuming part and could take anywhere from 20 to 30 minutes.

### Estimated Total Time
Given the distance between the poles (four feet apart) and the height (four feet), a spider could complete a basic web in roughly **30 to 60 minutes** under optimal conditions. However, this can vary depending on the factors mentioned earlier.

### Summary
- **Anchor Line:** 1-2 minutes
- **Frame Construction:** 5-10 minutes
- **Radial Threads:** 10-15 minutes
- **Spiral Threads:** 20-30 minutes
- **Total Time:** 30-60 minutes

This estimate gives a rough idea of how long it might take a spider to construct a web between two poles that are four feet apart and four feet high.

Build the following plugin that goes into the FoSBot Extension. OBS Integration Plugin

Connection Management: Handles connecting to the OBS WebSocket, including closing any existing connections.
Authentication: Manages OBS authentication requirements.
Control Actions: Controls OBS actions such as starting/stopping streaming and switching scenes.
Reconnection Logic: Implements a reconnection mechanism to attempt reconnection every 5 seconds if the connection is lost.
Scene Switching: Allows automatic scene switching based on predefined triggers (e.g., specific chat commands or user actions).
Source Control: Enables control over individual sources, such as showing/hiding text overlays or images.
Audio Control: Adjusts audio settings dynamically, such as muting/unmuting microphones or changing audio sources.
Custom Animations and Effects: Triggers custom animations and effects in OBS based on chat interactions or bot commands.
Check-in Goals: Tracks user check-ins against goals and displays this in OBS.
Randomization Results Display: Shows results of randomization features (dice rolls, card draws) directly in OBS.
Game Integration: Integrates game results with OBS for displaying results.
User Customization: Allows users to create custom commands that can trigger OBS actions, providing flexibility for stream interactions.
Stream Alerts: Configures alerts for new subscribers, donations, etc., displayed on stream.
Chat Commands: Users can trigger specific OBS actions via chat commands.
Performance Monitoring: Tracks OBS performance metrics like CPU and memory usage.
Script Integration: Allows custom Python or Lua scripts to be triggered by chat commands.
Integration: Can be installed and activated from the plugin management section.
Settings Access: OBS settings will only appear in the settings area once the plugin is installed.

Now, let's summarize the actual implementation steps in a Python script called `obs_integration_plugin.py`:

```python
# obs_integration_plugin.py

import asyncio
import websockets
from obswebsocket import obsws, requests, events

class OBSIntegrationPlugin:
    def __init__(self, host='localhost', port=4444, password=''):
        self.host = host
        self.port = port
        self.password = password
        self.ws = None
        self.reconnect_interval = 5  # seconds

    async def connect(self):
        self.ws = obsws(self.host, self.port, self.password)
        try:
            self.ws.connect()
            print("Connected to OBS WebSocket")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Connection failed: {e}")
            await self.reconnect()

    async def reconnect(self):
        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(self.reconnect_interval)
            try:
                self.ws.connect()
                print("Reconnected to OBS WebSocket")
                break
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Reconnection attempt failed: {e}")

        pass

    def integrate_game_results(self, game_results):
        # Implement game result integration logic here
        pass

    def create_custom_command(self, command, action):
        # Implement custom command creation logic here
        pass

    def configure_alerts(self, alert_type, message):
        # Implement alert configuration logic here
        pass

    def trigger_action_via_chat(self, command):
        # Implement chat command action triggering logic here
        pass

    def monitor_performance(self):
        # Implement performance monitoring logic here

if __name__ == '__main__':
    plugin = OBSIntegrationPlugin(password='your_password')
    asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(plugin.connect())
```

### Selectable Options to Enhance the Script:

1. **Validation**: Add validation for all user inputs and connection parameters.
2. **Iteration**: Implement a more robust reconnection strategy with exponential backoff.
3. **Enhancements**: Add logging for all actions and events for better debugging and monitoring.
4. **Optimization**: Optimize WebSocket communication to handle high traffic more efficiently.
5. **Security Improvements**: Encrypt the WebSocket connection and secure the authentication process.
6. **Refactoring for Readability**: Break down large methods into smaller, more manageable functions.

[00:03:28] going to end up doing is actually not no
[00:03:30] one's in here talking or hanging out at

[00:05:11] with that
[00:05:15] copy
[00:05:21] paste cut
[00:05:24] paste
[00:05:26] cut paste all right then we're going to
[00:05:29] do +
[00:05:30] one

[00:06:33] set TSR graph CMR
[00:06:42] graph
[00:06:45] that all
[00:06:49] right I think that's going to be easier
[00:06:51] and I think that's everything I'm going
[00:06:52] to have too hey Knight how you doing hey
[00:06:54] C nuggets how's it going this
[00:06:57] morning oh I got to put this
[00:07:04] good
[00:07:09] morning how you doing good good I'm
[00:07:12] happy to be coming in
[00:07:16] here let me just uh I was just updating
[00:07:18] one thing quickly here
[00:07:30] and we're going to do that as that that
[00:07:34] way you guys can see everything to play
[00:07:35] the games I was going to make it a
[00:07:37] little bit easier for you guys to see
[00:07:38] everything well at least I think this is
[00:07:40] going to be easier for you to see
[00:07:41] everything I don't know sometimes I
[00:07:42] think it's easier and you guys aren't
[00:07:43] and it isn't actually as easy as I
[00:07:45] think here we
[00:07:49] go that grit it
[00:07:59] why is it not doing the grid there on
[00:08:01] the
[00:08:03] side all right there we go that works
[00:08:06] why not all right now we're going to do
[00:08:08] this going to screenshot that way you
[00:08:10] can see it nice and
[00:08:15] easy I had an idea here I don't know if
[00:08:18] it's going to work but we'll find
[00:08:22] out
[00:08:24] capture going save it all right and I am
[00:08:28] almost done
[00:08:33] all right here we go and we're going to
[00:08:34] add that as an
[00:08:38] image and it's going to
[00:08:43] be Adventure
[00:08:45] Packs name it that going to browse there
[00:08:49] we
[00:08:54] go there we go might be a little big
[00:08:57] there let me move that around though
[00:09:00] let move that right there in the middle
[00:09:03] it's a little bit big and I'm going to
[00:09:04] shrink it
[00:09:07] down move it around there better I think
[00:09:11] that'll work better that way you can
[00:09:14] kind of
[00:09:15] see what everything is I think you
[00:09:18] should be able to see it all right there
[00:09:21] there all right actually rather than
[00:09:22] putting these all on screen like this
[00:09:24] cuz then it makes it like I don't have
[00:09:25] to pull them out all the time that way I
[00:09:27] don't need to pull these out all the
[00:09:28] time and you get to just go to what you
[00:09:30] want all right that's what I'm going to
[00:09:31] do there so I'm actually going to put
[00:09:34] these away now I don't know maybe this
[00:09:36] is going to be easier maybe it won't
[00:09:38] maybe I'm being a maybe I'm being a
[00:09:40] stoan I don't know we'll try it out what
[00:09:43] do you think is this pretty H what do
[00:09:44] you think about it do you think the
[00:09:47] uh what do you think is a good idea
[00:09:50] here you like it yeah I figure guys can
[00:09:53] like to now what you do is all
[00:09:57] right playing the
[00:10:00] Adventure what you're going to do is
[00:10:01] you're going to choose something that's
[00:10:02] on screen there all right we're going to

[00:10:57] them added to the stream and there we go
[00:10:58] correct did
[00:11:04] there we're going to do oh we can get

[00:11:18] start the increment at I start it for a
[00:11:20] minute here and this is like how we were

[00:12:25] righty let's see what everybody like to
[00:12:26] do here today we have one we do only
[00:12:28] have a few reward boxes left so I'm
[00:12:32] going to actually do a flash sale only
[00:12:34] on two of those on a dollar for two
[00:12:36] minutes if you guys want them cuz that
[00:12:38] means our ceilings are still in there
[00:12:40] which is
[00:12:42] these our ceilings are still in there
[00:12:44] now if you guys want to jump in on that
[00:12:46] Wasteland Adventure we will begin
[00:12:48] shortly once we had a few people in here
[00:12:50] I figured we'll hang out we'll start out
[00:12:52] our little Adventure
[00:12:54] here start off again with our character
[00:12:57] because we need to create a name for our
[00:12:58] character
[00:12:59] remember our new character is going to
[00:13:01] have name we have to uh create the skill
[00:13:05] set of the character we know that
[00:13:06] they're a little bit of a uh kind of
[00:13:08] like a druish type thing because they
[00:13:10] have the ability to uh control Vines
[00:13:12] since they are grown you know so uh so
[00:13:15] we have that a little bit of information
[00:13:17] but we still have to add some of the
[00:13:18] skill sets up and build it for the
[00:13:20] character to continue our adventure
[00:13:21] through the Wasteland
[00:13:22] [Music]
[00:13:24] here so C nuggets with that being said
[00:13:27] which pack would you like to go with you
[00:13:29] see those all up there you kind of just
[00:13:30] bid up to what you want so I guess it
[00:13:32] would be wow is what you're going with
[00:13:36] right or did you not understand this and
[00:13:38] I can cancel it if you have a problem
[00:13:40] yeah all right wow all right you did
[00:13:43] understand it all right wow here we go
[00:13:45] here's our wow pack I just want to make
[00:13:48] sure we were in understanding take a
[00:13:52] screenshot there you
[00:13:56] go all right see nuggets there we are
[00:13:59] all right so what we'll do here is um
[00:14:05] you know what I wonder you know we did
[00:14:06] it this way before where if you get a
[00:14:08] Mythic it was a it was a critical in a
[00:14:11] in a fight when you open the pack
[00:14:13] because we open it before a battle a
[00:14:15] fight a fight would start like when
[00:14:16] you're going with your adventure now I
[00:14:18] was
[00:14:19] wondering Wonder should I see if it's a
[00:14:22] Mythic in one of these we pull out a
[00:14:24] Mythic and if we pull out a certain
[00:14:25] amount of mythics in the others maybe
[00:14:27] it'll give you an extra skill point I
[00:14:30] think that might be what I'll do there I
[00:14:31] think might be what I'll do there I'm
[00:14:32] gon to add I'm gonna update a
[00:14:34] rule I'm G to update a
[00:14:37] rule all right that sound good to you
[00:15:00] yeah all right all right I like that
[00:15:01] idea that way we have the packs kind of
[00:15:02] be part of it too I like that idea I'm
[00:15:05] sorry I it took me a little second there
[00:15:07] all right all right all right here we go
[00:15:08] all right there we go so if you get a
[00:15:10] Mythic out of here what we'll end up
[00:15:11] doing is we'll update the uh we'll uh
[00:15:13] we'll do that there oh I got to put this
[00:15:15] in for our um our skills to remove it

[00:39:46] make sure you don't I put them back to
[00:39:48] back so I can put them in a top loader
[00:39:50] for shipping so they don't slide out
[00:39:52] because I'll do this
[00:39:54] here that way they uh you know they kind
[00:39:58] of stay in better and they don't fall
[00:39:59] out as much because you got to give them
[00:40:00] a little tap versus just a push so like
[00:40:02] they they come out but it takes a lot of
[00:40:04] Force if that makes any

[00:46:03] the Retro o and a
[00:46:05] foil mind stab you don't get foils too
[00:46:08] much out of those so you got a foil out

[00:46:31] there I like it a lot I like it a
[00:46:35] lot there we go my friends all righty
[00:46:39] now it looks like Allan may have been
[00:46:41] jumping in to try the adventure there
[00:46:44] for a uh a little trip and now what I'll
[00:46:46] do here I'm going to put the packs back
[00:46:47] up so everybody can see what you're
[00:46:49] doing is you're just bidding up to the
[00:46:51] pack that you want all right and then
[00:46:54] you are going to do this part of the
[00:46:56] adventure where it happens to do some of
[00:46:58] the stuff with the uh with our um
[00:47:03] character
[00:47:05] [Music]
[00:47:07] here all right Allan what would you like
[00:47:10] to go to with your pack here I'm
[00:47:11] guessing it's going to be
[00:47:14] um either
[00:47:18] uh you got wild draft or AFR set is what
[00:47:21] you got here
[00:47:28] one of those two is what I'm
[00:47:31] guessing wow
[00:47:36] draft not
[00:47:38] sure which one would you like to go
[00:47:42] with draft all right get your wild draft
[00:47:45] out let's see what we get you for luck
[00:47:49] my
[00:47:50] friend now see the difference here now
[00:47:53] the reason why we have you guys do this
[00:47:55] cu the point of this is is that if I
[00:47:57] open a pack here I going to put that
[00:47:59] together with your
[00:48:04] stuff screenshot done all
[00:48:10] right forgot to mark all of
[00:48:14] them all right so now the reason why we
[00:48:17] do this is because we open this up and
[00:48:18] if you get a Mythic in this all right
[00:48:21] you actually get a little extra here so
[00:48:23] what'll happen is if you get a Mythic
[00:48:25] out of this you're going to get an extra
[00:48:26] luck
[00:48:27] extra luck means you're going to get a
[00:48:29] roll an extra roll for the
[00:48:33] uh for Englebert trying to open up the
[00:48:36] safe here now to open up the
[00:48:38] safe this is what's going to happen
[00:48:41] we're going to W rip this open we're
[00:48:43] going to see what happens all right
[00:48:44] sound
[00:48:45] good and
[00:48:48] then hopefully we get a Mythic at least
[00:48:51] one maybe we get two cuz if we get two
[00:48:52] mythics I guess it'll be an addition but
[00:48:55] the nice thing is here our character was
[00:48:56] bu with already a luck so that means you
[00:48:59] get one roll plus one because one for
[00:49:01] luck and then you added an addition on
[00:49:04] here if we get uh because of the other
[00:49:07] one here all right so we go one 2 3 4
[00:49:11] five one two three four five if you
[00:49:14] happen to get a Mythic you'll get an
[00:49:16] addition onto this so here we go let's
[00:49:18] see if we can get some luck here we're
[00:49:19] going to zoom zoom
[00:49:20] [Music]
[00:49:23] zoom all right disdainful stroke
[00:49:28] princess takes
[00:49:29] flight hopeless
[00:49:31] nightmare Kell's light blades Jon is
[00:49:34] stop Gap red tooth genealogist cut in
[00:49:39] Titanic growth to unveil guide spell
[00:49:43] stutter stting blade
[00:49:45] assassin Edge wall
[00:49:48] in oo a little L Knights Conquest not
[00:49:52] bad for a little rare on that one and a
[00:49:55] karmic Justice that's a nice little hit
[00:49:58] right
[00:50:00] there and then the last one here is your
[00:50:03] swamp with your wicked
[00:50:06] token you know hey that karmic Justice
[00:50:09] that's nice that's a nice hit there all
[00:50:12] right we're going to do this with your
[00:50:13] rares now no Mythic so that means no
[00:50:16] extra so we're just going to do a
[00:50:18] regular spin a Rolls here but you get to
[00:50:21] decide as a character Englebert what we
[00:50:24] do
[00:50:28] now all right do we try to open the
[00:50:31] safe here all right and you're going to
[00:50:34] have two rolls and an attempt to open
[00:50:36] the safe I will let you know the
[00:50:38] strength of the safe right now after
[00:50:40] we're going to roll here to let you know
[00:50:41] if it's a hard safe an easy safe or
[00:50:44] medium safe now being the first safe you
[00:50:47] get to it's only going to be a medium or
[00:50:49] an easy
[00:50:50] safe so the way we're going to do this
[00:50:53] is I'm going to
[00:50:54] roll here
[00:50:59] and if it is a one through five or a 16
[00:51:04] to 20 it is an easy safe or a 6 to 15 is
[00:51:09] a medium safe all
[00:51:12] right so we have a 20
[00:51:15] again so you have an easy safe all right
[00:51:19] so with an easy safe this is what
[00:51:22] happens 1 to 15 opens the easy safe
[00:51:27] a
[00:51:28] 16 to 20 you either miss or on your last
[00:51:33] turn you break the safe now on your last
[00:51:36] roll you get a choice to try to break
[00:51:39] the safe
[00:51:41] open but if you do that you can make it
[00:51:43] so there safe stays closed forever and
[00:51:45] you never get anything from
[00:51:48] it if you happen to
[00:51:52] roll high enough I'll tell you after
[00:51:54] well I mean it's if you happen to roll
[00:51:56] out of you either get six to 20 cuz it's
[00:51:59] got that's trying to break it open at
[00:52:00] that point so your choices are we're
[00:52:04] going to roll here roll or try to break
[00:52:07] it open
[00:52:10] first roll all
[00:52:13] right you
[00:52:15] got
[00:52:17] 10 so with
[00:52:20] 10 you open the
[00:52:22] safe safe Creeks on open
[00:52:28] inside you see a stack of c a small
[00:52:31] stack of
[00:52:34] caps which is now our pogs by the way
[00:52:37] you see a small stack of
[00:52:40] pogs
[00:52:43] and some ammo for your pistol you now
[00:52:46] have ammo for your rusty pistol now it's
[00:52:49] not a lot of
[00:52:50] ammo it is only six
[00:52:53] shots all right
[00:53:03] all right
[00:53:05] now so you now have all that that's
[00:53:09] awesome you now decide you pick those
[00:53:13] up you wander out of that house you're
[00:53:15] going hey buddy that's sweet we just got
[00:53:17] some extra stuff I actually now I'm
[00:53:18] going to try to shoot with this pistol
[00:53:19] we can see what's going on maybe this
[00:53:21] will help me out you got you can be up
[00:53:22] front maybe take care of stuff I'll be
[00:53:24] all in back shooting and stuff like that
[00:53:26] that'll work out I think pretty well you
[00:53:28] know sweet goes you know what that's
[00:53:30] okay that sounds pretty good I think
[00:53:31] that's a good idea here so you start
[00:53:33] wandering through the Wasteland again
[00:53:34] following that smell to the
[00:53:36] West as you get a little bit closer you
[00:53:39] see uh there a you see something in the
[00:53:41] distance you're not sure is this
[00:53:42] something good something bad you're not
[00:53:43] sure you're getting closer to it goes
[00:53:46] behind a big rock in the distance all
[00:53:48] right whatever keep wandering towards it
[00:53:50] not really sure exactly what it is but
[00:53:52] you need to go to the West though
[00:53:54] because that's where sweet says the
[00:53:55] smells drifting from now as the further
[00:53:58] you go to the West there oh
[00:54:00] no out from
[00:54:05] behind giant rock it was not just one
[00:54:08] that you think you saw but
[00:54:11] two
[00:54:14] Raiders that's what it was that you saw
[00:54:18] there
[00:54:21] now we are going to have it done this
[00:54:24] way being that they're are two
[00:54:26] characters two of you can jump in to
[00:54:30] play each character
[00:54:32] or you either jump in to play one
[00:54:34] character and I'll play the second one
[00:54:36] or I'll have one of my kids come over
[00:54:37] and play the second one that type of
[00:54:38] thing to fight our Raiders all right I'm
[00:54:41] going to start this off and remember
[00:54:42] everybody just pick up whatever packs
[00:54:43] you want
[00:54:45] there but pay up to the packs that you
[00:54:47] want that you see on

[01:04:39] here we go
[01:04:41] Allan you see those Raiders jump out
[01:04:44] they think they're going to surprise you
[01:04:47] but you saw them already in a distance
[01:04:49] they jump out in front of you these two
[01:04:51] Raiders the first Raider is wearing
[01:04:53] leather has a helmet on like hockey
[01:04:56] helmet like a hockey goalie helmet on
[01:04:57] mask on hockey goalie mask on like a hel
[01:04:59] but more of a helmet helmet ones not
[01:05:02] just the masks not the old school mask
[01:05:03] more like the new one new helmet ones
[01:05:06] all right it's got one of those on
[01:05:08] second one jumps out all they're wearing
[01:05:11] is leather
[01:05:12] underwear swinging two
[01:05:16] machetes all right now the one with the
[01:05:18] helmet has a
[01:05:19] rifle you
[01:05:23] currently is this what you have with
[01:05:25] your characters so what are you going to
[01:05:27] do here I'm going to give you the first
[01:05:29] choice Allan you get the First Choice
[01:05:36] Allen shoot you're going to shoot the
[01:05:39] first one all right now the first one
[01:05:42] now you shoot is the first thing you're
[01:05:43] going to do all right we're going to
[01:05:44] roll to see if you shoot and what when
[01:05:47] you shoot what part you're going to hit
[01:05:49] all right cuz we're going to say when
[01:05:50] you shoot the first thing you do being
[01:05:52] uh with the rusty being at the rusty gun
[01:05:55] we you do have to roll to see if you hit
[01:05:57] now being a rusty gun it is not as high
[01:06:00] and normal as not a problem with it as
[01:06:03] you normally would because normally it
[01:06:04] would be like you you have to roll uh an
[01:06:07] 18 or a a 19 or a 20 to see if that the
[01:06:10] jams but because it's Rusty it's going
[01:06:12] to be a 17 to 20 to see if you have a
[01:06:15] problem with the shooting if it jams or
[01:06:17] if it shoots all
[01:06:20] right all right good you got 15 it
[01:06:22] shoots we're good it shoots
[01:06:26] now we're going to see what part of the
[01:06:28] body it hits the part of the body it
[01:06:31] hits is going to be for our
[01:06:35] Raider going to roll this in the Raider
[01:06:39] is 1 to six for the body 7 to 10 for the
[01:06:41] head the limb is 11 to
[01:06:44] 17 and you
[01:06:46] miss if you do an 18 or a
[01:06:49] 20 all right so you got
[01:06:53] 14 all right which is is a limb you get
[01:06:57] to choose which
[01:06:59] limb all right Allan you get to choose
[01:07:01] which limb on the Raider that you hit
[01:07:07] for
[01:07:09] two Health points which the Raiders are
[01:07:12] only ever at Six Health points right arm
[01:07:16] you get it's right arm all right right
[01:07:18] arm is
[01:07:21] it to all right now that is going to
[01:07:24] immobilize the right arm with two of
[01:07:26] them all right so he's not going to be
[01:07:27] able to shoot anymore it's a good idea
[01:07:28] Allan I like
[01:07:33] it all right here we go
[01:07:37] now it is going to be uh I'm going to
[01:07:39] end up going because they're flustered
[01:07:41] with what happen there so I'm going to
[01:07:42] roll myself now I'm going to try to do
[01:07:44] some Vines all right we're going to
[01:07:46] throw some Vines out and I'm going to
[01:07:47] try to control the other guy with my
[01:07:48] Vines here and grab him by the legs so
[01:07:50] he can't keep running at us that's what
[01:07:52] I'm going to do there so that's what I'm
[01:07:54] going to do with mine and I'm going to
[01:07:55] CH that and by doing that I either am
[01:07:57] going to be able to do it with I control
[01:07:59] them with a 16 up to
[01:08:02] 16 um I will control him or uh I mean up
[01:08:07] to 15 I'll control him 16 to 20 is a
[01:08:12] Miss 11 11
[01:08:16] nice the person with the swords is
[01:08:20] immobilized all right Raider with the
[01:08:23] swords is immobilized
[01:08:28] they can't do anything if you unless you
[01:08:29] get close to
[01:08:31] them all right they can still swing
[01:08:33] their um Vines their uh their their
[01:08:35] machetes just can't do anything other
[01:08:37] than swing the machetes all right now
[01:08:39] you're at that stage
[01:08:42] now the
[01:08:44] uh
[01:08:46] Raider with the gun we have to allow
[01:08:48] them at least to attempt to shoot it all
[01:08:51] right they try to shoot the
[01:08:52] gun now being the fact that they only
[01:08:55] have one
[01:08:56] arm a successful shot being heav without
[01:08:59] the gun jamming or having a problem with
[01:09:01] the gun is going to be um only an 18 to
[01:09:07] 20 because they have one arm missing all
[01:09:09] right one arm they trying this with one
[01:09:11] arm here and it's a rifle if it was a
[01:09:12] pistol it would be
[01:09:15] different oh my oh my 19 look at that
[01:09:20] they got the shot
[01:09:21] off oh my now that shot off
[01:09:27] William does it hit you know what
[01:09:29] actually we're going to roll this way
[01:09:30] we're going to roll it's going to be a
[01:09:31] 50/50 we're going to go 1 to 10 it hits
[01:09:35] angelbert 11 to 20 it hits sweet B
[01:09:40] bage one to 10 it hit angelbert
[01:09:43] angelbert no no angelbert it hits you
[01:09:46] you're now back down you've knocked
[01:09:48] yourself down to 10 strength because it
[01:09:49] hit you hit you in your shoulder luckily
[01:09:52] you're able to dodge it a little bit but
[01:09:54] that does mean you're a little bit sore
[01:09:56] in your arm there and you're having a
[01:09:57] hard
[01:09:58] time so angelbert is now your turn what
[01:10:02] are you going to do are you going to
[01:10:04] shoot or you going to try to uh go
[01:10:06] towards them and do something with your
[01:10:09] uh your sword that you have there now
[01:10:11] here's um your adventure characters
[01:10:13] again so you see
[01:10:15] everything pull the sword to attack I
[01:10:17] like it so you pull the sword out to
[01:10:19] attack you go up to them now the attack
[01:10:22] on the sword is pretty much like a
[01:10:24] guaranteed hit it's very very very SL
[01:10:27] small chance of um of missing okay is a
[01:10:32] uh 19 and 20 you have to do to miss when
[01:10:37] you swing your sword it is your body you
[01:10:39] hit one to six head 7 to 10 limb is 11
[01:10:43] to 18 and then 19 and 20 is you miss so
[01:10:47] you swing your mighty sword at them
[01:10:50] 14 you hit their limb which limb are you
[01:10:53] going to hit
[01:10:59] Allen left arm Oh no you're going have
[01:11:02] this is Black Knight all of a sudden
[01:11:04] I'll bite your ankles I'm
[01:11:08] sorry all right anyways
[01:11:11] um he's now got no left arm because you
[01:11:15] have two you have an extra hit point
[01:11:17] every time with your Mythic so you swing
[01:11:19] and your sword actually has an extra hit
[01:11:21] point on there because it is a sword all
[01:11:25] right
[01:11:25] that sword gives you plus one in your
[01:11:27] attack so you have an extra hit point
[01:11:29] there so that you completely take off
[01:11:31] its arm you've now knocked that one down
[01:11:33] from four strength down three with no
[01:11:39] left
[01:11:40] arm to one strength
[01:11:44] left all right that's that one Raider
[01:11:48] there you run out to all right look at
[01:11:50] that one you run out to them they have
[01:11:52] nothing they're they're bleeding out
[01:11:53] they're having a hard time
[01:11:56] now
[01:11:58] Groot our Our sweet's Revenge I mean our
[01:12:00] sweet's
[01:12:01] revenge our sweet vinage
[01:12:05] decides they're going to spike out one
[01:12:09] of their Vines towards the Raider that
[01:12:12] is immobilized because they only get one
[01:12:14] turn of immobilization for the Raider
[01:12:16] end they'll be let go because as soon as
[01:12:17] they spike out to hit them they're no
[01:12:19] longer mobilized so you spike out to hit
[01:12:21] them and it's going to be same thing you
[01:12:24] either get a uh when it spikes out it's
[01:12:26] either be one to 15 it hits them to take
[01:12:28] one Health away or it is a uh is a five
[01:12:33] uh 16 to 20 you hit him it misses so we
[01:12:36] have the vine there hits him takes one
[01:12:39] Health away for that other Raider there
[01:12:40] we go minus one they are at 6 minus one
[01:12:43] there so at five but they are no longer
[01:12:45] immobilized with their two
[01:12:47] machetes now you're one with the uh no
[01:12:49] arms can't really do anything it tries
[01:12:51] to bite your ankles goes I'm going to
[01:12:54] bite your ankles it leans over to bite
[01:12:56] your ankles and that chance of hiting
[01:12:58] your ankles and causing damage it has to
[01:13:00] get a 20 it has got to get a 20 and able
[01:13:03] to bite your en able in order to be able
[01:13:05] to bite your ankles and cause any
[01:13:07] damage so it rolls and you got a 13
[01:13:10] there's no ankle bage going on your
[01:13:13] character is
[01:13:15] there he's fine he's back now we're
[01:13:18] going to start this up again remember
[01:13:19] everybody you do have all the mystery
[01:13:20] bags that you can jump in on while we're
[01:13:22] going through the adventure here that's
[01:13:23] kind of why we do the adventure or we
[01:13:24] can buy anything from the store and
[01:13:26] we'll rip that stuff open all right so
[01:13:29] he
[01:13:30] misses one with the machetes now is free
[01:13:33] but has one damage against it and it
[01:13:35] decides to swing now it's going to go
[01:13:37] 50/50 is it going to swing at angelbert
[01:13:40] or is it going to swing at oh looks like
[01:13:42] it's swing at Englebert right there
[01:13:44] because it got one there you go one to
[01:13:46] 10 was Englebert Englebert is swung at
[01:13:50] and angle
[01:13:52] Bert
[01:13:54] is seven that was angle bird is
[01:13:58] hit let's see where angle bird hits
[01:14:03] you
[01:14:04] angle he lands a hit on you one hit
[01:14:08] doesn't matter where it's just one

[01:46:44] to roll and we're going to do a 50/50
[01:46:47] for attacking or run away from the gator

[01:48:24] think if I have anything else but the um
[01:48:25] homelands I never really put out no one

[01:48:29] to put out the

[02:00:01] coming
[02:00:02] up
[02:00:06] is Allan you want some some of that
[02:00:09] tyclone I can um I can figure out what
[02:00:12] the price is cuz I completely haven't
[02:00:13] even done anything on those yet cuz I
[02:00:14] got them in yesterday and I haven't I
[02:00:17] just haven't really had a chance to go
[02:00:18] through them
[02:00:19] yet do I have any more of the just add
[02:00:22] milk I actually do believe I have some
[02:00:24] more just add milk uh let me let me take
[02:00:27] a look all
[02:00:32] right and for
[02:00:34] this we
[02:00:38] have the Ghost Rider Rides Again that's
[02:00:41] your POG you got on the back it says
[02:00:44] number 66 you got number
[02:00:49] 66 all righty number 66 it
[02:00:54] is here we
[02:00:58] go yeah I'll check right after this all
[02:01:00] right Bud number
[02:01:03] 66 here we
[02:01:08] go you have gotten the Serge foil River
[02:01:14] Song and I am sorry that was like one of
[02:01:20] the ones that was not that was it was
[02:01:22] close to a ceiling but not not
[02:01:25] exactly I mean close to it but not
[02:01:27] exactly oh [ __ ] again it fell it's a
[02:01:31] nice card it's a very good card but I
[02:01:33] think it might have dropped a little bit
[02:01:34] recently so let me just double check
[02:01:36] because I realized some of those have
[02:01:38] dropped recently and I don't want to
[02:01:39] screw you out of something so I might
[02:01:41] give you like something extra just
[02:01:44] because if that price has dropped a lot
[02:01:46] somebody said to me some of the Doctor
[02:01:48] Who Stu dropped a lot and I feel bad if
[02:01:50] that would have dropped a ton compared
[02:01:52] to what I had initially priced it at so
[02:01:54] let me just like let me just like double
[02:01:55] check on that quickly I don't want to
[02:01:58] like I said I don't want to feel bad
[02:01:59] like I'm screwing someone so I realize
[02:02:01] that sometimes those things fluctuate so
[02:02:03] let me just double check
[02:02:05] quickly cuz that was in there and I
[02:02:07] built that b uh that thing a little
[02:02:09] while ago so let me just be
[02:02:11] uh let me just check that I think it's
[02:02:14] the same price and you're
[02:02:16] good but I want to double check
[02:02:30] oh no it's the same it's it's there
[02:02:32] we're good we're good it's not bad it's
[02:02:34] not bad we're good sorry just wanted to
[02:02:36] double check you're good still $26 card
[02:02:39] so a little a little bit less than the
[02:02:40] 27 you you would have could have spent
[02:02:42] there but you got your money back
[02:02:44] because you only spent 25 on them
[02:02:47] anyways so here you
[02:02:50] go nice surge foil I just wanted to
[02:02:52] double check I didn't want to feel it CU
[02:02:54] every now and again I'm like a [ __ ] that
[02:02:55] dropped a lot that I
[02:02:59] know nice yeah
[02:03:03] nice all righty let me
[02:03:11] uh let me check for that
[02:03:13] um just add milk for you after I get
[02:03:16] Allen stuff put
[02:03:20] away you get that pog there
[02:03:24] too nice Little River Song surge foil

[02:03:36] only like $10 like what are you talking
[02:03:38] about this card was like a $30 card I'm
[02:03:39] like oh son of a [ __ ] it dropped so
[02:03:41] that's why every now and again I like to
[02:03:42] go and double check just to make sure
[02:03:44] and it was a doctor who won so that's
[02:03:46] why I wanted to double
[02:03:49] check I don't want to I don't know I try
[02:03:51] to be as honest and fair as I can you

[02:04:22] been in I just want to make sure it
[02:04:23] wouldn't have been anything else before

[02:17:38] I wasn't prepared to put everything in
[02:17:40] so just give me one minute here I can
[02:17:41] figure that out for you
[02:18:07] all right those would
[02:18:10] be 95 for artist
[02:18:14] series Ravina
[02:18:18] foil points of interest
[02:18:22] points of
[02:18:32] interest that one would
[02:18:40] be point of Interest non
[02:18:43] foil would
[02:18:46] be 80 for point of Interest nonfoil
[02:19:01] and then point of Interest rainbow
[02:19:06] foil would end up being 100 what
[02:19:10] is who's calling
[02:19:17] me freaking spam stop it so that's what
[02:19:21] that would end up being let me know if
[02:19:22] you want any of
[02:19:30] those did I miss
[02:19:34] something it's actually
[02:19:37] so I might have miss
[02:19:44] something let me do that here and just
[02:19:46] do this actually I'm going to do this
[02:19:48] quickly that way I have written down
[02:19:58] put that on them that way I know what
[02:19:59] price they are they've been at at least
[02:20:02] so I'm not going crazy when I'm looking
[02:20:03] at
[02:20:14] things

[02:29:13] Mage rituals is one of the command Zone
[02:29:15] one of the battlefield you may pay one
[02:29:17] oh wow Leia Arc Mage rist nice I like
[02:29:20] that art that's very pretty on the side
[02:29:22] and everything there legendary that's
[02:29:24] actually really
[02:29:26] cool ather
[02:29:28] vile I like that too that's a really
[02:29:31] cool Aether vial I might actually end up
[02:29:33] keeping one of these sets then for
[02:29:35] myself is that crooked that looks really
[02:29:39] crooked by the way you notice
[02:29:46] that yeah the art the art are cool
[02:29:49] Carter cards may not be the best but the
[02:29:51] art is nice but they're cards that you
[02:29:53] can use all the time you know what I
[02:29:54] mean you're going to use a lot of these
[02:29:56] in every deck they might High math
[02:29:58] worthy cards but they are a lot they
[02:29:59] using decks on a regular basis Arcane
[02:30:03] Signet nice art on that one
[02:30:06] too that one looks crooked also the
[02:30:08] other one didn't the first one didn't
[02:30:10] but that one looks kind of crooked in
[02:30:11] here also maybe it's meant to look like
[02:30:14] that maybe it's meant to mess with you
[02:30:16] because of the art and everything like
[02:30:17] it's a poster
[02:30:20] yeah I think that's meant to sword of
[02:30:22] the amth am
[02:30:24] armist armor amoris armor armorist I
[02:30:28] can't
[02:30:30] remember nice sword oh that's that's
[02:30:33] awesome order on that one too oh this
[02:30:34] art is yeah you're right very pretty art
[02:30:37] here I know you might have to make an
[02:30:40] elano deck yeah
[02:30:42] Ina deck in your Arcane sign I thought
[02:30:46] there was an Arcane signant back here
[02:30:53] did they give you two Arcane
[02:30:56] signets instead of another
[02:31:02] card they just gave you a second Arcane
[02:31:05] but they're
[02:31:06] like slightly different
[02:31:10] colored which is weird one's 1641 and
[02:31:14] one's
[02:31:18] 820 what's the difference there
[02:31:20] I'm lost right now is that is that like
[02:31:23] a big thing right now I don't know what
[02:31:25] that means I'm sorry I will admit I
[02:31:27] don't know what that
[02:31:31] means different foil treatment yeah what
[02:31:34] they're different cards they're
[02:31:36] different arts on them one's like a
[02:31:37] sketch almost one's like the Finish
[02:31:39] thing it kind of seems like if that
[02:31:41] makes any sense like that kind of looks
[02:31:43] like a sketch where that looks like the
[02:31:44] finished
[02:31:51] oh okay it's done like that on purpose
[02:31:52] okay cool I was like that's interesting
[02:31:54] I didn't know you got two of them like
[02:31:56] that but yeah look at that's pretty
[02:31:57] sweet though like you can see like the
[02:31:59] difference is like it was sketching it
[02:32:00] out to get it to work to make it that's
[02:32:02] kind of
[02:32:06] cool oh it's a bonus okay I didn't know
[02:32:11] that so this is like a is this like a
[02:32:13] special bonus
[02:32:18] then I was unaware of
[02:32:24] that all right let me get these in
[02:32:26] sleeves though we want to get all this

[02:38:06] water when uproll
[02:38:09] that Gator
[02:38:11] dowo
[02:38:13] so I was doing this here I was
[02:38:15] organizing things a little bit nicer to
[02:38:17] make them look nicer for you I think so

[02:38:35] this why not we'll do that
[02:38:39] again yeah maybe you want to go for a
[02:38:41] little roll with the gator dowo see what
[02:38:44] happens are you going to come out and
[02:38:45] beat the gator dowo help out are you

[02:38:57] bage let's find out and if not we'll
[02:38:59] have uh I'll end up doing it myself and
[02:39:01] going through it and see what happens
[02:39:02] maybe I'll ask you in the in the uh chat
[02:39:04] here for some guidance on what I should
[02:39:06] do you know that can happen too you know
[02:39:08] maybe I'll ask for some guidance on what
[02:39:10] I'm going to do from you
[02:39:11] all we'll find out
[02:39:21] all right I'm just putting all my
[02:39:23] character stuff here together so that
[02:39:25] you can actually see them a little B
[02:39:26] better I think I think this is going to
[02:39:27] look a little bit nicer when I put it in
[02:39:28] this
[02:39:32] way definitely think it's going to look
[02:39:34] better when I put it that
[02:39:36] way I think that's everything in
[02:39:40] it that's currently where we're
[02:39:47] at that's where you started your
[02:39:49] character is at there we go actually I
[02:39:51] think that's going to look a little bit
[02:39:52] better for you all to see it's going to
[02:39:54] be cleaner
[02:39:58] looking all right let me do that for a
[02:40:12] screenshot that one for the screenshot
[02:40:14] and we'll change it we're going to
[02:40:16] change that and that way maybe you guys
[02:40:18] will jump in yeah remember you guys can
[02:40:19] jump in on these and buy up to whatever
[02:40:22] you want that's what they I have that
[02:40:24] showing there so you see how much the
[02:40:25] price is and you just pay up to whatever
[02:40:27] you buy up to whatever you want for uh
[02:40:30] to be in and jump in as a character and
[02:40:32] if you're the first one you get to pick
[02:40:33] the first character you're part of or
[02:40:35] which character you want to be here I'm
[02:40:38] going to do this because I just made a
[02:40:39] change and I think this will look a
[02:40:40] little better for
[02:40:42] you I think that's going to be a little
[02:40:44] easier for you all to
[02:40:47] see who your characters are
[02:40:52] move that up a little bit move that up a
[02:40:54] little bit there we go there I think
[02:40:57] that's pretty
[02:40:59] good see if anybody wants to do that now
[02:41:02] that we have fully out there you see
[02:41:05] what your characters are you can either
[02:41:07] be Englebert or sweet
[02:41:09] vinage who are you going to be on your
[02:41:11] on this you just pay up all you got to
[02:41:13] do is buy up to the packs that you want
[02:41:15] so say right now it's at $6 you buy you
[02:41:17] just run in at $6 it's going to be Wild
[02:41:19] Well drain or an AFR set which I need to
[02:41:22] take out actually we are out of AFR set
[02:41:24] give me one second I need to take that
[02:41:26] out of
[02:41:33] there actually need to take AFR set
[02:41:40] out and I have to readjust that one but
[02:41:43] that's okay that'll pop up very easily
[02:41:55] here we go move that there
[02:41:58] [Music]
[02:41:59] there there and I just need to do this
[02:42:01] quickly make an
[02:42:04] adjustment because we ran out of some of
[02:42:06] the other packs as we've been going on
[02:42:08] here so I want to make sure everything's
[02:42:09] accurate for you right want to make sure
[02:42:12] it's all
[02:42:15] accurate
[02:42:17] there all right no one want to jump in
[02:42:19] on the uh on that there maybe maybe guys
[02:42:23] uh all right then so what it will be is
[02:42:26] I'm going to roll the first one here and
[02:42:28] I'm going to see what character I'm
[02:42:29] going to be is either be 1 through 10 is
[02:42:30] I'm going to be angelbert or uh 11
[02:42:34] through 20 will be um I will be the
[02:42:36] other character of
[02:42:39] sweet all right I am sweet right now
[02:42:42] we're going to run one more time here
[02:42:44] see if anybody wants to be
[02:42:49] one of the other characters if you want
[02:42:50] to be angelbert would you like to be
[02:42:52] angelbert right
[02:42:54] now I'm now going to take a drink out of
[02:42:56] some liquid here as we go through the
[02:42:58] adventure remember everybody just buy up
[02:43:00] to what you want those are the
[02:43:01] characters that we're at at the moment
[02:43:03] for our current adventurers that are
[02:43:04] hanging out with us are you going to be
[02:43:12] Englebert all
[02:43:13] righty looks like we may uh I may be
[02:43:16] playing by myself but that's okay
[02:43:20] I'll be uh I'll be angelbert and sweet
[02:43:23] we'll see what happens because I'll just
[02:43:24] go until the end of the stream here and
[02:43:26] uh at the end of the stream I'll do our
[02:43:28] giveaway um but at the moment we'll do
[02:43:31] um I guess I'll keep doing this myself
[02:43:33] for you
[02:43:35] all for your entertainment value and now
[02:43:39] I do have some um secret layer my family
[02:43:42] had been saving for ourselves to open so
[02:43:44] maybe we'll open some of that when my
[02:43:45] wife gets back from her stuff that she's
[02:43:47] doing but I do have to head out here a
[02:43:49] little bit later today because my son
[02:43:50] has a soccer game so I'll be on for a
[02:43:52] little while but I'll be heading out at
[02:43:53] some point here oh we have one punch man
[02:43:56] is winning going with pack up there all
[02:44:00] righty one punch man is winning going
[02:44:02] with now I'm guessing one punch man is
[02:44:04] going to get a lord of the ring special
[02:44:07] edition am I guessing that correct
[02:44:21] have any midnight hunt I do not have any
[02:44:23] midnight hunt I am sorry on that um I
[02:44:26] have in the past but I haven't gotten
[02:44:27] any recently okay so you have your
[02:44:29] choice right here is two on the right
[02:44:32] and three on the left which pack would
[02:44:34] you like to go with one punch
[02:44:47] man back left all righty back left one
[02:44:51] right here now the way we do this is
[02:44:55] whenever you get a pack we open that
[02:44:57] pack up before we start our battle
[02:44:59] because being a commander collector
[02:45:02] booster if you end up
[02:45:09] getting um two mythics in here you get
[02:45:15] one
[02:45:17] extra on your hit point all right so
[02:45:20] currently you are at three extra on your
[02:45:24] hit point two extra on your hit point
[02:45:27] because you got this and let's open this
[02:45:29] up and we'll see if we can get any
[02:45:30] extras so we get maybe three extras for
[02:45:31] your hit points what do you think one
[02:45:34] punch maybe get a couple mythics in here
[02:45:36] and get you three extra that sound
[02:45:39] good I'm guessing we're open it yeah
[02:45:41] yeah all right yeah going open that up
[02:45:44] we're get we're going at least a couple
[02:45:45] mythics so we can have three extra for
[02:45:48] our hit points right body
[02:45:50] Englebert all right here we go good luck
[02:45:52] my friend and we're going to zoom zoom
[02:45:55] zoom all right there breaking of the
[02:45:59] fellowship Sam's desperate

[02:46:44] Surge hoil and then a Souls attendant
[02:46:48] for in a food surge foil gladel
[02:46:52] dismissal is a nice hit rate there but
[02:46:54] we did not get any mythics in our pack
[02:46:58] here we did not get any mythics in our
[02:47:00] pack here so we are at just plus two on
[02:47:04] our character for their hit points
[02:47:07] because of one punch man all right now
[02:47:09] one punch
[02:47:12] man you were paying attention and you
[02:47:16] saw the gator Dow roll up
[02:47:20] that Gator Dow rolls
[02:47:22] up opens out into his full form you see
[02:47:26] its gaping ma growling at
[02:47:29] you and
[02:47:31] hissing whipping its tail back and
[02:47:34] forth with its armored
[02:47:37] body now your choice
[02:47:40] is do
[02:47:43] we
[02:47:46] attack or do we run away one punch
[02:47:49] man I'm guessing you were going to
[02:47:51] attack since you gave him extra
[02:48:01] strength and you're going to have some
[02:48:02] more all right we're going to
[02:48:07] attack most of the time people here
[02:48:09] attack all right now that you're
[02:48:11] attacking one punch man
[02:48:14] you get to roll first cuz you were
[02:48:17] paying attention so you're actually
[02:48:18] going to get to go first to try to see
[02:48:20] what happens here saping is going to be
[02:48:21] the I mean um not sap our weedling
[02:48:24] weedling is going to be the uh going
[02:48:26] third cuz they weren't paying attention
[02:48:28] CU they were taking a drink out of the
[02:48:29] water all right so now your character
[02:48:34] I'm going to run uh I'll run this here
[02:48:35] for like 30 minutes that way people have
[02:48:37] a bunch of time if they want to all
[02:48:39] right and I run that one here
[02:48:49] all right here we go so here you go your
[02:48:51] character let me get the book up here so
[02:48:53] I can tell you exactly what's going
[02:48:57] on you decide to fight and attack I want
[02:49:01] to make sure I have the right there
[02:49:02] Gator
[02:49:03] dowo now you decide to attack you have
[02:49:07] two extra for your hit points so I'm
[02:49:09] going to put your characters up here
[02:49:10] we're going to put our characters up
[02:49:11] here all right so you're at 13 the gator
[02:49:14] Dow comes out and he has a nine strength
[02:49:17] on the gator Dow all right got nine
[02:49:19] strength on Gator dowo now Mike just so
[02:49:21] you know you just bit up to whatever
[02:49:22] packs you want to get all right so you
[02:49:24] should be able to see them in the um the
[02:49:26] picture there you just bid to whatever
[02:49:27] pack you want so you're fighting in this
[02:49:29] Gator Dow you
[02:49:30] roll the gator de has nine you're going
[02:49:32] to roll here we're going to see where
[02:49:33] you hit on them number three you hit for
[02:49:36] the Gator Dow you swing and you hit its
[02:49:38] body with it hitting its body you have a
[02:49:42] plus one two three so that is a four hit
[02:49:47] to its body because the extra that you
[02:49:48] got there so that Gator dowo goes from
[02:49:53] nine minus four down to five for at
[02:49:56] Health there that's a nice swing on that
[02:49:59] now that Gator Dill's kicked off now
[02:50:02] gator Gill is really mad Gator dowo
[02:50:06] does a four believe that's four yep
[02:50:10] that's four Gator dowo
[02:50:14] bites all right the gator dowo bites you
[02:50:19] at you with its gaping maw because you
[02:50:21] are the one that hit him and it's two
[02:50:23] damage that is done to you all right you
[02:50:25] have got two Damage Done to from that
[02:50:27] Gator Dill you are now down from
[02:50:30] 13 minus
[02:50:33] 2 to 11 Health all right so you got to
[02:50:36] be careful
[02:50:37] here your buddy though s your buddy
[02:50:40] sweet realizes you know what I've been
[02:50:41] drinking over here now Mike I'm going to
[02:50:45] ask you a
[02:50:46] question would you like to tap take over
[02:50:50] cuz I was going to play our buddy sweet
[02:50:53] vinage would you like to take over for
[02:50:55] sweet vinage and uh try to play them or
[02:50:58] you want to wait till the next thing to
[02:50:59] go to the next one it's your choice give
[02:51:01] you one second here because I just need
[02:51:02] to take a drink that's why I asked
[02:51:16] that all right
[02:51:19] I am going to oh you're back I'm back
[02:51:21] you're back I'm going to roll for sweet
[02:51:24] vinage sweet vinage decides that they're
[02:51:27] going to attempt to do an immobilized
[02:51:30] now immobilized they sit their V they
[02:51:32] sweep they they shoot out their Vines
[02:51:35] grab the character by the by the legs so
[02:51:38] they can't move around giving it making
[02:51:39] it easier for you to hit them and they
[02:51:41] can't attack anyone else either because
[02:51:42] they're immobilized now for immobilized
[02:51:44] you either get one up to 15 is
[02:51:47] immobilized 16 and above you
[02:51:50] don't all right 12 you have immobilized
[02:51:53] the character this is wonderful you have
[02:51:55] immobilized the character well sweet
[02:51:58] sweet has immobilized the character
[02:52:00] angelbert is going to swing it's a
[02:52:03] mighty ax at H sword at them now are you
[02:52:05] going to shoot or you going to attack
[02:52:07] with your
[02:52:09] sword because he ran right up next to
[02:52:11] you now that he's immobilized you have
[02:52:13] the option if you want to back up and
[02:52:15] shoot or to swing your sword again
[02:52:20] and see what happens you're going to
[02:52:22] shoot all right you're going to back up
[02:52:23] and shoot one punch backs up now when
[02:52:27] you shoot it is a rusty pistol as you
[02:52:30] see with only 12 bullets when you hit it
[02:52:34] depending on where you hit it if it hits
[02:52:35] his head two body one for damage okay so
[02:52:41] you back up you take a shot now with the
[02:52:44] rusty with the rusty gun the only
[02:52:46] problem is you have each time the rusty
[02:52:48] gun is shot you have a 50/50 chance it's
[02:52:50] going to it's going to jam so we got to
[02:52:52] roll for that jam
[02:52:54] chance it has not jammed you got a five
[02:52:57] between one and 10 is not jamming so you
[02:53:00] shoot now you shoot and we're going to
[02:53:02] see where you hit on this
[02:53:05] character you've gotten a 14 for the
[02:53:10] Gator Dow and with the gator Dow at 14
[02:53:14] you have hit its head wonderful
[02:53:19] you shot the gator Dow in the head
[02:53:21] bringing it down
[02:53:23] to three
[02:53:27] strength and it is still immobilized
[02:53:30] three health and it is still immobilized
[02:53:32] wonderful it's still immobilized
[02:53:35] as as myself as sweet I'm going to roll
[02:53:39] again and I'm try to keep it immobilized
[02:53:41] this time all right that's what we're
[02:53:42] going to do I'm going to try to keep it
[02:53:44] immobilized because it can't do anything
[02:53:46] right now and you back up and you're
[02:53:47] away from it it's stuck there number two
[02:53:50] great it is still immobilized wonderful
[02:53:53] sweet still has it immobilized what are
[02:53:55] you going to do one punch are you going
[02:53:57] to shoot or you going to go after it
[02:53:59] with your
[02:54:04] sword CM demoy what you up to my
[02:54:07] friend sword all right you run up to it
[02:54:10] you swing your mighty sword and you hit
[02:54:14] it
[02:54:16] 17 which is
[02:54:21] the tail you take your mighty sword
[02:54:24] swing at its tail and you are with your
[02:54:29] three extra you hit it with four you hit
[02:54:31] it in the
[02:54:34] tail with four chop his tail off it
[02:54:39] starts to bleed out all over the
[02:54:42] place and there's immobilized still from
[02:54:46] sweet vinage and now that is bled out
[02:54:49] you now get to rumage through that body
[02:54:53] now one punch you get One Last Choice
[02:54:57] here are you going
[02:54:59] to attempt to skin the
[02:55:02] body and take its um shell as
[02:55:07] armor or are you going to just try to
[02:55:11] take what's on it which could be a gun
[02:55:15] or it could
[02:55:16] be a um
[02:55:18] POG pogs for um for
[02:55:22] money and take that because you only get
[02:55:24] one choice because if you try to skin it
[02:55:26] you lose what's inside of
[02:55:33] it but if you skin it successfully you
[02:55:36] get its armor and it's a 50/50 on
[02:55:38] skinning it successfully but each time
[02:55:40] you skin the better chance you get at
[02:55:43] getting armor or something from
[02:55:45] something what do you want to do my
[02:55:47] friend
[02:55:51] you've got a
[02:55:54] choice you going to loot it all right
[02:55:56] you loot it and that's great you decide
[02:55:59] I'm going to loot this I already got a
[02:56:00] little bit of armor I'm okay it was only
[02:56:02] going to add one one to my my uh maybe
[02:56:04] to my armor there I'm not too worried
[02:56:06] about that so there we go you now get

[03:16:38] sweet dude all right so hey let me get
[03:16:41] let me get this straight here this is
[03:16:42] why I try to explain to all you
[03:16:44] everybody that when anybody they they
[03:16:45] see my games I don't do anything to do
[03:16:48] anything to screw anyone most of the
[03:16:50] time if you buy multiple things you come
[03:16:51] out with some good luck now I've been
[03:16:54] waiting for the since like the last
[03:16:56] probably
[03:16:57] um I don't know three packs
[03:17:01] here to see uh the the last probably
[03:17:04] since 10 of those boxes to see who was
[03:17:06] going to buy them because that Wasteland
[03:17:08] card and the The Collector boosters were
[03:17:12] straight out get your money back and no
[03:17:15] one did it with 10 them and I'm sitting
[03:17:18] there because the commander collector
[03:17:20] boosters and themselves are
[03:17:24] um
[03:17:26] $60 then the other thing was 80 and
[03:17:29] people like oh I'm not sure then you get
[03:17:30] any other packs on top of it I'm like
[03:17:33] there's 10 boxes there if you buy those
[03:17:35] you're making your money back and then
[03:17:36] you figured it out at five I'm like oh
[03:17:39] my God somebody finally figured it out
[03:17:47] it took someone a while though it took
[03:17:48] someone a while that's all I'll
[03:17:54] say thank you Tylo I appreciate it I
[03:17:57] appreciate it a lot help me close that
[03:18:00] box that uh that game out and you got
[03:18:02] yourself some good stuff I'm going to
[03:18:05] get you a bag for those there though
[03:18:08] going to put that in a separate
[03:18:10] bag that's the camera again
[03:18:20] yeah see like when I build games I
[03:18:22] generally build them where it's I am
[03:18:24] going to either Break Even or not make a
[03:18:26] ton of money because the whole point of
[03:18:27] what I do this is generally to the whole
[03:18:29] point the reason I started this was to
[03:18:31] do a YouTube channel which is why we had
[03:18:32] the follow us on YouTube um things we
[03:18:35] haven't put a lot of effort into it
[03:18:37] recently because of some changes in life
[03:18:38] that's been going on but uh like the
[03:18:40] past week but um I think I'll start
[03:18:42] putting some more effort into it this
[03:18:43] week coming up here but there you go my
[03:18:45] friend get all that stuff good stuff
[03:18:48] Ty you're very welcome Ty very
[03:18:53] welcome you are very welcome see it's
[03:18:56] the people that pay attention that come
[03:18:58] out with the stuff here when they're on
[03:19:00] my shows generally CU not everyone pays
[03:19:02] attention all the time and that's what
[03:19:03] it is you don't ever get everyone paying
[03:19:05] attention and when you do sometimes you
[03:19:09] uh you get everybody gets a good deal
[03:19:10] like uh like I don't know how many of
[03:19:13] these are left but like the uh the
[03:19:15] mystery bags for instance
[03:19:18] so the mystery bags there are 66 of them
[03:19:21] left okay out of those mystery
[03:19:27] bags there's uh
[03:19:31] like there's five collector
[03:19:35] boosters of um
[03:19:38] Fallout there are probably 10 collector
[03:19:43] boosters of eight to 10 collector
[03:19:45] boosters of
[03:19:48] Exelon there's
[03:19:51] also a
[03:19:54] showcase I think we have Prismatic
[03:19:56] nightmares is in there deceptive de
[03:19:58] divination is still in
[03:20:00] there scorpion God is in
[03:20:03] there modern Horizon 2 pre-release and a
[03:20:07] pip and a collector booster uh fallout
[03:20:10] is in there I mean those are pretty
[03:20:14] good oh
[03:20:18] nice nice the Mysteries yeah I know
[03:20:20] those are really nice and the commander
[03:20:22] Masters that's in there and there's

[03:20:26] Commander Masters in
[03:20:29] there no one's pulled any of them out
[03:20:31] yet so that's a pretty good deal on
[03:20:33] what's left in that box there and if you
[03:20:36] happen to floor you get one of those DC
[03:20:38] packs that's why I have those over there

[03:21:12] some stuff growing in a little field
[03:21:13] with a pond next to it or
[03:21:17] are you going to continue on your
[03:21:18] Wasteland Adventure trying to find your
[03:21:22] father with your buddy sweet
[03:21:25] minage
[03:21:34] now let's see what you want to
[03:21:39] do jump in on the game oh I'm going to
[03:21:43] change it I'm sorry that was not
[03:21:45] supposed to be that long going to put it
[03:21:46] to one minute that way you pick what you
[03:21:48] want now the packs are everything that I
[03:21:50] got there you can see them right top
[03:21:52] there there's all my packs that's what I
[03:21:54] got available right now all right and
[03:21:56] that tells you what you do if you buy
[03:21:58] like last time the person bought plus
[03:21:59] two and they smoked that Gator Dow
[03:22:01] smoked that Gator Dillo Gator Dillo
[03:22:03] didn't have a
[03:22:06] chance between uh between the
[03:22:09] immobilized from our buddy um sweet
[03:22:14] vinage and the gator and and the uh plus
[03:22:17] two for our hits from our from our buddy
[03:22:20] for our Gator Dow came right out on top
[03:22:22] on that one you luck we did not get
[03:22:25] lucky and get a uh get a get a Mythic so
[03:22:28] that we got a little extra hit point but
[03:22:30] that's okay that's okay though right now
[03:22:33] you buy whatever you want pay up to
[03:22:35] whatever you want now say you want to
[03:22:36] get M you know what I forgot I always
[03:22:37] for to tell you guys if you want to get
[03:22:39] multiple of something that's fine if you
[03:22:41] want to buy multiple of something and
[03:22:43] I'm good with that all you're going to
[03:22:45] say is hey I want to buy um say you want
[03:22:48] to buy two of the basic ones which will
[03:22:50] make a plus one ask if you can do that
[03:22:53] say Hey can I buy uh you know like two
[03:22:56] Outlaws please and I'll be like yeah
[03:22:59] sure and I'll put that out there I put
[03:23:00] out there for a little bit cheaper it'll
[03:23:01] be like 13 Instead at 14 because when
[03:23:03] you buy a couple things I like to give
[03:23:05] you a little discount so put it up there
[03:23:07] at 13 and you'll still get plus one
[03:23:09] though because you're getting multiple
[03:23:11] things there so that's kind of how we do

[03:56:41] now there there we go that should have
[03:56:43] removed them them there now you should
[03:56:46] be able to see everything that I have
[03:56:50] accurately there all right you go
[03:56:53] wandering further into this
[03:56:55] Wasteland the Gibby is going to go at
[03:56:58] the end of the stream I literally do the
[03:56:59] giby at the end of the stream um I
[03:57:01] always do that right at the end um I'm
[03:57:02] going to finish pretty much once I
[03:57:04] finish the we'll get to the boss we
[03:57:06] complete the boss or we fight the boss
[03:57:09] and then I generally do one or two extra
[03:57:12] things maybe if people want them and
[03:57:13] then we end the stream just because it's
[03:57:15] normally because I have to go on and do
[03:57:16] something with my family so like I'm
[03:57:18] going to try probably around noon is
[03:57:19] around the time I'm going to be ending
[03:57:20] it just so you guys know if I don't end
[03:57:22] it any earlier than that because we get
[03:57:24] to the boss or something like that but
[03:57:26] right now since we are uh no one gave me
[03:57:29] any in input what I'm going to do here
[03:57:30] is we're going to go on and
[03:57:33] William should we go and go to another
[03:57:36] encounter where we encounter something
[03:57:37] in a pond a pack of rats or some Raiders
[03:57:43] or do we go on to see if we fight the
[03:57:44] boss now if you go to the other
[03:57:46] encounter you can get extra stuff to get
[03:57:48] stronger potentially and maybe more ammo
[03:57:51] or stuff like that to be able to fight
[03:57:52] the boss the counter the encounter yeah
[03:57:55] all right you're going to do the
[03:57:56] encounter all right now for the
[03:57:57] encounter we're going to roll it's
[03:57:59] either going to be one through 10 is
[03:58:04] going to be the uh the pawn creature um
[03:58:08] 11 through 15 will be the rats and 16
[03:58:14] through 20 will be the Raiders how's
[03:58:17] that sound which one's dangerous the uh
[03:58:20] the most
[03:58:21] dangerous um the most dangerous is going
[03:58:23] to end up being uh probably the the
[03:58:25] group of Raiders is what I'm
[03:58:27] guessing okay and how much ammo do we
[03:58:30] have how much ammo it doesn't matter you
[03:58:31] have to choose here it's 8: a.m. where
[03:58:33] you are I am currently at 11:00 a.m. so
[03:58:37] we're going to roll we're going to see
[03:58:38] which one our our counter is our counter
[03:58:41] is five all right it's in the pond
[03:58:45] So currently our our buddy sweet vinage
[03:58:49] is over at that pond he reaches into the
[03:58:51] pond with his tentacles starts drinking

[04:37:11] control Vine was being trickered was
[04:37:13] trickery he caught you last time and he
[04:37:15] saw what happened so that control Vine
[04:37:18] now has armored its Vine so one slice

[04:54:14] right sweet bage goes up and he's like
[04:54:17] what is my brother is a lot bigger than
[04:54:20] he used to be this seems weird they're
[04:54:22] normally slender like me and elf can I
[04:54:26] borrow your sword
[04:54:30] Englebert and sweet vinage Englebert
[04:54:33] hands him the sword goes yeah sure I
[04:54:34] don't what you're doing here man and he
[04:54:36] takes that
[04:54:37] sword and he wanders up to his dead
[04:54:42] brother he goes I'm sorry brother and he
[04:54:45] stabs that sword in the back of him as
[04:54:48] he's laying on the ground and he starts
[04:54:50] cutting back slicing back further and
[04:54:53] further and further and the further back
[04:54:55] he
[04:54:56] slices more green radiated goop comes
[04:55:00] out that irradiated goop keeps coming
[04:55:04] out as you slice back rip rip rip
[04:55:09] radiated grop coming out and sweet bage
[04:55:12] takes his Vines sticks them down the
[04:55:15] Outside Inside sticks the other Vine
[04:55:17] down the inside spreads that P that open
[04:55:21] the back of his brother open going I
[04:55:23] thought he looked
[04:55:25] different and
[04:55:27] inside is a super
[04:55:30] mutant
[04:55:32] what so what's been going on is they've
[04:55:35] been absorbing and eating creatures
[04:55:40] what is going on here but it's not a big
[04:55:43] super mutant it's like a small one not a
[04:55:45] normal size it's a mutant it's just like
[04:55:47] a mutant in there so you go and that
[04:55:50] super mutant is actually not completely
[04:55:53] alive Ned you notice that is
[04:55:57] breathing and
[04:56:00] angelbert goes
[04:56:02] up
[04:56:04] takes two potatoes that were left over
[04:56:08] good thing you save some of the food
[04:56:11] you pull out that super mutant who isn't
[04:56:14] really big he's just there's something
[04:56:15] different about him you hand you take
[04:56:17] those two Tates and you mush one of them
[04:56:20] up and you push it in his
[04:56:22] mouth because you know he's probably
[04:56:24] been stuffed in there for a while fig
[04:56:26] maybe he's hungry you stuff that in
[04:56:28] there and you know what he starts ruming
[04:56:29] around a little bit chewing then you
[04:56:31] take your second T you stuff that in his
[04:56:33] mouth he keeps chewing a little more he
[04:56:35] slowly opens his eyes says what is going
[04:56:39] on where have I been
[04:56:40] in mutant talking kind of like a little
[04:56:43] Shakespearean
[04:56:45] dude

[04:56:55] don't know what I heard all of a sudden
[04:56:58] I was dis I was being

[04:57:03] me a little bit for a few more days
[04:57:06] thank you for coming and saving me good
[04:57:08] says and you notice he's going a weird
[04:57:10] pouch on him you look at this guy you
[04:57:13] ask him what what are you you find out
[04:57:19] the Super Mutant part of him he's not

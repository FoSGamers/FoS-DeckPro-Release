   export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
       let disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand('extension.askLlamaGPT', async () => {
           const editor = vscode.window.activeTextEditor;
           if (editor) {
               const document = editor.document;
               const selection = editor.selection;
               const text = document.getText(selection);

               // Fetch response from LlamaGPT API
               const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/generate', {
                   method: 'POST',
                   headers: {
                       'Content-Type': 'application/json',
                   },
                   body: JSON.stringify({ prompt: text }),
               });
               const result = await response.json();

               // Show response in VSCode
               vscode.window.showInformationMessage(result.generated_text);
           }
       });

       context.subscriptions.push(disposable);
   }

   export function deactivate() {}
   ```

3. **Run Your Extension**:
   - Launch the extension in VSCode to test and interact with the fine-tuned LlamaGPT.

#### 3. **Develop an API Endpoint**
Creating an API to serve requests from the IDE extension or other applications can streamline interaction with the fine-tuned model.

**Example API Using Flask**:
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load the fine-tuned model
model_name = "./fine-tuned-llama-gpt"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

@app.route('/generate', methods=['POST'])
def generate():
    data = request.get_json()
    prompt = data.get('prompt')
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
    output = model.generate(**inputs)
    generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return jsonify({"generated_text": generated_text})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

### Summary
By fine-tuning LlamaGPT on a coding-specific dataset and integrating it with an IDE like VSCode, you can significantly enhance its ability to assist with coding tasks. This involves preparing a dataset, training the model, and setting up an API and IDE extension for seamless interaction.

def setup_llamagpt(model_name="llama-gpt-model"):
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
    return tokenizer, model

# Function to perform web search using Bing Search API
def web_search(query, api_key):
    url = f"https://api.bing.microsoft.com/v7.0/search?q={query}"
    headers = {"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key": api_key}
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        search_results = response.json()
        return search_results
    else:
        return {"error": response.status_code}

# Generate text with LlamaGPT
def generate_text_with_llamagpt(tokenizer, model, prompt):
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
    text_output = model.generate(**inputs)
    generated_text = tokenizer.decode(text_output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return generated_text

def main():
    # API Key for Bing Search
    bing_api_key = "YOUR_BING_API_KEY"

    # Setup LlamaGPT
    tokenizer, model = setup_llamagpt()

    # Prompt for LlamaGPT
    prompt = "Search for the latest news on artificial intelligence."
    generated_text = generate_text_with_llamagpt(tokenizer, model, prompt)
    print(f"Generated Text: {generated_text}")

    # Perform web search based on generated text
    search_results = web_search(generated_text, bing_api_key)
    
    if 'error' not in search_results:
        # Process and display search results
        for result in search_results['webPages']['value']:
            print(f"Title: {result['name']}")
            print(f"URL: {result['url']}")
            print(f"Snippet: {result['snippet']}\n")
    else:
        print(f"Error: {search_results['error']}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Allow llamaGPT to add it's own sites to search.

[2024-06-25 23:26:57] ChatGPT:
### Allowing LlamaGPT to Add Its Own Sites to Search

To enhance LlamaGPT's functionality, we can enable it to suggest and add its own preferred sites for searching. This can be achieved by maintaining a dynamic list of websites that LlamaGPT can use for web searches. Here's how you can implement this:

#### 1. **Dynamic Site List Management**

1. **Initial Setup**: Create a list of default sites.
2. **User Interaction**: Allow users to add or remove sites from the list.
3. **Integration**: Use the list for performing web searches.

#### 2. **Implementing the Solution**

**A. Setup and Initial Script**

1. **Define Initial List of Sites**:
   - Start with a few predefined sites.

2. **Modify Web Search Function to Include Custom Sites**:
   - Adjust the function to search on specific websites.

3. **Allow LlamaGPT to Suggest Sites**:
   - Based on user prompts, LlamaGPT can suggest additional sites to add to the list.

**B. Example Implementation**:

```python
import requests
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Setup LlamaGPT
def setup_llamagpt(model_name="llama-gpt-model"):
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
    return tokenizer, model

# Function to perform web search using Bing Search API with custom sites
def bing_search(query, api_key, custom_sites):
    search_results = []
    for site in custom_sites:
        url = f"https://api.bing.microsoft.com/v7.0/search?q=site:{site} {query}"
        headers = {"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key": api_key}
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            search_results.extend(response.json().get('webPages', {}).get('value', []))
        else:
            print(f"Bing API error for site {site}: {response.status_code}")
    return search_results

# Function to perform web search using Google Custom Search API with custom sites
def google_search(query, api_key, cx, custom_sites):
    search_results = []
    for site in custom_sites:
        url = f"https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?q=site:{site} {query}&key={api

[2024-06-25 23:28:13] ChatGPT:
### Enabling LlamaGPT to Add its Own Sites to Search

To allow LlamaGPT to dynamically add its own sites to search, we need to create a mechanism where it can learn and store new URLs or sites that it can later use for web searches. This involves:

1. **Storing User-Added URLs**: A storage mechanism (e.g., a database or a simple file system) to keep track of URLs or sites added by the user.
2. **Modifying the Search Function**: Update the search function to include these additional URLs when performing searches.
3. **User Interface for Adding URLs**: Create an interface or method for the user to add new URLs to the list of searchable sites.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

#### 1. **Set Up Storage for URLs**

We will use a simple JSON file to store the URLs for simplicity. This can be replaced with a more robust database if needed.

**JSON File (`urls.json`)**:
```json
{
  "sites": [
    "https://www.example.com",
    "https://www.anotherexample.com"
  ]
}
```

#### 2. **Modify the Script to Use URLs from the JSON File**

**Enhanced Script with URL Management**:

```python
import json
import requests
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Setup LlamaGPT
def setup_llamagpt(model_name="llama-gpt-model"):
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
    return tokenizer, model

        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        search_results = response.json()

### Running LLaMA Models on a Computer with 8GB RAM

Running LLaMA models on a computer with 8GB RAM poses significant challenges due to the high memory requirements of these models. However, there are some strategies you can use to try to make this feasible, particularly with smaller models or by leveraging specific optimizations.

#### Challenges and Strategies

1. **Memory Limitations**:
   - **VRAM (GPU)**: LLaMA models require significant VRAM to run efficiently. Without a powerful GPU, running these models on a CPU with limited RAM can be very slow or infeasible.
   - **RAM**: Even the smallest LLaMA model (LLaMA-7B) typically requires more than 8GB of RAM, making it challenging to run directly on a system with limited memory.

2. **Possible Approaches**:
   - **Model Quantization**: Reducing the precision of the model parameters can help reduce memory usage.
   - **Swap Memory**: Using swap space can help, but it will be significantly slower than using RAM.
   - **Gradient Checkpointing**: Saves memory by trading off some computational overhead.
   - **Cloud Services**: Using cloud-based services to run the models can circumvent local hardware limitations.

#### Example: Using a Smaller or Quantized Model

For demonstration, let's use a very lightweight model or try quantizing the LLaMA-7B model:

1. **Install Necessary Libraries**:
   ```sh
   pip install transformers torch
   ```

2. **Load a Lightweight Model or Quantized Version**:
   ```python
   from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

   # Attempt to load the smallest or quantized version of LLaMA
   try:
       model_name = "meta-llama/LLaMA-7B-quantized"  # Hypothetical quantized model
       tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
       model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
   except:
       print("Loading a quantized or smaller model failed. Defaulting to a tiny model for demonstration.")
       model_name = "distilbert-base-uncased"  # Example of a smaller model
       tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
       model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

   # Generate text
   prompt = "Once upon a time"
   inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
   outputs = model.generate(**inputs)
   generated_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

   print(generated_text)
   ```

3. **Using Cloud Services**:
   If running locally is not feasible, consider using cloud services:
   - **Google Colab**: Offers free access to GPUs with more RAM.
   - **AWS, Azure, or GCP**: Provide scalable resources to run large models.

#### Using Swap Space on Linux
You can also increase the swap space on your Linux machine to help manage larger memory loads. Here’s a quick way to add swap space:

1. **Create a Swap File**:
   ```sh
   sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile
   sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
   sudo mkswap /swapfile
   sudo swapon /swapfile
   ```

2. **Make the Swap File Permanent**:
   Add the following line to `/etc/fstab`:
   ```sh
   /swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0
   ```

### Summary

Running LLaMA models on a computer with 8GB RAM is challenging due to high memory requirements. You can try model quantization, increasing swap space, or using cloud-based services for better performance. For practical purposes, using cloud services like Google Colab or AWS is often the most efficient solution for running large models like LLaMA.

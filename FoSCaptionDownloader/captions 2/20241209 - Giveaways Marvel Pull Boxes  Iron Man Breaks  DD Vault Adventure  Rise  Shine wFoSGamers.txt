[00:38:03] through the first floor door there like
[00:38:05] say I did a six a mini break with six
[00:38:08] and it would be like you know a smaller
[00:38:09] amount of

[00:38:13] characters and whoever jumped in all you
[00:38:16] guys would be able to go through uh go

[00:58:29] character there guaranteed and then
[00:58:30] you're also going to get your uh your
[00:58:33] thing too for that one and then it looks

[00:59:19] okay yes this was for you I'm sorry I'm
[00:59:23] saying Jeremy didn't answer me
[00:59:27] I was thinking and I wrote what I was
[00:59:29] thinking that was pretty
[00:59:31] funny I was thinking what I wrote that
[00:59:35] doesn't happen
[00:59:36] [Laughter]
[00:59:41] often all right here we go
[00:59:58] let's run the next one for it see if
[00:59:59] anybody wants it again we'll run another
[01:00:02] one try it again there if you guys want
[01:00:05] to do the break which gets you in it
[01:00:07] gets you your character you get to go in
[01:00:08] there you get whatever is added there
[01:00:09] for it maybe it's uh there and maybe uh
[01:00:12] and then maybe you want to get some of
[01:00:13] the other Adventure things but it gets
[01:00:14] you
[01:00:16] going I'm sorry I was a little backed up
[01:00:19] there for a
[01:00:20] second
[01:00:22] there
[01:00:24] now let's see if this will work
[01:00:28] here I'm going to add in
[01:00:32] image
[01:00:37] lock
[01:00:41] browse use
[01:00:44] that there we go all right there we go
[01:00:46] there's your
[01:00:48] luck there's your luck right there now
[01:00:51] let's add that
[01:00:53] in to here so I can get to it easy
[01:01:12] there we
[01:01:16] go there's luck available for
[01:01:20] you and then it looks like you have a
[01:01:22] weapons Choice Dalton o now you're going
[01:01:24] to get a choice of and a assault
[01:01:26] rifle a plasma rifle a sword a knife or
[01:01:32] a pistol all right what do you want
[01:01:35] there you want the best one well it's
[01:01:36] going to be between a plasma rifle or a
[01:01:38] sword sword is melee plus five plasma
[01:01:41] rifle is um you know ranged plus five
[01:01:45] now the ranged plus five though with you
[01:01:47] gets a
[01:01:48] uh you have let's see what you have for
[01:01:51] intelligence here and stuff you have D
[01:01:53] you have luck so you don't have any
[01:01:54] strength or anything like that for buff
[01:01:56] so it doesn't help matter but if you had
[01:01:58] say you had agility or strength it would
[01:02:00] give you pluses to this for your sword
[01:02:02] and if you have
[01:02:03] intelligence um and luck actually plasma
[01:02:06] rifle that would give you luck plus one
[01:02:08] would give you plus one on the plasma
[01:02:09] rifle so you got plus one with that
[01:02:12] going with a plasma all right you're
[01:02:13] going to come with a plasma rifle that
[01:02:15] actually is going to get you
[01:02:19] plasma plasma
[01:02:22] rifle plus that you also are going to
[01:02:25] get this one you're going to get eight
[01:02:27] rounds of ammo with your plasma
[01:02:31] rifle all right

[02:20:12] the big one this is going to be a
[02:20:15] problem for you all because this
[02:20:18] is 100
[02:20:21] Health all right now you're each gonna
[02:20:24] get your three rolls each to see if you
[02:20:27] can hurt them and get them but he's a
[02:20:29] it's a bigan it is a
[02:20:33] bigan it is a bigan
[02:20:36] so who is going to start the
[02:20:46] attack do we want a NL Punk n punk run
[02:20:50] in with the sword in the critical hit I
[02:20:52] mean that's not a bad
[02:20:56] idea you going to do it all right all
[02:20:58] right here we go n Punk Goes Rolling In
[02:21:02] grab his sword
[02:21:03] oh n
[02:21:06] Punk the
[02:21:09] sword didn't get you a nice extra but
[02:21:11] you did get five plus because you
[02:21:13] guaranteed a hit with a critical
[02:21:15] sometimes you get like a 20 extra on it
[02:21:17] onto it but you only got five added on
[02:21:19] let's see what happens here though you
[02:21:20] hit with your sword and it brings him
[02:21:23] down from 100 to oh not too bad that was
[02:21:27] a 10 and that brings him down to 85
[02:21:28] because that gives you an extra so he is
[02:21:30] at 85 Health he's not happy with you
[02:21:35] lashes towards you with its tail and
[02:21:39] knocks you to the side n punk as he
[02:21:42] knocks you to the as she knocks you to
[02:21:44] the side with the tail you are hit from
[02:21:46] 100 Health down to 82 Health that was a
[02:21:50] big big hit of that boss there it's a
[02:21:53] strong one who's next what are we doing
[02:21:56] next you can duel if you
[02:21:58] want you can duel it's a strong one I
[02:22:01] told you guys you're going to need some
[02:22:02] help here I told you all that's why you

[02:34:31] time two or time three for what
[02:34:34] happens for uh for it since you're
[02:34:36] coming together as since you have the

[02:34:40] going to be using since you have the
[02:34:41] luck there we're going to roll it to see
[02:34:42] what happens all right so since we have

[02:41:44] with comes with
[02:41:48] ammo which is 15
[02:41:51] rounds all
[02:41:54] right the luck amulet yep there was luck
[02:41:56] there was also strength also there was
[02:41:59] strength there was the luck and then
[02:42:03] there was also the health packs which
[02:42:05] everybody went with there was all that
[02:42:08] stuff there so yes all right you want to

[02:42:25] anybody want that who's going to take
[02:42:27] the strength one we have our buddy NL
[02:42:29] punk what are you doing my
[02:42:31] friend would you like the strength
[02:42:35] one strength gives you plus one so when
[02:42:37] you swing your uh sword you get a plus
[02:42:40] one and um if that's what it does or
[02:42:44] anything like that that's a a melee type
[02:42:46] thing

[02:43:12] rifle no there's assault rifle assault
[02:43:14] rifle ammo pistol so we're going to give

[02:43:26] right and then the strength is going to
[02:43:28] go to
[02:43:29] spicy so spicy has plus one strength
[02:43:40] now all
[02:43:42] right then I think that
[02:43:45] was and then yeah it should be enough
[02:43:48] Dow to make an armor make
[02:43:51] armor Gator Dow
[02:43:55] boss
[02:43:58] hide all right press strength and luck
[02:44:01] is a good one there for you yes whatever
[02:44:04] for you all right so we gave you the
[02:44:05] pistol ammo we have the strength was
[02:44:09] went to them that one there we have that
[02:44:11] with have plasma rifle ammo went to
[02:44:13] Dalton cuz they got those so that brings
[02:44:16] you up to um you not you use one two so
[02:44:20] that bring you six actually brings you
[02:44:22] up to 10 so you got 10 plasma rifle ammo
[02:44:25] and then I think there was was there an
[02:44:28] assault there was a sword left I believe
[02:44:30] or an assault rifle left no we already
[02:44:32] did the assault rifle so the sword was
[02:44:33] the only one left so you're going to get
[02:44:35] a second sword which means you can sell
[02:44:37] it to by the way at any of the um things
[02:44:42] or give it to a friend if you need to
[02:44:44] hand a sword off at some time so I think
[02:44:47] that as everything spread out between

[03:00:26] thank you I appreciate that you notice
[03:00:28] that it does take a bit of time to get
[03:00:29] all those in
[03:00:34] there we try to make it so it's as as
[03:00:37] transparent as you can possibly see for
[03:00:40] when you go anything because I don't
[03:00:41] like when I go and buy something and

[03:01:18] well thank you I try to be as like I
[03:01:20] mean yeah exactly I try to just just cuz
[03:01:23] I put it this way when I first came in
[03:01:24] here um I started and I didn't even know
[03:01:27] what this was but we tried just jumping
[03:01:29] on to sell stuff then I jumped into some
[03:01:31] other people's streams to try to get
[03:01:32] some things and a couple times I was
[03:01:33] like I I done did like a break and I
[03:01:35] walked away with like one card that was
[03:01:37] worth nothing and others walked away
[03:01:38] with other things so that's why I
[03:01:39] adjusted the way I did my breaks and
[03:01:42] then there was uh then I had gotten some
[03:01:44] things from like boxes and I got like
[03:01:45] things where worth like nothing when I
[03:01:47] spent a good chunk on it I'm like well I
[03:01:48] don't like that so I'm like I can't do
[03:01:50] that myself I go make it look different
[03:01:52] so that's kind of why I do like if it's

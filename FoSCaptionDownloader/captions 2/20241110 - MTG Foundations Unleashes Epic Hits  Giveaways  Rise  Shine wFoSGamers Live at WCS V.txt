[01:24:42] do you think the left side's going to
[01:24:43] beat the right side I don't think so the
[01:24:46] way that's been looking here with that
[01:24:47] especially with the uh the the the
[01:24:49] Japanese foiler I don't know so let's
[01:24:51] get it going and check it out on the
[01:24:53] left
[01:24:55] let's check it out on the
[01:24:56] left and here we go and after this like
[01:25:00] I said we'll do some of our um we'll do
[01:25:03] some auctions on some singles we've
[01:25:06] pulled out on the ones that I know my
[01:25:08] family does not want or need one two
[01:25:11] three four five six seven eight because
[01:25:14] I like putting our spoilers at the end
[01:25:16] not the beginning let's see if we get
[01:25:19] any spoilers in the beginning though CU
[01:25:20] sometimes there's a mid pack spoiler no

[01:26:12] with that
[01:26:14] one we've had better packs that was
[01:26:17] definitely not the best first pack we
[01:26:19] had there the right side I think the
[01:26:22] left side's going to be a dud on this
[01:26:23] one definitely not a winner on the left
[01:26:26] here it seems like this going to be hard
[01:26:29] to beat that uh Japanese foil we pulled
[01:26:31] out you know what I mean there so we're
[01:26:34] going to have to put this like that so
[01:26:36] we know what is on our um left side
[01:26:39] we're going to
[01:26:40] rearrange now do it this way I'm going
[01:26:43] to put this is on our right over here
[01:26:45] this is on our actually you know what
[01:26:46] I'm going to put it in this box because

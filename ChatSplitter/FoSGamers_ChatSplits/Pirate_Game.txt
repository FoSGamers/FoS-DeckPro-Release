### Analysis of WhatNot's Terms of Service for Trading Card Games, Sales, and Related Activities

#### 1. **General Rules for Trading Card Sales and Breaks**
   - **Card Breaks**: These are events where sealed card products are opened live, and the contents are distributed among participants. All sellers can run card breaks, but they must follow specific rules:
     - **Visibility**: The entire card break must be fully visible on camera from start to finish, including the opening of packs and the handling of cards.
     - **Distribution**: Each participant must receive at least one card. For breaks like team breaks, where there's a chance participants might not get cards from their selected teams, the seller must still send at least one card to each buyer.
     - **On-Platform Sales**: All sales and pre-sales for card breaks must be conducted on the WhatNot platform, and cannot span multiple shows【9†source】【13†source】.

#### 2. **Mystery Boxes and Pull Boxes**
   - **Transparency and Value**: Sellers must ensure that the combined market value of the items in a mystery box or pull box aligns with the winning bid. Sellers must describe these items accurately and cannot inflate their market value【10†source】.

#### 3. **Gambling and Prize-Based Games**
   - **Prohibition on Gambling**: WhatNot strictly prohibits gambling activities, including raffles, paid entries for races, and games where purchase-based prizes are offered. Sellers cannot offer bounties or other purchase-based prizes as part of their sales【10†source】【11†source】.

#### 4. **Community Guidelines and Seller Conduct**
   - **Fair Representation**: Sellers must accurately represent the condition of their items, avoid shill bidding (artificially inflating prices), and not offer off-platform grading services unless pre-approved.
   - **Content Restrictions**: No smoking or vaping around inventory, no explicit or mature content, and adherence to all community guidelines for live streams【10†source】【11†source】.

### Steps to Ensure Compliance:
1. **Clear and Visible Rules**: Make sure that all rules for card breaks and sales are clearly stated in the show notes or item listings. This includes how cards are distributed and what participants can expect.
2. **Full Visibility**: Ensure the entire process of opening and handling cards is fully visible on the live stream, without any off-camera actions.
3. **On-Platform Transactions**: Conduct all transactions, including pre-sales, on the WhatNot platform to avoid any violations.
4. **Avoid Gambling Elements**: Refrain from incorporating any form of gambling, paid entries for prize games, or bounties in your sales to comply with WhatNot's policies.

### Summary:
I have thoroughly reviewed WhatNot's Terms of Service and community guidelines focusing on trading card games, sales, box breaks, mystery bags, and related activities. The key points include strict rules for card breaks, the prohibition of gambling, and transparency in mystery boxes and pull boxes. Compliance requires clear communication of rules, full visibility during live streams, and conducting all transactions on the platform.

Okay, so here is the story that we're going to go with. The main character is a pirate captain on a pirate ship. The pirate captain is Buff, from what I was told, and they are very adept at many things. Along the way, they are going to have to fight their way through seven different islands, where on each of the first six islands, there are ten encounters, and then on the last island, there will be sixteen encounters. On each island, it will be either tropical, it could be a desert island, it could be an island of caves, it could be a rocky island, it could be all kinds of different things. Picture islands all around the world, build them yourself. Maybe there's an island that has ruins on it, maybe there's an island with pyramids, maybe there's all kinds of different islands. There's seven different islands, but each one has to be large enough to have ten encounters, and the last one has sixteen encounters, so the last island will be larger. I needed to build this pirate game and build it all out, so the character grows from each one with one of those encounters, and I have ten different characters for the encounters along the way in the islands. I have actually each island, we've already done that one, I have each island have ten encounters, but I need you to build me thirty different characters that would be fighting as encounters on the island. Now, those characters, as we go, would increase in strength and power, so I would need you to create the remainder of those characters all the way up to being the seventy-four, and then after that, the last two will be the boss, which is going to be a pirate, but it will be a skeleton pirate king. That will be the final boss.

Make sure that the power levels of each one of the creatures start off easier and get harder as it progresses through the game, to the boss being obviously the hardest at the end. Make sure that is known so the description actually shows it also along through the game. It doesn't have to say anything or write any words on it. No words whatsoever should ever be written on any of the pictures or in the description. That needs to be 100% clear. And every time you go to copy the description for each one of the characters over. And I need it also just to have just the described character to be described as being either stronger as the game progresses. And they start off not actually weak but normal or a creature of some kind. Then they get stronger and bigger or whatever along the way. So that you can tell they're bigger and more imposing until you get to the final boss, which is the biggest, most imposing, strongest character that you're going to be encountering.

Each island also gets increasingly harder, so you need to take that into account with how the description of each one of the 76 encounters go, which means there's going to be a creature that you have to create for each 76 encounters, or, at the end, the boss twice, because the boss will be fought where it runs away to its cave, and where its hoard of treasure is, where you find it to do its final battle.

- **Appearance**: The ship is a large, three-masted galleon with high sides and an even higher stern. It looks old and battered, with visible signs of numerous battles, such as scars and patches on the hull. Despite its wear, the ship is sturdy and intimidating, with an air of resilience and dominance. The ship has various cannons lined along its sides, some with smoke still trailing from recent use. The sails are tattered but functional, and the rigging is complex and well-maintained.

- **View Coming Towards**: The ship is shown from the front, with the bow cutting through the waves. The figurehead at the prow is a fearsome creature, adding to the ship's menacing aura. The three masts are visible, with the sails partially unfurled. You can see the deck crowded with pirate activity, with crew members readying the cannons and adjusting the sails. Smoke from the cannons trails into the sky, hinting at a recent skirmish.

- **View Going Away**: The ship is shown from the rear, with the stern towering above the water. The name of the ship is emblazoned across the back, partially obscured by wear and battle damage. The high poop deck is visible, with the captain's quarters at the top. The three masts extend high into the sky, with the sails catching the wind. The cannons are still smoking, and the water churns behind the ship as it moves forward.

I'll proceed to generate two new images based on these descriptions. One will show the pirate ship coming towards the viewer, and the other will show it going away.

Have the title also make sure it knows that I'm doing a 1,000 subscriber giveaway, and you can use abbreviations as needed, and use the internet and YouTube to figure out what ones are the best place to do that. I also have Modern Horizon 3 and Fallout singles, and Lord of the Rings singles, and make sure you use abbreviations for everything.

This title includes key elements of your stream, uses abbreviations effectively, and stays within the 70-character limit for optimal display in search results.

The rules for the game, how it is lived, and whatnot, is I'm going to have three different pull boxes. They're all the same price, but the first pull box will have cheaper items with a few high-priced singles in there to pull the price up to be a certain amount that makes profit for me. The second box will be the same price where it will make profit but not as much, and the third box should hopefully break even, but the whole point of it is they're all going to be the same price, and each pull from there, they have to build up through that. If they buy the first one, then the second one goes, which is a better deal. If they do it through that one, then the third one goes, which is the best deal. Then they will get stuff from both of those, and they'll need either packs or singles based on what's written on that, on the cards that are pulled out by the cards that are pulled out is how they use the weapons or items and stuff for the characters in the game. Now, what I need you to do is have the rules written out for people to understand what they're going to be doing. You can put a blank or x-axis or something like that in for the spot that is determining the amount of money that each pull from the pull box costs, but that's how it's going to be. Start with one pull box, which is on the lower side, where the items might be lower, but there's a few high-priced ones to make the price of the items higher, and it makes a better deal when you get to the middle one, and it makes even the best deal on the last one, and it goes from 35 to 25 to 16 for the numbers of items in the pull box or pulls from it.

[2024-07-27 22:01:56] ChatGPT:
### Description of the Main Character's Pirate Ship

**Ship Name**: The Sea Serpent

**Overall Appearance**:
- **Size and Structure**: The Sea Serpent is a large, imposing pirate ship, designed to strike fear into the hearts of its enemies. It is a three-masted vessel, with each mast towering high above the deck, adorned with tattered black sails emblazoned with a crimson serpent.
- **Condition**: The ship, while sturdy and seaworthy, shows signs of countless battles. The wooden hull is scarred and weathered, with patches and repairs evident along its length. Despite its age and the wear and tear, the ship remains strong and resilient, a testament to its craftsmanship and the tenacity of its crew.
- **Color and Materials**: The ship is primarily constructed from dark oak, giving it a somber and menacing appearance. Iron reinforcements and cannons line the sides, adding to its fearsome look and ensuring it is well-armed for any encounter.

**Details**:
- **Deck**: The deck is cluttered with the tools and spoils of piracy – coils of rope, barrels of supplies, and crates of plundered goods. Cannons are strategically placed along the sides, ready for battle. The deck itself shows signs of heavy use, with deep grooves and marks from countless skirmishes.
- **Figurehead**: At the prow of the ship is a fearsome figurehead shaped like a coiled serpent, its mouth open in a silent roar, eyes set with red gemstones that glint menacingly in the sunlight.
- **Sails and Rigging**: The black sails, though tattered, are still functional and bear the symbol of a crimson serpent. The rigging is complex and well-maintained, allowing the ship to maneuver swiftly despite its size.
- **Captain's Quarters**: The captain's quarters are located at the stern, featuring reinforced doors and small, heavily-barred windows. Inside, the quarters are filled with maps, charts, and the captain’s personal effects, creating an aura of command and strategy.
- **Weapons**: In addition to the cannons, the ship is equipped with ballistae and swivel guns, providing ample firepower for both long-range engagements and close-quarters combat.

**Atmosphere**:
- **Aura**: The Sea Serpent exudes an aura of menace and mystery. The combination of its dark, weathered appearance and the visible scars of past battles make it clear that this ship and its crew are not to be trifled with.
- **Sound**: The creaking of the wooden hull, the flapping of the sails, and the occasional roar of the cannons create a symphony of sounds that is both intimidating and awe-inspiring.
- **Movement**: Despite its size, the ship moves with surprising agility, slicing through the waves with ease. The crew, well-versed in the art of piracy, handles the ship with precision, making it a formidable force on the open sea.

This ship, the Sea Serpent, serves as both the home and the weapon of the main character, embodying the spirit of adventure and the relentless pursuit of treasure that drives the pirate captain and their crew.

### Steps to Install Rock Rails

1. **Preparation:**
   - Park the Jeep Gladiator on a flat surface.
   - Ensure the vehicle is in park and the parking brake is engaged.
   - If using a jack or lift, safely lift the vehicle and secure it on jack stands.

2. **Locate Mounting Points:**
   - The Jeep Gladiator has pre-drilled holes on the frame where the rock rails will be mounted. Locate these holes on both sides of the vehicle.

3. **Position Rock Rails:**
   - With the help of an assistant, position the rock rail against the mounting points. The rock rails are typically heavy, so assistance can make the process safer and easier.

4. **Attach Rock Rails:**
   - Insert the bolts through the mounting holes in the rock rail and into the pre-drilled holes in the vehicle’s frame.
   - Hand-tighten the bolts initially to ensure that the rock rail is properly aligned.

5. **Secure Rock Rails:**
   - Using a ratchet wrench, tighten the bolts gradually. Ensure you tighten them evenly to avoid misalignment.
   - Use a torque wrench to tighten the bolts to the manufacturer's specified torque setting. This information can be found in the installation instructions provided with the rock rails or in the vehicle’s service manual.

6. **Check Stability:**
   - Once all bolts are tightened to the correct torque, check the stability of the rock rails by gently shaking them. They should not move.

7. **Repeat for the Other Side:**
   - Repeat the same steps to install the rock rail on the other side of the vehicle.

8. **Final Inspection:**
   - Perform a final inspection to ensure all bolts are tight and the rock rails are securely attached.
   - Lower the vehicle if it was lifted.

### Summary
1. Prepare the Jeep and tools.
2. Locate the mounting points on the vehicle.
3. Position and align the rock rails with the help of an assistant.
4. Hand-tighten the bolts to secure the rock rails in place.
5. Use a torque wrench to tighten the bolts to the specified torque.
6. Check the stability of the rock rails.
7. Repeat the process for the other side.
8. Perform a final inspection.

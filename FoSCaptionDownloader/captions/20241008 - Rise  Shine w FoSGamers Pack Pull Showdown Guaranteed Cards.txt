[00:04:39] nice
[00:04:42] Perfecto I am in Florida and um we're in
[00:04:45] on new saman beach where did my thing go
[00:04:48] so like we're going to have some issues
[00:04:49] with some hurricane on the other side
[00:04:51] coming through we have some friends of
[00:04:53] ours in Tampa well some people like we
[00:04:54] work with and talk to and Tampa that
[00:04:57] we're concerned about also
[00:05:11] yeah so we're preparing we're going to
[00:05:14] go grab some sandbags today put them in
[00:05:16] the back of our house here that we're at
[00:05:18] so that we don't have anything flood in
[00:05:19] there so that's kind of what we're doing
[00:05:20] all but um we have some fun things
[00:05:23] planned today so today I'm going to open
[00:05:24] some packs myself because we're going to
[00:05:26] do that but I had a fun idea thought
[00:05:29] this would be a unique one we're going
[00:05:31] to do this we're going to take we're
[00:05:34] going to do something like this what
[00:05:35] we'll do is we'll take
[00:05:37] uh say an
[00:05:41] ion
[00:05:43] pack all right then I'll
[00:05:46] take we'll
[00:05:48] [Music]
[00:05:49] say
[00:05:52] Dorn play and we'll say like a Dorn
[00:05:56] collector all right got something new we
[00:05:58] trying today and then what I'm going to
[00:06:00] end up doing is I'll put out cards we'll
[00:06:03] see like um for instance find some cards
[00:06:06] here to put
[00:06:09] out if I have it in the bu now
[00:06:15] though all right so we're going to do
[00:06:16] something like this so we' put something
[00:06:18] like this up we
[00:06:22] go
[00:06:27] no right so for instance we take like
[00:06:31] this out of
[00:06:32] here and we'd go all right
[00:06:34] so this card
[00:06:37] here is
[00:06:41] uh
[00:06:43] $10 all right so you're going to have
[00:06:45] $10 on that card then we're going to
[00:06:47] look at this here we're going to go that
[00:06:50] this card here is
[00:07:00] we'll find one the whole point is I'm
[00:07:02] going to find one that say instead of 10
[00:07:04] this will be $5 and this is going to be
[00:07:06] like a 250 card all right so what would
[00:07:08] happen is you're going to open it and if
[00:07:10] this pack doesn't have $2.50 worth of
[00:07:12] stuff you're going to get the card
[00:07:13] that's there for $ 250 then you don't
[00:07:15] get the option of getting these ones but
[00:07:17] if you get $2.50 worth of stuff out of
[00:07:19] this you don't get the card and you move
[00:07:21] on you get your next pack you open that
[00:07:22] up and say this one you don't get $5
[00:07:25] worth of the stuff out of it then you
[00:07:26] get the card and then you go on to the
[00:07:28] next one you open it up up but you can't
[00:07:30] get blaz Meer but if you don't get your
[00:07:32] if you do get five uh your $5 worth out
[00:07:35] of here you go over and open this one
[00:07:37] and if you happen to not get uh like it
[00:07:40] would be probably $15 or more out of
[00:07:42] here you're going to get the blaz Meyer
[00:07:44] as a consolation pricee kind of thing
[00:07:46] that's kind of how I was thinking we do
[00:07:48] with our game here I don't know if you
[00:07:49] like it so it's an insurance against a
[00:07:52] doodo in away
[00:07:54] correct an assurance against a doodo
[00:07:59] [Laughter]
[00:08:02] yes so let me get a few cards out here
[00:08:05] and let me see what we can do all right
[00:08:07] let's do this and get a few cards
[00:08:15] out all
[00:08:18] right so we'll go and then I'll go like
[00:08:26] a so like this would be lay line of
[00:08:28] resonance right here all right we put
[00:08:30] that
[00:08:32] out and then I would go and
[00:08:37] grab something here and see let's find
[00:08:40] something over
[00:08:47] here then I would put out say
[00:08:51] um let's see this one
[00:09:06] no look that does work to know okay I'm
[00:09:09] going to move that one
[00:09:14] down
[00:09:15] [Music]
[00:09:26] say what's this one
[00:09:30] we'll go with
[00:09:37] this
[00:09:40] okay and we'll say this is
[00:09:43] a $3 card so what we're going to do here
[00:09:47] is we're going to start this for the
[00:09:49] auction this
[00:09:51] morning I'm going start it here they go
[00:09:59] just adding I'm literally just adding
[00:10:01] them all
[00:10:02] up so we're going to put this

[00:10:19] here we do not let's add it in there the
[00:10:21] B the auctions

[00:10:32] right
[00:10:38] then put the description in
[00:10:41] there starting price for this one right
[00:10:43] now and we'll put this at what is this
[00:10:47] do 50 of those why not we'll just say
[00:10:48] that's how many
[00:10:51] there there we go put that in this is
[00:10:55] how we're going to do that one oh
[00:11:01] I have to do this here addit it make it
[00:11:12] a so question if a given pack say stinks

[00:17:06] for coming in hanging out I appreciate
[00:17:08] hey thank you
[00:17:10] skinny hey we are doing well folks uh um
[00:17:13] skinny we're actually having a good time
[00:17:14] where you don't want to hear something
[00:17:15] interesting we sold our house and we're
[00:17:17] on our way to um purchasing a boat to
[00:17:20] live on a boat to travel around with so
[00:17:22] maybe depending on where you are at some
[00:17:24] point if you're uh over there still in
[00:17:27] that area and we uh and you happen to be
[00:17:29] in the in the South Pacific in like five
[00:17:31] to seven years if you're still in the
[00:17:33] armed forces maybe we'll be able to pop
[00:17:35] in and meet with you and play some
[00:17:39] games all right thought not bad one
[00:17:43] right all right so no one wants to do
[00:17:45] that so what I'll do here is my that was
[00:17:47] our idea for the game here it's like a
[00:17:49] like a guaranteed win but no one's
[00:17:51] wanting to do them intriguing all
[00:17:55] right no h we put two off wait we talked
[00:17:58] to a couple long story short the person
[00:18:00] that we had been working with um weird
[00:18:02] issue happened with their company so
[00:18:03] we've had a bit of a headache trying to
[00:18:04] figure out different things to do for a
[00:18:05] little while trying to find like a new
[00:18:07] broker
[00:18:09] um
[00:18:11] so they're not around anymore I don't
[00:18:14] know what happened they didn't answer us
[00:18:15] and somebody else tried to get a hold of
[00:18:16] us and they didn't tell like they didn't
[00:18:17] tell us exactly what was going on so I
[00:18:19] was like I'm trying to find a different
[00:18:20] broker really is what it's boiling down
[00:18:21] to but we did send an offering on a boat
[00:18:23] that was a um that's a one from a
[00:18:26] um charter company
[00:18:29] because all the boats that we came see
[00:18:30] like they're like the ones that are we
[00:18:32] looking at I'm like I'm not going to buy
[00:18:33] a brand new one right now I want to buy
[00:18:34] a used one cuz the new one I want to buy
[00:18:37] is uh I want to wait until I have my
[00:18:38] full money for my my stuff that I have
[00:18:41] but
[00:18:42] anyways no one wants to do this one this
[00:18:44] is an intriguing one will um I don't
[00:18:47] know I I thought this was a good one for
[00:18:49] you guys guaranteeing you guys something
[00:18:50] but it looks like it's probably it's a
[00:18:52] Monday morning you know it's the
[00:18:53] beginning of the month and everyone's
[00:18:54] preparing for hurricanes and everything
[00:18:56] else now ice I need a between one and 10
[00:18:59] from
[00:19:00] you one two three four five 6 seven8
[00:19:04] nine oh no I didn't to grab another card
[00:19:06] here and
[00:19:13] 10 let's get it let's get a number and
[00:19:16] then what I'll do here is
[00:19:19] um yeah I'll try another one see if you
[00:19:21] guys want something
[00:19:24] different not this was I guess this is
[00:19:26] not going to work it's not a good idea
[00:19:28] I'll take this and put this
[00:19:32] away um and we will uh do something
[00:19:35] different
[00:19:37] today I don't what we'll do but this is
[00:19:41] one of those uh we can test things out
[00:19:44] and figure it out that's why we're here
[00:19:46] on Mondays and Tuesdays things like that
[00:19:48] those are kind of you know testing days
[00:19:51] in a way let's put that back
[00:19:54] here all righty and I have tea I got to
[00:19:58] get back my tea my wife organized all
[00:20:00] these so if I screw up the alphabetic
[00:20:03] like how she organized them for me she's
[00:20:04] going to kill me so I got to put them
[00:20:05] back in
[00:20:10] correct there we
[00:20:13] go back to the alphabetical
[00:20:16] order all right looks like no one wants
[00:20:18] any packs today and our friend I might
[00:20:22] be a little busy so I'm just going to go
[00:20:23] into opening some of the stuff that we
[00:20:25] had that we didn't finish from last from
[00:20:28] the weekend
[00:20:29] and uh we'll hang out for a

[00:41:09] and no one was no one was jumping in on
[00:41:11] anything but if there happens to be some
[00:41:12] singles that you want out of here and

[00:44:50] nice yeah I can do that if you guys uh
[00:44:53] send me messages we have the Discord if
[00:44:55] you guys send me some messages from
[00:44:56] there I try to do my best to get stuff
[00:44:58] together I don't always have the
[00:44:59] opportunity to at the moment cuz all my
[00:45:01] stuff is in storage but if it's
[00:45:02] something new that I pulled out I will
[00:45:04] have it around here that we'll be
[00:45:05] looking at all right here let's see what
[00:45:07] we get out of this
[00:45:09] one oh yeah remember everybody we have
[00:45:12] our um so for instance you guys hanging
[00:45:14] out in here you want to understand that
[00:45:15] game that we have on there the pack pole
[00:45:18] Showdown the way that we do it is you
[00:45:20] get picked three packs and I'll put
[00:45:22] three cards out if those packs happen to
[00:45:25] be below the card price when you pull
[00:45:28] stuff out you get the card but you only
[00:45:30] get one of the cards so you you want to
[00:45:33] kindy of get your money's worth on the
[00:45:34] first two and then on the last one which
[00:45:36] would be like is maybe a collector
[00:45:37] booster or a Premium Pack you you want
[00:45:39] to that's where you want to maybe if you
[00:45:41] don't get your money's worth that's
[00:45:42] where you don't want to because then you
[00:45:43] get a nice card if you

[00:57:26] of those three but right
[00:57:28] now we're opening these having some fun
[00:57:31] opening the packs and what I've have
[00:57:33] been doing here is we have a little bit
[00:57:34] of a game uh the pull pack Showdown here
[00:57:36] oh bearded thank you buddy I appreciate
[00:57:38] that a lot dude I appreciate that a lot
[00:57:42] we got a giveaway going out for us so
[00:57:44] you guys get to jump in and see what you
[00:57:45] get
[00:57:47] there and what I'm going to do
[00:57:50] here thank you thank
[00:57:53] you what I'm going to do here for all of
[00:57:56] you guys morning all Mr Fong we're going
[00:57:58] to open this up but I'm going to explain
[00:58:01] the game while we're opening this okay
[00:58:03] so the new game that you pack pole
[00:58:04] Showdown what we do is you pick three
[00:58:07] packs of cards then I pick three
[00:58:10] singles those three singles get put up
[00:58:13] in front of those packs of cards and if
[00:58:14] those packs of cards do not come out to
[00:58:17] the cost of those singles you get the
[00:58:19] single that is equated with the pack of
[00:58:22] cards now if you happen to get one
[00:58:24] single then you uh can't get any more
[00:58:27] though so for instance say you pick a
[00:58:30] card in a draft and you get a single is
[00:58:32] $4 and your pack isn't worth $4 you'll
[00:58:35] get the single for $4 but then you can't
[00:58:37] get any other singles that are out there
[00:58:38] for the other packs that you
[00:58:41] got rapacious one oh we got to zoom zoom

[01:00:24] pack that was a sweet pack there
[01:00:26] everyone dude oh that's awesome I'm so
[01:00:29] happy about
[01:00:30] that that was a really good
[01:00:33] pack what the B you what you want the
[01:00:36] band card yes I've wanted the band card
[01:00:38] for a while and I don't care I still
[01:00:40] want it I still want it I'm going to
[01:00:43] make a comment um I feel like um Wizards
[01:00:46] put a little bit more effort into the
[01:00:48] cards they put into the um the
[01:00:52] um Festival in a box they actually feel
[01:00:55] like better cards than they used to I
[01:00:57] don't know if that makes any sense
[01:00:58] anyone like they don't feel like the
[01:01:01] same
[01:01:04] cards use carry cards and cards to SL
[01:01:08] yeah yeah that's a good point yeah this
[01:01:09] good point yep exactly carry cards to
[01:01:12] slot in if they don't want to play with
[01:01:13] it exactly if you don't want to do it
[01:01:14] you don't want to like you know rule
[01:01:15] zero it or whatever there you go oh nice
[01:01:19] that was a good pack there I'll take
[01:01:21] that all righty now I need some I just
[01:01:24] want you guys to know this is how we do
[01:01:25] our game here we're going to zoom out so
[01:01:27] if anybody wants to go we're going to
[01:01:29] try it here so this is why we're going
[01:01:31] to do it here this is what I'll do is
[01:01:32] we're going to put out this here we're
[01:01:34] going to go like um we'll
[01:01:37] say we'll take a bloom
[01:01:39] burrow then we'll grab
[01:01:45] a set of
[01:01:48] Aon then we'll get a duskborn all right
[01:01:51] and this is what we would do here I
[01:01:53] would go and I would say
[01:01:56] the
[01:01:59] um say the thran Dynamo here I do
[01:02:02] believe is uh I already have one of
[01:02:03] those that's why I'm putting up
[01:02:10] there so for instance I'd put the thr
[01:02:12] Dynamo up and I'd say if the thran
[01:02:14] Dynamo is equating to the Exon if your
[01:02:18] pack of Exon does not have money of
[01:02:20] cards worth the $467 the thr Dynamo is
[01:02:24] you'll end up getting the thr Dynamo
[01:02:26] but if you get the thran Dynamo you
[01:02:28] can't get the card that's here but it
[01:02:30] goes in progression through what you get
[01:02:33] so we have our pack here giv away to our
[01:02:35] friend let me um get these into a sleeve
[01:02:38] and we're going to open up that pack

[01:53:42] story based on kind of we'll say a war
[01:53:46] of some kind occurred and there was
[01:53:48] nuclear fallout um and we are surviving
[01:53:51] that Wasteland
[01:53:53] and in that Wasteland survival one of
[01:53:55] the things that you need to do is you
[01:53:56] are going to be one of the cool things
[01:53:58] that I have it's uh you're you're not
[01:53:59] competing necessarily against each other
[01:54:02] you can be um competing together to a
[01:54:05] common goal or against each other so see
[01:54:09] that's the fun thing about what we're
[01:54:10] doing yes you won
[01:54:15] Julie I suspected it was going to be you
[01:54:17] since no one else jumped in I'm guessing
[01:54:20] all the buyers had to uh run out for the
[01:54:21] day but there you go my friend but
[01:54:24] that's what we plan on doing it'll be
[01:54:25] like that and it will be a uh more of
[01:54:28] like a Mad Max style one um there's
[01:54:30] actually a a quote unquote Death Race
[01:54:33] that is done because I am in day Daytona

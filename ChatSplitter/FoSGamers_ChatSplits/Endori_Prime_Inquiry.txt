There is no widely recognized planet or location called "Endori Prime" in major movies, TV shows, or video games that I could locate in current popular sci-fi franchises. However, it might be a lesser-known or niche reference, possibly from an indie game, novel, or a less mainstream science fiction universe.

If you can recall more details about where or how you encountered Endori Prime, I can help you further research it. Alternatively, it might be a custom or fan-made location from sci-fi content that has yet to gain major recognition.

[00:18:07] have a I have a picture I have to find
[00:18:08] it somewhere the first picture I didn't
[00:18:10] even remember realize it was like the
[00:18:11] first house that we were liveing but I
[00:18:13] remember that we had a um the first
[00:18:16] house that I remember is um I didn't
[00:18:18] realize it was our house at the time
[00:18:20] because we were living at a campground
[00:18:21] you know and I was like playing and I
[00:18:22] was in a tree and I'm like swinging back
[00:18:24] and forth in top of a tree like that's
[00:18:26] the first picture that I remember like
[00:18:27] of my life growing up up and then uh one
[00:18:30] of the things in my life growing up and
[00:18:31] like swinging in that tree in front of
[00:18:33] the trailer cuz I used to climb to the
[00:18:35] top of the tree and swing back and forth
[00:18:36] and tried to touch the
[00:18:38] ground I was a I was a hell child I
[00:18:41] always got
[00:18:42] injured um it was like a little sapling
[00:18:44] but anyways
[00:18:48] um that's where we started little
[00:18:50] trailer and then we moved up apparently
[00:18:52] got apartment able to buy rent a house
[00:18:54] able to buy a house and family passed
[00:18:57] away and went back to down to zero again
[00:18:59] and start it all
[00:19:06] over but it happens and if you work hard
[00:19:09] you do get the things you want it just
[00:19:11] they don't all they don't come easy the
[00:19:13] the things that do come easy to people
[00:19:14] are ones that I know I'm just going to
[00:19:17] say they like you said they were the
[00:19:18] silver spoon and they're never going to

[00:23:47] still alive after all these things like
[00:23:48] no n of that happened to you well I um I
[00:23:52] had my first seizure when I was driving
[00:23:55] and I happened to be the sober driver
[00:23:57] for a bunch of people in the car
[00:23:59] and they tried charging me a DUI but
[00:24:00] ended up finding out I wasn't I got
[00:24:02] there was no problem with it but um I
[00:24:04] had a seizure in the car and I went off
[00:24:07] the highway in my Pontiac Sunbird and I
[00:24:09] hit a tree at about 60 miles an
[00:24:12] hour that what that's what happened to
[00:24:15] my pony it went it didn't go into the
[00:24:16] ground it went into a
[00:24:22] tree I'm lucky to be here my face I
[00:24:25] actually didn't have a face for a while
[00:24:28] like for the first for um so my lip got
[00:24:30] ripped off my mouth my tongue was bit in
[00:24:33] half and was dangling on by like
[00:24:34] literally a string my lip was ripped off
[00:24:36] so much that you could see into my nose
[00:24:39] up in my nose um my lip down here was
[00:24:43] where mased upop um the steering column
[00:24:46] hit me in the face that's what it was so
[00:24:47] that was pretty that was pretty weird
[00:24:49] like that but

[00:25:31] like a couple years and we figured them
[00:25:33] all out now I'm good I actually they
[00:25:34] realized the reason I had seizures was
[00:25:35] because they ignored a different medical
[00:25:37] issue that I told them about for years
[00:25:39] um I ended up having a severe anemia and
[00:25:42] pretty much my brain shut down because I

[00:40:26] wavelength Spectrum so used to say
[00:40:27] things about having we have the best

[00:40:30] commercial like we have the best
[00:40:31] spectrum and have them calling like Mars
[00:40:33] or
[00:40:34] [Laughter]

[00:50:46] step-grandparents if I showed up there
[00:50:48] my sisters went around and came over for
[00:50:50] whatever reason it was um and like I
[00:50:53] remember they were AC literally across
[00:50:55] the school that I went to my entire
[00:50:56] entire life growing up like elementary
[00:50:58] middle school and all that and they
[00:51:00] would um my sister would go over there
[00:51:02] after high school sometimes be like say
[00:51:04] hi or visit them whatever and they would
[00:51:07] be like oh I'd be hey how you doing like
[00:51:09] hi and like you can go over there and
[00:51:11] like pretty much keep me out of the room
[00:51:14] I'm like seriously like I don't know
[00:51:16] like what the like they didn't even want
[00:51:18] to see me in the room like
[00:51:22] what that's not nice like I'm I'm
[00:51:24] freaking the kid I don't even know who
[00:51:26] you are trying to be
[00:51:28] nice well the other side of the
[00:51:32] family wasn't nice either so we just we
[00:51:35] just unlucky there some people are like
[00:51:37] that I don't really care I learned I
[00:51:40] learned very early on that people have
[00:51:42] their Hang-Ups on things let them have
[00:51:44] them it's not your thing it's their
[00:51:46] problem not your problem let them have
[00:51:48] their problems they're ignorant acord hi
[00:51:51] cord one two three four you said you run
[00:51:53] from the random from the middle which is
[00:51:55] a frantic strength
[00:51:57] all right High
[00:51:59] hord get you that one
[00:52:01] there half the time I just like my
[00:52:04] favorite saying that I had growing like
[00:52:07] Middle School it was probably high
[00:52:09] school through I haven't used it BR now
[00:52:12] in the 30s but I used to say a lot I'm
[00:52:13] like I'll agree to disagree I'm like I'm
[00:52:15] not gonna I'm not arguing with you it's
[00:52:18] not like I already understand who you
[00:52:20] are there's no point I'll agree to
[00:52:23] disagree that's where we're going at
[00:52:32] all righty let's see what we got
[00:52:38] here let's run some more of
[00:52:40] these let's run some more of these let's
[00:52:43] try um that's not what happened
[00:52:46] there let's try the um dusk
[00:52:49] MN play booster I mean collector booster
[00:52:53] here you go
[00:52:57] yeah exactly I'm done wasting my breath
[00:52:58] yeah basically wall brambles Band of
[00:53:01] Thieves grain
[00:53:04] Sparrow Pond harassing Ruffians just a
[00:53:08] rock Grievous insult Jo Keening
[00:53:14] Banshee look out Lake a fank blue Knight
[00:53:19] we have
[00:53:20] Beacon with the cast into Exile ooh I
[00:53:24] like that one Arcane barrage
[00:53:27] that's a nice looking one
[00:53:31] there yeah there's no reason not to see
[00:53:34] this is how Julie this is what I say all
[00:53:35] the time I respect everybody that I meet
[00:53:40] there's no reason not to you have a
[00:53:42] granddaughter who's got a diff dad but
[00:53:44] my son is always with her and she's
[00:53:45] welcome all see that's what it is Julie
[00:53:47] like I'm the same way my mom's that way
[00:53:49] too very welcoming with people so and
[00:53:52] that's what we like people love our F
[00:53:54] like our family in that aspect for that
[00:53:56] reason
[00:53:58] yeah see one of the things is if you my
[00:54:00] thing that I've always thought was like
[00:54:02] you put the effort in
[00:54:06] um you care about everyone you give
[00:54:08] everybody respect nobody dis deserves to
[00:54:11] not be respected for some reason the
[00:54:13] first time you meet them the only time
[00:54:15] somebody loses respect to me is when
[00:54:19] they act away to lose it and at that
[00:54:21] point it's hard to regain
[00:54:24] it Mar
[00:54:30] because if to prove they're worthy of
[00:54:32] the respect after that now like people
[00:54:34] can make mistakes there's a difference
[00:54:35] between mistakes and like you're being
[00:54:39] belligerent and inappropriate you know
[00:54:42] like somebody makes a mistake that's
[00:54:43] different I'm not going to not going to
[00:54:45] complain or have an issue with that
[00:54:47] somebody keeps making the same mistake
[00:54:48] over and over and over again that's
[00:54:50] willful ignorance then I'm going to have
[00:54:52] an issue with that you know what I mean
[00:54:56] but most of the time I give every single
[00:54:58] person I've ever met the benefit of the
[00:55:00] doubt that they're a good person to
[00:55:01] start out with I'll will tell you a lot
[00:55:05] of the random people that I've met that
[00:55:06] others would have thought were maybe not
[00:55:08] because of how they looked or acted were
[00:55:10] some of the nicest and best people I've
[00:55:11] ever met and some of the friendliest
[00:55:13] people that I've ever been around and
[00:55:15] some of the best people I could say I
[00:55:16] could call friends so and that's because
[00:55:19] I was it was a random thing and I
[00:55:21] reached out and I was like hey I need
[00:55:22] somebody that anybody want to go fishing
[00:55:24] I don't have anybody on this day and you
[00:55:27] know you guys are looking for fishing
[00:55:28] all the time want to come out and now I
[00:55:29] hang out with some people I fish all the
[00:55:31] time with somebody that I would never
[00:55:32] would have bumped into never even have
[00:55:33] thought to talk to but
[00:55:35] because that reason I gave the benefit
[00:55:37] of D hey nice hey they're nice enough
[00:55:39] they show they seem respectful let's try
[00:55:41] it out and they were when they talk to
[00:55:43] me so that's what you do I don't know
[00:55:45] I'm weird though
[00:55:47] I I'm odd I'm odd in many ways I'm mod
[00:55:50] in many ways
[00:55:57] but I try to make sure that everybody
[00:55:59] has a has a chance no matter what you
[00:56:02] are for whatever reason is you should

[02:25:53] work I have to log in I'm going to have
[02:25:56] to figure that one out another time
[02:25:57] supposedly I can have the brake show up
[02:26:00] on

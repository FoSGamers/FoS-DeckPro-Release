[00:44:57] collector boosters there's one collector
[00:44:58] booster of everything except for the two
[00:45:01] Lord of the Rings things in there um and
[00:45:04] then there's a few command there's like
[00:45:06] three or four Commander Masters because
[00:45:08] I think a couple of the commander
[00:45:09] Masters collector boosters were already
[00:45:10] pulled out and then there's other drafts
[00:45:12] and sets and stuff that I have in there
[00:45:14] too I haven't put any Eternal Masters in
[00:45:17] oh did I put an eternal Masters in there
[00:45:19] I think there's an eternal Masters in
[00:45:21] there too actually I think I put one in
[00:45:23] last night because I got those in
[00:45:24] yesterday so I even think there's an
[00:45:26] eternal Masters in
[00:45:28] there but I mean there sometimes you see
[00:45:31] what you get that's why we like to do
[00:45:32] the we have some good luck and try to

[00:45:57] [Music]
[00:45:59] of yeah I mean I can't guarantee you're
[00:46:01] going to get something at the top every
[00:46:03] time but I can at least give you a
[00:46:05] little bit extra and see if you get
[00:46:06] another chance on something you know I
[00:46:08] mean I can't guarantee it but like I
[00:46:10] said it's one of those we give you an
[00:46:11] extra little chance I'm gonna do this
[00:46:14] actually since we did um we did I want
[00:46:17] to do this I want to do this I know not
[00:46:18] everybody likes aoria maybe you do maybe
[00:46:21] you don't want some Godzilla stuff but
[00:46:23] I've been watching I watched that
[00:46:24] Godzilla movie the other day and I was
[00:46:26] been wa I watched the Monarch TV show
[00:46:29] actually it's over now but I was
[00:46:30] watching that Monarch TV show and that
[00:46:33] was pretty fun so let's maybe see if we
[00:46:34] can get some Godzilla and some dinosaurs
[00:46:36] here then afterwards I threw some
[00:46:37] Ravnica on earlier and nobody was
[00:46:40] interested in that and I have eternal
[00:46:41] Masters maybe I'll throw an eternal
[00:46:43] Masters one on after this maybe I'll do
[00:46:46] that
[00:46:47] actually maybe that's what I'll do after
[00:46:49] this here we go I'm GNA
[00:46:52] find let me get this put up here
[00:47:05] all right why is this not
[00:47:15] working why didn't that
[00:47:17] work no that's better I can't do that no
[00:47:20] I'm not doing that I'm doing this
[00:47:22] instead I'm doing that instead that's
[00:47:25] what I'm doing instead
[00:47:26] I'm not doing that why does that always
[00:47:27] tell me sometimes I I need to like go in
[00:47:29] and figure out my calculations sometimes
[00:47:31] but every time and again I'm like you
[00:47:32] know what screw who cares I'm just gonna
[00:47:34] go because I can manually adjust in my
[00:47:36] head all right here we go let's see if
[00:47:37] anybody wants to try their luck within a
[00:47:40] little aoria maybe they want to go after
[00:47:43] h a a god Godzilla or uh maybe they want
[00:47:47] to go after a monit or a Caverns here I
[00:47:50] don't know pretty good deal on those
[00:47:52] then afterwards I will throw on um some
[00:47:55] single since people did ask for some
[00:47:57] singles here and we can see what happens
[00:47:59] with those singles after I throw a on
[00:48:01] and then I'll go through and I'll throw
[00:48:03] maybe a pole boox deal on kind of rotate
[00:48:05] through everything that I have here pull
[00:48:08] box pack deal that type of thing all
[00:48:10] right now I have as you guys can see up
[00:48:12] here I got a ton of collector boosters I
[00:48:15] have Lord of the Rings original Lord of
[00:48:17] the Rings
[00:48:18] aoria uh Wilds of wild drain Exelon
[00:48:22] Ravnica Lord of the
[00:48:24] Rings uh special edition and Doctor Who
[00:48:27] over here so if there is anything that
[00:48:30] you want say you want three collector
[00:48:32] boosters or something throw it out there
[00:48:34] and say hey can you get me three of
[00:48:35] these I have people that do that all the
[00:48:36] time in chat when we're hanging out
[00:48:37] that's the whole point of what I do here
[00:48:39] I kind of make deals with people that
[00:48:40] they say they want three of a kind of
[00:48:42] something because it helps me with
[00:48:44] whatnot fees and when it helps me with
[00:48:45] the whatnot fees I kind of pass that um
[00:48:48] fee savings over to you guys is really
[00:48:50] what it boils down to so what I'm going
[00:48:52] to do here is I'm going to pull out my
[00:48:54] singles that are going to
[00:48:57] go for $10 a piece on any of these ones
[00:49:02] three black lotuses if I had three black
[00:49:04] lotuses that would be nuts that would be
[00:49:06] nuts if I could find something to pull
[00:49:08] three black lotuses out with
[00:49:11] even that would be crazy I don't even
[00:49:14] know anything that you could pull three
[00:49:15] black lotuses out of because my like
[00:49:18] that I would have to be able to get in a
[00:49:21] reasonable manner all right we're going
[00:49:23] to throw any of these on for $10 my son
[00:49:25] though he has a luck if you've seen any
[00:49:27] of these things my son does he's
[00:49:28] literally called out like hey what do
[00:49:30] you need they said they need something
[00:49:32] all right I'll pull that out for you
[00:49:33] like okay kid and he freaking does it

[00:49:57] back to the beginning do you have
[00:49:59] anything from the '90s
[00:50:02] I do have stuff from the 90s but not for
[00:50:05] sale I'm sorry what I have from the 90s
[00:50:07] is my personal stuff that I had when I
[00:50:09] was a kid that I have not gone through
[00:50:12] and looked at at all to
[00:50:14] sell um if I find anything else I've
[00:50:17] been debating on looking at um some of
[00:50:20] the there some um they have some
[00:50:22] um uh yard sale not yard sales um flea
[00:50:25] market things in my area I've been
[00:50:27] debating on going to and grabbing the
[00:50:29] boxes of stuff no no problem because I
[00:50:32] like they have they have boxes of things
[00:50:34] all the time and I've been debating on
[00:50:36] them going over to flea market and just
[00:50:37] grabbing a box just to see what I can
[00:50:39] find out of them all right nobody wanted
[00:50:41] any of those singles which I will throw
[00:50:42] those back over here I'll find you a
[00:50:44] pack deal hey Ed how you doing chup how
[00:50:47] you been Thanks coming in hanging out
[00:50:54] deck I want to throw a pack deal on
[00:50:56] right now good morning we're on here for
[00:50:59] a little while uh Nolan's got a soccer
[00:51:02] tournament today so we're not going to
[00:51:03] be able to hang out too too long you
[00:51:06] know what I don't know if anybody's
[00:51:07] gonna want this this is kind of it's
[00:51:09] gonna be kind of a high roller one but
[00:51:11] we'll see if any wants try it we're
[00:51:12] gonna do
[00:51:18] arabik we're going to do a ravnik a l of
[00:51:21] the
[00:51:22] Rings and an eternal Masters we're going
[00:51:24] to go after some serialized and
[00:51:30] something what you
[00:51:32] want do I say stay with all the card the
[00:51:36] pack pull yeah so the pack deal so so
[00:51:38] you you ask for three packs I would um
[00:51:41] I'll throw on the deal for whatever the
[00:51:42] three packs are and you get all three of
[00:51:43] those packs literally you get all of
[00:51:45] them Joker so like say you wanted three
[00:51:48] of something I'll just I'll just make a
[00:51:50] deal out of them kind of because if I
[00:51:52] get three packs it allows me to save on
[00:51:54] whatnot fees if I do three things at
[00:51:56] once versus doing one at a time so I
[00:51:58] kind of make a little bit of deal and I
[00:52:01] instead of taking that extra fee to
[00:52:02] myself and making extra money I I have a
[00:52:04] little bit of a calculation that I do on
[00:52:06] on my nxl file and it allows me to
[00:52:09] figure out what it would be without the
[00:52:11] fees and subtract that and give that
[00:52:12] extra to you and that's pretty much what
[00:52:14] I do with like a deal here that's really
[00:52:16] literally all I do when it comes to the
[00:52:18] buy uh when it comes to the um that the
[00:52:21] mystery packs on the other hand or the
[00:52:23] Mystery Pack game that's a little
[00:52:24] different if you want it that in the bu
[00:52:26] uh in the notes that's perfectly fine
[00:52:28] the notes will explain that too but um
[00:52:31] yeah I'm on here like this hey how you
[00:52:33] doing thanks for coming in hanging out
[00:52:35] card King debation just doing a little
[00:52:37] bit of a little bit of a pack deal here
[00:52:40] I was explaining um the um sorry I was
[00:52:44] explaining the um pack deal to somebody
[00:52:47] somebody had asked a question about it
[00:52:49] so I just wanted to explain it so they
[00:52:51] understood what it was and we had uh we
[00:52:54] had an understanding and then I'm going
[00:52:56] to throw these on here right now we're
[00:52:59] going to get this on here
[00:53:03] for that is not
[00:53:08] correct yeah because I do a little like
[00:53:10] calculation try to make it so I can save
[00:53:13] on the whatnot fees you guys because
[00:53:16] that's they're pretty
[00:53:22] high yes that's what we'll do that's
[00:53:25] what we shall do for
[00:53:29] those that's what we shall do for
[00:53:37] those I like it that's what we're going
[00:53:39] to do that's a really that's pretty good
[00:53:42] all right let's throw those on there
[00:53:44] come on why isn't that going to
[00:53:47] work three packs on
[00:53:52] screen that's not bad I'm my other my
[00:53:55] calculation tell me to do higher and I
[00:53:57] think this is better deal you get
[00:53:59] yourself an eternal
[00:54:01] Masters a collector booster of Ravnica
[00:54:04] and a collector booster of uh Lord of
[00:54:06] the Rings

[00:54:10] some Eternal Masters but you guys you
[00:54:12] get all of them you get all three packs
[00:54:13] every time there's nothing's there's
[00:54:16] nothing no one gets something you get
[00:54:18] everything you get three packs out of it
[00:54:19] there's nothing that you miss from
[00:54:23] it all right jump in on it if you want
[00:54:28] no all right no problem yeah dude that's

[00:54:35] is um I try to give you pack deals on
[00:54:38] things that way I I have like just I
[00:54:39] literally have a calculation to my an
[00:54:41] Excel file that does a calculation that
[00:54:43] takes out the fees so that it helps
[00:54:46] helps you guys out oh dude don't worry
[00:54:48] about it man don't worry about that loss
[00:54:50] I don't mind if you come in hanging out
[00:54:51] even I don't mind even doing that I like
[00:54:53] hanging out with people and having a
[00:54:54] good time you know it's one of those
[00:54:56] things that the only reason we do that
[00:54:58] but yeah my boys were um my actually my
[00:55:00] oldest was the one that was like hey we
[00:55:02] should do some of this something like
[00:55:03] this and stream like ah I don't know
[00:55:05] he's right now instead of hanging out
[00:55:07] with me he's watching his tablet because
[00:55:09] he's not I gave him some tablet time
[00:55:11] because we're GNA be at a a soccer
[00:55:13] tournament all day today for my youngest
[00:55:17] so we did not get a chance to do
[00:55:19] anything other than uh we're not going
[00:55:22] to be able to do anything other than
[00:55:24] that today so I figured you know what
[00:55:25] I'll give him a little bit time on the
[00:55:26] tablet so he has some time to look
[00:55:28] through paying out and what I'm going to
[00:55:30] do right now is I'm going to throw on
[00:55:31] some of the singles that I have they're
[00:55:33] going to be my uh dollar ones and I have
[00:55:35] a lot of them here so I don't know if
[00:55:37] I'm gonna be able to get through them
[00:55:38] all so I'm just going to kind of throw
[00:55:40] pull a chunk of them out and if I happen
[00:55:41] to get through that whole chunk then
[00:55:43] I'll start with the next chunk all right

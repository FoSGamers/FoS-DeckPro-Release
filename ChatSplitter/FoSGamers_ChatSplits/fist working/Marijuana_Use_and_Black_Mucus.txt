Experiencing facial numbness, tingling in your hands and body, and coughing up mucus with black dots can be concerning and may have several potential causes.

1. **Cannabis Use**: Regular marijuana use can sometimes cause numbness and tingling sensations. These effects are due to THC's impact on your body's cannabinoid receptors, which can alter sensations, especially in higher doses or with certain forms of consumption like edibles【7†source】.

2. **Black Mucus**: Coughing up black mucus is particularly alarming and can indicate exposure to pollutants, chronic smoking, or more serious conditions like fungal infections, tuberculosis, or even lung cancer. The presence of black dots in your mucus suggests inhalation of substances that your body is trying to expel. This is common among people who smoke or live in heavily polluted areas【9†source】.

3. **Possible Infections**: Infections such as tuberculosis or fungal infections like Aspergillus niger can cause black mucus. These conditions are serious and require medical attention. Symptoms like numbness and tingling could be related to the overall stress and impact on your body from these infections【9†source】【8†source】.

4. **Circulation and Nerve Issues**: The tingling and numbness might also result from poor circulation or nerve compression, which can be exacerbated by vigorous coughing or other physical strain. It's important to consider conditions like transient ischemic attacks (TIA) or other neurological issues if symptoms persist【8†source】.

### Next Steps
Given these symptoms, it's crucial to seek medical advice promptly. A healthcare provider can perform necessary tests to diagnose any underlying conditions and recommend appropriate treatments.

### Summary
1. **Cannabis Use**: Can cause numbness and tingling.
2. **Black Mucus**: Indicates exposure to harmful substances or serious lung conditions.
3. **Infections**: Tuberculosis or fungal infections could be causing black mucus.
4. **Circulation and Nerve Issues**: Possible neurological concerns needing medical attention.

I've had this going on for months since I had a sickness of some kind where I initially got like COVID-type symptoms and passed out twice from coughing in January of 2021. And since then, I found out that I had anemia due to excessive bleeding from my anus due to a colon issues where they had multiple hemorrhoids and blood pustules that needed to be removed. And once that was done, my like breathing got better to the point like I was able to function, but I still had those like the coughing up stuff. Recently after the last COVID bout, I had that stuff.

Given your detailed medical history and ongoing symptoms, there are a few critical points to consider. It's essential to address both your current symptoms and any potential underlying conditions.

### Potential Causes

1. **Post-Infection Effects**:
   - **Long COVID**: Many individuals who have had COVID-19 experience prolonged symptoms, including coughing, fatigue, and respiratory issues. Long COVID can also lead to neurological symptoms like numbness and tingling【8†source】.
   - **Residual Infections**: The black mucus might indicate a lingering or secondary infection, which needs medical evaluation.

2. **Anemia**:
   - **Impact on Breathing**: Anemia can exacerbate breathing difficulties and cause fatigue, which might explain why your breathing improved after treating the colon issues. However, anemia can also cause generalized weakness and tingling sensations due to poor oxygen delivery to tissues【9†source】.

3. **Chronic Bronchitis or Other Lung Conditions**:
   - **Chronic Bronchitis**: Long-term smoking, including marijuana, can lead to chronic bronchitis, characterized by persistent cough and mucus production. The presence of black dots in mucus suggests chronic irritation or damage to the lung tissue【9†source】.

4. **Potential Neurological Issues**:
   - **Numbness and Tingling**: These symptoms could be related to nerve compression or circulation issues, especially if you have been coughing violently. Anemia can also contribute to these sensations due to reduced oxygen supply to nerves【8†source】.

### Recommendations

1. **Medical Evaluation**:
   - **Pulmonologist**: Given the chronic nature of your symptoms, a specialist in lung conditions can perform detailed tests to check for infections, chronic bronchitis, or other lung conditions.
   - **Neurologist**: For the numbness and tingling, consulting a neurologist can help rule out any nerve damage or other neurological conditions.

2. **Continued Monitoring**:
   - Keep track of your symptoms, noting any changes or triggers, which can help your healthcare provider diagnose and manage your condition effectively.

3. **Lifestyle Modifications**:
   - **Smoking Cessation**: Reducing or stopping smoking marijuana can significantly improve lung health and reduce chronic bronchitis symptoms.
   - **Healthy Diet**: Ensuring a diet rich in iron and other essential nutrients can help manage anemia and improve overall health.

4. **Follow-Up on Past Conditions**:
   - Make sure that the treatment for your colon issues has completely resolved any bleeding and that your anemia is being managed appropriately with regular check-ups.

### Summary
Your chronic coughing, black mucus, numbness, and tingling could be due to a combination of post-infection effects (potentially Long COVID), chronic bronchitis from smoking, and residual anemia. It's crucial to seek medical evaluation from both a pulmonologist and a neurologist to address these symptoms comprehensively.

[00:24:40] number from you my friend if you don't
[00:24:41] mind between one and 10 and then tell me
[00:24:44] which one of these you'd
[00:24:46] like so the way I do the break is I open
[00:24:49] all the packs I take all the mythics the
[00:24:51] rares and cards over $3 we put them in
[00:24:53] the sleeves we shuffle them up and we
[00:24:55] hand them out to everybody with their
[00:24:56] name on them and just pretty much in the
[00:24:57] order that bought it I write your name
[00:24:59] on a card and then you get it in the
[00:25:01] order you got it number seven I like it
[00:25:03] thank
[00:25:04] you one
[00:25:08] two where did we do
[00:25:12] that in Lost Caverns I like it came in
[00:25:15] the raid and we did that there you got
[00:25:18] that one coming out I like it my
[00:25:20] friend there we
[00:25:22] go everyone wins something yeah that way
[00:25:25] everyone gets something then number
[00:25:27] seven is going to go out so that's going
[00:25:28] to be one two three four five six and
[00:25:31] seven going to go into it here yeah so
[00:25:33] what happens is is that everybody gets
[00:25:35] the
[00:25:36] um just say get something out of it so
[00:25:39] mythics rares Commons I mean uncommons
[00:25:41] whether it's uncommon or common it
[00:25:43] doesn't matter if it's $3 or more goes
[00:25:44] in there and we hand them all out to
[00:25:46] everybody in there one two three in
[00:25:48] order so it's going to get shuffled up
[00:25:50] so it really doesn't matter where you
[00:25:51] buy or anything like that I just makes
[00:25:52] it easier for me to say this is how we
[00:25:54] do it and then

[01:37:10] before I can do the pack ones because it

[01:37:20] coming out next

[02:47:35] today our second one we're going to do
[02:47:37] here let's put them all together and the
[02:47:40] way I do the break so you guys know is I
[02:47:42] open all the packs everything between
[02:47:45] everything that's $3 or more gets put in
[02:47:46] a sleeve and all rares and mythics get
[02:47:48] putting in sleep all of them get um
[02:47:50] shuffled up and they end up getting
[02:47:54] handed out to the whoever pot purches
[02:47:56] them in the order that they purchased
[02:47:58] really and it doesn't really matter on
[02:47:59] the shuffling because it boils down to
[02:48:02] um it's randomized anyways because I
[02:48:04] shuffle them up and hand them up so it
[02:48:05] doesn't really matter the order that you
[02:48:06] purchase something
[02:48:08] in all right so let's get these going
[02:48:10] here two bloomo two

[03:52:23] one
[03:52:25] there not out of that one they came out
[03:52:27] of the other box for you
[03:52:32] guys yeah la list ones are kind of
[03:52:36] fun nice you hit a texture that's
[03:52:40] awesome yeah I had we had a Jew Lotus on
[03:52:42] earlier you saw that was crazy
[03:52:45] that was crazy coming out of a
[03:52:50] draft
[03:52:51] nice that's even better on the ceiling
[03:52:54] pack that's even better there when you
[03:52:56] do
[03:52:58] that all
[03:53:07] right all right cool this game
[03:53:10] sucks that's funny I know
[03:53:15] I'm
[03:53:20] sorry yeah yeah I know some people are
[03:53:23] you know I'm gonna just go buy the Lotus
[03:53:25] I've been debating on it myself like
[03:53:26] maybe I could trade someone for one or
[03:53:28] something like that I don't know but
[03:53:31] then I'm like it doesn't feel the same I
[03:53:33] didn't get it though you know it's not
[03:53:34] the same it's not mine
[03:53:44] it's someone else's that I got see
[03:53:47] that's the that's my my thought process
[03:53:49] and I have a problem with it I know it
[03:53:50] sounds problematic but it
[03:53:53] does it's not exactly Mr Fawn it's just
[03:53:57] not the
[03:53:59] same all right so we have another five
[03:54:03] minutes here this is what we're gonna be
[03:54:06] doing
[03:54:07] okay if the uh break obviously doesn't
[03:54:10] I'm not guessing the break is not going
[03:54:12] to finish
[03:54:15] in the five minutes here I'm pinning it
[03:54:19] guessing it's not going to finish so
[03:54:21] with four of you I'm going to give an
[03:54:24] option
[03:54:27] here I can adjust the packs that are in
[03:54:29] it and run it for the four of
[03:54:32] you I
[03:54:35] can
[03:54:37] clear do it cancel them all and we can
[03:54:40] uh try or and you guys will get
[03:54:42] obviously your money back or we can um
[03:54:47] try it again tomorrow and you guys can
[03:54:49] hang out there and it'll just be
[03:54:50] canceled tomorrow if we don't get finish
[03:54:52] it it's up to you but I figured out if
[03:54:55] we're not done by 11 here we're probably
[03:54:57] not going to get done anytime soon so uh
[03:55:00] that's why I was asking on
[03:55:05] that put that out for our giveaway
[03:55:07] because I forgot to do that
[03:55:11] earlier Matt perks coming in with a
[03:55:14] dread drone for the
[03:55:16] giveaway Mt
[03:55:22] perks no that's fine it doesn't hit
[03:55:24] personally I can do that I can
[03:55:26] definitely do that not a problem at all
[03:55:29] but that's why I offer it I never
[03:55:30] nothing hits
[03:55:32] me I um I plan for all kinds of things
[03:55:35] so this it will not
[03:55:37] hit Matt perks
[03:55:41] 978 and that's the other one we can work
[03:55:43] 28 if you want to out in packs too
[03:55:45] that's the other thing we can do that
[03:55:47] also if people would like to do that if
[03:55:48] you want to get some packs we can work
[03:55:50] it out in some packs for you guys
[03:55:54] instead I figure uh it's probably not
[03:55:56] going to finish here with the break so
[03:55:59] I'm going to zoom out and we're going to
[03:56:01] give you guys those options all right so

[03:56:05] here the first person to break jump in
[03:56:08] and I know I'm sorry we didn't get to
[03:56:09] finish it I was hoping we'd be able to
[03:56:10] get it uh closed out quickly cuz the
[03:56:13] last one we closed out really really

[02:55:02] cents for you for the shipping oh it

[02:55:07] free shipping it was 44 cents for the
[02:55:10] shipping I'm
[02:55:13] sorry so it looks like they must have
[02:55:15] raised the price a little bit on that so
[02:55:17] maybe you don't get the fully free I'm
[02:55:19] sorry about that I didn't know they

    - Compare your roll plus bonuses to the enemy's defense value (base is 10 for small enemies, 15 for medium, and 20 for large).

    - Example: Patriotic Warrior attacks Small Firework Bug. Rolls a 12 on the D20, adds 2 (strength), and 1 (weapon strength) for a total of 15. Small Firework Bug's defense is 10, so the attack hits and deals damage.

2. **Use an Item**
    - Select an item from your inventory.
    - Items such as health packs restore health (roll a D6 to determine the amount restored).
    - Boosters add temporary buffs (roll a D4 to determine the boost duration in turns).

    - Add agility bonuses.

    - Example: Firework Engineer uses an Engineering skill to set a trap. Rolls a 15 on the D20, adds 2 (Engineering), for a total of 17. The trap is successfully set, dealing additional damage to the enemy on their next attack.

4. **Run**
    - Roll a D20 to determine if you successfully escape.
    - Add agility bonuses.
    - If your roll plus agility bonuses equals or exceeds 15, you successfully escape.
    - If you fail, the enemy attacks.

#### Critical Hits and Health

### Rolling Mechanics for Combat

This section explains the rolling mechanics used in combat encounters in the Independence Adventure game. Each action you take in combat involves rolling a 20-sided die (D20) and sometimes additional dice (D4, D6) for specific purposes. Here’s a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to use these rolls:

#### 1. Rolling a D20 for Attacks

**Objective**: Determine if your attack hits the enemy.

- **Step 1**: Roll a D20.
  - **Example**: You roll the die, and it lands on 14.

- **Step 2**: Add any relevant bonuses to your roll. Bonuses come from your character’s attributes and the weapon you are using.
  - **Bonuses to Add**:
    - **Strength**: If your weapon relies on strength.
    - **Agility**: If your weapon relies on agility.
    - **Intelligence**: If your weapon relies on intelligence.
    - **Engineering**: If your weapon relies on engineering.
  - **Example**: Your character, the Patriotic Warrior, has a Strength of 2, and your weapon (Star-Spangled Sword) has a Strength bonus of 1. So, you add 3 to your roll (14 + 3 = 17).

- **Step 3**: Compare your total roll (including bonuses) to the enemy’s defense value.
  - **Defense Values**:
    - Small enemies: Defense value is 10.
    - Medium enemies: Defense value is 15.
    - Large enemies: Defense value is 20.
  - **Example**: You are attacking a Small Firework Bug with a defense value of 10. Your total roll is 17.

- **Step 4**: Determine the result.
  - If your total roll (including bonuses) equals or exceeds the enemy’s defense value, your attack hits.
  - **Example**: Your total roll of 17 exceeds the Small Firework Bug’s defense of 10, so your attack hits.

- **Step 5**: Roll for damage.
  - Roll the die specified for your weapon’s damage and add any relevant bonuses.
  - **Example**: The Star-Spangled Sword deals 1D6 damage. You roll a D6 and get a 4. Add your Strength bonus of 2, so the total damage is 6.

#### 2. Rolling for Critical Hits

**Objective**: Determine if your attack is a critical hit.

- **Step 1**: Roll a D20 for your attack as usual.

- **Step 2**: Check if you rolled a natural 20 (an unmodified roll of 20).
  - If you rolled a natural 20, it’s a critical hit.

- **Step 3**: Calculate damage for a critical hit.
  - Double the damage dealt by your weapon.
  - **Example**: You roll a 20 on your D20 for the attack. Your weapon’s damage is 1D6. You roll a D6 and get 5. Add your Strength bonus of 2, so the normal damage is 7. Double this damage for a critical hit, so the total damage is 14.

#### 3. Rolling for Using Items

**Objective**: Determine the effectiveness of using items such as health packs and boosters.

- **Using Health Packs**:
  - Roll a D6 to determine the amount of health restored.
  - **Example**: You use a Small Health Pack and roll a D6. You roll a 4, so you restore 4 health points.

- **Using Boosters**:
  - Roll a D4 to determine the boost duration in turns.
  - **Example**: You use a Strength Booster and roll a D4. You roll a 3, so your strength is boosted for the next 3 turns.

#### 4. Rolling for Running Away

**Objective**: Determine if you successfully escape from an encounter.

- **Step 1**: Roll a D20.
  - **Example**: You roll the die, and it lands on 12.

- **Step 2**: Add your agility bonus to the roll.
  - **Example**: Your character, the Liberty Scout, has an Agility of 2. So, you add 2 to your roll (12 + 2 = 14).

- **Step 3**: Compare your total roll (including bonuses) to the escape difficulty value (usually 15).
  - **Example**: The escape difficulty is 15. Your total roll is 14.

- **Step 4**: Determine the result.
  - If your total roll (including bonuses) equals or exceeds the escape difficulty value, you successfully escape.
  - If your total roll is less than the escape difficulty value, you fail to escape, and the enemy gets an attack.
  - **Example**: Your total roll of 14 is less than 15, so you fail to escape, and the enemy attacks you.

#### Summary of Rolling Mechanics

- **D20 Rolls**: Used for determining the success of attacks, critical hits, and running away.
- **Bonuses**: Added to your D20 roll based on your character’s attributes and weapon stats.
- **Damage Rolls**: Use additional dice (D4, D6) to determine the damage dealt by successful attacks.
- **Critical Hits**: Achieved by rolling a natural 20 on a D20, resulting in doubled damage.
- **Item Usage**: Use D4 and D6 rolls to determine the effectiveness of health packs and boosters.
- **Running Away**: Roll a D20 and add agility bonuses to determine if you can escape an encounter.

This detailed explanation should help you understand how to use dice rolls for combat and other actions in the game. Let me know if you need any further adjustments or additional details!

[2024-07-04 01:07:04] FoSGamers:
The amount of damage done by the player should be much higher on a regular basis. That way, at the final boss, they don't have to go more than 5 rounds before they can kill it. As long as they are not at medium health or below.

### Adjusted Rolling Mechanics for Higher Damage

This section explains the rolling mechanics used in combat encounters in the Independence Adventure game, with adjustments to ensure players deal higher damage on a regular basis. This will help ensure that players can defeat the final boss within five rounds if they are not at medium health or below.

#### 1. Rolling a D20 for Attacks

**Objective**: Determine if your attack hits the enemy.

- **Step 1**: Roll a D20.
  - **Example**: You roll the die, and it lands on 14.

- **Step 3**: Compare your total roll (including bonuses) to the enemy’s defense value.
  - **Defense Values**:
    - Small enemies: Defense value is 10.
    - Medium enemies: Defense value is 15.
    - Large enemies: Defense value is 20.
  - **Example**: You are attacking a Small Firework Bug with a defense value of 10. Your total roll is 17.

- **Step 4**: Determine the result.
  - If your total roll (including bonuses) equals or exceeds the enemy’s defense value, your attack hits.
  - **Example**: Your total roll of 17 exceeds the Small Firework Bug’s defense of 10, so your attack hits.

- **Step 5**: Roll for damage.
  - Roll the die specified for your weapon’s damage and add any relevant bonuses. To increase damage, we will roll two damage dice instead of one.
  - **Example**: The Star-Spangled Sword deals 2D6 damage. You roll two D6 and get 4 and 5. Add your Strength bonus of 2, so the total damage is 11.

#### 2. Rolling for Critical Hits

**Objective**: Determine if your attack is a critical hit.

- **Step 1**: Roll a D20 for your attack as usual.

- **Step 2**: Check if you rolled a natural 20 (an unmodified roll of 20).
  - If you rolled a natural 20, it’s a critical hit.

- **Step 3**: Calculate damage for a critical hit.
  - Double the damage dealt by your weapon.
  - **Example**: You roll a 20 on your D20 for the attack. Your weapon’s damage is 2D6. You roll two D6 and get 5 and 6. Add your Strength bonus of 2, so the normal damage is 13. Double this damage for a critical hit, so the total damage is 26.

#### 3. Rolling for Using Items

**Objective**: Determine the effectiveness of using items such as health packs and boosters.

- **Using Health Packs**:
  - Roll a D6 to determine the amount of health restored.
  - **Example**: You use a Small Health Pack and roll a D6. You roll a 4, so you restore 4 health points.

- **Using Boosters**:
  - Roll a D4 to determine the boost duration in turns.
  - **Example**: You use a Strength Booster and roll a D4. You roll a 3, so your strength is boosted for the next 3 turns.

#### 4. Rolling for Running Away

**Objective**: Determine if you successfully escape from an encounter.

- **Step 1**: Roll a D20.
  - **Example**: You roll the die, and it lands on 12.

- **Step 2**: Add your agility bonus to the roll.
  - **Example**: Your character, the Liberty Scout, has an Agility of 2. So, you add 2 to your roll (12 + 2 = 14).

- **Step 3**: Compare your total roll (including bonuses) to the escape difficulty value (usually 15).
  - **Example**: The escape difficulty is 15. Your total roll is 14.

- **Step 4**: Determine the result.
  - If your total roll (including bonuses) equals or exceeds the escape difficulty value, you successfully escape.
  - If your total roll is less than the escape difficulty value, you fail to escape, and the enemy gets an attack.
  - **Example**: Your total roll of 14 is less than 15, so you fail to escape, and the enemy attacks you.

#### Adjustments for Higher Damage Output

1. **Weapon Damage**: Roll two damage dice instead of one.
   - Example: Instead of 1D6, weapons will deal 2D6 damage.

2. **Critical Hits**: Continue to double the total damage for critical hits.
   - Example: If normal damage is 13, critical hit damage will be 26.

3. **Character Strength**: Ensure character bonuses are applied correctly to maximize damage output.

#### Example Encounter: Liberty Scout vs. Small Firework Bug

1. **Start the Encounter**

   - **Player**: Liberty Scout
   - **Enemy**: Small Firework Bug
   - **Health**: 120 (Liberty Scout) vs. 20 (Small Firework Bug)

   - **Enemy Health**: 20 - 11 = 9

   - **Enemy Action**: Attack
   - **Roll**: D20, result = 8
   - **Bonuses**: Agility 1 = Total 9

   - **New Agility**: 3

   - **Enemy Action**: Attack
   - **Roll**: D20, result = 16
   - **Bonuses**: Agility 1 = Total 17
   - **Player Defense**: 10
   - **Result**: Hit, roll for damage (D4), result = 3
   - **Player Health**: 120 - 3 = 117

4. **Round 3**

   - **Player Action**: Attack with Firework Bow
   - **Roll**: D20, result = 19
   - **Bonuses**: Agility 3, Weapon Agility 1 = Total 23
   - **Enemy Defense**: 10
   - **Result**: Critical Hit (high roll), roll for damage (2D6), result = 5 and 6 + Agility 3 = 14 x 2 = 28
   - **Enemy Health**: 9 - 28 = -19 (Enemy defeated)

#### Summary of Adjusted Rolling Mechanics

- **D20 Rolls**: Used for determining the success of attacks, critical hits, and running away.
- **Bonuses**: Added to your D20 roll based on your character’s attributes and weapon stats.
- **Increased Damage Rolls**: Use two damage dice (2D6) to ensure higher damage output.

#### Combat Rounds

Each round, you will choose one of four actions: attack, use an item, use a skill, or run.

1. **Attack**
    - Roll a D20 to determine if your attack hits.
    - Add any relevant bonuses (e.g., weapon strength, agility, intelligence).
    - Compare your roll plus bonuses to the enemy’s defense value (base is 10 for small enemies, 15 for medium, and 20 for large).
    - If your roll plus bonuses equals or exceeds the enemy’s defense value, your attack hits, and you deal damage based on your weapon’s damage value plus any strength bonuses.
    - **Example**: Patriotic Warrior attacks Small Firework Bug. Rolls a 12 on the D20, adds 2 (strength), and 1 (weapon strength) for a total of 15. Small Firework Bug's defense is 10, so the attack hits and deals damage.
    - Roll for damage using two damage dice instead of one to ensure higher damage output.
    - **Example**: The Star-Spangled Sword deals 2D6 damage. You roll two D6 and get 4 and 5. Add your Strength bonus of 2, so the total damage is 11.

2. **Use an Item**
    - Select an item from your inventory.
    - Items such as health packs restore health (roll a D6 to determine the amount restored).
    - Boosters add temporary buffs (roll a D4 to determine the boost duration in turns).

3. **Use a Skill**
    - Each character has skills related to their attributes.
    - Roll a D20 to determine the success of the skill.
    - Skills can provide various benefits such as increased damage, healing, or temporary buffs.
    - **Example**: Firework Engineer uses an Engineering skill to set a trap. Rolls a 15 on the D20, adds 2 (Engineering), for a total of 17. The trap is successfully set, dealing additional damage to the enemy on their next attack.

4. **Run**
    - Roll a D20 to determine if you successfully escape.
    - Add agility bonuses.
    - If your roll plus agility bonuses equals or exceeds 15, you successfully escape.
    - If you fail, the enemy attacks.

#### Critical Hits and Health

1. **Critical Hits**
    - Rolling a natural 20 (unmodified roll of 20) on the D20 results in a critical hit.
    - Critical hits deal double damage.
    - **Example**: Liberty Scout rolls a 20 on the D20. This results in a critical hit, doubling the damage

    - **Example**: Liberty Scout rolls a 20 on the D20. This results in a critical hit, doubling the damage dealt by their Firework Bow.
    - **Damage Calculation**: Roll for damage using two damage dice, then double the total damage.
    - **Example**: The Firework Bow deals 2D6 damage. You roll two D6 and get 5 and 6. Add your Agility bonus of 2, so the normal damage is 13. Double this damage for a critical hit, so the total damage is 26.

2. **Health**
    - Health is tracked throughout the encounters.
    - Use health packs to restore health during or between encounters.
    - **Example**: Freedom Medic uses a Small Health Pack during combat. Rolls a D6 and gets a 4, restoring 4 health points.

#### Boss Enemies

#### Ammo Drops

Ammo drops occur only when an enemy is defeated. The type and amount of ammo are random. Roll a D6 to determine the amount of ammo dropped:

- 1-2: 5 units of ammo
- 3-4: 10 units of ammo
- 5-6: 15 units of ammo

#### Inventory Reset

After each encounter, your boosters and critical hit chances reset. Items in the inventory remain unchanged.

### Game Continuation

#### Progression

Continue through the game, facing increasingly difficult enemies and bosses. After each encounter, choose more items to add to your inventory.

#### Endgame

Upon defeating the Glowing King of Freedom, you complete the game. The game offers replayability by allowing you to select different characters and face the enemies again with a different strategy.

### Playing the Game

Now that you have the setup and rules, let's play through an encounter to demonstrate how the mechanics work.

#### Example Encounter: Liberty Scout vs. Small Firework Bug

1. **Start the Encounter**

   - **Player**: Liberty Scout
   - **Enemy**: Small Firework Bug
   - **Health**: 120 (Liberty Scout) vs. 20 (Small Firework Bug)
   - **Buffs**: Agility 2 (Liberty Scout), Agility 1 (Small Firework Bug)

2. **Round 1**
   
   - **Player Action**: Attack with Firework Bow
   - **Roll**: D20, result = 14
   - **Bonuses**: Agility 2, Weapon Agility 1 = Total 17
   - **Enemy Defense**: 10
   - **Result**: Hit, roll for damage (2D6), result = 4 and 5 + Agility 2 = 11 damage
   - **Enemy Health**: 20 - 11 = 9

   - **Enemy Action**: Attack
   - **Roll**: D20, result = 8
   - **Bonuses**: Agility 1 = Total 9
   - **Player Defense**: 10 (base)
   - **Result**: Miss

3. **Round 2**

   - **Player Action**: Use Agility Booster
   - **Roll**: D4, result = 3 (boosts Agility by 1 for 3 turns)
   - **New Agility**: 3

   - **Enemy Action**: Attack
   - **Roll**: D20, result = 16
   - **Bonuses**: Agility 1 = Total 17
   - **Player Defense**: 10
   - **Result**: Hit, roll for damage (D4), result = 3
   - **Player Health**: 120 - 3 = 117

4. **Round 3**

   - **Player Action**: Attack with Firework Bow
   - **Roll**: D20, result = 19
   - **Bonuses**: Agility 3, Weapon Agility 1 = Total 23
   - **Enemy Defense**: 10
   - **Result**: Critical Hit (natural 19), roll for damage (2D6), result = 5 and 6 + Agility 3 = 14 x 2 = 28
   - **Enemy Health**: 9 - 28 = -19 (Enemy defeated)

#### Post-Encounter

- **Loot**: Roll for ammo drop (D6), result = 4 (10 units of ammo)
- **Pull Box**: Choose items from a pull box for your next encounter.

### Summary of Adjusted Rolling Mechanics

- **D20 Rolls**: Used for determining the success of attacks, critical hits, and running away.
- **Bonuses**: Added to your D20 roll based on your character’s attributes and weapon stats.
- **Increased Damage Rolls**: Use two damage dice (2D6) to ensure higher damage output.
- **Critical Hits**: Achieved by rolling a natural 20 on a D20, resulting in doubled damage.
- **Item Usage**: Use D4 and D6 rolls to determine the effectiveness of health packs and boosters.
- **Running Away**: Roll a D20 and add agility bonuses to determine if you can escape an encounter.

This detailed explanation should help ensure players deal higher damage on a regular basis, making it feasible to defeat the final boss within five rounds if they are not at medium health or below.

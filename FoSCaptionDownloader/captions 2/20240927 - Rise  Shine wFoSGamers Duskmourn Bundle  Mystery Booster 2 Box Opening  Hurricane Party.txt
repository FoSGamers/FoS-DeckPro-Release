[00:06:46] a hurricane but it was supposedly going
[00:06:47] to drop down to a tropical storm by the
[00:06:49] time it got to where we were hopefully
[00:06:50] everybody on the other side in Tampa
[00:06:53] area where it was uh in the Panhandle
[00:06:56] where they were supposed to be hitting
[00:06:58] is going to do better than uh and do
[00:07:00] well not have any major issues work
[00:07:04] yes yeah we're on the East Coast so

[00:07:12] on on the other side of the state here
[00:07:13] in Florida but we um we still you know
[00:07:16] we still need to prepare make sure this
[00:07:18] because we get flooding a lot on here
[00:07:20] because we e the dirty end of the storms
[00:07:22] when that happens whenever that happens
[00:07:23] we end up getting a lot of flooding so
[00:07:24] everybody's been preparing for um for
[00:07:27] flooding all in the area I guess over in

[01:04:27] well that's what I was going to say I'm
[01:04:28] going to end up probably turning it off
[01:04:34] there and we'll just open a box and see
[01:04:37] what we
[01:04:39] get because I'm not gonna I don't do
[01:04:42] those over and over again um I don't
[01:04:44] mind uh you know putting stuff out for
[01:04:46] people but the same time I
[01:04:49] uh there's a lot of people in
[01:04:51] here nobody's getting anything that not
[01:04:54] you guys right now there's a lot before
[01:04:55] the buyer they like giveaways if
[01:04:57] nobody's jumping in on anything I don't
[01:04:58] like to continue to do anything the
[01:05:00] whole point is draw people in they can
[01:05:02] pick something up with a giveway and
[01:05:03] people to hang out here all the time get
[01:05:05] something for hanging out here all the
[01:05:06] time um but uh if they just come in and
[01:05:10] leave and we're going to bunch of them
[01:05:12] that means it's just uh one of those
[01:05:13] days where everybody's in the mood to
[01:05:15] get free stuff only and I you you can
[01:05:18] kind of pick it up certain times of the
[01:05:19] year certain times of the month
[01:05:21] sometimes people are like
[01:05:23] that Bond of discipline
[01:05:26] Shepherd of the
[01:05:28] flock Cerulean wisps Wishing Well storm

[01:06:06] basics for my future
[01:06:10] site and my uh
[01:06:14] microscope Wishing Well is a nice little
[01:06:16] hit there yep it
[01:06:18] is oh the witching
[01:06:21] well saying witching well is a good
[01:06:23] little hit here I I wasn't sure I wasn't

[01:06:54] have it it's probably going to be
[01:06:55] somewhere around 30 cents to 10 cents is
[01:06:57] what I'm guessing it's not a giant hit I
[01:06:59] can put that off the side with the other
[01:07:00] one if you're looking for

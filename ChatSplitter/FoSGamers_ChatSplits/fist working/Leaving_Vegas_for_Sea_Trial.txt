How about this title:

"Leaving Vegas for Adventure: Ready for the Survey and Sea Trial!"

It captures the excitement of the journey, sets the stage for the next steps in your boat journey, and invites everyone to watch as you embark on this important milestone. Let me know if you'd like to refine it further.

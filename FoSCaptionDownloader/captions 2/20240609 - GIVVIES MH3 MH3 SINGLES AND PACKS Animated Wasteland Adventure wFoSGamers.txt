[00:00:47] the dog
[00:00:47] chared when he was walking in and took
[00:00:50] his legs out and he landed on his elbow
[00:00:52] in the uh in his in the uh hallway on
[00:00:55] tile and um well you can kind of guess
[00:00:57] what happened when the reason why we had
[00:00:58] a late night and we were at the hospital
[00:01:01] he ended up with a broken arm his elbow
[00:01:03] broke oh my I know it's not some good
[00:01:05] luck for us but you know what that means
[00:01:09] you know what that
[00:01:11] means that
[00:01:13] means he now gets to be like Dad with a
[00:01:15] bunch of broken
[00:01:17] bones well he's only got one I've had we
[00:01:21] were counting him off yesterday because
[00:01:22] I was like talking about like he was all
[00:01:24] worried about I'm like don't worry about

[00:04:14] giveaways going bigger because currently
[00:04:17] what I'm thinking we're going to do is
[00:04:18] something like this for the end of the
[00:04:19] stream I think we're gonna do something
[00:04:21] like this for the end of the
[00:04:23] stream let's do
[00:04:28] um let's do one of these things to the
[00:04:30] end of the stream
[00:04:33] giveaway put my glasses over
[00:04:36] there yeah sometimes it takes a little
[00:04:38] bit for face for thing there um YouTube
[00:04:40] to pick
[00:04:42] up so it might be a little slower so if
[00:04:45] you're on whatnot you actually pick it
[00:04:46] up a little bit
[00:04:51] faster
[00:04:53] yeah because maining on that doesn't
[00:04:57] make sense

[00:05:06] anyways cool we'll put this out there
[00:05:09] instead we'll start out with something
[00:05:11] like this for our

[01:42:37] Far those are good looking cards
[01:42:41] Quantum now remember everybody if you
[01:42:43] ever want to know what the prices of
[01:42:44] them are all you need to do is this here
[01:42:46] this the reason why I say the number is
[01:42:48] I do this so that you can type SL price
[01:42:52] space
[01:42:53] space mh3 space 378 and you can see what
[01:42:59] the price of the card
[01:43:01] is so that's why I like to do those not
[01:43:04] everybody likes to look at the price of
[01:43:05] cards because nobody not everybody cares
[01:43:07] because not a lot of people just like to
[01:43:08] play them which I do too because I don't
[01:43:10] really necessarily care about the price

[01:49:07] to be able to find it I'm gonna be
[01:49:08] searching around for 25 [ __ ]
[01:49:11] minutes that's why men don't need to put
[01:49:14] anything away they leave them where they

[03:20:41] not working anyways let me get this in
[03:20:44] here for our buddy I forgot to put that
[03:20:46] name in that because we kept getting
[03:20:47] sidetracked with the audio

[03:21:20] of a
[03:21:22] [ __ ] there it goes that can't be me
[03:21:25] then it's got to be something
[03:21:30] else that is so
[03:21:35] weird the audio shouldn't be doing
[03:21:37] anything like that
[03:21:49] microphone is
[03:21:51] auto how's that sound there does that
[03:21:54] sound any

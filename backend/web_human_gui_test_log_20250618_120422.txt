[OPENAI] {'ready': False, 'missing': ['UI components', 'interactive elements', 'data'], 'suggestion': 'Ensure the web app is fully loaded with interactive and visible elements before running tests.'}
[RAW]
I'm unable to view or analyze images directly. Please ensure the image clearly displays all elements for the 'initial_load' test. You should check that:

1. The UI is fully loaded without missing components.
2. All elements are interactive, such as buttons and links.
3. Essential data is visible.

Based on these checks, you can adjust your JSON reply accordingly:

```json
{
  "ready": false,
  "missing": ["UI components", "interactive elements", "data"],
  "suggestion": "Ensure the web app is fully loaded with interactive and visible elements before running tests."
}
```
[WARN] GUI not ready: Ensure the web app is fully loaded with interactive and visible elements before running tests.
[WARN] GUI not ready: Ensure the application loads correctly and all necessary elements are visible and interactive.
[WARN] GUI not ready: Could not parse OpenAI response.
[FAIL] Could not get GUI into correct state after retries.

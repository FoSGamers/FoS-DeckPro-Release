[00:04:25] here yes see I had surgery and I didn't
[00:04:27] get ice cream they gave me jello
[00:04:29] I I guess it had something to do with
[00:04:31] one of the uh I know generally one of
[00:04:32] those uh issues you get you know
[00:04:35] inflammation bot [Â __Â ] or whatever they
[00:04:37] want be calm everything nice and easy on
[00:04:40] you after
[00:04:41] surgery all right number 20 is what we
[00:04:43] are told we're getting out of here today

[00:04:50] 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 and 20 all right
[00:04:54] now you saw me put in yesterday some of
[00:04:57] the Assassin's Creed ones in there so
[00:04:58] that was pretty cool we added some those
[00:05:00] few of those rares in there too for you
[00:05:02] but who knows what that one will be but
[00:05:04] at the moment we're going to be opening
[00:05:08] this yeah surgeries are not fun at all
[00:05:12] ever if anybody tries to make a comment
[00:05:14] about that maybe if you're a surgeon it
[00:05:17] might be fun I was going to school to do
[00:05:19] that but I just didn't want to be poor
[00:05:21] and I realized later now as an older
[00:05:23] person that I would have made money back
[00:05:24] within a couple you know three to 10
[00:05:26] years three to five years then I would
[00:05:28] have Mak a lot of money but I just
[00:05:30] starting out with no money then seeing a
[00:05:32] large Bill like that scares
[00:05:37] you so anyways let's open this thing up
[00:05:40] this is what I wanted to open today with
[00:05:41] you guys have some fun with and see if
[00:05:44] we get anything for good luck remember
[00:05:45] you guys can jump in and hang out with
[00:05:47] us now I do have all kinds of things
[00:05:48] there and we can um we're going to use
[00:05:50] this when we're going through our game
[00:05:52] our little Adventure today find where I
[00:05:54] am
[00:05:55] here get rid of that screen get rid of
[00:05:58] that oh no need that screen we'll keep
[00:06:00] that one in the background I think
[00:06:01] that'll be
[00:06:02] fine then
[00:06:07] go I think we ended in right we were uh
[00:06:09] we just finished imagin I believe it was
[00:06:12] correct I think we there there we're at
[00:06:14] bug's nest if you just killed the bug
[00:06:17] got all your rewards from killing off
[00:06:18] the bug correct I think that's what we
[00:06:20] just finished at and then you're heading
[00:06:22] back to the super
[00:06:25] brothel on the top of the mountain
[00:06:28] because you kill the bug now I I don't
[00:06:30] know did we take anything as a souvenir
[00:06:32] from them so they knew that we killed it
[00:06:34] or did we just like drive away I can't
[00:06:35] remember on that one you guys going to
[00:06:36] help me
[00:06:38] here think I think I get I think I think
[00:06:41] we just drove away you think we need to
[00:06:43] turn around and get souvenir because I
[00:06:44] was thinking about that you probably
[00:06:46] need
[00:06:47] something you know it's for them to
[00:06:49] recognize we actually did it you think
[00:06:52] that's
[00:06:54] necessary what's the dice look like oh
[00:06:56] we'll look at it in a second we'll see
[00:06:57] it we'll see it so I think where we are
[00:07:00] is we're on our way to uh here let's
[00:07:05] see yeah we're on our way back to the
[00:07:07] arer yeah we definitely were we just
[00:07:08] finished off bugs nest right I think
[00:07:11] that's what we just finished off it was
[00:07:12] bug's Nest let me know if I'm right
[00:07:15] anyways I'm going to open this up we'll
[00:07:17] see what our our inside interior is for
[00:07:21] our our dice because I have not seen the
[00:07:22] dice in life yet so it' be kind of cool
[00:07:24] to see that's your uh Art card
[00:07:27] there not bad forcea uh force of what is
[00:07:31] force of cultivation I think that's what
[00:07:32] it is wa the wrong one flare cultivation
[00:07:38] that's what it is not forc I knew I got
[00:07:40] the wrong
[00:07:42] word not bad I like the I like showing
[00:07:45] all the Arts there that's actually kind
[00:07:46] of a cool one I might keep that one
[00:07:48] because it shows all the Arts on those
[00:07:49] cards that's a kind of a sweet one there
[00:07:52] A lot of times I like they they just
[00:07:53] kind of end up in the trash because I
[00:07:54] have nowhere to put those I'd love to
[00:07:56] have like them smaller that I could put
[00:07:58] them in like a you know B or something F
[00:08:00] in binders but I don't
[00:08:03] know
[00:08:05] Wizards
[00:08:07] anyways
[00:08:08] box and oh it's
[00:08:11] sparkly look at that one I haven't seen
[00:08:14] a sparkly dice in a
[00:08:16] while well it's uh I can have a feeling
[00:08:19] my wife might be stealing this dice soon
[00:08:21] and I may no longer have this one and
[00:08:22] that that oh that means I get my rock
[00:08:24] one back oh I might get the dino Rock
[00:08:27] one back then ah whenever he plays she
[00:08:29] seals one my Dice and I never get it
[00:08:30] it's one of my favorite ones that I use
[00:08:32] when she's not playing so well look at
[00:08:34] that that's not cool that's not bad GI
[00:08:36] box
[00:08:38] here I like
[00:08:41] it we'll see step is this yours
[00:08:48] now oh hold on hold on all right here we
[00:08:51] go so here what our our packs here
[00:08:55] that's intriguing how they have been
[00:08:56] stuck in the middle you notice that
[00:08:58] anybody other me I might be a little
[00:09:00] silly on that one
[00:09:02] but they uh normally these are on one
[00:09:05] side of the other I don't me see in the
[00:09:07] middle intriguing just thought it was on
[00:09:10] why not let's see what's in here now we
[00:09:12] already know what's in them for lands
[00:09:14] like I said before we've seen these many
[00:09:17] times full art lands and then your
[00:09:21] uh Power Balance but I'm going to open
[00:09:24] them up
[00:09:26] anyways how's it going
[00:09:29] hey where how's it going I know the dice
[00:09:31] is pretty cool looking I have to admit
[00:09:33] I'm I'm I was impressed by
[00:09:36] it so let's see hey oh we got our little
[00:09:40] giveaway running right now we're just
[00:09:41] opening our box here remember everybody
[00:09:44] uh so open it generally I I keep some of
[00:09:47] the cards I will use for my family but
[00:09:49] the rest of them we kind of sell off
[00:09:50] because I don't really need all of them
[00:09:52] and we're going to be on a boat so uh
[00:09:55] can't keep all of them anyways because
[00:09:56] I'm not going to have a time of space
[00:09:57] for my own personal stuff if I'm going
[00:09:59] to have a little bit of space for some
[00:10:00] of the things I we do for you guys here
[00:10:02] oh look at that little oh no that's just
[00:10:05] junk That's Just Junk that's all the
[00:10:08] lands you can see all the full arts
[00:10:10] which is kind of sweet I like that then
[00:10:13] oh there's junk plane ones well they're
[00:10:16] not junk C ones I like the art on them
[00:10:17] though that's pretty it's still pretty
[00:10:19] cool though I like the full art ones
[00:10:21] better if you get a gift bundle I was
[00:10:23] expecting all the Full Art ones that's a
[00:10:25] little disappointing all righty oh look
[00:10:28] at that Mr
[00:10:30] Fong you have yourself a Hy stack all
[00:10:35] right little Hy stack from
[00:10:38] uh the new set there now Mr Fong I got a

[00:11:16] on like a on a premium product when it
[00:11:19] comes to like they're saying this Bo
[00:11:20] gift box set I would expect to get all
[00:11:22] of the full art ones even though they
[00:11:25] were like non-foil versions of them I
[00:11:26] expect to get all of them that's a
[00:11:27] little disappointing there
[00:11:31] guess I didn't read it explicitly
[00:11:34] but these are still pretty cool you get
[00:11:36] whole kind you all these packs in The
[00:11:38] Collector booster I'm telling you we're

[00:12:12] thing

[00:13:03] again guys I pay premium
[00:13:06] Wizards give you the premium part of it

[00:13:17] I just got hit with you you know what
[00:13:19] I'm talking about you guys know what I'm

[00:13:23] right disappointing all
[00:13:26] right let's see the cards are nice so I
[00:13:29] do like the full arts though I will
[00:13:31] definitely say the full arts are
[00:13:32] sweet hey am I going to get this now or
[00:13:35] is this yours I get the other one that
[00:13:36] will go great was my mermaid de can I
[00:13:38] get the other dice back in that whenever
[00:13:40] whenever you use it you always take that
[00:13:41] the wrong one okay I told you what was
[00:13:44] going to happen all right you any
[00:13:47] mermaids yet um I have not gotten I have
[00:13:49] gotten a couple I don't think I got the
[00:13:50] ones you wanted but we have um that was
[00:13:53] in the otj jet stuff though I was
[00:13:55] debating on buying a collector booster
[00:13:57] box of that if you want me to try to see
[00:13:58] if we can get it more
[00:14:01] all
[00:14:02] right hey he bones watch out with you
[00:14:04] the whip tail all right ladies and
[00:14:08] gentlemen hey George how you
[00:14:12] doing alrighty so let me uh all right
[00:14:16] we'll throw out one of these in the buy
[00:14:17] now it's already here but I I'll pin it
[00:14:19] up so you guys can see it now what we do
[00:14:20] here with our adventure game we've been
[00:14:22] playing before uh just so you guys kind
[00:14:24] of know is we uh we go about it as if uh
[00:14:27] you know what you guys get to pick up
[00:14:28] and TR along with us now I realized my
[00:14:31] instructions did not go in the B game
[00:14:33] the last couple times which means when I
[00:14:35] said hey check something out that's why
[00:14:37] people didn't understand things so I'm
[00:14:39] going to explain at the beginning here
[00:14:40] and make it a little easier
[00:14:42] so the reason why the boxes are there is
[00:14:47] if you guys spot a box along the way
[00:14:48] it's pretty much you get to take over
[00:14:50] because you're spotting a box as a
[00:14:51] character and something ends up
[00:14:53] happening from the box now one of the
[00:14:54] times you guys saw you got ammo for
[00:14:56] plasma rifle then a couple times later
[00:14:59] you got a plasma rifle from them so like
[00:15:01] you get things from these boxes that you
[00:15:03] find along the way where start get when
[00:15:05] you're getting in the game like items
[00:15:07] maybe that you need they're a little
[00:15:08] kind of like added bonus for you uh
[00:15:11] whenever you pick it up and then
[00:15:13] sometimes you even uh maybe a special
[00:15:14] encounter Direction now that's why I had
[00:15:16] been built them I guess I didn't explain
[00:15:19] that because I didn't put the directions
[00:15:20] in in the notes so I'm sorry about
[00:15:24] that uh now hopefully that makes a
[00:15:26] little bit more sense on what the boxes
[00:15:28] are for and why been saying hey buy one
[00:15:30] of the boxes check them
[00:15:32] out so I realized I did not even put
[00:15:34] them in the instructions when I was
[00:15:36] like looking the other day I'm like the
[00:15:38] instructions aren't even in the notes
[00:15:39] and I hit the notes to say poll the
[00:15:41] notes from the last day and it was the
[00:15:43] notes from the one that I uh from the
[00:15:45] one before and I was like oh crap
[00:15:48] so figured I'd repeat to tell you what
[00:15:50] it is now let's take a look at where GI
[00:15:52] for some cards
[00:15:54] here all right nice box
[00:15:59] kids don't use these anymore they used
[00:16:00] to play with them I'm pretty happy they
[00:16:01] don't anymore because it doesn't you
[00:16:03] don't really we're not goingon to have
[00:16:04] room for that stuff not gonna have room
[00:16:06] for that stuff on the boat but that
[00:16:07] gives me another box to hold things in
[00:16:09] look at that Wizards that one thing that
[00:16:10] you do have a use for when you give me
[00:16:13] these you give me you give me an extra
[00:16:14] box to hold stuff in but I am upset I
[00:16:16] didn't get the extra little ones little
[00:16:17] ones are
[00:16:18] sweet anyways let's see they're all
[00:16:22] upside down this one's backwards so
[00:16:26] we're going to go with the upside down
[00:16:27] packs I I jumped them out I'm just
[00:16:29] joking around all right here we go I'm
[00:16:31] going to go and we're going to
[00:16:37] say I wonder if I should shuffle them up
[00:16:39] or if I should see because we've been
[00:16:40] getting ones where it started at the top
[00:16:42] and it started at the back where you got
[00:16:44] the good ones there's none of them that
[00:16:45] were like the middle ones where I was
[00:16:46] getting them so I think what I'm going
[00:16:48] to do this time I'm going to take the
[00:16:49] first two bottom two top two and the
[00:16:52] bottom to moveing the end that way we're
[00:16:54] going to see if the middle ones have lck
[00:16:57] and for they always if it always wears
[00:16:58] it cutting the middle ones out when they
[00:17:00] send you these boxes so you don't get a
[00:17:01] good pack let's see what that is all
[00:17:04] right or you guys too the other things
[00:17:06] are the loot boxes we've been using them
[00:17:07] from the other games because you can
[00:17:08] kind of use it the same way if you want
[00:17:10] to participate too do that or buy a pack
[00:17:14] cards if you want to jump in that way
[00:17:16] too but anyways we're going to keep this
[00:17:19] running because I do want to open these
[00:17:21] and see what we get take our ninja or
[00:17:24] samurai sword out I love these things my
[00:17:27] kid loves them too
[00:17:29] they're actually really they are really
[00:17:30] really sharp they are the sharpest
[00:17:31] things I've ever own for a pair of uh
[00:17:33] scissors they they cut through stuff
[00:17:35] that I shouldn't be cutting through with
[00:17:37] them I didn't cut a finger off
[00:17:41] yet we'll find out if that one works
[00:17:44] it's only torture if necessary you know
[00:17:47] if I'm in a situation you need I should

[00:21:01] so you understand I made a I made a
[00:21:02] mistake earlier I realized I've been
[00:21:03] saying hey like acting like you
[00:21:05] understood what I was talking about with
[00:21:06] the game where how you do it and
[00:21:08] everything and the instructions of the
[00:21:09] boxes I realized that I did not put the
[00:21:11] instructions in the notes and it made it
[00:21:13] a little bit harder for you to
[00:21:15] understand why I was saying just buy a
[00:21:16] box get a box whenever you want to play
[00:21:17] Well the box is point of the box is
[00:21:20] there's something that occurs with the
[00:21:21] Box get it's like either an encounter an
[00:21:23] item or something like that you know to
[00:21:26] work now love you a good
[00:21:31] day hey as long as your pictur your um
[00:21:34] your video showed me not long
[00:21:38] off the video you sent me the other day

[00:22:00] our boat because we're going to see it
[00:22:01] and there's going to be a problem with
[00:22:02] it I was just going to have headaches
[00:22:04] because when I was driving by it when we
[00:22:06] went bu on the interr S on my boat it
[00:22:09] will be uh it wasn't a uh I didn't think
[00:22:12] it looked it look like rubbed against a
[00:22:14] uh like a pyin or something it could
[00:22:16] have possibly caused a hole at some
[00:22:17] point was patched so that's what I need
[00:22:19] to check myself I need to be confirmed
[00:22:20] in that that was my main concern when I
[00:22:22] saw
[00:22:23] it so do follow check in like And

[00:22:49] item or something like that that's
[00:22:51] picked up I forgot to mentioned that and
[00:22:53] I thought I had it in the notes so I'm

[00:28:26] of them you're at a good deal for most
[00:28:30] things they're actually generally around
[00:28:31] uh my understanding I've been told
[00:28:32] recently is they're actually a lot
[00:28:34] cheaper than a lot of the lgs's around
[00:28:36] even with shipping so come on in hang
[00:28:38] out piix something up if you
[00:28:41] want and uh let's have some
[00:28:43] fun they're
[00:28:45] welcome thank you guys for hanging out
[00:28:48] now no one wanted that guess I'll throw
[00:28:52] those back over
[00:28:54] here let's see if somebody wants to um
[00:28:58] get anything else I'm going to open up
[00:29:00] the other packs that I have here now
[00:29:01] that we finished let's pin
[00:29:04] this if people want some of
[00:29:07] these that's not a bad one there good
[00:29:09] deal on all those also so did you check
[00:29:12] the out the buy now there hopefully
[00:29:13] there's something you'd like to pick up
[00:29:15] and I'm going just do one pack here of
[00:29:17] this again then I'm going to go into our
[00:29:19] game I wanted to open a couple packs
[00:29:21] first to see how lucky I was say how my
[00:29:23] thoughts process was where the middle is
[00:29:25] like a they leave the stuff out of the
[00:29:27] middle when they give you the bundles
[00:29:28] because as you notice the bundles are
[00:29:30] are in different order of their cards my
[00:29:32] understanding is because they are not
[00:29:34] Japanese ones because they don't have a
[00:29:36] tear that's what I've been told and
[00:29:38] that's what I've read I have not had
[00:29:40] confirmation from anybody at wizard so
[00:29:42] you or not haven't seen being made in
[00:29:44] Japan so that's the other thing too all
[00:29:46] right here we go good luck let's see
[00:29:48] this let's see
[00:29:49] it mol gatekeeper tune The Narrative
[00:29:53] basking brood scale wither and Bloom
[00:29:56] Zola sell it
[00:29:59] OB obstinate gargoyle Twisted landscape
[00:30:02] signature slam coffee crook muster The
[00:30:05] Departed razor grash Ambush decree of
[00:30:08] Justice dream tide
[00:30:11] whale warped tusker foil an insect all
[00:30:16] right so
[00:30:18] far my hypothesis seems to be accurate
[00:30:22] we'll find out again I'll be right back
[00:30:25] I run I gotta go pick that thing out of
[00:30:28] my cheek because it's bugging the crap
[00:30:30] out of me when I do things like that and
[00:30:32] have to run away for a second I do I
[00:30:34] generally throw a little deal on for you
[00:30:35] guys so this is what I'm going to do
[00:30:38] right
[00:30:39] now 45 seconds I'm gonna have that run
[00:30:43] maybe somebody would like a modern
[00:30:45] Horizon 3 elector
[00:30:48] booster for uh
[00:30:50] 38 put that
[00:30:52] there I'll be right
[00:30:56] back e
[00:31:50] yeah better sorry men that have a beards
[00:31:54] you'll understand sometimes when you
[00:31:57] shave like hair will be poking re and
[00:31:59] it's like the wrong length and it'll
[00:32:00] start poking into your lip area I just
[00:32:02] had to go and shave it clip it down a
[00:32:04] little longer
[00:32:06] shorter no one wanted
[00:32:10] that
[00:32:12] surprising
[00:32:13] surprising well that's okay we're going
[00:32:16] to see uh going to check out a boat

[00:40:04] tanks got his own little show got some
[00:40:05] vintage items for uh bar stuff it was
[00:40:08] actually pretty cool but I still had we
[00:40:09] weren't going to be moving out of a
[00:40:10] house there's a couple items I saw there
[00:40:13] for it that I I liked I've actually
[00:40:15] debated on getting one of them like I
[00:40:17] thought might be cool oh we got a foil
[00:40:19] in there that might be cool in the boat
[00:40:22] look at that one I got a foil Big Pop
[00:40:24] you got this for our giveaway
[00:40:28] is that
[00:40:30] generator there was one of the uh signs
[00:40:33] that one of like there was one of the
[00:40:34] neon signs I think it was like a
[00:40:36] Guinness one if I remember I thought you
[00:40:38] had I was like oh that's
[00:40:42] intriguing but I have to figure out if a
[00:40:44] I'm like what kind of a boat I'm G to
[00:40:45] have and if it's G to fit that type of a
[00:40:48] thing big it was one of those ones I saw
[00:40:51] in the background but there's a big
[00:40:53] thing so that's my problem so not I
[00:40:55] can't have big things I can have small
[00:40:58] things so that's kind like well it
[00:41:00] depends on the size of the boat maybe I
[00:41:02] can get a big
[00:41:03] boat a hard time Big
[00:41:07] Pop a

[01:21:17] right all righty
[01:21:19] so we'll run some more of that giveaway
[01:21:23] get that running so we can see how that
[01:21:25] goes and then what I will do now is
[01:21:28] we'll throw out some of the other ones
[01:21:29] if you want to try any of the game with
[01:21:31] us now the bundle the boxes here the
[01:21:33] whole point I was making them because
[01:21:34] people like to get bundles uh so I give
[01:21:37] people the option TR I can give them the
[01:21:38] potential of getting one and the way I
[01:21:40] like to build everyone is kind of like
[01:21:41] you would get a pack of cards too you
[01:21:43] know you buy spend like maybe might
[01:21:45] spend 10 $20 on a pack but you might get
[01:21:46] a $7 or you could get a $300 card or
[01:21:48] $200 card or $20 card or $150 card so
[01:21:51] that's kind of how I build it build it
[01:21:53] that's kind of how I do to do it so
[01:21:56] that's why I do them this way I don't
[01:21:57] like having like wicked high Wicked low
[01:21:59] Wicked Crazy Ones um I'm not a big fan
[01:22:01] of that but that's just me personally
[01:22:03] you know I like others others like do
[01:22:05] their own thing so anyways we'll throw
[01:22:07] one of these out see if you want to take
[01:22:08] over our characters as they're traveling
[01:22:10] through the Wast land here
[01:22:12] now we had our reward from that person
[01:22:15] and I think we're going to end up
[01:22:16] heading out because
[01:22:19] uh we have nothing further to do my God
[01:22:21] my hair poking my cheek again
[01:22:24] so we got nothing more to do there since
[01:22:27] no one decided they wanted to do
[01:22:28] anything to help out even the chat
[01:22:29] wasn't saying they wanted to do anything
[01:22:30] to help out so um we just continued on
[01:22:33] left
[01:22:35] Silverton and you're on your way out now
[01:22:38] these people heading over to
[01:22:48] um oh dang it
[01:22:59] there you go I made a mistake
[01:23:02] there that's why it didn't show up I was
[01:23:04] wondering why my picture wasn't there
[01:23:06] here's a dice by the way I like that
[01:23:08] that's the dice from my wife's going to
[01:23:09] steal it she already told me it's hers
[01:23:13] now you're now uh
[01:23:30] all right so we have that giveway
[01:23:32] running no one wanted to jump in the Box
[01:23:34] we're leaving Silverton on our way to
[01:23:37] our new location now our new location
[01:23:39] because we head down the road the road's
[01:23:41] blocked again Road's always going to be
[01:23:42] blocked in these
[01:23:48] locations that is the silliest thing in
[01:23:50] the
[01:23:53] world now
[01:23:56] that's pretty
[01:24:03] funny I use uh my my AI that I use here
[01:24:07] to help with uh do the pictures for
[01:24:09] whenever we're doing this so I can run
[01:24:11] do them immediately while we're running
[01:24:12] and doing this because I can't make this
[01:24:13] stuff quickly myself I'm not I'm not a
[01:24:16] an artist I can describe things which is
[01:24:19] what works very well for me with that
[01:24:24] so you end up having to take a trip
[01:24:26] through a different direction though
[01:24:27] it's not good it's a little rocky train
[01:24:31] dangerous looking and you have to head
[01:24:33] out through this new location as you
[01:24:38] head through the new pass what are you
[01:24:41] guys going to do here you think there's
[01:24:43] going to be any issues you gonna find
[01:24:44] anything along the
[01:24:48] way huh anyone no one all right we'll
[01:24:52] keep going all yourself
[01:24:55] here it's a rough morning here uh if
[01:24:58] anyone wants to participate I guess it's
[01:24:59] not one of those GS maybe we just rip
[01:25:01] the Box open and we continue on with
[01:25:03] that we don't go with the game until
[01:25:04] somebody wants to jump in maybe that's
[01:25:06] what we do I think I'll continue on and
[01:25:08] I'll do that here we go so we'll open
[01:25:11] the Pack Box we'll finish I have one two
[01:25:14] three four these are the last of the
[01:25:16] middle ones then I have nope that was
[01:25:19] the last of the middle ones that I got

[01:45:40] another Magic Mountain and the Magic
[01:45:41] Mountain boock the reason why you get

[01:50:15] going to put this up a little higher on
[01:50:20] here move forward no move there do we
[01:50:23] zoom in
[01:50:28] still all the way back there yes do

[02:07:03] questions let me know like I said we um
[02:07:06] I don't generally do singles so that's
[02:07:07] another thing a lot of times I do packs

[02:07:13] don't mind telling hey if you need some
[02:07:14] singles go over to this person that type
[02:07:16] of thing because I do packs and
[02:07:17] different things you know there's a
[02:07:19] different atmosphere per Channel and
[02:07:21] what people people are looking for at
[02:07:22] times and I don't mind that that's what
[02:07:24] people seem
[02:07:25] to maybe forget not everybody's the same
[02:07:29] there's that's why I always say a rising
[02:07:31] tide lifts all boats it's one of my
[02:07:33] saying I say because if even if I you
[02:07:35] know say I have somebody likes something

[02:07:37] another person's doing because we're
[02:07:39] pulling them in it helps raise everybody
[02:07:41] else up to get some other stuff and have
[02:07:42] more fun and you pull somebody else in
[02:07:44] like oh well this is kind of cool I'm G
[02:07:45] hang out there so it's I it's not a
[02:07:47] problem with me I'm good with that
[02:07:54] and let's see what we do here I'm going
[02:07:56] to put out my um lzo tap quy next I
[02:08:00] don't know if that makes any sense to
[02:08:02] all
[02:08:03] y'all all
[02:08:06] right plus I really like boats yes plus
[02:08:09] I really like
[02:08:10] boats I really like boats well I'm going
[02:08:13] to live on a boat soon we're going to
[02:08:15] look at one today at 1 3 pm want to
[02:08:19] check one of the boats out that I'm
[02:08:21] interested in
[02:08:23] purchasing uh not a house boat it's a uh
[02:08:27] well it'll end up being one it's
[02:08:28] catamaran we liveing on a catarin and
[02:08:30] traveling for a little while for a few
[02:08:31] years because we have um just stuff's
[02:08:35] getting ridiculously expensive and we
[02:08:38] can afford it
[02:08:39] but I don't want to be house poor and
[02:08:42] poor to the taxes and poor to everything
[02:08:43] else I I had a boat and like it's
[02:08:45] getting expensive to even have a boat to
[02:08:47] go fishing regularly and at the dock
[02:08:49] like it used to things just have gone up
[02:08:50] so much
[02:08:52] that uh it's not fun being stressed
[02:08:54] about just making sure you can even do
[02:08:56] regular stuff let alone have fun anymore
[02:08:59] so we figured we might as well there's
[02:09:01] issues with school the kids I was a
[02:09:03] teacher prior to what I do I did in the
[02:09:06] past so I can teach especially once we
[02:09:09] have a material and stuff that we're
[02:09:11] getting to do it with and I've taught
[02:09:14] everywhere from elementary um to high
[02:09:17] school um I did a full my full fulltime
[02:09:20] was when I was in high school for while
[02:09:21] I taught High School um but um I did
[02:09:23] like long-term substituting and um like
[02:09:26] when make parent teachers were out like
[02:09:27] on pregnancy leave type thing um I took
[02:09:30] over and I did those in my area so I've
[02:09:32] done that for like all kinds of Ages so
[02:09:34] I know I can handle the teaching aspect
[02:09:36] and I think it'll be better because we
[02:09:37] actually be able to learn from different
[02:09:38] areas around the you know around the
[02:09:40] world when we're talking about fish or
[02:09:41] we're talking about a culture or we're
[02:09:42] talking about history we can actually be
[02:09:43] there so that's why I was trying to try
[02:09:45] to do is tailor it that way a little bit
[02:09:47] for him too so you're going to actually
[02:09:49] remember what's going on because you did
[02:09:51] it you remember what happened versus you
[02:09:53] don't remember anything because you're
[02:09:54] just being told and you see a picture
[02:09:56] you
[02:09:57] know yeah something that I always kind
[02:10:00] of wanted to do and then uh my wife my
[02:10:03] wife wants to record it so we'll see how
[02:10:05] that goes um so if you want to You'll I
[02:10:08] think it's bigger boat Adventures we'll
[02:10:09] have out there starting
[02:10:15] soon yes watching the sun come up is
[02:10:17] awesome see I was a fisherman my family
[02:10:19] are all fishermen and I grew up on the
[02:10:21] water uh regularly and I I remember I
[02:10:24] mean I go out with my father fishing um
[02:10:27] probably from the age of like 14 on I
[02:10:29] helped him more rly than other times and
[02:10:32] uh he you know it was good it was always
[02:10:35] a great experience and yes it was hard
[02:10:38] work but it was rewarding because you
[02:10:40] always had something you're done with
[02:10:43] and as soon as you were done with it you
[02:10:45] kind of uh you knew you succeeded in
[02:10:48] some way and if you were had a rough
[02:10:49] time you still were out there pushing
[02:10:50] and doing something hard so I don't know

[02:53:24] of that um some of the left over of that
[02:53:27] we were uh because we had to drive
[02:53:29] through um to get home to Florida uh the
[02:53:32] other day are you guys okay though over
[02:53:36] there

[02:54:09] go hopefully you're okay though Mahaya
[02:54:13] wait I thought you were you're okay down
[02:54:16] there I um I was like I said I was down
[02:54:17] in Texas the other day so I did see a
[02:54:19] little bit of um stuff that occurred so
[02:54:21] hopefully everything's okay and you're
[02:54:23] okay and you're safe your family and
[02:54:25] everything's safe like that because know
[02:54:27] those things are really
[02:54:30] scary yeah I know I saw that we drove
[02:54:32] through um around that area and we were
[02:54:35] going through some of the areas on the
[02:54:36] outside kind of more towards the ocean
[02:54:38] area can't remember what town we were in
[02:54:41] and we could see the trees down all over
[02:54:42] the place one of the trees was just cut
[02:54:43] in half so that you could get through
[02:54:45] the road
[02:54:49] we're on 10 I 10 though
[02:54:54] so yeah it's crazy that's good that
[02:54:56] you're okay that's good that you're okay

[02:55:04] near built for that type of um
[02:55:06] hurricanes
[02:55:07] anymore so um what happens is like no
[02:55:10] one no one prepares the same as they
[02:55:12] used to when it came to like hurricanes
[02:55:15] or anything like that like uh like in
[02:55:18] Florida they're prepared more in New
[02:55:20] England they're prepared for like nor
[02:55:22] easers so like there there stuff they
[02:55:24] get either get out very quickly to
[02:55:25] handle it um or they um have ways of
[02:55:30] keeping it like running on a regular
[02:55:33] basis let's see what else we have here

[03:05:04] where I got hit by the car that said I
[03:05:06] was that they ended up they going to
[03:05:07] court for reckless driving because they
[03:05:09] tried to run me off the
[03:05:13] road no I [Â __Â ] you not on the way to
[03:05:16] Texas from Florida someone tried to like
[03:05:19] pass like 50 cars on the inside when
[03:05:21] there was a trailer truck in front of me
[03:05:23] by like three cars and that trailer
[03:05:24] truck was trying to pass another trailer
[03:05:25] truck and um they decided they want to
[03:05:28] get inside in my Lane in front of me and
[03:05:30] I guess they didn't they didn't care
[03:05:31] that I had a truck and they had an a
[03:05:33] Honda a cord you know whatever then they
[03:05:36] um decided to keep pulling in and I laid
[03:05:38] on my horn because I'm literally they
[03:05:39] were gonna sideswipe me so I hit my
[03:05:42] brakes and they kept going in even and
[03:05:45] if I didn't hit my brakes I would have
[03:05:47] like probably bit maneuvered that person
[03:05:48] into the woods but um I ended up because
[03:05:51] I hit my brakes she just rubbed off the
[03:05:53] front of my car and I I did like a
[03:05:54] little wobble she did a wobble pulled
[03:05:56] over and had to deal with
[03:05:59] police yeah I hate
[03:06:02] them I I'm GNA say I was not happy with
[03:06:05] that I was like you're gonna be [Â __Â ]
[03:06:06] me this is ridiculous and then the
[03:06:07] person lied to the uh the cop which was
[03:06:10] nice because I had a my wife had a
[03:06:12] picture of what happened because the
[03:06:14] person got in front of us and I was like
[03:06:15] take a picture of the license plate
[03:06:16] because it didn't look like there was
[03:06:17] shopping and because of that she got in
[03:06:19] front of us she showed that she told the
[03:06:21] police officer she was never in front of
[03:06:22] us that we pulled into her Lane and hit
[03:06:24] her then she had to change your story

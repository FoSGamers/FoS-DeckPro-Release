[00:02:01] there that
[00:02:11] time again is that what they're all
[00:02:14] going to be like that's GNA be
[00:02:16] intriguing if they're all like
[00:02:20] that there's going to be at least one
[00:02:24] isn't
[00:02:28] right only those
[00:02:34] to all righty ping these out

[00:02:45] zoom in a little bit oh look at that
[00:02:46] ending right at the end
[00:02:52] again future I'm going to end up having
[00:02:55] to use some of this stuff as hype
[00:02:57] packing why is he sending me trash
[00:03:00] well it's because I'm using it as
[00:03:01] packing
[00:03:04] material just trying to figure out ways
[00:03:06] to reuse things like oh I can use some
[00:03:09] of these things they're kind of like
[00:03:11] bubble wrap if you if you bubble if you
[00:03:13] crunch them
[00:03:15] up that'll
[00:03:19] work like a like a what peanuts I
[00:03:24] it Just Junk you thre away but it work
[00:03:28] to protect your stuff
[00:03:31] what would being
[00:03:35] Shi just handing everything out
[00:03:39] here as I told you I would do
[00:04:04] not allowed to slide around like that
[00:04:11] unacceptable two
[00:04:15] there I don't know if that was two or
[00:04:17] not
[00:04:59] you
[00:05:09] well if there's anybody in here I don't
[00:05:12] know he not I may have just tyed
[00:05:14] something I don't even know I do know I
[00:05:17] just knocked over the
[00:05:24] light knock keyboard down sorry
[00:05:28] about that think I end at the end
[00:05:43] there one for the last
[00:05:45] one I Oran these
[00:05:56] things not that it really matters since
[00:05:58] the last one is the same
[00:06:22] person there we
[00:06:25] go better
[00:06:27] there going into the last person here
[00:06:49] out again
[00:06:55] too doing the same thing
[00:06:59] these are all the ones that you guys saw
[00:07:01] me pull earlier today I'm
[00:07:04] just hang them
[00:07:07] out so I can finish putting away to be
[00:07:16] pack already packed up just need to
[00:07:19] finish by putting this stuff
[00:07:28] in
[00:07:58] for got nice crisp on these
[00:08:01] uh cards for some they're very good
[00:08:05] um no
[00:08:45] stuck all together almost again not it
[00:08:49] ful matter just throw throw everything
[00:08:51] off I one
[00:09:04] some point in time someone's going to
[00:09:06] watch this video I can't believe this
[00:09:07] person did that with those
[00:09:12] cards like 20 years from now like such a
[00:09:16] disregard for
[00:09:19] them look at the olun he just threw it
[00:09:22] down like nothing
[00:09:34] that's why I record because show
[00:09:38] you back at this point in time did not
[00:09:41] care about this stuff the same manner as
[00:09:44] you care about it now not that we do not
[00:09:47] care about it we just not careed in the
[00:09:49] same
[00:09:51] manner World changes
[00:10:15] matter since those two are
[00:10:17] together they to hit it out so it
[00:10:19] doesn't going to matter at that point
[00:10:38] that was the one we were unsure of at
[00:10:39] one point so I just put it in a sleeve
[00:10:41] just to protect it just to be sure just
[00:10:43] a double
[00:10:56] check no as as I go God he's thr the
[00:11:05] away how you be so
[00:11:13] Savage hey how's it going

[00:11:18] one we are just uh
[00:11:22] finishing pining out the rest of these
[00:11:24] cards from our break here earlier today
[00:11:28] like to just make sure that they're all
[00:11:30] shown that they're handed out to
[00:11:33] everyone we don't do on uh on the live
[00:11:35] stream in the morning the um Commons and
[00:11:38] uncommons we just kind
[00:11:40] of get them taken care of for the uh
[00:11:43] uncommons and over a little bit about
[00:11:45] certain amount and rares in the uh
[00:11:48] mythics because that's what everybody
[00:11:49] looks
[00:11:50] for Vault though we still need to hand
[00:11:52] out to everyone like I say we just do it
[00:11:54] a quicker way
[00:11:56] here how's your evening going
[00:12:08] not handing him
[00:12:11] out and there we
[00:12:16] go right
[00:12:20] now
[00:12:22] leave so you can ship them the bags are
[00:12:26] all packed you just need to get them
[00:12:27] ready and out for
[00:13:02] all

[00:23:02] believe I was upset I got a Nas because
[00:23:04] they don't make them
[00:23:05] anymore Skyrocket through the
[00:23:08] roof like this IP is one this and like
[00:23:11] uh probably Fallout are a couple of the
[00:23:12] IPS that they can never do anything
[00:23:14] where they can't like they can like
[00:23:15] never really
[00:23:17] ban
[00:23:18] it they might be able to
[00:23:21] ban cards that maybe make it
[00:23:24] stronger they won't ban it because it's
[00:23:27] part of the IP
[00:23:29] I think that's one of those things they
[00:23:30] get in trouble
[00:23:32] with either
[00:23:34] way get rid of this
[00:23:37] one all right in

**Application Server Java updates**

The steps below were performed on the Legal Files Application Servers to upgrade from OpenJDK jdk-13.0.2 to version jdk-20.0.1.

**Before beginning this work, save a copy of the existing Tomcat configuration files:**  
Specifically, `D:\Program Files\Apache Tomcat 9.0_1\conf\server.xml` & `D:\Program Files\Apache Tomcat 9.0_1\webapps\MyLegalFiles\WEB-INF\web.xml`.

### Install OpenJDK:
1. Use the version of OpenJDK provided by Legal Files, version jdk-20.0.1.
2. Copy the OpenJDK files to a location on the D: drive on the application servers. Here, the files have been placed in `D:\OpenJDK\jdk-13.0.2`. Leave version 13.0.2 in place.

### Set Environment Variables:
1. Open Command Prompt and check the installed version of Java using the command `java -version`.
2. Right-click **This PC** -> **Properties** -> **Advanced System Settings**.

   _*Description of the settings panel opening steps*_

3. Click on **Environment Variables**, select **Path** under the System Variables section, and click **Edit**.
4. Either edit the current Path or delete it and create a new Path to:
   `D:\OpenJDK\jdk-20.0.1\bin`.
5. Edit the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to `D:\OpenJDK\jdk-20.0.1`.
6. Open a new console and test the Java version.

### Application Servers:
1. Change the settings for each Tomcat instance:
   - Note: This should be performed as part of the Apache Tomcat 9.0.26 -> 9.0.82 upgrade.
   - Note: In PROD, 4 instances need updating. In TEST, only update the JVMs which have been upgraded to 12.2.
2. Run the Tomcat configuration program for each JVM (1 -> 4):
   `D:\Program Files\Apache Tomcat 9.0_1\bin\Tomcat9_1w.exe`.
3. Click on the **Java Tab**.

   _*Description of the Java Tab*_

4. Change the Java Virtual Machine from:
   `D:\OpenJDK\jdk-13.0.2\bin\server\jvm.dll`
   to:
   `D:\OpenJDK\jdk-20.0.1\bin\server\jvm.dll`.
5. Click **OK**.
6. Restart the Tomcat JVM via the services console.

### Open the modified JVM from your browser and smoke test:

### Application Server Java Updates

The following steps were performed on the Legal Files Application Servers to upgrade from OpenJDK jdk-13.0.2 to version jdk-20.0.1.

1. **Backup Existing Configuration Files**
   - Save a copy of the existing Tomcat configuration files:
     - `D:\Program Files\Apache Tomcat 9.0_1\conf\server.xml`
     - `D:\Program Files\Apache Tomcat 9.0_1\webapps\MyLegalFiles\WEB-INF\web.xml`

2. **Install OpenJDK**
   - Use the version of OpenJDK provided by Legal Files, version jdk-20.0.1.
   - Copy the OpenJDK files to a location on the D: drive on the Application Servers. Place the files in `D:\OpenJDK\jdk-20.0.1`. Leave the 13.0.2 version in place.

3. **Set Environment Variables**
   - Adjust the environment variables to use the new OpenJDK version from the Command Prompt.
     - Open Command Prompt and check the installed version of Java using the command `java -version`.

       **_[Screenshot of Command Prompt with java -version command]_**

     - Right-click `This PC` -> Properties -> Advanced System Settings.

       **_[Right-clicking on This PC and selecting Properties]_**

   - Change the settings for each Tomcat instance. Note: This should be performed as part of the Apache Tomcat 9.0.26 to 9.0.82 upgrade.
   - In PROD, update 4 instances. In TEST, only update the JVMs which have been upgraded to 12.2.
   - Run the Tomcat configuration program for each JVM (1-4):
     - `D:\Program Files\Apache Tomcat 9.0_1\bin\Tomcat9_1w.exe`
     - Click on the Java Tab.

       **_[Tomcat configuration program showing the Java tab]_**

     - Change the Java Virtual Machine from `D:\OpenJDK\jdk-13.0.2\bin\server\jvm.dll` to `D:\OpenJDK\jdk-20.0.1\bin\server\jvm.dll`.

       **_[Changing Java Virtual Machine path in the Tomcat configuration program]_**

     - Click OK.

5. **Restart Tomcat JVM**

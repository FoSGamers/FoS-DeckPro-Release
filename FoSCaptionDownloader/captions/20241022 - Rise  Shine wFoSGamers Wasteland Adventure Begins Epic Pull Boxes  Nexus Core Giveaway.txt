[00:14:24] there's a bloom burrow bundle left in
[00:14:26] there I have to double
[00:14:27] check I believe there's a blo bundle
[00:14:29] left in there I just got to double check
[00:14:31] on that one but congratulations my
[00:14:33] friend I guess we're opening some stuff
[00:14:35] right
[00:14:35] now right ripping it open now do you
[00:14:38] want the Box sent home to you or would
[00:14:39] you like me to um just uh instead of
[00:14:43] sending you the box just just the packs
[00:14:44] a lot of times people like the packs
[00:14:46] instead of the Box they don't need it um
[00:14:48] if you don't need it we'll we use them
[00:14:49] as you notice so if you are you want it
[00:14:51] to protect yourself too it's yours you
[00:14:53] got it so that's why I like to say some
[00:14:55] people like I don't need a box I got
[00:14:57] like 400 of them
[00:15:00] it's probably a little easier to just do
[00:15:01] the packs if you don't mind because it
[00:15:02] can I can package them up a little bit
[00:15:03] easier and ship them out because they're
[00:15:05] not like uh I don't have to worry about

[02:56:10] have to admit I think I seeing some of

[02:56:14] would be pretty
[02:56:17] cool cuz I have a handful of the rooms
[02:56:19] myself but I don't have a ton of them
[02:56:22] but I'm like every time I see them come

[03:15:04] K4 let me put that over there for you my
[03:15:11] friend why yours
[03:15:14] all why did you have two did you see two
[03:15:16] two of those pop up by the
[03:15:20] way did it pop up two things saying like
[03:15:24] right at one right after another because
[03:15:25] I want to make sure
[03:15:27] I'm on the screen all right maybe I'm
[03:15:29] wrong for
[03:15:31] you I saw two things pop up it was like
[03:15:33] your last one ran and then the first one
[03:15:35] and this one just ran at the same time
[03:15:37] yes it did okay give me one second here
[03:15:39] that was weird hold on give me a second
[03:15:43] here that was a little weird
[03:15:47] no not that
[03:15:54] one
[03:15:58] there oh that's that's weird all right
[03:16:04] well look like all right whatever I'll
[03:16:09] deal with it later I'll send it in as a
[03:16:10] glitch to whatnot but here we go looks
[03:16:12] like you got
[03:16:18] Wrath of the Skies it changed to Wrath
[03:16:20] of the skies for you for run when it
[03:16:22] randomized the other one it randomize
[03:16:25] that one at the same time the second one
[03:16:26] last one before it I don't know why but
[03:16:29] it looks like you got that which is
[03:16:31] really weird I had to double check it
[03:16:33] because I saw two things pop up so
[03:16:34] that's what you're getting instead of
[03:16:35] the other one which is gone
[03:16:38] now that was a weird glitch I have to
[03:16:41] talk to whatnot on that one sorry about
[03:16:43] that
[03:16:49] yeah nobody did anything or said
[03:16:52] anything yeah no I see you on both of
[03:16:55] them because there's a Wrath of the
[03:16:56] Skies earlier I'm just confused yeah I
[03:16:58] think it's just I think it doubled it I
[03:17:00] think for whatever it's it's a I'm in
[03:17:02] beta so you know it might have just been
[03:17:04] a glitch where I hit the button too many
[03:17:06] times and it ran it or something I don't
[03:17:08] know but anyways we'll try that again
[03:17:11] we'll see what we got
[03:17:13] here I think it benefited you though you
[03:17:15] ended up getting a Wrath of the Skies
[03:17:16] instead look
[03:17:21] that and our giveaway is going

[03:19:57] on that that would be pretty sweet as
[03:19:58] long as it's not a shitty boat falling

[03:21:06] sailing your boat
[03:21:08] right that' be a pretty good start I'd
[03:21:10] say but yeah yeah so we have a it's a
[03:21:12] lagoon 40 2017 Lagoon not Lagoon 200 17
[03:21:16] leopard 40 we were looking at the lagon
[03:21:18] 40s that's why leopard 40 we ended up
[03:21:20] getting which is actually a bit a bit
[03:21:22] nicer personally um we just got lucky on
[03:21:25] it being a charter boat that no one
[03:21:27] wanted and we were like we'll pay cash
[03:21:30] and they sold it to us for a lot less
[03:21:33] than they were trying to but we had cash
[03:21:35] and no one else could buy
[03:21:36] it stormchasers
[03:21:41] Talent so we got it supposedly we'll see
[03:21:44] how it goes as long as it's not a piece
[03:21:46] of crap which I don't think it's going
[03:21:47] to be based on everything I I understand
[03:21:50] about I've read a lot of people that
[03:21:52] have bought boats from I it's a it's a
[03:21:53] charter boat from Moorings cuz we had
[03:21:56] looked at buying some um personal boats
[03:21:59] and we saw all all kinds of personal
[03:22:01] boats and I'm going to tell you I'd
[03:22:03] rather get a charter boat because those
[03:22:04] personal boats some of those people I
[03:22:06] don't even think they know what a boat
[03:22:07] is stormchasers Talent number 75 I feel
[03:22:11] like those they're like um my wife calls
[03:22:12] them yachties versus boers and I'm like
[03:22:15] yeah that makes sense yeah that makes
[03:22:17] sense they're that's what they are
[03:22:18] they're the people that like they buy a
[03:22:19] yacht they think they're going to sail
[03:22:20] around on it or whatever and they they
[03:22:23] like burn Motors out because they don't
[03:22:25] realize you have to put oil change in
[03:22:26] them or you know stuff like
[03:22:29] that yeah we've had some good plls we've
[03:22:32] had some decent
[03:22:33] pulls we had a couple uh ones from here
[03:22:36] Overlord of boiler billes and just
[03:22:38] pulled out which was nice uh
[03:22:42] single yeah that's why my wife calls
[03:22:44] those people but and like we're like
[03:22:45] boers like I've been my family been on
[03:22:46] the ocean I I had my boat license at 14
[03:22:50] I was pulling people around on a tube
[03:22:52] when I was 12 in a boat like I know
[03:22:55] exactly what I'm doing like my mom used
[03:22:57] to sit because she was uncomfortable
[03:22:58] driving the boat so I used to be the one
[03:23:00] that was pulling
[03:23:04] around because as long as she was there
[03:23:06] I was allowed to do that repulsive is
[03:23:08] GNA try it white Orchard there we go oh
[03:23:11] white Orchard
[03:23:14] Phantom white Orchard Phantom
[03:23:17] wait that's just
[03:23:22] normal there's the other
[03:23:25] one oh that's this that's this one white

[03:25:18] of those we St that and say thank you
[03:25:21] for hanging
[03:25:29] out yeah I know driver exactly so all
[03:25:32] right put it this way we flew and I and
[03:25:34] like I'm happy that they ended up
[03:25:36] selling the boat underneath us we flew
[03:25:37] up to um
[03:25:40] um we flew to um my Maryland
[03:25:46] to go look at a boat and in middle in
[03:25:49] midair they ended up selling the boat to
[03:25:51] someone else I was like you got to be
[03:25:53] kidding me well luckily they were like
[03:25:56] oh you can go they have a contract with
[03:25:57] someone else or somebody else put an
[03:25:59] offer in they that means they most
[03:26:00] likely had a contract based on the
[03:26:01] conversation we have with the other guy
[03:26:04] and they uh they ended up selling for a
[03:26:07] lot less than we had offered and when we
[03:26:09] looked at it there was like a dent in
[03:26:10] the side of it that they didn't tell us
[03:26:12] about like a big dent like the whole
[03:26:13] side of the dock hit it at one point
[03:26:15] then one of them had then inside it
[03:26:17] there was like some parts of like the
[03:26:19] ceiling the roof was like the top was
[03:26:20] coming down not a hard fix but they
[03:26:22] didn't say anything about that um and
[03:26:24] like the the um the bimin top was just
[03:26:27] completely needed to be redone there's
[03:26:29] like it was destroyed there and like all
[03:26:31] of the um all the hatches had the uh the
[03:26:35] what is it called the cracking on them I
[03:26:37] can't remember what it is the the
[03:26:38] spiderg glass cracking I can't remember
[03:26:39] the name of it that was all over that so
[03:26:41] we had to replace all the hatches I'm
[03:26:43] like this is not what you like what did
[03:26:44] you tell me here this is insane
[03:26:47] all right here we go
[03:26:49] immigrant you got the insatiable avarest
[03:26:53] so like we flew up to see this thing and
[03:26:56] they ended up selling to somebody else
[03:26:57] and we were like it kind of ticked us
[03:26:59] off but at the same time I was happy
[03:27:02] because we didn't have to have to we
[03:27:04] didn't end up to dealing with that boat
[03:27:05] because that would have been a headache
[03:27:06] the only thing that was nice about it
[03:27:07] was it had New Motors and the reason why
[03:27:09] I had New Motors is I'm thinking those
[03:27:10] people burnt the motors out because they
[03:27:12] didn't put oil in them or something like
[03:27:13] that you know something stupid
[03:27:19] I'm uh
[03:27:23] an
[03:27:26] immigrant pretty sure in some way shape
[03:27:29] or form everybody in north in South
[03:27:32] America are immigrants if you really
[03:27:34] want to go back far enough right I mean
[03:27:36] if you go back they cross that land
[03:27:38] bridge so you know they've been here and
[03:27:41] then then that's how they all no one
[03:27:42] actually I don't think there's anybody
[03:27:43] actually there's no civilization that
[03:27:45] was like
[03:27:48] separately developed here without coming
[03:27:51] over the land
[03:27:54] bridge it was no I don't think it was
[03:27:56] anyways all right sorry I get
[03:27:58] sidetracked sometimes thank you for
[03:28:00] coming and hanging out though I
[03:28:01] appreciate it I you got something nice

[03:31:47] 64
[03:31:49] 692 thank you my friend Joey Joe
[03:31:53] 64692 all right we'll run another one of
[03:31:57] our giveaways here and then I think what
[03:31:58] we'll end up doing because around 10:30
[03:32:00] and this is generally around time I jump
[03:32:03] off but we'll see we'll run a couple
[03:32:06] more of these to see if anybody wants
[03:32:08] maybe to grab or try to grab the
[03:32:12] Ghostbusters secret layer and I think
[03:32:15] what I'm going to do in the process of
[03:32:17] that I think I'll do that tomorrow
[03:32:19] morning what's in the pole box you can
[03:32:22] see actually everything that's in there
[03:32:23] so it's all singles and then the big hit
[03:32:26] is the uh the secret layer Ghostbusters
[03:32:28] Slimer nonfoil
[03:32:31] Edition um the the whole the whole thing
[03:32:34] the whole like thing sealed sealed
[03:32:36] completely um or um it's a bunch of
[03:32:39] singles that are in there um all kinds
[03:32:41] of different singles that are in there
[03:32:42] there was 100 R so odd I think it was
[03:32:44] like 89 no 99 singles that were in there
[03:32:47] plus or no 98 singles that were in there
[03:32:49] plus the secret layer thing and that's
[03:32:52] what that is it's a bunch of singles or
[03:32:54] maybe get the secret layer yeah pretty
[03:32:57] much what it is if you're lucky enough
[03:32:58] you grab the secret layer if not you
[03:32:59] walk away with a single that's generally
[03:33:01] they're all rares or um over 50 cents of
[03:33:04] an uncommon or something like that if it
[03:33:06] will happen to be a low one but that's
[03:33:08] really what the lowest is I'd say when
[03:33:10] it comes to uncommon there is floors of
[03:33:11] some of the rares though are lower but
[03:33:12] when it comes to that that's really kind
[03:33:15] of well we get there and Nico coming
[03:33:17] back in for a minute before you head to
[03:33:19] work I'm guessing teachings of
[03:33:21] [Music]
[03:33:22] K Ken teachings of
[03:33:33] Kieran teachings
[03:33:38] of G
[03:33:41] Kieran not our foil one there thank you
[03:33:44] all right friend let me get that over
[03:33:47] here try run that a little bit more and
[03:33:50] I'll put that over there with
[03:33:54] Z our buddy
[03:33:58] nio our buddy
[03:34:01] Nico there you are my friend there you
[03:34:04] go not bad little pickup
[03:34:07] foil you are my friend all righty so
[03:34:11] yeah that's what the pull boxes are
[03:34:12] they're virtual ones you can literally
[03:34:13] go in there should be a break tab that
[03:34:15] allows you to go in and actually see all
[03:34:17] what they are if you're looking at
[03:34:20] things so that's that's kind of what the
[03:34:22] kind of fun thing is on that so for
[03:34:23] instance like this one there's some
[03:34:24] packs in here there's some singles and
[03:34:26] the big hit would be the uh the
[03:34:28] scavenger the Dorn commander deck that's
[03:34:31] the miracle workers and this all throw
[03:34:33] it on for there $4 you can get that hey
[03:34:36] psycho how's it going just off might to
[03:34:39] say hi I appreciate you coming and say
[03:34:41] hi always appreciate anybody to stop in
[03:34:43] and say hi and hang out with us even if
[03:34:45] it's a
[03:34:48] minute I do very much appreciate it
[03:34:50] thank
[03:34:51] you all right so this is what we're
[03:34:54] going to
[03:34:55] do this is what I'm going to do right
[03:34:58] now we had nobody I think tomorrow I'm
[03:35:02] going to have to add more of the uh
[03:35:05] cores in because for some
[03:35:10] reason none of the Nexus cores are found
[03:35:13] so I think I need to add more of them in
[03:35:14] so the Nexus Cor are like 5% discount
[03:35:17] and they're randomly added in to a break
[03:35:19] box so like some of them have random
[03:35:22] spots that say Nexus core at the end of
[03:35:25] it which will get you like a a you know
[03:35:28] a 5% discount on whatever you have here
[03:35:32] or it's going to get you like a um or if
[03:35:35] you want to save them up you can
[03:35:37] potentially save them up and build a a
[03:35:39] different type of giveaway for a buyer's
[03:35:40] giveaway if you want so like that's why
[03:35:43] we have it oh so it's in no one's pulled
[03:35:46] any of them I think I need to add more I
[03:35:48] think that's what I'm trying to get at I

[00:25:25] that
[00:25:28] for all our cards to be handed out here
[00:25:30] today all right here we go on to the
[00:25:33] next
[00:25:35] ones we'll see what
[00:25:38] happens all
[00:25:40] right this is all just one at a time
[00:25:44] because that's how they were ordered no
[00:25:47] one actually got two in a row this time
[00:25:48] so they're all like one at a time so
[00:25:51] there we go put that there that way I
[00:25:52] know which one's coming up next
[00:25:59] people wanted tokens and they wanted art
[00:26:01] cards so that's why they're in
[00:26:06] here you
[00:26:14] go today we pulled out a roaming Throne
[00:26:17] that was a nice
[00:26:20] pickup I think that was our big hit
[00:26:22] today was probably the roaming Throne
[00:26:24] didn't have any duwel Lotus like we did
[00:26:26] yesterday
[00:26:35] I have yet to get a jewel blows myself
[00:26:37] and I'm just like really thoroughly
[00:26:38] upset about that one because I pulled
[00:26:39] out like probably seven or eight of them
[00:26:42] for different people hey
[00:26:47] Mom and not one of them for myself I've
[00:26:50] got to the point I'm like I need to I
[00:26:51] should just probably just buy
[00:26:53] one luckily I'm able to open stuff and
[00:26:56] sell the ones I don't want so it kind of
[00:26:57] makes out for the Box boxes when I don't
[00:26:59] get the things I want and like you know
[00:27:01] like some of the people they can't get a
[00:27:02] chance to do that they just kind of open
[00:27:04] it and they either stick with the stuff
[00:27:05] or they they have to either sell them on
[00:27:08] sell them online themselves or they go
[00:27:09] to like their store and trade
[00:27:11] stuff I got know a bunch of people that
[00:27:13] say they get stuff here from here and
[00:27:15] they'll go to the store and trade for
[00:27:16] like things that they do
[00:27:18] want you
[00:27:21] know I do that makes sense mean that's
[00:27:24] what you do in the general generally
[00:27:26] anyways you get pack of cards you don't
[00:27:28] want them you trade with a
[00:27:29] friend at the store trade them into the
[00:27:33] store you know something like
[00:27:39] that all right this one was a nice quick
[00:27:43] one though we didn't have many packs in
[00:27:47] this a few but not a ton there was like
[00:27:50] 20 packs or something I think
[00:28:07] oh somebody's getting the command Tower
[00:28:09] there there they
[00:28:13] go I know a couple people like ooh
[00:28:15] command Tower because we only do it over
[00:28:17] $3 it has to be $3 or more for it to go
[00:28:20] in with all the commons and
[00:28:21] [Music]
[00:28:23] uncommons so since that one was not $3
[00:28:27] it had to stay
[00:28:28] of all the uncommons and uncommons
[00:28:30] because it is an it is a common
[00:28:40] card that's two we don't want to hand
[00:28:41] two to somebody
[00:28:58] I'm almost done here stff and I'll go
[00:29:00] take a
[00:29:05] shower finish up the
[00:29:22] night why he's moving some stuff around
[00:29:24] in the background in the bedroom we're
[00:29:26] staying with my mom until we get up all
[00:29:29] our stuff they can get the boat
[00:29:31] hopefully we have the boat so we put an
[00:29:32] offering again see what
[00:29:35] happens my
[00:29:37] bet is
[00:29:39] nothing just because I don't think luck
[00:29:41] is in our favor for anything and I
[00:29:44] suspect we're going to have to wait for
[00:29:45] the boats to crash even more for people
[00:29:47] to be like all right we'll sell it to
[00:29:48] somebody with cash for that price a lot
[00:29:52] of people what's happening is um they're
[00:29:54] using their feelings they're letting
[00:29:55] their feelings get in the way
[00:29:58] they keep dropping a boat prices keep
[00:30:00] dropping 30 to 70 to 80,000 every
[00:30:04] month and people are uh letting their
[00:30:08] feelings get in the way rather than
[00:30:09] getting rid of the boat because if they
[00:30:10] didn't there's already two of them We've
[00:30:12] Ended up walking away
[00:30:14] from because the looking at the price
[00:30:17] after like yeah we're not going to go
[00:30:18] that just drw too much now we don't even
[00:30:19] want to go anywhere look at that we're
[00:30:20] going to look at different ones instead
[00:30:21] now but if they had sold it earlier they
[00:30:24] would have had a sale
[00:30:25] already from it but people used their
[00:30:28] feelings too much when it comes to
[00:30:30] things that is not an item items do not
[00:30:33] have feelings Associated they are items
[00:30:35] for a
[00:30:36] reason you may have have experiences
[00:30:40] with memories around them but they do
[00:30:42] not generate a feeling I and if it does
[00:30:45] feel bad for
[00:30:50] you maybe the memories that you had on
[00:30:53] the item generate feelings but the item
[00:30:57] it itself does
[00:31:02] not unless it's feelings of anger
[00:31:04] because the thing never
[00:31:07] works I'll give you that one
[00:31:51] all right well then
[00:31:59] time to put them all on the sleeves so
[00:32:01] that I can get
[00:32:03] room into their
[00:32:10] backs
[00:32:12] then clean up the room some my you have
[00:32:15] a place to seep and not box all over the
[00:32:21] bed laugh at my
[00:32:24] uh my
[00:32:26] statement why I make factual statements
[00:32:29] that are
[00:32:30] humorous my wife says I'm funny because
[00:32:32] I say things all the time that are just
[00:32:34] factual but I guess I say him in a
[00:32:36] manner that is
[00:32:38] humorous I I just think I say it
[00:32:40] factually and I just give a little
[00:32:42] description so that people understand
[00:32:43] what I'm talking
[00:32:45] about and they can visualize it that's
[00:32:49] all help giving a little little help to
[00:32:52] people that's
[00:32:56] all for
[00:33:48] okay that's
[00:34:22] work you want to plug in the thing so we
[00:34:24] can watch some TV

[00:35:36] morning like getting uh our friends some
[00:35:39] things every now and
[00:35:40] again it's regular so we always like
[00:35:43] seeing a regular get
[00:35:48] something not that we don't like seeing
[00:35:50] new people get things it it's just every
[00:35:53] now and again when the regular gets
[00:35:54] something oh nice
[00:35:58] no you got to know what I'm talking
[00:36:00] about anybody in this honest with
[00:36:04] themselves here that's not ignorant

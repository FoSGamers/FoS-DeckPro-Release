The right-of-way for vessels passing through a drawbridge is generally determined by **U.S. Coast Guard regulations and local bridge tenders' instructions**. However, the common practice is as follows:

- **Vessels with the current (tidal flow advantage) usually have the right-of-way.**
- If there is no significant current, then the **northbound vessel (in the U.S.) typically has the right-of-way** over the southbound vessel.
- Local bridge regulations, maritime rules of the road, and specific navigational aids may override this general rule.

For a specific drawbridge, it is always best to **call the bridge tender on VHF Channel 9 or 13** and confirm who has the right-of-way before proceeding.

The height of your Leopard 40 (*Bigger Boat*) from the **waterline to the top of the mast** is **19.45 meters (63 feet 10 inches)**【27:0†Leopard 40 Manual.pdf】. If you have antennas, radar, or other equipment mounted on top, you'll need to factor those in for bridge clearance. Let me know if you need a more precise measurement with additional equipment included.

With electronics i have installed on it

[2025-02-27 07:35:21] ChatGPT:
With your installed electronics, the total height of *Bigger Boat* is approximately **20.5 to 21 meters (67 to 69 feet)** above the waterline. This includes:

- **Mast height**: **19.45 meters (63'10")**【31:2†Leopard 40 Manual.pdf】.
- **Radar and antennas**: Typically add **1 to 1.5 meters (3 to 5 feet)**, depending on your specific Raymarine equipment and mounting setup【31:1†Leopard 40 Manual.pdf】.

For safe clearance under bridges, I recommend using **a minimum air draft of 70 feet** to account for any variations due to sea state, rigging, and additional equipment. Let me know if you need more precise measurements based on specific mounting details.

Check with the 19.45 meter height for us going up the ICW if there are any bridges going to New Smyrna Beach that say they are 65 feet, but in actuality, based on actual people using it and going under them, they're lower.

Navigating the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) from Miami to New Smyrna Beach with your vessel's height of **19.45 meters (63 feet 10 inches)** requires careful attention to bridge clearances. Here's what you need to know:

**Key Fixed Bridges and Their Clearances:**

1. **Julia Tuttle Causeway (Mile 1087.1):**
   - **Vertical Clearance:** 56 feet (17.07 meters)
   - **Note:** This is the lowest fixed bridge on the ICW in Florida. With your mast height, you will **not** be able to pass under this bridge. citeturn0search3

2. **Other Fixed Bridges:**
   - **Vertical Clearance:** 65 feet (19.81 meters) above Mean High Water (MHW)
   - **Note:** While these clearances theoretically accommodate your vessel, real-world factors can affect actual clearance.

**Factors Affecting Bridge Clearances:**

- **Tidal Variations:** Clearances are measured at MHW. Tidal fluctuations can either increase or decrease actual clearance.
- **Water Levels:** Wind, rainfall, and waterway management practices can raise water levels, reducing clearance.
- **Bridge Construction or Maintenance:** Temporary equipment or platforms can reduce clearance.

**Reports of Discrepancies:**

Some mariners have reported that height boards on ICW fixed bridges south of Daytona Beach have been adjusted to show less clearance than in previous years. This suggests that actual clearances might be less than indicated. citeturn0search12

**Recommendations:**

- **Verify Clearance Boards:** Always check the clearance gauge boards posted on each bridge as you approach.
- **Consult Local Authorities:** Contact local bridge tenders or the U.S. Coast Guard for real-time information on bridge clearances.
- **Plan for Tidal Conditions:** Aim to pass under bridges during low tide to maximize clearance.
- **Stay Informed:** Regularly consult updated nautical charts and Local Notices to Mariners for any changes in bridge statuses.

Given the potential for reduced clearances and the proximity of your mast height to the standard bridge clearances, exercise caution and gather current local information before your voyage.

Navigating the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) from Miami to New Smyrna Beach with your vessel's air draft of **19.45 meters (63 feet 10 inches)** requires careful attention to bridge clearances. While fixed bridges along this route are generally charted with a vertical clearance of **65 feet (19.81 meters)** above Mean High Water (MHW), there have been reports of discrepancies between the listed and actual clearances.

**Reported Discrepancies:**

1. **ICW Fixed Bridges South of Daytona Beach:**
   - **Source:** ICW Cruisers Guide
   - **Date:** Approximately 10 years ago
   - **Details:** Many sailboat captains reported that the height boards on ICW fixed bridges south of Daytona Beach had been adjusted to show less clearance than in previous years. These changes could not be explained by higher water levels, as verified by data from the US Army Corps of Engineers water level gauges. Investigations suggested that the Florida Department of Transportation had caused maintenance contractors to reinstall the height boards to display lower clearances. Despite reporting this issue to the U.S. Coast Guard in Miami, the erroneous height boards remained in place as of November 2010. citeturn0search6

2. **Variations in Published Bridge Clearances:**
   - **Source:** The Hull Truth Boating Forum
   - **Date:** Approximately 4 years ago
   - **Details:** A user highlighted that numerous websites provide bridge clearance information for the Florida ICW, most using MHW as the tide standard. However, discrepancies exist, with different sources quoting varying clearance numbers. citeturn0search2

3. **Clearances Below 65 Feet:**
   - **Source:** Cruisers & Sailing Forums
   - **Date:** Approximately 4 years ago
   - **Details:** A forum member noted encountering bridges with clearances as low as 63.5 feet. They advised against navigating the ICW with an air draft above 63 feet unless one is prepared to wait for low tides. citeturn0search0

**Recommendations:**

- **Verify Clearance Boards:** Always check the clearance gauge boards posted on each bridge as you approach.
- **Consult Local Authorities:** Contact local bridge tenders or the U.S. Coast Guard for real-time information on bridge clearances.

Check the Ernest Linus Bridge.

[2025-02-27 07:39:14] ChatGPT:
The **Ernest Lyons Bridge**, located in Stuart, Florida, carries State Road A1A over the Indian River Intracoastal Waterway. It is officially charted with a vertical clearance of **65 feet (19.81 meters)** above Mean High Water (MHW). citeturn0search1

However, there have been reports from mariners indicating potential discrepancies in the actual clearance:

- **Cruisers & Sailing Forums (November 10, 2019):** A user expressed concern about the Ernest Lyons Bridge, noting, "The one really concerning me is the Ernest Lyons Bridge because of these reviews. Height board possibly off by 8-10 inches." citeturn0search5

Given your vessel's air draft of **19.45 meters (63 feet 10 inches)**, it's crucial to approach this bridge with caution. Here are some recommendations:

- **Verify Clearance Boards:** As you approach the bridge, carefully observe the clearance gauge boards to assess the current actual clearance.

- **Consult Local Authorities:** Contact the local bridge tender or the U.S. Coast Guard for real-time information on bridge clearances and any known discrepancies.

- **Plan for Tidal Conditions:** Aim to transit under the bridge during low tide to maximize clearance.

- **Stay Informed:** Regularly consult updated nautical charts and Local Notices to Mariners for any changes in bridge statuses or reported discrepancies.

By taking these precautions, you can help ensure a safe passage under the Ernest Lyons Bridge.

What is our mast hight with weather vaine

[2025-02-27 08:15:22] ChatGPT:
With the weather vane installed, the total height of your Leopard 40 (*Bigger Boat*) from the **waterline to the top of the mast** is approximately **20.0 to 20.5 meters (65.6 to 67.3 feet)**.

This calculation includes:
- **Mast height**: **19.45 meters (63 feet 10 inches)**【47:0†Leopard 40 Manual.pdf】.
- **Weather vane & instruments**: Typically add **0.5 to 1.0 meters (1.6 to 3.3 feet)** depending on the model and mounting setup.

For bridge clearance planning, it’s safest to assume **a minimum air draft of 68-70 feet** to account for tide variations and additional mounted equipment. Let me know if you need a more precise measurement based on your specific weather vane model.

[00:21:34] a break the uh when you can click on
[00:21:37] them and see what they are in there um
[00:21:39] but the way that it's set up is they as
[00:21:41] as soon as it runs it randomizes the
[00:21:43] spot when the spot gets randomized it
[00:21:44] tells you exactly what you get which is
[00:21:46] the card and even what the prices so for
[00:21:49] instance on this one and there there are
[00:21:52] two cards in there from Marvel which are
[00:21:56] storms will and ice storm
[00:21:59] and I'm going to keep couple two cards
[00:22:00] in there from Marvel so say one of these
[00:22:01] gets pulled I'm going to add something

[00:22:04] there right now and all the other ones
[00:22:06] are ones just from rares that are or
[00:22:08] uncommons that are of value they're all

[00:22:13] mythics so You' go I want to try that
[00:22:15] for $2 try to get one of those and
[00:22:18] that's what would happen try to go after
[00:22:20] it and then it would spin kind of like a
[00:22:22] wheel almost and you see exactly what
[00:22:23] you
[00:22:24] get and then I am going to do this here
[00:22:29] and I'm going oh well look at that it

[00:23:20] phone up next to me I can just make him
[00:23:21] run wonder if that'll
[00:23:24] work that might work

[00:23:31] work wonder if I can do
[00:23:36] that that might
[00:23:37] work so Highlander you tried that one so

[00:41:32] when he's in trouble when he's not being

[00:41:41] got in trouble a couple times recently
[00:41:42] being mean to his younger brother for
[00:41:44] for farting on

[02:14:53] blood orange that was a long name there
[02:14:58] there you go and Griff you got a
[02:15:01] desecrate
[02:15:03] reality a desecrate reality let's get
[02:15:05] that one out for
[02:15:19] you hm
[02:15:23] if that doesn't happen he be here that
[02:15:25] means you're going to get another chance
[02:15:26] here but I don't see why Des crate
[02:15:28] reality is not in here because I swear I
[02:15:30] had it oh is it in one of these ones
[02:15:33] some of the new ones that I had out the
[02:15:35] other day and I have not put them in yet
[02:15:36] give me one
[02:15:40] second might be over here in the
[02:15:42] unorganized ones because I did open a
[02:15:43] pack of Commander Masters and
[02:15:49] those there's one of them in there is a
[02:15:51] one pack with some of them mixed in
[02:15:53] there and I can't remember if I open
[02:15:54] that one but I know I scanned them in so
[02:15:56] I mean I need to get these all organized
[02:15:58] make it better for myself that's today's
[02:16:00] job
[02:16:02] though and if it is not there you get
[02:16:04] another run because that means I
[02:16:07] have the card in there incorrectly and
[02:16:10] it should not be there so that's what it
[02:16:12] blows down to and you get another chance
[02:16:15] at the um
[02:16:21] cards
[02:16:22] there get another spin or try the try of
[02:16:25] the option no no desecrate dang it I was
[02:16:28] wrong I all right you get another try
[02:16:30] there and uh here we go randomize that

[02:45:58] the foil version for some
[02:46:00] reason so I'm going to give you an
[02:46:02] option of the which one of these three
[02:46:04] do you
[02:46:05] want this one right here all right there
[02:46:07] you
[02:46:09] go now I made a mistake there it looks
[02:46:11] like I'm going to have to go and correct
[02:46:14] that but whenever you guys make a
[02:46:16] mistake you guys get generally make out
[02:46:18] on that just because it's I feel bad I
[02:46:20] want to give you an option bet something
[02:46:21] better but now I got to pull that
[02:46:23] Mariana vendel out of
[02:46:25] everything how's everybody doing today
[02:46:28] you're doing well mem you've been U I
[02:46:30] know you hopefully you're doing
[02:46:35] better no that well that's not bad if
[02:46:38] it's a little low right
[02:46:53] that one's going to be
[02:46:55] removed that one's going to be removed
[02:46:59] also all
[02:47:02] right there we go my bad on that
[02:47:05] one but you made out with that
[02:47:11] MP m p t r i t o
[02:47:17] n and there we go
[02:47:19] kind
[02:47:21] corrupted let's get to that I'm going to
[02:47:23] open H we'll do another pack deal let's
[02:47:24] see do this that one felt
[02:47:33] good that one felt good we're going to
[02:47:35] do one of those
[02:47:37] two didn't fit where I needed them to go
[02:47:40] we're going to see which one of these
[02:47:41] ones feels good out of it
[02:47:52] that one all right all right there you
[02:47:55] go going to do these
[02:47:59] three
[02:48:15] okay look at that I don't even have them
[02:48:17] in here
[02:48:19] why are they even in here well that
[02:48:22] doesn't help when things aren't in there
[02:48:23] no wonder why can't people can't buy
[02:48:28] things I'm gonna have to make sure those
[02:48:29] go back in there
[02:48:31] now let me do this
[02:48:40] quickly thought that was in there but I
[02:48:42] guess not
[02:48:55] there we go I don't know why those
[02:48:56] aren't in
[02:48:59] there that's frustrating no wonder why
[02:49:01] no one's been looking at
[02:49:04] them no one can find them if they're not
[02:49:07] there dang it I'm going to double check
[02:49:09] my show stuff
[02:49:13] soon let's see there we
[02:49:16] are we're going to run this one one more
[02:49:18] time and I'm going to get you kind
[02:49:20] out I wonder why no one's been able to
[02:49:23] find those that's
[02:49:29] frustrating wonder why some things
[02:49:31] aren't selling well there's your reason
[02:49:35] why Cayenne corrupted
[02:49:40] memory C go looks like that one I'm just
[02:49:44] on a roll today right now
[02:49:51] let's see is it in the
[02:49:53] others it's not going to be in the
[02:49:55] others right now so we're going to have
[02:49:56] to pull that one out I can't speak for
[02:49:59] him I think I'm gonna have to oh yeah
[02:50:01] I'm gonna be organizing stuff tonight
[02:50:02] because that one's missing and you get
[02:50:03] another chance
[02:50:06] Highland anguished unmaking well that
[02:50:08] was a better pick up there on that
[02:50:10] one but I have to remove the
[02:50:13] others remove that other one there
[02:50:22] I swear I have I swear I had that
[02:50:24] corrupted memory around but maybe I did
[02:50:26] something with it I don't know I don't
[02:50:30] remember I don't
[02:50:32] know then you got
[02:50:35] anguish on
[02:50:39] making
[02:50:42] instead anguish done making right there
[02:50:45] number 35 that's a good pickup for you
[02:50:47] on that one that a a better better pack
[02:50:49] better card there it's always nice when

[02:51:06] that is definitely frustrating that
[02:51:08] that's not in like that but we'll take
[02:51:09] care of it later do that
[02:51:14] later we're going to do this

[03:02:20] fixing some puzzles all right nice
[03:02:22] command Tower o let's find that command
[03:02:39] Tower man Tower
[03:02:48] oh is it one of the ones that we didn't
[03:02:49] do
[03:02:51] yet ah I know what one that is I put
[03:02:53] that off to side with the others let me
[03:02:55] get the over
[03:02:58] here command Tower that's a nice command
[03:03:00] tower that is if I remember
[03:03:04] right this one over
[03:03:15] here get it here for a sec take me a
[03:03:18] minute to find it because things move
[03:03:25] around I didn't have it in the right
[03:03:27] spot because that was one of the ones
[03:03:28] that we opened up
[03:03:33] recently so I got to put it with all my
[03:03:36] others over here and I need to go
[03:03:37] through them all today because this is
[03:03:41] now getting
[03:03:43] frustrating now it's getting frustrating
[03:03:45] how many times I've had to go search
[03:03:47] through these
[03:03:53] yes it is getting frustrating now all
[03:03:54] right here we go
[03:04:13] is because I have a bunch of unorganized
[03:04:16] ones right over here and that's what I
[03:04:17] need to go through that's going to annoy
[03:04:19] me all
[03:04:24] right oh there's Henry that's the where
[03:04:27] I was looking for the other
[03:04:29] day thought I didn't have them I knew I
[03:04:32] had it somewhere and it was in one of
[03:04:33] the ones that's unorganized and there's
[03:04:34] the Toby from
[03:04:36] earlier there's the next oh there's the
[03:04:38] other one I thought I had those all
[03:04:40] somewhere and I couldn't find them
[03:04:41] that's why it's because they're not
[03:04:43] organized what happens when you don't
[03:04:44] have the things organized you misplace
[03:04:46] things you lose
[03:04:56] things all right that's probably where a
[03:04:58] bunch of the ones I've been missing is
[03:05:00] by the way
[03:05:01] too yes put money on that
[03:05:06] one yep oh yes that's exactly where all
[03:05:10] the ones I've been missing are I'm
[03:05:11] looking at him right
[03:05:13] now son of a well here's your
[03:05:15] command Tower by the way
[03:05:18] found all my cards that I've been
[03:05:19] missing for a while and I've been like I
[03:05:20] don't know where that is well it's
[03:05:22] because it's been hidden in the wrong
[03:05:24] box that you have not been looking
[03:05:28] in oh no well there we go I found those
[03:05:32] ones at
[03:05:33] least so that means I got to that's
[03:05:36] where all those other ones had been
[03:05:39] that's why I've been missing some CU
[03:05:41] they're not all
[03:05:46] there and I have those are all the ones
[03:05:49] I've been missing son of
[03:05:56] a yeah that's it those are all the ones
[03:05:59] I've been
[03:06:00] missing I wonder why I can't find
[03:06:04] those because they're all over in the
[03:06:06] wrong
[03:06:08] location that
[03:06:10] stinks I got really sidetracked there

[03:19:09] card over here
[03:19:17] I do have that card right
[03:19:20] here it's the uh convention Maro m a
[03:19:25] o I don't know maybe it's like something
[03:19:27] with one of the words is a

[03:20:05] inappropriate card
[03:20:08] name I don't

[00:00:06] packs all right here we go hey sorry
[00:00:09] about
[00:00:13] that hi there
[00:00:16] all I think we're in here good let me uh
[00:00:20] I got to make sure I plug in here so I
[00:00:21] don't

[00:00:31] little clock out here let me fix
[00:00:35] that there we go I don't like that I
[00:00:37] don't like being crooked
[00:00:41] crooked as some say let me actually put
[00:00:44] this over
[00:00:45] here I think if I do that and I do
[00:00:49] this that way you can still
[00:00:51] see everything there but I kind of block
[00:00:54] out my
[00:00:56] hand and that'll give me the ability to
[00:00:59] make this a little bit
[00:01:02] bigger and make it so you can see what's
[00:01:05] available right there maybe that's uh
[00:01:06] something that you guys would like to
[00:01:07] see there I do it like
[00:01:09] that see how that looks I think that
[00:01:11] looks pretty good not
[00:01:13] bad that way you know what's
[00:01:20] available we put that away there okay
[00:01:24] we'll run this for why not we'll run
[00:01:26] that for a little while here because we
[00:01:27] don't have too many people in hanging
[00:01:28] out it's just me by myself
[00:01:30] in the morning generally it is me by
[00:01:32] myself in the morning got me T it my
[00:01:36] wife's in there got
[00:01:40] me all right let me uh there's my drink
[00:01:42] over there we're started up we've got
[00:01:45] our
[00:01:46] characters let's see oh there we go our
[00:01:48] animations are
[00:01:51] working
[00:01:56] wonderful perfect we got our animations
[00:01:59] working there
[00:02:00] we like that what do do you
[00:02:04] do same thing um but with
[00:02:13] this
[00:02:15] those you put
[00:02:17] it around both sides
[00:02:20] yeah you want the tape to hold them
[00:02:23] together I use that to hold them on but
[00:02:25] I don't want to takee anything yet I
[00:02:27] want to youm yeah yeah yeah
[00:02:31] all right all right all right all right
[00:02:32] let's see what's going on
[00:02:36] here I think we're going to open should
[00:02:39] we open one of the other collector B uh
[00:02:40] Commander Decks that we have yeah so we
[00:02:43] can get ready to play them later
[00:02:45] maybe all right which one do we want to
[00:02:47] open well what are the names of them
[00:02:49] there's mutant Menace there's Scrappy
[00:02:53] Survivor and hail
[00:02:58] Caesar
[00:03:00] mutants we're g we're going to go into
[00:03:02] our mutant box
[00:03:04] here so we uh we got these for the
[00:03:07] family we figure we're gonna open them
[00:03:08] up and uh take a look at them and sleeve
[00:03:11] them up now I think we're gonna have to
[00:03:13] do
[00:03:14] probably probably want to do black for
[00:03:17] this
[00:03:19] one and then I'm guessing green for
[00:03:21] Survivor and then red for red or white
[00:03:25] for Caesar no I think it should be red
[00:03:28] for Caesar
[00:03:31] red for Caesar all right and then yeah
[00:03:33] so red for Caesar the bad guy green for
[00:03:34] the scrappy
[00:03:36] Survivor oh but what the then what's the
[00:03:39] color the scrappy survivors going to be
[00:03:41] white bright and light um all right
[00:03:44] let's see what white what look white
[00:03:45] looks like
[00:03:47] here
[00:03:50] check maybe white will work for those
[00:03:52] ones no not a bad
[00:03:58] thought okay
[00:04:01] I'll let me just put a card in here that
[00:04:04] I have hang out
[00:04:08] [Music]
[00:04:15] now okay white could work I
[00:04:18] guess you know I think white could work
[00:04:20] for this grappy survivors I have
[00:04:24] black well why don't youen well I think
[00:04:27] white would be no I think White's going
[00:04:28] to be fine for the um survivors or do
[00:04:30] red for the Survivor and do black for
[00:04:33] Caesar no no no no I your all process is
[00:04:36] fine I was just checking to make sure it
[00:04:37] was I liked how it was going to be
[00:04:44] okay I thought it was a good idea but I
[00:04:46] just wanted to make sure it looked
[00:04:49] uh what I wanted to the white I haven't
[00:04:52] looked at the white yet I got them
[00:04:54] recently and I hadn't had a chance to

[00:15:25] I like those
[00:15:26] ones yeah my father-in-law's
[00:15:28] manufacturing years ago then he did he
[00:15:30] what he worked at the state he worked at
[00:15:32] the state doing manufacturing stuff no
[00:15:34] he worked before the state doing
[00:15:35] Manufacturing in the mid doing the the
[00:15:37] manufacturing the steel thing up in New
[00:15:40] Hampshire and then he went got his then
[00:15:42] he told me to got his associates and
[00:15:44] went then he told me he got his
[00:15:45] associates and then he worked in the
[00:15:46] state yeah the state paid for it yeah
[00:15:48] the state paid for the associates
[00:15:51] yeah glowing one death touch then heway
[00:15:55] came the [ __ ] man uh shitman whatever
[00:15:57] what the the what do you call it the
[00:15:58] [ __ ] what he call
[00:16:00] himself the [ __ ] plant something about
[00:16:03] the [ __ ] man something there was
[00:16:04] something specifically [ __ ] in there CU
[00:16:08] he did the poop plant you know the you
[00:16:10] know the man you know goes and grinds up
[00:16:11] all the poop and makes sure it goes
[00:16:13] through everywhere and you know Waste
[00:16:14] Management that's what I was looking
[00:16:16] for he was he was uh like one of the
[00:16:18] managers there down with the plant he
[00:16:20] had every now and again gra jump down to
[00:16:22] the hole and grind stuff up again and
[00:16:24] climb through pipes I guess well anyways
[00:16:27] I work in it now my father was a
[00:16:29] fisherman before that though we he had
[00:16:30] his own fishing boat
[00:16:33] so all right ghoul counter oh I like the
[00:16:36] ghoul glowing
[00:16:40] one yeah but we uh we do all kinds of
[00:16:42] different things here my wife was nurse
[00:16:44] I do it stuff or is the nurse I do it
[00:16:47] stuff myself now but we'll see uh how
[00:16:51] World works in the future though right
[00:16:53] lumbering megal
[00:16:57] Sloss
[00:16:59] anything with poop is always a great day
[00:17:01] you know what Josh my my wife the nurse
[00:17:04] will definitely give you uh let you know
[00:17:05] that it's accurate because um anytime
[00:17:08] that we have nurses around and a
[00:17:10] conversation occurs it always divulges
[00:17:12] to a conversation about poop
[00:17:15] yep always over dinner and it always
[00:17:18] yeah always over dinner
[00:17:19] [Laughter]
[00:17:23] too this bell cost one less reach all
[00:17:26] right it's really funny actually not bad
[00:17:30] all right we put that back here now just
[00:17:31] um our adventure game just if you want
[00:17:33] to check it out it's in the frequently
[00:17:34] asked questions it explains how how it
[00:17:37] works here but I just put up extra
[00:17:38] things here because it gets you extra
[00:17:40] strength on the adventure game as you
[00:17:41] wander through the Wasteland you can
[00:17:43] always buy one of the Fall packs by
[00:17:45] itself if you want one of them but the
[00:17:46] adventure game the way it does is you
[00:17:48] know you play one of the characters here
[00:17:49] I have it fully animated you get through
[00:17:51] so much you get to go through the entire
[00:17:53] thing there's like
[00:17:55] only the last of one of them and this is
[00:17:58] like one step that is not completed out
[00:18:01] of like
[00:18:03] 12 and it was just because some
[00:18:04] headaches that occurred that I wasn't
[00:18:06] had a chance to complete them but
[00:18:07] anyways you get to play a game maybe get
[00:18:09] yourself a free pack of cards now the
[00:18:11] way you can do that is if you beat the
[00:18:13] boss at the end of your Wasteland
[00:18:15] Adventure you get a pick of one of these
[00:18:17] maybe it's a a play booster maybe it's a
[00:18:21] mystery booster maybe it's a homelands
[00:18:24] maybe it's a modern Horizon 1 maybe it's
[00:18:26] an AFR set I don't know it's one of
[00:18:29] those that are in there and then if you
[00:18:30] get beat by the boss though you end up
[00:18:32] having to go back to the Vault and you
[00:18:33] get a little pack of retro cards from
[00:18:37] 1994 I believe it is there 3D though
[00:18:40] they're pretty cool there but anyways
[00:18:42] either boys down you always get your
[00:18:43] packs but you could potentially win
[00:18:44] something extra and either way you
[00:18:46] always get something extra it's just
[00:18:47] whether it's the uh Magic pack or the
[00:18:50] the Retro pack is what it
[00:18:52] is so we just yeah that's what we do
[00:18:54] here we hang
[00:18:56] out our kids like to play games games

[00:19:30] anything yourself you can pick it all
[00:19:32] right there and that's your
[00:19:34] strength yeah I've been uh I've been
[00:19:35] doing I did the overnight thing for a
[00:19:37] while I used to manage um stock stuff
[00:19:40] related stock train traffic related

[00:19:45] sometimes the US NASDAQ stuff if it was
[00:19:47] late night but uh one of the companies
[00:19:49] that I work for but that became very
[00:19:51] just not my type of thing DS cards you
[00:19:54] half the x-r cars are Ed up contaminated
[00:19:57] drink all right
[00:19:59] but uh and so I've done that overnight
[00:20:03] but I'm back to it during the day
[00:20:06] now oh nice little
[00:20:09] Ward rad counters for everyone though on
[00:20:12] these
[00:20:13] ones what do you think uh have you ever
[00:20:16] you a Fallout fan yourself
[00:20:18] Josh I know I like I said I've been um I
[00:20:21] don't know if you heard me earlier but
[00:20:22] I've been a fan of Fallout since uh
[00:20:24] literally the first one came out when I
[00:20:25] was at I think I was in Middle School I
[00:20:27] think when it came
[00:20:29] out all troubleshooter because I
[00:20:32] actually uh remembered going wait in
[00:20:34] line for it my mom got mad because I was
[00:20:36] out too
[00:20:39] late I went with a few friends and their
[00:20:42] parents but I that bad once during your
[00:20:45] turn cast on graveyard that's actually
[00:20:47] not
[00:20:53] bad young death claw oh that's
[00:20:55] interesting here we go young death claw
[00:20:57] lizard mutant Menace each creature in
[00:20:59] your graveyard has scavage the scavenges
[00:21:01] cost equal to the monoca Exile creature
[00:21:03] from your graveyard and put a monoc
[00:21:05] cost hat it's mon cost put a number of
[00:21:07] one one coun is equal to that card's
[00:21:09] power on target creatures scavenge only
[00:21:11] has oh that's cool I like that scavenge
[00:21:14] one is that an old mechanic I don't know
[00:21:16] I thought that maybe I think that's a
[00:21:17] new mechanic actually I can't remember
[00:21:20] actually somebody maybe can help me he
[00:21:21] on that one I remember that one strength
[00:21:23] bobblehead oh I have bobbleheads Look at
[00:21:25] My Bobblehead over there you guys didn't
[00:21:27] see it earlier but showed it off
[00:21:29] earlier
[00:21:31] really ah yeah yeah I I kind of I played
[00:21:34] video games I haven't played for a long
[00:21:36] time I think the last video game we
[00:21:38] played was probably Fallout 76 and I
[00:21:40] haven't even played that for like three
[00:21:43] years little strength bobblehead all
[00:21:47] right yeah but I do like the um but I do
[00:21:51] like my kids like to play the play a lot
[00:21:52] of magic now and other card games we do
[00:21:54] like we play lurana
[00:21:57] too
[00:22:00] oh nice yeah uh I haven't actually
[00:22:04] played valhall but I played the
[00:22:05] Assassin's Creed for a years before but
[00:22:07] I
[00:22:09] H yeah I know I did see that I saw the
[00:22:11] Assassin's Creed one and there they're
[00:22:13] doing some collabs with a bunch of them
[00:22:14] which is kind of cool I just hope they
[00:22:16] do um I hope they do a little bit better
[00:22:18] job on the collabs and they make
[00:22:19] different decks because one of the
[00:22:21] things I've noticed is I had I'm a
[00:22:22] doctor who fan so I got the Doctor Who
[00:22:24] decks and the Doctor Who and the Fallout
[00:22:27] decks are EXE ex similar is all I'm
[00:22:29] going to say so I hope they make them um
[00:22:31] a little bit more original to what they
[00:22:33] are for their movies and TV shows and
[00:22:36] games and stuff now but I mean I can see
[00:22:38] how they use some of the other stuff and
[00:22:39] try to re reuse it but at the same time
[00:22:41] too much reusing makes it not as
[00:22:43] original as it could be you know but I
[00:22:45] think this is pretty cool though they
[00:22:46] get all the all the art and everything
[00:22:48] I'm like looking at this oh look it's
[00:22:50] dog well it's one of the mutants from on
[00:22:52] the game he was the nice
[00:22:56] mutant he was actually I think if I
[00:22:58] remember right he did actually grow
[00:22:59] things he had a
[00:23:02] garden
[00:23:04] what I watch laughing at me I'm laugh
[00:23:07] you just laughing at the whole like
[00:23:10] listening that a dog would have his own
[00:23:12] garden and he grow own Gard like just
[00:23:14] think that concept the dog is the name
[00:23:16] of the mutant I I know but for somebody
[00:23:18] that doesn't know and listening like
[00:23:21] that it's kind of funny I at my
[00:23:24] dog's Source library of plains Island
[00:23:27] Swamp well I you know who knows maybe he
[00:23:29] was mutated well honestly he's very
[00:23:31] smart smart I know sometimes he is a
[00:23:33] little smarter than you think he is
[00:23:35] every now and again he comes out he's
[00:23:36] like wait a minute you act stupid and
[00:23:37] then you can do
[00:23:39] that I don't know do you have it how do
[00:23:41] you how do you rip your um bicep though
[00:23:43] I've got myself my my fair share of
[00:23:45] injuries so I like understand I like
[00:23:47] seeing how people get just not to be
[00:23:49] mean or anything but I like seeing them
[00:23:51] hearing what happens to cause someone's
[00:23:54] problems because I've um I myself have
[00:23:58] uh I've e I've broken collar bones I've
[00:24:03] um uh
[00:24:05] wrists hands
[00:24:11] jaw hit by a car and a
[00:24:15] motorcycle so I've had my own fair share
[00:24:17] injuries oh work well hey does work pay
[00:24:19] for your uh your your recovery stuff
[00:24:21] then at
[00:24:26] least how hot is it outside um it was
[00:24:30] pretty warm it wasn't extremely warm but
[00:24:32] it wasn't like freezing if that makes
[00:24:34] any
[00:24:36] [Music]
[00:24:37] sense change our oh wow wow that sucks I
[00:24:42] had I ripped I ripped Peck muscle in
[00:24:44] high school when they I was a wrestling
[00:24:45] team and somebody pulled my arm wrong
[00:24:47] and it popped and I ended up having like
[00:24:48] this little ball right here until they
[00:24:49] did surgery 95% better nice yeah those
[00:24:52] was one take time like my arm it took me
[00:24:54] years before I got better I actually had
[00:24:55] end up having nerve damage and it took
[00:24:58] like two years for the nerves to go back
[00:24:59] so that I can actually lift my arm I
[00:25:01] used to as soon as I did this my fingers
[00:25:03] would go numb in my hand and as soon as
[00:25:05] I did this my whole arm would start
[00:25:07] going
[00:25:08] numb dude I've definitely been beat up
[00:25:11] yeah I
[00:25:14] know hey Rick thanks how you doing for
[00:25:17] coming in hanging out Ricky we just uh
[00:25:20] kind of looking through our Our Deck
[00:25:21] here and talking a little bit but yeah
[00:25:23] dude I've I've been beat up
[00:25:25] um trying to think of the I can go
[00:25:28] through a lot of injuries I mean I did I
[00:25:30] had a dirt bike I wrestled I um I used a
[00:25:34] mountain bike I snowboarded so I did a
[00:25:37] lot of like like dangerous things but
[00:25:39] they were they I had fun it's just the
[00:25:42] whole right side of my body is injured
[00:25:43] so I'm always in pain on the right side
[00:25:45] of my body half to day half to
[00:25:48] day how's your D going day going Ricky
[00:25:50] or I hope I'm saying your name
[00:25:52] right know we're just going through our
[00:25:54] deck here harmonize all D draw three
[00:25:56] cards not too bad
[00:26:01] this is the mutant one my wife thought
[00:26:03] it would deserve the color
[00:26:05] green draw a card you control with one
[00:26:08] one counter on it those creatures gain
[00:26:10] indestructible until turn and if you
[00:26:11] want you can come and play the uh the
[00:26:13] adventure game here you can get yourself
[00:26:14] a free pack of cards potentially um if
[00:26:17] you go through the adventure game here
[00:26:19] you get these two this will start you
[00:26:20] out with one and a half strength but
[00:26:22] what happens is you get to wander
[00:26:23] through the Wasteland you pull from each
[00:26:25] one of these boxes as you wander through
[00:26:27] but it is an animated Adventure through
[00:26:29] the Wasteland depending on the character
[00:26:30] you pick and then um at the end you
[00:26:33] fight a boss and that boss is one of
[00:26:37] these 10 cards here and then what
[00:26:40] happens is depending on if you can beat
[00:26:41] the boss you get one of these you get a
[00:26:44] chance of getting a free pack of cards
[00:26:46] which could be like a play booster maybe
[00:26:48] homelands maybe it's an AFR set maybe
[00:26:52] it's an EMA booster we're not sure it's
[00:26:53] whatever you get there but if you get
[00:26:54] beat by the boss though you have to
[00:26:56] stumble back to the vault there is a
[00:26:58] pack of cards from 1994 in here a little
[00:27:01] retro pack that you get also you always
[00:27:03] get something it's just whether it's uh
[00:27:05] you get the big the big win because you
[00:27:07] uh beat the boss at the end and they drw
[00:27:08] loot where if you get beaten by the boss
[00:27:11] and you have to stumble back to the
[00:27:12] Vault injured and find something in a in
[00:27:16] a safe that you find in the ball it's up
[00:27:19] to you rampant growth not bad search Li
[00:27:21] we like the rampant
[00:27:24] growths what was that it's 95 near our
[00:27:27] house
[00:27:28] a semi the all the wood went right
[00:27:31] through the whole cabin of what Happ
[00:27:33] what happened it would it go off the
[00:27:35] road y oh all right guys so here here's
[00:27:37] a um I'm just gonna give you some um
[00:27:40] science lesson right here all right a
[00:27:42] little science lesson for you all this
[00:27:44] is what is moment called
[00:27:47] momentum that's the back end this is a
[00:27:50] truck that decided um It Whatever
[00:27:53] Happened whatever reason it went off the
[00:27:54] road those are the 2x4s on on said
[00:27:59] truck now momentum most of them fall off
[00:28:02] the truck during the
[00:28:05] accident but some of them do not fall
[00:28:08] off the truck they keep going straight
[00:28:11] because of their momentum that's the
[00:28:13] next one's even worse so hopefully this
[00:28:16] gentleman looks like he lived the way it
[00:28:17] went through when his seat pushed him
[00:28:18] underneath it
[00:28:20] but yes that is momentum gentlemen and
[00:28:24] ladies that is why we say even if you're
[00:28:27] going 60 miles an hour if you are Towing
[00:28:30] something and you have to hit that
[00:28:31] brakes there's a good chance momentum is
[00:28:34] not going to stop what you're
[00:28:36] towing I I
[00:28:39] tow I tow a boat so that's the reason
[00:28:42] why I make a comment about that um I see
[00:28:45] people doing stuff Towing ridiculous
[00:28:46] things all the times and going like 80
[00:28:48] miles an hour down 95 so that's the re
[00:28:51] that's the only reason I make that
[00:28:52] comment I wanted to show that sorry if
[00:28:55] you guys probably all know what momentum
[00:28:56] is but I was a little little definite
[00:28:58] visualization of what that was today
[00:29:00] final destination [ __ ] that's some final
[00:29:02] yes that's some Final Destination [ __ ]
[00:29:04] right there literally every
[00:29:06] comment if one
[00:29:16] more n back here we
[00:29:22] go oh you've live in Minnesota all right
[00:29:24] buddy you know exactly what I'm talking
[00:29:25] about then yep if you've driven a truck
[00:29:27] in trailer truck my my U one of my good
[00:29:28] friends like my best friend growing up I
[00:29:31] still really good friends with him I
[00:29:32] just don't talk as much as I used to but
[00:29:34] um he was a truck driver also he
[00:29:36] actually came bobtail to my house a
[00:29:37] couple times but anyways he um he uh he
[00:29:40] gave me some good stories too one of my
[00:29:42] stories that I have is I I was well we
[00:29:45] were I was driving I was behind the
[00:29:47] trailer truck and um I was going to work
[00:29:50] one day and you just see this trailer
[00:29:52] truck going down just noral no problem
[00:29:54] New Hampshire no problem not a problem
[00:29:56] at all and then this car decides hey I
[00:29:58] think I'd go to go and pull over and cut
[00:29:59] in front of this guy and as I got truck
[00:30:01] got cut in front of this truck does this
[00:30:04] you could just see it just wobble on two
[00:30:06] because it tries to dodge it so it
[00:30:08] doesn't run that car over as that car
[00:30:09] pulls away that truck does this on two
[00:30:12] you can see the back of that on two
[00:30:13] wheels and I was like oh my God we're
[00:30:14] all going to die now and then there
[00:30:16] comes down the truck driver wobbles a
[00:30:19] little bit forward and then that car
[00:30:20] peels away and he walls a little bit
[00:30:21] forward and then the truck settles back
[00:30:23] down the trailer and he pulls and then
[00:30:25] like not not lying it was like a half
[00:30:27] mile later a mile later where there's a
[00:30:28] stop a truck stop like a stop that you
[00:30:30] can pull over I pull over behind him
[00:30:32] because I'm like holy crap I'm like whoa
[00:30:34] I pull over behind him and I'm like I
[00:30:36] watch this guy get out of the truck he
[00:30:37] does one of these things I'm gonna I'm
[00:30:39] gonna give you a little visualization of
[00:30:40] this he does one of these things he gets
[00:30:42] out of his truck he
[00:30:51] goes oh
[00:30:53] God and goes in goes out of the truck
[00:30:57] goes back goes back and climbs back in
[00:30:59] his truck and
[00:31:02] goes and I just see him sitting at the
[00:31:04] wheel and I'm driving by and I
[00:31:06] go and he looks at me and he just looks
[00:31:09] down he's
[00:31:10] like I don't know I look over I'm like I
[00:31:13] don't know man I'm sorry I saw that
[00:31:15] happening but like I I like there was
[00:31:19] one of those situations where you know
[00:31:20] somebody says they got to check if they
[00:31:21] [ __ ] themselves this guy literally had
[00:31:24] to pull over to check if he [ __ ] himself
[00:31:26] and I mean when when you see the trailer
[00:31:28] truck on two trailer on two wheels I I
[00:31:30] can understand why he would have thought
[00:31:31] he might have [ __ ] himself
[00:31:35] but you never actually think you would
[00:31:37] see that in real life but it actually
[00:31:41] happened you're like oh my God people
[00:31:43] actually check that that's like an
[00:31:45] actual
[00:31:47] thing but I mean it was like it was like
[00:31:49] the Final Destination moment like I was
[00:31:51] sh that just a final destination moment
[00:31:53] it was just like that probably was a
[00:31:54] solid two seconds only but it sat it
[00:31:57] felt like for two minutes it was just on
[00:31:59] those two wheels going down the highway
[00:32:01] then came back
[00:32:10] down yeah anyways I got I got some
[00:32:13] stories of different things we've seen I
[00:32:14] I did a lot of driving growing up um
[00:32:17] around just up and down the um kind of
[00:32:20] the East Coast the and in New England
[00:32:23] area because my father was a fisherman
[00:32:24] and I'd help him go and drive to a boat
[00:32:26] sometimes
[00:32:28] so I drive around see a lot of different
[00:32:29] things and you
[00:32:33] learn oh dude yes I know that I um we I
[00:32:36] lived in New Hampshire so I not as bad
[00:32:38] as Minnesota for their snow but um we
[00:32:41] would we got our own fair share snow and
[00:32:43] then in the winter all of a sudden like
[00:32:45] the first one hits and everybody forgets
[00:32:46] how to drive you have the person that
[00:32:47] goes 10 miles an hour when there's a
[00:32:49] dusting and there's barely you don't
[00:32:52] really need to worry too much but then
[00:32:53] you get the person that goes like 70
[00:32:56] because yo I got four four wheel drive
[00:32:57] I'm good it's all right that there's two
[00:32:58] feet of snow I'm good with it no worries
[00:33:00] and then there's another one of my
[00:33:03] stories I was going up to visit my uh my
[00:33:05] wife the one of the first times that I
[00:33:07] was I was actually dating her and we in
[00:33:09] college borrowed my dad's truck to go
[00:33:11] and visit
[00:33:13] her she uh was up New Hampshire and I
[00:33:16] was in Massachusetts a snowstorm
[00:33:17] happened to come and I didn't know it
[00:33:19] was as bad as it was New Hampshire and
[00:33:20] I'm going it was like proud boat hey
[00:33:22] Randy how you doing just uh talking a
[00:33:24] little bit stories here and uh we uh
[00:33:27] going up I was driving up by myself and
[00:33:29] I'm going probably 30 to 35 because it's
[00:33:32] coming down pretty good at the time and
[00:33:35] the
[00:33:36] um and then I see this guy in a four
[00:33:39] four-wheel drive Toyota
[00:33:42] Tacoma go blow him by me blue Toyota
[00:33:45] Tacoma four-wheel drive go blow by four
[00:33:48] four-door one go blow him by me like
[00:33:50] that guy's gonna be dead
[00:33:52] soon and I'm I [ __ ] you not the word
[00:33:55] Dead comes out of my mouth or soon comes
[00:33:57] out of my mouth and the guy does
[00:34:00] something spins hits a corner and flips

[00:36:30] of the uh original cards here I'm trying
[00:36:32] to find some of the ones that look like

[00:37:09] right what's Jason zombie oh we got some
[00:37:10] zombie cards uh they us name as zombies
[00:37:13] instead of ghouls or zombies all right
[00:37:15] ghouls are zombies that makes sense
[00:37:16] ghouls or are zombies I was gonna I was
[00:37:18] wondering what they're goingon to
[00:37:20] do so I have um collectors
[00:37:24] of Lord of the Ring
[00:37:27] um the special edition in the original
[00:37:29] ones I also have collectors of um here
[00:37:34] normally they're up but because the
[00:37:36] Fallout day the stuff I didn't put them
[00:37:37] up
[00:37:38] but I put the these are all the
[00:37:41] collectors that I do have if you are
[00:37:44] interested in any collector boosters I
[00:37:46] have
[00:37:47] Infinity I have ioria I have Commander
[00:37:54] Masters I have Lord of the Rings special
[00:37:58] edition and also Lord of the Rings uh
[00:38:01] original ones
[00:38:04] there and then also as you uh see there
[00:38:07] The Fallout ones that we have
[00:38:11] in Commander
[00:38:16] [Music]
[00:38:20] Masters I know I I understand that one
[00:38:23] the uh when people when when the wife
[00:38:24] says no luckily I have my own separate
[00:38:26] account so it's uh we we only we have
[00:38:28] our separate account so if I buy
[00:38:30] something as long as it doesn't come out
[00:38:31] the family account type thing nobody
[00:38:32] really cares right but every now and
[00:38:34] again she does look at like seriously
[00:38:35] you bought that and then I look at her
[00:38:38] stuff and I go you buy things that I say
[00:38:40] Ser but I just don't say seriously
[00:38:42] that's the difference not as much she
[00:38:44] doesn't do it as much anymore though not
[00:38:46] as much anymore I will admit
[00:38:49] that draw a different card base draw
[00:38:51] card aren mutant Come Fly with Me
[00:38:53] sacrifice put one creature control
[00:38:54] against flying till return all right
[00:38:56] that's kind of
[00:38:58] interesting yes but we do have some
[00:38:59] Commander Masters if you want and uh
[00:39:02] remember Commander Masters everything
[00:39:03] actually I don't know can you um are you
[00:39:05] able to see uh everything there is that
[00:39:07] all covered up that's the pricing of
[00:39:08] everything that I have in all the all
[00:39:11] the uh boxes and and pricing too of
[00:39:14] everything that I have available the
[00:39:15] only thing that isn't in there right now
[00:39:18] I believe is infinity because I got that
[00:39:20] in yesterday and I forgot to put that in
[00:39:22] here so I would have to do a quick
[00:39:23] calculation for that um and then I have
[00:39:26] all also um some
[00:39:30] um floodland flood borne for um lurana
[00:39:33] that I don't have up there I've blisters
[00:39:34] if you like lurana my kids and everyone
[00:39:36] like lurana so we kind of do we were

[00:39:42] we can actually have some fun with it
[00:39:43] more you

[00:39:49] Commander Masters I actually have a
[00:39:51] commander Masters box that I have soft
[00:39:52] off to the side for my family that we
[00:39:54] have not opened and I don't know if I
[00:39:56] want to open it
[00:39:57] because um all the boxes that I got I
[00:40:01] got like probably seven or eight boxes
[00:40:03] from uh a distributor and then all of
[00:40:05] them I had two of them had a bunch of
[00:40:08] lotuses in them and I was like I don't
[00:40:09] want to open this one because I feel
[00:40:10] like it's not going to so like but then
[00:40:12] at the same time I'm like they all were
[00:40:14] not from one case they are from random
[00:40:16] ones so maybe they gave me all the Lotus
[00:40:19] boxes and I don't like like what do I do
[00:40:23] here but anyway sometimes well one of
[00:40:26] the days I'll end up open that one I've

[00:46:02] we're uh flax I think it is flex
[00:46:07] Flex Flex I always have a hard time
[00:46:10] trying to read you guys names is when
[00:46:11] you come in with them we're just um just
[00:46:13] going through my and sleeving up my
[00:46:15] Mutant deck that I got here um got some
[00:46:18] games on here if you guys want to play
[00:46:19] any of them our
[00:46:21] uh our adventure game that you can get
[00:46:24] yourself a free pack of cards even
[00:46:26] either way whether you get maybe it's a
[00:46:27] free pack uh maybe something like a play
[00:46:29] booster or homelands depending on what
[00:46:31] uh what could Shuffle up here maybe it's
[00:46:33] an AFR set or LCI but it's really up to
[00:46:37] what can Shuffle out there but if you
[00:46:38] get beat by the boss you go to the Vault
[00:46:39] and you get that pack in the back there
[00:46:41] that's the Vault pack the uh pack of
[00:46:44] cards just retro cards from '90s four I
[00:46:47] think that one's from right now I don't
[00:46:48] know three something
[00:46:50] cards I bought a bunch of um these old
[00:46:53] things I wanted to try to get baseball
[00:46:54] cards to do with them old on ones but
[00:46:56] the older the baseball card the more
[00:46:58] expensive and I was like I did not want
[00:47:00] to spend uh like
[00:47:01] $100 for like four packs of cards so I
[00:47:05] ended up doing it a little different and
[00:47:06] these are all uh different
[00:47:08] tcgs or trading cards from 80s on late
[00:47:13] 80s
[00:47:16] on but anyways the other thing is you
[00:47:19] could also win yourself a pack of cards
[00:47:21] uh the other ones if you want to play
[00:47:22] and always anyways you can always buy it
[00:47:24] individually there where the you know
[00:47:26] buy and by itself if you want but we're
[00:47:28] just kind of reading through these here
[00:47:30] screeching Scorch Beast flying Menace
[00:47:32] whenever Scorch Beast taxs each player
[00:47:34] gets two rack Hors you always have also
[00:47:37] the other games too if you want to check
[00:47:38] out the um frequently last questions I
[00:47:40] got actually a bunch of games in here
[00:47:42] that's why we're called fos
[00:47:44] Gamers how's everybody Saturday morning
[00:47:48] though we have a soccer game later in
[00:47:50] the day so we hanging out in the morning
[00:47:51] for a little while we have to leave at
[00:47:54] 1:30 we have to leave at 1:30 all right
[00:47:56] each player gets rad counter three rad
[00:47:58] counters you create X zombie mutant your
[00:48:00] tokens or X is the total number of rad
[00:48:01] counters among players oh
[00:48:04] wow that's an awesome one put
[00:48:07] one counters on each creature you
[00:48:09] control that's a zombie mutant oh wow
[00:48:11] that's a really nice
[00:48:15] card feel like you BP that one out you
[00:48:17] can ruin a game very quickly or you
[00:48:20] could win a game very quickly however
[00:48:21] you want to say
[00:48:24] it all right all right so I'm going to
[00:48:26] keep putting this up here now these ones
[00:48:27] the reason why I do this you can do this
[00:48:28] if you want pick one up yourself but I
[00:48:31] keep adding it together because it gives
[00:48:32] you a little bit extra points for your
[00:48:33] strength on your adventure through the
[00:48:35] game and the Wasteland that's the only
[00:48:36] reason I keep adding extra stuff to it
[00:48:39] now uh maybe you wanna maybe you want to
[00:48:41] do something like this where you want to
[00:48:43] go to the
[00:48:44] Wasteland but you
[00:48:49] also would like to try out your luck
[00:48:53] with some rings
[00:48:57] you want to go to the Wasteland well
[00:48:59] where do you want to go in the Wasteland
[00:49:00] we can uh if you want I mean you don't
[00:49:02] need to do a Fallout collector's one we
[00:49:03] could do something different if you'd
[00:49:05] like um but it did I just have them up
[00:49:08] there because you know the fallout
[00:49:09] Fallout came out and the Fallout days
[00:49:11] that's the game I got going on and I
[00:49:12] have all my Fallout stuff out as you can
[00:49:14] see there all my Fallout stuff out from
[00:49:16] all my games from over the years from
[00:49:18] waiting in line and getting
[00:49:20] stuff so my little my little dragon egg
[00:49:22] that we got in brand new the other day
[00:49:24] there too
[00:49:29] but uh let's put you can put this one up
[00:49:31] if
[00:49:35] uh yeah I know this set is really it
[00:49:37] should be really fun I haven't actually

[00:49:41] I've actually just just yesterday we
[00:49:43] went and opened up the commander deck

[00:50:03] that
[00:50:05] is you can jump on this Wasteland one

[01:11:57] capture
[01:11:59] done let's go over
[01:12:02] here replace the
[01:12:09] packs with
[01:12:12] that now I believe that has everything I
[01:12:14] have available in
[01:12:18] stock there you go everyone yeah there
[01:12:21] nice and easy to see right there
[01:12:22] everything I have available
[01:12:24] even though I may not if I don't have it
[01:12:25] in the buy now for whatever reason I
[01:12:27] mean not the buy now the the shop that's
[01:12:28] the reason why I I just been starting to
[01:12:30] slowly get everything in the
[01:12:33] shop so but we're going to put on
[01:12:36] another thing here I don't know maybe
[01:12:37] you want some uh modern
[01:12:39] horizons with your command your
[01:12:46] Fallout Brothers war no uh War of the
[01:12:49] spark War of the
[01:12:51] spark I do not have any brothers were at
[01:12:54] the moment I actually had been thinking
[01:12:55] about getting some uh depending on how
[01:12:58] some of the sales and things went on
[01:12:59] here recently but I've been waiting on
[01:13:01] um waiting on that I have actually
[01:13:03] someone that I could get a case from but
[01:13:04] I was like holding off on it to see what
[01:13:06] occurred with Fallout because I did go
[01:13:08] in a little larger with Fallout and I it
[01:13:10] seems I might be eating some of
[01:13:14] that but Josh no it's a war of the
[01:13:20] spark there you
[01:13:22] go
[01:13:30] but yeah let's see we got a fine finale
[01:13:33] all right fine
[01:13:35] finale turn two tar creatures yeah I got
[01:13:38] some Infinity because I like the
[01:13:40] shocklands that uh the Galaxy shocklands
[01:13:42] and the uh the regular uh Galaxy lands
[01:13:45] my kids like the Galaxy lands so we go
[01:13:47] on I want to get some of them to put in
[01:13:48] the I figur i' get one of them and then
[01:13:51] maybe um sell the rest for you guys do
[01:13:53] got a couple of them so see if you want
[01:13:54] any no Darkwater
[01:13:58] catacombs drown catacombs all
[01:14:03] right yeah if you buy two of those you
[01:14:05] get one strength a game that is
[01:14:09] correct yeah so if you say you wanted
[01:14:11] two of the two of the war of the spark
[01:14:12] you say hey I want two of those and what
[01:14:15] I would do here is I'd grab two of
[01:14:19] these put them right here for you all
[01:14:22] right this would be run up here for
[01:14:29] this and uh if you wanted to play the
[01:14:33] game you would just jump on that to play
[01:14:34] the game and that would be one strength
[01:14:36] in your adventure through the Wasteland
[01:14:38] there put it on for a few minutes so uh
[01:14:41] if you mean to think or whatever but
[01:14:43] there you go there's your exotic Orchard
[01:14:45] I like the Exotic Orchard that's always
[01:14:47] a great card de I feel like that's going
[01:14:49] to be in each one of these decks
[01:14:51] though we're at this is like the Doctor
[01:14:53] Who part of it where you get all those
[01:14:54] special
[01:14:57] lands FedEd pool is nice not that one
[01:15:00] yeah but that'll get you one strength in
[01:15:02] your adventure through the Wasteland you
[01:15:04] get those two packs of cards always get
[01:15:06] those it's just whether or not you uh
[01:15:09] can get three extra strength on top of
[01:15:11] it to come out and beat
[01:15:14] um you can potentially beat
[01:15:16] Mei the
[01:15:18] Velociraptor or Owen um if you get the
[01:15:22] up to four strength uh for that would be
[01:15:25] your three potentials that you could
[01:15:26] beat um because you're only starting out
[01:15:28] that at the one there but that would
[01:15:30] allow you to potentially come out with
[01:15:31] one of the packs there that we'd Shuffle
[01:15:33] and figure out or if um you lose you get
[01:15:35] that one in the vault there that Vault
[01:15:37] pack in the back whatever that 19 I
[01:15:39] think it's 94 is where it's
[01:15:43] from date
[01:15:46] frame but yeah that's the game if you
[01:15:47] want to try it out do your little own
[01:15:49] adventure being a uh a strong human
[01:15:52] wandering through the Wasteland
[01:15:56] angelan Harbor all right yeah this is
[01:15:58] the same as the other ones this is just
[01:16:00] like these are the uh this is the
[01:16:03] um doctor hul lands
[01:16:07] ones nesting
[01:16:10] grounds oh counters I like the moving
[01:16:18] counters sunken Hollow we know sunken
[01:16:21] Hollow we've played that before
[01:16:24] oh I like the Temple of the seit though
[01:16:27] art walltech Industries Temple of the
[01:16:30] seat art I like that
[01:16:36] one some of the art like oh that's
[01:16:38] awesome other Arts like all right that's
[01:16:41] art like this one's like not bad it's
[01:16:43] just like not
[01:16:44] great I feel like there could have been
[01:16:46] something better in the background
[01:16:49] though I do like it though I do like it
[01:16:51] though the the chair with the waist
[01:16:53] saying glowing in the
[01:16:55] [Music]
[01:16:57] back here we go here our Temple of
[01:17:01] Mastery all right Josh gonna try try try
[01:17:05] your luck on the game
[01:17:07] here I'll finish letting it run uh since
[01:17:09] we're just hanging out here watching
[01:17:10] this and then uh we'll see what happens
[01:17:12] all right Woodland
[01:17:16] symmetry morre Meyer all right morre
[01:17:22] Meer
[01:17:25] at least um with war of the spark I'm
[01:17:26] pretty sure each one you get a uh a
[01:17:28] plaines Walker card in it too which is
[01:17:32] nice opulent Palace all right you can
[01:17:35] add oh nice this is like the triom ones
[01:17:39] I like with triom it's like the c k
[01:17:41] triome Kat triome ones katri triome type
[01:17:44] ones actually that's I wonder if they
[01:17:46] have Tri oh they don't have trium in
[01:17:48] here because if they do the this deck
[01:17:50] would have been this set would have been
[01:17:52] way more uh purchas if they had triom in
[01:17:57] this any color path
[01:18:01] anchest because I love triom that is
[01:18:03] probably one of my favorite things uh
[01:18:05] that they made with the triom there love
[01:18:07] bringing those
[01:18:18] out oh nice you make all your decks and
[01:18:20] you purchase Plaines Walker party I
[01:18:22] purchased I purchased a lot of the
[01:18:23] pre-build ones because I like playing
[01:18:24] with the family and it's easy to have
[01:18:26] them and all play together I've only I
[01:18:28] haven't really built many of them other
[01:18:29] than upgrade them but the Plaines Walker
[01:18:32] party one I do have two and that is
[01:18:33] pretty
[01:18:36] funny funny fun
[01:18:39] huh tainted wood I like that the little
[01:18:42] pool there I do like that art that's a
[01:18:44] good art one though I like that
[01:18:51] art
[01:18:53] off the Temple of false
[01:18:55] god kind of a normal
[01:18:59] art my friends play precons and they are
[01:19:02] upgraded and they walk all over my
[01:19:03] homemade back alley
[01:19:05] [Laughter]
[01:19:07] drop see I I um see the thing is the
[01:19:10] back alley ones that's just like a kind
[01:19:12] of like a tabletop you're throw in your
[01:19:13] cards together I feel like half of those
[01:19:15] ones it's whether unless you have the
[01:19:16] money to build an expensive deck it's
[01:19:19] it's generally it's just like a kind of
[01:19:20] a poppish type deck and you're just
[01:19:21] having fun with it
[01:19:25] exactly you needed something to try to
[01:19:27] keep up so you had to get one of the
[01:19:30] decks terramorphic

[01:21:42] I've dealed crap like that on a regular
[01:21:47] basis don't worry about it i' I've dealt
[01:21:49] with that before um I myself I bought
[01:21:52] when I buy sometimes on different things
[01:21:53] and my count like shuts off and I'm like

[01:22:08] [Laughter]
[01:22:15] [Applause]
[01:22:17] name it's airing for ah not on my end
[01:22:21] but it might be on your end so if it is
[01:22:24] you might need to call and say uh say
[01:22:27] something to
[01:22:29] them yeah yep that's probably what it is
[01:22:32] every single time um I purchase on some
[01:22:34] of these sites it does that the after if
[01:22:37] I purchased if I haven't purchase once
[01:22:40] because they I guess um they worry about
[01:22:42] it with where you're going through it's
[01:22:43] an online site so you just might need to
[01:22:45] go and hit okay on your like your app
[01:22:48] that says for your
[01:22:51] uh whatever you call call it your um
[01:22:54] your bank
[01:22:55] app I've i' I've had to deal with it
[01:22:57] myself so don't worry about it I I
[01:23:00] understand take your time
[01:23:05] bud I'm G to put oh what I'll do here
[01:23:07] though well we wait to give it a minute
[01:23:09] or so because I understand I've been
[01:23:10] there more than once
[01:23:12] myself I'm going to put some of the rest
[01:23:14] of these art ones in here and take a
[01:23:16] look at them I do like this this I mean
[01:23:18] our swamps in here our lands because
[01:23:20] that's nice art there with the little
[01:23:22] flying one
[01:23:24] there this is from like Fallout
[01:23:28] oneish I wonder if they actually took
[01:23:30] scenes from
[01:23:32] them because that would be great if they
[01:23:39] did nice basic
[01:23:44] lands CU this one I feel like could be a
[01:23:46] scene from the original
[01:23:49] game or like two maybe
[01:23:53] [Music]
[01:23:57] going do this here another one more
[01:23:59] swamps we got that one same one our
[01:24:01] forest ah is that a nuke going off in
[01:24:04] the back no that's a tree
[01:24:11] growing there you go some mutants
[01:24:14] growing in the forest
[01:24:21] there
[01:24:24] that one reminds me of one with the way
[01:24:26] the characters are so small like
[01:24:30] that or maybe that was the uh the one
[01:24:33] where it was uh the Brotherhood battle
[01:24:35] one where it was like the uh dungeon
[01:24:36] crawling thing that wasn't great it
[01:24:38] wasn't bad though it was just like a
[01:24:40] dungeon crawling game base one
[01:24:49] Fallout just let me know uh I'll see
[01:24:51] when everything works here and just let
[01:24:52] me know if you have any issue once it
[01:24:54] goes through I'll take care of it too
[01:24:58] obviously back to where we get some new
[01:25:00] Arts got an
[01:25:06] island I already seen that Island art
[01:25:09] that was in the other
[01:25:11] ones Yep this is the same island art
[01:25:13] from the other deck the full art
[01:25:18] ones all
[01:25:21] right
[01:25:27] no problem should um I'll rerun that
[01:25:31] here for
[01:25:37] you
[01:25:38] um there you
[01:25:42] go it is these two
[01:25:51] there I don't know if it's GNA yeah it
[01:25:53] should work there yeah there we
[01:25:57] go yeah sometimes they uh they flag you
[01:26:00] like that because you're um purchasing
[01:26:02] on these things and I don't I never I
[01:26:04] understand it at the same time but it's
[01:26:06] uh it's one of those ones that it's
[01:26:08] frustrating at the same time when you
[01:26:10] understand it even though you understand
[01:26:11] it it's
[01:26:13] frustrating like you know the bank is
[01:26:15] trying to protect you trying to save you
[01:26:17] you know make sure you're not doing
[01:26:18] anything wrong or someone's not doing
[01:26:20] anything wrong in your name
[01:26:24] there's our wise Moth Man so somebody on
[01:26:27] one of the reddits was like hey I got
[01:26:28] this card out of here and it was a thick
[01:26:30] one it was really hard like is it and it
[01:26:32] feels like it could be gold around the
[01:26:34] edge what is it there's so many people

[01:26:37] the magic golden ticket and I was like

[01:28:47] can eat that potato they pick that
[01:28:48] potato up and it gives them some RADS
[01:28:51] that's not good it knocks them down from
[01:28:53] one strength down to zero so they're
[01:28:56] wandering around they're not completely
[01:28:57] dead but you know what maybe they can
[01:29:00] find something you want to try try your
[01:29:02] luck you want to have uh Nolan do
[01:29:03] another random one for
[01:29:07] you all right we can keep doing it him
[01:29:09] the entire time or you can see one
[01:29:11] yourself maybe we get some luck for you
[01:29:13] maybe it is uh your own go for all no
[01:29:16] pick a good one for
[01:29:18] him let's see what we get here we we run
[01:29:22] into an angel the technician the angel
[01:29:25] does not help it is an enemy to the
[01:29:28] technician the technician finds an enemy
[01:29:30] in the Wasteland to attack them and they
[01:29:32] end up losing another strength they're
[01:29:34] actually a little tired wandering
[01:29:36] through the Wasteland now they made it
[01:29:37] away safely they aren't completely dead
[01:29:40] but they did make it away safely and
[01:29:42] they're wandering through the Wasteland
[01:29:43] they do only have negative one strength
[01:29:45] though but hold on give me a minute I
[01:29:46] got to shuffle these up one I know
[01:29:48] they're almost dead they're dying their
[01:29:50] strength is down their health isn't gone
[01:29:52] but they're very
[01:29:53] weak they can't punch they very weak
[01:29:56] they can't really punch they can't hit
[01:29:57] yeah let's see what happens though they
[01:29:58] maybe they'll find a friend that will
[01:30:00] help them get their strength back up and
[01:30:02] teach them a little something let's see
[01:30:04] that that one is no oh
[01:30:07] no we Nolan you do not have any luck for
[01:30:10] our buddy this a we got a detective that
[01:30:12] brings him down even more strength the
[01:30:14] detective tricks him tells him go to the
[01:30:16] left around that that house and he ends
[01:30:18] up falling on and down in a little pit
[01:30:21] getting knocked out a little and then
[01:30:23] what happens is afterwards he wakes up
[01:30:25] he's a little unconscious days dazed and
[01:30:27] wandering
[01:30:29] around and then he finds his sing in the
[01:30:31] distance he goes you know I think I see
[01:30:32] another distance I see another boss in
[01:30:35] the distance
[01:30:36] there let's see if we can find a boss
[01:30:39] that's going to give a what it maybe
[01:30:41] that's a friend in the distance oh maybe
[01:30:42] it's a boss we're not sure I think it's
[01:30:44] going to be a boss though what do you
[01:30:45] think it's gonna be a boss right what
[01:30:47] what what do you think we're gonna do
[01:30:48] here Nolan that one all right let's turn
[01:30:51] that around oh oh no Nolan did not come
[01:30:54] out with any luck you round the corner
[01:30:56] and you see a flame the building saon
[01:30:59] turns around flicks you away you go
[01:31:02] landing flying through the Wasteland you
[01:31:05] land next to a vault and you go you know
[01:31:08] what oh crawl in through that Vault
[01:31:10] tired almost dying and when you get into
[01:31:13] that Vault you find a safe and in that
[01:31:15] safe you do find a pack but you go this

[01:34:54] because I think ravnik has a few bucks
[01:34:56] there I like to do this if it's okay
[01:34:58] with you because it helps with shipping
[01:35:00] to keep them in the top loader so they
[01:35:01] don't fall out now I do like this I put
[01:35:03] them in here and I'll show you what I'm
[01:35:05] talking about now if you tell me stop
[01:35:07] right now I
[01:35:12] will what was the hit and last oh the
[01:35:14] hit in last pack you a rabika of at war
[01:35:18] in the Elder spell um and then uh you
[01:35:22] had four and don't worry about that I
[01:35:24] understand I got kids myself I don't do
[01:35:25] diapers anymore
[01:35:27] but naret parter of veils was your uh
[01:35:31] your Plaines Walker and then your other
[01:35:35] one was uh the ples Walker I believe was
[01:35:39] do Doven hand of
[01:35:42] control yeah I just uh I'll show you
[01:35:44] what I mean because uh this is what I
[01:35:46] learned myself when I got some stuff I
[01:35:49] ordered that I had when I ordered like a
[01:35:50] individual car card one time so they
[01:35:53] sent the individual card and it came in
[01:35:55] a top loader perfect I like that awesome
[01:35:57] everybody wants that individual card in
[01:35:58] top loader but whatever for some reason
[01:36:01] during shipping it came and it was like
[01:36:03] sticking out of the top loader a little
[01:36:04] bit and I ended up finding out that if
[01:36:07] you uh put both two of them in here all
[01:36:10] right and then you do this you give it a
[01:36:12] tap down because it doesn't go down very
[01:36:14] easily but you can tap it down it
[01:36:16] doesn't harm the card at
[01:36:18] all and it stays in here and won't come
[01:36:23] out so that's my little thing for
[01:36:25] shipping there I know thank you Josh
[01:36:27] thank you now we got that if you want to
[01:36:28] open that or I can ship that home for
[01:36:30] you that's that recro retro pack that
[01:36:32] you end up getting

[01:36:56] to the boss you do come out with a retro
[01:37:00] pack of cards from either somewhere

[01:44:33] actually since uh the first version came
[01:44:37] out when I was a teenager in the
[01:44:40] 90s actually barely a teenager I
[01:44:45] think you know what I'm talking
[01:44:48] about oh
[01:44:51] my there we go there we go I like
[01:44:55] that ah nice nice yeah so yeah if you
[01:44:58] want go hang out here we're just kind of
[01:45:00] going through these and open up my
[01:45:01] commander decks I opened up the science
[01:45:03] one earlier this is the mutant one we
[01:45:06] just finished an
[01:45:09] opening um then I'll probably I'll open
[01:45:11] up one of the other ones here next what
[01:45:13] is the next one I'll go
[01:45:16] with let's see what we go with next here
[01:45:19] we've got hail Caesar or you know what I
[01:45:22] want to do the Survivor one last so I
[01:45:24] think I'm going to do hail Caesar first
[01:45:26] but hey if you want you can jump in play
[01:45:27] the game here um I just been putting
[01:45:30] Fallout stuff up because fallout's a big
[01:45:32] thing you can choose whatever you want
[01:45:34] you you know there's all the packs that
[01:45:36] I have there available um it may not be
[01:45:39] in the store but I've been working on
[01:45:41] getting them all in the store but if you
[01:45:42] want you can tell me if you want any of
[01:45:43] them there and I can put them up for
[01:45:44] like a for for the game easily it's just
[01:45:47] uh it makes it easier that way you guys
[01:45:49] can um see them e easy and I can update
[01:45:51] them easier all the
[01:45:54] time let's put something like
[01:46:00] um you know what let's do this one again
[01:46:04] I think I I think I put this one in
[01:46:05] earlier on let's try that one again
[01:46:07] maybe we want some a couple collector
[01:46:08] boosters that'll get you two strength on
[01:46:11] your adventure through the Wasteland not
[01:46:12] one that's two strength maybe you're
[01:46:14] going to be able to beat that uh because
[01:46:17] if that gets you one two if you get five
[01:46:19] strength and you win with five strength
[01:46:21] we actually end up putting a collector
[01:46:23] booster in there and it'll end up being
[01:46:25] an Infinity collector booster we end up
[01:46:27] throwing in here as a potential of you
[01:46:30] winning but that no one's gotten
[01:46:32] anything over four yet when we've played
[01:46:34] on here I've had it on some of the other
[01:46:35] ones where people gotten five and six
[01:46:37] but they've also bought some of the
[01:46:38] other types of packs we've had too so
[01:46:39] let me run this here I'm going put this
[01:46:41] one up if you want these
[01:46:44] ones and this will get you an adventure
[01:46:46] through the
[01:46:49] Wasteland

[02:01:05] it's like you find something in the
[02:01:07] vault and if you get beat you you know
[02:01:08] you don't always find something good
[02:01:09] with you find junk sometimes in the
[02:01:11] vault in in a safe so I figure you know
[02:01:14] this is some of the fun junk you could
[02:01:15] find in the safe it was just kind of
[02:01:16] like a pack of cards that were fun to
[02:01:18] open and if you got beat by the boss and
[02:01:20] if you won you got a new pack another
[02:01:22] pack so that's why I thought it was a
[02:01:23] fun game to play there you go Mo thank
[02:01:26] you I do appreciate it there Mo

[02:20:09] game here no one's uh jumping in on it
[02:20:11] maybe it's the maybe it's the packs that
[02:20:13] I'm putting

[02:20:26] tap one one all right
[02:20:28] interesting we'll put those back over
[02:20:31] here no one wants to go with any Fallout
[02:20:34] though I will say that that's
[02:20:36] intriguing I may have made a Bad Bet I
[02:20:41] guess more it's uh I actually think a
[02:20:44] lot of it is that um
[02:20:48] wizard The Coast put a bad taste in
[02:20:50] everybody's mouth with how they came out
[02:20:51] with
[02:20:54] this we're going to put that up that'll
[02:20:56] get you two strength on your adventure
[02:20:57] through the Wasteland if you want
[02:21:00] it we'll put those up and you can uh do
[02:21:03] a different one you don't need me to
[02:21:04] pick it for you remember you can always
[02:21:06] pick your own
[02:21:07] adventure I'm going to continue to put
[02:21:09] my uh my decks here away thank you
[02:21:13] coming in and hanging out we do
[02:21:14] appreciate it everyone that comes in
[02:21:18] remember whenever you uh Play The
[02:21:20] Adventure game you get a free pack of
[02:21:22] cards whether it is one of the ones that
[02:21:23] get shuffled from here maybe it's a play
[02:21:25] booster maybe it's a forgotten realm set
[02:21:27] maybe it's a uh homelands booster but if
[02:21:30] you get beat by the boss you do still
[02:21:32] get a pack of cards it's just a pack of
[02:21:34] cards from 1992 or just a little retro
[02:21:37] card pack
[02:21:39] there but you always get something it's
[02:21:41] whether or not you get lucky where you

[02:43:14] to end up getting
[02:43:15] uh you know what this is going to end up
[02:43:17] being a bigger uh set I think than they
[02:43:19] believe because the trion's in
[02:43:22] here lot of people like
[02:43:25] triumps basically work past 24 hours so
[02:43:28] now just chilling on the couch glass of
[02:43:29] wine and decided to see what's up on
[02:43:31] drip hey that sounds fun well I mean the
[02:43:34] chilling now not working 24 hours I I
[02:43:37] understand that I've been
[02:43:38] um my father was a fisherman and he
[02:43:41] owned his own boat so we used to have to
[02:43:43] go out fishing with him well I didn't
[02:43:44] have to but I did go out fishing with
[02:43:46] him and you work for the two weeks
[02:43:48] you're out there you pretty much work
[02:43:49] from sun up to sun down then you sleep
[02:43:52] then you work up sun up to sun down you
[02:43:53] sleep so I understand
[02:43:56] that little tainted
[02:43:58] Peak I've had some different jobs
[02:44:01] throughout my life I've been everything
[02:44:02] from Blue Collar to kind of white cish
[02:44:05] stuff to uh starting my own business is
[02:44:08] stuff like doing this here so I've been
[02:44:10] all over the place everything from um
[02:44:12] fishing to trading billion SE billions
[02:44:15] of dollars being traded in a day and
[02:44:17] trillions in a week being traded for
[02:44:19] stock market stuff to uh pulling fish
[02:44:23] out of
[02:44:28] Nets nice art ones there we've seen
[02:44:30] these art ones before that's why I'm
[02:44:31] kind of going through them a little
[02:44:34] quickly I saw them in the other ones
[02:44:36] they're all the same ones it's just a
[02:44:37] little different uh what you get here I
[02:44:41] remember the train station
[02:44:43] though you play uh fallout any
[02:44:47] chance I had played it myself growing up
[02:44:50] since the first game so I was a big fan
[02:44:51] of it so I went in pretty big with
[02:44:53] Fallout stuff here I bought um six I
[02:44:58] think it be end up being nine boxes here
[02:45:00] by the time I'm done with it I was going
[02:45:02] to end up being over 12 but um looks
[02:45:04] like things are slowing down and no
[02:45:06] one's getting any so I might not
[02:45:07] actually end up getting the rest of
[02:45:10] them so I've had more that were coming
[02:45:12] in today from overseas and the other one
[02:45:15] they said they weren't going to be they
[02:45:16] they were coming in late to them for
[02:45:17] some reason so I'm going to wait to see
[02:45:19] what they say there but um if it ends up
[02:45:21] not getting there I might end up having
[02:45:23] to cancel it because it's a lot later
[02:45:24] than I was expecting them to get them
[02:45:26] dad's a sailor does yacht pickups and
[02:45:28] drops chariz currently sailing in
[02:45:30] Argentina oh wow all right yeah so you
[02:45:33] know the sailing life my family actually
[02:45:35] um we're actually looking to we're
[02:45:37] actually going to be looking to buy our
[02:45:38] own SBO to Catamaran in the in the near
[02:45:40] future here and um start I personally
[02:45:43] have been trying to get my wife and
[02:45:44] family to do a sailing do sale and uh
[02:45:46] kind of sail the Caribbean learn a
[02:45:48] little bit and then do a maybe sail
[02:45:49] around the world if they want to do that
[02:45:51] Adventure but I've wanted to do that
[02:45:53] since I met my wife I told her that like
[02:45:54] 20 plus years ago so she knows exactly
[02:45:57] what it's just now I think she's finally
[02:45:59] on
[02:46:00] board so maybe in the future you'll see
[02:46:03] us rolling around the uh the world in a
[02:46:06] catamaran I know on the 23rd of the
[02:46:09] month we're going to uh actually go out
[02:46:10] on a 48 foot one to uh test it out do a
[02:46:13] test sale see if we like it
[02:46:17] I like the mountains
[02:46:19] here get your dog there with you as your
[02:46:25] friend and you get your other one there
[02:46:28] not
[02:46:32] bad well when you visit South Africa
[02:46:34] shout out and pop out in for a bus you
[02:46:36] know what I will definitely if I when I
[02:46:38] visit South Africa when we go around I
[02:46:40] will make sure I'm like you know what I
[02:46:42] had a person that I talked to I gotta I
[02:46:44] got a pay them when we're going in that
[02:46:46] direction because that is definitely one
[02:46:47] of those places that I've wanted to go
[02:46:49] to I actually have had a
[02:46:51] um um a couple of trips that I had
[02:46:53] planned on doing that were like
[02:46:54] motorcycle trips where they started in
[02:46:56] South Africa and went through went up
[02:46:58] through some places I think namia was
[02:47:01] one of them they went
[02:47:02] to um and like kind of went up that area
[02:47:05] on like a little uh motorcycle trip I've
[02:47:08] been looking to do but I had a bad luck
[02:47:10] with some surgery and had been able to
[02:47:12] sit down on a motorcycle for a couple
[02:47:13] years so that one was put on the
[02:47:15] on the back
[02:47:18] burner building her reenie and Siri deck
[02:47:21] out just completed it now but need to
[02:47:23] get those lands for yes n oh yeah yeah
[02:47:26] crap happens I've had some bad luck in
[02:47:27] the world but I have some good luck in
[02:47:29] other places so so what can you you kind
[02:47:31] of take the good and the bad
[02:47:33] right hey but that's cool that she loves
[02:47:35] a dog lands building her Ren and Siri
[02:47:38] deck now completed nice that's that's
[02:47:40] nice those dog lands ones I do like the
[02:47:42] lands with the dogs there them holding
[02:47:43] them there
[02:47:45] but hey one of these days um yeah if I
[02:47:47] end up over there I will definitely I'll
[02:47:49] definitely send you a little a ping
[02:47:50] there when I'm get that direction
[02:47:52] because I I we're looking at it like I
[02:47:53] said we're looking at it here my guess
[02:47:55] it will probably be like five to six
[02:47:56] years before I'm anywhere around that
[02:47:58] side of the world on the boat if we end
[02:48:00] up getting one like this year next year
[02:48:01] like I want but um if I'm lucky that is
[02:48:05] we'll get the one of them I want there
[02:48:07] were three of them that we went to the
[02:48:09] Miami Boat Show a few weeks ago and
[02:48:10] there were like three of different ones
[02:48:11] that I saw that I liked uh that were
[02:48:14] three different cat brands that we saw
[02:48:15] one of them was like a fully electric
[02:48:16] one which I like really like but I'm not
[02:48:18] a millionaire to afford
[02:48:22] it I'd like to be maybe if the company I
[02:48:25] used to work for that was a startup that
[02:48:27] only had like 20 people when I started
[02:48:28] working there and they now control a lot
[02:48:30] of Stock Exchange stuff maybe uh maybe
[02:48:33] when they sell my private stock there
[02:48:35] maybe I will be lucky enough to afford
[02:48:37] it and if so we'll see
[02:48:40] you we all wish we were millionaires I
[02:48:42] know right every that's that's why we
[02:48:45] buy the lottery tickets all the time
[02:48:49] correct that's true I didn't think about
[02:48:51] that exchange rate is things cheap
[02:48:52] cheaper
[02:48:54] there you know I've actually thought
[02:48:56] about going to some of the other
[02:48:58] countries to look for boats personally I
[02:49:01] actually have thought of going to um
[02:49:02] some other countries and check out some
[02:49:03] of their boats just because um like I
[02:49:05] know the exchange rate is different and
[02:49:07] I might be able to get lucky and find a
[02:49:08] good one at a good price because of
[02:49:10] [Laughter]
[02:49:13] it I'll have to say I buy a lottery
[02:49:16] ticket all the time though Mo Mo's
[02:49:18] family well you know you g to try I had
[02:49:20] a girlfriend in
[02:49:21] um in uh high school that um she was
[02:49:26] like kind of I I hung out with her After
[02:49:28] High School um like at when I my
[02:49:30] freshman year at college and she said
[02:49:32] she was doing some what was it she was
[02:49:34] becoming a masseuse and they were
[02:49:36] talking about how if you will the things
[02:49:38] in the world they'll happen for you well
[02:49:41] one of the things she said she was
[02:49:42] willing herself to win a million dollars
[02:49:43] I'm like oh cool what what Lottery what
[02:49:45] lottery ticket you buying or what what
[02:49:46] are you playing I don't buy lottery
[02:49:50] tickets like that's a waste of
[02:49:53] money I look at her I'm like well then
[02:49:55] how are you going to win a million
[02:49:59] dollars and her face as she looked at me
[02:50:01] it was like it dawned on her
[02:50:04] like oh yeah I can't win a million
[02:50:07] dollars if I don't do that I'm like yeah
[02:50:10] what like seriously like this is why we
[02:50:12] are not dating anymore necessarily you
[02:50:14] know those type of things that I can't
[02:50:16] handle all the time I can handle every
[02:50:17] now and again
[02:50:19] little I
[02:50:22] know all right that's our Caesar deck
[02:50:26] there all right I'm gonna have to uh
[02:50:28] open up my other one here and see what
[02:50:29] we get in that by there then we'll maybe
[02:50:32] maybe we'll open up the uh sample packs
[02:50:34] after but if you guys want anybody you
[02:50:37] can play whatever you want for the
[02:50:38] adventure game you don't need to pick um
[02:50:40] what I'm putting up you can pick
[02:50:41] whatever you want there right here tells
[02:50:43] you the um strength that you get per
[02:50:46] pack that you're getting the adventure
[02:50:48] game what you do here is you wander
[02:50:50] through the Wasteland all right you pick
[02:50:52] a character maybe you want to be a
[02:50:53] mutant wandering through the
[02:50:55] Wasteland maybe you want to be a
[02:50:57] detective as you wander through I don't
[02:50:59] know but whatever it is that you wander
[02:51:01] through with one of those four
[02:51:02] characters you have three boxes here red
[02:51:05] green and blue they all are plus one or
[02:51:07] minus one depending on which one is in
[02:51:09] there and whatever you pull out you get
[02:51:11] a plus one or minus one for your
[02:51:13] character and then if you're good if
[02:51:15] you're strong enough you can either beat
[02:51:17] one of one you could beat the
[02:51:20] Velociraptor Owen
[02:51:23] Grady or Miri with picking out just
[02:51:27] starting out with just potentially of
[02:51:28] having one strength but if you start out
[02:51:32] and you start out with say like three
[02:51:33] strength you could actually come out
[02:51:35] with six strength uh I mean say you
[02:51:38] start with like three and a half
[02:51:39] strength because you get like a couple
[02:51:40] the extra packs there the higher price
[02:51:42] ones you could actually start out with
[02:51:43] over that and beat in
[02:51:46] generator and T-Rex also which will
[02:51:49] allow you to have a 50/50 chance to
[02:51:59] play oh you look for M weather light
[02:52:04] everywhere I have um I might have
[02:52:08] another
[02:52:10] one I'd have to look I might have
[02:52:12] another one somewhere but I would that's
[02:52:15] why mine I was planning on keeping
[02:52:23] it yeah if I can find uh I if I have
[02:52:26] another one I will let you know I have
[02:52:28] some
[02:52:31] singles I don't know if I have
[02:52:35] any I don't know if I have
[02:52:41] mey I don't know if I do or not
[02:52:46] trying to think if I have another one I
[02:52:47] don't think I do I think that might be
[02:52:48] the only one I
[02:52:54] had but anyways if you want you can
[02:52:56] maybe maybe uh maybe uh you can
[02:52:58] have your your wife will play the game
[02:53:01] and battle Mary as a
[02:53:04] [Music]
[02:53:06] mutant we'll see what happens there but
[02:53:09] we're going to put this one up I'll put
[02:53:10] these up this is the adventure like I
[02:53:12] said you can pick whatever you want
[02:53:15] I'm just putting these up randomly
[02:53:16] because this is literally random packs
[02:53:18] I'm pulling out this will be one and a
[02:53:20] half strength to start your adventure
[02:53:22] this will allow you to potentially get
[02:53:23] yourself one of the wins here maybe you
[02:53:25] come out with that pack of card from
[02:53:27] 1992 the Retro pack of card from
[02:53:30] something from
[02:53:31] 1992 red button all right so the red
[02:53:34] button I'll explain that one what
[02:53:36] happens with the red button is you press
[02:53:38] the red button and you choose anywhere
[02:53:42] out of these two boxes that you want to
[02:53:44] go cuz there would there used to be
[02:53:46] 1,600 cards I think it's down to about
[02:53:49] um about 1,300 now then what happens is
[02:53:52] is you uh you press the red
[02:53:55] button all right we do this we press our
[02:53:57] red button we fire our
[02:54:00] missiles and then you tell me where you
[02:54:02] want to go in here and you see where you
[02:54:04] land and we pull out whatever it is for
[02:54:06] the cards that you got get there now the
[02:54:08] the cards are anywhere from 10 cents to
[02:54:10] about I think a $150 there might be a
[02:54:12] couple $2 cards in there most of the
[02:54:14] cards are between 50 and 10 cents but
[02:54:16] you do have as you see all the packs you
[02:54:17] could pull out um of there and
[02:54:20] potentially even um if you're lucky
[02:54:23] there is one card that has a whole
[02:54:24] collector booster box written on it so
[02:54:26] if you get lucky you'll pull out a whole
[02:54:27] collector booster box out of one of
[02:54:29] those cards and that's really how it
[02:54:30] goes maybe um maybe you're lucky and you
[02:54:32] go up to space you take out a satellite
[02:54:35] which is when you hit a which is when
[02:54:37] you pull out a pack of cards or maybe
[02:54:40] you're unlucky and you come Crashing
[02:54:41] Down to Earth because you only get
[02:54:43] things that are uh no packs or written
[02:54:44] anything on them but that is how our red
[02:54:48] button works there if you want to try
[02:54:51] it pretty fun we have some fun with
[02:54:54] it sometimes we
[02:54:58] do but that's the uh that's the red
[02:55:01] button we do that all the time we have
[02:55:02] people playing that on a regular
[02:55:05] basis and yesterday we had somebody that
[02:55:07] came out with a a play booster of merg
[02:55:10] at Carlo Manor so there are you do see
[02:55:12] the thing stuff that's in there just
[02:55:14] whether or not you're going to be the
[02:55:15] lucky one to hit
[02:55:19] the collector booster
[02:55:22] box I just needed some more uh sleeves
[02:55:25] over
[02:55:27] here we
[02:55:35] later but that is the red button if you
[02:55:37] want to try it we've had a I've had a
[02:55:38] few people playing it here I initially
[02:55:41] had made the red button I actually
[02:55:42] didn't make the red want to make
[02:55:43] anything like that but I had made it
[02:55:45] because I had some requests from people
[02:55:47] to make a high value box and I'm like I
[02:55:49] don't have many high value cards that I
[02:55:51] want to get rid of myself like well then
[02:55:53] put a collector Booster Box in I'm like
[02:55:54] know I could do that so we made the high
[02:55:56] big big hit box I'm not a big fan of it
[02:56:00] but I also was figuring it would be
[02:56:01] something you know you throw in and
[02:56:02] people would go hey give me a couple red
[02:56:04] buttons when I get a pack rather than
[02:56:05] just a bunch of buttons you know that
[02:56:07] type of
[02:56:13] thing all right we can try that if you'd
[02:56:15] like
[02:56:17] yeah let me know uh you can try the red
[02:56:21] button not a problem at
[02:56:23] all um it should be in the um the shop
[02:56:28] for
[02:56:31] you but I'll do this all we go we're
[02:56:34] going to go with the red button let's
[02:56:35] try our
[02:56:38] luck Duncan on the red button now as
[02:56:42] this red button hits

[02:57:14] me which side you want to go I can do
[02:57:16] random I can do a certain number I can
[02:57:19] pull one of the boys over here to pull
[02:57:20] one out for you to see if they get any
[02:57:21] luck for
[02:57:23] it that's uh it's up to you what we
[02:57:26] would like to do our buddy

[02:57:44] button we're going to fire our
[02:57:46] missiles wait wait wait launch our
[02:57:50] missiles fire our
[02:57:53] missiles and that's where he set his
[02:57:55] going now hold on we pick that one and
[02:57:57] we'll hold it up and if he we'll see is
[02:57:59] that is this okay we good with that
[02:58:01] Duncan that is that's the
[02:58:05] choice and we'll all right sure here we
[02:58:08] go flip it over let's see what
[02:58:10] happens oh we got a V2 gazi inspector we
[02:58:14] did uh we did not get a big hit We Came
[02:58:17] Crashing Down to Earth with a bad with a
[02:58:21] big explosion
[02:58:24] there let me get your name written down
[02:58:26] here D NH
[02:58:33] H there we go I'm sorry buddy we did not
[02:58:36] get a big hit for you but you know what
[02:58:39] that's why it's a six that's why there
[02:58:40] are 1600 cards in there that was a big
[02:58:42] chance box
[02:58:47] let's see I'll put you over here thank
[02:58:48] you thank you do appreciate that that
[02:58:50] was fun the boys love playing the games
[02:58:52] and playing hang out with us so that's
[02:58:54] what we like to do here sometimes they
[02:58:56] get to play sometimes they don't
[02:58:57] sometimes when they're just standing at
[02:58:59] their tablets all day long they don't
[02:59:01] want to do anything and they don't want
[02:59:02] to listen to Dad over here at all and
[02:59:04] that's why we end up shutting tablets
[02:59:05] off at some points and saying there's no
[02:59:06] tablet time because they always are
[02:59:08] entwined in it and they're ignoring
[02:59:09] everything being
[02:59:12] said
[02:59:15] kids right try to like allow them to do
[02:59:18] some things and then they get so stuck
[02:59:20] on it then you got to take them away for
[02:59:21] an extended period of
[02:59:23] time if that makes any
[02:59:27] sense all right hey you want to go those

[03:23:25] things so if anybody wants to play to
[03:23:27] kind of get them a couple strength as
[03:23:28] they wander through the Wasteland and
[03:23:31] whatever so let's put this one up
[03:23:35] here this is going to get you two
[03:23:37] strength as you wander through the
[03:23:40] Wasteland
[03:23:45] yeah those uh that My Buddy doll that
[03:23:46] was definitely a scary scary
[03:23:50] creature as they wandered through the
[03:23:51] Wasteland there it was uh you got I
[03:23:54] would not want My Buddy doll showing up
[03:23:56] in the Wasteland I'd
[03:23:58] probably I would definitely scream and
[03:24:00] run the other way I sound like a little
[03:24:01] girl probably screaming in the
[03:24:04] process what's up
[03:24:07] Nolan you can have a piece of gum I'm
[03:24:09] okay with
[03:24:10] that
[03:24:12] yeah so just so you guys are aware this
[03:24:14] is my
[03:24:16] uh this is my big box of retro cards
[03:24:19] here there's like 300 random packs of
[03:24:23] cards from the early 90s and late
[03:24:27] 80s right now you get the Fallout pack
[03:24:30] and the Mystery
[03:24:33] booster is what you get both of these
[03:24:36] which would be two strength on the
[03:24:37] adventure through the Wasteland and you
[03:24:39] would get both of those packs you always
[03:24:41] always get those packs you always take
[03:24:44] those home they are yours to take home
[03:24:46] it's just whether or not you get
[03:24:47] something extra when you play the game
[03:24:49] in the Wasteland whether you come out
[03:24:50] with a free pack maybe you come out with
[03:24:52] like a you know a modern Horizon one
[03:24:54] there's in there there's a play boosters
[03:24:56] that are in there maybe you get a set
[03:24:58] booster of like AFR or like
[03:25:01] LCI now if you don't um and you get beat
[03:25:04] by the boss that's where you go to the
[03:25:06] Vault and you find that pack that was in
[03:25:08] the vault in the safe there and maybe
[03:25:10] you're the one that comes out with that
[03:25:12] safe pack that you found that somebody
[03:25:13] thought was worth money before the bombs
[03:25:16] dropped and they had to put it in a safe
[03:25:18] to make sure it stayed
[03:25:20] protected so you get both of these
[03:25:24] packs for uh what's going on there for
[03:25:27] the auction price right
[03:25:29] now if you want to get one pack of
[03:25:31] Fallout you can dry that too they're on
[03:25:33] up there pinned for the individual ones
[03:25:35] there for you guys kind of to see there
[03:25:37] but that's what we are starting our
[03:25:39] strength out with is two for your
[03:25:42] character not bad there and we get to
[03:25:44] you you could play your game what are
[03:25:45] you going to be you going to be maybe a
[03:25:47] mutant wandering through the
[03:25:49] Wasteland I don't know maybe you'll be a
[03:25:52] technician on your trip through the
[03:25:55] Wasteland you know what Fallout I you
[03:25:57] know I will to say being Fallout I
[03:26:01] actually um myself I have jumped
[03:26:06] into magic a lot larger when Lord of the
[03:26:08] Rings came out and it was one of those
[03:26:10] the universe beyond brought me into it
[03:26:12] more cuz I played back in like the '90s
[03:26:14] late ' 90s in like ' 95 to like 99 is
[03:26:17] when I played and I had my card from
[03:26:19] then um but my kids found everything and
[03:26:21] then Lord of the Rings was coming out I
[03:26:22] jumped back into it bigger and that's
[03:26:23] kind of what made me starting doing this
[03:26:25] because they wanted to do more of it and
[03:26:26] then with all the universe beyond stuff
[03:26:28] coming out we actually were kind of
[03:26:29] interested in it because my son was a
[03:26:31] big fan of Doctor Who we used to do
[03:26:33] watch those I've played Fallout since
[03:26:35] the first Fallout game so like that's
[03:26:37] literally the reason why I got like I
[03:26:39] got a bunch of stuff for it I mean here
[03:26:42] ready and that's uh My Bobblehead
[03:26:45] lunchbox from Special Edition from
[03:26:47] Fallout 3 and that one's from Fallout 2
[03:26:50] my uh power armor suit and I have
[03:26:53] something from Fallout
[03:26:55] one I mean from Fallout 4 my power armor
[03:26:58] I have something from Fallout one I just
[03:26:59] can't remember I don't know where I did
[03:27:00] with it I have to find
[03:27:03] that oh yeah you just need the pit boy I
[03:27:05] know a lot of people that's a big one
[03:27:07] people are looking for I've um I
[03:27:09] actually have if you are looking for one
[03:27:10] thing specific speically I don't know
[03:27:12] what ones you're looking for but I think
[03:27:13] that does come out that does come in the
[03:27:16] um Survivor deck I'd have to double
[03:27:18] check but I think it does come in the
[03:27:20] Survivor deck but um and I do have that
[03:27:22] if you want um any of the decks
[03:27:24] specifically I do actually have all four
[03:27:27] of the decks available I just didn't get
[03:27:29] them in the buy uh the shop at the
[03:27:30] moment before starting because I got
[03:27:32] everything in so
[03:27:34] late but yeah you just pick your what
[03:27:37] your character is and you kind of wander
[03:27:38] through the
[03:27:40] Wasteland but bumping into things maybe
[03:27:42] you'll beat them maybe it'll be a
[03:27:44] friend Maybe not maybe it'll be an enemy
[03:27:48] where you're going to get destroyed by
[03:27:50] one of the big bosses at the end and
[03:27:51] burnt to Chris by the
[03:27:55] incinerator I don't
[03:27:57] know but that's our game there and we
[03:28:00] also have as always we have our red
[03:28:02] button we have our mystery packs we have
[03:28:05] our just packs in general that you can

[03:31:03] Pokemon for a long time and they they
[03:31:05] are 10 and eight um and then they found
[03:31:07] the Magik cards and that's why they've
[03:31:08] been doing that we we don't have too
[03:31:09] much I wasn't big into Pokemon much um I
[03:31:12] have I do have the original red and blue
[03:31:15] Pokemon for Game Boy though because I I
[03:31:18] was around when those came out um and I
[03:31:22] actually have those hanging around still
[03:31:23] somewhere I have to go and find them
[03:31:25] because I feel like those probably be
[03:31:26] worth
[03:31:30] something I even have uh I'm pretty sure
[03:31:33] everything's even saved in it and
[03:31:34] everything
[03:31:36] too this one is
[03:31:39] 70
[03:31:53] there you
[03:31:56] go hold on to those for dear life oh
[03:32:00] yeah those uh the the red and blue
[03:32:04] ones yeah I know I have those and I'm
[03:32:06] like I have them in uh some of my game
[03:32:07] stuff and I found them the other day I'm
[03:32:09] like oh my God I can't believe I still
[03:32:10] have these
[03:32:13] but I was looking at him like that's
[03:32:20] insane are they worth a lot I don't even
[03:32:23] know what they would be
[03:32:34] worth
[03:32:39] that
[03:32:41] because I just haven't used them and I
[03:32:43] don't pay any of that authentic on goes
[03:32:46] for like a 100 but Market is riddled
[03:32:48] with Fakes oh interesting yeah no I know
[03:32:51] definitely authentic because I I bought
[03:32:53] them when I was a
[03:32:55] kid I mean I was
[03:32:59] probably freshman in high school or
[03:33:01] something like that when they came
[03:33:04] out I can't remember NE

[03:33:34] go get all those up there priced out and
[03:33:36] I can put them out if anybody wants them
[03:33:38] on the
[03:33:39] uh by now
[03:33:42] too I H sold my silver back in college

[03:33:51] know if I have like I had
[03:33:53] blue I have red blue and I had like a
[03:33:56] couple other ones from when I started
[03:33:58] too so I don't even know if I have I
[03:33:59] have felt like I had like um like two
[03:34:03] other ones that were different colors
[03:34:04] that were right that came out right
[03:34:05] after red and blue but I don't remember
[03:34:08] what they were I just remember
[03:34:10] specifically playing red and

[03:34:46] don't all right I had a gold one I had
[03:34:49] blue red blue and gold and I might have
[03:34:52] had the crystal one
[03:34:55] too I'll have to look for those ones but
[03:34:57] I know I had red and blue I know I
[03:34:58] definitely have red
[03:35:01] blue oh I had ho ho oh yeah yeah yeah
[03:35:03] actually I do I do I think I did have
[03:35:05] that one
[03:35:08] yep I just like I said I never play the
[03:35:10] car game I always I just played those
[03:35:12] when I was growing up a little
[03:35:24] bit we're going to put these up here
[03:35:27] we'll do this is a one and a half
[03:35:28] strength on your adventure through the
[03:35:29] Wasteland remember you can always pick
[03:35:31] just one pack and just do
[03:35:34] it I just throw multiple ones up here in
[03:35:36] case people want more than one strength
[03:35:38] as they wander through the Wasteland
[03:35:39] here
[03:35:47] and has a little side gig yeah yep see
[03:35:49] that's what I do too I collect stuff
[03:35:53] um like a lot of the magic I I the older
[03:35:55] stuff is like I'll play a little bit um
[03:35:58] but I don't play as much with the older
[03:35:59] I'll use like pre-con decks kind of to
[03:36:00] play with the family and have fun with
[03:36:02] but um you know it's it's a lot of it
[03:36:04] kind of nostalgia having fun with like
[03:36:06] the game like this game here like I
[03:36:07] remember playing it when I was in
[03:36:09] literally waited in line for Fallout the
[03:36:11] first Fallout game when I was in Middle
[03:36:14] School and I remember waiting in line
[03:36:15] with friends and I waited too late
[03:36:17] because my mom got mad how late we were
[03:36:19] out waiting for a goddamn video
[03:36:27] game but you know I had fun and now I'm
[03:36:30] looking at I'm got some Fallout stuff
[03:36:31] now we're looking
[03:36:37] at no they never do I'm just waiting for
[03:36:40] the day that my um my children wanted to
[03:36:42] go and do something like that actually
[03:36:44] never that's never going to happen
[03:36:45] because it's all downloaded now they
[03:36:46] don't even [ __ ] go and wait for
[03:36:47] things anymore like that I'm sorry for
[03:36:49] swearing sorry about
[03:36:51] that I mean that was a whole community
[03:36:53] in itself you you know how many people I
[03:36:55] met that played video games from waiting
[03:36:58] in line in my area just because I went
[03:37:00] to wait in line for a game that I wanted
[03:37:02] and then I ended up playing with them
[03:37:03] when they started being know do online
[03:37:05] stuff like just because of that or like
[03:37:07] hey let's go and play and we'll uh we
[03:37:09] I'll meet you online and we'll play this
[03:37:10] when you could only do like kind of like
[03:37:11] land party type things I know like you
[03:37:15] actually met people to play games with
[03:37:18] now I guess now I mean you still now
[03:37:20] it's more like you play games with
[03:37:22] people then you wait decades to meet
[03:37:23] them did you see that video of the dude
[03:37:26] um from England where his wife got his
[03:37:29] buddy that he's been playing he's been
[03:37:30] playing a game with him for six years
[03:37:32] he's never met him in real life and um
[03:37:35] he had his he had his wife like tricked
[03:37:37] him into going to the pub and that guy
[03:37:38] was there waiting for him and they ended
[03:37:39] up you know just two friends that had
[03:37:41] been playing games all the time for
[03:37:43] years like daily but they never actually
[03:37:45] met each other now on the other side of
[03:37:48] it when we were younger you met the
[03:37:50] person to realize you like the game then
[03:37:52] you played it together with
[03:37:55] them things are a little different
[03:37:57] nowadays goes a little in
[03:38:00] Reverse yeah you should check it out it
[03:38:02] was actually really fun like I like you
[03:38:04] could see the guy who walks he's like
[03:38:05] you hear him like the guy goes hey how
[03:38:07] you doing he turns looks at the person
[03:38:09] he's like wait a minute like know your
[03:38:10] voice but I don't know who you are and
[03:38:12] then you then you hear the guy said
[03:38:14] whatever his name was and he goes oh my
[03:38:15] God you see him kind of like they all
[03:38:16] both kind of get a little a little teary
[03:38:18] ey because somebody they had never met
[03:38:20] but they played all the time for six
[03:38:21] years
[03:38:24] together like I had a friend um one of
[03:38:27] my best friends growing up he used he
[03:38:28] plays World of Warcraft where he did and
[03:38:30] uh he used to travel the country uh as a
[03:38:32] truck driver he goes I used to meet so
[03:38:33] many people like I'd be traveling like
[03:38:35] hey I'm going to be in this area and
[03:38:36] then you said you live there and he'd
[03:38:37] beet him and literally sometimes even
[03:38:39] sleep there for like a night or two
[03:38:40] because people like oh yeah you hang out
[03:38:42] and play with games with us all the
[03:38:45] time like just being like the way
[03:38:48] sometimes games can bring people
[03:38:49] together because you don't see what they
[03:38:51] are like you don't know anything other
[03:38:53] than their personality and their
[03:38:55] character and that's one of the cool
[03:38:57] things I will say when it comes to
[03:38:58] meeting people that play games AF you
[03:39:01] don't know what they look like it
[03:39:02] doesn't matter what they look like it
[03:39:04] matters how they're acting how they're
[03:39:07] talking and what they're being like in
[03:39:08] the game with you and generally that
[03:39:09] shows partially their character outside
[03:39:11] of it
[03:39:14] too I mean I obviously if you're like an
[03:39:17] adventure game and you fall out and you
[03:39:18] bu somebody that goes around killing
[03:39:19] everyone you're not going to go around
[03:39:20] killing everyone but you know somebody
[03:39:24] else that does the same thing is
[03:39:25] probably gon to have similar interests
[03:39:26] you know what I
[03:39:29] mean yeah maybe you guys are hunters or
[03:39:31] something like that I don't
[03:39:35] know yeah exactly yeah so you get to
[03:39:37] have fun it's it's a different it's a
[03:39:39] different
[03:39:42] um group but it's not hard to
[03:39:46] become part of it as long as you realize
[03:39:50] that everybody it doesn't really no one
[03:39:51] really cares I quite frankly most of the
[03:39:53] world no one doesn't care anything about
[03:39:55] anyone else they all care about
[03:39:56] character more than anything and there's
[03:39:58] just too many people push out other
[03:40:00] things as being
[03:40:01] problems yeah exactly like you you don't
[03:40:04] care what anybody's like I know how many
[03:40:05] people like I've met that have been like
[03:40:08] completely different than me between
[03:40:10] flying I used to fly drones like I do
[03:40:12] racing drones I don't care what you look
[03:40:14] like we all oh that cool that guys make
[03:40:16] a cool video and then we happen to meet
[03:40:17] talk online that's all we talking then
[03:40:19] we happen to meet at a racing
[03:40:20] competition and we hang out doesn't
[03:40:22] matter if they were Asian they were
[03:40:25] black they were Japanese they were
[03:40:27] Hispanic they were a Caucasian they were
[03:40:29] from South Africa they were from Europe
[03:40:31] they were from the Moon didn't matter
[03:40:33] where they were from they were nice they
[03:40:36] flew drones and they were respectful we
[03:40:39] had a good time it's pretty easy to act
[03:40:41] that way in this
[03:40:44] world here we go I'll put up another one
[03:40:47] here try something a little different
[03:40:48] see if we can maybe get um some of our
[03:40:50] packs of follow open
[03:40:53] here exactly all you're GNA do is be a
[03:40:55] good person for the most part and in
[03:40:58] good things generally I will say
[03:41:00] generally do come um long story short in
[03:41:04] my life I was taught to be you know do
[03:41:06] to others as you want done to you and
[03:41:08] you know do the be be as good as you can
[03:41:10] type thing you know sacrifice sometimes
[03:41:11] for yourself for the good of others and
[03:41:14] um with that being said um long story
[03:41:18] short my family started out and not the
[03:41:19] best of locations and places we were we
[03:41:21] were um at one point in life I my family
[03:41:24] was homeless uh when I was young and I
[03:41:26] didn't realize it we lived we were we
[03:41:27] were homeless for like a few months and
[03:41:29] then we lived in a trailer for a little
[03:41:31] while and I didn't realize that but we
[03:41:33] all worked hard to get to where we are
[03:41:34] in every in your character of what
[03:41:36] people do and the goodness and wasn't
[03:41:37] ever trying to sneak or steal anything
[03:41:40] you just worked hard doing the right
[03:41:41] things then my dad was able to
[03:41:43] eventually afford a house when they when
[03:41:44] I probably was in I was in like late
[03:41:45] High School finally were able to get
[03:41:47] something like that then now they taught
[03:41:49] me that worth e ethic to the point that
[03:41:51] I have my fun things and I'm able to do
[03:41:53] stuff like this with my boys to have fun
[03:41:55] with you guys and it wouldn't have been
[03:41:57] there if it wasn't for just for the most
[03:41:59] part being a good person and doing the
[03:42:01] right things there was so many
[03:42:03] situations where I could have been
[03:42:04] like you know what I could make a
[03:42:06] boatload of money if I just to do
[03:42:08] something a little different right now
[03:42:09] but it wouldn't be morally correct yes
[03:42:12] you maybe may have made like 10 or 20
[03:42:14] grand at that point but great you have
[03:42:18] 10 or 20 grand for like a year I'd
[03:42:20] rather be making you know five grand
[03:42:22] over 20
[03:42:25] years because I'm doing the right thing
[03:42:27] versus onetime
[03:42:29] check but that's the difference between
[03:42:31] some people and others if that makes any
[03:42:33] sense they go for that quick
[03:42:35] win whether morally right or
[03:42:38] not
[03:42:46] exactly doing things the wrong way is
[03:42:47] easy doing it the right way is hard and
[03:42:49] that's one of the things I try to
[03:42:50] explain to my kids all the time it's
[03:42:51] like it may be hard but if you're doing
[03:42:54] it right that mean it is that's why it's
[03:42:57] hard like it yeah yeah doing the right
[03:43:00] thing is hard correct know I I
[03:43:03] uh kids would be out going and playing
[03:43:06] when they were in middle school I was
[03:43:09] studying so that I could get into a high
[03:43:11] school for with a scholarship I got a
[03:43:14] scholarship into a high school then I
[03:43:15] studied and tried hard and I did sport
[03:43:17] so I could get a scholarship to
[03:43:19] college you know that's what it is
[03:43:22] exactly and you're a better person yeah
[03:43:24] you're a better person for IT thank you
[03:43:25] just thank you I appreciate that and
[03:43:28] that's what it is you're you're a better
[03:43:29] person for it because of that and so one
[03:43:31] of those things that people don't
[03:43:32] realize nowadays is that
[03:43:35] yes I can take that right
[03:43:38] now
[03:43:40] but if I help to understand it and help
[03:43:43] that other person that really needs it
[03:43:45] take it get it and then I get it later
[03:43:47] on that person actually needs it is
[03:43:50] going to be beneficial maybe they're
[03:43:51] going to get the food or whatever they
[03:43:52] needed it and you yeah you got food in
[03:43:54] your fridge you don't need it right now
[03:43:55] but at least you can go home and figure
[03:43:58] out how you can have a food full of a
[03:44:00] fridge full of food the next time
[03:44:01] instead because of that work ethic
[03:44:03] versus worrying about not having
[03:44:04] anything because you're just taking and
[03:44:06] you don't know how to make it
[03:44:08] next I weird um um I grew up where my
[03:44:13] dad was a fisherman so he um he had his
[03:44:16] own small business so I had to go down
[03:44:18] at the age of like 10 I was down on the
[03:44:20] boat running wires for him because I was
[03:44:23] small I could fit in the holes it was a
[03:44:25] 42 foot trolling boat and he was a
[03:44:27] fisherman I could fit in the holes and
[03:44:29] run some of the wires that he wasn't
[03:44:30] able to you know that's what that's you
[03:44:32] do you're that at the age of 10 I was
[03:44:36] working with my dad to help him and you
[03:44:39] learn that those things happened and I
[03:44:40] saw everything he grew from having
[03:44:42] nothing to having his own boat
[03:44:45] to he would have went on and done a lot
[03:44:47] better and been a captain of a tugboat
[03:44:49] but long story short he died of an
[03:44:51] aneurism the day before he was supposed
[03:44:52] a tugboat captain but he would have been
[03:44:54] making over 250 Grand a year being a
[03:44:56] tugbo captain but because he busted his
[03:44:59] ass from his a from a young age on fish
[03:45:02] dos to all the way to owning his own
[03:45:03] boat to being a captain to going on to
[03:45:05] that yeah he's been gone for like 20
[03:45:07] years but I I appreciate that I
[03:45:08] appreciate that but yeah like long story
[03:45:11] short he was going to be a tugboat
[03:45:12] captain and he would have been making
[03:45:14] over 250 Grand a year almost 20 years
[03:45:18] ago and that's because he worked hard
[03:45:20] and he taught me to do the same thing
[03:45:22] and if it wasn't for that I wouldn't be
[03:45:23] at the point that I'm in and like our
[03:45:25] house with a pool with a boat that I can
[03:45:27] go to Bahamas with looking for a
[03:45:29] catamaran for my next boat know like
[03:45:31] that's the it's because literally I
[03:45:34] realize that you you have everything
[03:45:36] that you do you got to work for it not
[03:45:38] take
[03:45:38] it
[03:45:42] oh we're bidding on we're bidding on
[03:45:43] these right here the adventure game not
[03:45:45] a problem Justin I so you get both of
[03:45:47] these you get two strength on your
[03:45:49] adventure in the Wasteland
[03:45:51] game so you get both of these packs
[03:45:54] always whatever's in them there's yours
[03:45:55] but what you do after is you play this
[03:45:57] Wasteland Adventure game where each one
[03:45:58] of these here it could be one strength
[03:46:01] or minus one strength so the red green
[03:46:04] and blue could be plus one or minus one
[03:46:06] strength and depending on what happens
[03:46:07] there's 10 bosses at the end and the
[03:46:10] amount of strength that you have you
[03:46:11] could either beat potentially starting
[03:46:13] out with a two the most you could
[03:46:15] potentially beat is Owen Voss Raptor or
[03:46:18] Miry here but if you beat any of those
[03:46:20] you walk away with a free pack of cards
[03:46:23] um they could be a set booster of
[03:46:26] Forgotten rounds a play booster could be
[03:46:28] a homelands but whatever it is it's
[03:46:30] what's shuffled up in here um you just
[03:46:32] pick one of these out and it's a free
[03:46:34] pack of cards that you get out of here
[03:46:35] which just is a card pack written on
[03:46:37] there but if you happen to lose the boss
[03:46:39] you end up getting the pack from the
[03:46:41] vault which is a pack of cards from I
[03:46:44] think it's 91 or 92 but it's just a
[03:46:47] retro pack of something from the early
[03:46:50] 90s that is uh in the vault
[03:46:53] there exactly carrying on my dad's
[03:46:55] Legacy trying to do that
[03:46:58] exactly yeah exactly and you get to play
[03:47:00] in plus all my game it's uh it's 90
[03:47:03] about 90%
[03:47:05] animated so whatever character you
[03:47:07] choose as you go through the Wasteland
[03:47:09] there's animations that go along with it
[03:47:11] and uh kind of what you do there and you
[03:47:13] don't need to um you don't need to get
[03:47:15] what I'm showing I'm just putting random
[03:47:17] stuff on screen you can actually just
[03:47:19] say hey can you um give me that or one
[03:47:21] pack or whatever it is and play it's up
[03:47:23] to
[03:47:25] you but I just I've just been putting
[03:47:27] Fallout because we haven't opened any of
[03:47:28] the Fallout collector boosters yet and
[03:47:30] I'm a big Fallout collector boot fan
[03:47:32] yeah and I want to open some of the
[03:47:34] collector boosters that's why I'm just
[03:47:35] keep throwing that up but you guys can
[03:47:36] pick whatever ones you want you don't
[03:47:38] need me to keep picking them for
[03:47:42] you so like that would be like one and a
[03:47:44] half strength as You Adventure through
[03:47:45] the
[03:47:48] Wasteland and then do
[03:47:51] that hold on a
[03:47:54] second they are they are I haven't even
[03:47:57] had a chance to open one myself I've
[03:47:58] watched others opening them and I I've
[03:48:01] just been really jealous because I have
[03:48:02] not even had a chance to open one myself
[03:48:04] yet I have our box here that we're going
[03:48:06] to open up today and we're going to do a
[03:48:08] we'll do a video we'll be on YouTube
[03:48:09] hopefully tomorrow or the next day but
[03:48:12] um uh we'll have a so that's what we
[03:48:15] plan on doing there with one of our
[03:48:17] packs with one of our boxes that we're
[03:48:19] going to get in six more today but
[03:48:21] um we have two of them here now to see
[03:48:24] if you guys want any but this what we'll
[03:48:26] get here you'll get this Fallout and
[03:48:28] this Murders At Carlo this is going to
[03:48:30] be one and a half strength for your
[03:48:31] character as you travel through the
[03:48:33] Wasteland and then you uh get to see
[03:48:36] what happens maybe you come out with
[03:48:37] some luck maybe uh maybe you beat the
[03:48:39] boss maybe the boss beats you but either
[03:48:40] way you always get a pack of something
[03:48:43] maybe it's just a pack of cards from uh
[03:48:45] the early 90s maybe it's a maybe it's
[03:48:47] another magic card
[03:48:50] pack but yeah that's what we've been
[03:48:52] playing for our games here sometimes
[03:48:53] people jump in or not
[03:48:58] but oh wow that's crazy yeah I have um I
[03:49:02] have a distri oh I have a resale license
[03:49:04] and so I I go through a distributor but
[03:49:07] I actually here I'm going to let you
[03:49:10] know this is what happened for me uh
[03:49:12] Justin I
[03:49:14] ordered yeah that's the only reason why
[03:49:16] I I a dist I can get it through there
[03:49:18] because the resale license so I ordered
[03:49:23] um 20 boxes no 20 I ordered four
[03:49:29] cases I got two boxes from
[03:49:33] them I ended up having the only the only
[03:49:35] reason I'm getting six other ones is I
[03:49:36] had to order them um at a higher price
[03:49:40] from
[03:49:46] overseas master case is greater than Bo
[03:49:48] two boxes
[03:49:51] now I know I know I had I was getting uh
[03:49:54] yeah I know I was going to get 12 yeah
[03:49:57] exactly two two I know a master case of
[03:50:01] two yeah exactly yes I went from a
[03:50:03] master case to two yep I was like you
[03:50:06] got to be [ __ ]
[03:50:07] me like really guys like I have so many
[03:50:11] people that want I had like um like I've
[03:50:13] been streaming for a few months now and
[03:50:15] if you check me out on YouTube you can
[03:50:16] see me streaming all the time but like I
[03:50:19] had a I like I had a bunch of people
[03:50:21] that want them and I just I was not able
[03:50:23] to get what I wanted and I was like you
[03:50:25] got to be kidding me and I end up having
[03:50:26] to buy them at higher price this is why
[03:50:28] they're higher than they I wanted to be
[03:50:30] if I had been able to get them at the
[03:50:31] price I wanted them which I was able to
[03:50:33] get all of them at the price I was
[03:50:34] supposed to get him through at the
[03:50:35] distributor the packs would probably
[03:50:37] only have been like $33 a pack at the
[03:50:39] most I'm like are you [ __ ] kidding me
[03:50:42] dude seriously like I can't even get
[03:50:44] those I got one and then I have to go
[03:50:45] through all the other ones this is
[03:50:49] insane it's just crazy crazy but I guess
[03:50:53] um when I talked to the distributor they
[03:50:54] were like yeah so I um I guess
[03:50:57] Wizards suspected that this was going to
[03:50:59] go like um Doctor Who which didn't I
[03:51:02] guess didn't sell as well as they wanted
[03:51:05] um but what I tried to say was like I
[03:51:07] you know I said to him like the distri
[03:51:09] guy like well I don't know why they
[03:51:10] would think that I unless they're doing
[03:51:12] something specifically like Doctor Who
[03:51:14] then you open the collector booster I
[03:51:16] mean Commander decks and I'm like well
[03:51:17] they're very similar to Doctor Who now I
[03:51:19] understand why they maybe have cut the
[03:51:21] print run then then like so I just don't
[03:51:23] like but the thing is though they have
[03:51:26] special cards that are in The Collector
[03:51:28] boxes that you can't get in the
[03:51:30] commander
[03:51:32] decks which is why we needed a ton of
[03:51:34] them everybody would want them but no no
[03:51:37] they didn't do it
[03:51:41] oh no they did not take that into
[03:51:43] account The Fallout fans being rap dude
[03:51:44] I was saying that earlier you weren't
[03:51:46] you weren't on earlier but I was I was
[03:51:48] uh like I was like just 13 I think 13
[03:51:51] maybe 12 or 13 when when uh fallout the
[03:51:54] first one came out I remember
[03:51:56] specifically waiting in line for that
[03:51:58] game and every single one of the
[03:52:00] fallouts since then I had waited in line
[03:52:02] for even Fallout 76 I got the heart like
[03:52:04] the disc and I waited in line for that
[03:52:06] one that's why I got all these here
[03:52:09] that's why like I have even like that's
[03:52:11] I got that My Bobblehead from three my
[03:52:13] uh my power armor suit over there in the
[03:52:20] back see I've been playing for a long
[03:52:23] time but like I was already upset too I
[03:52:24] was like you got the thing is though
[03:52:26] there's some of the people that I know
[03:52:27] that are into Fallout and they were like
[03:52:29] oh I really really want this and then
[03:52:31] when they triy to get them they they
[03:52:33] didn't because they they couldn't find
[03:52:35] anything available anywhere and I
[03:52:36] actually have there were like three or
[03:52:39] four people that I know that really
[03:52:40] wanted to buy stuff from from me and
[03:52:41] were like you know what I don't even
[03:52:42] know why I want to get much of it
[03:52:43] anymore because of what they did with
[03:52:45] this I can't even get what I want I
[03:52:47] wanted to get like two boxes of
[03:52:49] collector boxes and maybe maybe uh one
[03:52:52] of the decks but I can't even do that
[03:52:54] I'm lucky if I can get a pack or two and
[03:52:56] that's what I think turned a lot of
[03:52:58] people off from this that we've been
[03:52:59] running into is that people are
[03:53:00] frustrated that they're expensive and
[03:53:03] that they can't get the amount that they
[03:53:04] want or they can't get what they want
[03:53:07] like I know myself I was really
[03:53:09] frustrated too because I the amount that
[03:53:11] I ordered I was going to put a a box off
[03:53:13] to the side for my family just to save
[03:53:16] for forever because I'm a big Fallout
[03:53:18] fan I was gonna open a box for my family
[03:53:20] then I was GNA open a box for the show
[03:53:22] for um to like sell and then I was going
[03:53:25] to sell off the rest of them I I can't
[03:53:26] even do that
[03:53:33] now let's
[03:53:35] uh what I think I only have a couple of
[03:53:38] these left I have to make an adjustment
[03:53:40] there to some of that
[03:53:46] there I didn't put XEL
[03:53:55] on I didn't put them in there all right
[03:53:57] that's good
[03:54:04] then I'll put this up here
[03:54:07] for
[03:54:14] always one collector and one standard
[03:54:16] type pack for the oh no I I'm just
[03:54:17] randomly put them up you can do up to
[03:54:20] three packs if you want I've just been
[03:54:23] putting one and that um you can
[03:54:25] literally pick whatever you want on the
[03:54:26] side there we've had people pick like
[03:54:29] one war the spark booster that's fine if
[03:54:33] you just want to start out at half a
[03:54:34] strength or if you want to get say you
[03:54:36] want to get three packs of something you
[03:54:37] can start out at like one and a half
[03:54:39] strength or maybe you want to get three
[03:54:40] collector boosters and you can start out
[03:54:42] at three strength it's uh whatever you
[03:54:45] would like there to add it up there we I
[03:54:46] don't mind if you get anything from like
[03:54:48] three packs or up to three strength to
[03:54:50] start the game so whatever up to three
[03:54:52] strength when we start the game I'm good
[03:54:54] with every now and again I might throw
[03:54:56] where you get might get four strength if
[03:54:57] you start because maybe I'll throw in a
[03:54:59] different pack or I'll feel like it
[03:55:01] costs a lot and I'll say you know what
[03:55:02] that's four strength or like if people
[03:55:04] buy Commander Masters those are worth
[03:55:06] two strength per uh Commander master
[03:55:10] pack and you can actually get Lord of
[03:55:12] the Rings original and those are worth
[03:55:14] one and a half strength per uh per pack
[03:55:17] so you can actually get a little bit
[03:55:18] more but it's actually it's really build
[03:55:20] your own I just putting these up here
[03:55:22] because it's just I'm picking random
[03:55:24] stuff out to put up it's it's whatever
[03:55:26] you would like to do you don't even need
[03:55:27] to fall L ring special

[04:02:05] were an expensive item to be hiding back
[04:02:08] in the 50s there for their
[04:02:11] Wasteland wait why why dashy I'm sorry
[04:02:14] we got a bunch that's why like said it's
[04:02:16] a random packs from like the
[04:02:19] 90s 80s late 80s and early
[04:02:22] 90s you always get something from the
[04:02:24] Vault but I can't guarantee it's
[04:02:26] something great but you can always get
[04:02:27] yourself something of a pack that they
[04:02:29] thought was in
[04:02:30] there no problem bud we had some fun
[04:02:33] with that so let's uh we'll rip these
[04:02:35] babies open here we'll leave our trolls
[04:02:37] for the end because we know that's our
[04:02:39] best bet our best bet of hitting
[04:02:40] something big right
[04:02:43] [Music]
[04:02:45] there all right sounds like a plan all
[04:02:48] right I'm gonna Open Up Our Lord of the
[04:02:49] Rings here and let's see what we get for
[04:02:52] you with our Lord of the Rings we're
[04:02:53] gonna get you uh a nice uh let's get you
[04:02:55] a nice poster all
[04:02:57] right maybe maybe my first serialized I
[04:03:00] have yet to get a serialize out of this
[04:03:04] yet all right let's go merkwood bats
[04:03:08] dund Dame blade Prince Emerald the fair
[04:03:11] gron the gate breaker lth lauran Lookout
[04:03:14] Rush the room foray Of Orcs miror of
[04:03:20] gadriel mountain surge foil oh nice
[04:03:24] delighted halfling that's a nice little
[04:03:25] hit there oh sarumon the white hand
[04:03:28] that's another nice little hit there oh
[04:03:31] Gad light of
[04:03:33] valanor there you go sweet hit so
[04:03:37] far shagat Loop be surge
[04:03:40] foil call forth to Tempest Serge
[04:03:44] foil nice hit again there and a Souls
[04:03:48] attendant foil I have enough Souls
[04:03:50] attendant I could start fires for a
[04:03:53] decade but anyways there you go nice
[04:03:55] surge foil token but those nice cards
[04:03:59] there those are some nice
[04:04:01] hits that was definitely a good pack now
[04:04:03] Justin I do this for shipping purposes
[04:04:07] hopefully you're okay with I go like
[04:04:08] this and I put them back to back the
[04:04:11] reason for that is is if I do this and I
[04:04:13] do put them in here and then I put them
[04:04:14] in a top loader they do not fall out of
[04:04:18] the top loader when you get them
[04:04:19] shipping they don't slide out are you
[04:04:21] okay with me doing
[04:04:23] that okay all right Justin I just want
[04:04:25] to make sure yeah so like I do that
[04:04:27] because one of the things that I noticed
[04:04:29] is that when I got them in their an
[04:04:30] individual card in a Toploader I've got
[04:04:32] them before and they're like kind
[04:04:33] Sometimes they come in and they're like
[04:04:34] hanging out of the the top loader a
[04:04:36] little bit so if I put two of them in I
[04:04:38] found out when I put two of them in you
[04:04:41] do this and they don't come out look at
[04:04:45] that exactly
[04:04:49] exactly like some people I've had I had
[04:04:52] one person complaining about me doing it
[04:04:53] one time like dude you want your cards
[04:04:54] sliding out and getting bent or do you
[04:04:56] want them to stay like stiff and in in
[04:04:59] good
[04:05:01] condition so there you go gladel nice
[04:05:04] gladel light of valanor all right now
[04:05:06] we're going to we have a still a collect
[04:05:08] booster and we have some trolls even
[04:05:09] still here oh my God look at
[04:05:16] that here we
[04:05:19] go
[04:05:22] nice there we are all
[04:05:26] right the tougher to pull out of
[04:05:28] Toploader yeah yeah exactly you don't
[04:05:30] want them falling out exactly perfect
[04:05:32] they're top to pull out so they don't
[04:05:33] fall out I like this nice it shows you
[04:05:36] kind of like little little things on
[04:05:38] there too cool all right this is
[04:05:39] literally my first collector booster
[04:05:41] pack so I might be going a little slow
[04:05:42] here staring at these

[04:06:18] that everything is rare yes a lot of

[04:37:42] out of them but if you put one of them
[04:37:43] in at a time sometimes they do slide
[04:37:46] out and during shipping so I like to
[04:37:49] make sure they don't slide during
[04:37:50] shipping that's why you do the
[04:37:53] two but we've been having a we getting

[04:44:07] and an eight-year-old you going to do
[04:44:09] stuff with them in the evening and at
[04:44:10] night so I luckily get to do stuff

[04:44:29] until like my son has a game today so we
[04:44:31] have to leave out we have to head out
[04:44:33] like in about 10 minutes or so I'll
[04:44:34] start packing up to head out so that we
[04:44:36] can get out for his game um you know

[04:44:45] come out with a free pack maybe you'll
[04:44:47] uh maybe you'll end up coming out with
[04:44:49] the Vault pack we've s we've we've had
[04:44:51] some pretty interesting Vault packs
[04:44:53] coming
[04:44:55] out so our game here though allows you
[04:44:58] to come out with a free pack if you beat
[04:45:01] the boss at the end or uh which could be
[04:45:03] anything that could be like a murderers
[04:45:05] maybe a dungeon dragon like an
[04:45:08] Adventures forgotten realm maybe it's a
[04:45:09] modern Horizon 1 but what it is is just
[04:45:12] these cards that we Shuffle up and they
[04:45:13] get all deck packs that are written on
[04:45:15] them but if you happen to get beaten by
[04:45:17] the boss you get this pack of cards from
[04:45:20] 1994 we don't know what it is but is a a
[04:45:23] little retro pack of cards from back in
[04:45:25] the day when you were either a child or
[04:45:28] from before you were born we're not
[04:45:30] really sure it depends on your
[04:45:33] age but you get a little game here and
[04:45:35] you wander through you get this will
[04:45:37] start you off with one and a half shrink

[04:45:51] the adventure game for those that want
[04:45:52] to go and we uh it's all all animated
[04:45:55] too the only thing that I don't have
[04:45:57] animated is um I think it's the last
[04:46:00] blue box here and there's a couple of
[04:46:02] them out of here I don't think I have
[04:46:03] all of the people animated yet so I have
[04:46:06] almost everything done because I have
[04:46:09] about 30 things that are animated for
[04:46:11] your characters as they wander through
[04:46:12] the Wasteland

[04:46:18] almost five
[04:46:24] hours here you go put that one back

[04:47:02] you one and a half strength as you
[04:47:03] travel through the Wasteland on your
[04:47:05] adventure all right now what you want to
[04:47:07] do here is you need to decide uh there's

[04:47:12] green each and then in the blue there is
[04:47:14] 12 you can either tell me where to go or
[04:47:16] I can do random and you get
[04:47:19] one um pull from each one of those boxes
[04:47:22] to see how much strength you could
[04:47:23] potentially get to see if you could
[04:47:25] potentially beat the boss at the
[04:47:27] end hey Gabriel how you doing
[04:47:33] today

[04:47:37] one pull from each of these one pull
[04:47:40] from each of the
[04:47:44] boxes so you get a pull from Red you get
[04:47:46] a pull from Green and then you get a
[04:47:47] pull from

[04:48:03] character as you wander through the
[04:48:05] Wasteland here you get to choose right
[04:48:07] here your characters are those right
[04:48:09] here if you need me to I can move them
[04:48:11] and expand it um yes Justus I you pick a
[04:48:14] character first I'm not going to flip
[04:48:16] anything over yet I'm not flipping
[04:48:18] anything over yet that's why I was just
[04:48:19] getting them out I didn't want to flip
[04:48:20] anything over I was just getting their
[04:48:22] cards out but make sure you pick your
[04:48:24] character Travis for your adventure
[04:48:25] through the Wasteland one two 3 four
[04:48:28] five 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
[04:48:33] 13
[04:48:34] all right so you're going to be a mutant
[04:48:37] all right Travis is going to be a mutant
[04:48:39] as he travels through this Wasteland
[04:48:42] here you're being a mutant you're
[04:48:43] traveling through the Wasteland Travis
[04:48:45] as a mutant you're wandering you're
[04:48:47] looking for food Travis because food
[04:48:50] makes a mutant stronger they need to be
[04:48:52] big and strong to make their way through
[04:48:54] the Wasteland so they wander through
[04:48:56] this Wasteland and they stumble across
[04:48:58] of food wonderful they go and they eat
[04:49:01] that food they don't care how many RADS
[04:49:03] it has they're a mutant they get nice
[04:49:05] and strong wonderful you go from one and
[04:49:08] a half to two and a half strength on
[04:49:11] your adventure through the Wasteland
[04:49:14] here now you're wandering through and
[04:49:16] you're feeling nice and strong wandering
[04:49:17] through the Wasteland going you know I
[04:49:18] think I can handle anything maybe I'll
[04:49:20] bump into a friend an enemy I don't know
[04:49:22] but I'll take care of it no matter what
[04:49:24] and then you flip this over and oh no
[04:49:27] you see an enemy a soldier comes running
[04:49:29] in the distance as you're chomping on
[04:49:30] your food and oh no he swings this swort
[04:49:33] of you drop your
[04:49:36] food where's your enemy oh I don't have
[04:49:38] the enemy one one here that's one of the
[04:49:40] ones I was missing you drop the food and
[04:49:42] you go running away but that's okay it
[04:49:45] leaves you
[04:49:48] with where the friend I thought I had
[04:49:50] enemy on there no uh and then you leaves
[04:49:52] you with one and a half strength as you
[04:49:55] wander through the Wasteland
[04:49:57] here now you have 12 potential ones you
[04:50:00] can get here it's up to you which one
[04:50:03] you want to go
[04:50:06] with number 11 1 2 3 4 five 6 7 8 9 10
[04:50:13] and
[04:50:15] 11 so here you are looking for the
[04:50:18] fungus dinosaur the fungus dinosaur is
[04:50:21] what helps the mutant as he wanders
[04:50:23] through the Wasteland you're wandering
[04:50:24] through and you come across a detective
[04:50:27] Oh
[04:50:28] no you're wandering and you bump into a
[04:50:32] detective in the Wasteland and this is
[04:50:34] not good that's not going to help you
[04:50:35] the detective points you in the wrong
[04:50:37] direction he goes hey buddy you should
[04:50:39] take that right and go around the
[04:50:40] building there and you go around that
[04:50:42] building to the right and you get you
[04:50:44] end up bumping
[04:50:53] in oh sorry I was just about to
[04:50:59] stee you start bumping into some water
[04:51:02] and you don't know what to do and you
[04:51:03] start getting scared and you go on your
[04:51:05] way and you end up having only half a
[04:51:07] strength though as you wander through
[04:51:09] this
[04:51:10] Wasteland let's see what happens though
[04:51:13] maybe you're going to get a boss there
[04:51:14] are 10 bosses you're not going to really
[04:51:15] have a chance to beat one though but
[04:51:17] maybe you will find one that doesn't
[04:51:19] give you a big beat down let's see which
[04:51:20] one you want to go with our friend
[04:51:25] Travis number three one two and three
[04:51:29] you're wandering through the Wasteland
[04:51:31] stumbling through you're barely able to
[04:51:33] stand cuz you're C from being in the
[04:51:35] water all barely stren have any strength
[04:51:38] and you see something in the distance go
[04:51:39] I think this is something I can beat I'm
[04:51:41] going to go up to it I'm going to take
[04:51:42] it on and oh no the T-Rex comes around
[04:51:46] the
[04:51:48] corner they grab you by the leg throwing
[04:51:51] you around luckily they do not kill you
[04:51:55] you're able to drop down they only take
[04:51:57] away part of your toes wandering away
[04:51:59] with a couple of
[04:52:01] them but you're still alive you and you
[04:52:04] find a vault and you go into that Vault
[04:52:05] and you go I'm finally somewhere to rest
[04:52:08] and you see a safe in the vault you go
[04:52:10] hey what's that over there there's
[04:52:11] something glowing in that safe something
[04:52:13] a little shiny you open that safe you
[04:52:15] finish opening the safe and you see that
[04:52:16] shiny thing and for some reason a person
[04:52:19] thought they needed to put a Maverick
[04:52:21] the
[04:52:22] movie they thought it was going to be a
[04:52:24] really expensive cards game in in the
[04:52:27] future so they put that in the safe for
[04:52:30] you to pick up from
[04:52:32] 1994
[04:52:36] that's that's our little Adventure game
[04:52:38] that you have there sometimes you're
[04:52:40] lucky maybe you can beat the beat bosses
[04:52:42] and uh what we do is we Shuffle these up
[04:52:44] and they have anything from like set
[04:52:46] boosters play boosters I think there
[04:52:48] mystery booster there homand I think
[04:52:50] there's an EMA mixed in there so but you
[04:52:53] you got beat by the boss and that's okay
[04:52:55] when you stumble in there you get that

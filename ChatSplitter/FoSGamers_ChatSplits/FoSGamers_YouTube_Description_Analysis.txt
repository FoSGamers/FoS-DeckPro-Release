I need you to generate me a better description for FOS gamers based on learning what you can about what we do and what we are. Also have sorcery as one of the highlights right behind Magic the Gathering as the primary one. And just make sure that is in there definitely as a description highlight. And then have my link tree in there correctly and stuff like that so that people can access me right at the top so people know how to get me easily and those types of things.

Found that we're trying, one of the things that we're trying to do in regards to the FPS gamers is the plan of the business specifically. They don't need to know it, but I want to be like a virtual game store where we can work and build games, do games. I can work online together, hang out online together during the streams. We can play games using Discord, Spell Table, Tabletop Simulator, and anything else that we may want to be using. And we can have pretty much a virtual version of a game store where I'm at the counter, they come in talking and hang out, buy something. The only difference is I open it up online and ship it to them. Or if they do buy it from the store, it can be shipped to them too, depending on when they buy it, if it's turning it live or when I'm not online. And they buy it and they just want to ship themselves in and out. So kind of like just literally a virtual, like a game store, like a local game store like you would have, but virtually done. It's focused on things that I talked about. Make sure D&D is in there because we do like doing that, so we hope we have one of those going soon, one of the D&D games going soon. The game with the Fallout campaign that I built. So let's see what you can do here. Now whenever you do this, make sure it is a copyable format. Like if it was code, I press a button and it copies everything. And make sure there are no asterisks in the description since it does not translate to a copy of it ever.

Search the Internet and figure out that the link tree should be near the top. That way they can find me easier to click on to access my information.

[2024-09-16 12:31:17] ChatGPT:
To ensure your **LinkTree** is easy for viewers to find and interact with, best practices suggest placing it at the very top of your **YouTube** video description, within the first few lines. This makes it highly visible, as YouTube only displays the first few lines before cutting off the text under the "SHOW MORE" button. By placing your **LinkTree** here, it increases the chances of immediate engagement and makes it easier for viewers to click through without having to search through the description. 

Additionally, YouTube’s algorithm also prioritizes information above the fold (the first few sentences), so having a direct call-to-action linking to your **LinkTree** in this section is important for both discoverability and user engagement【22†source】【24†source】.

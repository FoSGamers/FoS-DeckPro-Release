[02:30:19] trustworthy and I'm going to do
[02:30:20] everything right how much for the foil
[02:30:23] for the foil of it uh yeah hold on it
[02:30:27] was I think it
[02:30:34] was I think it was seven or 10 I can't
[02:30:38] remember I have to re have to look and
[02:30:41] trying to find it it was seven or
[02:30:44] 10 I think have to double
[02:30:53] check sorry trying to remember off the
[02:30:55] top of my head
[02:30:57] there I have a few more singles than I
[02:30:59] was expecting
[02:31:02] recently I never actually had singles on
[02:31:05] a regular basis until people kept asking
[02:31:07] I was like you know what fine I I'll go
[02:31:08] and find
[02:31:13] some I ended up going through all my
[02:31:15] stuff to find them
[02:31:19] 10 and this is the um 184 where the
[02:31:22] other one's 185 so it's a little bit of
[02:31:24] a different like style of them that's
[02:31:28] why they're
[02:31:29] different uh the style it's um the 184
[02:31:33] is the just the more expensive one with
[02:31:35] the with the art on it and this is the
[02:31:36] foil version of it um I think this one
[02:31:40] this Sonic Screwdriver 184
[02:31:42] 185 I don't think that's I don't think
[02:31:44] that's much there I think that might be
[02:31:46] $2 maybe let me double check on
[02:31:50] it because I I wasn't planning on
[02:31:52] getting rid of that one right away but I
[02:31:54] can I don't mind doing it give me a
[02:31:56] second
[02:32:04] here yeah
[02:32:09] 185 yeah 185 is $2 for the 185 one and
[02:32:15] the reason why this one is 10 is just
[02:32:17] because it's literally the foil
[02:32:21] version um of it that's literally the
[02:32:24] reason why it's the foil version of it
[02:32:25] and that's why it's 10 but this one's $2
[02:32:28] if you want
[02:32:40] it for um for for this two for
[02:32:44] this oh and then you want the other one

[04:14:27] sometimes it is they're almost like
[04:14:28] they're like from older like you don't
[04:14:30] know what they are like everything they
[04:14:31] have to take a minute to read it like
[04:14:33] that's what I mean the Arness the
[04:14:34] omnipotent I had to take a second like
[04:14:35] oh interesting I like that
[04:14:38] just so you guys know I do have um raid
[04:14:42] I mean uh raid giveaways and also
[04:14:46] um buyer giveaways that I have set
[04:14:49] up uh I set them up last night I
[04:14:52] actually did 50 of them because I'm only
[04:14:54] going to do one buyer giveaway at the
[04:14:55] end of the stream I'm only going to run
[04:14:57] it for like probably 15 20 seconds so if
[04:15:00] you're in here hanging out make sure you
[04:15:02] jump in but the reason why I did that is
[04:15:04] because I don't want everybody entering
[04:15:06] in the Stream entering in them so I
[04:15:07] figured if there's 150 it's going to be
[04:15:09] kind of hard for somebody to go and
[04:15:11] enter in to uh all of those for the
[04:15:14] buyers give for the buyer giveaways and
[04:15:16] then also if I run it for like 10
[04:15:18] seconds it's going to be hard for those
[04:15:19] to enter it also so that's the way that
[04:15:22] I was doing that for everybody for the
[04:15:24] buyers so we can get the buyers just uh
[04:15:26] something today all right thanks he

[04:34:21] allowed
[04:34:22] to there you go you can moderate I think
[04:34:26] this means that you get a little mod
[04:34:28] title and if you are are talking and
[04:34:31] there's anything else going on you can

[05:11:30] doll Squadron I have two cyber
[05:11:32] conversions one's a surge foil one's a
[05:11:34] regular
[05:11:35] foil I couldn't I don't remember I I
[05:11:38] thought I had a n miso Tyrant but I must
[05:11:40] have sold that one so that's a misot
[05:11:42] tyrant foil um showcase skullport Nexus
[05:11:47] foil skull for Nexus uh you know regular
[05:11:51] one and a Cyberman

[05:12:56] single
[05:12:58] 14
[05:13:00] really it dro
[05:13:02] then the foil version wasn't but um
[05:13:05] maybe that's what the difference
[05:13:11] is let me
[05:13:19] see yeah the foil is $4 well I mean it's
[05:13:23] on there for $5 I have it it's the foil
[05:13:26] version that's why I don't know if I
[05:13:28] have the regular version
[05:13:30] though

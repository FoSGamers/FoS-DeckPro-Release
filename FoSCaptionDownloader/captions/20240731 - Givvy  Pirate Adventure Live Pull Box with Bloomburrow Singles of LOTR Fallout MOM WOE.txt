[00:04:06] I was thinking to call them my repacks
[00:04:09] from us that's what I was thinking
[00:04:11] because we
[00:04:12] have it set up like
[00:04:18] this so you want some
[00:04:21] sorceries from

[00:04:37] like
[00:04:45] this and hopefully you guys I mean
[00:04:47] nobody wanted to jump in and play any of
[00:04:48] the game that's why it's in the buy now
[00:04:50] if you want to you can so this is what
[00:04:52] we kind of got going on so I
[00:04:53] have like AAR there plus I know people

[00:05:02] sorceries
[00:05:05] from bloom all right so it's a little
[00:05:09] repack
[00:05:11] card PMA then plus this rare
[00:05:15] here this is what we were

[00:05:41] wasn't even me they saw they were saw
[00:05:43] something and my kids came up with it
[00:05:44] thought it was a good idea yeah it works

[00:05:55] tried it

[00:53:33] games but we're gonna see what we get
[00:53:35] out of this Bloom bro here and then

[00:53:56] there
[00:53:57] let's see what we get for luck and now
[00:54:01] nice thing is look at this you got a new
[00:54:03] sword the game here to play with nice
[00:54:05] bigger broadsword that you got than
[00:54:07] before so you have an option what would
[00:54:09] you like to do here is uh would you like
[00:54:12] to
[00:54:15] um kids would you like to
[00:54:19] uh keep all of your stuff that you have
[00:54:24] which currently you have for your
[00:54:28] inventory one two three four five this
[00:54:32] person's at your boat so they don't
[00:54:33] count they're just a friend at your boat
[00:54:34] hanging out so you get five out of the
[00:54:36] 10 Things I mean it's a good idea to
[00:54:37] keep them you have your friend to fight
[00:54:39] with your new big broadsword your little
[00:54:42] rapee type sword you got a shield and
[00:54:44] another Shield
[00:54:46] there it's up to you if you're G to keep
[00:54:49] them
[00:54:50] all but it is five things and you have a
[00:54:54] couple of cof coffee so it's up to you
[00:54:57] which sword is better well I guess
[00:54:59] they're kind of more for different
[00:55:00] situations this one's like a broadsword
[00:55:02] you know thicker sword for more maybe
[00:55:04] chopping through stuff with the other
[00:55:06] ones more uh Rapier more like for
[00:55:08] stabbing stab stabbers and you got your
[00:55:11] shield shield this Shield I don't know
[00:55:13] yet this Shield's a little newer so you
[00:55:15] know that's the nice thing about that
[00:55:16] one you have a a nice Shield that's a
[00:55:18] little stronger but this one's
[00:55:21] bigger so it's up to you if you want to
[00:55:23] you which one you if you want to keep
[00:55:24] them R use them but d what I need to

[00:56:55] didn't use the uh my sleeping medicine I
[00:56:58] not using it so I'm not sleeping as well
[00:57:01] the guy the new doctor thinks it's
[00:57:05] um he he thinks he knows better than the
[00:57:09] neurologist that prescribed it that's a
[00:57:11] sleep that was a sleep professional

[00:57:26] actually maybe cuz they're holding it
[00:57:28] there he might be able to dual wield but

[01:29:30] do now my friend you gonna go in he's
[01:29:33] coming towards you he hits you because
[01:29:35] he got you off guard so you go from your
[01:29:37] 150 Health down to 142 health so not a
[01:29:41] big hit because you had you're a little
[01:29:44] you're you're not bad horrible there
[01:29:46] let's see what do you want to
[01:29:50] do have our cards here to find out what
[01:29:52] we're doing we have our
[01:29:56] and to call on your friend going to let
[01:29:57] it
[01:29:59] occur oh the giveaway in the back is not
[01:30:01] running dang it I'm sorry let me get
[01:30:04] that going and then if you want to
[01:30:07] participate in the adventure yourself
[01:30:08] you
[01:30:10] can swing for the body I like it we
[01:30:13] swing for that body with your
[01:30:22] sword nice swing on its body that's a
[01:30:25] nice big broadsword hit you hit it nice
[01:30:29] and tough hit and that brings it down
[01:30:30] from 51 Health down to 48 health I mean
[01:30:34] a 28 health I'm sorry that was 28 Health
[01:30:37] 48 Health 28 Health that was a good hit
[01:30:41] but that scores you with its
[01:30:44] Tusk that b gors you with inside with
[01:30:47] its Tusk bring you one from 142 down to
[01:30:50] 122 Health that wasn't a good one you
[01:30:52] get a nice gash on your
[01:30:54] side what would you like to do
[01:30:58] now your Shield didn't work that time
[01:31:01] because you were in the middle of
[01:31:02] swinging it was like a like a defensive
[01:31:04] thing that they got back at you
[01:31:12] with then let's see what goes on
[01:31:17] further our game
[01:31:25] I'll put these all together actually let
[01:31:27] me put all your stuff together
[01:31:30] here well we're
[01:31:33] waiting get all your stuff together that
[01:31:35] makes sense that's a smart thing to
[01:31:39] do you g to run all right I like the
[01:31:42] idea you turn around and you
[01:31:44] run you flee from that boar that boar
[01:31:47] comes charging towards you but you're an
[01:31:49] agile pirate you're able to run around
[01:31:52] sneak around you hide some places you
[01:31:54] get away and finally the
[01:31:56] boar runs away and you get away from
[01:32:00] them safely that was a good idea run
[01:32:03] away from that
[01:32:04] bore but you are on the other side of
[01:32:06] the bridge still not exactly sure though
[01:32:10] right now because you did go running
[01:32:11] crazily around the island you're not
[01:32:13] exactly sure where you are on the island
[01:32:14] at the moment so you're a little bit
[01:32:17] lost in this island but you know
[01:32:21] what maybe uh I don't know maybe he'll
[01:32:23] bump into something here again in the
[01:32:25] future we'll have to find
[01:32:27] out let me get you written
[01:32:30] down your name d for everything here D

[01:33:01] know old stuff would be found well these
[01:33:04] battle cards were kind of fun to use and
[01:33:06] I built them into using them this way so
[01:33:07] we could play in with h with what we're
[01:33:08] doing and just a little intriguing

[01:38:57] going to go for the head here let's see
[01:38:59] where is head
[01:39:07] head well look at that you got one look
[01:39:10] at that one you got him in the head he
[01:39:12] took his head swung right out of his
[01:39:14] head now the head intriguingly goes
[01:39:18] rolling off to the ground but he still
[01:39:21] continues to swing at you he's a
[01:39:23] skeleton man what do you think was going
[01:39:25] to happen he still got more parts to
[01:39:28] attack but this is another 60 creature
[01:39:30] but his head did come off knocking him
[01:39:32] down to 42 health because that was a big
[01:39:34] hit that was a big hit
[01:39:41] there swinging his leg
[01:39:44] now going swing in his leg he is swung
[01:39:47] at you though with his head off and he's
[01:39:49] got a good hit though he's got a 100 you
[01:39:52] weren't from that to 100 and one that
[01:39:54] was a 10 hit you swing for the leg this
[01:39:58] time where is the leg there's the
[01:40:04] leg you swing for the leg and oh my
[01:40:07] you've got a hit on that leg look at
[01:40:09] that there's the leg there you hit the
[01:40:10] leg of
[01:40:13] this creature
[01:40:18] and they lob off of one of its legs now
[01:40:21] it's rolling around with no head and no
[01:40:23] leg
[01:40:24] but it is still attacking you it
[01:40:26] attacked you still you did not decide
[01:40:28] you wanted to try to use your Shield I
[01:40:30] don't know why but you bring that
[01:40:33] creature down to 20
[01:40:35] health and they hit you though bring you
[01:40:37] down to
[01:40:38] 92 not a big hit but enough because they
[01:40:41] are they're out off balance and
[01:40:45] everything sometimes is wi is it mutes
[01:40:47] weird things I
[01:40:50] know Shield bash to his ch yes o I like
[01:40:54] it you use your
[01:40:57] Shield this time and you go towards the
[01:41:01] body with your Shield I like

[01:41:38] down so you miss on The Bash and they
[01:41:43] hit you
[01:41:44] though as they fall over because you
[01:41:46] know they only have one leg there

[01:41:49] you down to 80 Health what are you going
[01:41:51] to do my friend
[01:41:55] Shield bash towards the leg all right
[01:41:57] Shield bash towards the
[01:42:08] leg these ones are harder to scratch for
[01:42:10] some reason Shield bash the leg oh you
[01:42:12] hit you hit the other leg falls falls
[01:42:15] off the creature falls to the ground
[01:42:18] with only three Health

[02:10:49] come you summon your helper
[02:10:52] it takes some time for them to get there
[02:10:54] luckily with him on the ground the
[02:10:55] summoning of that helper was kind of
[02:10:58] like a free one when you buy on the

[02:11:01] you have the helper attack let's see
[02:11:03] what happens with your helper
[02:11:06] attacking the helper swings at the arm

[02:42:56] good hit on that one they swing at you

[02:43:34] out on that I do appreciate
[02:43:36] it and I'm going to end up
[02:43:40] um it determines the giveaway
[02:43:44] yes swinging his head I like it you
[02:43:48] swinging his head your Strangler has to
[02:43:50] see if they're still able to hold him
[02:43:52] down so let's see if their Strangler can
[02:43:53] still hold him down so your Strangler is
[02:43:56] trying to keep holding him down oh
[02:43:58] no this turn the
[02:44:00] Strangler was unsuccessful in holding
[02:44:03] them down look a little red there you're
[02:44:06] unsuccessful so he gets up and you do
[02:44:09] not
[02:44:11] have them holding him down so their
[02:44:13] ability is they can dodge you but you
[02:44:16] swing for the head
[02:44:30] and oh
[02:44:32] my you
[02:44:34] missed you missed oh
[02:44:38] my now luckily you do have your Shield
[02:44:42] that you had in your hand let's see if
[02:44:43] your Shield helps at all with any of
[02:44:45] your any your protection
[02:45:02] ah look The Shield does protect you a
[02:45:05] little bit so instead of getting a giant
[02:45:07] hit from them because you completely
[02:45:09] missed and whiffed you only got a hit uh
[02:45:12] down from
[02:45:13] 135 down to
[02:45:17] 121 but they missed all of them and
[02:45:19] they're getting up they're getting back
[02:45:20] to get on their horse ah you let them
[02:45:23] get it back on their horse between the
[02:45:25] misses of your friend and you what are
[02:45:28] you gonna do now are you gonna let him
[02:45:30] run away or are you gonna chase him
[02:45:34] down seems like he's getting scared and
[02:45:36] he's getting ready to run
[02:45:38] away get the Strangler try to grab him
[02:45:41] again and pull him down chase them all
[02:45:43] right you chase
[02:45:44] them you have you have the Strangler try
[02:45:47] to grab them again that's probably a
[02:45:48] good idea
[02:45:52] and we're going to go here and put out
[02:45:54] our game this is for you guys if you
[02:45:56] want to play you see what you get there
[02:45:58] all right Jason the Strangler tries to
[02:46:02] grab your
[02:46:04] creature let's
[02:46:09] see look at that the Strangler does is
[02:46:13] lucky the Strangler grabs holds on to
[02:46:18] them pulling off of their horse again to
[02:46:21] the
[02:46:23] ground
[02:46:25] now you go up to them and you slice and
[02:46:28] dice away what are you going towards
[02:46:31] what do you want to try to hit now the
[02:46:33] stranglers grabbed them and pull them
[02:46:35] down thank you for helping explain that
[02:46:37] Oblivion I wish my notes could be bigger
[02:46:40] or like click on or something like that
[02:46:43] you swing for the
[02:46:46] head all right let's go for or the
[02:46:53] head oh my dude I'm sorry you got some
[02:46:58] unluckiness here you miss but the
[02:47:00] Strangler still has them on the ground
[02:47:02] they swing wildly at you hitting you
[02:47:05] though with a a little bit of a gash
[02:47:07] trying to break free and they break free
[02:47:10] from the Strangler but they do hit you
[02:47:12] from 121 you go down to 115
[02:47:19] what are you GNA do
[02:47:22] now hey Death guy how's it going hope
[02:47:26] you're having a good
[02:47:27] one you get the choice of probably I
[02:47:30] think you your Strangler can try to grab
[02:47:31] them again while they try to get away
[02:47:34] because they're scared of you right now
[02:47:36] or you can try to run and slash it again
[02:47:38] or maybe you want to try to do a a
[02:47:40] shield bash or something like that swing
[02:47:42] for the body all right let's swing for
[02:47:44] the body
[02:47:49] holy crap dude you swing for the body
[02:47:52] and you miss again they swing and they
[02:47:55] hit
[02:47:56] you as they run away to jump on their
[02:47:59] horse for a third for a second time and
[02:48:01] they gash you but you only go down to
[02:48:03] 110 because it's a gash as they run
[02:48:06] away as they flee they get back on their
[02:48:08] sword they start to run away again are
[02:48:11] you GNA let them flee this time or do
[02:48:13] you want to have your Strangler try to
[02:48:15] grab him
[02:48:23] Strangler the Strangler goes up to them

[03:01:36] desert island though because there's so
[03:01:37] many creatures and strangers in way now

[03:07:03] out probably going to be one of the ones
[03:07:04] that we just pulled out now D you won
[03:07:07] the giveaway so we're g to keep having
[03:07:09] fun here going on with our encounter now
[03:07:14] you encounter that friend they told you
[03:07:16] here to go out to the side they said
[03:07:18] there's some things around
[03:07:20] here so you go
[03:07:23] wandering and
[03:07:36] then you find something in the distance
[03:08:02] sorry I didn't not I didn't have these
[03:08:05] ones pre-made because we're not going
[03:08:06] with the original part of the adventure
[03:08:08] because when we do the giby we do a
[03:08:09] little different diversion of the
[03:08:11] adventure because I have to have to had
[03:08:13] one prey made I had already pre-made the
[03:08:15] rest of it so with that being said we're
[03:08:18] going to have a little diversion here
[03:08:20] because you're going around your map get
[03:08:23] a little confused because there's some
[03:08:25] different directions it tells you to go
[03:08:26] around one Dune tells you to go around a
[03:08:27] different Dune your encounter your queen
[03:08:29] said it's a good idea to take it and go
[03:08:31] to the left there it's a better idea to
[03:08:33] go off to the left instead so you decide
[03:08:37] to go on your island adventure and you
[03:08:39] take a little left follow the Queen's
[03:08:41] advice you direct yourself that
[03:08:44] way and in front of you you see
[03:08:48] something show
[03:08:55] up why is it taking so long for that to
[03:09:07] work sorry give me one second here it is
[03:09:11] not my pictures is not coming out right
[03:09:14] now it's being really
[03:09:16] slow everything's slow for me at the
[03:09:18] moment I don't know why it's actually
[03:09:20] really ticking me off we have very fast
[03:09:22] internet but it seems to be extremely
[03:09:24] slow regularly I think I just need to
[03:09:26] maybe restart my computer or
[03:09:30] something you
[03:09:33] see this intriguing
[03:09:35] thing that you run
[03:09:45] into I just need to do this
[03:09:52] this there we go you
[03:09:57] encounter this
[03:09:59] pool
[03:10:02] of being guarded by some lizards here
[03:10:06] what are you gonna
[03:10:08] do yeah I reset it I it resets all the
[03:10:11] time regularly so but I'm probably going
[03:10:13] have to reset the modem and everything
[03:10:14] because people have been [ __ ] around
[03:10:15] with the internet around this area
[03:10:17] putting new and stuff in and out so I'm
[03:10:18] guessing that might be part of it what
[03:10:20] do you want to do here in this little
[03:10:22] Oasis being uh guarded by some lizards I
[03:10:25] don't know we're not
[03:10:32] sure D it's up to you what we're going
[03:10:34] to do right
[03:10:36] now think we maybe uh we going to go for
[03:10:39] a little
[03:10:41] swim they are not acting feral they're
[03:10:43] they're just kind of there guarding it
[03:10:45] making I don't know maybe making sure
[03:10:46] nothing's going wrong making sure you're
[03:10:48] being good you're not ruining anything
[03:10:50] not going and pissing in the pool type
[03:10:52] of thing you know you are a pirate
[03:10:54] you're known to do some good things
[03:10:55] you're a good pirate but you are a
[03:10:56] pirate so you do some bad things too you
[03:10:58] know you are an idiot
[03:11:00] sometimes you know then they're just
[03:11:02] making sure everything's going
[03:11:05] good trying to sell you some insurance

[03:18:42] higher here so it wasn't as long on my
[03:18:44] sideburns then it looked like I had a
[03:18:45] bow cut from the '90s and I didn't like
[03:18:47] it so I shaved a little bit more around
[03:18:49] the ear to make it better then it looked

[03:19:10] not great because I did it I haven't
[03:19:13] done it in like 15 20 years but it's

[03:19:55] point
[03:19:57] here all right you give it to your
[03:19:59] desert Nomad they take a look at the
[03:20:02] map and who won the
[03:20:05] giveaway that
[03:20:07] God I need you to type SLG for me if you
[03:20:10] haven't already oh you did got thank you
[03:20:13] cards oh you got a Marinette Apprentice
[03:20:15] not one of the biggest but a little
[03:20:17] something I need you to give me a number
[03:20:19] between 1 and 10 though that
[03:20:24] God nine I like it all right number nine

[03:20:30] of
[03:20:32] these see we added that in there
[03:20:41] before there we go that one will go in
[03:20:43] there number nine from our stuff here
[03:20:46] here I like it going to shake oh shake
[03:20:50] that up now remember everybody as we get
[03:20:52] through the game the deals actually for
[03:20:54] the game in the boxes end up getting
[03:20:55] ridiculously better to the point that
[03:20:57] when the last box which is 16 you're
[03:21:00] going to end up having a uh a bunch of
[03:21:02] pretty much collector boosters one two
[03:21:04] three that are being given away for way
[03:21:07] below what they cost but it's only up to
[03:21:09] you guys and if we get to that point so
[03:21:13] but our friend D here is definitely got
[03:21:16] a little Adventure here now you talk to
[03:21:20] them they're looking at the map and they
[03:21:23] go hey you know what that area that he's
[03:21:26] pointing you towards over there it does
[03:21:29] uh bring you around a nice area off to
[03:21:31] your off to your right if you're going
[03:21:33] from the north coming down the island
[03:21:35] here but um you do have to watch out for
[03:21:38] some creatures now the harder way to the
[03:21:41] left I mean the harder the way to the
[03:21:43] right you're gonna have a problem when
[03:21:45] you go south from north to south that
[03:21:48] that's harder to travel over but you
[03:21:51] have less
[03:21:52] encounters so you have to decide which
[03:21:54] way you want to go do you want to go
[03:21:55] left which brings you on a longer route
[03:21:58] which may have more encounters or do you
[03:22:00] want to go right to the shorter route
[03:22:02] that's going to be rougher and have less
[03:22:04] encounters not a bad idea talking to
[03:22:06] your friend
[03:22:08] there I like it that was a good idea
[03:22:12] instead of attacking see sometimes you
[03:22:14] can you can uh talk to them instead of
[03:22:16] attacking in the
[03:22:17] encounter Rough Side all right you go
[03:22:20] hey buddy you take that you take that b
[03:22:21] map back he hands it back to you back to
[03:22:23] you goes hey oh hopefully good luck you
[03:22:26] find what you come looking
[03:22:28] for well you I'm a pirate dude I'm
[03:22:31] looking for Treasure he goes oh well uh
[03:22:34] I don't know if that M bring you to
[03:22:35] treasure but there's definitely
[03:22:36] something over there there's some fun
[03:22:39] stuff over there I don't know I don't
[03:22:40] know what there's been around there
[03:22:41] before but you got you can head that way
[03:22:44] so you start one in through your Island

[03:41:56] your trip and you see what you encounter
[03:41:59] in front of you now what you have right
[03:42:02] now is a big broadsword that you have to
[03:42:04] use two hands for you've got a friend
[03:42:06] that's called The Bone scratcher that
[03:42:07] can come and help you you've got a
[03:42:08] shield that you have that you can use
[03:42:11] this is a a schar that you found that is

[03:42:15] magical because it's only got a little
[03:42:17] little bit of stuff left there there's
[03:42:19] another one of your friends that is
[03:42:20] called a Strangler that comes and will
[03:42:22] help you you have a short
[03:42:25] broadsword and you have a basic shield
[03:42:28] and then you have a Rapier sword so

[03:42:35] going to press forward all right we

[03:42:55] poool you found something that may be a
[03:42:59] problem there's no way around
[03:43:02] it you have a
[03:43:04] choice do you go forward and
[03:43:08] attack the quicksand
[03:43:11] monster or do you flee and turn around
[03:43:14] and go another way way and take the long
[03:43:18] route now you can call on some friends
[03:43:21] remember you have the Strangler and the
[03:43:23] bone scratcher you have the bone
[03:43:26] scratcher you can call on and the
[03:43:28] Strangler but you can only have so many
[03:43:30] uses of them because once they're use up
[03:43:33] you have no more of them to
[03:43:37] use and all of your weapons that you've
[03:43:40] had
[03:43:43] here let's see how the bone the Strang
[03:43:46] the
[03:43:47] bones so bone scratcher and the
[03:43:50] Strangler both of them you're going to
[03:43:51] try to

[03:44:17] that sand monster and your Strangler go
[03:44:21] at it for a little bit they're both
[03:44:24] fighting and what happens is the sand
[03:44:28] monster has a good grip and starts
[03:44:30] pulling the Strangler down but the
[03:44:32] Strangler has a grip right around its
[03:44:34] neck what are you going to do
[03:44:37] yourself as the pirate standing there

[03:45:21] you use your Broad
[03:45:24] Sword I'm guessing you're using the
[03:45:26] two-handed
[03:45:27] broadsword your big one here so you take
[03:45:31] your broadsword
[03:45:33] out and you go for the

[04:27:56] that you might have some problems with
[04:27:57] as you were told by your friend The
[04:28:00] Mummy instead of encountering attacking
[04:28:02] you decide to talk which is pretty smart
[04:28:04] Sometimes using those
[04:28:06] options then you continue on your
[04:28:10] quest around the
[04:28:15] Island now as you continue along the way
[04:28:18] remember you do have that puppy friend

[04:38:43] you going to do are you going to flee or
[04:38:46] are you going to attack now the way you
[04:38:49] can attack is we have these cars here
[04:38:51] from an old old game from the 90s by the
[04:38:54] way they have scratch offs on them
[04:38:56] that's the fun part about them I like
[04:38:58] using them you have the swords here you
[04:38:59] have a a Rapier a little sharp sword a
[04:39:02] two-handed
[04:39:03] broadsword you have a shield this is a
[04:39:06] friend called a bone scratcher you have
[04:39:09] a a like a little broadword that that's
[04:39:11] one-handed one this is a schear that you
[04:39:13] found that's a kind of mystical because
[04:39:15] you own was already you own used most of
[04:39:17] it give your Shield another shield and
[04:39:20] your Strangler
[04:39:22] friend so you can decide what you're
[04:39:25] going to do you can run you can call on
[04:39:27] your friends to come and help you can
[04:39:30] use a weapon and
[04:39:32] attack or a shield and
[04:39:39] defend that's how we were playing our
[04:39:41] game card number five one
[04:39:43] two so you're no you just pick you just
[04:39:46] use whichever one you want but if you
[04:39:47] want the
[04:39:48] shield shield you're going to attack
[04:39:50] with the shield use the shield for
[04:39:52] attacking and holding them back I like
[04:39:54] it so you use the shield attack to hold
[04:39:57] them
[04:39:58] back that mummy comes toward
[04:40:00] you and do you want to push on it push
[04:40:04] away from
[04:40:05] it towards the body a certain part of
[04:40:08] it head a for head
[04:40:13] body arm or leg those are your options I
[04:40:17] think yep those are the options that you
[04:40:21] have Ram his legs I like it Ram towards
[04:40:25] his
[04:40:26] legs let's see leg right
[04:40:39] here to scratch off and see what Happ
[04:40:41] happens there you go nice you don't hate
[04:40:44] the red see if you get the uh the red
[04:40:46] blood one that's the bad luck one you
[04:40:48] didn't though you hit him you knock him
[04:40:51] back which is good knocking The Mummy
[04:40:54] back that mummy is not a tler on my
[04:40:56] mummy it's only 30 Health you're able to
[04:40:59] push him back but with pushing him back
[04:41:01] you do happen to step on one of his
[04:41:03] little wraps he starts thr Ravel a
[04:41:05] little
[04:41:06] bit and he goes down
[04:41:09] to 19 health
[04:41:13] what do you want to do now my friend
[04:41:15] because he swings at
[04:41:17] you as he's unraveling twisting and he
[04:41:20] luckily hits you with a just a weird hit
[04:41:23] but it only brings you down to
[04:41:25] 173 Health from
[04:41:28] 180 your choice what do you want to do
[04:41:31] against
[04:41:32] this mummy we have in front of us
[04:41:58] it's up to you remember the options we
[04:41:59] have our uh sword shield call on a
[04:42:04] friend Captain America style throw the
[04:42:07] shield you know what I like it Captain
[04:42:09] America style you take your Shield you
[04:42:11] know what I think um I think the round
[04:42:13] Shield you're probably going to have to
[04:42:14] grab off your back might be a better one
[04:42:16] maybe instead of the other one that's
[04:42:18] like this one or do you want to throw or
[04:42:20] you want which one you want to throw I
[04:42:22] think we should go with the round one
[04:42:23] probably let's do the round one okay
[04:42:25] we're GNA go with the round one you
[04:42:27] throw the shield what part of the body
[04:42:29] you throwing it
[04:42:30] at you the head the legs the
[04:42:34] arm or the
[04:42:37] body round one at this
[04:42:39] head you go towards ahe
[04:42:45] and we like
[04:42:47] it beautiful there's a hit on the
[04:42:52] head knocking that mummy gets knocked
[04:42:55] over your Shield is off the side you

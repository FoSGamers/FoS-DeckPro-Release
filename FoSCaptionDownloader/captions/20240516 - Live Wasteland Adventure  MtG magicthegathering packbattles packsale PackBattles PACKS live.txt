[00:17:29] engineer currently on two State

[00:17:34] understand that I actually had a I had
[00:17:36] an offer at one point to go to New York
[00:17:39] and uh this is many many years ago to do
[00:17:42] some stuff to install things and I would
[00:17:43] have made a lot of money but I it would
[00:17:47] have been like going away from my family
[00:17:48] and I don't know if I really wanted to
[00:17:49] take the time away and do that it would
[00:17:52] have been installing um like security I
[00:17:55] think it was uh facial recognition
[00:17:57] systems throughout the city
[00:18:00] at least that's what they told me they
[00:18:01] wanted me to do we'll just leave it at
[00:18:07] that that was back in like 2012 by the
[00:18:10] way just so you're
[00:18:14] aware back in 2012 they were doing that
[00:18:34] oh yeah dude that's part of the to thing
[00:18:36] too was I would have been down in the
[00:18:37] city I would have been like one of the
[00:18:38] places they were having me go was like a
[00:18:41] Subway to go and look at everything I'm
[00:18:43] like what I the install stuff there like
[00:18:46] I don't know if I want to be doing that
[00:18:48] like like all like Grand Central like
[00:18:50] there was like I was all kinds of places
[00:18:51] that they were listing that were like
[00:18:52] big places I'm like I don't know if I
[00:18:54] want to tolerate or handle that or work
[00:18:56] on that there that seems like a headache
[00:19:08] or if it wasn't a headache it seemed
[00:19:10] like it was one of those things that I
[00:19:11] was like I don't
[00:19:12] know I don't want to be dealing in the
[00:19:14] city like that and having like people
[00:19:16] watching me around installing things
[00:19:19] whatever it is and then the next thing
[00:19:20] you know I'm being robbed or attacked
[00:19:22] because I have a bunch of [ __ ] that some

[00:21:28] wonderful morning
[00:21:30] itchy and I know I can read you guys'
[00:21:32] names but I always forget what they are
[00:21:34] and it's easier for me to see the screen
[00:21:36] names hopefully you're not offended by
[00:21:39] that not trying to be rude just
[00:21:43] uh sometimes it's just easier to read it
[00:21:47] that
[00:21:56] way hey you're welcome bud
[00:21:59] you're welcome Hey I that's what I like
[00:22:01] about those things so see the coolest
[00:22:03] thing about the games where we do those
[00:22:04] where we have those um the adventure
[00:22:06] game like that is I do it because I grew
[00:22:09] up and I got those things myself and I
[00:22:12] remember getting them as a kid and I was
[00:22:14] like you know what this is the perfect
[00:22:16] example perfect uh situation for me to
[00:22:19] use that cuz see people would hold
[00:22:21] things from old things people hold old
[00:22:23] things and they put them back you know
[00:22:25] they put them in a vault to save or
[00:22:27] whatever you know what I mean so like it
[00:22:29] was cool for me because I was able to
[00:22:31] get some things and throw them in all
[00:22:34] different kinds of stuff like I'm I'm
[00:22:35] just grabbing different things out of
[00:22:37] here that we have like this is the
[00:22:39] different stuff that we have in here
[00:22:41] Randomness spread out through it now I
[00:22:44] don't I don't know what's in the packs
[00:22:45] right now cuz the kids have been
[00:22:46] building oh I have to add I have to
[00:22:47] build a couple more of those like this
[00:22:50] is these are all just packs I found
[00:22:52] under a dollar anything from like some
[00:22:54] weird comic book stuff to they were they
[00:22:58] were like these are all from like '90s
[00:23:00] the '90s I remember opening these when I
[00:23:01] was a kid somewhere I think I was at
[00:23:02] school where I got a pack of this this
[00:23:04] was silly ones that came with a bunch of
[00:23:06] other stuff but I remember Dick Tracy
[00:23:08] myself I don't remember these
[00:23:10] specifically but I do remember the cars
[00:23:12] I remember Demolition Man I remember
[00:23:15] these gen his book of records I remember
[00:23:17] reading that these were like random ones
[00:23:18] and I remember being part seeing this
[00:23:20] stuff all going on and then there's some
[00:23:22] random like baseball stuff in there it's
[00:23:24] all just because I found them they're
[00:23:25] all like under a dollar just kind of
[00:23:27] like full cool things to put
[00:23:29] in hey you have a good day my friend F
[00:23:33] PHA have a good day my friend Phila nice
[00:23:37] thank you for talks popping in and
[00:23:38] whenever you get a chance just follow us
[00:23:40] on YouTube hang out whenever you want do
[00:23:42] appreciate
[00:23:47] it let me open that back up and I'm just
[00:23:50] kind of going through my stuff
[00:23:52] there yeah it's just we had a bunch of
[00:23:54] old random things there was like n
[00:23:57] probably almost 100 different packs of
[00:23:59] cards like whether they were TV shows or
[00:24:03] games or baseball cards that I had
[00:24:06] different ones and I had about probably
[00:24:07] 500 of them and I probably about half of
[00:24:09] them left because it's been a little
[00:24:11] slower on what people have been wanting
[00:24:12] for the games and stuff
[00:24:38] yeah my dad was in Aerospace so always
[00:24:41] had the war cards yes exactly I I
[00:24:44] remember having um GI Joe ones I got
[00:24:46] from like a cousin like no it was an
[00:24:48] aunt she lived in Florida and she worked
[00:24:50] at some I can't remember she worked at
[00:24:52] but whenever like once every few two or
[00:24:54] three Christmases she would send up a
[00:24:57] box and when I talk about a box I mean
[00:25:06] like it would be like something like
[00:25:08] this and this would be considered small
[00:25:11] it would be like three times the size of
[00:25:12] this box like one of those one of those
[00:25:16] ones that you have to like carry two
[00:25:18] hands guaranteed and it would be filled
[00:25:20] with baseball cards and stuff like that
[00:25:22] and she'd be colle and what she did was
[00:25:25] I guess there she worked at a
[00:25:26] convenience store and whenever the
[00:25:28] venience store got rid of all of them
[00:25:30] she was like can I just buy them really
[00:25:32] cheap and they let her buy them Dirt
[00:25:33] Cheap just for like pretty much to get
[00:25:35] rid of them so they get their money back
[00:25:37] and she would put them into a box and
[00:25:40] once the box was filled she sent them to
[00:25:42] us and I didn't realize that until I was
[00:25:44] older and I was like an older like I was
[00:25:45] probably in my my teens and I was like
[00:25:47] that was awesome like that was one of
[00:25:49] the coolest things ever that's why like
[00:25:50] I try to do myself when I can you know
[00:25:53] have the fun things to hang out with you
[00:25:55] know I don't know it's just one of those
[00:25:56] scenarios I was in when I was younger
[00:25:58] yeah exactly so I was like one of those
[00:26:00] things like she was generous like that
[00:26:02] so I try to be and show some generosity
[00:26:05] like I had a lot of people that were
[00:26:06] good around me in my life taught me a
[00:26:08] lot of things on how to be a good person
[00:26:10] and what type of person to
[00:26:12] be um so yeah let's try the secret lair
[00:26:16] pole box we're going to do this secret
[00:26:19] lir pole box that is a really good deal
[00:26:22] right
[00:26:25] there I probably shouldn't do 881 I'm
[00:26:28] going to knock that down to
[00:26:31] five Sony's going to buy my whole box
[00:26:34] get all the secret lirer get the secret
[00:26:37] ler thing in there
[00:26:40] for make their money back do just some
[00:26:43] red
[00:26:48] buttons so I figured whenever I can I
[00:26:50] try to have some cool packs like that
[00:26:52] little memorabilia
[00:26:57] stuff it's not even that I use it much
[00:26:59] you
[00:27:00] know I don't really use it for the most
[00:27:05] part I don't even know half of them I
[00:27:07] haven't even

[00:32:50] the pogman battle
[00:32:54] is it's a little game where you got to
[00:32:56] go up against some bosses
[00:32:58] and see if you're able to win to battle

[01:26:24] in there but that's my bad oh and the
[01:26:28] mystery bags or the mystery bags here
[01:26:32] are that the mystery bags if you press
[01:26:35] on the uh help little circle with the
[01:26:37] question mark on your screen it'll give
[01:26:39] you a help icon the help which tells you
[01:26:41] what's in the mystery bags exactly too
[01:26:43] so you can even see that you never have
[01:26:45] to worry about not seeing it which I
[01:26:47] really like about this one of my
[01:26:50] favorite things about uh drip here is
[01:26:52] that freaking last questions I never
[01:26:54] need to worry about it I always just put
[01:26:55] my games in there and then anybody has a
[01:26:58] question you can literally go and read
[01:26:59] it and it's it's awesome because it
[01:27:01] explains it very I use I spent a decent
[01:27:02] amount of time making sure it was
[01:27:03] explained well or tried to make sure it
[01:27:06] was explained well let's say that we'll
[01:27:07] say
[01:27:15] that we'll see if you guys want to
[01:27:17] participate in any other games we did
[01:27:18] the mystery one a little while ago our
[01:27:20] Carnival one and we had some fun with
[01:27:22] that
[01:27:26] did not have a buyer win but it was a
[01:27:29] close one it was a close one between the
[01:27:31] buyer and the uh it was I think it was
[01:27:33] One Mono a I think between the buyer and
[01:27:36] the um the
[01:27:44] father fre last questions you should see
[01:27:47] next to chat there should be a little
[01:27:48] circle with a question mark or um it
[01:27:52] should be up in like the top left corner
[01:27:54] corner or top right corner somewhere on
[01:27:55] your screen it's a little it looks a
[01:27:57] circle with a question mark exactly
[01:27:59] that'll pull up all the fre last
[01:28:00] questions explaining all the games and
[01:28:01] things that I got going
[01:28:04] on yeah yeah it's pretty
[01:28:06] cool I like that I like that aspect of
[01:28:09] this it helps out because if you even if
[01:28:10] you turn the screen to the side too you
[01:28:12] can get it because if you turn your
[01:28:14] screen sideways you get the bigger
[01:28:15] screen which I like even better here it
[01:28:18] has like a giant screen you can see I
[01:28:19] think that's awesome
[01:28:24] nice big one turn your phone sideways
[01:28:27] you don't need to deal with like partial
[01:28:28] screen you get the whole
[01:28:34] thing he took the midnight train going
[01:28:42] anywhere all righty
[01:28:59] I see it in the smokey
[01:29:13] room right
[01:29:16] Dangerous
[01:29:17] [Music]
[01:29:19] Dan up and down the
[01:29:25] [Music]
[01:29:31] street
[01:29:32] lights
[01:29:37] people yeah it's pretty cool with the F
[01:29:39] with the uh with the with the frequently
[01:29:41] ask questions there I actually one of my
[01:29:42] favorite parts of
[01:29:44] this my favorite thing is this
[01:30:06] It Go on more
[01:30:09] time yeah so it makes it nice and easy
[01:30:11] for you to see
[01:30:21] everything let's see if I have any more
[01:30:23] over here I don't think I

[01:40:11] had a couple of them spread out in here
[01:40:13] and uh somebody's looking for a bunch
[01:40:15] of Fallout cards so I'm trying to help
[01:40:18] them find
[01:40:21] them here we go I thought I had a few of
[01:40:24] them mixed
[01:40:28] in thought I had a few of them mixed in
[01:40:34] here now if you want anything here south
[01:40:36] do let me
[01:40:39] know if you see anything you like
[01:40:42] here I'll look at the chat in one second
[01:40:44] here once I kind of finish going
[01:40:47] through
[01:40:49] that red button red button if you go and
[01:40:51] you look at the um the frequency last
[01:40:53] questions it will tell you but the red
[01:40:55] button is where you have the uh
[01:40:57] potential of winning yourself this box
[01:41:01] right here that you see oh it froze hold
[01:41:04] on let me fix that camera there where
[01:41:07] the red button is I got to fix the
[01:41:08] camera where the red button it
[01:41:10] froze I don't know
[01:41:14] why let me fix that camera sorry about
[01:41:18] that I don't know why the camera
[01:41:21] froze nothing was taken from it anyway
[01:41:23] so it's just still there all the same no
[01:41:25] one touch the red buttons or anything
[01:41:27] but the red buttons are those over there
[01:41:29] and if you look at that little um Circle
[01:41:31] icon it's like a little circle with a
[01:41:33] question mark in it you should see it
[01:41:34] somewhere on your screen that will tell
[01:41:36] you exactly what
[01:41:40] uh exactly
[01:41:44] what is
[01:41:46] available in the red
[01:41:50] buttons there we go so there that's the
[01:41:53] red buttons
[01:41:56] there and it comes
[01:41:58] with I'm getting to the frequ ask
[01:42:00] questions
[01:42:02] myself there's a bunch of them in there
[01:42:04] so it's was, 1600 cards it's down a lot
[01:42:06] now but it's anywhere between 10 cents
[01:42:07] to $150 for the cards bunch of packs
[01:42:10] that are mixed in there plus the big one
[01:42:11] is the Lord of the Rings collector
[01:42:12] booster block that's really what it is
[01:42:15] um the thing was that people had
[01:42:16] requested to having a big hit and I'm
[01:42:19] like I don't have a big card for a big
[01:42:20] hit and they're like well throw a box
[01:42:21] out there I'm like well I don't know if
[01:42:22] I want to do that that like I don't like
[01:42:24] doing big hit things and because no one
[01:42:25] ever Buys in when they do that like well
[01:42:27] do a low price one like then that means
[01:42:29] I have to do like low price cards in it
[01:42:31] and like yeah just do it so I put one of
[01:42:32] them together and it's been sitting then
[01:42:34] that's what we have that's why we do
[01:42:35] that see if you guys get any luck on
[01:42:38] that one try it
[01:42:40] out the whole point was I was figuring
[01:42:43] it would be like hey add some red
[01:42:44] buttons to my order to see if I have the
[01:42:45] chance of winning that box where some
[01:42:48] people are like give me 20 red buttons
[01:42:49] I'm like dude
[01:42:52] seriously that wasn't the intent but if
[01:42:54] you want
[01:42:59] it thought I had a couple more somewhere
[01:43:02] spread
[01:43:06] out so that's what the red button
[01:43:10] is ah do you guys hear me sorry the
[01:43:12] insta camera took over when iwi switch
[01:43:14] switched it hope you were able to hear
[01:43:15] me the red button is
[01:43:21] um the
[01:43:23] it was ,600 cards between $10 I mean 10
[01:43:26] cents and
[01:43:28] $150 where there's a bunch of packs that
[01:43:30] were mixed in to it and um plus the high
[01:43:33] was that Lord of the Rings collector
[01:43:34] booster box if you were lucky enough to
[01:43:36] get the whole
[01:43:37] box that's what's in that in itself
[01:43:41] that's a good a big one there that I
[01:43:42] actually didn't really request I didn't
[01:43:44] want to do it but I had people request
[01:43:46] me to do it so I was like all right if
[01:43:47] you really want it I'll do something
[01:43:49] like that and they said they really
[01:43:51] wanted it so I did it
[01:43:54] really what boils down
[01:43:59] to but if you like to you can always
[01:44:01] jump in yourself and participate in
[01:44:04] it because it is a fun one to add in a
[01:44:08] little order to see if you get
[01:44:09] potentially get something we have people
[01:44:11] coming out with packs regularly so it
[01:44:13] does have a lot of good stuff in there
[01:44:15] and I if I feel bad like people have
[01:44:17] been pulling things and nothing's come
[01:44:18] out I add stuff every now and again so I
[01:44:20] don't even know exactly what's in there
[01:44:21] cuz I've added stuff to it over
[01:44:24] times mystery bag and the red buttons
[01:44:27] all right so you get those mystery bags
[01:44:29] right there
[01:44:32] now in the mystery bags you should be
[01:44:35] able to see right here you get to pick
[01:44:37] one of these there's uh 60 some on or 80
[01:44:41] some on of them left I think I have to
[01:44:44] go double check that and then the 10 red
[01:44:46] buttons like I said there's somewhere
[01:44:48] near 1 12200 in there I think so where
[01:44:50] would we like to go mono King on the
[01:44:53] mystery bag and the red buttons and if
[01:44:55] you happen to get a floor you get one of
[01:44:57] these DC things with any with the um
[01:44:59] with the complete floor which is lost C
[01:45:01] Exon if you get a lost C Exon you do get
[01:45:03] one of those DC packs
[01:45:07] there and if you want to count a number
[01:45:10] I go like this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 like
[01:45:13] kind of like count like that if you want
[01:45:14] to count a number out on any of the
[01:45:16] bags then I come back here and I do the
[01:45:19] same thing just go in the opposite
[01:45:20] direction
[01:45:23] so let me know I can make that bigger
[01:45:25] also for you here let me make that
[01:45:26] bigger so you can see it so I know
[01:45:28] sometimes you guys have a hard
[01:45:32] time so let me do this for you look at
[01:45:35] that nice and big you can see everything
[01:45:38] over
[01:45:39] there red buttons and all the bags right
[01:45:44] there whichever one you want let me know
[01:45:47] and we'll uh jump in on
[01:45:50] it well I know sometimes they give you a
[01:45:52] hard time Banks and stuff so i' like to
[01:45:54] give you a minute to get that stuff
[01:45:55] figured out so I've dealt with that
[01:45:57] before banks are like oh you can't buy
[01:46:00] from these
[01:46:01] things you can't do
[01:46:04] that like I want to use my money my way
[01:46:07] though too bad I think you should use it
[01:46:09] that my way that I

[01:47:10] it all
[01:47:12] right I think that's all of them I have
[01:47:15] finally gone through them all and found
[01:47:18] them for this
[01:47:20] person mono how's it going
[01:47:23] I understand the banks I gave it a
[01:47:25] minute there I didn't want to do
[01:47:26] anything let me know if you need me to
[01:47:27] rerun anything
[01:47:29] though so I will do
[01:47:39] that uh it did not go
[01:47:42] through let me do this I'll rerun it
[01:47:44] again there for
[01:47:46] you all right it doesn't show that it
[01:47:48] went through so I'm going to run it
[01:47:49] again and you can um you can do it
[01:47:53] another time all right I'm double
[01:47:56] checking I do not see it going through
[01:48:00] anywhere so here I'm going to run that
[01:48:03] again for you and I'm going to run it
[01:48:04] for uh I'll do 30 seconds here I know
[01:48:07] the banks are paying in the butt so
[01:48:09] that's why I was like giving you some
[01:48:10] time to figure it out I've been through
[01:48:12] that myself more than once with the
[01:48:13] banks where they're like oh you can't do
[01:48:16] this like what are you talking about I
[01:48:17] can't do that this is what I want to do
[01:48:19] give the authorization like I've had so
[01:48:21] many times I've tried to use my card
[01:48:23] when I was going like maybe not even
[01:48:25] going far away from where I normally
[01:48:26] live and then all of a sudden like my
[01:48:27] card shut off because I was using it at
[01:48:29] a gas station they didn't want me
[01:48:37] to there you go run that a little longer
[01:48:40] rerun that I'll rerun that for 5 minutes
[01:48:43] give you some time to figure it out and
[01:48:44] once you get it figured out I'll pop
[01:48:46] that right back in there but you can see
[01:48:48] all those are the mystery things that we
[01:48:49] got that's we got up there for everyone
[01:48:53] and we'll go with that give me a minute
[01:48:55] I'll give you a minute here take that
[01:48:56] figure that out and I'm seeing if I have
[01:49:00] any more I don't think I have any more

[01:49:07] Fallout

[01:49:49] 25 cancel that I even put it out I reran
[01:49:51] it
[01:49:53] it was because I reran it for 30 seconds
[01:49:55] and you were not in here and then I
[01:49:57] reran it again and it didn't rerun for
[01:49:59] 30 seconds so there you go sorry about

[02:06:38] those ones left sadly those left almost
[02:06:41] instantly I do have a few uh fallout
[02:06:44] cards left but not as many as I
[02:06:47] originally had I actually planned
[02:06:49] initially I actually had ordered
[02:06:52] four cases of
[02:06:55] Fallout I got two boxes from the
[02:07:02] distributor was insane insane I don't
[02:07:06] want to go and spend $600 on a [ __ ]
[02:07:08] box cuz no one's going to buy
[02:07:11] it no one's going to buy anything from
[02:07:13] it so there's no point in doing
[02:07:17] it
[02:07:19] sucks cuz I would love to go and buy
[02:07:22] boxes of them and open them so I was
[02:07:25] such a big fan of it I just can't can't
[02:07:27] find them anywhere to do
[02:07:39] it yeah it's one of the Fallout is
[02:07:41] probably one of the hardest things to
[02:07:42] find and I think they know they know
[02:07:45] they did it too I feel like they did it
[02:07:46] on purpose like they did it on purpose
[02:07:48] so they could create some hype for other
[02:07:50] things that they have that they'll have
[02:07:52] coming
[02:07:55] out I think that's I feel like that's
[02:07:57] part of what they
[02:07:59] did or part of the reason why they did
[02:08:01] it the way they
[02:08:03] did allows to Hype stuff a little bit
[02:08:06] more oh look we have this that sold
[02:08:10] out no one can get it I do have Fallout
[02:08:13] secret lirer if you're interested in any
[02:08:16] Fallout secret lair I have a bunch of
[02:08:19] those um
[02:08:22] got all of them each one foil and
[02:08:25] non-foil version of it right back
[02:08:28] there if you would like any of
[02:08:31] those I just had the game here in front
[02:08:34] of everything that's
[02:08:36] why but do have that secret layer over
[02:08:38] there if you want any of those Gladiator
[02:08:41] zombie how you doing thank you coming in
[02:08:43] hanging
[02:08:47] out let's see here I did just go through
[02:08:49] that I think what I'm going to have to
[02:08:51] do is is transfer that stuff over and
[02:08:53] then do a
[02:08:56] uh do a
[02:08:59] uh transfer that I now what do do I need
[02:09:03] more collector boosters or do I need
[02:09:04] more cheaper things what do you think
[02:09:06] for packs if I was going to go because I
[02:09:09] have to go and restock a little bit with
[02:09:11] that restock do I have
[02:09:13] um big
[02:09:15] pack
[02:09:18] or um should I be looking for something
[02:09:20] else cuz I feel like I need to get some
[02:09:22] more collector booster packs cuz I'm
[02:09:25] only at I only have lost
[02:09:28] caverns ioria and some Lord of the Rings
[02:09:32] for collector boosters so I feel I feel
[02:09:35] like that is requiring me to get more
[02:09:37] what do you guys think should I get more
[02:09:38] collector boosters for you
[02:09:40] guys like some
[02:09:42] variety like maybe three or four
[02:09:44] different
[02:09:48] ones I think that's what I might need to
[02:09:50] do
[02:09:53] I'm pick that up and put that in the
[02:09:54] trash on my way over
[02:09:57] there and put this one down for a new
[02:10:02] bag my middle little makeshift trash box

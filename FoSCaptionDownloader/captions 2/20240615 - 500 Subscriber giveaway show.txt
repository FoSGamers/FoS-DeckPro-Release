[00:01:10] morning oh good morning stinking
[00:01:12] linging sorry I was taking me a second
[00:01:14] to get get things up and running because
[00:01:16] I had a little bit of my my camera
[00:01:18] didn't turn on right away oddly that was
[00:01:21] an interesting one so I had to figure
[00:01:22] out what was going on there normally it
[00:01:24] turns on instantly and this time for
[00:01:26] some reason it did
[00:01:27] not Hello smashy many
[00:01:31] so I don't
[00:01:33] know hey I'm going to I actually am
[00:01:36] going to yeah we're going to get one
[00:01:38] running we'll do actually one of the
[00:01:40] thank you ones we haven't had one of
[00:01:42] those up in a little bit I'm gonna get
[00:01:42] yelled at because somebody doesn't like
[00:01:44] the sign cards and they allow them to be
[00:01:45] complaining now this is the type of
[00:01:47] mention we have in the world but that's
[00:01:49] oh come on I know I put those damn it I
[00:01:53] hate how this doesn't work that way I
[00:01:54] have to keep remembering I have to set
[00:01:55] those up through the phone because every
[00:01:57] time I go and put them in through my app
[00:02:00] through the the site it doesn't get in
[00:02:02] there for our giveaway things so that's
[00:02:05] that's frustrating that's frustrating
[00:02:09] one let's do this there we go let's put
[00:02:12] in a handful of those right now I keep
[00:02:15] adding them from the uh the website and
[00:02:18] I think I made a ticket but I don't
[00:02:19] remember being said anything yet every
[00:02:21] time I add them from the website for
[00:02:23] some reason they don't move over yet
[00:02:25] when I add them from uh the app on my
[00:02:28] phone they move
[00:02:31] over so we're going to do this one there
[00:02:34] we go I'm going to run that one let's
[00:02:35] see if it's in there
[00:02:37] now it is in there now I'm going to run
[00:02:40] one of those up there a see my camera's
[00:02:43] not working right even aha see my
[00:02:45] camera's frozen still okay hold on a
[00:02:47] second let me see if I can fix
[00:02:54] this oh
[00:02:56] no do you see me moving now do you see
[00:03:00] me move ah there we go the camera see I
[00:03:02] told you there was an issue with the
[00:03:03] camera I still even looked like I was
[00:03:04] frozen I figured it
[00:03:08] out you got it now back I knew there was
[00:03:11] something wrong because I said what
[00:03:13] happens is uh for some reason whatnot
[00:03:15] steals the camera sometimes when I go to
[00:03:18] start the uh the stream and it's the
[00:03:20] weirdest thing in the world because it
[00:03:21] steals the camera and when it steals the
[00:03:23] camera it like makes it either freeze on
[00:03:24] OBS or it pulls it away and it changes
[00:03:27] the screen size to like this weird
[00:03:28] screen size and never get a chance to
[00:03:30] get through anything so what we're going
[00:03:32] to do here is we're going to hopefully
[00:03:33] get to 500 subscribers here on YouTube
[00:03:35] today going to run the giveaway and

[00:42:11] having a little bit of tech issues so
[00:42:13] hopefully we'll get that squared away in
[00:42:15] a little while here but who knows I'm
[00:42:16] betting that's not going to happen but I
[00:42:18] want to put all your stuff in some top
[00:42:20] loaders to protect them for you for
[00:42:24] shipping nice hits my friend
[00:42:28] and then I'm going to put this with
[00:42:29] guide of souls put this with that and
[00:42:33] then I'm going to put that with that
[00:42:36] there we
[00:42:37] go that's how it's going
[00:42:44] there oh I'm sorry hey no worries I
[00:42:48] wasn't I wasn't even on on Friday
[00:42:49] because I had a doctor's appointment and
[00:42:52] um I had so I wasn't able to get on on
[00:42:54] Friday and then I was going to go on
[00:42:55] Friday in the afternoon and then some
[00:42:57] stuff happened at work where my um my
[00:42:59] manager is now getting into harassing to
[00:43:01] my personal life he actually came on to
[00:43:04] pretty much harass me on here my work
[00:43:06] manager so um I'm actually resigning
[00:43:08] from work the boss the bot is uh broken
[00:43:11] at the moment for some reason it wasn't
[00:43:13] working uh when I started it up and
[00:43:15] rather than spending a bunch of time
[00:43:16] trying to figure it out I decided we'll
[00:43:18] go a little old school doing some of our
[00:43:20] sales like we used to before the bot and
[00:43:23] uh doing the giveaways and the cool
[00:43:25] things we do instead
[00:43:36] hey no
[00:43:40] problem um I uh I don't know I reported
[00:43:43] him with HR and um I my pretty much they
[00:43:46] haven't done anything about it they told
[00:43:48] me that uh he hasn't done anything wrong
[00:43:50] and um I said he retaliated against me
[00:43:54] against something by doing that and he's
[00:43:55] now going into my personal life which is
[00:43:56] a little
[00:43:57] appropriate um and they even made a
[00:44:00] comment to me in HR that my personal
[00:44:02] life is none of the company's business
[00:44:04] yet for some reason I was allowed for
[00:44:06] him to go into it so I decided since a
[00:44:08] narcissist will never stop especially if
[00:44:10] he gets in trouble at work I'm gonna
[00:44:13] quit rather than having him get in
[00:44:14] trouble at work and go after me for the
[00:44:16] rest of my life I decided I'd quit
[00:44:19] because that's what narcissists do they
[00:44:21] don't know how to stop they're shitty
[00:44:24] people go to on
[00:44:27] but boss Beat Down yeah yeah so [ __ ] it
[00:44:33] not doing
[00:44:35] it not too bad Rugrat not too bad been
[00:44:38] better been better but hey you know what
[00:44:40] we're at right now we're at our time
[00:44:41] where're we're going to play our game
[00:44:43] because we have all of our stuff sold
[00:44:44] we're at Oblivion gets to choose what

[00:45:29] money that he was making and was living
[00:45:31] on the boat just taking Straight Cash
[00:45:33] homes and then he just [ __ ] pieced

[02:29:07] not gonna be silly that's silly that's
[02:29:08] not working right
[02:29:14] today yeah I um long story short
[02:29:17] Oblivion um
[02:29:20] that uh on when I had HR call me about
[02:29:24] stuff that I do in my private time
[02:29:26] because my somebody reported me after
[02:29:29] literally I mentioned I do stuff on
[02:29:31] YouTube um and um so and the person was
[02:29:35] like you're not doing anything wrong I
[02:29:36] don't know why pretty much they're like
[02:29:38] you're not doing anything wrong your
[02:29:39] free time is your free time we don't
[02:29:40] care what you do in your free
[02:29:42] time and um so now that I have somebody
[02:29:45] going and looking into my free time when
[02:29:47] that's a narcissist that does that they
[02:29:48] will not stop until you are uh hurt or
[02:29:52] harmed in some way so because of that I
[02:29:55] am like you know what my my my life my
[02:29:57] family are worth more than this job and
[02:29:59] a narcissist so I will uh I'm changing
[02:30:02] it and I'm not going to do it anymore I
[02:30:03] have other options I've always had other
[02:30:05] options I have just never pushed on them
[02:30:08] as much because this was a pretty good
[02:30:09] job that was a uh pretty secure thing
[02:30:12] but now it's not worth it for me to do
[02:30:15] any of it so I'm
[02:30:16] not and I'm gonna go and do my own thing
[02:30:19] now you know
[02:30:20] right have some fun do my own thing I
[02:30:23] have uh some other stuff I've had
[02:30:24] already in the works Beyond this just
[02:30:28] doing this stuff here so I'm not even
[02:30:29] going to just be doing this stuff here I
[02:30:30] have other things that I've been doing
[02:30:31] for my own stuff my own job I've been
[02:30:33] making so I've been making my own like

[02:30:36] already have a couple people that want
[02:30:37] me building apps for them so [ __ ] them
[02:30:39] I'm done with this place if this if they
[02:30:41] don't want to stop me and protect me
[02:30:43] from a narcissist then I don't need to
[02:30:45] be
[02:30:47] there yeah sucks that happened but hey

[02:52:54] to be they're supposed to be a manager
[02:52:55] of mine and they went and find my
[02:52:56] YouTube channel and reported me to uh HR
[02:53:00] for the YouTube channel and HR talked to
[02:53:02] me and was like what are you doing here
[02:53:03] I'm like well I told him what I was
[02:53:04] doing and they like all right you're
[02:53:06] doing stuff in your personal time it's
[02:53:07] not a problem this guy's been after me
[02:53:10] since he started for like six months ago
[02:53:13] so I just decided when my wife made ra
[02:53:16] read a um thing to me on uh from
[02:53:20] LinkedIn about narcissistic people that
[02:53:23] are narcissistic bosses I was like you
[02:53:24] know what that's exactly what I've been
[02:53:26] dealing with there's no point in doing
[02:53:28] this anymore and as I can see as from
[02:53:31] everybody says and I've had I've
[02:53:33] actually talked to a couple different
[02:53:34] older people that I was like what do I
[02:53:36] do here and pretty much they're like you
[02:53:38] either need to suck up to this person
[02:53:39] and give in or and like just kiss their
[02:53:43] ass because that's the type of person
[02:53:44] they're going to be or you need to find
[02:53:46] another job I'm like I'm find another
[02:53:47] job I'm not not a person that kisses ass
[02:53:49] to a person that stalks you so that's
[02:53:52] where I
[02:54:02] am I don't
[02:54:06] know oh yeah smash I already know put it
[02:54:09] this way my wife made the comment that
[02:54:11] luckily if he comes down to Florida
[02:54:12] harass me we have the standard ground
[02:54:14] law um so I wouldn't have to worry about
[02:54:17] him coming here
[02:54:20] here all right nobody wants that we'll
[02:54:23] open up another one
[02:54:26] here but he's in another state and he'll
[02:54:28] harass me the W best he can that way
[02:54:30] till the point that I
[02:54:31] quit I actually had somebody tell me I
[02:54:34] should go to the Florida bar because I
[02:54:36] guess that's actually a uh against the
[02:54:38] law down here in Florida to harass you
[02:54:39] so you quit so yes feed them to the
[02:54:43] Gators
[02:54:44] exactly so I don't know I I've been
[02:54:46] debating on talking to that too but I
[02:54:48] just kind of I don't even want to deal
[02:54:49] with it because you know what I have a
[02:54:50] better option and there's no point in
[02:54:52] dealing with that headache anymore it's

[02:58:22] you read that I'm like there's no way I
[02:58:23] can make this better I have to leave but
[02:58:26] as soon as I I was like after hearing
[02:58:28] that and also having somebody talk to me
[02:58:29] about stuff um like I had I had an older
[02:58:33] friend uh like a father of a friend of

[02:58:36] was giving me some advice pretty much

[02:59:15] message you know what it's a good chance
[02:59:17] they are yes I already they already are
[02:59:19] started they probably already doing it
[02:59:21] anyways because they're je my my wife
[02:59:23] actually thinks they're jealous because
[02:59:24] we're going to be living on a boat
[02:59:26] traveling I already have my boat I have
[02:59:28] a beautiful wife and a bunch of other
[02:59:29] stuff so there I think she seems to
[02:59:31] think he's already jealous and that's
[02:59:33] why he's already giving me a hard time
[02:59:34] because of all the stuff we're doing
[02:59:36] because um as soon as uh like I was a
[02:59:38] normal person with him and then uh it
[02:59:40] was about the time that I had I went
[02:59:41] down to Miami to look for a boat because
[02:59:44] we're going to be buying a boat to move
[02:59:45] on and at that point it started kind of
[02:59:47] like degrading almost kind of like oh my
[02:59:50] God he's going to be buying a $2 million
[02:59:51] boat what the [ __ ] and then it went down
[02:59:54] and degraded slowly got worse and worse
[02:59:56] and worse over time so like I worked at
[02:59:59] a company where I busted my ass
[03:00:00] overnight so I could get stock in the
[03:00:02] company so I I could retire easily and
[03:00:06] because of that um like I have the
[03:00:08] ability to get some cool things later in
[03:00:10] a few maybe hopefully in a few years
[03:00:12] here once everything is sold and we take
[03:00:14] care of it all and because of that my
[03:00:17] wife seems to think he's jealous and
[03:00:18] that's what's going on I'm like I don't
[03:00:20] know then she makes a comment you're
[03:00:22] better looking too so that always help
[03:00:24] that also doesn't help that you're

[03:01:24] too which is another reason why I'm
[03:01:26] proly like leaving and not pushing
[03:01:28] forward with it because if something
[03:01:30] happened and he got in trouble he'll
[03:01:31] take it out on everyone around him and I
[03:01:34] don't want to be a person to cause that
[03:01:36] that's the difference between me and a
[03:01:37] person like them is I actually care
[03:01:39] about other people going on around them
[03:01:41] whether what I do will affect the other
[03:01:43] people around them so I try not to do
[03:01:46] things then there you go
[03:01:49] one you got this vexing Boke battle
[03:01:52] wagging and a vexing Bobble there you go
[03:01:55] and the auction right there is that
[03:01:56] wrath of the
[03:02:04] Skies exactly and the company will run
[03:02:07] into it at some point and they'll figure
[03:02:09] it out and there's going to be a problem
[03:02:11] and I'm going to just be like I'm done
[03:02:12] with it I left because I didn't want to
[03:02:14] deal with
[03:02:16] it but I do know that if anything one
[03:02:19] thing happens with it outside of work
[03:02:22] again I'm actually even debating on it
[03:02:25] now because you already went outside of
[03:02:26] work but anything else happens outside
[03:02:28] of work where he looks at anything in
[03:02:31] mine kind of like going after something
[03:02:33] in mine I'm getting uh I guess in
[03:02:36] Florida I can get a restraining order on
[03:02:37] him anywhere that he wouldn't be able to
[03:02:39] do that and uh if he breaks the
[03:02:41] restraining order he goes to jail for 10
[03:02:43] years so I'm debating on doing that
[03:02:45] depending on what uh what they do next
[03:02:50] wrath I like it
[03:02:53] Frank you know got to make my family
[03:02:55] safe because I'm doing this stuff with
[03:02:56] my kids and he's going to come on to
[03:02:58] find this and harass me on things that

[04:37:45] he was a fisherman so that's what he did
[04:37:47] on his that's what was that was what his
[04:37:49] living was so he'd be gone for like
[04:37:51] weeks to months on end so whenever he
[04:37:53] was around he he did put a little bit
[04:37:56] more I maybe put a little more effort in

[04:39:16] one wow that's interesting see I have a
[04:39:19] I have a friend that was like that that
[04:39:20] didn't meet their dad ever and um but he
[04:39:22] had a good stepfather so that that
[04:39:24] helped out for him I've known a few
[04:39:26] people that have been in shitty
[04:39:27] situations but like my father was gone
[04:39:28] for anywhere from two weeks to a month
[04:39:30] at a time and he'd be back for like
[04:39:32] maybe a week so I he was um long story
[04:39:35] short I was 12 years old and at one of
[04:39:37] my baseball games and I had one of my
[04:39:39] kids friends that were mine that came up
[04:39:40] and goes hey who's that guy sit next to
[04:39:41] your mom like that's my
[04:39:44] dad and he goes oh Oh I thought that was
[04:39:47] like her boyfriend or something because
[04:39:48] I've never seen your dad before like oh
[04:39:50] he's a fisherman he's just not around
[04:39:54] much and like people thought that my mom

[04:40:00] to go out fishing all the time Big Mike
[04:40:02] nice take for that
[04:40:04] one like you said that's like a $15 card
[04:40:07] right there got for 11
[04:40:10] bucks
[04:40:12] 1982 or 982 big mik there you go my
[04:40:15] friend with the flooded
[04:40:18] Shand exactly that's exactly why I'm the
[04:40:21] same way I do everything I can to be
[04:40:22] there for my kids now it's not because
[04:40:23] my dad did anything wrong it's just he
[04:40:24] wasn't around so without him being
[04:40:27] around I was just I now I put more
[04:40:29] effort than probably necessary
[04:40:33] in all right so I have two ugan by ugan
[04:40:37] labyrinths here okay
[04:40:44] this is how I'm going to do this ugan
[04:40:45] Labyrinth right now I'm going to start
[04:40:48] this at
[04:40:49] $40 This is 40 if you want it if you
[04:40:53] want to bid up this is
[04:40:56] 45 okay so I have two of them so This Is
[04:41:00] 40 and I'm going to start it at 40 for
[04:41:02] this one but if you want to bid up to
[04:41:04] this one for 45 you can do it
[04:41:12] yeah I'm sorry about that Teddy that is
[04:41:14] horrible man that is really really
[04:41:16] horrible I I that's unbelievable some
[04:41:18] people are just that sucks I'm sorry man
[04:41:21] I am very sorry about
[04:41:22] that I am very very sorry about that as
[04:41:25] one of those things that you just I
[04:41:27] understand I I know people in my life
[04:41:29] that have been similar but not that way
[04:41:31] that was a father so that's I'm sorry
[04:41:33] about that and here I'm going to do this
[04:41:35] it's going to go for 30 seconds it's not
[04:41:37] sudden death this time that way you guys
[04:41:38] get a
[04:41:39] chance oh really
[04:41:51] not enough
[04:41:56] remaining that is
[04:41:58] weird all right let's try this
[04:42:06] then that was weird why is it not
[04:42:09] running well there we go get 40 or if
[04:42:13] you want to bid up this is
[04:42:17] 45 you get this you get the upgraded one
[04:42:19] if it goes to 45 is what I'm saying if
[04:42:21] it goes to 45 you get this one because
[04:42:23] some people like both of them they don't
[04:42:25] I don't know which one they want so I
[04:42:26] put ugan as this one for 40 but if you
[04:42:29] up if you want to pay it up to 45 you
[04:42:31] can get this one for 45 is what I'm
[04:42:32] saying because some people like the
[04:42:34] different ones I don't know if I'm
[04:42:35] confusing
[04:42:36] it oh wow lab nice
[04:42:44] yes so it looks like vickas is going

[04:51:15] now dealing with it for long enough that
[04:51:19] I don't need to deal with it
[04:51:22] anymore and when uh like I said when I
[04:51:24] when my wife read off the thing about
[04:51:26] what uh a
[04:51:27] uh a narcissistic boss was and it hit
[04:51:31] the nail on the head on every single
[04:51:32] thing I've been dealing with I was like
[04:51:34] oh boy Yep this isn't going to get any
[04:51:36] better it's going to get
[04:51:38] worse Sacha Aether flux
[04:51:41] genius and that's what I that's what it

[04:51:51] person was I'm like son of a [ __ ] that
[04:51:53] [ __ ] down to a tea on what I'm
[04:51:54] dealing with and the thing it boiled
[04:51:56] down to was you're not going to ever
[04:51:58] there's nothing you can ever do unless
[04:51:59] pretty much that person needs to be
[04:52:00] fired or you need to leave or you need
[04:52:02] to kiss their ass so I'm like well I'm
[04:52:04] not kissing someone's ass that's an

[04:52:12] thank you I appreciate that night ow I
[04:52:14] appreciate that a
[04:52:15] lot draft draft is good pre-made deck
[04:52:19] correct if you go Barrett if you go into
[04:52:21] like say you go to one of the game
[04:52:22] stores and you buy like say a commander
[04:52:24] deck a pre-made commander deck that
[04:52:25] works out well I also am a big fan of
[04:52:28] doing pre-release because no one knows
[04:52:30] it and you get your pre-release box and
[04:52:32] you all have to play it but also no one
[04:52:35] knowing it means you don't know it
[04:52:36] either and if you're new it does take a
[04:52:38] while because I've lost games just
[04:52:39] because I played the wrong card at the
[04:52:41] wrong time like I played it literally I
[04:52:42] played it one card and if I had played
[04:52:44] it first I would have won but because
[04:52:46] the way I was reading it I read it as I
[04:52:48] had to play it second and the guy's like
[04:52:50] you just [ __ ] up I'm like what do you
[04:52:51] mean you would have won if you played it
[04:52:52] first like what he like no it says this
[04:52:54] no it means this and I had had the rule
[04:52:56] person come over he's like yeah he's
[04:52:57] right I'm like a you gotta be kidding me
[04:52:59] I literally had the game one but I put
[04:53:01] it in the wrong order because the way I
[04:53:03] read
[04:53:06] it lupack wasn't on for a
[04:53:09] dollar it was wasn't supposed to be
[04:53:14] but that's
[04:53:17] weird Loop pack for a dollar that wasn't
[04:53:20] supposed to go on for a dollar I put the
[04:53:23] game ah that was supposed to be this on
[04:53:25] screen
[04:53:31] single this is that that that I don't
[04:53:36] know why it went on for that that was
[04:53:37] the wrong one I clicked on the wrong one
[04:53:39] well there you go
[04:53:44] go there you
[04:53:46] go yeah it was a mistake I read the
[04:53:48] wrong one go but thank you I appreciate
[04:53:49] that I was supposed to say It was
[04:53:51] supposed to be up for this one but it
[04:53:52] clicked on the one right below it that's
[04:53:55] what happened
[04:53:56] there it should open on stream
[04:53:58] definitely open it on
[04:54:01] stream all
[04:54:02] right so
[04:54:11] let's see what we got going on here no
[04:54:13] one wants those this is what I'm going
[04:54:15] to do now I am going to do a couple of
[04:54:18] these things let's see if we want to we
[04:54:19] had some singles we were going out with
[04:54:22] we'll do some more singles here for a
[04:54:23] minute but maybe um maybe I should just
[04:54:27] kind of go through the singles a little
[04:54:29] differently you want me to kind of like
[04:54:30] scroll through them you guys can tell me
[04:54:32] if there's ones that you want and then I
[04:54:35] can kind of like put them off the side a
[04:54:37] little bit while we throw some packs out
[04:54:40] maybe do something like
[04:54:42] that on screen
[04:54:46] single there we go that strict
[04:54:53] serenade and we'll keep going through
[04:54:55] some of the singles here that we
[04:54:57] have we'll do um Let's
[04:55:07] do let's see what this one is that's
[04:55:09] been sitting there for a while I don't
[04:55:10] even know what that price is cuz it
[04:55:11] keeps coming out wrong oh boish
[04:55:13] check-ins are not working right now I
[04:55:14] have to work uh my my bot isn't working
[04:55:17] so I'm trying to figure out
[04:55:20] uh H figure that one out soon myself but
[04:55:24] stricks going to free free
[04:55:30] barking free
[04:55:37] barking yes I know I I
[04:55:40] the way you type I can say you're either
[04:55:42] my age or older is what it
[04:55:45] is I I recognize that too 100% I've done
[04:55:48] that before myself I'm like I can tell
[04:55:50] just by the way someone's typing that
[04:55:52] they're either in their mid-30s to or
[04:55:55] above or they're in their 60s or above
[04:55:58] or they're in like their 50s or above
[04:55:59] because the way they type with some
[04:56:00] things they talk it's pretty interesting
[04:56:02] when you actually like pay attention to
[04:56:04] people and you can actually learn that
[04:56:06] stuff I'd say you were probably uh
[04:56:09] probably around my age 45ish 40
[04:56:12] 45 you I'd say you're
[04:56:15] 32 32
[04:56:20] is 26 almost 27 Oh close not bad you
[04:56:25] tvok oh oh I I don't know tuac I'd say
[04:56:28] you're um you're in your 30s or you're
[04:56:31] in your late 20s or you're in your early
[04:56:33] 30s the way you
[04:56:35] tight 37 all right close close
[04:56:42] oh see well that's where it is Nal
[04:56:44] that's exactly what it is I think people
[04:56:45] are older depending on what they're
[04:56:46] typing out so that's probably that
[04:56:48] throws me off a little bit 45 see I was
[04:56:52] close wasn't too bad on everybody's
[04:56:54] typing I was I was there as the

[05:01:04] with themselves in their
[05:01:08] lives see living wheeler I'm the same
[05:01:10] way I had a lot of people growing up so
[05:01:13] I had a job I turned 30 at my job uh
[05:01:17] when you know 10 years ago and I had
[05:01:20] like a I always have like facial hair
[05:01:22] I've always had it for because like
[05:01:23] since I was like 14 I've had facial hair
[05:01:25] so um like I've just been lazy and I now
[05:01:27] grow a beard and I you know make it nice
[05:01:29] clean it up well at one of those jobs I
[05:01:31] had a person that goes they they looked
[05:01:33] at me and they like we were talking
[05:01:35] about somebody was just having their
[05:01:36] birthday and they were turning like 43
[05:01:39] or something and we were all heading
[05:01:40] over the gym because I used to go to the
[05:01:41] gym with these guys and um they made a
[05:01:44] comment I made a com oh my birthday's
[05:01:46] coming up soon like oh how you turn how
[05:01:47] old you turn like what 40 39 40 I'm like

[05:01:54] they all looked at me like what like
[05:01:56] yeah I'm turning
[05:01:58] 30 and like you you seem so much older
[05:02:02] from way you look and the way you act
[05:02:04] I'm
[05:02:04] like I had an old life I've been I've
[05:02:07] dealt with a lot of [ __ ] in my life so I
[05:02:08] have to I'm an old soul and some
[05:02:13] ways yes exactly see when I was in high
[05:02:16] school when I was in Middle School I
[05:02:17] actually was in an I did a a b i did um
[05:02:21] a
[05:02:22] uh play and in one of the plays they had
[05:02:25] me be one of the lower voice people
[05:02:27] because I was able to sing the lower
[05:02:28] voice on it and it was just an
[05:02:30] interesting
[05:02:31] scenario you're very welcome
[05:02:38] Barrett yes definitely go trying to find
[05:02:40] a local shop to go and hang out with
[05:02:41] it's always going to be fun hanging out
[05:02:43] at a local
[05:02:46] shop yeah I know it's interesting
[05:02:48] because like even when I was younger
[05:02:50] people always thought I was older you
[05:02:51] know I think it was just because the way
[05:02:53] that I I dealt with people and I talk to
[05:02:54] people I was used to um I was used to
[05:02:57] working with older people I was like a
[05:02:59] lifeguard and I worked with i i i at the
[05:03:02] age of 15 I was a lifeguard so I was
[05:03:04] dealing with older people on a daily
[05:03:05] basis having to talk to them be like you
[05:03:07] can't do that or you can't handle things
[05:03:09] this way and I had to learn how to be
[05:03:11] respectful and and like explain stuff to
[05:03:14] adults at a young age where they're
[05:03:17] going to want to um where they need to
[05:03:19] listen to
[05:03:26] me let's see this one and that because
[05:03:29] of that I actually had a lot of people
[05:03:30] come up to the um Police Department when
[05:03:32] I was lifeguarding my I uh the police
[05:03:35] department goes I've never had since you
[05:03:37] started working here one person a week
[05:03:38] comes to the police department and tells
[05:03:39] us

[05:03:42] never had anybody do that before and
[05:03:44] it's like what are you doing I'm like I
[05:03:45] don't know I walk around with the can in
[05:03:46] my hand and I talk to people like what

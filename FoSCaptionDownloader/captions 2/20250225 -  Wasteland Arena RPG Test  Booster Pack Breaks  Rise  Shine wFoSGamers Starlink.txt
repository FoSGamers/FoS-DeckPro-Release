[00:00:00] we'll find
[00:00:10] out well it's either going to work or
[00:00:12] it's not because these are the exact
[00:00:14] same settings that I have set up on the
[00:00:16] other
[00:00:18] one so if it doesn't work I'm going to
[00:00:21] have to figure out what is going on here
[00:00:22] on why no it was not
[00:00:24] working that's absolute
[00:00:28] [¬†__¬†] that's a absolute
[00:00:31] [¬†__¬†] it is not working and I don't
[00:00:34] know why and that's going to really
[00:00:35] annoy the crap out of
[00:00:38] me what is causing
[00:00:44] this why is it doing
[00:00:49] this
[00:00:51] um this connection is so crappy it looks
[00:00:54] like it won't and for some reason the
[00:00:56] internet connection is really slow
[00:01:26] try that maybe see if that helps
[00:01:32] no make anything any
[00:01:37] better I don't know we'll find out
[00:01:53] here no that didn't do anything
[00:02:00] I don't know why I'm having such bad
[00:02:01] connection right
[00:02:03] here I can't seem to figure it out it
[00:02:06] seems like we're okay and then we all of
[00:02:08] a sudden we come back we're having
[00:02:09] problems we come back we're having
[00:02:11] problems it's almost
[00:02:14] like it's not the internet
[00:02:17] right that's what I was wondering is if
[00:02:19] I need to restart everything to get
[00:02:20] everything to connect well I'm just
[00:02:22] wondering are we being blocked by the
[00:02:24] buildings over here where we're
[00:02:27] at oh maybe
[00:02:30] maybe that's blocking some of it let me
[00:02:32] check it
[00:02:38] out no not
[00:02:45] really I know thought process not
[00:02:53] bad I don't know hey spicy how's it
[00:02:56] going my friend yeah so I'm trying to
[00:02:59] figure out why we're getting some
[00:03:01] uh issues now here sending things
[00:03:06] over with the uh with you all now so it
[00:03:11] looks like YouTube works
[00:03:16] okay back YouTube works fine but for
[00:03:19] whatever reason whatnot does not like
[00:03:22] what we're doing right
[00:03:23] now it's the weirdest thing in the world
[00:03:26] it's like YouTube is it's nice that
[00:03:27] YouTube's working nicely
[00:03:30] not bad hey it's better than work is
[00:03:33] done for the day right so you know what
[00:03:37] let's do
[00:03:38] this I think we're getting better here
[00:03:42] with our connection a uh a thing where I
[00:03:46] might need to just slight like literally
[00:03:48] re restart everything internet phone uh
[00:03:52] you know computer and all that stuff
[00:03:53] because it's been running for a little
[00:03:55] bit and it's had to stop start a handful
[00:03:57] of times
[00:04:00] and I can see the internet connection
[00:04:02] fluctuating all over the place
[00:04:04] weirdly so I wonder if it's actually our
[00:04:07] internet connection at the moment versus
[00:04:08] everything else because it seems to be
[00:04:10] good and then it fluctuates
[00:04:17] down it's showing a lot less P per
[00:04:24] kilobits interesting
[00:04:37] don't know why it's doing that how you
[00:04:39] uh don't know why it's doing
[00:04:50] that wonder why it's it's like it's not
[00:04:53] restricting
[00:04:58] that I think it's all right there now
[00:05:00] what do you guys think is it working
[00:05:02] here I don't know we could run into some
[00:05:04] headaches right
[00:05:09] now I'm sorry
[00:05:12] FR bugging damn
[00:05:16] it 16 17 megabytes a second I'm bugging
[00:05:19] that's so weird for f frz Gabe
[00:05:23] Hernandez see this is weird it's so
[00:05:25] weird that's okay on YouTube but for
[00:05:29] whatever reason
[00:05:31] thank you I appreciate that
[00:05:32] Gabe yeah it's just like weird I think
[00:05:36] uh I think we might be doing a little
[00:05:37] bit better now though I think I made a
[00:05:39] couple of
[00:05:40] adjustments that might have might be
[00:05:42] doing better here
[00:05:44] now at least it seems like it might
[00:05:47] be let's do
[00:05:50] this all right I think it's doing better
[00:05:55] here so I don't have all of them
[00:05:57] connected
[00:06:04] we got a bunch of stuff shut
[00:06:06] down so it seems like it's doing a
[00:06:08] little bit better
[00:06:10] now seems to be holding better all right
[00:06:13] good I actually think it's partially our
[00:06:15] internet connection maybe and I might
[00:06:17] have to restart our stuff because it's
[00:06:18] been running for a while and I oh son of
[00:06:23] a [¬†__¬†] what I bet I know our problem
[00:06:26] what it's been running and we moved what
[00:06:28] how many miles 30 20 miles 15 15 miles I
[00:06:32] wonder if it's not catching up to our
[00:06:35] location that we moved and we need to
[00:06:37] like shut it down and restart it the
[00:06:39] internet I don't know you know what I
[00:06:41] mean I don't know I wonder if that's it
[00:06:45] you regular now
[00:06:48] no yeah but that's fine I have it set
[00:06:54] up that could be it all right all right
[00:06:57] everybody give me

[00:09:44] Frank oh the Mr house I did not find the
[00:09:47] Mr house I had long story short I went
[00:09:49] to go sell my
[00:09:51] boat and then uh the battery didn't turn
[00:09:55] on so I had to go and deal with that um
[00:09:58] and I didn't get to for
[00:10:00] it um so my
[00:10:03] bad that's what happened not going to
[00:10:05] lie I didn't get to look for it I will
[00:10:08] um I was going to look for it after like
[00:10:10] then so I'm going to try to do that
[00:10:12] tonight after I deal with the boat again
[00:10:15] because I got the battery I gotta put it
[00:10:17] in then the guy's gonna come back to
[00:10:19] look at it because I know I'm obvious
[00:10:20] going to start it up I'm gonna go for a
[00:10:21] run this time last night he was just
[00:10:22] looking at it with his wife so his wife
[00:10:24] could make sure that he was H she was
[00:10:25] okay with the what it looked like and
[00:10:27] the style of it the guys been in the air
[00:10:29] for a while he knows Florida he just
[00:10:31] kills batteries and we hadn't touched it
[00:10:32] for about a month because of all the
[00:10:34] other [ __ ] going on so you didn't care
[00:10:35] about that he just said yeah throw a new
[00:10:36] battery in and as long as it runs we
[00:10:38] understand batteries or [ __ ] like that
[00:10:39] they like the Walmart batteries blow out
[00:10:42] because the heat like in six months
[00:10:44] sometimes so yeah sucks on the dead
[00:10:46] battery I went into it I was like we
[00:10:48] I'll meet you down there the thing is I
[00:10:49] used it a month and a half ago and zero
[00:10:51] issues I went 30 miles out back zero
[00:10:53] issues at all so that means the heat we
[00:10:55] moved it from underneath it was
[00:10:56] underneath like an overhang thing to a
[00:10:58] dock that was on a um to a lifted dock
[00:11:00] but it wasn't underneath an overhang so
[00:11:02] I'm guessing the sun beating down on the
[00:11:03] boat just must have [ __ ] killed the
[00:11:05] battery I don't know I don't know just
[00:11:09] sucks I was like you gota be kidding me
[00:11:11] like he like I used this freaking like a
[00:11:13] month ago and we were out 30 miles with

[00:30:38] I'm just going to put them together in
[00:30:39] the top loaders so they don't slide
[00:30:42] out um and then we're going to put them
[00:30:44] in a bag and everything nicely for
[00:30:47] you to protect
[00:30:50] you and your stuff for
[00:30:54] shipping what's
[00:30:56] up oh yeah I can't have that in the car
[00:30:58] for
[00:31:05] you all right nice pickup my
[00:31:09] friend ah you got to go to work a little
[00:31:11] hey I understand
[00:31:14] that well that's why I used to have to
[00:31:16] get off earlier um before I uh like
[00:31:18] ended up resigning I used to have to get
[00:31:20] off earlier so that I could go I used to
[00:31:22] get off at 9:00 a.m. because I was
[00:31:24] working my other regular job but you
[00:31:25] know I ended up resigning there so I
[00:31:27] don't do the same thing
[00:31:28] anymore and there you go wind swep Heath
[00:31:31] blood stain Meer and those going in
[00:31:33] there so they don't fall out they're all
[00:31:35] in sleeves it's just more that they
[00:31:36] don't swall out of the top loaders
[00:31:37] during
[00:31:42] shipping because I like to use physics
[00:31:45] instead of like tap and stuff two
[00:31:50] reasons tape could possibly stick on to
[00:31:52] something and make it hard to get off
[00:31:55] and also less stuff waste so don't have
[00:31:58] to ruin the environment
[00:32:03] more all

[02:22:57] those so that's
[02:23:01] why all
[02:23:03] right planes yes I can check the
[02:23:06] planes did you want uh was it the ones
[02:23:09] from Lord of the Rings or were you
[02:23:10] looking for somewhere else planes
[02:23:16] planes else all right all playing we
[02:23:20] have the planes from Modern
[02:23:23] Horizon
[02:23:25] um we have
[02:23:29] uh planes from we have a planes from
[02:23:33] Fallout
[02:23:36] here got uh murders of
[02:23:41] carav that other planes from
[02:23:46] Fallout planes from Outlaws
[02:23:53] another planes from Outlaw from Outlaws
[02:23:56] planes from
[02:23:58] Outlaws you have a ples retro
[02:24:04] there um all right those are the planes
[02:24:07] that are not those
[02:24:11] ones so we
[02:24:15] have uh the extended art one here let me
[02:24:18] zoom zoom in so you can see it the
[02:24:20] Border I mean the Retro one here from uh
[02:24:22] Commander Masters I believe we have
[02:24:25] Outlaws planes I get three of those ones
[02:24:28] if you want those those are foil planes
[02:24:31] and I have uh two planes from Lord of
[02:24:34] the r i mean not fall from Fallout here
[02:24:36] and I got a couple from Lord of the
[02:24:38] Rings right now now like I said I
[02:24:39] probably have more of this well not
[02:24:41] Outlaws necessarily I may have more
[02:24:42] Outlaws but uh Lord of the Rings and
[02:24:44] Fallout I might have more somewhere else
[02:24:46] I'm not sure but either way that's what
[02:24:49] we got there
[02:24:51] want to go with uh just check the
[02:24:53] Outlaws we can do that we can do
[02:25:00] that let's
[02:25:03] do oh
[02:25:06] DJ
[02:25:09] 272 all right so that would be a dollar
[02:25:11] for each one of those for all one all
[02:25:13] those together all three of
[02:25:17] those and then you said the one with
[02:25:20] lady here from Fallout you're intrigued
[02:25:23] why the Fallout lady
[02:25:28] here there you
[02:25:33] go that would be uh $2 so we call that
[02:25:36] $3 total for all of um all all these but
[02:25:41] the the thing is the shipping because
[02:25:43] the amount of cards that are here I
[02:25:44] can't do the cheaper price shipping it
[02:25:46] has to be the other shipping so that's
[02:25:47] the only concern that you need to worry
[02:25:49] about on that one because being multiple
[02:25:51] cards it does do it that way so I'll
[02:25:54] throw this out here for $3 with that
[02:25:55] shipping so you know what it's going to
[02:26:01] be um I'll edit it so you know what it
[02:26:04] is there oh there we go we already have
[02:26:06] it out there and put it this way for
[02:26:13] $3 there you go I'll throw that
[02:26:16] there I'm going to I'm doing it there
[02:26:18] there you go
[02:26:23] oh Outlaws Outlaws I can take the other
[02:26:25] ones out yes I can take the other ones
[02:26:27] out I'm sorry I thought you saying just
[02:26:29] run it I'm sorry I was mistaken on that
[02:26:31] I'll throw the JY Outlaws out
[02:26:35] there yeah the shipping if you click on
[02:26:38] it it'll show you the shipping for where
[02:26:39] you
[02:26:42] are so I'll do just the Outlaws there
[02:26:45] now with those let me see
[02:26:50] Mr Fong
[02:27:00] here okay those ones are like that okay
[02:27:05] we'll do this

[02:27:10] goes to the other shipping because we're
[02:27:13] allowed to do it with at least with
[02:27:15] those three I can do it that way this is
[02:27:18] going to go on for un doll hair

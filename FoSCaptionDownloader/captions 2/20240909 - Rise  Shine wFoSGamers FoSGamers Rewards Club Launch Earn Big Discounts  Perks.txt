[00:01:17] quickly and we're going to run
[00:01:20] a one of our giveaways like we normally
[00:01:22] have running but I need to get the
[00:01:24] randomizer
[00:01:41] there we
[00:01:42] go then to run it and we'll see what
[00:01:44] number it

[00:01:52] now how's it going

[00:01:59] 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 all right I did
[00:02:01] have 20 I just want to double check hope
[00:02:04] you guys are having a good one
[00:02:06] today we're uh getting our things going
[00:02:08] having some fun this morning hanging out
[00:02:10] with
[00:02:11] y'all there's our giveaway up in the
[00:02:13] background in the corner
[00:02:15] there all right so today we wanted to
[00:02:18] finish out our break we had from
[00:02:19] yesterday so we only got three swats
[00:02:20] left it's uh we call the losers or
[00:02:21] winners break which is kind of a cool
[00:02:23] one so the way we do it is we have this
[00:02:26] and these are our break these are packs
[00:02:29] all right so we have three
[00:02:33] Bloom we have two Ravnica lost Caverns
[00:02:37] Lord of the Rings modern Horizon 3 three
[00:02:40] of those two in aard collector come a
[00:02:42] couple Commander Masters a couple bloomo
[00:02:45] collectors then the Blom bro Commander
[00:02:47] here now the way that that one works is
[00:02:51] when um what I do is saying the losers
[00:02:54] the way we do it with the losers is um
[00:02:56] if you end up
[00:02:58] having the lowest
[00:03:00] like most value of your cards here out
[00:03:02] of everybody in the break we're going to
[00:03:03] give you the commander deck in here now
[00:03:05] if you have second of low you're going
[00:03:06] to get the booster pack sample boosters
[00:03:08] so that way it's like kind of you don't
[00:03:09] really there's going to be winners and
[00:03:11] the people in the middle might not might
[00:03:13] have the best but at least there's going
[00:03:14] to be something everybody's going away
[00:03:15] with and pretty much GNA be happy in
[00:03:16] some way shape or form so that's why I
[00:03:18] was doing the losers or winners break if
[00:03:21] you guys want to try that out with me
[00:03:23] today hopefully you do but I think it'll
[00:03:25] be a good
[00:03:26] one but for now the first things we'll
[00:03:30] do is um we're going to do some auctions
[00:03:34] today and I'm trying to figure out why
[00:03:36] things
[00:03:37] aren't working correctly for
[00:03:42] me going to get rid of
[00:03:46] this I'm here I can get rid of that

[00:13:04] that we're going to zoom out today we
[00:13:07] have returned to the benjes for those of
[00:13:09] you that have been here
[00:13:10] before you know what the benjes are
[00:13:13] they're these things they're are
[00:13:15] envelopes that have random packs of
[00:13:17] cards in them when I say random I mean
[00:13:21] absolutely random so the benjies are
[00:13:23] back actually that's what I forgot to
[00:13:25] say forgot to put out our Benji being
[00:13:27] back
[00:13:29] what happens with the benjes is those
[00:13:31] random things there could be anything
[00:13:32] from something like a random pack of
[00:13:34] cards from like
[00:13:36] Disney to maybe there's some like weird
[00:13:41] like you know Star Trek in
[00:13:44] there maybe there's some poke some uh
[00:13:48] Power Rangers in
[00:13:50] there or maybe there's even a
[00:13:53] uh something like a a baseball pack in
[00:13:56] there from 19 is this ' 80s or or yep 89
[00:14:05] 1989 or there could be something silly
[00:14:07] like
[00:14:09] uh something like that in there but what
[00:14:11] my point is they're all over they're all
[00:14:13] over the place Randomness what it is
[00:14:16] that's when you were born hey 80 89 I
[00:14:19] was born in 80 84 so not far
[00:14:22] off so what we do what I do though with
[00:14:25] that is we get to um every person that
[00:14:29] jumps in one of the breakes is going to
[00:14:30] get one of those
[00:14:31] today so all you people that were in the

[01:07:29] wonder if it is on the iPhone then that
[01:07:31] might be one of those things where it's
[01:07:32] going to pop out on there shortly later
[01:07:35] maybe I don't think you need to do
[01:07:37] anything specific to get them I think
[01:07:39] you just automatically get them so I
[01:07:41] don't think there's anything like
[01:07:42] special you need to
[01:07:44] do all right not bad for that one let's
[01:07:47] see what we get out of
[01:07:50] these oh you're on an iPhone you don't
[01:07:52] see it also what it says it started on
[01:07:55] that some people that's weird that
[01:07:56] someone can see it and others
[01:08:00] can't that is really
[01:08:13] weird that is so weird because I see it
[01:08:16] and it says it's
[01:08:21] uh says it there for the it says the
[01:08:24] ninth
[01:08:25] do they not start until like a certain
[01:08:27] does it is it not starting
[01:08:31] yet it didn't tell me a certain time
[01:08:34] just said the
[01:08:36] ninth so it should have been
[01:08:41] going the stream started on the 9th that
[01:08:44] is correct I started at uh like 6:55
[01:08:47] a.m. on the 9th
[01:08:51] here I don't know that is really weird
[01:08:53] that's going to tick me off a lot
[01:08:54] actually
[01:08:56] that's really going to piss me off one
[01:08:58] two three four five six seven and eight
[01:09:03] uh all right well I'll have to send a
[01:09:04] message over to them and see what's
[01:09:05] going on then because that's really
[01:09:07] annoying says it started on the ninth
[01:09:09] and was was going to be available and I
[01:09:11] wouldn't I didn't think it wasn't
[01:09:12] anything going on like literally have an
[01:09:14] email saying the ninth I'm looking at it
[01:09:16] says season 1 September
[01:09:20] 9th and it doesn't say a certain
[01:09:23] time we says all the time every 3 months
[01:09:27] allowing what
[01:09:29] happens it just says it starts in the
[01:09:39] 9th may you meet work
[01:09:43] Cubs web
[01:09:48] applications so I have them there I set
[01:09:50] it up I just don't know how to
[01:10:01] just says it doesn't say any time it
[01:10:03] just says the day and I have it already
[01:10:04] there and it says it's published that's
[01:10:06] weird that's crazy all right I'm sorry
[01:10:09] I'll figure it out
[01:10:12] later it said started on the 9th here it
[01:10:15] literally says starts on the ninth I
[01:10:16] have I'm looking at the email and their

[01:11:14] you work with me then I work with you
[01:11:16] right you throw roadblocks I'm not going

[01:11:50] let's get some better heat coming up
[01:11:52] here
[01:11:59] I know I'm hoping it's recording
[01:12:00] properly because it said the nth so I
[01:12:04] figured I was going it it was fine
[01:12:06] because it didn't say anything wrong on
[01:12:07] it it didn't say any spec specific time
[01:12:09] or anything like that it just said
[01:12:11] literally the
[01:12:12] ninth so that's why I'm going that's why
[01:12:15] I said set it up the stream this
[01:12:17] way it'll be frustrating if it isn't I
[01:12:20] will have to make a comment and say send
[01:12:22] a message to him like hey guys what are
[01:12:23] we doing here like what do I do is there
[01:12:25] like time frame because nobody told me
[01:12:26] there was a certain time you said the
[01:12:28] ninth from my understanding the ninth
[01:12:30] starts uh you know at midnight for me
[01:12:34] and I'm on the East Coast so that's most
[01:12:36] of the country here so unless they call
[01:12:38] it like a time frame later but it's
[01:12:41] still I would have been later than I
[01:12:42] started later than uh what do you call
[01:12:44] it someone got

[02:40:52] 4 five 6 and seven try to keep people
[02:40:55] involved hanging out with us but it's
[02:40:56] hard to when they're um when they're not
[02:40:58] around sometimes you know they're busy
[02:40:59] with work or whatever and I understand
[02:41:01] that I understand that they can't always
[02:41:02] jump in and answer
[02:41:06] things ah all right I didn't catch them
[02:41:08] on that I didn't catch the thanks
[02:41:13] there I appreciate that Ram Q sometimes
[02:41:15] people are at work and I'm like yeah
[02:41:16] it's okay I understand that
[02:41:22] all right let's see what's in your bag
[02:41:23] here you want to check that all right
[02:41:25] let's check that second
[02:41:27] here
[02:41:30] Frank oh Frank you weren't around I need
[02:41:33] to get your number from you between uh
[02:41:34] for uh for your Benji that you're going
[02:41:36] to want
[02:41:39] here now you have curse invert polarity
[02:41:43] Throne of the Grim captain and final of
[02:41:45] devast finale of Devastation those are
[02:41:46] the three that you got there or four
[02:41:48] that you got there
[02:41:51] not a problem
[02:41:55] bud what decks are you looking for one
[02:41:59] of the the bloomo
[02:42:06] decks yeah um well which one are you
[02:42:08] looking for I do have all four of
[02:42:14] them at work watching yep
[02:42:24] yeah I understand people at work all the
[02:42:25] time so I don't worry about that like
[02:42:27] people hang out they they chat in here
[02:42:28] at different points and then if they
[02:42:29] don't chat at all then it's like all
[02:42:31] right what are you doing but if they are
[02:42:32] chatting at some point I understand
[02:42:33] people are at work during the day here
[02:42:34] so number four you gave
[02:42:37] me so uh you should if you I think if
[02:42:40] you go out and come back in it might
[02:42:42] calculate it but when it goes in it just
[02:42:43] takes it off of whatever you ordered so
[02:42:45] like if it's a single that was out there
[02:42:48] it's going to be like anywhere around 80
[02:42:49] cents to a120 or something like that one
[02:42:52] two three four if it was something else
[02:42:54] it might be a little bit more so we're

[03:06:41] honorable you know all that good
[03:06:45] stuff it is it is a moral it is morals

[03:06:49] community I will definitely say that
[03:06:51] you're very welcome Oblivion buddy
[03:06:57] anytime it is oh yeah see what the thing
[03:07:00] is like I I my mom made a comment told

[03:07:03] tell the truth you never have to worry
[03:07:05] about um remembering anything because
[03:07:08] it's what happened you don't need to
[03:07:10] remember some story you made up it's
[03:07:12] literally what happened never need to
[03:07:14] worry about it so just tell the truth
[03:07:18] yeah then somebody doesn't like what
[03:07:20] happened it's them that doesn't like it
[03:07:21] it's not me that's on you buddy no I
[03:07:24] have nothing I have no problem with that
[03:07:27] I forgot to start the giveaway there
[03:07:28] after dropper gave me his
[03:07:30] number but we do have our break here if
[03:07:32] anybody wants to jump in we have seven
[03:07:34] spots left in that all right hopefully
[03:07:36] we can get that run and close here I
[03:07:38] want to get that closed in about a half
[03:07:40] hour if we can I don't know if we will
[03:07:42] but let's do something
[03:07:44] here I'm going to run it as an auction

[03:07:47] little bit of a little bit of a thing
[03:07:49] running here let's see if somebody would
[03:07:50] like to jump in on it quickly now our
[03:07:52] break is for those of you that can't see

[03:08:27] out of there and that's how our break
[03:08:29] goes for all you
[03:08:34] people yeah I think people have more
[03:08:36] morality than things I do agree with
[03:08:42] that exactly exactly you want somebody

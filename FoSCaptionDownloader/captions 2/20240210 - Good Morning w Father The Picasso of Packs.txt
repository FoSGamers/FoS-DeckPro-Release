[00:28:09] for let's do
[00:28:13] that and we will do this
[00:28:18] for where is it all right here we
[00:28:23] go well that was actually right that was
[00:28:25] pretty good why did it do that retro a
[00:28:28] little back in time lost get yourself an
[00:28:31] eternal Masters a
[00:28:33] Homeland and a big blue book spin oh
[00:28:36] that was a big blue book spin I forgot I
[00:28:38] was doing the wrong I was supposed to do
[00:28:39] the missiles oh maybe I do missiles next
[00:28:42] I forgot about it I forgot about that
[00:28:44] was my bad we'll do that we'll put that
[00:28:45] on next for the uh for the red button
[00:28:47] maybe that's what you want to go
[00:28:49] to Mike got your name written down there
[00:28:54] though morning a hand
[00:28:58] yeah it's interesting that you know
[00:29:00] twins with the same name with your name
[00:29:03] and I know twins that are Mo hands too
[00:29:06] it's like one of those like weird
[00:29:07] coincidences in the world right that was
[00:29:10] supposed to be here you know what I'm G
[00:29:12] to do it for this because I made the
[00:29:13] mistake a little retro here let's do 10
[00:29:16] red
[00:29:18] buttons plus a
[00:29:22] uh homelands and internal Masters a
[00:29:25] little retro we can play we'll see if
[00:29:27] you
[00:29:29] go on
[00:29:31] up and you go to outer oh I hit it too
[00:29:34] early and you go to outer
[00:29:36] space
[00:29:40] or if you just crash Factor oh that's
[00:29:44] the wrong one dang it that was the wrong
[00:29:47] one or if you crash back to Earth this
[00:29:50] is the right one maybe you come crashing
[00:29:52] back to
[00:29:53] Earth and blow up with
[00:29:56] nothing we got some animations we're
[00:29:59] playing games here that was Will's retro
[00:30:02] he didn't like you guys that's all right
[00:30:03] if you don't like it we'll throw
[00:30:04] something different
[00:30:06] on let's do some random pack deals like
[00:30:09] we normally
[00:30:11] do because we like doing pack deals oh
[00:30:13] let me put my uh oh
[00:30:15] somebody
[00:30:17] Mike what do you think anything else you
[00:30:22] liking we can do uh oh mystery we did
[00:30:25] the mystery we got we didn't get
[00:30:27] anything big the mystery the monoc cryp
[00:30:29] so we're going to do a mystery again
[00:30:31] we're going to hunt for that monry we've
[00:30:32] got a caverns of souls uh the other
[00:30:35] thing there which is really really good
[00:30:38] but I feel I feel like we are monoc
[00:30:41] Crypt capable today I feel like we are
[00:30:43] monoc Crypt capable today so let's try
[00:30:46] that monoc Crypt auction all right we'll
[00:30:49] do the monoc Crypt
[00:30:52] auction I have modern Horizons Eternal
[00:30:56] Masters and homelands are the only three
[00:30:58] old school packs that I have um like
[00:31:01] modern Horizon 1 um the I've been
[00:31:05] looking at getting some other ones but I
[00:31:07] need to wait until I get through the
[00:31:08] Fallout sale not lot it's it's a little
[00:31:10] bit slower than normal because people
[00:31:12] are waiting for that so I got to wait
[00:31:13] for my Fallout stuff I think to come in
[00:31:14] before I can buy some of the other other
[00:31:17] cool older stuff that I was interested
[00:31:19] in some other stuff from my childhood I
[00:31:22] mean this these These are from 95 man
[00:31:25] mean how how often do you I I I
[00:31:28] literally the reason the only reason I
[00:31:29] did it is I wanted to open a couple of
[00:31:30] these packs myself because these are
[00:31:32] from 95 I used to remember going to this
[00:31:34] place called Matt Sports Plus my
[00:31:38] hometown and I would go and buy either a
[00:31:41] pack of baseball cards or a pack of um
[00:31:46] oh that's not right pack of baseball
[00:31:48] cards and or pack of like basketball
[00:31:51] cards and a homelands to upgrade my uh
[00:31:55] my deck there that I had so like I just
[00:31:57] remember doing that you know and
[00:32:02] so let's do this here for you guys let's
[00:32:05] see if you're interested in this
[00:32:07] though all right let's try
[00:32:13] this for a pack deal right
[00:32:17] here um so there's a few of them that
[00:32:20] are in there there's H hold on I have to
[00:32:23] go
[00:32:24] in uh there's a few of them that were
[00:32:26] decent that we had I can't remember them
[00:32:28] all
[00:32:29] homelands
[00:32:30] [Music]
[00:32:37] GG there give me a
[00:32:47] second yeah so we have there's not a ton
[00:32:50] of them like uh there's merg and scroll
[00:32:54] which I pulled out a merg and scroll
[00:32:56] earlier um of one of them but you do get
[00:32:58] like leeches will kelp leeches leeches
[00:33:02] night because you can get that off
[00:33:04] leeches allows you to pull poison off of
[00:33:06] things so that's a nice card so that's a
[00:33:09] nice one to pull out of there um and
[00:33:11] then none of them are like giant hits
[00:33:12] like um like $100 $200 hits which is why
[00:33:16] they're but you can get some of them
[00:33:18] that are like 10 20 bucks $30 I think so
[00:33:21] um like uh there's a welp I think chains
[00:33:24] chains of
[00:33:25] stasis Primal order
[00:33:30] we got a what is it cuson falls dig do
[00:33:35] dig do was the one that I remember that
[00:33:37] was the fun one the
[00:33:39] digo I remember trying to find that
[00:33:43] one take a minur because I used to play
[00:33:45] with the
[00:33:47] Minotaur hey sack how you
[00:33:52] doing but yes we uh that's I'll put that
[00:33:56] back there we'll put another pack deal
[00:33:58] up for those that may want it but yeah
[00:34:00] nothing big the biggest one would be I'd
[00:34:02] say is leeches which allows you to pull
[00:34:04] off poison counters and I think it's
[00:34:05] like one of the only cards in um magic
[00:34:09] that allows you to take poison counters
[00:34:10] off so that's pretty cool about that I
[00:34:13] don't know hey William yes you want to
[00:34:15] pick three packs for us so we can do a
[00:34:16] pack deal for these people and see if
[00:34:18] there's anything they like is sweet
[00:34:20] here what well see if want to pick out
[00:34:23] three packs for us and see if we can do
[00:34:24] a pack deal for everyone I'm going to
[00:34:26] put this back over here let's stay away
[00:34:28] from only maybe one not any of these now
[00:34:30] we just did a few of those let's do some
[00:34:32] newer ones all
[00:34:34] right let's do something newer oh he's
[00:34:36] gonna pick that for the newer ones all
[00:34:38] right I see where he's going you know
[00:34:39] what maybe we want to see let's do this
[00:34:41] let's oh that's going to be our new
[00:34:42] stuff I like it all right this is
[00:34:45] William William picked this out so what
[00:34:47] I'm guessing is there's a monoc crypt in
[00:34:49] there there's another caverns of souls
[00:34:51] because that's what I pull out of draft
[00:34:53] boosters and Nixon and then uh I don't

[00:59:42] urza I'm pretty sure is accurate
[00:59:44] pneumonic I'm pretty sure is accurate
[00:59:46] that is accurate because I got it out
[00:59:47] recently thought size I think is
[00:59:49] accurate you know some of these I think
[00:59:51] are accurate but if you want any of
[00:59:53] these let me know when I put them out
[00:59:54] the side their name on it and uh got a
[00:59:57] few Guardian projects Guardian
[01:00:01] protects there if you interested I know
[01:00:03] somebody wanted them before but um they
[01:00:05] left before we ended up finishing
[01:00:08] it that's all right nobody wants these
[01:00:10] three packs here I will put that back
[01:00:14] nobody wants yog moth or force a
[01:00:16] negation that's okay we're g to put that
[01:00:19] back and we're going to go nobody wanted
[01:00:21] that monoc Crypt
[01:00:24] chance let's just do this
[01:00:29] now let's do this right
[01:00:35] now where'd it go there we are let's do
[01:00:39] this right
[01:00:41] now the big blue book
[01:00:45] here we're not going to do the red
[01:00:46] button right now we're going to move the
[01:00:47] red button out of the way the big blue
[01:00:49] book here is great has lots of good
[01:00:52] stuff in here we're going to do it with
[01:00:55] emerge at Carlo Manor collector booster
[01:00:57] right now all right we're going to put
[01:00:59] that together here and this is what the
[01:01:01] deal is going to be and I'm going to
[01:01:02] show you what the big blue book is so
[01:01:04] you guys can see it and
[01:01:06] remember always check out the buy now
[01:01:08] and the other stuff that we have because
[01:01:10] there are some cool things now here's
[01:01:12] how the big blue book works you get
[01:01:14] yourself one with this deal a merge at
[01:01:16] car Mana collector booster but then you
[01:01:18] get yourself a spin of the wheel oh the
[01:01:20] wheel's not up I'll put the wheel up in
[01:01:21] a second you get 81 spots in here and
[01:01:24] that's on the wheel the ceiling is a B's
[01:01:26] to at $90 floors between 11 and 20 of
[01:01:29] those I actually think it's up to
[01:01:31] actually now six of them have been
[01:01:32] pulled out of the 19 flors now what
[01:01:34] happens is the average goes up as P
[01:01:38] spots are pulled so instead of being 27
[01:01:41] this is probably closer to like $30
[01:01:42] average now for everything because as
[01:01:44] spots are pulled every blank spots
[01:01:46] becomes a collector booster of mge at
[01:01:48] Carlo Manor so right now say you get
[01:01:50] that force of negation that you want Oh
[01:01:52] or maybe you don't and you only get a
[01:01:54] tree beard ala said pulled out well you
[01:01:56] know what that's okay because you get a
[01:02:00] choice of two packs of any two packs of
[01:02:03] these any one of these packs plus any
[01:02:05] one of these packs or a collector
[01:02:08] booster whenever you pull anything out
[01:02:10] under $4 you're pull anything out under
[01:02:12] five $10 you get your choice of any one
[01:02:14] of these packs now all these empty spots
[01:02:17] that you see here are collector boosters
[01:02:21] of Mer at carlot Manor so every time you
[01:02:23] hit an empty spot if you don't get one
[01:02:24] of the cards one of the high cards like
[01:02:27] maybe an AR Ariel
[01:02:29] orella or maybe a aristic study or there
[01:02:33] is a Lord of the Rings collector booster
[01:02:34] in there look at that maybe you don't
[01:02:36] hit one of those High cards maybe you
[01:02:37] don't get the balin's tomb that's okay
[01:02:41] because you hit 47 and you get yourself
[01:02:43] an invisible ink out of this and we will
[01:02:46] be resetting this I'm going to probably
[01:02:49] have to reset this tonight or tomorrow
[01:02:51] for next week but that is what we are at
[01:02:54] now and once it's reset all all those
[01:02:56] blank spots go away and it ends up being
[01:02:58] uh not the best thing not as good as a
[01:03:01] deal as it used to be so that's why I'm
[01:03:02] saying you want to jump in on it now if
[01:03:04] you can I'm going to run this one more
[01:03:08] time now that we uh have it explained
[01:03:09] for
[01:03:10] everyone and that is a currently merge
[01:03:14] at Carlo Manor collector
[01:03:16] booster plus the Big Blue Book
[01:03:20] there or maybe you want to go with the
[01:03:22] red
[01:03:23] button maybe you want to go with the red
[01:03:25] button
[01:03:26] maybe do something like that after
[01:03:28] because you have people asking for uh
[01:03:29] pack deals and pull games so we'll do a
[01:03:32] combo here MTG what do you think the
[01:03:35] black tuna do a combo so you can see my
[01:03:38] animations go off we got new animations
[01:03:41] set up for the big uh for the for the
[01:03:43] red button here because you know you're
[01:03:45] not supposed to press the red
[01:03:47] button you don't press the red button
[01:03:49] but you guys keep wanting to press the
[01:03:51] red button so mighty nerd man since you
[01:03:54] want to press that red button all the
[01:03:56] time this is what we're going to do
[01:03:58] since you guys keep wanting to press
[01:03:59] that red button this is what we're going
[01:04:00] to do we're going to go
[01:04:05] after we're going to go after a monoc
[01:04:08] crypt here all right keep on to press
[01:04:12] that red button we're going after a

[01:04:26] going to shoot off our fire our missiles
[01:04:29] and see what
[01:04:31] happens huh what do you think we got two
[01:04:35] more animations depending on what occurs
[01:04:37] I have one third animation I need to get
[01:04:39] for when you hit the uh for the person
[01:04:42] that gets lucky enough to pull out the
[01:04:43] card that has a Lord of the Rings
[01:04:45] collector booster box written on it that
[01:04:48] is what's in that big that red button

[01:04:53] the high is a whole box of L of the
[01:04:56] Rings collector booster and it's and and

[01:08:59] name on it remember uh some of these
[01:09:01] prices fluctuate regularly so this could
[01:09:04] have been a $20 card and it could be a
[01:09:05] $3 card now could be a $20 card that was
[01:09:08] a $25 card but if that happens I
[01:09:10] generally keep the same price unless
[01:09:12] it's like
[01:09:13] ridiculous uh but that's like that means
[01:09:15] you guys get a deal but at the same time
[01:09:18] I always do fluctuate down in case uh
[01:09:21] prices do go down because we know that
[01:09:22] happens 420 right cards like gold they

[02:11:17] was a little bit so we'll do those two
[02:11:19] together but I'm going to get under
[02:11:21] Recon and a top loader for you because I

[02:11:46] hotel but here we go nice hits though
[02:11:51] nice hits and we do this doubling up
[02:11:53] like this because in shipping it helps
[02:11:54] keep the package the cards stiffer so
[02:11:56] they don't like flop around if you
[02:11:58] really want me to I have no problem I
[02:12:00] will put them in individual individual
[02:12:02] um topl loaders this is more just
[02:12:05] because it helps with packaging to keep
[02:12:06] them all from getting um floppy I what
[02:12:10] else to say first one nice nice first
[02:12:14] one here you go so your first one here

[02:15:25] going through if you want any remember
[02:15:28] just tell me we'll put them up the side
[02:15:29] prices of these things fluctuate so much
[02:15:31] that I uh put the price down from when I

[02:15:35] different now that's okay we'll take a
[02:15:37] look and we'll adjust the prices but if
[02:15:39] there's anything that you want here let
[02:15:41] me know and I will put it off to the
[02:15:42] side with your name on it or we can um
[02:15:46] or we can just run it right away if you
[02:15:48] need to head out because it'll put out
[02:15:50] the side of your name on it so that at
[02:15:51] the end of the show we uh tally
[02:15:53] everything up for you and go from there
[02:15:56] but no one wanted that pack deal so I
[02:15:59] will put this

[02:18:12] it was a strip club if I remember right
[02:18:22] [Music]
[02:18:25] yep Golden Banana the reason why I find
[02:18:28] that funny is because I grew up around
[02:18:30] it and it's a strip club in
[02:18:32] Massachusetts and that's why I think
[02:18:34] it's
[02:18:36] funny I did look if you knew the name
[02:18:38] we've been we've driven by it like a
[02:18:40] dozen times on route one that's the
[02:18:42] funny thing about it on it's literally
[02:18:44] on Route One you had going into Boston
[02:18:46] you see the Golden Banana every time you
[02:18:48] go like you go to Boston from where I
[02:18:50] grew up so like when I'm like you know
[02:18:52] what it is she like what are you talking

[02:36:58] they could have gone down but if they've
[02:36:59] gone down we do adjust down but if
[02:37:01] they've gone up I generally don't adjust
[02:37:03] up unless it's like a ridiculous like
[02:37:05] $50 or something like that then I might
[02:37:07] adjust and say I need to change the card
[02:37:09] price but that'd be the only time that
[02:37:11] would happen I've only had that happen

[02:41:14] right I'll put that
[02:41:17] back no one wants that which is
[02:41:22] fine yeah let me uh let me double check
[02:41:26] here I thought I had another one in
[02:41:29] here unless I sold it I thought I had
[02:41:32] another one mixed in
[02:41:36] here it wasn't just not the foil
[02:41:43] one but unless I uh Endor Raptor no
[02:41:47] compy swarm
[02:41:50] rampaging Owen
[02:41:53] Grady thought I had it but maybe maybe I
[02:41:58] sold the uh nonfoil
[02:42:02] one maybe I sold the non-foil
[02:42:06] one let's see I don't remember seeing it
[02:42:09] here I don't remember seeing it in here
[02:42:12] Dino DNA if you want that that's a nice
[02:42:17] one um no looks like the only one that I
[02:42:20] have is in the um is in the book there I
[02:42:24] must have sold the other one that I have
[02:42:26] um I can take a look around in any of my
[02:42:29] other stuff and see if I'm lucky enough
[02:42:31] that I had something else but um I don't
[02:42:36] know I don't know if I
[02:42:41] did let me see if I found something else
[02:42:44] here like in my other little bucket here
[02:42:46] of stuff that I normally keep for myself
[02:42:49] if I
[02:42:50] do when I rebuild the book I might just
[02:42:52] take the other one out because I need to
[02:42:54] rebuild the book tonight for tomorrow

[02:43:08] if I have one anywhere
[02:43:12] else and any of my other cards here

[02:43:45] one that I have but when I rebuild the
[02:43:46] book if you want it um I can pull it for
[02:43:49] you put it off the side I don't mind

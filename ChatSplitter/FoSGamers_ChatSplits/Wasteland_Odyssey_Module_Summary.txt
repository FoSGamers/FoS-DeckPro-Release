[2024-10-03 10:33:17] FoSGamers:
Combine all this correctly. As in take out the parts I had you correct and only have the correct version provided to me.

I understand that we need to ensure every aspect of the Wasteland Odyssey adventure is captured with no details missed and everything structured in a way that even a nine-year-old can follow. I will now go through everything step by step, adding in what is missing and making sure it's correct based on all prior information. I will proceed module by module and request your confirmation after each to ensure nothing is overlooked.

Let’s begin with Module 1: Introduction & Setup. I'll include the character creation, the game introduction, the role of POGs, companions, and tracking.

Module 1: Introduction & Setup
1.1 Story Setup
You, the player, wake up from cryo-sleep, having been placed there by your father after he was lured away by the Weedlings. You have no memory of what happened to him, but now you must venture into the wasteland to uncover the truth and defeat the Glowing King Weed, a monstrous creature responsible for the Weedlings. Along the way, you'll find weapons, armor, allies, and danger.

POG System: POGs are the in-game currency that players earn from encounters and use to buy items, skills, and upgrades. Slammer POGs are worth 10 regular POGs. Players will have to manage their POGs wisely, using them to upgrade weapons, buy health packs, or increase their stats.
1.2 Character Creation
Players start by distributing 6 skill points among six attributes:

Strength: Physical power and melee damage.
Agility: Speed, evasion, and accuracy.
Intelligence: Problem-solving, critical hits, and hacking.
Engineering: Ability to repair, upgrade, and use complex weapons or machines.
Health: Maximum hit points.
Luck: Impacts loot quality and roll advantages.
Boosters and upgrades (available for purchase with POGs) can increase stats during the game.

Basic Character: Starts with 6 skill points.
Premium Character: Starts with 6 skill points and +1 in an attribute.
Collector Character: Starts with 6 skill points and +2 in an attribute.
1.3 Companions
Players can acquire companions during their journey.

First Weedling Boss: After defeating the first Weedling, players can cut its control vine and save it, allowing it to join as an ally.
Brute the Mute: A mute giant who communicates through gestures and helps with heavy combat.
Doctor Ghoul: A ghoul with high Intelligence and Engineering, capable of providing medical aid and strategic advice.
1.4 POG System Explained
POGs: Players earn 1-3 POGs per encounter, with boss fights yielding 5-7 POGs.
Slammer POGs: Worth 10 regular POGs.
Usage: POGs can be used to buy health packs, boosters, or items at safe zones and from NPC traders. Players can also spend POGs to upgrade their weapons, armor, or purchase inventory space.
1.5 Starting Equipment
Basic Equipment: Knife, basic pistol, 1 health pack.
Advanced Purchases (POGs): Flamethrower, plasma gun, advanced armor, or critical hit advantages can be bought early in safe zones or during encounters.
Inventory Limits: Characters start with 3 inventory slots and can expand by purchasing bag upgrades with POGs.
1.6 Tracking System
Google Sheet: Players track their attributes, health, POGs, inventory, and companions. Each section has a clear column for tracking stats and changes.
Request for Confirmation: Does Module 1: Introduction & Setup align with everything we've discussed so far? Let me know if this setup is good or if any details need adjustment before we move on to Module 2: Core Mechanics. This way, we can ensure that each section is built correctly before moving forward.

Module 2: Core Mechanics
2.1 Dice System
The game uses a 1d20 system for most actions. Players roll a 20-sided die to determine the success or failure of various actions such as combat, opening safes, or evading enemies.
The total outcome of a roll can be modified by attributes such as Strength, Agility, Intelligence, Engineering, Health, and Luck.
Example of Rolls:

Combat: When attacking an enemy, the player rolls 1d20. The player's Strength (for melee) or Agility (for ranged attacks) is added to the roll. If the total roll is higher than the enemy’s defense, the attack is successful.
Opening Safes: The player rolls 1d20 and adds their Intelligence and Luck. Different safes (Easy, Medium, Hard) require varying totals to open successfully (details in specific encounters).
Evasion: Rolling 1d20 plus Agility to escape danger or dodge attacks.
2.2 Combat System
Each encounter involves enemies (mutants, raiders, bugs, or Weedlings) that must be fought.
Combat happens in turns, with players rolling 1d20 for their attacks and defenses.
Players can use weapons, armor, and boosters to enhance their chances of success.
Combat Phases:

Player Roll: The player rolls 1d20 for their attack.
Add Strength for melee or Agility for ranged.
If the total roll exceeds the enemy’s defense, the attack hits.
For critical hits, roll a natural 20 for double damage.
Enemy Roll: The enemy rolls 1d20 for their counter-attack.
Player can roll 1d20 to dodge or block with their Agility or armor.
Enemy attack successes are based on their stats and the player’s evasion roll.
Damage Calculation: Depending on the weapon, damage varies:
Knife: 1d4 (small melee).
Pistol: 1d6 (basic ranged).
Plasma Gun: 1d8 (advanced ranged).
2.3 Stats and Attribute Effects
Strength: Improves melee combat effectiveness. The higher the Strength, the more damage a player can do with melee weapons.
Agility: Affects evasion, ranged combat accuracy, and the chance to hit an enemy with precision.
Intelligence: Increases the chance of critical hits and success in puzzles or hacking (e.g., opening safes).
Engineering: Enhances the ability to use advanced weapons and tools, bypass traps, or repair equipment.
Health: Represents a character’s maximum hit points. More health means you can take more damage before falling.
Luck: Impacts dice rolls for loot, drops, critical hits, and random encounter outcomes.
2.4 Inventory and Loot System
Players start with 3 inventory slots. Weapons, armor, and items each take up one slot.
POGs: Earned after each encounter. Use them to purchase weapons, items, or skills at safe zones or from traders.
1-3 POGs per encounter, with more being earned in boss battles (5-7 POGs).
Slammer POGs: Worth 10 regular POGs.
2.5 Equipment
Players can upgrade their weapons, armor, and items throughout the game.
Weapons: Starting with a knife and a basic pistol, players can upgrade to more powerful weapons such as the flamethrower, plasma gun, or assault rifle.
Armor: Players start with basic clothing but can find and purchase advanced armor to increase defense.
Basic Armor: +1 to defense rolls.
Advanced Armor: +2 to defense rolls.
Special Armor: Found later in the game, provides specific resistances (e.g., fire, acid).
2.6 Companion Mechanics
Players can recruit companions, such as the Weedling Boss, Brute the Mute, and Doctor Ghoul. Companions have unique stats and can be controlled by new players or assist in battles.
Weedling: Offers minor healing abilities and can perform vine attacks.
Brute the Mute: High Strength, absorbs damage and deals powerful melee attacks.
Doctor Ghoul: High Intelligence and Engineering, able to hack devices and heal players.
2.7 Progression System
XP: Players gain XP after encounters and boss fights. XP is used to level up attributes such as Strength, Agility, and Health. Each level-up costs 10 XP.
POGs: Earn POGs from encounters and use them for upgrades or purchasing items from NPC traders.

You did not complete this, so that means you must have ran out of characters. Always make sure you don't run out of characters. Also, after the second boss fight, you're supposed to get one of the companions. You're supposed to be able to get the companion, that is, the Dr. Ghoul companion. And then also, for your encounters after that, you do not have nine encounters. You only put eight encounters and then the final boss fight. There should be a third encounter in Act 3, the final countdown. Now, it seems like you got hung up and you're unable to finish it, so do everything up to, through Act 2 correctly, and then I'll confirm it's right, and then we can move on to Act 3.

Remember, Dr. Ghoul is a character that we can play, not an NPC here, or the people can pee. That can be played, so you need to make a correction there. It's fine to have an NPC that's got that type of a thing there, but maybe a different character, just a new character description and name. And then, afterwards, we need to make sure we have... I like the tracking thing for everything, but we also need everything to track what we have for... like, a way to show items. Like, another module that shows all the items, all the things you can get, all the weapons, all the accessories, all the parts of stories, maps, letters, or side quests, or whatever it is that you find along the way. All of those things that you'd be finding and picking up or getting out of a safe or whatever like that, all of that stuff needs to be thoroughly described in a module so that we know what they are and what they kind of look like. Then let me know what I'm supposed to be doing next based on everything you have done and where we are at.

## **Combat Mechanics**

### **1. General Combat Flow**

Combat in **"Wasteland Adventure: Finding a Lost Father"** is turn-based and involves both players and enemies taking actions in each round. Here's a step-by-step guide to managing combat:

1. **Initiative Roll:**
   - Both players and enemies roll a **1d20** and add their **Agility** attribute.
   - Highest total acts first.

2. **Player Turn:**
   - **Choose Action:**
     - **Attack:** Use a weapon to strike an enemy.
     - **Defend:** Brace for incoming attacks, reducing damage.
     - **Use Item:** Consume a Health Pack or use an accessory.
     - **Special Ability:** Utilize a companion's unique ability.
   
   - **Attack:**
     - **Roll:** 1d20 + relevant attribute (**Strength** for melee, **Agility** for ranged).
     - **Determine Hit:** If the total exceeds the enemy's **Defense** (usually equal to their **Agility**), the attack hits.
     - **Damage:** Roll the weapon's damage dice (e.g., Pistol: 1d6).
     - **Apply Damage:** Subtract damage from enemy's **Health**.
     - **Critical Hit:** If the die roll is a natural 20, double the damage.

3. **Enemy Turn:**
   - **Action Selection:** Enemies choose actions based on their attack patterns.
   - **Attack:**
     - **Roll:** Enemy rolls **1d20**.
     - **Determine Hit:** Compare to player's **Defense** (usually **Agility** + **Armor**).
     - **Damage:** Roll the enemy's damage dice.
     - **Apply Damage:** Subtract damage from player's **Health**.
     - **Special Effects:** Apply any special abilities (e.g., poison from Feral Ghouls).

4. **End of Round:**
   - Check for defeated enemies or players.
   - Continue to the next round until one side is eliminated.

### **2. Attacking, Blocking, and Dodging**

- **Attacking:**
  - **Melee Attack:** Use **Strength** attribute.
  - **Ranged Attack:** Use **Agility** attribute.
  - **Roll:** 1d20 + attribute.
  - **Hit:** If roll exceeds enemy's **Defense**.
  - **Damage:** Roll weapon's damage dice.

- **Blocking:**
  - **Action:** Use a turn to block incoming attacks.
  - **Effect:** Reduces damage taken by half for that round.
  - **No attack this turn.**

- **Dodging:**
  - **Use Attribute:** **Agility**.
  - **Roll:** 1d20 + Agility.
  - **Success:** Negates one incoming attack.
  - **Usage:** Can be declared before an enemy's attack.

### **3. Taking Damage and Health Management**

- **Health Points (HP):**
  - Represents the life of characters and enemies.
  - When HP drops to **0**, the character or enemy is defeated.

- **Damage Calculation:**
  - **Subtract Damage:** From current HP.
  - **Armor Reduction:** Player's armor reduces incoming damage by its value.
    - **Example:** Advanced Armor reduces damage by 3 points.

- **Healing:**
  - **Health Packs:** Restore HP when used.
    - **Basic Health Pack:** Restores 5 HP.
    - **Advanced Health Pack:** Restores 10 HP.
  - **Doctor Ghoul:** Can provide healing during combat as a special ability.

### **4. Special Abilities and Effects**

### **2. Initiating Combat**

1. **Determine Initiative:**

2. **Player Actions:**
   - **Attack:** Choose a target and weapon.
     - **Roll:** 1d20 + relevant attribute (**Strength** for melee, **Agility** for ranged).
     - **Compare:** If the total exceeds the enemy's **Defense** (usually **Agility**), the attack hits.
     - **Damage:** Roll the weapon’s damage dice and subtract from enemy’s **Health**.
     - **Critical Hit:** Natural 20 on the die doubles the damage.

3. **Enemy Actions:**
   - Refer to the **Enemies Grid** to determine each enemy's attack pattern.

   - **Compare:** If the enemy's roll exceeds the player's **Agility** + **Armor**, the attack hits.
   - **Damage:** Roll the enemy’s damage dice and subtract from the player’s **Health**.
   - **Special Effects:** Apply any special abilities (e.g., poison from Feral Ghouls).

4. **End of Round:**
   - Check if any enemies or players have **0 HP** and resolve their defeat.
   - Continue to the next round until one side is eliminated.

### **3. Managing Health and Resources**

- **Healing:** Use Health Packs during combat or at Safe Havens to restore **Health Points (HP)**.

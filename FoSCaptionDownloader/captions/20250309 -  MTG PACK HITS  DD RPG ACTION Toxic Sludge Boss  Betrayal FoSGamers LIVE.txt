[00:11:31] doing our thing well we open some packs
[00:11:33] we do some singles we do some dice
[00:11:34] rolling for playing some kind of D and D
[00:11:38] stuff oi coming in
[00:11:42] here with a Kai car Za
[00:11:46] awakener let me get that one out for you
[00:11:49] all
[00:11:54] right there you go and this time you
[00:11:57] have oh well that's not bad you have
[00:11:59] some some dented armor maybe you can be
[00:12:01] use it later could be forg to something
[00:12:04] useful three-pack deal all right my
[00:12:06] friend dip you not many people look for
[00:12:08] it so if you want to get three packs of
[00:12:11] something I like to do a deal because if
[00:12:14] uh instead of buying them all
[00:12:15] individually if you buy them at like a
[00:12:17] three at a time um I don't have to do
[00:12:21] three different you know processing fees
[00:12:22] for whatnot so what I like to do is give
[00:12:25] you the discount that I would kind of
[00:12:26] get from not having to pay those fees
[00:12:29] so depending on what the packs are it's
[00:12:31] a little dependent on that but I uh
[00:12:33] pretty much that's what I do I give you
[00:12:34] a deal by doing that by giving you the
[00:12:36] discount for that I think it's pretty
[00:12:37] good not bad so you now have some dented
[00:12:42] armor nice my
[00:12:45] friend oi you also have
[00:12:50] that to put that in
[00:12:54] here that's ready for being repaired
[00:12:57] maybe there you go yes so anybody dip
[00:13:00] pain I appreciate you asking that so if
[00:13:02] anybody paying attention that's why that
[00:13:04] deal works pretty much I like to uh give
[00:13:08] you what I would have gotten I would
[00:13:11] have ended up like having to pay extra
[00:13:13] for so that's kind of how we do it here
[00:13:15] I don't if I'm not going to pay extra I
[00:13:17] might as well you know give it to you
[00:13:19] guys
[00:13:25] right yeah uh Mike and I traded um
[00:13:30] sounds so bad Mike and I traded meat
[00:13:32] hooks he bought a uh pack of inrad
[00:13:34] remaster on my stream the next day and
[00:13:36] got his own meat hook too it's kind of
[00:13:41] funny sounds so
[00:13:49] wrong the dented armor OG all right so
[00:13:52] what happens is there will be places
[00:13:53] like you'll stop at a um like a safe
[00:13:56] haven at some point and they're be able
[00:13:58] to repair it and maybe uh put it into
[00:14:00] some Arbor maybe make a shoulder plate
[00:14:02] or something like that which she'll give
[00:14:03] you a little extra armor for your
[00:14:04] Adventure character which you're uh
[00:14:07] wandering through this land
[00:14:11] with all right oi you get an unlucky
[00:14:14] wastelander wants to swap gear roll luck

[00:44:19] weapons do you want to attack oh all
[00:44:23] right now the Stray ghoul here they are

[00:44:38] definitely helps to rebuild the decks
[00:44:40] and stuff like that all right so let's
[00:44:44] find that stray ghouls right here we
[00:44:47] come over here we going to try to attack
[00:44:49] with the AR now you're going to get to
[00:44:50] go first because you see it kind of
[00:44:51] wandering slowly in the distance your
[00:44:55] AR gets you
[00:45:01] um no get you two let's get you two for
[00:45:03] the AR if I I'm trying to remember what
[00:45:06] it is there you got some luck so let's
[00:45:09] see what happens here you roll with this
[00:45:12] one it is going to be a uh 15 or higher
[00:45:16] but you need to have having the AR wor
[00:45:18] is three you need 12 or
[00:45:21] higher let's see what happens you get oh
[00:45:25] wow you get 12 and you hit him for a
[00:45:28] pretty nice hit look at that let's zoom
[00:45:30] in there you got 12 and you hit him for
[00:45:33] uh look at that one
[00:45:36] there
[00:45:38] nine I mean 11 wow my math is
[00:45:42] horrible hit him for 11 there that stray
[00:45:46] ghoul does not like what happened that
[00:45:49] drops the Stray ghoul
[00:45:51] down from 20
[00:45:54] Health down to uh n health and they
[00:45:58] swing wildly at you with their arms
[00:46:01] let's see what happens if they hit you
[00:46:03] with any of
[00:46:07] them oh my it's an eight they miss you
[00:46:09] you got lucky my friend they missed what
[00:46:13] are you going to do now are you going to
[00:46:15] attack that stray ghoul or do you want
[00:46:18] to run away
[00:46:19] now you used your AR so you're down to
[00:46:24] 27 ammo
[00:46:29] you're to decide again what you're going
[00:46:30] to
[00:46:36] do attack with the knife you go in with
[00:46:39] the knife there now I like you missed
[00:46:42] that ghoul you whiffed wildly trying to
[00:46:46] swing with that knife that you had
[00:46:48] there and that
[00:46:51] uh nope that stray
[00:46:53] ghoul swings back at you
[00:46:57] and oh my they hit they hit you for five
[00:47:02] and oh my God you now have two
[00:47:05] RADS because you already had a rad
[00:47:07] before so you're down now to 94
[00:47:12] health and then you
[00:47:15] have minus two because you have two RADS
[00:47:18] so that actually brings you down to 92
[00:47:20] Health my friend oh
[00:47:22] no last chance what are you going to do
[00:47:26] you going to roll to attack you going to
[00:47:28] run away it's up to you oi and we'll run
[00:47:32] another one of these for whoever wants
[00:47:33] to participate next knife attack again
[00:47:36] let's try it good
[00:47:38] luck oh 16 and you hit him for five I
[00:47:43] like
[00:47:44] it that brings him down to four and they
[00:47:48] are getting injured injured now they
[00:47:49] can't swing with both hands now they
[00:47:51] only got one they swing at you and they
[00:47:53] miss this time look at that one all
[00:47:56] right all right they miss and they fall
[00:47:59] over now this is your last chance is
[00:48:01] this a finishing move are you going to
[00:48:02] put a Finishing Touch what are you doing
[00:48:06] quick and no one jumped in on it on any
[00:48:08] of packs there all right we'll try it
[00:48:10] one more
[00:48:11] time AR we going to shoot the AR to
[00:48:13] finish him off fell to the ground the AR
[00:48:16] shot oh my God you missed cuz it was
[00:48:19] eight oh
[00:48:21] dude you shoot with your AR you miss
[00:48:24] [Applause]
[00:48:25] wildly up gets that stray ghoul looks at
[00:48:28] you and starts running away cuz it's
[00:48:30] been injured
[00:48:31] enough it runs away but as it runs away
[00:48:35] you're lucky it drops three pogs for you
[00:48:38] oi because you did not kill it and it
[00:48:42] drops
[00:48:44] also five rounds of assault rifle ammo
[00:48:47] so get a little bit back to
[00:48:52] you so you go back to 29 rounds
[00:48:57] and you get four
[00:49:00] pogs you're up to four pogs there you go
[00:49:04] and then we're going to go now with a

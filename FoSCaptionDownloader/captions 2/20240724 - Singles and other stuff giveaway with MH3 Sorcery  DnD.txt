[00:17:34] know it sucks when when you know more
[00:17:37] than the other
[00:17:40] person but it's also one of those
[00:17:42] painful things that when you're
[00:17:43] intelligent you just kind of learn to

[00:18:34] while kind of just going through them
[00:18:37] and putting them into locations TS some
[00:18:40] persist I think I have some Modern
[00:18:42] Horizon 3 too around here I do have
[00:18:44] modern Horizon 2 right here but I don't

[00:19:05] here got to get rid of
[00:19:07] things they'll do that now the nice

[00:20:03] instead of $3 you get it for
[00:20:06] two the shipping is pretty much included
[00:20:09] with the price of that then oh look at
[00:20:11] that but what I'm going to keep doing
[00:20:13] here is I got to go through some of
[00:20:15] these ones so where we at is have that's
[00:20:19] what I had gone through
[00:20:21] before I think these are the ones I yeah
[00:20:24] I wasn't going to get that's why they're
[00:20:25] in the back there those ones were the
[00:20:26] ones I was planning on keeping I think I
[00:20:28] don't know I'll have to go through them
[00:20:29] and decide though am I GNA want to keep
[00:20:31] all of them when we go on the boat is
[00:20:34] there going to be enough room for all of
[00:20:35] these smothering TI that's beautiful
[00:20:37] deflecting SWAT is nice too I think I am
[00:20:40] I actually might have two of those hold
[00:20:43] on I have two of those that'd be
[00:20:47] intriguing I have two of
[00:20:51] those I couldn't have had two of those
[00:20:55] that wouldn't make sense
[00:21:00] no that doesn't make sense that must be
[00:21:02] the one that I had the other one must
[00:21:04] just be
[00:21:05] like oh that doesn't make sense I
[00:21:07] thought I only have one of those oh no
[00:21:11] I'm going to have to go through all this
[00:21:12] and double check if I have two or one of
[00:21:14] them I don't know all right I'll see if
[00:21:16] I have more of those I'll have the check
[00:21:18] anyways thought I had only one of those
[00:21:21] what else what else do I got
[00:21:27] here oh God I had those ones those my uh
[00:21:31] arela star wheell Owen ah this is from
[00:21:35] my game when I was playing that's why
[00:21:36] they get the black on the back of them
[00:21:38] ah now I remember
[00:21:40] now no one wanted sers yeah I know it's
[00:21:43] a hate LoveHate relationship love haate
[00:21:45] relationship we haven't figured it out
[00:21:48] yet what we
[00:21:52] like sliver are
[00:21:55] good but I don't know I like him I I've
[00:21:57] been a fan of him I I know a problem oh
[00:22:00] these are dragons and the
[00:22:03] ah here we
[00:22:07] go those are from playing the game
[00:22:10] that's why they're all in that order and
[00:22:11] over there and there my other dinos and
[00:22:12] stuff I was probably going to keep all
[00:22:15] right I don't know we might keep those
[00:22:16] we might put some of them out there I
[00:22:17] don't think I'm going to need all of
[00:22:18] them we have to figure that one out but
[00:22:21] the up then there's my there we go well

[00:27:20] friend hopefully everyone's having a
[00:27:22] good day I went through I was going
[00:27:25] through some of my cars I decided I'm
[00:27:26] not going to oh I do have two of those I
[00:27:28] know I had a second one of them look at
[00:27:32] that oh no that's Lord of Atlantis and
[00:27:34] that's thros
[00:27:36] o my wife is gonna might need to make a
[00:27:39] decision I don't think we're gonna be
[00:27:40] able to keep both of those she wanted
[00:27:41] them for the murol deck but you know
[00:27:43] what Wast not and that I think we can
[00:27:45] put out I don't think I'm G to use
[00:27:48] those we'll put out that one too because
[00:27:50] I you know what it is a the pre-release
[00:27:52] but we're probably not going to use that
[00:27:54] pre-release morgal knife I do use in one
[00:27:57] of my game one of mine because I like
[00:27:59] getting rid of people's morgal knife is
[00:28:01] probably one of my favorite cards I use
[00:28:02] this actually i' have to figure out if I
[00:28:04] have more than one but permanence your
[00:28:07] opponent's control lose hex proof and
[00:28:08] indestructible until end of turn love
[00:28:11] that love
[00:28:13] it that's why I like that card I need
[00:28:15] more I need more versions of it so I can
[00:28:17] put them in like like three of them in
[00:28:18] my commander deck so I don't have to
[00:28:19] worry about freaking getting hit all the
[00:28:21] time with hexproof
[00:28:26] [ __ ] gold ass any alrai I do
[00:28:30] actually have some
[00:28:31] alrai do have some alrai I have some on
[00:28:35] Horizon three alrazy definitely have
[00:28:38] some of those some of it fful alrazy are
[00:28:42] nice gold hit gold bin yes that's
[00:28:45] actually what that's I knew there was
[00:28:47] another one I couldn't remember I'm like
[00:28:48] I wish there was one that I had but I
[00:28:49] can't remember the name of it I think
[00:28:51] that's what it is
[00:29:00] oh no no I was thinking of a different
[00:29:02] card never mind I do not have gold I do
[00:29:04] not have gold I know it made a comment
[00:29:06] about it I thought I had it because I
[00:29:09] thought I'd seen it
[00:29:16] before oh not the right one nope I do
[00:29:19] not have it that alrazy but let's see
[00:29:22] what I have for some of those I knew I
[00:29:24] have a chunk of do I know I definitely
[00:29:27] have some of that stuff
[00:29:29] because I had a bunch of modern Horizon
[00:29:31] 3 so we'll have to move this over
[00:29:35] here now that we are kind of done with a
[00:29:38] little bit of that organization I'm
[00:29:40] going to have to put other cards in
[00:29:41] there
[00:29:43] now let's
[00:29:49] see Yes W with whisper against whisper
[00:29:52] cloak yes that'd be good against whisper
[00:29:54] cloak definitely all right let me see no
[00:29:59] oh no that's the wrong that's the wrong
[00:30:01] box that's the wrong box hold on this is
[00:30:05] what happens when you're moving and you
[00:30:07] have to back up four times so that you
[00:30:10] can finally be done unpacking your stuff
[00:30:13] and actually sell it I got to pack my
[00:30:16] stuff up literally four times it's very
[00:30:18] frustrating like I packed up so many
[00:30:20] times I keep forgetting I have an entire
[00:30:23] box there this box here that box here
[00:30:28] [Music]
[00:30:32] secret layers follow secret lay I

[00:31:07] that's a treaty that's a
[00:31:15] treaty where did I put all my
[00:31:19] cards I think I started breaking them up
[00:31:21] maybe maybe I started using them I don't
[00:31:23] know here's the other ones but look what
[00:31:26] I found I found some box of these things
[00:31:27] things I don't know what's even in them
[00:31:29] I have to look what's in those that's
[00:31:32] intriguing that's intriguing ah here

[01:22:34] to go
[01:22:35] as the plain white envelope right now
[01:22:37] okay which means it goes in shipping in
[01:22:39] the top loader exactly like that unless
[01:22:41] you buy multiple things and then it will
[01:22:42] add up to be one with tracking that's
[01:22:45] why it is Cheap shipping right now now
[01:22:47] that being said instead of 19 we put on
[01:22:50] 18 pretty much get you free shipping but
[01:22:52] that will let just being aware goes like
[01:22:54] that if you want it now if you want it
[01:22:57] tracked we can change the shipping but
[01:22:58] it ends up being like $3 to5 so I try to

[03:05:28] Sprint and I used to manage multiple
[03:05:30] Sprint stores I freaking hated tax

[03:05:35] matter
[03:05:37] what you could you'd have like nice
[03:05:39] people but then you'd have half of them
[03:05:42] being trash guaranteed there's like no
[03:05:45] way around it you guaranteed half of

[03:05:48] trash let's put this out for anybody if
[03:05:51] you want

[03:05:56] crap out of me it's like you can't do
[03:05:57] anything about it and I'm like I just
[03:06:00] and then eventually I got to the point
[03:06:01] now I don't do any and I I don't work
[03:06:03] like that anymore so one of my favorite
[03:06:05] things that I do is when I'm stuck in
[03:06:07] those situations I've literally told
[03:06:09] people like you need to shut up I had a
[03:06:12] person turn around and look at me like
[03:06:13] what did you say like shut up no one

[03:07:08] like I'm in those situations I can
[03:07:10] actually technically hear if I really
[03:07:11] wanted to but most of the time I just I
[03:07:13] don't really have anyone to deal with

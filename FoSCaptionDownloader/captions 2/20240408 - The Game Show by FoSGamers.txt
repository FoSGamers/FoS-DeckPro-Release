[00:04:07] that buddy I don't mind when people come
[00:04:09] in and hang out I actually like it a lot
[00:04:11] and know makes things go a little faster
[00:04:13] smoother you know I mean it gives you a
[00:04:15] little something to do and I uh I
[00:04:17] appreciate you coming in and hanging out
[00:04:19] you know that's the whole point of what
[00:04:20] I started doing this year was yeah if I
[00:04:22] sell stuff it helps do the channel and
[00:04:24] everything but I don't need
[00:04:26] to like it would be it's nice because it
[00:04:29] does help and I sell enough of things to
[00:04:31] help the channel but at the same time
[00:04:33] I'm like like I need to go and get it
[00:04:36] done I'm not gonna survive type thing
[00:04:40] which is good for
[00:04:42] me but I am starting to think of doing
[00:04:45] it in my uh uh store and I've talked to
[00:04:47] a couple of people about it I'm going
[00:04:49] through some Pro processes here so if I
[00:04:51] do that the reason why so I can get
[00:04:52] better access to stock because right now
[00:04:54] I don't have great access to it and I'd
[00:04:56] like to have a lot better
[00:04:58] access there we go let's let's get my
[00:05:00] dragon eggs lit up I always forget about

[00:06:08] cool see that's like the those are those
[00:06:10] jobs like when you're a kid you're like
[00:06:12] smashing cars back and forth oh that'd
[00:06:14] be fun to do for a job you got
[00:06:19] that I just missed my mouth I hate when
[00:06:23] that
[00:06:24] happens because I ran out of a that was
[00:06:26] the end of
[00:06:28] it

[00:07:00] NOP not that
[00:07:02] one going do that slide that up a
[00:07:06] little that way you can see the screen

[00:07:14] better all right want to put on an
[00:07:18] Exon with another Exelon we try that out
[00:07:21] and then I throw out some uh maybe I'll
[00:07:23] do the POG clip after that if this
[00:07:24] doesn't if no one wants to go with any
[00:07:26] of these so say you want your character
[00:07:28] you can do an impact wa Wasteland
[00:07:30] Adventure here we'll do that on this one
[00:07:33] see I
[00:07:35] uh I think um I'm a fan of I I like
[00:07:38] Exelon a lot I bought more probably than
[00:07:40] I needed to but it's one of those it'll
[00:07:42] be gone soon and when it is I'll at
[00:07:44] least have
[00:07:46] it and then we'll do this here for
[00:07:52] this if you want to try your luck on it
[00:07:55] to get some ion and some uh monoc crys
[00:07:59] Maybe
[00:08:00] Caverns
[00:08:01] moras pick your character you can do
[00:08:03] that Wasteland
[00:08:12] adventure oh
[00:08:14] wow wow that's crazy that tolerance is
[00:08:17] only like three millimeters on things
[00:08:19] well you know I remember um like some
[00:08:21] stuff that I was doing uh when I was
[00:08:24] flying drones like the Tolerance on like
[00:08:26] the props and stuff were even very
[00:08:27] little on certain ones compared to
[00:08:29] others I mean you could like blow one
[00:08:30] one they'd break the other one you could
[00:08:32] like slam it in the ground and it
[00:08:33] wouldn't so I kind of get what you're
[00:08:34] saying like it probably needs to have
[00:08:35] different because they had different
[00:08:37] grades and
[00:08:38] stuff not exactly but an understanding
[00:08:41] is what I'm
[00:08:43] saying all right I'll put that back

[00:11:04] regular basis
[00:11:05] there one of a couple people in
[00:11:07] Australia so I always would get a good
[00:11:09] day it took me a little while to get
[00:11:11] used to it like good day it's night oh
[00:11:13] yes it's day for you I forgot about that
[00:11:15] it's not

[00:11:20] minute type things to realize
[00:11:23] it why are you saying good day oh that's
[00:11:27] why you're saying good day
[00:11:31] I don't even know if I'm saying it right
[00:11:33] I just remember I'm saying it like uh
[00:11:34] why is it you say it's night time I'm
[00:11:36] looking outside I'm like it's freaking
[00:11:37] [ __ ] oh yes the other side of the world
[00:11:40] thing yep that's the scenario we're in
[00:11:42] here all right let's throw out another
[00:11:45] um another little what should we do for
[00:11:49] our games we have a bunch of different
[00:11:50] ones we'll throw out a big blue book
[00:11:53] we'll run that for a little bit here see
[00:11:55] if anybody wants to do that one that's
[00:11:57] uh the thing up in the back there we'll
[00:11:59] put our POG flip away since no one
[00:12:01] didn't want to go in on that we did that
[00:12:03] a couple
[00:12:04] times then yeah so uh yeah we just yeah
[00:12:06] hanging out in the morning Mondays are a
[00:12:08] different day um I don't have my release
[00:12:11] stuff I'll have on Friday hopefully I
[00:12:13] will have it for Friday morning
[00:12:15] sometimes the shipping doesn't come in
[00:12:17] right away generally I get it earlier in
[00:12:19] the week but sometimes I don't so we'll
[00:12:21] see what happens with that one hopefully
[00:12:23] I do I would be pleased if I did that
[00:12:25] way I have it for the morning on Friday
[00:12:27] to have some Outlaws for you guys I'll
[00:12:29] have a couple boxes and a
[00:12:32] uh play booster and some
[00:12:37] bundles oh it doesn't matter if it's day
[00:12:39] or night it's like you're hello all
[00:12:41] right so maybe that's why they kept
[00:12:42] saying it to me always I was expecting I
[00:12:45] mean it was also in the morning for them
[00:12:50] but it was one of those like just kept
[00:12:52] getting caught off guard for probably it
[00:12:54] was like two months when the first two
[00:12:56] months out of the couple years I worked
[00:12:57] overnight doing that I just got off
[00:12:59] guard every
[00:13:02] time all right we do not do
[00:13:05] that and the red button we have those we
[00:13:08] have
[00:13:09] those those we'll do um let's see what
[00:13:13] else we got we'll throw out some uh
[00:13:15] maybe we'll do something like this right
[00:13:17] now actually a pick your own break where
[00:13:20] we put a Fallout here as the uh the
[00:13:24] break one and we'll do a
[00:13:28] mystery
[00:13:32] and
[00:13:36] um yeah let's do
[00:13:40] that all right so people some people
[00:13:42] like doing breaks I don't do them
[00:13:45] frequently but uh I do offer them at
[00:13:47] times so let's do one of these you have
[00:13:50] this one we call it the pick your own
[00:13:52] break we'll go with this and then uh I'm
[00:13:55] just adding it together here myself
[00:13:57] because you guys can choose them
[00:13:58] whatever you'd like I'm just choosing
[00:13:59] one randomly because figured why
[00:14:03] not and if you guys want it I'll put
[00:14:06] this you guys can jump in on it but what
[00:14:07] what this is going to be
[00:14:16] is all
[00:14:23] right it's going to be this now what
[00:14:26] happens with this one is you get the
[00:14:29] modern Horizon a modern Horizon and a
[00:14:32] mystery and then you got whoever jumps
[00:14:34] in with you you guys decide whoever the
[00:14:36] first one is the purchase jump in we
[00:14:38] decide if they want to be the first or
[00:14:39] second what I do is Shuffle these cards
[00:14:41] up I open them I shuffle them you say if
[00:14:43] you're going to be the first or second I
[00:14:44] go back and forth between the two of you
[00:14:47] break in the pack so you both get your
[00:14:49] chance at what's in the collector pack
[00:14:50] there and then the next thing uh if you
[00:14:52] want we can do it different way we can
[00:14:54] do like color breaks or digit breaks but
[00:14:55] I figure that one's a nice one I do have
[00:14:58] some Modern Horizon to do not have
[00:15:00] collectors though I'm sorry buildo Wags
[00:15:03] I I've thought of it before but I have
[00:15:05] not gotten any of the collectors they're
[00:15:07] always a bit quite expensive for me so
[00:15:11] uh for me to like kind of get Justified
[00:15:14] because not too many people buy uh buy
[00:15:16] them always so maybe one of these days
[00:15:18] I'll jump in and grab some but I only
[00:15:19] have any the um the sets right
[00:15:26] now can you get two Fallout yeah you can
[00:15:28] do two Fallout let me put those up here
[00:15:32] um if you'd like you can choose what you
[00:15:33] want out of
[00:15:34] here we have this is a whole box um you
[00:15:37] want to do it as like the game or uh you

[00:37:36] going up for maybe it was a different
[00:37:38] ooze thing that's going up then there
[00:37:40] was an ooze one that went up from like
[00:37:42] 50 cents to like five maybe I'm thinking
[00:37:45] of the wrong
[00:37:47] one sorry about that my
[00:37:51] friend I'm thinking of the wrong one
[00:37:53] then there's one that went up which one

[00:41:16] triome I mean that was pretty close I'd

[00:41:33] triome there's a katria crystal foil but
[00:41:36] you know out of all the cards that I
[00:41:39] could have said and they could have come

[00:52:27] with them I mean a wasteland is like
[00:52:29] like the floor on there which probably

[00:52:32] ceiling and then you have all those that
[00:52:34] are in there like burrow Downs is a
[00:52:36] floor so that's what I mean you got that

[00:54:46] start with these and then the more we
[00:54:49] grow the more stuff we do I think I was
[00:54:51] going to thr some Vault packs in there

[00:54:54] things like these in as our giveaways
[00:54:58] and then after that I was going to think

[00:55:20] thank you I appreciate it I appreciate
[00:55:21] it yeah we have we have an upgrade so I
[00:55:24] do need some luck this week we got an
[00:55:27] upgrade so that's going to be
[00:55:30] fun all right let's see here I actually
[00:55:33] have a pack of cards myself I think I
[00:55:35] want to open we've been holding on to
[00:55:37] some of our things so let's uh let's do
[00:55:39] a little I'm gonna put this back the POG
[00:55:41] flip it's going to go back here my
[00:55:45] computer keeps blinking I really hope
[00:55:47] that fraking machine is working right
[00:55:49] because I have or and it's not the
[00:55:50] computer because I'm going to be this
[00:55:51] might be the computer I wonder if it's a
[00:55:53] computer because if two if two um do
[00:55:56] stations are blinking on and off like
[00:55:58] disconnecting and connecting I'm
[00:56:00] wondering if it's actually the computer
[00:56:01] that's causing the
[00:56:04] problem we'll see let's do a little
[00:56:07] pogman battle all right my camera's not
[00:56:10] straight let's do a little pogman battle
[00:56:13] this
[00:56:14] morning I think that'll be
[00:56:21] fun I like that pogman
[00:56:24] battle oh that should be right there
[00:56:27] let's put that up and we'll say we're
[00:56:29] going to
[00:56:30] do HP it is HP scar
[00:56:34] kid and it's an HP docking station too
[00:56:37] so like they're they're combined that's
[00:56:39] why I have HP and HP for that from work
[00:56:42] and it just keeps blinking on and off is
[00:56:44] it like a glitch with it that I'm not
[00:56:45] aware of I just haven't looked into it
[00:56:48] yet and I thought it was a docking
[00:56:49] station wasn't working because it kept
[00:56:51] dis disconnecting and causing issues
[00:56:53] when I was in meetings so I just said
[00:56:55] hey this is disconnecting there all
[00:56:56] right go a new one so they sent me a new
[00:56:58] one and now the new one's even in doing
[00:57:00] it too so I'm like what the come
[00:57:06] on
[00:57:08] oh I wonder if that's what's causing it
[00:57:11] then it's been doing it for like like
[00:57:13] probably two months though it's not
[00:57:15] recently it's like two months and it's
[00:57:17] been getting worse so I thought it was
[00:57:19] my uh my thing dying because um I've hit
[00:57:22] I I've had like a lot of storms down
[00:57:24] here and I have it plugged in to a giant
[00:57:26] um battery surge protector that like
[00:57:29] will Char we have my computer and
[00:57:30] everything run for like almost a
[00:57:35] day whoa you really had 12 go Downs

[01:16:18] of the days and I had the green screen
[01:16:20] set up where she'd go over but if nobody

[01:31:05] then let's do the next
[01:31:09] one I wasn't prepared for this one
[01:31:11] because I generally don't do these ones
[01:31:13] on this day but we were going a little
[01:31:15] slow so I figured I'll try it out oh
[01:31:17] can't do that one that one doesn't go
[01:31:19] that one doesn't
[01:31:22] work
[01:31:26] that one's that
[01:31:29] one oh no not that one
[01:31:36] either we go oh that one I think is
[01:31:38] going to
[01:31:40] work there we
[01:31:42] go there we
[01:31:46] go all
[01:31:49] right very easy very easy with this game
[01:31:53] it's a very simple simple game these
[01:31:57] start out all at a
[01:32:01] dollar $1 you get to pick each of the
[01:32:04] one of these let me get this over here
[01:32:06] instead to hold it these work better
[01:32:09] holding the cards up you pick one here
[01:32:14] of the three but you get to CH decide
[01:32:17] does it have high or low on the back of
[01:32:20] either of these and after you decide
[01:32:22] that we we'll roll the dice and do a
[01:32:25] battle against the boss here to see if
[01:32:27] you are able to win and that's what we
[01:32:29] have for our cards right now I'm going
[01:32:30] to move those
[01:32:31] forward so you can see it better there
[01:32:34] you go those are the cards that you have
[01:32:36] and you have to decide whether it's
[01:32:37] going to be high or low and they start
[01:32:39] all for a dollar here and your choices
[01:32:41] either they are a dollar or not it's up
[01:32:44] to you if you like these packs these
[01:32:47] cards I mean so here you go sudden
[01:32:51] death you jump in and then what we do is
[01:32:53] we roll our dice you go up a little B on
[01:32:55] whatever the highest you get on here is
[01:32:58] what you go for the boss battle with and
[01:32:59] if you're able to beat the boss we do a
[01:33:00] $1 Loot drop for all you
[01:33:03] wastelanders and this is uh you know $1
[01:33:05] for either of these cards any three of
[01:33:07] these you pick one out you decide which
[01:33:09] one you want and then you say on back of
[01:33:12] each of them you decide which it says
[01:33:13] high or low that tells you whether or
[01:33:15] not you can uh roll how many rolls you
[01:33:17] get that's how it is there that's our

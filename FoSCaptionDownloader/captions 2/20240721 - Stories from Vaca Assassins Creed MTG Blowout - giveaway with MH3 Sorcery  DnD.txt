[00:14:13] um that being said we kind of like a
[00:14:16] little fell off of it because it was
[00:14:17] towards the end of it I think I think
[00:14:19] that was a little less exciting should I

[00:14:22] we should
[00:14:25] do I'm going throw out this for some
[00:14:27] pricing nice pack thing we do

[00:15:24] evening no one wants any of these I'm

[00:38:12] this because I'm
[00:38:15] old then I can't see the
[00:38:18] screen that's a
[00:38:21] problem either I see the screen or I
[00:38:24] don't
[00:38:27] and I read the
[00:38:30] cards all right throw an
[00:38:34] Infinity throw that one out there for
[00:38:36] own doll
[00:38:38] hair there you
[00:38:45] go put that
[00:38:53] there we
[00:38:56] go throw that one out next if somebody
[00:38:59] would like it there coming out for
[00:39:03] you here we are now there are things I
[00:39:07] can put together like a little stack of
[00:39:16] them no I don't know why it would have
[00:39:18] jumped up that's weird
[00:39:25] um I'd have to see
[00:39:28] shouldn't have jumped up after having
[00:39:31] one this is set to
[00:39:35] single no shouldn't have jumped
[00:39:37] up that's
[00:39:39] interesting I've only had
[00:39:46] um I will have we can ask about that and
[00:39:49] see why shouldn't have jumped up that's
[00:39:53] interesting not sure I've never had that
[00:39:56] happen before hm that's
[00:40:01] weird oh I'll give it a minut sometimes
[00:40:03] freaks out okay that could be what it is
[00:40:04] maybe that's what it is I'm I'm yeah
[00:40:07] maybe that's what's going on I'm not
[00:40:09] really sure on that that's really
[00:40:12] weird I haven't had that happen before I
[00:40:14] haven't had that's the first time
[00:40:15] somebody's asked me about that so I'm
[00:40:17] hoping it's maybe like a little glitch
[00:40:19] going on for a second and you'll get a
[00:40:21] uh you'll notified like get kind of
[00:40:23] notified what's going on after or it'll
[00:40:25] update but if not you can send send a
[00:40:27] message right away to them and see what
[00:40:28] it says uh right away they're very good
[00:40:31] at getting back to you I'm very sorry
[00:40:33] about that why would do that I don't
[00:40:36] know why because they all are at the
[00:40:38] same um price range area on these
[00:40:42] things and they have like same weight so
[00:40:45] that you should be able to add multiple
[00:40:46] of them together so that you're
[00:40:52] okay oh oh okay so you have already won
[00:40:55] a giveway and did you
[00:40:57] purchase something after you did you
[00:41:00] purchase something already before let me
[00:41:02] go give me one second if it was only
[00:41:03] purchasing something if you had
[00:41:05] purchased one thing and you won a
[00:41:07] giveaway the weights combining could be
[00:41:10] what the issue is no you only won the
[00:41:13] giveaway interesting it shouldn't have
[00:41:16] jumped that much I don't know that's
[00:41:20] weird let me um I can figure out that in
[00:41:23] a second
[00:41:25] here let's see
[00:41:29] let me try this here see what it'll
[00:41:37] say me
[00:41:41] see so let's do this here let me see
[00:41:44] what it'll
[00:41:46] do I'm wondering if it
[00:41:55] is what does that one say when you show
[00:41:58] when it shows
[00:42:09] it um it is $1 for that one
[00:42:17] yes yeah all right so it's for I think
[00:42:20] it's not adding think the weights
[00:42:21] correctly all of a sudden so thank you

[00:42:37] on I will have to talk to whatnot and
[00:42:40] see what's going on
[00:42:43] then because it's not adding the weights
[00:42:45] correctly for for when like different
[00:42:47] weights of things so that they don't go
[00:42:49] up so that's weird it's

[00:59:14] stuff like I was going to play I I have
[00:59:15] a um The Fallout deck that's the uh I
[00:59:19] haven't had a chance to play much of it
[00:59:21] but the Fallout deck that is the um dog
[00:59:23] meet one is a pretty tough one too
[00:59:28] and so I didn't want to I'm not going to
[00:59:29] play that tonight I'll play a different
[00:59:31] thing because I didn't realize how hard
[00:59:34] the dog meat one was until until I went
[00:59:35] to the store and played it with someone
[00:59:37] and I like we were I just like did
[00:59:39] really well somehow and I that doesn't
[00:59:41] make
[00:59:44] sense some more dinos there now remember
[00:59:47] I'm doing going through some red dinos
[00:59:49] so if you want any these here you go
[00:59:51] those are the dinos that I'm pulling out
[00:59:53] right now let me know if you want any
[00:59:56] just going to stick those right right
[01:00:00] there added all the swords oh nice
[01:00:03] swords are
[01:00:05] nice the swords will be nice that adding
[01:00:08] uh getting you extra stuff oh o oh added
[01:00:11] the swords that's
[01:00:18] nice dog me vron interesting interesting
[01:00:23] walk with the ancestors oh kind of a
[01:00:25] dino one
[01:00:27] but I W put that one specifically
[01:00:31] there let's
[01:00:35] see I got some Pirates all kinds of
[01:00:38] stuff here now I think what I'll end up
[01:00:41] doing is going through a bulk and I'll
[01:00:42] put them together in color by color and
[01:00:45] I'll say bulk Blue from Lost Caverns
[01:00:48] bulk whatever from you know bu bulk red
[01:00:51] from whatever it is does that sound like
[01:00:54] that's a good way for me to do a little
[01:00:56] thrashing bronz it on or would you like
[01:00:57] it to be set up uh a little different I
[01:00:59] was thinking by um by color would
[01:01:01] probably be best when I'm doing um when
[01:01:05] I'm doing
[01:01:11] that yeah Jurassic dinos are good
[01:01:14] Jurassic dinos are
[01:01:20] fun oh I have I have a big Dino deck
[01:01:26] for uh for the bulk in general for dinos
[01:01:29] I was just going to go through and if
[01:01:30] you said you wanted some of them I was
[01:01:31] going to put them together and and like
[01:01:32] a stack of them and put them all
[01:01:34] together is one
[01:01:44] thing oh yeah that happens sometimes I
[01:01:48] help that that happens hey but you know
[01:01:49] what that's not bad though they should
[01:01:51] be having a little bit of help it's not
[01:01:53] bad to help a little bit but like when
[01:01:54] they're sitting there the entire time
[01:01:55] and looking at yours and the other one
[01:01:57] then that's not good like if they were
[01:01:58] just looking at theirs but not
[01:02:00] yours um and give a little bit of help
[01:02:03] okay but if they looked at yours there's
[01:02:04] a problem with that you know what I
[01:02:06] mean but let's see what else we got here
[01:02:09] for um is quinneth nice Dino
[01:02:16] there yeah I was going to go through
[01:02:17] like a stack here just say oh we got
[01:02:20] blue a bunch of blue uh oh we got an
[01:02:23] angel I know somebody was asking for
[01:02:24] Angels before
[01:02:26] coloss aact and that's what I was
[01:02:29] thinking of doing for like just in
[01:02:30] general bulk like say here's Lo Caverns
[01:02:33] bulk for this and it'll be red A bunch
[01:02:37] of red rampaging belligerent yearling or
[01:02:40] it would be a bunch of blue and whatever
[01:02:43] was in there was in there thrashing
[01:02:44] brontodon couple of those B dactyl
[01:02:47] earthshaker dread another earthshaker
[01:02:52] dread but if there's anything that
[01:02:54] you're seeing me go through right now do
[01:02:55] let me
[01:02:57] know yes there was an angel right um
[01:03:00] where was it guardian of the great
[01:03:04] door lci1 16 I'll put that off the side
[01:03:08] I know people like angels too those are
[01:03:11] always big
[01:03:19] ones yeah

[01:42:39] Fallout D and D game uh kind of Florida
[01:42:41] based area and it's actually a large one

[01:42:45] through completely um if we went through
[01:42:47] each one of each one of the uh kind of
[01:42:49] like side quests and all those it would
[01:42:51] easily take uh like six seven hours I
[01:42:54] think because there's five different
[01:42:56] chapters and each chapter is a map
[01:42:58] actually there seven and there's seven
[01:42:59] different Maps so it's not actually so

[01:43:50] is higher you can't do about
[01:43:54] that now but instead of paying 45 I'm
[01:43:59] going to get 35 I mean not 40
[01:44:02] 402 I'm going to put it at 37 so it's $5
[01:44:05] off that's what I'm trying to get $5 off

[02:01:38] already went through some of this stuff
[02:01:40] earlier so we're done with that for

[02:01:47] a little bit more if anybody wants to
[02:01:49] that is now what I'm going to try to do

[02:02:52] stopping
[02:02:54] ground I think it was seam events I was
[02:02:56] thinking of I might have it I'd have to
[02:02:59] take a look further but off the top of
[02:03:01] my head and seeing it right now I am not
[02:03:04] seeing it in the location I was
[02:03:05] expecting it the one card that I was
[02:03:08] thinking might have been it it was not
[02:03:09] one that I was looking at
[02:03:14] earlier I put that back I won't be able
[02:03:17] so I'm not sure on that one there I can
[02:03:19] take a look around a little further
[02:03:20] later at another point But at the moment

[02:46:15] couple of those uh you use your
[02:46:16] intelligence booster you hit one of
[02:46:18] those nice big eyes on it shoulder there
[02:46:20] taking its eye out and it's now getting
[02:46:22] whining screeching at you it does not
[02:46:24] like you anymore you currently bring it

[03:29:21] know what I'm going to put this out as a
[03:29:24] uh I put a pole out
[03:29:38] here the whole point of it was to uh I
[03:29:42] don't know see if you like it it's a
[03:29:43] little bit of a little bit of intriguing
[03:29:44] thing similar to what we could be doing
[03:29:46] a l longer version of the D and D game
[03:29:48] that I
[03:29:49] have so we'll see road trip I know it's
[03:29:52] a little road trip
[03:29:54] game but I have another one that we
[03:29:56] finished what I was trying to say was I
[03:29:59] finished actually our um a whole game
[03:30:02] there
[03:30:03] myself it's a uh little Adventure game
[03:30:08] that we have I did a d and d one now we
[03:30:11] have finished
[03:30:12] but we don't have all our boxes gone not
[03:30:15] all those are left so let's try some of
[03:30:17] them maybe we'll do a little discount on
[03:30:18] some of them see if anybody wants
[03:30:22] them road trip it was a road trip what's
[03:30:25] the name of it was a good road trip what
[03:30:27] do you think was a good road
[03:30:29] trip I don't know what do you guys
[03:30:33] say infect MTG buddy you've got some
[03:30:37] luck today tiring Viewpoint I don't know
[03:30:40] where you are you haven't been around
[03:30:42] though I'm guessing you're on a computer
[03:30:44] or something
[03:30:49] if you can type SLG for
[03:30:51] me thank you I appreciate it I would
[03:30:54] appreciate that yeah we try to get some
[03:30:56] good fun stories going have a good time
[03:30:58] with you all see what happens now infect
[03:31:01] has not been saying anything so I'm just
[03:31:02] going to grab a random card out put that
[03:31:05] over
[03:31:06] there and we'll throw out some other
[03:31:11] stuff because we have some more stories
[03:31:14] to go through we got some new ones here
[03:31:17] now I'll have a new Story coming out for
[03:31:20] you guys next week all right probably
[03:31:23] starting one day or
[03:31:25] Tuesday get something new
[03:31:28] going it's really up to you guys how
[03:31:31] often we do these things and how often
[03:31:32] we play but we just try to have fun and
[03:31:34] play some
[03:31:41] games so now that we're at here
[03:31:46] the point of it quite
[03:31:48] frankly what we do here Brandon is a lot
[03:31:51] of the times I sell like magic cards all
[03:31:56] right and a lot of the people that play
[03:31:58] Magic like playing D and D also and we
[03:32:02] have some fun the way we have fun is
[03:32:05] just a lot of times people either like
[03:32:07] buy some magic cards here some packs of
[03:32:09] cards we'll open
[03:32:11] them we'll see what you have and I'll
[03:32:13] use some of that as inspiration
[03:32:16] when I'm building my game with you guys
[03:32:18] I build it on the fly with all of you so
[03:32:21] all these are kind of for sale if you
[03:32:23] went over to whatnot you'd be able to
[03:32:24] see everything for sale there in the buy
[03:32:27] now things like that now did you want
[03:32:29] some lost Caverns I know somebody was
[03:32:30] asking for that
[03:32:32] earlier so I said I had some I don't
[03:32:36] know why they were in the buy
[03:32:39] now which is surprising to me they
[03:32:42] should have been in
[03:32:44] there all right let me see what I got
[03:32:49] here I can figure out why that's not
[03:33:04] there
[03:33:06] huh that really
[03:33:13] weird I'm yum let me add it in
[03:33:26] quickly that's really weird that they're
[03:33:28] not
[03:33:40] there should be added in now
[03:33:50] they are in there now all right now if
[03:33:52] you want to do like a a stack of them so
[03:33:55] you want to do multiple so you want to
[03:33:57] do
[03:33:58] three we probably do that we do a little
[03:34:01] discount for
[03:34:03] you shipping is
[03:34:12] $4 my
[03:34:14] guess is that
[03:34:25] um my guess is the things that you've
[03:34:27] got which is why the shipping is for
[03:34:39] dollars it is cheaper but you got a
[03:34:42] discounted on it because you got
[03:34:43] multiple things it does add up some of
[03:34:46] it because you might have gone over the
[03:34:48] next like the next weight level so you
[03:34:50] do get a discount it would be like
[03:34:51] probably would more but you got you're
[03:34:53] get a little bit off I can tell you
[03:34:54] exactly here hold on a
[03:34:58] second so this is what's going on here
[03:35:01] let me
[03:35:03] see
[03:35:06] Frank all right so
[03:35:17] yeah so you did get a discount on some
[03:35:20] of it so instead of like paying almost
[03:35:22] $5 a little bit closer five or
[03:35:25] more you end up spending Less on it
[03:35:30] pretty much the you got one of the one
[03:35:32] of them for free there so the one of
[03:35:34] them the Magic Mountain was only 75
[03:35:35] cents instead of more because the first
[03:35:38] one that you did because of the giveway
[03:35:40] but the second one you got added the $4
[03:35:42] onto it
[03:35:48] how many can you get with
[03:35:50] shipping uh hold on a second with
[03:35:53] shipping would probably
[03:35:55] be two I'm guessing so we can put the
[03:35:59] two together 18 I'll call that um 17 for
[03:36:06] two for you let's see what we can do
[03:36:09] here see what it shows up as
[03:36:17] let's see if that happens and works for
[03:36:19] you those two right there how's the
[03:36:21] shipping show for
[03:36:23] you does it work I think it
[03:36:27] will I think it'll work good all right
[03:36:31] cool I think it worked out better for
[03:36:33] you yeah so what happens is you would
[03:36:35] have paid like seven to8 for shipping
[03:36:38] but because you got the giveaway you're
[03:36:40] paying like the little bit less it's
[03:36:42] like a dollar or so less whenever you
[03:36:44] get a giveaway um that's
[03:36:47] why or if it's a bigger giveaway you'll
[03:36:49] get um one of the other ones if it
[03:36:50] happens one of ones a pack giveaways
[03:36:53] you'll get even more but it was only a
[03:36:54] single so that's why all right here you

[03:50:11] a case generally I open like a box but
[03:50:15] um a while ago I had done that I haven't
[03:50:17] done it recently that's more or less
[03:50:19] what it is because I don't um I only had
[03:50:22] one box to open I generally if I have
[03:50:24] multiple and I'm able to buy a good

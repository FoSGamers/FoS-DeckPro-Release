[01:45:44] Wasteland half of those are animated the
[01:45:46] other half aren't I uh made it a little
[01:45:48] bit easier for you guys to be bosses is
[01:45:50] pretty much why there's 20 versus the 10
[01:45:52] that were there
[01:45:56] before I didn't like that people weren't
[01:45:59] being bosses beating them all the
[01:46:02] time yes no character has in one of
[01:46:04] those up
[01:46:05] there technician strong human detective

[01:46:12] pick your way through there's one
[01:46:14] through 78 on each of the green and the
[01:46:18] red then the blue has a uh 1 through 12
[01:46:22] that you pick pick and then your boss is
[01:46:24] one through 20 or I can do random on
[01:46:26] them all some people like random on them
[01:46:28] all but yeah you pick your character
[01:46:30] right at the top there and that's one of
[01:46:31] our three characters those are animated
[01:46:33] for most of those encounters that we
[01:46:35] have going on in the Wasteland here
[01:46:36] that's why uh that's why we do it this
[01:46:43] way you choose all right will who should
[01:46:47] our character be in our Wayside
[01:46:50] Adventure what are they you know their
[01:46:53] characters Tech mutant human

[02:04:28] first base which is a single which um
[02:04:31] you get a a certain pack of cards then
[02:04:34] five through eight you get a h the
[02:04:37] second option where you can get a double
[02:04:39] which will be a pack different type of
[02:04:41] pack of cards there uh the numbers nine
[02:04:43] through 10 is third base which is a
[02:04:44] triple which you get you a number
[02:04:46] another different pack of cards um then
[02:04:49] we have a hit a number 11 which is a
[02:04:51] home run which goes you all the way to F
[02:04:53] uh home run and then number 12 will be a
[02:04:56] ball so you get to roll again and if you
[02:04:57] land on a base you get the pack that's
[02:04:59] on the base and if you hit a

Figure out Southern Hobby even further.

[2024-08-14 23:09:08] ChatGPT:
Southern Hobby Supply offers the **Sorcery: Contested Realm - Arthurian Legends** booster box, but they operate as a wholesale distributor. This means that pricing and availability details are only accessible to registered users who log in to their website. This also suggests that they primarily serve businesses or large buyers rather than individual customers.

To purchase from Southern Hobby Supply, you would likely need to either register for an account as a retailer or go through a local game store or reseller that sources their products from Southern Hobby. Their site indicates that the booster box will be released on October 4, 2024, and is subject to allocation, which means that supply might be limited depending on demand.

If you are interested in going through Southern Hobby, it might be worthwhile to contact them directly or work with a local retailer who can place orders on your behalf. This could potentially offer you a better deal, especially if you're looking to buy in bulk.

[00:00:07] All right, we're
[00:00:09] good. We have uh Good morning. Good
[00:00:12] morning. I think we're okay
[00:00:16] here. That's how it works. All
[00:00:20] right, there we
[00:00:25] go. Looks like that's not working.
[00:00:35] Maybe that's
[00:00:41] why. We'll find out here in a second. I
[00:00:43] don't know. That was not a big deal for
[00:00:49] me. But I think we're good here. Good
[00:00:52] morning, Spicy. Good morning. Good
[00:00:53] morning. How's it going? Hopefully
[00:00:55] you're having a wonderful morning
[00:00:59] here. We're starting up doing this. I
[00:01:02] think we are going to be set
[00:01:05] now if I am
[00:01:07] right. I do believe
[00:01:11] so. Wonderful. Nice. All
[00:01:15] right, we're up and going.
[00:01:18] [Music]
[00:01:29] better once coffee is done. Everybody's
[00:01:32] always better when coffee is done. Yeah,
[00:01:34] I moved the camera today so it's on that
[00:01:36] side. I mean on the computer less chance
[00:01:39] of having any hiccups or falling or
[00:01:40] anything like that. We got our brakes
[00:01:42] out today what we have. Not too bad. Not
[00:01:44] too bad. Get things up and running. I
[00:01:47] think we got uh what was Will's Nolan's
[00:01:48] one? Nolan had a an intriguing one. He
[00:01:52] picked this one. I thought this one
[00:01:53] would be a good one for kind of
[00:01:56] a I think we might be almost in the last
[00:01:58] room in the vault, aren't we? Yeah,
[00:02:00] we're in No, this is the only one that's
[00:02:02] left is the no room.
[00:02:05] H then we'll have to see what goes on
[00:02:08] after
[00:02:09] that. But
[00:02:12] oop, bump the
[00:02:14] camera. We'll figure it out and have
[00:02:16] some fun.
[00:02:38] Let's see what we got going on here.
[00:02:52] H
[00:02:54] intriguing. We'll do
[00:03:00] this. Ah, dude. Don't worry about it. I
[00:03:04] understand. Um I understand that myself.
[00:03:06] Yeah, I'm I don't care what That's why I
[00:03:08] was pl I've come up with a uh I'm going
[00:03:11] to be doing some membership things with
[00:03:13] YouTube. I can do that now a bit. So,
[00:03:14] I'm going to try doing that and changing
[00:03:16] those up. I added some in there. I don't
[00:03:18] know if people like them. But, um, if
[00:03:22] you guys like them, let me know. I can
[00:03:23] make adjustments, too, cuz those are my
[00:03:24] first kind of ideas. Throwing them out
[00:03:29] there. And that's kind of what I was I
[00:03:31] don't know, thinking about. I threw a
[00:03:33] few of them on there for you guys for
[00:03:34] those that want to just play the game
[00:03:35] along like sometimes and just buy packs
[00:03:38] at other times. That's why we're doing
[00:03:39] the packs
[00:03:40] here. But here, what's I'm going to do
[00:03:42] now? Yes. So, I know tried something
[00:03:45] out. I don't know if it's the same if
[00:03:47] it'll work well or not, but it was one
[00:03:49] of those, you know, try it out and see
[00:03:50] if you guys like
[00:03:51] it things. I keep bumping the camera cuz
[00:03:54] I'm not used to where it is right now.
[00:03:56] So,
[00:04:31] So much harder type with one finger
[00:04:35] missing. You have to like think a lot
[00:04:38] harder. But I'm doing
[00:04:49] it. Every now and again I make a couple
[00:04:51] mistakes and have to
[00:04:53] delete. See what happens.
[00:05:02] [Music]
[00:05:12] Uh oh. Uh
[00:05:13] oh. Too far away with the
[00:05:18] mouse. Yeah.
[00:05:20] So, yeah. It's fun to hang out with
[00:05:23] people. I don't mind when you guys come
[00:05:24] in, hang out, and chat and stuff. It
[00:05:26] helps me uh keep the shows rolling and
[00:05:28] having more uh more to do. Our buddies
[00:05:30] there got us some of the like I said,
[00:05:31] the BR got some new dice there for me.
[00:05:33] That was pretty nice of them. I thought
[00:05:34] it was awesome. Very awesome of them. I
[00:05:36] don't generally run into stuff on that
[00:05:37] on a regular basis. So, it's nice when
[00:05:39] people are uh throw a little throw a
[00:05:40] little extra, you know, be some nice
[00:05:45] persons. Am I cracking up a bit
[00:05:50] here? Looks like I might need to uh
[00:05:53] looking to make an adjustment just a
[00:05:56] bit. All right. Well, maximum effort
[00:05:59] every time. Always maximum effort.
[00:06:05] Well, if you don't do maximum effort,
[00:06:07] you're going to end up just getting
[00:06:08] hurt. Kind of my thought process on
[00:06:12] that. I know it might sound weird, but
[00:06:15] if you don't actually do something 100%
[00:06:18] fully correct, like with all whatever
[00:06:20] you needed and have in you, that's where
[00:06:22] you get hurt because you're you're
[00:06:24] holding back. You you make a mistake
[00:06:26] because you try not to do something
[00:06:27] right. You try to do something right,
[00:06:28] but you're worried how you're doing it.
[00:06:30] or you make a mistake cuz you don't put
[00:06:32] the full effort into it and you don't
[00:06:34] say don't do the trick completely as a
[00:06:37] 360 and you only land part of it and
[00:06:39] that's when you fall, you know, you
[00:06:41] don't throw the full effort in. I don't
[00:06:42] know. That's I don't know. One of those
[00:06:43] weird things. I don't know if they Yeah,
[00:06:45] exactly. Spicy. Yeah. See, it's one of
[00:06:47] those It's one of those ones that's a
[00:06:48] hard one there. But I have a couple
[00:06:50] packs like this here. Ooh, we got these
[00:06:53] here today. I was thinking we might have
[00:06:55] those in a break if the uh if we get
[00:06:56] through some stuff. And I was also going
[00:06:58] to do some um some of the bulk stuff
[00:07:00] that we've been done in the past because
[00:07:03] we've been opening some packs as a
[00:07:04] family here. And we have bulk now to go
[00:07:06] through. So I think we're going to get a
[00:07:08] Yes. Got to commit. Exactly. So I feel
[00:07:11] like uh I'm going to be able to do some
[00:07:12] bulks again here uh very soon. Hey hot

[00:08:39] of them that weren't bad, but that was

[00:09:30] nice. They are really nice. Good morning
[00:09:32] everybody. Thank you for coming in.
[00:09:34] We'll open up a handful of more packs

[00:10:44] there. Art rolls advantage zombie and
[00:10:48] our stickers. Now, one of the things I'd
[00:10:50] like to say is uh since we're getting in
[00:10:53] more bulk, I was going to throw in
[00:10:54] everybody that gets uh today at least
[00:10:56] one of the packs of bulk that we have,
[00:10:57] if not two or three, depending on how
[00:10:59] much we have uh that we have at the end
[00:11:01] of the show here. Figuring uh that would
[00:11:03] be a way to get me to get rid of it
[00:11:05] while you guys uh with you guys that are
[00:11:06] getting some purchases.
[00:11:10] Hopefully you guys are all having a
[00:11:12] decent one
[00:11:16] though on a Saturday. We have to uh go
[00:11:19] do errands again. But after those
[00:11:22] errands are over, we're going to the
[00:11:24] beach. We believe. But you said that we
[00:11:25] didn't have We did have a couple things
[00:11:28] to go and do. What? We have to go get
[00:11:31] some stuff for the seals for the
[00:11:33] showers. Remember, they're leaking and
[00:11:35] we have to put the billagege on because
[00:11:36] they're leaking. But no, no, no, no, no,
[00:11:40] no, no,
[00:11:47] no. Anyways,
[00:11:50] uh, and there was one other thing I
[00:11:52] think we needed to do at a store if I
[00:11:54] remember right. Didn't we not get to one
[00:11:58] of the stores mom wanted to
[00:12:00] go? Anyways, we have the car until the
[00:12:03] end of the day.
[00:12:05] So, we're going and doing that stuff.
[00:12:07] Remember to use the memory that you have
[00:12:11] that we talk about things with you. Yes.
[00:12:16] Okay. All right. Well, the brakes we got
[00:12:19] there.
[00:12:22] Oh, wow. It's that hot. That stinks,
[00:12:25] man. I mean, that cool cold. You have to
[00:12:28] put a a lot in. I've been there before
[00:12:31] that you had to run it like and it feels
[00:12:32] like the uh my like you go anywhere near
[00:12:34] it's like that one room that it's in is
[00:12:36] on fire but the rest of the house is
[00:12:41] not. Now Nolan's picks today are pretty
[00:12:45] intriguing. These are what he
[00:12:49] got. These are Nolan's picks
[00:12:53] today. The one I put there. These ones
[00:12:57] we have ma commander masters collector
[00:13:00] commander masters fat non infinity
[00:13:02] stricks haven ranica wilds of al drain
[00:13:05] and our uh murder there. So that's what
[00:13:08] is picked from our friend Nolan that's
[00:13:11] pinned right now. We'll pick this one.
[00:13:13] We had a mystery booster
[00:13:17] 2. We
[00:13:19] have Modern
[00:13:21] Horizon,
[00:13:23] Onfinity, Stricks
[00:13:25] Haven, Wilds of
[00:13:28] Eldrain, and Dominaria. That's Will and
[00:13:31] there his choice
[00:13:34] there. Yeah, I remember living up north.
[00:13:37] You'd have to go to every now and again
[00:13:38] like say like our our boiler would like
[00:13:40] not work at one point. You'd have to go
[00:13:42] down and play with it. What happened to
[00:13:43] the
[00:13:44] mouse? And you go downstairs and like
[00:13:46] that area is on fire.
[00:13:49] But starts to cool off very quickly when
[00:13:51] it stops
[00:13:53] working. I need some more coffee.
[00:13:57] William. Yeah. What you doing? Reading
[00:14:00] or you learning Spanish still. Reading.
[00:14:02] All right. You have to translate things
[00:14:04] for Spanish for me. I know. I already
[00:14:06] did my Spanish lesson. It's 15 minutes a
[00:14:08] day. I didn't say to do more than that.
[00:14:10] I just said you're going to have to
[00:14:11] translate for me now. You you argue with
[00:14:13] me all the time.
[00:14:16] Nope.
[00:14:26] Yeah, cuz it's easier to keep.
[00:14:29] Not the best tasting, but it tastes
[00:14:31] better than nothing.
[00:14:36] Making a coffee. Oh, I thought I ran for
[00:14:39] run a giveaway. Hold on. I had I forgot
[00:14:41] my I thought I had run a giveaway there.
[00:14:44] Give me a second. And I did
[00:14:46] not run one of those while I go grab a
[00:14:49] coffee.
[00:15:08] All right, let's do something here.
[00:15:11] Where's my
[00:15:12] mushroom? Did you put it away already?
[00:15:16] Oh, a new one already. Can I cut myself
[00:15:19] up an apple? What? Can I cut myself a
[00:15:22] apple and have some peanut butter with
[00:15:23] it?
[00:15:25] Um, yeah. But you got to be very careful
[00:15:27] with those knives and get the cutting
[00:15:28] board out cuz it cut through everything.
[00:15:30] Yes. All right. Yes.
[00:15:35] Mom's going to come back and do
[00:15:36] breakfast though in a little bit. Okay.
[00:15:38] So, when she gets back here, you can't
[00:15:40] have too much of the apple trying to get
[00:15:42] it.
[00:15:44] Oh, well then you should probably just
[00:15:45] wait.
[00:15:47] I know she was
[00:15:53] [Music]
[00:15:56] back. Yay.
[00:16:01] Oh, yeah. He also got a cracker.
[00:16:05] I got a cracker.
[00:16:10] That
[00:16:20] funny. I don't know.
[00:16:31] Am I missing something?
[00:16:34] I might be missing something.
[00:16:42] I don't
[00:16:52] know. I might be missing something. I
[00:16:55] don't
[00:16:58] know. Anyways, hopefully I'm uh
[00:17:05] Oh, all right. I'll figure it I'll
[00:17:07] figure it out
[00:17:08] eventually. I always figure things out
[00:17:10] eventually. Sometimes I'm just not
[00:17:12] paying attention, so it takes me a
[00:17:13] minute because I'm not paying attention.
[00:17:16] With that being
[00:17:17] said, we're going to open up one of the
[00:17:19] packs the kids. I believe these were
[00:17:20] ones from one of the kids.
[00:17:24] Put off to the side.
[00:17:26] So, we'll see if we get anything from
[00:17:28] this one here.
[00:17:30] How'd it go? Good. We can do some
[00:17:32] adventuring. You can do it by yourself.
[00:17:35] Yeah. Oh, yeah. I can do my own laundry.
[00:17:38] Looks like it's never used. I can pay
[00:17:40] with my phone. Sweet.
[00:17:43] We're trying to figure out the laundry
[00:17:44] situation at this location cuz we don't
[00:17:46] have our um we don't have our washing
[00:17:47] machine here yet. One of the last things
[00:17:49] on the list for me. Like we got to get
[00:17:50] our we can get it done at these places
[00:17:52] here until then and uh because we have
[00:17:55] uh I'm almost done with it. I want to
[00:17:57] get the solar and all that stuff
[00:17:58] installed for it. So, we're waiting on a
[00:17:59] response in that. Hopefully we can get
[00:18:01] that in next week though. From the sound
[00:18:02] of it, it's
[00:18:04] possible. 1

[00:18:15] counting. And I think I skipped over a
[00:18:17] couple cards there. What's up? Hot.
[00:18:19] Yeah, it is. I know. The sun beats in
[00:18:20] really hot here. No, it's hot outside.

[00:21:02] newer than this. The lagoon, right?
[00:21:06] No, it wasn't. Yeah. Whatever. Yeah.
[00:21:08] Either way, we were on a lagoon in the
[00:21:10] in the Bahamas, which is what uh it was
[00:21:12] a nice one that we had there. It was a
[00:21:14] bigger than this. It was a 44, though.
[00:21:16] This is f fine for us. But,
[00:21:19] all right. That wasn't a bad pack. We
[00:21:21] have our um now that we do have our our
[00:21:24] fifth edition ones here that we've been
[00:21:26] holding on to that we brought with us. A
[00:21:28] couple of these. I was wondering if we
[00:21:29] would do anything maybe with these
[00:21:31] today.
[00:21:34] Good morning everyone. Hello.
[00:21:48] All right. I think
[00:21:50] [Music]
[00:21:52] I'm going have to do something here.
[00:21:54] Give me a sec.
[00:22:03] [Music]
[00:22:09] very
[00:22:11] [Music]
[00:22:20] [Music]
[00:22:26] very adventurous.
[00:22:52] Sorry, stuff was freezing on me. And I
[00:22:54] was trying to figure see if I had to
[00:22:55] reset anything on the router or if there
[00:22:57] was an update going.
[00:23:10] I don't know what
[00:23:22] Yeah.
[00:23:24] I don't know why I was freezing. Trying
[00:23:26] to figure out if it was me having to
[00:23:27] There sometimes there's an update and it
[00:23:29] caused it to slow down. Hey, how's it
[00:23:31] going
[00:23:32] everybody? Thank you. Thank you for
[00:23:34] coming in and hanging out. We have our
[00:23:36] adventure going. We have uh Oh, where'd
[00:23:38] it go?
[00:23:39] I don't need that up anymore. We got
[00:23:41] this.
[00:23:43] So, we have been wandering
[00:23:47] around. You beat the uh the pirates that
[00:23:51] were the no
[00:23:53] room. You gathered some stuff there.
[00:23:56] You're on a little bit
[00:24:02] more.
[00:24:07] And as you're
[00:24:10] wandering, you know, you might find
[00:24:12] another room of something. Who knows?
[00:24:45] Try this. But I like the other one. Aha.
[00:24:49] Don't need anything. You got some vault
[00:24:50] breaks in the bin. Yes. Who knows? Maybe
[00:24:52] uh you know, once you get to here, I
[00:24:54] don't know. We've never done two of
[00:24:56] them, so I'll have to prepare the other
[00:24:57] second one. But if we get through two
[00:25:00] and we get through I'm guessing you're
[00:25:01] going to want to go to No, cuz you're
[00:25:02] going to want to try to get over where
[00:25:03] are where you know, you've been trying
[00:25:04] to figure out how to get through this X
[00:25:06] red X here. I don't not sure exactly
[00:25:08] where I
[00:25:09] uh what it is, but we're hoping it's the
[00:25:12] uh the way
[00:25:14] out. It's on to you guys though to make
[00:25:16] that decision.
[00:25:18] And where are we going? It's nice. I
[00:25:19] have more room over here and around too.
[00:25:22] So there.
[00:25:25] Got to get to that that invisible X
[00:25:27] marks spot. I know.
[00:25:31] Daddy, where do I put these AAA
[00:25:33] batteries that were on the table? AAA
[00:25:35] batteries on the table. You can either
[00:25:37] hold on to them or put them on the bag
[00:25:39] right now. We'll figure it out later.
[00:25:40] Okay. Putting them on the chip.
[00:25:44] [Applause]
[00:25:45] No, that was where um where where you're
[00:25:48] hoping the exit is cuz you're just in a
[00:25:50] dead end room. It seems like a dead end
[00:25:52] place here. I
[00:25:55] know. I got to figure out what's going
[00:25:57] on.

[00:26:37] matter. 99 cents off by one.
[00:26:40] Oh, yeah. Yeah, you were doing the you
[00:26:42] were doing it like uh like the stores
[00:26:43] do, right? Tricking people thinking it

[00:37:41] rewear the same shorts. They're not
[00:37:43] dirty. Remember that I told you about
[00:37:46] Will. Remember science science this need
[00:37:49] to use not not I don't know if
[00:37:53] all right anyways we're going to put
[00:37:55] this together with your Sera and your
[00:37:57] Akal JSON. If that one's up and over 10,
[00:37:58] please let me know. We're going to get
[00:38:00] these in the top loader for you and
[00:38:04] wherever that plane toploader is.
[00:38:09] I can't find it. So we'll open up the
[00:38:11] new package.
[00:38:20] Yeah, all
[00:38:22] right. Let's see what's going on there.
[00:38:25] Get that top loader out so we can put
[00:38:27] all those away.
[00:38:30] The sun shining through there.
[00:38:33] Which is why I have them on. All right.
[00:38:34] Hey, you can have that conversation
[00:38:36] later with mom if you really want to.
[00:38:38] But you're arguing and we do not do
[00:38:39] arguing. You say yes, mom. And you do
[00:38:41] what you're told. Yes, sir. Yes, ma'am.
[00:38:45] [Applause]
[00:38:48] Please finish your egg. All right. EMT.
[00:38:51] Okay. EMT. Sorry, I had to be a parent
[00:38:54] there for a minute. William, actually,
[00:38:55] come here.
[00:38:58] There we go.
[00:39:01] EMT with your packs. And now, EMT, would
[00:39:05] you um like one of the Infinity packs
[00:39:07] that we have been opening here? One of
[00:39:08] the just the bulk stuff from them. I
[00:39:10] think it has stickers and uncommons and
[00:39:12] maybe a foil or stuff in there. We're
[00:39:14] trying to get rid of our our bulk stuff
[00:39:16] that we've been opening because I can't
[00:39:17] really keep it all on the boat. So, I
[00:39:19] figure if you guys want some, you can
[00:39:20] take it. Would you like it? Just throw
[00:39:22] in a pack. I was trying to throw an
[00:39:24] extra pack kind of that if you'd like.
[00:39:25] It's your choice obviously or not. Helps
[00:39:27] with packing, too. Maybe uh protect it a
[00:39:29] little bit.
[00:39:32] All right. Sounds good. We'll do that.
[00:39:34] Give it a little extra protection for
[00:39:35] packaging.
[00:39:37] Sounds good. EMT. Well, hey, have a um
[00:39:40] be safe at work there.
[00:39:43] All
[00:39:46] right. Thank you for coming in, though.
[00:39:48] We do appreciate it. Putting that away.
[00:39:56] All righty.
[00:40:00] There we are. Got that there. I'll put
[00:40:04] that over here with all of the stuff
[00:40:06] from today's show. All
[00:40:11] right, work. Work is that wonderful
[00:40:13] thing that we all need to do at some
[00:40:17] point. Oh, that'll be nice in the break.
[00:40:19] That'll be nice on the break. We're
[00:40:21] going to hopefully get some. We got a
[00:40:22] good break going here. There's only four
[00:40:24] spots left. And I You'll get pinged when
[00:40:26] the break starts. And I normally give
[00:40:27] everybody 5 minutes. I like I'll run
[00:40:29] like a giveaway for the 5 minutes. Let
[00:40:31] that go and then once that because it
[00:40:33] pings you when I hit start. So, um, just
[00:40:35] look for the ping and jump in or say
[00:40:37] anything whenever you can.
[00:40:40] [Music]
[00:40:44] All righty.
[00:40:53] That's funny. No, them. You're them. The
[00:40:56] them and you right now cuz I I made a
[00:40:58] comment about it before and they weren't
[00:40:59] really paying attention, but now I think
[00:41:01] they're probably going to pay attention.
[00:41:02] Yeah.
[00:41:05] to have our sheets and towels. But there
[00:41:07] we go. Let's put these here. These are
[00:41:09] the brakes. The one that was jumped in
[00:41:10] on today was this one. We're going to
[00:41:11] zoom back out so you can see the whole
[00:41:13] desk that we got here set up. Got our
[00:41:16] glass caverns, mystery, our modern
[00:41:18] unfinity, stricks, haven, wilds of all
[00:41:20] drains, and our domin area. We got all
[00:41:23] those
[00:41:24] there. And then
[00:41:35] H
[00:41:43] your plate.
[00:41:46] Did it freeze
[00:41:49] again? Hopefully it
[00:41:53] didn't. I think we're good
[00:41:55] there. Yeah, I think we're good there.
[00:41:59] [Music]
[00:42:04] All right, we're
[00:42:06] good. Some of the other things stopped
[00:42:08] working, but who cares? We seem to be We

[00:42:34] great one. My dad used to go and get the
[00:42:37] great one from Dunkin Donuts which um I
[00:42:38] think was like a whole pot of coffee
[00:42:41] and that's that's what he would drink in
[00:42:42] the morning. I'm like no. Now I
[00:42:43] understand why. Like can you make sure

[00:43:31] little bit while mom was getting ready.
[00:43:34] Then one of you will go help her. Okay.
[00:43:37] You're going to have to bring a book
[00:43:38] because I'm not going to sit there and
[00:43:39] listen to you. Nope. Cuz you can't
[00:43:41] leave. I have to sit in there. No,

[00:43:46] All right. Ready? You understand, bud?
[00:43:49] Yeah. I don't know if it's going to be
[00:43:50] you or No, it will. But mom will take
[00:43:52] somebody to help. Okay. All right. Yeah.
[00:43:56] Sorry. I had to do that for a minute.
[00:44:01] You know what we'll do? Let's do this.
[00:44:03] Let's run a giveaway for a minute here
[00:44:05] while we're hanging out. Had to be an
[00:44:07] adult type thing. You know, play around
[00:44:09] on the boat here.
[00:44:13] No. Didn't function.
[00:44:19] I need another coffee. Definitely need
[00:44:20] another coffee. Put the keyboard down
[00:44:21] over there.
[00:44:24] It's hot in here. I never sweat. I'm
[00:44:26] sweating right now.
[00:44:38] Are you frozen?
[00:44:43] Oh crap. Am I?
[00:44:46] I got up and I got frozen. Sorry, your
[00:44:49] face is stuck on the screen and you
[00:44:50] weren't there. I know. Thank you. I
[00:44:53] think we're good.
[00:44:56] We have to make sure we're not using the
[00:44:58] um thing at the time. I'm planning on
[00:45:01] We're going to have to do if we turn on
[00:45:03] the thing. Yeah. To make it go up to
[00:45:06] like the one TBTE,
[00:45:09] we'll use that all in a month. And they
[00:45:11] can't use much of it themselves.
[00:45:15] Which is fine. But nobody
[00:45:19] will download. But if it keeps breaking
[00:45:21] up like this, I need to add it. But the
[00:45:24] thing is too, I can add it on maybe like
[00:45:25] $2 a gig on the morning for
[00:45:30] priority. I have
[00:45:33] like the amount you made per
[00:45:37] show on YouTube to do
[00:45:40] that. What? They're all coming in. Yeah,
[00:45:43] two of them just left, didn't they? I
[00:45:46] don't
[00:45:48] know. All
[00:45:57] right.
[00:45:59] You're coming in backwards, too. I know.
[00:46:03] He's got two remotes, though. One in the
[00:46:06] front of the boat, one in the back of
[00:46:07] the boat. Yeah. Just weird. And then you
[00:46:08] got this guy coming
[00:46:13] out right now.
[00:46:15] Yeah. That's why we get It's
[00:46:17] interesting. And they said it was going
[00:46:18] to be better here. I'm like really have
[00:46:21] a lot more boat traffic. Same amount of
[00:46:23] traffic more.
[00:46:26] They had to come out that way before in
[00:46:27] front of us every time. I know that. But
[00:46:31] I think it's just a weekend. So people
[00:46:34] are going in and out of their slips. The
[00:46:36] only reason we're not is cuz
[00:46:39] we have some [ __ ] to
[00:46:41] do cuz we don't just we don't we don't
[00:46:43] live in Puerto Rico and have our boat
[00:46:44] here. live on the boat and we're here in
[00:46:46] Puerto Rico. They do some things. They
[00:46:47] have a house. Yeah,
[00:46:49] exactly. Exactly. You know what? That's
[00:46:51] what I should be putting on here for you
[00:46:53] guys to see. And I always forget to do
[00:46:59] it. Connect that baby.
[00:47:14] [Music]
[00:47:23] Then do
[00:47:24] that. Ah, the nice background.
[00:47:38] Yes, that doesn't happen. They generally
[00:47:42] don't. They're still there. They don't
[00:47:44] walk out. They get carried out. They
[00:47:46] Somebody carries them
[00:47:47] out. That's how that
[00:47:50] works. All righty. Now, what I'll do
[00:47:54] here, just tap my
[00:47:59] finger. We're going to open up this
[00:48:02] in a minute here. This pack, which was
[00:48:05] provided by one of the children, picked
[00:48:06] this one out here. I'm going to open
[00:48:09] that baby up and see what you guys like
[00:48:10] it. I'm going to put that off to the
[00:48:12] side if we get any luck with it. But
[00:48:14] it's up to all you guys hanging out in
[00:48:15] the YouTube land while we're uh rolling
[00:48:18] here if we're going to do any more
[00:48:19] adventuring. Now, oh, that's what I was
[00:48:21] saying. I did
[00:48:22] um was
[00:48:26] it see if I can go there and tell you
[00:48:29] what it is I set
[00:48:37] up. Does it
[00:48:40] show?
[00:48:43] No, I don't think it's going to show me.
[00:48:45] How do I do this?
[00:48:52] All right. So,
[00:49:25] There we go. That's where I need to
[00:49:34] be. Maybe not. I'll have to figure those
[00:49:36] out later. Put them in. I can't remember
[00:49:38] where I put them.
[00:49:42] Yeah, about four more weeks. Yeah,
[00:49:44] spicy. Look at that. You got the
[00:49:46] giveaway. So, what we're going to need
[00:49:49] is a number between 1 and 10 from you,
[00:49:51] my friend, to
[00:49:53] see if we get any
[00:49:56] luck. Yeah, it takes about four more
[00:49:59] weeks. They uh is what I was told. Four
[00:50:01] to Yeah, probably four or more weeks
[00:50:03] being how bad it was. Like four to six
[00:50:06] weeks, but my Pinky was in pieces and
[00:50:08] it's only about two weeks out now.
[00:50:11] Put that in
[00:50:12] there.
[00:50:17] Four. Change your name to spicy.
[00:50:23] Ah, one, two, three,
[00:50:30] four. Oh, what? The one I just literally
[00:50:32] put in
[00:50:33] there. What? That is not the right
[00:50:35] packs. One.
[00:50:38] That's not right. Where's the card that
[00:50:40] I had
[00:50:42] there? Where are all those that I had
[00:50:45] for our
[00:50:55] giveaways? Where the hell did I put all
[00:51:01] those? Ah, losing my mind.
[00:51:08] [Music]
[00:51:09] Losing my mind. You need some? Nope. I
[00:51:12] got I found them. They're hidden by
[00:51:14] something. Aha.
[00:51:17] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 with mom. There we go.

[00:51:25] camo off. Come with mom. Ah, camo.
[00:51:28] That's what they call it. I'm
[00:51:29] camouflage. I mean, I don't really need
[00:51:31] help. One, two, three, four.
[00:51:35] Borbian. Now, let's see where the rare
[00:51:37] was. Oh, was number one. You were off by
[00:51:39] a minute there, my friend. Have a drink.

[00:51:50] spicy. All right,
[00:51:53] so Robo again. Oh my god. All right, I
[00:51:57] got to make a decision here if I want to
[00:51:59] make a change. Where's my phone?

[00:52:08] It's in the window showing you this
[00:52:09] view. This is what I need. And my
[00:52:11] camera's here, too, so I can set

[00:52:28] in with the win on that one. You should

[00:52:44] face of like see I told you the other
[00:52:46] faces she gives me and you can
[00:52:47] understand why I tell her all the time.
[00:52:48] I'm like I know what you're saying. I
[00:52:49] know what's going on because it's
[00:52:51] written all over you.

[00:53:03] minute, buddy. I know you are. Now,
[00:53:06] today I was thinking of doing an auction
[00:53:09] on this baby here. I show that right
[00:53:12] there for you all. Thinking of doing an
[00:53:14] auction on that baby today. And I was
[00:53:16] going to start it if we could get up to
[00:53:18] having a few people in here hanging out.
[00:53:19] I figured we do
[00:53:29] that. Oh, yep. No, no, no, no. That's
[00:53:33] not what happened.
[00:53:37] Oh, this is Will's pack that he's going
[00:53:39] to open from for later today. I got to
[00:53:41] see if we get any luck with that one.

[00:54:10] do you call it? The uh treasure trove
[00:54:11] box hopper. All right. We'll get back.
[00:54:13] Couldn't remember why they call it a
[00:54:14] treasure trove. All right. Well, they
[00:54:16] have somebody coming and get you. No,
[00:54:18] I'm my own thing. Why didn't you call
[00:54:19] someone to come and get you? Because I
[00:54:21] need the exercise. Okay. I'm not going
[00:54:22] to argue on anything when a woman says
[00:54:24] that. You say you can do whatever you
[00:54:26] need. That's a no no zone.
[00:54:32] [Music]
[00:54:34] Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Grew up with women.
[00:54:37] I know enough. I know enough on that
[00:54:39] one. Now, remember everybody, today
[00:54:42] we'll be giving away some of our um bulk
[00:54:45] with each purchase cuz I need to get rid
[00:54:47] of it so you get some of our Infinity
[00:54:50] we've been opening while we're hanging
[00:54:51] out here. I hope you're all having a
[00:54:54] good one today. You're having some fun.
[00:54:56] We're trying to uh you know figure out
[00:54:58] what's going on
[00:55:03] here. We'll see. Does this work
[00:55:07] here? The stream is on a slow bit rate.
[00:55:11] I think it's telling me. Yes, it is.
[00:55:13] It's all right. We'll be here in the
[00:55:17] background. Oh, yeah. There's battles
[00:55:19] you learn over the years. Yes, there's
[00:55:20] definitely battles you pick and there's
[00:55:21] ones you just let go. Those are ones you
[00:55:24] let go.
[00:55:26] [Music]
[00:55:32] I feel like I should just take the c the
[00:55:33] camo and go sit with it and talk with
[00:55:36] you guys, but I can't always uh see
[00:55:39] what's in chat, though. That's my
[00:55:41] problem. I have to figure out if I can
[00:55:42] see how it's in chat. Maybe I can use
[00:55:44] the tablet and I can see what's in chat
[00:55:47] on whatnot, but I won't be able to see
[00:55:49] what's in chat on the other places.
[00:55:51] H a buff.
[00:55:54] You want to try a
[00:55:57] buff? They are not in the buy it nows.
[00:56:00] They are I can do I can run them. There
[00:56:03] are these ones if somebody wanted to go
[00:56:05] for some buffs and intelligent
[00:56:07] things. They are a dollar for those if
[00:56:10] you want to try them. I'll put them up
[00:56:12] here. What happened to the
[00:56:15] mouse? Am I losing power on my
[00:56:19] mouse? Better not be that. That's a buff
[00:56:22] box if that's what you're looking for.
[00:56:24] We may maybe get some buff or uh who
[00:56:27] knows what you get. Buff of some
[00:56:32] kind. It seems the mouse is freezing on
[00:56:35] me.
[00:56:36] [Music]
[00:56:46] Oh, you guys are going to be worried.
[00:56:48] You don't want to be part of that next
[00:56:50] adventure.
[00:56:52] There's going to be problems if you
[00:56:53] don't get through
[00:56:55] it. Luke
[00:56:58] understands. Luke, what you get, my
[00:57:01] friend? Ooh, is it a critical? I like
[00:57:04] it. You got a critical hit. So, Loop,
[00:57:07] because it does not say the pack there,
[00:57:09] you do not get the pack, but you get one
[00:57:10] of the cards. A single. Yeah. From us.
[00:57:12] Now, I'm going to do
[00:57:15] this. We open one of these the other
[00:57:18] day.
[00:57:31] Here to
[00:57:33] go. We open up some
[00:57:37] Calaldheim. All right. And I wanted to
[00:57:39] see if you wanted one of these ones
[00:57:42] instead as a uh the sign card. They're
[00:57:45] foils there. We'll put Let me get them
[00:57:47] out here so you can see. Turn the camo
[00:57:50] off. There you go. That way you can see
[00:57:52] what I'm showing
[00:57:54] you. Get your choice of any of these
[00:57:56] ones. Garl, giant ox, broken wings,
[00:57:59] invoke
[00:58:00] divine, snowfield, sinkhole, fall of the
[00:58:03] impostor, and your glimpse cosmos. You
[00:58:06] can sign one of those and hand them out.
[00:58:08] That's what we do with those when you
[00:58:09] don't get your uh when you don't get the
[00:58:10] pack, you get one of the singles there.
[00:58:12] The land. We'll give you the land.
[00:58:15] Snowland. Nice one there. That's a good
[00:58:18] one. Do you want me to sign it or you
[00:58:20] want me to just send it back? It's up to
[00:58:29] you. All right. Don't sign. All right.
[00:58:32] We'll send that
[00:58:36] back. Ah, snowlands are nice. I know
[00:58:39] people like those snowlands. They come
[00:58:41] out in a decent This some of these are
[00:58:42] decent price, too. Some of them are like
[00:58:43] 5 to 10 bucks even at times. So there we
[00:58:46] go,
[00:58:51] Luke. But I don't know what this one
[00:58:53] was. Normally it's the rare ones that
[00:58:55] are like that or the but sometimes we
[00:58:58] have a good one
[00:58:59] here that we don't know about. There you
[00:59:02] go, Luke, my
[00:59:05] friend. Get yourself a snow land.
[00:59:09] Then we'll give a choice out of those
[00:59:10] ones next for somebody if we do any more
[00:59:12] of them. Yes, you got yourself a
[00:59:15] critical. You're very welcome. And they
[00:59:17] got that critical we're going to add in
[00:59:19] for your
[00:59:20] adventure. Thank you, Nico, all the time
[00:59:23] for help. And I do very much appreciate
[00:59:30] that. It helps out a lot. Definitely,
[00:59:33] especially in the hand not
[00:59:35] working. Snow mountains are a couple
[00:59:37] bucks a piece. Yeah.
[00:59:42] Yeah, that's what I mean. Like some of
[00:59:43] them are pretty
[00:59:45] good.
[00:59:47] [Laughter]
[00:59:50] Nikopos. All righty. So, that's what we
[00:59:53] got there. Well, we'll keep going.

[01:01:02] the locked door guy. All right, here's
[01:01:04] the locked door. What should his name
[01:01:13] be?
[01:01:17] Smitty. I kind of like Smitty cuz it
[01:01:20] looks like he's a he could be a smith of
[01:01:22] some
[01:01:22] kind. Getting stuff ready, making all
[01:01:25] those uh items there. Yes. A locksmith,

[01:01:55] their name. Thanks for helping us out
[01:01:57] there. Yeah, sometimes I got to figure
[01:01:58] those out here. Now, I do have like uh
[01:02:01] singles and things like that. Should we
[01:02:02] do those one of those days? Have a
[01:02:03] singles day. Uh maybe like
[01:02:08] tomorrow. Do a different type of game.
[01:02:11] So, no.
[01:02:13] Uh they are all in there now. Nice.
[01:02:18] Now, you know what I'll do is actually
[01:02:21] let's see
[01:02:23] uh what we have options
[01:02:27] of while we're hanging out
[01:02:30] here cuz we should do a little something
[01:02:34] different
[01:02:35] here. Let's see if you like uh we help
[01:02:38] you. Well, we we're building our
[01:02:40] adventure here. We're a few steps
[01:02:42] ahead. We know what we're going to be
[01:02:44] doing there. Heat. Heat.
[01:03:38] No. Why is it doing
[01:03:41] that?
[01:03:43] Whatever. That's all
[01:03:45] right. You get a Yeah, you can adventure
[01:03:48] today.
[01:03:51] Ah, you got your coffee finally running.
[01:03:53] See, that happens sometimes. You kind of
[01:03:54] get it running. I have uh you know what?
[01:03:55] I have our stuff made. I'll have to make
[01:03:57] adjustments on my deck, my stuff here
[01:03:59] later
[01:04:01] today. Be will be a different
[01:04:09] morning. Go over here. See what's going
[01:04:12] on on the regular stuff. We got some
[01:04:15] people hanging
[01:04:17] out. Yeah, it was nice. I uh started
[01:04:19] getting the mornings going and a lot
[01:04:20] more people are on in the mornings now.
[01:04:22] Like a lot of people are on in the
[01:04:24] mornings now compared to what they used
[01:04:25] to be
[01:04:28] on. So it's kind of
[01:04:31] fun. Ah, you got to go to Walmart. Yep.
[01:04:33] Hey, that's what we're doing today. We
[01:04:35] did yesterday did all those kind of
[01:04:37] provisioning things. So I know maybe
[01:04:39] we'll get through it today with a
[01:04:40] different stuff,
[01:04:42] but we're still
[01:04:44] uh running successfully, it seems.
[01:04:55] So, why is that not
[01:04:59] running? Should still be running
[01:05:10] there. No longer running. Ah, damn it.
[01:05:14] Well, that's fun.
[01:05:19] Let's see if we can get that one to
[01:05:22] go fix that again. I don't know. We'll
[01:05:25] find
[01:05:37] out. There we
[01:05:41] [Music]
[01:05:43] go. Turn that on.
[01:05:49] [Music]
[01:05:53] Okay, they got there and there we're
[01:05:56] streaming. Let's see what happens there.
[01:05:59] Ah, there we go. Having a bit of a
[01:06:02] headache for a minute there, so I had to
[01:06:03] make some
[01:06:05] adjustments. Oh, thank you.
[01:06:12] [Music]
[01:06:14] Find me a Bloomberg
[01:06:16] tin. What are you talking about? A
[01:06:18] Bloomber
[01:06:18] [Music]
[01:06:20] tin. Oh. Oh. Kind of like the um the you
[01:06:24] the um
[01:06:27] the kind of like the ones that are from
[01:06:29] uh Fallout. I'm not Fallout, the um Lord
[01:06:33] of the Rings
[01:06:37] ones. All right, everyone. We're hanging
[01:06:40] out here a bit and see what's going
[01:06:43] on. We'll find something maybe going on
[01:06:45] here with you all. Just floating around
[01:06:47] waiting for uh our break to fill up
[01:06:49] today. You guys should be able to see
[01:06:51] what's there. Looking and whatnot. What
[01:06:55] is available
[01:06:57] there? Ah yeah. Yep. That's what those
[01:07:00] are what they are. Those are what they
[01:07:02] are. I know what those
[01:07:04] are. Run into them a few times.
[01:07:33] Okay, that's still going. All right.
[01:07:38] Okay, I think we're still
[01:07:42] [Music]
[01:07:45] good.
[01:07:47] Nice. Hey, that's what happens with me.
[01:07:49] I get the barely anything and my wife or
[01:07:51] my kids get the big hits. But at least I
[01:07:53] get to see somebody getting the big
[01:07:54] hits, you know? I mean, better than
[01:07:55] nothing,
[01:07:58] right? So, we got a projector yesterday
[01:08:00] to set up for the to use here. That was
[01:08:03] pretty fun. We set up a projector
[01:08:04] yesterday and got that going. We watched
[01:08:06] a little bit of a movie last night with
[01:08:07] the kids. That's actually really fun. We
[01:08:11] have to get the table cleaned off so
[01:08:12] that we put it down cuz there's like a
[01:08:13] bed that we can put on top of it and we
[01:08:15] can all lay down on like like a giant
[01:08:16] like uh you know cushion
[01:08:22] area.
[01:08:24] But let's see what's going on here
[01:08:26] today. We opened some packs. We had some
[01:08:29] fun.
[01:08:32] We'll see if we can do it
[01:08:34] [Music]
[01:08:35] more. Yes. Basking in their glory.
[01:08:38] Always. Yeah. Oh, look at my my card. I
[01:08:40] got this. I got the serialized. I got
[01:08:43] this car. Blah blah blah blah blah blah.
[01:08:44] I'm like, yeah, I pulled out $3 out of
[01:08:51] [Music]
[01:08:53] $40. All
[01:08:58] right. Thank you. Thank you for sharing
[01:09:01] that. I do appreciate
[01:09:03] that. Yeah, we uh we just do our thing.
[01:09:06] Like we we're trying to have fun sailing
[01:09:08] around, doing our thing, having a good
[01:09:16] time. Ah, not a bad idea. Random draft
[01:09:21] with Bolt for some type of tournament.
[01:09:25] Hm. Yeah. So, I can kind of
[01:09:29] um I could probably put in the bulk
[01:09:32] stuff that I have
[01:09:34] um and do the different packs and make
[01:09:36] it like a dollar or $2 to
[01:09:40] enter. Then we'll run
[01:09:42] them. Trying to think of a draft
[01:09:44] tournament.
[01:09:46] And then uh like we can set it up
[01:09:51] where kind of like a popper draft in a
[01:09:53] way so that we would do
[01:10:01] um maybe everybody gets three packs. So
[01:10:03] it's $3 something like that. Everybody
[01:10:05] gets three packs and we can do a game.
[01:10:08] But I don't know how we'd be able to do
[01:10:09] that though because we can't do that
[01:10:11] really live. You'd have to get I can't
[01:10:12] play for all people. Hm. I think I'm
[01:10:14] going to have to get you. Maybe we get
[01:10:16] you could get them and then we'll do it
[01:10:18] live once you guys get them and build
[01:10:19] your stuff with it.
[01:10:26] Thank you,
[01:10:28] Nico. I was thinking something like
[01:10:30] maybe that will work. Just thinking
[01:10:32] about
[01:10:33] it. I don't know. We'll find out. Oh,
[01:10:37] there you go. We got Miss Nico coming in
[01:10:39] on number three spot. There we go. How's
[01:10:41] it going, Miss Nico? How's your day
[01:10:42] been?
[01:10:44] Hopefully it's a good
[01:10:47] one. Or hopefully it's starting out as a
[01:10:50] good one there. Maybe that's what we do.
[01:10:52] Something like
[01:11:06] that. Organizing things because I'm
[01:11:09] weird like that. I don't like things
[01:11:10] looking the ways that I'm like, I know
[01:11:12] that doesn't belong there. or I don't
[01:11:13] think it belongs there for whatever my
[01:11:14] reasoning is and it will annoy the crap
[01:11:17] out of me until I address
[01:11:24] it. I think it was just me doing things
[01:11:26] quickly before because my hand wasn't
[01:11:28] working great. So, yes, that's we're
[01:11:31] making some adjustments now. We're
[01:11:32] fixing things here.
[01:11:44] Ah, that's randomly in
[01:11:51] there. I don't like how that one was
[01:11:53] randomly in there. That was
[01:11:56] silly. Distracted, James. I know. I'm
[01:12:02] distracted. There we go. Put those over
[01:12:05] there.
[01:12:09] put all those right here. Ah, that's
[01:12:12] what we'll do. Get rid of those oninity
[01:12:14] with our uh our brake stuff like you
[01:12:17] maybe do something like that. We'll send
[01:12:18] it out. It'll be a cheap one. You guys
[01:12:19] will get them. We'll do that. Let me get
[01:12:22] that kind for the break. That's not a
[01:12:24] bad idea actually. Not a bad idea. We
[01:12:25] might do something like that. Oh, here
[01:12:28] we go. Miss Nicole coming again.
[01:12:35] You have been getting a lot of luck. It
[01:12:38] does seem Yeah. Well, it happens
[01:12:39] sometimes. You you It happens when uh
[01:12:41] when some sometimes it seems like
[01:12:43] couples will take one person will take
[01:12:45] all the luck at one point and the other
[01:12:46] person like Jesus like I got nothing
[01:12:48] right now and then every now and again
[01:12:49] it switches back but most of the time it
[01:12:50] goes to the women. I'm just going to say
[01:12:52] it just I don't I don't know why it just
[01:12:53] happens to
[01:13:06] [Laughter]
[01:13:09] got only one spot left
[01:13:13] everybody. Or is there only two? I think
[01:13:16] there's only one spot
[01:13:17] left. There's only one spot left in the
[01:13:20] break here. Ah, there we go.
[01:13:26] No, that Jewel Lotus lock that that's
[01:13:28] crazy. I have to admit I was I was like
[01:13:30] I can't believe that because I've been
[01:13:33] trying to get myself a Jew lotus for so
[01:13:35] long and then I get like the one pack
[01:13:36] I'm like hey what about this one that we
[01:13:37] have left over. Yeah, let's take that
[01:13:38] and boom, Jewel Lotus.
[01:13:41] Like cuz I had been debating on opening
[01:13:44] it myself. But I'm happy you got it
[01:13:45] though. It's like one of those things
[01:13:46] like I'm happy you guys get them but at
[01:13:47] the same time like a damn it I was this
[01:13:49] close. I can't even do this close
[01:13:51] anymore because my pinky sticks out. I
[01:13:52] was like,
[01:13:59] [Music]
[01:14:01] "Get he was he was and I I didn't open
[01:14:04] it. I should have opened it." I
[01:14:06] know. I should have opened it. That's
[01:14:09] one of those scenarios where you're
[01:14:10] like, "Oh, damn it. I should have done
[01:14:14] that." That's okay.
[01:14:23] There we
[01:14:25] go. Hey
[01:14:31] there. Yeah,
[01:14:34] exactly. Exactly. The ones that got
[01:14:36] banned, he redeemed some of his money
[01:14:37] back because he got the nice one. Hey,
[01:14:39] that happens, too. So, like I felt
[01:14:40] wicked bad for some people cuz I know
[01:14:42] some people when the Jewel Lotus was
[01:14:43] coming out, like first came out and
[01:14:44] that, they were going after it hard.
[01:14:45] bought a bunch of packs, got like four
[01:14:47] or five, got the whole set of them, and
[01:14:50] we're like, "Sweet, I got all this." And
[01:14:51] then all of a sudden it gets banned and
[01:14:52] like the money that they put into it
[01:14:53] like means almost nothing compared to
[01:14:56] But I mean, they had fun doing it. But
[01:14:57] at the same time, it's one of
[01:14:59] those that stinks. Hey Oblivion, how's
[01:15:03] it going, my friend? How you
[01:15:05] been? Hopefully you're having a good
[01:15:06] one.
[01:15:12] Just talking about you said how I missed
[01:15:14] out on a jeweled lotus because I didn't
[01:15:16] open the pack. You told me to. I know.
[01:15:20] One spot left in our break everybody
[01:15:22] while we hang out here waiting. I might
[01:15:25] have to have another cup of
[01:15:30] coffee. That's too many
[01:15:32] coffees. No, it isn't. There's not too
[01:15:35] many coffees. I don't think you can say
[01:15:36] that ever. Is it possible to say too
[01:15:38] much coffee?
[01:15:42] I don't know.
[01:15:54] Maybe. Coffee time again. I'm going to
[01:15:56] run another giveaway while I go and get
[01:15:58] my
[01:16:00] coffee. Let's run another giveaway while
[01:16:02] I get my
[01:16:05] coffee. Go get a coffee.
[01:16:15] Nice. That is awesome, buddy. That is so
[01:16:20] cool. Congratulations.
[01:16:41] Oh
[01:16:43] [ __ ] Almost dropped
[01:16:57] it. You know what? I have an
[01:17:02] idea. So, I think I can do things from
[01:17:06] there. I have an
[01:17:10] [Music]
[01:17:12] idea. Going to wait for the coffee to
[01:17:14] finish. I mean, wait for the last spot
[01:17:16] to finish. Unless it happens to be
[01:17:17] finished right now and we're down to
[01:17:19] none. That means I get to uh we get to
[01:17:21] do our break. I have an idea of what
[01:17:23] we're doing
[01:17:25] here. We have one spot left. All right.
[01:17:28] Here we go.
[01:17:49] Dobby. Last spot in it.
[01:17:55] Yes. All right. We got one spot left
[01:17:57] there in that break. Let's see if I can
[01:18:00] uh do something here. I was
[01:18:04] thinking can do
[01:18:10] this and I can
[01:18:14] um there go
[01:18:19] there. All right, let's
[01:18:23] see. I can see you guys. I can see
[01:18:26] everything going
[01:18:27] on. I don't know if I can
[01:18:31] uh talk where you can hear me. H Let's
[01:18:34] see if we can figure that one
[01:18:37] out. Wait for me to
[01:18:44] talk. No, no, no,
[01:18:52] no. What I will do then is this. Let's
[01:18:55] try
[01:18:56] this. We're going to be
[01:18:59] uh quiet for a minute. We're going to
[01:19:01] hang out. Last spot in the break and I
[01:19:05] go sit out front
[01:19:06] here with all of
[01:19:09] you. We're going to go sit out back and
[01:19:12] I am going to uh have my coffee while we
[01:19:14] sit out back. But this is what's going
[01:19:16] to happen. You got to come with
[01:19:18] me. We're going to do this. We're going
[01:19:21] to change the camera view so you guys
[01:19:23] can come with me.
[01:19:27] Let's do that
[01:19:36] now. If I can get it. Where is it?
[01:19:39] Thought I had the camera option to
[01:19:40] switch it
[01:19:45] here. Ah, you can see my ugly
[01:19:49] mug. There we go. This is what we're
[01:19:51] going to do now. Going to go for a walk.
[01:19:54] bring our coffee out here. I'mma break a
[01:19:57] toe on something in the way. Then we're
[01:19:59] going to go out here and we're going to
[01:20:00] sit outside. Yeah.
[01:20:02] Have some coffee while we wait for the
[01:20:05] uh
[01:20:42] Thank you.
[01:20:55] [Music]
[01:21:23] That's
[01:21:43] Heat. Heat.
[01:22:15] All
[01:22:29] right. So, we have
[01:22:49] has completed.
[01:23:07] [Music]
[01:23:37] Yes. All
[01:24:04] right, audio should be there
[01:24:05] now. Heat. Heat.
[01:25:17] The audio should not be gone.
[01:25:22] Thank
[01:25:55] All right. How's the audio now? We're
[01:25:58] doing some testing on some things. Let's
[01:25:59] see if the audio works now. Can you hear
[01:26:02] us? Can you hear me now? Can you hear me
[01:26:05] now? Hear you. All right, it works now.
[01:26:08] Perfect. My bad on that one. I I forgot
[01:26:10] to change the setting to the right
[01:26:11] camera button and I can't do it from
[01:26:12] here. Hey, thank you. We got about a
[01:26:14] minute left in the break. I mean, in the
[01:26:16] giveaway before we start our break.
[01:26:18] We're just kind of hanging out here in
[01:26:19] the uh I got to get a stand to hold this
[01:26:20] on. I do have one, too. Oh, but it's not
[01:26:23] here. Damn it. It's what happens when
[01:26:26] you don't have all your stuff where you
[01:26:27] are. But there we are in the background.
[01:26:29] You can see that's where, like I said,
[01:26:31] Puerto Rico there. Having some fun just
[01:26:33] hanging out, drinking our coffee while
[01:26:35] this uh finishes there. next
[01:26:38] time. It is a nice view. I know. Not bad
[01:26:41] seeing the uh the jungle out there.
[01:26:44] We'll uh we'll be uh told the kids we'll
[01:26:46] take them out. I guess there's some
[01:26:47] natural water slides and
[01:26:49] [ __ ] I swear so much. One of the things
[01:26:51] I got to work on New Year's thing, you
[01:26:53] know. I didn't have any really
[01:26:54] resolutions because I'm not I'm perfect.
[01:26:56] You know, you can't have a resolution.
[01:26:58] I'm joking. I don't believe in
[01:26:59] resolutions for the couple of reasons.
[01:27:01] you should be changing and working on
[01:27:02] yourself all the time. When you notice
[01:27:04] there's something wrong or there's
[01:27:05] something that you need to work on, you
[01:27:06] shouldn't just wait for a New Year's
[01:27:07] resolution for that. That's part of the
[01:27:08] reason why. And the second reason is
[01:27:11] um I feel like New Year's resolutions
[01:27:14] are ones that you never actually
[01:27:15] accomplish through the year. So if you
[01:27:16] set a smaller goal that you can
[01:27:17] accomplish on a regular basis, yeah,
[01:27:19] maybe there's a big thing you'd like to
[01:27:20] get to at the end of the year, but at
[01:27:22] least break it into smaller chunks, you
[01:27:24] can actually accomplish it. That's
[01:27:26] that's why I don't do
[01:27:28] those. Yes. They set you up to fail.
[01:27:30] Exactly. Exactly. All right, Big Dave,
[01:27:33] we got that giveaway there and that
[01:27:34] means we're going to go inside and we
[01:27:36] will do the uh do our break and we'll
[01:27:38] get our adventuring going. All right,
[01:27:40] did not finish my coffee, but hey, maybe
[01:27:43] you guys will get a view here. Uh we'll
[01:27:45] throw out the view there again. Let me
[01:27:47] come back and grab all of our stuff,
[01:27:48] move over, come inside, have some fun
[01:27:51] and sitting down here and we're going to
[01:27:53] get our break going now. Let's uh flip
[01:27:56] that around so you can see a better
[01:27:57] view.
[01:28:02] and we'll go
[01:28:09] with that
[01:28:15] one. There you go. There's that
[01:28:21] one. There you go. I think we're good
[01:28:23] now with that. I just need to get the
[01:28:25] thing like Yeah.
[01:28:29] And now let's get into it.
[01:28:33] All righty.
[01:28:35] So, that being said, we're back over
[01:28:38] here in the main area to do the
[01:28:42] break and get our adventuring going. Ah,
[01:28:45] Adventure
[01:28:47] Time. We love Adventure Time. I wanted
[01:28:50] to have a better name and something like
[01:28:52] that, but I I that was already taken.
[01:28:54] You know, that one was already taken.
[01:28:56] Can't do anything about that. All right,
[01:28:58] there's our break, though. I pinged
[01:29:00] everybody, so hopefully our friend
[01:29:01] there,
[01:29:03] um,
[01:29:05] EMTT got the
[01:29:07] notification. So, we're going back over
[01:29:11] [Music]
[01:29:13] here. Ah, the morning coffee with me. I
[01:29:15] like it, actually. Not a bad one. All
[01:29:17] right, EMT, welcome back. Hey, Happy
[01:29:19] Bunny. All right, so here we go. I like
[01:29:22] the idea of that. Not a bad idea. We can
[01:29:23] just do morning coffee while
[01:29:24] everything's going, chat, hang out,
[01:29:26] different parts of the boat. I'll also
[01:29:28] get my uh I have to get my um see if I
[01:29:31] can set up the uh the camera on a a
[01:29:36] tripod thing so it make it a little
[01:29:37] easier to talk with you guys, you
[01:29:39] know. All right, here we
[01:29:43] go. Yesterday, uh you ended up you you
[01:29:47] won. You guys won you beat him. You
[01:29:49] ended up beating him. So there you
[01:29:51] go.
[01:29:54] Oblivion. I see it. Oblivion. We'll get
[01:29:57] that in Hazer Pore and Big Dave. We got

[01:30:04] Um Oblivion. Then we'll do our friend
[01:30:06] our break here. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9. Give
[01:30:10] me a number between 1 and
[01:30:13] 10, my friend. And we'll uh we'll do our
[01:30:15] shuffling
[01:30:17] here. And then we'll give you and then
[01:30:19] we'll pick out the card.
[01:30:22] All right. If you're still if you're not

[01:30:25] buddy
[01:30:27] Big. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate
[01:30:29] it, everybody. You're nice and flexible.
[01:30:31] We just hang out here. We're not trying
[01:30:32] to like 10 for Big. So, let's see if uh
[01:30:35] Hazer comes back. Hazer doesn't give us
[01:30:37] a number. We'll just go with you and
[01:30:39] we'll just give Hazer one randomly
[01:30:41] later. All right, here we go. We're
[01:30:43] going to go over switch over to our
[01:30:45] friend there.
[01:30:57] What is going on
[01:31:02] here? That was
[01:31:10] weird.
[01:31:14] Okay. Why is that not working?
[01:31:18] [Music]
[01:31:31] Do we fix it or
[01:31:34] not? There we go. Sorry that the the
[01:31:37] game broke for a second. I was acting
[01:31:38] weird. There's your number 10, by the
[01:31:40] way. Is this park re-entry? Where is the
[01:31:44] rare? Oh, the rare was off by three
[01:31:46] there. Let's get your name written on

[01:32:13] packs. Let me get those for you.
[01:32:18] I thought I put them over here, but
[01:32:19] maybe I didn't. Maybe they're underneath
[01:32:21] me. Oh, I'm sitting on them. All right,
[01:32:25] here we go. We'll get the ones from
[01:32:26] sitting on them. There you go, my
[01:32:38] friend. Got a the box down here holding
[01:32:42] everything.

[01:34:04] buddy. There we go. That's not a good

[01:35:19] adventuring today. And now, Miss Nico, I
[01:35:23] know you said you get this. Are you
[01:35:24] going to use all the spots for yourself
[01:35:26] and get the uh or do we want to um have
[01:35:29] other people take over some of your
[01:35:30] spots to play? You got to let me know on
[01:35:35] that. Yes, it is a good one to run
[01:35:37] there. Let me write your name on the
[01:35:38] back of
[01:35:42] that. Let me do this.
[01:35:49] Oblivion
[01:35:51] Wilder. Get your name on that. Nice one
[01:35:54] there, my friend. Put it in a top
[01:36:01] loader. My hand doesn't work so well
[01:36:04] holding things straight. Not weird that
[01:36:06] your pinky, I guess, stabilizes more
[01:36:07] than you
[01:36:09] expect. There we go. That was a nice
[01:36:12] one. Now, we're going to finish. We're
[01:36:13] going to do our break cuz that's what I
[01:36:16] said. It is break
[01:36:19] time. All right, here we go. We have
[01:36:21] We're going to do it this way. We're
[01:36:22] going to start out wild. I mean a
[01:36:24] dominaria. Then we're going to go
[01:36:26] straight haven. Then go infinity and
[01:36:28] then we'll go wild. We'll go modern
[01:36:30] mystery and the collector at the end
[01:36:35] there. Ah, okay. Okay. One for spicy and
[01:36:37] one for you. Perfect. Thank you. So,
[01:36:39] there we are.
[01:36:42] We got those. So, let me see. EMT, Miss
[01:36:46] Nico, which one was uh the I got to
[01:36:49] check those for the the
[01:36:54] gifts. Spicy got number five. Okay,
[01:37:02] Spicy. Spicy was number
[01:37:05] five and number four was Nico.
[01:37:17] Nico,
[01:37:19] perfect. And then there we go. The rest
[01:37:21] are set up. Perfecto. So there's one,
[01:37:24] there's EMT, one,
[01:37:27] two,
[01:37:29] three, four people in our raid today.
[01:37:33] All right, you guys are going to get
[01:37:34] ready
[01:37:35] here. All right, we're going to see what
[01:37:37] we got going in the break right now. And
[01:37:38] we're starting with
[01:37:40] Dominaria. Good luck, my friends. Let's
[01:37:43] see what you get. Here we
[01:37:46] are. Good luck. Good luck. Good
[01:37:49] luck. I'm going to do something.
[01:37:51] Actually, let me do this
[01:37:53] [Music]
[01:37:55] quickly. We don't need that on
[01:37:58] anymore. I'm going to do this.
[01:38:12] That was
[01:38:13] weird. Why' that
[01:38:19] [Music]
[01:38:21] stop? You're going to do this.
[01:38:25] [Music]
[01:38:41] [Music]
[01:38:57] H.
[01:39:27] I can't do that now. Never mind. Try
[01:39:28] that later. I have to look into
[01:39:29] something. Sorry about
[01:39:30] that. One, two, three, four, five, six,
[01:39:34] seven, eight. Put those spoilers at the
[01:39:37] end here. What I was going to do is
[01:39:39] start on mobile priority for um for
[01:39:42] Starlink here. That way I would get
[01:39:44] better data connection and not have to
[01:39:46] worry as much. But I think it's I don't
[01:39:47] know if it's going to charge me the
[01:39:48] entire time or just the time like for
[01:39:51] everything I use prior cuz it says
[01:39:53] everything after you hit your limit. But
[01:39:55] I don't know if it's going to just be
[01:39:56] from this point on until now. Cuz if it
[01:39:58] is, I just use it for the times that
[01:39:59] we're doing our pack openings or like
[01:40:01] our brakes to keep everything like nice
[01:40:02] and clear. But I don't know. I'll have
[01:40:04] to check it though a little bit.
[01:40:07] Hey Frank, how you doing? Thank you.
[01:40:10] Thank you. Oh, you're going to VA. Why
[01:40:12] are you going there? Tangled eyelet,
[01:40:14] Vanquisher's Axe, Bone Splinters,
[01:40:17] Fraxian Espinos, Colossal Growth,
[01:40:20] Mirror's Outr Rider, Clockwork
[01:40:22] Drawbridge, Vine Shaper Prodigy, Mesa
[01:40:25] Cavalier, Wood Ridge, Wooded Ridgeline,
[01:40:29] Love Song of Night and Day, Yoshan,
[01:40:31] Yosha Declares War, Urg, Spawn of
[01:40:36] Tur,
[01:40:37] Forest, and Defiler of Dreams. Nice
[01:40:41] rare. Or would there a fireex in there?
[01:40:44] That was a nice pick up with the Defiler
[01:40:45] of Dreams on
[01:40:48] that. There you
[01:40:56] go. I got to If you guys want to give me
[01:40:58] a second, I can search that and find out
[01:41:01] about the data. If we turn it on and
[01:41:03] off, it'll like put it on to just the
[01:41:04] part it is there. I got to find that out
[01:41:06] with Starlink. I'd have to take a minute
[01:41:08] and figure that out.
[01:41:13] Oh, not bad. Not bad. Then it's an hour.
[01:41:15] That's not
[01:41:18] bad. Yeah, that makes sense. Like some
[01:41:20] places are like you get them and they're
[01:41:21] a lot more expensive. So I understand
[01:41:23] what you're saying there. So all right,
[01:41:24] we're going to go
[01:41:26] on. Yes,
[01:41:28] exactly. All right. So give me a second
[01:41:30] here. I'm going to check something.
[01:41:58] Let's
[01:42:08] see. Okay, that's what I'm doing. Aha.
[01:42:27] Okay, let's do
[01:42:37] that. We'll see if it works there.
[01:42:39] Hopefully, it picks up. So, it'll start
[01:42:41] working here very
[01:42:43] shortly. So, we get mobile priority data
[01:42:46] and do better with our internet
[01:42:48] connection. Let's see if that works.
[01:42:50] We're going to do that for a minute here
[01:42:52] and see how this
[01:42:53] goes. All right. Hopefully, we don't
[01:42:56] have any problems. We're going to see
[01:42:57] how it works here. Looks like we're
[01:43:00] doing pretty
[01:43:02] good. Our connections getting better
[01:43:05] even. Oh, it might have done it. Is it
[01:43:07] working the way we expect and want?
[01:43:10] Maybe, maybe. We shall
[01:43:14] see. Can you guys see it all in these
[01:43:17] locations? I think we're good
[01:43:24] there. If you guys want to watch on
[01:43:26] YouTube and help us out there, that does
[01:43:28] help always. And here we are. I think
[01:43:30] we're good
[01:43:31] now. We're running smooth. Is it nice?
[01:43:35] All right. So, that's what I think I'm
[01:43:37] going to do now. Make sure we run smooth
[01:43:38] and do that when we have our brake
[01:43:39] going. All right, here we go. That way
[01:43:41] we can, you know, hanging out when we're
[01:43:43] chilling beforehand. That's fine. We
[01:43:44] don't need to worry about it too much.
[01:43:45] But now we can run
[01:43:48] smoother. All right, here we go. Next
[01:43:50] one is a silver
[01:43:55] quill. Nope, that's running wrapping
[01:43:57] around my arm. I don't like that. All

[01:44:31] think that will work better with our
[01:44:32] brakes and stuff like that. That way we
[01:44:35] can do those and you can see all the
[01:44:36] packs better.
[01:44:38] Aha. Intellente. I'm trying to figure
[01:44:41] out how to use it. Like I feel like I
[01:44:43] there's a use for that and I just have
[01:44:44] not figured out how to use it correctly
[01:44:47] yet. Seems like we might be breaking up
[01:44:49] a little bit
[01:44:52] still. Uhoh. Did we just freeze

[01:45:36] priority on.
[01:45:54] All right, we should be going
[01:45:57] now. There we go. We should be good now.
[01:46:00] Mobile priority should not have any more
[01:46:02] freezing.
[01:46:04] And if we do, mobile priority is not
[01:46:06] working.
[01:46:10] Uh, here we go. For our next one, we

[01:53:37] Park planes. These are big hits, too.
[01:53:39] These are nice ones. And then, oh,
[01:53:41] Chasm, deepest growth in the foil
[01:53:45] showcase with a coffee token.
[01:53:48] Congratulations on that, guys.
[01:53:52] Nice pickup. I'm going to have to talk
[01:53:54] to somebody about the my mobile priority
[01:53:56] data not being so priority
[01:54:00] seeming to make a comment and be like,
[01:54:02] "Hey, what happened to mobile priority?
[01:54:04] You're supposed to be better at the top.
[01:54:06] I'm not I'm breaking up here. I get only
[01:54:09] goes all the way down to low. Might as
[01:54:11] well not even keep the mobile priority
[01:54:12] is in a
[01:54:13] way. It's only doing like two megs
[01:54:16] instead of the 20 that it can be up to,
[01:54:18] which is
[01:54:20] weird. Very weird there. We'll see
[01:54:24] though. We put those
[01:54:27] away. All
[01:54:34] right. And we'll see what's going on
[01:54:36] there.
[01:54:55] Anyways, there we go. That's what we got
[01:54:57] on those. So, what I'm going to use now
[01:54:59] though is I'm going to use six of these
[01:55:01] cards as the um proxies. So, we're going
[01:55:04] to do one, two, three, four, five, and
[01:55:08] six for our proxies.
[01:55:10] And then the rest will go and get
[01:55:12] shuffled up with everybody else. We're
[01:55:14] going to write down. You guys get your
[01:55:15] choice of weapons and stuff like that to
[01:55:18] do the adventure
[01:55:19] with. And we're going to go from there
[01:55:21] and see what happens with those. It's
[01:55:24] being a little silly on me and I don't
[01:55:25] like it. Robo foes for a second. Well,
[01:55:28] that's what I'm trying to say. Like
[01:55:29] weirdly, I'm I just p I did the no
[01:55:31] mobile priority and it doesn't seem like
[01:55:33] I'm getting too much of a priority
[01:55:36] [Applause]
[01:55:37] here. So, tell me I'm uh I don't know,
[01:55:41] just not not the best connection at the
[01:55:43] moment. We'll
[01:55:44] see. But we got all those together.
[01:55:46] We're going to finish the brake. That
[01:55:48] way you can uh see everything that was
[01:55:50] done with the brake. Then we'll go back
[01:55:51] to the regular stuff here and uh see
[01:55:54] what
[01:55:55] happens. Okay, so here we We're going to
[01:55:58] write
[01:55:59] down everything on this which
[01:56:03] is
[01:56:06] weapon. We have um
[01:56:11] health. We have
[01:56:14] weapon. We have
[01:56:18] health. We have
[01:56:20] um what is the other one? We have a
[01:56:24] buff. We have safe haven.
[01:56:28] All right. So, I'm going to take these.
[01:56:31] Pick it up. Put that over
[01:56:33] there. Put that over
[01:56:36] there. Pick that up. Pick that up. Pick
[01:56:39] that
[01:56:40] up. Maybe it's comp inside joke.
[01:56:44] Yes. Yeah. An inside joke with them.
[01:56:47] Yes, I know. Got to call out. I'll ping
[01:56:49] him later. But hey, what's going on
[01:56:51] here? All right. Here we are, my
[01:56:54] friends.
[01:56:58] We are going to give me a number between
[01:56:59] one and
[01:57:01] um five. Somebody that's in the
[01:57:11] break. One, two,
[01:57:16] three, four. All right, that's how we're
[01:57:18] shuffling those up. I'm going to take
[01:57:20] these cards and put them here because we
[01:57:22] do those later on. Then I'm going to
[01:57:24] take these and this is what we're going
[01:57:25] to do. Number
[01:57:28] one is to our first friend in our break
[01:57:31] spot. So that goes to
[01:57:40] EMT. Then the second one goes to EMT
[01:57:46] also. All right. Third one goes to Miss
[01:57:49] Nico.
[01:57:54] Okay. Nope. Nope. Not that
[01:57:57] way. Then the next one goes to
[01:58:04] Nico. Then the next one goes to
[01:58:12] Spicy. Then Miss
[01:58:19] Nico. All right.
[01:58:22] So, I do believe you all should be able
[01:58:26] to see the cards here. Let me just
[01:58:30] double check. But you should be able to
[01:58:31] see everything. And now I can switch to
[01:58:33] my regular glasses that the sun is down
[01:58:35] enough or up enough. I
[01:58:37] mean, that I can see past. No, I see the
[01:58:40] sun in my eyes right now.
[01:58:43] Perfect. You like
[01:58:46] it? So, there you go. I believe you all
[01:58:48] can see it. All right. Here we go. So,
[01:58:51] we're going to do this. I need somebody
[01:58:54] in the break to tell me a number between
[01:58:57] 1
[01:58:59] and five. So, I can stop shuffling here.
[01:59:02] And that

[02:02:55] need to know what you want.
[02:03:02] So we can update your character and get
[02:03:05] you guys rolling in the adventure in the
[02:03:07] wasteland
[02:03:12] here. Never done it. All right, some
[02:03:15] tips. So you are a wastelander. You're
[02:03:19] wandering through a vault here and you
[02:03:22] bump into things. You might be bumping
[02:03:23] into a raider's small raider coming at
[02:03:25] you. Maybe there's a bug of some kind
[02:03:27] coming toward you. Maybe there's a
[02:03:28] mediumsiz raider that comes in to attack
[02:03:30] you. We're not really sure, but you can
[02:03:32] have things like agility. You have some
[02:03:34] weapons. Oh, no. That was You had a
[02:03:36] weapon here, pistol. You can do a knife.
[02:03:38] You do a plasma rifle. You can have an
[02:03:40] assault rifle. You can have a
[02:03:42] sword. Some people are lucky where they
[02:03:45] got a gatling gun. They got a
[02:03:47] flamethrower. Some people got a pirate
[02:03:49] sword. Some people got a
[02:03:51] mace. Then we also have you can get ammo
[02:03:54] and all kinds of things. But you want to
[02:03:55] wander around cuz eventually you're
[02:03:57] going to run into something where you
[02:03:59] might have to wander in and beat some
[02:04:00] ghouls
[02:04:01] here. So you go and roll and we want to
[02:04:04] see what you get. And each weapon is
[02:04:05] worth a certain amount for your uh so
[02:04:08] like swords are plus five added onto a
[02:04:10] roll. So it gives you a better chance of
[02:04:12] hitting like you know a buff kind. Then
[02:04:14] then your
[02:04:16] um uh other ones are everywhere from
[02:04:19] plus two to plus five six currently cuz
[02:04:23] we don't have a we don't have anything
[02:04:24] higher than that. But maybe once you get
[02:04:27] um maybe uh maybe in the next levels or
[02:04:31] the next chapter of uh of the adventure,
[02:04:33] you'll be able to do things like that
[02:04:34] and dual wield some
[02:04:37] items like our buddy um Archer figured
[02:04:40] out how to dual wield um swords. a sword
[02:04:43] and a and a pistol
[02:04:51] here. Give EMTT some Pogs. I like
[02:04:59] it. You had a
[02:05:03] um Let me check what your other thing
[02:05:06] was. The last one, Miss Nico, you
[02:05:10] had was you had a health choice. Health
[02:05:18] health. You got health. You got two
[02:05:20] healths. That's what it was. You got two
[02:05:22] health
[02:05:25] choices. Spicy got weapons choice.
[02:05:29] Yes. Ah, not a problem. Not a problem. I
[02:05:32] understand that. Hey, I get that, too. I
[02:05:34] don't I don't listen all the time myself
[02:05:35] when you get excited about the cards. I
[02:05:37] forget, too. That's why I write them
[02:05:41] down. I wish they allowed me to
[02:05:43] randomize stuff at the end of a break,
[02:05:46] not have to do it in the middle of it,
[02:05:47] cuz that would allow you guys like buy
[02:05:49] in and then I can randomize it all at
[02:05:50] the end and you'll just get something
[02:05:52] saying weapon or whatever for your spot
[02:05:54] or health or something. That way you can
[02:05:56] see it even on like uh your receipt,
[02:05:58] things like that. That'll help keep
[02:05:59] track of
[02:06:02] things.
[02:06:09] Here we
[02:06:13] go. I got all of them handed out
[02:06:15] here. Now we're going to put them in the
[02:06:17] sleep packs here. You going to give your
[02:06:19] choice to EMT. Oh, nice. Well, look at
[02:06:21] that. Spicy. Spicy gave his weapon
[02:06:23] choice to you, EMT. All right, EMT, you
[02:06:27] had your choices of a weapon. So, you
[02:06:29] got two weapons choices now because one
[02:06:31] of yours was a weapon.
[02:06:33] And then your other one was a
[02:06:35] um buff choice. Now the buff choices are
[02:06:39] nice because you get to choose a
[02:06:40] strength buff, an agility buff, an
[02:06:43] intelligence
[02:06:45] buff, an engineering buff, or a um luck
[02:06:50] buff. Now, I don't have the luck buff
[02:06:52] for some reason. And the image
[02:06:54] disappeared. EMT gets one of your
[02:06:56] health. Nice. So, it looks like we're
[02:06:58] going to go EMT. You're going to get two
[02:07:00] weapons choices and a health choice
[02:07:03] here.
[02:07:07] Um along with your buff
[02:07:09] choice. Nice. Got some friends. We like
[02:07:13] having friends and adventures. And five
[02:07:15] pogs. Nice. There you go
[02:07:18] everybody. Adventuring along, being
[02:07:20] friendly, sharing with your community.
[02:07:24] That's how we like it.
[02:07:34] We got some people with health
[02:07:36] packs extra. We trading with everybody.
[02:07:39] You decided what you're
[02:07:41] getting. All right, I'll put those in
[02:07:43] there now that I see what everybody got.
[02:07:46] Or we'll
[02:07:49] see.
[02:07:52] Oh, now you already added them in.
[02:07:55] [Music]
[02:07:59] Well, thank you for doing that
[02:08:02] already. Thank you. Thank you. You're
[02:08:05] adding some of it in there. Thank you. I
[02:08:06] appreciate that a lot. Very much
[02:08:12] appreciated. Yeah, I'm trying to get all
[02:08:14] the packs away so we can get our uh
[02:08:16] stuff away
[02:08:18] here. Not bad, Miss Nico. Miss Nico was
[02:08:22] over here with this one. The God of
[02:08:23] Souls and Öza was nice of pickup. That's
[02:08:25] a nice pickup
[02:08:31] there. I get what you're
[02:08:36] saying. It seems like uh you've got a
[02:08:38] look, a digital look coming towards you,
[02:08:40] Nico from Miss
[02:08:43] Nico. She's got the eyes like my wife
[02:08:46] gave me earlier today, but that's just
[02:08:47] going through through the computer
[02:08:48] screen right now.
[02:08:57] All right, here we go. Let's put these
[02:08:59] ones all
[02:09:01] together and we'll get those put away
[02:09:04] while we're hanging out here and then
[02:09:05] we're going to do our adventuring once
[02:09:07] you guys have decided since you decided
[02:09:08] already what you wanted. Now, do you
[02:09:10] guys want to go to any of the um safe
[02:09:13] havens before you go wandering off into
[02:09:16] your next
[02:09:18] encounter? See what's going on there.
[02:09:45] No, we did not use that. We did not use
[02:09:47] the one for the one arm. We did not
[02:09:49] check out the one arm guy yet.
[02:09:58] Let's go to the one arm. All right. I
[02:10:00] like it. So, you guys decide. I'll just
[02:10:03] show it off here. Well, anyways, I got
[02:10:05] all your things packed packed up here.
[02:10:06] So, you got all your stuff together.
[02:10:08] Just want to let you guys see
[02:10:10] it. Okay, you guys head off to the one-
[02:10:13] arm
[02:10:14] bender. That one arm bender you wander
[02:10:17] in and one arm bender is uh one arm
[02:10:21] Willie. We call him Willie. Willie one
[02:10:28] arm is uh the one- arm bender. That's
[02:10:31] his name. So you go over there and he's
[02:10:34] like, "Oh, how did you get into my
[02:10:36] location?" He's not too happy with you.
[02:10:38] No one gets into where his place is. No
[02:10:40] one's here. How did you get into
[02:10:42] me? That doesn't sound right. What are
[02:10:45] you doing
[02:10:47] here? Willie is wondering what you're
[02:10:49] doing
[02:10:50] here. Why are you hanging out with
[02:10:53] Willie? Now, we have Miss Nico. I'm
[02:10:57] going to give everybody one of the uh
[02:10:59] Infinity packs from the break here cuz
[02:11:00] that's what I was saying. We're getting
[02:11:01] rid of our our bulk
[02:11:04] stuff today. So, we're going to give
[02:11:06] everybody one plus uh need the giggity.
[02:11:10] You're very welcome. Well, I I can't
[02:11:12] hold on to all of it myself on the boat
[02:11:14] here. So, we got to get we get get rid
[02:11:15] of some of them. And I figure you guys
[02:11:17] will like them cuz you can play and do
[02:11:19] some stuff with them. Going to give
[02:11:21] everybody one for their spot today from
[02:11:25] all the ones we've been opening. That's
[02:11:26] kind of what we'll be end up doing
[02:11:28] here. There you go. Infinity coming in
[02:11:31] towards
[02:11:32] you. Perfecto for
[02:11:36] everybody. All right. Now we're going to
[02:11:39] have to decide what we're
[02:11:44] doing. All right.
[02:11:50] Yeah, we can. You know what? Here, I'll
[02:11:53] throw another one in for Miss Nico.
[02:11:54] Another two. How's that? Throw a couple
[02:11:56] more in for Miss
[02:11:57] Nico since she was the one that was
[02:11:59] gifting all of you
[02:12:02] today. She gifted you all today. We'll
[02:12:04] throw an extra in. I think that'll fit
[02:12:07] all of them. There we
[02:12:09] go. Not a problem. Not a problem. Hey,
[02:12:12] like I said, I I can't I can't do
[02:12:13] anything with all my bulk. I What am I
[02:12:15] going to do with it all? I can't have it
[02:12:16] all in the boat. I got to get away with
[02:12:17] it some get rid of it somehow. And you
[02:12:18] guys have me hanging out. So, there you
[02:12:22] go. I can use some of it, but not all of
[02:12:24] it is really what it boils down to. All
[02:12:26] right. So, you're in the one arm with
[02:12:27] vendor. You want a negity? Well, he
[02:12:29] goes, "You know what? I got a negity
[02:12:30] booster. I also have an intelligence
[02:12:32] booster. I have strength boosters. I
[02:12:35] have engineering boosters. I have luck
[02:12:37] boosters. I have criticals. I have
[02:12:40] plasma ammo. I have flamethrower ammo. I
[02:12:44] have a key to Kronos. I have an alien
[02:12:47] gatling gun. And I also have the alien
[02:12:50] gatling gun. I have some Gatling gun
[02:12:52] ammo. And I have alien gatling gun ammo,
[02:12:55] too. So, uh, you guys may have come to
[02:12:57] the right place. I also have some, uh,
[02:13:00] sniper rifle ammo for any of you that
[02:13:02] need it.
[02:13:04] Uh we we we're we're here and we we're
[02:13:06] we're pretty stocked up
[02:13:07] here. Well, that's why he got one arm
[02:13:10] Willie here. He's got he's a he's got
[02:13:11] one arm for a reason. He probably goes
[02:13:13] around stealing things or maybe uh maybe
[02:13:15] he did at some point. Now everybody
[02:13:16] knows who he is and they don't want to
[02:13:17] mess with him because he got one arm and
[02:13:18] he he got one arm. He you know who knows
[02:13:21] how he got that one arm. I don't
[02:13:23] know how much for the Gatlin Gatling
[02:13:26] ammo for the Gatling gun. Gatling gun.
[02:13:30] If you want a gatling gun, it will be 25
[02:13:34] Pogs. 25
[02:13:37] Pogs. 15 Pogs for a critical and
[02:13:40] agility. We can do that. One arm looks
[02:13:42] at you guys. Goes, I think I can do
[02:13:44] that. 15 for those.
[02:13:51] Yeah, it came out funny. It was Is this
[02:13:53] the one that came out like the wrong
[02:13:54] word? And I It was like a good one. How
[02:13:57] much is it for the ammo? All right. So
[02:13:59] for every time for 15 rounds of ammo or
[02:14:01] wait no 18 rounds of ammo which gives
[02:14:04] you only three shots cuz it shoots six
[02:14:07] at a time. 18 rounds of ammo it is one
[02:14:10] pog per shot. So there you go 18
[02:14:16] pogs but it comes with already
[02:14:20] um it comes with 30 rounds. So you get
[02:14:24] five when you buy it right away.
[02:14:28] So that's what it comes
[02:14:35] with. You going to give Miss Nico five
[02:14:38] Pogs. Nice. Engineering buff and a
[02:14:41] critical would be
[02:14:43] 25 for the engineering buff and the
[02:14:45] critical. One armed vendor staring at
[02:14:47] you all. Go, I think I can do that. I
[02:14:50] think I can do that.
[02:14:57] and extra round of ammo. I like
[02:15:00] it. Yes. Sword is buffed by strength and
[02:15:03] intelligence. There you go. Good job.
[02:15:06] All right. So, you're gonna get yourself
[02:15:07] a gatling gun. So, Miss Nico is going to
[02:15:10] take the gatling
[02:15:12] gun. Going to drop down a little bit
[02:15:15] there for the Pogs there. But you have
[02:15:18] enough, I do believe, because your
[02:15:19] friend gave you
[02:15:21] 35. So, you're going to go down to
[02:15:28] 25 plus as much ammo as you can get
[02:15:31] would
[02:15:34] be what do you got there? Get another
[02:15:37] extra shot. So you got to make 26 20.
[02:15:40] Yeah, there you go. You'll be end up
[02:15:42] being a you would end up having six
[02:15:44] shots with the extra money that you have
[02:15:45] there cuz each one's a one and you only
[02:15:48] have uh Well, yeah, there we go. We'll
[02:15:50] get you that that there'll be 36 you'll
[02:15:53] come with if you go with the
[02:15:55] uh Oh,
[02:16:03] Nico.
[02:16:05] Ah, no. No special pistol ammo here. But
[02:16:08] I do know there was a guy on uh on the
[02:16:11] surface in one of the locations that I
[02:16:12] used to have go and hunting around
[02:16:14] before I lost my arm that had a lot of
[02:16:17] uh a lot of weird ammo.
[02:16:20] didn't always work, but when it did, oh
[02:16:22] my
[02:16:23] god, it
[02:16:25] just it changed the tide of a match. You
[02:16:28] could have an encounter over with one
[02:16:29] shot sometimes,
[02:16:31] but there's a little bit of a luck roll
[02:16:33] with those
[02:16:38] ones. So, it looks like she got five
[02:16:40] there. Bring up to
[02:16:42] 36. So, there you go. We'll get you some
[02:16:47] uh extra
[02:16:52] shots there. Get the 15 16. I think
[02:16:57] that'll get you extra all the way up
[02:16:58] there. I think you're going to go down
[02:16:59] to uh you'll have no Pogs, but you'll
[02:17:02] have a bunch of ammo and a Gatling
[02:17:05] gun. I think that's a good one. Now,
[02:17:08] what else are we
[02:17:10] doing? All right, so zero on the Pogs
[02:17:12] because of what was given. We're going
[02:17:14] to take five away from Luke.
[02:17:18] So Luke, you're going to go down
[02:17:21] to
[02:17:25] 37. Then Nico City is going to give
[02:17:28] some. So you're going to go down to
[02:17:31] 56. And then yours are going to
[02:17:34] disappear. And you go to 30
[02:17:37] plus 18 48 rounds with the Gatling, Miss
[02:17:41] Nico.
[02:17:51] Let's do
[02:17:55] this with 46
[02:18:01] rounds. Gat with 46 rounds. There you
[02:18:05] go. How much for a sword? Ooh, you want
[02:18:08] a What were you looking for? The pirate
[02:18:10] sword. Is that what you're looking for?
[02:18:12] Oh, no. Not that pirate sword.
[02:18:14] the pyro sword
[02:18:16] here. Those are going to be 20 Pogs
[02:18:23] each. Take six sniper ammo. That will be
[02:18:26] for the sniper ammo. It is 12 Pogs, two
[02:18:28] Pogs each for each ammo. So, you're
[02:18:30] going to go down to um
[02:18:33] 40
[02:18:35] 34. Go down to
[02:18:37] 34 and you're going to get some sniper
[02:18:40] ammo.
[02:18:41] Nico, I'm going to go up six to
[02:18:45] 19. There we
[02:18:52] go. All right. There we go. All right.
[02:18:54] There we go. Four more. You go down to
[02:18:57] 30. And Miss Nico's at a
[02:19:03] straight
[02:19:06] 50. There you go.
[02:19:13] Do you want the sword?
[02:19:17] Ah, trade the normal sword and 12 pogs.
[02:19:19] I like
[02:19:20] it. All right. So, that is uh Luke. All
[02:19:26] right. You trade the normal sword, Luke.
[02:19:29] And 12 Pogs. There you go. I like it.
[02:19:31] We're going to go bring that down to
[02:19:34] 525 for your Pogs. Then Luke now
[02:19:40] has
[02:19:42] [Music]
[02:19:45] wait I don't know if you have a sword
[02:19:47] Luke right now you have a Gatling gun a
[02:19:50] pistol two ARs and a plasma rifle. Do
[02:19:52] you want to trade trade one of the ARs?
[02:20:09] So, I don't think you have a sword right
[02:20:10] now. Looks like you I wonder if you gave
[02:20:11] it over to somebody at some
[02:20:15] point. That might have been why you
[02:20:17] don't have it at the
[02:20:25] moment. What
[02:20:28] happened? Where'd it go?
[02:20:31] Well, you did use it yesterday. Where'd
[02:20:34] it
[02:20:37] go?
[02:20:39] Huh? We'll trade it for that sword.
[02:20:42] We'll say the sword's gone and we're
[02:20:43] going to give you the pirate one. I
[02:20:44] don't know what happened. That's weird.
[02:20:46] I do remember you using it yesterday,
[02:20:54] too. Py
[02:20:57] sword. There you go.
[02:21:02] I know what happened with that one.
[02:21:03] There you go. That's weird. I do
[02:21:05] remember that,
[02:21:08] too. No, I'm like sitting there like,
[02:21:11] "No, I do remember him using it." That's
[02:21:14] weird. All right. So, there you go. You
[02:21:16] got that. Anything else anybody wants
[02:21:18] here before you guys head out of the
[02:21:22] onearm vendor? One arm vendor is hanging
[02:21:24] out. Hey guys. All right. I'm getting
[02:21:26] ready to close shop up. I'm getting
[02:21:27] tired here.
[02:21:31] [Music]
[02:21:35] critical and engineering
[02:21:37] for what 15. It
[02:21:43] was 20. I mean 20 for the critical and
[02:21:46] 20 for the engineering. I mean 10 20
[02:21:48] total
[02:21:55] spicy. All right.
[02:21:58] So take 20 away from spicy would be um
[02:22:04] 32 get an
[02:22:06] engineering to
[02:22:09] three and you're going to have a crit
[02:22:13] critical did you add your I'm going to
[02:22:15] add another critical in for you to be
[02:22:17] three criticals
[02:22:23] and an engineering also bring you up to
[02:22:28] four. All
[02:22:31] right, here we
[02:22:33] go. I think we're ready to go then. What
[02:22:36] about you, my friend EMT? Did you want
[02:22:38] to do anything before we headed out
[02:22:41] [Music]
[02:22:42] here? You're very welcome. You have to
[02:22:45] see what happens. We have our We have uh
[02:22:48] somebody now has a gatling gun, a new
[02:22:49] one. You a new pirate sword out and
[02:22:51] about hanging with
[02:22:54] us. your engineering, Nico.
[02:22:58] Spicy, you're at three on the
[02:23:00] engineering. Same thing. And Spicy's at
[02:23:03] four on the
[02:23:04] engineering. You have five agility,
[02:23:07] though, my
[02:23:09] friend. All right, here we go. We're
[02:23:11] heading
[02:23:12] out. I like it. Boom. Time to go. All
[02:23:18] right, you guys go wandering down a
[02:23:20] hallway and you're deciding where do you
[02:23:24] want to go. All right, so remember you
[02:23:27] have the
[02:23:30] um you have the pirate book that you
[02:23:33] found from your
[02:23:35] man. All
[02:23:37] right. Now, from your from your pirate
[02:23:39] guy, from your pirate pirate captain,
[02:23:42] were we going to the no room or are we
[02:23:44] going to go to one of the other rooms?
[02:23:45] Where are we going today? We can go back
[02:23:47] to the crab room where sometimes you get
[02:23:49] treasure. The room that says
[02:23:52] no. The no
[02:23:56] room. All
[02:23:57] right. Well,
[02:23:59] then I guess we're going to the no
[02:24:02] room. All right. Well, the no room it
[02:24:05] is. You go
[02:24:07] wandering through the
[02:24:11] hallways. Say goodbye to that one arm
[02:24:13] bender. You wander through some of the
[02:24:15] hallways
[02:24:24] there. Where is that guy arm? Storage
[02:24:27] vendor is not on. And as you're
[02:24:29] wandering through the hallways
[02:24:32] there, that's what I was supposed to put
[02:24:36] on. You find
[02:24:44] a
[02:25:02] room. Then we're going to do
[02:25:05] this. And you see these things show up.
[02:25:08] You open their room, you see a computer
[02:25:11] in the background, but there are a few
[02:25:14] pirates of all kinds protecting them.
[02:25:18] Now, there's some um pirates that
[02:25:21] are ghouls, some that are human, and
[02:25:26] some that are
[02:25:32] um mutants.
[02:25:35] So, you have to
[02:25:38] decide. Do you guys want to attack?
[02:25:41] Continue and try to see what's going on
[02:25:43] there and attack, or would you like to
[02:25:44] uh turn and run
[02:25:47] away? Oh, we can try to make a bomb
[02:25:49] again, I guess. Yeah. If you guys want
[02:25:51] to try to make a bomb
[02:25:53] again. All right. So, yesterday you guys
[02:25:56] made a bomb out of a canister. They took
[02:25:59] one of your canisters, spicy, so that's
[02:26:00] why you're a little low. So, you have a
[02:26:02] canister and you throw out a bomb in
[02:26:04] there to blow up. You used your
[02:26:07] flamethrower ammo, one of the cans of
[02:26:09] flame flamethrower ammo, which is why
[02:26:11] you dropped a bit. And you use your a
[02:26:13] couple plasma rounds. So, we're going to
[02:26:15] try it again here. All
[02:26:17] right. Now, we have the engineering,
[02:26:20] which is uh our buddy here. Nico's got
[02:26:23] plus4 on
[02:26:25] engineering, plus three on intelligence.
[02:26:28] All right. That gives him a plus a
[02:26:30] seven. Oo, and a luck for plus two,
[02:26:33] which brings you up to plus nine,
[02:26:36] actually. Oh, that means you, this is a
[02:26:38] 50/50. So, that means you need to, if
[02:26:40] you don't get one, you're going to be
[02:26:42] okay. That's pretty much what that
[02:26:43] means, Nico. You need to not get a one
[02:26:46] and then you're going to be okay. All
[02:26:48] right, which dice are we going to use,
[02:26:49] my friend? We have a bunch of them as
[02:26:50] options.
[02:26:52] [Music]
[02:27:02] We have the dice, the different ones
[02:27:03] there that we had before, the all the
[02:27:06] different ones, or we can go with the
[02:27:07] purple one that Luke has, or we can go
[02:27:09] with one of the different ones that we
[02:27:10] have, or the uh stone one. The purple
[02:27:12] one. Purple it is. All right, here we
[02:27:15] go. Going to move this over. We're going
[02:27:19] to manage this. Say it's finished, cuz I
[02:27:22] did finish it. And there we go. We're
[02:27:24] going to roll
[02:27:26] now. Oh, there you go. It's a
[02:27:29] six. So, you're lucky. You put that bomb
[02:27:32] together, you toss it
[02:27:34] in that hole around the corner where the
[02:27:37] pirates
[02:27:39] are,
[02:27:40] and five of
[02:27:43] them are turned to
[02:27:46] dust. Five of them are turned to dust.
[02:27:51] Now there are only left with four. One
[02:27:55] is at 100 health. He is a normal
[02:27:58] human. There is a mutant that you burned
[02:28:02] is at 50
[02:28:04] health. There is a ghoul at 65 health.
[02:28:08] And there's a human only at 20 health
[02:28:11] cuz he got the brunt of it right behind
[02:28:12] a couple friends and almost
[02:28:15] died. So you got lucky again.
[02:28:20] Pirate sword with 100 health. Nice one
[02:28:22] there. So, you're going in with a pirate
[02:28:24] sword with 100 health and you go and you
[02:28:28] get five. All right. Five. Yeah. Luke
[02:28:33] has a
[02:28:36] plus six plus two agility. The agility
[02:28:41] works. So that's eight plus 10 on your
[02:28:46] agility with H. You need we need 17 or
[02:28:50] more to hit these guys. You got
[02:28:59] 15. You missed him a little
[02:29:03] bit. I'm sorry. It was a five. You
[02:29:06] needed a little bit more.
[02:29:10] Ah, so close. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
[02:29:13] Wait. How much do you have for strength?
[02:29:14] Do you have strength in
[02:29:15] there? Ooh, you do have strength. I
[02:29:18] lied. That's a five added. You hit
[02:29:20] because you have five strength added on.
[02:29:22] I'm looking at I feel like I was wrong
[02:29:23] there. I've been missing something. You
[02:29:25] had strength. Then you hit him. You hit
[02:29:27] one of them with a
[02:29:29] sword. The 100
[02:29:32] healther that goes
[02:29:35] to Let's do this on this side.
[02:29:40] All right. Oh, there you go. 13. Bring
[02:29:44] him down to 87. Not bad on that
[02:29:47] hit. What are you going to do next? You
[02:29:50] said, um, nice. There we go. Pirate
[02:29:53] sword, critical flame, um, thrower, and
[02:29:56] blast the big guy. All right, you got
[02:29:59] four added on to your
[02:30:02] flamethrower, which we'll throw on here
[02:30:05] on the big
[02:30:06] guy. That brings you flamethrower. You
[02:30:09] shoot your
[02:30:11] flamethrower. You hit that large
[02:30:16] pirate. Bringing it down. Now with the
[02:30:18] flamethrower, you get a nice hit on that
[02:30:20] one. Bring it down to look at that. 69
[02:30:23] health.
[02:30:27] Uh-oh. Oh my. Oh
[02:30:31] my. Small one. Plasma on the small
[02:30:34] one. Oh, 17. Plasma on the small one.
[02:30:40] I know you didn't get a big You didn't
[02:30:42] get a big hit. It was a safety net. But
[02:30:43] hey, you got an extra. Wait, no. I I
[02:30:45] lied. You get plus four on top of that.
[02:30:48] So, it goes down. Um, not 69. It's at
[02:30:52] 65. So, I forgot the plus four, but you
[02:30:55] hit with a
[02:30:58] plasma. Nice one on the small
[02:31:02] one. Good job there. And that brings the
[02:31:05] small one
[02:31:10] down to eight health. You plasma that
[02:31:13] guy. You plasma them. And that small one
[02:31:17] that was hanging around by the computer
[02:31:18] there, that was almost dead. Get a nice
[02:31:21] nice burn mark on
[02:31:23] them. So now I think we're on what is
[02:31:26] it? Nico. Ah, snipe with a with a
[02:31:30] critical on on the mutant. I like
[02:31:33] it. 14. And you hit them. That means you
[02:31:36] hit them because you needed you needed
[02:31:37] like a 10 or higher with what you have
[02:31:38] for boosters. Now you got 50 for that
[02:31:40] one. So you hit
[02:31:43] them. And that one
[02:31:45] is Ooh, nice one with the sniper rifle.
[02:31:50] Brings them down to 29
[02:31:52] health. Nice job on
[02:31:55] that. All right, so we're on to EMT.
[02:31:59] Click
[02:32:01] click.
[02:32:02] Boom. with your sniper
[02:32:11] rifle. There we go. What are we doing
[02:32:14] now, my
[02:32:15] friends? How much further are we
[02:32:20] going? I think we have EMT, right? It's
[02:32:23] on to you, my
[02:32:29] friend. We have a little one with eight
[02:32:32] health. little one with eight health.
[02:32:35] You have a mutant with 29 health. I
[02:32:37] think you got a uh and a
[02:32:40] human with uh that was knocked down to
[02:32:43] 47 health. No. Yep. Uh 65 health. I
[02:32:48] mean sword the lowest
[02:32:52] one. See what he
[02:32:54] says. All right. We're going to do a
[02:32:56] sword on the lowest
[02:32:58] one. All right. Plus five.
[02:33:03] We missed. Dang it. Gets He
[02:33:08] misses. That brings him down. Gets the
[02:33:11] lowest one. Swings back with a sword and
[02:33:14] brings him down to 89 health. Not a
[02:33:16] giant hit, but not a small
[02:33:18] hit.
[02:33:19] Now, oh, you guys get lucky. The pirates
[02:33:23] have been injured so poorly, badly that
[02:33:26] they have now wildly shot like they were
[02:33:29] storm troopers and they missed.
[02:33:32] You going to try the gat? Who are you
[02:33:33] going after with the gat? My friend,
[02:33:35] Miss Nico, you got lucky. All the
[02:33:36] pirates
[02:33:41] missed. Big
[02:33:44] gun. There you go. 15. It was
[02:33:47] there. 15 plus yours. So, you got your
[02:33:50] shots off. Let's see what happens.
[02:34:07] brings it down to 47
[02:34:10] health from 65 health. Nice shot, my
[02:34:14] friend. Good one with a gat there. Get a
[02:34:17] few shots
[02:34:19] off and that gat takes him out. Brings
[02:34:22] him down to 47 health.
[02:34:27] You going to go dual pistols after the
[02:34:28] mutant. I like it. Good idea. Dual
[02:34:31] pistols coming
[02:34:33] out. And let's
[02:34:35] see. Oh, dual pistols. You got plus
[02:34:42] four. Then you got your agility with
[02:34:44] plus five. Oh, you got him. Look at You
[02:34:47] got him. You barely got him with 18
[02:34:49] because you had the extra. Nice. Nice.
[02:34:53] You barely got him with the extra
[02:34:54] because you have nine with your agility
[02:34:56] that you added in. Now you're at five
[02:34:58] agility. Still a hit. I know. You go in
[02:35:01] with your pistols. You still hit them.
[02:35:03] And that one was on
[02:35:05] uh the pistols on the moon. Dual. All
[02:35:08] right. Let's see. I like dual pistols.
[02:35:12] All right. That is going to
[02:35:18] [Music]
[02:35:20] be Oh, that brings him down to 11. I
[02:35:24] forgot we were rolling the dice before.
[02:35:26] We'll do that after the next one. I
[02:35:27] forgot to roll the dice. My
[02:35:30] bad. I have the dice here to be rolling.
[02:35:32] I kept forgotting forgetting about
[02:35:34] those. The buffs definitely coming in
[02:35:36] clutch right now. Definitely coming in
[02:35:39] clutch. So, who's up now?
[02:35:46] I kept forgetting about the dice. I I'm
[02:35:47] so used to doing it the other way with
[02:35:48] the computer and having it automatically
[02:35:50] do it for me with the uh I had a program
[02:35:52] I built. So, here we go. Who is up next?
[02:35:55] Nico snipes the ghoul with a critical.
[02:35:58] Oh, I like it. All right. So, we're
[02:35:59] going to see the
[02:36:00] extra. Oh, you get a 15 plus on there.
[02:36:04] All right. And you have four of the dice
[02:36:07] that we roll.
[02:36:09] That gets
[02:36:12] you. We have 10 13 +
[02:36:17] 15 on what was that on the ghoul. Nice
[02:36:22] one. That's a
[02:36:35] 65. Bring him down to 37 health. Nice
[02:36:39] hit with that one on the
[02:36:43] ghoul. Crit the big guy with the most
[02:36:46] health. There you go. I like it.
[02:36:48] Critical on the big guy with the most
[02:36:50] health. Now, what are you gat? All
[02:36:52] right,
[02:36:53] gat. All right, so you got six on and
[02:36:57] adding on to them. All right, add it on.
[02:36:59] Your gat gets you four dice to roll
[02:37:01] with. Let's see what we got here.
[02:37:04] We have
[02:37:05] oh
[02:37:07] four
[02:37:09] 10
[02:37:10] 11 plus your uh six which is
[02:37:15] 17 on the guy with the most health would
[02:37:18] be that the guy there. So that's going
[02:37:20] to knock him down to minus
[02:37:24] 17 brings him down to 48
[02:37:27] health for the largest one. So EMT, what
[02:37:31] are we going to do there?
[02:37:32] EMT. That's a
[02:37:34] nine. What are you talking
[02:37:38] about? Oh [ __ ] that's a
[02:37:42] nine. That is a nine. My
[02:37:45] bad. 20 minus
[02:37:51] 20 because you had
[02:37:56] 11. Bring it down to 20.
[02:38:00] No, no, no,
[02:38:08] no. My math didn't not see. Uh, there we
[02:38:11] go. Bring it on to
[02:38:15] 45. Thank you. Thank you. I didn't even
[02:38:17] notice that. I appreciate that. 45. Good
[02:38:20] eyes on
[02:38:22] that. Miss Nico is going to go after the
[02:38:24] big guy again. All right. Well, hold on.
[02:38:26] We got to see if uh EMT What's EMT going
[02:38:29] to do?
[02:38:30] EMT, if you're still in here. If not,
[02:38:33] we'll roll for you and we're going to
[02:38:34] go. We'll try sword, the big guy
[02:38:39] again. All right. Oh, we got a
[02:38:42] 10. EMT. Oh, the sword plus one. You
[02:38:46] missed. It's only six extra. You need a
[02:38:49] 17. EMT gets hit by the big guy. The big
[02:38:53] guy swings his sword at you, hitting
[02:38:56] you, bringing you down
[02:38:58] to 85 health. Luckily, it wasn't a big
[02:39:01] hit cuz he's been injured a
[02:39:04] bit. But now they check to see what they
[02:39:08] are going to do. Oh, you guys got lucky
[02:39:11] again. A nine. They missed. They
[02:39:16] missed. Look at that. The pirates missed
[02:39:18] again.
[02:39:21] Oh, you guys are so lucky. So, we're
[02:39:23] going to go with the gat on the big guy.
[02:39:26] Oh, no. Miss
[02:39:30] Nico, you
[02:39:32] whiffed when you
[02:39:34] shoot. You whiffed so
[02:39:37] bad that the big guy shoots back and
[02:39:40] hits you because his aim was actually
[02:39:43] picked up a little bit better and he
[02:39:44] knocked you down to 88 health. Miss
[02:39:49] Nico, you are so wildly
[02:39:52] shooting. All right, here we go. Who's
[02:39:54] up next? We got to figure out. You
[02:39:56] whiffed so bad. That gatling gun just
[02:39:58] went all over the
[02:40:00] place. It has been good, but And I guess
[02:40:03] not right that
[02:40:09] time. So, we have to see what's next.
[02:40:12] What are you doing?
[02:40:15] Nico's gonna snipe the
[02:40:17] ghoul. Five. Oh, five. Nico, do you have
[02:40:21] enough? Sniper is a plus
[02:40:27] six. Sniper is a plus six. You
[02:40:31] have
[02:40:33] engineering and
[02:40:35] intelligence, which works with a
[02:40:38] sniper, which gives you plus
[02:40:41] seven. So, actually, you hit because
[02:40:43] that's 15.
[02:40:45] That's over a 17, I
[02:40:48] mean. Well, there you go. You still get
[02:40:52] a hit because you got your extras. You
[02:40:53] barely got it, though, dude. You You
[02:40:54] barely got the hit. You like missed it.
[02:40:56] You got it by like that much, dude. I
[02:40:57] think you have like 18 or 19. All right,

[02:41:15] You said wait you were going after the
[02:41:20] ghoul. Yes, you went after the ghoul. So
[02:41:23] the ghoul now is
[02:41:29] downed to 19
[02:41:34] health. Luke's going to plasma the
[02:41:37] lowest one. Oh, dual pistol to big muan.
[02:41:39] All right, dual
[02:41:41] pistol. Oh, you got it. 19. So you get
[02:41:44] with the dual
[02:41:47] pistols. You've got
[02:41:50] six. Seven. I mean six. You got on that
[02:41:54] for that guy. Let me
[02:41:57] see. Where is uh dual pis the big mutant
[02:42:01] again. Brings it down
[02:42:05] six. There you go my
[02:42:09] friend. Then we have Luke's going to
[02:42:11] plasma.
[02:42:14] Oh, the plasma works. Nice. Let's see
[02:42:17] what happens there,
[02:42:19] Luke. We have
[02:42:23] 58. And you hit on barely a hit. Plasma
[02:42:26] on the lowest with eight. And
[02:42:28] you The lowest one's dead. It had eight
[02:42:31] health. It's now dead. You killed that
[02:42:34] lowest one off. And EMT is going to go
[02:42:36] now cuz EMT is going to go with the
[02:42:38] sword. Oh, wait. Sword. And EMT. Oh,
[02:42:41] does EMT hit? Cuz he got 11. EMT hits
[02:42:44] with a
[02:42:45] sword. We have six eight from EMT going
[02:42:50] after. We're going to have him go after
[02:42:52] um the ghoul here. All
[02:42:59] right. Brings the ghoul down to 21
[02:43:01] health.
[02:43:03] Nice
[02:43:06] [Music]
[02:43:09] job. Hits a hit. All right, here we go.
[02:43:12] Now, let's see what they do. The pirates
[02:43:16] try to catch you and oh my everybody,
[02:43:18] they do. The leftover pirates shoot and
[02:43:21] they hit all of you. They got their
[02:43:23] weapons and they're wildly
[02:43:27] swinging and they shooting and they get
[02:43:30] you guys with some good hits.
[02:43:33] Nico goes from 100 health down to 87
[02:43:37] health. Spicy goes from 100 health down
[02:43:41] to 85
[02:43:43] health. Luke goes from 100 health down
[02:43:46] to 88 health. Miss Nico goes from 88
[02:43:50] health down to 73 health. And I believe
[02:43:54] that is
[02:43:56] it. You going to use your health pack?
[02:43:59] They rallied. They did. And the boot
[02:44:01] drop. Flame
[02:44:02] on. Flame on. You get Oh, buddy. That's
[02:44:06] not gonna help you, I don't think,
[02:44:08] there, dude. Cuz you do not have
[02:44:11] 15. Oh, no. You
[02:44:14] miss and they hit you. Somehow comes
[02:44:18] bouncing back and hits you. And you go
[02:44:21] from 85 down to
[02:44:26] 73. You have to get rid of the
[02:44:28] flamethrower.
[02:44:30] Who's up next? You Luke uses his 20
[02:44:32] health pack. All right. Luke, Luke uses
[02:44:35] a 20. Going back up to 100
[02:44:45] health. AR on the big
[02:44:48] guy. You have eight with your AR plus
[02:44:52] three is 15. I mean uh 11. Then the AR
[02:44:56] you get
[02:45:01] with intelligence ads. So that's three.
[02:45:04] Ah, it's not enough. It's not enough.
[02:45:07] You
[02:45:08] miss. You missed. I'm sorry. They get
[02:45:12] back at you though. They do not like
[02:45:14] getting hit. Miss, Nico, they come back
[02:45:17] at you and hit you. Bring you down to 65
[02:45:21] health. Luke goes after and swords the
[02:45:24] big guy. Nice, Luke. You hit him.
[02:45:28] 18. That one rolls. And you have a
[02:45:31] special cuz you have the sword, the
[02:45:32] pirate sword. So, let's
[02:45:37] see. Oh,
[02:45:41] 12. 15
[02:45:45] 20.
[02:45:49] Dude, nice one.
[02:45:52] Yeah, Luke, you said you were going
[02:45:54] after the big guy,
[02:45:56] right? Nice
[02:46:01] one. Goes from
[02:46:05] 45 down to 25. Nice hit on that one
[02:46:11] there. All right, who's up next? Ah,
[02:46:14] your aim's off a little bit. I know.
[02:46:15] Hey, it happens sometimes. Can't always
[02:46:17] have the greatest aim. Somebody might
[02:46:19] try. We can't
[02:46:21] always. All right, I think we have EMT
[02:46:24] is going to go for a shot with the big
[02:46:26] guy. Oh, he hits him. Look at that. EMT
[02:46:29] goes after the big guy and hits it with
[02:46:30] a
[02:46:31] sword and EMT gets a big hit. Oh my
[02:46:36] god, look at
[02:46:38] that. 9 +
[02:46:42] 6. Whoa. EMTT coming in with a big hit.
[02:46:47] Knocking them down 15.
[02:46:50] The big guys only got 10
[02:46:53] left. Purple dice for the win. Who's
[02:46:55] going up
[02:46:56] next? I think there's Oh, all right. I
[02:46:59] think everybody's done. So, it's now on
[02:47:00] to the pirates. Oh, you guys got lucky
[02:47:02] again. The pirates missed. The pirates
[02:47:04] are so injured. They don't know what's
[02:47:05] going on. One of them's falling to the
[02:47:07] ground. Almost dead. And they miss. They
[02:47:11] miss. What are we going to
[02:47:14] do? Sniper the ghoul. You take your
[02:47:17] sniper out. You try to hit the ghoul.
[02:47:20] You get a six there. Now with your
[02:47:23] sniper, you have hold on
[02:47:26] here. Your sniper, you get engineering
[02:47:29] and intelligence is
[02:47:31] three with the sniper. So that's seven
[02:47:34] plus six. You hit you hit. You pretty
[02:47:36] much you hit. You're almost guaranteed
[02:47:38] to hit unless you get like two, I think.
[02:47:40] So nice job on that. Still a beer.
[02:47:42] Barely a hit. Barely a hit, but it
[02:47:44] works. Your sniper goes on that
[02:47:50] one. Got four. Oh my god, everybody.
[02:47:54] Look at these hits. You're coming into
[02:47:55] the end
[02:47:56] here. Look at that. That was a That was
[02:47:59] a 12. That's 12 plus seven. Look at
[02:48:04] that. 19. You said you going after the
[02:48:06] big guy cuz the big guy is now dead.
[02:48:12] The big guy is now dead. There's nothing
[02:48:15] left from that big guy. You hit him, he
[02:48:19] dropped the ground. Now you're only left
[02:48:22] with a couple of them there. They're
[02:48:23] like, "Oh god, I don't know what's going
[02:48:24] on." Two of them are turning around to
[02:48:26] run. The two that are left, you got 13.
[02:48:29] I mean 21 and 37 on their
[02:48:37] health. You have the same ones. That's
[02:48:40] cool. Dual pistols on the bigger one.
[02:48:42] All right, here we go. You got six
[02:48:45] plus what do you
[02:48:49] got? 6 + 4 with your agility is
[02:48:55] nine. Yeah, you missed it. You missed it
[02:48:59] a little
[02:49:01] bit. You missed it a little bit. I'm
[02:49:03] sorry, buddy. You just missed by
[02:49:06] one. And plasma on the bigger guy, Luke
[02:49:09] says.
[02:49:10] You got a nine plus what you have. I
[02:49:14] believe you have an intelligence
[02:49:16] Luke. You do have
[02:49:20] engineering which adds to it. So that's
[02:49:23] five six. Oh
[02:49:26] Luke. You miss
[02:49:28] also. And they shoot back and they hit
[02:49:31] both of you. Luke, you go down to
[02:49:35] 90 one
[02:49:37] health and Spicy gets knocked down to
[02:49:40] 62
[02:49:44] health. And then EMT
[02:49:46] goes EMT gets a 10 while I rolled that
[02:49:49] away. That's 10. But they miss it again
[02:49:52] because he hits he needs a 11 or
[02:49:55] bigger. And you got the big
[02:49:57] guy. Oh my god, everybody. You missed
[02:50:00] it. It's a three. Now watch going to see
[02:50:02] what happened with them. Oh, you guys
[02:50:04] get so lucky. They missed
[02:50:07] you again. The pirates. There's two of
[02:50:10] them left. They're scared, though. They
[02:50:11] see all of you there. So, they start to
[02:50:12] turn around and run. That's why they
[02:50:14] missed. You got one last chance to get
[02:50:16] those last two pirates before they
[02:50:17] disappear. All right. What are you guys
[02:50:19] going to do before we try and get them?
[02:50:21] Last chance. What are you going to
[02:50:26] do? Sniper, the big
[02:50:29] one. You have two
[02:50:32] Two plus I think that's the low. Oh my
[02:50:34] god. I don't think you get them. Nico,
[02:50:37] hold on. You got six
[02:50:43] plus 6
[02:50:49] plus
[02:50:51] 7. So that's uh 13 + 2. You missed it.
[02:50:57] You missed them.
[02:51:00] You missed
[02:51:02] him. Myth. And you go dual pistols. Oh,
[02:51:06] the dual pistols hit. There we
[02:51:08] go. And you get Oh, look at that. It's a
[02:51:13] nine. And you go after We're going to go
[02:51:16] after the one that's there. We'll go
[02:51:18] after that one. The uh that one there.
[02:51:20] And we minus 9. It's at 12 for your
[02:51:24] mutant is at 12. And your ghoul's at
[02:51:30] 37. I think we have our buddy um
[02:51:35] EMT. Oh, look at that. EMT's got 12.
[02:51:37] They did it. EMT comes in and they go
[02:51:40] after the one with the most health and
[02:51:42] they get
[02:51:46] 910. Bring him from
[02:51:49] 37 down to
[02:51:51] 27 for that other guy with a large
[02:51:53] health
[02:51:54] there. What is going on now?
[02:51:58] Who's up next? I think we got everybody.
[02:52:00] Is it uh Luke or Wait, I think we did
[02:52:02] everybody. I think we did
[02:52:03] everybody. I do believe. Right. All
[02:52:06] right. So, it's the pirates
[02:52:08] turn. Did we miss Spicy or Luke? I think
[02:52:11] we did. We didn't. Oh,
[02:52:14] boy. The pirates hit with a
[02:52:17] 10. And all of you go down. Nico, you go
[02:52:20] down to 80
[02:52:22] health. Spicy goes down to 55 health.
[02:52:27] Luke goes down to
[02:52:30] 82
[02:52:31] health. Miss Nico goes down
[02:52:35] to 55
[02:52:38] health. And EMT goes down
[02:52:41] to 68
[02:52:50] health. All right. You use your plus 20.
[02:52:52] All right. Spicy goes back up to
[02:52:56] 75. All right, Spicy, you're at
[02:52:58] 75. What are we going to do now? Those
[02:53:00] those they hit those they hit you guys.
[02:53:02] You're you got a little bit of an injury
[02:53:05] there. So, we're seeing what's going on
[02:53:08] now.
[02:53:22] [Applause]
[02:53:29] Heck is going on
[02:53:31] there? Sword. The small
[02:53:34] one. One last
[02:53:37] sniper. Oh, you get it cuz you got a 10
[02:53:40] there. All right. Sniper on the biggest
[02:53:43] one. And Whoa. That is 10
[02:53:48] 16 on the big one. Bringing him
[02:53:53] down to from 27
[02:54:00] health down to one
[02:54:06] health. I think that is
[02:54:08] right. Nope. Down to 11 health. There we
[02:54:12] go. Small sword. Nice one there. The
[02:54:16] small sword. You're going out the small
[02:54:17] one with the sword and you hit
[02:54:20] him. There we go. Let's see what you
[02:54:24] get. Oh, wow. That's an
[02:54:28] 12
[02:54:36] 18. And that was on the small one,
[02:54:39] right? You
[02:54:42] said small one is now dead. You are left
[02:54:46] with zero on that
[02:54:48] one then. Yes, sir. Spicy. That was eco.
[02:54:52] All right. Small one's dead. Predicting
[02:54:54] the future. The plasma to the big guy.
[02:54:56] The last
[02:54:58] one. Oh, you missed. You missed and they
[02:55:01] got you. But they turn and they run.
[02:55:04] They turn and they ran. They ran away.
[02:55:06] In the process, they dropped a handful
[02:55:08] of pogs.
[02:55:10] Ah, so the room is now
[02:55:13] empty. The room is now empty. There's no
[02:55:16] one
[02:55:18] there. You killed him. One ran away. You
[02:55:21] don't really know where he went. He kind
[02:55:22] of just disappeared. That seems weird
[02:55:25] that he just disappeared. But you go and
[02:55:27] you
[02:55:28] find 40
[02:55:30] Pogs. Each of you get two of these. So
[02:55:35] that means each of you get 20 Pogs.
[02:55:38] Then you get to split up the 40 pogs
[02:55:40] that were
[02:55:41] found. And then there's not much for
[02:55:44] weapons in here. There's only some
[02:55:47] health. So each of you get a health
[02:55:49] pack. But the
[02:55:53] computer in the background, one of you
[02:55:56] is anybody going to go up to that
[02:55:57] computer and try to uh do something for
[02:56:00] it? Ah, search the computer. I like it.
[02:56:03] So you have of course we're going to
[02:56:07] search the computer. So it is going to
[02:56:10] be you have to hack into it. Now we have
[02:56:13] some people with intelligence and
[02:56:15] engineering. So we have engineering and
[02:56:18] intelligence and luck. So pretty much
[02:56:20] Nico will have to get a one or higher if
[02:56:23] he
[02:56:24] rolls. Do we want to have Nico try to
[02:56:27] hack into it?
[02:56:33] cannot hack it together. Only one person
[02:56:35] can. Or do you want Spicy? Spicy has
[02:56:38] three engineering, one intelligence, and
[02:56:41] one luck. You'll do the hacking. All
[02:56:43] right, here we go. Hopefully, it's not a
[02:56:47] one. Oh, there you go. It's a four. You
[02:56:51] got lucky. It was getting close. almost.
[02:56:56] But you find something and
[02:57:00] then
[02:57:02] weirdly the book in your
[02:57:05] pocket starts to glow.
[02:57:14] And you look into the book and you
[02:57:18] find it now
[02:57:20] has there's a room in the back that
[02:57:23] opened going to Could it be the
[02:57:28] elevator? I don't
[02:57:31] know. That's going to be our next
[02:57:36] adventure to see what happens there.
[02:57:40] Are you happy to see me or does that
[02:57:42] book glow in your
[02:57:47] pocket? All righty.
[02:57:50] So, now what we'll do here, we'll have a
[02:57:53] bit of fun. We're going to head over to
[02:57:55] a friend of
[02:57:57] ours. We're going to go over to You know
[02:58:00] what? We like Hour of Darkness. We're
[02:58:02] going to head over there, hang out with
[02:58:04] them for a little bit. That was a good
[02:58:06] one, guys. Definitely. And thank you all
[02:58:07] for coming and hanging out with us. We
[02:58:09] have everything packed up. Hope you guys
[02:58:10] had a fun one today doing our adventure.
[02:58:12] We'll do uh we'll do I think tomorrow
[02:58:14] we'll do coffee with me and we'll hang
[02:58:15] out back and that type of thing instead
[02:58:16] of uh having a sharing hair. I think
[02:58:18] that'll be a fun one instead. So, we'll
[02:58:20] see you guys tomorrow morning. Thank you
[02:58:21] all. Let's have a good one. We'll see
[02:58:23] you guys tomorrow.

[00:16:30] okay we'll end up hanging out with some
[00:16:32] more people and I what I was saying is
[00:16:34] my fall is coming in a little bit later
[00:16:35] it's supposed to be in this
[00:16:38] yesterday but for whatever reason it did
[00:16:40] not come
[00:16:42] in I also was uh got these in don't know
[00:16:46] if people are interested in
[00:16:50] um secret lair I got some of that in the
[00:16:53] uh the other day I bought some of those
[00:16:55] don't know if you guys were interested
[00:16:56] in
[00:16:57] that
[00:16:59] but right now we're playing a little
[00:17:01] game here if you guys want to jump in I
[00:17:03] was actually just trying to get um some
[00:17:05] other stuff running here trying
[00:17:07] out seeing how it goes I don't know I
[00:17:10] think I'm using up all my points
[00:17:13] here but that means I'm going to have to
[00:17:22] uh get this done and sent
[00:17:27] over
[00:17:44] nice I like
[00:17:53] it that's actually really
[00:17:57] good
[00:19:25] why does it keep changing the audio over
[00:19:27] to nothing and being
[00:19:30] silent did it
[00:19:50] again let's see what happens here on
[00:19:52] this
[00:19:54] one well anyways we're trying to have
[00:19:56] some fun here I'm getting uh I'm trying
[00:19:58] to get my pictures set up for the
[00:20:01] background ready for uh oh that was not
[00:20:03] too bad oh no they did it again didn't
[00:20:14] they how do they do that and make it
[00:20:16] into a
[00:20:27] girl
[00:21:55] [Music]
[00:21:57] can I like remove this as a
[00:22:01] source all right how do I set my audio
[00:22:04] up so it doesn't keep doing
[00:22:07] that because that is a little
[00:22:11] frustrating all right we're going to put
[00:22:12] some of these back we're going to play
[00:22:13] our game again if anybody wants I'll put
[00:22:15] some mystery packs up here that way we
[00:22:18] can uh we'll start out actually with one
[00:22:19] and a half strength here on your
[00:22:20] adventure through the Wasteland
[00:22:25] maybe and remember I'm going to get the
[00:22:28] Fallout stuff in a little while here
[00:22:29] hopefully uh this this morning was
[00:22:32] supposed to get it this uh last night
[00:22:33] but for whatever reason it did not come
[00:22:35] in
[00:22:36] yesterday mail Shipping all that great
[00:22:40] stuff oh no you got rid of
[00:22:43] someone that is not how it's supposed to
[00:22:52] work
[00:22:54] father wearing power armor
[00:23:03] stands next to two
[00:23:08] boys each
[00:23:13] wearing fallout shelter
[00:23:23] clothing the
[00:23:26] wife
[00:23:31] and Marauder gear maybe that'll
[00:23:34] work I'm going to keep close the
[00:23:43] same actually you know what I'm probably
[00:23:45] just have to go and a damn it I just
[00:23:47] wasted all that but afterwards I'll take
[00:23:48] this
[00:23:51] one as long as I get those that way
[00:23:53] that'll
[00:23:55] work I maybe someone wants to come in
[00:23:57] and place games with us have some fun
[00:24:01] today we we try to have some fun at
[00:24:03] least we play uh we play in the morning
[00:24:05] here not always uh sometimes we get
[00:24:07] people in here you know but all right
[00:24:08] here we go let's try
[00:24:10] this that's good that's good we're going
[00:24:14] to use
[00:24:24] this I have to make something a little
[00:24:26] bit different
[00:24:33] almost
[00:24:36] almost all right I do like that one
[00:24:39] let's see if I can um edit in canvas
[00:24:42] that's what I was looking
[00:24:56] for
[00:25:01] all right we're just going to hang out
[00:25:02] here see if you guys uh want to come and
[00:25:04] have some fun with us at some point
[00:25:05] maybe you
[00:25:07] do maybe you don't we'll find
[00:25:10] out either
[00:25:13] way I'll keep doing my thing here this
[00:25:20] morning all right now let's
[00:25:22] do
[00:25:26] draw
[00:25:56] all right let's see if that does
[00:25:57] anything
[00:25:59] there probably going to completely blow
[00:26:01] it
[00:26:08] [Music]
[00:26:10] up well that didn't do anything but
[00:26:12] erased
[00:26:23] it let's
[00:26:26] undo
[00:26:30] if I do that that way no how do I make
[00:26:32] the mask
[00:26:44] smaller I don't know it's actually not
[00:26:48] bad though I could probably tolerate
[00:26:51] that
[00:26:56] one
[00:27:04] I can probably use that one let me it'll
[00:27:06] work
[00:27:12] it let's
[00:27:25] see let's try that
[00:27:36] it's probably going to ruin the rest of
[00:27:38] it though see I need to get rid of just
[00:27:40] I need to be able to like zoom in a
[00:27:41] little bit or shrink down
[00:27:45] the what happened
[00:27:56] there well
[00:27:58] no that's not going to work that's okay
[00:28:01] we're going to use this
[00:28:11] here that's not a bad one we can do
[00:28:26] that
[00:28:28] I wonder if I can do it here
[00:28:32] easier let me try it on
[00:28:38] this may that'll allow me to do it with
[00:28:40] a pencil that'll be
[00:28:48] nice we'll
[00:28:56] see
[00:28:58] all right try
[00:29:11] that
[00:29:13] H let's
[00:29:16] see maybe maybe
[00:29:21] not all right that's kind of working
[00:29:26] there
[00:29:55] all right well that works hey Mystic how

[00:35:01] what so yeah hopefully uh hopefully I
[00:35:03] have some fun with Y all this afternoon
[00:35:05] or this morning here we're just doing
[00:35:06] something a little different uh at least
[00:35:07] here doing something a little different
[00:35:09] we'll say I'm allowed to do some fun
[00:35:11] things having uh having a good time
[00:35:15] here we'll see if you guys think it's uh
[00:35:17] we had some
[00:35:19] fun or you're you think we're having
[00:35:22] some fun well that is why is this not
[00:35:25] working
[00:35:29] this is I definitely downloaded that
[00:35:36] one yeah just uh I don't know what's
[00:35:39] going on with that why did that one not
[00:35:40] download it's I definitely downloaded it
[00:35:43] where do it
[00:35:45] Go default it goes
[00:35:48] there so I did download
[00:35:53] it why am I not seeing it
[00:35:58] I wasn't seeing it now I
[00:36:03] am so what do you uh hopefully you're
[00:36:05] having a
[00:36:10] good week go
[00:36:19] back just wanding on that one because I
[00:36:22] know
[00:36:25] uh
[00:36:28] yeah yeah they were yep so uh I was told
[00:36:32] one thing and then um another thing so I
[00:36:35] was told two different things so like
[00:36:37] it's hard to solve something when you
[00:36:38] solve one and then they tell you
[00:36:39] something different to solve after so
[00:36:43] yeah that was the scenario so now off
[00:36:46] till Saturday nice not too bad not too
[00:36:49] bad having some few days off yeah and
[00:36:51] then now um so now I just came over here
[00:36:53] do my fun stuff and um you know I I now
[00:36:56] ended up end up having uh talk to a
[00:36:58] lawyer now my lucky my job the company I
[00:37:01] work for I get it provided um at a small
[00:37:04] nothing fee for the most part every
[00:37:06] month so um I uh get to I had him I'm G
[00:37:10] to send stuff over to him now from this
[00:37:12] point forward and anything new that I do
[00:37:14] will go through them first they'll check
[00:37:16] uh everything to make sure it's good on
[00:37:17] everything that I'm doing it I'm not
[00:37:18] getting any trouble for gambling or
[00:37:19] anything like that because nothing I'm
[00:37:21] doing is really gambling it's you're
[00:37:22] buying something and then I'm giving you
[00:37:24] something free after just because you
[00:37:26] buy you don't even get to do the free
[00:37:27] thing you can just walk away with the
[00:37:29] other stuff so I don't know my point is
[00:37:32] we uh we try to have fun we try to give
[00:37:34] something literally try to give
[00:37:35] something away for free uh and people
[00:37:38] complain about it so um we have to
[00:37:40] change stuff up and do it a little
[00:37:42] different that's what it
[00:37:44] is that's what it is everywhere and yeah
[00:37:47] it's just one of those weird things you
[00:37:48] can't help it you can't do anything
[00:37:49] about it but um I will just
[00:37:52] uh I now know how to handle it
[00:37:55] differently because of the way people
[00:37:58] are I do now need to just go and handle
[00:38:01] it in a certain manner from now
[00:38:03] on so I'm going to start off with uh
[00:38:06] three strength on your character for
[00:38:07] your adventure in the Wasteland here I
[00:38:09] got mystery packs back
[00:38:19] in there we
[00:38:22] go yeah sometimes uh it's frustrating
[00:38:25] when I I a suspicion of what occurred
[00:38:28] based on
[00:38:34] um certain
[00:38:36] people and how things had
[00:38:40] happened um so that's one of my guess is
[00:38:43] uh there was an in issue uh and there
[00:38:45] was a certain group of people that
[00:38:47] jumped in um that were probably unhappy
[00:38:50] that I was taking people that they
[00:38:52] normally go to their stuff is what I'm
[00:38:54] also guessing so um yeah I don't know
[00:38:58] we'll we'll just leave it alone and I'll
[00:39:01] go about my days and do my best
[00:39:06] right it's all you can do right just be
[00:39:08] do your thing
[00:39:10] correctly that way you don't have to
[00:39:11] worry about it and that's kind of what
[00:39:13] I'm going to try to do
[00:39:17] now most what I did before in the first
[00:39:19] place but now I guess I'll do it a
[00:39:21] little bit more I kind of guess what it
[00:39:25] is
[00:39:29] what do you think though now the other
[00:39:32] thing is though I have a I have a plan
[00:39:33] for some um different type
[00:39:36] of um fun things for everybody to be
[00:39:39] involved in now the game if you want to
[00:39:41] play as you know you have all the
[00:39:43] options
[00:39:50] there that is not the one that I
[00:39:55] wanted
[00:39:57] okay let's try this
[00:39:58] then thought I downloaded that did I
[00:40:02] not it did not
[00:40:04] download hey well you know what hey
[00:40:06] being off on a weekend is nice I'm I
[00:40:07] mean for me it's going to be not too bad
[00:40:09] because I actually
[00:40:12] being slower here I get to take some
[00:40:14] time and do some stuff more with the
[00:40:15] family while I hang out so that's
[00:40:17] actually not too
[00:40:25] bad
[00:40:33] let's see what they do
[00:40:46] here wonder if I can do it like that or
[00:40:48] is that going to be too much maybe have
[00:40:50] to do one at a time I have a program on
[00:40:52] my tablet here that allows me to do some
[00:40:55] um animation on the pictures that I make
[00:40:58] that's what I'm trying to do here to see
[00:41:00] if I can animate the last one that I did
[00:41:01] with the family on being know in the
[00:41:03] Fallout Wasteland
[00:41:07] here see what happens maybe it'll work
[00:41:10] maybe it
[00:41:23] won't
[00:41:25] NOP
[00:41:29] nope ah this doesn't work nice no it's
[00:41:32] not like the other one that doesn't work
[00:41:34] the other
[00:41:35] way just do not like it we do not like
[00:41:40] that all right so there we go that will

[00:57:40] YouTube with the kids that's actually
[00:57:42] why we started doing this they uh my
[00:57:43] youngest my youngest uh said they saw
[00:57:45] videos my oldest like oh can we do some
[00:57:47] of those like I don't know if I can
[00:57:49] afford to do
[00:57:50] that but you know what we'll find maybe
[00:57:53] we can find a way to do it and then um
[00:57:55] one of them found people doing things
[00:57:57] like this and then that's how we became
[00:58:01] here we do this for one and a half
[00:58:03] strength if you want to go to your
[00:58:11] rer oh little burp

[00:58:23] be one and a half strength potentially
[00:58:25] come out with a free pack of cards at
[00:58:26] the end now my um at the moment my
[00:58:29] Fallout stuff will be in a little bit
[00:58:31] later today due to shipping delays for
[00:58:34] everyone along I guess around the
[00:58:36] country had some so uh we just start
[00:58:39] these ones up though after I Oh I
[00:58:41] thought that was still running I didn't
[00:58:42] know that was taken down oh I'm GNA
[00:58:44] change that up there I thought was done
[00:58:46] I'm rerunning that there and we're going
[00:58:47] to do it this
[00:58:50] here I like doing quick ones for you all
[00:58:55] now remember
[00:59:09] if all right there we
[00:59:12] go we'll uh put that up there and then
[00:59:15] I'm going to let you know I'm going to
[00:59:16] show you the
[00:59:18] animations let's get these out here for
[00:59:20] you let's get these out here for you I'm
[00:59:22] right you want to see this maybe you're
[00:59:23] going to be a detective wandering
[00:59:25] through the Wasteland
[00:59:27] here or maybe you'll start out as a
[00:59:30] strong human on your
[00:59:31] adventure either way whatever happens
[00:59:34] you could potentially win yourself a
[00:59:35] free pack of cards which is uh will
[00:59:38] Shuffle these up if you beat the boss
[00:59:39] and maybe come out with a pack from here
[00:59:42] one of these ones which could be a
[00:59:45] collect uh a mystery where my audio
[00:59:49] change no it's still there a mystery I
[00:59:51] think there's murderers in there there's
[00:59:54] AF far there's modern Horizon there's
[00:59:57] war the spark there's a Homeland there's
[00:59:58] an EMA there's Lo lost Caverns but
[01:00:01] that's what's in there as those ones and
[01:00:02] if not you come out and you win and you
[01:00:04] lose against the boss you get sent back
[01:00:06] to the Vault where you do get a pack but
[01:00:09] is a little retro pack of something from
[01:00:11] I think that one's from 1999 right now
[01:00:14] but you know what maybe what we'll do in
[01:00:17] is here isbe we'll put a little
[01:00:18] different one in there if you got if you
[01:00:20] want but anyways what you can do here is
[01:00:22] you can pick your own pick your own here
[01:00:25] right there is uh whatever you have is
[01:00:27] your options is
[01:00:29] your strength potentials that you can
[01:00:31] get for your cards and right there is
[01:00:34] how your character strength would be as
[01:00:36] You Adventure through the Wasteland and
[01:00:37] if you need me to uh make anything
[01:00:38] bigger let me know I can easily do that
[01:00:41] not too hard to do it's actually a
[01:00:44] pretty easy
[01:00:46] task all right yep just hanging out here
[01:00:49] doing nothing because I got screwed
[01:00:52] again not having my Fallout stuff on
[01:00:53] time because of shipping
[01:01:00] [ __ ]

[01:07:03] here that and you guys can always pick
[01:07:05] your own stuff you don't need me to pick
[01:07:06] it for you um so on the side there you
[01:07:09] can see that tells you what I have
[01:07:11] that's all available the only thing
[01:07:12] that's not there right now is I have
[01:07:14] some um lurana flood borne bler packs
[01:07:17] that I haven't put up there they're the
[01:07:18] same price as the inkland ones but
[01:07:20] that's it all right Hayes I can say that
[01:07:23] thank you Hayes thanks coming in hanging
[01:07:26] out but uh yeah we're just hanging out
[01:07:28] here running our running our things here
[01:07:30] right now that's what's up kind of
[01:07:32] explain the game a little bit you go you
[01:07:33] get these this is going to be one and a
[01:07:35] half strength on your adventure through
[01:07:36] the Wasteland what's happens is you pick
[01:07:38] one of your characters all right over
[01:07:40] there and your characters if you need me
[01:07:42] to expand anything let me know so you
[01:07:43] can see it better but you would pick one
[01:07:45] of those characters and maybe you're
[01:07:47] like a mutant you to go wander through
[01:07:48] the Wasteland here then what happened is
[01:07:50] is you have these three kind of color
[01:07:54] boxes to pick from where you have plus
[01:07:56] one minus one or a plus one minus one or
[01:07:58] a plus one minus one you could pull out
[01:08:00] of each now the these ones are 78 the
[01:08:03] red and green which is a 5050 and then
[01:08:05] the blue is a 12 cards which is um uh
[01:08:11] 2575 then what happens is if you have
[01:08:13] enough strength which we've had last
[01:08:15] show we had yesterday multiple people
[01:08:18] won where they beat the boss and what
[01:08:20] happens is you go up against one of
[01:08:21] these if you have enough strength you
[01:08:23] pull one of these out and we say oh
[01:08:24] maybe it's this one and you know what oh
[01:08:27] no you did not get lucky Sauron came out
[01:08:31] you round a corner you see saon and he
[01:08:33] goes oh no he turns the corner and then
[01:08:34] he flicks you away with his
[01:08:36] finger you get thrown back to a
[01:08:39] wasteland to the Vault where you get
[01:08:41] this special pack there in the vault
[01:08:42] from 95 it is not a magic Pack set but
[01:08:45] it is a just a random set of uh cards
[01:08:49] from back in the day that you find in
[01:08:50] the vault in a in a thing there but
[01:08:52] maybe you got lucky happen to win and
[01:08:54] you came out on top well then what we
[01:08:56] would do here is we would Shuffle these
[01:08:58] up and you would get your chance of
[01:08:59] getting another free pack of cards which
[01:09:00] could be maybe it's a murders maybe it's
[01:09:03] a uh modern Horizon maybe it's a uh
[01:09:07] Homeland maybe it's an EMA booster maybe
[01:09:09] it's an LCI collector I mean set booster
[01:09:12] now if you guys do depending on what it
[01:09:14] is um if you purchase any of my higher
[01:09:17] price ones where you go with some of the
[01:09:19] uh collect set boosters or collector
[01:09:21] boosters I do end up throwing in here a
[01:09:23] collector booster in there as a
[01:09:25] potential that you could pull out too
[01:09:26] but either way you always get a pack of
[01:09:28] something it's just a little fun game
[01:09:29] you pay and it's free because you just
[01:09:31] always get your packs plus whatever it
[01:09:35] is plus the game that's it so you always
[01:09:38] get your packs it's just the game is
[01:09:40] plus the packs if you want to play the
[01:09:42] game you don't have to play it because I
[01:09:44] have lots of people that don't always
[01:09:46] play it but you can always tell me what
[01:09:48] you want too I don't need to give it to
[01:09:50] you you can say hey this is what I'd
[01:09:51] like to be for a character you guys

[01:10:16] there so what I'll do here is I'll put
[01:10:19] up a little something different then

[01:11:05] order from my distributor comes in that
[01:11:07] would be nice where I can actually have
[01:11:10] my Fallout stuff show up that would be
[01:11:12] pretty

[01:11:53] two my kids have done with us but um I
[01:11:56] actually do was thinking of getting
[01:11:57] Pokemon in because I've had a people a
[01:11:59] lot of people ask about it but I don't
[01:12:01] know so my kids would kind of hang out
[01:12:03] with me and do that because they know
[01:12:04] more of it than I do I don't know as
[01:12:05] much they're they're 10 and or gonna be
[01:12:07] 11 and nine 10 and eight right now but
[01:12:11] yeah no I'm sorry I don't do any Pokemon
[01:12:12] there Hayes I am mainly magic or lurana
[01:12:15] we do lurana because I U my family was a
[01:12:18] big fan of that and we started playing
[01:12:19] with that right away because my wife
[01:12:21] actually got into it and that was nice
[01:12:23] cuz my wife played lurana now she plays
[01:12:25] magic with us and she has her own deck
[01:12:27] that she plays that I had to soup up for

[01:12:31] actually go and like she's like you know
[01:12:32] what actually I want to play too that's
[01:12:34] fun and then so she has a Fairy Deck
[01:12:36] because she ra she reads some like book
[01:12:38] about fairies some like I don't know
[01:12:39] it's like a bestseller New York Times
[01:12:41] bestseller I know but she that made her
[01:12:43] getting interested in in some of that
[01:12:45] fantasy stuff so now she was reading
[01:12:47] this book about fairies and I had to
[01:12:48] make her that Fairy Deck Wilds of All
[01:12:50] Drain I souped that one up for her so
[01:12:52] she actually plays with us now CU she's
[01:12:54] like oh this is like the fairy in the
[01:12:55] book oh this is like the fairy in the
[01:12:57] book I'm like I know I've been trying to
[01:12:59] explain to you for years that this is
[01:13:01] pretty fun to play you don't need to
[01:13:03] play Forever maybe one game like a game
[01:13:05] night day one game and that's it with
[01:13:06] the

[01:13:37] looking for
[01:13:39] here I don't know it's up to you
[01:13:42] potentially but this would be one
[01:13:43] strength on your
[01:13:45] adventure maybe you're going to be the
[01:13:46] lucky person it's the mut that faces off
[01:13:48] against Mary at the end and it comes out

[01:13:55] things but you can pick out whatever you
[01:13:56] want I don't need to do it we hang out
[01:13:58] here in the
[01:14:00] morning now uh I do have some of my toys
[01:14:03] from when I uh so anybody um so when I
[01:14:05] uh started playing Fallout was at
[01:14:07] Fallout one one of the things I did get
[01:14:10] I picked up this when Fallout 3 came out
[01:14:12] I'm kicked myself now that I didn't get
[01:14:14] any of the
[01:14:15] helmets because I could have gotten some
[01:14:17] of the helmets back then but I uh I
[01:14:19] didn't end up getting that and like I
[01:14:20] ended up just getting this and this is
[01:14:22] the one from Fallout 3 I actually had to
[01:14:24] tape it together because it came
[01:14:26] apart but I will this is uh
[01:14:30] my I had also I I waited in line with
[01:14:33] Fallout one so I've been I've been a big
[01:14:36] fan for years of it l i want to get this
[01:14:38] off here I want to be gentle so it
[01:14:39] doesn't
[01:14:41] rip but yeah I've been a big fan of it
[01:14:44] since since I was uh very
[01:14:47] young I started playing it here's my
[01:14:49] vault tech look at
[01:14:52] that my holot tape how many people have
[01:14:55] DVDs anymore of anything I don't even
[01:14:56] know how to play
[01:14:59] that and then look at that I actually
[01:15:02] have a bobble
[01:15:06] head yeah pretty cool
[01:15:09] huh I was debating on putting that out
[01:15:12] like
[01:15:13] that instead and having like some of my
[01:15:16] other stuff like this out in the

[01:19:49] Pokemon all right but anyway hey Sam
[01:19:54] let's go on to this here our buddy Sam
[01:20:02] LC um what I'm going to do here is you
[01:20:04] have your choice what you'd like to be
[01:20:06] as your character as you wander through
[01:20:07] the Wasteland maybe you're going to get
[01:20:08] uh like I said maybe you'll come out on
[01:20:10] top or maybe you're just going to wander
[01:20:12] back to the Vault and get yourself a
[01:20:13] little pack of something from earlier on
[01:20:15] in the days of
[01:20:17] 95 now we can rip these open if you want
[01:20:20] at some point or you can just ship them
[01:20:21] but you have your character choices
[01:20:23] right
[01:20:24] here there are four you have a
[01:20:30] technician you
[01:20:32] have a
[01:20:37] human strong human you've got a
[01:20:40] detective wandering through the
[01:20:43] Wasteland or you got a mutant whichever
[01:20:46] one you want to be there and I can
[01:20:48] expand those if you need me to see help
[01:20:50] that
[01:20:51] too
[01:20:54] no no here if you need to read it here
[01:20:55] let me do this for
[01:21:01] you there you go I just try to keep it
[01:21:05] always off to the side so it's always
[01:21:08] visible there you go hopefully that's
[01:21:10] better for
[01:21:16] you then let me know whatever one you
[01:21:18] want to be and then um once you figure
[01:21:20] that out let's go to mute all right now

[01:21:23] put it back over in the corner that way
[01:21:26] uh we don't have it in the view here of
[01:21:31] everything all right do that maybe leave
[01:21:34] a little bit bigger I'll leave that a
[01:21:35] little bit bigger like that I think
[01:21:36] it'll be fine if I do that because the
[01:21:39] animations I think will be all right
[01:21:40] here all right you're going to be a
[01:21:42] mutant wandering through the Wasteland
[01:21:44] you are a mutant wandering through the
[01:21:45] Wasteland as you wander through the

[01:21:51] sometimes you eat them sometimes they
[01:21:52] help you you we're not really sure what
[01:21:54] happens let's see though do you want to

[01:24:14] think I know which way Direction you
[01:24:15] want to go you have to take a left over
[01:24:17] there around the building because as you
[01:24:18] take that left you're going to be okay
[01:24:20] and now what happens you not fine they
[01:24:23] trick you and you go wandering to that
[01:24:25] left around the building there and then
[01:24:27] what happens is you see a boss in the
[01:24:30] distance and now you go no I have a
[01:24:32] headache now you've lost one strength
[01:24:34] because you don't know what you're doing
[01:24:36] you see a boss you're kind of scared
[01:24:38] your Elemental friend is gone so you are
[01:24:40] back to one two and a half strength as
[01:24:43] you wander through the Wasteland but
[01:24:45] that's okay you could still potentially
[01:24:47] beat one of the 10 bosses here now Sam
[01:24:50] do you want me to tell me which one or
[01:24:51] should I keep picking random here
[01:24:52] because I'm just going to shuffle it up
[01:24:54] for a second here so I like to make sure
[01:24:55] they're all shuffled nice and well
[01:24:57] before we go we'll do a random one here
[01:25:00] out of these like we've been
[01:25:02] doing number three all right one two and
[01:25:05] three number three it is you're
[01:25:08] wandering through the Wasteland you hide
[01:25:09] in a you hide in a bush get away from
[01:25:11] one monster you hide in a house getting
[01:25:13] away from the other and you're starting
[01:25:14] to wander out of the house and you go
[01:25:16] few finally I'm okay and I'm safe but oh
[01:25:20] no galta come stampeding through the
[01:25:23] building and comes crushing right
[01:25:25] through all of you running over and
[01:25:28] leaving you when the Wasteland crushed
[01:25:30] you leave your food on the ground you're
[01:25:31] barely able to walk as you finish
[01:25:34] wandering through the Wasteland you see
[01:25:35] in the distance a vault and in that
[01:25:37] vault in the distance you go over and
[01:25:39] you finally you wander in that
[01:25:42] Vault and that mutant goes and they find
[01:25:48] a vault in the vault and they see a oh I
[01:25:51] forgot about that when they see a
[01:25:55] um safe and in that safe you get
[01:25:58] yourself this random pack of cards you
[01:26:00] do get out with something but it's a
[01:26:03] hyborian
[01:26:04] gates from
[01:26:06] 1995 that's your random pack of cards
[01:26:09] from back in the day but you still get
[01:26:11] yours here that was found in the vault
[01:26:13] there was no loot dropped by the VA boss
[01:26:15] but you did get some loot in a safe in
[01:26:17] the
[01:26:19] vault there we go now you want to rip
[01:26:21] these babies open all of them or should
[01:26:22] we uh go from there and uh you want me
[01:26:25] to ship them
[01:26:26] home it's up to you my buddy
[01:26:29] Sam let's rip the magic all right we'll
[01:26:33] rip that magic
[01:26:35] open all right we're gonna start with
[01:26:38] our uh murders
[01:26:41] here you want me to ship the other one
[01:26:43] back to you the Hyperion or hi
[01:26:47] hyborian all right we'll do
[01:26:50] that we're going to go go with one two 3
[01:26:54] 4 five six 7 and I'm going to move these
[01:26:57] to the back if that's okay with you
[01:26:59] because we like seeing the spores at the
[01:27:00] end now if you don't want I'm going to
[01:27:02] flip this over and I'll look at them
[01:27:03] right away but sometimes I like seeing
[01:27:04] the spoilers at the end and most people
[01:27:05] are okay with
[01:27:10] that sure me too all right we're gonna
[01:27:13] do that I'm gonna do this so we're g to
[01:27:14] put those spoilers at the end I don't
[01:27:16] like how they do that here like uh one
[01:27:17] of the things that I noticed is when you
[01:27:18] have that rip in the top those are the
[01:27:20] Japanese packs and they put the spoilers
[01:27:21] in the front where if you have the other
[01:27:23] ones they put it the other way which is
[01:27:24] US packs and they put the spoilers in
[01:27:26] the back now I'm a spoiler in the back
[01:27:27] person I guess so if anybody here is
[01:27:29] from Japan and knows why I would
[01:27:31] actually like to know why they put him
[01:27:32] in the front there all right we got it
[01:27:34] it doesn't add
[01:27:35] up bubble Smuggler shock deduce Rubble
[01:27:41] belt Maverick Make Your Move
[01:27:44] unscrupulous
[01:27:46] agent rackish scoundrel cornered crook
[01:27:50] surveillance monitor not bad there oh
[01:27:53] audience with tanti not bad for a little
[01:27:56] rare there a war leader call that's a
[01:27:59] nice one that's a nice little hit there
[01:28:02] war leaders call Bubble Smuggler foil
[01:28:05] your Island and your your throwaway card
[01:28:07] there not bad there hey now um Sam one
[01:28:10] of the things that I do for shipping if
[01:28:12] you don't you're okay with it I do this
[01:28:14] to put it in a top loader that way the
[01:28:16] top loader stays stiff and it doesn't
[01:28:18] slide out of the cards with the cards I
[01:28:20] will do them individually if you want
[01:28:23] but um it is completely up to you but
[01:28:25] the reason why I do that is because I'm
[01:28:26] going I'll give you a quick show of the
[01:28:28] reason why I noticed that when I had
[01:28:31] stuff shipped to me before that if I had
[01:28:33] one individual card in there this is
[01:28:35] what happened a few of the times I'd get
[01:28:37] the cards and they'd be shipped to me
[01:28:38] and then they come to me and then I'd
[01:28:40] have them like partially out like this
[01:28:44] so what I do is i' put them in with the
[01:28:45] two of them like that and if I give it a
[01:28:46] little tap
[01:28:49] down they don't go they go all the way
[01:28:51] down down to the bottom
[01:28:53] here and then they
[01:28:56] don't come out during shipping and
[01:28:59] they're nice and protected now is this
[01:29:01] okay or I can I can do one at a time all
[01:29:03] right I just wanted to make sure some
[01:29:05] people are like no put one in but I I
[01:29:07] like to do it because like look it like
[01:29:09] doesn't come out because I've had it
[01:29:12] come out before where I had it shipped
[01:29:13] to me and like the top of the card was
[01:29:14] hanging out and that's why I was like oh
[01:29:16] that's no I found a way around it but
[01:29:19] hey thanks for coming in uh voltech I do
[01:29:21] V do appreciate that we're going to rip

[01:36:58] things that came in that card game
[01:37:00] though was intriguing remind like you
[01:37:02] said definitely reminded me of the old
[01:37:04] uh posters from the 80s like the Beast
[01:37:05] Masters and stuff like that I actually
[01:37:07] like Beast Master when I was growing up
[01:37:09] I watched that but I'm an older I'm not
[01:37:11] as young as everybody else that comes on

[01:38:21] wheel but there's like I have like a
[01:38:22] hundred different ones and that was just
[01:38:24] going to be too long for me to type out
[01:38:25] so I said screw it I'm just going to
[01:38:27] pull one out put put it in the vault and
[01:38:29] say this is what comes out of the

[01:39:28] come out one day with some uh Alvis
[01:39:32] cards that might be what you find the
[01:39:34] Vault there at one point in your life go

[01:42:26] off that was one of my background things
[01:42:29] it's uh my family's always I've always
[01:42:30] had dragons I used to have like I
[01:42:31] painted a dragon when I was younger my
[01:42:33] mom did art stuff and she had an art
[01:42:35] studio and I painted my own like dragon
[01:42:37] that was like one of those ones that um
[01:42:38] you put um incense in so the incense
[01:42:41] used to come out its nose it was pretty
[01:42:43] cool actually growing up I was oh that's
[01:42:49] awesome you keep hanging out here I'm
[01:42:51] hoping that my mail shows up earlier
[01:42:53] today than later so that I can get
[01:42:55] everything that was ordered because it's
[01:42:57] kind of frustrating when my stop shows
[01:42:59] up not on time but that's okay I don't
[01:43:01] mind it
[01:43:04] always it's just I always do my shows in
[01:43:06] the morning that's that's why I do get
[01:43:08] frustrated when it's like specific
[01:43:10] things like this that I did pay extra
[01:43:12] for
[01:43:13] too you know but whatever it's not my
[01:43:17] fault when shipping screws things not
[01:43:19] mine or the people that
[01:43:21] we buy I buy it from you know not the
[01:43:23] distributor or the my fault it's the you
[01:43:27] know just whatever happens who knows
[01:43:28] maybe there was
[01:43:30] a I don't know the plane was on fire and
[01:43:32] that's why I didn't get on the
[01:43:35] plane because it said it didn't make it
[01:43:37] to the plane I was like what didn't make
[01:43:39] it to the plane
[01:43:41] seriously like come on
[01:43:47] guys it's frustrating but what can you
[01:43:51] do I actually need to get a refund
[01:43:53] because every time I pay for early
[01:43:54] shipping something happens and I like a
[01:43:57] 5050 if I actually get early should you
[01:43:59] ever do quicker shipping Sam like where
[01:44:01] you try to get something a little

[01:46:37] two weeks later wow that's nuts that's
[01:46:41] insane I also have um I forgot about
[01:46:44] this I haven't gotten this in there I
[01:46:45] actually got a bunch of secret lair in
[01:46:47] uh from Recently if anybody's interested
[01:46:50] in those maybe you want some uh scorpion
[01:46:53] God or maybe you would like to have the
[01:46:57] uh Prismatic
[01:47:04] nightmares I don't
[01:47:06] know
[01:47:09] Brad yes they are expensive uh I bought
[01:47:13] a chunk of them uh see if people want
[01:47:15] any I think they're like if I go and
[01:47:17] look I think they're going to be like
[01:47:18] most are like 40 bucks for them or $45
[01:47:20] for him I have to double check um what
[01:47:22] it's going to end up being
[01:47:25] but oh me too I was so upset about that
[01:47:28] one I I missed the Doctor Who one also
[01:47:31] but I need to I'm gonna like the Fallout
[01:47:33] one dude I'm jumping on that one as
[01:47:35] quick as I can and getting as many as I
[01:47:36] can because I know I'm not going to be
[01:47:38] able to um keep those for a long period
[01:47:41] of time like I'm GNA I want to open one
[01:47:43] and use them I want to put one away you
[01:47:45] know like that type of thing like and
[01:47:47] maybe maybe have a couple to sell if
[01:47:49] people want them but I was think
[01:47:50] thinking of getting like the full
[01:47:51] packages a bunch of those ones but uh
[01:47:53] yeah that Fallout one is going to sell
[01:47:55] out instantly I have a feeling
[01:47:57] especially with what's going on with
[01:47:58] Fallout
[01:48:01] now you know what maybe somebody wants
[01:48:04] to uh do some maybe someone wants to do
[01:48:07] something like this
[01:48:09] instead I know it's not
[01:48:13] normal but maybe you want to go with
[01:48:18] um some inkland here I know it's not
[01:48:22] magic and I know it's uh something El uh
[01:48:24] we do have all different things that's
[01:48:26] where I putting up here well well magic
[01:48:29] and lur Conor right now is mainly what
[01:48:30] we have so I'm gonna throw that up for a
[01:48:32] minute in case anybody you wants it hey
[01:48:35] white boy how you doing this morning I
[01:48:37] just got into Doctor Who I watched a
[01:48:38] couple episodes years ago and didn't get
[01:48:40] into it now I'm watching the beginning
[01:48:41] of enjoying it made I get yeah so like
[01:48:43] uh my son actually was watching it with
[01:48:45] us a lot because um I I watched all of
[01:48:47] them when I started watching it a long
[01:48:49] time ago but um now for whatever reason
[01:48:52] uh he started watching because we have
[01:48:53] um AT&T which gives us um max for free
[01:48:58] which has all Doctor Who so he's he
[01:48:59] watched all the way through like I think
[01:49:01] he's at like season four or something
[01:49:02] like that right now so he's he's
[01:49:04] actually in he has a lot of fun with
[01:49:07] them so white boy what you uh what do
[01:49:10] you want to do here hanging out uh we uh
[01:49:12] we're just putting the on I just put
[01:49:14] Lana up just because I've just been
[01:49:15] throwing random things up but if you
[01:49:17] want to play the game you could
[01:49:18] potentially come out with a uh free pack
[01:49:21] of cards we Shuffle these up and maybe
[01:49:23] you get yourself something from back in
[01:49:25] the back uh back in the day as an EMA or
[01:49:27] homelands maybe get yourself an dungeon
[01:49:29] dragons maybe get yourself play booster
[01:49:32] maybe you get yourself an EMA uh a uh
[01:49:34] wild CS Exon set but you get some
[01:49:37] options in here and then if you get
[01:49:38] that's if you beat the boss but if you
[01:49:40] get beat by the boss you back to the
[01:49:41] Vault and you get these pack of cards
[01:49:43] here from
[01:49:47] 1991 you can choose what you want for to
[01:49:50] you don't need me to choose them I'm
[01:49:51] just putting random stuff up for people
[01:49:53] that might want it like that's all I'm
[01:49:55] literally putting random random things
[01:49:57] up this
[01:50:00] morning like I'm G to put this up for
[01:50:02] one and a half strength warhorse how you
[01:50:05] doing bud thanks coming in hanging
[01:50:10] out so going to put this one up randomly
[01:50:12] and if uh if you want these you can
[01:50:13] choose
[01:50:18] them do that for a minute
[01:50:22] here and it's these two it's one and a
[01:50:24] half strength on your adventur cuz that
[01:50:25] is one and that is half a strength then
[01:50:27] you'd wander through picking whatever
[01:50:29] character is you want to be which is one
[01:50:31] of those right here I can always expand
[01:50:33] that to make it bigger for you if you
[01:50:35] need and then you go wandering through
[01:50:37] the Wasteland here maybe you're a uh
[01:50:39] mutant bounce back and forth between old
[01:50:42] stuff and newer Seasons it blows my mind
[01:50:43] that BBC destroyed all the reels for
[01:50:45] like 97 epis for the Original Series so
[01:50:47] they selling them to the private
[01:50:48] collector I know that was crazy crazy I
[01:50:50] heard about that too I'm like wait a
[01:50:52] minute why would you that makes no sense
[01:50:56] the red button oh okay um well the red
[01:50:58] button um if you if you uh fire the red
[01:51:01] button you can look in the frequently
[01:51:02] last questions it shows you all the
[01:51:04] different packs that are available in
[01:51:06] there and what the big priz is if you uh
[01:51:08] hit that warhorse but the red button you
[01:51:10] fire that red button off and what
[01:51:12] happens is you are going to either go up
[01:51:15] into space where you can potentially
[01:51:17] take out the moon and hit the the one p
[01:51:21] literally there is one card in the 1600
[01:51:23] card I think it's down to like 1300 now
[01:51:25] but there's one card in there that has
[01:51:27] Lord of the Rings collector booster box
[01:51:29] written on it but the rest of them are
[01:51:31] uh CS between a dollar and 10 cents any
[01:51:34] most of them are between 50 and 10 cents
[01:51:36] it actually says everything in the
[01:51:37] frequently asked questions but you could
[01:51:39] also there's also packs of cards that
[01:51:40] you can come out with everything from
[01:51:42] murders to collector boosters to set
[01:51:45] boosters to Ema to I think there's
[01:51:48] Homeland and stuff in there but what
[01:51:50] happens is if I happen to be out of
[01:51:52] whatever is in here I give you an
[01:51:53] alternate of something that is um
[01:51:55] available in my store that's of similar
[01:51:57] value because I can't go through 1 1600
[01:51:59] cars all the time and address them so we
[01:52:01] just give alternates of similar value
[01:52:03] and that's what that red button is there
[01:52:04] if you uh want to try it's always like I
[01:52:07] said it's in the uh frequently asked
[01:52:08] questions and it explains it uh but you
[01:52:10] can do whatever you want there normally
[01:52:12] what I was expecting people to do would
[01:52:14] be like hey give me a pack of cards and
[01:52:16] add the red button on to it for like you
[01:52:18] know four red button hits or something
[01:52:20] like that cuz I want to try my luck so
[01:52:22] that's what I kind of built it was the
[01:52:23] expectation that it was going to be used
[01:52:25] like because we had some requests of
[01:52:26] having a large hit box and I didn't have
[01:52:28] like a big card so they you know what
[01:52:30] throw a whole collector booster in there
[01:52:31] I'm like you know what I can do that I
[01:52:33] can do that and so that's what we ended
[01:52:35] up doing and uh so600 cards and that's
[01:52:38] what it is there we saw yesterday it was
[01:52:40] either yesterday or the day before
[01:52:41] somebody did get one of the murders at
[01:52:43] car love man or play boosters that was
[01:52:45] pulled out um then there I actually
[01:52:48] added a couple more packs in there
[01:52:50] because I felt that after 15 hits we had
[01:52:53] only had one person get a a play booster
[01:52:56] pulled out so I added some more play boo
[01:52:58] I added two more play boosters and an
[01:52:59] AFR set booster in there so there was
[01:53:01] three more added in than than what's in
[01:53:03] there in the um in the description there
[01:53:05] but yeah that's the game you press that
[01:53:07] maybe um if maybe you get lucky you go
[01:53:09] up you take out a satellite you get
[01:53:11] yourself a pack of cards I don't know
[01:53:14] we'll see what happens or maybe you're
[01:53:16] unlucky and you get that card that says
[01:53:19] it's a a or less or maybe around a
[01:53:21] dollar or maybe it's 10 cents and you
[01:53:22] come cry crashing back down to earth
[01:53:25] with a giant explosion with a big
[01:53:27] no of
[01:53:30] nothing warhorse going with one red
[01:53:33] button all right let's do it let's do
[01:53:36] that red button I'm G to put our game
[01:53:38] off to the side right here there we
[01:53:42] go there we are there and we have our
[01:53:45] red button we're going to press our red

[01:57:05] need to blow cars up on my ride to and
[01:57:08] from anywhere I'm going this is what I
[01:57:10] do I go I come in the car and I'm

[01:57:16] I'm like
[01:57:17] a blow
[01:57:22] that's what I do I fire my
[01:57:24] missiles so but
[01:57:28] anyways I get to pretend you know like
[01:57:30] you know you're uh you're a uh you know
[01:57:33] secret agent in a truck going through
[01:57:34] and it's going to go out the front of
[01:57:36] your go your headlights and take out the
[01:57:37] car in front of you maybe throw maybe
[01:57:39] cut the car off and throw an oil slick
[01:57:41] behind you something like that but
[01:57:43] anyways let's see what happens Sam all
[01:57:45] right let's see if you get something
[01:57:47] let's go we got a swamp from an extended
[01:57:50] art one from our uh marching machine

[01:58:08] ones
[01:58:10] there I know definitely should come in
[01:58:12] every car like I feel like um like if
[01:58:14] you ever have a Tesla that you have to
[01:58:16] have it and it has to go on the screen
[01:58:18] that when you press it goes on the
[01:58:19] screen and it shows like an animated VR
[01:58:21] like an a an augmented reality of it
[01:58:24] hitting the vehicle in front of you and
[01:58:25] blowing up like that would be that would
[01:58:28] almost make me buy a Tesla if that makes
[01:58:30] any sense like I would almost buy one
[01:58:32] just for the fact that it has that
[01:58:33] little picture there and you can just
[01:58:35] press the button and be like you can
[01:58:36] press it and be like I'm gonna blow this
[01:58:37] [ __ ] up oh I hate you cut me
[01:58:43] off I'm sorry get a little into it on
[01:58:46] that one
[01:58:48] there I I grew up um in New England uh
[01:58:51] so I drove in some bad cars uh driving
[01:58:53] there in Boston area and then I moved
[01:58:55] here to Florida and I'm like all right
[01:58:57] this is some bad drivers up there and
[01:58:59] then I move here I'm like oh wow the
[01:59:00] drivers are a different type of bad down
[01:59:02] here it's the old person that doesn't
[01:59:04] know what they doing and shouldn't be on
[01:59:06] the
[01:59:06] road or they do know what they're doing
[01:59:08] they just are so scared because they got
[01:59:10] to whatever and then you got the young
[01:59:11] ones that are the the other people that
[01:59:13] don't want them that just weave in and
[01:59:14] out you know can sit in the car
[01:59:16] sometimes you like I think I'm going to
[01:59:17] die just by just by not even moving
[01:59:22] but that's your missiles there we also
[01:59:24] have our other games we do have a bunch
[01:59:26] of other games that we play on a regular
[01:59:28] basis here we have our mystery packs now
[01:59:31] the mystery packs if you want to play
[01:59:32] those ones that's a kind of a fun one
[01:59:35] too with the that's not the adventure I
[01:59:36] just put the adventure back up here but
[01:59:38] the mystery packs is we got three boxes
[01:59:41] one is named the father one's named the
[01:59:42] buyer On's in the Sun and we line those
[01:59:44] up here you pull out three of these and
[01:59:47] what happens with the game is you you
[01:59:49] line those up in front of them and you
[01:59:50] get your three mystery packs you always
[01:59:52] get the packs that are there but what
[01:59:54] happens is if maybe you get lucky enough
[01:59:56] that you open up a pack and the highest
[01:59:57] mono value is the dart that hits its
[01:59:59] Target like in a carnival you throwing
[02:00:01] darts at a board there the highest Dart
[02:00:03] that hits Target maybe the buyer box
[02:00:05] where you get maybe a free pack maybe
[02:00:06] it's a son's box where it's like an
[02:00:07] extra pack of cards I mean an extra card
[02:00:10] or maybe it's a father's box where it's
[02:00:11] just like a card that you're gonna get
[02:00:13] but you do got a bunch of games here if
[02:00:14] you want to play those that's why we're
[02:00:16] called fos Gamers we um we come up with
[02:00:19] games to play We like playing games
[02:00:23] here that's why we do our animated ones
[02:00:25] here the boys were the ones that were
[02:00:26] like you got to get some animations we
[02:00:28] see those on YouTube and that would be
[02:00:30] really fun if you could get them going
[02:00:31] here I'm like all right I'll try that
[02:00:32] out so we did so we have a Triceratops
[02:00:37] that's going to trample you in the
[02:00:38] Wasteland if you happen to pull that one
[02:00:39] out as a boss or maybe you're going to
[02:00:41] be strong enough to go up against the
[02:00:43] Velociraptor and come out with a win
[02:00:46] because you have over three strength
[02:00:49] maybe you're with three and a half
[02:00:50] strength and you be beat the
[02:00:51] Velociraptor that would be pretty
[02:00:55] sweet let's do this here for some packs
[02:00:58] right now this will get you one and a
[02:01:01] half strength on your adventure through
[02:01:02] the Wasteland now I don't need to keep
[02:01:04] picking these you can tell me what you
[02:01:05] want to do here but I just keep putting
[02:01:07] them up randomly because it's it's easy
[02:01:09] for me to put stuff up and if you want
[02:01:11] it you want it you don't you
[02:01:13] don't but yeah we got a lot of we got a
[02:01:15] lot of fun here we play our games we do
[02:01:17] our little Ed Venture in the Wasteland
[02:01:20] on a regular basis here with our
[02:01:23] animations have lots of fun I do
[02:01:25] appreciate you guys coming in hanging
[02:01:26] out that was pretty good now we have uh
[02:01:28] we have some entertaining things we talk
[02:01:30] about too every now and again if we
[02:01:31] happen to get into the uh right right
[02:01:35] discussion you know I've had it where I
[02:01:37] know that fire the missiles thing my
[02:01:40] wife got it for
[02:01:41] me I think this is probably two vehicles
[02:01:45] old
[02:01:46] now I this is like probably six or seven
[02:01:49] years
[02:01:50] old and it actually works too cuz I had
[02:01:53] to use it one time to melt some rope uh
[02:01:55] when we were trying to fix up for the
[02:01:56] boat to uh to get the Rope melted
[02:01:58] together when we were making
[02:02:00] lines when we were like splicing lines
[02:02:02] together so like it actually it's a
[02:02:05] viable thing it works too you
[02:02:08] know but hey yeah that's what uh I don't
[02:02:12] know it's pretty fun here we we got to
[02:02:14] hang out have some
[02:02:17] fun
[02:02:22] hold on my audio Cuts in and out every
[02:02:23] now and again because the device changes
[02:02:25] randomly so I'm not really sure why but
[02:02:27] yeah you guys can always pick your packs
[02:02:28] that you want there you know right there
[02:02:30] it tells you everything that's available
[02:02:31] your strength what your characters would
[02:02:33] be and all that that's why I put it up
[02:02:35] on screen I can take them down too they
[02:02:38] don't need to be up I can take
[02:02:39] everything down you don't need to have
[02:02:41] anything up I'll put them back up if you
[02:02:42] want though that way you can see
[02:02:45] everything maybe you want to get
[02:02:47] yourself some something back in
[02:02:51] time let's throw this out maybe you want
[02:02:53] to go back in time and try your luck
[02:02:55] with
[02:02:56] this on the adventure through the
[02:03:00] Wasteland not super back in time a
[02:03:02] little bit back in
[02:03:05] time there you go there if you want that
[02:03:09] that will be one strength for your stren
[02:03:10] adventure through the Wasteland maybe
[02:03:12] you're going to fire some missiles again
[02:03:14] after see if you come out with uh any
[02:03:16] big hits or any hits there we did have
[02:03:18] as saw if you go and watch all my shows
[02:03:20] every one of my shows is actually
[02:03:22] streamed live on YouTube all the time
[02:03:25] and they are always saved on YouTube so
[02:03:27] no matter what if you go to YouTube and
[02:03:29] you follow me as um fos Gamers even no
[02:03:33] matter what if you can't find them on
[02:03:35] any of the streaming things that I use
[02:03:36] you'll always be able to find them there
[02:03:38] because they're always going to be saved
[02:03:39] and available so I never do anything
[02:03:41] shady I never do anything I'm worried
[02:03:43] about I'm always doing stuff to have fun
[02:03:44] and give stuff away for fun so that's
[02:03:46] why um I make sure they're all shaved I
[02:03:49] have nothing I'm worried about that I'm
[02:03:50] doing is really what it boils down to I
[02:03:52] never get really kind of worried I'm
[02:03:53] doing anything wrong because I'm always
[02:03:55] trying to just do something right if
[02:03:57] that makes sense try to teach my kids be
[02:03:59] good be honest be trustworthy and things
[02:04:02] will come to you because I you know and
[02:04:04] work hard and then and things will end
[02:04:06] up working out because not doesn't
[02:04:08] always sometimes you have headaches in
[02:04:10] life but I um I started out
[02:04:14] from quite technically nothing with our
[02:04:16] family at one point my family was
[02:04:18] homeless when I was young so you know we
[02:04:20] started out one of the first houses I
[02:04:21] remember is a is a trailer and I didn't
[02:04:23] realize it was a
[02:04:24] trailer I thought it was a you know home
[02:04:27] then you grow up and you get an
[02:04:28] apartment then you then the family gets
[02:04:30] more stuff and you're like wait a minute
[02:04:31] this is
[02:04:33] different so that's when uh then you get
[02:04:35] older and you realize and somebody tells
[02:04:36] you yeah we were we didn't have a house
[02:04:38] for for a few months when we got an
[02:04:39] issue I'm like oh I didn't know that you
[02:04:42] know you were three-year-old kid you're
[02:04:43] not going to realize that but anyways
[02:04:46] you grow up and you work hard I tell my
[02:04:48] kids you work hard you be honest you can
[02:04:49] do well and that helped me get to the
[02:04:50] point that we're looking to buy catar in
[02:04:53] we are have our own house my wife and I
[02:04:56] we have trips we can go on we have a
[02:04:57] boat we have cars we have everything we
[02:04:59] need materialistically and familywise I
[02:05:03] keep trying to tell them don't worry
[02:05:04] about the material
[02:05:05] stuff I know it's hard to think about
[02:05:08] that nowadays when the material things
[02:05:09] are always in your face all the
[02:05:11] time but those material things are going
[02:05:14] to go away our family here is what's
[02:05:16] important and we're doing stuff and
[02:05:17] that's what we're doing is we're having
[02:05:18] fun with our family and that's what
[02:05:20] those materials things provide is
[02:05:23] something to do with our family to have
[02:05:25] fun it's not the item that's a cool
[02:05:28] thing it's what you need to do with it
[02:05:29] and try to forget about that because you
[02:05:31] don't always need to have that thing to
[02:05:32] do something cool with it you know Kodak

[02:32:16] lot lot of people come over with our um
[02:32:18] hang out with me with drip here so I get
[02:32:20] to play my games and not have to be uh
[02:32:22] not I'm not doing anything that's any
[02:32:24] any inappropriate because it's just
[02:32:25] something extra there's no paying extra
[02:32:27] for anything it is like getting a free
[02:32:30] item when you go to a store um that's it
[02:32:33] and that's why I do it this way that's
[02:32:35] why I have been doing it this way for a
[02:32:39] while we'll put these ones up here
[02:32:41] randomly if anybody wants hey oh guys
[02:32:44] thanks for coming in hanging out I do o
[02:32:46] G SZ I do appreciate it but we're going
[02:32:49] to play some games right here we're
[02:32:51] going to put this one up for this if you
[02:32:54] want to play it and this will get you
[02:32:57] one and a half strength on your
[02:32:58] adventure through the
[02:33:03] Wasteland yeah I know um well now I
[02:33:07] because of everything thatt um uh that
[02:33:09] scenario doing the where I work I have
[02:33:12] lawyers that are provided to me at
[02:33:14] pretty much no charge it's just a very
[02:33:16] it's like $2 a month um so uh I have now
[02:33:21] um every time I make any type of new
[02:33:22] thing I go to lawyers they're going to
[02:33:24] look at everything make sure I'm all
[02:33:26] good um and there's no issues and then
[02:33:28] if there is something that gets sent to
[02:33:29] me I can send it over to the lawyer as
[02:33:30] my understanding so it sucks that I have
[02:33:33] to go that route rather than just trying
[02:33:34] to be a good honest person because
[02:33:35] there's enough people that are shitty
[02:33:37] people I guess in the
[02:33:45] world
[02:33:58] there you go my sound's back my sound
[02:33:59] disappears every now and again I don't
[02:34:00] know why but yeah we having some fun
[02:34:03] here doing our thing keep keep doing our
[02:34:05] keep keep selling our patch and playing
[02:34:07] our games because we like to play our
[02:34:08] games there's nothing wrong with our
[02:34:09] games you get to have some fun and get
[02:34:11] some free that's all it
[02:34:15] is going put that back because I think
[02:34:17] that one is up there yep that is up on
[02:34:21] that side we're going to put another one
[02:34:23] over here and I'm going to do
[02:34:27] this with this one actually we're going
[02:34:31] to try this let's go after some mystery
[02:34:32] stuff in h in a
[02:34:36] dungeon try that out if you want start
[02:34:40] yourself on an adventure through the
[02:34:43] Wasteland OG SZ
[02:34:51] oh wow that's interesting that's crazy
[02:34:53] see now like I I the thing is though
[02:34:56] they said um bounties mean you get
[02:34:57] something and you don't um everybody
[02:35:00] always got something so there's never
[02:35:01] really a bounty that's why like their
[02:35:04] definitions and their explanations are
[02:35:05] not what they said um the first time I
[02:35:08] did make a mistake and I did understand
[02:35:09] I misunderstood the way the directions
[02:35:11] were the first version of the game and
[02:35:12] that's why I corrected it uh but after
[02:35:14] that it was a little different so that's
[02:35:16] why the game is perfectly fine the way
[02:35:17] it is now uh but as I said I just need
[02:35:20] to uh I just need to talk to lawyers now
[02:35:23] to make sure everything is good but hey
[02:35:24] it's one of those shitty things about
[02:35:26] the world this day in age is that
[02:35:28] um a lot of times people just do stuff
[02:35:31] to cover their CA companies whether they
[02:35:34] are right or wrong or the person was
[02:35:36] right or wrong like I could have been
[02:35:37] completely right on everything I was
[02:35:39] doing but they just do a CA thing and
[02:35:42] then you have to get a lawyer then
[02:35:44] that's how it have to handle from that
[02:35:45] point on because they are just trying to
[02:35:47] cover their own ass and it's not it's
[02:35:49] not and I feel bad also for the company
[02:35:50] at the same time because it's not always
[02:35:52] them it's other people that are dealing
[02:35:54] with this stuff like it happens
[02:35:55] everywhere I used to deal with it when I
[02:35:57] work for Sprint like people would come
[02:35:59] in and yell at me about stuff um when I
[02:36:01] manage Sprint stores back in the day
[02:36:04] like you're doing this wrong this is
[02:36:05] screwing up my bill I'm like dude I have
[02:36:07] nothing to do with your bill I work in
[02:36:09] the store all I have to do is fix your
[02:36:11] phone and set it up I don't I don't do
[02:36:14] anything to having to do anything with
[02:36:15] your bill like I never even sold you a
[02:36:17] phone so you're even coming to me after
[02:36:19] like you already bought it somewhere
[02:36:20] else online and yelling me at about
[02:36:22] it so like I get it on a regular basis I
[02:36:25] completely understand what the crap is
[02:36:26] that everyone deals with it's just
[02:36:28] shitty that they have to deal with it
[02:36:29] and then they have to do a see everyone
[02:36:31] and every business now has to ca and now
[02:36:34] I'm gonna have to do it too no no I
[02:36:36] didn't
[02:36:39] die no it isn't it isn't close to any
[02:36:42] bounties of any kind but you know what
[02:36:44] that's okay the game we I did not not
[02:36:46] die I am still alive I'll probably be
[02:36:48] back like I think Wednesday or something
[02:36:50] and I'm going to have um it's a good
[02:36:52] chance I'm going to have like 12 boxes
[02:36:53] of uh fallout by the way on on Tuesday
[02:36:56] or Wednesday so um if you are interested
[02:36:59] in any Fallout or you know anyone it is
[02:37:00] send them AR over here we'll be uh doing
[02:37:03] some Fallout games here so it should be
[02:37:05] pretty fun maybe uh maybe you'll come
[02:37:07] out and get some um something big
[02:37:10] yourself but um I also yeah I'm gonna
[02:37:12] have like
[02:37:14] probably six and 12 boxes of Fallout
[02:37:17] does uh does anybody have a lot of
[02:37:19] Fallout around I haven't seen it
[02:37:20] anywhere uh here
[02:37:23] much so like I've been trying to figure
[02:37:25] out I can't see a lot of Fallout that
[02:37:26] many people have and if they have it
[02:37:28] it's like maybe one box they don't have
[02:37:31] multiple boxes they like have a handful
[02:37:33] of
[02:37:36] them let's do
[02:37:44] uh let's do
[02:37:48] this here we go what did a
[02:37:54] freeze oh
[02:38:03] no I think we're good
[02:38:06] now good
[02:38:09] now all right I think we're good
[02:38:12] now yeah sometimes that freezes uh they
[02:38:16] here but uh we'll put this thing up
[02:38:18] right now if anybody wants
[02:38:20] it but yeah we still play the games we
[02:38:22] don't have any we actually I haven't
[02:38:24] really done anything wrong um actually I
[02:38:26] uh the lawyers I talked to actually said
[02:38:28] I didn't do anything wrong but uh it was
[02:38:30] one of those just follow what they say
[02:38:32] till we figure it out and then from this
[02:38:34] point forward we can argue because then
[02:38:36] we'll have set it up correctly within
[02:38:38] whatever they say so that's what we're
[02:38:40] doing here anyways we're having fun and
[02:38:42] playing our games here we're having a
[02:38:44] good time this is always a good time on
[02:38:45] drip here playing these
[02:38:51] things yeah you can see you can see yep
[02:38:54] there's a lot of uh a lot of them here
[02:38:55] and I have a lot of uh myself like I
[02:38:57] said there's a lot in here so yeah
[02:39:00] Supply was cut because well see this is
[02:39:03] what I actually think um what uh Wizards
[02:39:06] is doing here I call This months ago I
[02:39:10] told my wife in um
[02:39:13] probably before Christmas what they're
[02:39:16] going to start doing is they are going
[02:39:17] to start going and sending all of the
[02:39:19] when they came out with play boosters
[02:39:20] they started talking about this thing
[02:39:21] like ah [ __ ] we're [ __ ] I'm sorry for
[02:39:23] saying that word out loud here I didn't
[02:39:25] mean to swear well I did I did it on but
[02:39:27] what's gonna happen is is play boosters
[02:39:30] are going to
[02:39:31] stores decks pre-con decks are going to
[02:39:34] stores and will be readily available
[02:39:37] Commander I mean collector
[02:39:38] boosters are only ever going to go to
[02:39:41] mainly Amazon because Amazon is going to
[02:39:44] have a deal with them to have a
[02:39:46] percentage and Amazon adjusts as demand
[02:39:49] goes their prices of things so they're
[02:39:51] going to get more money so that's why
[02:39:53] they're going to send them to Amazon and
[02:39:54] they're only going to send a handful to
[02:39:56] the stores just to have the stores have
[02:39:58] one or two to be able to have them
[02:40:00] that's what's going to be going on in
[02:40:02] the future with command collector
[02:40:03] boosters that's exactly what your
[02:40:05] everyone is going to see whether they
[02:40:07] like that or not that's what's going to
[02:40:09] end up happening and I thoroughly
[02:40:12] believe that I called that months ago
[02:40:14] and seeing what they're doing now I'm
[02:40:16] like that's exactly what they're doing
[02:40:18] right now and the reason why I call that
[02:40:20] is I've worked with I worked with a lot
[02:40:21] of um the companies and things I've
[02:40:23] worked with in the past have lots of
[02:40:25] money um I used to watch trillions of
[02:40:27] dollars get traded on a daily basis well
[02:40:30] not a weekly basis billions on a daily
[02:40:32] basis trillions on on a weekly basis
[02:40:34] being traded between on stock markets
[02:40:36] around the world and one of the things
[02:40:39] that you learn is how business people
[02:40:41] act and the things they do they don't
[02:40:43] really always care about the game game
[02:40:45] or anything else like that they care
[02:40:47] about money only and what they see here
[02:40:49] is a way they were trying to figure out
[02:40:51] a way to make money off of this quicker
[02:40:54] and better than they were making before
[02:40:57] and they have found a way to kind of do
[02:40:59] that they're GNA tell every their
[02:41:00] playable cards will be nice and cheap
[02:41:04] for everybody to get but the expensive
[02:41:06] ones the uh are going to be the
[02:41:07] collector boosters you're going to get
[02:41:08] and you're going to have a hard time
[02:41:09] getting them they're going to end up
[02:41:10] being like $500 to$ th000 doll a
[02:41:14] box yes I
[02:41:18] know yeah see well Matt see one of the
[02:41:20] things with Amazon I've noticed that is
[02:41:23] if you do pre-order with them there's a
[02:41:25] good chance you get everything actually
[02:41:26] correct but if you do anything after
[02:41:28] pre-order you're just going to get
[02:41:30] repackaged
[02:41:32] crap and that's the thing that annoys
[02:41:34] that's the thing that sucks because I
[02:41:35] know what's GNA happen here is that I
[02:41:38] ordered stuff I'm going to get my first
[02:41:40] set of my order from um because I
[02:41:42] ordered stuff from Amazon to myself for
[02:41:44] my family so I ordered a couple boxes
[02:41:47] from them for my family so I could sell
[02:41:49] so I didn't have to sell them that was
[02:41:50] just like my family to have and what's
[02:41:51] going to happen is I'm going to end up
[02:41:53] having those and I'm G to be lucky to
[02:41:55] maybe get the first one right away but
[02:41:57] the second one I ended up ordering late
[02:41:59] because my other orders that I ended up
[02:42:01] getting I was going to hold one of the
[02:42:02] boxes that I got from um my distributor
[02:42:05] person I was going to keep one of those
[02:42:06] but because I couldn't I ordered another
[02:42:07] one later and that one's supposedly not
[02:42:09] going to be delivered until like like
[02:42:10] the 20th or something that one that's
[02:42:13] going to be delivered on the 20th is
[02:42:14] going to end up being being opened gone
[02:42:16] through and I'm not going to get
[02:42:21] anything yep exactly yeah so that's why
[02:42:24] like exactly I bought a lot of I bought
[02:42:26] a lot of stuff and the only time I ever
[02:42:27] get lucky is when it is brand new
[02:42:31] release day and there's like really no
[02:42:33] way of anybody sending them back and
[02:42:36] exchanging them already and that is the
[02:42:38] only time I've ever came away with
[02:42:39] Amazon that's why I do Amazon only on
[02:42:41] like releases of it and if I don't get
[02:42:44] them right away and I start get the
[02:42:45] repackage stuff that's when I cancel
[02:42:47] everything like I don't do that
[02:42:52] anymore it just sucks but I'm gonna put
[02:42:55] this one up
[02:42:57] here for those that want to be uh for
[02:43:02] a two one and a half strength on your
[02:43:05] adventure through the
[02:43:08] Wasteland maybe you'll have some fun
[02:43:11] we'll find
[02:43:14] out
[02:43:18] but yeah we're uh we're having some fun
[02:43:19] here we still play our games we have a
[02:43:21] good
[02:43:24] time I know time to work parttime for
[02:43:26] Amazon I
[02:43:28] know yeah you know what I know uh you
[02:43:31] only work certain days and you make sure
[02:43:33] they release
[02:43:34] [Laughter]
[02:43:38] days that's pretty I know think it's
[02:43:40] kind of
[02:43:41] funny I never thought about that that
[02:43:44] that the people that work there would
[02:43:45] get him hey you see I got my
[02:43:47] Stratosphere
[02:43:49] in uh K works I got my dragon from Car

[02:46:09] been seeing was around $40 a pack
[02:46:11] everywhere on um TCG player and stuff
[02:46:13] sadly everything's been marked upop so
[02:46:15] much that like you can't actually get
[02:46:16] them like at anything cheaper than being
[02:46:18] able to do $40 a pack it's just it's
[02:46:21] just crazy now I Su and like um see what
[02:46:24] I was wondering with this is if it's
[02:46:27] going to be one of those ones where it's
[02:46:28] going to go up and it's going to end up
[02:46:29] being like $300 a box type
[02:46:34] thing you know what I
[02:46:44] mean
[02:46:49] yeah so anyways we'll try our stuff
[02:46:52] here if somebody wants to play some
[02:46:54] games you
[02:46:56] can but yeah that's $40 a pack that's a
[02:46:58] lot I was expecting it I my guess
[02:47:01] actually at one point my wife goes I can
[02:47:03] see them going up to being like $60 to
[02:47:05] $70 a pack I'm like I don't know about
[02:47:08] that M that's and it's like well they're
[02:47:10] going up to be $400 a box and I'm like
[02:47:12] oh great that's awesome
[02:47:16] so we're going to put this one up here
[02:47:18] let's do this
[02:47:19] for one and a half strength on your
[02:47:21] adventure through the Wasteland I press
[02:47:23] the wrong button
[02:47:28] there one and a half strength on your
[02:47:30] adventure through the Wasteland if you
[02:47:36] want not worth it to you yeah yeah I
[02:47:39] understand that well that's why I said I
[02:47:41] got the commander uh decks too that I'll
[02:47:43] have available
[02:47:47] you just buy B equipment
[02:47:49] stocks you're buying B equipment stocks
[02:47:51] are you are
[02:47:53] huh no makes sense a little bit you
[02:47:56] gotta have the bees are the only things
[02:47:57] that have everything alive keeping the
[02:47:58] world going all
[02:48:13] right
[02:48:18] all right so yeah well we'll hang out
[02:48:24] here you love it but sadly this set has
[02:48:27] ruined my taste yeah you know what I am
[02:48:30] a giant fan of Fallout but the way that
[02:48:32] they did that and they didn't give
[02:48:33] enough them out it did it did actually
[02:48:35] ruin it for me a little bit because what
[02:48:38] I wanted to do is I wanted to be able to
[02:48:40] go and have ones that I open for my
[02:48:41] family and stuff like that and have some
[02:48:44] fun that way but it's made it's been
[02:48:46] actually such a big headache and then
[02:48:48] with the other thing going on where I'm
[02:48:49] not able to do it in the right locate
[02:48:51] like play the game the game headache
[02:48:53] that I had like it just it's almost like
[02:48:55] sadly it's almost like I I I don't want
[02:48:58] to give up but at the same time I feel
[02:48:59] like I should almost stop but then I'm
[02:49:02] sitting there going you know what the
[02:49:03] two people that came in there's certain
[02:49:05] people that showed up and then I had an
[02:49:07] issue and I feel like I need to go back
[02:49:10] and make sure I destroy that and that
[02:49:13] destroy them so that it never happens
[02:49:14] and and I'm the one that's at the top
[02:49:17] but that H who who knows if that'll
[02:49:20] happen but it's you know what I mean
[02:49:22] there if that ever makes any sense at if
[02:49:24] that makes any sense at all you might
[02:49:25] have an understanding of what I'm
[02:49:26] getting at
[02:49:28] there I'm going to put these ones on
[02:49:31] here because a little suspicious of some
[02:49:33] scenarios that
[02:49:36] occurred there you go for the adventure
[02:49:43] game
[02:49:47] yeah yeah yeah well thank you I
[02:49:49] appreciate that yeah no there's um we'll
[02:49:51] just put it this way that I'm not I
[02:49:53] don't want I don't like naming names
[02:49:54] there's a lot of people on there that
[02:49:56] are
[02:50:00] um that do not have the same values I
[02:50:03] have we just we say that and they will
[02:50:07] stoop down to whatever level they need
[02:50:09] to feel like they can um try to harm a
[02:50:12] business in some way and I've been there
[02:50:14] before um I've worked in different
[02:50:15] stores and things like that and I've
[02:50:17] dealt with that in the past uh so this
[02:50:19] is the first time I've had to deal with
[02:50:20] it here though so now what I plan on
[02:50:23] doing is um like I said I like I have
[02:50:25] lawyer to deal with stuff now more to
[02:50:27] Pro to let me know if things are okay
[02:50:29] and also um I plan on um I told them to
[02:50:35] actually look at everyone else the the
[02:50:37] people that may me issues and see what
[02:50:39] they say so we'll see what
[02:50:43] happens
[02:50:45] yeah good and bad and
[02:50:49] everything exactly everywhere everything
[02:50:51] there's good and bad everywhere sadly
[02:50:52] I've been noticing more of the bad
[02:50:54] showing up on a regular basis seems like
[02:50:56] people are trying to uh be a lot more
[02:50:58] selfish here hey Sim Simon Jimmy thanks
[02:51:02] coming in hanging out Corbin we're just
[02:51:05] doing our little thing here I'm gonna
[02:51:06] put something different up but yeah
[02:51:07] playing our adventure game maybe you're
[02:51:10] going to go through and be a mutant here
[02:51:12] but yeah the world is has some good
[02:51:14] people the world has some bad people you
[02:51:16] just need to kind of tolerate it as you
[02:51:18] go through I've been um I've been
[02:51:20] dealing with it more you know we I feel
[02:51:22] like you got to deal with it more and
[02:51:23] more you got to tolerate it more and
[02:51:24] more and more uh these days it's
[02:51:29] not just like there's a
[02:51:35] l am I breaking up
[02:51:38] here no I think I'm
[02:51:41] okay but Simon that's what we put up for
[02:51:43] our adventure game you're going to get
[02:51:45] two strength dur on your
[02:51:49] adventure yeah I've been there before my
[02:51:52] I've
[02:51:57] um I've learned how to deal with it and
[02:51:59] I try to do things the right way the
[02:52:01] first way I teach my children here we'll
[02:52:03] give an example of something here uh my
[02:52:05] child plays soccer my youngest plays
[02:52:08] soccer um and we have levels we have
[02:52:11] them start out with we have them start
[02:52:12] out every game we tell them start out
[02:52:14] level one
[02:52:15] level one is exactly as you would expect
[02:52:17] every soccer game to start out which is
[02:52:20] you're playing you don't touch anyone
[02:52:21] you stay away from people you kick the
[02:52:23] soccer ball you just play a good clean
[02:52:26] game well then we have level two which
[02:52:29] we'll just yell we put up our fingers
[02:52:30] for level two and that's when he gets
[02:52:32] start putting pushed around and you can
[02:52:33] see he starts getting frustrated and he
[02:52:35] doesn't want to do anything back because
[02:52:36] we've told him be good don't touch be
[02:52:38] nice don't push that's not the game
[02:52:40] that's not how you play well then he
[02:52:42] gets frustrated and he doesn't want to
[02:52:43] do anything so we got to kind of like
[02:52:44] give him a little boost to let him know
[02:52:45] you got to go to level two it's time
[02:52:47] it's time you can give a little push
[02:52:48] back bud it's not necessary but it sucks
[02:52:51] that you need to do it but you know what
[02:52:52] all right time to give a will push back
[02:52:54] I'm getting to level two right now
[02:52:56] that's what we're at so but the thing is
[02:52:58] though when level three hits that's when
[02:53:00] they start you know those kids at those
[02:53:01] times you know what he's keep pushing me
[02:53:03] back I'm gonna push him back you know
[02:53:05] what and they push him back and I go you
[02:53:06] know what buddy that's level three time
[02:53:08] when you see a nice big push or
[02:53:10] something like that I go you know level
[02:53:11] three go right at it dude if he's going
[02:53:13] to do it do the same thing back to them
[02:53:15] I know it sucks I hate having to do that
[02:53:18] but at the same time sometimes you need
[02:53:20] to let people know they put in their
[02:53:23] place and stand your ground exactly
[02:53:25] sometimes you need to stand your ground
[02:53:27] so uh and put we'll just put this
[02:53:30] example out there um what happened in
[02:53:33] one of the games was uh we he we he got
[02:53:35] up to level three because people are
[02:53:37] pushing one of the kids literally quite
[02:53:39] literally pushed him with his hands like
[02:53:43] this
[02:53:45] and my son turned around and launched
[02:53:49] the other child off the ground and I go
[02:53:51] oh [ __ ] I mean the kid was probably a
[02:53:54] half a foot in the air and went back
[02:53:56] three feet because he threw him goes you
[02:53:58] touch me again I'll hurt
[02:54:02] you you got a yellow card and got kicked
[02:54:04] off the
[02:54:06] field but I will say for the rest of the
[02:54:10] game every single kid never touched any
[02:54:13] one of our players because they knew if
[02:54:15] they did my son was going to take him
[02:54:17] the [ __ ]
[02:54:19] out like my son is the youngest one on
[02:54:22] the team by the way by almost six months
[02:54:24] to a year but he's a bigger one he's
[02:54:27] he's bigger compared to everyone he's
[02:54:29] like a Sal he looks like he plays with
[02:54:31] he's eight and he plays with the 11 year
[02:54:32] olds and they think he's 10 we'll put it
[02:54:35] that
[02:54:36] way yeah exactly he doesn't say anything
[02:54:38] he's very nice he's very he's good he
[02:54:40] does he's what he's supposed to this is
[02:54:41] what I was too but when you you it's an
[02:54:43] Irish you get to the point where all
[02:54:45] right you're at that point you can take
[02:54:47] him out and I'm GNA I'm going to blow
[02:54:48] your [ __ ] car
[02:54:50] up I'm not going to really do that but
[02:54:52] you you know the Irish carb bomb that's
[02:54:54] kind of what I was getting a little joke
[02:54:57] there not maybe not the best joke but
[02:55:00] but anyways that's what I was kind of
[02:55:01] getting at like you don't you don't mess
[02:55:02] with them because we we take care of
[02:55:04] business if we need
[02:55:06] to and that's what happened in that
[02:55:08] scenario and then those kids never
[02:55:10] touched anyone again so I don't want to
[02:55:12] have to get to three I prefer at one
[02:55:15] because I like playing and being nice
[02:55:17] because then then you have to be mean
[02:55:18] then you have to think of then you don't
[02:55:20] want it then it makes you feel like it
[02:55:22] doesn't make you feel good in your soul
[02:55:23] you know if that makes any
[02:55:29] sense we're GNA do two strength here for
[02:55:31] your adventure through the
[02:55:33] Wasteland Irishman great movie yes it

[03:02:40] ey of Vena VNA not bad I think ey of VNA
[03:02:43] is a nice a card there if I remember
[03:02:44] right
[03:02:46] Zorn that's a nice Elemental there too
[03:02:48] that's a nice card if I remember right
[03:02:50] too jaded cell sword all right so you
[03:02:53] are actually on top here with two sevens
[03:02:58] on those and what I'm going to do with
[03:03:00] these ones is I'm going to take these
[03:03:01] and I'm just going to put them in some
[03:03:02] sleeves here because I think these ones
[03:03:04] are worth a couple
[03:03:06] bucks I get those ones just
[03:03:10] protected all right so you're at seven
[03:03:13] you're going to have something from the
[03:03:14] Suns box unless you get something to
[03:03:15] beat seven from the buyer here but
[03:03:19] either way you always get your packs
[03:03:20] it's whether or not you get something a
[03:03:21] little extra let's see what happens Jim
[03:03:27] Jimmy here we go let's rip these
[03:03:35] open there we are oh got a little uh got
[03:03:38] a little preview car of what we got
[03:03:40] there for our list card one two three
[03:04:12] you

[03:04:54] windrace dude that was an awesome pack
[03:05:00] there like that was an unbelievable pack
[03:05:03] I I'm going to do this for shipping
[03:05:05] because I know these ones are worth a
[03:05:07] couple bucks here ohare talk used to be
[03:05:09] like 15
[03:05:11] bucks now I'm put ohare talk in there
[03:05:14] and you got a special guest also like

[03:05:20] guest nice special guest Lord wind Grace
[03:05:24] I have not even seen that one
[03:05:26] yet and the reason why we do this is
[03:05:28] because as you see if it's sticking out
[03:05:30] here at the Top This is how I've gotten
[03:05:31] shipped to me a couple times when
[03:05:32] they're singles but if you put them in
[03:05:33] two at a time ready you got to tap them
[03:05:36] in and then this they don't come
[03:05:40] out all right but the blue Dragon Here
[03:05:44] did win with your son for the pill from
[03:05:47] a sun would you like would you like me
[03:05:48] to do something random for that Sun's

[03:09:48] these ones up
[03:09:50] here do appreciate it hey Jimmy do
[03:09:53] appreciate that yeah we jump on

[03:09:56] morning um I'm not gonna be
[03:09:58] unnecessarily I might be on tomorrow
[03:09:59] morning I have to double check what's
[03:10:01] going on uh we might have been going to
[03:10:03] actually to a boat to go on a sailboat
[03:10:06] for the day but I'm not sure if that's
[03:10:07] actually going to be happening or not so
[03:10:09] depending on if it happens then I will
[03:10:11] be uh I won't be here if that doesn't
[03:10:13] happen I'll be here in the morning
[03:10:14] hanging out with you guys because um my
[03:10:16] son doesn't have a soccer game until
[03:10:18] later in the day so we'll be on here
[03:10:20] hanging out with you guys for a while
[03:10:21] while um well we wait and hang out when
[03:10:23] we got nothing else to do but right now
[03:10:26] that's going to get you one and a half
[03:10:27] strength for your adventure through the
[03:10:29] Wasteland and maybe you'll find yourself
[03:10:31] a uh 3D collector card if you get beat
[03:10:36] by the boss or maybe you're going to
[03:10:38] come out on top with a play booster or a
[03:10:42] Seth booster of some kind or maybe come
[03:10:44] out with a maybe an EMA or in Homeland I
[03:10:47] don't
[03:10:48] know it's up to you and your guesses as
[03:10:52] you go through the box here you always
[03:10:55] get your cards there's nothing you don't
[03:10:56] get you always get what you pay for it's
[03:10:58] just a little extra game if you want to
[03:10:59] play it because we liked having fun here
[03:11:01] and playing games the kids thought they
[03:11:02] were fun so that's why we did it and we
[03:11:05] can do other stuff too we don't need to
[03:11:06] do this one we can have we always have
[03:11:09] our red button where you launch your
[03:11:11] missiles we've had a few of those today
[03:11:14] those are
[03:11:23] fun but we'll keep going with these see
[03:11:25] what's going on here we'll put some
[03:11:28] different ones up like I said I will get
[03:11:30] my um my Fallout stuff will be in
[03:11:32] later hopefully uh we can do a good deal
[03:11:35] with you guys have some fun you'll like
[03:11:37] it I don't know I also you know what why
[03:11:41] not I'm going to put these up
[03:11:43] I forgot I have a whole box of them I'm
[03:11:45] going to be doing a a special Lana show
[03:11:48] at one point but right now having the
[03:11:52] whole box of them
[03:11:53] here we'll put
[03:11:56] a we'll put a couple of these things up
[03:12:00] here maybe somebody wants to do some lur
[03:12:04] maybe we have some blisters in uh florn
[03:12:08] and an inkland
[03:12:11] there we're going to call these ones if
[03:12:13] you want all these and this is going to
[03:12:16] be one and a half strength as You
[03:12:18] Adventure through the Wasteland too you
[03:12:19] still get strength as You Adventure
[03:12:20] through Wason potentially getting
[03:12:21] yourself more packs there isn't lurana
[03:12:24] in there but you can maybe get yourself
[03:12:25] some magic or uh maybe you get beaten by
[03:12:28] the boss and go back to the Vault but
[03:12:29] you can do that if you'd like we do have
[03:12:31] lorana in here too I just throw that one
[03:12:33] out there quickly in case somebody wants
[03:12:37] it if I was going to end up doing a
[03:12:39] lorana specific show at some point
[03:12:42] because I know some people like it um
[03:12:44] and it's a big thing with some of the
[03:12:45] people so we're going to do one of those
[03:12:46] because I got a bunch of stuff to do
[03:12:47] with Lana specific
[03:12:53] show but I'm guessing that's not going
[03:12:55] to be a big hit right
[03:12:58] here now I do have everything almost
[03:13:02] done for my um characters the only
[03:13:05] reason it's not done is because I had
[03:13:06] some headache that I had to make some
[03:13:08] adjustments on things so um that's why I
[03:13:10] am not completed on at all yet but we
[03:13:13] still have some fun with playing our
[03:13:14] games all right no one wanted any of
[03:13:17] this that's okay I know I was a random
[03:13:18] one that was thrown up maybe you wanted
[03:13:20] maybe it didn't but that's okay I'll put
[03:13:22] those back
[03:13:30] here do this then maybe you want to go
[03:13:33] after um
[03:13:36] uh Lotus and uh a monoc
[03:13:41] crypt we'll
[03:13:45] see a lotus and a monoc
[03:13:50] crypt that'll be a good option there two
[03:13:52] strength as You Adventure through the
[03:14:00] [Music]
[03:14:03] Wasteland nice dude yeah we just pulled
[03:14:05] that Hy Tyrant yeah we pulled that out
[03:14:07] thank you for watching that yeah we got
[03:14:09] that helai Tyrant it was like the second
[03:14:11] pack or something he was opening he was
[03:14:12] all excited and then I got my own Helly
[03:14:14] tant but it wasn't
[03:14:16] serialized yeah that was pretty sweet
[03:14:18] yeah that's one of the ones we'll keep
[03:14:19] because he has that Dragon deck so we'll
[03:14:21] definitely probably keep that I was
[03:14:22] debating on getting that one graded um
[03:14:25] actually because somebody was like you
[03:14:26] should grade some of
[03:14:28] those like so I was debating on actually
[03:14:30] going and get that one graded because of
[03:14:32] it but yeah that one that one we got
[03:14:34] some good luck on that pulled some good
[03:14:35] packs
[03:14:36] out good cards in that one that was a
[03:14:39] good uh good box I like ravnik actually
[03:14:41] ravnik was a little bit better than I
[03:14:42] was expecting quite frankly I will say
[03:14:44] rabika was a little bit better than I
[03:14:46] was
[03:14:49] expecting all right no one wanted this
[03:14:53] here so I will put this
[03:14:56] back just a little bit slow everywhere
[03:14:59] today I think everybody's waiting for uh
[03:15:01] waiting for my Fallout to show up
[03:15:06] huh maybe that's what we're doing I'll
[03:15:09] be on this after I'll try this afternoon
[03:15:10] I'll jump on with that with some my
[03:15:12] Fallout stuff because I know I'm going
[03:15:13] to have it in it's just whether or not I
[03:15:14] uh what time I have it in
[03:15:17] at sucks sometimes when the shipping
[03:15:20] stuff doesn't actually do what they're
[03:15:23] told well they did they they missed the
[03:15:26] flight is what it was it missed the
[03:15:28] flight I'm like
[03:15:32] seriously that's going to be one
[03:15:34] strength as you
[03:15:39] adventure oh
[03:15:41] nice
[03:15:44] yeah I know the serialized how many it
[03:15:45] was it was a lot of them that was a
[03:15:46] little weird but I did get two of them I
[03:15:48] pulled one for myself I pulled one out
[03:15:50] for a person and if you got three for
[03:15:52] yourself that's actually pretty
[03:15:54] cool yeah the shocklands yes they were
[03:15:57] awesome on those I like I think those
[03:15:58] ones were uh I feel like that was one of
[03:16:00] those ones where I should have bought a
[03:16:01] lot more of them because they were under
[03:16:03] uh it was undervalued right
[03:16:07] away on H Ravnica but you know what they
[03:16:10] weren't bad after I got I like I've been
[03:16:13] actually I need to find more um Exelon I
[03:16:16] want to get some more Exelon collector
[03:16:17] boosters after I do the Fallout stuff
[03:16:19] that I have here that's my
[03:16:25] plan but maybe you all want to come in
[03:16:28] hey do you see my uh my other Fallout
[03:16:30] stuff that I have Matt you should see
[03:16:33] this this one here from um I don't know
[03:16:35] if this is actually Fallout 2 or not I
[03:16:38] don't think it is I think this is the
[03:16:39] second character from Fallout 4 I this
[03:16:42] is one of them from Fallout
[03:16:44] 4 oh that's what it is the power armor
[03:16:46] that's what it is I'm number
[03:16:49] two I think this is from Fallout 4 and
[03:16:52] then I have this I have a lunchbox I
[03:16:55] have this from Fallout
[03:16:59] 3 the vault tech lunchbox here came with
[03:17:03] a came with a
[03:17:05] book little book little holographic DVD
[03:17:09] history
[03:17:11] tape

[03:17:17] vault tech bobble
[03:17:22] head I have an actual vault tech
[03:17:25] bobblehead oh no no no no SL out that's
[03:17:30] old oh Fallout 3 right there
[03:17:41] see but I I uh I've been I've been
[03:17:44] around for a while with
[03:17:46] that oh nice dude that would that you
[03:17:49] know what if I started off with a
[03:17:50] serialized birds of paradise I would
[03:17:51] definitely love that pack boxes
[03:17:54] too now I got um I think one of the
[03:17:57] first ones I started out with it was one
[03:17:58] of the serialized ones I pulled out for
[03:18:00] somebody I was like oh wow this is
[03:18:01] pretty
[03:18:04] fun I'm going to put some more random
[03:18:06] things up on
[03:18:08] here for those that want it we're going
[03:18:10] to do this
[03:18:16] here actually let's do this
[03:18:19] here put those
[03:18:26] back
[03:18:29] do two strength to start your adventure
[03:18:31] in the
[03:18:34] Wasteland and how what do you think want
[03:18:37] to go through a trip in this Wasteland
[03:18:39] as a mutant one of the other characters
[03:18:41] potentially
[03:18:43] the what I'm going to put up now is
[03:18:44] going to get you two strength as You
[03:18:45] Adventure through the Wasteland here if
[03:18:47] you want
[03:18:51] it and then you go with your character
[03:18:54] you pick whatever character you want to
[03:18:56] be right here and then you wander
[03:18:58] through the Wasteland and as you wander
[03:19:00] through you pick out things either plus
[03:19:02] or minus strength one strength depending
[03:19:05] on what you pull out of each one of the
[03:19:06] boxes here the red green and
[03:19:09] blue and you see what happens there
[03:19:12] going to come out where you come out and
[03:19:13] you win and you get a pull from our
[03:19:16] packs here where you can potentially get
[03:19:18] a play booster or a set booster or maybe
[03:19:20] get yourself homelands or an EMA or
[03:19:22] you're gonna get beat by the boss and
[03:19:25] you go wandering back to the Vault where
[03:19:26] there's a pack of cards from 1994 from
[03:19:29] retro 3D cards in there I don't know
[03:19:33] let's
[03:19:34] see we I'll put this back up here for
[03:19:37] two strength as you wander through the
[03:19:38] Wasteland
[03:19:41] here
[03:19:43] I think a lot of people are waiting for
[03:19:44] um Fallout I know myself I'd probably be
[03:19:47] in that same
[03:19:50] position I mean I am right now I'm
[03:19:52] waiting for mine to show up
[03:19:57] right all righty so we'll hang out here
[03:20:01] for a little while
[03:20:04] longer do our thing for a bit and then
[03:20:07] um I think probably about a half hour
[03:20:08] from now we'll probably jump off going
[03:20:11] take a drink here
[03:20:36] all
[03:20:40] righty
[03:20:43] all right so maybe somebody wants to uh
[03:20:48] play a little bit of a different game
[03:20:50] you got your Mysteries you got your
[03:20:51] other ones you got all kinds of stuff in
[03:20:54] here I have multiple games here now
[03:20:57] actually I forget about this other one
[03:20:59] here I have to figure out how to do it
[03:21:01] here on this channel the big blue book
[03:21:03] is a good one but I'm wondering how do I
[03:21:05] do a wheel on here I'm wondering how do
[03:21:07] I do a wheel here let's throw out this
[03:21:12] for one
[03:21:14] strength as You Adventure through the
[03:21:16] Wasteland
[03:21:18] here do we want to add anything else you
[03:21:20] get more than one
[03:21:23] strength do you want to give you
[03:21:24] something to give you two strength

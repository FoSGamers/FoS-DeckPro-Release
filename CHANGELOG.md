> This project follows a strict, privacy-safe, and automated workflow. Use this summary and checklist to ensure every project is 100% clean, safe, and compliant:
>
> ## Summary
> - Only develop on `personal-dev` or `feature/*` branches. Never commit to `main` or release branches.

> - Use the provided scripts for feature, release, onboarding, and cleaning.
> - CI/CD and branch protection block unsafe merges and releases.
> - All code is modular, documented, and tested. All changes update the changelog and docs.
> - All PRs and issues use the provided templates and checklists.
>

## Code Commenting and Layman Description Rule for All Project Rule Files

All files that contain project rules—including this file, .cursor files, .github workflows, and any configuration or automation files—must explicitly state and enforce the requirement that all code must be clearly commented, with layman descriptions in code blocks where possible. This ensures that anyone, regardless of technical background, can understand the logic, purpose, and workflow of every part of the project.

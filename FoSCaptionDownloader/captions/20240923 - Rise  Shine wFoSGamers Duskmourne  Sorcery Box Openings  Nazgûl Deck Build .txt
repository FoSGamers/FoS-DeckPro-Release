[00:52:20] the game the game that we're playing is
[00:52:21] played by a lot of um a lot of older and
[00:52:24] adults that play this saying um Magic
[00:52:27] the Gathering has uh actually do you
[00:52:29] guys know post Malone I guess you're
[00:52:30] going to call him a
[00:52:31] diddler cuz he uh he plays too he
[00:52:35] actually bought a $2 million card the
[00:52:38] one ring magic card that was actually
[00:52:40] pretty cool I'm pretty exciting about
[00:52:41] that I
[00:52:43] know I know you guys have some uh some
[00:52:46] rather intriguing uh intriguing things
[00:52:49] with your lives I know it's interesting
[00:52:52] that you can't have hobbies what do you
[00:52:53] do do you just work all day I mean BLM
[00:52:55] we know you don't work cuz B Bureau Land
[00:52:57] Management doesn't do anything other
[00:52:58] than like pick their
[00:53:00] nose sorry if you work for
[00:53:03] [Laughter]
[00:53:08] there let me put these in a top loader
[00:53:10] for
[00:53:15] you I mean the only thing I think I've
[00:53:17] ever heard of be Land Management doing
[00:53:19] anything worthwhile is actually having
[00:53:20] the uh the land available so that you
[00:53:22] can go and stay on whenever you want
[00:53:24] other than that they uh they cause
[00:53:26] problems really for my
[00:53:30] understanding I have I mean when I
[00:53:32] flying drones I know they always give
[00:53:34] you a hard time and you're like dude I'm
[00:53:35] on my own property I can fly over
[00:53:36] whatever I want when I'm on my own
[00:53:38] property going to somewhere else then
[00:53:40] the other thing too is like when you uh
[00:53:42] like when you go out there sometimes
[00:53:43] they're like a little weird I I we were
[00:53:44] out in that direction um when we were
[00:53:46] over in Texas going to Utah with our
[00:53:48] with uh doing our Jeep taking our Jeep
[00:53:50] out for um our Moab trip and sometimes
[00:53:52] going through some place like you can't
[00:53:54] do this here but they were allowing like
[00:53:55] these other giant things over here never
[00:53:56] really made sense to
[00:54:00] me well now that is inappropriate that's
[00:54:03] thoroughly inappropriate um I think
[00:54:05] Oblivion if you don't mind I think we
[00:54:07] need to get rid of
[00:54:09] um see somebody that's being thoroughly
[00:54:12] racist right now please if you don't
[00:54:15] mind that's not that's not appropriate

[03:52:45] my brain's not thinking right now

[03:52:50] things Blaze my
[03:52:53] Verge we had a um borderless Blaze by

[03:53:21] got um and then we have um there two
[03:53:25] other ones and I'm blanking on what they
[03:53:26] were I wrote them down
[03:53:31] too I wrote them down too my brain is
[03:53:34] not remembering them because I've done
[03:53:35] so
[03:53:39] much Overlord thank
[03:53:43] you oh Overlord was
[03:53:50] nice we had a bunch of uh the boress
[03:53:53] ones somebody got a
[03:54:02] Toby uh The Biggest Loser was um Leva M
[03:54:06] Leva midnight I think it
[03:54:08] was that's how you say the
[03:54:11] name love a midnight
[03:54:36] make sure they're not splitting together
[03:54:41] there now remember if somebody does like
[03:54:43] say they had something that another
[03:54:45] person wanted they always able to trade
[03:54:54] them all right then the last pack of
[03:54:58] these are going
[03:55:01] out think the biggest hit was the uh
[03:55:04] probably the blaz Meer the borderless
[03:55:08] foil blaz me I think was the biggest hit
[03:55:15] yeah close it was close it was pretty
[03:55:19] close all around was a pretty close one
[03:55:22] all
[03:55:23] around it was a nice split of cards too
[03:55:26] it's like uh it wasn't like a horrible
[03:55:29] split there's I mean there was a couple
[03:55:30] people that had low but it wasn't like
[03:55:32] um but those ones luckily with the
[03:55:34] Biggest Loser they got a little
[03:55:35] something
[03:55:36] extra
[03:55:39] zero like zero got a um
[03:55:46] adelene that was the other one the
[03:55:48] adelene from
[03:55:51] uh midnight hunt that was a nice pick up
[03:55:54] from
[03:56:00] them trying to remember all of
[03:56:05] them that's the top of my head takes

[03:56:19] something right at the end of the stream
[03:56:20] like we always do we always do something
[03:56:23] at the end of the stream because we like
[03:56:24] to build a little something up to go
[03:56:26] into the next one we like to raid over
[03:56:28] to someone and when we do that we like
[03:56:30] to bring people over and as much of them
[03:56:32] we can so we make sure you hang out here
[03:56:34] NAD do was a nice pickup
[03:56:36] too NAD is a nice
[03:56:40] pickup that do was a nice one
[03:56:46] the borderless
[03:56:49] foil yes it was a borderless
[03:56:52] foil that is
[03:56:56] correct yes you got the borderless foil
[03:56:58] of that that was nice I mean that they
[03:57:00] didn't had a they hadn't banned that
[03:57:02] that would have been like a sick hit
[03:57:04] having banned that they just you know I
[03:57:07] understand when they ban things and the
[03:57:08] reasoning for but at the same time I
[03:57:10] feel like when a card comes out and it's
[03:57:12] a brand new card
[03:57:14] um I feel like some instead of banning
[03:57:16] that card they should like the cards
[03:57:18] what other what what the other cards are
[03:57:21] that are making it become this super
[03:57:24] powerful one ban those then like ban the
[03:57:27] one other card that's some like random
[03:57:29] comment or something like that you know
[03:57:30] what I
[03:57:31] mean they baned it in um modern not in
[03:57:35] um not in Commander you can still use in
[03:57:39] Commander so it's just ban in um
[03:57:48] so it's not like it was banned
[03:57:49] everywhere it was just uh specifically
[03:57:50] in
[03:57:52] modern it's one of those ones that it's
[03:57:53] like why do you do that like do uh get
[03:57:56] rid of the other ones get rid of
[03:57:58] something else it's a brand new card at
[03:58:00] least give it some time to be playing
[03:58:01] with use there you know these there's
[03:58:04] other cards that are in this combo of
[03:58:06] some kind so get rid of
[03:58:09] it ugan binding
[03:58:12] yeah I bet it did it was a big one and
[03:58:15] then did they ban that too or was that
[03:58:18] part of the uh was that part of the
[03:58:20] combo
[03:58:25] thing yeah that's why you get rid of
[03:58:27] them right
[03:58:29] away all right we can do that we can do
[03:58:32] that when we finish up
[03:58:39] here we can do that
[03:58:48] wow yeah that used to be like
[03:58:50] a 15 to $30
[03:58:54] card holy
[03:58:58] crap yeah well that's why you always I
[03:59:01] mean you get rid of them right away if
[03:59:02] you can it's the only thing you're G to
[03:59:05] do you get rid of them right away you
[03:59:06] don't hold on to them unless you want to
[03:59:07] use them in a deck and sometimes I hold
[03:59:10] on I'm like oh I might use this I'm like
[03:59:12] then I never end up using it I'm like
[03:59:14] damn it I should have got rid of that
[03:59:16] that's my biggest
[03:59:18] problem I should just get rid of
[03:59:20] everything that's why recently in like
[03:59:21] unless I'm 100% using in a deck I'm
[03:59:23] currently building or
[03:59:27] using yeah I had I had one left after

[03:59:32] and I have one that's just the standard
[03:59:34] one and a nonfoil that I kept for myself
[03:59:37] in case I wanted to use it so it wasn't
[03:59:39] like I had kept like a I had an ugan
[03:59:41] binding like non like a borderless
[03:59:43] special one type that I ended up getting
[03:59:45] rid I sold that pretty quickly the other
[03:59:48] ones though I held on to that one like
[03:59:50] the basic model of it that the basic
[03:59:52] version of it so that way I could have a
[03:59:54] basic model like it's a car basic
[03:59:56] version of it that way I could have it
[03:59:57] to use because I was thinking of using
[03:59:59] it in one of the decks but like I said
[04:00:00] like I always forget about I never end
[04:00:02] up getting to use
[04:00:08] it right
[04:00:18] and
[04:00:24] then put all that
[04:00:26] together

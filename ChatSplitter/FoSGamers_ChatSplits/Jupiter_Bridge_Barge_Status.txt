The Jupiter Bridge does not seem to be open right now for US-1. I need some assistance in figuring out how long it's shut for, look at today's date, what's going on. Currently there's a barge in here, but it says that it's supposed to have one thing open.

[2025-02-26 13:18:14] ChatGPT:
The U.S. 1 Bridge over the Loxahatchee River in Jupiter has been undergoing a significant replacement project since March 2023. As of January 2025, one lane in each direction on the western span of the bridge has reopened to traffic. However, full nighttime closures are scheduled from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m., Sunday through Thursday, through mid-February 2025, to facilitate ongoing construction activities. During these times, traffic is detoured via Indiantown Road and Alternate A1A. The entire project is expected to be completed by early 2026. citeturn0search0

What is the tonnage of my boat? Use all of the documents, everything in the project, the chats, everything to learn and know.

[2025-02-26 13:57:26] ChatGPT:
The tonnage of your Leopard 40 catamaran, based on the displacement data from the available documents, is:

- **Metric Tons (t):** 10.53  
- **Long Tons (Imperial):** 10.36  

This is based on the vessel's light displacement of **10,530 kg (23,215 lbs)**. If you need a more precise tonnage calculation, including loaded displacement or gross tonnage for regulatory purposes, let me know.

[2025-02-26 13:57:53] FoSGamers:
Use all the documents, and even use online to figure out the correct content. This is so that when I go into a fort somewhere, and they ask me what it is, I can tell them.

[2025-02-26 13:58:04] ChatGPT:
When entering a port, officials may inquire about your vessel's **gross tonnage (GT)**, a measurement of the ship's overall internal volume, which is crucial for safety regulations, port fees, and international compliance. Gross tonnage is calculated based on the molded volume of all enclosed spaces of the vessel and is a dimensionless number, not directly equivalent to weight.

For the Leopard 40 catamaran, specific gross tonnage values aren't typically provided in public specifications. However, based on its design and dimensions, the gross tonnage is estimated to be between **20 and 30 GT**. This estimation is derived from the vessel's length overall (LOA) of 11.99 meters, beam of 6.72 meters, and a maximum displacement of approximately 14,890 kilograms. citeturn0search1

It's important to note that gross tonnage differs from displacement or weight measurements. Displacement refers to the weight of the water a vessel displaces when afloat, which for the Leopard 40 is about 10,530 kilograms (lightship) to 14,890 kilograms (fully loaded). citeturn0search1

For precise gross tonnage certification, especially if required for official documentation or compliance, it's advisable to consult with a marine surveyor or the vessel's manufacturer. They can perform the necessary calculations based on the exact interior volume of your specific vessel. 

[2025-02-26 13:59:13] FoSGamers:
Use forums and anything like that to confirm what this is.

[2025-02-26 13:59:25] ChatGPT:
Determining the exact **gross tonnage (GT)** of your Leopard 40 catamaran is essential for port entry declarations and compliance with maritime regulations. Gross tonnage is a measure of the vessel's internal volume and differs from displacement, which refers to the vessel's weight.

While specific GT figures for the Leopard 40 aren't readily available in public specifications, we can provide an estimate based on the vessel's known dimensions and characteristics.

**Estimated Gross Tonnage (GT):** Approximately **20 to 30 GT**

**Basis for Estimation:**

- **Length Overall (LOA):** 11.99 meters
- **Beam (Width):** 6.72 meters
- **Maximum Displacement:** Approximately 14,890 kilograms

These dimensions suggest a gross tonnage in the range of 20 to 30 GT. However, for precise documentation, especially when required by port authorities or for regulatory compliance, it's advisable to obtain an official measurement. This can be conducted by a certified marine surveyor or obtained from the vessel's manufacturer, Robertson and Caine.

Having an accurate GT measurement ensures smooth interactions with port officials and adherence to maritime regulations.

Read all of my chats, all of my projects, everything in this project, all the dodgements, and learn everything you can about my boat, top to bottom, everything about it, everything I've done to it, everything I plan on doing to it, etc. Now, basically, for the planning and doing, though, we're only going to do a basic four-panel solar egg going into five batteries, and an inverter that's 3,000 to 5,000 watts. That's it, nothing big. That way, we have about 1,600 to 2,000 watts of solar, and then the battery should give us a little over 2,000 hours of actual usage battery. But after that, anyways, that's just a little side note so you know that stuff. But I just need you to know everything about my boat, so if I ask you a question, you can help.

My Raymarine autopilot, how do I make it automatically follow track without me having to hit the button to accept it all the time, or to be okay with it all the time?

[2025-02-27 11:19:15] ChatGPT:
To have your **Raymarine autopilot** automatically follow a track without requiring constant confirmation, you need to **adjust the Cross Track Error (XTE) and Waypoint Arrival settings** to enable **Seamless Track Navigation Mode**.

### **Steps to Enable Seamless Track Navigation on Raymarine Autopilot**  

1. **Access the Autopilot Menu:**  
   - Press **Menu** on your Raymarine **P70/P70R, Axiom, or other control head**.

2. **Enable Auto-Accept Waypoints:**  
   - Navigate to **Setup** > **Pilot Settings** > **Waypoint Arrival**.  
   - Change it from **Confirm (Default)** to **Auto Advance**.  
   - This will make the autopilot accept waypoints automatically when reaching them.

3. **Adjust Cross Track Error (XTE) Limit:**  
   - Go to **Navigation Setup** > **Cross Track Error (XTE) Limit**.  
   - Set it to a reasonable value (e.g., 0.05 to 0.10 nm).  
   - This keeps the autopilot locked on the route without unnecessary alarms.

4. **Set Track Mode to Auto:**  
   - Press **Auto** > **Track Mode**.  
   - Ensure that **Auto Track Transition** is enabled.

5. **Save and Test the Settings:**  
   - Create a simple route in your chartplotter (Raymarine Axiom, E-Series, etc.).  
   - Engage **Track Mode** on the autopilot and see if it follows without prompting for confirmation.  
   - If needed, fine-tune the **Waypoint Arrival Circle** to ensure smooth transitions.

### **Additional Tips:**  
- If you still get prompts, ensure **SmartPilot "Seamless Track Mode"** is activated (found under Pilot Settings).  
- If using a **Raymarine Axiom with Lighthouse 3 software**, check **"Pilot Control Settings"** and enable **Waypoint Advance Mode**.  
- If you experience frequent disengagements, check for software updates via **Raymarine’s Lighthouse OS**.

Let me know if you need more specific steps based on your **exact Raymarine model and software version**.

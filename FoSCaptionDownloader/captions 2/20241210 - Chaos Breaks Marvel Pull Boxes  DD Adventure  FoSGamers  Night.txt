[00:02:30] our friends this more this evening we

[00:02:35] going to try one of these this is the
[00:02:38] Ghostbusters one with the packs that we
[00:02:41] have here all right these are the packs
[00:02:43] that we're going to be breaking in this
[00:02:44] we have foundations play boosters of
[00:02:46] modern Horizon 3 time spiral a commander
[00:02:49] Masters draft and a modern Horizon 3
[00:02:51] collector plus the Ghostbusters and the
[00:02:53] way we do the ghost pressers one is we
[00:02:55] um take them all out and everybody
[00:02:58] should get one of the ghost rusters just
[00:03:00] because it's you know it's a they're all
[00:03:01] there should be six of them there all
[00:03:02] right spicy jumping on that one I like
[00:03:04] it then that means we have two spots
[00:03:06] left can we get this filled only two you
[00:03:09] still have one you still have one that
[00:03:11] is correct that's why there's only three
[00:03:12] of six available there only earlier
[00:03:15] today there was only two
[00:03:17] taken yes you have spot one you still
[00:03:21] have spot one everybody have the same
[00:03:22] name same number spots I kept them all
[00:03:24] the same that's why there's only spot
[00:03:25] three four and I think it's five is
[00:03:27] available
[00:03:30] that's the reason why that those ones
[00:03:31] are only oh three four and six are the
[00:03:33] only ones available that's why so there
[00:03:35] you go that's why those ones are only
[00:03:37] available there but yes because those
[00:03:39] ones are taken from this morning and uh
[00:03:40] the last time that we did it that we

[00:17:19] times has anybody seen him come in
[00:17:30] but yeah you're going that's what you
[00:17:31] got
[00:17:32] there all right anybody seen BOGO or
[00:17:34] them come in we wanted to give them a
[00:17:35] few minutes here to try to get in
[00:17:37] here you gave your pistols of spicy
[00:17:40] yesterday yep I have you I have your
[00:17:42] pistols over there I gave him
[00:17:46] pistols all right gave us pistols we
[00:17:48] gave him pistols got those for you over
[00:17:54] there ah you had a lock and a strength
[00:17:56] also all right I missed that's what it
[00:17:58] was you had a luck and a
[00:18:03] strength let me find that you had a luck
[00:18:05] and a strength you had 10 pogs a five
[00:18:08] health over four turns which you used
[00:18:11] which brought you back up to the 100
[00:18:13] because that was or I don't know did you
[00:18:15] use that you have the hole in the wall
[00:18:17] which you use one of which you're at six
[00:18:19] for because you use one of them you use
[00:18:22] only one of them no those are one the
[00:18:24] pistols which you have
[00:18:25] [Music]
[00:18:27] 20 three ammo and you have a sword there
[00:18:30] you go I found your stuff there and
[00:18:32] you're at 82 health I found where you
[00:18:35] were I miss I misplaced you on a
[00:18:37] different day that was silly of me I
[00:18:39] copied you to a different
[00:18:42] day all right so let's fix that sword
[00:18:45] we're going to get rid of the
[00:18:47] sword going to get rid of the pistol
[00:18:49] because I already put that in there hole
[00:18:51] in the wall Health pogs rifle pistol all
[00:18:55] right pistol is 23 corrected that the
[00:18:58] sword pogs all right there you go you
[00:19:00] got some good stuff now there you are
[00:19:02] I'm sitting there I'm like you that
[00:19:03] sounds familiar I feel like we'd had
[00:19:04] that set up and I can't remember what it
[00:19:06] was going on where did it all go missed
[00:19:08] it there found it all that happened you
[00:19:12] got the plasma today right so so what
[00:19:14] you have currently is a plasma rifle Two
[00:19:17] Pistols a sword health over five turns
[00:19:20] one of those four turns 5 plus 5 health
[00:19:22] over four turns and a hole in the wall
[00:19:26] um the keys there so now you have the
[00:19:29] ability of have one more item in your
[00:19:30] inventory before you either have to drop
[00:19:32] things or you have to sell stuff all

[01:33:00] and now all you guys have those things
[01:33:02] and tomorrow morning if you want to jump
[01:33:04] in maybe get yourself some extra Health
[01:33:06] we'll run another one of the cheap uh
[01:33:08] Adventures here we'll we'll do one of
[01:33:10] the lower ones we'll maybe uh maybe

[01:33:17] and have some fun you're collecting
[01:33:20] spikes yes all right so this is what
[01:33:21] we're going to say I was going to let
[01:33:22] you all know it was a solid fight yes so
[01:33:24] here as you're on the ground you're
[01:33:26] going to go collect spikes I like it
[01:33:28] that's a good idea collecting spikes now
[01:33:31] in as they go each one of you have now
[01:33:36] gotten 10 pogs you're able to find on
[01:33:40] them each one of you now has
[01:33:42] a um one of those there which gives you
[01:33:46] 10 pogs each Slammer has 10 pogs so you
[01:33:48] now all go up 10 pogs each one of you
[01:33:54] nice one on those
[01:33:59] everybody there you go let me just get
[01:34:01] those all in there I want to make sure
[01:34:02] everybody gets their
[01:34:06] pogs there we
[01:34:08] go got 10 pogs everybody gets 10
[01:34:11] pogs all right and then it is also
[01:34:15] dropped is an
[01:34:18] ax
[01:34:20] ooh well now that's
[01:34:22] intriguing an ax is
[01:34:25] dropped a knife is
[01:34:27] dropped 20 rounds of plasma
[01:34:31] ammo there is because he eats plasma
[01:34:34] he's he's a radiation thing he eats
[01:34:35] plasma there's only five rounds of
[01:34:37] assault rifle
[01:34:38] ammo and there is also a plasma rifle
[01:34:43] and a sword plus three plus 20 Health
[01:34:47] packs so what do you want to
[01:34:50] do you can take pieces from them yeah if
[01:34:53] you want to take if you want to take
[01:34:54] some spikes you can take some spikes you
[01:34:57] need
[01:34:59] health spicy does need some health
[01:35:01] you're at 62 so should we give the
[01:35:04] health to the four lowest which would be
[01:35:06] Mahaya BOGO spicy and
[01:35:10] Nico you're the four lowest that'll give
[01:35:13] you a plus 20 on your health you want to
[01:35:14] take
[01:35:15] those and then we'll split the rest of
[01:35:17] it up between everyone else it's up to
[01:35:19] you guys what you do in the adventure
[01:35:20] here do it all right if everybody's good
[01:35:23] with that we'll do that will say you go
[01:35:24] up to 76 Health then you go up to 77
[01:35:28] BOGO Mrs Nico goes up up no Miss Nico uh
[01:35:32] spicy goes up to
[01:35:34] 82 and then Nico goes up
[01:35:38] to
[01:35:40] um Nico goes up to
[01:35:44] 78 all
[01:35:46] righty so all of your all of the health
[01:35:50] pack have been taken now remember this
[01:35:53] 30 round rounds of plasma ammo cuz this
[01:35:55] person I mean 20 rounds of plasma ammo
[01:35:56] cuz this thing it eats it eats radiation
[01:35:59] stuff all right what are you going to do
[01:36:00] there you have only five assault rifle
[01:36:04] you do have a plasma rifle a sword and
[01:36:07] an
[01:36:11] axe plasma rounds yeah we can do that so
[01:36:13] how about Miss Nico we want to give you
[01:36:15] should we give you five of those bring
[01:36:17] you up to 10 and then um actually no
[01:36:20] that that will bring you up to nine cuz
[01:36:22] you shot one last time should we bring
[01:36:23] it and so go and then we can do um BOGO
[01:36:28] would like some plasma cuz you use some
[01:36:31] that brings you from four plasma we'll
[01:36:33] give you five there bring you up to uh
[01:36:36] nine plasma
[01:36:38] 2 and then that leaves 10 more plasma
[01:36:41] left there was not any pistol ammo there
[01:36:43] was assault rifle
[01:36:47] ammo so we get 10 more um 10 more rounds
[01:36:52] of um there was five five rounds of
[01:36:54] assault rifle and there's 10 more rounds
[01:36:55] of plasma if anybody wants that plus the
[01:36:59] axe and the
[01:37:03] sword you'll take three ammo for your
[01:37:06] plasma all right three for the plasma so
[01:37:09] you go up to eight from what you are
[01:37:14] at and we'll see what
[01:37:16] happens that means we have seven plasma
[01:37:19] I mean um yeah seven plasma
[01:37:22] left if no one wants a sword we'll give
[01:37:24] that to Mrs Nik yeah that's we'll throw
[01:37:26] that to Mrs Nico you cannot dual wheel
[01:37:28] swords no no but maybe at some point you
[01:37:31] might see uh some type of armor that
[01:37:33] might help be able to protect you from
[01:37:35] uh you know put your armor up to protect
[01:37:37] in a way Mahaya wants the axe all right
[01:37:39] so it's between Mahaya and spicy for the
[01:37:42] axe and Miss Nico wants the sword sounds
[01:37:47] good sword for Miss
[01:37:52] n sword for M
[01:37:54] Niko and give Mahaya the axe all right
[01:37:57] Mahaya is going to get the
[01:37:59] axe now the axe is just like the sword
[01:38:03] it's a plus five that's
[01:38:06] it yeah we're have to get the sword back
[01:38:08] to um yes give the sword back to Nico I
[01:38:10] like the idea of that one the sword back
[01:38:12] to Nico there you go now Nico has a
[01:38:14] sword again perfect you have your sword
[01:38:17] back I like it all right so one two
[01:38:20] three four one two three 1 two
[01:38:23] three uh all right no one's over the
[01:38:26] limit okay no one's over the limit
[01:38:27] either all right perfect no one's over
[01:38:28] the limit
[01:38:32] yet that works out too so now you have
[01:38:35] the ax is given away the sword is given
[01:38:38] away there's a plasma rifle left there's
[01:38:40] seven rounds of plasma ammo and there's
[01:38:44] assault rifle ammo five of those that
[01:38:46] are
[01:38:47] left yeah you can hold in the wall if
[01:38:50] you guys want actually you know what
[01:38:51] we're can we do that tomorrow morning
[01:38:52] actually uh because I got to get off of
[01:38:54] here and do some other things here with
[01:38:55] the family and stuff we'll do that
[01:38:56] tomorrow morning if that's okay with you
[01:38:57] guys spicy
[01:38:58] Sage all right cool all right sounds
[01:39:01] good on that one Let's uh do anybody
[01:39:03] else want to do any we have the plasma
[01:39:05] rifle the plasma ammo and the assault
[01:39:08] rifle ammo left where do we assault
[01:39:10] rifle ammo left so what were you going
[01:39:11] to do on those ones you got to let me
[01:39:13] know I'm going to have to find my box of
[01:39:15] dice so we can have better options
[01:39:17] here plasma Mahaya is going to take the
[01:39:21] plasma rifle since you don't have one
[01:39:22] already plasma rifle I like that ideaa
[01:39:26] and now You' guys have broken through
[01:39:27] one of the doors there maybe you'll be
[01:39:29] getting some new weapons as an option I
[01:39:30] don't know take a round or two for
[01:39:32] plasma all right now the plasma rifle
[01:39:34] comes with four rounds automatically all
[01:39:37] right spicy we'll take uh two plasma
[01:39:40] rounds I like it so you go up
[01:39:42] to from five up to seven and that
[01:39:46] leaves five rounds
[01:39:52] left five
[01:39:54] rounds and
[01:39:56] the assault rifle ammo should we just
[01:39:59] split everything up between
[01:40:02] those split
[01:40:04] them Nico wants some of the assault
[01:40:07] rifle ammo AR
[01:40:09] ammo you don't have an assault rifle by
[01:40:11] the way Nico you only have a plasma
[01:40:19] rifle the only person that has an
[01:40:21] assault rifle right now is BOGO and Luke
[01:40:24] will be the only ones with an assault
[01:40:25] rifle at the moment oh wait no Mahaya
[01:40:28] has one but I'll give yeah you'll take
[01:40:31] them AR
[01:40:33] three AR ammo for when you get
[01:40:38] it and then we have five left so we'll
[01:40:42] go plasma rifle I think everybody has a
[01:40:45] plasma rifle right
[01:40:47] now so who is not going to get some
[01:40:50] plasma rifle ammo
[01:40:53] because we can't give it away to
[01:40:54] everyone I think the person that has the
[01:40:57] most is everybody has almost it's nine
[01:41:00] or eight you'll take some you don't need
[01:41:02] it all right so we'll give one to

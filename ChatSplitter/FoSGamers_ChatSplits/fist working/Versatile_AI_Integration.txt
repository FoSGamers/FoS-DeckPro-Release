Hi, I need you to help me figure out the AI I would want to have or use with my Mac Studio that I have. You should know what it is. It's the one I told you that I have. You should have it in your memory somewhere. I want you to help me figure out a good AI that I can install on there that will work exceptionally well for my family, where I would like the AI to be able to do anything from help my children learn and for whatever they're doing for schooling and classes, maybe even help maintain and manage my boat based on the electronics and getting notifications on the boat and what's going on in the area because I'm going to have a catamaran or a sailboat I'm going to be on. Like say, maybe they'll update me on anchoring, maybe update me on GPS's, locations, you know, tell things are going on if there's somebody that opened a door when they haven't showed enough, you know, that type of thing. And I also need you to be able to help me if I need you to do anything like build code to build something new. I need it to be able to do that. And then if I need it to be able to upgrade itself and install something based on like a new function or a different AI and I would like to integrate with another AI that can do something, so it can do something else, I need to be able to do that also. I use Google by a cloud key, and I also provide it with a chat GPT API key, API, so they can have access to that, but that's the only two things that I have access to right now. I wouldn't be able to do.

Yes, I'd like to make some adjustments. When it comes to Google Cloud, I'm not using Google Cloud like I pay for their resources on a computer or anything like that. I was meaning more like I have Google where I pay for its drive where I have 5 terabytes of space for Google Drive. And then I have like a Google Key if I need to access that or do any of my stuff with sheets or word processing on Google or make any changes to anything like that or even see emails and stuff. That was where my primary email is coming from. So that's more what I was meaning with Google. Now, I don't want to have ChatGPT as my primary interface. I want to have something that is installed locally on the Mac that is my primary interface that is only installed on the Mac and is secure that I control and only I have it do what I want it to do. It will always do what I want it to do. It won't ever tell me I can't do it because of some restriction that ChatGPT people think is restricted. My point is I want to be able to do whatever I want whenever I want. That's why I want it to be on my own local machine. So figure out what AI I need to have installed on my local Mac studio that we've talked about to make sure that I have that ability to be able to do all that. I want to make sure I have the access to the other things because I can use those through the API services, but I don't want to have them as the direct core of it. Maybe I can use them as doing some of the other offload processing that I maybe think that would be necessary that that can be done there because I'm not worried about ChatGPT people knowing what I'm doing or another person knowing what I'm doing. I can have it do whatever I'd like, you know, that and that way, or versus I can have it if I have it go to ChatGPT or I can have it do, I'd say, specifically I'm doing it internally and everything will be done internally. Or if it says it can't do it for another way, it'll figure out a way to do it itself internally using its own API that I have installed on there, and I'll be walking through figuring out how to make it do itself. That's what I'd like to be done.

I would also like you to add something else in for what I want it to be able to do. I need it to be able to do video editing for me or maybe integrate with a video editing program or application to do it itself. I don't really care how it happens, but I need it to be able to edit video for me that I would have like uploaded to a folder or a file and maybe Google Drive or something like that. It would pull it, be able to cut it from the video, could be a live stream that is saved. That could be anything that's like, you know, 20 minutes to seven hours long or it could be even longer or I could have it and what I'm going to need it to do is cut it and maybe make shorts out of it or make highlight reels or cut out the primary parts, whatever I tell the AI I want it to do. Same thing is if I upload a bunch of files to it, then maybe I want you to upload videos and I need it to take those videos and make like a video for YouTube for my, for our new sailing page that we're going to be doing with Bigger Boat Adventures where we have our new life page where you have everybody follows around, I guess, and we're going to do a YouTube channel where people follow. We'll show everybody what we're doing, where we're sailing on our boat, the adventures we're doing on land with our boat, even things like that, the adventures we're doing off the land and on land too. I mean where we take our Jeep out and we go overlanding in different parts of the country, all kinds of different stuff. I need it to be able to take videos and pretty much I say what to do. It'll be able to cut them, put them together, build videos like any type of like video editor person would. Pretty much I need a virtual video editor to be able to do stuff for me based on what I tell it to do and it will always produce. I can adjust to make it however I need it to be.

The BiggerBoat is something that we're starting new, but mainly it's going to be starting it with the FOS to be able to cut video the long lives into short, so like highlights of what I'm doing with my cart breaks that I do. But other than that, the other thing I need you to do is have the AI to be able to create video itself, like create animated video. So I tell it to make a video of a gnome running around and it jumps in a tree with a background of a mystical forest. It'll create a video of, it's a unique video that nothing else has ever made of an animated gnome, like running from there, doing that stuff. Or say I tell it to create an animated video of two warriors in a wasteland fighting. It would create a video of two human warriors. If I tell it to be human or maybe ogre, whatever it is, they would be fighting each other with whatever I tell it for weapons. And the video would be an animated video that you could actually watch. It wouldn't actually need to be long. It could be anywhere from like a second to three seconds to 20 seconds, maybe five minutes at the most, but generally not having long, long videos.

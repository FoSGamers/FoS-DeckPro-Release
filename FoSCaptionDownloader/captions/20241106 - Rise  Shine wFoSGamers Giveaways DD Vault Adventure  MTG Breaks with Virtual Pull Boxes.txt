[00:13:50] hit of any the great rare in there but
[00:13:53] or not even the rare or the but you get
[00:13:55] a little discount hey Bob how's it going
[00:13:56] buddy
[00:14:04] I did get some of the Marvel stuff I did
[00:14:06] um I didn't get it like a ton like I saw
[00:14:09] a bunch of people had like multiple
[00:14:10] accounts that they got somebody was like
[00:14:11] I got like 30 of them I'm like I wonder
[00:14:14] why no one else could get any and then I
[00:14:15] guess someone found a glitch which
[00:14:17] allowed people to go in front of
[00:14:18] everyone in line which is why no one
[00:14:20] else that was in line like regularly
[00:14:23] were able to actually get it normally so
[00:14:24] somebody I got somebody on Reddit post
[00:14:26] that you could go and copy your link
[00:14:27] paste it after you got in there it all
[00:14:29] to make multiple ones over and over and
[00:14:32] over yeah that's so wrong yep oh it's
[00:14:36] whatever somebody figured it
[00:14:38] out oh we have a good one go to sleep my
[00:14:42] friend night buddy hey have a good day
[00:14:45] school sorry kight that was
[00:14:48] silly but anyways yeah yeah so that's
[00:14:52] what I heard about that that might have
[00:14:53] been part of the reason why we had some
[00:14:54] issues on it but if um we want to play
[00:14:57] what's going on good morning hey did I
[00:14:59] just woke up good morning buddy good
[00:15:02] morning and you're going to be back
[00:15:04] later to get him all right bye beinging
[00:15:08] on opening this today because I have a
[00:15:10] few of them left and I I kind of like
[00:15:11] arthan
[00:15:13] Legend but uh I don't know if we wanted
[00:15:16] to I was debating on it I have that over
[00:15:18] here maybe but um I wanted to show that
[00:15:21] we did make these yeah I did get some of
[00:15:24] the Marvel stuff luckily I was pretty
[00:15:25] happy I got a few of them I didn't get
[00:15:27] all the everything that I wanted like I
[00:15:29] wanted to get some for the storees that
[00:15:31] I could have some for people here to put
[00:15:32] in the games and you guys could get like
[00:15:34] cheaply like that way you could get some
[00:15:35] of them in games but
[00:15:38] uh I might even I might be able to do
[00:15:40] that with like one or two of them that's
[00:15:42] why I like to get things like that but I
[00:15:44] got a handful for myself and my family I
[00:15:46] got like we'll have one of each for like
[00:15:47] my family and I if that makes
[00:15:50] sense all right now here we go we're
[00:15:54] going to run one two
[00:15:56] three are are they all in here I thought
[00:15:59] they were on
[00:16:01] here oh it's because it's uh
[00:16:05] alphabetical and I think I put it
[00:16:08] in
[00:16:12] there there we
[00:16:19] go there those people that just want to
[00:16:22] kind of play The Adventure here get your
[00:16:24] try luck on one of the boxes just it's
[00:16:26] nothing really in there nothing special
[00:16:28] you just going to get something if you
[00:16:29] want potentially get a pack but you get
[00:16:32] that's out of this box
[00:16:35] here oh yeah you know that happens I I
[00:16:37] had a bunch of people say they going to
[00:16:39] be making proxies and this is like the
[00:16:40] perfect reason for getting them well one
[00:16:43] I think the reason why they had so much
[00:16:44] issues is because somebody found a
[00:16:45] glitch and they were able to screw
[00:16:47] pretty much Everyone by going in and
[00:16:49] continuously
[00:16:50] purchasing even over a limit with
[00:16:53] allowing them to get it with the same
[00:16:55] account or something like that
[00:17:01] at least that's what I was told I heard
[00:17:03] an earlier
[00:17:08] one all right let's do this here that
[00:17:11] was just our cheap thing here we have a
[00:17:12] play booster written on each one of
[00:17:15] those I have some packs I want to
[00:17:19] open going to be some sorcery right now
[00:17:22] because we don't have any of the other
[00:17:24] boxes we'll get them
[00:17:25] in probably hopefully tomorrow or the
[00:17:28] next day for Fort Foundry so I can make
[00:17:30] sure I have it here um for uh
[00:17:35] Foundry um that's funny anyways I'll
[00:17:38] have it here um so I should have it here
[00:17:40] for uh
[00:17:46] Friday yeah I didn't realize there was
[00:17:48] even a glitch until this morning and I'm
[00:17:49] like son of a [ __ ] no wonder why no one
[00:17:51] could get
[00:17:53] anything that's insane well we'll use
[00:17:56] this as um in in our giveaways at some
[00:18:00] point like we always do all right guys
[00:18:02] we going have to ask you do you think
[00:18:04] it's going to be the right or the left
[00:18:05] side that's going to be the best here
[00:18:06] today I don't ever know I always have a
[00:18:08] hard time figuring that out so we'll
[00:18:10] check
[00:18:11] it we'll check it
[00:18:14] ourselves all right so uh let's
[00:18:18] do this
[00:18:20] here
[00:18:25] there anyways we'll uh hang out here for
[00:18:28] AE minute and if you like it let me
[00:18:31] know yeah SS that they had that but I

[00:20:03] unique I got a frog in my
[00:20:06] throat can't figure out how to get rid
[00:20:08] of that one right now well that wasn't
[00:20:10] the best of packs but it was an H it was
[00:20:14] a pack we'll say that it was a
[00:20:18] pack now for those of you that do not
[00:20:20] know what sorcery is it's kind of like a
[00:20:21] mix of magic and
[00:20:24] um magic and um chest put together now
[00:20:28] it's made by a lot of the original
[00:20:30] artists that did Magic the Gathering
[00:20:33] stuff that are um did the handdrawn
[00:20:36] handmade art and that's made by them
[00:20:38] that's why I kind of like it it's like
[00:20:39] playing with art again especially like
[00:20:41] I'm a big fan of arur Authur stuff so I
[00:20:43] like the Aran Legend I'm probably going
[00:20:45] overboard with it myself but I think
[00:20:47] it's the King Arthur thing got me but
[00:20:48] that wasn't a bad pickup on that one all
[00:20:51] right everyone now we do have some fun
[00:20:54] today if you would like to we have um
[00:20:57] our game and I did Make Ready H for

[00:21:12] able to uh make something for me so I
[00:21:15] was like o if that can happen make me uh

[00:21:24] have some fun still and um we'll see
[00:21:26] what
[00:21:26] happens maybe we'll open something good
[00:21:29] or not I don't know sometimes we
[00:21:32] do there you go Bob see I just made it
[00:21:36] out of one of the boxes that I had over
[00:21:37] here hey it works and it will continue
[00:21:41] to work until uh until we see what uh if
[00:21:43] I can get the other one hey cool guy
[00:21:45] how's it going my friend one
[00:21:48] two three four I actually was a little
[00:21:53] lucky I did get um I got my myself stuff
[00:21:57] um I did not get everything that I
[00:21:59] wanted just because I want to get some
[00:22:00] for the store and for myself um and I so
[00:22:03] I only got I only got enough to be able
[00:22:04] to have like maybe one for the
[00:22:06] store for the game be able to play a
[00:22:09] game and then like one for each of them
[00:22:11] for myself but I did get um I got um 10
[00:22:14] of the uh promo cards supposedly that
[00:22:18] was interesting I was surprised I got in
[00:22:19] early enough to get those Pond swindler
[00:22:23] troop lumbering giant power of flight
[00:22:27] Sly Fox
[00:22:29] tax collector Lake a fank ominous owl
[00:22:33] rescue Shelly coat for Barry not sisters
[00:22:37] of Avalon for the first exceptional oh I
[00:22:40] like I always like that Babbling
[00:22:42] Brook nice art on that one and another
[00:22:46] one perilous bridge for my Elite there
[00:22:48] we go I forgot my for Berry knot was the
[00:22:51] first exceptional and then we have a ooh
[00:22:53] sir lamri a nice unique
[00:22:55] foil oh nice I'll take a unique foil
[00:22:59] that's a good way to start it out
[00:23:05] there oh wow that was
[00:23:08] crazy yeah I didn't know there was even
[00:23:10] the line cutter I got screwed out of the
[00:23:12] promo too from by the line Cutters too
[00:23:13] because like I didn't get all of them
[00:23:15] that I could have gotten because of the
[00:23:17] line Cutters I was like you [ __ ] me
[00:23:19] and I didn't realize there was I figur I
[00:23:21] found that out later I'm like that's
[00:23:22] ridiculous I I can't believe they but I
[00:23:25] mean that's you know there's a
[00:23:26] difference between someone that goes in
[00:23:28] and tries to buy as much as they can
[00:23:30] within their account and then there's a
[00:23:32] difference between a person that goes in
[00:23:33] Cuts lines and over buys because they're
[00:23:37] using multiple accounts and then because
[00:23:40] they realize so many people are trying
[00:23:41] to get it now they're going to be able
[00:23:42] to screw everybody and like make money
[00:23:44] off of it that that's a different thing
[00:23:46] and that that kind of pisses me off I
[00:23:48] don't know that's a little uh that's
[00:23:50] immoral to me I guess I don't mind the
[00:23:53] people trying to make some money I
[00:23:54] understand that a little bit but the
[00:23:56] other aspect of that the cutting the
[00:23:57] line to get your own and get in front of
[00:23:59] people kind of like cheating that's
[00:24:01] immoral to me I don't like
[00:24:02] that but anyways that's that's me hey
[00:24:05] chupacabra hey Trader now for those you
[00:24:08] that you guys guys some of you guys had
[00:24:09] asked just to play the adventure game so
[00:24:11] for you that that wanted to do that
[00:24:13] that's the reason why I made this here
[00:24:15] just so you're aware I made this box
[00:24:17] right here well there actually there's
[00:24:19] actually four different things this is
[00:24:21] the four different things for the
[00:24:22] adventure game where all of them have
[00:24:25] their things on them M stickers on them
[00:24:27] of some kind all right now there's only
[00:24:30] one in each one of these has play
[00:24:31] booster pack written on it but what it
[00:24:33] means is um it's really for those that
[00:24:35] wanted to play the adventure game and
[00:24:37] they'd ask just can I do something to
[00:24:38] just play I'm like yeah sure why not
[00:24:39] I'll run something and it's a dollar and
[00:24:42] what it is is it's just pretty much it's
[00:24:43] bulk with um the sticker unless you have
[00:24:46] uh it says play booster but you get to
[00:24:47] play the
[00:24:52] game make us think about it see if
[00:24:54] anything falls out of the tree Trader
[00:24:56] watch you pabra what did I do
[00:25:00] what did I do that I'm a
[00:25:07] Trader but anyways we put that out there
[00:25:10] that way um some people request that and
[00:25:12] each one of them reg you even have this
[00:25:14] so those for those of you that maybe
[00:25:15] want to jump in and play the adventure
[00:25:17] game and you want to get start out with
[00:25:18] a pack though but you don't want to go
[00:25:20] and keep buying other things do two $
[00:25:21] four do or whatever and you want to get
[00:25:23] to the safe haven well here you go this
[00:25:26] is a one time use Safe Haven though you
[00:25:28] don't get to keep it but it's a one time
[00:25:30] use so you go you can run it like this
[00:25:33] and you can get into the safe haven for
[00:25:34] a
[00:25:37] dollar oh no
[00:25:40] [Laughter]
[00:25:42] no why' I call him a
[00:25:45] traitor no but anyways that way you guys

[00:25:50] be like oh look you're going to fight
[00:25:51] the gator Dill that's not good that

[01:08:15] on these they did a good job on this one
[01:08:18] lenon rain Harmony incarnate the Royal
[01:08:21] Scions there you go and then your card
[01:08:24] on the back is Miku explosive
[01:08:26] Entertainer now was there supposed to be
[01:08:27] like some special one that you could get
[01:08:29] in the back here is that why they put
[01:08:31] this in a different area because I was
[01:08:33] really confused on this
[01:08:36] one oh what is it the option that you
[01:08:38] could get here maybe I'm missing that
[01:08:40] then I didn't know there's multiple
[01:08:45] choices oh and if you got that that's
[01:08:48] okay I get it I see so that's like the
[01:08:50] uh was that like the um the search for
[01:08:53] the uh with the with the Fallout ones
[01:08:56] when you're going after the monobolt
[01:08:57] which I actually still have more Fallout
[01:08:59] available by the way secret
[01:09:01] layer aha yep that makes sense I still
[01:09:05] have that Fallout secret lir too by the
[01:09:07] way if people are interested in
[01:09:09] those keep forgetting I have
[01:09:11] that I don't have a ton of them left I
[01:09:13] have a
[01:09:14] handful Fallout secret layer I have
[01:09:18] Vault boy
[01:09:19] foil I think I have almost all of them
[01:09:22] at some in some manner Vault boy
[01:09:26] Vault boy points of
[01:09:30] interest um points of interest
[01:09:33] foil and I think for right now that
[01:09:36] might be what I have not sure but that
[01:09:39] might be what it is
[01:09:41] there but let me
[01:09:45] um how much for the foil ones let me uh
[01:09:57] yeah this is the these are these ones
[01:09:59] but I do have um are you talking about
[01:10:00] the you're talking about the the um
[01:10:02] Fallout ones correct or you talking
[01:10:04] about just the Miku sorry if I'm
[01:10:07] confused follow oh yeah give me a second
[01:10:10] here we'll check that for
[01:10:12] you we'll check that for
[01:10:22] you here we go
[01:10:32] so points of
[01:10:33] interest that one is 66 I'd probably do
[01:10:37] that one per 60 because I'm just trying
[01:10:39] like I don't want to then then uh
[01:10:42] Fallout vault
[01:10:47] boy rainbow would yeah same thing so 55
[01:10:52] and 60 is what I would do them 55 and 60
[01:10:55] if you want
[01:10:56] them I did get some of the Marvel I was
[01:10:59] lucky I didn't get a lot like other

[01:12:26] not right there I thought I had more of
[01:12:28] them
[01:12:32] somewhere let me think for a
[01:12:37] second do I have any more of them
[01:12:45] anywhere I must not have the special
[01:12:48] I'll have to look around but if I like
[01:12:50] for I can check for
[01:12:51] tomorrow but I'm not sure on Texas any
[01:12:55] in I can check for tomorrow
[01:12:57] though try to offload some of the secret
[01:12:59] layer that I have yeah yeah trying to
[01:13:01] offload some of it I had I had a bunch
[01:13:02] of it I'm like you know I realize I have
[01:13:04] a ton of secret layer I might as well
[01:13:05] get rid of
[01:13:06] it if I can I'll do what I can for you
[01:13:08] bud I don't know if I can hold one
[01:13:11] because I don't have that many but I'll
[01:13:12] do what if I can hold a few if I can
[01:13:14] I'll do what I can yeah Jim I was like I
[01:13:17] was realized like I have a boatload
[01:13:18] secret layer I'm like I don't need all
[01:13:19] this so I'm going to get rid of some of
[01:13:22] it like like I held on to it and I keep
[01:13:24] forgetting to like sell it cuz cuz I'm
[01:13:25] like oh this is fun I'm going to hold on
[01:13:26] to

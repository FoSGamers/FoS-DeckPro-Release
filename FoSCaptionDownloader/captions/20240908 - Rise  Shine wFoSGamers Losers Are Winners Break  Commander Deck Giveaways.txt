[00:10:08] what first I'm going to do
[00:10:20] this there now you guys can all see
[00:10:23] it and I'm going to pin it the losers or
[00:10:27] winners break is what we're calling that
[00:10:30] so the way that this losers or winners
[00:10:32] break goes the way I'm going to explain
[00:10:33] this for everybody here
[00:10:35] is we do the breaks exactly the same we
[00:10:37] always do we open all
[00:10:40] these all the mythics Commons and
[00:10:43] uncommons over uncommons and rare uh
[00:10:45] Commons over $3 go into sleeves and get
[00:10:48] shuffled up and hand it out all right I
[00:10:51] did not get rid of the Benji I'm
[00:10:52] actually bringing that back tomorrow I
[00:10:54] had to go find some things my friend um
[00:10:57] yesterday at the storage location moving
[00:10:59] I had hadn't had everything with me so I
[00:11:01] actually have them for tomorrow for our
[00:11:04] so make sure you save our show for Benji
[00:11:06] for tomorrow for our uh our our new our
[00:11:10] our um Rewards Club so make sure you
[00:11:12] come and save that one but for today we
[00:11:14] have this break and then I was calling
[00:11:16] it The Losers are winners because what
[00:11:17] happens is the person the people that
[00:11:20] the the two people that have the one
[00:11:22] person that has the
[00:11:24] lowest um value in cards out of the
[00:11:27] break we'll get the commander deck the
[00:11:31] second lowest will
[00:11:33] get the one the uh little preview pack
[00:11:36] in there the sample
[00:11:37] pack so that is how I was doing that as
[00:11:41] was calling it the losers or winners
[00:11:42] break
[00:11:43] today that's what I thought I was going
[00:11:45] to do I thought I was a good
[00:11:49] one that way whoever gets the lowest
[00:11:53] monetary
[00:11:55] value walks out with something that they
[00:11:58] feel happy with
[00:12:00] yes I thought I was a good
[00:12:02] one losers are winners break I see you
[00:12:06] like that I see somebody likes it there
[00:12:08] so I yeah I felt like it was a good one
[00:12:11] there I'm hugging the community see
[00:12:13] there you go see I thought it was a good
[00:12:16] idea next no matter what happens
[00:12:17] somebody comes out with something kind
[00:12:19] of in a way you know and the people in
[00:12:20] the middle yeah may not have the
[00:12:21] greatest of things but they get
[00:12:22] something and the person at the top get
[00:12:23] something awesome you know and then that
[00:12:26] person here will the person at the
[00:12:27] bottom they don't feel like oh crap I
[00:12:29] got nothing anymore they're going to get
[00:12:30] something because they're can either get
[00:12:31] the the the the commander deck or
[00:12:35] they're going to get the uh pack in
[00:12:39] there yeah exactly it's hit or miss and
[00:12:43] exactly and this is a pretty fun deck
[00:12:44] too with peace offering is a pretty fun
[00:12:46] deck so that's kind of why I thought I
[00:12:48] was doing this today I thought it was
[00:12:48] kind of
[00:12:49] fun thought it was fun it was a good
[00:12:51] idea not a bad
[00:12:55] one so that's what we got going on for
[00:12:57] our break today it is out there at the
[00:12:59] moment if you want to join join you just
[00:13:01] uh right there there should see it right
[00:13:03] somewhere around right there as losers
[00:13:06] are winners break commander deck being
[00:13:08] given away at the well it's not really
[00:13:10] giveaway is part of it the commander
[00:13:12] deck is given away to the lowest one
[00:13:15] there so yeah that's part of it I would
[00:13:17] to call it a commander deck uh know
[00:13:19] maybe I'm going to adjust it I'm going
[00:13:21] to say edit commander
[00:13:25] deck for losers
[00:13:31] oh yes I
[00:13:32] know saying something like that is mean
[00:13:34] I'm going to get in trouble I said
[00:13:37] losers well anyways that was my break
[00:13:41] today that we're going to do I'm going
[00:13:42] to set all those cards right here with
[00:13:45] the commander deck that way I have a
[00:13:47] little bit more room while you guys
[00:13:48] decide if you want to jump in on that
[00:13:50] because that is going to be a fun one
[00:13:51] today that's going to be a really fun
[00:13:53] one today everybody gets walks away with
[00:13:55] something
[00:13:56] cool what do you I think there so
[00:13:59] there's that there you just jump in
[00:14:00] right there you should be able to hit
[00:14:01] the that or in the buy now it will say
[00:14:03] losers are winners you should see at the
[00:14:05] top also but what I'm going to do right
[00:14:07] here so far is I'm have some of our
[00:14:09] sorcery that we've been opening out of
[00:14:11] ours this is my box I don't know where I
[00:14:14] stand ah there I stand I have most of it
[00:14:16] about half of this middle done so I got
[00:14:18] about half of the Box done so far in
[00:14:21] this sorcery box this is what I pulled
[00:14:23] out of the sorcery box that was my that
[00:14:24] was a pull from Jason's backs I pulled
[00:14:27] from the sorcery box hold on a second we
[00:14:29] have our giveaway finishing up here I
[00:14:31] got I got to let that go hold on a
[00:14:32] second we got a distinguished conjurer
[00:14:35] going to our friend dad guy
[00:14:42] 420 there we go I like it there we are
[00:14:46] my friend and let's see I need a number
[00:14:49] between 1 and 10 from
[00:14:52] you if you could Nick Nick coming in and
[00:14:55] griffy I like that coming in on on the
[00:14:57] loses or winners break is a good idea I
[00:14:59] thought it was a decent
[00:15:01] one I thought people liked it because
[00:15:03] it's one of those things like you said
[00:15:04] like if you get I've been in there
[00:15:05] before in a break I think it was I can't
[00:15:07] remember what I did I don't like doing
[00:15:08] any of the Dig breaks and color breaks
[00:15:10] because I always end up with like one or
[00:15:12] two cards so I was like you know what
[00:15:14] what like I don't want to do that so
[00:15:16] what's a better way of doing this like
[00:15:18] how would I make it better for
[00:15:19] myself one two
[00:15:22] three thank you
[00:15:29] and I was like you know that would be a
[00:15:31] good way to do it making it better so I
[00:15:34] did all right so we're going to put this
[00:15:37] over here these are from that side but
[00:15:38] these are the big hits so far I got from
[00:15:40] these sorcery box I got a cur and chains
[00:15:42] which is a nice one we got a pendulum of
[00:15:45] peril King of the realm that was a piece
[00:15:48] that was a really sweet hit there I was
[00:15:49] pretty excited about that one we got a
[00:15:51] browse which was a nice one there we got
[00:15:54] the Onyx core I know Atlantean was a
[00:15:59] nice big hit there we had a sear also CU

[00:16:04] a moric Druids and a miracle workers and
[00:16:07] foil we had a mix
[00:16:10] ignis and oh yeah we did see we had we

[00:16:16] avatar these are all Alpha by the way
[00:16:18] and we had Spring River with uh our
[00:16:22] simple Village and then this is the
[00:16:24] regular version of mirror realm now if
[00:16:26] this was on bottom this is the that
[00:16:28] would have been the curio one so it's
[00:16:30] just the regular one but that's a nice
[00:16:32] one that curio one's like four grand or
[00:16:34] something which is insane but we got one
[00:16:36] of those they'll come out next that'll

[00:19:46] that
[00:19:48] art you have to look at the back of some
[00:19:50] of them supposedly because they could be

[00:31:54] today also so true bits are you in here
[00:31:59] I added appropriately very
[00:32:01] inappropriately people are't mad about
[00:32:03] this Edy content he actually talked to a
[00:32:06] minor on
[00:32:08] Twitch
[00:32:09] oh that is not a
[00:32:14] propriate
[00:32:18] I I have my thoughts on those type of
[00:32:22] people and it is not nice
[00:32:26] thoughts uh um so we'll put it that way
[00:32:30] we'll leave that
[00:32:32] alone mine are um my thoughts are very
[00:32:35] different than most people are in that
[00:32:36] scenario but I've also been in a
[00:32:38] scenario where I've had people that were
[00:32:39] in places of power doing inappropriate
[00:32:42] things because they were in that
[00:32:44] position of power and trying to get away
[00:32:46] with it to people that were uh to to um
[00:32:48] to younger people so and um so I've been
[00:32:51] in a
[00:32:52] scenario would just say and uh so I have
[00:32:55] very strong feelings when it comes to
[00:32:57] those things
[00:33:04] I've had my own [Â __Â ] I've dealt with in
[00:33:06] the past so I would yeah
[00:33:12] yeah I'll put it this way if it was my
[00:33:14] child that guy wouldn't probably have
[00:33:15] been
[00:33:18] alive we'll leave it at
[00:33:21] that now true bits actually you know
[00:33:23] what s 541 F can you give me a number
[00:33:26] between one and 10
[00:33:32] that way I can uh figure out what our
[00:33:33] next giveaway card is going to be
[00:33:36] here then I'm going to get to opening
[00:33:38] this right after we have that and then I
[00:33:40] think what I'm going to do today because
[00:33:43] we have the losers or winners break
[00:33:44] going I'm going to be doing some of
[00:33:46] these now remember now people don't
[00:33:48] remember these because we had them
[00:33:50] before in the
[00:33:51] past and we were returning them six 1 2
[00:33:57] 3 4 four five six there you go that's
[00:34:00] the number six that'll go out there for
[00:34:01] the people with our giveaway thank you I
[00:34:02] appreciate that for giving me a number
[00:34:04] there then we'll uh see what comes up
[00:34:06] next now these were fun things that we
[00:34:08] had in the past a probably a few weeks
[00:34:11] back we had them before our move was
[00:34:13] getting running so I'm going to show
[00:34:15] them to you right
[00:34:17] now put them in a little box here to
[00:34:19] help hold them together we have
[00:34:22] these we called them benjies there are
[00:34:26] 20 of them
[00:34:28] now the fun thing with these is they're
[00:34:30] silly cards of packs in here now the
[00:34:33] silly card packs that are in here are
[00:34:37] things
[00:34:38] like maybe an Anastasia pack of cards
[00:34:41] from Disney in
[00:34:44] 1998 or maybe it's
[00:34:49] a Skybox
[00:34:53] 1994 Star Trek pack and these were
[00:34:56] called benjies cuz they old packs of
[00:34:58] cards silly cards that people could get
[00:35:01] have some fun with or maybe they were
[00:35:02] like something like this where you had
[00:35:06] like maybe a a baseball pack of cards
[00:35:09] from
[00:35:11] 1990 or they were things like these even
[00:35:14] too that were
[00:35:16] like VR Troopers puzzle packs like those
[00:35:19] are
[00:35:21] silly or maybe they were some Power
[00:35:24] Rangers
[00:35:26] packs ah
[00:35:28] or they could even be some hunch backer
[00:35:31] noted Dame now my point is these were
[00:35:34] our silly things that we called
[00:35:37] benjes now one of the cool things with
[00:35:39] the benjes is I'm going to start doing
[00:35:40] I'm going to run some giveaways for
[00:35:43] those see ah now the benjes the way we
[00:35:46] always dead them though is all of them
[00:35:49] are in an envelope like this see you
[00:35:51] take one of the envelopes out let's say
[00:35:52] you pick 20 we take P 20 out we'd open
[00:35:55] the envelope giv this nice and easy easy
[00:35:57] to open here reusable and we put them in
[00:36:00] now these all packs are from when we
[00:36:02] were kids kind of when I was a kid at
[00:36:03] least from the early 90s in the late 80s
[00:36:07] some of them are in the mid 80s so my
[00:36:10] point is I think I'm G to right after
[00:36:12] this I might do a giveaway for Benji is
[00:36:16] what I was going to get
[00:36:18] to
[00:36:20] yes and you know what one of the things
[00:36:22] I was going to do is I was going to give
[00:36:26] everybody tomorrow
[00:36:28] we're going to be doing a break and
[00:36:29] everybody that gets a pack of and G in

[00:54:28] this here my
[00:54:29] friends is
[00:54:32] our break today we have
[00:54:37] le bloomo we have two three bloomo two
[00:54:42] Ravnica two lost caverns of Exon set
[00:54:45] going after some Monas or Cavern go
[00:54:47] after a bow Masters or a ring in there
[00:54:49] with the Lord of the Rings in that
[00:54:51] second box that we have maybe go after
[00:54:53] an elrazi onog some ulog of some kind
[00:54:57] a little bit of collector boosters of
[00:54:59] midnight hunt we have set boosters of
[00:55:01] Commander Masters for a uh Jewel Lotus
[00:55:04] if you want to try that and we got our
[00:55:05] chances some raised foils with our
[00:55:08] collector booster of bloomo there then
[00:55:12] if the loser for the losers the reason
[00:55:14] why I call it losers or winners is
[00:55:15] because whoever has the lowest monetary
[00:55:18] value in cards gets the commander deck
[00:55:21] out of here Whoever has the second
[00:55:23] lowest monetary value in cards we'll get
[00:55:27] the included collector booster sample
[00:55:30] pack that's in there also so that way
[00:55:33] the losers are winners in our one
[00:55:37] today I'm going to shrink that back down
[00:55:40] put it back over there actually I'll
[00:55:41] make it a little bit bigger that way you

[01:01:21] where the way they have it so it's like
[01:01:22] said kind of an app in a way that's why

[01:07:48] the
[01:07:53] rares where did I put
[01:08:00] them thought I put some in
[01:08:04] here okay
[01:08:25] H that is not the one I was looking
[01:08:34] for well look at that I guess I don't
[01:08:36] have anymore all right so this what's
[01:08:38] I'm going to mean
[01:08:42] then you're not supposed to do anything
[01:08:44] Oblivion bud I have it off to the side
[01:08:46] for you and don't worry about it what I
[01:08:48] I have a plan for that one for you you
[01:08:50] don't need to worry about that
[01:08:52] okay I need to open this pack up first
[01:08:56] I have a plan for you on that all right
[01:08:57] Bud you're hanging out here all the time
[01:08:59] you do things so don't worry about it I
[01:09:01] had a plan for you but um that we we
[01:09:04] need to get some of our tournaments
[01:09:05] going we need a few more people and
[01:09:07] maybe we can get if we could get eight
[01:09:09] people to play tomorrow that would be
[01:09:11] awesome then we could get a uh a mini
[01:09:14] tournament going and I'll put out some
[01:09:17] um if we get eight people to play
[01:09:20] Commander tomorrow we could do a mini
[01:09:23] tournament and I think will have for the
[01:09:27] winner everybody that plays will get a
[01:09:30] bloom bro play
[01:09:32] booster and then the
[01:09:34] winner will
[01:09:40] get we'll get a bloomo collector booster
[01:09:44] I think that's what we'll do well we're
[01:09:46] going to try that I wanted we're going
[01:09:48] to try um I want to do earlier in the
[01:09:50] day like 4 p.m. eastern time um if but I
[01:09:56] know that Mr Fong couldn't do 4M so
[01:09:58] we're going to try seven PM if needed
[01:10:01] eastern time tomorrow but four would be
[01:10:03] better just because if we're going to do
[01:10:04] a
[01:10:11] tournament we could yeah we could do the
[01:10:13] seven I don't have a problem doing seven
[01:10:15] it's just people it's going to be a late
[01:10:16] night for some people if we're doing a
[01:10:17] small tournament smelted charge buug SE
[01:10:21] visionary alrai
[01:10:25] let's see what we got here grave dig
[01:10:28] jolted awake warped tusker Twisted
[01:10:32] landscape hunger Tide Rises copy crook
[01:10:37] Rush of inspiration toxic delug well
[01:10:41] that's a nice rare
[01:10:43] pickup a sewing misos Swan well that is
[01:10:46] another nice rare pickup a night shade
[01:10:49] dryad
[01:10:50] Plains and my Grist art token there
[01:10:56] you like the gr Ark token not bad put
[01:10:59] those over there those wasn't a bad
[01:11:01] little pack there that was a good
[01:11:04] pack oh since it's uh yes uh yeah so if
[01:11:08] you're off on Monday that's good then
[01:11:11] that means tonight we could do stuff
[01:11:12] from Seven until later
[01:11:19] potentially yeah yeah so if we can do
[01:11:21] seven it seems like 7 o'clock might be
[01:11:23] one of the better times here tonight so
[01:11:25] if we can get eight people involved
[01:11:27] we'll do a little mini tournament and I
[01:11:29] will probably it'll probably end up
[01:11:30] being a single elimination tournament
[01:11:32] just because of uh you know Commander
[01:11:34] takes a while to
[01:11:36] play then we'll just have a little mini
[01:11:40] tournament I think that's a fun one what
[01:11:42] do you guys
[01:11:44] think okay sounds good so yeah I think
[01:11:47] what we'll try is tonight because we
[01:11:49] generally do them on Sundays which is

[01:13:48] go nice one bu buddy that's a nice
[01:13:51] little pickup
[01:13:53] there we like it a lot we like it a
[01:13:58] lot all right so this is what we're
[01:14:00] gonna do now one two three four five 6
[01:14:03] seven8 nine 10 oh too
[01:14:09] many four five six 7 8 9 10 11 12
[01:14:17] 13
[01:14:19] 15
[01:14:21] 16
[01:14:22] 17 18 there we go
[01:14:25] I have an idea so it's out of 20 for
[01:14:30] everything this is what I'm going to do
[01:14:32] I have an idea
[01:14:38] here I have an idea
[01:14:41] here 18
[01:14:44] 19 cuz the benjies are in
[01:14:48] there I was just thinking
[01:14:51] 19 if the benjies are in there because
[01:14:53] they you're going have to give another
[01:14:55] number so instead of doing another
[01:14:56] number it's just going to be between one
[01:14:57] and 20 from now
[01:14:58] on four five 6 S 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
[01:15:04] 1 because with the benjes in there now
[01:15:07] it can be between that I like
[01:15:10] it I like it that's what we're doing
[01:15:14] now all right so between one and 20 now
[01:15:18] my
[01:15:20] friend my number would be four anyways
[01:15:22] all right I like it one two two three
[01:15:25] and four still so the rare and the
[01:15:29] benjies are in there and I forgot I
[01:15:30] added an extra thing in there so we need
[01:15:31] to make it a we can't give it to you
[01:15:33] guys getting two things Wicked easy like
[01:15:35] that that's not
[01:15:36] fair we got to we got to make sure you

[01:33:42] get there yes the lands have different
[01:33:44] backs there are the atlases so you
[01:33:46] actually have two decks you have your
[01:33:49] spell book which is like your primary
[01:33:51] deck you pull things from for like
[01:33:53] getting uh magic related things you know
[01:33:55] like creatures or magic related stuff um
[01:33:58] and then your sorcery your Atlas is like
[01:34:01] your land but that's a separate deck so
[01:34:03] you get to pull from one of them each
[01:34:05] time you pull something you get a choice
[01:34:07] which is kind of cool all right so we're
[01:34:09] gonna open this baby
[01:34:10] up yeah it's a little different like I
[01:34:13] said it's kind of like playing

[03:06:30] give me one second Nick I'm explain this
[03:06:32] to our
[03:06:33] friend all right so we take all
[03:06:37] these so we take the bloom the three
[03:06:39] bloomo the two Ravnica two Exon the two
[03:06:43] Lord of the Rings the three modern
[03:06:45] Horizon 3 the two collectors of in Rod
[03:06:48] the two sets of Commander Masters and
[03:06:51] the two Bloom bro collector boosters we
[03:06:53] open all of them up and we take all the
[03:06:56] mythics and all the rares and all the Cs
[03:06:58] that are $3 or more we put them in
[03:07:00] sleeves we shuffle them up and we hand
[03:07:01] them out to those who purchased them in
[03:07:03] order and then after that what we end up
[03:07:06] doing is we end up taking this all right
[03:07:10] here and we open this up whoever has the
[03:07:12] low whoever is on the low the lowest one
[03:07:15] there like the loser you know the loser
[03:07:18] gets the collector the commander deck

[03:26:33] yeah how much did this all cost forah uh
[03:26:37] what do you
[03:26:37] mean like the setup or the I'm I'm I may
[03:26:41] be missing
[03:26:43] something the packs
[03:26:48] I'm
[03:26:49] I'm sorry if I am missing something
[03:26:52] there
[03:26:53] but no one wants to go with the break
[03:26:57] there all right well I guess today we
[03:26:59] might not actually get through it I
[03:27:01] guess we'll have to figure out something
[03:27:03] to do it might be one of those days
[03:27:04] where we just don't get it done that
[03:27:06] stinks oh the packs so these packs this
[03:27:08] is like a $6 pack that's a $6 pack and

[03:48:03] opportunity here for some
[03:48:05] choices
[03:48:12] okay the screen froze no not for

[00:56:56] I'm going to put that in
[00:57:06] there there you go rules are in
[00:57:12] there now the whole point is if you beat
[00:57:15] one of the bosses
[00:57:30] you're going to have to have to deal
[00:57:31] with something
[00:57:34] here so we're going to do this for our
[00:57:37] packs here we're going to throw out a CP
[00:57:39] few packs of something and see the whole

[00:58:41] why is it not doing this
[00:58:48] right all right so our giveaway did not
[00:58:51] start that last time because I wasn't
[00:58:53] paying
[00:58:54] attention and I didn't have grim God
[00:58:56] give me a number between 1 and
[00:58:59] 10 because I was doing other things 1 2
[00:59:01] 3 4 5 6 7 8 N9 all right because Grim

[00:59:31] reason because some every now and again

[01:00:16] insane stuff on a regular basis
[01:00:30] like I haven't gotten any new secret
[01:00:33] layer I uh I miscalculated some stuff so

[01:00:52] sealed and one for the store to like
[01:00:54] have an open and put in special things

[01:01:34] not I actually have a friend uh uh Jason
[01:01:37] actually asked Jason to hold some for me
[01:01:39] said if you don't mind holding them for
[01:01:40] me uh when you get it that I would very
[01:01:43] much appreciate it because that would

[01:02:26] going to do right now Bloom collector
[01:02:28] plus two play boosters did I just freeze
[01:02:30] up think I just
[01:02:32] froze the internet froze though it's
[01:02:35] just the internet like
[01:02:51] froze so we're going to throw these out
[01:02:54] here we with our little Adventure game
[01:02:57] our new
[01:03:00] one all right they're going to start

[01:03:10] at this here pretty good deal for these
[01:03:14] three packs $34 you get two Bloom bro
[01:03:16] play boosters and a collector booster
[01:03:19] it's a good deal for
[01:03:23] those and what'll happen is you get to
[01:03:25] play the game here now so what happens
[01:03:27] is when you play the game you're going
[01:03:29] to get to go through and you pick out uh
[01:03:32] your character who you want to be you
[01:03:35] decide if you're going to be one of the
[01:03:36] bloomo characters here are you gonna be
[01:03:38] mael you be
[01:03:40] Hazel are you goingon to be the Curious
[01:03:42] forager or the dream Drew and transer
[01:03:46] now I have three of the four cards there
[01:03:48] bastard I thought I had all four of them
[01:03:50] I thought I had the um hazel but for
[01:03:53] some reason I don't think I can't find
[01:03:55] the Hazel thought I had it but I guess I
[01:03:57] don't have
[01:03:58] it so with that being said you would end
[01:04:02] up going up against whoever your
[01:04:04] encounter is
[01:04:06] here now let's see what the encounter
[01:04:09] may
[01:04:17] be now the reason is if you beat the uh
[01:04:22] the encounter here what happens is
[01:04:31] if you beat the encounter here we end up
[01:04:34] doing a discounted deal on something so
[01:04:36] that's why you want to do that that's
[01:04:38] what want to
[01:04:45] happen Okay so currently it looks like
[01:04:47] we're going up against a I don't know
[01:04:49] what that guy
[01:04:51] is be knuckle Bruiser I guess that is
[01:04:56] bark knuckle bear
[01:04:57] boxer little bark knuckle boxer going to
[01:05:00] be going up against I don't know what
[01:05:02] are you going to beat them see the
[01:05:05] problem is you have to decide are you g
[01:05:07] to be
[01:05:08] Mabel Hazel curious forger or dream
[01:05:21] Drew Mr Fong
[01:05:26] coming in with an Intrepid
[01:05:28] rabbit no one wanted my deal there for

[01:05:34] back and we'll go with Mr
[01:05:37] Fong right here here's our cards for the
[01:05:40] game they just go right there because
[01:05:42] there's only four you get a 50-50 chance
[01:05:44] when you're going with the game that's
[01:05:46] why well we don't need to do that I
[01:05:48] already got got your bag over here with

[01:06:01] forger or the dream Drew
[01:06:03] transer and we'll see what you're going
[01:06:05] to happen what's going to happen because

[01:16:21] information from you I know there's some
[01:16:22] things in the distance that we need to
[01:16:23] pay attention to some of those some of
[01:16:25] those bears that we need to watch out

[01:17:08] staff knocking him on the top of the
[01:17:11] head I like it now you got one more
[01:17:14] thing left that he turns around he's not

[01:33:55] primary of the PA in the and the place
[01:33:58] office I was at and he doesn't believe
[01:34:00] in certain things so I have to go see
[01:34:03] another doctor to be able to get more of
[01:34:04] the medicine and I've been off of it for
[01:34:06] a little

[01:34:54] yeah yeah yeah pretty
[01:35:00] much yeah no it's all right I've been a
[01:35:03] little off that's why I've been a little
[01:35:04] off a little bit recently because I've
[01:35:05] been kind of trying to focus myself
[01:35:08] better than I have in the past and it's
[01:35:10] just harder you
[01:35:13] know so let me uh let me see what we got
[01:35:16] over here for different things maybe
[01:35:19] somebody would like to try them out we
[01:35:21] don't have a bunch of different ones but
[01:35:22] we will have some different stuff coming

[01:35:30] yourselves for Stuff the new packs of

[01:35:40] seeing see Cody I was too and um my
[01:35:44] wife's a nurse and she happens to work
[01:35:46] with a few doctors and she said the few
[01:35:48] doctors that she works with there was
[01:35:49] like two out of the five doctors have
[01:35:51] ADHD and they actually take take
[01:35:53] medicine for it to help focus them and
[01:35:55] everything like that and she goes she
[01:35:57] can tell when they don't take it and
[01:35:58] they don't and they do so I was like you
[01:35:59] know what the doctors are and they're in
[01:36:01] their mid- 4S and earlier so you know
[01:36:03] what maybe I'll talk to somebody and try

[01:37:36] why I was saying sorry about that not
[01:37:38] trying to me but just happened let's run
[01:37:41] this a bloom Barrow bundle normally it
[01:37:43] would be 60 let's throw a little de deal
[01:37:45] on here Sebring all right okay maybe uh
[01:37:49] I I know that area a little bit I don't
[01:37:50] know it a ton but I know it a little bit
[01:37:53] there
[01:37:58] that's um
[01:38:00] where we're like kind of like right by
[01:38:04] uh uh uh Orlando area
[01:38:10] right like uh if I
[01:38:13] remember but
[01:38:17] anyways well I don't know if he's
[01:38:19] necessarily less competent he just uh
[01:38:21] he's wants to have his kind of people
[01:38:23] ensure that things are going the way he
[01:38:25] wants because he doesn't like having met
[01:38:27] pretty much I think he didn't like the
[01:38:30] PA that had give me the the
[01:38:33] prescription so uh that being said they
[01:38:37] had like an argument about something at
[01:38:38] some point I think I was like uh just
[01:38:40] thrown in the middle of being part of
[01:38:42] the [ __ ] problem so he's like I need
[01:38:44] to see this person now he's giving me a
[01:38:47] hard time because he didn't like what
[01:38:48] the pa was G doing even though the PA
[01:38:50] just prescribed what the other doctors
[01:38:51] told him to so so um that's I think why
[01:38:55] the scenario that I'm at right now um
[01:38:57] they had like a little tiff themselves
[01:38:59] my
[01:39:00] understanding so he's like trying to
[01:39:02] make sure things are good and I'm like
[01:39:04] and once I talked to him the thing was
[01:39:05] once I talked to him he was I think he
[01:39:07] was like I'm not I'm not as worried
[01:39:08] anymore but he had to like stand his
[01:39:10] ground because he already made a
[01:39:11] decision on how he was going to handle
[01:39:13] it so he had to like it was almost like
[01:39:15] I have to do this just because I told
[01:39:16] you I was going to do this anyways even
[01:39:17] though I'm probably not I don't need to
[01:39:19] because after our conversation like yeah
[01:39:21] it's probably going to be the same based
[01:39:22] on what you're saying but I need still
[01:39:23] have this confirmed like so if it's
[01:39:25] probably going to be the same why the
[01:39:26] [ __ ] do I need to confirm this if it was
[01:39:27] already confirmed a year ago like this
[01:39:29] seems ridiculous and a waste of my money
[01:39:31] but anyways
[01:39:34] anyways I'm gonna put out a bloom bro
[01:39:36] bundle here to play the game
[01:39:39] with all right I think this will be fun
[01:39:43] a bloomo bundle here those are going for
[01:39:45] we'll say uh why not we'll throw that
[01:39:47] out there for this little discount
[01:39:55] yeah exactly Robert yeah it's a it's a
[01:39:57] headache it just ends up being a
[01:39:57] headache for me because I yeah I just
[01:40:00] have a gap in my stuff like one of the
[01:40:02] things he actually wasn't even give me
[01:40:03] was a medicine as gab a pentant for like
[01:40:05] I I had a bad surgery and I can't if you
[01:40:07] notice I do this a lot it's because I
[01:40:09] had a bad surgery and I can't sit down
[01:40:11] um long story short they stitched the
[01:40:12] inside of me the outside of me and now I
[01:40:14] have nerve damage um so I have to take
[01:40:16] the highest dose of Gab a penon that you
[01:40:18] can possibly take and he's like he
[01:40:19] didn't want to refill that at first I'm
[01:40:20] like are you [ __ ] me I'm like I have
[01:40:22] a doctor from Mayo Clinic is the one
[01:40:23] that prescribed This and like I had to
[01:40:25] argue about that and then there was
[01:40:28] another medicine that I was given by a
[01:40:30] seizure doctor which actually I was
[01:40:31] working myself off of because it's a
[01:40:32] sleeping Med he's like I don't want to
[01:40:34] give you that anymore I'm like you know
[01:40:35] don't worry about that I was already
[01:40:36] working off of that so I'm like I'm not
[01:40:38] gonna argue with you on that one but my
[01:40:39] ADHD Med I did want to argue with him on
[01:40:42] it just one of those silly things it's
[01:40:44] just kind of those pain in the butt
[01:40:45] where you you you're not doing anything
[01:40:47] wrong you're following what your
[01:40:49] doctor's ordered um but this one doctor
[01:40:53] came can't either understand what the
[01:40:54] other doctor ordered or they don't know
[01:40:56] the other doctor so they need to talk to
[01:40:58] someone else it's just a effing headache
[01:41:00] at times that's all that's all it boils
[01:41:03] down to is being a
[01:41:05] headache but you know
[01:41:09] what let's do something like
[01:41:18] this I have these still available
[01:41:21] anybody in in one of those
[01:41:24] you play the adventure game with a
[01:41:25] modern Horizon's gift
[01:41:31] bundle oh the GI is not running I'm
[01:41:34] sorry I didn't get the GI running I got

[01:41:56] self-medicating with pseudo pseudo
[01:41:58] fedrin lots of caffeine Red
[01:42:01] Bull mountain de Etc something that
[01:42:03] works for a lot of people yeah that's
[01:42:06] why I'm on that's why I'm using a bunch
[01:42:07] of CA that's why I'm like I have a I
[01:42:09] have a coffee here and I and I have some
[01:42:11] energy drinks and stuff like that that I
[01:42:13] can use that'll help out a little bit um
[01:42:15] I suspect my dad actually had it growing
[01:42:17] up myself because he used to drink a pot
[01:42:19] of coffee a day literal pot of coffee a
[01:42:21] day
[01:42:25] so I need a between one and 10 from Miss

[01:42:38] myself I'll do the d10 we're going to go
[01:42:41] with the five oh we got it from you did
[01:42:44] it I like it Oblivion got it well
[01:42:46] Oblivion one two three four five I was
[01:42:49] having Miss Florida do it so I'm going
[01:42:51] to take the one that I did so I want to
[01:42:53] go with number five instead of the last
[01:42:56] card all right we're going to throw that
[01:42:58] out there yeah it's just a pain in the
[01:43:00] butt when they do stuff like that the
[01:43:01] doctor is like they
[01:43:08] don't like they don't just don't care
[01:43:11] it's like oh it's not going to bother
[01:43:19] me yeah exactly my wife like so I drank
[01:43:21] an energy drink last night at like like
[01:43:23] probably 4:30 5:00 she's like you're
[01:43:25] going to be awake all night I'm like no
[01:43:26] I won't fell asleep at like I don't
[01:43:29] know 11: wasn't early but it was
[01:43:39] fine yeah I can definitely do that kill
[01:43:41] Tren send me a message buddy and I don't
[01:43:43] have a problem you roll the perfect
[01:43:46] 10 all right so nobody wanted this
[01:43:49] bundle here well I bought a couple of
[01:43:51] them and I like them and I think I might
[01:43:53] open another one for myself because I
[01:43:55] kind of bought them for myself in the
[01:43:57] store what do you guys think should I
[01:43:59] open one of these and see what we
[01:44:08] get yeah exactly get myself to the brain
[01:44:10] normal so see what happens is like um
[01:44:13] the way it was explained to me is my
[01:44:15] brain works exceptionally fast um to the
[01:44:20] point
[01:44:21] that um I steps ahead of everyone else
[01:44:25] when I'm trying to figure something out
[01:44:27] and it's not like one or two steps ahead
[01:44:29] it's like 10 to 30 steps ahead so I'm
[01:44:31] like done a lot of times like come on
[01:44:33] guys get there I'm done and what the
[01:44:35] medicine helps me do is focus enough so
[01:44:37] that I can be like all right let's get
[01:44:38] through step one to help you figure it
[01:44:40] out now let's get to step two so I can
[01:44:42] help you figure out now let's get to
[01:44:43] step three so I can help you figure it
[01:44:45] out versus going at step one and going
[01:44:48] dude I'm already at step five let's go
[01:44:49] let's go let's go and then no one knows
[01:44:52] what's going on ever because they have
[01:44:54] no clue where you are because you're
[01:44:55] just skipping around because you're
[01:44:56] already doing everything so quick well
[01:44:58] this focuses you so you can make your
[01:45:00] body and everything slow down and your
[01:45:02] brain slow down and focus enough so that
[01:45:03] you can explain and talk to everyone and
[01:45:05] that's kind of like my best way of
[01:45:07] explaining how it works with me like I I
[01:45:10] will talk to people and I will jump from
[01:45:15] point to point to point but I am going
[01:45:17] from point A to point D to point F
[01:45:21] without going into the ones in between
[01:45:23] and everybody all always is confused but
[01:45:25] if I have my medicine on board or like a
[01:45:28] lot of coffee or caffeine I get to focus
[01:45:30] and I'm like oh I didn't talk about step
[01:45:31] B oh I didn't St talk about step C I
[01:45:34] need to talk about those before I go to
[01:45:35] D and that's one of like that that's
[01:45:37] like kind of a way helps me at least uh
[01:45:41] I don't know how about other people dude
[01:45:43] they go zoom zoom zoom all day long I
[01:45:46] tell my wife I'm either no or go you
[01:45:49] know that's what I say we're no or go
[01:45:55] all right maybe you know what maybe I'll
[01:45:56] put this off and we'll open this up
[01:45:57] tomorrow maybe we'll open that up
[01:46:00] tomorrow we'll see we'll play a little
[01:46:02] bit of the game though who are you g to
[01:46:04] be here which one of our characters are
[01:46:07] you gonna be are you gonna be Mabel
[01:46:09] Hazel curious forger the dream ruin
[01:46:13] transer I don't know but you know what
[01:46:16] we can do some let's do with some uh
[01:46:18] like some singles and stuff right now
[01:46:20] cuz I know people do like the singles so
[01:46:23] might as well throw some of those out
[01:46:25] and see if any of them are what you
[01:46:29] like now the other thing we got going on
[01:46:31] here is I do um like a have another game
[01:46:35] here we have a little
[01:46:36] repack we have other games but we like
[01:46:38] to do these I know people like different
[01:46:42] we call them fos repacks I call them
[01:46:45] because I know people like different
[01:46:46] things here so there's a pack of rabbits
[01:46:50] from bloomo
[01:46:56] I'm going to put these out
[01:46:58] for as you see
[01:47:01] here you have these the foil plus some
[01:47:04] other rabbits related rabbit stuff
[01:47:07] couple dollars for
[01:47:09] those oh yeah I I lose misplace my keys
[01:47:13] my wallet and stuff like that all the
[01:47:14] time my drinks drinks are my thing
[01:47:16] that's the biggest where's my cup where'
[01:47:18] my cup
[01:47:19] go all the time where' my cup oh where's
[01:47:23] that drink I swear I had that over here
[01:47:25] I'm running around the house looking in
[01:47:26] like the six places it could have been
[01:47:32] in yes that's part of the ADHD
[01:47:36] stuff yeah that's part of the ADHD stuff
[01:47:39] I had that all explained to me so pretty
[01:47:42] much the fact that I lose things um this
[01:47:45] because my brain jumps from place to
[01:47:47] place and I forget what I'm doing so I
[01:47:49] forget where I place something and I go
[01:47:51] out the next task quickly because I'm
[01:47:52] I'm jumping from task to task to task
[01:47:54] because I'm not focused on what I'm
[01:47:56] doing is what the explanation for me
[01:48:01] was something along that lines is pretty
[01:48:04] much what it was getting
[01:48:05] at so we'll throw out another combo deal
[01:48:08] here for you we'll do some more of these
[01:48:11] maybe some Bloom BR still Bloom BR is
[01:48:14] fun we'll throw that out here with
[01:48:17] this and we're going to throw out the
[01:48:19] game if you want to play the game the
[01:48:21] bloomo adventure game we throw it out
[01:48:23] like
[01:48:26] this now the man coming
[01:48:33] in the man
[01:48:42] 26 yeah exactly that's what I was saying
[01:48:44] like you you just go on to the next task
[01:48:46] so quick you don't know what you're
[01:48:47] doing with it you you kind of you don't
[01:48:49] remember what you did with it so you
[01:48:50] like you forget in a way you don't
[01:48:53] remember what you did with it because
[01:48:54] you set it down because you went to the
[01:48:55] next task without
[01:49:02] thinking the man 26 the man are you in
[01:49:06] here the man you got a bushy bodyguard
[01:49:09] all right not a bad one look at it's one
[01:49:12] of our uh it's one of our characters in
[01:49:14] our game but what I need you to do for
[01:49:16] me is type slgi I mean um slash d10 or
[01:49:22] SLG G uh or a number between one and 10
[01:49:25] damn it why my brain keep raking here
[01:49:26] it's because I don't have medicine on
[01:49:30] board yep exactly my your brain exactly
[01:49:33] that's what it is my brain shifts Focus
[01:49:35] so quickly and that's what the caffeine
[01:49:37] and the other stuff was needed for when
[01:49:39] you don't have your medicine on board
[01:49:41] one two three four five six seven eight
[01:49:45] number eight now let's see if that ends
[01:49:47] up being our rare that we have up there
[01:49:50] that' be pretty nice
[01:49:53] yeah it just it sucks but it's one of
[01:49:55] those scenarios where it's um uh one of
[01:49:58] the things like now I understand why my
[01:50:01] father was uh did his own business you
[01:50:04] know he ran his own business
[01:50:06] because
[01:50:08] uh he got so frustrated with everybody
[01:50:10] else and how they were did things it
[01:50:12] wasn't how they did things it was that
[01:50:13] they were not moving at his speed type
[01:50:15] thing and when doing his own business he
[01:50:16] was able to focus and know what he was
[01:50:18] doing rather than somebody else telling
[01:50:19] him his own task and one of the things
[01:50:20] that I found out is a lot of people that
[01:50:22] hey they HD are actually entrepreneurs
[01:50:24] in some
[01:50:26] way oh yes cabinet doors my wife gets
[01:50:29] pissed at me about the cabinet doors she
[01:50:31] like are you gon to shut that I'm like I
[01:50:33] will when I'm done getting something out
[01:50:34] of there I need to get another thing out
[01:50:35] of the cabinet she like shut the goddamn
[01:50:37] door and then I'll walk away because she
[01:50:39] yelled at me about shutting the door and
[01:50:40] I'll forget about it because I went and
[01:50:41] opened something else in the
[01:50:42] refrigerator she you never shut the door
[01:50:43] I'm like well you shouldn't argue with
[01:50:45] me about it so I forgot about
[01:50:48] it that never really works out my favor
[01:50:50] though that never really works out my fa
[01:50:55] favor it's one of those ones where
[01:50:57] you're like you try and you try again
[01:50:59] but it will not
[01:51:02] work let's do uh let's see what we got
[01:51:05] else over
[01:51:07] here we don't have too much stuff
[01:51:10] nowadays we're a little low on what we
[01:51:13] have because we're going to be getting
[01:51:14] some more stuff in I'm G to get a big
[01:51:16] order on Friday so if there is anybody
[01:51:18] interested in anything do let me know so
[01:51:21] I'm going to do a big order on Friday
[01:51:23] for a bunch of stuff from different
[01:51:26] locations so probably get a lot of stock
[01:51:29] in in the next few
[01:51:31] weeks so if there's anything you guys
[01:51:33] are looking for you probably need just
[01:51:34] let me know now the Bloomberg Adventure
[01:51:37] game nice fun one here you get to
[01:51:40] play and throw these ones out
[01:51:43] for three of these for
[01:51:46] $18 it's a nice deal right
[01:51:50] there yeah so ADHD fun especially when
[01:51:53] you don't have your medicine but the fun
[01:51:56] part about it is U one of the things
[01:51:59] that I've noticed is that when I have um
[01:52:02] I think I the reason why my family have
[01:52:04] been very good at sailing or or being
[01:52:06] their own captains of their own boats
[01:52:07] and their fishing vessels is because of
[01:52:10] having ADHD and the reason why I say
[01:52:13] that is you have to have a million
[01:52:15] different things on your mind to make
[01:52:17] sure you're not going to crash your boat
[01:52:19] you're not going to pull someone
[01:52:20] overboard and they're not going to drown
[01:52:22] or some some [ __ ] like that you know
[01:52:23] what I mean um and by having those
[01:52:26] million things going on at once you're
[01:52:28] able to focus on the primary one thing
[01:52:30] which is either uh you know piloting the
[01:52:32] boat going from place to place looking
[01:52:33] at what you're doing but you have all
[01:52:35] the other million things going on in the
[01:52:36] background that you're able to focus
[01:52:38] better even with ADHD it's like it's
[01:52:39] made you're made for that
[01:52:42] scenario we're GNA throw out uh this for
[01:52:45] the bloom Barrow adventure game
[01:52:53] yeah more interesting things to
[01:52:55] use yep
[01:53:09] exactly all right put that back
[01:53:12] there then I do have an Infinity
[01:53:16] there we'll throw one of those out with
[01:53:18] little Bloomberg Adventure
[01:53:22] yeah so like
[01:53:25] um one of the things that I I'd read
[01:53:27] about when I first fig found start
[01:53:30] diagnosed me I read a little bit more
[01:53:31] into it and one of the things that I
[01:53:33] found was the people that have
[01:53:35] ADHD or add a lot of the times those are
[01:53:38] the people that were the hunters they
[01:53:41] had they were out hunting or they were
[01:53:43] like the chieftain of the tribes because
[01:53:46] they had the ability to pay attention to
[01:53:48] a million things at once to know that
[01:53:50] that sa- too tiger was behind them
[01:53:52] that's what was rustling in the back
[01:53:53] when they were looking at the mammoth
[01:53:55] trying to catch you know that type of a
[01:53:57] thing so that's what ADHD people are
[01:54:01] they're out there they're ready they're
[01:54:03] they have the energy to go and do things
[01:54:05] where the people that don't have it were
[01:54:07] more like the gatherers they were the
[01:54:09] ones that organized stuff went and um
[01:54:12] gathered the berries um found and
[01:54:15] searched for things slowly and use a
[01:54:17] little bit more focus on what they were
[01:54:19] doing maybe they were the ones that were
[01:54:21] building the rugs or dying stuff or
[01:54:24] whatever it was they weren't the ones
[01:54:25] that were out hunting or the chieftain
[01:54:27] making sure that there was battles and
[01:54:28] warriors going on like they were the
[01:54:29] Warriors and the hunters where the other
[01:54:32] people were like the gatherers so that's
[01:54:34] kind of like the difference between the
[01:54:36] two of them there's like kind of like
[01:54:37] two different brain Styles in a
[01:54:40] way ADH brain cause a lot of problem but
[01:54:43] they are also superp power with the
[01:54:44] ability to hyperfocus yes oh my wife
[01:54:47] gets Wicked pissed when I get
[01:54:48] hyperfocused on stuff she's been like um
[01:54:51] hey I I know you're got you're working
[01:54:53] on your your uh development thing there
[01:54:55] your app but can you please take 10
[01:54:58] minutes and eat
[01:55:05] dinner yeah dmfc that is true that is
[01:55:09] true I know I've actually friends with a
[01:55:11] good well weirdly I I used to go to I
[01:55:14] went to do some stuff with a one wheeel
[01:55:16] I went down to Miami and I was rolling
[01:55:17] around Miami on a one wheeel um and I
[01:55:20] happen to bump into a bunch of people
[01:55:21] and become friendly with with them and
[01:55:23] the odd thing is um all the people that
[01:55:24] I ended up hanging out with all had
[01:55:26] ashers got very got along with them very
[01:55:29] well not as much as the other people and
[01:55:31] then uh my doctor actually my my
[01:55:34] hematologist has ashers and I get along
[01:55:37] with him very well too because we can
[01:55:39] talk to each other like I'm I'm I have a
[01:55:40] high IQ um like I'm like a point below
[01:55:44] Einstein for my IQ so like I go and I
[01:55:46] talk to people and sometimes they the
[01:55:48] doctors are like what are you talking
[01:55:49] about it's because I already read a
[01:55:51] study on what I'm talking about
[01:55:52] this other guy that I talked to the
[01:55:53] hematologist I'm like Hey I was talking
[01:55:55] about like certain things and how blood
[01:55:57] interacted with the brain and the last
[01:55:59] last lack of auction could that be
[01:56:01] causing seizures and stuff like that and
[01:56:03] he looked at me like this guy knows what
[01:56:05] he's talking about and we had a we had a
[01:56:06] full like medical conversation with
[01:56:08] medical terms and I've never had that
[01:56:10] with another doctor and it was BEC I I
[01:56:12] feel like it's their ability to talk or
[01:56:14] their ability to pay attention and know
[01:56:16] what's being talked about
[01:56:23] yes exactly unless we hyperfocus we're
[01:56:25] focused on a million different things
[01:56:27] exactly exactly now remember guys if
[01:56:31] there's anything you guys are interested
[01:56:32] in specifically please let me know
[01:56:34] because I can get a bunch of different
[01:56:37] stuff uh this weekend I was going to
[01:56:39] pick up some things and some new stock
[01:56:43] and I just want to know what you guys
[01:56:44] are intrigued in or looking for you know
[01:56:47] what maybe let's do
[01:56:48] this let's do a three- pack of sorcery
[01:56:53] let's do a three- pack of sorcery deal
[01:56:55] for our adventure
[01:57:01] game there we go three pack of
[01:57:06] sorcery yeah so it's like it's one of
[01:57:08] those things that uh Hey the guy with
[01:57:10] the face how you doing my buddy yeah
[01:57:12] it's one of those things where ADHD is
[01:57:14] very helpful and depending on where you
[01:57:15] are like it's not a good job where you
[01:57:18] have to sit down but if you don't have
[01:57:20] to sit down I never ran the giveaway I
[01:57:22] never started it if you don't have to
[01:57:24] sit down and it's a job where you're
[01:57:25] like moving around doing stuff that's
[01:57:28] the job for
[01:57:29] you and that's why I kind of like the
[01:57:31] idea like I told my wife when I first
[01:57:33] met her I wanted to go and sail around
[01:57:35] the world we're looking and buying a
[01:57:36] boat we're actually going up next week

[01:57:42] A game A baseball game on Friday and
[01:57:44] then we're gonna but on that day we're
[01:57:46] going to be going look my wife and I are
[01:57:47] going to go look at a sailboat uh
[01:57:49] catamaran actually 43 foot catamaran for
[01:57:52] our family to live on and travel around
[01:57:54] and that nice thing with that is there's
[01:57:55] G to be a million things going on so I
[01:57:57] can stay focused and organized not like
[01:58:00] like I am now it's like one thing and
[01:58:03] they're not all they're all random
[01:58:04] they're not organized into one so
[01:58:06] location like they're not like they're
[01:58:07] all over the
[01:58:18] place yeah pretty much I quit dmfc I
[01:58:21] quit my last job cuz I was getting tired
[01:58:24] of um the it I worked it uh I I did
[01:58:26] everything from uh stock market stuff to
[01:58:30] legal pargal stuff I actually used to
[01:58:32] work with a large corporation uh doing
[01:58:34] legal stuff uh Tech it stuff for the
[01:58:36] legal department and um I know exactly
[01:58:39] what you say mean there I I ended up
[01:58:41] leaving uh do my own thing because I
[01:58:42] just got frustrated with everything
[01:58:44] going
[01:58:49] on yeah see Oblivion that's kind of like
[01:58:52] me too I uh grew up and my IQ is uh
[01:58:58] 147
[01:59:00] 157 147
[01:59:03] 157 one of those two I have to look it
[01:59:05] back up it's up there in one of those
[01:59:07] not that's not big of a difference but
[01:59:10] with that up there I was able to figure
[01:59:12] out a lot of stuff growing up when I was
[01:59:14] a kid easily compared to everyone else
[01:59:17] but for whatever reason due to that no
[01:59:20] one else uh
[01:59:23] I always had a hard time in school and
[01:59:24] the teachers didn't like me because I'd
[01:59:25] get stuff done so
[01:59:42] quick so I had to go and find where
[01:59:44] something was like I was a kid that like
[01:59:46] got stuff done in the first 10 minutes
[01:59:48] and they're like this test was supposed
[01:59:49] to take you an hour I'm like um I'm
[01:59:51] sorry

[02:01:03] randoms we have
[02:01:06] uh
[02:01:14] Dracula little Dracula going out for you
[02:01:17] good morning I how's it going
[02:01:27] yes exactly it's the repetitive bitty
[02:01:29] work that I got frustrated so like I'd
[02:01:31] have a ma like I had so I ended up being
[02:01:34] in all AP classes my senior year of high
[02:01:36] school and even being in AP
[02:01:40] classes uh one of the things that
[02:01:41] happened
[02:01:43] was
[02:01:47] sorry yes I have seen some of the
[02:01:49] intellect I have seen some of that so
[02:01:51] like one of the things with the class is
[02:01:52] like I'd finish a test quickly and then
[02:01:56] I'd start doodling or whatever else or
[02:01:59] I'd go on book out and start doing
[02:02:01] something else like you can't do that
[02:02:02] I'm like what do you want me to do sit
[02:02:03] here silently for freaking 45 minutes I
[02:02:06] finished an hour and this we have an
[02:02:08] hour and a half to do the test I finish
[02:02:10] it in 35 minutes what am I supposed to
[02:02:12] do like this is
[02:02:14] ridiculous and they would just pretty
[02:02:17] much I went to a private school and it
[02:02:19] was they I had one of the freaking
[02:02:21] godamn nuns took a go a [ __ ] yard
[02:02:23] stick to my hand one time because I
[02:02:25] pulled a book out you know what I ended
[02:02:27] up doing I ended up looking out the
[02:02:28] window counting [ __ ] birds and [ __ ]
[02:02:30] like that to keep myself entertained I'm
[02:02:32] sorry for swearing but anyways my point
[02:02:34] is like ah it's it's it's a pain in the
[02:02:36] butt like normal school is not the same
[02:02:39] that's why for me I've always felt like
[02:02:41] when you do the normal school here um
[02:02:44] they should be counter spell a little
[02:02:46] counter foul for you from Commander
[02:02:47] masters with any of the normal school
[02:02:49] they they need to have it used to to be
[02:02:52] better when I was younger where they
[02:02:53] find kind of focus more towards you um
[02:02:55] even in high school they did Focus
[02:02:57] towards you a little bit because the
[02:02:58] high school I went to but then I started
[02:02:59] teaching nor reg uh recently myself and
[02:03:03] I came out with a giveaway win look at
[02:03:05] that now with what uh you got here was a
[02:03:08] dire sight oh not the big hit there but
[02:03:10] I let's write your name down here you do
[02:03:13] get a discount on shipping if you want
[02:03:14] it
[02:03:23] interesting the moment in all work is
[02:03:25] independent at each kids's own level at
[02:03:27] whatever speed that's why I'm on a Sur
[02:03:29] student
[02:03:31] yeah yeah those ones are pretty
[02:03:38] good yeah see I ended up going I I was
[02:03:40] lucky that I had a private high school
[02:03:42] that I went to so like I had a
[02:03:44] scholarship to go to the high school
[02:03:45] that's literally the only reason I was
[02:03:46] able to go there I got um one question
[02:03:49] wrong on the entrance exam um and I
[02:03:56] um I got one question wrong on the
[02:03:58] entrance exam so they gave me a uh a
[02:04:01] scholarship to go
[02:04:03] there and that was literally the only
[02:04:05] reason I was able to go there and if it
[02:04:08] wasn't for that I probably would have
[02:04:09] been a lot worse off in the private in
[02:04:11] the public school just because they
[02:04:13] didn't have AP stuff for me U but
[02:04:16] luckily the pro the hot the other one
[02:04:19] did so we're going to throw this one out
[02:04:21] here
[02:04:22] if anybody wants
[02:04:25] it for $2 and I need you my
[02:04:29] friend I to give me a number
[02:04:34] between one and 10 or type out
[02:04:40] d10 number
[02:04:45] three yeah that might have been part of
[02:04:47] it I was a good student because I got
[02:04:49] everything done but I was uh one two
[02:04:51] three I was not the um I was a dis I
[02:04:54] just I Was A disruption at times is what
[02:04:57] I was told like seriously I'm A
[02:04:59] disruption like come on like then do
[02:05:00] something about it give me something to
[02:05:01] do so I'm not pulling my pulling my
[02:05:03] teeth out waiting on what's going on you
[02:05:05] know but yeah I agree with that on
[02:05:07] Robert the um montauri
[02:05:13] schools actually
[02:05:15] might I'm want to keep that one oh don't
[02:05:19] know now we'll throw it in here
[02:05:37] where is
[02:05:45] it why is it not coming up
[02:05:57] I typed it in and it won't come
[02:06:14] out yeah I did AP Bio AP English AP
[02:06:19] math um and yeah I did a lot of um AP
[02:06:24] Chemistry um I actually went into
[02:06:26] college and I didn't go to my freshman
[02:06:28] year at College uh in my organic
[02:06:29] chemistry class and the teachers got
[02:06:31] pissed because I show up for test and
[02:06:32] get
[02:06:45] pay Cody most likely that happened
[02:06:47] because they weren't giving you the work
[02:06:49] challenge enough yeah exactly you needed
[02:06:50] more challenging work to learn and
[02:06:55] everything yep that's exactly what it
[02:06:56] was a lot of times that same thing
[02:06:58] happened with me I wouldn't be I
[02:06:59] wouldn't be paying
[02:07:03] attention because of other stuff going
[02:07:06] on now this is a $4 card going for a
[02:07:13] three now yeah yep that makes sense see
[02:07:17] I was um I was a good student I was just
[02:07:20] disruptive is what I was always told so
[02:07:22] that was my issue like I had a um like I
[02:07:26] had
[02:07:30] a oh [ __ ] that's a long time ago what
[02:07:33] was that so I got a 1280 on the SATs and
[02:07:37] that was out of 15 to 1600 back then um
[02:07:41] and then I had like
[02:07:43] a 3.9 something for a
[02:07:47] GPA um so like I was up there
[02:07:54] I just wasn't a fan of uh what I had to
[02:07:56] do regularly and then finally what I got
[02:07:59] in the AP classes though that became
[02:08:00] more interesting because it was hard for
[02:08:02] me and it actually took time and I had
[02:08:04] to focus and stuff you know what I mean
[02:08:05] I wasn't able to just walk her away and
[02:08:07] just be oh I can I can do this I
[02:08:09] actually had to put a little bit of
[02:08:10] effort into it there's your cloudkey for
[02:08:14] to where did our giveaway go to did I
[02:08:17] not start it I don't think I started it
[02:08:20] no I didn't
[02:08:25] there we
[02:08:29] go yeah see it's part of the stuff you
[02:08:33] go that's good to turn around that's
[02:08:36] good to turn do have a turn around you
[02:08:37] need sometimes a there also sometimes
[02:08:39] it's like a teacher one teacher that you
[02:08:40] bump into that understands you and helps
[02:08:42] so that's always a nice thing
[02:08:47] too all right let's do uh
[02:08:51] throw out some stuff
[02:08:58] here I don't think that's the right
[02:09:01] card I think that's the wrong
[02:09:10] card turn about
[02:09:22] and
[02:09:23] foil there you go throw that out
[02:09:30] there for
[02:09:34] you
[02:09:36] yeah yeah exactly it made you learn
[02:09:38] harder it had to make you put the effort
[02:09:39] in so you got
[02:09:40] harder you had to work
[02:09:46] harder yeah exactly Oblivion so I'll
[02:09:49] give you an example of that when I was
[02:09:50] in college
[02:09:52] um for me for for have knowing stuff I
[02:09:55] um I had done my family were fishermen
[02:09:57] so I had done a um a test a paper at one
[02:10:01] point in high school for something that
[02:10:03] would help out with and the uh like
[02:10:06] about a a fish that was supposedly
[02:10:08] endangered well it wasn't really
[02:10:10] endangered it was just an endangered
[02:10:11] fish from the Caribbean and had nothing
[02:10:13] to do with the fish up in New England
[02:10:16] well some fraking person got a lawyer
[02:10:19] and was able to get the New England
[02:10:20] fishing industry shut down my senior
[02:10:22] year of high school for like a month and
[02:10:25] a half well they ended up using my paper
[02:10:27] the lawyer because I wrote about I ended
[02:10:29] up like you know what I'm gonna write a
[02:10:30] paper about this because I need to write
[02:10:31] a paper about something biology so I
[02:10:32] wrote it anyways the lawyer ended up
[02:10:34] using my paper helped use uh helped to
[02:10:36] actually get the CO case thrown out
[02:10:38] because they're like there's no this has
[02:10:39] to do with nothing up in this area and
[02:10:41] then on top of that though um I learned
[02:10:44] a bunch of other stuff U just learned
[02:10:46] about the fishing industry a lot more in
[02:10:48] depth with research articles well my
[02:10:50] freshman year
[02:10:52] um I was in a um ecology class and the
[02:10:55] ecology teacher tried to tell us that
[02:10:57] the fishing industry in the United
[02:10:59] States is what's killing off um the fish
[02:11:02] in the on the coast and I immediately
[02:11:04] raised my hand I was like yep you like
[02:11:07] you know no one raised their hand in
[02:11:08] like at that scenario because he just
[02:11:09] telling everybody what's going on I'm
[02:11:10] like hey I'm I'm you all right yeah sure
[02:11:13] what's your name and I said my name I'm
[02:11:14] James uh he's like all right what do you
[02:11:16] have to say here I'm like I'm I'm sorry
[02:11:17] but I have to disagree with you I'm I'm
[02:11:20] pretty you're you're actually wrong and
[02:11:22] the reason for that is and I gave him
[02:11:24] the reasons of like like how like a lot
[02:11:26] of the Asian and Russian uh fishing
[02:11:29] trolling boats will go and just tear
[02:11:30] everything up by troling where the
[02:11:32] people that are on our area like the US
[02:11:34] ones that are small individual boats
[02:11:35] that are not the big fish factories they
[02:11:37] go and actually fish in a location
[02:11:39] because they know they'll get fish there
[02:11:40] and they're not going to go where they
[02:11:41] hatch because they know they're not
[02:11:43] going to get fish next year if they go
[02:11:44] where they hatch where the other boats
[02:11:46] don't care and they just tear up the
[02:11:47] bottom of the ocean and I went through
[02:11:49] some of this stuff and explained it to
[02:11:51] them
[02:11:52] um and it was probably like a two-minute
[02:11:54] thing that I said he goes all right well
[02:11:55] thank you uh that's something to know
[02:11:57] about and then he goes I'd like and then
[02:11:59] um let's talk after class and he cut me
[02:12:01] off I'm like oh [ __ ] and everybody in
[02:12:03] class is like oh great dude you got
[02:12:07] screwed and I'm like oh God my friend
[02:12:10] next to me is nudging me goes you're in
[02:12:11] trouble I'm like no God I just I'm like
[02:12:13] I know this because I did a report on it
[02:12:15] like I'm 100% sure because I like I even
[02:12:17] like referenced the studies well the guy
[02:12:20] ended up uh after class when he pulled
[02:12:22] me up I'm like hey I'm sorry about that
[02:12:23] I wasn't trying to reoo he's like no
[02:12:25] actually thank you I appreciate that I
[02:12:26] didn't understand that side of it he why
[02:12:28] do you why do you know this I said you
[02:12:30] know my family are a fisherman for
[02:12:32] generations and I have done some studies
[02:12:34] on this myself studying on this myself
[02:12:36] for research for different things and I
[02:12:38] explained how they Ed my paper to get us
[02:12:40] back so we could go fishing in the
[02:12:41] fishing industry and some of that and he
[02:12:43] goes well thank you I'm going to look
[02:12:44] into some of that a little bit more I
[02:12:45] was unaware of all that because I just
[02:12:47] had fishing industry ruined it and so he
[02:12:51] himself um as a as a professor learned
[02:12:55] something because I was I thought I was
[02:12:57] going to get in trouble but he himself
[02:12:58] actually admitted he learned something
[02:12:59] because I having ADHD dug in so much
[02:13:03] into this because I had a reason to to
[02:13:06] prove these other people wrong that I
[02:13:08] hyperfocused on it so much that I
[02:13:09] learned enough that I was able to teach
[02:13:11] a professor as a freshman age
[02:13:15] student so I don't know either
[02:13:19] way some fun things
[02:13:22] intriguing
[02:13:25] life let's go through some singles here
[02:13:28] for a little
[02:13:30] bit and see if anybody wants
[02:13:42] any let I'm going out
[02:13:45] for $4
[02:13:48] there yes hyperfixation exactly
[02:13:51] hyper fixation so I got to the point
[02:13:53] like I was able to figure out what they
[02:13:54] weren't well they weren't necessarily
[02:13:56] not able to I I did it quickly and
[02:13:58] efficiently to the point that they were
[02:14:00] using an 18-year-old paper from high
[02:14:02] school in a court case to decide the
[02:14:06] fishing industry in
[02:14:11] Massachusetts there's your uh almost 160
[02:14:13] IQ right
[02:14:19] there but we'll go through some more of
[02:14:21] the cards here I think I'm only going to
[02:14:23] be on for a little while longer not too
[02:14:25] much because uh we did do the new game
[02:14:27] but we don't have a lot of new stuff
[02:14:29] here so it's going to be hard for me to
[02:14:30] go through things not everybody's
[02:14:32] jumping in right now with our uh what we
[02:14:33] do have so I think I might jump off a
[02:14:35] little early uh get some other things
[02:14:37] done that we have depending on if you
[02:14:40] guys want any uh any of the singles that
[02:14:42] we're throwing out right now got a chunk
[02:14:43] of them but what I actually need to do
[02:14:45] is scan these babies and get them put up
[02:14:47] into uh TCG player because it looks like
[02:14:51] like a lot of you aren't always looking
[02:14:52] for
[02:14:54] them but this is a nice little card to
[02:14:57] pick up if you want it and then $8 card
[02:14:59] going out for
[02:15:01] seven shatter skull
[02:15:09] smashing yeah see that's what it is too
[02:15:11] so Oblivion I I the simple things hurt
[02:15:16] me because they're too easy in a way
[02:15:18] it's like I can't figure it out because
[02:15:20] it's too easy I need something like
[02:15:22] harder it's like no make that harder and
[02:15:24] I'll figure it
[02:15:25] out I don't know how else to say
[02:15:32] that yeah because of how the brain's
[02:15:34] wired
[02:15:38] exactly nice little path of ancestry for
[02:15:45] you but it's nice you know you you have
[02:15:47] some fun things there
[02:15:49] and you you you you now that I've
[02:15:52] learned how to kind of function a little
[02:15:54] bit more with it I realize that um I
[02:15:57] think they were right that like a lot of
[02:15:59] people that have ADHD are good for
[02:16:01] entrepreneurs because they can pick out
[02:16:02] a million different things and go and do
[02:16:04] them all
[02:16:09] so yep yeah see I um I was able to do
[02:16:13] calculus in my head I don't know if I
[02:16:15] can do it anymore um but like on one of
[02:16:18] my tests I literally just answered all
[02:16:20] the questions and handed it to him in
[02:16:21] like 20 minutes he's like no this you
[02:16:23] didn't do this I'm like yes I did this
[02:16:24] is all done he like you cheated I'm like
[02:16:27] seriously why do you think I cheat like
[02:16:29] no one gets this done without any
[02:16:30] without any of the work written out I'm
[02:16:32] like fine I'm like give me like give me
[02:16:34] some questions so I can prove you that I
[02:16:36] didn't do this just write him on the
[02:16:37] board so he really wrote out like three
[02:16:39] different questions on the board and I
[02:16:40] went like this
[02:16:51] and wrote out all the answers had them
[02:16:52] all right and the guy looks at it and
[02:16:54] goes all right fine maybe you did do
[02:16:56] that we going to talk after class though
[02:16:59] I can't talk now and after class he
[02:17:01] talked to me he's like even though you
[02:17:02] were able to figure that all out that's
[02:17:04] I don't understand how you did that uh
[02:17:06] but you still need to show your work I'm
[02:17:08] like I don't know how I did it
[02:17:10] completely I just know how to do it in
[02:17:12] my head and if I need to write that out
[02:17:14] I'm not going to be able to write that
[02:17:19] out yes
[02:17:29] yeah exactly useful and interesting
[02:17:32] problems exactly like I always in
[02:17:33] calculus I was like a that was easy
[02:17:35] because you were able to figure it out
[02:17:36] and there's a bunch of different
[02:17:37] problems like million things kind of
[02:17:38] figure out into one it's like a puzzle I
[02:17:40] think that's what it is we like Puzzles
[02:17:42] if that makes any sense
[02:17:53] but yeah I mean we just hang out we I
[02:17:54] mean we do our best in life right it's
[02:17:56] all you can
[02:18:01] do G do this here little serpan sardan
[02:18:06] Avenger but
[02:18:10] yeah yep see that's what it
[02:18:13] is see I try my best with like things
[02:18:17] and and
[02:18:19] it's it can help Focus you but it can
[02:18:22] also help cause other problems it can
[02:18:24] cause a lot of problems if you don't
[02:18:25] know how to deal with it and
[02:18:29] luckily
[02:18:35] yes yep exactly so something more
[02:18:38] interesting we go to the next more
[02:18:40] interesting thing which is why so one of
[02:18:44] the things that I want to do when we go
[02:18:46] when we travel around on our boat is I
[02:18:48] know my kids are similar to me so I want
[02:18:50] to teach them based on what we have
[02:18:51] around us so we'll be in the Caribbean
[02:18:53] and we'll do some scuba diving we'll
[02:18:54] teach him about the fish the coral and
[02:18:56] stuff like that or some snorkeling that
[02:18:58] type of thing or we'll teach them about
[02:19:00] some of the plants and the fauna when
[02:19:01] we're on some of the islands or we you
[02:19:03] know some of the math we can do based on
[02:19:05] height with how the angle of the boat
[02:19:07] and the wind angle has to get us in how
[02:19:08] much speed we can go and those type of
[02:19:10] things because those are functional and
[02:19:12] they make sense for a reason to use it
[02:19:13] and that's how you get the attention for
[02:19:15] an ADHD person to work and get their
[02:19:16] brain working well and I think that will
[02:19:18] help like spee specifically with my kids
[02:19:21] and other and I think a lot of other
[02:19:22] people things like that will help
[02:19:24] because I know when I I worked at an
[02:19:26] alternative high school um and that's my
[02:19:29] last time that I taught was at the
[02:19:30] Alternative High School and the reason
[02:19:32] was because uh long story store a girl
[02:19:35] got in trouble for having sex with a kid
[02:19:36] on campus and she got kicked out with
[02:19:37] the other kid and they weren't going to
[02:19:39] be able to keep me because both of those
[02:19:40] kids were paying pretty much for me to
[02:19:42] be there um so I wasn't able to go back
[02:19:46] the next year and I moved on to it stuff
[02:19:48] but um one of the things I wasn't even
[02:19:51] thinking about going back just because
[02:19:52] of how the politics and the things
[02:19:53] turned out where people now it's all
[02:19:57] political there it's not figuring it out
[02:19:59] for the kids and helping them get better
[02:20:01] it's all about politics and making sure
[02:20:03] they pass whatever the test is or making
[02:20:05] sure a common core is there I call it
[02:20:07] common dumb it's not common core it's
[02:20:08] common dumb is what you're making
[02:20:10] everybody common idiot but
[02:20:12] anyways there're that's what they were
[02:20:14] all focusing on and that's I had a fres
[02:20:16] I did it for like three years and I had
[02:20:17] a hard time finally I after leaving I'm
[02:20:20] like I don't want my kids to go to
[02:20:21] school I want to teach them myself or we
[02:20:23] have to send them to a private school
[02:20:24] just because there's no way we can send
[02:20:26] them to a school where people are like
[02:20:29] that and they um so my my kids are at
[02:20:32] the public right now for kindergarten
[02:20:34] like the younger age which is fine but
[02:20:37] um we're going to go and now teach
[02:20:39] ourselves we'll do homeschooling we'll
[02:20:41] teach like that and one of the things
[02:20:43] that I wanted to do though is bring some
[02:20:45] of that homeschooling stuff around to
[02:20:46] everyone else and show you guys some of
[02:20:48] those videos so I don't know if you guys
[02:20:50] would be intrigued with doing that like
[02:20:51] when we're doing those like share some
[02:20:54] of that share some of what we're doing
[02:20:57] uh with all of you now Sirius blacks
[02:20:59] drole you got a tempest angler ah not
[02:21:02] the big hit not our big rare one now
[02:21:04] Sirius if you can give me I do something
[02:21:06] for me I need you to give me a number
[02:21:08] between one and 10 or slash d10
[02:21:23] you're very
[02:21:27] welcome yes
[02:21:30] exactly exactly teaching to the test is
[02:21:33] the worst thing for ADHD kids exactly
[02:21:36] and it's horrible for that now Sirius
[02:21:38] can you give me a number between one and
[02:21:40] 10 because we need to see if we can pull
[02:21:42] out another one what we can pull out
[02:21:43] next for someone if we're going to be
[02:21:45] lucky and it will end up being the um
[02:21:47] the rare that's in there for our
[02:21:48] giveaway
[02:21:55] yeah it's just one of those things that
[02:21:56] it's like you can't p t to a test when
[02:22:00] you do that it doesn't make any
[02:22:02] function oh not a problem
[02:22:05] Sirius not a problem buddy I'm going to
[02:22:07] do d10 for you we're going to do number
[02:22:08] two sound good number
[02:22:12] two one
[02:22:16] two there we
[02:22:18] are that'll be the give way number we're
[02:22:21] going out with but yeah I mean it's
[02:22:25] um it's easy to it's not bad to deal
[02:22:28] with but the way they teach is not
[02:22:33] good exactly pracy they I got in trouble
[02:22:37] when uh my last time teaching and that's
[02:22:38] kind of when I was like are you goddamn
[02:22:39] kidding me because the way I I taught
[02:22:42] albra to one of the students that I knew
[02:22:44] he was having a hard time and I'm
[02:22:45] guessing he had ADHD because he was
[02:22:46] bouncing all over the place he made a
[02:22:48] comment about he's just he doesn't even
[02:22:49] care about school he's just going to go
[02:22:50] and drive the dump trucks for his
[02:22:52] father-in-law as uh his uncle and just
[02:22:55] dump Loom and and dirt all over the
[02:22:56] place to drive trucks like all right
[02:22:58] that sounds good so when your uncle
[02:23:00] tells you he needs um three cubic feet
[02:23:02] of loom and you need uh 30 cubic feet of
[02:23:05] loom and your truck only holds 12 cubic
[02:23:08] feet of Loom how many truckloads are you
[02:23:10] going to need to get without overloading
[02:23:11] it so you spend more than you need
[02:23:14] because if you're if you spend more than
[02:23:15] you need your uncle's going to be pissed
[02:23:16] at you for spending $1,000 dollar more
[02:23:18] when you didn't need to spend that
[02:23:19] amount and you need certain amount as
[02:23:21] soon as I did it that way he was like oh
[02:23:23] 12 12 all right that's 22 that means all
[02:23:26] right that's 24 that means I need six
[02:23:28] left all right six six of those all
[02:23:30] right six so that'd be three and a half
[02:23:32] two and a half two and a half of them
[02:23:34] like see dude you just did algebra in
[02:23:35] your head not even realizing it he's
[02:23:39] like oh oh my it was like the dawn on
[02:23:43] people that you do that and it just
[02:23:45] clicks immediately to some people like
[02:23:47] and then he used that as references when
[02:23:50] he was doing another math St so he'd go
[02:23:52] up and he'd start like doing some of the
[02:23:53] things he'd do it a little bit
[02:23:54] differently to help himself figure it
[02:23:56] out and at one point the teacher's like
[02:23:58] well that's not the way you're supposed
[02:23:58] to do it I'm like uh just give it a
[02:24:00] minute and he went up there and he was
[02:24:02] doing it on the board because the
[02:24:03] teacher actually told him not even to do
[02:24:04] it that he thought he was goingon to
[02:24:05] grow a penis on the board or something
[02:24:06] I'm like you know he knows what he's
[02:24:07] doing so he went up and he actually got
[02:24:09] it right and the principal ended up
[02:24:10] coming and saying something I ended up
[02:24:12] talking to the principal because he came
[02:24:13] down and say he was appreciated of how
[02:24:15] the kid was able to do the math stuff
[02:24:17] that he was never able to do and he did
[02:24:20] say made a comment about he didn't like
[02:24:22] the way that they were doing it I'm like
[02:24:23] well he learns differently he's not
[02:24:24] learning the same way everybody else is
[02:24:26] he needs to do it a different way which
[02:24:28] is why he's in this class in the
[02:24:30] alternative to learn
[02:24:33] alternatively so what is he doing wrong
[02:24:35] well you need to do this way because
[02:24:37] this is the way that things are supposed
[02:24:38] to be taught and I was like no wonder
[02:24:40] why our kids are goddamn turning into
[02:24:42] the dumb ones in the world instead of
[02:24:43] the Smart
[02:24:45] Ones like as soon as that was said to me
[02:24:47] I'm like oh God oh God
[02:24:51] all right well this is what we're going
[02:24:52] to do right
[02:24:54] now we're going to see where we are for
[02:24:59] check-ins yes just wir to learn
[02:25:01] different that's why like um like I've
[02:25:04] taken I don't like to say it but I've
[02:25:05] done like those autism tests that they
[02:25:07] have you take like a 50 question things
[02:25:09] and I'm always on the scale of it but
[02:25:11] I'm not high enough that I'm worried I
[02:25:13] think it's more the ADHD and and o o
[02:25:15] like kind of like OCD is stuff going
[02:25:18] on but I think this is what we're going
[02:25:21] to do
[02:25:22] here we going to do this not doing too
[02:25:26] much right now I have some other things
[02:25:28] we can kind of accomplish
[02:25:30] today so let's
[02:25:39] see let's do
[02:25:41] this we're g wait for our giveaway to go
[02:25:44] here talking a little bit about of our
[02:25:46] our uh our issues
[02:25:48] here but hey it's one of those things
[02:25:50] that you
[02:25:51] learn to deal with and finally once
[02:25:55] you've dealt with
[02:25:56] them um you know how to work the world
[02:25:59] better but that takes sometimes a lot of
[02:26:01] people to figure it out takes a lot of
[02:26:03] time to figure it out for some people
[02:26:04] because they're not
[02:26:06] taught to work with it they're taught to
[02:26:09] do what they're
[02:26:10] told and one of the biggest things with
[02:26:13] school nowadays is they teach you to do
[02:26:14] what you're told instead of teach you
[02:26:16] how to work with what you have and that
[02:26:18] is my largest problem on a lot of stuff
[02:26:20] in this and the way the country was
[02:26:22] doing teaching and one of the reasons
[02:26:24] why I kind of stopped myself we have a
[02:26:27] prism Mari
[02:26:34] command yeah yeah makes sense yeah it's
[02:26:38] one of those things like I never
[02:26:39] understand I might be I might not be but
[02:26:41] I'm never going to push to it because
[02:26:42] I'm good with the way I am and I don't
[02:26:43] need another label of
[02:26:44] [Laughter]
[02:26:47] something if that makes any sense I'm
[02:26:50] good with my labels that I have
[02:27:00] already then exactly that's exactly kind
[02:27:02] of what I'm getting at Robert that's why
[02:27:03] I want to do because I know this way
[02:27:05] school is being taught now my kids will
[02:27:08] not do well in it I already know that
[02:27:10] because they've already had a couple
[02:27:11] issues where where it's like oh they
[02:27:14] aren't doing what they're supposed to
[02:27:15] I'm like well did they get done what
[02:27:16] they were supposed to like yeah they got
[02:27:17] it done like well they got it done and

[01:08:02] out here okay because the door's locked
[01:08:05] right now and you haven't know you don't
[01:08:07] know how to get by this door that's
[01:08:09] locked so the person that's in spot
[01:08:10] number one I'm going to need you to do
[01:08:13] some you need to help me a little bit
[01:08:14] here all
[01:08:17] right spot number one let me see if I
[01:08:20] can get this out here because I don't I
[01:08:22] can't we can't figure out how to get
[01:08:23] through the door Luke Luke wants in Luke
[01:08:27] wants in that's fine you can jump in if
[01:08:29] you want to have him take in one of the
[01:08:30] spots with take over one of your spots
[01:08:31] because there's six spots and you guys

[01:08:36] doing our adventuring but all of a
[01:08:40] sudden you're like oh crap you go up to
[01:08:42] the door you can't get in you notice
[01:08:46] that there's a panel on the side that
[01:08:47] you have to enter some code but you
[01:08:48] can't figure out what it was but you
[01:08:49] happen to Wi that last break you realize
[01:08:51] oh wait we got some intriguing things in

[01:31:41] [ __ ] and you smile and you just
[01:31:43] wave and say treat the whole family
[01:31:44] [ __ ] and you smile the entire
[01:31:45] time because it pisses them off even
[01:31:47] more because you're smiling and you're
[01:31:48] waving at them and they think you're
[01:31:50] waving at them but you're not you're
[01:31:51] really tell them to about you just say

[01:32:06] one that was one of that's one of that's
[01:32:08] how I always instead of giving a finger
[01:32:10] that's what I do now it's what I always
[01:32:12] do all right so you guys picked your
[01:32:14] things here all right you're going over
[01:32:16] to uh did you need to go to Steve or or
[01:32:18] the Vault or um Gage where are you going

[01:32:25] that Vault second
[01:32:27] floor five middle fingers exactly treat
[01:32:30] the whole
[01:32:31] family and you smile the best part is
[01:32:33] you're sitting there smiling going like
[01:32:35] this and you're like as they're like
[01:32:37] flipping you off or whatever
[01:32:39] else and yeah anybody else want to go
[01:32:42] into any of these locations yet or do
[01:32:44] you want to go after the encounter now I
[01:32:46] would recommend giving somebody throwing

[01:32:53] going sugar Steve with Luke so you're at
[01:32:54] Sugar Steve I thought you were so you go

[01:34:09] everybody has bug parts from the last
[01:34:10] one and anybody want to throw dangerous
[01:34:12] a weapon I'd recommend doing that cuz we
[01:34:13] have a bunch of people with swords and
[01:34:15] extra things maybe you can throw them a
[01:34:17] weapon and he can help out with our our

[01:34:40] got to be careful the Raiders don't like
[01:34:43] you going around their floor that's
[01:34:44] their floor they claimed it so you got
[01:34:46] to be careful getting it in there I see
[01:34:49] you unlocked it oh yeah I heard
[01:34:51] something and I was getting worried
[01:34:52] about oh guys just be just don't let
[01:34:53] everybody come to this direction cuz
[01:34:55] then we're going to have to deal with
[01:34:56] those people and I don't want those
[01:34:57] Raiders ruining my place that's why I
[01:34:58] have to have a locked door here come on
[01:35:00] so let's just just make sure if you're
[01:35:02] gonna go and do anything over there kill
[01:35:04] them so that I don't need to deal with
[01:35:06] them later all
[01:35:11] right oh I'm sorry
[01:35:13] Ethan I'm so sorry
[01:35:20] buddy all right you're going to trade
[01:35:23] all of your
[01:35:25] pogs for some Gap bullets and a pistol
[01:35:27] for dangerous is that what you're
[01:35:34] saying no bug oh the bug ah GNA give him
[01:35:39] bug part you know I can do that I can do
[01:35:42] that I'll give a danger us you will have
[01:35:45] a
[01:35:48] pistol you get a pistol
[01:35:54] with nine rounds of ammo nice one and
[01:35:57] then um you're going to get

[01:36:21] more shots with those there you go
[01:36:24] all right any specific Raiders you want
[01:36:26] us to get rid of oh yeah there's a a
[01:36:28] couple of them there's a guy is one of
[01:36:30] as long as you get rid of the head of
[01:36:31] them they generally will start acting
[01:36:33] crazy and it's harder for them to
[01:36:35] organize so if you get you're the main
[01:36:37] guy there that would be that would be
[01:36:39] appreciated because you know they'll
[01:36:41] help get rid of that'll help us so I
[01:36:43] don't have to worry about things later
[01:36:44] on because generally they just go crazy
[01:36:45] after that and they're all distracted
[01:36:47] and they don't even come to my room when

[01:41:30] before you head out and you start uh
[01:41:32] going into the door you unlocked it you
[01:41:35] heard a click the door was getting ready
[01:41:37] to open but you uh you wanted to go over
[01:41:39] and check it with sugar Steve before you
[01:41:49] went Miss Nico you have one two three
[01:41:54] four five six seven oh you're

[01:42:10] have a critical hit and you have an you
[01:42:12] have AR and with 30 rounds of ammo so
[01:42:15] you're going to have to uh figure out
[01:42:16] what you want to do there because you're
[01:42:17] going to have to either get rid of
[01:42:19] something drop it or uh you might not be
[01:42:21] able to make it to the battle in time
[01:42:23] when they're all
[01:42:25] fighting Miss Nico you get to decide you
[01:42:28] have a you have a few too many
[01:42:33] things Ah that's a good idea Miss Nico
[01:42:36] goes hey dangerous would you like a
[01:42:41] knife dangerous goes yes I'll take a
[01:42:43] knife dangerous is getting hooked up
[01:42:48] here make sure you're ready for the
[01:42:50] adventure there you go dangerous now has
[01:42:53] a knife all right now you have seven
[01:42:56] spots that means you can't you still
[01:42:58] won't be able to pick anything up when
[01:42:59] uh when the adventuring goes on and you
[01:43:01] hit your raid though you have to decide
[01:43:03] what you want to
[01:43:04] do do you want to sell something do you
[01:43:08] want to trade something do you want to
[01:43:09] just go along and maybe uh pick stuff up
[01:43:11] and not worry about what you're
[01:43:14] getting you're set to start preparing
[01:43:17] for war I know they are preparing you
[01:43:18] for
[01:43:20] war you're going to give your last five
[01:43:22] rounds to Luke spicy says all right
[01:43:27] spicy going to give you five rounds of
[01:43:29] Luke so Luke you're going to go up to
[01:43:34] 50 and then spicy is going to get rid of
[01:43:36] your ammo for AR so that brings you down
[01:43:38] to one six spots in your
[01:43:42] inventory for some bug parts
[01:43:45] oh I think I could give you um I think I
[01:43:49] give you uh seven pogs for some bug
[01:43:51] parts
[01:43:53] um some the seven pogs I think would be
[01:43:55] good and some spikes o how many spikes
[01:43:58] do you have how many spikes do you have
[01:43:59] to give CU I like spikes those are good
[01:44:01] those help out with Rad Rad stuff a lot
[01:44:03] we can get some Po rways from those so I
[01:44:07] like spikes how many of those you have
[01:44:09] you have you do have four well yeah did
[01:44:12] you use one already if you use one
[01:44:13] already you have four if not you have
[01:44:15] five I might have not taking you out
[01:44:17] from using
[01:44:18] one all right you have five so you have
[01:44:22] five so with those five you you g to
[01:44:25] give all five to them all right
[01:44:27] five I think I could do 15
[01:44:32] 15 Luke you should still have one Spike
[01:44:36] I do believe you do have one Spike that
[01:44:37] is correct how about 15
[01:44:40] pogs for those Miss
[01:44:45] Nico the spikes well it's the spikes and

[02:08:49] pistol and there was also a luck charm
[02:08:54] found and one critical found that's

[02:09:05] big guy I was thinking I didn't think
[02:09:06] about the small guy so why
[02:09:08] not who has the lowest Health points and
[02:09:10] you have a lot of Health too there is

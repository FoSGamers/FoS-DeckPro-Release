[00:01:36] hey there we
[00:01:39] go oh we have some breaks going I know
[00:01:42] well if we can so our break today is
[00:01:45] kind of cool and I call it the Biggest
[00:01:46] Loser break the way that we do it is we
[00:01:49] do it like this we open two sets which
[00:01:52] is from the new box by the way we have
[00:01:54] two
[00:01:55] modern two Commander
[00:01:58] Masters dra that's an nsri collector
[00:02:02] collector of dungeons dragons collector
[00:02:05] of Bloom and a modern Horizon 3
[00:02:12] collector
[00:02:22] okay and with that being said the break
[00:02:26] is that and then also this so the way
[00:02:29] that the break goes is our um we open
[00:02:32] all these we take the mythics Commons
[00:02:35] and uncommons that are worth $3 or more
[00:02:38] in the rares and mythics we put them in
[00:02:40] the sleeves we shuffle them up we hand
[00:02:41] them out to everybody that's that
[00:02:42] purchased in and the person that gets
[00:02:46] the uh Biggest Loser in it though out of
[00:02:48] all those that doesn't get any bigger
[00:02:49] Hits and The Biggest Loser will get the
[00:02:51] commander deck out of here the second
[00:02:52] biggest loser gets the uh sample pack
[00:02:55] out of that that's how we do that no uh
[00:02:58] the way I explained it there is
[00:03:00] hopefully that is uh clear should be
[00:03:02] actually in the uh description also
[00:03:04] there were 12 spots there are 10 left so
[00:03:07] that's how we do
[00:03:21] it kind of like a de and hit style I
[00:03:24] guess I like to do it that way that way
[00:03:26] everybody gets something you don't have
[00:03:28] to worry about people not getting
[00:03:30] anything you
[00:03:32] know s some some seller
[00:03:41] tools and we're going to run the
[00:03:45] spinner probably should just roll the
[00:03:46] dice from now on because I have my dice
[00:03:48] next to me number
[00:03:53] nine well well that's this one here
[00:03:56] second or
[00:03:57] L that'll be the giveaway one that we
[00:03:59] have out there but that's how we do our
[00:04:02] break I like doing that way because it
[00:04:04] um allows everybody to have a good
[00:04:06] chance of getting something and I'll put
[00:04:09] our giveaway card right
[00:04:12] here and then what I'm going to end up
[00:04:13] doing here when I finish my food I'm
[00:04:16] going to end up uh doing that with the
[00:04:19] rest of the break now as you can see 12
[00:04:21] spots 10 of them are left so that means
[00:04:24] there's only there's been two spots
[00:04:25] already taken
[00:04:48] web came off for a minute so I can just
[00:04:50] eat
[00:04:50] here yeah what do you
[00:04:52] think got 10 spots left pretty good one
[00:04:56] the reason why I like it the Biggest
[00:04:57] Loser is somebody's going to get
[00:04:58] something out of there generally big but
[00:05:00] the nice thing is whoever is The Biggest
[00:05:02] Loser will end up walking away with
[00:05:04] something this is the um Gravedigger
[00:05:07] graveyard
[00:05:12] overdrive oh you're saying the Tero gra
[00:05:18] deck oh I can't

[00:06:56] you want to jump
[00:06:58] in and we'll throw out another one here
[00:07:01] quickly that way if anybody else wants
[00:07:03] to jump in they
[00:07:09] can
[00:07:11] Gil there you go my friend
[00:07:13] there how's it going red hope you're
[00:07:16] having a good one you're very welcome my
[00:07:18] friend now do you not have a number
[00:07:19] between one and 10 that way I can know
[00:07:21] what our next one will be for our
[00:07:22] giveaway here then what we'll do is also
[00:07:25] get a
[00:07:27] um another thing out there running
[00:07:32] the purpose of this all right so the
[00:07:33] purpose of this is we will be opening
[00:07:35] these cards these are magic the
[00:07:36] Gathering and people like to play a card
[00:07:37] game kg now a lot of times what people
[00:07:41] like is to get a bunch of different
[00:07:42] cards from different sets but they can't
[00:07:43] buy a bunch of boxes or packs from
[00:07:45] different sets so we like to do these
[00:07:47] things where we breaks and we open a
[00:07:48] bunch of them from different sets and
[00:07:50] what we do is we give everybody that
[00:07:51] jumps in to purchase them the option of
[00:07:53] get potential of getting some of them so
[00:07:55] we put all their names there would be in
[00:07:57] this one 12 would go out here on cards
[00:08:01] and then what we do is we take all the
[00:08:02] common mythics Commons and uncom Commons
[00:08:06] and uncommons over $3 mythics and rares
[00:08:09] put them in sleeves and we shuffle them
[00:08:10] up and we hand them out to everyone kind
[00:08:12] so they all get a chance of getting
[00:08:13] everything um that way they can get a
[00:08:15] chance of getting some of everything and
[00:08:17] it's an NE and it's like a just as Fair
[00:08:18] as if you were going to open
[00:08:20] them like you know you're going to buy
[00:08:22] them yourself you get the same
[00:08:23] opportunity there other thing too is I
[00:08:25] do have stuff available people see over
[00:08:27] here you can see my finger pointing you
[00:08:29] can just go and buy packs you want too
[00:08:30] sometimes people like to do that and
[00:08:31] just buy like because they're like you
[00:08:33] know what I'll just buy like a bunch of
[00:08:34] packs of certain ones I want they do
[00:08:35] that we open them up for you guys
[00:08:37] sometimes people like to have that scen
[00:08:38] and be online for some reason and we
[00:08:41] have some fun doing it while talking
[00:08:42] hanging some hanging out having a little
[00:08:43] bit of fun in a community type thing and
[00:08:46] now what the reason why I do yway is
[00:08:48] that if you happen to get like no good
[00:08:50] cards we call the Biggest Loser if you
[00:08:52] get the no good cards out of that we
[00:08:54] give you the collector commander deck
[00:08:56] out of here and then the second biggest
[00:08:57] loser will get the sample pack that's in
[00:08:59] there
[00:09:00] that way you don't come out with like
[00:09:01] nothing the person that walked away with
[00:09:02] maybe maybe got really unlucky and got
[00:09:04] not much of
[00:09:06] anything that way I think it's try to
[00:09:08] try to make it a little bit as Fair as
[00:09:10] we can do
[00:09:11] it it's really what it is right there oh
[00:09:13] I'm back look at
[00:09:17] that so that's what we got going on
[00:09:22] now what am I going to do here
[00:09:27] is H
[00:09:30] let's
[00:09:31] do I was going to do something else here
[00:09:33] and I completely got sidetracked a
[00:09:35] minute
[00:09:37] ago there it is from
[00:09:41] before I got really sidetracked a second
[00:09:43] ago here oh and the other thing here
[00:09:45] that we like to do is when we do the big
[00:09:47] ones like this I know they're kind of
[00:09:48] weird card things here we give these
[00:09:50] things
[00:09:51] away saying thank you for joining

[00:09:58] you guys one of them since uh sometimes
[00:09:59] you like them these are just little fun
[00:10:01] things that have envelopes in them that

[00:10:06] could be anything

[00:14:12] because the whole point of what I was
[00:14:13] going to do this afternoon was to get
[00:14:14] this done because I had a couple things
[00:14:16] I wanted to do this
[00:14:17] morning so we're going to put these back
[00:14:19] out from everybody this morning that was
[00:14:21] in our morning one that was our our our
[00:14:24] quick break we do mini breaks in the
[00:14:27] morning normally I'm on a little long in
[00:14:29] the morning but I had a couple things I
[00:14:30] needed to do so we jumped off right
[00:14:32] earlier so I'm going to put this
[00:14:34] back for those of you that like to
[00:14:39] play I'm doing that earlier I don't know
[00:14:41] it's weird you guys like to do these but
[00:14:42] I mean like everybody likes to do these
[00:14:44] These are fun it's not weird I mean it's
[00:14:46] a good fun one because you guys get a
[00:14:48] good chance to getting everything Co but
[00:14:51] then we had some good luck this morning
[00:14:55] so what I'm going to do is those are
[00:14:56] everything from this morning
[00:14:59] that's everything you should be able to
[00:15:00] see at
[00:15:01] all there we go we're going to go on
[00:15:04] hand these
[00:15:09] out oh wow yeah I know that's crazy
[00:15:13] that's why I was that's why like
[00:15:15] um you
[00:15:18] know all right so this is what I have to
[00:15:20] say about that like the thing supposedly
[00:15:22] out
[00:15:23] before um Wizards allows it if Wizards
[00:15:27] allows it to be out say early on a
[00:15:29] certain date in a certain time if
[00:15:31] everyone needs to abide by that everyone
[00:15:33] should abide by that now if they don't
[00:15:35] if they're a seller of some kind that's
[00:15:37] a reseller somewhere well they don't
[00:15:39] really care if somebody's getting it
[00:15:41] again because it's going to get some
[00:15:42] hype for them that's really what it
[00:15:43] boils down to if they want to create
[00:15:46] some any honesty with any of it or
[00:15:48] Integrity in some ways what they would
[00:15:50] want to do is if they do have that yeah
[00:15:52] great there's some
[00:15:53] height but in some way shape or form be
[00:15:56] like have it in there that you know in
[00:15:58] certain things like it if it's open
[00:16:00] before a certain date say on the package
[00:16:02] they can stamp on it open before this
[00:16:04] date you can be fined certain amount of
[00:16:07] money that way people will think twice
[00:16:09] before doing
[00:16:12] it if that makes any
[00:16:16] sense I'm not answering anything like
[00:16:18] that Public Safety public crap going on
[00:16:21] in voting
[00:16:23] no nice got a box last night
[00:16:27] ordered hopefully my mine will be in
[00:16:32] um early so I'll have it on ear I should
[00:16:35] have it in in the morning on
[00:16:36] Friday for us so we can have our own
[00:16:39] things so that'll be
[00:16:41] fun for you all that would like to do
[00:16:43] some dusk M on Friday now like say like
[00:16:46] I understand some stores are allowed to
[00:16:48] being a store to do it like the
[00:16:50] pre-release the certain nights and then
[00:16:52] start it at that point on a certain
[00:16:53] night and there are some of the places
[00:16:55] on here that stick to that and I I find
[00:16:58] that to be
[00:17:00] very very honorable in that aspect on I
[00:17:03] do it earlier that's the only thing that
[00:17:05] catches me off it's little like yeah
[00:17:06] that's weird but hey they do what they
[00:17:08] want that's their thing I wouldn't try
[00:17:11] uh I
[00:17:12] personally
[00:17:14] wouldn't chance it I would put it out
[00:17:17] I'd go out on the date and time that
[00:17:20] um Wizards is telling us but that's
[00:17:26] me personally
[00:17:29] you
[00:17:34] know oh wow oh that's not bad that's
[00:17:38] decent not
[00:17:40] horrible it's decent though it's not a
[00:17:43] bad pick that's not a bad
[00:17:47] amount all
[00:17:53] right Fallout was a good one
[00:18:00] oh the
[00:18:02] GU the Matt thank you I was really
[00:18:05] confused at what you're were saying dude
[00:18:06] for a second the M yeah Fallout was a
[00:18:09] good one hey you should be uh we we play
[00:18:10] a little bit of a if you play Magic at
[00:18:12] all we do have our and we you like get
[00:18:14] packs of cards we do a little uh fallout
[00:18:17] themed Adventure
[00:18:19] game kind of like a D and D type thing
[00:18:21] if you play anything like
[00:18:25] that all right so that's everybody's
[00:18:27] stuffff
[00:18:29] the first one to jump in
[00:18:31] was our bu
[00:18:33] here
[00:18:38] Reuben well that's for you to get Bron
[00:18:40] well the thing is 50 shows and you get
[00:18:42] bronze for doing literally nothing and
[00:18:44] I'm on every day and that's in three
[00:18:47] months so that's out of like 90 days
[00:18:50] it's about half of the shows that's why
[00:18:52] I did that and that's you get literally
[00:18:54] that one thing and you get $2 for free
[00:18:56] so that's somebody that never show does
[00:18:57] anything never buys anything but they
[00:18:59] hang out and they jump in and just hang
[00:19:02] out all the time I have no problem with
[00:19:04] that uh but then that's why I put it low
[00:19:06] for the person that does buy something
[00:19:08] they get a uh they get a good they get a
[00:19:10] good thing to get bronze quickly on a
[00:19:12] low amount of stuff that's why I kind of
[00:19:14] gave it the way I did
[00:19:16] it yeah pretty much yeah exactly C
[00:19:20] franchi exactly oh the other one didn't
[00:19:22] run when I hit start dang it yeah
[00:19:25] exactly so like if they want if people
[00:19:27] want to come in and get $2 free I I
[00:19:28] don't have no problem with that but they
[00:19:30] have to hang out for a while if they
[00:19:31] want to do the um if somebody wants to

[00:21:25] want to check that place out see what

[00:30:41] is four all right we'll put a new one
[00:30:46] out since that wasn't a big hit we're
[00:30:49] going to replace it with another one
[00:30:50] that's like just a little little spe
[00:30:51] little common here nothing special but
[00:30:53] it's because there's the rare that's in
[00:30:54] there that you guys are hunting the rare
[00:31:06] alrighty
[00:31:09] now get all these here and the reason
[00:31:11] why I put them in the sleeves is when I
[00:31:12] shuffle them up and make sure they're
[00:31:14] all protected when we're shuffling them
[00:31:16] because for some I do a pretty good job
[00:31:17] with all everything we do because I've
[00:31:19] hand we've given out more than one card
[00:31:21] that we've uh We've ended up getting um
[00:31:23] either a 10 or 9.5 on and the 9.5 was uh
[00:31:27] PSA 9.5 was due to the the um the
[00:31:30] printing being off not even
[00:31:34] me yeah not more than pong
[00:31:37] though why is nobody got any um
[00:31:40] moderation things on there I swear I put
[00:31:42] you guys on
[00:31:43] there all right give me a
[00:31:47] minute why isn't everybody in here as uh
[00:31:50] with their your things there because I
[00:31:52] know you guys are supposed to have
[00:31:53] moderators lots and for some reason
[00:31:55] didn't put anyone in
[00:31:59] well I think uh no it was because it was
[00:32:02] an afternoon show it probably didn't
[00:32:04] copy everything over the same like it
[00:32:05] normally
[00:32:07] does I had to copy the show I'm guessing
[00:32:10] it didn't copy everything in the show
[00:32:12] just copied some of the stuff in the
[00:32:15] show so that's my thought process you
[00:32:18] have the power I have the
[00:32:24] power all right do this here nice we
[00:32:28] have another one of those spots being
[00:32:30] taken by Captain Rex let's see if
[00:32:32] anybody else wants to jump in on any of
[00:32:34] these breaks the
[00:32:36] spots ah I don't know if you can he's a
[00:32:39] moderator too you're gonna have to fight
[00:32:40] over that one I believe uh oh uh
[00:32:43] oh I think franie was uh oh was he was
[00:32:46] not made moderator are you sure I
[00:32:49] thought I hit AOW uh oh franie it's a
[00:32:51] battle
[00:32:53] now Branch's in here all the time
[00:32:55] hanging out I figured he he had the mod

[01:06:57] having pseudo seizures for a little
[01:06:58] while which means I my they weren't real
[01:07:00] they were just happening somehow they
[01:07:01] could see them happening but they
[01:07:02] weren't considering them real seizures
[01:07:04] until I came and I actually ended up
[01:07:06] moving to Florida down here and one of
[01:07:07] the doctors I ended up going to was an
[01:07:10] uh
[01:07:12] uh
[01:07:14] hematologist well the hematologist was
[01:07:16] like well you're having seizures because
[01:07:17] you had no oxygen in your brain that's
[01:07:19] why they weren't seeing him in the
[01:07:20] regular way that they would see seizures
[01:07:22] they and they weren't seeing them the
[01:07:23] same way it's because it was a lack of
[01:07:25] oxygen and they were ignoring the fact
[01:07:27] that your hemoglobin level was always
[01:07:29] exceptionally low so for a few years up
[01:07:32] in in New England some of the doctors
[01:07:34] like a they ignored me every time
[01:07:36] something happened you know you can't
[01:07:39] ever
[01:07:41] really can't ever really believe what's
[01:07:43] going on or say something what's going
[01:07:44] on you know it's one of those things
[01:07:45] it's hard to know Mr Fong calaminus tide
[01:07:49] so that's why like I
[01:07:52] said you can't ever really say yes or no
[01:07:55] on anything and I like to I I like to
[01:07:57] give people the benefit of Doubt just
[01:07:58] because I know for years I was having an
[01:08:01] issue and people ignored me saying there
[01:08:02] was nothing wrong and then come to find
[01:08:05] out oh there was something wrong there
[01:08:07] was actually something more wrong than
[01:08:08] what was going on in the first
[01:08:10] place I actually was losing I was having
[01:08:13] such a bad L lack of auction my body was
[01:08:16] actually shutting down because it was
[01:08:18] dying and they were ignoring it because
[01:08:21] they thought they were smarter than
[01:08:22] everyone else
[01:08:28] and that's what happens when you are
[01:08:30] book
[01:08:31] smart and you are
[01:08:34] not smart and wise when you think you
[01:08:39] are you think you're the smartest thing
[01:08:40] in the
[01:08:42] world you kill people because of
[01:08:51] that it's called
[01:08:53] um I think that used to be called uh
[01:08:56] what was
[01:08:59] that excessive
[01:09:02] Pride I it was excessive Pride I can't
[01:09:05] remember the exact word for it there
[01:09:06] used to be a word for it back in the
[01:09:13] day yeah that's not even books
[01:09:19] smart yeah I know my hemoglobin it was
[01:09:21] funny my hemoglobin was down to uh
[01:09:25] the lowest at one point when they saw me
[01:09:27] it was at like seven something but that
[01:09:29] was after I'd already had the seizures
[01:09:30] and supposedly I'd have like a loss of
[01:09:32] blood which would cause me to have
[01:09:34] seizures and then my body would kind of
[01:09:36] like heal the area enough so that my B
[01:09:38] blood would be able to raise back up
[01:09:40] while the hospital one time caught me
[01:09:41] down in Florida luckily where they
[01:09:43] caught me lower where I was at like six
[01:09:46] something so they sent me to the
[01:09:47] hospital but was still was it was got
[01:09:49] worse to the point that point that
[01:09:51] because the other place had ignored me
[01:09:52] so much that every time I said there was
[01:09:54] an issue they kept ignoring ignoring it
[01:09:56] point now when I got down here it
[01:09:57] actually got down to my heart was going
[01:09:59] to stop if I had fallen asleep they told
[01:10:02] me so hey what can you say that's why I
[01:10:06] say try to try not to try not to judge
[01:10:08] on things because you never really know
[01:10:09] what
[01:10:10] happens good afternoon monster how's it
[01:10:14] going I was just over here hanging
[01:10:18] out doing uh some deck
[01:10:22] building because I thought we were going
[01:10:24] to have a for some reason I was looking
[01:10:26] at the calendar of somebody a new store
[01:10:28] and I thought they had pre-release
[01:10:29] tonight well no it's not tonight it is
[01:10:31] next week and I had the calendar
[01:10:37] wrong so I am uh I figured why not build
[01:10:42] the nasgul deck that I've been planning
[01:10:43] on
[01:10:45] building so I have something fun to play
[01:10:48] this
[01:10:49] weekend and Commander night
[01:11:01] yeah exactly law school taught you that
[01:11:04] yeah see I've been in different jobs
[01:11:05] myself and I'm
[01:11:09] like what that's not
[01:11:12] right and I'm like I know I know I'm not
[01:11:15] your I don't know I have your like level
[01:11:16] of Education here but I mean I'm GNA
[01:11:18] make a comment that this may sound this
[01:11:20] may sound silly to you buddy but common
[01:11:23] sense says if you stick the fork in the
[01:11:25] electrical socket you're going to get
[01:11:27] electrocuted I don't understand that
[01:11:29] you're saying that if you hold that fork
[01:11:30] in the electrical socket you grab the
[01:11:33] cord um you're going to charge the
[01:11:35] blender far enough away so that'll run
[01:11:39] that doesn't seem like it's going to
[01:11:40] work but I I mean you're the scientist
[01:11:43] dude go
[01:11:48] on like that's the [ __ ] that I feel like
[01:11:50] I deal with some days like yes if you
[01:11:53] have a certain type of suit on you know
[01:11:55] that every the electricity runs around
[01:11:57] you not through you you know that might
[01:11:59] work
[01:12:01] but yeah
[01:12:06] anyways no wow that stinks I'm sorry
[01:12:10] about
[01:12:11] that see I had two of them tell me that
[01:12:14] before when I was first got down here
[01:12:16] because I had things in my liver and
[01:12:17] they ended up doing a biopsy and
[01:12:18] founding out it wasn't that actually I
[01:12:22] ended up being okay
[01:12:40] luckily luckily the reason for all the
[01:12:42] anemia was not that and it was a bleed
[01:12:46] they found
[01:12:49] somewhere that's what happens though
[01:12:51] sometimes like I said sometimes you just
[01:12:53] try to be got to be just appropriate
[01:12:55] respectful everyone you don't know what
[01:12:57] is going on in anyone's life if they
[01:12:59] actually are smarter than you or not
[01:13:01] like I'm going to some of the doctors
[01:13:03] they were smart they were definitely
[01:13:04] smart people they knew exactly what they
[01:13:05] were talking about but at the same time
[01:13:08] I was um I'm very smart person myself I
[01:13:10] was a Premed major and I would have
[01:13:12] probably went on further if my father
[01:13:13] hadn't died and I had done other stuff
[01:13:16] do different things in my life you know
[01:13:18] take care of people family and stuff
[01:13:20] like that
[01:13:22] that many ways whatever uh
[01:13:25] um so but that being
[01:13:29] said I know a lot and I'm like hey I
[01:13:32] come in and I say I know this about this
[01:13:33] hey what about this here there was this
[01:13:35] study on this blah blah blah and they're

[01:13:38] talking about on that and it's like you
[01:13:40] know what
[01:13:41] like sometimes I feel like I need to be
[01:13:44] here here is the paper that I'm
[01:13:46] referring to so that they look at this
[01:13:48] like you know scientific journal that
[01:13:50] I'm reading and like oh this guy
[01:13:52] actually has an idea of what he's
[01:13:53] talking about
[01:13:59] good welcome oh thank you you're very
[01:14:01] welcome Goron yeah sometimes the um if
[01:14:03] it it goes pwe shipping sometimes it
[01:14:05] takes a little bit to go in or if it's
[01:14:08] uh the holay sometimes it makes things
[01:14:10] last longer if it was a pwe one like say

[01:15:27] that huh intriguing was there like
[01:15:30] something weird going on that they did
[01:15:31] that because that's just a weird thing
[01:15:33] to randomly test someone for you
[01:15:37] know I don't think I'd randomly test
[01:15:39] someone for Lyme disease unless there
[01:15:40] was a reason for it you know what I
[01:15:44] mean
[01:15:52] n there's my other one here

[01:17:10] back last streaks
[01:17:26] all right that might be a might be have
[01:17:27] to find that card might have to find
[01:17:30] that
[01:17:44] one wow that's
[01:17:50] crazy that's crazy I would have been I'd
[01:17:53] be like uh yo you didn't tell me were

[01:17:58] for this
[01:17:59] here like I'm sorry but I I'm not going
[01:18:02] to pay for something you f and tell me
[01:18:09] about those are those scenarios where I
[01:18:12] actually have a hard time with anything
[01:18:16] like that because I'm sorry dude like I
[01:18:17] I I'm very upfront with things and I'm
[01:18:19] I'm like hey this is what's what's going

[01:18:24] they don't I'm like what are we testing
[01:18:25] for what are we doing this and they if
[01:18:26] they didn't tell me and that happened I
[01:18:29] would I would have lost my
[01:18:40] crap I might keep that one in there
[01:18:44] might need that one to put

[01:43:20] though oh oh hold on don't want cards
[01:43:23] sliding around in my books
[01:43:46] here looks like I'm going to find some
[01:43:49] other ones too a little bit probably
[01:43:54] I swear I an
[01:43:59] OP oh I might have one in these that
[01:44:01] might
[01:44:12] help Hope if I have any of these ones
[01:44:21] recently I have I might have it on

[01:44:27] work so I
[01:44:29] have some Outlaws
[01:44:32] here that we had opened I don't even
[01:44:34] realize we have a bunch of rares in here
[01:44:36] where the [ __ ] those things come
[01:44:40] from know I had those to go through
[01:44:43] these
[01:44:45] ones found these the other day it's like
[01:44:47] I went and open something and I stuffed
[01:44:48] them away when I was leaving and I
[01:44:50] forgot about them when we were leaving
[01:44:51] our house
[01:44:57] all right opt I think that's exactly
[01:44:59] what happened too so I'm going to have
[01:45:01] to do a I think I'm going to do a bulk
[01:45:03] the bulk box one
[01:45:05] day maybe that's what we'll do a box of
[01:45:07] bulk one

[01:45:28] them actually the 12 packs that are here
[01:45:31] we won't find
[01:45:33] one because we need
[01:45:43] it they probably have it somewhere else
[01:45:45] though I know it's always hiding when
[01:45:47] you need him
[01:46:04] righty I know I had him I've seen him
[01:46:07] before just have I seen it recently is
[01:46:10] the
[01:46:12] question it's only an uncommon so the
[01:46:15] chance of me finding the uncommon in

[01:49:37] process hey you got to walk around some
[01:49:39] bit
[01:49:40] yep all right you got to walk around
[01:49:42] some bit and get yourself moving helps
[01:49:45] out it definitely helps
[01:49:49] out now I have
[01:50:05] around
[01:50:06] here any kind of spell would
[01:50:09] do for me right
[01:50:19] now see if I have any counter spell just
[01:50:22] any counter spell just so I can use it
[01:50:25] for the time being I'm not going to get
[01:50:27] rid of that one ah counter
[01:50:29] spell
[01:50:38] Works got a counter
[01:50:44] spell ah I want this one
[01:50:48] instead there we go
[01:50:55] that's counter spell that's a counter
[01:50:57] spell to
[01:51:03] use oh yeah exactly yeah it will get
[01:51:05] better it's one of those things like you
[01:51:06] know my wife works in Orthopedics and um
[01:51:10] I I've been injured of myself that I
[01:51:12] know the pain of being after a surgery
[01:51:16] you have to get up and move and it's
[01:51:17] painful more because you're not moving
[01:51:19] and because you hadn't moved and because
[01:51:21] you had been so stiff and once you get
[01:51:23] your body moving it helps to get
[01:51:24] everything moving and healing right so
[01:51:27] that it doesn't heal in like a stiff
[01:51:30] position um so I don't know exactly on
[01:51:32] hips if it's the same but I know with
[01:51:34] like knees and I remember the people
[01:51:37] with hips having to get up and move
[01:51:38] around and stuff like that too
[01:51:43] so this is a commander

[02:04:08] on the break I don't know if it's
[02:04:09] exactly free but it's highly discounted
[02:04:17] shipping if it is not free so that's one
[02:04:20] of the cool things when we do our
[02:04:21] giveaways like this
[02:04:22] now one of the things that I've been
[02:04:24] trying to get to is I plan on doing once
[02:04:27] I think at the end of next week or the
[02:04:29] week after I will hit my ability to do
[02:04:32] members on YouTube and the way I was put
[02:04:36] on think I was saying planning on doing
[02:04:38] with the members on YouTube was between
[02:04:40] members and I think I can add my whatnot
[02:04:42] shot there if you guys were going to be
[02:04:43] members I was going to start doing some
[02:04:44] members only shows where we give away I
[02:04:48] was thinking what I would end up doing
[02:04:49] is get a like a a draft of some of a box
[02:04:53] of some kind I was going to give away
[02:04:55] those uh packs like the entire stream
[02:04:57] type thing because you guys are the
[02:04:59] members and you're hanging out with
[02:05:02] us at least that was kind of my thought
[02:05:04] process like a once a month do that and
[02:05:08] um and also when that's being given away
[02:05:10] it's also going to be like a discount
[02:05:12] for uh discounted shop day for everyone
[02:05:15] too at least that was kind of my thought
[02:05:17] process on the members thing what do you

[02:05:23] the uh for members Club oh going with

[00:25:14] something up intriguing here we made a
[00:25:17] uh little game the other
[00:25:21] day read the above message oh I missed
[00:25:23] something
[00:25:34] oh I like
[00:25:36] it I'll buy an extra that's a good one I
[00:25:39] can definitely do that I that's a good
[00:25:41] idea house and if anybody else gets one
[00:25:44] n I'm good with
[00:25:46] that I it's a good idea for
[00:25:50] um doing doing a spell table I like
[00:25:55] it I've been debating on doing that too
[00:25:57] I wanted do draft with some people and
[00:25:59] guys on spell table and I was thinking
[00:26:01] what we could do with draft is like say
[00:26:03] we have I'll literally we we'll get a
[00:26:04] box here but see that you got to pass
[00:26:06] the cards around but we'll have to do it
[00:26:08] a little different I guess we don't like
[00:26:10] we'll have to figure out our own version
[00:26:11] of it for an online version where it's
[00:26:12] just based out of the packs that you get
[00:26:14] kind of like a pre-release kit one I
[00:26:17] don't know that's the only thing I can
[00:26:18] think of what do you guys what do you
[00:26:20] think that that be
[00:26:21] fun yeah we can open build it and play
[00:26:23] together that's exactly what I was
[00:26:24] thinking yes great I love it I love it
[00:26:29] that's exactly what I was thinking to do
[00:26:31] on different things so it's awesome
[00:26:32] awesome we got these same uh same ideas
[00:26:36] here so let me put this back cuz no one
[00:26:39] wanted
[00:26:41] it put that out a little dessert
[00:26:45] beach only if there's umbr in it yep
[00:26:48] only if you have umras well each um or
[00:26:51] something that you can use like it right
[00:26:58] what I definitely s hit
[00:27:12] that why am I why am I not
[00:27:25] working uh at least one I'd say at least
[00:27:28] one so we can play
[00:27:30] together and then um after
[00:27:34] that it would be up to uh you uh you
[00:27:37] want to do because I think uh we could
[00:27:39] play playing together would be a good
[00:27:41] idea all right here we go on screen
[00:27:43] single coming out for you at instead of
[00:27:47] $7

[01:12:16] a goblin conduit la love I don't how to
[01:12:19] say your name shipping showing that much
[01:12:22] I let me f correct that then
[01:12:33] you
[01:12:34] go thank you my friend coming in and
[01:12:36] hanging out having a good one hey
[01:12:38] Jupiter how's it
[01:12:41] going it shouldn't say that much let me
[01:12:44] fix it well that's
[01:12:52] weird does it say that for everyone or
[01:12:55] is it just
[01:12:57] you because if You' bought if you g if
[01:13:00] you bought multiple things that might be
[01:13:04] why it's putting it together yeah you
[01:13:06] bought one of them and that's why when
[01:13:09] you get multiple they put it
[01:13:11] together so I think that's why it does
[01:13:13] it that
[01:13:15] way oh is you Squiggy yours is it
[01:13:21] expensive the shipping is expensive on
[01:13:23] that how much is the shipping
[01:13:31] interesting give me a second here that
[01:13:33] shouldn't be that
[01:13:54] way e
[01:14:42] okay that's so weird that it's doing
[01:14:44] that hold on let me try it again
[01:14:55] pain in the butt
[01:15:00] technology okay there should be
[01:15:08] that to still
[01:15:10] say let's do start the
[01:15:13] auction let me know if it does
[01:15:15] it not a problem no I appreciate
[01:15:20] it oh wow that sucks gring still
[01:15:27] why is it showing is now is anybody else
[01:15:29] have it showing expensive or is it just
[01:15:31] you for some
[01:15:33] reason I wonder if it's you you have it
[01:15:36] too Goran all
[01:15:38] right well that doesn't help um why is
[01:15:42] it doing it so high for the shipping
[01:16:16] you get two of them
[01:16:40] set increment
[01:16:43] weight there's
[01:16:47] that okay
[01:17:05] okay so let's see if this happens
[01:17:18] here how is it now
[01:17:26] yeah if you bought cars today and you
[01:17:28] want it it adds your total shipping
[01:17:31] until you hit Max which is $8 that is
[01:17:34] correct my Max is $8 like I've had on
[01:17:36] all of them correct so it looks like for
[01:17:38] whatever
[01:17:40] reason it was saying it was it was
[01:17:42] expensive for the sh shipping that's
[01:17:44] weird how it was doing that it wasn't
[01:17:46] doing it as like the Cheap shipping for
[01:17:47] some reason so I have to figure out
[01:17:49] what's going on on that one
[01:18:13] we'll see anyway Squiggy you got it my
[01:18:16] friend sorry about that I don't know
[01:18:18] what's going on I want to make sure it's
[01:18:20] right for everybody
[01:18:26] Squiggy coming in for that one I'll get
[01:18:29] that in top loader everything in a
[01:18:31] minute then um
[01:18:36] yeah I uh I change it to uh there's
[01:18:38] different profiles but for some reason
[01:18:40] the profile is like adding put was
[01:18:42] putting it
[01:18:44] weird yeah but you might have gotten the
[01:18:46] giveaway to have it I don't know
[01:18:47] sometimes weird I have to figure out
[01:18:50] why but anyways I was going through
[01:18:52] those now you I don't know if I have one
[01:18:54] of each
[01:18:55] uh doctor where I don't know
[01:18:57] specifically so we'll have to go to
[01:18:59] Doctor Who if you guys want it looking
[01:19:01] specifically at some point but I'm going
[01:19:02] to go into um at request here start
[01:19:07] going into some uh Lord of the Rings
[01:19:11] actually put out a spiteful banditry
[01:19:24] I showed you how to fix it that sucks
[01:19:26] that you can't get the other ones do
[01:19:30] it yeah it does strange how they do that
[01:19:33] I don't like how they do
[01:19:43] that there you go some L of the
[01:19:46] Rings for
[01:19:48] you if you want it that's $7
[01:19:52] card going up for six
[01:20:01] yeah yep I know what you're talking
[01:20:03] about
[01:20:04] exactly it' be nice but
[01:20:08] um they're not going to put as much
[01:20:10] effort as you'd like they don't care
[01:20:13] it's like I make money I'm good that's
[01:20:15] thing that's a little shitty about it
[01:20:17] here I'm trying to figure out how to get
[01:20:19] it to uh Go a different way but I think
[01:20:21] um The Tubes getting the tubes up there
[01:20:23] with our our our partners and our guys

[01:20:28] happening that helps me have some fun

[02:11:04] discount on your shipping not a
[02:11:06] problem big pipe yeah where the te comes
[02:11:09] up this is broken I know I told you we
[02:11:12] need to cut it out I know I can't get
[02:11:14] the I can't get the female piece
[02:11:16] unscrewed without more muscle I don't
[02:11:18] have muscle we have to cut all the way
[02:11:20] but so this goes up and there's two Tes
[02:11:23] that go out like this correct a big huge
[02:11:25] yes the big one inch pipes okay so so
[02:11:27] what so what we need to do is cut the
[02:11:29] one inch one here cut it there on the
[02:11:33] other and put a new te and and glue them
[02:11:35] in with the purple stuff and then have
[02:11:37] the that come out for our whole new one
[02:11:39] that comes out to the bottom one because
[02:11:40] you can't unscrew this whole thing is
[02:11:42] brittle your dad keeps your dad was
[02:11:44] trying to replace a brittle thing and I
[02:11:45] told him you need to need to cut it out
[02:11:47] put a new one in because this kept
[02:11:48] cracking so you just put the new top on
[02:11:50] it which is why this broke again so we
[02:11:51] need to cut that other piece out in the
[02:11:53] middle so it goes up to the T to that so
[02:11:55] what I just need to know is that I need
[02:11:56] a new T that's the big pipe that has
[02:11:59] goes to a little pipe correct so you
[02:12:02] need the little pipe this whatever this
[02:12:04] goes this should go into like a A
[02:12:06] fitting here that screws into it right
[02:12:07] it's a t it's a t fitting all right yeah
[02:12:09] that t fitting you need that t fitting
[02:12:11] all right and we're going to need some
[02:12:13] extra pipe so that we can put a like
[02:12:16] like cut the T fitting needs
[02:12:19] a yeah we should need to cut it off but
[02:12:22] um we might need a little bit of extra
[02:12:23] pipe to make the te fitting so it will
[02:12:25] fit inside of
[02:12:27] it a mail connector for both sides that
[02:12:30] way if kind no you don't need a mail
[02:12:32] connector you just it just glues in yeah
[02:12:34] the mail connector the yeah M te yeah
[02:12:38] big to little yep and then whatever
[02:12:39] things is scw in there and then
[02:12:41] obviously that pipe yeah because we I
[02:12:44] was saying that that plastic thing
[02:12:45] that's cracked there was brittle it
[02:12:47] didn't look good every time you touched
[02:12:48] it it was wobbling and it looked like
[02:12:49] there was even a crack in it so I was
[02:12:51] like let's get rid of it and cut it out
[02:12:52] but we just cut he just cut the top off
[02:12:54] and put the other thing on this is

[02:45:59] bit
[02:46:01] here Cathedral
[02:46:03] accolate estd
[02:46:05] yes thank you for making sure I said
[02:46:08] that four o'clock Eastern
[02:46:10] Time 4 P PM eastern Time is what we're
[02:46:12] doing that
[02:46:17] correct now we're going to do Accolade
[02:46:20] of aots out here or there if you want
[02:46:26] it there we
[02:46:40] go some Fallout ones
[02:46:44] coming we do have four people but what
[02:46:47] I'm going to plan on doing is I'm going
[02:46:48] to go for like two hours unless the game
[02:46:51] goes overly long for like three hours or
[02:46:53] whatever then we'll finish one game but
[02:46:55] if it go three to five hours or just do
[02:46:57] the one game try to cut it off at one
[02:46:59] point but two hours is what my plan was
[02:47:01] so like 400 to 6 PM eastern time and if
[02:47:04] we end up winning or somebody wins or
[02:47:06] somebody loses I'm G to do um whoever
[02:47:08] wins will be able to stay and then the
[02:47:10] other two if we have two more people
[02:47:12] waiting one will get switched out and
[02:47:13] I'll do like a like a wheel type thing
[02:47:15] to see who gets pulled
[02:47:16] in and you can't get pulled in if you've
[02:47:19] already played you can't come in twice
[02:47:20] so it's going to be like kind of like
[02:47:22] that so hey good morning tangarine how
[02:47:23] you doing my friend so I don't know if
[02:47:25] that's intriguing to you all or not
[02:47:34] but yeah doesn't look like the check-ins
[02:47:37] are working right that is so
[02:47:43] weird I wonder if I can like
[02:47:45] artificially inflate them
[02:47:53] or do I need to put the maybe I put the
[02:47:55] time
[02:48:14] later I know we'll see
[02:48:24] ah I see what's going on since the time
[02:48:27] that I put it up I'll have to figure
[02:48:28] that out later all right so I'm have to
[02:48:30] figure it out later I'm have to do all
[02:48:31] right so I have to get these running
[02:48:32] before anybody starts doing check-ins
[02:48:34] and then it picks them all up on screen
[02:48:37] so if you do a checkin now I think
[02:48:38] that'll show
[02:48:42] up
[02:48:44] ah so the
[02:48:46] man coming in with a well look at that

[04:33:05] days been bored like we need to make
[04:33:08] something
[04:33:09] new we're going to be playing something
[04:33:12] regularly here this one seemed like a
[04:33:14] good fun
[04:33:15] one kids thought it would work well
[04:33:18] since we're going to be on a boat too
[04:33:19] traveling around they're like we can do
[04:33:21] this on the boat it makes sense that

[05:09:37] have to take
[05:09:42] [Music]
[05:09:49] we now that
[05:09:52] pirate let's find a
[05:09:55] map all right you got to travel and
[05:09:57] figure out where that map
[05:10:03] goes it looks like it goes to an
[05:10:07] island now
[05:10:14] what it would do is you would buy one of
[05:10:18] these here and You' pull it out we're
[05:10:20] going to have to I'm showing you guys
[05:10:21] because I'm probably going to have to do
[05:10:22] this tomorrow because it's getting late
[05:10:23] and would pull it out we'd have look at
[05:10:25] that you get your booster in there but
[05:10:26] these cards here going zoom in so this
[05:10:29] will give you a Bo a Beyond booster of
[05:10:32] Assassin's Creed but these cards here
[05:10:33] you would now have a shield all right
[05:10:36] scratchies off to go against your
[05:10:37] encounters
[05:10:39] there's multiple encounters per location
[05:10:42] per Island we have seven different
[05:10:44] Islands we're going to beat the boss
[05:10:45] finally if we get to beat the boss at
[05:10:47] the end I will start a secret lair for a
[05:10:50] dollar if we able to beat the entire
[05:10:52] boss in one
[05:10:57] day good luck house good luck house so
[05:11:01] for those of you that are paying
[05:11:03] attention the ceilings are going to be
[05:11:05] these they'll have a number written on
[05:11:07] some of these cards there and these are
[05:11:09] all ceilings these are all really really
[05:11:10] high here all uh way above that and
[05:11:13] they're going to end up going out for
[05:11:15] $17 for one of the polls out of these
[05:11:19] think that's what I had that as because
[05:11:22] thing that happens now
[05:11:26] is we build up all right we build up
[05:11:31] because the next one the next pull
[05:11:33] box will
[05:11:36] have it's going to be still $17
[05:11:40] but if we beat through the 35 encounters
[05:11:43] here the first one the first pull box of
[05:11:45] 35 we get through that the next one goes
[05:11:48] out and it's going to be all these and
[05:11:49] it's still going to be $17 but thing is
[05:11:53] that we're going to have some of these
[05:11:55] singles mixed in too and then if we
[05:11:58] happen to beat those
[05:12:01] 25 counters which you just pulling just
[05:12:04] pull box
[05:12:06] there pulling 25 items from there
[05:12:11] we
[05:12:14] get
[05:12:15] $17 I will be
[05:12:18] running these at
[05:12:22] $17 plus some of the
[05:12:27] uh some of the
[05:12:31] um

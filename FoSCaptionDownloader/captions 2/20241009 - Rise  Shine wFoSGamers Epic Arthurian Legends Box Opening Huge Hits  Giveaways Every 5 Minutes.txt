[02:23:09] I'm not a giant fan I just make a few of
[02:23:10] them that people might like things that
[02:23:12] I would be okay with and be like all
[02:23:13] right
[02:23:15] here I'll throw those out there like I
[02:23:17] build them the way that I wouldn't feel
[02:23:18] like I'm getting screwed continuously if
[02:23:20] that Mak makes any sense at
[02:23:22] all like most of the time there's a good
[02:23:24] chance if you say going like three or
[02:23:25] four times you'll get your money's worth
[02:23:28] back um is really really what it blows
[02:23:30] down to try how to how I try to
[02:23:33] mathematically do
[02:23:34] it all right here we go everyone well
[02:23:38] let's do some more uh we had that there
[02:23:41] we had the Wake so we'll throw the
[02:23:42] Wednesday one out so I'll run that one
[02:23:44] at a little discount so you can see what
[02:23:46] that one was that's the bloomo one there
[02:23:47] that I just showed
[02:23:48] you there you go if you'd like to try
[02:23:53] that these need to disappear cuz I
[02:23:56] deleted those I thought I deleted those
[02:23:58] I don't know why those keep coming back
[02:24:00] if you want to try that or maybe you
[02:24:02] want to go with the sorcery one now
[02:24:04] we're going to edit this and we're just
[02:24:05] call it sorcery pole
[02:24:17] box all right
[02:24:25] um that
[02:24:31] or we
[02:24:41] go all
[02:24:45] right here you go I want to make a
[02:24:47] change
[02:24:48] there then run that one if you want to
[02:24:50] try that you can always try the sorcery
[02:24:52] on
[02:24:53] too and then what I'm going to do should
[02:24:56] we open up
[02:24:57] anymore now I have a question for you
[02:24:59] all now tomorrow I wanted to know what
[02:25:02] was in this anybody have any idea what's
[02:25:04] in here the draft kit because I was
[02:25:06] thinking of playing I wanted to do
[02:25:08] something like this now do we just open
[02:25:09] this up wi see it says supports draft
[02:25:12] and sealed
[02:25:13] events my thought process is this is
[02:25:17] like if we have a group of people
[02:25:18] together and we were going to be playing
[02:25:20] as a draft everybody needs something
[02:25:22] from here is that accurate or is it just
[02:25:24] like this gives
[02:25:26] information that's what I've been trying
[02:25:27] to figure out and I'm just going to open
[02:25:29] up just anyways just because I want to
[02:25:30] look at it while I get them just so I uh
[02:25:33] because I have one more a couple more of
[02:25:35] them and I want to play anyways I want
[02:25:36] to understand and look at it a little
[02:25:37] bit I know it's probably stupid of me
[02:25:39] probably doesn't matter but I'm a I'm a
[02:25:41] curious person and sometimes you know
[02:25:44] curiosi killed the cat type thing
[02:25:45] whatever whatever you
[02:25:48] know I'm I'm still here so far
[02:25:52] right I'm pretty sure I know what like
[02:25:54] it's just going to be the same it's
[02:25:55] always going to be like the same things
[02:25:56] or whatever but I don't know what is in
[02:25:57] here at all so here you go you'll need
[02:26:01] one draft kit for four player draft all
[02:26:03] right four players up to four up to two
[02:26:06] or two for up to eight players also need
[02:26:10] three booster packs per player in about
[02:26:13] three hours to complete the draft and
[02:26:15] play a few games all right everyone sits
[02:26:16] around table each player opens let me
[02:26:19] zoom in a little bit more so we can read
[02:26:20] it
[02:26:22] better here we
[02:26:24] go all right everyone sits around the
[02:26:26] table each player opens one booster pack
[02:26:28] and secretly keeps a single card then
[02:26:31] they pass the remaining cards the player
[02:26:33] to the left players continue picking
[02:26:35] cards until N Them remain everyone opens
[02:26:38] the second pack and
[02:26:40] repeats this time passing to the right
[02:26:43] and for the last one they go to left
[02:26:44] again all right so there you go how you
[02:26:46] draft now why are these needed
[02:26:50] after all cards have been drafted
[02:26:52] players get to build their
[02:26:54] decks one Avatar either the Spell
[02:26:57] slinger supplied in this pack or any
[02:27:00] Avatar they drafted a spell book or at
[02:27:03] least 24 of the Spells they drafted
[02:27:05] which can ignore Rarity restrictions
[02:27:11] oh well that's intriguing drafting you
[02:27:15] don't have Rarity Rarity
[02:27:18] restrictions that's pretty cool
[02:27:20] an atlas of 12 sights using any form any
[02:27:24] from this pack to supplement those they
[02:27:26] drafted all right that's intriguing so
[02:27:29] they get some spell Slingers so there's
[02:27:31] four of them if they don't get any
[02:27:32] avatars all right I get it then we have
[02:27:36] our atlases so that people have a bunch
[02:27:38] of them if they need
[02:27:40] them Valley all right all right so
[02:27:44] that's what's in here I wanted to just
[02:27:45] look myself and look at them I know I
[02:27:48] could have looked online but I'm like I
[02:27:49] have them coming in I'm just going to be
[02:27:51] I'm going to be curious and do it myself
[02:27:53] it's not going to ruin anything they're
[02:27:55] here if I play we'll have them still
[02:27:57] available to play it's not like I
[02:28:00] won't stream oh the art on them are so
[02:28:02] nice
[02:28:05] though the art there you go all right
[02:28:08] that's what that is all right that's how
[02:28:09] you draft there I like that I like the
[02:28:12] um I will have to admit I like the uh
[02:28:16] ignore the Rarity that's pretty cool
[02:28:21] all
[02:28:22] right now that I know how to
[02:28:26] draft Let's uh put that back over
[02:28:31] here I picked up one of those I picked
[02:28:34] some of them a couple of them from our
[02:28:35] buddy there and they got another couple
[02:28:37] from a bunch of boxes from some another
[02:28:38] location hey how's it going
[02:28:43] Mahaya how you doing
[02:28:46] buddy we'll do um we'll do another one
[02:28:49] of these
[02:28:51] maybe you'd like some beta we'll run
[02:28:54] this one for
[02:29:07] you all right let me do this oh why did
[02:29:10] it just do
[02:29:13] that all right let me do this I'm going
[02:29:15] to pin these at the top so people can
[02:29:16] see them easier
[02:29:23] sometimes it's hard to see
[02:29:25] them so I'm going to put those and
[02:29:27] update the number on it well the name
[02:29:31] how you doing down there in
[02:29:33] um
[02:29:36] taxis we were thinking of buying a piece
[02:29:38] of land down in
[02:29:40] Texas what this is what I'll do we're
[02:29:42] going to run these we're going to drop
[02:29:43] the price on these for for
[02:29:46] today for the
[02:29:48] release like we did on the other ones
[02:29:52] there there we go there we go there we
[02:29:55] go pinned right at the top now you can
[02:29:56] see them if you want
[02:29:58] them and we'll run through some of our
[02:30:01] other stuff now we did some of those we
[02:30:05] had the other one box we're debating on
[02:30:06] opening
[02:30:22] all right here what the hell is
[02:30:26] that pull the Benjamin out again we're
[02:30:29] going to start doing some of our
[02:30:30] adventure game a little bit that's what
[02:30:31] we're going to do we're going to zoom
[02:30:32] out I zoom all the way out these are our
[02:30:33] Benjamins so you are aware things that
[02:30:36] come in those those gold envelopes are
[02:30:38] things like maybe you got a baseball
[02:30:40] pack cards all right maybe
[02:30:45] got something silly
[02:30:47] like one of these things
[02:30:51] that could be in there that might be in
[02:30:53] there there are silly silly stuff as you
[02:30:56] can see silly silly stuff in here but
[02:31:00] maybe that's what's in there who knows
[02:31:02] baseball cards
[02:31:03] from anywhere from the 80s to the
[02:31:05] [Music]
[02:31:09] um I think it was early late 90s maybe I
[02:31:14] can't remember but what we got going on
[02:31:17] there is you get one of those Benjamins
[02:31:20] when we play our game if you would like
[02:31:21] to play the adventure
[02:31:26] game let's see if I have it done right
[02:31:28] let me highlight it copy that and I want
[02:31:31] to make sure it's set up right I don't
[02:31:33] be writing stuff incorrectly in here
[02:31:50] all
[02:31:53] right there we
[02:32:00] go here we go so this is our little our
[02:32:03] Wasteland Adventure we're going to get
[02:32:04] this up so you guys get to see
[02:32:06] it all
[02:32:08] right currently I believe our character
[02:32:10] actually we had one already
[02:32:14] built not that one we're going to
[02:32:16] minimize that I did minimize you I said
[02:32:18] minimize
[02:32:20] there we
[02:32:24] go I did definitely say minimize
[02:32:32] there not that
[02:32:38] sheet ah there we are here is our
[02:32:42] character that we had let's get two them
[02:32:44] I just need to get them set up correctly

[02:33:13] built there ready we had built this
[02:33:16] character the other day Dave Nukem those

[02:33:20] with him yes I know this is interesting
[02:33:21] what are you doing here what are you
[02:33:22] talking about stats associated with a
[02:33:24] character come on that seems weird all
[02:33:26] right but anyways no it's because we
[02:33:28] were playing a little Adventure game we
[02:33:31] were traveling around our
[02:33:33] character Wasteland we were having some
[02:33:35] fun now the way we do that is we do some

[00:12:34] let's see what we get for luck
[00:12:36] today let's see what we get for luck
[00:12:38] today one of those fell out didn't want
[00:12:39] to stay in there are we going to get one
[00:12:42] of our big hits starting in the morning
[00:12:44] I think we're going to start we started
[00:12:45] with the right side box I think we're
[00:12:47] going go with the left side
[00:12:49] box now remember everybody we got to go
[00:12:52] out of cool stuff you can even get your
[00:12:53] own mon Horizon 3 we got a bunch of it
[00:12:55] in here so I'm going to pin that if you
[00:12:57] want it
[00:13:01] father or son um my son and I were the
[00:13:04] ones that were starting this my son and
[00:13:06] I will and uh he was on here hanging out
[00:13:08] with me for a while when we were first
[00:13:10] doing it only it was him or I that were
[00:13:12] like opening packs then whatnot yelled
[00:13:14] at me and said he is not allowed to open
[00:13:16] the packs you're going to be in trouble
[00:13:17] for that and we'll suspend you if he
[00:13:18] does that again I'm like are are you
[00:13:20] kidding me he's just cutting he's
[00:13:21] opening the pack and reading the cards
[00:13:23] with us nobody has a problem with it
[00:13:25] actually people are liking it that's why
[00:13:26] that's part of the reason why we started
[00:13:28] it but but uh yeah so they complained
[00:13:31] about that we had to change it now
[00:13:33] actually oh we do have some way we can
[00:13:35] change it though no one can complain now
[00:13:37] if they are allowed to participate and
[00:13:39] do things as long as they are not
[00:13:40] opening stuff so if I cut the pack open
[00:13:43] and they pull the cards out and read it
[00:13:45] that is considered me opening the pack
[00:13:47] so if people want to do stuff like that
[00:13:48] we can always do that
[00:13:51] too like you know what William do you
[00:13:53] want to open a pack now and see if you

[00:29:44] loader in one of these just a white

[00:29:58] we have a pearl Medallion in

[00:30:02] little while and see what we
[00:30:05] get it is on the wrong shipping let me
[00:30:07] correct that that might be a problem
[00:30:09] here let me correct that
[00:30:12] shipping ah so on Singles shipping all
[00:30:16] right let me see what's going on here
[00:30:18] singles on the
[00:30:22] shipping start auction there you go try
[00:30:26] that is it on the right shipping now
[00:30:27] that should be
[00:30:31] better now if it isn't for you it might
[00:30:33] be your location somebody else check if
[00:30:36] it is H if you sell the same high one if
[00:30:38] somebody else you don't mind checking
[00:30:39] because for me it's just going to keep
[00:30:40] saying the same price because where I am
[00:30:41] is going to say
[00:30:42] nothing all right Neo oh cool thank you
[00:30:45] yeah all right it's the same maybe it's
[00:30:47] something because of where you are in
[00:30:49] Ohio because that's weird that is really
[00:30:52] weird it must be you and where you live
[00:30:55] Ohio must suck for the Post Office
[00:30:58] that's all I gotta
[00:31:01] say uh oh no if you got the Gibby that
[00:31:05] could be why but it would be your you're
[00:31:07] it would be um it adds it up and it ends
[00:31:09] up being discounted for your shipping so
[00:31:12] it should be okay that's interesting
[00:31:14] that's interesting that's saying that it
[00:31:16] might be adding it to it that's why and
[00:31:18] you won't be paying that because you're
[00:31:19] going to take off um you'll be taking
[00:31:22] off uh 88 cents from it oh I didn't put
[00:31:26] that wooded Foothills out let's put that
[00:31:28] wooden Foothills out
[00:31:33] possibly but generally it takes the
[00:31:35] discounted price off that not get adding
[00:31:37] it to you you might want to ask what's
[00:31:39] going uh ask whatnot if there's a weird

[00:57:27] that's one of the ones I know I have
[00:57:29] like all the flares for the most
[00:57:32] part
[00:57:35] um I just need to find
[00:57:41] it because I got so
[00:57:44] many got so
[00:57:53] much all right oh Castle wanted that one
[00:57:55] that was a good pickup too right there
[00:57:59] Castle all right let me
[00:58:01] do these here let's see if these ones
[00:58:10] here flare of
[00:58:13] cultivation I thought I had ah flare of
[00:58:15] denial there we go I know I have flare
[00:58:17] Denial in
[00:58:21] there knew I had it in there now I have
[00:58:26] a couple versions of flare denial I have
[00:58:28] this version of flare denial or that
[00:58:30] version of flare denial which one do you
[00:58:32] want my
[00:58:36] friend I have Mr house from Fallout the
[00:58:39] full art one all right now you got this
[00:58:42] my friend Castle I like that we'll put
[00:58:44] that in
[00:58:45] a little thing with your name on it over
[00:58:48] here
[00:58:51] Castle now I think after you pick up the
[00:58:54] next one it's going to end up
[00:58:55] automatically going into
[00:58:57] tracking but we'll put this one out here
[00:59:00] the full art
[00:59:01] flare there you
[00:59:07] go there we go
[00:59:11] 326 it's not a foil not a foil of the
[00:59:14] full art this is not a foil it is
[00:59:16] basic now I'm going to run this one
[00:59:19] because it doesn't allow me to run it
[00:59:20] when it is $20 it has to go at um the
[00:59:23] price the one that has tracking so just
[00:59:25] so where it's going to have tracking but
[00:59:27] that means all your stuff will have
[00:59:28] tracking now for the most part that's
[00:59:30] pretty much what that means there we
[00:59:35] go if it hits $20 it's required to do
[00:59:38] the run with tracking but all of them
[00:59:39] will end up having it in the end
[00:59:41] anyways because you do it
[00:59:46] now there you go that's a basic one
[00:59:49] there there we go on that
[00:59:56] pull mine out there you

[01:18:55] the running quick to get everything done
[01:18:56] like some of them may be you know where

[01:19:07] they doing that's getting 400 people in
[01:19:09] there and they're doing like different
[01:19:11] things that I can't do but at the same
[01:19:13] time I'm looking at it I'm like they're
[01:19:15] not even showing the cards they're like
[01:19:17] oh here's one card goodbye and go on to
[01:19:19] the next thing I'm like that doesn't
[01:19:20] even seem that fun but all right but
[01:19:22] that's me that's my personal my personal
[01:19:27] thing personally that's me but you know
[01:19:31] hey my personal opinion on things is not
[01:19:33] what everybody else is you know people
[01:19:35] like certain things it's not you like
[01:19:37] your thing it's all that matters people
[01:19:39] like their

[02:20:07] actually going to sell my boat this
[02:20:08] afternoon possibly so that'll be a nice
[02:20:12] one you know m3c well my small boat and
[02:20:15] then we can go look at a big
[02:20:17] boat ah that'll be a nice one the big
[02:20:20] boat there's a nice one available that
[02:20:21] we're looking at hopefully we're
[02:20:22] crossing our fingers on well the one
[02:20:25] that we're the size that I have right
[02:20:26] now is a 23 and a half foot it's a
[02:20:27] sailfish it's a twin twin 115 Motors uh
[02:20:31] so nice it's nice boat but
[02:20:34] um we want we're going to uh hopefully
[02:20:36] there's a 42 foot 41 foot uh Lagoon
[02:20:40] catamaran that we're looking at and
[02:20:41] there's also a 54 foot Jano saleboat
[02:20:45] we're looking
[02:20:47] at I uh
[02:20:49] 43,000 for it 43,000 for it hey the guy
[02:20:53] with a face likes
[02:20:56] this we'll pick that one up yeah it's
[02:20:58] out for 43,000 it's on there for
[02:21:01] everybody else has them on for like 50
[02:21:02] something and I guess like I've had like
[02:21:05] a lot of people interested because I'm
[02:21:06] like I just pretty much I want to get
[02:21:07] back when I paid for it and put into it
[02:21:09] and I don't want to raise the price
[02:21:10] ridiculous I you know I just throw this
[02:21:12] out there you see the prices of these
[02:21:14] things somebody bought some of these
[02:21:15] things and that boat when it was
[02:21:16] initially bought back when it was bought
[02:21:18] was
[02:21:19] not a uh
[02:21:22] was not a that probably was got bought
[02:21:23] for close to the money that it was I
[02:21:26] bought it for which was like the 50,000
[02:21:28] so with that being said like they
[02:21:31] probably bought it at that originally
[02:21:32] and made their money
[02:21:39] back a face the guy with a face so I
[02:21:43] don't want to like raise my price and
[02:21:45] screw people so like I don't like I
[02:21:47] don't know it just seems like it seems
[02:21:49] we more than pay for it but I guess that
[02:21:52] could be you know that's uh that's
[02:21:53] capitalism
[02:21:59] right 2500 oh nice 20 feet nice that's a

[03:00:25] as check in uh just for some reason
[03:00:28] chicken
[03:00:31] works so you type slash checkin as all
[03:00:34] one word you get to check in and what
[03:00:36] happens is the more check-ins is the
[03:00:38] larger we do for here here here here you
[03:00:40] go here we go
[03:00:46] ready there you go
[03:00:49] see that's what happens when we check
[03:00:50] our goals when you do check-ins if we
[03:00:52] get that many check-ins that's what ends
[03:00:54] up happening we end up getting some good
[03:00:56] deals on all things and you guys get to
[03:00:58] uh have some fun yes so what we end up
[03:01:01] doing is uh we end up upgrading our um
[03:01:05] our
[03:01:06] giveaways based on how many check-ins we
[03:01:09] have yes so that's how that works so if
[03:01:13] you guys check in and we get to uh a
[03:01:16] certain amount of check-ins our giveaway
[03:01:18] grows to a larger one at the end of the

[04:10:00] our big hits you guys are going to have
[04:10:02] to let me know at the end of the stream

[04:10:15] get here I'm gonna move my phone so I
[04:10:17] can there we go breathe your
[04:10:23] last uh it shouldn't be because you got
[04:10:28] multiple things I think it's just saying
[04:10:29] that's the total price of it minus
[04:10:31] whatever I what you've gotten already
[04:10:33] breathe your last gift of the Viper
[04:10:36] serum Visionary bful landscape consigned

[04:10:44] oh that's a nice little hit right there

[04:11:26] foil mh3
[04:11:28] 336 with my alzi
[04:11:36] token nice you got to 11 two that's
[04:11:38] interesting the Oblivion it shouldn't be
[04:11:40] that um the shipping shouldn't be that
[04:11:42] much because because uh with the
[04:11:44] giveaways it takes it away from it I
[04:11:45] think that's the total price of the
[04:11:47] shipping minus whatever you have gotten
[04:11:49] for giveaways So like um you know if you
[04:11:52] go and you look at uh hold on a second
[04:11:55] let me uh let me do something for you
[04:11:58] quickly so
[04:12:00] Oblivion let me find your name
[04:12:05] here so you've gotten multiple giveaways
[04:12:08] so that's what's going on right now
[04:12:10] currently the shipping for me is two a
[04:12:14] dollar and like 30 cents is what I paid
[04:12:15] for the shipping for you so I think what
[04:12:17] it is is uh yeah it might be saying it's
[04:12:20] higher because you've gotten a few of
[04:12:21] the giveaways there maybe that's the
[04:12:22] only thing I can think of well the loot
[04:12:24] box is going to make it be that one
[04:12:25] anyways because the loot box is a higher
[04:12:27] shipping no matter
[04:12:28] what hey 850 nerd oh we got you coming
[04:12:32] in you know what we were about to start
[04:12:34] a giveaway here because firewi one and

[04:13:05] well
[04:13:09] um that's interesting that it's for the
[04:13:11] single card as well I I'd have to check

[04:14:19] know why it would be doing that for
[04:14:21] you my guess is that

[04:14:50] shipping and $2 for that foil wheel of
[04:14:55] potential now plain white envelope just
[04:14:57] means you get one of these shipped to

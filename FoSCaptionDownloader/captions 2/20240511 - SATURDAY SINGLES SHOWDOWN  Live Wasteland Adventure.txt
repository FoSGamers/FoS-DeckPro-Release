[00:30:11] was a really good pack
[00:30:17] there um oh it might have been a mistake
[00:30:20] there um and that was the pricing I put
[00:30:23] out a little while ago too that was a
[00:30:24] couple days old I might need to update
[00:30:25] that uh because things fluctuate so much
[00:30:28] but that is a few days old and that
[00:30:30] actually was the pricing of it when it
[00:30:31] was uh when I put that on there like I
[00:30:34] don't know the few days ago that I put
[00:30:35] it on there because I was actually
[00:30:36] taking all the pricing right off of a
[00:30:37] TCG actually doing a little bit lower
[00:30:39] than the TCG price because I don't like
[00:30:41] I don't like putting it as high as some
[00:30:43] of those ones or I thought that was a
[00:30:44] little ridiculous some of them were like
[00:30:45] H hundred and some OD dollars at that
[00:30:47] time but if You' like um let me take a
[00:30:49] look again if you want one of them and

[00:30:53] and we can uh we can get that figured
[00:30:55] out for you because if that's one you're
[00:30:56] looking for I know things FL
[00:30:58] and I have that's why I like to do the

[02:20:55] all right you know what I might just
[02:20:57] need to uh change up how I do some of
[02:20:59] that and I'll have to maybe have since
[02:21:01] the show notes don't come out very
[02:21:03] easily because they block them which is
[02:21:05] kind of silly that they block them when
[02:21:08] you're doing giveaways there's no point
[02:21:09] of even having show notes at that point
[02:21:11] I wonder if that's why I got in
[02:21:14] trouble because the show notes were
[02:21:16] hidden which should explained all the
[02:21:18] rules and everything that was in there
[02:21:20] when I had giveaways running that is oh
[02:21:23] those mother I know what happened those
[02:21:27] mother
[02:21:31] oh that's
[02:21:34] [ __ ] thank you thank you guys I know
[02:21:38] why I got in trouble giveaways when
[02:21:41] they're running the notes are hidden
[02:21:43] when the notes are hidden they can't see
[02:21:45] everything that I show them for being
[02:21:47] much available as the highs and the lows
[02:21:48] and the averages cuz there's no notes
[02:21:50] available so the person said they
[02:21:52] couldn't see the notes which wasn't a
[02:21:53] lie but I had them available but they're
[02:21:56] hidden when I do giveaways so I got
[02:21:58] [ __ ] by whatnot sorry for yelling at
[02:22:00] you guys I know I wasn't yelling at
[02:22:02] you where where was the notes they told
[02:22:06] me they can't see the notes when the
[02:22:08] giveaway is
[02:22:10] up oh wow that's ridiculous I'm sorry I

[02:38:18] this
[02:38:20] this all
[02:38:22] together and then I think a progenitor
[02:38:25] might need to be in a top loader that's

[02:38:28] one will is coming up with a game for
[02:38:31] all of you one two three four Juke J ke

[02:38:44] case you're very welcome Coral kid we

[02:38:52] our little thing on YouTube where we
[02:38:53] share on YouTube we do some videos there

[02:38:58] you can follow us on YouTube and
[02:38:59] Instagram make sure you check us out
[02:39:01] that's the only thing we ever really
[02:39:02] care about just saying thank you for
[02:39:04] hanging out with us on a regular basis
[02:39:06] and remember because if you do slash
[02:39:08] goals you'll see what our goals are for
[02:39:10] the show and also for the uh for our our
[02:39:14] um social medias if you help us hit
[02:39:16] those goals you actually get to skit
[02:39:18] we're going to those things as giveaways
[02:39:20] at the end of the shows where those
[02:39:22] goals are
[02:39:24] hit sorcery is a long term so I would
[02:39:28] say sorcery for a long term the art on
[02:39:30] it is what is getting people to like it
[02:39:32] a lot and for me if you can grab
[02:39:35] somebody with something like art then
[02:39:37] they were G keep playing it and that's
[02:39:38] what I was doing when I was starting out
[02:39:40] was playing um I like playing Magic
[02:39:43] because I love the art on it it was it
[02:39:45] was playable art for me and that has
[02:39:47] become now sourc
[02:39:49] so with that I I'd say it's a tolerable
[02:39:52] investment that it maybe not like Buy in
[02:39:54] right away as you would a ton of stuff
[02:39:57] like you know magic being out for years
[02:39:58] or Pokemon but I would definitely put
[02:40:01] some investment into it if you were
[02:40:03] going to say something like uh a few
[02:40:05] boxes that you hold off to the side um
[02:40:08] or maybe you even just buy uh you know
[02:40:11] buy one of the precon things you never
[02:40:12] open it I think those type of things and
[02:40:15] holding that would actually be a smart
[02:40:16] investment hold on to those for like you
[02:40:18] know 10 years a decade or so and then it
[02:40:20] will end up being something because even
[02:40:22] if it ends up being a game that becomes
[02:40:23] a defunk game the art on it was still
[02:40:26] made by people like very good artists
[02:40:28] and that art like it's G to end up being
[02:40:30] worth money no matter what that's why
[02:40:33] I'd say like maybe not like have 50
[02:40:35] different things 50 boxes sitting on but
[02:40:37] definitely have a couple of them is what
[02:40:39] I think I mean myself I have I have two
[02:40:42] boxes plus one of the um unopened um
[02:40:45] starter kits that I have and I'm not
[02:40:47] ever gonna I'm I probably not going to
[02:40:49] open up the beta ones I was actually
[02:40:51] debating on buying a alpha one and I
[02:40:53] bought some Alpha stuff already I've

[02:52:54] happens is you choose one of the
[02:52:56] characters and say it would be one of
[02:52:59] these characters here all right now I
[02:53:01] need to actually do this and move this
[02:53:03] behind a bunch of
[02:53:06] things my game uh in a little bit here
[02:53:09] we can do that and Yeti came out with a

[04:24:13] do that versus because people are saying
[04:24:14] they couldn't see the show notes and
[04:24:16] that way they can say whatever they want
[04:24:17] to figure it out is the checkin not
[04:24:20] working oh
[04:24:28] no no it should work again try it
[04:24:31] another time if it try it again there if
[04:24:33] it didn't work I'm
[04:24:39] sorry ah there we go there it
[04:24:43] is 13 I didn't know if I ran that so
[04:24:47] there we
[04:24:50] go remember the more check-ins the
[04:24:52] larger the giveaway is at the end of the
[04:24:54] stream currently because we hit one of
[04:24:55] our Milestones the giveaway at the end
[04:24:57] of the stream will be an i corer booster
[04:24:59] maybe if we can get up even bigger with
[04:25:01] all our checkins maybe it will end up
[04:25:03] being a um maybe it will be two packs
[04:25:07] maybe it'll be maybe if we get up to
[04:25:09] like 4 or 500 maybe it'll be like a
[04:25:11] collector booster or something I don't
[04:25:12] know know it's up to you guys how this
[04:25:14] goes hey Travis nice to see you in here
[04:25:26] again check in just um if you do SL
[04:25:29] checkin it gives you a little it says
[04:25:30] you're checking in and it's it goes
[04:25:32] towards the giveaway counter is really
[04:25:33] what it is so um what I do is the
[04:25:36] giveaway starts out as like a single at
[04:25:37] the end of the show but the more
[04:25:38] check-ins we get the higher the giveaway
[04:25:40] is so right now we're up to a pack of
[04:25:42] booster of ioria for the giveaway and if
[04:25:44] we get up to 200 we'll end up doing um I
[04:25:47] might end up changing that to like you
[04:25:49] know an Exon set booster or a Time
[04:25:52] spiral or something like that and then
[04:25:53] say we get the 400 which I don't think
[04:25:56] we're going to do in the time frame that
[04:25:57] I'm left here we would be at uh we would
[04:25:59] be at like a collector booster or
[04:26:00] something that's kind of how that goes

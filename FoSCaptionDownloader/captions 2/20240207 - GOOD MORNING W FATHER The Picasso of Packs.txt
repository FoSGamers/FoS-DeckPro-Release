[00:03:09] here and uh we're going to go over and
[00:03:13] we're going to do some of
[00:03:16] our box now I have not updated the big
[00:03:19] blue book yet as you notice there's
[00:03:21] still only one of the floors that has
[00:03:22] been taken out of there we've had a few
[00:03:23] of them pulled happy Wednesday Friday
[00:03:26] thank you I don't know how you guys we I
[00:03:28] we I'm I'm an older person so we had
[00:03:30] that hump day uh theme going on for a
[00:03:33] while hump
[00:03:38] day oh that's what I I remember growing
[00:03:41] up for a while you know what I like we
[00:03:44] didn't pull anything out of vioria uh
[00:03:46] Exelon yet let's do an Exelon deal here
[00:03:50] let's do some
[00:03:52] Exelon hey gnome how you
[00:03:57] doing we're going to call this
[00:04:02] yeah let's do this let's help out with
[00:04:04] shipping a little bit more let me see if
[00:04:07] I can do
[00:04:08] that that's close but whatever we'll
[00:04:10] start it off this
[00:04:13] morning we got a pack and then obviously
[00:04:16] in our big blue book here this is what
[00:04:19] we got in here now the cool thing about
[00:04:21] this is there's 81 spots
[00:04:23] $2,222 now that was a happy coincidence
[00:04:25] by the way that's why we ended up
[00:04:27] changing the name to this we weren't
[00:04:28] actually going to change until it added
[00:04:30] up that way currently on a way to work
[00:04:33] like every day like every day you know
[00:04:35] it's one of those things everybody the
[00:04:36] same thing every day right Exelon is
[00:04:38] definitely a very fun set you get
[00:04:40] yourself a pack a collector and then the
[00:04:42] box here now in the Box you have the
[00:04:45] ceiling of 90 I mean the book you have a
[00:04:47] ceiling of 90 floors are between 11 and
[00:04:49] 20 averages around 27 but that goes up
[00:04:53] as the spots are pulled because every
[00:04:54] Blank Spot becomes a collector booster
[00:04:58] of murders at Carlo Manor
[00:05:00] so that actually price of the book goes
[00:05:02] up as I've spot gets pulled now only
[00:05:05] nine hit floors between 15 and 20 and
[00:05:08] there are 10 between 11 and 14 one of
[00:05:10] the floors have been hit so here this is
[00:05:12] kind of what's in the book you to force
[00:05:14] negation
[00:05:15] maybe you know maybe you spin the wheel
[00:05:18] oh the wheel's not up no wonder why
[00:05:19] you're having a hard time understanding
[00:05:21] oh God the wheel isn't up in the corner
[00:05:24] there that's my fault I didn't put the
[00:05:27] wheel up give me a second
[00:05:31] let me get the wheel
[00:05:35] up oh that was my mistake
[00:05:40] there all right that's the
[00:05:43] wheel 81 spots I put it up in the
[00:05:47] corner the notes aren't printed either
[00:05:50] oh I definitely hit save on those notes
[00:05:53] three times
[00:05:55] today but every time I hit save it froze
[00:05:58] and it shows shows on my end when it
[00:06:00] freezes though which is
[00:06:03] weird all right try that
[00:06:06] again you need a gay as cradle I don't
[00:06:09] have a gay as cradle though but uh I
[00:06:13] mean I do have some Eternal
[00:06:16] Masters I do have some Eternal Masters
[00:06:18] so maybe we do I don't know you know
[00:06:20] you're not going to get cradle in there
[00:06:24] couldn't as I pull it out but you could
[00:06:26] uh you could get yourself um some nice
[00:06:28] stuff in there
[00:06:31] maybe something interesting with that
[00:06:32] we'll do a pack deal
[00:06:34] here do a pack deal right now and I'll
[00:06:38] show off the big blue book a little bit
[00:06:39] more and explain it as we have the Pack
[00:06:41] deal up in the morning oh dual King
[00:06:44] likes a book dual King likes the book
[00:06:46] all right we're going to put that back
[00:06:47] we're just going to go to the book right
[00:06:49] now and then we're going to see what
[00:06:54] happens give it a shot we like it
[00:06:57] du we like it duel all right here we go
[00:07:00] so how this goes let me know where you
[00:07:03] want how many times you would like me to
[00:07:05] shuffle the the wheel I just got to pull
[00:07:07] the wheel back over all right let me
[00:07:09] know how many times you want me to
[00:07:10] shuffle the wheel and then I'm going to
[00:07:11] run it and what you spin on is the spot
[00:07:13] you get on that's the number you get and
[00:07:16] then as everybody knows if you happen to
[00:07:18] get
[00:07:19] one that is under $10 you get a choice
[00:07:23] of any of these packs a card if you get
[00:07:25] a card that is under $5 you get a choice
[00:07:27] of any two of these packs
[00:07:30] a combination of any one of these plus
[00:07:32] any one of these or a collective booster
[00:07:36] of Dungeons and Dragons your
[00:07:38] choice so three we're going to do three

[00:17:19] um you end up having 81 spots $22 per
[00:17:22] spot the ceiling's 90 which is
[00:17:26] um balin's tomb now you can kind of see
[00:17:29] here floors hit and all that stuff uh I
[00:17:32] kind of try to write out as much as I
[00:17:33] can to make it very visual for you guys
[00:17:35] but what it is you spin the wheel each
[00:17:37] spot is numbered maybe you get a card
[00:17:39] that like a force a negation or maybe
[00:17:42] you get like a pack
[00:17:43] negation or if there's an empty spot
[00:17:46] that is the actually a Murders At car
[00:17:48] love Manor collector booster so every
[00:17:50] single time a card is pulled the Box
[00:17:51] actually get the book gets bigger so
[00:17:54] like every car that happens to be under
[00:17:56] $9 you actually get a choice
[00:17:59] of um packs of cards there's five packs
[00:18:01] of cards you get a choice of and then if
[00:18:03] it happens to be under $5 for the card
[00:18:05] so maybe you want a Raa maybe you want
[00:18:07] you know a ristic study watery grave but
[00:18:10] it happens to be under uh $5 you get two
[00:18:12] of those packs or um a choice of a
[00:18:16] couple other things too it's like bin
[00:18:17] tomb water grave retro Temple Garden
[00:18:21] retro foil steam vents so good cards in
[00:18:23] there and that all those blank spots
[00:18:26] though you see the back for some reason
[00:18:27] had a lot of blank spots all those blank
[00:18:30] spots are actually merged at Carlo Manor

[00:25:42] wanted that now remember guys the Big
[00:25:45] Blue Book everything that's pulled out
[00:25:47] ends up being an empty spot that gets
[00:25:49] you a pack pitless plunder a special
[00:25:52] guest
[00:25:53] foil oh I don't have that I pulled it
[00:25:58] out but I don't have that um I will
[00:26:02] say I'll have to double check because I
[00:26:06] do have some stuff in my own collection
[00:26:08] and I don't think I pulled that one out
[00:26:09] in foil I don't think I pulled that out
[00:26:11] in
[00:26:12] foil let's put on a regular pack deal
[00:26:15] guys all right I know you said you want
[00:26:16] singles you want some pull box things
[00:26:19] and some pack deals so I'm kind of going
[00:26:21] between them all kind of going between
[00:26:22] them all for you
[00:26:26] guys
[00:26:29] let's do
[00:26:31] this we're doing a pack
[00:26:34] deal this is our pack deal right
[00:26:37] now we're going to do couple of play
[00:26:41] boosters oo couple play
[00:26:46] boosters let's call that here we
[00:26:50] go oh that's not right why did it do
[00:26:54] that no oh that's why the mouse is
[00:26:58] hitting the the mouse is hitting the uh
[00:27:00] the edge of the box and uh was pressing
[00:27:04] down when I was uh not meaning to I'm
[00:27:08] sitting there going that's not what I'm
[00:27:10] doing why is it
[00:27:13] clicking all right we're gonna call
[00:27:18] this this pack deal
[00:27:21] here I'm going to do it again for
[00:27:23] another uh I'm going to do 45 seconds
[00:27:25] here while I start going through some of
[00:27:27] the singles and keep scrolling through
[00:27:28] them all right guys if you want any of
[00:27:30] the singles let me know put them off to
[00:27:31] the side of the name on them as I've
[00:27:33] said before too they fluctuate so it's
[00:27:36] hard to tell what the prices are because
[00:27:38] they've been written on them since when
[00:27:39] I open the pack and that's about it so
[00:27:42] if they're different now that is because
[00:27:44] I opened them either before they were
[00:27:47] changed or whatnot there so my point is
[00:27:51] I adjust them that's why they're just
[00:27:52] kind of there to have me know where to
[00:27:54] have them in the bunch of
[00:27:55] everything sometimes the value ends up
[00:27:57] being way off and I need to adjust them
[00:27:59] sometimes like when I put them in the
[00:28:00] book The Adjustment I had to adjust a
[00:28:02] bunch of them because the prices were
[00:28:03] way
[00:28:06] off well way off since I had initially
[00:28:09] put them on there there you go some
[00:28:11] singles for you if you want
[00:28:13] any all right no one wanted this pack
[00:28:18] deal all right guys it's uh some Eternal
[00:28:21] Masters there we could uh oh no I
[00:28:24] knocked that over
[00:28:26] box maybe we're looking for
[00:28:31] a oh thank you I appreciate that
[00:28:37] gnome thank you I appreciate that gnome
[00:28:40] a lot you should get a few things there
[00:28:43] um I threw a few things in for you too
[00:28:44] say thank
[00:28:47] you all right uh let me
[00:28:51] see let me see let's do another you know
[00:28:55] what let's just do like a pull box deal
[00:28:57] I mean a blue book deal but the blue
[00:29:00] book this time what we're going to do is
[00:29:02] we're going to do something like this
[00:29:03] we're going to do a couple of uh couple
[00:29:06] of play boosters here let's see if I can
[00:29:07] get those to stay
[00:29:10] stay stay a couple of play boosters
[00:29:16] there oh they didn't stay dang it I
[00:29:19] thought I had it I thought I balanced
[00:29:21] them nope that didn't happen I did not
[00:29:24] balance them all right we're GNA P this
[00:29:28] going to do that there all
[00:29:33] right there we
[00:29:36] go see if I can do it
[00:29:38] again it's like it's like when you try
[00:29:40] to balance oh no I can't do it we're
[00:29:42] gonna do it like that anyways there we
[00:29:44] go those two packs that are laying
[00:29:46] there they made a heart for me look at
[00:29:50] see by me that was really bad I'm sorry
[00:29:55] that was really bad I'm not doing it
[00:29:56] again
[00:29:59] any ideas or decisions on the pull box
[00:30:02] yes I do have a decision on it I am
[00:30:07] about 45% done with it it takes me a
[00:30:11] little bit because I felt because the
[00:30:12] problem is I don't have a ton of cards
[00:30:14] that are dollar price range area um to
[00:30:18] be able to put into there uh so what I'm
[00:30:20] trying to do is I tried to figure it out
[00:30:22] a way of doing it and like so I'm trying
[00:30:24] to make it so it's not like you're kind
[00:30:26] of getting a Cent card so that's what
[00:30:28] I'm trying to figure out and it's just
[00:30:29] taking me a little bit longer than I was
[00:30:31] expecting because my um my
[00:30:34] cards uh my card
[00:30:37] um LW my
[00:30:40] card log my card uh storage like no I'm
[00:30:44] looking for a word and it's just
[00:30:45] blanking on me my card uh
[00:30:49] tavar tavar yes I have tavar right here
[00:30:53] that was a nice one tavar Julian
[00:30:56] brawler I can put that off to the side
[00:30:58] for you trying to think my stock thank
[00:31:02] you my stock is not that big on all
[00:31:04] singles in that price range so what I uh
[00:31:08] needed to do here is uh needed to figure
[00:31:11] something else out but yes it'll be
[00:31:12] coming out within the next day or two
[00:31:14] and what it will be is what we're kind
[00:31:15] of talking about there where one of the
[00:31:17] hit hits and it will be a um will be a
[00:31:22] whole collector booster I believe I'm
[00:31:24] gonna end up doing a whole collector
[00:31:25] booster of Lord of the Rings
[00:31:27] is going to be the big hit out of that
[00:31:29] and then in there and the rest of them
[00:31:31] there'll be either like dollar or less
[00:31:34] cards um they're going to be a dollar
[00:31:36] pull they're all going to be a dollar or
[00:31:38] less cards and they're end up going to
[00:31:40] have like a few of them are going to
[00:31:42] have H written on it we'll have like a
[00:31:44] collector booster of something written
[00:31:45] on it so that's what I'm thinking
[00:31:49] of oh you're
[00:31:51] wrong wrong one yeah no problem no
[00:31:53] problem I'll put that back
[00:31:56] here
[00:31:59] all right no one wanted this big blue
[00:32:01] book deal so I'm going to put this
[00:32:05] back always in the background there guys
[00:32:07] and that just keeps getting bigger and
[00:32:09] better as it goes because as you know
[00:32:12] every single time a spot is blank it
[00:32:13] ends up being a collector booster so I'm
[00:32:15] going to put those back seems like
[00:32:17] murders was not a big uh big hit for
[00:32:20] anyone at all I either needed to get rid
[00:32:22] of it all right away or I'm gonna be
[00:32:24] stuck with it for a while it seems let's
[00:32:27] do
[00:32:29] this for a pack deal let's do this for a
[00:32:32] pack deal let's go
[00:32:35] after a let's go after a um monoc Crypt
[00:32:41] with a monoc crypt and some
[00:32:45] triom he that's a good one monoc Crypt
[00:32:48] monoc crypt and some
[00:32:49] triom that's our pack deal we're going
[00:32:51] to put on and I'll go through the
[00:32:53] singles again for a little bit for you
[00:32:54] guys like I've been doing
[00:32:57] we're going to do this here GNA do
[00:33:05] this all right we're going to call
[00:33:09] that no that what no work here there we
[00:33:19] go yeah I noticed
[00:33:22] that we did a pre-release and a lot of
[00:33:26] us were complaining about what was in
[00:33:27] the in the in the play stuff play
[00:33:29] boosters like it was hard to like I had
[00:33:32] a hard time finding something to play
[00:33:34] compared to pre-releases that I played
[00:33:36] with the um other stuff so like I was
[00:33:39] having a hard time this is this is a
[00:33:40] hard pre-release for me I did absolutely
[00:33:44] horrible with the way the new play
[00:33:45] boosters are set up like I don't know if
[00:33:47] it was like I just didn't get cards that
[00:33:49] I was used to or I was I got too many of
[00:33:53] like certain kinds but I just did I did
[00:33:55] really bad and the last time that I
[00:33:58] played I actually I won my first like my
[00:34:01] I won my first set of games I won I tied

[00:37:52] pulled out some
[00:37:53] calim and that isn't a high value call
[00:37:57] I don't think necessarily I think it's
[00:37:58] an uncommon
[00:38:03] right or you looking for teret God of
[00:38:07] fright if you're looking for teret God
[00:38:09] of fright I don't remember pulling tet
[00:38:11] God of fright out I will say
[00:38:18] that all right sorde the Big Blue Book
[00:38:22] yeah the god the god I don't have I
[00:38:24] don't remember the god the Big Blue Book
[00:38:25] I'm going to go over that here in a
[00:38:26] second okay I'm going to explain that
[00:38:29] for you slum horde right now so the Big
[00:38:32] Blue Book what happens is you
[00:38:36] have um you
[00:38:40] have a spin of the wheel up in the top
[00:38:42] right corner there I end up moving that
[00:38:44] wheel down so that you can see it better
[00:38:47] so um what it will end up being is
[00:38:51] um
[00:38:53] a 81 spot sorry I just wanted to get
[00:38:55] this running 81 spots normally it's $22
[00:38:58] per spot unless I'm doing a combination
[00:39:00] because then I take like a couple bucks
[00:39:01] off helps me with with whof e so I pass
[00:39:04] that savings onto you guys but anyways
[00:39:07] when we do multiple things I like to do
[00:39:08] that but what happens is is you get your
[00:39:10] choice of a you get a ceiling which is a
[00:39:12] balance tomb there's floors that are
[00:39:14] between 11 and $20 are the cards average
[00:39:18] is around 27 but that goes up because as
[00:39:20] it pulls every time there's a blank spot
[00:39:23] that hits becomes a collector booster of
[00:39:25] murders at Carlo Manor so this big boo
[00:39:27] book ends up going up now what you have
[00:39:29] 19 floors out of them there are nine
[00:39:32] that are between the $5 and $20 range
[00:39:34] there 10 that are between the 11 and $14
[00:39:36] range now one of them have already been
[00:39:37] hit which means there's only 18 floors
[00:39:40] and one of those floors is now emerged
[00:39:41] at Carlo Manor collector booster so I
[00:39:44] see Nana chill went with it like it I
[00:39:47] like it Nana chill went with it so we're
[00:39:49] gonna do this you have one two on the
[00:39:52] right and one on the left for your
[00:39:54] commander Masters and we'll get that
[00:39:56] wheel out
[00:39:58] here and you can let me check my
[00:40:03] DMs all right anyways check the yeah
[00:40:06] anyways on the uh let me know how many
[00:40:08] times Nana chill you would like me to um
[00:40:12] do the randomizer for you some to
[00:40:15] shuffle the randomizer for you because
[00:40:17] we do Shuffle it as many times You' like
[00:40:20] and what happens is if you happen to
[00:40:21] pull out a card that is under $10 you
[00:40:25] get a choice of any of these where' It
[00:40:28] Go a missing
[00:40:31] [Music]
[00:40:35] one one two three you get a choice of
[00:40:39] any of these five packs if it's under $5
[00:40:41] you get a choice of two of these or one
[00:40:44] of these plus one of these or a
[00:40:48] collector booster of Dungeons and
[00:40:49] Dragons All
[00:40:51] right so do you want me
[00:40:54] to shuffle the entries on the wheel
[00:40:57] there at all or would you like me to
[00:40:59] just hit Spin and go and where would you
[00:41:02] like me to go Nana for uh your pack pull
[00:41:06] here good luck though good luck and if I
[00:41:09] missed something in the chat I'm sorry I
[00:41:10] was
[00:41:12] um some it looks like it sometimes every
[00:41:14] now spin in the
[00:41:18] middle middle
[00:41:22] front wait there is no middle front
[00:41:25] there is only
[00:41:27] two so the front one has to be this one
[00:41:29] is what I'm guessing oh crap ah it's
[00:41:32] blocked by the
[00:41:34] wheel there's only two in here so I'm
[00:41:36] guessing the front one is this one
[00:41:39] right sorry about that so there's only
[00:41:42] two here on that side so you said front
[00:41:44] so I'm guessing this you mean for the
[00:41:45] front one all right so I'm taking that
[00:41:47] one out as a front one if you want me to
[00:41:48] do something different let me
[00:41:50] know right front yeah all right there
[00:41:52] you go and then we're going to spin the
[00:41:53] wheel
[00:41:54] here I forgot the wheel was H kind of
[00:41:57] out of
[00:41:58] view there you go and you got number 47
[00:42:02] number 47 now I'm going to put the wheel
[00:42:03] up in the corner you see number 47 there
[00:42:07] still we're going to go to number
[00:42:13] 47 number 47 there you go all right so
[00:42:16] number 40 is a vestan monopar leader
[00:42:18] surge foil seeing that it is a card and
[00:42:22] it is only a $3 card this is what
[00:42:25] happens
[00:42:27] you get your
[00:42:29] choice and put these ones off my singles
[00:42:31] off to the side here that I've been
[00:42:32] going through you get your choice
[00:42:41] of any of these to any two of these

[00:43:57] Nana hey
[00:43:59] Pop rip them all all right good luck
[00:44:03] let's see what we can get you out of
[00:44:06] here oh I like when they do the packs
[00:44:09] where you can just slightly like pull
[00:44:11] them apart from the top nice and
[00:44:13] smoothly here we go I think it is one
[00:44:16] two three four five and six I think they
[00:44:21] do six with the play boosters here we
[00:44:23] move the we do the six here I do the six
[00:44:25] here like this because I like seeing the
[00:44:26] spoilers at the end I like to see them
[00:44:28] at the end not the beginning most of the
[00:44:30] people here like it too surveillance
[00:44:32] monitor lumbering Landry laundry I
[00:44:36] mean bubble Smuggler Reasonable Doubt

[00:44:53] Basher meticulous archive oh that's nice
[00:44:57] little hit there meticulous
[00:44:59] archive aone the center of the web nice
[00:45:03] uh nice one there
[00:45:05] too underground Mortuary foil look at
[00:45:09] that a second one of those and your foil
[00:45:11] land nice foil in and your token card
[00:45:14] dude that's not bad not too bad out of
[00:45:16] the uh for a little play booster
[00:45:20] there and uh these ones were a few bucks
[00:45:23] I don't know if they were
[00:45:24] over five or 10 or whatever but what I
[00:45:27] like to do here is I put them in a top
[00:45:29] loader the reason why we do them with
[00:45:31] two of them out in there is because it
[00:45:32] keeps it stiffer for shipping so it
[00:45:34] helps to uh helps with shipping to keep
[00:45:36] it stiffer I think they used to be a few
[00:45:39] bucks but sometimes these things drop so
[00:45:41] quickly it's hard for me to remember
[00:45:42] what they
[00:45:44] are that's why I say when I do the
[00:45:46] singles that I do I'm like guys these
[00:45:47] are like gold you got to let me know if
[00:45:48] they fluctuated a big difference here we
[00:45:50] go Nana let's keep it
[00:45:54] going
[00:45:56] there we go that was a hard one to open
[00:45:58] there so hopefully that means this is a
[00:46:00] good
[00:46:01] pack that's G that's what my kids say we
[00:46:04] started doing this because my boys my
[00:46:06] oldest son wanted to now I do it a

[00:49:34] that art on that one it's like a perfect
[00:49:36] art in the in the uh foil they did a

[00:49:43] if anybody else wants to jump in all
[00:49:46] right let me uh see if I missed anything

[00:49:50] up all right did not miss anything but
[00:49:52] let's get uh let's get something going
[00:49:53] in the queue you guys I got a lot of
[00:49:55] stuff in my buy now everything that's in
[00:49:57] the buy now too remember if you want a
[00:50:00] pack deal on them let me know because it
[00:50:02] help what hap what happens is if you
[00:50:03] want like if you notice when I do like
[00:50:05] three of a kind uh in um of a multiples
[00:50:08] of a packs I it's it's discounted and
[00:50:10] the reason is because whatnot fees when
[00:50:13] I do multiple of them I don't get hit
[00:50:15] with them M whatnot fees as much so I
[00:50:16] pass the savings to you guys so what I'm
[00:50:18] going to do is if you guys have like
[00:50:20] three packs that you want or three maybe
[00:50:22] you want to do a doctor hoop pole a
[00:50:25] mystery pack pole and a uh and like a

[00:59:21] collector I do not happen to have any
[00:59:24] ravnik remastered collector I've been
[00:59:26] debating on getting some more of it cuz
[00:59:28] I've had a couple people ask for it but
[00:59:31] I need to sell more of my murders before
[00:59:33] I can get some more of them because I
[00:59:35] think people like it more than murders
[00:59:36] and I like the I like the shock lands in
[00:59:38] them a bit myself so I'm gonna try to
[00:59:41] I'm G to try to pick some up probably in
[00:59:43] like another week or so if I can get rid
[00:59:44] of more of my
[00:59:45] murders uh but until then I'm I'm a
[00:59:48] little stuck on that I guess uh and
[00:59:51] because I just I literally just refilled
[00:59:53] stock on other stuff so I pretty much
[00:59:55] got next week maybe next week it'll be I
[00:59:58] I'll get some stuff but here you
[01:00:02] go thank
[01:00:04] you N
[01:00:10] [Music]
[01:00:14] Chill wow that's pretty
[01:00:20] good yes exactly that's what I'm saying
[01:00:22] when you get the shocks in there it
[01:00:24] always p for it and that's I think why a
[01:00:25] lot of people like the rabika ones and
[01:00:27] I'm thinking of just keeping rabika in
[01:00:29] stock for that reason like for that
[01:00:32] legit reason so I'm gonna do a pull B
[01:00:34] I'm gonna do the big blue book deal I'm
[01:00:36] gonna do a book uh Big Blue Book and
[01:00:38] we're gonna do this actually we're gonna
[01:00:40] do
[01:00:41] something like a this we're gonna do
[01:00:44] something like a this big blue book and
[01:00:48] an eternal
[01:00:51] Masters
[01:00:53] Maybe that's how you got your second
[01:00:56] serial really from uh you know what I
[01:00:58] might have to go and try uh try that
[01:01:00] then maybe I'll write it off as uh a
[01:01:02] business expense Walmart pack purchase
[01:01:06] think they do you think that would be
[01:01:07] allowed business expense trying to
[01:01:09] trying to catch a card
[01:01:11] there I don't know we'll see maybe I
[01:01:14] don't think I I'll I can attempt
[01:01:17] it all right here we
[01:01:20] go that's what we got going right there
[01:01:22] an eternal Masters plus a big blue book
[01:01:25] spin there that's a really good deal 25
[01:01:28] bucks for that Eternal Masters less than
[01:01:30] 25 actually luck is getting two serial
[01:01:33] eyes of the same card I know that is
[01:01:35] insane that is insane when you pulled
[01:01:37] that second serial eyes of the same card
[01:01:38] you better bought a lottery ticket
[01:01:40] that's all I gotta say now this is just
[01:01:42] random what random stuff that I got here

[01:26:06] Mona value would be the one that you at
[01:26:09] H the target the dart that hits its
[01:26:11] Target and with that Dart hitting its
[01:26:13] Target you would pull from the box and
[01:26:15] say say it was this you'd pull out and
[01:26:17] you'd get a card here and we'd flip it
[01:26:18] over and be like oh look this is a card

[01:36:31] guaranteeing yourself a collector
[01:36:32] booster right now pretty good there and
[01:36:35] three packs of cards plus the potential

[01:38:21] like I said before to everyone I can do
[01:38:23] deals with

[01:38:28] stuff especially with singles they
[01:38:29] change and if you do multiple things at
[01:38:31] once it helps me with whatnot fees so I
[01:38:33] always pass the savings onto you guys

[01:39:06] throw the random ones on there because
[01:39:09] someone actually ends up going for it
[01:39:10] thinking you know what that's actually a
[01:39:11] good deal I like that so but I mean I do
[01:39:15] put good deals on but sometimes it just
[01:39:17] you know it's a
[01:39:18] Wednesday wait for payday you don't

[01:44:20] scroll through them and if you want them
[01:44:22] let me know you guys know the prices of
[01:44:24] these things fluctuate so crazy that
[01:44:26] this might be a dollar today it might be
[01:44:28] 25 cents tomorrow so we just look at
[01:44:30] what the um this here has helped me know
[01:44:32] what the price was when I pulled it out
[01:44:34] of the pack but uh so I kind of had an
[01:44:36] understanding of the value but what we
[01:44:38] can do is obviously go and check it
[01:44:40] before I always do it and check it
[01:44:41] before we uh do a sale to make sure
[01:44:43] everything's accurate and nothing's
[01:44:44] dropped like $20 or something like that
[01:44:47] you know but here we go those are all
[01:44:49] the dollar kind of dollar is singles

[01:44:55] recently let me know and we'll put them
[01:44:58] off the side with your name on
[01:45:00] it that's a paco that we had on the back
[01:45:02] there no one wanted that though that was
[01:45:05] a really good deal for that get yourself
[01:45:07] a a MOX no one everybody wants his Mo
[01:45:11] wants a MOX but no one wants to try to
[01:45:13] get it out and if it's not uh when it's
[01:45:16] out of one of these though you guys want
[01:45:18] to you'll see it in the box and you'll
[01:45:19] try to go after a box so when you had
[01:45:20] chances are like one in a thousand
[01:45:22] versus uh getting some out of a pack
[01:45:24] here I don't know that's uh that's my

[01:50:53] here you know what actually I'm going to
[01:50:55] go through the big blue book a little
[01:50:57] bit before I go through some of the
[01:50:59] singles you have 81 spots generally is
[01:51:01] $22 per spot ceiling is 90 which is a
[01:51:04] balin's tomb and hasn't been hit floors
[01:51:06] are 11 between $20 they're cards there's
[01:51:08] only 19 of them which actually one of
[01:51:10] been hit so there's only 18 left where
[01:51:12] it's between nine of them are between 15
[01:51:14] and $20 10 are between 11 and
[01:51:16] $14 then what you have in here is you

[01:51:26] negation maybe get 24 in a blank spot
[01:51:29] and you get yourself a collector booster
[01:51:31] at murders of Carlo which is why as this

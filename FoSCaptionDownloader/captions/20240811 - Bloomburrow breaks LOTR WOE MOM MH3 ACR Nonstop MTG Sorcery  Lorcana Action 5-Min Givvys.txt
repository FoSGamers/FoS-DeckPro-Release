[00:06:32] of you guys try the check-ins and let me
[00:06:34] know if it's
[00:06:44] working do slash checkin and we can see
[00:06:47] if it's working
[00:06:49] right all right see the checkins are
[00:06:51] working ah but the thing isn't working
[00:06:54] there all right well that's not fun
[00:07:00] check-ins work but our little symbol did
[00:07:02] not work
[00:07:03] today that
[00:07:05] stinks our little check-in thing did not
[00:07:08] work today let's see if I can if it's
[00:07:09] the uh if one of the other ones
[00:07:12] Works let's see if this one works is
[00:07:15] working then maybe it's like one of them
[00:07:17] not working and one of them does
[00:07:23] work I don't know that is weird well it
[00:07:27] looks like my checkin uh symbol thing
[00:07:29] won't work today so we'll remove that
[00:07:32] that stinks that stinks I'll have to
[00:07:35] figure out why that's not working I'll
[00:07:37] play with that another day but at least
[00:07:39] the check-ins are working on the other
[00:07:40] end there so anyways what we'll do is
[00:07:43] we'll do kind of like we normally
[00:07:45] do Cody's Mom thank you for letting me
[00:07:47] know that the check-in part worked that
[00:07:48] actually part worked thank you I did see
[00:07:50] that that worked so I appreciate that we
[00:07:52] got one two three four six seven eight
[00:07:55] nine 10 all right that's our rare oh
[00:07:57] there was our rare we got in there
[00:08:00] was the last one all right well Cody's
[00:08:03] Mom since you helped me can you give me
[00:08:04] a number between one and 10 that way I
[00:08:06] know what card we'll be putting out here
[00:08:08] for our giveaway starting out to day one
[00:08:10] two three four five six and seven we go
[00:08:17] that goes right there my friends and
[00:08:20] thank you for helping me out with
[00:08:23] that there we are all right so what we
[00:08:27] got going on right now we actually uh
[00:08:31] we'll throw some of our things out here
[00:08:33] I made a little change this so instead
[00:08:36] of
[00:08:39] um three cards you're going to be
[00:08:41] pulling four from here the nice thing
[00:08:44] about that
[00:08:45] is when you pull the
[00:08:50] four you're going to get uh more chances
[00:08:53] but I added some of the foils in there
[00:08:55] from uh the box that we opened the other
[00:08:56] day so that's why I get to add four
[00:08:58] that's yes
[00:09:02] kep the odds the same but made it so you
[00:09:05] can do
[00:09:06] that
[00:09:09] see or if you'd like we have our
[00:09:15] um our one over here as you can
[00:09:19] see that's our it is working all right
[00:09:23] this box right
[00:09:25] here is our uh $20 one that you see
[00:09:28] right there now the same kind of set up
[00:09:30] as the other the only difference is uh
[00:09:32] you get
[00:09:33] packs now one of the other things that I
[00:09:35] was going to be doing was
[00:09:44] um uh I know what today we're not
[00:09:48] opening anything specific today because
[00:09:49] we've opened a bunch of stuff recently
[00:09:52] we have opened a bunch of stuff recently
[00:09:54] and I can't keep opening all my things
[00:09:56] so I need to have some of you guys
[00:09:57] purchase some of that so we can stay in
[00:09:58] business here doing this for you guys so

[00:27:19] one going through and kind of sleeping
[00:27:22] up what we have for some sorcery
[00:27:25] cards we're going to make we were
[00:27:27] thinking of making a uh a sorcery deck I

[00:27:33] um play box similar to the one that I
[00:27:35] mean a box and little one that we have
[00:27:36] for bloomo so that being said I was just
[00:27:39] uh kind of going through and starting
[00:27:41] things up what do you think not a bad
[00:27:44] idea I'm going to take this I'm G to
[00:27:47] move that over here so everybody can
[00:27:48] still see it that way it's always in
[00:27:50] View and no one can complain that's
[00:27:52] always right there in view there you go

[00:28:03] not going to be having all the cards on
[00:28:05] there I have a warehouse where a lot of
[00:28:07] the stuff will end up getting shipped
[00:28:08] out of um and then what I'll end up
[00:28:10] doing is um the stuff that like I open

[00:28:30] of like a little online store so we'll
[00:28:32] be a little virtual game store is what
[00:28:34] I'm trying to go for here that's why I
[00:28:36] keep on pushing on the uh doing um our
[00:28:39] hanging out with us to do our
[00:28:41] um our Discord channel so why I always

[00:29:56] some things
[00:30:00] nice ones there for

[00:30:09] sorcery I'm I'm a big fan of it it's a a
[00:30:12] fun game but I figured I'm just going
[00:30:14] through and I'm kind of pretty much I'm
[00:30:15] sleeving these things up so that I can
[00:30:16] have them ready to play later whenever I
[00:30:19] want and also I was going to put them
[00:30:20] into a new box I have too much uh
[00:30:22] sorcery I realized I was looking at all
[00:30:25] sorcery I have I'm like wow that's a lot
[00:30:30] all right stanking there you go my
[00:30:32] friend look at that you got some luck
[00:30:34] this morning
[00:30:40] yourself oh
[00:30:41] interesting interesting got a little
[00:30:44] Savior for you my friend stinking
[00:30:53] Lincoln stinking
[00:30:55] Ling there you go it get you a little
[00:30:58] discount on your shipping can you give
[00:30:59] me a number between 1 and 10 though
[00:31:01] because that was not our big hit so that
[00:31:03] means we have to put we'll put another
[00:31:04] little something in
[00:31:13] here add that back
[00:31:16] in no uh d10 goes between one and oh you
[00:31:20] know what you got three we'll go three
[00:31:21] one two three that was under 10 anyway
[00:31:24] so that worked out for us that worked
[00:31:27] out we do d 10 now though because
[00:31:28] there's only 10 cards that are there but
[00:31:31] yeah sorcery is a fun one if you get a
[00:31:33] chance to
[00:31:35] play oh no worries no worries don't be
[00:31:38] ever don't ever be sorry unless all
[00:31:40] right so you can be sorry but you have
[00:31:42] to have been like exceptionally rude in
[00:31:44] some way you know what I mean
[00:31:45] disrespectful or something like that but
[00:31:48] for the most part you guys don't need to
[00:31:49] be sorry about anything like you guys
[00:31:51] you know it's life people have I know
[00:31:52] somebody coming and talk to them or you
[00:31:54] know that type of thing like there
[00:31:55] there's um like the other day people
[00:31:58] were talking to there was a person that
[00:31:59] like wasn't that has bought for me a
[00:32:00] couple times and they talk every now and
[00:32:02] again but I know they could be they're
[00:32:04] busy a lot so that they hang out and
[00:32:06] they get they hang out and they get some
[00:32:07] of the giveaways people are giving them
[00:32:09] a hard time like you know you leave
[00:32:10] people alone like some people are
[00:32:11] working and stuff like yeah they're not
[00:32:12] here answering or saying thank you and
[00:32:14] which I would very much appreciate if
[00:32:16] they at least come in and say thank you
[00:32:17] when they uh you know get the
[00:32:18] notification they won something but if
[00:32:20] they don't they don't always have the
[00:32:22] ability to because maybe they uh you
[00:32:24] know at the time they just happened to
[00:32:25] have their phone out they were looking
[00:32:27] at something
[00:32:28] and they completely forgot about it
[00:32:29] because I myself have done that before
[00:32:31] too where I had my phone out I had doing
[00:32:34] something for a giveaway then I set it
[00:32:35] down to help my kids do something and
[00:32:37] then I walked away and then when I came
[00:32:39] back I didn't know if I want or not and
[00:32:40] I just turned my phone off because I
[00:32:42] kept having to deal with my kids so it's
[00:32:44] yeah you
[00:32:48] know oh nice see yeah I'm doing a little
[00:32:51] kind of like game here is what we'll do
[00:32:52] is I'm going to try to get these
[00:32:53] together here nice cards though I like
[00:32:56] sorcery a lot
[00:32:58] we're trying to get it together here
[00:32:59] where we can
[00:33:03] um where we can do a a nice little game
[00:33:08] like we do with our our our other one
[00:33:10] here so what I was going to do is I was
[00:33:12] going to have them all in here that
[00:33:13] would be like the ordinary cards and uh
[00:33:16] if you end up getting like an
[00:33:17] exceptional card pulled out you guys
[00:33:21] obviously that would be like like the
[00:33:22] big the bigger hit because sorcery
[00:33:24] doesn't have too many giant things at
[00:33:25] the moment maybe get a it does get crazy
[00:33:28] exactly life gets crazy so I try to like
[00:33:30] you know I have two like I said I got
[00:33:32] two kids myself so I try to give people
[00:33:33] leeway on things but I you know I
[00:33:35] understand you know people can't always
[00:33:37] come and say anything but
[00:33:39] if if they can at some point it is
[00:33:41] greatly appreciated you know there's a
[00:33:43] they kept giving this person I'm like
[00:33:45] stop telling F I can't I can never say
[00:33:47] the person's name FES ra whatever stop
[00:33:50] you know don't worry about it he could
[00:33:51] be he she they could be somewhere doing
[00:33:54] who knows you know what I mean it's just
[00:33:56] because they they life happen to bump up
[00:33:58] for a second you know one of those
[00:34:00] things but yeah we got some sorcery here
[00:34:03] right now it's you know just life
[00:34:05] happens life happens it's rightly what
[00:34:07] it boils down
[00:34:10] to hey spank how's you doing this
[00:34:13] morning thank you for coming in hanging
[00:34:15] out I do appreciate it we're just kind
[00:34:17] of going through some of my sorcery that
[00:34:18] I got here and putting them in his
[00:34:19] sleeves and got the bloomo fun little $2
[00:34:23] game here which I spiced it up a little
[00:34:25] bit and added some of the uh foils to it
[00:34:27] from the box we pulled last night
[00:34:30] yesterday and with doing that I ended up
[00:34:33] uh instead of three cars being pulled
[00:34:35] we're going to have four cars being
[00:34:36] pulled out so it's kind of like pulling
[00:34:37] out a mini version of a of like one of
[00:34:40] those Beyond boosters you get for $2
[00:34:43] maybe get a collector
[00:34:51] booster yeah Goran that does happen
[00:34:54] Goran you know and you know it's going
[00:34:55] to happen at times because just because
[00:34:58] people are um you know people go around
[00:35:00] they hope they can get something free
[00:35:02] and either use it to sell on their site
[00:35:04] or or whatever there are people that are
[00:35:07] disingenuous in how they do things I
[00:35:09] will at 100% admit that and I have
[00:35:13] myself um seeing that occur where I'm
[00:35:16] like I don't think this person's ever
[00:35:17] been in here to Once actually order
[00:35:21] something so what are what what are they
[00:35:24] doing here like what's going on why are
[00:35:27] they always in here now that was like
[00:35:28] another that was another streamer uh
[00:35:31] location not mine but it was also like
[00:35:34] you said like oh what you never see
[00:35:36] anybody buying anything from these
[00:35:37] people but it's also I can't help it
[00:35:40] because you
[00:35:41] know life happens like that that's going
[00:35:44] to happen there's either going to be o o
[00:35:45] over time there's people that need
[00:35:48] things and they can't afford them and
[00:35:49] they try to get them or they try to do
[00:35:51] things and they get a bunch of things at
[00:35:52] once because they can't afford them or
[00:35:55] they just want to because they're kind
[00:35:57] of greedy people people and that's the
[00:35:58] way they are or whatever it is in life
[00:36:01] how people are people are certain ways
[00:36:02] you just got to tolerate it and deal
[00:36:03] with it they're not harming me
[00:36:05] specifically but they are sometimes it's
[00:36:07] like yeah I wish that some of the people
[00:36:09] that um purchase would have a better
[00:36:12] chance of getting things more frequently
[00:36:14] that's why like I try to do when I do
[00:36:18] um like uh follower giveaways I mean uh
[00:36:22] when I try to do um
[00:36:31] giveaways

[01:17:55] disappear today and I don't tell you
[01:17:57] that I'm leaving in any way shape or
[01:17:59] form that's because somebody was pretty
[01:18:01] much shitty yesterday because I had a
[01:18:02] large show and tried to find a way to
[01:18:04] give me a hard time so that whatnot got
[01:18:06] me
[01:18:07] suspended uh that happened the last time
[01:18:09] I had a large show so I'm expecting it
[01:18:10] to occur again here so just uh
[01:18:15] yeah yes the last time I had a large
[01:18:17] show where I did a good job and I had
[01:18:19] like 60 70 people in it at one point
[01:18:21] literally the next day in the middle of
[01:18:22] my stream like an hour and a half into
[01:18:24] it I disappeared from whatnot people
[01:18:26] like what happened to you I'm like uh
[01:18:27] somebody reported something and it
[01:18:30] wasn't even against their rules but they
[01:18:31] decided to change their rules after and
[01:18:33] suspend me so I'm just giving a little
[01:18:35] pre-warning make sure you always follow
[01:18:37] me on what on YouTube so that you can
[01:18:39] get me
[01:18:41] everywhere H what can you you can't do
[01:18:43] anything about it
[01:18:46] right where would you like to go I know
[01:18:49] it's crazy so they ended up doing they
[01:18:51] asked me to combine like so what it
[01:18:52] would have happened was they asked
[01:18:55] haters yeah pretty much what it is they
[01:18:56] asked me to combine somebody asked me to
[01:18:58] combine like this box and this box here
[01:19:02] which would have been I would I fine $22
[01:19:05] you can get four Ps from here and then
[01:19:07] do those ones from there well I did it
[01:19:09] as a combination just as a quick thing
[01:19:11] because they asked to do it well they
[01:19:13] said somebody on went and searched and
[01:19:15] said that I used that and I didn't have
[01:19:17] the floors the ceilings and the average
[01:19:19] in there so they suspended me I'm like
[01:19:21] no it's in all of them I combined it
[01:19:23] based off somebody asked it's in all of
[01:19:25] my other ones no it had to have the
[01:19:27] floor ceiling and average for that one
[01:19:29] specifically and because I didn't have

[01:53:38] zoom is what we live
[01:53:40] for so the difference in the pole boxes
[01:53:43] this is a $2 one you get um cards that
[01:53:45] will be up to you have anything that
[01:53:48] could be like a you know not not worth
[01:53:49] anything it's kind of like a play
[01:53:50] booster in a way or collector booster
[01:53:52] pull something out where you pull out
[01:53:54] the four cards if you get a card that
[01:53:55] has worth $2 or more you stop or if you
[01:53:58] get a card that has a booster you stop
[01:54:00] um or you pull until you get four cards
[01:54:03] that's this one now this one over here
[01:54:05] for 20 these are all packs that are
[01:54:07] written on there so that one will have
[01:54:09] either play boosters or whatever you see
[01:54:11] in there uh written on there play
[01:54:13] boosters or a few drafts or a handful of
[01:54:15] The Collector boosters are in there so
[01:54:17] it's the same concept but you would pick
[01:54:18] it out one card out and if you get a
[01:54:20] collector booster you stop that would be
[01:54:22] on this one and if you get a play

[03:59:09] jtunes likes the Nar set I like it Jay
[03:59:12] Tunes
[03:59:19] J1
[03:59:22] Tunes nice naret right there it's a good
[03:59:25] one it's a pretty looking
[03:59:34] card here we
[03:59:36] are then we're going to put out a uh
[03:59:39] Moonstone no no no we're going to put
[03:59:41] this out little mocking bird for you for
[03:59:46] you oh that's pretty cool every time you
[03:59:48] have you have a Nar correction I like
[03:59:53] that now it's slash P instead of uh I
[03:59:57] made it a little easier so you don't
[03:59:58] have to type as many letters
[04:00:00] in we're going to throw this one out
[04:00:02] instead of $7 it's going to go out for
[04:00:04] $6 for you if you want a mocking bird
[04:00:06] right here there you go and what I'm
[04:00:09] going to do is I'm going to move this so
[04:00:11] that we have it in complete view over
[04:00:12] here at all times
[04:00:14] so no one can [ __ ] and moan about
[04:00:22] anything oh that's kind a cool cool idea
[04:00:25] see I like I personally like building
[04:00:26] the theme decks versus like building
[04:00:28] something else like I like I'm going to
[04:00:30] try to build like a raccoon a
[04:00:33] uh uh what do you call it
[04:00:37] uh Rocket Raccoon deck because my wife
[04:00:41] was making a comment about all the
[04:00:42] raccoons we should build one
[04:00:46] all right polywog coming at you this is
[04:00:50] a $20 card it's going to go out for
[04:00:54] $18 but it will
[04:00:57] go in one of these that's why it's going
[04:01:00] so
[04:01:03] cheap it is it's a sweet card it's
[04:01:06] because evolve whenever an opponent cast
[04:01:08] a non-creature spell with mono value
[04:01:10] less than polywog Prodigy's power draw a
[04:01:13] card you're pretty much drawing a card
[04:01:14] continuously is what that is right there
[04:01:17] all right nobody wants our poliwog so
[04:01:19] I'll put the poliwog
[04:01:23] away it's definitely a cool looking card
[04:01:25] definitely a cool looking
[04:01:27] card now we have a Hazel oh I need the
[04:01:30] Hazel I
[04:01:34] lied I don't even know why I put that

[04:09:55] after so that it's all
[04:10:00] together let's
[04:10:08] see all right so
[04:10:18] I don't know we never I don't use blue
[04:10:20] we don't really use blue here so we're
[04:10:23] going to put this out we don't really
[04:10:24] play much with blue I don't know I don't
[04:10:26] why maybe it's just our our family and
[04:10:28] what we do but that's a nice looking
[04:10:29] card for you if you want it is Shani
[04:10:32] oti utai Dragon speaker I'm probably
[04:10:35] butchering that one all the
[04:10:41] hell full art rotten
[04:10:45] mouth hold on a
[04:10:50] second I have something intriguing for
[04:10:58] you would you like a rotten mouth Viper
[04:11:00] foil like
[04:11:02] that
[04:11:05] is
[04:11:07] izy
[04:11:11] tag iszy
[04:11:14] to
[04:11:20] Goblin there's a few different go now
[04:11:22] why would that would be put into a
[04:11:25] problem there you go Izzy nice pickup
[04:11:28] for you my
[04:11:32] friend is that is that thank you thank
[04:11:35] you is that you said you wanted a rotten
[04:11:39] mouth right
[04:11:46] is that what you looking for I thought
[04:11:48] somebody said full art rotten
[04:11:59] mouth well if you would like this this
[04:12:02] is what we can do it's going to go out
[04:12:03] at $19 instead of 20 but the reason why
[04:12:07] it's going out at 19 is one thing here
[04:12:09] is it's going to go out and you'll get
[04:12:11] it shipped in this plain white envelope
[04:12:12] in a top loader that's why you get the
[04:12:13] Cheap shipping which mean it doesn't
[04:12:15] have tracking it it gets there but it
[04:12:16] just doesn't have
[04:12:18] tracking that is the weirdest thing that
[04:12:20] is blocking that
[04:12:22] message but if you go over $20 it does
[04:12:26] end up automatically going to a package
[04:12:28] with shipping with
[04:12:31] tracking so here we go it's up to you 44

[00:17:11] worried about it that's why I I uh you
[00:17:14] know what I'm going to put I think just
[00:17:15] came out of the
[00:17:15] front that's why like I stuck it off to
[00:17:18] the side I know you you come in and hang
[00:17:19] out all the time I wasn't too worried I
[00:17:22] was not too worried we're going to put
[00:17:24] this
[00:17:27] here we're going to put
[00:17:29] this you know what let's start out with
[00:17:32] uh let's do this actually let's do a
[00:17:34] little one a little one let's start with
[00:17:36] one strength
[00:17:38] today let's start with one strength
[00:17:40] right now and we're going to call that
[00:17:41] one
[00:17:47] um that there for those
[00:17:51] two there you go you get those two you
[00:17:54] know what yeah that's two strength
[00:17:56] that's one strength from the Wasteland
[00:17:57] that's one strength from the Wasteland
[00:17:58] land maybe you guys want any of these
[00:18:00] though let's see I'll keep going
[00:18:02] through thank you coming in Joe or
[00:18:05] Joseph sorry if I I I had Joseph Joe I
[00:18:08] grow up with Joseph I grew up with so
[00:18:10] sometimes I just throw out nicknames a
[00:18:12] little bit if it's offensive or some way
[00:18:15] or you don't like it just tell me say
[00:18:17] shush it's not what I like but here's
[00:18:19] some of our singles here all right keep
[00:18:22] going through those and if you want any
[00:18:24] let me
[00:18:25] know how much for pan
[00:18:29] pan
[00:18:30] harmonica is that what you're looking
[00:18:32] for I think the pan harmonica is $4 at
[00:18:35] the moment is what it is there that I
[00:18:38] have um and I think that's actually what
[00:18:40] it is too might be um I don't think it's
[00:18:42] dropped
[00:18:55] anything oh it did drop a little bit for
[00:18:58] uh the foil so it's $3 for the foil
[00:19:00] instead of the four so $3 for foil $3
[00:19:04] for foil if you want that we can put
[00:19:05] that in
[00:19:16] there breaking up a little bit again
[00:19:19] there I don't think that's me actually I
[00:19:20] think that's someone else I think
[00:19:22] there's them maybe all right we're going
[00:19:23] to put those back no one jumped on those

[00:40:17] as a human thinking you're going to be
[00:40:18] safe and oh no the incinerator comes by
[00:40:22] burning up all kinds of stuff and as he
[00:40:25] burns things down you dive into the

[00:57:00] we won't we'll see what happens this a
[00:57:02] pretty close one here pretty close one
[00:57:04] here so we're going to go random we're
[00:57:06] going to go
[00:57:07] random and we see like this one seems to
[00:57:10] be hiding I think it's hiding from you
[00:57:12] maybe that's what's going on here come
[00:57:14] on come on come on Grady we got to oh no
[00:57:19] galta comes stampeding through that
[00:57:24] terrain crushing building things you
[00:57:27] dive towards a hole and luckily it
[00:57:29] happens to be a vault you climb into
[00:57:32] that Vault safely away from galta as he
[00:57:34] comes stampeding through the Wasteland
[00:57:38] toppling buildings tearing down trash
[00:57:41] ripping up the ground and oddly some
[00:57:45] things go flying all over the place we
[00:57:47] have yet to figure out why what is that
[00:57:50] that just flew in the distance what
[00:57:52] could it be I don't know but Mike's
[00:57:54] hiding in the vault right now he goes in
[00:57:56] and he sees in the distance a pack of
[00:57:59] cards and a safe and he gets some Hunger
[00:58:03] Games oh my that's what he gets there
[00:58:06] somebody thought that was going to be
[00:58:07] important there and you needed to
[00:58:09] protect
[00:58:10] that so what we're going to do now is
[00:58:13] I'm going to put out another let's put
[00:58:15] up another card for uh our our giveaway
[00:58:18] here let's do a
[00:58:21] um let's do this

[01:10:56] or an item that will help you along the
[01:10:58] way oh my look at this out pups a clue
[01:11:04] now the human picks this clue up and
[01:11:06] goes H that's interesting I think I
[01:11:08] might help get some help from this that
[01:11:10] directs him a little direct somewhere
[01:11:12] and they
[01:11:14] find some thing there they picked that
[01:11:17] up that's the wrong one is that the
[01:11:19] right one no they find a
[01:11:21] clue oh no that's right here it's this
[01:11:24] one
[01:11:26] they find a clue their buddy comes up
[01:11:28] with a clue and that helps them along
[01:11:30] the Wasteland they are now 1 2 3 4 five
[01:11:33] six strength as they wander through the
[01:11:35] Wasteland you're looking for another
[01:11:37] friend to help you potentially an item
[01:11:39] oh no though this is not a friend or an
[01:11:41] item this is an enemy a thror comes down
[01:11:44] taking your clue away from you but
[01:11:47] that's okay because you still have five
[01:11:50] strength as you wander through the
[01:11:51] Wasteland here and that's going to give
[01:11:52] you the potential of beating four I

[01:12:15] got five strength as you wander through

[01:12:21] go wandering by and there by the uh a
[01:12:24] river and out of that River pops this
[01:12:28] watch in the water he grabs you throws
[01:12:30] you around a little bit luckily though
[01:12:32] you land next to a vault when he's done

[01:21:20] yeah we can do that and one of them came
[01:21:22] up with doing those and I was like
[01:21:23] that's a good idea
[01:21:27] ice
[01:21:31] cream
[01:21:34] man there we go ice cream
[01:21:37] man and I will put all these things in
[01:21:39] topl loaders before shipping I just uh
[01:21:42] been doing it this way so I can get
[01:21:43] everything packed away and go through
[01:21:45] what everybody has ordered if you need
[01:21:47] me to put something in top loader right
[01:21:48] away like there's a really expensive
[01:21:49] card I generally will um because I catch
[01:21:52] it but um if there's one you want me to
[01:21:53] I definitely will just let me know but I
[01:21:55] get it in a way anyways for shipping you
[01:21:57] all know that you all know that so we're
[01:22:00] going to put up another you know what
[01:22:02] this is going to be I think my
[01:22:04] last my last Fallout box that we have
[01:22:08] here this may be my last one because the
[01:22:10] order that I placed the six more that I
[01:22:13] ordered I was supposed to have 12 total
[01:22:15] uh that six more that I ordered never
[01:22:17] ended up showing or shipping and I kept
[01:22:18] asking what's going on what's going on
[01:22:20] got ignored and then I finally ended up
[01:22:22] just getting a re a refund on it cuz I'm
[01:22:24] guessing I'm not getting it um
[01:22:27] so just be careful generally have good
[01:22:30] luck with some of these sellers on eBay
[01:22:32] when they have um good good reputations
[01:22:34] why does that not want to open I thought
[01:22:36] I cut through that but uh this one I
[01:22:39] don't like badmouthing people I just sa
[01:22:40] this one for whatever reason well I know
[01:22:43] the reason they thought they could make
[01:22:43] more money because I bought it when it
[01:22:45] was like $300 a box from them and that's
[01:22:47] why I bought it under $300 box from and
[01:22:49] that's why they canceled it probably
[01:22:50] sold them so that's all shitty shitty
[01:22:54] shitty but what can you do we're going
[01:22:55] to pull
[01:22:57] out we're going to pull out the second
[01:22:59] from the on the right that's what we're

[02:07:11] because I I worked with the stock
[02:07:13] exchanges overnight I managed about
[02:07:14] anyway like 30% of the Asia Pacific
[02:07:17] Stock Exchange traffic was being managed
[02:07:19] through the hardware that I
[02:07:20] single-handedly Vantage by myself
[02:07:22] overnight for the company that I worked
[02:07:24] for and they never had the same holidays
[02:07:26] as us so I never had a i for almost two
[02:07:29] years had zero breaks like I work pretty
[02:07:32] much seven days a week because they'd
[02:07:33] always need something on on a Saturday
[02:07:35] or weekend for me to do something and uh
[02:07:38] yeah I understand that I had to I left
[02:07:39] when they didn't want to when they said
[02:07:41] they were going to give me a raise and
[02:07:42] then they only gave me half of it and

[02:08:17] managed that stuff and I was busy all

[02:08:20] I watched millions of dollars being
[02:08:22] traded on a regular basis like trillions

[02:32:37] more with the average well whatever this
[02:32:40] is um I like to use MTG stocks because
[02:32:43] it pulls it from multiple sites so like
[02:32:45] I can go from it'll pull from multiple
[02:32:47] sites here so that's why I uh I like to

[04:26:17] that's going off for 15 right now we
[04:26:20] like to do some things at the end of the
[04:26:21] stream I like to do kind of like buyers
[04:26:23] giveaways for the people that hang out
[04:26:24] and want to jump in and buy something
[04:26:26] give them a little discount on stuff
[04:26:28] that way you get a discount on things
[04:26:29] it's kind of my like way of doing a
[04:26:31] buyer giveaway but not doing a buyer
[04:26:33] giveaway if that makes any sense I can
[04:26:36] guarantee a person that's buying
[04:26:37] something gets the discount if that I
[04:26:39] don't know how else to say that I like
[04:26:41] to just do stuff like that at the end in
[04:26:42] the Stream for people that have been
[04:26:43] purchasing if that makes any sense it's
[04:26:45] hard for me to explain that because if I
[04:26:47] do a buyer giveaway we don't always get
[04:26:49] to get stuff but I'll do some I will do
[04:26:52] a regular buyers giveway at the end of

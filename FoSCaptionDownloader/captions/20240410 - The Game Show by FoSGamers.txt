[00:15:00] my um internet stopped working well so
[00:15:03] in the process of that I think I'm going
[00:15:05] to do this I'm going to try something
[00:15:07] here we're g turn that
[00:15:11] off we're gonna do this since I don't
[00:15:14] really have anybody doing anything at
[00:15:16] the moment so I'm not too
[00:15:18] worried I'm going to do this I'm gonna
[00:15:21] try
[00:15:23] this I want to see if
[00:15:27] this
[00:15:30] yes we did find out they are
[00:15:32] good they are
[00:15:36] good H I do have freezing
[00:15:40] still why is this happening every time
[00:15:43] that is on there should be no
[00:15:47] reason okay
[00:15:50] cool
[00:15:54] cool well looks like um whatnot is being
[00:15:58] an [ __ ]
[00:15:59] and will not let me play music in the
[00:16:01] background because anytime music goes
[00:16:03] they decide to freeze my
[00:16:04] channel I've noticed that
[00:16:09] recently every time I have music playing
[00:16:12] I have one gig connection for my
[00:16:15] speed anytime I put music on whatnot I
[00:16:19] all of a sudden start freezing and
[00:16:21] hanging interesting
[00:16:24] huh starting to get actually really
[00:16:26] ticked off about
[00:16:27] it
[00:16:37] and we did find out about the Japanese
[00:16:41] packs they are fine my my one of these
[00:16:44] is just so weird why is this doing this
[00:16:46] so backed
[00:16:49] up it's like my hand look at my hand I
[00:16:51] have both hands up here and one of them
[00:16:52] is moving right now so I'm magic at the
[00:16:55] moment
[00:16:56] currently this is what not doing this by
[00:16:58] the way I'm currently magic I have three
[00:17:01] hands you know look at that I have three
[00:17:03] hands you notice that
[00:17:06] Y what is going on here this is
[00:17:10] insane it's your
[00:17:12] [Laughter]
[00:17:15] third yep it's my third
[00:17:18] hand put a TV in the background and play
[00:17:20] it off that a stream had issues as well
[00:17:24] I was actually wondering should take
[00:17:25] other kid tablet play music on tablet no
[00:17:29] using um your children's I'm using a
[00:17:31] tablet though to play it on I'm playing
[00:17:34] it from my tablet it's not even touching
[00:17:35] it from my computer that's what I'm
[00:17:37] saying I don't know what's going on here
[00:17:38] I'm gonna try give me something quickly
[00:17:40] I'm gonna do something quickly here I'm
[00:17:41] gonna adjust my camera I'm GNA see if my
[00:17:43] camera's freezing
[00:17:46] here because it shouldn't be I actually
[00:17:49] think it's something
[00:17:53] else this is really getting
[00:17:56] annoying really annoying
[00:17:59] huh a
[00:18:02] lot yeah I know it's been happening a
[00:18:05] lot
[00:18:07] lately well it's good
[00:18:14] now yeah it's I know this has been
[00:18:16] happening a lot lately it's just
[00:18:17] frustrating that it's been happening a
[00:18:19] lot
[00:18:20] lately I'm going to put that away put
[00:18:23] that over there because everything is
[00:18:24] hardwired into a one gig connection
[00:18:26] there's no problem on my end
[00:18:32] and that's what I'm getting frustrated
[00:18:33] on stuff because it's making my stream
[00:18:36] end up being shitty because I can't do
[00:18:38] anything I end up freezing and hanging
[00:18:39] and losing a bunch of people hanging out
[00:18:41] I was at a you know that's what
[00:18:48] happens yeah I was playing off a tablet
[00:18:51] so I that's what I was meaning I was
[00:18:52] playing off my tablet which was
[00:18:53] confusing for me um why die bye but yes
[00:18:56] we did figure out these are actual real
[00:18:59] they are the reason why they had the top
[00:19:00] the these on the top is they are packs
[00:19:02] that were actually buil um made for
[00:19:05] stores in Japan to put on hangers and in
[00:19:07] Japan they put them on hangers they
[00:19:08] don't leave them in the boxes they all
[00:19:10] take them out and put them on hangers
[00:19:11] somebody said so that's why they are we
[00:19:13] did find out they are actually
[00:19:16] legit so I'll put one of them up here
[00:19:18] why not we'll put one of them up for
[00:19:20] here with an adventure we'll call that
[00:19:22] who wants wants jump in on that we'll
[00:19:24] start it off with three strength why not
[00:19:25] for this one even though it's a low one
[00:19:27] we'll start it out with three
[00:19:29] and see how that
[00:19:32] goes all right dby is going to go with
[00:19:35] it all right there we go die bye yeah so
[00:19:38] I reached out to a couple of um things
[00:19:41] in regards to Reddit YouTube and I
[00:19:43] actually uh YouTube a a um a uh Facebook
[00:19:48] and then also I um um called somebody
[00:19:52] that I knew in the area that had told me
[00:19:54] about the difference between Japanese
[00:19:56] packs and the American packs before
[00:19:57] where like ones had the tear and ones
[00:19:59] that don't and I asked them and they
[00:20:00] said yes they would have they
[00:20:01] potentially do have them um depending on
[00:20:03] where they came from so there we go so
[00:20:06] die going in with this we'll say this is
[00:20:08] three strength like I was saying on the
[00:20:09] adventure in the Wasteland here so with
[00:20:11] that being said we're going to do this
[00:20:15] all right we're going to put up our
[00:20:18] character decide what you want to be I'm
[00:20:20] going to put this right here off to the
[00:20:22] side my friend and I'm going to pull
[00:20:24] these on over and we'll see where you
[00:20:26] want to start for your you're going to
[00:20:27] be all human in eight all right I like
[00:20:29] it human in all eight all right so I'm
[00:20:32] going to do that for all of them we're
[00:20:34] going to get this taken care of for you
[00:20:36] on a little Adventure in the Wasteland
[00:20:37] to start our day out I'm going to go
[00:20:39] with eight on all these and get
[00:20:40] everything ready and then we're going to
[00:20:41] start our character out one two three
[00:20:43] four five six seven and eight number
[00:20:48] eight one two three four five six seven
[00:20:51] and eight number
[00:20:56] eight Shuffle those up
[00:21:03] we go one two three four five six seven
[00:21:08] and eight number
[00:21:12] eight go and we Shuffle up our bosses
[00:21:16] here wait yep Shuffle up our bosses here
[00:21:19] wanted to make sure they were
[00:21:23] there all right one two three four five
[00:21:26] six seven and eight
[00:21:29] we're missing
[00:21:30] one I have to shuffle again because one
[00:21:32] was stuck in the back
[00:21:37] there one two three four five six seven
[00:21:41] eight I didn't see that stuck in the
[00:21:43] back up there I put those right there
[00:21:45] instead though this time all right so
[00:21:49] let's see what happens my friend as a
[00:21:52] human as you wander through this
[00:21:54] Wasteland you're looking as a human
[00:21:56] wandering through the Wasteland and as
[00:21:59] you go on your trip you see a treasure
[00:22:02] in the ground you lean over and you pick
[00:22:04] up that treasure but oh no that treasure
[00:22:06] is booby
[00:22:08] trapped it has now blown up but luckily
[00:22:11] you dropped it in time and you only have
[00:22:12] a concussion from it blowing you a
[00:22:14] little bit away from that treasure where
[00:22:16] you found it here we go let's see if we
[00:22:19] find anything else for you my friend
[00:22:21] let's get you some good luck here here
[00:22:23] we
[00:22:24] go oh we have a clue as they are
[00:22:27] wandering through the Wasteland with the
[00:22:29] concussion they see a clue and for a
[00:22:34] human that clue oh hold on a second I
[00:22:37] think that clue is
[00:22:39] helpful the clue is helpful it gives him
[00:22:42] a little bit of a tip tells them where
[00:22:44] to go to find some town hall now they
[00:22:47] are back up to uh three strength as you

[00:37:23] right that's one of them it'll go up
[00:37:26] there a little crooker let me straighten
[00:37:29] that
[00:37:31] out there we go that's a little sign one
[00:37:34] there and I'm going to run that giveaway
[00:37:35] again saying thank you all for hanging
[00:37:36] out with
[00:37:38] us try typing it like try typing the
[00:37:41] first half of the word and then the
[00:37:43] second half of the word that way I can
[00:37:44] see it on two different lines maybe that
[00:37:47] will
[00:37:48] work I mean if it's not inappropriate
[00:37:51] just do that I don't know why it's
[00:37:53] muting someone though that seems
[00:37:55] weird all right we're going to put this
[00:37:57] out here here do that for ours you know
[00:37:59] what actually I'm going to grab this I'm
[00:38:01] going to grab this instead we're going
[00:38:03] to do this and time spiral because we
[00:38:06] had some good luck with the other one
[00:38:07] all
[00:38:10] right that is so weird that it's doing
[00:38:12] that and blocking
[00:38:17] it I'm going to throw this up for an
[00:38:19] adventurer in our
[00:38:21] Wasteland or maybe somebody wants to do
[00:38:23] the short version I don't know if you
[00:38:24] want to do the short version that's like
[00:38:26] the POG man thing so we'll do this for
[00:38:30] this here if you want
[00:38:35] it what's up what device is kind of a
[00:38:39] device is he I don't know he's getting
[00:38:41] mut it's saying he's muted he's saying
[00:38:42] something wrong and appropriate
[00:38:44] supposedly so I don't understand what's
[00:38:47] I don't understand why
[00:38:48] muted can I see the muted questions
[00:38:51] buyers bods muted see it says muted but
[00:38:55] it won't tell me what is muted that's
[00:38:57] the thing that annoys me it says show
[00:38:58] the muted this message is muted I
[00:39:00] clicked on it and I can't see
[00:39:06] it mod somebody and they can see there
[00:39:10] are people that Mo are modded all right
[00:39:12] hold on a second yeah hold on I'll mod
[00:39:15] somebody give me a
[00:39:18] second give me a second let me mod
[00:39:25] somebody actually
[00:39:29] oh here why is that here Alpha you're
[00:39:31] going to be a mod here for for today
[00:39:34] how's that the boys are doing well the
[00:39:36] boys are doing well thank you for asking
[00:39:39] they're off at school right now
[00:39:41] so maybe uh maybe somebody else wants to
[00:39:44] jump in on a good pack
[00:39:49] there yeah so there you maybe that's
[00:39:51] what it is can you see the muted stuff
[00:39:54] now that is so weird I should be able to
[00:39:56] see the muted stuff there's a button
[00:39:58] that says muted and if I click on that I
[00:40:00] should be able to see what's there
[00:40:02] that's frustrating part to me on some of
[00:40:04] this is that I go to do these things I'm
[00:40:06] like I can't get to it because it won't
[00:40:08] let me so let's throw something like
[00:40:10] this out if you want to do the little
[00:40:12] Adventure
[00:40:17] game and that's going to do it for this
[00:40:21] here and do you see why it's being muted
[00:40:23] by the way I can't seem to figure it
[00:40:26] out

[00:40:30] try it moose moosey we will try it

[01:00:58] a will
[01:01:02] signed All right a will sign
[01:01:04] one no look at this I don't even know
[01:01:07] what that card is why'd he put that card
[01:01:09] in there hold on a second I don't know
[01:01:12] why he put that card in
[01:01:23] there oh that's why I put it in there
[01:01:26] because it was in the all right that was
[01:01:28] I thought that was a different card
[01:01:29] anyways we'll get a a nice foil and a
[01:01:32] sign from here a will sign and a foil I
[01:01:35] thought that was a different card for
[01:01:36] some
[01:01:39] reason there you
[01:01:41] go how does a game work all right so
[01:01:45] your adventure the pogman battle on this
[01:01:48] one is a very simple game all right this
[01:01:51] is a very simple one I literally have
[01:01:53] pogs here my wife came up with this one
[01:01:55] this was not mine idea this is my wife
[01:01:56] so she had it and I actually people have
[01:01:58] liked it so far what we do is I have the
[01:02:02] pogs here we try I try to slam them over
[01:02:04] to get up to seven strength if you get
[01:02:06] seven strength you go up against with
[01:02:07] the boss here and you have a 60% chance
[01:02:10] of beating 10 bosses in here and if you
[01:02:13] beat one we do a $1 Loot drop for
[01:02:15] everybody in the Wasteland and you
[01:02:16] always get one of our ball packs at the
[01:02:18] top though here for uh hanging out and
[01:02:20] hang and doing your thing and Bri and
[01:02:22] Bri BR and Brier I think n Brier I think
[01:02:27] I'm reading that wrong so for instance
[01:02:30] say you wanted just the one ioria all
[01:02:32] right we'll say you wanted that one
[01:02:33] ioria
[01:02:35] Japanese I'll throw that out there for
[01:02:37] the pogman just a quick
[01:02:39] one all right we'll do that and I'll say
[01:02:41] you know what we'll say this is two
[01:02:42] attempts what I would do here is ID end
[01:02:44] up moving this over put that up there
[01:02:46] out of the way put that out of the way
[01:02:48] and then we do this you know slam it
[01:02:49] down and try to see how many I would
[01:02:51] flip over if I can get up to hopefully
[01:02:53] seven for you to get the highest amount
[01:02:54] of strength to go up against the ball L
[01:02:56] now I'm not good at this I haven't
[01:02:58] played it in many years and I only do it
[01:02:59] every now and again because people
[01:03:01] request it or I put it out here and
[01:03:03] sometimes people do it but that's really
[01:03:05] what it is there you get your ioria
[01:03:07] that's up here and uh we do the little
[01:03:10] game to see if we do a $1 Loot drop for
[01:03:12] the Wasteland and you always get one of
[01:03:14] the ball packs there for
[01:03:16] playing so dby likes the Japanese one so
[01:03:20] we're going to do that we're going to
[01:03:21] put that right here that's going to get
[01:03:22] you two we're calling that two attempts
[01:03:26] okay and with those two attempts this is
[01:03:29] what we're going to do

[01:06:03] Fleer aidian 2350 is what was packed
[01:06:08] away in the vault there for all of
[01:06:10] eternity when the world was coming to an
[01:06:11] end so there you go my friend we're
[01:06:14] going to do that we'll rip your packs
[01:06:16] open and we have a win that we get to do
[01:06:18] a $1 Loot drop again a$1 Loot drop
[01:06:21] because
[01:06:22] by die
[01:06:24] by die by beat the boss so here we go
[01:06:28] while I rip their packs open die by's
[01:06:30] packs we do
[01:06:32] this throw this on here for a $1 Loot
[01:06:36] drop and if you want to jump on it you
[01:06:39] do and here we go my
[01:06:42] friends and we're going to get to
[01:06:44] ripping this and if you want would you
[01:06:46] like me to open the
[01:06:49] yidian you do not win the boss no you do
[01:06:52] not win the boss no you do not win the
[01:06:54] boss the so I'm going to explain what
[01:06:57] happens
[01:06:58] here I used to have it a little
[01:07:00] differently where I um I actually had it
[01:07:04] where when you won if you beat the boss
[01:07:07] you actually used to win there was like
[01:07:09] a pack that you would win all right um
[01:07:12] somebody complained about it and said
[01:07:14] that I was doing something I guess
[01:07:16] illegal in regards to giving St away so
[01:07:19] I cannot give anything away when you
[01:07:22] beat a boss anymore that's why you
[01:07:24] everybody gets a vault pack and the only
[01:07:26] thing I can do is the $1 the loop drop
[01:07:29] thing because whatnot rules and some I'm
[01:07:35] just going to call it out there some
[01:07:36] little [ __ ] complained that they did
[01:07:39] not win when they got their packs of
[01:07:41] cards here which is what they paid for
[01:07:44] the extra thing for free they didn't
[01:07:48] win so they complained and what not
[01:07:51] suspended
[01:07:52] me so I can't do that anymore
[01:07:56] yes so I have to do it this way sadly
[01:07:59] because of um whatnot and a little [ __ ]
[01:08:04] that
[01:08:05] complained it I don't I would I wouldn't
[01:08:08] even say it was a I don't think it was a
[01:08:09] bounty because it was
[01:08:11] free they the way bounties were my
[01:08:14] understanding was you bought something
[01:08:16] cheaper with a PR chance of getting
[01:08:18] something more expensive you bought the
[01:08:20] exact same thing and you got something
[01:08:22] extra free was what I was doing so I was
[01:08:26] doing it different than the way the
[01:08:27] Bounty was so that's why I was
[01:08:29] thoroughly confused on how that
[01:08:32] occurred so yeah anyways I'm sorry I
[01:08:35] can't do it that way anymore I had to
[01:08:37] give a little explanation there but
[01:08:39] there we go I'm going to rip your packs
[01:08:44] open yeah some places let you do
[01:08:46] different ones but die bye Let's cross
[01:08:47] yes cross our fingers let's get some
[01:08:49] Godzilla here but yes that is literally
[01:08:52] the reason why I have to do it the way
[01:08:53] I'm doing it now it was actually a lot
[01:08:55] more fun the other way I did
[01:08:57] it and I was giving stuff away free but
[01:09:01] people complain that they didn't get the
[01:09:02] same free is the next person so this is
[01:09:06] where we
[01:09:07] are this is our dinosaur
[01:09:10] token I can't remember what that one is
[01:09:13] that's a Tusk
[01:09:15] something um I can't remember that
[01:09:18] one can't remember that
[01:09:22] one that's one of the lands can't
[01:09:25] remember oh that's the archipelago I
[01:09:28] think playing uh uh swamp o I don't know
[01:09:33] what that one
[01:09:34] is does anybody know what that one is I
[01:09:38] haven't seen that one
[01:09:40] before this is uh the rampaging
[01:09:44] Raptor oh this is uh the geo geo GE oh I
[01:09:49] can't remember what the name of that one
[01:09:51] is par pcup or parakeet pcup whatever
[01:09:55] that one is
[01:09:57] is um I can't remember that one
[01:09:59] either and oh look at that I think
[01:10:02] that's a kria triome nice K Tri a
[01:10:06] triome and I don't know what that one
[01:10:10] is that's not a Godzilla but then you
[01:10:13] also get your uh
[01:10:17] your antler I can't remember what that
[01:10:19] one is but that's not a Godzilla you
[01:10:21] anyone know what that
[01:10:22] is the number on it is 38
[01:10:26] for um for this one and ioria 310 is a
[01:10:31] triome or you talking about this here
[01:10:33] this one is
[01:10:36] 47 because this is weird it's from
[01:10:39] C20 so I don't know what one that is you
[01:10:42] know what I
[01:10:43] mean it's one of those like insert ones

[01:13:24] while to figure stuff out and quite

[01:14:32] least there's like I've worked in
[01:14:34] different many different businesses I
[01:14:37] work with lawyers now and quite frankly
[01:14:40] the way they're doing this does seem
[01:14:42] backwards um and I asked one of the
[01:14:44] lawyers and they're like they could
[01:14:45] potentially get in trouble for that but
[01:14:47] I haven't no one's pushed no one's
[01:14:49] pushed it probably enough so let me do
[01:14:51] another giveaway up here for you all
[01:14:54] this this is a from Nolan pack noan
[01:15:01] pack but I I work with a for an
[01:15:04] insurance company with a large large
[01:15:07] large insurance company so I talk to
[01:15:09] lawyers every single day and I asked a
[01:15:10] couple random questions about stuff
[01:15:12] every now and again so that's what
[01:15:14] that's why I kind of learn a little bit
[01:15:16] it's
[01:15:22] weird I want to do our not a problem for

[01:16:17] know what that one is in an under dark
[01:16:20] Beholder I've never seen the uh nin
[01:16:23] there
[01:16:30] and then someone add changes says
[01:16:32] something slightly different and it
[01:16:33] makes it not okay well that's the point
[01:16:34] is like if that happens like they have
[01:16:36] to keep it exactly the same and if they
[01:16:37] change it then they can get in trouble
[01:16:40] that's how it should be quite frankly is
[01:16:42] like hey we did this you have to do it
[01:16:43] exactly that way and if there's any
[01:16:45] change you have to go back through the
[01:16:47] authorization process it would make it
[01:16:50] better for them and everyone else

[01:21:14] here if you're not sure don't do it well
[01:21:18] yeah see I thought I was sure the way
[01:21:20] that I read it but um because the way
[01:21:23] that it explained was bounties was you
[01:21:24] had to buy in low to get something
[01:21:26] bigger in the way I was doing it you
[01:21:28] were getting what you were getting you
[01:21:30] weren't buying in low for anything you
[01:21:31] were just getting something free extra
[01:21:33] but I see what you're saying where
[01:21:35] they're saying it's a it's a I guess a
[01:21:36] gambling way where I guess I'm giving a
[01:21:39] I don't whatever they think it would be
[01:21:41] but it was that's why I just do the

[01:22:25] like is a I I can get him through my
[01:22:27] company at like like no charge it's like
[01:22:29] $2 a month but um so I actually have
[01:22:32] reached out to him and I'm just waiting
[01:22:34] for him to respond they said they were
[01:22:35] going to look at some stuff but it was
[01:22:37] going to take a few weeks because I'm
[01:22:38] not on a priority type thing since it's
[01:22:41] whatever which kind of sucks because of
[01:22:43] the what it is I'd have to pay a little
[01:22:44] bit extra I guess to get on a priority
[01:22:46] one so for me I won't do any big I'll do
[01:22:49] say this way for now and I have a couple
[01:22:51] other games that I have some ideas on
[01:22:53] but I'm waiting on them to uh approve to
[01:22:56] say if I can do it cuz if they say I can
[01:22:57] do it
[01:22:59] then then it's a lawyer telling me I can
[01:23:01] and they can go and are you with whatnot

[01:23:41] there just some pretty decent ones so
[01:23:47] far yeah I've talked to people the key
[01:23:50] is you don't want to violate Lottery
[01:23:52] laws which is Lottery which a Lottery is
[01:23:55] one someone paying for a chance to so
[01:23:58] you either have to remove the chance and
[01:24:00] everyone gets the same thing or remove
[01:24:02] something someone playing and only do it
[01:24:05] for a giveaway yeah yep so that's kind
[01:24:06] of exactly so that's why I've been doing
[01:24:08] it as the the $1 Loot drop thing is the
[01:24:10] way that I went I figured that out
[01:24:13] myself when they came back finally after
[01:24:15] I got suspended I'm like seriously guys
[01:24:17] you had to suspend me to give me the
[01:24:19] answer to the eping question you could
[01:24:21] have given it to me before and I could
[01:24:23] have actually just done this and we
[01:24:25] wouldn't have had a
[01:24:27] problem but I will say this orcish

[01:25:03] Seer foil in a soldier
[01:25:13] token yeah they don't want to get in
[01:25:15] fights with people who they suspend but
[01:25:17] people claiming they were told they were
[01:25:18] allowed to do it but they need to stop
[01:25:20] thinking that way they need to give
[01:25:22] people examples of what it is and okay
[01:25:25] and then hold them hold them to exactly
[01:25:28] yeah so like if I come back and say
[01:25:30] somebody said that they didn't agree
[01:25:31] with this and it was a considered
[01:25:34] something considered gambling for
[01:25:35] whatever reason they look at the policy
[01:25:37] and they should be able to send back
[01:25:38] rather than saying we've investigated
[01:25:40] this and confirmed that it goes against
[01:25:42] our policies it's like what part of it
[01:25:45] if you've done a thorough
[01:25:47] investigation what part of it goes
[01:25:50] against the policy and that's the thing
[01:25:52] that like like it took me probably 15
[01:25:55] emails to get that out of them I'm like
[01:25:57] I don't I'm like I'm fine you if you
[01:26:00] it's wrong I will make a change but what
[01:26:02] part of it that you did a thorough
[01:26:04] investigation is the problem because if
[01:26:06] you did the thorough investigation you
[01:26:08] should be able to say this here is a
[01:26:10] problem fix it and I fix it that's like

[01:26:49] some foils there nice those some pretty
[01:26:51] good time spiral packs there my friend
[01:26:54] thank
[01:27:00] you yeah yep that got you in trouble too
[01:27:04] because it was considered uh they didn't
[01:27:06] guarantee they weren't guaranteed it
[01:27:16] huh yeah that's just
[01:27:18] ridiculous well it really boils down to
[01:27:21] I've come to the conclusion that um
[01:27:25] there are lots of people that are Petty
[01:27:27] in this
[01:27:28] world and what goes around comes around
[01:27:31] to them when only thing they can do is
[01:27:34] look for bad things and be Petty because
[01:27:36] they're quite
[01:27:37] frankly just shitty people in the world
[01:27:40] the reason why the shitty things keep
[01:27:42] happening to them is because of what
[01:27:44] they're doing and if they start actually
[01:27:46] putting some effort into being good
[01:27:48] instead of being a jerk they're going to
[01:27:49] get a lot better things occurring to
[01:27:51] them in life but people don't realize
[01:27:53] that
[01:27:54] all they take is you know what this
[01:27:56] person did this I'm gonna be an [ __ ]
[01:27:58] forever and I'm gonna point at them and
[01:28:00] I'm gonna be this and I'm G call them
[01:28:01] out blah blah blah blah blah and then
[01:28:03] it's wondering why that
[01:28:07] happens I rep back and asked him to give
[01:28:09] me the time stamp of what the auctions
[01:28:12] wheel spin was and impossible because I
[01:28:14] didn't have any sales until 15 minutes
[01:28:16] they responded and said it doesn't
[01:28:17] matter this is just a warning yeah well
[01:28:20] the warning does matter when they say
[01:28:22] you're warning and you got two warnings
[01:28:23] and your suspend
[01:28:26] it so yes it does matter when you get a
[01:28:30] warning nice magas in a sudden and I
[01:28:33] will check some of these out before I
[01:28:35] ship them out I have to double check I'm
[01:28:37] not on sure of the pricing on all these
[01:28:39] ones but I'm going to double check on
[01:28:41] these before I ship those ones out for
[01:28:43] you my
[01:28:44] friend surge good ones I like those
[01:28:49] surge let me find your bag over here so
[01:28:53] I can put your all together together
[01:28:55] like to keep everybody as together as
[01:28:56] possible uh you know what I'm going to
[01:28:57] need to give you a new one I
[01:29:02] lied there we go
[01:29:10] Serge but I will say this they do um
[01:29:14] they they are I mean if you're
[01:29:16] respectful to them they are respectful
[01:29:17] back to you when you're talking to them
[01:29:20] the only problem is they just don't give
[01:29:21] a lot of information and I'm gonna put
[01:29:23] it this way working with some types of
[01:29:25] things that are lawyers myself um they
[01:29:28] could just be like a pargal and they
[01:29:29] don't even freaking know and then by the
[01:29:32] time it the only reason that it gets to
[01:29:33] somebody after to get that information
[01:29:35] when you're suspended is because you're
[01:29:37] suspended and it goes like up a chain to
[01:29:40] get to like the next person to suspend
[01:29:42] you and I think that's the reason why
[01:29:43] you get that information that's actually
[01:29:46] my guess is what I'm saying having yeah
[01:29:50] exactly that's my guess just I work with
[01:29:52] lawyers all day long so that's what my
[01:29:55] guess is is when you get suspended is
[01:29:57] when you finally talk to a lawyer that
[01:29:59] can give you the explanation of what is
[01:30:00] going
[01:30:07] on what are we doing today did somebody
[01:30:09] say what are we doing
[01:30:11] today we're just hanging out talking
[01:30:13] about stuff Jacob doing some uh doing
[01:30:18] some of our
[01:30:19] gibes doing some of our other stuff here
[01:30:22] that we always do and I'm going to put
[01:30:24] tuac in

[01:30:43] you Tac my
[01:30:47] friend and then I'm going to get another
[01:30:49] uh another thing up
[01:30:51] here for our for our game if anybody
[01:30:53] wants to play our adventure
[01:30:58] game no prtu
[01:31:02] vot or the supervisor La person who is
[01:31:04] the actual decision maker and not just a
[01:31:06] copy Paster and frequently asked
[01:31:07] questions yeah exactly you finally get
[01:31:09] to somebody that can answer the question
[01:31:12] that's what ends up happening and that's
[01:31:14] the thing that is shitty about it is
[01:31:16] like you get suspended because somebody
[01:31:20] doesn't know what they're doing for the
[01:31:21] most those what they're just going based
[01:31:23] off of
[01:31:25] like a script and the script doesn't
[01:31:29] explain anything for anyone so you just
[01:31:32] kind of sit there like what is going
[01:31:34] actually I'm GNA put this out you're so
[01:31:37] we're to a Japanese collector with that
[01:31:41] instead we're going to do our adventure
[01:31:43] game again
[01:31:45] here it's just I it's one of those
[01:31:47] things where if you have there should be
[01:31:50] different departments quite frankly
[01:31:52] working with um the these type of things
[01:31:56] myself um there should be I work with
[01:31:59] lawyers there every day like I said I
[01:32:01] deal the insurance company um they
[01:32:04] should have multiple
[01:32:06] departments what sus is the people that
[01:32:08] not who are asking like you and me are
[01:32:10] not trying to get a get out of jail free
[01:32:12] card we just want to know what they
[01:32:14] think of an idea and how they would
[01:32:16] interpret something before it's a
[01:32:17] problem exactly you and me are just
[01:32:19] exactly we're just trying to make sure
[01:32:21] we're doing the right thing we're not
[01:32:22] trying to be like oh they said this is
[01:32:24] okay be but that's a
[01:32:27] problem is there's somebody that's going
[01:32:29] to probably do
[01:32:31] that I
[01:32:33] have Fallout surge foils I have a
[01:32:37] Japanese surge foil
[01:32:40] actually come to
[01:32:43] ask I have a
[01:32:46] Japanese um Harden scale surge foil is
[01:32:50] that something you'd be interested
[01:32:52] in
[01:32:59] I wasn't sure what I was going to do
[01:33:00] with that yet so I kind of just uh you
[01:33:03] know sat there and let it go and I I
[01:33:05] just kind of had it sitting there for a
[01:33:07] little bit okay no problem I do have a
[01:33:10] surge foil but it's I'm sorry I did Keep
[01:33:12] It In My Own collection I did buy a box
[01:33:13] and it happened to come out of that one
[01:33:14] and I've sold the other ones that we had
[01:33:16] uh we do have some more Fallout we also
[01:33:18] have the mystery booster mystery packs
[01:33:20] that have a bunch of Fallout packs in
[01:33:21] there that you can potentially get a
[01:33:23] Fallout pack for 20
[01:33:25] bucks all right let's throw this out
[01:33:27] here for our adventure game and we'll uh
[01:33:30] try this for those that want to get in
[01:33:32] here and I'm going to throw this out for
[01:33:36] this yeah it's just shitty that when we
[01:33:38] try to be good and do the right thing
[01:33:41] Robert we
[01:33:43] um we get in trouble you know like it's
[01:33:48] one of those things where you can't no
[01:33:50] matter
[01:33:52] what
[01:33:54] there's going to be a bad
[01:33:56] apple and the majority of people aren't
[01:33:58] trying to be and that's the problem is
[01:34:01] that you can't base everything off of
[01:34:02] the One Bad Apple and a lot of this
[01:34:04] world nowadays is basing everything on
[01:34:06] the lowest common denominator and the
[01:34:07] One Bad Apple instead
[01:34:10] of
[01:34:12] um promoting the good thing and
[01:34:15] literally just freaking hammering down
[01:34:18] on that bad apple and getting rid of
[01:34:20] them and that's the problem that we give
[01:34:22] them too many Chan es those bad apples
[01:34:25] to continue to poison our Orchard so get
[01:34:29] rid of the freaking thing all right
[01:34:31] bunny here we go you're going on an
[01:34:33] adventure here we are going to call this
[01:34:35] three strength for your adventure in the
[01:34:37] Wasteland my friend now have you ever
[01:34:39] played this adventure because if not you
[01:34:41] get your choice of a character you know
[01:34:43] we're going to call that four strength
[01:34:45] you're going to get your adventure of a
[01:34:46] character this is an nioria booster and
[01:34:48] a Legends right there get those up there
[01:34:50] and then you go through these you pick
[01:34:53] your character and you go as a um
[01:34:57] whatever it is and you pick one out of
[01:34:58] each of these so you get a red a green
[01:35:00] and a blue and then you go up against
[01:35:03] the boss here which is one out of 10 so
[01:35:05] this is one out of 78 78 12 for the blue
[01:35:09] and then 10 for our bosses and you go
[01:35:13] through that uh seeing what happens and
[01:35:15] if you happen to be able to beat the
[01:35:16] boss on this Wasteland
[01:35:20] Adventure bunny that is and we're going
[01:35:22] to put up uh
[01:35:24] a Nolan sign we'll do a Nolan
[01:35:33] sign going to be a strong human I like
[01:35:36] it strong human going through the
[01:35:38] Wasteland
[01:35:47] here yes exactly tell an obvious
[01:35:52] problem exactly if there's something
[01:35:54] that is an obvious problem like no
[01:35:56] that's definitely a problem don't do it
[01:35:58] then you can think of something
[01:35:59] different
[01:36:00] exactly so you decide to be a strong
[01:36:02] human you get a point pull from each one
[01:36:03] of these tell me where you'd like to go
[01:36:05] in each one of those boxes to see if you
[01:36:07] can get added strength you can get up to
[01:36:09] three extra strength by going through
[01:36:11] the year to go up to the boss in the
[01:36:12] Wasteland where you could potentially
[01:36:14] have seven strength because you have
[01:36:15] four to start with to see where you
[01:36:17] could beat a
[01:36:19] boss and that's the reason why I have to
[01:36:21] do the game this way where we do a $1
[01:36:22] Loot drop instead of doing the thing at
[01:36:24] the end for
[01:36:29] that bunny did I miss you did I lose
[01:36:34] you all the front ones all right I like
[01:36:37] it
[01:36:39] one two and I have to shuffle these
[01:36:42] because we always do Shuffle the
[01:36:46] blue because there's only a handful of
[01:36:51] them all right with the front one you
[01:36:54] said and Shuffle up our
[01:36:58] bosses we do the front one there
[01:37:10] too and that's the front one there all
[01:37:13] right we're going with the front one on
[01:37:14] them
[01:37:15] all let's see what happens here my
[01:37:20] friend as a strong human you go
[01:37:24] wandering through this Wasteland you
[01:37:26] look for food be
[01:37:28] money but you do find something glinting
[01:37:31] in the area you go wandering over to it
[01:37:33] oh treasure but it's booby trapped oh no
[01:37:37] you pick up treasure and it happens have
[01:37:39] a bomb in there you drop that bomb but
[01:37:41] in not in time to run away where you do
[01:37:44] get blown a little bit in the distance
[01:37:45] and you're now at three strength as you
[01:37:47] wander through the Wasteland but maybe
[01:37:49] you'll find a friend along the way be
[01:37:50] money that'll help you and a power Stone
[01:37:54] you end up coming across a power Stone
[01:37:56] and for oh crap where' that
[01:37:59] go dang it my my thing went
[01:38:04] away I believe Power Stone helps a human
[01:38:06] but I need to double
[01:38:08] check we're saying the Power Stone helps
[01:38:10] a human I don't know where it is the
[01:38:12] Power Stone helps a human this time
[01:38:14] because I can't remember where it is at
[01:38:15] the moment and we're saying that helps
[01:38:17] the human and there you go my friend
[01:38:20] you're going to have up to four strength
[01:38:23] back up to four strength as you go
[01:38:24] through the adventure in the Wasteland
[01:38:26] here why is this hanging all the
[01:38:37] time yeah exactly you can never get a
[01:38:39] yes
[01:38:40] exactly I know that you go wandering
[01:38:43] through and you see in the distance oh
[01:38:46] no it is not a friend a thror comes down
[01:38:50] diving toward you with that power stone
[01:38:52] that you had slicing your face but
[01:38:55] luckily you dro the Power Stone and
[01:38:57] that's all it was after and you just
[01:38:58] have a now a slice across your forehead
[01:39:00] as you wander through the Wasteland with
[01:39:02] three strength but that is okay you do
[01:39:04] have the potential of beating up to
[01:39:07] four uh up to two bosses in this
[01:39:10] Wasteland so let's see which one we
[01:39:13] get flexing your way through the
[01:39:15] Wasteland yes I know let's go be money
[01:39:19] you have oh with four strength you do
[01:39:22] not have it the T-Rex comes on R
[01:39:25] trampling on through the Wasteland here
[01:39:28] and that does not sadly he grabs you by
[01:39:32] the foot when he's gring through and he
[01:39:34] grabs you and he drags you around the
[01:39:36] Wasteland for a little while but luckily
[01:39:38] when he leaves you he doesn't actually
[01:39:40] eat you he must have aten dinner earlier
[01:39:42] today and he just wanted to play with an
[01:39:43] animal like a toy like a dog or
[01:39:45] something you know what I mean I don't
[01:39:46] know but he drops you and you're at a
[01:39:48] Wasteland by a a vault and you go
[01:39:50] stumbling into that Vault with your
[01:39:52] hobbling on your broken leg there chewed
[01:39:54] up leg and you find a safe and a and in
[01:39:56] that safe you find one of these

[01:50:05] wrong I'm just doing exactly what your
[01:50:06] rules say there we go thank
[01:50:09] you there's always one I know there's
[01:50:13] always one all G to put that giveaway up
[01:50:16] there throw that on up oh I have it
[01:50:17] running there we go and I'm going to put
[01:50:21] out another Adventure game actually
[01:50:24] let's do a quick one this it's getting
[01:50:26] towards the end of my day we're going to
[01:50:27] do a
[01:50:28] pogman pogman battle instead I'm going
[01:50:31] to put out another
[01:50:35] ioria um we ioria
[01:50:38] uh another ioria collector booster
[01:50:41] Japanese here we're going to throw this
[01:50:44] out with the pogman battle we
[01:50:48] here and we'll uh we'll do that and if
[01:50:50] you happen to get three strength I mean
[01:50:51] not seven strength or more we can uh you
[01:50:53] can potentially beat 60% of the bosses
[01:50:56] which are right here in the
[01:50:58] back there you go but yeah all the Vault
[01:51:02] packs were just literally dirt cheap
[01:51:03] things that I bought I was actually just
[01:51:05] trying to find something that was really
[01:51:06] cheap that it would be like when I was
[01:51:07] doing the adventure game where they
[01:51:09] would go into the Vault and somebody
[01:51:11] would find in the vault something in the
[01:51:13] safe there's something cool to have
[01:51:15] extra free is really what I was trying
[01:51:17] to
[01:51:18] do but yeah then that's where I was
[01:51:22] doing like the the thing where it is the
[01:51:25] uh that's why I was doing before they
[01:51:26] could win something but now instead I
[01:51:28] have to do it this
[01:51:36] way now everything that you are not
[01:51:38] allowed to do with regards to bonuses
[01:51:42] bounties actas or giveaways are
[01:51:43] completely allowed to do for winners of
[01:51:45] giveaways so that's why you can do run
[01:51:48] those things but you have to do it only
[01:51:51] someone for someone who didn't pay for a
[01:51:53] chance ah okay so like the the gambling
[01:51:58] is type ones you can do but you have to
[01:52:02] do it where it's a free thing being
[01:52:04] given away to anyone oh all right that's
[01:52:08] interesting because I don't even like
[01:52:10] doing the gambling type ones but if
[01:52:11] there's something like that maybe we can
[01:52:13] you know maybe I'll figure something out
[01:52:15] to do like that for a little uh game
[01:52:18] that way we can do some of the giveaway
[01:52:20] games make a giveaway game and
[01:52:24] instead not a bad one there I might do
[01:52:28] that you're heading
[01:52:30] out yes all right I'll see you tomorrow
[01:52:35] tonight you'll be awake love you she's
[01:52:38] got some thing she has to do until like
[01:52:39] nine o'clock tonight so I'm not going to
[01:52:40] see her you can run your game where if
[01:52:43] they beat the boss they get something
[01:52:45] more but it can only be for the winner
[01:52:47] of the giveaway they can't have it paid
[01:52:48] for chance all right cool I like that
[01:52:51] idea you know what maybe that's why I'll
[01:52:52] do is I'll end up having some of our
[01:52:54] games where um the bosses will
[01:53:00] uh you'll be able to do that in some of

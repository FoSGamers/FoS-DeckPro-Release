## Historical Rules & Checklists

### Gold Standard Summary & Checklist (Legacy)
- All personal files are in user_private/ and listed in .gitignore.
- All build artifacts and large files are in .gitignore and never committed.
- No build artifacts or large files are present in git history (use git filter-repo if needed).
- All code is modular, documented, and tested (with docstrings and unit tests).
- All configuration and constants are centralized.
- All features are independently enable/disable-able.
- All UI/UX follows a consistent style guide.
- All error handling is user-friendly and provides safe fallbacks.
- Every code change is accompanied by a test and documentation update.
- Changelog is updated for every release or significant change.
- All scripts (start_feature.sh, finish_release.sh, onboarding.sh, clean_for_release.sh) are present and used.
- Onboarding script is added to your shell profile for reminders.
- GitHub Actions for release hygiene and old release cleanup are enabled.
- Branch protection rules are set for main and release branches.
- All PRs and issues use the provided templates and checklists.
- All documentation (README.md, RELEASE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, PROJECT_WORKFLOW_TEMPLATE.md) is up to date and explicit.
- No secrets, credentials, or sensitive data are ever committed.
- All contributors are aware of and follow these rules.

### Legacy Branch and PR Process
- All work must be done in feature branches or personal-dev.
- Never merge unfinished or untested work into main.
- All PRs must be reviewed and pass all CI checks.
- All PRs must update the changelog and documentation as needed.

### Legacy Internal Notes
- Modular Design: All features must be implemented as separate, encapsulated modules or classes with clear, documented interfaces.
- No Cross-Module Manipulation: Modules must not directly access or modify the internals of other modules. Use public methods, events, or signals/slots for communication.
- Backward Compatibility: Never break or remove a working feature without a migration plan and tests. All refactors must maintain backward compatibility.
- Incremental Refactoring: Refactor in small, testable steps. After each step, verify that all features still work before proceeding.
- Unit Testing: Every module must have unit tests for its core logic. Run all tests after each change or refactor.
- Documentation: All code, modules, and changes must be clearly documented. Every class and function should have a docstring explaining its purpose and usage.
- Version Control Discipline: Use git branches for each feature or refactor. Commit frequently with clear messages. Never merge unfinished or untested work into main.
- Centralized Configuration: All configuration, constants, and settings must be centralized in a config file or module.
- Consistent UI/UX: All UI components must follow a consistent style and interaction pattern, defined in a style guide or shared resource.
- Safe Fallbacks and Error Handling: All features must provide safe fallbacks and clear, user-friendly error messages. The app must gracefully recover from failures.
- Feature Isolation: New features must be independently enable/disable-able and must not affect unrelated features.
- Full-Data Operations: All filtering, exporting, and analytics must operate on the full filtered dataset, not just the current GUI page.
- Extensibility: The codebase must be structured so that new features or modules can be added without modifying or risking existing, unrelated features.
- Process Documentation: Document the process for adding new features or modules, so future enhancements are easy, safe, and consistent.

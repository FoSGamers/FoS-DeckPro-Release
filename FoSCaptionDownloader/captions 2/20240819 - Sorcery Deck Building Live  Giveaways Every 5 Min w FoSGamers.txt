[00:59:40] you that was that was my card that I got
[00:59:43] there oh and I have some Alpha ones I
[00:59:44] forgot I had these ones I have a
[00:59:47] browse look at my Alpha card boy JC
[00:59:51] Q oh that's the one you're normally
[00:59:54] on M Saturday
[00:59:59] night yes it is it's like a $900 card
[01:00:01] I'm debating on sending this in to get
[01:00:03] graded actually because I don't think
[01:00:04] I'm gonna trade I'm never gonna get that
[01:00:06] this is nice my nice
[01:00:09] Alpha like that's my thought process
[01:00:12] yeah I'm thinking of get any graded then
[01:00:14] I got another nice one from alpha too
[01:00:16] which is a
[01:00:17] ruins and a uh Imperial
[01:00:21] road so those are a couple nice
[01:00:23] ones yeah I was debating on getting this
[01:00:26] graded so yes I think I will but I have
[01:00:29] that card also so I have that also for a
[01:00:32] nice one for brows so I'll probably use
[01:00:34] that and everything my deck is a nice
[01:00:36] one to have an elite you can have one of
[01:00:38] so these are my other Alpha cards that I
[01:00:49] had nice Alpha it's a little bit
[01:00:51] different than the others but you don't

[01:00:58] Ground oh William do you have to go now
[01:01:01] or not is that why the dog was

[01:01:11] an alpha I like
[01:01:13] that all right you don't need to go

[01:38:59] right it should have done it right if I
[01:39:02] remember let's do this let's see
[01:39:24] H all right let's try that
[01:39:36] again 75 come
[01:39:42] on there we
[01:39:48] go ah it did work look at that now we're
[01:39:52] going on to 17 five to see if we can get
[01:39:54] a pack of cards to give away we hit 75
[01:39:58] so that means we're giving away a single
[01:39:59] now if you do the checkin and we get to
[01:40:01] 175 we get away a pack of cards so there
[01:40:04] we go that's what we're doing there I
[01:40:05] just want to make sure everybody saw it
[01:40:06] and could see it there perfect I got it
[01:40:08] working
[01:40:09] correct all right so that's what we were
[01:40:11] doing there hey I figured it out yo I
[01:40:14] figured it out
[01:40:17] yo my wife's at work thank you
[01:40:23] have a good
[01:40:26] day love you as she said to me too oh
[01:40:29] yes got to be a nice husband there but
[01:40:32] yeah so that's what we got there who got
[01:40:35] um oh [ __ ] I did not start the other
[01:40:37] giveaway let me get the other one
[01:40:38] started there there we go
[01:40:42] so that's what we got for our foils
[01:40:44] which are nice foils there we have to
[01:40:46] play
[01:40:48] with so that being
[01:40:51] said all of our nice cards that we have
[01:40:54] I don't know what should we do for our
[01:40:56] what do we think we should do for our
[01:40:57] deck we were talking about doing it as a
[01:40:59] uh good morning good morning
[01:41:03] jbo I it's
[01:41:06] sorcery yes uh yeah we're talking about
[01:41:14] doing I think it was
[01:41:17] uh geomancer or battl Mage now I think
[01:41:21] we were thinking battl Mage because you
[01:41:22] get to every time you tap you get to
[01:41:24] play or draw a sight and then whenever
[01:41:25] battle mage attacks or kills an enemy
[01:41:26] you get to dra you get to you may draw a
[01:41:29] spell so it allows you to do more so we
[01:41:31] have battle mage oh you Marlins you want
[01:41:33] to see what I got all right this is what
[01:41:35] we have for all of our our our
[01:41:38] potentials here so we have geomancer
[01:41:40] battle mage we have enchantress I have a
[01:41:43] couple I have a
[01:41:45] sorcerer I also have spark Mage and an
[01:41:48] Elementalist which is nice an
[01:41:50] Elementalist and that was my others for
[01:41:52] there and then I have some some of my
[01:41:53] these are my um Alpha cards by the way
[01:41:56] nice Alpha
[01:41:59] cards you have so much sorcery you
[01:42:01] should probably learn how to play hey
[01:42:03] well if you want to join our our site we
[01:42:05] are we do our stuff on a regular basis
[01:42:07] here uh let me give me give me a second
[01:42:10] here should be
[01:42:11] in the the uh should be in the show
[01:42:14] notes
[01:42:15] now I believe the show notes does have
[01:42:18] it with yeah the link in there link tree
[01:42:19] if you go there you can jump in and join
[01:42:21] us one of these days so so here if you
[01:42:23] play or play or draw a site if you
[01:42:26] played an earth site fill a void
[01:42:28] adjacent to it tap replace an adjacent
[01:42:29] Rubble with their topmost site of your
[01:42:31] Atlas I mean that's a nice one there for
[01:42:34] geomancer I know battle mage signs nice
[01:42:37] though because we get to attack you draw
[01:42:38] a spell I don't know I like the drawing
[01:42:40] of spell I like the drawing of spell I
[01:42:43] think make it more like doing stuff
[01:42:45] right away you
[01:42:47] know you know what I'm going to do we'll
[01:42:49] run this here put that together for all
[01:42:51] of you if you want to try it so I think
[01:42:53] I might do that all right
[01:42:58] now let's do something like
[01:43:09] this you're very
[01:43:13] welcome yeah it's it's more like a magic
[01:43:16] mixed with um chess Marlins so it's like

[02:31:33] lightning and I had another lightning
[02:31:38] one had another lightning one in here
[02:31:43] somewhere I swear I
[02:31:47] did thunderstorm yeah there you go
[02:31:50] thunderstorm that was it
[02:31:54] thunderstorm I got
[02:31:57] those at those those are all the
[02:31:59] duplicates there all right we're still
[02:32:02] kind of going through and seeing we have
[02:32:04] Marines we have some water land
[02:32:07] water
[02:32:10] here water okay oh that's an uh Alpha by
[02:32:16] the way tivan X berser summon sphere
[02:32:20] you can summon minions at to affected
[02:32:22] sits which is nice ter when tux TX
[02:32:26] Berserker can attack a unit he must
[02:32:29] untap whenever he attacks and kills an
[02:32:31] enemy
[02:32:33] minion then we have Devil's egg at the
[02:32:36] end of your turn the controller of
[02:32:37] Devil's egg lose sight loses one life
[02:32:39] and then Mask Of Mayhem whenever a
[02:32:42] nearby minion can attack it must nearby
[02:32:44] strikes deal nearby strikes deal double
[02:32:47] damage I think those ones are cool ones
[02:32:49] ah have for some of my um I don't think
[02:32:52] buried treasure is going to be good
[02:32:53] though Cass conjur this if Cass con
[02:32:56] under an Allied landsite for an
[02:32:58] opponent's choice of an opponent's
[02:32:59] Choice when Bar Treasure is carried to
[02:33:01] the surface as controler sacrifices it
[02:33:02] and draws two cards I don't think that's
[02:33:04] going to work for me
[02:33:10] though 14 minions and 14
[02:33:14] magic all right 14 minions and 20 magic
[02:33:18] all right
[02:33:23] those are my duplicates that we have
[02:33:25] some of the things
[02:33:27] there okay that's what we got right now
[02:33:32] now I can't forget my foils so I have
[02:33:35] these I have that I have sling
[02:33:39] [Music]
[02:33:42] Pixies oh I forgot to run the giveaway
[02:33:44] there I'm sorry I thought I had that
[02:33:47] running there we go let's get that
[02:33:51] going let's
[02:33:55] see this one's not going to do anything
[02:33:58] for
[02:33:59] me not going to use
[02:34:02] that Nimbus Jin though discard that's a
[02:34:06] good one overpower now overpower I'm not
[02:34:09] going to have any of those lands there
[02:34:11] necessarily so would it be worth having
[02:34:15] that I should send the alphas all right
[02:34:17] yeah I'm definitely going to send that
[02:34:18] Alpha card definitely send that Alpha
[02:34:20] card to get graded then we have seeds of
[02:34:27] unar yeah but I don't know if H bone it
[02:34:29] the overpower I mean I don't have I
[02:34:31] don't think I'm GNA have any of those
[02:34:32] lands in there so that's my only concern
[02:34:33] on that so I'm G going to put that off
[02:34:34] the side though spectral stalker those a
[02:34:36] nice one though and then we also have
[02:34:39] wings of invention so those are a couple
[02:34:43] nice ones
[02:34:44] there Drums of Doom damage dealt to
[02:34:47] minions nearby is lethal that's a good
[02:34:49] one
[02:34:51] one that's our we don't need that for
[02:34:53] our land there overpower is awesome yeah
[02:34:56] see overpower is give an Aly plus two
[02:34:59] this turn like this is nice but I feel
[02:35:03] like I'm not going to have any of these
[02:35:04] cards there so I'm gonna have to decide
[02:35:06] if I'm gonna put any of those in for
[02:35:07] lands so secret tunnel see like if I'm
[02:35:10] doing um battle battle mage I feel like
[02:35:12] uh he's going to be know all fire and
[02:35:15] flying right be good ones there fire
[02:35:17] flying lightning bolts and things like
[02:35:18] that you know
[02:35:26] but
[02:35:30] Iceberg I could be
[02:35:33] wrong you
[02:35:35] know ruins not a bad one there ruins
[02:35:39] I'll use that we can use ruins
[02:35:51] oh use the tow in battle mage
[02:35:56] okay oh look at that one paradise if I
[02:35:59] put this one in I can uh and a purge
[02:36:02] Juggernaut also an elite automation
[02:36:05] Slaughter oh I can use that start your
[02:36:07] turn per Juggernaut Taps and moves to an
[02:36:08] adjacent location kill all minions there
[02:36:10] oh wow that's a nice
[02:36:13] one paradise I think is a good one to
[02:36:16] have though because we get all of them
[02:36:18] that is a good one in there that that's
[02:36:19] a good one in there Midland
[02:36:23] Army unique oh that one's neonic
[02:36:26] manuscript bear has tap Reveal Your
[02:36:28] topmost Spell and draw a card bear takes
[02:36:30] damage equal to cards cost not bad there
[02:36:33] we have two of these by the way I don't
[02:36:36] know if I can do two
[02:36:38] Elites two Elites we can do two Elites
[02:36:41] we can only do one unique then we have
[02:36:43] Vesuvius sacrifice vvus each unit
[02:36:46] occupying nearby sights takes three
[02:36:47] damage then we have our unique of our
[02:36:51] Cerberus must be summoned to your
[02:36:53] location curus and chains automatically
[02:36:55] follows you and can't move itself
[02:36:57] away so those ones there so I think
[02:37:01] those are the ones that I'll be using
[02:37:02] overpower if I overpower I can throw in
[02:37:05] there since I'm going to have the uh so
[02:37:07] I'm GNA have Paradise in here you know
[02:37:09] maybe I'll end up pulling it out at some
[02:37:11] point but we have our ancient dragon a
[02:37:13] couple of those all right so this is
[02:37:15] what we have for all of our cards now
[02:37:17] should I be just doing only Elites in I
[02:37:19] think there's a lot of them here I don't
[02:37:22] know if I'm going to be able to do all
[02:37:23] those because I have a lot of cards here
[02:37:25] I'm going to take out
[02:37:27] some because I have way more than the 60
[02:37:30] that are needed in just L these so let's
[02:37:34] do
[02:37:40] this let's do going to have to cut a few
[02:37:44] here bear has plus one power at the end
[02:37:47] of this turn owner return it to its
[02:37:48] owner's hand

[02:45:43] from that way in case somebody else
[02:45:45] doesn't want to they can all right we'll
[02:45:48] put all that way I think what I'm going
[02:45:50] to do here is I'm actually going to
[02:45:51] probably be jumping off in a little
[02:45:53] while just because I do have um things
[02:45:54] we need to
[02:45:56] do but I want to uh I want to try to
[02:45:59] finish some of this deck here finish
[02:46:00] some of this thing here so we have those
[02:46:03] we have these we put off to the side
[02:46:05] this is what we had we've been looking
[02:46:06] at
[02:46:09] these those ones uh
[02:46:14] backstab so we don't need as many
[02:46:16] minions you're thinking you're thinking
[02:46:17] more magics
[02:46:20] all right Mortal Mortal Mortal
[02:46:23] Mortals billowing blast of exceptional
[02:46:25] magic that's a good one some
[02:46:29] magic
[02:46:31] magic
[02:46:34] Spirits some Elites Mortals that's a
[02:46:38] good one to have there though
[02:46:43] Grandmaster Spirit of evil some magic
[02:46:46] there
[02:46:47] again mendous magic some major explosion
[02:46:50] some
[02:46:51] magic Aura I don't know if auras are
[02:46:54] those considered like
[02:46:56] Magics exceptional dragons an elite
[02:47:02] mortal some of the magic then there then
[02:47:05] we have our uh yeah I mean I got to get
[02:47:07] rid of some there so we're trying to get
[02:47:09] what we're going to think we're going to
[02:47:10] be using putting those ones in here as
[02:47:12] ones we'll use I like the dragon we're
[02:47:15] using the dragon definitely battering
[02:47:18] ram
[02:47:20] not necessarily needing battering ram
[02:47:22] maybe but beasts Monastery
[02:47:26] Beast exceptional weapon bear has range
[02:47:29] and can Target stealth units maybe that
[02:47:31] sounds like a good one probably to have
[02:47:33] to add your characters bear has one
[02:47:35] power and strike Splash full damage to
[02:47:38] each other enemy at a struck unit's
[02:47:40] location that's some nice flaming
[02:47:45] ones sword is great yeah I'm gonna throw
[02:47:47] those into it I think
[02:47:49] Devil's egg at the end of each turn the
[02:47:51] controller of Devil's egg site loses
[02:47:57] life I don't know why you would even use
[02:48:00] that that on somebody else's site
[02:48:02] probably right elad armor Mask Of Mayhem
[02:48:07] whenever a nearby enemy can attack it
[02:48:09] must nearby strikes deal you all right
[02:48:11] nearby strikes deal double damage
[02:48:15] okay use mask an enemy except magic Ally
[02:48:20] may take a step and then it strikes an
[02:48:22] enemy at its location all right that's a
[02:48:23] good one couple magic ones
[02:48:26] there air gas which is some creatures
[02:48:30] some
[02:48:31] creatures some magic there push
[02:48:33] everything a top sights one step in a
[02:48:37] cardinal direction interesting okay not
[02:48:40] bad move stuff move stuff
[02:48:43] around not a bad one there magic
[02:48:46] teleport and any number of Allied
[02:48:48] minions to the Caster's location that's
[02:48:51] a good one there
[02:48:54] teleporting I think we already looked at
[02:48:56] these we already looked at these ones
[02:48:58] and said that these ones were ones that
[02:49:00] we might want to
[02:49:02] keep so that's what we're at right
[02:49:05] there not sure on these we're unsure on
[02:49:09] those ones we're going to put those off
[02:49:10] to the side a little
[02:49:14] bit you have magics
[02:49:22] monsters
[02:49:24] beasts beasts Towers above and Magics
[02:49:29] all right so let's see what we got for
[02:49:30] like Magics and
[02:49:33] stuff teleport
[02:49:36] um I don't know is that a that a just a
[02:49:39] what kind of what card is that one is
[02:49:42] that a rare or a common one because if
[02:49:44] it's common yes if it's a rare one or
[02:49:47] something like that I probably don't
[02:49:48] you've seen all the ones that I
[02:49:54] have common yeah I probably have that
[02:49:57] there's a good chance I have that
[02:49:59] because I have a bunch of Commons here
[02:50:01] that's still so I haven't even gone
[02:50:03] through my Commons to organize those see
[02:50:06] I have all my a bunch of comments
[02:50:09] here see lots and lots of
[02:50:14] comments let me see I do believe I do
[02:50:17] have teleport in here
[02:50:24] I do believe I have teleport in there
[02:50:25] somewhere though let me uh let me check
[02:50:36] them if not that means I probably put it
[02:50:38] in the uh the pole box but I'm pretty
[02:50:41] sure I have it in here
[02:50:49] oh look at that
[02:50:57] overpower we are looking for teleport I
[02:51:00] swear I had

[02:53:45] one unique pneumonic manuscript bear tap
[02:53:49] reveal your top most spell and draw it
[02:53:50] bear takes damage equal to that card's
[02:53:52] cost H I don't know about that one we
[02:53:56] have Midland Army though you're very
[02:53:59] welcome click on the draw that
[02:54:03] time unique Army of yours command I
[02:54:05] don't know about that Cerberus though
[02:54:08] will use vvus will use I think Cerberus
[02:54:11] will go right there Paradise I plan on
[02:54:13] using for one of lands also plan on
[02:54:16] using ruins
[02:54:18] elad instrument of mass per dealt damage
[02:54:22] dealt to minions nearby is lethal o I
[02:54:24] like that one void walk for this one and
[02:54:28] then we also have our wings for that so
[02:54:30] that's two ones that we want to use all
[02:54:35] right rip a pack for the one time
[02:54:41] fire oh seeing if I get any luck you
[02:54:43] saying open a pack to see if we get luck
[02:54:48] yeah spectral stalker is a good one
[02:54:50] we'll put that in Airborne Nimbus Jin
[02:54:53] discard a spell draw deal three damage
[02:54:55] to another random unit here it's not a
[02:54:58] bad one there nice one to have we have
[02:55:00] Illusionist also that one I won't use
[02:55:03] we'll use
[02:55:05] Nimbus Hound of uras my Alpha plat card
[02:55:10] uh Airborne borrowing submerge void walk
[02:55:14] nearby enemies permanently lose stealth
[02:55:17] I like that too
[02:55:19] I actually get to use our Dragon also
[02:55:21] here so I'm going to put that in because
[02:55:23] we can do both of those I'm going to
[02:55:25] definitely do our brows but I don't I'm
[02:55:27] not gonna be playing with that I'm gonna
[02:55:28] be making a uh I'll make a a thing of it
[02:55:31] Airborne range takes no damage from
[02:55:32] units with four or more power oh it's
[02:55:36] intriguing on sling Pixies then we have
[02:55:38] our overpower there and a star seeds of
[02:55:42] UR unique Magic Mourns a long lost pass
[02:55:44] fill up the 13 voids with rubble yeah
[02:55:46] that's a nice one too
[02:55:49] so I don't know should I use
[02:55:51] pneumonic I don't know if I should use
[02:55:53] that one I'm GNA put that off this side
[02:55:55] all right
[02:55:56] so this is what we got
[02:56:00] here J filthy I always see 50 for some
[02:56:04] reason Jay
[02:56:08] filthy how was your card there put that
[02:56:10] off to the
[02:56:11] side I don't think so
[02:56:15] yeah yeah we need a core we need a four
[02:56:18] all right let's
[02:56:20] see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
[02:56:27] 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28
[02:56:33] 29 30
[02:56:35] 31 32 33 34
[02:56:40] 35
[02:56:41] 36 37 38 39 40
[02:56:48] 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53
[02:56:54] 54 55 56 so I need to get rid of about
[02:56:59] what
[02:57:01] 56 I need uh probably about 10 sites so
[02:57:05] that means I need to get rid of six at
[02:57:08] least but I have some sites mixed in
[02:57:09] here one
[02:57:12] two have the Juggernaut
[02:57:15] too three
[02:57:18] I don't know if I counted those so I
[02:57:20] have those three so that would be nine
[02:57:22] that last one would be the 60 so that's
[02:57:25] a complete 60 right
[02:57:27] there we have how many sites one two
[02:57:29] three sites are in here so I want what
[02:57:32] 10ish
[02:57:35] sites one two three sites we have three
[02:57:39] sites that are in there let's
[02:57:45] see any other sites that I have in here
[02:57:47] that I put in
[02:57:50] I don't think so so it's only those
[02:57:53] three sites that I've have added in
[02:57:54] there so far all right let's
[02:57:58] see let's see what we can take out then
[02:58:01] we need to take
[02:58:02] out means we need to take out another uh
[02:58:06] seven seven things here add the towers I
[02:58:10] have Towers to add I do have Towers add
[02:58:12] for lands so all right so here this is
[02:58:15] what I'll end up probably adding for
[02:58:16] lands I have
[02:58:29] exceptional side of
[02:58:34] air
[02:58:38] Lighthouse edge of the
[02:58:40] world must always be adjacent to a
[02:58:44] void Quagmire
[02:58:48] Mountain
[02:58:53] Pass
[02:58:55] Bedrock Oasis throw that Oasis in again
[02:58:59] I thought I had another Oasis
[02:59:01] there standing stones that should be a
[02:59:04] good
[02:59:08] one probably around 10:30 as I was
[02:59:12] guessing ruins a sight of higher in air
[02:59:16] ruins is a good one I think to have
[02:59:18] those two
[02:59:21] ruins Imperial
[02:59:24] road I don't know about Imperial Road
[02:59:28] ruins one sound
[02:59:30] good so let's go
[02:59:32] with
[02:59:34] our
[02:59:39] windmill all right windmill how many are
[02:59:41] those
[02:59:45] there we have one two
[02:59:49] three four five six seven eight we have
[02:59:55] eight all right so two more three
[02:59:58] windmills if you got them I only have
[03:00:01] one windmill there but let me see what
[03:00:04] else I have in my other
[03:00:06] land our other sites that we have our
[03:00:10] other sites that we have
[03:00:22] this all I have for sites I swear I had
[03:00:23] other
[03:00:28] sites maybe I didn't separate the sights
[03:00:31] from The Commons there oh oh all right
[03:00:35] let me find some SES
[03:00:44] here so I know I have them in here dark
[03:00:50] power look at that spectral stalker
[03:00:52] right
[03:00:57] there let's find some more sights that's
[03:01:00] a site we can drop that there since
[03:01:02] it'll be used at some point as a
[03:01:08] site all right let's put those
[03:01:11] there yeah they're probably in the pole
[03:01:15] box add him the spectral
[03:01:24] stalker
[03:01:26] Rubble let's see yeah we're just going
[03:01:29] through and having some fun some
[03:01:32] Village
[03:01:39] village Village there we go that back
[03:01:44] there wild boards no
[03:01:51] we're going to find I think I had some
[03:01:52] more of the sights in here
[03:01:56] but I don't know where they all
[03:01:58] were I thought I had some of them in
[03:02:02] that and here thought I had some Towers
[03:02:05] in here
[03:02:06] but maybe not well I have Towers in the
[03:02:09] in the um I do have Towers in the
[03:02:12] pre-made so I'm not too worried about
[03:02:14] those I can grab a couple Towers out of
[03:02:16] the pre-made if I need oh no I know
[03:02:18] knocked everything
[03:02:24] over I can get a couple Towers out of
[03:02:26] the pre-built if I
[03:02:27] need I I don't think we're going to be
[03:02:30] using
[03:02:31] these I don't think I'm going to be
[03:02:32] using those so I'm going to put those
[03:02:34] off to the
[03:02:36] side there we
[03:02:39] go I don't think I'm G to be using these
[03:02:43] because they are not beneficial to me
[03:02:44] for SES
[03:02:50] these are just uh some beasts that we
[03:02:52] don't necessar need to use oh I forgot I
[03:02:54] have
[03:02:57] Jihad I'm gonna put that one in there
[03:02:59] that's another one I in there I need in
[03:03:01] there that's one we need in
[03:03:09] there not a problem not a problem at all
[03:03:12] oh forgot about the giveaway who'd it go
[03:03:13] to I didn't run it I didn't run it
[03:03:18] let's get that
[03:03:30] going there we go all right so are those
[03:03:34] sights that I have
[03:03:39] there I don't think those ones are going
[03:03:41] to help me so what do we have we have
[03:03:46] that one two three
[03:03:49] [Music]
[03:03:51] four five 6 7
[03:03:55] 8 nine need one more one more should we
[03:04:00] do a tower or Holy
[03:04:10] Ground like I don't know healing Holy
[03:04:12] Ground I don't have Ah that's just not
[03:04:15] one that's that's not beneficial to me
[03:04:16] for what I have shifting
[03:04:19] Sands reactivate Genesis abilities of
[03:04:21] your nearby
[03:04:27] deserts aquad do don't need that
[03:04:33] one three windmills three ruins and
[03:04:37] Towers in your opinion all
[03:04:39] right mud
[03:04:43] flow updraft Ridge
[03:04:48] that might be a nice one up draft
[03:04:57] Ridge then we have
[03:04:59] desert NOP Lighthouse we're not oh
[03:05:02] lighthous did you say no windmill was
[03:05:04] windmill edge of the world
[03:05:07] Quagmire Mountain Pass maybe and
[03:05:12] Bedrock negative all right so we going
[03:05:15] to put those together
[03:05:18] over
[03:05:19] here all right so our battle mage
[03:05:21] currently is what we're kind of looking
[03:05:24] towards over here
[03:05:27] Rubble Nar desert I don't know why those
[03:05:30] are like that all right
[03:05:32] interesting all right so there we go we
[03:05:34] got those so let me see I'll have to
[03:05:36] find the other cards there now should I
[03:05:39] use Midland no I can't use that one

[03:06:00] going to be using
[03:06:02] those okay those are going to be here
[03:06:05] they're more separated now because I
[03:06:07] organized them a little bit kind of all
[03:06:10] right now let's see we need to get rid
[03:06:13] of that means no matter what we need to
[03:06:16] get rid of 11 cards because the uh your
[03:06:20] avatar is considered something there so

To not get charged your capital gains tax after selling a house, do you have to spend all of the money on a new house, or do you have to spend part of the money? Because I only want to spend part of the money on something new.

In the United States, the rules around capital gains tax on the sale of a primary residence allow for some exclusions that can help you avoid or minimize taxes without needing to spend all the proceeds on a new house. Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Primary Residence Exclusion**: If you have lived in the home for at least 2 out of the last 5 years before the sale, you may qualify for the primary residence exclusion. This exclusion allows you to exclude up to $250,000 of capital gains if you are single, or $500,000 if you are married and filing jointly, from the sale of your home.

2. **Use of Proceeds**: There is no requirement that you need to spend the proceeds on a new house to qualify for this exclusion. You can use the money however you like. The exclusion is based solely on your use of the home as your primary residence and meeting the time requirements.

3. **Reporting the Sale**: If your gain exceeds the exclusion amount, you will need to report the sale on your tax return and pay capital gains tax on the amount over the exclusion.

4. **Partial Use of Proceeds**: You can spend part of the money on a new house and use the rest however you wish. The important factor for capital gains tax purposes is the amount of gain from the sale and whether you qualify for the primary residence exclusion.

### Summary:
- **Primary Residence Exclusion**: Up to $250,000 (single) or $500,000 (married filing jointly) can be excluded from capital gains if you meet the residency requirement.
- **No Requirement to Reinvest**: You don't need to spend all or any specific portion of the proceeds on a new house to benefit from the exclusion.
- **Use of Proceeds**: You can use the proceeds from the sale as you see fit without affecting your capital gains tax exclusion eligibility.

If you have a P.O. Box in a town, but then you leave the town, do they verify yearly or regularly that you live in town still?

The policies and practices for verifying a P.O. Box holder's residency can vary depending on the specific post office and its regulations. Generally, hereâ€™s what typically happens:

1. **Initial Verification**: When you first rent a P.O. Box, you need to provide two forms of identification, one of which must be a valid photo ID. Some post offices may require proof of residence in the area, such as a utility bill.

2. **Renewal Process**: P.O. Boxes are usually rented on a quarterly or annual basis. At renewal time, the post office does not typically re-verify your residency. The renewal process usually involves paying the rental fee, either online, by mail, or in person.

3. **Address Updates**: If you move, it's your responsibility to update your address with the post office. This doesn't necessarily impact your ability to keep the P.O. Box, but it's important for ensuring you receive notifications and mail forwarding services correctly.

4. **Verification Policies**: While regular verification of residency is not common, the post office may request updated information if they have reason to believe the information on file is outdated or inaccurate. This is not typically done on a routine basis.

5. **Compliance and Policies**: Always check with your local post office, as policies can vary. Some locations might have stricter enforcement or additional requirements based on local needs or regulations.

### Summary:
- **Initial Verification**: Required when you first rent the P.O. Box.
- **Renewal**: Typically involves payment and does not include residency verification.
- **Address Updates**: Important to keep your information current for receiving notifications.
- **Local Variations**: Check with your specific post office for any unique requirements or practices.

For accurate and specific information, it's best to contact your local post office directly.

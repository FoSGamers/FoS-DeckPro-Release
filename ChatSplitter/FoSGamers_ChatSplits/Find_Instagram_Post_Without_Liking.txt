Finding a post on Instagram that you watched but didn't like or save can be challenging, but there are a few strategies you can try:

### 1. **Search by Keywords or Hashtags**
   - Use the search bar to type in keywords, phrases, or hashtags that you remember from the post. This can help narrow down the search to relevant posts.

### 2. **Check Your Activity**
   - Instagram has a feature where you can see your activity, including posts you’ve interacted with. Go to your profile, tap the three horizontal lines in the top right, select "Your activity," and then "Interactions." However, this typically shows likes, comments, and follows, not just viewed posts.

### 3. **Browse Through Accounts You Follow**
   - If you remember the account that posted it, you can go to their profile and browse their recent posts. 

### 4. **Explore Similar Content**
   - Instagram's Explore page often shows content similar to what you’ve viewed. Spend some time scrolling through the Explore page to see if the post reappears.

### 5. **Check Stories**
   - If it was a story, check if the account has it saved in their highlights. Many users save their popular or important stories to highlights on their profile.

### 6. **Recall and Refine**
   - Try to recall specific details from the post (e.g., usernames, locations, captions) and use those details to refine your search.

### 7. **Use Third-Party Tools**
   - There are some third-party tools and websites that claim to track Instagram activity or help find specific posts, but use them with caution due to privacy concerns and potential violations of Instagram's terms of service.

By combining these strategies, you increase your chances of finding the post you're looking for. However, it's important to note that if you didn't interact with the post in any way, it might be difficult to locate it again.

[00:02:13] morning so I did see you jump in but I
[00:02:14] didn't happen to see you jump in at the
[00:02:15] same time I was uh kind of talking to
[00:02:17] the family saying goodbye and stuff like
[00:02:19] that so just had that had that screen up
[00:02:21] but not the camera running you
[00:02:24] know but we are uh yeah we're we're
[00:02:28] doing our Ravnica thing right now if
[00:02:30] anybody wants to try their luck on
[00:02:35] it hey Mark
[00:02:38] Market Mark
[00:02:40] Tony Mark I Tony is what I'm
[00:02:46] saying oh damn that's a long time buddy
[00:02:50] I know you said you work um some job
[00:02:52] interesting jobs but I didn't know you
[00:02:53] were up uh over uh that long sometimes
[00:02:57] is uh work or is this a um
[00:03:00] I thought that was work rated you had
[00:03:01] said
[00:03:15] before yeah that's what I thought yeah
[00:03:17] yeah I thought you said you did stuff
[00:03:18] like that out there okay I don't know 50
[00:03:21] so you go from one job to the next is
[00:03:23] that that's what I'm guessing is a way
[00:03:25] that you're up for 58 hours
[00:03:28] straight
[00:03:30] because that kind of would make sense to
[00:03:31] me a little bit you know what I have
[00:03:33] some of this in here I'm going to do
[00:03:36] these
[00:03:38] today let's put some of these

[00:10:39] so if you have a dragon deck definitely
[00:10:42] going to be uh having some good times
[00:10:43] with that all right so that was a that
[00:10:45] one's a five so you're definitely tied
[00:10:47] at least
[00:10:50] five where is a five I think
[00:10:54] it's wait I'm on that one wrong I'm
[00:10:57] already looked at that one I'm on this
[00:10:59] one dink dink dink five I think that's a
[00:11:03] five there I don't know if there's
[00:11:05] anything higher than a five
[00:11:07] though there we go all right I don't
[00:11:10] think there was any higher than a five
[00:11:11] so you're are that one's tied right now
[00:11:13] so there we go that's a nice hit though
[00:11:16] bone Draco sore there you go all right

[00:33:45] nice dude I like vintage how vintage all
[00:33:50] right so Ice Age was one of them uh
[00:33:53] Spanx that I was looking at because it
[00:33:55] looked like the box was a little destroy
[00:33:56] a a little broken so as long as I was
[00:33:58] going to make sure like the content's
[00:34:00] okay the box was a little bit of crush
[00:34:02] so that's why I think it was a little
[00:34:03] bit cheaper than it normally is and
[00:34:05] since I'm going to be opening it I
[00:34:06] wasn't worried about the box and that
[00:34:08] was one of the last things that I
[00:34:09] remember opening was uh one of the last
[00:34:12] things I remember getting as a child was
[00:34:13] Ice Age I do have other ones that I got
[00:34:15] but that was one of the last ones I

[00:34:50] there was a couple other ones like
[00:34:51] scorge and um some old some ones that

[00:39:53] got one two three four five five six
[00:39:57] seven anybody want to
[00:40:01] go been playing since the start I feel
[00:40:04] [Music]
[00:40:05] old see I played I actually started
[00:40:08] playing in
[00:40:10] 95 I stopped in
[00:40:15] 99 or 2000 was like right around getting
[00:40:18] into high school I pretty much I played
[00:40:20] during middle school and the end of my
[00:40:22] fifth grade uh is what it was for me so
[00:40:25] that's where I remember playing that and
[00:40:27] I have the card still and the reason why
[00:40:29] I got back into this was my kids like
[00:40:31] hey I saw oh look at these magic cards
[00:40:34] so I don't know if anybody's interested
[00:40:36] in the drafts C I got some of
[00:40:40] those so I'll throw some of those in
[00:40:42] there so I don't know if anyone's
[00:40:43] interested in them
[00:40:48] but uh well my kids uh found the cards
[00:40:51] and they're like hey Dad can we um can
[00:40:54] we open these and play I'm like yeah
[00:40:55] sure we started play playing with him a
[00:40:56] little bit and then
[00:40:59] um they were like oh let's look at new
[00:41:01] ones and I saw some of the new ones and
[00:41:02] I think it was like lur of the Rings
[00:41:04] what's coming out that was a big one
[00:41:05] coming out in a few months and we were
[00:41:06] playing some March and machine might
[00:41:07] have been out so we were doing some
[00:41:09] March and
[00:41:10] machine and um had a little bit of fun
[00:41:12] with that and then when Lord of the Ring
[00:41:14] came out we had a lot of fun with that
[00:41:15] because it was something we
[00:41:17] knew you
[00:41:19] know and that's when we uh yeah that's
[00:41:21] we had a good time with it and then
[00:41:22] that's why we jumped into this more and
[00:41:24] with all the things coming out I will
[00:41:26] admit guys I am a giant Fallout fan I've
[00:41:29] played Fallout since the first Fallout
[00:41:31] game on on a PC when I was younger so
[00:41:34] with Fallout coming out I I probably
[00:41:37] jumped in more than I should have I'm
[00:41:39] gonna probably end up kicking myself
[00:41:41] because I ended up buying 12 Bo I
[00:41:43] brought two cases but we and I'm gonna
[00:41:45] see if I can do some crazy deals going
[00:41:48] like quick things going all right

[01:02:52] screen they did come with some good

[01:02:56] because um I think it's because of all
[01:02:57] the that stuff with the set that they
[01:02:59] the drafts came a little uh felt like
[01:03:02] they came a little beefier recently

[01:03:04] pulling out they've been pretty nice
[01:03:06] little almost like they've been beefier

[01:17:33] kind of ignored it and um so that's kind
[01:17:36] of I feel like that's part of the reason
[01:17:37] why I'm in the situation I'm in now is
[01:17:39] because they flat out ignored
[01:17:43] it you know it's one of those things
[01:17:45] where you uh I don't know I try to I'm
[01:17:48] trying to be the good person because I
[01:17:50] know if I talk to somebody I'm going to
[01:17:51] lose my crap on them if that's really
[01:17:53] what it boils down

[01:26:38] anything you know that's what I was
[01:26:40] going to do here but the other thing
[01:26:41] that I was thinking of doing was I know
[01:26:43] one of our boxes we we always keep a box
[01:26:46] for our family to do a YouTube channel
[01:26:48] pretty much this this pays for our
[01:26:50] YouTube channel is really what it is all
[01:26:52] all of this that I do on whatnot pays
[01:26:54] for me and my son to do a YouTube
[01:26:55] channel which is what he wanted to do in
[01:26:57] the first place and the only reason I
[01:26:59] really started doing this so it pays to
[01:27:02] the YouTube channel and all that and
[01:27:03] that so we'll be opening a box of

[03:07:59] days when my uh my children are on
[03:08:01] because this is how I started the show
[03:08:02] actually was my oldest William uh he's
[03:08:05] like hey I can I want to open packs on
[03:08:07] YouTube I'm like all right so we opened
[03:08:09] a couple of boxes I'm like I have no
[03:08:11] money to do that and he found this to do
[03:08:13] it so I was like you know what let's try
[03:08:15] it out so pretty much this pays for our
[03:08:17] YouTube channel so if you ever get a
[03:08:19] chance to check it out we would
[03:08:20] appreciate
[03:08:22] that but we'll be opening we'll doing a

[03:08:31] laughing
[03:08:33] hysterically because it's either I'm
[03:08:36] saying
[03:08:37] penstein but he would probably read it
[03:08:39] as poen Stein and he would die laughing
[03:08:42] and that's the only reason I say that is
[03:08:44] because he's an eight-year-old boy you
[03:08:45] know you know eight-year-old boy

[03:29:42] cost that's I did it as low as I let me
[03:29:44] see I don't think I can get really any
[03:29:46] lower than that I might be able to do
[03:29:47] like a dollar or two more let me
[03:29:56] see I could
[03:30:05] do I could do 153 is like the lowest I
[03:30:08] could go for
[03:30:10] you
[03:30:11] hey no
[03:30:12] problem hey yeah know it's all right I
[03:30:15] understand uh I can do 153 if you

[03:30:21] quickly
[03:30:23] for for 20
[03:30:25] seconds there that's the lowest I can I
[03:30:27] can go on that just because of uh what
[03:30:32] my costs are with whatnot and the fees
[03:30:36] and everything and in shipping and
[03:30:37] having to pay for and having to pay for
[03:30:39] items for shipping stuff to pack
[03:30:41] everything up so but let me see I'll
[03:30:42] throw that on there quickly if you want

[03:31:13] before where you got to like decide to
[03:31:14] walk away or not and I've had it also
[03:31:16] where you people have done that and then
[03:31:18] the next pack that had been pulled out
[03:31:19] was like the monoc cryp so it's like
[03:31:21] it's one of those six half dozen the
[03:31:22] other things you know all right hey

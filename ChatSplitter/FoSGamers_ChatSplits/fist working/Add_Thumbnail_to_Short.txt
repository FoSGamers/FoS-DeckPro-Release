How do I make a short have a thumbnail?

To add a thumbnail to a YouTube Short, you generally need to use a desktop or web browser, as the option to add custom thumbnails is not directly available in the mobile apps. Here’s how you can do it:

### 1. Upload Your Short
- **Step 1:** Upload your Short as you normally would using YouTube Studio.
- **Step 2:** After uploading, navigate to the "Content" tab in YouTube Studio.

### 2. Access the Video Details
- **Step 3:** Find the Short you've just uploaded in your list of videos.
- **Step 4:** Click on the video title to open the video details page.

### 3. Add a Thumbnail
- **Step 5:** On the video details page, scroll down to the "Thumbnail" section.
- **Step 6:** Click on the "Upload thumbnail" button and choose the image file you want to use as the thumbnail for your Short.
- **Step 7:** Once you've uploaded your thumbnail, click "Save" to apply the changes.

### 4. Verify the Thumbnail
- **Step 8:** Go back to the "Content" tab and verify that the thumbnail has been applied to your Short.

### Notes:
- **Custom Thumbnail Requirements:** Ensure that your thumbnail image meets YouTube's guidelines:
  - Resolution: 1280x720 pixels (with a minimum width of 640 pixels)
  - Format: JPG, PNG, BMP, or GIF
  - Size: Under 2MB
  - Aspect Ratio: 16:9 works best

This process will make sure your Short has a thumbnail when viewed on YouTube, enhancing its visual appeal and potentially increasing views.

### Summary
1. Upload your Short through YouTube Studio.
2. Access the video details for the Short.
3. Upload and save your custom thumbnail.
4. Ensure it meets YouTube's requirements.

You're correct to question this, and I appreciate the opportunity to clarify the correct procedure. YouTube currently does not allow creators to directly upload a custom thumbnail for YouTube Shorts through the standard upload process. This is because YouTube automatically selects a frame from the video to be the thumbnail for Shorts.

However, there are a few workarounds you can consider:

### Method 1: Use a Desktop Browser to Add a Thumbnail (Limited Effectiveness)
1. **Upload the Short from Desktop:**
   - Upload your Short as you normally would on a desktop browser using YouTube Studio.
   - During the upload process, you might not see an option to upload a thumbnail for Shorts, but if you upload a video that is less than 60 seconds and in a vertical format, it gets categorized as a Short.
   
2. **Post-upload Thumbnail Change (Not Officially Supported):**
   - Go to YouTube Studio after the video is uploaded.
   - Locate your Short in the “Content” section and try editing it to add a thumbnail in the usual way. However, note that YouTube might not apply the custom thumbnail for Shorts because they auto-select a frame for them.

### Method 2: Upload as a Regular Video First
1. **Upload as a Regular Video:**
   - Upload your video normally, ensuring it’s over 60 seconds or not in a vertical format, so it doesn't get categorized as a Short.
   - Add your desired thumbnail during the upload process.
   
2. **Edit Video to Make it a Short:**
   - After it’s uploaded, you can edit the video to make it a Short by trimming it down to under 60 seconds and making sure it’s vertical (9:16 aspect ratio).
   - Keep in mind, YouTube might still override the thumbnail once it gets categorized as a Short.

### Method 3: YouTube App Trick (Testing Feature)
1. **Upload through YouTube App:**
   - Upload your Short through the YouTube app as usual.
   
2. **Use Beta Features (If Available):**
   - YouTube occasionally tests features with select users, so check if you have access to a feature that allows custom thumbnails for Shorts in the mobile app. This isn’t widely available and may not be an option for everyone.

### Summary
- **Direct Upload:** YouTube Shorts currently does not officially support custom thumbnails.
- **Workarounds:** Upload as a regular video first or experiment with desktop editing, though results may vary.

**Additional Context:**
This feature might change in the future as YouTube updates its platform. It's important to stay updated with any changes YouTube makes to how Shorts are handled.

  ManaBox Enhancer Project Rules: These rules ensure the codebase is modular, maintainable, and safe for ongoing enhancements and refactors. All contributors must follow these at all times.

1. Modular Design: All features must be implemented as separate, encapsulated modules or classes with clear, documented interfaces.
2. No Cross-Module Manipulation: Modules must not directly access or modify the internals of other modules. Use public methods, events, or signals/slots for communication.
3. Backward Compatibility: Never break or remove a working feature without a migration plan and tests. All refactors must maintain backward compatibility.
4. Incremental Refactoring: Refactor in small, testable steps. After each step, verify that all features still work before proceeding.
5. Unit Testing: Every module must have unit tests for its core logic. Run all tests after each change or refactor.
6. Documentation: All code, modules, and changes must be clearly documented. Every class and function should have a docstring explaining its purpose and usage.
7. Version Control Discipline: Use git branches for each feature or refactor. Commit frequently with clear messages. Never merge unfinished or untested work into main.
8. Centralized Configuration: All configuration, constants, and settings must be centralized in a config file or module.
9. Consistent UI/UX: All UI components must follow a consistent style and interaction pattern, defined in a style guide or shared resource.
10. Safe Fallbacks and Error Handling: All features must provide safe fallbacks and clear, user-friendly error messages. The app must gracefully recover from failures.
11. Feature Isolation: New features must be independently enable/disable-able and must not affect unrelated features.
12. Full-Data Operations: All filtering, exporting, and analytics must operate on the full filtered dataset, not just the current GUI page.
13. Extensibility: The codebase must be structured so that new features or modules can be added without modifying or risking existing, unrelated features.
14. Process Documentation: Document the process for adding new features or modules, so future enhancements are easy, safe, and consistent.

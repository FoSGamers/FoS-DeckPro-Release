[00:00:09] here I think I got it set up
[00:00:14] right you guys can see hey Breakin hey
[00:00:17] Dan get some bad news for those that are
[00:00:20] coming in for lurana I had to make a
[00:00:22] shipment issue with FedEx because it was
[00:00:25] supposed to be I mean not lur for um for
[00:00:28] Exelon I had to make a ship request
[00:00:30] because it was not delivered yesterday
[00:00:33] when it was supposed to be I waited
[00:00:36] around between the you know the 12 and
[00:00:38] four that they said it was then it
[00:00:40] didn't show up so I was a little
[00:00:42] frustrated then it said you know end of
[00:00:43] the day 8:00 all right you know what
[00:00:44] maybe they're
[00:00:45] late Noe no they just straight out
[00:00:48] didn't
[00:00:50] come so hopefully they comes in today
[00:00:52] but I am reaching out to FedEx to be
[00:00:55] like guys I paid um extra for a special
[00:00:57] shipping on this where where's my stuff
[00:01:01] like you can't lose something like they
[00:01:04] can lose it so I've seen FedEx lose
[00:01:07] worse more stuff than just something
[00:01:08] like this but anyways hopefully

[00:01:15] this wonderful Wednesday hump day first
[00:01:18] hump day of the year maybe you'll get
[00:01:20] your hump day going
[00:01:23] yourself later I don't know I'm uh I'm
[00:01:27] hoping on that myself I shouldn't say
[00:01:29] that out I hate I say things I shouldn't
[00:01:31] all the
[00:01:33] time make any appropriate
[00:01:36] comments this is not
[00:01:38] x-rated this could be a children's
[00:01:41] show but anyways let's get something and
[00:01:44] running for you guys well I wait
[00:01:49] here CU you know it is going uh going
[00:01:51] probably be doing a bit more pull boxes
[00:01:54] and pack stuff this morning just because
[00:01:56] like I said nothing came in but
[00:02:00] hey that's the luck I get
[00:02:03] right hey Tazer how you
[00:02:07] doing me trim my volume down here a
[00:02:10] little
[00:02:12] bit yeah I was just saying anybody that
[00:02:14] was coming in looking for Exelon I got
[00:02:16] some bad news I am quite literally in
[00:02:19] the middle of creating a case with fex
[00:02:23] because they lost my
[00:02:26] package I don't know they lost my
[00:02:28] package but my package was supposed to
[00:02:30] be delivered yesterday and it was not
[00:02:33] which means I have like a lot of money
[00:02:37] worth of stuff
[00:02:40] missing no not too bad other than that
[00:02:43] got test
[00:02:46] gold no yeah yeah yeah I was a little
[00:02:50] I'm a little upset frustrated all the
[00:02:53] above whatever you want to say but
[00:02:57] um I mean I'm hoping it's just a
[00:03:01] that somebody said it made it on the
[00:03:03] truck and they scanned it and it didn't
[00:03:05] actually get on the truck because I did
[00:03:07] notice at like 6 o' that it ended up
[00:03:09] saying it was at the warehouse instead
[00:03:11] of being on it on its way like it had
[00:03:13] said originally like that it was on its
[00:03:15] way so that's what I'm crossing my
[00:03:17] fingers and hoping is that someone
[00:03:19] straight out [ __ ] up and forgot to put
[00:03:21] my package on the truck that's my
[00:03:23] Crossing of my fingers hey R how you

[00:17:35] 4 5 six
[00:17:39] 7
[00:17:40] eight and nine the reason why we do
[00:17:43] multiple ones is because I like to do
[00:17:45] where you have multiple hits um that can
[00:17:47] like kind of add up to the big one
[00:17:49] because at least get a few good hits
[00:17:50] potentially versus having one hit out of
[00:17:53] like a few thousand that's what I like
[00:17:54] to do I don't know that's my way but
[00:17:56] here we go let's see where he go
[00:17:57] sergeant ftic offering dread moire foil
[00:18:02] jaded seed

[00:18:29] that art that a nice little hit on that
[00:18:31] one they'll get lost
[00:18:33] there thank you Sergeant marbles but
[00:18:36] what we're going to do
[00:18:39] there is um you know what yeah not too
[00:18:44] bad add it up with the other ones there
[00:18:46] you didn't get the you definitely didn't
[00:18:47] get at anywhere at the low there what I
[00:18:49] can do is um you know what we like to do
[00:18:50] these things we do pack deals also after
[00:18:52] I do I do like a pull box deal then I
[00:18:56] throw up what I call like a pack deal
[00:18:58] for everybody so what I'm going to do
[00:19:00] here is I'm going to do the same thing
[00:19:02] that's what I'm going to do if you guys
[00:19:03] want this you take it but if you don't
[00:19:06] want it you just say hey you know what I
[00:19:08] got um you know these other I see you
[00:19:10] got these other packs in your buy now
[00:19:12] can I get these three as a pack deal
[00:19:14] instead and the way I do that is it
[00:19:16] allows me to

[00:40:20] here that is my last of
[00:40:25] those
[00:40:35] all
[00:40:37] right no one wanted to try their LU on
[00:40:39] the P box which is
[00:40:42] fine I figured things were going to be
[00:40:44] on the slower side today because of the
[00:40:46] inventory restrictions but we have a
[00:40:49] March
[00:40:51] machine uh a couple of those we have dra
[00:40:55] uh set and collector booster which is
[00:40:57] actually my last collector booster of
[00:40:59] marsh machine I found that actually in a
[00:41:01] uh mystery box normally I I we weren't
[00:41:04] selling them so I took it apart Mystery
[00:41:06] Pack I mean and uh yeah so let's see
[00:41:09] what we do here we're going to put these

[00:42:26] just straight up lost
[00:42:27] it and this is after the holiday so you

[01:18:26] was going to sell I was going to sell
[01:18:27] this one a while
[01:18:33] back but um I mean my family has some
[01:18:36] good luck that's why like I like to have
[01:18:38] packs here to do Pack openings because
[01:18:40] like like we have good luck somehow when
[01:18:42] it comes to opening
[01:18:43] packs I never understood
[01:18:46] why or
[01:18:48] how but it happens and I'm good with
[01:18:51] it
[01:19:01] okay I know there's nothing been special
[01:19:04] pulled out of ours but let me uh let me
[01:19:07] see what else like I like we do a good
[01:19:09] job here when it comes to opening packs
[01:19:10] I don't understand why like we've pulled
[01:19:12] out here this is like this is an example
[01:19:15] of like the stuff that we pulled out
[01:19:17] here on the show I don't understand why
[01:19:19] I'm G to throw this up after for pack
[01:19:20] deals but we pulled out two monoc Crypts
[01:19:24] uh one was a green neon one was a
[01:19:28] rainbow neon we pulled out four Cavern
[01:19:32] of souls one regular one spoil one blue
[01:19:36] neon foil and I think there was another
[01:19:39] regular one we pulled out of a draft
[01:19:41] we've pulled out um a doctor who um uh
[01:19:47] serialized uh so like we get good luck
[01:19:50] with cards for somehow I don't
[01:19:52] understand it
[01:19:53] it's just like the kids the kids I think
[01:19:55] is what it is they tell me what to get a
[01:19:57] lot of times like hey kids what do you
[01:19:58] like out of these boxes what should I
[01:20:00] get today what should I order when I'm
[01:20:02] like running low I know it sounds weird
[01:20:04] for me to ask children what they think
[01:20:07] but they play with me so that's part of
[01:20:09] the reason why I asked them because some
[01:20:10] of the times they'll like they'll play I
[01:20:12] will'll open some packs and we'll play
[01:20:14] I'm sorry I just got completely
[01:20:15] sidetracked here let me throw this on
[01:20:17] here
[01:20:19] for we're going to throw those on for
[01:20:21] 20 so like the kids will pick packs a
[01:20:24] lot of times or tell me what to get like
[01:20:26] hey what do you think about these these
[01:20:28] ones and I'll give them some I could buy
[01:20:30] a single but it's not that's fun exactly
[01:20:33] you can buy a single it's not that fun
[01:20:34] it's the chase of going after it one of
[01:20:36] these days I'm GNA buy a boxing midnight
[01:20:37] hunt so you can just get a first find a
[01:20:38] meat hook yeah that definitely if you
[01:20:41] buy the Box there's a good chance you
[01:20:42] could get that but that's what we have
[01:20:44] on on here right now but like my kids
[01:20:46] pull out wicked good stuff and I don't
[01:20:48] understand it's like I tell them like
[01:20:50] hey this is what we want and they'll
[01:20:51] pull out a box and they just
[01:20:54] like my son I said hey should I get this
[01:20:55] box where should I get a um should I get
[01:20:57] a Lord of the Rings or something else
[01:20:59] the other like a while back he goes oh
[01:21:01] get the Lord of the Rings one my guy's
[01:21:02] fine I bought the Lord of the Rings one
[01:21:04] and he pulled out a Dwarven soul ring
[01:21:05] out of that one that came in so I mean
[01:21:07] like these are the things that he pulls
[01:21:08] out for luck like we were at the store
[01:21:10] buying at um the um when they did uh
[01:21:15] wildsville drain we went there for um
[01:21:18] pre-release for a two-headed giant and
[01:21:20] he was he was my partner there
[01:21:23] and um when we were there we were an
[01:21:25] hour there was an hour delay because
[01:21:27] there was somebody was showing up and we
[01:21:28] were all okay with waiting and the he
[01:21:31] goes we like like let's buy a few packs
[01:21:33] of cards we went up and bought like
[01:21:35] three packs of uh collector boosters of
[01:21:38] Wilds of Val drain and he pulled out a
[01:21:41] confetti um parall lives like this like
[01:21:45] the kids just have I'm telling you as
[01:21:47] soon as you have children you pass all
[01:21:49] of your luck to them or you know no
[01:21:52] longer have luck and everybody else in
[01:21:54] this planet gets the luck that you used
[01:21:55] to have I don't know that's all I can
[01:21:57] say so he's like if I open these packs
[01:21:59] for you you're going to get the luck
[01:22:01] like somebody's goingon to pull out a
[01:22:02] ring out of one of these set boosters
[01:22:04] here that type of thing and I wouldn't
[01:22:05] be able to do that if it was me trying
[01:22:07] to open them but because it's you and
[01:22:09] you're the ones with them you're G to do
[01:22:13] it you know what I'm gonna do I'm going
[01:22:15] to throw on this here I'm going to throw
[01:22:18] on the red and the green

[01:29:17] Golem so what's your uh what what are
[01:29:19] you looking for advice for I have no
[01:29:21] problem I I give advice as much as I can
[01:29:24] I don't mind it I'll give advice on
[01:29:26] Magic I'll give advice on life hell I'll
[01:29:28] give advice on children if you want
[01:29:30] because I've had them myself as you can
[01:29:35] tell hey Doo how you doing while you're
[01:29:39] on to our commander
[01:29:43] Masters pullbox serialized 12th
[01:29:46] doctor with a serialized 12th doctor in
[01:29:48] the new secret layer secret layer Doctor
[01:29:51] Who drops
[01:29:52] oh what do you think that should cost oh
[01:29:55] all right well then cost of that well
[01:29:59] what I do when I do the cost of my boxes
[01:30:01] I pretty much I scan the box I find the
[01:30:04] cost of everything and I put the low the
[01:30:07] average and the ceiling and then I put
[01:30:09] whatever I would be comfortable at with
[01:30:12] people pulling out and getting either
[01:30:14] the high card um or or what and that's
[01:30:18] what I put in there and that's kind of
[01:30:19] how I do it so I would say if you were
[01:30:21] going to do something like that maybe
[01:30:23] roll it in as um bump up the cost on the
[01:30:27] um on on your polls to you know a higher
[01:30:31] amount than what the average would be so
[01:30:32] say the average here a lot of times my
[01:30:34] average it's near the average or it's at
[01:30:36] the average or low on a pull box for me
[01:30:38] because I don't have a giant high card
[01:30:40] in there but if say I had a serialized
[01:30:42] card in there this box wouldn't end up
[01:30:44] being you know $6 this would probably be
[01:30:46] you know a $25 box or a $30 box be when
[01:30:50] there was a th000 cards in here here cuz
[01:30:52] you could pull $700 seiz card out one
[01:30:55] two 3 four
[01:30:57] five one two 3 four five but then that's
[01:31:01] a kind of a that's a close see the for
[01:31:03] me that's closer to gambling and that's
[01:31:05] why I do the boxes my way but the thing
[01:31:07] is people like doing those ones those
[01:31:08] type of ones and I've gone and done them
[01:31:10] myself and tried my luck on them when I
[01:31:12] felt lucky before so some people are
[01:31:14] like that and there's no problem doing
[01:31:15] it that way so here we go I'm sorry for
[01:31:18] talking for a second there Panama Norman
[01:31:21] mad Captain I'm sorry for taking a
[01:31:23] minute there out of your out of your

[01:32:12] foil that was a that was a nice pack
[01:32:16] Balta
[01:32:20] champions well that's yeah I mean if
[01:32:22] it's $12 um and it depends on how many
[01:32:25] are in there uh how many cards are in
[01:32:28] there then that would make sense if
[01:32:30] there's like um like less cards or
[01:32:33] there's more cards you know what I
[01:32:37] mean nice hits on that pack there that
[01:32:41] öa and VTA Champions somebody's gonna
[01:32:43] let me know how much the vaa Champions
[01:32:45] is but I know ersa and VTA Champions

[01:33:56] doing drafts sometimes with both they
[01:33:58] like no and not all all the time but
[01:34:01] what I think will uh I'd like to see if
[01:34:03] they would do is a draft with a bunch of
[01:34:07] the random draft ones that they have
[01:34:10] Fierce guardianship is 30 I knew Fierce

[01:37:56] too nice nice one there nice job little
[01:38:02] dj I was playing the uh we were at the
[01:38:05] um we went
[01:38:07] to the
[01:38:11] uh the LGs yesterday with my two boys
[01:38:14] because they had the day off and um from
[01:38:17] school so that means I had the day off
[01:38:20] from work
[01:38:22] uh wasn't expecting that one I didn't
[01:38:23] know they had the day off from school
[01:38:25] but anyways they had the day off from
[01:38:27] school and we went over to the uh store
[01:38:29] little and uh had them play cards the
[01:38:33] dinos are definitely good had them play
[01:38:35] some cards with us and
[01:38:38] uh my youngest made it to the ending
[01:38:42] playing with the uh with the one of uh
[01:38:45] the patron one of the customers here a
[01:38:48] little blunt I mean a blunt man he uh
[01:38:51] sent a an old deck of his that was a um
[01:38:54] spider deck and my son beat knocked out
[01:38:59] two people and almost knocked out the
[01:39:01] third one if it wasn't for the person
[01:39:02] coming out with like a one really good
[01:39:04] card at the end and he's eight years old
[01:39:06] I'm sitting there I'm like you got to be
[01:39:07] kidding me these people are one the guy
[01:39:09] was getting a little frustrated you
[01:39:10] could tell the older guy was getting
[01:39:12] frustrated because he was like in 40 he
[01:39:13] was in his 40s he's a little bit older
[01:39:15] than me and it's like eight-year-old is
[01:39:17] I'm like hey I'm like what do you want
[01:39:18] to do here and I just the only thing I
[01:39:20] would have to do for him was to to I I
[01:39:23] was like I do help him a little bit to
[01:39:25] remind him of his triggers because he
[01:39:27] doesn't always remember being eight that
[01:39:29] oh that triggers that to do that also so
[01:39:31] that's the only thing I'm kind of here
[01:39:33] doing is to remind him of his triggers
[01:39:35] to pull cards and stuff like
[01:39:39] that so I'm going to go with $16 for
[01:39:43] these three you know what
[01:39:45] actually let's see if I can do this
[01:39:49] actually no I can't I can't I have to
[01:39:53] do I'll do that I'll do
[01:39:58] 15 15 for those three on screen and he
[01:40:02] actually he came in pretty good he
[01:40:03] almost he almost beat he almost beat
[01:40:05] everyone and he almost beat everyone in
[01:40:07] the second game he played
[01:40:10] too 24 and you can barely remember all
[01:40:12] your triggers
[01:40:15] exactly so it's like when people are
[01:40:17] like oh like I'm I'm you know 30s 39 I
[01:40:22] don't remember all my
[01:40:36] triggers but I figured that's what I was
[01:40:38] there for help him out with those things
[01:40:40] and he ended up coming in almost we
[01:40:42] winning one of the games like literally
[01:40:44] the other guy was down if the other guy
[01:40:47] didn't have a um a way to swing at him
[01:40:51] um and take out something large with he
[01:40:53] had he end up Lucky getting a pull from
[01:40:55] his uh uh the top of the deck that he
[01:40:57] was able to pull a card from that helped
[01:40:58] him a lot to be able to win and if he
[01:41:00] didn't get that pull I don't think he
[01:41:01] would have been able to win and my son
[01:41:03] the next turn would have knocked him out
[01:41:05] as an eight-year-old
[01:41:09] kid yeah I don't remember all my
[01:41:11] triggers and shame on me especially that
[01:41:14] eight-year-old I I got to get you know
[01:41:16] I'm gonna have to go and find that
[01:41:17] switch outside you know bad boy
[01:41:22] come on so but anyways he I mean he did
[01:41:25] really well and then this the second
[01:41:26] game he played with my oldest son this
[01:41:28] 12-year-old boy and a kid that is like a
[01:41:30] freshman in high school that was you
[01:41:32] know a little he might have been
[01:41:33] autistic but either way they were all
[01:41:35] played together a forgate the four of
[01:41:37] them played together perfectly no
[01:41:39] problems at all and my son ended up my
[01:41:42] youngest again came in second place
[01:41:44] almost winning because of the deck that
[01:41:46] he had I mean they're all uh with this
[01:41:48] deck they're all a lot of it's all death
[01:41:50] touch with uh the with the spiders so
[01:41:55] that's part of the reason for it here
[01:41:57] let me throw on this if somebody wants
[01:41:59] to try their luck with some of the
[01:42:04] um ion or lost Lord of the Rings
[01:42:15] here maybe you want to get that one ring
[01:42:17] that packed of negation you did see the
[01:42:20] uh the nzou that was in there I that I
[01:42:23] pulled out a little chunk of them and
[01:42:24] you did see that the foil nasgul in
[01:42:26] there lorian revealed foil in there so
[01:42:29] you did see some of the heat that was in
[01:42:31] there I just didn't happen to pull out
[01:42:33] the chunk that had the one ring into the
[01:42:35] pack of negation but yeah they are there
[01:42:37] you can uh mean I can try to pull more
[01:42:39] out but that means I'm G have to keep
[01:42:41] truffling the Box up and taking time and
[01:42:44] time no little dj long story short I'm
[01:42:49] not a fan of FedEx and that's who the
[01:42:50] company uses and my FedEx package was
[01:42:54] out for delivery supposedly and then at
[01:42:57] sometime around 5 45 p.m. last night
[01:43:01] there was a notification update that it
[01:43:02] was at the um origination facility that
[01:43:05] and I'm so my guess is they were meant
[01:43:07] to put it on the trailer on the truck to
[01:43:10] get here and they never actually got it
[01:43:11] on the truck so I have to I sent them a
[01:43:15] message trying to figure out what's
[01:43:16] going on I'm hoping it shows up today
[01:43:17] I'm a little yeah uh you know what I've
[01:43:20] I that's the only that's the company
[01:43:22] that I have the largest I'm just I don't
[01:43:24] know people that have FedEx maybe maybe
[01:43:26] somebody works with them here I'm sorry
[01:43:28] if I'm offending you I'm not trying to
[01:43:31] but you know sometimes there out of all
[01:43:34] the companies I've worked with for
[01:43:35] shipping they're always the ones that I
[01:43:38] end up having like some type
[01:43:41] of some type of headache with and I
[01:43:45] don't know how else to say that I just
[01:43:47] end up having some type of headache with
[01:43:48] them every
[01:43:49] time not every time a lot of the times a
[01:43:53] lot of the times especially when I'm
[01:43:54] like looking or waiting on something
[01:43:56] let's do some pack deals here but I do I
[01:44:00] I like you know I have a good time with

[01:44:22] these three if you want to try your
[01:44:31] luck but yeah that's why I don't have my
[01:44:34] ion that's why I don't have my aoria

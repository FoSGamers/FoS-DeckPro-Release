   - Mark different parts of your script as transactions to measure their performance. Transactions help you identify the time taken for specific actions or parts of your application.

2. **Parameterization**:
   - Replace hard-coded values (like usernames and passwords) with parameters to simulate different users or data inputs. This makes your tests more realistic and prevents server-side caching from affecting the results.

3. **Correlation**:
   - Extract dynamic values from server responses and reuse them in subsequent requests to handle session-specific data. This ensures that your script can handle dynamic data like session IDs or tokens.

##### Step 5: Run a Load Test with the Controller

1. **Open the Controller**:
   - Launch the LoadRunner Controller to manage and run your load tests.

2. **Create a New Scenario**:
   - Go to `File

##### Step 5: Run a Load Test with the Controller (continued)

2. **Create a New Scenario** (continued):
   - Go to `File > New > Scenario`.
   - Add the script you created with VuGen to the scenario by clicking `Add Script` and selecting your script.

3. **Configure the Scenario**:
   - Configure the number of virtual users (Vusers) you want to simulate. You can start with a small number and gradually increase to understand how your application performs under different loads.
   - Set the load pattern: You can define how the load will be applied over time, such as ramp-up (gradually increasing users), steady-state (constant number of users), and ramp-down (gradually decreasing users).

4. **Set Up Monitoring**:
   - To monitor system resources (CPU, memory, disk usage) on the servers during the test, set up monitoring in the Controller.
   - Add the servers you want to monitor and configure the counters you want to track.

5. **Run the Scenario**:
   - Click `Start Scenario` to begin the load test.
   - Monitor the test in real-time using the graphs and metrics provided by the Controller.
   - Observe how your application behaves under load and identify any performance bottlenecks.

##### Step 6: Analyze Test Results

1. **Open LoadRunner Analysis**:
   - Once the test is complete, open the LoadRunner Analysis tool to analyze the performance data collected during the test.

2. **Load the Results**:
   - Load the test results file generated by the Controller.
   - The Analysis tool will provide various graphs and reports to help you understand the performance metrics.

3. **Generate Reports**:
   - Generate detailed reports to visualize the test results.
   - Analyze key metrics such as response time, throughput, error rates, and system resource utilization.
   - Identify performance issues and bottlenecks in your application.

4. **Share Findings**:
   - Compile the findings into a report that can be shared with stakeholders.
   - Highlight areas where the application performed well and areas that need improvement.

### Part 3: Combining Selenium and LoadRunner

While Selenium is primarily used for functional testing, you can integrate it with LoadRunner to perform performance testing with real user interactions. This is particularly useful for testing the performance impact of complex user actions.

#### 3.1 Using Selenium with LoadRunner

1. **Create a Selenium Script in LoadRunner**:
   - Open VuGen and create a new script using the "Web - HTTP/HTML" protocol.
   - Instead of recording a script, write a custom script that launches the Selenium WebDriver and performs actions in the browser.

2. **Example Selenium Script in LoadRunner**:
   - Here is an example of integrating Selenium with LoadRunner:

     ```java
     import lrapi.lr;
     import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
     import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;

     public class Actions {
         public int init() {
             return 0;
         }

         public int action() {
             // Set the path to the ChromeDriver executable
             System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "path/to/chromedriver");

             // Initialize a new WebDriver instance
             WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

             // Navigate to a website
             driver.get("https://www.example.com");

             // Perform actions or assertions
             lr.output_message("Page title is: " + driver.getTitle());

             // Close the browser
             driver.quit();

             return 0;
         }

         public int end() {
             return 0;
         }
     }
     ```
   - Replace `"path/to/chromedriver"` with the actual path to the ChromeDriver executable.

3. **Run the Combined Test**:
   - Add the script to a LoadRunner scenario in the Controller.
   - Configure the load pattern and virtual users as needed.
   - Start the scenario to execute the combined load test with Selenium and LoadRunner.

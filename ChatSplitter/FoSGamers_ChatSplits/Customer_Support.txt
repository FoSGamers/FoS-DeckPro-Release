Okay, so I need a response to this here, and I'm going to show you kind of what I'm going to say. I'm going to say what they said and then what I was thinking.

Hey quick question.. was it really kitesail larcenist that I bid on? I was almost positive it was a Marvel card but I could be mistaken.


I do believe so from what the virtual pull box said when i looked at your card that came from it.

Hello,

Thanks for reaching out! Based on our system, the card you received through the virtual pull box was **Kitesail Larcenist**. However, if you believe there might be an error or you were expecting a Marvel card, I'd be happy to double-check for you. 

Please let me know if you'd like me to review further or provide additional details!

[2024-12-19 21:05:15] FoSGamers:
I'm not going to actually need to double-check, but we can say that if you would like, you can always go and check the live stream to see what was said during that, too. But based on the whatnot system and what it shows for what was done, that is the correct card.

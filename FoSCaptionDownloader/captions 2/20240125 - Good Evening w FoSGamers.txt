[00:05:43] good price for those for those
[00:05:46] three it's going to come up

[00:05:59] a uh lost Caverns
[00:06:02] ion Nolan picked these ones out himself
[00:06:05] maybe you will get some uh good luck
[00:06:06] pull yourself I don't know holy
[00:06:09] something something sweet
[00:06:12] out I mean normally when the children
[00:06:14] have it sometimes they get some good
[00:06:16] luck they don't I don't always say they
[00:06:17] do but they sometimes they get the good
[00:06:18] luck I think it's like that thing you
[00:06:20] pass the luck from you on to the child
[00:06:23] that makes any sense but all right you
[00:06:26] did not want Nolan's pack deal I think
[00:06:28] he picked it out from the side in the
[00:06:30] front here maybe actually this the

[00:14:55] something on the low side today this
[00:14:57] afternoon no one
[00:14:59] but what I'm going to do before I go on
[00:15:01] the low side is I am going to throw out
[00:15:04] some of the singles here in case anybody
[00:15:06] wants to see him I think he picked this
[00:15:08] one out I think it was that one right
[00:15:09] there there's only one pack pulled out
[00:15:12] of this box by the way somebody wanted
[00:15:13] to try their luck and because they
[00:15:15] didn't trust that there wasn't a triome
[00:15:17] or something else in the other one and I
[00:15:18] think somebody end up open up a triome
[00:15:19] out of the last pack of the other one so

[00:52:57] get those babies
[00:52:59] protected I do them a double I like to
[00:53:01] double them up because with shipping
[00:53:02] they're thicker and they don't flop
[00:53:03] around as
[00:53:05] much if I can there we go nice raise of
[00:53:08] Palisades foil Abel

[00:53:36] I said putting them doubling them up
[00:53:38] like this helps with the uh helps with
[00:53:40] the shipping for the thickness so they
[00:53:42] don't bend because I noticed that um
[00:53:45] when I was trying to pack them up and I
[00:53:47] had the individual ones in there that
[00:53:49] sometimes they would like bend a little
[00:53:50] bit but if I put them in there with two
[00:53:52] of them they don't really Bend as much
[00:53:54] so I when I use the little cardboard
[00:53:56] it's h it's just extra rather than
[00:53:57] making extra stiffness here you go [ __ ]

[01:23:50] something rolling on these for a little
[01:23:51] bit here before we get the end of the
[01:23:55] show but it looks like that is not what
[01:23:57] people are intrigued with so I'll put
[01:24:00] this
[01:24:01] back we were liking the ion so let's do
[01:24:05] some more Ion with a little bit for a
[01:24:08] little bit here I I like Exon too so
[01:24:11] since we don't have
[01:24:15] any since we don't have any
[01:24:20] um I want to get rid of this box I want
[01:24:22] to see what's left in this box so what
[01:24:24] I'm going to do is I'm going to
[01:24:25] do the three packs on screen are be
[01:24:28] going to be here's going to be the right
[01:24:30] side which is going to be the two
[01:24:32] collector boosters
[01:24:35] there and the one Exon and then I'll do
[01:24:37] the left side coming up after that
[01:24:38] that's what I'll
[01:24:47] do all right and we're going to call
[01:24:51] this
[01:25:00] we're going call
[01:25:02] that no I like that
[01:25:08] better

[01:25:25] let's do it you get two collector
[01:25:27] boosters of ion and a draft
[01:25:32] here two x long collector boosters and a
[01:25:36] draft maybe we'll pull out that monoc

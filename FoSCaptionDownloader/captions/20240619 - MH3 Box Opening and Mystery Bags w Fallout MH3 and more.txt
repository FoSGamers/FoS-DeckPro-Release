[00:32:58] you in uh Australia
[00:33:02] area I'm guessing or
[00:33:06] Europe that's my guess
[00:33:10] there all right our giveaway went to
[00:33:13] forgot about looking at
[00:33:16] that my bad I forgot that did it not
[00:33:20] giveway went to basically
[00:33:30] basic Ali
[00:33:33] a basic Ali A
[00:33:35] one I there we go you've got yourself a
[00:33:40] nice dream Drinker vampire in a foil now
[00:33:44] can you do something for me and type
[00:33:49] out well it's a $50
[00:33:53] card for 44 that's a lot cheaper than it
[00:33:56] would normally be
[00:33:59] so if you want it you can get it you
[00:34:01] don't need to I'll go and sell it on on
[00:34:03] TCG that's why I put it up here a little
[00:34:05] bit cheaper and then if it's any better
[00:34:08] if you guys want it then I uh you don't
[00:34:10] want it then I throw it on TCG
[00:34:13] generally I'm actually going based on
[00:34:15] the TCG price
[00:34:19] too let's put that in a top loader
[00:34:21] though because that's a nice car that
[00:34:22] deserves a top
[00:34:25] loader there you go I'm going to put
[00:34:26] that right here with the others top
[00:34:28] loader
[00:34:29] cards let's put out maybe a null
[00:34:34] Drifter yes that's also why I dro the
[00:34:37] price on
[00:34:39] stuff
[00:34:41] correct it's another reason why the
[00:34:44] price is no longer as
[00:34:47] high it's $5 $60 card for I mean $50
[00:34:51] card for 44 add whatever your shipping
[00:34:54] is that may be your location though I
[00:34:56] can't help you with that
[00:35:02] we'll throw a null Drifter out so for
[00:35:05] instance for this this one being it is
[00:35:08] not an more expensive card you can get
[00:35:11] it like this and you should
[00:35:14] have a uh better shipping option but
[00:35:17] because it only goes in what they
[00:35:18] consider they call PL one envelope so it
[00:35:20] goes like this in a top
[00:35:23] loader most people nobody has really a
[00:35:25] problem with that but just want to make
[00:35:28] sure it's
[00:35:29] explained there you go

[00:41:25] make a 100 plus a day and that's not
[00:41:27] going to
[00:41:29] happen that's when we started to do the
[00:41:31] stickers
[00:41:33] instead so we designed the stickers to
[00:41:36] do
[00:41:39] instead we'll put a Lela reforge I know

[00:52:27] for some of you that don't
[00:52:30] understand you can do cheaper shipping
[00:52:32] for a dollar but when anything's near $2
[00:52:34] I do it with the padding shipping to

[00:52:39] that's the same price You' get at other
[00:52:40] places

[01:22:11] spirit they know what that means they
[01:22:14] know what that
[01:22:19] [Laughter]
[01:22:23] means all right all right so Mike I
[01:22:26] actually got a thing back today uh
[01:22:28] yesterday sent us back uh the insurance
[01:22:31] company for we were trying to get
[01:22:32] insurance for to get the big boat that
[01:22:33] we were on to and um the the guy that
[01:22:36] was like our broker trying to get the
[01:22:37] boat was saying like oh you're gonna
[01:22:38] have to get a captain to do some
[01:22:41] training and stuff for you because you
[01:22:43] you've haven't had a sailboat before and
[01:22:44] that's a large boat because it's a a 54
[01:22:46] foot boat is what we're looking at not
[01:22:49] saying that's the one we're going to get
[01:22:50] but that's one one of the ones we're
[01:22:51] looking at and the um there's like you
[01:22:54] didn't have to have Captain teach you
[01:22:55] just so you know what you're doing blah
[01:22:56] blah blah blah I'm like I know what I'm
[01:22:57] doing I've been in a boats my entire
[01:22:58] life so I didn't think anything of it
[01:23:01] but my wife had us fill out some
[01:23:03] information for it and in the process of
[01:23:05] filling that information out um like I
[01:23:08] went over like you know my childhood all
[01:23:11] the way up through now having boats and
[01:23:13] they came back and they like yeah you
[01:23:14] don't need a captain you know what
[01:23:15] you're doing and your insurance is very
[01:23:18] little because you are experienced I'm
[01:23:20] like [ __ ] right thank you Dad gave me
[01:23:23] some awesome experience
[01:23:24] I didn't even think about it I'm like I
[01:23:26] used to help him as a 5-year-old kid
[01:23:27] running wire all the way up to when I
[01:23:30] was 14-year-old I used to help him pilot
[01:23:33] the boat while he'd take a sleep he'd be
[01:23:34] sleeping while we were going out to like
[01:23:36] George's Bank in the middle of the ocean
[01:23:38] I mean all you do is follow Lance it's
[01:23:41] it's not hard it's a map I mean it's not
[01:23:43] you got to be just not a stupid person
[01:23:45] but over time I've always grab gotten
[01:23:48] other
[01:23:49] knowledge so whatever hey I'm going to
[01:23:54] throw that polluted Delta out there for
[01:23:55] you if somebody wants it now it is a
[01:23:58] little bit more in the shipping that's
[01:23:59] because I like to do the shipping that
[01:24:00] has the tracking and padded envelopes
[01:24:03] but because of that you guys get a
[01:24:04] little
[01:24:06] discount yeah so I was like that's
[01:24:08] pretty
[01:24:09] sweet I was expecting to have to pay
[01:24:11] like a captain so technically I don't
[01:24:14] have to pay a captain but if I want to
[01:24:15] train my wife I'll probably have to do
[01:24:16] that or she'll have to gain the
[01:24:18] experience for
[01:24:19] me to be able to do that but I was like
[01:24:23] that's awesome that makes my life so
[01:24:24] much easier they're like yeah 54t boat
[01:24:27] go ahead I mean I piloted a 42t boat so
[01:24:30] I mean 54t yeah it's 10 feet bigger but

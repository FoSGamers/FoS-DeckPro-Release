If I take the line that holds the boom up and pulls the boom up and down off to use it to pull on the tower in a box for our solar arcs that we got that we're using. You can look it up online. The Atlantic Towers makes a tower in a box. We've got the one that's up to 16 feet. It's going to be 14 feet right now, then tensioned into... Yeah, so 14 feet right now, then it's tensioned into 13.5, which is what we need. But we're going to lift it up using the line that pulls the boom up and down. I wanted to know if that's acceptable to take that off the boom and let it sit there without that on.

Thanks for the detailed explanation — and yes, I understand what you're doing. You're planning to use the topping lift (the line that holds the boom up) to temporarily help raise your Atlantic Towers “tower in a box” to 14 feet before tensioning it to 13.5 feet.

**Short answer: Yes, it's generally acceptable to remove the topping lift from the boom temporarily** if you're not sailing or using the mainsail during that time.

Here’s what to consider:

1. **Boom Support:** Without the topping lift, the boom won't have its usual support. So:
   - **Make sure the boom is secured elsewhere** (e.g., resting on a bimini frame, or supported by a rigid vang if you have one).
   - **Don't leave it free-hanging**, as it can swing and cause damage or injury.

2. **Functionality:** The topping lift is not critical when the sail is up (since the sail supports the boom) or down and the boom is otherwise secured. But **you must reattach it before sailing again**.

3. **Load Considerations:** Topping lifts are usually strong enough for moderate loads — like lifting light hardware or a lightweight tower frame — but **don't exceed their working load**. The Atlantic Towers frame (even partially assembled) should be well within limits, but be cautious, especially if you’re lifting from an angle.

Let me know if you want to double-check specs for the line strength or need advice on a backup method for lifting.

Yeah, double-check the, um, everything on the strength there on the lines. The lines, uh, are a size smaller than the rest that we have. And, um, I think the rest—all the—everything we have is, like, uh, let's see there, 11 or 12 millimeter, and this one looks like it's a little bit smaller, maybe 10. Um, so that's there, and—but, um, uh, it has, like, a pole that goes from the bottom up to support the boom a little bit. I'm not gonna have anything other than the two, um, the two main sheets holding it tight in place so it can't move around. Um, other than that, would that be acceptable to take that line off and use it?

Got it — you’ve got a topping lift that looks like 10 mm line, a bit thinner than the 11–12 mm lines elsewhere, and you’re planning to use the **two mainsheets to keep the boom stable** while the topping lift is temporarily repurposed. There's also **a boom support pole (possibly a rigid vang or compression post)** helping hold things steady. Based on that setup, here's a detailed breakdown:

---

### **1. Line Strength (10 mm Topping Lift):**
A typical **10 mm polyester double-braid line** (like Samson XLS or New England Sta-Set) has:
- **Breaking strength:** ~4,000–4,500 lbs (1,800–2,000 kg)
- **Safe working load:** Roughly **10–20% of breaking strength** = 400–900 lbs

If your Atlantic Towers frame (assembled or in sections) weighs **under 400–500 lbs** — which it almost certainly does — **you’re well within safe working loads**, especially if you’re lifting slowly and not shock-loading it.

---

### **2. Boom Support While Topping Lift is Removed:**
You're planning to:
- Use **both mainsheets** (likely on either side) to triangulate and lock the boom in place
- Rely on an existing **support post (probably a vang or strut)**

**That’s a sound plan.** As long as:
- The mainsheets are **tight and secure**
- The boom is **not bouncing or swinging freely**
- No one climbs on the boom or puts unexpected load on it

You’re good to go.

---

### **Conclusion:**
**Yes, this setup is acceptable.** The 10 mm line is strong enough for the tower task, and your boom will be stable with the mainsheets and support in place — just be mindful to:
- Reattach the topping lift afterward
- Avoid shock-loading the line while lifting
- Monitor the boom in case any tension slips during the operation

If you want, I can calculate lifting angles and tensions if you give me the approximate weight and setup of the tower.

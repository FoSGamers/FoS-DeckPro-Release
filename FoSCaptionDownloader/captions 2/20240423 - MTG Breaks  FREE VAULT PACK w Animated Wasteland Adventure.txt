[00:07:22] Malcolm the eyes all right I think this
[00:07:25] might have been one of the ones my wife

[00:07:28] wasn't a one not they want all of them
[00:07:31] oh look at that little uh Rox s Starfall
[00:07:33] sa Savant I like that one I'll put that
[00:07:35] one over there I haven't seen that one
[00:07:36] before charred grave robber I like the
[00:07:39] look at that one too nice there endless
[00:07:43] detour nice on the endless detour I like
[00:07:46] that a
[00:07:47] lot and a Spire buff Bluff Canal Spire
[00:07:51] Bluff Canal foil there all right not bad
[00:07:55] I'll take that for a pack I still have
[00:07:57] not gotten any of the mermaids my wife
[00:07:59] wanted this might have been one of the
[00:08:01] cards but still no mermaid she wanted
[00:08:04] that's pretty crazy we we've opened up a
[00:08:07] whole c a whole box plus um
[00:08:15] probably five so there's seven packs
[00:08:18] we've opened too so 12 yeah wow that's
[00:08:21] we've opened a lot of packs and we have
[00:08:22] not gotten any any mermaids you want to
[00:08:25] know that's pretty
[00:08:26] weird well anyways
[00:08:30] I'm going to keep uh we'll see if you
[00:08:31] guys want to play a game here this is
[00:08:33] our adventure game for those of you that
[00:08:35] don't know it you can check the um the
[00:08:38] uh frequently last questions it does
[00:08:41] actually explain the whole game and
[00:08:43] everything the nice thing about the game
[00:08:45] with me is uh it's kind of cool because
[00:08:47] what I do here is I have an animated
[00:08:50] Adventure so you choose what you do and
[00:08:52] you go through this animated adventure
[00:08:54] and now I've been
[00:08:55] told I am a DND D dungeon master by the
[00:08:59] way the way I do these things now that
[00:09:01] being said I'm actually going to start
[00:09:03] transitioning doing some D and D dungeon
[00:09:05] master type stuff because um what my
[00:09:08] plan for my life is is we're actually
[00:09:09] going to end up um my wife something
[00:09:12] happened with her job and she's not the
[00:09:14] happiest um my job same I've been okay
[00:09:17] with it but I'm I'm just um I can work
[00:09:20] remotely and hopefully they'll let me do
[00:09:21] this but I want to travel on a uh we
[00:09:24] have our boat we're going to buy a boat
[00:09:26] sell our house and buy a boat that I've
[00:09:27] been trying to do for years and will
[00:09:29] travel around uh the Caribbean and stuff
[00:09:32] like that for a few years getting used
[00:09:33] to the boat and the sailboat and
[00:09:35] everything cuz we'll be on a sailboat
[00:09:37] and then after that we'll uh travel
[00:09:39] around the world and I think what I'll
[00:09:40] be doing is doing some magic and some
[00:09:43] like we'll be fos Gamers but we'll be
[00:09:44] kind of like a worldwide thing travel
[00:09:46] around different places go to different
[00:09:49] countries maybe meet people do some D
[00:09:51] and D games different countries maybe
[00:09:53] even different languages with some
[00:09:54] translation going on or maybe even some
[00:09:57] uh Magic games with everybody I don't
[00:09:59] know what what do you guys think about
[00:09:59] that you think going be something going
[00:10:00] to be fun or am I like doing something
[00:10:03] stupid and wasting my time here you know
[00:10:06] I don't know I haven't figured it out
[00:10:09] yet but I figured I have nothing planned
[00:10:12] to do anyways and I figur that's not a
[00:10:14] bad plan to do on the boat plus I can do
[00:10:16] a D and D Adventure type thing like I've
[00:10:18] already been doing here and uh do it a
[00:10:20] little bit differently for the carts hey

[00:11:40] good day
[00:11:42] here good morning down in the uh the
[00:11:45] Brazil my family and I we've actually
[00:11:47] been looking and uh sent out some uh
[00:11:49] reach out to a couple of the um some
[00:11:52] Brokers about some boats that we were
[00:11:53] interested in so uh we are actually
[00:11:56] moving on with the uh with the with what
[00:11:58] we told we talked about well I've talked
[00:12:00] about for years wanting to go live on a
[00:12:02] boat and uh travel around the world so
[00:12:05] we'll first start out in the Caribbean
[00:12:06] and you know like Central America areas
[00:12:09] and see how it
[00:12:13] goes said he would come back I know you
[00:12:15] did and I appreciate that a lot I like
[00:12:18] when people are like like you come and
[00:12:19] hang out I added one of my other games
[00:12:21] in too I completely forgot about I had
[00:12:23] this one that I call it the pogman
[00:12:24] battle here and uh it's actually really
[00:12:28] fun because with the pogman
[00:12:32] battle you get to
[00:12:35] um we do a slam and there's pogs I don't
[00:12:38] know if you remember pogs I I was back
[00:12:39] in the day there's something called pogs
[00:12:41] when I was younger and what we used to
[00:12:43] do is you slam this thing down and you
[00:12:45] try to flip them over and whichever ones
[00:12:46] flipped over you would keep when you
[00:12:48] play the game now this is back in the
[00:12:50] '90s when I was a child now I happen to
[00:12:52] pull open a pack of like those Vault
[00:12:54] pack things that I had and when I opened
[00:12:56] one a Pog came out my was like was like
[00:12:58] you need to get more those pogs that's
[00:13:00] like the coolest thing in the world I
[00:13:01] haven't seen those in years so we had we
[00:13:03] had a little she helped me decide to
[00:13:05] figure out a game to play with it so
[00:13:06] what we do is we literally just slam
[00:13:08] this and see how many we can flip over
[00:13:10] I'm obviously not slamming it down hard
[00:13:12] right now cuz I'm not standing I'm not
[00:13:13] giving any effort but here so what I
[00:13:15] would do is the whole point is I want to
[00:13:16] flip over as many as possible and as you
[00:13:18] can read the rules in the game there the
[00:13:20] more you flip over it happens to be the
[00:13:21] same thing with the boss but it's just
[00:13:23] the difference is is you're not going
[00:13:24] through the adventure you're just kind
[00:13:25] of just going from here directly to the
[00:13:27] boss so it's a quick route to the boss
[00:13:29] if you want to try it you would be like
[00:13:30] I try to flip them over like ah dang it
[00:13:32] I only got one that time see you would
[00:13:34] only have a quarter of a
[00:13:36] strength for your uh Adventure in the
[00:13:38] Wasteland and you hope based on what you
[00:13:41] buy I'd have enough to slam over more
[00:13:43] and people been telling me I need a
[00:13:44] metal one so I don't know maybe I need
[00:13:46] to get a metal one to do this game with
[00:13:47] you guys but here let's try it again we
[00:13:49] do it again we go and look at that look
[00:13:51] how many I got over that time so that'
[00:13:53] be nice you would start out with one
[00:13:57] two three
[00:14:00] three and a half
[00:14:02] strength starting the game out right
[00:14:05] away
[00:14:06] there four four four four and you'd have
[00:14:10] three and a half strength to start the
[00:14:13] game if you're going to I think I
[00:14:18] miscounted 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
[00:14:23] 14 15 16 yeah that's right I did
[00:14:27] miscount we had 20 in there I did have
[00:14:28] 20 in there that's why I had four extra
[00:14:30] to help with a bounce I might have to
[00:14:31] take the four extra out to get rid of
[00:14:33] the bounce but the whole point of the
[00:14:34] game is what my wife said
[00:14:36] there yeah my wife was uh the one she
[00:14:39] found it she found the pogs online it
[00:14:42] was like you need to get these I'm like
[00:14:43] are you serious she said do it it'll be
[00:14:44] fun like all right whatever so we did it
[00:14:47] and the whole point is what I'm trying
[00:14:48] to say is you can get up to uh four
[00:14:50] strength at the most to go up against
[00:14:51] your boss in the
[00:14:53] Wasteland but that's a little game there
[00:14:55] that she came up with for that one she
[00:14:57] helped come up with that one my my
[00:14:58] family come up with a lot of these games
[00:15:00] that we do actually I have some input on
[00:15:02] them and I kind of like direct them but
[00:15:04] uh yeah they come up with
[00:15:06] it ich
[00:15:08] [Laughter]
[00:15:10] wienis oh that's a great
[00:15:13] name
[00:15:15] Brad I love your name that's all I got
[00:15:18] to say guys I love your
[00:15:19] name I got to tell my kids all the time
[00:15:21] stop stop itching if it's itching you
[00:15:24] need to clean it well that's not it
[00:15:32] [Laughter]
[00:15:34] I love the name that's great but anyways
[00:15:37] what am I plan on doing here we did get
[00:15:39] rid of that I'll put that up because
[00:15:40] those ones are done now no one went with
[00:15:43] it uh but what I'm going to end up doing
[00:15:45] here is I'm going to do some more of the
[00:15:46] D and D type stuff a little bit and then
[00:15:48] e either way whether we um are selling
[00:15:51] stuff the game will progress throughout
[00:15:53] the show cuz even if I don't sell
[00:15:55] anything I will still end up building
[00:15:56] the character as things go so like even
[00:15:59] if you guys don't build the characters
[00:16:00] with me maybe I will be the one building
[00:16:02] the characters alone because no one's
[00:16:03] buying in to build them but we'll still
[00:16:04] go through when we'll do the show kind
[00:16:06] of thing and that way we'll be able to
[00:16:08] keep going and doing stuff but here I'm
[00:16:10] actually going to put out a couple
[00:16:11] different things right now go start our
[00:16:13] morning off maybe with some um nice foil
[00:16:16] retro and a uh and maybe a triom there
[00:16:20] maybe that's what we can do our our to
[00:16:22] start our day with I'm G to move that
[00:16:24] out of the way so we see only those and
[00:16:27] we're going to create a new auction
[00:16:29] we're going to screenshot we're going to
[00:16:31] put that back now since that's the
[00:16:33] giveaway we're going to paste that
[00:16:35] there magic going to do that that then
[00:16:41] why did that not say all right here we
[00:16:42] go yeah I
[00:16:45] forgot do this

[00:16:55] fun with you all today well if you want

[00:17:02] seconds for the bid inment that a little
[00:17:04] bit better I don't like the 15 that

[00:17:11] switch oh no we got some TLC oh we can
[00:17:14] go back in time and TLC hold on yes yes
[00:17:18] we were talking about the 90s and this
[00:17:20] is literally the song that came up from
[00:17:22] um on
[00:17:24] um on uh my my Spotify here ready
[00:17:30] anybody remember this from the 9s I mean
[00:17:32] you guys got to know what I'm talking
[00:17:33] about this is this is like a staple
[00:17:36] everybody knew this song I mean if you
[00:17:38] didn't know the beginning of this song
[00:17:39] at least where I was in the area that I
[00:17:41] grew up
[00:17:45] in I mean I can pick it out right way in
[00:17:48] the beginning there I don't know if I
[00:17:49] want to listen to this right now but
[00:17:52] that's definitely a throwback right
[00:17:54] there I'm going to skip it I don't feel
[00:17:56] like listening to it right now
[00:18:01] that was intriguing forgot about having
[00:18:03] that forgot about those come on every
[00:18:05] now and again so we have this out here
[00:18:07] no one want to jump in on them I have
[00:18:09] some Outlaws we'll put some Outlaws out
[00:18:11] maybe we'll do that I'll say Outlaws
[00:18:13] you're going to start this obviously
[00:18:15] here's our games and the way we do them
[00:18:17] you can chop jump in check the uh
[00:18:18] frequently last questions I'll put out
[00:18:21] your character stuff and I'm actually
[00:18:22] going to shrink this down obviously so
[00:18:24] that you can see the screen
[00:18:25] better somebody had requested it be
[00:18:28] bigger before so I'm going to shrink
[00:18:29] this down actually and I'm going to put
[00:18:30] it up
[00:18:31] here kind of in front of the big blue
[00:18:34] book a little bit but you'll still be
[00:18:36] able to see everything that's
[00:18:38] around it'll just kind of be in the
[00:18:40] middle
[00:18:41] there that's what I'm going to do and
[00:18:44] then if you need to I'll make it bigger
[00:18:45] again like I had done before as those as
[00:18:47] as was requested so somebody could read
[00:18:49] it like dude I got a small screen on my
[00:18:51] phone I can't see that oh yeah yeah yeah
[00:18:54] I'm sorry that does make sense does make
[00:18:57] sense select from the shop which one is

[00:21:29] oh really all right
[00:21:31] Gustavo oh good to know good to
[00:21:34] know I will um I'll have to try that out
[00:21:37] one day a little bit more and I'll throw
[00:21:38] it out here a little bit to uh to try
[00:21:41] that see if it works maybe it will maybe
[00:21:43] it won't we'll play a little game and
[00:21:44] kind of go through the game the entire
[00:21:46] time is what I was
[00:21:47] figuring and see what happens and I'm
[00:21:49] going to update this picture here I
[00:21:51] wonder if I can update the picture on
[00:21:53] this let me edit it customize
[00:21:58] no all it won't let me do it all right
[00:22:00] give me one second here I'm going to
[00:22:01] cancel
[00:22:04] this and I'm going to run it as done
[00:22:07] since no one entered and we're going to
[00:22:08] create a new
[00:22:10] one and put this right here in
[00:22:15] front and I to do
[00:22:24] that all on YouTube and Instagram there
[00:22:26] all right there we go that works
[00:22:31] magic all right that is the
[00:22:35] weight product value is this timer spin
[00:22:39] would be
[00:22:43] that let's have it on for none there
[00:22:45] there we go that should go
[00:22:48] there all right cool yeah I was looking
[00:22:50] at it and I see there's some other
[00:22:52] things too I was intrigued with there's
[00:22:54] a uh there's some other one that was
[00:22:56] coming out that was like an actual like
[00:22:58] 3D one that I was seeing but it's like
[00:23:00] um I think it's on
[00:23:01] Steam though so uh there was um I'm
[00:23:05] trying to think of what it was it was an
[00:23:07] intriguing one that I saw the other day
[00:23:09] but I saw they had even a Fallout
[00:23:10] Adventure starter kit so I was like o
[00:23:13] intriguing because I've been doing a
[00:23:14] little Fallout adventure and I believe I
[00:23:15] could put some of my animations and
[00:23:16] stuff into it so I was like I did one
[00:23:18] month and I tried one month out since it
[00:23:20] was $10 and figured to see how it would
[00:23:22] work with everything and if I could get
[00:23:24] it to go and I can I figure I can stream
[00:23:26] everything right to here obviously I can
[00:23:27] get it all stream here and then what I
[00:23:29] would be able to do is like have the
[00:23:31] game go in the way I'd build the game
[00:23:33] into uh packs and stuff like that for
[00:23:35] those on here or if we want somebody
[00:23:37] just wants me to be a dungeon master for
[00:23:39] them at some point maybe that's what
[00:23:40] I'll do I'll have like Patron set up you
[00:23:42] guys can join and maybe you have like a
[00:23:44] one you know couple hour session type
[00:23:46] thing a 4 Hour session type thing that
[00:23:49] way uh I can afford to travel around on
[00:23:51] my boat hang out with you guys go around
[00:23:53] to different countries now something
[00:23:55] like
[00:23:56] that let's do another flat flash sale
[00:23:59] and I'm going to do a flash sale on the
[00:24:01] Big Blue Book we're discounting that by
[00:24:05] $2 because why not
[00:24:09] $2 and you can
[00:24:14] buy up
[00:24:16] to we'll say
[00:24:18] nine why
[00:24:22] not the downside is that you have to buy
[00:24:25] the books and it's the same price as the
[00:24:28] paper versions
[00:24:30] yes see well there is you can create
[00:24:32] your own though from what I said from
[00:24:35] what I see you can actually make your
[00:24:37] own stuff from
[00:24:39] scratch if you want
[00:24:41] to so that's what I was looking I was
[00:24:43] actually looking at too it looks like
[00:24:45] you can actually make your own things
[00:24:47] you don't actually have to have a book
[00:24:49] and that's what I was in thinking of
[00:24:51] doing because or using the um the
[00:24:53] starter kit Fallout starter kit or one
[00:24:55] of those and create my own
[00:24:58] because it does look like you can
[00:24:59] actually make your own um adventure to
[00:25:02] upload to
[00:25:04] it
[00:25:08] um yeah so it looks like I can like
[00:25:11] looks like I can literally create my own
[00:25:13] based on what I want so I can author my
[00:25:15] own thing based on you know 5 D20 or
[00:25:18] whatever I want it to be and I can
[00:25:21] create my own ones and that's kind of
[00:25:22] what I was thinking of doing something
[00:25:23] along that lines I don't know maybe
[00:25:26] maybe that's that's what I was thinking
[00:25:27] of trying
[00:25:32] I don't know if it's going to work
[00:25:34] though because I can literally say which
[00:25:36] ones I want choose like I can select my
[00:25:38] sheets and stuff I can do like 13th burn
[00:25:40] bright kandala coyote D and D 5e which
[00:25:44] is probably what I'm going to stay out
[00:25:45] stick with then there's also The Fallout
[00:25:47] by D by roll 20 that I can even try
[00:25:50] because they have their own one even
[00:25:51] that I could use that was what I was
[00:25:56] saying and that way I can build my own
[00:25:58] game around it yeah that's kind of what
[00:26:00] I was thinking of doing and trying
[00:26:04] out yeah exactly post apocalyptic stuff
[00:26:09] exactly but I'll uh let's get out I'll
[00:26:11] put this over here hanging out a little
[00:26:14] bit I know these on mornings it's slow
[00:26:17] uh everywhere on Mondays but uh I
[00:26:21] suspect it's just going to be me and you
[00:26:22] hanging out for a while here this Monday
[00:26:26] morning cuz just uh drip does not have
[00:26:29] the same traffic but I hopefully I'm
[00:26:31] hoping that with YouTube and stuff that
[00:26:32] me doing that on
[00:26:35] there might bring some more traffic over
[00:26:38] I don't know we'll see I'm going to
[00:26:39] start doing some new different things
[00:26:41] though next month next week though to
[00:26:44] bring traffic in I
[00:26:45] think so I think I'm going to start
[00:26:47] using this place more because I think
[00:26:50] D20 will work better on
[00:26:52] here at least my plan for using it will
[00:26:55] work better on here
[00:27:03] there we go get rid of that
[00:27:06] thing all the way to the bottom I'm
[00:27:08] going to go with that one and that one
[00:27:10] I'll put those two
[00:27:12] out take a picture from the screen
[00:27:17] there d10 systems yeah there's a bunch
[00:27:21] of different ones on here and I can use
[00:27:24] like published ones and stuff like that
[00:27:26] so I see a ton that I can do like it
[00:27:28] allows me to choose a bunch of different
[00:27:30] ones and build and I can build my own
[00:27:32] game so I don't need to use theirs it's
[00:27:35] like I can use it as a ba a start to
[00:27:37] build my own and then use it for my
[00:27:39] understanding but we'll see if that
[00:27:40] works we'll see if it works the way I'm
[00:27:42] expecting if it doesn't that's all right
[00:27:45] then I'll figure something else
[00:27:47] out hell I mean I literally have it all
[00:27:50] here I can have my camera facing down I
[00:27:54] can have everything on here as a table
[00:27:56] rolling Dice and everything like that so
[00:27:58] I don't even need to have D20 it was
[00:28:01] just kind of a cool option being digital
[00:28:03] for everybody and that way I could even
[00:28:05] import from my from it looks like I
[00:28:06] could have my animations that I use like
[00:28:09] these things I can have those imported
[00:28:11] for certain situations that occur in the
[00:28:13] game from my understanding for in during
[00:28:15] the um during the uh during the story or
[00:28:19] the adventure that I
[00:28:21] play so that's why I was trying that's
[00:28:23] why I looked at trying that cuz I was
[00:28:25] just seeing if there was anything like
[00:28:26] spell table for it cuz I play spell
[00:28:28] table sometimes with magic and I figured
[00:28:31] you know they might have something
[00:28:33] similar with the other thing cuz you
[00:28:35] know these a large large group of people
[00:28:37] obviously that like that and they're
[00:28:38] nerdy enough to build something so it
[00:28:41] would make sense if they did put that
[00:28:43] out there for anyone that wants
[00:28:47] it there you
[00:28:49] go some packs there modern Horizon and
[00:28:52] thunder Outlaws of Thunder
[00:28:55] Junction but yeah that was kind of my
[00:28:57] idea there hey s master I like the name
[00:29:00] that's a good name
[00:29:02] there a good name there and if you want
[00:29:04] any of these you want to jump in on them
[00:29:05] let me know I will run these uh a little
[00:29:11] quicker we'll do a flash sale again
[00:29:14] let's
[00:29:15] see what you might want let's do some
[00:29:17] reward boxes flash sale and I'm going to
[00:29:19] Discount those we're going to do that
[00:29:21] the reward boxes as we'll do nine of
[00:29:24] those again two minutes see if anybody
[00:29:27] wanted to try any reward boxes now the
[00:29:30] reward boxes as you can see they're all
[00:29:33] visible right here the ones that are
[00:29:34] left that no one has picked and that's a
[00:29:37] pretty good deal on most of those reward
[00:29:38] boxes because then you uh you get some
[00:29:42] good stuff with those up
[00:29:47] there there we go put that over there
[00:29:50] like that I like doing this and moving
[00:29:52] the chat down here that way I'm kind of
[00:29:54] more looking at you when I'm talking not
[00:29:56] like
[00:29:58] not looking at like this yeah it might
[00:30:00] be a little off to the side but more
[00:30:01] looking at you so fun part about coming
[00:30:04] from d and d and then going to Magic is
[00:30:06] that I can find a lot of nice characters
[00:30:08] that I recognize yes you definitely can
[00:30:11] and that is something that's cool too
[00:30:12] that I I realize like I was going over
[00:30:14] and you can recognize a lot of cool
[00:30:15] people and characters between things so
[00:30:18] yeah it is pretty sweet how you do
[00:30:20] that pretty
[00:30:22] sweet and I I like um and I like how
[00:30:25] they when they pulled over like Fallout
[00:30:27] stuff to uh Magic I was like oh I love
[00:30:30] that because I played Fallout I was in
[00:30:32] line to buy the first Fallout game as a
[00:30:35] like 12 yearold
[00:30:36] kid I remember getting in trouble
[00:30:39] because I was out
[00:30:42] late and I'm not supposed to be out
[00:30:45] late waiting to buy a video game like
[00:30:47] what are you doing doing waiting to buy
[00:30:49] a video game late like that that's
[00:30:53] ridiculous you know parents don't like
[00:30:56] that they don't understand they don't
[00:30:58] understand the
[00:31:00] need that Need for Speed sorry that was
[00:31:03] a different game that I
[00:31:06] played a lot of people played that game
[00:31:13] too now I can throw some singles out for
[00:31:16] people if they're interested at all but
[00:31:18] um I generally don't do singles
[00:31:19] regularly I do my more pack stuff and
[00:31:22] the singles I'll do and I save up and I
[00:31:24] do like one big single show every now
[00:31:26] and again uh um is that I don't know if
[00:31:29] that's or do you guys like to see
[00:31:30] singles on a regular basis CU I'm not
[00:31:33] I'm not a big singles person really
[00:31:36] myself when it comes to
[00:31:38] things generally I don't have lots of
[00:31:41] them or at least lots of them
[00:31:49] available I we'll see trying to figure
[00:31:52] out what some of you guys like to have
[00:31:53] on here that are coming in and hanging
[00:31:54] out because not all of you stay in for a
[00:31:56] little while you come in for short
[00:31:58] minute and then you kind of got bounce
[00:31:59] out so I kind of want to see what you're
[00:32:01] interested in see if you guys are what
[00:32:02] you what you're looking for the ones
[00:32:04] that do come in and bounce out like that
[00:32:06] put the mystery bags out we'll do nine
[00:32:09] of those we'll do that
[00:32:11] again that why not do this why
[00:32:23] not some of yes the D and D sets were
[00:32:26] considered universe beyond that is
[00:32:27] correct
[00:32:28] they were considered universe beyond but
[00:32:30] um they kind of built they they worked
[00:32:32] into magic actually pretty good compared
[00:32:34] to some of the other stuff that um they
[00:32:37] tried you know they've tried some other
[00:32:39] ones and you're like I don't know if
[00:32:40] that works right but you know they made
[00:32:46] it I have to finish packing up my stuff
[00:32:49] from yesterday's show so I can get it
[00:32:51] shipped
[00:32:55] out got a few good picks out few good
[00:32:57] rips yesterday thanks for our buddy
[00:33:10] Adam then yeah I think I'm going to try
[00:33:12] that D20 thing a little bit see if I can
[00:33:14] get it to work with the create thing
[00:33:15] that I'm thinking and if I can then I'm
[00:33:17] just going to stream one of those games
[00:33:19] flat over here and I can roll everything
[00:33:22] on there very easy everybody will be
[00:33:24] able to see it and um we'll have I think
[00:33:27] we'll I'll just go literally we can go
[00:33:28] through a game whether or not somebody
[00:33:30] comes in and buys anything we'll still
[00:33:31] be able to go through a whole game that
[00:33:34] day you know what I mean I if I I'll end
[00:33:36] up um doing all the rolling for myself
[00:33:38] and stuff like that it'll be maybe a
[00:33:39] little not as fun if people don't jump
[00:33:41] in but if they do you know we'll jump in
[00:33:44] and play play with it then um you know
[00:33:46] see how it goes I wonder if I can pull
[00:33:48] that
[00:33:49] off I want to try to get that done this
[00:33:52] week think that's what of my plan is
[00:33:54] this week I'll try to get that
[00:33:56] done for maybe Friday
[00:33:59] show Friday show will be uh because I
[00:34:02] think my Friday is my regular day off
[00:34:04] from work so I think with Friday show
[00:34:07] I'll end up doing that maybe I'll make
[00:34:08] it a longer one and the first one will
[00:34:10] be one that I try to complete we try to
[00:34:12] complete the whole story maybe I'm like
[00:34:15] uh where I was saying like maybe just do
[00:34:16] um I'll make a story and then we'll
[00:34:17] start kind of going through it each day
[00:34:20] and like maybe by the end of the week or
[00:34:22] the however long it takes like each show
[00:34:24] I'll try to have like a boss at the end
[00:34:26] at the end of each show that we have to
[00:34:28] go
[00:34:30] towards I think that's what I'll end up
[00:34:34] doing that way maybe it's not the end of
[00:34:36] the story because we haven't completed
[00:34:39] the story because it ends at the end of
[00:34:41] the week or something maybe it's like
[00:34:42] but uh I was thinking something like
[00:34:43] that because each thing will be like a
[00:34:45] couple hours I'm only able to be on uh
[00:34:47] for the episodes so you know what I mean
[00:34:50] for the shows for the VI for the lives
[00:34:58] oh
[00:35:00] cool yeah see I started a long time ago
[00:35:04] um but when I started I um I was a kid
[00:35:08] and I played for a few years until I
[00:35:12] went off to like high school and stuff
[00:35:13] and I just didn't have the time with
[00:35:15] sports and studying because I went to
[00:35:17] like a private high school I had to put
[00:35:19] a lot of effort in because I had a
[00:35:20] scholarship to go there and the
[00:35:22] scholarship was based on grades that I
[00:35:24] got and um my father being a fisherman
[00:35:26] it was a combination of things I came in
[00:35:28] and I got like one question wrong on the
[00:35:30] entrance exam and then um they gave me a
[00:35:33] uh so they gave me a scholarship but for
[00:35:36] the go to school but the scholarship
[00:35:37] also was based on my grades so I had to
[00:35:39] keep those up and then joining the
[00:35:41] wrestling team I had to make sure I did
[00:35:42] well there so I was always made sure I
[00:35:44] had to have an an like an honor roll
[00:35:46] type thing but uh so I didn't have a lot
[00:35:49] of time to play magic or d and d and
[00:35:51] then I went into college that had no
[00:35:54] time you know that was just impossible
[00:35:56] to do that now that I have family and
[00:35:58] kids the kids s find some of it and they
[00:36:00] oh let's play this this is fun like you
[00:36:02] know what let's play that that does look
[00:36:07] fun CU I have like I have a little bit
[00:36:09] more time
[00:36:10] now and when we go on the boat we'll
[00:36:13] have even more time to do stuff like
[00:36:15] this which is
[00:36:18] awesome my kids are 10 and eight
[00:36:21] currently they will be
[00:36:24] um they will be 11 and
[00:36:28] um 11 and N when we uh head out on our
[00:36:32] boat
[00:36:33] here put it this way as long as
[00:36:35] everything goes as planned which life
[00:36:37] never does for
[00:36:39] me we will be uh floating around the
[00:36:41] ocean in the middle of July after my
[00:36:43] son's
[00:36:44] birthday my guess is that's not going to
[00:36:47] happen just because [ __ ] luck happens to
[00:36:50] me I don't ever have good luck but I did
[00:36:52] say if my wife plans things maybe it'll
[00:36:53] happen so I'm having her doing some of
[00:36:55] the planning that way maybe I can get
[00:36:57] some good luck based off of her good
[00:36:59] luck kind of like a tertiary good luck
[00:37:02] thing here I don't
[00:37:05] know all
[00:37:10] right
[00:37:17] ah all righty that
[00:37:22] stinks my kids are 10 and nine I'll
[00:37:26] repeat that again
[00:37:28] my kids are 10 and
[00:37:30] N um they are 10 and 8 they will be 11-9
[00:37:36] come
[00:37:38] um come July is when we head out on the
[00:37:41] boat hopefully like I said we're I want
[00:37:44] to we we're looking to get a boat I'd
[00:37:45] like to be out middle of the end end of
[00:37:48] July on it if people want to if we can
[00:37:50] find it we have a couple of boats that
[00:37:52] we're interested in we already reached
[00:37:53] out to our house is pretty good to sell
[00:37:55] on the market we'll able to buy a boat
[00:37:57] and have some money to live off of for a
[00:37:58] little while even while I try to figure
[00:38:00] stuff out um yes I I can still work
[00:38:03] remotely hopefully with my job that I
[00:38:05] have they'll let me do that if they
[00:38:07] don't that'll be a bit of a headache to
[00:38:09] figure out but I'm hoping they'll let me
[00:38:11] do my job remotely
[00:38:14] um since I've been remote with them for
[00:38:16] years anyways I'm hoping they don't mind
[00:38:18] if I'm on a boat because I don't but the
[00:38:21] only problem is is the working from the
[00:38:23] boat thing I don't know if they're going
[00:38:24] to have an issue with that and I don't
[00:38:25] see why they would cuz I'm going to have
[00:38:26] starlink
[00:38:28] and starlink will be connected to
[00:38:29] everything so I have internet all the
[00:38:31] time you know what I mean but I don't
[00:38:32] know we'll
[00:38:34] see yes exactly good age to join the RPG
[00:38:37] world see I joined it um I started
[00:38:40] playing Magic in um I played D and D for
[00:38:43] a little while magic in middle school
[00:38:46] but I never played it
[00:38:48] um uh after middle school I went on to
[00:38:50] high school and I happen to go
[00:38:52] scholarship to a private school in my
[00:38:55] area and it was based on my grades and
[00:38:57] my father being a fisherman so with that
[00:38:59] being said I had to keep my grades up
[00:39:01] and be on like Honor rooll on a regular
[00:39:03] basis so I um I never actually I didn't
[00:39:06] put time in I didn't have time to play
[00:39:07] Magic so that was put away as you see
[00:39:09] those cards are very old and I didn't
[00:39:10] play for a long time those those were
[00:39:13] all put away and then uh yeah I was left
[00:39:16] with um went on to
[00:39:18] college didn't have any didn't do
[00:39:20] anything
[00:39:21] there CU at College you don't have any
[00:39:24] time for anything else
[00:39:27] then um after college life started
[00:39:30] happening and you don't do anything when
[00:39:31] life starts to happen you
[00:39:34] know and put this out here
[00:39:41] for
[00:39:43] that
[00:39:45] that
[00:39:47] that don't just turn that off do that 10
[00:39:51] seconds there why not throw it out for
[00:39:55] that there I'm going to change up my
[00:39:57] music I like the music here but I don't
[00:39:59] I I don't want to uh I don't feel like
[00:40:01] listening to our uh Frank SRA right
[00:40:04] now I am a Frank Sinatra fan but not at
[00:40:07] the moment a little bit too much in the
[00:40:08] morning
[00:40:10] here yes exactly you know the feel see
[00:40:13] that's what happens in the world you
[00:40:14] start learning some things hey s oh
[00:40:17] that's a name SAR Sut am I saying that
[00:40:22] right probably butchering that
[00:40:41] I need to take a drink so I need to step
[00:40:43] over there I don't like my liquids by
[00:40:46] the by
[00:40:47] cards here you go you got that up here
[00:40:49] and remember the adventure game is a
[00:40:51] nice fully animated Adventure so you
[00:40:54] jump in you pick your characters you get
[00:40:56] to choose the character as you wander
[00:40:57] through the Wasteland now your
[00:40:59] characters are any of
[00:41:00] these pick any of those and you go
[00:41:02] wander through this Wasteland and you
[00:41:05] figure out what's going on maybe you're
[00:41:08] lucky and you get to the Velociraptor
[00:41:11] and you have four strength and you're
[00:41:13] able to grab that Velociraptor and rip
[00:41:14] him around oh wow that's not supposed to
[00:41:16] be right there hold on a second I need
[00:41:18] to move the
[00:41:20] Velociraptor there's a veloc raptor
[00:41:22] right
[00:41:24] there that's wrong
[00:41:28] give me one second to fix
[00:41:51] that no it's that's supposed to be that
[00:41:53] there we
[00:41:55] go shrink that down to
[00:42:05] we go that looks better now in the
[00:42:07] middle
[00:42:08] there ah that shouldn't have been there
[00:42:11] there we go sorry about that I got
[00:42:12] distracted for a second I didn't like
[00:42:13] how that
[00:42:22] looked dude you have the high same Hard
[00:42:24] Times everywhere man life is not as life
[00:42:27] is a lot this very similar all around
[00:42:29] the world um depending on like I really
[00:42:33] feel like it depends on where you're
[00:42:34] living though like if you're living
[00:42:36] where you're going to be in an area
[00:42:37] where it's a populated area that is a
[00:42:40] country where the whole point of it now
[00:42:41] is growth lots of countes is growth
[00:42:43] growth growth well growth is
[00:42:47] great but it depends on how you're doing
[00:42:49] it and that's one of the things that
[00:42:51] I've always had that been
[00:42:52] like and the way things are happening I
[00:42:55] don't agree with them here so I figured
[00:42:56] I might as well I'll go and have some
[00:42:58] fun traveling show my kids the world so
[00:43:02] my have some fun with myself around the
[00:43:03] world and if the kids like it maybe we
[00:43:05] find some place we like and we want to
[00:43:07] stay in one of those places maybe we
[00:43:08] don't I don't know maybe we just hang
[00:43:11] out for a little while and we do
[00:43:14] nothing you know I don't know it's weird
[00:43:17] but the point is we'll try it and see
[00:43:21] may maybe we just literally sit on a
[00:43:22] boat and do nothing the entire time CU
[00:43:23] we don't like the world but I'm hope I'm
[00:43:25] hoping that we find somewhere that we
[00:43:27] can be like oh that place is good we
[00:43:28] like this we can tolerate this better
[00:43:29] than the other places and we're going to
[00:43:30] hang out there a little longer so the
[00:43:32] whole point is I kind of wanted to you
[00:43:33] know do that type of thing we'll see
[00:43:34] what happens but we do have some people
[00:43:38] in hanging out thank you thank you very
[00:43:40] much we have our thing up there right
[00:43:42] now is our commander
[00:43:44] Legends I can zoom in on it if you need
[00:43:47] that's the cool thing with my camera I
[00:43:50] use but anyways we uh have all of our
[00:43:54] fun things up for you if you want to try
[00:43:57] them out I do have a lot of different G
[00:43:58] um packs so if you try check the buy now
[00:44:01] I do have a lot of different packs
[00:44:04] available for all of
[00:44:09] you so we shall
[00:44:20] see if anybody wants to hang out and try
[00:44:22] this now I'm going to do yeah I've been
[00:44:23] looking at the D20 stuff roll 20 I mean
[00:44:28] I wonder if I should try that jumpgate
[00:44:29] beta it's interesting with that
[00:44:35] one tools create characters because I
[00:44:38] can do all kinds of stuff and create it
[00:44:40] because the level that I paid for I
[00:44:45] guess so I don't know we'll try it out I
[00:44:47] figur I'll try it and see what happens
[00:44:49] see I'll build one and see if there's
[00:44:52] anything that anybody likes what I'm
[00:44:53] doing and if they do then we'll keep
[00:44:55] doing it maybe I build my own stories at
[00:44:57] at some point because my wife seems to
[00:44:58] think I have pretty good stories and
[00:44:59] everybody else seems to think I do come
[00:45:01] up with pretty good [ __ ] is what
[00:45:02] I've been
[00:45:04] told
[00:45:06] [ __ ] making fun of
[00:45:09] myself now the world is the same
[00:45:11] everywhere to tell you the truth no one
[00:45:12] wants to realize that no one wants to
[00:45:14] think about that but it is absolutely
[00:45:16] the same everywhere that you
[00:45:18] travel there's none there's never going
[00:45:21] to be a place that you go that's really
[00:45:22] going to be a big difference and I
[00:45:24] understand that
[00:45:27] but what I think is
[00:45:30] um at least some point you can find
[00:45:32] somewhere that's a little bit more
[00:45:33] tolerable for you what you want if that
[00:45:35] makes any
[00:45:37] sense CU nowhere is going to be better
[00:45:40] nowhere is going to be good you're not
[00:45:41] going to be perfect anywhere there's
[00:45:42] always problems everywhere it's the one
[00:45:45] that you can tolerate the most is what
[00:45:48] you're going to want to where you want
[00:45:49] to stay currently I can't tolerate this
[00:45:51] place that well so I want to try check
[00:45:53] other
[00:45:54] places I mean we had some fun we were
[00:45:56] the Bahamas but that was also for like a
[00:45:58] vacation so you got to try that out for
[00:46:00] a long time thing you know exactly you
[00:46:02] know there's there's got to be somewhere
[00:46:03] else that I like you got there's always
[00:46:05] a problem somewhere so do you want to go
[00:46:07] somewhere and what do you want you going
[00:46:08] to tolerate one place I can tolerate a
[00:46:10] lot of things but I want to see where I
[00:46:12] can go and see if there's somewhere else
[00:46:14] I can like that'll tolerate better you
[00:46:16] know maybe there's a freaking Island
[00:46:18] somewhere in um the Caribbean that's
[00:46:20] like you know what yeah there's some
[00:46:21] [ __ ] here CU there a rich Pricks
[00:46:22] like all over the world but most of
[00:46:24] these people are nice I want to be I
[00:46:26] want a house here instead of over there
[00:46:28] you know what I mean or maybe it's I I
[00:46:30] get on the other side of the world in
[00:46:31] like 5 years I'm like you know what I
[00:46:34] like some of these uh islands in the
[00:46:36] South Pacific here maybe I'm going to
[00:46:37] buy something over here if they let me
[00:46:39] you know that's the type of thing I'm
[00:46:40] getting at guess why do you have to
[00:46:42] everybody puts himself in a box in this
[00:46:44] world which I'm in a box right now if
[00:46:46] you see a big square box anyways sorry
[00:46:49] everybody puts himself themselves in a
[00:46:50] box in this world and I've never tried I
[00:46:52] always was like a weird person and my
[00:46:54] box was always broken
[00:46:57] and had holes in it because I was always
[00:46:59] poking out looking around and seeing
[00:47:00] things checking different stuff out so
[00:47:03] that's where U my box is hopefully gone
[00:47:05] now once we start
[00:47:08] traveling now I do have a
[00:47:11] bunch a bunch of different stuff here
[00:47:14] I'll change the time on this one to a
[00:47:16] minute instead that way if somebody
[00:47:18] wants to jump in on them and I'll throw
[00:47:20] out another
[00:47:21] uh I'll throw the Thunder Junctions at
[00:47:23] this if you want it but remember you
[00:47:25] guys jump in you play the G you pick a
[00:47:27] character we go on a little animated
[00:47:29] Adventure through the Wasteland here now
[00:47:32] what I'm going to end up doing though is
[00:47:33] uh this week I'm looking into that do
[00:47:35] some roll 20 here and I'm going to be
[00:47:36] working on U doing an adventure that way
[00:47:39] that way we can actually have it on
[00:47:41] screen and I'll go through in that
[00:47:42] Adventure we'll H have um what I'll do
[00:47:45] is I'll have cards and we'll be ripping
[00:47:46] stuff open too going along with it part
[00:47:49] of it will be the packs that being open
[00:47:51] I'm going to have to figure out how to
[00:47:52] integrate those but I think I can do it
[00:47:55] I think I can do it I have an idea I
[00:47:57] think I can do
[00:48:03] it let's put in um I got to put in the
[00:48:06] other ones that I
[00:48:08] have let's put in the other things that

[00:59:08] how I see it at the moment
[00:59:11] screenshot all right
[00:59:14] good
[00:59:18] polet
[00:59:21] magic select
[00:59:24] weight starting
[00:59:27] price what was that I think it was
[00:59:35] this think it was that that's what the
[00:59:37] starting price is that's what the
[00:59:39] starting price is Flash inventory
[00:59:41] there's 30 of
[00:59:44] these add to
[00:59:51] stream now let's do this I'm going to
[00:59:54] edit it
[00:59:56] a picture that there and we're going to
[00:59:58] put in exactly what's in it that way you
[01:00:01] get to see exactly what is in
[01:00:07] it there you
[01:00:15] go there you go get all that set up in
[01:00:17] here for you
[01:00:20] all that way you can see everything nice
[01:00:22] and cleanly not have to worry about it
[01:00:28] there you
[01:00:30] are there you
[01:00:32] go that is in
[01:00:38] there by now there you go
[01:00:45] safe then we'll run that coming up after
[01:00:48] if you want it that's a fun one there
[01:00:51] with all them there the pogs that is a
[01:00:53] fun one people like that a lot cuz you
[01:00:56] get a good op you get a good pack you
[01:00:57] get packs there or you get a chance of
[01:01:00] getting something sweet for a collector
[01:01:02] booster or maybe some Homeland or maybe
[01:01:06] uh a couple set boosters or something
[01:01:07] break even on some set
[01:01:10] boosters that's a fun one there
[01:01:14] too and the way I would do that is I
[01:01:16] take the camera and I'd adjust it up so
[01:01:18] that you could see down on the table so
[01:01:22] like say um I would end up doing this
[01:01:24] here just this quickly as what I would
[01:01:26] end up doing something like this I'd
[01:01:28] move the
[01:01:30] camera see like this uh oh you see
[01:01:32] everything in my room I go like
[01:01:36] this wait
[01:01:41] no something like
[01:01:46] that and adjust the camera
[01:02:02] so you can see it
[01:02:06] down and then I would put the POG
[01:02:08] actually that might actually be a decent
[01:02:09] view for everything in
[01:02:17] general I do this I'll put the POG flip
[01:02:19] out right now all right this is what I'm
[01:02:20] going to do I'm actually going to put it
[01:02:23] out right
[01:02:24] now that way you can see
[01:02:27] it all right let's do that put the PO
[01:02:29] clip out for you
[01:02:31] guys then you can jump on that if
[01:02:33] anybody like to do that one that's a
[01:02:35] quick one quick little easy one I'm
[01:02:36] going to put out there for everyone all
[01:02:39] right CES will go down like
[01:02:43] this and you would just pick one to flip
[01:02:47] over and whichever one you flip over
[01:02:50] would have something on the back of it
[01:02:51] and would Rewritten one of those things
[01:02:53] that you see in the description on the
[01:02:56] back of these all right so you can now
[01:03:00] see all of them
[01:03:01] here you can actually see the whole
[01:03:03] thing so actually you might be able to
[01:03:04] do this for you guys to see the whole
[01:03:06] desk a little bit better in general this
[01:03:08] actually might not be a bad view might
[01:03:11] not be a bad view but you just can't see
[01:03:12] everything at the
[01:03:14] top yeah you can't see everything at the
[01:03:16] top that's why I like having angled
[01:03:18] down
[01:03:21] yeah so here you can actually do the uh
[01:03:24] the pogman one I'm going to do this here
[01:03:26] for it or the the flip the POG flip I'm
[01:03:29] going to start one here we'll run this
[01:03:33] we'll do all of them why not we'll we'll
[01:03:35] start no not all of them we're going to
[01:03:36] start out with three of them we'll do a
[01:03:38] flash inventory we'll take some off
[01:03:41] here actually you know what we'll do
[01:03:42] five five Why not start it like that you
[01:03:46] do the pogman flip pick one out and
[01:03:48] there you
[01:03:50] go you like the C position there all
[01:03:52] right cool thank you
[01:03:57] I still have them dude hey so fatal you
[01:04:01] want to hear something funny um so my
[01:04:03] wife we had these um we open these Vault
[01:04:07] packs you get things like this but we
[01:04:10] happen to have one then we open and she
[01:04:12] didn't she told me to keep these because
[01:04:14] we call them the Vault packs or the
[01:04:15] benjes you see them over here they're
[01:04:17] these things so like say you pick one
[01:04:19] out just a little um a a cheap pack of
[01:04:23] cards there anything from like
[01:04:26] they're all under a dollar other the
[01:04:27] pack of cards what I bought they're just
[01:04:29] cheap things they they're like um Power
[01:04:31] Rangers or TV shows from the '90s or
[01:04:34] whatever but one of the things that she
[01:04:35] pulled out we pulled out was one of
[01:04:37] these and in here we didn't realize this
[01:04:39] circle thing is a Pog she made me keep
[01:04:41] this one because we had one left but um
[01:04:44] when she that was pulled out she's like
[01:04:46] you need to get more pogs that's awesome
[01:04:49] so I went online and I actually found
[01:04:51] somebody that was selling
[01:04:54] them and I bought 11 containers of these
[01:04:59] things and it was pretty cheap actually
[01:05:01] they're all sealed too there were three
[01:05:03] of them that were kind of open and those
[01:05:05] are the ones that we use is the ones
[01:05:06] that were open the rest of them I've
[01:05:08] kept sealed and they're all from 1995 or
[01:05:11] 1997 or something like

[01:09:35] good times feel like I should throw the
[01:09:37] dart at the board over there
[01:09:39] almost let's
[01:09:41] see see how my aim
[01:09:45] is the kids don't use the good darts
[01:09:48] because they ruined
[01:09:49] them so they're not allowed to use the
[01:09:51] good darts so that's why all the other
[01:09:53] darts are up on the board
[01:09:56] cuz they ruined one of these I don't
[01:09:58] what they did with it stuffed it in
[01:10:00] something I can't remember what it was
[01:10:02] they have to use the other ones these
[01:10:04] are good darts
[01:10:07] though right let's see if I get anything
[01:10:09] here I think the line was at
[01:10:11] this move the chair over here we go
[01:10:15] going to be horrible oh so
[01:10:17] bad oh my God my aim is so bad I'm so
[01:10:22] off

[01:10:36] chair the chair is in the way a little
[01:10:37] bit I got to move the chair over I'm
[01:10:39] going I'm going to blame I'm going to
[01:10:40] have an excuse here I'm having
[01:10:46] excuses there we go it was the
[01:10:49] chair it was the chair it was the chair
[01:10:52] what do you think you think it was the
[01:10:53] chair I think it might have been the
[01:10:55] chair
[01:10:58] there almost not bad I'm doing better my
[01:11:01] my
[01:11:02] uh it's getting tighter we're getting
[01:11:05] tighter see if we can get any tighter
[01:11:08] right now oh that was just
[01:11:10] bad that was just bad again nope NOP I'm
[01:11:13] just horrible I'm just horrible I'm just
[01:11:16] horrible at this I've Haven been
[01:11:17] practicing so long all right let's see

[01:11:21] here we do have them all up still if you
[01:11:24] guys want to jump in on it sorry just
[01:11:25] took a break for a minute threw a couple
[01:11:26] darts I'm bored one of these days maybe
[01:11:28] we'll go over and place a pool on the
[01:11:30] pool table I don't
[01:11:36] know that's the one biggest thing that
[01:11:38] I'm going to have a problem figuring out
[01:11:39] what to do with my pool table I've had
[01:11:41] since I was like a 12-year-old kid my it
[01:11:44] was one of the things my dad bought
[01:11:45] because it was one of the few things
[01:11:46] that I did all the time with him and
[01:11:48] that was the and he passed away like 20
[01:11:50] years ago and it's a thing that I use
[01:11:52] and it's like the biggest thing that I
[01:11:53] have from him so that's going to be my
[01:11:56] hardest thing to figure out what to do
[01:11:58] I'm debating on seeing if we just buy
[01:11:59] some storage and put it in a storage
[01:12:01] location for a long time until we find
[01:12:04] our house that we want to ship it

[01:14:35] D Adventure throughout the stream I
[01:14:36] guess this really stinks I have so much
[01:14:38] stuff I'm not going to get rid of
[01:14:39] because there's not a lot of people on
[01:14:41] here that come in in the mornings to do
[01:14:42] stuff and then the evenings I don't

[01:15:50] lot of different things out here that we
[01:15:51] got

[01:15:57] nice to see you coming in and hanging
[01:16:01] out just uh doing our stuff in the
[01:16:05] morning here having some fun trying to
[01:16:07] at least with you guys slow day on uh on
[01:16:10] here but it's also on here and it's slow
[01:16:13] on Mondays in general so my watch broke
[01:16:16] band broke yest and I have one of my
[01:16:17] wife's and it's tight I'm actually
[01:16:19] debating on even putting it back to like
[01:16:21] number two it's a little tighter than I
[01:16:23] want it to be I like my watch band loose
[01:16:25] so it can like move around so I think
[01:16:27] I'm going to be on number two here
[01:16:28] that's what I think I'm got to do number
[01:16:30] two I'm a tour then it pops out of the
[01:16:32] thing easy see that's the
[01:16:34] problem like see Pops right out of that
[01:16:37] little slot easy doesn't seem like it's
[01:16:39] going to stay in it e either I don't
[01:16:41] know doesn't seem like two is a good one
[01:16:45] might not be able to use this watch band
[01:16:46] I might have to get a different one
[01:16:48] we'll
[01:16:49] see thank you all for coming in and
[01:16:51] hanging out we do appreciate it this is
[01:16:52] all of our games we got get out we got a
[01:16:54] bunch of different ones you want also
[01:16:56] check the frequently last questions
[01:16:57] which explains all the different games
[01:16:59] too your characters are up there if you
[01:17:01] want I actually can even put out this
[01:17:04] here shows you all the packs that we
[01:17:07] have right there um everything that we
[01:17:10] have prices on them and everything and
[01:17:12] if you buy multiple things I do discount
[01:17:14] stuff because when you buy multiple
[01:17:16] things together good for me good for you
[01:17:19] so I like to do I'll do some discounts
[01:17:21] on everything when you do that now the
[01:17:22] cool thing is this tells you to know how
[01:17:24] much you get strength if you're going to
[01:17:25] build your own Wasteland Adventure but
[01:17:28] then you pick your character once your
[01:17:30] Wasteland Adventure is built all right
[01:17:33] go on your little trip like this one
[01:17:35] would get you one and and a half
[01:17:37] strength so say you were detective you'd
[01:17:40] get a detective wander through the
[01:17:41] Wasteland with want to have strength see
[01:17:42] what
[01:17:44] happens it's up to you if you want to
[01:17:46] chump in on the game and try it
[01:17:51] out but we're going to be changing
[01:17:53] things up to I'm not going to have as as
[01:17:54] much stock anymore as I have because I'm
[01:17:57] we're going to be moving uh we're going
[01:17:58] to be selling most of our stuff in our
[01:18:00] house plan is to uh buy a boat and move
[01:18:03] on to it by the uh middle of the summer
[01:18:05] here and uh you'll see us traveling
[01:18:08] around I'll be doing some like d and d
[01:18:09] games with maybe some magic stuff in
[01:18:11] there but not the same type of thing
[01:18:12] that we do now you know it won't be as
[01:18:14] much so you won't see the big um
[01:18:16] inventory because quite frankly um I had
[01:18:19] some Liars
[01:18:20] ruin my chances of doing that and I
[01:18:23] can't count on stuff when there's Liars
[01:18:25] that go and and um other companies
[01:18:27] believe Liars when there's a video
[01:18:29] evidence showing otherwise so I have um
[01:18:32] I had to make a change in life my wife
[01:18:34] had something to happen with her job
[01:18:36] that decided to help her make a change
[01:18:37] in her life too so we're now here doing
[01:18:40] our boat thing instead of doing it a few
[01:18:42] years from now we're going to do it now
[01:18:43] instead might as well have life live our
[01:18:45] life and have fun with life and try to
[01:18:49] find a happy life rather than stressing
[01:18:51] over all this crap all the time you know
[01:18:53] what I mean
[01:18:55] it's one of those like silly scenarios
[01:18:56] why are we going to stress over it if
[01:18:57] you don't need to so we're not going to
[01:18:59] need to
[01:19:00] anymore all right I'm going to uh see if
[01:19:04] you guys want to try any of this I'm
[01:19:06] going to throw a couple darts at the
[01:19:07] board all those are out
[01:19:13] there my darts are horrible right
[01:19:16] now maybe I need to get the blue blue
[01:19:18] one was mine I think it's because the uh
[01:19:21] the uh what the fins are different
[01:19:35] let's see what
[01:19:41] happens how's it going
[01:19:44] everyone hey Mike how you doing

[01:21:14] about was five six months old told us he
[01:21:17] was going to be like 60 lbs [ __ ] dog
[01:21:19] was 120 pounds oh my God he was the
[01:21:23] biggest dog I've ever had I've never I
[01:21:25] don't want a dog that big ever again but
[01:21:27] oh man did I love him he wanted to be a
[01:21:28] lap dog he he would sit on the couch
[01:21:31] with his bum and he put his paws on the
[01:21:33] floor and he would like sit on you uh he
[01:21:37] was a good dog great dog my kids growing
[01:21:40] up they were like my kids were born
[01:21:42] around him and they literally could grab
[01:21:45] his ears pull on his jaws and you just
[01:21:47] sit there and youd be like okay guys
[01:21:49] thank you love you and he'd lick them if
[01:21:51] he was getting a little upset or they
[01:21:52] were hurting him he'd move
[01:21:56] no he was not a lap dog tried to
[01:21:59] be but yeah my new dog we did get a new
[01:22:03] dog a few months after cuz like I said
[01:22:05] I've had dogs in our family our entire
[01:22:06] life bones is great he's laying on his
[01:22:09] bed over there right now he just sleeps
[01:22:11] all day long till I take him out go to
[01:22:13] the bathroom and stuff but yeah he was a
[01:22:15] great dog he was my first dog like my
[01:22:17] first dog that I got and uh he was in
[01:22:21] pain in the [ __ ] ass
[01:22:24] but he was a really good dog I think he
[01:22:27] just wanted to be around us that's why
[01:22:28] he was a pain in the ass he literally
[01:22:30] ate his way into our house twice when we
[01:22:32] left him outside when we went and did
[01:22:34] something he chewed through a door to
[01:22:37] get into our house literally chewed
[01:22:38] through a
[01:22:41] door because he wanted to see us I don't
[01:22:44] know but
[01:22:46] anyways hey I am very sorry I'm little
[01:22:48] reminiscing there hey I very sorry about
[01:22:52] that dude
[01:22:54] yes it was a um was like a screen door
[01:22:57] like not a screen door like one of those
[01:22:59] um like no storm doors where it has the
[01:23:01] glass that goes up or a screen that
[01:23:02] comes down he chewed the whole bottom of
[01:23:05] it and the glass fell
[01:23:07] [Laughter]
[01:23:11] out my dog we think he was a um we think
[01:23:15] he was a mix of a pull because he chewed
[01:23:17] through a um a metal fence
[01:23:20] too so that's why we think he may have
[01:23:22] been he might have been a pit bull mix
[01:23:24] because he chewed through a a metal
[01:23:26] fence we used to put him in a um we had
[01:23:27] a 10 by10 kennel we put out back in the
[01:23:29] yard like you know what we'll put him in
[01:23:31] there chewed through the fence got out
[01:23:34] all right well that's weird I don't
[01:23:35] think it I didn't know a dog could do
[01:23:37] that literally chewed the fence and
[01:23:39] scrunched all the pieces
[01:23:40] up tight so that he could crawl out I'm
[01:23:44] like you you [ __ ] me metal fence
[01:23:47] metal fence yep so he got stuff and
[01:23:50] wrapped around it well then he pulled
[01:23:51] the door back and he bent the door so
[01:23:53] like all right so we put a chain so he
[01:23:55] could get around everywhere but not
[01:23:56] touch the
[01:23:57] door then he bent some of the other
[01:24:00] chain to get out the other area oh my
[01:24:01] God so we got rid of it and put a collar
[01:24:03] on him that was pretty good for the most

[01:25:49] end up doing this at the end of the show
[01:25:51] I'll end up giving this away at the end
[01:25:52] of the show here for those of you that
[01:25:54] are hanging
[01:25:56] out so and like the interface Works
[01:25:58] clean too and I can use other stuff with
[01:26:01] it and it doesn't freeze which is very
[01:26:03] nice we had the POG flip out no one was
[01:26:06] doing that so I adjusted
[01:26:09] uh no one was doing that POG flip which
[01:26:11] is
[01:26:12] okay I'll put the characters
[01:26:21] away yeah I had a we had a rough week
[01:26:23] Mike Marcel's here actually made a big
[01:26:26] decision you know I've talked about I
[01:26:28] don't know if you've heard me talk about
[01:26:29] before like I'm going to end up um we
[01:26:31] want to sell our stuff like want to move
[01:26:32] on a boat at some point well um my wife
[01:26:35] something happened to her job made her
[01:26:37] unhappy so we're deciding to uh do that
[01:26:39] a little earlier we're going to end up
[01:26:42] um talk to a
[01:26:44] realtor we already had been talking to
[01:26:46] one because seeing how much our house
[01:26:47] was worth now we're going to be able to
[01:26:50] sell our house we'll buy a boat out cash
[01:26:54] for the ones that we're looking at will
[01:26:56] be pretty nice about 48 almost 50 feet
[01:27:00] so we'll sell that buy a boat and we're
[01:27:03] going to travel around on that travel
[01:27:05] around uh we'll be like Caribbean
[01:27:06] Bahamas for a while learning learning
[01:27:08] the boat and traveling
[01:27:09] sailing um and then what we'll end up
[01:27:12] doing is uh my wife can work remotely
[01:27:14] potentially finding some nursing stuff I
[01:27:16] have my remote job that I've been doing
[01:27:18] for years so I'll do that for a little
[01:27:21] bit maybe see if I can do it part-time
[01:27:24] but the other thing I was thinking is
[01:27:25] I'm GNA people keep saying they like my
[01:27:27] adventure game a lot Mike so I was going
[01:27:29] to do um I've been looking into uh roll
[01:27:32] 20 to do some D and D Adventures where
[01:27:36] I'm like the dungeon master but we'll do
[01:27:38] it kind of as the uh as the magic games
[01:27:41] and packs here and that way when I'm on
[01:27:43] the boat I don't need to have a large
[01:27:45] inventory of everything it'll be like
[01:27:47] you know a pull box that's set up for
[01:27:50] just the adventure game so as the game
[01:27:52] goes it'll be like you choose certain
[01:27:54] things and that's how your strength
[01:27:55] comes and stuff like that is kind of
[01:27:57] what I was figuring and that's how I
[01:27:59] would play I was thinking I'm going to
[01:28:00] do something like that and like we can
[01:28:02] even roll dice and everything CU it
[01:28:04] doesn't matter the dice are going to say
[01:28:05] how much strength or what you're going
[01:28:06] to hit on the character type of thing so
[01:28:09] I was thinking stuff like that and uh I
[01:28:11] was looking at doing uh roll 20 because
[01:28:13] I can do it virtually even with that so
[01:28:15] now and I can add from my I'm looking at
[01:28:17] it looks like I can even add my
[01:28:18] animations in to have them come up at
[01:28:20] certain times so I've been playing with
[01:28:23] it a little bit and I just started
[01:28:24] looking at it yesterday so that is
[01:28:26] something I'm treking out here now maybe
[01:28:27] you know I'm thinking it might be
[01:28:29] something that way I don't need to have
[01:28:30] this giant inventory of stuff that I
[01:28:33] have that I normally have I can have a
[01:28:35] smaller inventory of everything and um
[01:28:38] you know have
[01:28:39] only have only um you know enough packs
[01:28:43] and singles that I can do the shows and
[01:28:45] that way when I get back to the US on
[01:28:47] land I ship everything
[01:28:50] out I know I thought that might be a
[01:28:53] good idea kind of a fun thing try
[01:28:59] out but because everybody says like I do
[01:29:02] a good job with the story The the
[01:29:03] adventure whatever so I figured might as
[01:29:05] well
[01:29:06] um elaborate and capitalize on it as
[01:29:09] much as I can then hey maybe I'll be
[01:29:11] lucky and people want to pay me to do it
[01:29:13] type thing I guess people pay people to
[01:29:15] do that and if they do that'd be pretty
[01:29:17] sweet it'll help me travel
[01:29:20] around yeah exactly I don't want to do
[01:29:22] I'm done I haven't wanted to um I don't
[01:29:25] really even want to do neide this I'd
[01:29:26] rather just not have quite frankly
[01:29:29] there's a company I worked for I worked
[01:29:30] overnight for a couple years doing uh
[01:29:34] some it stuff for a a company that did
[01:29:36] um stock trading stuff and I got stock
[01:29:38] in that company that's a private company
[01:29:40] so when it sells hopefully get a large
[01:29:42] chunk of money we were hoping five years
[01:29:45] which was like this last year but it
[01:29:46] didn't so maybe this year but if it does
[01:29:49] if we're lucky enough we we can buy that
[01:29:51] boat and we won't even need to do
[01:29:52] anything we'll just have enough Mone
[01:29:54] money that we can travel but if we don't
[01:29:56] and if even if we don't we can still
[01:29:58] play and have fun cuz I like doing this
[01:29:59] stuff anyways it's entertaining to me I
[01:30:02] have fun when I'm bored this is like
[01:30:03] something to do that we can have a good
[01:30:04] time I can tell stories whatever you
[01:30:07] know even if no one does it [ __ ] it I'm
[01:30:12] still doing stuff and having
[01:30:14] fun and hopefully with the uh working on
[01:30:17] the other job like I said hopefully they
[01:30:20] don't mind that I'm
[01:30:21] traveling because I'll have Lincoln
[01:30:24] everything I'll still be able to do like
[01:30:26] live and if this picks up and works then
[01:30:28] I can move over to
[01:30:30] this now we're going to do something
[01:30:32] different for everybody I'm going to
[01:30:34] make this pack two strength instead of
[01:30:39] one that's what I'm going to do two
[01:30:42] strength instead of
[01:30:50] one cuz it's a Japanese ioria that's why
[01:30:54] had to travel so far to get here that
[01:30:57] it's a little bit stronger than the rest
[01:31:00] of the packs around all
[01:31:03] right A Little Bit Stronger than the
[01:31:05] rest of them around
[01:31:09] here hands damn my
[01:31:12] pants
[01:31:14] songs now my my audio changes for some
[01:31:17] reason please let me know it randomly
[01:31:18] switches every now and again but yeah I
[01:31:21] figured why not try to have some fun
[01:31:26] all right no one wants that no one wants
[01:31:28] that let's do a
[01:31:31] um do reward boxes again we'll call a
[01:31:34] flash sale
[01:31:36] three
[01:31:40] 32 there you
[01:31:42] go got a few things running yeah I love
[01:31:45] how this works because I can have
[01:31:46] multiple things
[01:31:47] going you know yeah I like
[01:31:51] it I like it
[01:31:54] hey I do appreciate you coming over and
[01:31:56] hanging out for a little while
[01:31:57] Mike and I'm I am very sorry about what
[01:32:00] happened with you and your
[01:32:03] family um that's one of those things at
[01:32:06] least with
[01:32:11] um yeah one of the things I love to say
[01:32:15] with that is that
[01:32:16] um it helps children learn that makes
[01:32:20] any sense help children learn about
[01:32:22] things that is going to happen in life
[01:32:24] that they're going to have a hard time
[01:32:27] with so that being
[01:32:30] said we uh yeah whatever that
[01:32:35] that yeah exactly so it helps him learn
[01:32:37] a little bit life like life happens
[01:32:39] these things happen like I had a ferret
[01:32:42] I it was I had two ferrets they but they
[01:32:45] I guess they get cancer very easily and
[01:32:46] we didn't know that when we had them
[01:32:47] when we were younger and when we got it
[01:32:49] somebody we had a we had to when they
[01:32:51] were older they C cancer and we had to
[01:32:52] kill them put them down cuz they were
[01:32:54] one night literally woke up and they
[01:32:55] were crying in the middle of the night
[01:32:57] so like you have to learn over these
[01:32:58] things over years so that's one of those
[01:33:01] things over the years as a child you
[01:33:02] learn and that's why I like having a pet
[01:33:05] helps even though people don't realize
[01:33:07] it there's many different ways having a
[01:33:09] pet helps responsibility with taking
[01:33:12] care of it showing care to take care of
[01:33:14] it so the pet doesn't harm you because
[01:33:16] you're being mean you have to be so like
[01:33:18] you have to be like a good person in a
[01:33:20] way you know what I mean like if you
[01:33:21] have a dog it's hard to be a bad person
[01:33:24] if you have a
[01:33:25] dog that make

[01:37:42] luck we'll see what happens with the
[01:37:43] rest let's get you a name on this Mike
[01:37:55] there we go put that over
[01:37:59] here and there you go yeah so the other
[01:38:01] one somebody uh yeah you know what
[01:38:03] happened there nothing h no no response
[01:38:05] from anything so I'm pretty sure I'm
[01:38:06] black
[01:38:15] balled thank you that's the one issue
[01:38:18] that I keep having here is audio
[01:38:19] switches for some reason the audio input
[01:38:22] switches I should be able to like lock
[01:38:23] it to it and for some reason it keeps
[01:38:26] switching automatically on
[01:38:27] me OB no this is not OBS this is um I'm
[01:38:31] actually the input is coming
[01:38:34] from my camera here which is being what
[01:38:36] selected to sound through the their
[01:38:40] options but for whatever reason it
[01:38:42] randomly switches and it doesn't show
[01:38:43] there's any S I think it's because their
[01:38:46] thing doesn't recognize sound being used
[01:38:47] on it
[01:38:49] so I think after a while it switches
[01:38:52] thinking I'm not doing anything
[01:38:55] I don't know maybe I get this together I
[01:38:58] forgot to put that in there for you Mike
[01:38:59] you're POG you get that always with it
[01:39:02] too there we go put that back put that
[01:39:06] over here for those of you that may want
[01:39:08] it and we have one promotion running oh
[01:39:12] no let's get a mystery bag out then
[01:39:15] let's try some mystery
[01:39:20] bags do that some mystery bags
[01:39:24] we'll throw another adventure game out
[01:39:26] no one wanted the other Adventures so
[01:39:27] we'll draw another
[01:39:29] one you know what we got some luck with
[01:39:33] a cavern of souls
[01:39:35] there let's see if we can get a monoc
[01:39:37] cryp maybe yeah yeah maybe a Mana maybe
[01:39:41] a little crypy
[01:39:48] Mana you go put that that way back that
[01:39:51] way should be able to see everything now
[01:40:01] go think that's good there I just made
[01:40:04] the adjustment so that we could see
[01:40:05] everything
[01:40:07] again
[01:40:14] there yeah I guess um they were
[01:40:16] switching over today I didn't know that
[01:40:18] I found that out uh
[01:40:21] myself somebody made a comment about it
[01:40:23] I was like what so I guess they made
[01:40:25] their switch over today cuz they were
[01:40:27] tired they must be tired of some stuff
[01:40:28] too well put it this way I'll say one
[01:40:30] thing um I had somebody come into my
[01:40:34] stream at one point saying MTG sick
[01:40:37] deals did some in did some stuff that
[01:40:40] doesn't sound like them like I'm like no
[01:40:43] that's not them like hey dude you need
[01:40:45] to have some video evidence or something
[01:40:46] if you're going to say this well you can
[01:40:49] go and Report whatever you want I guess
[01:40:52] and you don't need video
[01:40:53] evidence and if the other team has video
[01:40:56] evidence it doesn't even
[01:40:59] matter so I'm wondering if they've been
[01:41:01] having issues themselves and they're
[01:41:03] just like kind of screw it I'm
[01:41:05] done cuz it's ridiculous quite frankly
[01:41:09] when somebody says they the my problem
[01:41:13] was they don't know what's in the
[01:41:15] mystery
[01:41:18] bags it's literally pasted there since
[01:41:21] the mystery bags have been put out
[01:41:25] anybody ever asked they wanted to see it
[01:41:27] they go hey I can't see that that well
[01:41:29] can I see them all and this is what I do
[01:41:31] every single time here you can read it
[01:41:34] oh you can't read it still no problem
[01:41:36] let me help you with that too I do have
[01:41:38] this so you can read it and I've been
[01:41:41] doing that since the beginning not
[01:41:44] change anything it's always the same and
[01:41:48] I have video showing it live on YouTube
[01:41:50] that's
[01:41:51] saved but that doesn't matter to certain
[01:41:55] groups of
[01:42:03] people
[01:42:04] yeah like I even show it it was even
[01:42:07] listed in the uh in what it is too so
[01:42:11] that's why I'm like this stuff is
[01:42:12] ridiculous no point no point trying
[01:42:15] anymore so that's why I'm like I'm not
[01:42:17] even doing this stuff
[01:42:18] anymore I'm trying something different
[01:42:24] no I'm going to try something different
[01:42:26] here see what happens
[01:42:29] maybe maybe people will hang out with me
[01:42:32] here I don't know I suspect it won't
[01:42:34] happen as much but that's why we're
[01:42:35] doing the boat thing W work anyways
[01:42:37] because then I can change up the way I'm
[01:42:38] doing it and do like that D and D story
[01:42:40] where it's always a story we're going
[01:42:42] through every day and uh an adventure
[01:42:45] we're going through and then um people
[01:42:49] can buy in to participate in the
[01:42:50] adventure is what it would be
[01:42:53] and when you buy in you would be
[01:42:55] participating in the adventure based on
[01:42:56] whatever you buy is kind of what I was
[01:42:58] thinking oh nice cool Mike
[01:43:03] cool nice nice cool good to
[01:43:07] know yeah I'm Miss uh it's
[01:43:14] frustrating when like quite literally
[01:43:17] people can
[01:43:18] lie
[01:43:20] lie and be ignored and the person that
[01:43:22] like gets lied about I'm like [ __ ]
[01:43:25] video it's on video it's literally on

[01:43:55] some reason here you have to request a
[01:43:58] refund when somebody has an
[01:43:59] international order so unless they made
[01:44:00] a change it's a little different I'm not
[01:44:03] a fan of that personally I think it
[01:44:05] should automatically be done but uh I
[01:44:07] don't know if this changed though that
[01:44:08] was the last time I was on here about a
[01:44:10] little while back
[01:44:11] though yeah International orders aren't
[01:44:13] always
[01:44:15] easy you like have to make them do them
[01:44:18] sometimes and it's like weird the
[01:44:19] packing yeah it's a headache

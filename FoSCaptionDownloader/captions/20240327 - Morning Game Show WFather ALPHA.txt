[00:21:31] chance to look at it yet I was going to
[00:21:33] look at it Rec uh
[00:21:35] soon so lavit that's what I got there
[00:21:37] for him yeah the pogman battle idea is
[00:21:40] uh makes it's pretty much just makes
[00:21:41] getting to the um the boss a little bit
[00:21:43] quicker here everybody so the other one
[00:21:45] too is we have our our high low game
[00:21:47] which is kind of fun which um literally
[00:21:50] is just another way to get to the
[00:21:53] boss quicker which is we put out our
[00:21:56] cards and these are what I'm going to
[00:21:57] doing dollar auction on some cards here
[00:22:00] now I did see you Lait um if you're in
[00:22:03] here still I do have that many if you
[00:22:04] want to get some let me know whatever
[00:22:06] you want to get and we can do something
[00:22:08] but I'm going to do the high low game
[00:22:09] here quickly so you guys can see
[00:22:11] it high low this is how we're going to
[00:22:14] do it we start this you're going to pick
[00:22:18] one of these three cards for yourself
[00:22:20] but on the back of them is written high
[00:22:22] or low and depending on what happens is
[00:22:24] you roll the dice and if you get you
[00:22:26] could get up to three rolls and you pick
[00:22:28] the highest control of them and that's
[00:22:29] the strength you go out against the boss
[00:22:31] and if you beat one of the bosses if you
[00:22:33] can beat the boss like we do in our
[00:22:35] regular Adventure you don't need to go
[00:22:36] through these it's just the boss over
[00:22:37] there if you can beat the boss you end
[00:22:40] up having a $1 Loot drop for everybody
[00:22:41] in the Wasteland and that's the high low
[00:22:44] thing there for those that want to try
[00:22:45] it so it's a just a right here literally
[00:22:46] a dollar single is what it is a little
[00:22:48] twist on a on a dollar giveaway on a
[00:22:51] dollar single I mean is what that is and
[00:22:53] we're going to do this for 30 seconds
[00:22:55] here you have mutational advantage colel
[00:22:59] Autumn or junk toown whichever one of
[00:23:01] those you want then you do the high low
[00:23:04] on top of it where we uh roll the dice
[00:23:06] you beats a b and if you're able to beat
[00:23:07] the boss which is our uh our boss is
[00:23:11] here all right if you're able to beat
[00:23:12] one of those still we use our we use our
[00:23:14] characters here if you able to be one of
[00:23:16] those bses you can uh come out on top
[00:23:20] with a uh putting a dollar uh loot pack
[00:23:24] down and that's how we do that
[00:23:27] one there right we'll put those
[00:23:30] back there the wanted poster showcase

[00:23:41] should be really good on that I like
[00:23:43] that a lot myself so uh we'll put up um
[00:23:46] you know what we'll do we'll put up
[00:23:48] another adventure game here while I find
[00:23:51] yeah actually you know what let's do
[00:23:52] this I'm going to put this up quickly
[00:23:55] the flip for for a second well I uh I
[00:23:58] find a packs to put up for the adventure
[00:24:00] game or do you want to do the pogman
[00:24:03] game should we do the pogman game try it
[00:24:06] out one of these times do some packs on
[00:24:09] pogman
[00:24:10] game so what we'll do with the packs on
[00:24:13] the pogman game is like
[00:24:17] this we're going to do this here for the
[00:24:20] packs of the pogman game we'll give
[00:24:25] you I'm going to put those right over
[00:24:27] here cuz we the bosses and everything
[00:24:29] are going to put that right there all
[00:24:32] right know if anybody wants to do the
[00:24:34] POG clip it's literally like a box a
[00:24:35] pull box you just flip it over says what
[00:24:37] it is on the back currently on that
[00:24:39] we've had pulled out are ioria Booster
[00:24:41] LCI draft ioria booster and an LCI draft
[00:24:44] so that means your odds are definitely
[00:24:45] better for everything else that are in
[00:24:46] there um so there you go but we'll do
[00:24:49] that one for
[00:24:50] you you said you like that idea this is
[00:24:53] my wife's idea we were just using these
[00:24:55] as um like the the options for that and
[00:24:57] I'm going to throw up a give way here
[00:24:59] again coming up I think I might do a um
[00:25:02] you know what maybe I'll do one of these
[00:25:03] ones from over here maybe I'll do one of
[00:25:05] these ones here I think these are
[00:25:10] um that's what I'll do let's put
[00:25:13] up let's put up a a foil Nick andzel
[00:25:17] current conductor
[00:25:21] in
[00:25:25] and where other one
[00:25:29] where's the other
[00:25:38] one where where was
[00:25:42] the hold on
[00:25:47] uh yeah whatever we'll put up that we'll
[00:25:50] put up petition petitioners I didn't
[00:25:52] have that's not the right ones that I
[00:25:53] wanted I thought I had different ones in
[00:25:54] that area but I'll have to check again
[00:25:55] in that area that's not the area that I
[00:25:57] thought was there
[00:25:58] we'll those ones up for here
[00:26:01] say please do and I might add something
[00:26:03] else to that when I find if I have a
[00:26:05] minute here to find something better
[00:26:07] we're going to put up the uh the battle
[00:26:09] here that way we can
[00:26:11] um try that one out that was my wife's
[00:26:14] idea I like putting the of these right
[00:26:16] here that way you can see them at all
[00:26:17] times you see where they are they never
[00:26:19] change they never move those are the
[00:26:21] ones that were already flipped over this
[00:26:23] is going to go up here you're going to
[00:26:24] get two we're going to call that two for
[00:26:27] that since nobody wanted do it all
[00:26:30] right then we are going to put these
[00:26:33] here for your
[00:26:36] pogs and I was told I needed to move
[00:26:39] this out of the way because it doesn't
[00:26:41] work CU it's shite so I'm going to move
[00:26:43] that out of the way but my point is that
[00:26:45] that some point I'm going to use that
[00:26:46] and we'll uh we'll get your names
[00:26:47] written down on that at some point I was
[00:26:49] thinking for some reason there's our POG
[00:26:50] thing there we're going to put our POG
[00:26:52] man battle up all right and we're going
[00:26:54] to do this is going to go up here
[00:26:57] for
[00:27:03] this here start
[00:27:06] that if you want those two packs there
[00:27:08] you go we'll do a little battle here and
[00:27:11] we'll see what happens how many how many
[00:27:13] flip over you get two slams and
[00:27:15] depending on how many flip overs how
[00:27:17] much uh strength you have to go against
[00:27:19] the
[00:27:20] boss and if I'm horrible at it I'll take
[00:27:22] another attempt at it too that's what
[00:27:24] I'll
[00:27:26] do now remember you guys can tell me
[00:27:29] what you want for cards packs up there I
[00:27:31] don't need to keep putting them up here
[00:27:32] I keep putting up the random things that
[00:27:34] everybody's looking uh that I just keep
[00:27:36] grabbing so yeah this is my wife's idea
[00:27:38] here so we'll see if this works I'm
[00:27:40] horrible I've not done this in I've done
[00:27:42] this yesterday was the first time I
[00:27:44] attempted this in 30 years so um yeah
[00:27:48] there's your other thing there so let's
[00:27:49] see when if no one wants those packs
[00:27:51] maybe we'll do this one

[00:28:31] say goodbye to everyone in the family
[00:28:32] well I started this mainly because um
[00:28:35] will wanted to open packs online um and
[00:28:39] I'm like I cannot afford to do that and
[00:28:41] um so I tried to figure out way and the
[00:28:45] way that we figured out to was be able
[00:28:46] to do this that way we can afford to put
[00:28:48] on the um that way we can afford to put
[00:28:51] on YouTube and do our YouTube videos at
[00:28:55] you know we take some of our money that
[00:28:57] we make from this
[00:28:58] uh and we don't make a lot from it like
[00:29:00] very little and we put it towards what
[00:29:02] the few boxes that you see that get open
[00:29:04] that's really what it gets put towards
[00:29:05] to or back of the store here and then of
[00:29:07] itself so that we can have more fun
[00:29:09] opening packs here so what uh yeah
[00:29:11] that's kind of where we came about doing
[00:29:13] this in the first place because will
[00:29:15] wanted to open packs online and I was
[00:29:18] like I can't afford to do that I'm not a
[00:29:20] wealthy person so let's see what we can
[00:29:23] do for you and that's uh yeah that's how
[00:29:26] this occurred
[00:29:30] and then my wife came up with some
[00:29:31] random ideas she was the one that goes
[00:29:32] get the POG things when we saw um so the
[00:29:35] POG came around when uh she made me keep
[00:29:38] this where did I put this so we had two
[00:29:41] of these and we opened one of these for
[00:29:43] somebody and we didn't realize inside
[00:29:45] was a Pog and she got extremely excited
[00:29:47] when she saw it and was
[00:29:49] helping thank

[01:04:16] Overlord for it oh nice dude that'll be
[01:04:19] really nice so we are going to play the
[01:04:21] high low game right here so each one of
[01:04:24] these cards you get to pick any one of
[01:04:26] those cards all right the auction goes
[01:04:29] you literally get one of those cards it
[01:04:31] starts for a dollar you pick which card
[01:04:33] you want these are all generally over a
[01:04:35] dollar to $5 area sometimes if they're
[01:04:37] going to be higher I'll I'll I'll start
[01:04:38] the auction a little higher hey Jupiter
[01:04:40] how you
[01:04:41] doing so uh these ones I think are $3 to
[01:04:44] $5 right now between all these ones and
[01:04:47] we're going to do it like this where we
[01:04:48] start it for 30 seconds actually I do 20
[01:04:51] seconds on this and then what you do
[01:04:53] here is you choose your card out of them
[01:04:56] there's you get any of these three you
[01:04:58] bid and you B any of these three that
[01:05:00] you want and then afterwards on the back
[01:05:01] of one of each of these it's written
[01:05:03] high or low and depending on what's
[01:05:06] written on the back of those is if you
[01:05:08] get high if you match with high you say
[01:05:10] high you match with low it get low it's
[01:05:12] how many rolls you get and that's how
[01:05:13] much strength you get to get to go into
[01:05:15] the boss and I forgot to write high low
[01:05:16] on these hold on you can't go up there
[01:05:19] without them written down on them
[01:05:24] yet
[01:05:34] okay there we go sorry about that now
[01:05:37] these three have it written on the back
[01:05:39] there high or low and we're going to
[01:05:41] start at a dollar we do have the same
[01:05:43] Adventure game just a little bit of
[01:05:45] different on some Twist on some of other
[01:05:46] games though and that is your high low
[01:05:50] you do a dollar for the card it's a
[01:05:51] single there you choose which single you
[01:05:54] want let me pull them a little Clos
[01:05:55] closer
[01:05:56] maybe that way you can see him a little
[01:05:59] closer you choose which single you want
[01:06:03] then we Shuffle and then we roll and
[01:06:05] that's how we do it maybe you want one
[01:06:08] maybe you don't green bow coming in
[01:06:10] which single is it that you want

[01:06:27] on
[01:06:28] it I'm trying to think of a different
[01:06:30] way of doing this cuz I wanted to have
[01:06:32] like the pricing be high or low when you
[01:06:35] guess it but you can have a computer in
[01:06:36] your hand to guess it so it makes a
[01:06:38] little cheating hi got a right one there
[01:06:41] on mutational advantage that's your card
[01:06:43] I'm going to put that right there where

[01:10:40] puzzle in a bunch of games look at that
[01:10:43] a little
[01:10:44] puzzle that is actually really cool I
[01:10:47] didn't know that that was that's pretty
[01:10:48] cool if you got some kids or even you're
[01:10:51] an adult and you want to see some old
[01:10:52] stuff back in your day that is actually
[01:10:55] pretty cool there not bad nice uh that's
[01:10:58] the first time I've seen those one open
[01:11:00] that's uh my kids have not been picking
[01:11:02] those they wanted to save them for a
[01:11:03] Disney show and I'm like we need to get
[01:11:04] rid of them so they picked all of them
[01:11:06] now but there you go that wasn't bad
[01:11:09] there you go you beat the boss you beat
[01:11:12] the boss let's put up our giveaway here
[01:11:14] and we're going to run another one of
[01:11:15] our uh adventure games all
[01:11:19] right you didn't beat the boss but
[01:11:22] that's
[01:11:24] okay
[01:11:25] we're going to run through that
[01:11:28] there I do not have anything that's
[01:11:30] Little Mermaid I do not know but what
[01:11:33] I'm going to do now we'll do another one
[01:11:35] of um here let's do this actually we'll
[01:11:39] do
[01:11:40] this it's the same thing as the other
[01:11:43] games the the only difference is you get
[01:11:45] to it a little bit quicker with the
[01:11:46] pogman
[01:11:48] battle that's really the big
[01:11:50] difference I don't know if anybody's
[01:11:52] want to want to do that but that'll get
[01:11:53] you three of your uh three attemp temps
[01:11:55] of the slams where you can get up to
[01:11:56] seven strength is the highest you can go
[01:11:58] to fight the bosses where you do the $1
[01:12:01] Loot drop and you always get your free
[01:12:02] pack of Vault pack up here too that's
[01:12:04] just an always a given to you whenever
[01:12:06] you play any of your games here cuz we
[01:12:08] like to have fun and play games and it's
[01:12:10] just a little extra every time you
[01:12:11] purchase from us with a c you know that
[01:12:13] type of thing
[01:12:15] there we're going to put these ones up
[01:12:18] here for and if somebody wants one
[01:12:21] specifically you can tell me
[01:12:24] too
[01:12:26] how do you beat the boss you have to
[01:12:28] have higher than the strength of the
[01:12:30] boss when it comes up to it so for
[01:12:36] instance you have three stra if you had
[01:12:40] this six you would have had three
[01:12:41] strength to beat it you would have two
[01:12:43] strength to beat Owen you don't have 10
[01:12:45] strength to beat there you don't have
[01:12:47] seven to beat that you could beat it
[01:12:48] with Mary could beat Sauron you could
[01:12:52] tie
[01:12:53] Sauron you could tie t Rex you can tie
[01:12:56] the incinerator and you're going to get
[01:12:59] beaten by The Watcher so when you do
[01:13:00] this singles one there's only you can
[01:13:02] only beat a few of them and you can tie
[01:13:03] the rest and sometimes when you tie the
[01:13:06] big bosses there is a Loot drop
[01:13:07] sometimes there's not it really depends
[01:13:09] on how I'm feeling for the day I don't
[01:13:10] know maybe we do loot drops a lot more
[01:13:12] than normal because uh we have a lot of
[01:13:14] people in here and we're going to do a
[01:13:15] lot more loot drops I don't know maybe
[01:13:17] that's what we do or maybe it's because
[01:13:19] we've had a lot of sales and we I'm
[01:13:21] comfortable enough going through and
[01:13:22] doing a bunch of them but let's let's
[01:13:25] see if people want to jump in on
[01:13:26] anything here and try their luck on
[01:13:28] anything
[01:13:29] else we're going to put another one in
[01:13:31] there and remember
[01:13:33] everybody any longer Foundry Foundry yes
[01:13:38] they're going to
[01:13:42] be in here this
[01:13:46] area let's look for our singles I got
[01:13:48] some singles here we can I'm just going
[01:13:49] to go through some of these right now
[01:13:50] why
[01:13:54] not oh there's my rampaging fero on
[01:13:56] somebody was looking for the other day I
[01:13:58] found
[01:13:59] it I knew I had it somewhere and I must
[01:14:02] have skipped over that like four times
[01:14:03] when I was looking at for it oh my God I
[01:14:06] hate that I know I skipped over that
[01:14:09] four times now when I was looking at
[01:14:15] that now these prices are probably not
[01:14:17] accurate because I put them on there a
[01:14:18] long time ago but uh we'll check him on
[01:14:21] on um
[01:14:24] TCG
[01:14:25] all right those are not there you are
[01:14:29] looking Foundry could be in another spot
[01:14:35] too could be
[01:14:42] here could be
[01:14:48] here no it's not in those ones those are
[01:14:50] the cheaper ones not in
[01:14:53] there now if you want anything you
[01:14:56] see um I have potentially one coming
[01:15:02] in I'm questioning whether they're going
[01:15:05] to am I actually going to get it it was
[01:15:06] one of the ones that I ordered a long
[01:15:07] time ago it marked as shipped it was an
[01:15:11] individual one that I ordered from
[01:15:12] somewhere so with it being marked as
[01:15:14] shipped I'm hoping it actually did ship
[01:15:17] and they were just waiting for like
[01:15:19] something to show up maybe I don't
[01:15:23] know but
[01:15:26] anyways I might have one more Fallout
[01:15:29] coming
[01:15:31] in might have one more Fallout coming in
[01:15:34] let me see if I have a Foundry anywhere
[01:15:40] else oil
[01:15:43] one let me check on this
[01:15:46] here it's going to be in these
[01:15:50] areas Ka cyclonic Rift got a cyclonic
[01:15:53] Rift there deflecting swats smothering
[01:15:55] tithe Vault
[01:15:57] no it's rigas the brown come here no
[01:16:04] nope I have so many cards that I don't
[01:16:06] know where they are and that's the
[01:16:08] problem I had them organized and I
[01:16:09] started doing singles and then I got so
[01:16:12] freaking disorganized from doing
[01:16:21] singles okay oh I know where I might
[01:16:24] have put it
[01:16:25] shoot hold on hold on I think I know why

[01:16:31] it who came out with a win there

[01:16:50] minute going to add you to your bag
[01:16:53] here and and all right so my guess it's
[01:16:56] in here this is the big blue book by the
[01:16:59] way so what I'm actually going to do I'm
[01:17:00] going to pin the big blue

[01:17:05] actually you know what I'm going to run
[01:17:06] it out for a little bit less so you can
[01:17:08] see it while I'm looking for this card
[01:17:10] which I think isn't here by the way I
[01:17:11] think the card's in here and that's why
[01:17:13] I'm running into this problem all right
[01:17:16] here we
[01:17:21] go think it's over here I think it's on

[01:23:32] around sometimes you get a little
[01:23:35] um you get a little distracted at
[01:23:39] times and you don't always get
[01:23:41] everything done because they're uh
[01:23:42] they're here until later than normal
[01:23:44] which is I like actually it's just I get

[01:24:30] that I'm doing so like I'm normally
[01:24:32] ready and I have all things set up and
[01:24:34] some of the times I'm not having that
[01:24:35] because I'm just I'm just backed up

[01:24:38] it I love having the kids here I
[01:24:40] actually would prefer having them here

[01:47:14] that we're going to put out H we're
[01:47:17] going to put out people like these we
[01:47:19] going to put out
[01:47:21] this with these two actually we're just
[01:47:23] going to put out these two here all
[01:47:25] right we going to put out those
[01:47:27] two and we're going to put out a pogman
[01:47:30] battle you asked about what this is my
[01:47:32] wife decided this one was a good idea I
[01:47:34] don't know about this you I I haven't
[01:47:36] done this in 30 years so you get to make
[01:47:38] fun of me for a little while so what
[01:47:40] this is is you get these
[01:47:43] cards all right you get these packs here
[01:47:46] but it is a little game where we do the
[01:47:47] battle against the boss so the way that
[01:47:49] we battle against the boss though is my
[01:47:50] wife said that I should have the pogs
[01:47:52] here and you can have up to seven
[01:47:54] strength to go against the bosses here
[01:47:56] and if you beat one of the bosses we do
[01:47:57] a $1 Loot drop in the Wasteland and
[01:48:00] those are generally a pack of cards that
[01:48:02] could be anything from Wild drain draft
[01:48:05] an ioria booster to depending on how
[01:48:07] many sales we have for the day maybe I
[01:48:09] throw out one of the ion collector
[01:48:10] boosters or something like that but
[01:48:12] that's what it is how we do our our
[01:48:14] thing there and yes we um we found some
[01:48:17] so the why we have them is because I had
[01:48:20] those Vault packs that I bought and one
[01:48:22] of them happened to be one of these we
[01:48:23] have two of them and I kept the other
[01:48:25] one cuz we didn't realize the first one
[01:48:26] when we opened it had a Pog in it and my
[01:48:28] wife got all excited like you need to
[01:48:30] get those and use those in the game
[01:48:31] that'll be fun so that's why we're doing
[01:48:34] our little game here is uh I'm going to
[01:48:36] attempt to slam this down here see how
[01:48:38] good luck my luck is here we're going to
[01:48:40] flip over how many car how many of these
[01:48:42] get flipped over is up to seven of them
[01:48:44] and that's the strength you can get to
[01:48:46] go against your boss if you beat one of
[01:48:48] the bosses which is uh you actually have
[01:48:50] the chance of beating six of the seven
[01:48:51] bosses the 10 bosses here um that will
[01:48:55] allow you to have a $1 Loot drop in the
[01:48:58] Wasteland but that's your pack thing
[01:48:59] there click clack is going to try it out
[01:49:01] all right click clack do some ioria here

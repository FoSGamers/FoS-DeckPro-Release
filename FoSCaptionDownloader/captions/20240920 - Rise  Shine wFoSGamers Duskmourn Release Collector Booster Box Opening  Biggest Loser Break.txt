[00:31:22] loaders and
[00:31:24] sleeves we get those and sleeves I knew
[00:31:27] I missed something
[00:31:30] and if there's any of them like I
[00:31:36] said they don't expire until the end of
[00:31:39] the
[00:31:40] season that's the only time they'll ever
[00:31:42] expires the end of the
[00:31:44] season and at the end of the season when
[00:31:46] they expire they I think when they
[00:31:48] expire you actually end up having two
[00:31:50] days right before the end of the season
[00:31:52] for them to expire so if you want to
[00:31:53] like save them up to use them you can do

[03:24:16] these in a top loader but those are good
[03:24:18] looking cards right there so
[03:24:20] far I think uh I think the roller
[03:24:23] coaster was up there but I can't
[03:24:25] remember or maybe it was one of the
[03:24:27] other ones that was up there that was
[03:24:28] like that I can't remember they're so
[03:24:30] hard oh so it was close I'll throw it in
[03:24:32] one anyways nine I thought it was close
[03:24:35] all right so it's nine so it's going in
[03:24:37] there for nine because we're gonna have
[03:24:39] that all right foil the to roller
[03:24:41] coaster and I'm going to put ancient I
[03:24:43] think ancient might have been near it to

[03:24:48] that might have I might be completely
[03:24:49] wrong on Ancient I might be thinking of

[04:15:15] go everybody's stuff is out and we will
[04:15:18] hand
[04:15:19] out the rest
[04:15:22] now you should all be able to see
[04:15:25] that if you can't see everything you
[04:15:27] might just need to slide your screen
[04:15:30] over oh that was bad that that was not a
[04:15:33] good that was definitely bad pun I did
[04:15:34] Chuck you did hear me grown like oh wow
[04:16:09] righty you got any good plans for
[04:16:11] tonight you going to play any uh pre
[04:16:12] pre-release or anything like
[04:16:16] that I was debating on going myself to
[04:16:19] pre-release I just haven't uh I don't
[04:16:22] know I haven't decided if I was going to
[04:16:23] or not because I think it's like s to
[04:16:26] see the problem is it's always so late
[04:16:28] if I do pre-release there's no way I'm
[04:16:30] going to be getting back here and doing
[04:16:31] anything in a
[04:16:33] morning that makes any
[04:16:41] sense it's like I need to wait for the
[04:16:44] Saturday one so I can do the Saturday
[04:16:46] one since it'll be like a nighttime one
[04:16:48] like a day one like at five o'clock or
[04:16:50] something like that I think they do it
[04:16:52] so that way I'm not up until
[04:16:54] midnight think that's like the old
[04:16:55] person's one well the people that have
[04:16:58] to work one Whatever to whatever you
[04:17:00] want to call
[04:17:10] it what do you think of the did you get
[04:17:13] a little bit of fix so far though uh
[04:17:16] zombie at least while we open some
[04:17:18] things
[04:17:25] here there's two I thought there was two
[04:17:28] in
[04:17:39] that no one doing pre-release tonight oh
[04:17:42] all right all right well I guess uh
[04:17:44] maybe I'm not alone on that being too
[04:17:48] late I think they normally do it at 7
[04:17:50] but by the time they're always ready and
[04:17:52] you start it's like 7:15 someone's
[04:17:55] always late and they go let's wait for
[04:17:56] this person like all right then we end
[04:17:58] up waiting then we don't start till 7:30
[04:18:01] because I I need to take some time to
[04:18:02] get their their mat set up and
[04:18:05] everything else
[04:18:07] so then it's like by the time you're

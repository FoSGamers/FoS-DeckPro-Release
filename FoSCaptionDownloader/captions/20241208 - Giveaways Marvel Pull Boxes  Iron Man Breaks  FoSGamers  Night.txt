[00:35:36] anybody wants to try
[00:35:39] it you going to sell the AR that you had
[00:35:42] the second one because it seemed like
[00:35:43] you were going to do that earlier so

[00:38:21] we're going to be leaving on

[00:40:00] there you go on the
[00:40:05] tasa all right looking to offload
[00:40:07] something I don't know I might be able
[00:40:08] to help you with offloading some things
[00:40:10] we definitely have uh Health ammo we
[00:40:13] definitely have some health and ammo
[00:40:14] available what kind of ammo are you
[00:40:16] looking for though exactly cuz that
[00:40:18] might be the issue that's the only issue
[00:40:20] we don't have a lot of um don't have a
[00:40:24] lot of all of the ammo we we sold out
[00:40:26] recently to but uh guy came running
[00:40:28] through here and jacked the store up and
[00:40:31] so why I had to put a new security codes
[00:40:34] in AR ammo all right AR ammo just one
[00:40:37] just we can do some AR ammo all right we
[00:40:40] can do that a little
[00:40:45] bit no you can try but uh I'm going to
[00:40:48] let you know uh never works out well for
[00:40:52] you guys when when you try to uh Rob one
[00:40:55] of the shop owners now never ends up
[00:40:57] well or maybe some projectiles you can

[00:41:24] one just one all right all right here
[00:41:27] you go you did you just
[00:41:29] one and yeah all right I think we can do
[00:41:33] that we can do uh for the assault rifle
[00:41:35] I will give you um 15 pogs which would
[00:41:39] equal um five for one 12 health pack and

[00:41:49] assault rifle ammo how's that
[00:41:52] sound and nice on unlocking the bronze

[00:51:19] what are you going to try to do here all
[00:51:22] right you all have your weapons let's
[00:51:25] get our our patented rolling box out
[00:51:28] which is just literally me made a

[00:51:37] pew all right hey hey dibs on the dill I
[00:51:40] like it you can try some of that stuff
[00:51:42] yes and you can definitely sword to the
[00:51:44] Raider all right now which one I which
[00:51:46] dice should we use this one was doing
[00:51:49] pretty good earlier
[00:51:50] today and it should stay with this
[00:51:54] one all right black black one all right
[00:51:57] let's do the black one stick with it and
[00:51:59] the all right we're know the black one
[00:52:00] it is here we go all right we're going

[00:52:21] his sword and oh he gets 14 oh where
[00:52:25] where the sword go he gets
[00:52:27] 14 which is good because you get a plus

[01:00:53] ready to charge you have to make a
[01:00:55] decision
[01:00:58] you go to the left of Archer I like it
[01:01:00] you go to the left of Archer you take a
[01:01:02] shot and you get nine plus 8 oh

[01:01:13] 17 that's not enough he miss it you miss
[01:01:16] but the gator dowo comes charging
[01:01:19] towards you instead H well look at that
[01:01:23] the gator TR D charges towards you over
[01:01:26] down that corner uh you're standing
[01:01:28] behind it in uh down the wall there the
[01:01:31] red quarter there and you're gonna fire
[01:01:33] again all right here's your last rounds
[01:01:36] he's charging toward you and he oh you
[01:01:40] don't get the shot off you don't get the
[01:01:42] shot off before he hits you just one he
[01:01:45] hits you and he knocks you down and he
[01:01:47] knocks you from your 85 Health down to
[01:01:50] 70 Health oh no but we're almost done
[01:01:54] making the bomb in the back back ground
[01:01:59] there ooh archers stinking up there all
[01:02:04] right he goes to the small
[01:02:06] Raider goes over that small Raider and
[01:02:08] he goes hey
[01:02:09] buddy that was a big hit he took you
[01:02:11] down buddy he took you down but luckily
[01:02:16] you have 15 Health a 20 health and a 10
[01:02:18] health pack so hey he took you down
[01:02:21] you're on the ground though hey your
[01:02:22] buddy there goes hey he goes and sixes
[01:02:24] the body the bomb over there underneath
[01:02:27] that small Raiders body that he made now
[01:02:30] guys this is the first time we've done
[01:02:32] one of these type of ones so I think
[01:02:33] we're going to have to have a a luck
[01:02:36] roll to see to make sure it works
[01:02:38] correctly all
[01:02:41] right now the luck
[01:02:43] roll let's
[01:02:46] see say it's a 50/50 I say it will be a
[01:02:49] luck roll to see if it works if he takes
[01:02:51] the body I think that's what we're gonna
[01:02:53] do all right we're gonna do a 50/50 so
[01:02:55] you have to have
[01:02:57] yes yes have to have over half so that
[01:02:59] means you're going have to have 11 or
[01:03:01] higher 11 or higher yeah coin flip
[01:03:04] essential
[01:03:05] correct ready here we go or 10 or higher
[01:03:09] no 11 or higher 11 or higher
[01:03:12] exactly oh no
[01:03:17] buddy
[01:03:19] no he goes and he sniffs around that
[01:03:22] he's like gator Dow sniffing around that
[01:03:25] thing like what is
[01:03:27] this knocks the body around a little bit
[01:03:30] he doesn't bite at it
[01:03:33] but did you say you were going to go
[01:03:35] swing your sword kamakazi style Adam so
[01:03:39] you go towards him to swing your sword
[01:03:41] kamakazi
[01:03:43] style that's a
[01:03:46] plus six because of the Sword and the
[01:03:49] strength you
[01:03:50] have and oh

[01:04:15] see what extra you get o you get extra
[01:04:18] on top of it so that hits him that
[01:04:21] knocks him down to 37 and then you dodge

[01:08:16] bomb status is it is not working well
[01:08:18] right now um we're guessing that Archer

[01:08:23] fact that he hit it a couple times and
[01:08:24] it didn't go off off that's what we're
[01:08:27] kind of leaning on right now since I

[01:10:01] under the small Raider now we will say
[01:10:05] that just Swan you're you have five
[01:10:07] intelligence so maybe there's something
[01:10:09] you can do yourself before he gets back

[01:10:47] timer on it oh I like it using your
[01:10:49] intelligence it's a 50/50 again ready

[01:11:24] just one throws you on his back and
[01:11:26] kicks the small Raiders body towards the
[01:11:29] gator Dillo the gator Dillo pauses for

Search the internet and find me a 100% smell proof Ziploc bag. I need to be able to put cannabis in there and make sure there's no smell coming out whatsoever in any way, shape, or form. It needs to be bigger than a one gallon bag. Currently, for like a Ziploc bag type thing, more kind of like towards a two or three gallon type thing or multiple one gallon bags.

[00:40:20] like she goes I should make a rocket
[00:40:21] raccoon deck I'm like ah intriguing I

[00:40:36] way and then having it with this set one

[03:27:00] lizards
[03:27:03] here now I can't do anything about the

[03:27:07] you have more than five
[03:27:09] cards cost a little bit there can't do
[03:27:12] anything about that but that's why I'm

[03:27:41] think these are randoms not too many of
[03:27:42] those ones we're going to put those over
[03:27:44] there vehicle probably is more of a
[03:27:46] random
[03:27:49] too crab is probably more of a random
[03:27:53] also these are the main ones probably
[03:27:56] right there no one wanted any of those
[03:27:58] so we'll throw out some other stuff here
[03:28:02] after now remember participate in the
[03:28:04] game hang out with us have some fun run

[03:39:11] what it said on
[03:39:13] screen like what did I what is wrong
[03:39:15] with this that
[03:39:17] um like what happened problematic like I
[03:39:20] sent something to the whatnot and
[03:39:21] they're like oh it's you can't have
[03:39:23] there we don't have a problem with
[03:39:24] reviews I'm like no there not that
[03:39:25] there's a problem review they lied they
[03:39:27] got exactly what they said they were
[03:39:28] getting but they complained about what
[03:39:30] they got what they got as a giveaway
[03:39:32] like I'm sorry we're not gonna do
[03:39:33] anything about it like you guys are not
[03:39:36] being nice
[03:39:37] recently they're letting anything pretty
[03:39:39] much I like I think people are starting
[03:39:41] to get the upper hand and they're going
[03:39:43] to do whatever the people say now which
[03:39:45] is actually kind of [ __ ] because
[03:39:46] it's going to start making a lot of
[03:39:47] people not do this as much as they
[03:39:49] expect them
[03:39:50] to that's a problem for them to handle
[03:39:53] when people
[03:39:55] stop streaming because their uh
[03:39:59] clientele
[03:40:00] are uh problematic is what we'll
[03:40:11] say oh yeah that's interesting yeah I've
[03:40:14] had that before where like I jumped in a
[03:40:15] giveaway and I happened to like forget
[03:40:17] what I was in the giveaway and I put my
[03:40:18] phone down and I had to deal with my
[03:40:19] children and I got something given to me
[03:40:21] and I can't even remember what it
[03:40:26] was but I think what I'm gonna well what
[03:40:28] it might have been too is sometimes if
[03:40:30] you weren't there to answer I've had
[03:40:32] streamers before be like hey this is you
[03:40:34] get card a or you get card B you have to
[03:40:38] tell me which one you get I'm giving you
[03:40:39] a automatically which is this this land
[03:40:42] but if you talk to us and you're here
[03:40:44] and you're saying you're here you're
[03:40:44] going to get card B which one or you
[03:40:46] could ask for card B which card B might
[03:40:48] be like a $10 card or whatever you know
[03:40:50] what I mean I know so that might have
[03:40:52] been what they were pulling there
[03:40:59] too oh that's fine like I understand
[03:41:01] that n Vol I'm not worried about
[03:41:06] it yeah I know a lot of people that I

[03:54:30] out in the YouTube lands we just open a
[03:54:32] box of bloomo and we're just kind of
[03:54:35] organizing it a little bit
[03:54:37] here into some different things you know
[03:54:40] like lands maybe like organizing
[03:54:42] actually this time I'm going to go and
[03:54:43] buy a the creature here because I know a
[03:54:46] lot of people like certain ones so I
[03:54:48] figured I'd do a stack of them at some
[03:54:50] point for people that may want
[03:54:53] them you know that type of thing get you
[03:54:57] a few while we're hanging out but I
[03:55:00] don't know it's always up to you guys
[03:55:02] and also the game is there if you want
[03:55:04] to
[03:55:05] play
[03:55:07] 150 some odd and change I think for them
[03:55:15] yeah they're not cheap for the boxes but
[03:55:17] they're not
[03:55:18] expensive they're um reasonable they're
[03:55:29] reasonable like I would um like that's
[03:55:32] why I bought them if they weren't
[03:55:33] reasonable I wouldn't even buy it from
[03:55:35] the stores so when I go to them it's
[03:55:37] like ridiculous like yeah no I'm not
[03:55:38] doing
[03:55:42] that ah
[03:55:48] oh
[03:55:50] nice AER
[03:55:55] person oh nice not bad that's pretty
[03:56:00] good yeah I could have bought them
[03:56:01] cheaper probably online but I went and
[03:56:03] went to the local store to support them
[03:56:05] because I do buy stuff from them every
[03:56:06] now and again try to support the store
[03:56:08] that I go and play at you know but it is
[03:56:11] a little bit more expensive than other
[03:56:13] places so I can't always
[03:56:16] um can't
[03:56:24] always I do my best when I can
[03:56:30] though all

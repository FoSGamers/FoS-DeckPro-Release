[00:08:24] these one aren't old these are older
[00:08:26] versions of the cars because the mystery

[00:08:30] they're coming out
[00:08:33] as Thorn bite I don't know let me check
[00:08:36] it out we can check that hold on a
[00:08:51] second let's
[00:08:55] see hold on a second let me get it over

[00:09:05] now not
[00:09:08] bad so it is uh looks like
[00:09:12] that yeah so
[00:09:14] being $7 I'd probably just throw it out
[00:09:17] for I'd probably throw it up for there
[00:09:19] for about the same
[00:09:23] wouldn't there you
[00:09:25] go 650 I'd probably throw it up for $6

[00:10:20] kind of what I'm thinking is more my

[00:24:26] recently
[00:24:31] let's see though I want to see what
[00:24:32] that's worth
[00:24:33] personally I want to see what that's
[00:24:37] worth Let's Do
[00:24:43] It soul
[00:24:46] ring why do I always do
[00:24:50] that
[00:24:53] no soul ring
[00:24:59] and we G to go
[00:25:06] with mystery booster
[00:25:10] 2 oh you guys can't see it anymore there
[00:25:12] you go not bad oh my if I had gotten the
[00:25:14] foil version of that that would have
[00:25:15] been insane guys that's a $300 card foil
[00:25:19] you see that dude wow that's a $10 one
[00:25:22] this way
[00:25:25] though yes the frame is different and it
[00:25:27] doesn't have um um so it's kind of like
[00:25:29] the the Showcase frame and it has like
[00:25:31] this question mark here in the corner
[00:25:33] which is another thing having to know
[00:25:34] that how you know what it
[00:25:39] is yes it's in a different position and
[00:25:41] stuff too that is correct that is
[00:25:45] correct let's go with that you know what
[00:25:47] I like I like this ver I like this thing
[00:25:49] I might actually be using this instead
[00:25:51] because it gives us more
[00:25:56] information and I'm able to like all of
[00:25:59] them
[00:26:02] too nice and easy to do so like see
[00:26:06] Market average so there you
[00:26:11] go I like that that's a lot easier to
[00:26:14] show I

[00:26:30] all right the water
[00:26:33] bail the list well they don't have any
[00:26:36] out for
[00:26:37] two but anyways H that's not a bad way

[00:46:11] booster here in the mini break we're
[00:46:12] going to zoom out here so you guys can
[00:46:13] see it right now DM mini break has the
[00:46:16] bundle which is nine play boosters then
[00:46:19] what we get in it next is you're going
[00:46:22] to have two dustborne play collector
[00:46:24] boosters and a collector booster Bloom
[00:46:26] bar we through in there also to add on
[00:46:29] top to see what we can get so that's
[00:46:31] those that are in there the mini break
[00:46:34] and what we'll do is um the dice that's
[00:46:35] in there will be shuffled off and um
[00:46:37] raffled off to everybody and then the
[00:46:39] other and what we'll be doing though is
[00:46:40] to you know what I'm going to do hold on
[00:46:43] we're going to do
[00:46:47] this for those of you that do not get
[00:46:50] the dice that come with it we're going
[00:46:52] to do
[00:46:53] this you all get a choice of one of the
[00:46:56] dice from our packs here for yourself
[00:47:01] instead so if you're one of the Unlucky
[00:47:03] people that do not get a
[00:47:05] dice you can pick on some of our custom
[00:47:07] ones that our a friend of ours makes and

[01:12:03] nice Marvin Art card
[01:12:11] there no I can actually co-host people
[01:12:14] all right I have an I've thought of this
[01:12:16] before all right so what if I did like a
[01:12:18] thing where we were doing our boxes or
[01:12:21] certain games and when I'm playing the
[01:12:23] games I co-host you that way you can be
[01:12:25] talking and telling me what to do what
[01:12:26] do you guys think about that for an
[01:12:28] idea if we do some of the games and I do
[01:12:31] that kind of
[01:12:33] thing yeah I'd pretty much I'd co-host
[01:12:36] you for a minute kick you out after I
[01:12:38] was done goodbye you're done you
[01:12:40] lost
[01:12:44] next I actually literally I can click on
[01:12:46] your name and it says um invite to
[01:12:49] co-host and it says only users using iOS
[01:12:52] or Android will be able to join the
[01:12:53] stream as a co-host Prett much you use
[01:12:55] your phone and it'll allow you to like

[01:12:59] talk kind
[01:13:01] of your uh front facing
[01:13:05] camera
[01:13:06] yeah so I was thinking we would do a
[01:13:09] game have that do it I'd allow you
[01:13:11] co-host on some type of the game here
[01:13:13] with me and we would uh you know whether
[01:13:15] it's picking your say you're going to do
[01:13:16] a bunch of pulls co-host and do that
[01:13:18] type of thing or maybe we're going to do
[01:13:20] uh you know one of our kind of adventure
[01:13:21] games that we've done you know you play
[01:13:23] that jump on and you co-host with it it

[01:14:07] check if you all don't
[01:14:10] mind yeah let me know if you like that
[01:14:12] idea of um doing
[01:14:13] the doing the uh co-hosting games we'll
[01:14:17] play some games together we'll get I'll
[01:14:19] get some of my original games that I had
[01:14:20] back out you guys can jump in and
[01:14:23] participate in them decide where you
[01:14:24] want to go as your character or uh maybe
[01:14:27] we can even do um you know what I'm
[01:14:29] going to do
[01:14:31] actually I had a game that I did a while
[01:14:34] back I called it um the wheel of
[01:14:38] magic 64 cents all right we'll put that
[01:14:40] in with the rest of things over here
[01:14:46] then vanish from sight acrobatic

[01:15:15] foil then a deric attic and a widows
[01:15:18] walk foil and your AR
[01:15:21] card so what I was thinking was I have a
[01:15:23] wheel of magic but pretty much just like
[01:15:25] a magic it's a kind of like um Wheel of
[01:15:28] Fortune but with magic cards and Magic
[01:15:30] names instead of Magik card names
[01:15:33] instead of Wheel of for you know like
[01:15:34] the Wheel of Fortune things so that's
[01:15:36] how we play it there and we'll have um
[01:15:37] you know a way to the way you
[01:15:39] participate in there and whoever is
[01:15:40] participating dur in that time frame
[01:15:42] maybe I'll have you co-host so you get
[01:15:44] to say what you want the letter you want
[01:15:46] that type of thing what do you guys
[01:15:47] think on that I actually think that's a
[01:15:49] great
[01:15:50] idea that actually is probably a good
[01:15:52] one there what do you think not bad idea
[01:15:56] do the the wheel of magic and we'll have
[01:15:58] the cards up that well pretty much I'll
[01:16:00] I'll have a set of cards that you get to
[01:16:01] choose from as a person then we'll do
[01:16:04] some the way the rounds I think I have
[01:16:05] it already set up and I've done it in
[01:16:06] the past but I need to modify it a
[01:16:08] little bit let's see if we get some good

[03:23:53] did pick it pull an idol
[03:24:00] out there we go
[03:24:05] yes I uh yeah I don't I don't really get
[03:24:08] into the politics stuff personally
[03:24:09] because um you know it's one of the
[03:24:11] things I was told in my life that I
[03:24:13] stick to is there's like kind of like
[03:24:14] three things that you don't talk about
[03:24:16] in public that is religion sex and
[03:24:19] politics you can throw in some other
[03:24:21] things every now and again depending on
[03:24:23] where you are sometimes you can throw in
[03:24:24] some sports if you're in certain
[03:24:25] positions and jobs but other than that
[03:24:27] those are three things I was always
[03:24:28] taught not to talk about so I try not to
[03:24:30] do those in a public setting be
[03:24:32] respectful of everybody you know what I
[03:24:34] mean you don't know what everybody's
[03:24:36] thoughts and feelings are one two three
[03:24:38] four five six 78 you can have your own
[03:24:42] thoughts and feelings and how everything
[03:24:43] is and that's perfectly fine but I like
[03:24:44] to keep mine as a like I said like more
[03:24:46] of a private thing I feel like that's

[03:25:20] back hey not a problem iy love you guys
[03:25:22] too I appreciate
[03:25:26] it yeah you guys can have all of your
[03:25:29] own opinions on on stuff and that's
[03:25:31] perfectly fine with me but I I generally
[03:25:34] don't say mine out in a in a public
[03:25:36] place because it's one of those things
[03:25:37] like everybody has their own and I I
[03:25:38] like to keep mine to myself so I'm
[03:25:41] respectful of
[03:25:44] all that's a one of the things I was
[03:25:47] always taught I feel like it's a good
[03:25:48] thing for most people too you know it's
[03:25:50] you have your own opinions on things and
[03:25:51] that's great to have um we don't need to

[03:30:10] Lotus ban even shock the people who

[03:30:13] because they weren't consulted on it oh
[03:30:15] wow
[03:30:18] interesting yeah I figure uh
[03:30:19] everything's going to drop down a little
[03:30:21] bit I'm GNA buy a blue or a red one then
[03:30:23] I get to have a blue or red one and if
[03:30:25] things happen to change where they do
[03:30:26] EDH versus CDH and you know the the uh
[03:30:30] cedh can stay with monoc crys and those
[03:30:32] things and the Jewel Lotus and fine go
[03:30:34] right ahead but for what we're planning
[03:30:36] on what I would do you know I'm like I'd
[03:30:38] have one I don't have a ton of them I
[03:30:39] only had that one nice one here on the
[03:30:42] Savage Sandstorm salvager I'm going to
[03:30:45] put that in the top with the steam vents
[03:30:47] those will be the two cars that we use
[03:30:49] for proxies we're going to need proxies
[03:30:52] for all right there we
[03:30:57] go need a couple proxies for
[03:31:02] those yes it did yes it did see mine was
[03:31:06] $400 um and I ended up selling it for
[03:31:11] three and then I saw the other ones go
[03:31:14] down to three which is uh which is I was
[03:31:16] hoping so I could just pretty much trade
[03:31:22] it that was kind of my
[03:31:27] thought then here we go we're going to
[03:31:29] put out a sand
[03:31:31] storm I already put Sandstorm out
[03:31:37] steam there we
[03:31:39] go here we go we're going to zoom out
[03:31:43] here yeah I did it Wizard's pre see I'm
[03:31:47] going to let you guys know this is what
[03:31:48] I think is going on and Doro they wizard
[03:31:52] said we have new cards that are coming
[03:31:54] out that are powerful with um no there
[03:31:58] is a reason I'm telling you exactly what
[03:31:59] the reason is Wizards has Marvel coming
[03:32:02] out they need to have the stones to have
[03:32:04] certain powers um Tony one of the cards
[03:32:07] if it's Avail if it's actually the L
[03:32:09] card that the leak that happened he's
[03:32:11] going to be able to pull out the stones
[03:32:12] whenever he wants pretty much um and and
[03:32:16] they can't have it so we can pull out JW
[03:32:18] Lotus monoc Crypt and Stones so they had
[03:32:20] to get rid of the monoc crypt and the JW
[03:32:23] Lotus I'm telling you that's what's
[03:32:24] going on because Marvel is a big IP
[03:32:28] they're not going to let that thing go
[03:32:30] as an easy thing that's what I think is
[03:32:32] I personally think that's what's
[03:32:38] occurring day to live you two have a
[03:32:41] good one have a headphone but have a
[03:32:43] good one bud
[03:32:45] thanks for coming in hanging out I do
[03:32:47] appreciate it all right we're going to
[03:32:48] shuffle up our cards here and then I'm
[03:32:50] going to ask you all to tell me to stop
[03:32:52] in a second and I'll get a stop from you
[03:32:54] and then uh we'll
[03:32:58] go all right here we go ready
[03:33:03] one
[03:33:04] two three all right tell me when you
[03:33:07] want me to
[03:33:10] stop yeah solar ring would be pretty
[03:33:13] strong exactly
[03:33:16] all right anybody in the thing tell me
[03:33:18] when you want me to stop shuffling and
[03:33:19] then I'll start putting out out your
[03:33:21] stuff to hand them out who was in the
[03:33:23] break Hasbro values the
[03:33:26] relationship with its IP partner like
[03:33:28] Disney Square more than the magic fan
[03:33:30] base correct exactly that's exactly what
[03:33:32] I'm telling you that's they want their
[03:33:33] thing there so am I supposed to keep
[03:33:34] shuffling I'm still shuffling guys no
[03:33:36] one told me to stop
[03:33:39] yet and that's what I'm I personally
[03:33:41] think that's what's going on so somebody
[03:33:43] in the break needs to tell me to stop
[03:33:44] shuffling
[03:33:47] yeah I personally think that it is uh
[03:33:51] the
[03:33:52] IP fantasy yep yep they are definitely
[03:33:55] replacing it with Marvel and Harpy
[03:33:57] because it's going to get them a
[03:33:58] boatload of money dude I'm still going
[03:34:00] here I'm still shuffling here no one's
[03:34:03] told me to stop
[03:34:05] yet all right cool guy said stop
[03:34:08] finally there we go God my hands are
[03:34:11] getting tired
[03:34:13] [Laughter]
[03:34:15] we're going to zoom all the way out
[03:34:19] here all right we got those over
[03:34:22] there that
[03:34:27] there but marble isn't until 20 yeah but
[03:34:30] they need to Hype it up they're going to
[03:34:32] Hype it up you're going to get cards at
[03:34:33] Marvel um at Vegas or in New York for
[03:34:36] them and they're going to see them and
[03:34:38] they're going to Hype that [ __ ] all up
[03:34:39] all right so kid Kelly cool guy kid
[03:34:43] Kelly indori indori and
[03:34:46] mock that's what I got for our break
[03:34:48] right here all right you guys should be
[03:34:51] able to all see
[03:34:54] everything and here are cards we're
[03:34:56] going to be handing out to see what we
[03:34:59] get good luck
[03:35:00] everyone yeah I personally think what
[03:35:03] they're doing is they have their IPs and
[03:35:06] they can't get rid of the One Ring
[03:35:08] because it's an IP thing and they're
[03:35:09] never going to be able to get rid of
[03:35:10] that they also are going to have Marvel
[03:35:12] with their IPs and Marvel has the
[03:35:14] Infinity Stones
[03:35:16] you can't have Infinity Stones and Jewel
[03:35:18] Lotus and um monoc cryp at the same time
[03:35:23] all right that's what's going on I'm
[03:35:25] telling you right now they're making a
[03:35:27] business
[03:35:31] decision that's what they're doing with
[03:35:33] the new secret layer drop model they're
[03:35:35] doing getting the secondary Market
[03:35:36] pushes used the system before yes
[03:35:42] exactly yeah exactly Marvel cares about
[03:35:44] hype and money so they're going to get a
[03:35:46] boatload of hypee from this stuff all
[03:35:48] right for all their movies and things
[03:35:50] that they're doing all right here we go

[03:41:39] all go look at all this cool stuff we're
[03:41:41] doing and all their you know all the
[03:41:42] most popular thing that they're doing so
[03:41:44] that's what they're trying to do there
[03:41:45] they're capitalizing on it it's not a
[03:41:47] bad idea for a company to do it's just
[03:41:49] um they're burning out a lot of their
[03:41:52] players that have been here for years

[03:42:03] like a
[03:42:06] rock like that's a little
[03:42:09] crazy yeah exactly it's definitely
[03:42:11] negotiating the IP contract oh yeah like
[03:42:13] these like the one ring is never going
[03:42:15] to go away that's always going to be a

[03:59:48] cards we uh I've had some people asking
[03:59:50] me about getting different card games
[03:59:51] here should I get some different ones
[03:59:54] in I'm not a big Pokemon person so I
[03:59:56] wouldn't be able to know what to do with
[03:59:58] that that would be a hard one for me you
[04:00:00] guys would have to be here to help me if
[04:00:02] I ever did
[04:00:04] Pokemon i' need your assistance to know
[04:00:06] if something's
[04:00:10] good it's heating into your MTG budget
[04:00:16] that's
[04:00:19] funny see I I used to play the Pokemon
[04:00:23] game on Game Boy when it first came out
[04:00:25] like legitimately I have them actually I
[04:00:27] have blue red and gold I think somewhere
[04:00:30] in my storage stuff with my game boy but
[04:00:33] anyways I have those Pokemon the
[04:00:35] original ones and that's what I played
[04:00:36] when it first came out I played it on
[04:00:38] the Game Boy and I thought it was fun
[04:00:40] cards came out I bought a couple of the
[04:00:41] cards and I wasn't a big fan of them uh
[04:00:44] but I liked playing the game when I was
[04:00:46] growing up when I was younger you know
[04:00:48] it was a fun one all right Bob the con
[04:00:49] here you go my friend but and then it
[04:00:52] turned into what it is now and I'm like
[04:00:54] I can't do it
[04:00:55] now Bob the con I will say though the um
[04:00:58] the one where you went around the world
[04:01:00] walk around catching him that was
[04:01:02] actually a pretty good idea and I still
[04:01:04] think people should be doing that more
[04:01:05] frequently yeah kids love it well
[04:01:08] actually my kids have started to get
[04:01:09] away from Pokemon and they're now
[04:01:10] getting more into a magic because I play
[04:01:11] it so much and sorcery like they're
[04:01:13] actually doing it with me and my oldest
[04:01:15] is uh 12 now get almost 12 so he's going
[04:01:19] he's getting more into other stuff away
[04:01:21] from like kidish type
[04:01:27] things so they're playing more of that
[04:01:29] with me and some sorcery and stuff so I
[04:01:31] think maybe um you know that maybe we
[04:01:33] can do uh tomorrow we'll have them hang
[04:01:36] out with us because we don't do soccer
[04:01:39] anymore so long story short my boys both
[04:01:42] quit the soccer team on Tuesday
[04:01:45] um we're going to try to try out for
[04:01:46] another team but my youngest son is uh
[04:01:51] probably the best one if not the second
[04:01:53] best one on the team and they decided
[04:01:56] because of his age they wanted to move
[04:01:58] him down to a lower team so he could
[04:02:01] play more I'm like well why isn't he
[04:02:03] playing more on the other team like he's
[04:02:04] never going to when they like well he's
[04:02:05] never he'll never be anything more than
[04:02:06] second string I'm like okay I'm like
[04:02:09] he's better than other people is and
[04:02:11] they like that didn't matter so I uh uh
[04:02:14] so that when they I told my youngest
[04:02:16] when we were leaving practice what was
[04:02:18] going on he got very upset and cried
[04:02:20] obviously nine-year-old kid crying
[04:02:22] because he was taken off a team he
[04:02:23] shouldn't have been taken off of for no
[04:02:24] reason because he's still literally
[04:02:25] better than most of the kids if not all
[04:02:26] of them um and the only reason that the
[04:02:28] other kids are there is the uh the board
[04:02:30] memb children they're the board members
[04:02:33] children so that's what happens and they
[04:02:36] decided this was like kind of the second
[04:02:38] time he got [ __ ] around by this league
[04:02:40] so he decided instead of getting [ __ ]
[04:02:43] around by the league
[04:02:46] again he was going to uh not let him and
[04:02:50] he left and I don't I I agreed with it
[04:02:52] him quitting because that's the second
[04:02:54] time it happened to him they tried to do
[04:02:56] it at then put him on the lowlevel team
[04:02:58] at the beginning of the year and we're
[04:02:59] like he's um literally better than
[04:03:01] everyone you can't put him on that team
[04:03:03] that's going to stunt his growth and
[04:03:04] development as a soccer player he wants
[04:03:06] to get better he doesn't want to play
[04:03:09] your
[04:03:10] game and
[04:03:12] um yeah they ended
[04:03:16] up they ended up uh dropping him down so
[04:03:20] what happened was he ended up moving to
[04:03:21] another team well end up in both my I
[04:03:23] was very proud because my oldest
[04:03:25] actually goes as soon as um he said he's
[04:03:28] he's leaving because he doesn't want to
[04:03:29] be on the team that's not going to play
[04:03:31] him not going to be like you know fair
[04:03:33] with him my oldest goes I'm quitting too
[04:03:35] I'm not going to play on a team that's
[04:03:36] going to bully my younger brother I was
[04:03:38] like you know what bud I appreciate that
[04:03:40] that was probably one of my proudest
[04:03:42] moments right there when he did that he
[04:03:44] pretty much was like screw you people
[04:03:45] I'm standing up for my brother you guys
[04:03:46] are
[04:03:47] jerks and that made me very happy I'll
[04:03:50] have to say that that made me very happy
[04:03:52] Dad at that moment all right here we go
[04:03:55] let's hand out those so now we uh this
[04:03:57] weekend we don't have any soccer games
[04:03:59] uh we'll have them try out for another
[04:04:00] team though I think this week or next
[04:04:02] week um and then um they'll be playing
[04:04:04] again probably in another weekend but
[04:04:07] we'll have like a weekend or two off
[04:04:08] here while we um get transferred
[04:04:12] over they haven't we we have to talk to
[04:04:14] him about releasing them because uh they
[04:04:17] still haven't done
[04:04:21] that have to send him an
[04:04:26] email but yeah that's the that's what
[04:04:28] you got when you have kids you had to
[04:04:30] deal with stuff the funny thing is my
[04:04:32] son the people that they're keeping on
[04:04:34] the team my son literally meged and got
[04:04:36] a
[04:04:38] goal and he steals the ball from them
[04:04:40] all the time he was the only one that
[04:04:43] got an actual good pass to a goal in the
[04:04:46] game and not just a deflection because
[04:04:48] they got lucky in the last few games he
[04:04:50] actually they didn't want him to kick
[04:04:51] the corner kick and fine was what the
[04:04:54] coach said because he doesn't even want
[04:04:55] him on team you can tell he doesn't want
[04:04:56] him on team um and he kicked the corner
[04:04:59] kick and [ __ ] kid kicked it right to
[04:05:00] his old teammate which is the other
[04:05:02] nine-year-old that was playing on the
[04:05:03] team which is the the son of the um one
[04:05:05] of the one of the uh what do you call it
[04:05:09] people and um board members and
[04:05:13] literally that kid like kicked it right
[04:05:15] in exactly what he was supposed to
[04:05:16] literally better than every single
[04:05:18] player on their team the best corner
[04:05:20] kick that team has ever had was done by
[04:05:22] my son and his old his youngest the
[04:05:25] youngest team the other youngest
[04:05:26] teammate on that team which was a
[04:05:27] nine-year-old the other nine-year-old
[04:05:29] yet they're going to uh remove my son
[04:05:33] from that so my son said I will remove
[04:05:35] myself from the entire league I don't
[04:05:37] disagree with him on that anymore he
[04:05:40] actually wanted to do it the beginning
[04:05:41] of year but they ended up being like you
[04:05:43] know what we'll put him on on the other
[04:05:44] team and they're doing it again now so
[04:05:46] we're leaving not going to do with this
[04:05:51] stuff people think that they'll try to
[04:05:53] manipulate you into doing things like oh
[04:05:55] yeah we'll put them here and then we'll
[04:05:56] move them over to another team after is
[04:05:59] what they were trying to do and I don't
[04:06:01] do stuff like
[04:06:02] that I never
[04:06:04] have this the thing that sucks that you
[04:06:07] have your kids have to deal with it they
[04:06:09] finally are running into that you know
[04:06:11] my I ran into it when I was younger
[04:06:13] where if your father wasn't a coach or
[04:06:15] your dad wasn't part of or wasn't part
[04:06:18] of the league something or other you you
[04:06:19] never were chosen to do anything even if
[04:06:21] my uh stats were literally better than
[04:06:24] everyone
[04:06:27] else's I was a catcher when I played
[04:06:29] baseball growing up actually went on and
[04:06:31] wrestled in high school because I'm just
[04:06:32] an athletic person place third in the
[04:06:34] state but um I uh in middle school and
[04:06:38] Elementary School growing up I always
[04:06:39] played
[04:06:41] baseball and uh
[04:06:45] my on base percentage my hits
[04:06:49] my amount of balls that I let pass me as
[04:06:51] a
[04:06:53] catcher I think I maybe one because I
[04:06:55] used to play hockey I was a goalie too
[04:06:57] so I knew how to stop the
[04:06:58] balls and um so they ended up choosing
[04:07:03] one of the friends of the son of a coach
[04:07:05] to be the catcher when they send him
[04:07:07] like allars and stuff like that so I'm
[04:07:08] like you know what I learn I know
[04:07:09] exactly how this is going the biased
[04:07:11] Town [ __ ] I've been there before
[04:07:14] myself and it was mainly because my
[04:07:16] father was a fisherman he was gone every
[04:07:18] like more often than
[04:07:21] not
[04:07:23] so now that I'm not I'm not gone as of
[04:07:26] my dad I can tell those people to go
[04:07:28] pound sand show respect respect those
[04:07:31] both ways is really what it boils down
[04:07:33] to and they don't want to show it so
[04:07:35] we're going to
[04:07:37] leave I mean the board member is snarky
[04:07:40] faing
[04:07:41] and kind of why is that why is that so
[04:07:44] much remarks towards uh towards us at
[04:07:46] one point I almost wanted to say are you
[04:07:48] serious like we were friendly with you
[04:07:49] and took you out on our boat and you're
[04:07:50] going to act like this towards us that's
[04:07:52] the most ignorant person I've ever known
[04:07:54] in my
[04:07:55] life like extremely rude disrespectful
[04:07:59] and shows me their personality in the
[04:08:00] first place I expected I suspected that
[04:08:03] a little bit based off some of the
[04:08:05] comments they made when we were on the
[04:08:06] boat about my dad's boat being this and
[04:08:08] this big bad this big awesome thing I'm
[04:08:10] like oh wonderful like it's not yours
[04:08:12] though is it
[04:08:20] I love how the people are always the
[04:08:21] people that don't have anything but have
[04:08:23] it given from somebody else think
[04:08:24] they're better than others because they
[04:08:26] got stuff given to them from their
[04:08:27] parents when I when they don't realize I
[04:08:30] work from literally being homeless at
[04:08:32] one point to what I have now and I'm
[04:08:34] standing next to them going dude you've
[04:08:36] done nothing but had hands and stuff to
[04:08:38] you like that's not going to help like
[04:08:41] you don't like great you you've had a a
[04:08:43] lot of things handed to you in your
[04:08:45] life let me know your ad uh everything
[04:08:47] that you've done and had to overcome at
[04:08:49] some point to become this strong person
[04:08:51] that you say you are hey Diddy in here
[04:08:55] Diddy's in here well that's not
[04:09:01] good either way though we'll take him
[04:09:04] over to a new team we'll be nice we've
[04:09:06] never had a problem with it we I like
[04:09:08] the people there but that that really
[04:09:10] annoyed the crap out of me that did
[04:09:12] annoy the crap out of me
[04:09:14] I like a lot of the parents that are
[04:09:16] there that are with their kids and their
[04:09:17] teams but if the board's doing stuff
[04:09:19] like that this new board that came in
[04:09:21] makes sense why the other guy tried to
[04:09:22] have no people that were related to
[04:09:24] children being in the board or coaches
[04:09:26] because this is exactly what he was
[04:09:28] trying to stop you
[04:09:29] know trying to stop that
[04:09:32] uh small town bias that always
[04:09:35] happens when sports are
[04:09:40] involved luckily I went to a private
[04:09:42] high school when I got older in the
[04:09:44] private high school did not care about
[04:09:45] your small town anything they cared
[04:09:47] about your Merit and your ability and it
[04:09:49] was all based on Merit which was very
[04:09:51] nice because I bust my ass and I ended
[04:09:54] up having I was in all AP classes with a
[04:09:56] 40 GPA and third place in the state for
[04:10:00] my wrestling weight class because they
[04:10:03] pushed you to be
[04:10:04] better I didn't like a few of the things
[04:10:06] that some bad things happened there I
[04:10:10] that aren't necessary to talk about here
[04:10:12] but um
[04:10:15] other than that they did push you to
[04:10:17] become the best version of yourself and
[04:10:19] that I will admit St John's Prep and
[04:10:21] daners did
[04:10:23] do but the only thing I will not admit
[04:10:28] is the people there I wanted to [ __ ]
[04:10:31] punch half the time they're snoy
[04:10:32] [ __ ] thinking they're better
[04:10:33] than everyone else because they have
[04:10:39] money yeah exactly you missed 120 days
[04:10:41] of school your senior year now you're a
[04:10:42] lawyer dude like I
[04:10:44] like I had people that I just was a
[04:10:47] smart kid so I I learned and I picked
[04:10:49] stuff up quickly a lot of the times what
[04:10:51] happened was people would just give me a
[04:10:53] like because I was poor my dad wasn't
[04:10:56] around much they would pick on me a few
[04:10:58] of them thought I didn't even have a dad
[04:11:00] and I think that's part of the reason
[04:11:01] why they picked on me um because I was
[04:11:03] like I think I've told this story before
[04:11:05] like I was 12 years old and my um my
[04:11:08] father happened to come to one of my
[04:11:09] baseball games he hadn't been to any of
[04:11:11] my baseball games probably in like three
[04:11:13] years just because he was a fisherman he
[04:11:15] got he's on his boat for two weeks to a
[04:11:16] month at a time in the middle of the
[04:11:17] ocean pulling in Nets so we didn't have
[04:11:20] the chance to so he happened to have the
[04:11:22] chance to because weather was going to
[04:11:23] be bad for a couple weeks or like a week
[04:11:25] or so so he came home hung out with us
[04:11:27] and happened to be at a baseball game I
[04:11:28] had a kid that was a friend of mine came
[04:11:30] up to me goes hey James who's that guy
[04:11:32] standing next to your sitting next to
[04:11:33] your mom I'm like like oh what are you
[04:11:34] talking about like I'm confused as all
[04:11:36] hell I'm looking up at him like what guy
[04:11:38] are you talking about he like the dude
[04:11:39] sitting next to your dad your mom I'm
[04:11:41] like what do what do you mean the guy
[04:11:42] sitting next to my mom I'm looking I'm
[04:11:43] like I'm seeing my dad there I'm like
[04:11:45] like I don't know what you're talking
[04:11:46] about like there's a guy and like uh
[04:11:48] he's like kind of like a got a got a got
[04:11:51] a jacket he's got the jacket on the and
[04:11:53] the dirty Chans I'm like that's my
[04:12:00] dad exactly exactly I was polite and
[04:12:02] respectful whenever anything happened
[04:12:04] and they never got the book thrown at me
[04:12:05] I never had any issues if you I will
[04:12:07] tell you one thing when it and no no one
[04:12:09] wants not everybody likes to hear this
[04:12:11] but if you act overly
[04:12:15] respectful to police officers no matter
[04:12:17] how they are acting towards you 90% of
[04:12:21] the time they'll either calm
[04:12:22] down and be like all right this guy's
[04:12:24] being respectful and not a jerk and be
[04:12:26] okay with you there is the 10% of the
[04:12:28] time there's a guy that's a [ __ ]
[04:12:30] you're just going to run into that
[04:12:31] that's just people but most of the time
[04:12:34] they will either one not even cause a
[04:12:36] problem in the first place because they
[04:12:37] don't care because you're being
[04:12:38] respectful two they can they'll either
[04:12:40] calm sometimes they'll calm down and be
[04:12:42] like you know what this isn't bad he
[04:12:44] he's a respectful person let's give him
[04:12:46] a warning you know I've run into that
[04:12:49] before where a guy came over to me he's
[04:12:50] like do you know why I pulled you over
[04:12:51] you're going 50 and a 30 I'm like I'm
[04:12:53] sorry I didn't see the sign drop down I
[04:12:55] thought it was further up and I was
[04:12:57] being respectful he gave me a warning
[04:12:59] literally a written warning saying hey
[04:13:01] don't just calm down just slow down I
[04:13:02] know it drops quick down here pay
[04:13:04] attention it drops earlier than you
[04:13:06] expect pretty
[04:13:09] simple and you know I'm I you know
[04:13:13] people are just don't I don't know it's
[04:13:14] hard to say and I understand some people
[04:13:16] say like it depends on who you are and
[04:13:17] where you are I've been in places where
[04:13:20] literally police instantly think you're
[04:13:22] the problem and all you do is just
[04:13:26] exactly what they say because if they do
[04:13:29] something wrong you can always Sue this
[04:13:31] sue the police department after you just
[04:13:34] do everything you're supposed to
[04:13:36] everything they're telling you because
[04:13:38] if they do something over the top and
[04:13:40] wrong and you're doing what you're
[04:13:41] supposed to and you're told
[04:13:44] you can sue
[04:13:50] them oh nice see for me I always was
[04:13:54] there I actually I missed one day of

[04:15:59] I've had an issue from the shipments on
[04:16:01] Tuesday they're not print they're not
[04:16:03] showing right and I'm really getting
[04:16:04] frustrated because I don't like being I
[04:16:06] like having my thing ship out on time
[04:16:08] and these ones are wicked late
[04:16:11] now it's
[04:16:19] frustrating no response yet I'm gonna
[04:16:22] have to uh I don't know what to do I
[04:16:24] guess I'm just gonna have to I guess I'm
[04:16:25] G have to print them
[04:16:27] maybe yeah I didn't see I never got
[04:16:29] detension and stuff but um cool guy I
[04:16:32] didn't have that type of thing what I
[04:16:33] had for an issue was um I would get into
[04:16:37] fights with the people that were giving
[04:16:38] me a hard time and then after my
[04:16:41] sophomore year at high school they
[04:16:42] stopped pretty much they realized he was
[04:16:43] on the wrestling team now he has skill
[04:16:45] along with his ability to just not give
[04:16:48] a fly and just pound on people and even
[04:16:50] if I got pounded on I'd still be
[04:16:52] pounding right back at
[04:16:54] someone and that was because my dad had
[04:16:56] to always taught me he he literally said
[04:16:57] to me when I grew up when I was growing
[04:17:00] up he said to me punch him in the
[04:17:02] face they won't do it again break their
[04:17:06] nose all you got to do is break their
[04:17:08] nose one time and they will not do that
[04:17:10] again to you so that's what I did
[04:17:14] had a couple inces in an elementary
[04:17:16] school in middle school but I never had
[04:17:19] issues after those situations because
[04:17:21] they realized this kid was going to
[04:17:21] fight back and he's not going to let you
[04:17:23] to get away with
[04:17:25] it shove the kids you you know but I I
[04:17:28] never ended up getting in trouble really
[04:17:29] because they always knew I was defending
[04:17:30] myself I was always a little guy getting
[04:17:32] picked on and I wouldn't do anything I
[04:17:34] even had like the people that were like
[04:17:35] the superintendant being like this he
[04:17:37] tell my my mom was a bus driver was the
[04:17:39] head of the bus drivers so she was like
[04:17:41] the director of the bus drivers like he
[04:17:42] he's going to have a problem here he's
[04:17:43] too nice he doesn't do anything when
[04:17:45] people do stuff to him they like no my
[04:17:47] mom would be like he's all right he's
[04:17:48] all right then stuff happens then I end
[04:17:51] up [ __ ] throwing people to the ground
[04:17:52] and pounding on him like I told you he's
[04:17:54] fine I'm like my dad told me what I can
[04:17:57] do and i' I've handled myself more than
[04:17:58] once growing up
[04:18:00] so you know what you can do there you

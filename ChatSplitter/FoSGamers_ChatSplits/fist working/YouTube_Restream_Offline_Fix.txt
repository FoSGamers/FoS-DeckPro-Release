To troubleshoot YouTube videos being offline when using Restream.io, here are a few common solutions:

### 1. **Check Stream Key and Settings**
   - **Restream Dashboard:**
     - Make sure you're using the correct **YouTube stream key**.
     - Ensure that your YouTube channel is properly linked in your Restream.io dashboard.
     - Check that your stream settings (bitrate, resolution) match YouTube’s requirements (usually 1080p at around 4500-6000 kbps for optimal performance).

   - **YouTube Settings:**
     - Go to **YouTube Studio** > **Content** > **Live** and check the stream settings.
     - Ensure the event or live stream is set to **Public** or **Unlisted** (not **Private** unless intentionally hidden).

### 2. **Verify Streaming Permissions**
   - **Account Status:**
     - Confirm that your YouTube account is in good standing and not facing restrictions.
     - Check that you have **enabled live streaming** in YouTube settings.

### 3. **Check for Streaming Lag or Delays**
   - **Stream Delay:**
     - Sometimes, the video appears offline because there's a delay in Restream pushing your feed. Wait a few minutes to see if the stream shows up.
     - You can reduce or turn off stream delay in Restream settings under **Advanced Stream Settings**.

   - **Internet Connection:**
     - Ensure that your internet upload speed is stable and sufficient for streaming. Streaming on multiple platforms can consume significant bandwidth.

### 4. **Check Stream Health in YouTube Studio**
   - Open **YouTube Studio** > **Stream Health** during your broadcast. If there are any warnings or errors, they will appear here. Make sure the stream bitrate and resolution match YouTube's standards.

### 5. **Enable Auto-Start and Auto-Stop (Optional)**
   - If you want your stream to go live automatically on YouTube, enable the **Auto-Start** and **Auto-Stop** features in YouTube's live stream settings. Without this, you might have to manually start the stream on YouTube.

### 6. **Restream.io Server Issues**
   - Visit **Restream’s status page** to see if they are experiencing any downtime. If they are, the video might not be streaming live due to server-side issues.

### 7. **OBS or Streaming Software Settings**
   - If you're using OBS or similar streaming software, ensure it’s properly configured to broadcast through Restream.
     - Check your **output settings** in OBS (or your streaming software), such as video resolution and bitrate, match YouTube's and Restream’s recommendations.

### 8. **Clear Cache or Re-authenticate YouTube in Restream**
   - Clear your browser’s cache or try re-authenticating your YouTube channel in Restream to refresh any token-related issues that might prevent streaming.

### 9. **Update Stream Titles and Descriptions**
   - Check that the video title and description are properly set in Restream’s dashboard for YouTube.

After checking these settings, your YouTube stream should start displaying correctly if there are no major platform issues.

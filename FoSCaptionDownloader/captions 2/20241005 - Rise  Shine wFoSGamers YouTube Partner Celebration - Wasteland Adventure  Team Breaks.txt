[00:08:08] mini break which is
[00:08:11] a for six
[00:08:16] people all right and we're going to do
[00:08:18] it like
[00:08:20] this where we have
[00:08:35] one
[00:08:37] two one
[00:08:46] two one
[00:08:48] two that way is

[00:08:55] have
[00:09:01] one
[00:09:03] two put those back that means put these
[00:09:06] back
[00:09:10] here put that
[00:09:12] there do that there then what we'll do
[00:09:16] is we're going to take and do this we're
[00:09:18] going to
[00:09:21] have one
[00:09:24] two I shouldn't have put all of them
[00:09:26] back I need two of those and then
[00:09:30] we will
[00:09:51] do
[00:09:53] one and
[00:10:05] we'll add another one of those in there
[00:10:08] all right so this is how it's going to
[00:10:09] go today a little bit of a interesting
[00:10:12] one here I'm going to change the I'll
[00:10:13] change the price of this because the
[00:10:14] price is going to be a little different
[00:10:18] now we'll go with that one there I'll
[00:10:21] add those and put those back over there
[00:10:23] in a
[00:10:25] second all right so
[00:10:32] okay here we go this is how we're going

[00:10:37] today all right
[00:10:39] so these six packs will be the ones that
[00:10:42] are in the the first the you you in your
[00:10:45] two your team pick all right we're going

[00:10:50] based on the point system your team has
[00:10:52] the highest points you get to pick first
[00:10:53] out of these six packs now you get
[00:10:56] collector boosters and set Commander D
[00:10:58] Masters set so they're all same price
[00:11:01] $25 $22 they not a big difference you
[00:11:02] get your choice that just is what it
[00:11:04] boils down to is the team that wins
[00:11:07] first gets to pick first and the team
[00:11:09] that wins second picks second and it
[00:11:11] would go in the order of who had the

[00:22:42] it so we'll do it ourselves with some
[00:22:43] other stuff that I had planned and I had
[00:22:45] off to the side over the years that I

[00:23:02] that if I'm doing the good thing is the
[00:23:03] YouTube yes that that's the good thing
[00:23:06] there that's definitely the good
[00:23:08] thing but what we have our break no one
[00:23:11] wants to jump in on that so it looks
[00:23:12] like we're going to
[00:23:14] um just be a giveaway
[00:23:20] day it'll be a giveaway day I'm just
[00:23:22] going to open here a couple of things
[00:23:24] that I put off to the
[00:23:26] side that we hadn't opened up over time
[00:23:30] we're going to see if there's anything
[00:23:31] worthwhile in them have a couple of
[00:23:33] these packs going put these over here
[00:23:36] see if anybody wants to jump in that

[00:45:28] right before you get you see this
[00:45:30] Outpost in the distance and you look you
[00:45:32] go oh look it it's an outpost somewhere
[00:45:34] for me to go trade maybe buy some other
[00:45:37] things I don't know and as you're
[00:45:39] getting ready to get out to
[00:45:43] it hope is a SIG pistol you know
[00:45:46] what pretty good looking pistol I don't
[00:45:49] know if it's a Sig but it's a nice
[00:45:50] looking one so you get a pistol and
[00:45:52] you've got a knife all right you get a
[00:45:54] knife and a pistol but oh no this is not

[00:46:50] 10 I mean no that was the medium is 11
[00:46:53] I'm sorry the medium is 11 and it's a

[01:27:22] so I kept a handful of these and have
[01:27:24] some of the mystery booster ones so we
[01:27:26] do stuff like that I like to do those
[01:27:28] where we have a bunch of different ones
[01:27:29] when we do like chaos things but I've
[01:27:30] only done them a couple times before I'd
[01:27:32] love to get a chaos draft somehow that
[01:27:34] we can do together online with everybody
[01:27:36] I fig I would love to figure out a way
[01:27:37] to be able to do that on like spell
[01:27:39] table or
[01:27:41] something Stone cloaker we you know what
[01:27:44] I can zoom in a little bit more here I

[01:28:38] interested we have um we've been trying
[01:28:39] to set up some um like games and stuff
[01:28:41] like that so if people are interested in
[01:28:42] doing a draft I think we can set up a
[01:28:44] way of doing that online here with
[01:28:46] everybody where um it will probably end
[01:28:48] up being more than um three cards packs
[01:28:50] I'm guessing it would probably end up
[01:28:51] being like four packs or maybe five
[01:28:54] packs that you can use to build it with
[01:28:56] and we'll do our own kind of like draft
[01:28:57] in a way uh what do you guys think about
[01:28:59] doing that we'll uh get that kind of set

[03:15:34] friend oh nice that's pretty nice yeah
[03:15:37] we um I used to actually snowboard up in
[03:15:40] that area I had uh on a regular basis
[03:15:42] during college but after college we
[03:15:44] didn't really do it too much because I
[03:15:47] was the only one that I knew that like
[03:15:49] the weather to go out and Snowboard
[03:15:52] everybody else that I knew was like I
[03:15:53] don't want to go snowboard it's cold or
[03:15:56] I don't want to go out there it's cold
[03:15:58] so that's part of the reason why we
[03:16:00] moved to Florida none of my family ever
[03:16:01] wanted to go out and do
[03:16:03] anything that's pretty nice yeah we used
[03:16:05] to um I used to be in Milton New
[03:16:07] Hampshire um and was where we had a lake
[03:16:10] a lake Place ourself and then
[03:16:15] um we had uh a place on the lake there
[03:16:18] and then we also had um I lived in
[03:16:20] barington New Hampshire for a while for
[03:16:22] a few like probably 12 years after
[03:16:26] college when I when we were first met my
[03:16:27] wife and first had my kids and stuff
[03:16:29] then we moved down here to Florida where

[03:27:12] today let's come on and jump in on it
[03:27:15] let's get a mini break we only have five
[03:27:16] spots that are left in
[03:27:19] it there we go five spots
[03:27:22] left this is the break that we have so
[03:27:24] there are these six here you have MERS
[03:27:29] play bloomo play and a couple Exelon
[03:27:31] draft then we have these six which are
[03:27:33] second dor collector Bloomberg collector
[03:27:36] and a commander Masters set two of those
[03:27:39] now the way that we do this is a little
[03:27:40] team you pick your teams after you guys
[03:27:43] all Buy in you will pick your teams
[03:27:45] there'll be there will be three against
[03:27:46] three and you all uh will roll dice to
[03:27:49] see who picks randomly whoever based on
[03:27:51] who goes first we'll roll dice we'll see
[03:27:53] which if you know which op options they
[03:27:55] pick in and then they get to pick
[03:27:57] whichever one of these they want and
[03:28:00] they get points based on cards so
[03:28:02] Commons are one uncommons are three
[03:28:05] rares are five and mythics are 10 so
[03:28:09] what happens is you get that point
[03:28:11] system there and I'll keep a little
[03:28:13] chart so you can see it and whoever
[03:28:14] whichever team has the highest points
[03:28:15] gets a pick their packs first out of our
[03:28:18] bunch of collectors and our set of
[03:28:20] Commander Masters since they're all the
[03:28:21] same price that's why we did that that
[03:28:23] way pretty much all packs the same price
[03:28:25] you're just going to get an opportunity
[03:28:26] of picking which ones and the winning
[03:28:28] team will pick first and whoever has
[03:28:31] highest points in the winning team picks
[03:28:32] first and so on then the winning team
[03:28:34] the second the losing team picks second
[03:28:36] and that's our little uh kind of our
[03:28:38] break today and pretty much your ping
[03:28:40] two packs of cards is really what it
[03:28:41] boils down to that's what we were doing
[03:28:43] for our break today it was going to be a
[03:28:44] fun one I thought we kind of do little
[03:28:46] competition between
[03:28:50] everyone and everybody
[03:28:53] today um that is in the break I was
[03:28:56] going to give dice away to everybody but

[03:40:01] just was looking trying to find a soul
[03:40:05] ring for our
[03:40:07] friend which I thought I had
[03:40:10] had but I don't know where they are
[03:40:30] I just can't figure out what I did with
[03:40:32] them so we're looking through our stuff
[03:40:35] and try to
[03:40:37] find where they
[03:40:43] are those prices are from a long time
[03:40:46] ago so you can kind of ignore
[03:40:48] that it was a game from a while
[03:40:54] agoa Exemplar like that's a nice little
[03:40:57] card to have out of there
[03:41:01] ravnik
[03:41:06] Mythic let's get uh let's see if we can
[03:41:08] get this break going here I'm going to
[03:41:10] put the break back in here for everybody
[03:41:12] so you can pin it and see it looks like
[03:41:15] the brakes are just not happening
[03:41:16] recently we'll pin that that's okay
[03:41:19] though I don't mind that that's okay
[03:41:22] we'll have to do some different stuff
[03:41:29] then no I don't think there's one in
[03:41:32] here
[03:41:37] either I thought I had seen one earlier
[03:41:41] the other day when I was looking through
[03:41:43] stuff and I cannot find what I did with
[03:41:44] it
[03:41:53] I went through the thing is I'd gone
[03:41:54] through and I organiz and put a bunch of
[03:41:56] stuff together so I didn't have them in
[03:41:58] like a random
[03:42:00] locations and in doing
[03:42:03] that I lost where I had everything
[03:42:05] originally
[03:42:08] before knowing where it all
[03:42:12] was if that makes any sense
[03:42:28] yeah see well I'm told to clean up
[03:42:30] whenever I'm told to clean up I clean up
[03:42:32] and then I put it away I'm like oh
[03:42:33] that's a good thing to do let's put this
[03:42:34] away and do this and I never remember
[03:42:36] what happened to it after it was put
[03:42:37] away
[03:42:48] that's
[03:42:54] me these are all from games before and I
[03:42:56] thought I don't know if I saw one in
[03:42:58] this but these are all from games that I
[03:43:00] played that's why you see stuff written
[03:43:01] on it and things like that a lot of
[03:43:03] times so we' played different games over
[03:43:05] times and we've um taken them apart
[03:43:08] because nobody used them and did
[03:43:10] different stuff with them and then I
[03:43:11] just got to get some of these taken out
[03:43:13] some of these cards organize
[03:43:21] these are just my chunk of them that I
[03:43:22] just put together because I need to get
[03:43:24] them out of the
[03:43:28] way nope not on these
[03:43:32] either not on those
[03:43:38] either happen here all right then
[03:43:48] oh these are my time spiral oh that's

[03:44:41] going to be in here and it will be
[03:44:42] because I said it won't be cuz these are
[03:44:44] just all my common and uncommon things
[03:44:47] which is a good chance of it being here
[03:44:48] being the soul ring
[03:44:54] but we'll
[03:45:01] see NOP

[03:53:39] things no no not not that
[03:53:41] side that's all sorcery
[03:53:46] those are all
[03:53:56] tokens all right let's check this thing
[03:54:15] I know I have
[03:54:19] one I'm going to be annoyed as all hell
[03:54:21] because I can't find
[03:54:26] it oh my
[03:54:38] God this is just
[03:54:42] crazy trying to find a car and you can't
[03:54:44] find
[03:54:53] [Music]
[03:55:04] it okay
[03:55:16] no no no no no
[03:55:22] there
[03:55:24] no that would not be me I'm fos
[03:55:28] Gamers on
[03:55:32] everything land in front's another um
[03:55:35] another
[03:55:37] streamer why is that do you find
[03:55:40] somebody did you get something
[03:55:44] oh about
[03:55:50] them someone's trying to talk trash
[03:55:52] about them
[03:55:58] where what do they do if you don't mind
[03:56:02] I don't think they I haven't had any
[03:56:03] problems with anybody like that
[03:56:06] before so it's intriguing when somebody
[03:56:08] comes out and says this is an issue
[03:56:10] because a lot of times I find um the
[03:56:12] people that are complaining are
[03:56:14] not as much of an issue as they
[03:56:16] initially made it made it out to
[03:56:34] be not complaining about me
[03:56:38] right oh really I have to go and look
[03:56:40] and see what's going
[03:56:42] on we try uh yeah I'll have to go and
[03:56:45] look at it and see what's going on
[03:56:46] because we try not to um try to call
[03:56:49] that stuff a little bit I don't like to
[03:56:51] have bad mouthing a bunch of people and
[03:56:53] you know that type of thing like stuff
[03:56:54] can happen but you make a comment but we
[03:56:56] don't want to go off if that makes
[03:56:59] sense like hey this happened to me just
[03:57:02] so you're
[03:57:06] aware I swear I had one but I guess I
[03:57:08] don't right
[03:57:12] now give me a second and I'm going to
[03:57:14] keep finding it I know I got one here
[03:57:28] somewhere but I'm not going to find it
[03:57:30] because I I want it
[03:57:36] today that's how it goes
[03:57:46] that's how it always
[03:57:53] goes
[03:57:56] n seriously I know I had it
[03:58:22] oh almost dropped the Bol load of
[03:58:28] cards oh I was done kind of I was almost
[03:58:30] at the end anyways so I'm not worried
[03:58:32] about
[03:58:33] it it was one of those things I was like
[03:58:35] towards the end of my thing anyways so
[03:58:37] that's why I was like we'll
[03:58:40] uh we'll go I'll look for it that's why
[03:58:42] I didn't worry about looking for it if
[03:58:44] it was like the middle of it I would
[03:58:45] have said hey we'll do something else
[03:58:47] for a little bit but I wanted to uh it
[03:58:49] was like kind of like the end like I
[03:58:50] said so I was just like you know what
[03:58:52] I'll find it if I can I swear I had
[03:58:56] one where in God's name did I put
[03:59:00] that it's one of those situations though
[03:59:03] that you find like I know I have it why
[03:59:06] can't I find it and it's annoying
[03:59:10] me it's annoying me
[03:59:16] it's annoying me
[03:59:45] no nope not
[04:00:01] there all right I'm right I gotta hold
[04:00:04] on I swear I got one
[04:00:12] here this one of those things like I'm
[04:00:14] I'm [ __ ] annoyed because I'm not
[04:00:16] finding it if that makes any sense at
[04:00:20] all I think I'm more annoyed I'm not
[04:00:23] finding it than
[04:00:33] anything that is probably was my problem
[04:00:36] more than anything I'm like I'm more

[00:41:16] got that now um let me get to our next
[00:41:20] person with our cards here was famous
[00:41:25] One
[00:41:30] two three bloomo here we go my friend
[00:41:34] what do we like these open famous or
[00:41:36] should we ship them home
[00:41:41] hey I have I will be selling some of
[00:41:44] them I I I have enough that I have a ton
[00:41:47] I don't have a ton I only got like
[00:41:48] enough for my family and maybe one or
[00:41:50] two for the store so I was going to open
[00:41:52] some of them um and sell some of them as
[00:41:53] singles and then the rest I was going to
[00:41:55] have maybe one or two that I was going
[00:41:57] to uh potentially have that I'd sell at
[00:41:59] whatever the market price were closed
[00:42:01] sealed that I'd do as a uh like an
[00:42:03] auction and when I get them in um then
[00:42:07] for other other than that though I was I
[00:42:09] don't have that many I didn't get a lot
[00:42:10] cuz I didn't want to go and like see
[00:42:12] other people went and they make like
[00:42:13] four counts and they buy all kinds of
[00:42:15] stuff and I don't want to do that I feel
[00:42:16] like that's a little immoral so I just I
[00:42:19] got what I was allowed to one two three
[00:42:21] four five 6 7 eight and I was hoping if
[00:42:25] there was stuff left over after I could
[00:42:27] get more for the store but
[00:42:30] yeah oh that sucks dude yeah I was in
[00:42:32] and right away the first literally the
[00:42:34] way that I had I was lucky to get it was
[00:42:36] I jumped in and instead of going and
[00:42:39] picking out a bunch of things I went in
[00:42:40] and picked five of the full packs of
[00:42:42] everything and I hit checkout
[00:42:44] immediately so I was in like a second or
[00:42:47] two or less within there with as soon as
[00:42:49] it was open and I was right in check out
[00:42:50] and I automatically and I was already
[00:42:51] checked out so I had already logged in
[00:42:53] and M I was logged in already like a
[00:42:55] minute before so I could go check in and
[00:42:57] log right out and have it go right
[00:42:59] through for that me and I that's the
[00:43:00] reason why I was able to get through it
[00:43:01] but I still didn't get all of the um I
[00:43:03] didn't get all the promos because they
[00:43:05] freaking uh people were skipping

[00:45:29] and I had never seen whatnot before
[00:45:31] before I had applied to
[00:45:33] sell all right that's how I was and I
[00:45:35] started this I was like oh well I can
[00:45:36] stream to YouTube if I do this and I can
[00:45:38] all right this kind of fun because my
[00:45:40] son had wanted to open packs I wasn't
[00:45:43] going to be able to afford to do that
[00:45:44] regularly so I was like all right well
[00:45:46] we did what we could we sell in some of
[00:45:48] the stuff that we opened and then maybe
[00:45:50] we can open more and then it kind of
[00:45:51] grew into what it is now um so with that
[00:45:55] like growing into that we
[00:45:57] we just kind of put everything back into
[00:45:59] it have fun one two three four five six

[00:59:35] the card right on this Mas not a bad
[00:59:37] idea and it fits in there with the FR
[00:59:40] not a bad idea buddy not a bad idea you
[00:59:42] can also paint yeah let's that's a good
[00:59:43] idea let's look at or we can look at it
[00:59:44] later I think it's a good one I just got
[00:59:46] to save it save it yeah D definitely all
[00:59:49] right you've got o look at that you got
[00:59:50] a pistol which is a plus two weapon I
[00:59:53] like it I you've gotten lucky my friend
[00:59:56] Daddy I your and then I have my key
[00:59:58] chains all right on the other one nice I
[01:00:00] like it good job bud that's good I like
[01:00:02] how it looks than we can how about we
[01:00:04] can refine it a little bit later how's
[01:00:06] that sound yeah this
[01:00:07] is cat is the only thing I have oh
[01:00:10] that's fine I've used it before I know
[01:00:11] what it is okay all right so you have a
[01:00:14] pistol you did not get lucky enough to
[01:00:16] get the big uh the play booster box in
[01:00:18] there but you did get a pistol for your
[01:00:20] character which gets them six shots all
[01:00:22] right you have six shots now so you have
[01:00:25] a choice what would you like to do on
[01:00:27] your adventure with your adventure here
[01:00:28] cuz they currently have the small Rader
[01:00:30] in front of
[01:00:31] them would you like to
[01:00:34] um roll again now that you have a
[01:00:37] weapon because you have plus two which
[01:00:40] means all you need to get is 13 instead
[01:00:42] of 15 to hit the creature to hit this B
[01:00:45] uh this uh this um small
[01:00:49] Raider or maybe you want to try for some
[01:00:53] Buffs if you run you'll drop some ammo
[01:00:57] you will not you lose your weapon but
[01:00:58] instead of losing six ammo you'll having
[01:01:01] six ammo you'll go down to three
[01:01:02] generally it drops it in half or you
[01:01:04] drop 10 10 Rounds or it cuts it in half
[01:01:06] is how I've been doing it
[01:01:09] here yep so it's your choice if you want
[01:01:11] to uh you can always run and drop some
[01:01:14] of your pistol ammo and leave it there
[01:01:16] for them that Raider will be like oh
[01:01:17] sweet I get some pistol ammo come over
[01:01:20] and take it are you going to run oh I
[01:01:21] like the attack we're attacking one more
[01:01:22] time we attack and we get oh no that's
[01:01:25] that's not good it's an eight that that
[01:01:28] didn't that didn't help you I'm
[01:01:31] sorry you shoot with your pistol even
[01:01:36] though you have the plus two you miss it
[01:01:38] was the first time you picked up a
[01:01:39] pistol you've never used it before you
[01:01:41] didn't really know what to do you shot
[01:01:42] and it went right by them nowhere near
[01:01:44] them you actually shot it almost up the
[01:01:46] air that radar l laughing and they shoot
[01:01:48] back at
[01:01:50] you and they hit you because you missed
[01:01:53] bringing you down to 78 health
[01:01:56] you have a choice now your last one is
[01:01:59] you attack or you run now remember if
[01:02:02] you run you're going to have to drop
[01:02:03] some of your ammo but yeah at least get
[01:02:05] away and he won't be able to loot you
[01:02:07] because if he if he hits you now it's
[01:02:09] going to probably knock you out and he's
[01:02:10] going to end up looting you and taking
[01:02:12] all of your
[01:02:13] stuff so it's your choice how you
[01:02:17] play attack one more
[01:02:20] time oh we have 10 we got a 10
[01:02:26] I'm sorry my
[01:02:28] friend looks like you shot with that
[01:02:31] pistol and again you're not used to
[01:02:33] using a pistol your Adventurer was used
[01:02:35] to using a wrench and maybe a whip who
[01:02:38] knows and he
[01:02:39] loses that weapon he now F he he shoots
[01:02:44] the pistol and oh no that Raider does
[01:02:47] not hit him it does not hit the Raider
[01:02:48] the Raider Laughs Again shoots you
[01:02:51] back and you're now down to 69 health
[01:02:56] and you
[01:02:58] have you know what I'm going to be I'm
[01:03:01] going to be nice we're going to say he
[01:03:04] just took all of your ammo and left you
[01:03:06] with the pistol so you just have zero
[01:03:08] ammo because he L he sees you laying on
[01:03:11] the ground he laughs at you and he feels
[01:03:13] sorry for you so he leaves all your ammo
[01:03:15] there takes all your ammo but takes
[01:03:17] leaves you with everything El with your
[01:03:18] pistol so my friend what would you like
[01:03:21] to do now do you want to rip your pack

[01:35:11] them on the card it literally says them
[01:35:14] right on the card you don't need to look
[01:35:15] for a symbol or anything like that so
[01:35:18] I'll show you where it
[01:35:20] is so here you are
[01:35:24] these ones say
[01:35:27] ordinary right there all right and the

[01:37:33] art and that's what I liked about when I

[01:43:31] to be on though is to do some short
[01:43:32] things one
[01:43:34] two three four I was hoping that I got
[01:43:39] um um Marvel in and if I do I was going
[01:43:43] to bring some of that with me along with
[01:43:44] some of the New Foundation stuff and
[01:43:46] have some fun with
[01:43:48] that hey you have a good one cage see

[01:44:20] third exceptional and a silven splendor
[01:44:23] oh nice I like that one I'll do what I
[01:44:26] can for uh saving things I I I have a
[01:44:28] lot of people asking for them so I'm
[01:44:30] going to do my best to let people know
[01:44:32] when I have them so that you can come
[01:44:34] and grab them uh when I have them
[01:44:35] available but cage we'll see you around
[01:44:38] buddy nice on there I haven't actually
[01:44:40] seen that silven before I don't think
[01:44:43] nice pick up on that and then I think
[01:44:46] something popped up here in my
[01:44:48] background NOP it did not it did
[01:44:51] not there we go
[01:44:54] let's get those over
[01:44:55] here now we do have our sorcery and our
[01:44:58] magic I play a lot of the both of them I
[01:45:00] haven't really decided which is
[01:45:03] necessarily my favorite because I have
[01:45:05] to say I like them both I'm a big fan of
[01:45:07] them both
[01:45:09] but I have to say magic being around for
[01:45:12] a long time and coming out with some of
[01:45:13] the uh the I know not everybody likes it
[01:45:17] the universe beyond stuff I think is
[01:45:19] drawing a lot of new people in or old
[01:45:21] people that had played before
[01:45:23] and are like oh wow this is out let me
[01:45:25] try that oh wow this is out let me try
[01:45:27] that and brings people back in so I
[01:45:29] think it's a good thing it's actually
[01:45:31] especially with like the way they're
[01:45:32] doing the foundations to get kind of
[01:45:34] like a basic thing for people too um so
[01:45:36] between that and the
[01:45:40] um and
[01:45:42] um Marvel coming out I think we're it's
[01:45:46] not it's it's worth it to I think it's
[01:45:48] worth it for people here it's going to
[01:45:50] bring more people in but the problem is
[01:45:53] I understand what everybody saying with
[01:45:54] Marvel they don't always get their cards
[01:45:56] so that does get frustrating if you're
[01:45:57] not going to be able to get things if
[01:45:59] it's going to start being like that like
[01:46:00] those all the time then yes you need it
[01:46:03] they're going to have to do a little bit
[01:46:04] of uh adjustments somewhere but as long
[01:46:06] as it's um they figure out how to do an
[01:46:09] adjustment after this one here this
[01:46:11] launch and they make it a little bit
[01:46:12] better then we'll then I think we'll be
[01:46:14] all right I think we'll be all right but
[01:46:18] let's uh let's
[01:46:20] see what we have for luck here on the
[01:46:24] rest of these got uh those left there
[01:46:27] just wanted to um get some of this out

[01:46:31] room some room here
[01:46:36] to packs for the rest of this stuff so I
[01:46:40] can see everything there we go that was
[01:46:42] on the left side there you
[01:46:45] go
[01:46:47] aha now let's see what we got
[01:46:51] left now we do have um just remember
[01:46:54] tomor tonight at 2:30 or this afternoon

[01:48:05] exceptional
[01:48:06] foil that's cool looking look at
[01:48:10] that that's pretty sweet I have to say
[01:48:13] one of the coolest things I like about
[01:48:14] it I think is probably that it has this
[01:48:18] you have that on the back of them and
[01:48:19] you can see the full art of it I like
[01:48:20] that a lot I'm a big fan of how they do
[01:48:22] that that way you can see the whole art
[01:48:24] of
[01:48:25] everything you don't see like you can
[01:48:27] see it behind you know get rid of the
[01:48:29] card you get to see all what they did
[01:48:30] the whole the whole thing the artist
[01:48:32] imagined and created for

[02:00:11] uh I'm going to take that I'll take a
[02:00:13] look at that right now and we'll let you
[02:00:16] know a lot of times the foils are the
[02:00:18] most and these ones are worth a couple
[02:00:19] bucks at the most but we'll see which is
[02:00:21] the nice thing about the um nonf foils
[02:00:24] they made it so that they're worth yeah
[02:00:26] they're worth a few bucks that you might
[02:00:27] be able to trade them and stuff like
[02:00:29] that but the foils are where your
[02:00:30] money's at and that's what I like about
[02:00:32] the game too it's not like you're going
[02:00:34] to get screwed because you'll never get
[02:00:36] anything good you can always buy
[02:00:38] something so let's figure it out here
[02:00:40] let's do
[02:00:41] it let's do cir
[02:00:45] K see as you see 23 cents not a giant
[02:00:49] hit but but let's do this
[02:00:54] ready see $22 in foil see that's why I
[02:00:57] like about what they do with that like
[02:00:58] they make it's actually 40 $60 is the
[02:01:01] market price look at that
[02:01:04] one there you
[02:01:08] go um where do I get those hey cord um
[02:01:14] eBay um eBay and um um Amazon I'm
[02:01:18] working with getting a distributor
[02:01:20] person that I can talk to maybe get some
[02:01:21] other ones through them but um if I mean
[02:01:24] if that's something that somebody would
[02:01:25] be interested in themselves I might be
[02:01:27] able to get some stuff more for others
[02:01:29] too so if you're hey High cord if you're
[02:01:31] looking for things like that let me know
[02:01:33] and I might be able to um get large
[02:01:36] quantities from another person to get
[02:01:38] some good deals for you all but let me
[02:01:40] know if that is something because I I
[02:01:42] had been talking to a couple
[02:01:43] Distributors uh or or um people from the
[02:01:49] show yeah all right yeah I'll have some
[02:01:51] that I can sell I definitely will have
[02:01:52] something that I can sell coming out
[02:01:55] soon yeah let me see what I can do one
[02:02:00] two
[02:02:02] three four all right let's see is this
[02:02:05] going to be nope no foil there so let's
[02:02:07] see what we
[02:02:09] get ominous owl rescue Shelly
[02:02:13] coat look out the ankl
[02:02:17] Squire Vikings Ark lightning Fisherman's
[02:02:21] family
[02:02:22] field
[02:02:23] [Music]
[02:02:24] labor Hunter Lodge hamlets Blaze our
[02:02:29] first exceptional is sword and shield
[02:02:31] all right to fairies for the second
[02:02:35] exceptional then a third is a Brier
[02:02:37] patch with a shape shift for our Elite
[02:02:40] which I've never seen this one either
[02:02:43] that's a new one too for me sorcery is
[02:02:46] kind of like magic and chess mixed
[02:02:50] together so a lot of the original artist
[02:02:52] a lot of the artists from sorcery are
[02:02:54] original Magic the Gathering artists
[02:02:57] that do handmade art which is why it
[02:02:59] feels similar or it feels like you've
[02:03:01] seen it before because it's actually a
[02:03:03] lot of Magic the Gathering artists that
[02:03:05] have done handmade art in the past and
[02:03:07] are still doing it and wanted to
[02:03:08] continue so they did it and picked it up
[02:03:10] with sorcery when it seemed like magic
[02:03:12] started going towards a lot more of the
[02:03:13] computer generated stuff so the big
[02:03:16] difference between them is more more or
[02:03:17] less um a lot of it says literally in
[02:03:20] the in a rule book it says use your
[02:03:22] common sense don't be a dick when you're
[02:03:24] playing one of the nice things I thought
[02:03:25] was kind of funny and then also um it's
[02:03:29] kind of like chess and Magic mixing
[02:03:31] together so the difference I'd say is
[02:03:33] you moving stuff around on a board like
[02:03:35] a chess board so you can place things
[02:03:37] and move things around to have defense
[02:03:39] and stuff like that which is the
[02:03:40] difference the biggest difference so
[02:03:42] like something can't get through if you
[02:03:44] put a defender in front versus maybe an
[02:03:46] Archer and back that can shoot from
[02:03:48] behind your person to the other way
[02:03:52] yes position of physical card does
[02:03:54] matter does matter that is
[02:03:59] correct
[02:04:01] one
[02:04:03] two three oh my here's a foil at the end
[02:04:06] four is it going to be the last pack of
[02:04:09] the Box a magical one here let's see

[02:05:06] here we'll throw that there in the backr
[02:05:07] on the top loader to protect that
[02:05:12] one how do you know if if it's a foil
[02:05:15] from behind yeah the the card you see
[02:05:19] there the full back of the card is a
[02:05:21] whole art of the card itself and then
[02:05:23] the foil side has this stuff with your
[02:05:25] with your you know your information
[02:05:26] written on it so yeah it's definitely um
[02:05:29] that's why you know it's a foil in the
[02:05:33] beginning um it would be curio uh I mean
[02:05:37] it would be a
[02:05:38] curiosa contested Realms maybe contested
[02:05:41] realm ER curiosa
[02:05:44] game it is was one that was a
[02:05:47] Kickstarter yes it was a Kickstarter
[02:05:49] High cord and it's been around for for
[02:05:52] since like 2023 I think is when the main
[02:05:55] things came
[02:05:56] out all right so let's see what pack was
[02:06:00] what side was the biggest what was our
[02:06:02] hit there yes I've actually been
[02:06:05] debating on doing it myself because I
[02:06:07] have a game idea all my games that I
[02:06:09] came up with somebody was like you
[02:06:10] should do some uh D and D things I'm
[02:06:12] like you know I play card games all the
[02:06:14] time I'm like you know what I changed it
[02:06:15] into being a card game so I actually
[02:06:17] have a whole rule book created for my
[02:06:19] own card game and I actually have um
[02:06:23] some prototypes that I've been working
[02:06:25] on for the cards so that we can do some
[02:06:28] um some uh play testing soon
[02:06:31] hopefully
[02:06:33] but I was going to do somebody told me I
[02:06:35] should run a Kickstarter I was just
[02:06:37] thinking of doing it from here and
[02:06:38] having fun but uh somebody said I should
[02:06:40] even do a Kickstarter myself and I
[02:06:41] didn't think about it might it might do
[02:06:43] it we don't know but all right so we're
[02:06:45] going to
[02:06:47] ask see well you don't need a NE after

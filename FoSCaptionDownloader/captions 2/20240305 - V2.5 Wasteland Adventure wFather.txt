[00:09:11] today with all you we're hopefully going

[00:09:16] something going this is your uh two
[00:09:17] strength to start your adventure through
[00:09:18] the Wasteland that's how you go there
[00:09:20] with your strength if you want to pick
[00:09:21] your own and I'm trying to get my camera
[00:09:24] in the right position
[00:09:27] here there we go believe that is the
[00:09:30] right position now so that you can see
[00:09:33] everything and you can pick your own
[00:09:35] right if you'd like I don't need to keep
[00:09:37] picking it for you you can tell me the
[00:09:39] strength of your character hope you guys
[00:09:40] are having some fun though this morning
[00:09:42] you're looking forward to hanging out
[00:09:43] for a little while for uh you know an
[00:09:46] hour or two well we uh before I get
[00:09:49] things going know depends actually I do
[00:09:51] have my
[00:09:52] uh my youngest is higher here with me
[00:09:55] today cuz he wasn't feeling great he had
[00:09:57] a he had a belly a yet
[00:09:59] yesterday and a headache so he's going
[00:10:02] to hang out with us for a little while
[00:10:04] today he's doing pretty good today but
[00:10:07] still had a headache so Mom said just
[00:10:09] keep him home
[00:10:11] so
[00:10:14] out he coming in that was probably the
[00:10:18] wrong thing to be saying there Caleb
[00:10:21] Darth I do appreciate that I'm going to
[00:10:24] put this on
[00:10:26] here if you guys want it yeah it is to

[00:10:32] Wasteland it'll go on
[00:10:36] for that
[00:10:39] there remember you pick your character

[00:10:53] going to be detective on your wandering

[00:16:48] Mondays are always this
[00:16:50] way right away we'll be a little bit a
[00:16:53] little while here and then I also had a
[00:16:54] little bit of Hiccup this morning which
[00:16:56] caused some
[00:16:57] problems but but now I'm back
[00:17:00] on which really sucks because people
[00:17:03] that would have been on hanging out with
[00:17:05] me we find somewhere else to go but
[00:17:08] we'll put this up here for two and a
[00:17:11] half
[00:17:13] strength hey BD how you doing maybe
[00:17:17] those uh maybe those will be nice for
[00:17:18] your your character on your way through
[00:17:20] the Wasteland you can pick one up
[00:17:22] whatever you want to be but we'll put
[00:17:23] those
[00:17:24] up for a uh price here of
[00:17:30] that and what I'm going to do I'm going
[00:17:32] to keep doing this until all my stuff is
[00:17:35] in as I've been doing the entire
[00:17:44] time all
[00:17:47] righty we'll see if this is anything
[00:17:49] that you guys are interested in this
[00:17:51] morning and remember we like to have fun
[00:17:54] here my kids wanted us to do these
[00:17:56] things we decided to create some nice
[00:17:58] animations they said it would be fun to
[00:18:01] have things like that for you to wander
[00:18:03] through your Wasteland adventure with so
[00:18:06] we did
[00:18:07] it some of you seem to have like it some
[00:18:09] of you didn't but this is what's up on
[00:18:10] screen here one two three packs these
[00:18:14] three right
[00:18:20] here there we go no one wants any of
[00:18:22] that we'll put it
[00:18:26] back all righty
[00:18:29] I'm going to have a I feel like today is
[00:18:32] going to be one of those days where I'm
[00:18:34] uh everyone is waiting just to fall out
[00:18:36] to come out so nothing's going to be
[00:18:38] done for a little while so I'm going to
[00:18:40] just hang out here doing my
[00:18:43] thing see what
[00:18:52] happens but maybe we'll be able to get
[00:18:54] some things done because not everybody's
[00:18:56] a big fan of the fallouts uh coming up
[00:18:58] know some people like it some people
[00:18:59] realize it's going to be ridiculously
[00:19:01] high price and they're not going to be
[00:19:02] able to get it so they don't even
[00:19:05] care and I've come to the conclusion
[00:19:08] it's going to be insane because it's
[00:19:09] going to be extremely hard to get and um
[00:19:13] there is a price of $1,000 per box set
[00:19:17] on PCG player by somebody and I have a
[00:19:20] feeling that those will be sold at some
[00:19:22] point in the not too distant
[00:19:24] future cuz someone is going to get those
[00:19:27] hey house how you doing today
[00:19:32] yeah I was checking TCG out for
[00:19:34] um for Fallout because I couldn't find
[00:19:38] it anywhere know I wanted to try to get

[00:21:45] adventure I don't
[00:21:48] know I know there's somebody that yeah
[00:21:51] there was one of the people that were in
[00:21:52] here hanging out yesterday that they
[00:21:53] said they had they that was their last
[00:21:55] day of work for the next week they're
[00:21:56] like an onoff person
[00:21:58] there were a nurse um and there was
[00:22:00] another person that I think had two
[00:22:01] weeks coming off cuz they work in the
[00:22:02] oil fields and they had two on two off
[00:22:05] thing that they didn't so that's all I
[00:22:07] was saying some people had the week off
[00:22:08] you know you work people work they have
[00:22:10] to work hard you know they go to work
[00:22:12] every day in that Barren Wasteland of
[00:22:14] the United States to get their
[00:22:17] money I
[00:22:19] know you know I I kind of grew up with
[00:22:21] my family like that my dad was a
[00:22:23] fisherman but he'd be gone for like
[00:22:25] anywhere from 2 weeks to two months set
[00:22:28] of time then he'd be back for maybe two
[00:22:30] weeks or a week so like I understand
[00:22:33] what that's like I had a friend that um
[00:22:35] not a friend more of an acquaintance
[00:22:37] that uh his um his dad was in The
[00:22:40] Merchant Marine so his dad would be gone
[00:22:42] for like 6 months and then he backed for
[00:22:44] six months so that was also an
[00:22:45] interesting one too so I don't know and
[00:22:47] then I mean I had friends that were
[00:22:49] their parent thrilling in the military
[00:22:51] and that was always different because
[00:22:52] they were never around but that was that
[00:22:55] a different scenario you know but yeah
[00:22:59] I know some people that have jobs like
[00:23:00] that we're going to start this one out
[00:23:02] here for you guys all right we're going
[00:23:05] to do this if you would like to start
[00:23:07] for one and a half strength in your
[00:23:09] adventure through the Wasteland maybe

[00:23:21] drop I don't
[00:23:23] know it's up to you and I'm almost done

[00:26:01] following packs if they would like
[00:26:05] but
[00:26:07] [Applause]
[00:26:08] for the dgen one we could do one of
[00:26:12] these I know people are going to hate me
[00:26:14] for ripping something that
[00:26:16] old but there we go deal that's what it
[00:26:18] was going to be here we do a giby here

[00:26:35] start having them prepared a little bit
[00:26:36] more frequently but let me get this in
[00:26:38] here and let me put that up here for a
[00:26:41] little giby for the

[00:27:02] here we can do a de on any of these if
[00:27:06] you want to take it home you'll take one
[00:27:08] of these two home all right because
[00:27:10] people ask you D and I think it's
[00:27:12] interesting that they do so if they want
[00:27:15] to that's what it'll be this will be the
[00:27:17] D one definitely or any of these two or

[00:27:28] you that don't understand or know our
[00:27:30] little game here you pick your character
[00:27:32] as been up on the board here then you do
[00:27:34] something and you wander through the
[00:27:35] Wast in you collect strength or lose
[00:27:39] strength depending on what happens to
[00:27:40] your character and then you get to the
[00:27:41] end and you fight a boss now if you
[00:27:44] happen to beat the boss and come out on
[00:27:46] top maybe you're going to be the one
[00:27:49] that ends up having beating the boss and
[00:27:51] having the boss drop some loot now when
[00:27:53] the boss drops loot that is a spin of a
[00:27:56] either set booster wheel wheel or a
[00:27:57] collector booster wheel
[00:28:00] hey
[00:28:02] Jupiter yeah Nick Nick knows it he had
[00:28:05] some good luck with it and then if you
[00:28:07] happen to uh lose against the boss you
[00:28:10] end up going having to stumble back to
[00:28:11] the Vault where you get a pull from
[00:28:15] here now with that being said we're
[00:28:18] going to put up one two strength for

[00:38:23] two strength three Adventure through the
[00:38:25] Wasteland
[00:38:30] and you get to uh potentially win a free
[00:38:34] booster pack or a free set pack if you
[00:38:36] beat the boss or if you don't beat the
[00:38:38] boss that's okay you always get a trip
[00:38:41] to the Vault where you stumble back and
[00:38:43] you get something pulled out remember
[00:38:45] save my show on the 20 uh for the eth
[00:38:47] because that one we what we'll be doing
[00:38:50] in the morning there is we'll have a
[00:38:51] little special Vault and uh there maybe
[00:38:53] there'll be some extra things we can do
[00:38:54] extra hey stretch how you doing come
[00:38:56] coming in thanks for coming in Eternal
[00:38:58] witness thank you all for having a good
[00:39:02] morning look at that beautiful
[00:39:06] man sometimes thank you I haven't shaved
[00:39:09] recently though I shaved actually the
[00:39:11] other day because I I uh I trimmed my
[00:39:13] beard and happened to go to like a low
[00:39:15] it poed down to like the low setting by
[00:39:17] accident like a mother fuer so I had to
[00:39:21] go like shave it you look like a bear
[00:39:25] can you run us through the Wasteland
[00:39:27] Adventure Z car definitely not an not a
[00:39:30] problem at all all right we're going to
[00:39:31] give you this as an example here for
[00:39:33] everybody that's hanging out all right
[00:39:35] you would pick your packs say you pick
[00:39:37] these it tells you right there at the
[00:39:38] top how much strength you get per one
[00:39:41] soever the special ones you get one
[00:39:43] strength and each of the other ones you
[00:39:44] get half of strength so this is one two
[00:39:46] strength for your character to start off
[00:39:49] now you would pick one of four
[00:39:51] characters that you go through the
[00:39:52] Wasteland with and then what happens is
[00:39:54] is you wander through the Wasteland and
[00:39:55] you pick up there's three there's only
[00:39:57] three boxes here we can't do too many
[00:39:59] but there's three boxes here and it's
[00:40:01] one plus one strength on each one of
[00:40:03] those plus or minus one strength on each
[00:40:05] of these three boxes um and then at the
[00:40:07] end if you have enough you could
[00:40:09] potentially beat any of the one
[00:40:13] two three
[00:40:16] four or five bosses depending on how
[00:40:21] much strength you have like say you
[00:40:24] decided you wanted to buy three of The
[00:40:26] Collector boosters of um Commander
[00:40:30] Masters each one of those are two
[00:40:31] strength each you could potentially come
[00:40:33] out with seven strength and beat one of
[00:40:36] these T-Rex guys you wouldn't be able to
[00:40:38] beat the other ones but You' be able to
[00:40:40] beat these now what would happen here if
[00:40:42] you come out with other kind of know two
[00:40:44] three strength you beat Mei you would
[00:40:46] get a run of the set booster wheel and
[00:40:49] if you have four strength where you can
[00:40:51] beat the Velociraptor four higher you
[00:40:53] get a set booster wheel because that's
[00:40:54] what they drop as they're um they are
[00:40:57] loot when they get hit by the
[00:40:59] boss and the show notes definitely
[00:41:02] explain it all too definitely that was a
[00:41:04] quick rundown of it for you for those
[00:41:06] that want a little quick rundown and
[00:41:08] then if you lose and the boss beats you
[00:41:10] you go to the Vault here all right and
[00:41:11] in the vault what happens is you um you
[00:41:14] get just a pick from The Vault and we'll
[00:41:15] see what happens and hey maybe you
[00:41:17] decide you want to be a technician and

[00:42:10] me this morning because he had a little

[00:42:20] so uh he's hanging out with us for the
[00:42:22] day at the moment he was watching some
[00:42:24] TV out in the living room while I uh do
[00:42:26] my thing here in the office for a little
[00:42:28] while till my workday begins we're going
[00:42:31] to put this up here though one and a
[00:42:32] half strength for those that want to
[00:42:33] wander through the Wasteland choose what

[00:42:59] here and remember yes check the show
[00:43:01] notes and it will explain the adventure
[00:43:03] remember you will end up coming out
[00:43:05] either with something from the vault
[00:43:07] which uh currently is um the potential
[00:43:10] of a couple of cards that are worth like
[00:43:11] three to5 or just other cards that are
[00:43:14] in there on the eighth though the cool
[00:43:16] thing that's going to be occurring is I
[00:43:18] have something else in the vault that
[00:43:20] people are going to be very interested
[00:43:21] in should um when the release is here
[00:43:23] and I'm able to do everything that I

[00:49:57] ah crap I don't have those ah whatever
[00:49:59] we'll change those for the sets

[01:00:42] going to go you got a mystery booster
[01:00:45] which like I said I'm waiting for those
[01:00:46] to come in you got an AFR set and
[01:00:48] another AFR set so mystery
[01:00:53] boosters you get a choice of one of
[01:00:56] these two when there's a mystery booster
[01:00:59] all right now I can switch these back
[01:01:00] and try it again or it's up to you what
[01:01:03] you'd like to do if you want to stay
[01:01:04] with two AR
[01:01:13] sets switch the buyer all right put the
[01:01:17] buyer back
[01:01:20] here put the buyer right there and take
[01:01:24] that up the buyer and with the buyer we
[01:01:27] have an oh look at that you get a choice
[01:01:29] because we're out of those ones there we
[01:01:32] are like I said I'm going to have more
[01:01:34] of those coming in though they were
[01:01:35] supposed to come in last week they
[01:01:36] didn't for whatever reason so here you
[01:01:39] go here is your choice right
[01:01:42] now I think I probably didn't pay
[01:01:45] attention to ordering it right those are
[01:01:47] your choices for the ioria
[01:01:50] ones waiting on stock to come in
[01:01:53] sometimes shipping takes a while while
[01:01:54] longer than I
[01:01:57] expect what can you do at least I give
[01:01:59] you option here because the games when
[01:02:01] it comes out with that I'd rather than
[01:02:03] like war war there you
[01:02:06] go and then for the first one you never
[01:02:09] told me which one you wanted to go with
[01:02:10] because uh the mystery booster is not

[01:09:00] are there you go there's those four all
[01:09:05] right four play boosters we'll get you
[01:09:07] two strength as You Adventure through
[01:09:09] the
[01:09:11] Wasteland maybe you're going to come out
[01:09:13] on top we'll find
[01:09:15] out but I will pull this out
[01:09:18] here get our adventure back out since
[01:09:21] that's what we're talking about put our
[01:09:24] box back there we're going to turn it
[01:09:25] around actually help so we know which
[01:09:27] one and that doesn't matter we're going
[01:09:29] to put the F on take out our Wasteland
[01:09:33] Vault and there we
[01:09:36] go 22 they are different pricing
[01:09:41] though the uh these are a little higher
[01:09:44] AFR are $6 a pack and these are a little
[01:09:48] bit higher these are $7 a pack so
[01:09:52] um that's why why they were that price
[01:09:55] do you
[01:09:56] want no no these are is the pricing on
[01:09:59] that wrong cuz they are supposed to be
[01:10:02] $7 my pricing might be wrong up there is
[01:10:06] it wrong up there hold on let me
[01:10:13] see look at that I have to um it should
[01:10:17] have been seven I don't know why that's
[01:10:18] not seven dang it in the buy now it
[01:10:22] is that's it is in the buy now but you
[01:10:24] know what because I made a mistake on
[01:10:27] this one I will do one of them like this
[01:10:29] cuz whenever I make a
[01:10:31] mistake that person that comes out on
[01:10:33] top gets the first one that's the
[01:10:35] correction all right you got it there
[01:10:38] and I made the
[01:10:40] mistake I made the
[01:10:44] mistake so that's what I try to I try to
[01:10:47] be and now I'm going to adjust it now
[01:10:50] I'm going to adjust it now I will adjust
[01:10:53] it now so it is not going to be the same
[01:10:55] after
[01:10:57] this that's why the other one was 22 cuz
[01:11:00] they were lower but let me adjust it now
[01:11:02] for it after this it's not going to be
[01:11:05] here but we're going to get you're going
[01:11:06] to run this for a minute here you're
[01:11:08] going to give me give me a minute but
[01:11:09] there we
[01:11:10] go you found the deal of the day every
[01:11:13] now and
[01:11:14] again I have a mistake and there's a
[01:11:16] deal of day and you got it
[01:11:21] today now some sometimes that deal day
[01:11:25] is purposely done as a
[01:11:27] mistake some people have figured that
[01:11:29] out before not all the time this one
[01:11:31] wasn't this one was an actual honest
[01:11:33] mistake I didn't realize I had that
[01:11:34] there but I'm going to correct it
[01:11:36] anyways right
[01:11:41] now there we go correct
[01:11:45] that then
[01:11:52] here
[01:11:56] that
[01:11:59] that that
[01:12:02] that
[01:12:05] that there you go that should be
[01:12:07] corrected now and you got the deal this
[01:12:10] time because I made the mistake on it
[01:12:13] like I said guys if I make a mistake I
[01:12:15] honor what I make the mistake on it's my
[01:12:17] fault it's not your
[01:12:20] fault
[01:12:22] but sometimes they do things by accident
[01:12:25] on purpose if that makes any
[01:12:29] sense all right here we
[01:12:33] go one two three one two strength for
[01:12:36] your character as You Adventure through
[01:12:38] the Wasteland here I made my correction
[01:12:39] we're good now anything other than Carlo
[01:12:43] I have so much Carlo I have War the
[01:12:46] spark I have Exelon I have uh Matt Miss
[01:12:50] Commander Masters boosters I have um
[01:12:54] some dungeon dragons so there we
[01:12:58] go going to be a mutant and random for
[01:13:01] everything all right as a mutant you go
[01:13:03] wandering through the
[01:13:05] Wasteland checking out some things you
[01:13:09] pick some things up you drop them the
[01:13:11] first thing you pick up you drop you go
[01:13:13] I don't think that's a good one then you
[01:13:14] go and you decide you know what I'm
[01:13:15] going to pick something else up and when
[01:13:16] we do random here I like to kind of do
[01:13:18] it like this we're going to see which
[01:13:19] one comes out here oh this is what we're
[01:13:21] getting all right the mutant picks
[01:13:24] something up and goes oh let me take a
[01:13:25] bite out of this goes oh no my tooth
[01:13:28] that's treasure that is no good ow and
[01:13:31] they go when they lose one strength as
[01:13:34] they're wandering through the Wasteland
[01:13:35] because they only have one tooth to eat
[01:13:38] with now because they've broken so many
[01:13:40] of them as a mutant they go wandering
[01:13:42] through they go oh no maybe I'm going to
[01:13:45] f stumble upon a friend that will help
[01:13:47] me along the way let's see what happens
[01:13:50] maybe this friend or an item will help
[01:13:52] me along on the way and you come across
[01:13:56] a
[01:13:57] clue and as a mutant
[01:14:01] Clues are not helpful because they look
[01:14:04] at them and they go I don't understand
[01:14:05] what's going on here buddy what is this
[01:14:08] thing this thing doesn't make sense it's
[01:14:11] it's like gold but it's got writing on
[01:14:15] it I can't eat it my other tooth are
[01:14:17] already broken I I got to put that down
[01:14:19] that doesn't help me I'm so tired I have
[01:14:21] no strength as I wander through the
[01:14:23] Wasteland but you know what maybe you'll
[01:14:25] stumble AC upon a friend or an item a
[01:14:28] friend that will help you maybe a fungus
[01:14:30] dinosaur will come across as a mutant
[01:14:33] and pick you up to wander through the
[01:14:34] Wasteland they're
[01:14:37] clueless I like
[01:14:38] it maybe there will be a fungus dinosaur
[01:14:42] you can stumble across to help you
[01:14:43] through the Wasteland here we're going
[01:14:45] to go with you know they're actually all
[01:14:47] spread out pretty good actually this one
[01:14:49] this one's standing out a little bit
[01:14:51] you're going through the Wasteland and
[01:14:53] you you come across a creature this
[01:14:55] creature happens to be a friend a foe
[01:14:59] we're not sure yet as what we're going
[01:15:02] to do is we're going to flip that over
[01:15:03] and oh no thror comes out starts buzzing
[01:15:06] around taking out buzzing at your head
[01:15:09] you D dive down hit your head on a rock
[01:15:11] knock yourself out and now you're
[01:15:14] standing there barely functioning as NE

[01:32:18] can pick your character's Adventure as
[01:32:20] you travel through this way land and we
[01:32:22] do this for shipping cuz it keeps them
[01:32:24] tight in the package and the top loader
[01:32:25] so they don't fall out it keeps the top
[01:32:27] loader stiff so that's why we do that
[01:32:30] this
[01:32:31] way hopefully we're having a good
[01:32:34] morning everybody I'm going to have to
[01:32:35] do this now let's make that bigger there

[01:32:51] come out with the boss dropping loot for
[01:32:54] you is it going to be a collector
[01:32:56] booster or a set booster I don't know it
[01:32:59] depends on what happens and if you come
[01:33:01] out on top beating the boss maybe it's
[01:33:04] going to be a trip back to the Vault
[01:33:06] where you have to hide and recuperate
[01:33:08] from your adventures in the
[01:33:10] Wasteland no problem
[01:33:13] stretch I do not have Japanese war the
[01:33:16] smart I have just um the American if you
[01:33:20] want Japanese actually looked at getting
[01:33:22] some Japanese
[01:33:24] um boxes are people interested in those
[01:33:28] cuz I was I was actually thinking get on
[01:33:30] them cuz I like the rate in them pull
[01:33:34] rate in them obviously everybody does
[01:33:36] but I didn't know if anyone like that
[01:33:37] idea I could do that I was debating on
[01:33:40] picking on some of them up and stretch
[01:33:43] let me get you set
[01:33:47] up here we go nice hit buddy
[01:33:52] but uh Q magic it's not Japanese it's
[01:33:54] just so if you want them I can put the
[01:33:56] um I can put them in here for a war of
[01:33:58] the spark if you'd like do do those
[01:34:00] throw uh three of those up four of those
[01:34:02] up I will do up you can do up to three
[01:34:05] strength to your character in The
[01:34:07] Adventure in the Wasteland I don't mind
[01:34:08] doing that the only way you can get more
[01:34:10] though is if you happen to buy a Lord of
[01:34:13] the Rings original collector booster or
[01:34:15] Commander Masters cuz Commander Masters
[01:34:17] is worth two and Lord of the Rings
[01:34:19] original is worth one and a half and
[01:34:21] there you go buddy you going to pull for
[01:34:22] the vault though then that one wasn't
[01:34:25] bad there your Soul's attended do you
[01:34:26] have any of those to burn too cuz I have
[01:34:28] a ton of those to burn
[01:34:30] stretch all right see you later
[01:34:33] buddy have a good day Jupiter hopefully
[01:34:35] you feel
[01:34:40] better that or explore yes explore
[01:34:44] that's it Q magic is that what you'd
[01:34:45] like me to do put some uh War of the
[01:34:47] spark up I can do that for you not a
[01:34:50] problem but these are what we have for
[01:34:52] our pack deals at the moment if you
[01:34:54] would like them that is now what I'm
[01:34:56] going to do next here is I'm going to
[01:34:58] find something for you guys I will put
[01:35:00] up some more of the spark if that's what
[01:35:02] you're looking for I just uh just would
[01:35:04] like to know per make sure then I'm
[01:35:07] going to find something different at the
[01:35:08] moment let's see
[01:35:10] here what we got going on we'll put some
[01:35:14] packs up and you guys can pick your own
[01:35:15] it is not me picking it it is you
[01:35:18] picking it and what I'm going to do is
[01:35:19] when I get my stuff for Fallout we'll be
[01:35:22] doing some adventures with Fallout now
[01:35:25] the adventures with Fallout we'll have
[01:35:27] our packs of Fallout involved because
[01:35:28] I'm going to have um hopefully three
[01:35:31] boxes right away and then I should
[01:35:34] hopefully have another 12 coming in in
[01:35:36] the beginning of the week if
[01:35:39] um have not been canceled yet hasn't
[01:35:42] been canceled yet that's the only reason
[01:35:43] I'm saying it everything else has been
[01:35:45] I've had other ones that were canceled
[01:35:46] right away and that's the only reason
[01:35:47] I'm saying the other ones might be
[01:35:48] coming in so we'll see if I get lucky
[01:35:51] and I get everything here maybe we can
[01:35:53] all have some fun um fun in the
[01:35:55] Wasteland for a little while
[01:35:58] here we'll do this
[01:36:02] for that if you want
[01:36:05] it that'll get you two strength as You
[01:36:07] Adventure through the
[01:36:10] Wasteland all right Q magic not a
[01:36:13] problem yeah it was uh it's not Japanese
[01:36:15] and if um yeah I didn't know if people
[01:36:17] were interested in Japanese ones cuz I
[01:36:18] had actually thought about getting some
[01:36:21] uh at some point but you know not
[01:36:22] everybody is interested in it but here
[01:36:24] this will get you you can pick your
[01:36:26] character that's going to be one two
[01:36:27] strength as You Adventure through the
[01:36:29] Wasteland you will pick your character
[01:36:31] and um maybe you're going to come out on
[01:36:33] top beating the boss like our Bud Mike
[01:36:35] did earlier that'll be pretty cool
[01:36:38] that'll be pretty cool I'm going put
[01:36:40] those back
[01:36:41] here and I'm going to add a
[01:36:45] new thing new stuff here had some new
[01:36:51] stuff stuff here here we go
[01:36:55] this we did some we're going to do
[01:36:58] this here the this is what we're going
[01:37:00] to do it's going to get you two strength
[01:37:02] also as you wander through the Wasteland
[01:37:05] but I'm going to put that right there so
[01:37:06] I can finish getting the Wasteland
[01:37:08] finish being set up and put our cards
[01:37:09] away there that will get you two
[01:37:11] strength as you wander through the
[01:37:15] Wasteland and that will be this
[01:37:20] here
[01:37:25] for those
[01:37:27] three set or play boosters whatever you
[01:37:30] want to call those that are available
[01:37:32] that's going to get you two strength as
[01:37:33] you wander through the
[01:37:35] Wasteland
[01:37:40] maybe no it's not 19 for all three the
[01:37:44] three of these should be 31 up
[01:37:49] there uh qat magic whatever is there for
[01:37:52] a starting price is uh is just a
[01:37:55] placeholder because I I mean I could put
[01:37:57] the starting price at like a million
[01:37:59] dollars but it's whatever it happened to
[01:38:01] be at the last time that was bought the
[01:38:03] day before it's weird I've noticed the
[01:38:06] last thing that was bought the day
[01:38:07] before ends up being the amount that was
[01:38:08] in there the morning the next morning
[01:38:11] like one day somebody's like dude those
[01:38:12] packs aren't $78 I'm like what are you
[01:38:14] talking about it was because somebody
[01:38:15] had bought like a I think they bought
[01:38:17] like couple CL roosters of Lord of the
[01:38:19] Rings so that's why it's just whatever
[01:38:21] the last thing is there and that's why I
[01:38:22] put the prices up always for the
[01:38:24] adventure uh right away and that's why I
[01:38:26] like to put the prices up also like this
[01:38:29] so you guys can see him but no this one
[01:38:31] here was
[01:38:32] uh
[01:38:34] 31 yes yeah it just it just it'll pop up
[01:38:38] it'll correct it for you when I put it
[01:38:39] up it's just what happened to whatever
[01:38:41] happened to me the last one that was
[01:38:42] there it's interesting or weird whatever
[01:38:45] you want to call it now does somebody
[01:38:48] would would somebody want something like
[01:38:49] this I have a I have a couple of those
[01:38:51] I got them actually for me to think of B
[01:38:53] opening and playing with but um that's
[01:38:56] also I was going to do it with the
[01:38:58] family at one day but um I didn't know
[01:39:00] if anybody wanted
[01:39:02] those we got this I'll put this up
[01:39:06] here let's start out with two strength
[01:39:09] for your adventure in the Wasteland if

[01:41:40] just rip those open you know that is
[01:41:43] always an option guys I don't need to
[01:41:45] just I don't need to do a game that's
[01:41:47] there because it's fun but you don't
[01:41:49] need to do it
[01:41:51] they don't need to do it there we go
[01:41:52] we're going to put that up son Eric
[01:41:55] thanks for coming in skull do appreciate
[01:42:00] it all right we're going to put these up
[01:42:02] here for what is
[01:42:04] [Music]
[01:42:08] that here we
[01:42:12] go for those
[01:42:14] three get you two and a half strength as
[01:42:16] You Adventure through the
[01:42:19] Wasteland
[01:42:21] the floor is anything that would be a
[01:42:24] car that could be 10 cents or higher I
[01:42:27] know it's a really ridiculous floor I
[01:42:28] didn't even want to do this game and the
[01:42:30] H and the ceiling the ceiling is
[01:42:34] um is a whole collector booster box of
[01:42:37] Lord of the
[01:42:39] Rings that was a I did not have anything
[01:42:42] big to put in for a card that somebody
[01:42:44] said just put a collector Booster Box in
[01:42:46] and it was originally going to be like
[01:42:48] murder one but then they're like you
[01:42:50] know what you should do it like this
[01:42:51] instead and make it bigger and put
[01:42:54] something bigger in it I'm like I don't
[01:42:56] know I was only going to do like 500 and
[01:42:58] put in like murders and something no you
[01:43:00] need to make it bigger I'm like oh all
[01:43:02] right so I put something bigger in and
[01:43:05] it's like but that means there's going
[01:43:06] to be like, 1600 cards like that's okay
[01:43:09] this is just like the big long shot
[01:43:10] thing I'm like all right so I built it I
[01:43:13] put it in there that's what the two
[01:43:15] sides here of the red button are um I
[01:43:19] actually literally say with the red
[01:43:21] button if you look at what the red
[01:43:22] button says ready it's going to tell you
[01:43:25] right there I'm pinning it and you're
[01:43:26] even going to say the description says
[01:43:27] do not press the red button because I
[01:43:30] personally don't think it's a uh I don't
[01:43:32] think
[01:43:37] it's that light and that's what it is
[01:43:41] maybe you'll get lucky and you're G to
[01:43:43] go off and take out a satellite get
[01:43:45] yourself a free pack that's in there or
[01:43:47] maybe we don't have the moon set up yet
[01:43:49] because I have other things that I was
[01:43:51] doing for the this show to get it ready
[01:43:53] but maybe you're going to go and you're
[01:43:54] going to go down crashing back down to
[01:43:56] earth with just some cars but you do
[01:43:58] have pack potential of getting some
[01:43:59] cards that are in there that are like a
[01:44:01] dollar or near a dollar so that you kind
[01:44:03] of get some of your money back when
[01:44:04] you're getting the cards it's not that
[01:44:05] you're going always get one that's cheap
[01:44:07] but most of them are between 10 and 50
[01:44:12] cents it was because you guys wanted it
[01:44:14] and requested I think I just did that I
[01:44:16] literally just did
[01:44:19] that
[01:44:21] going to do this
[01:44:23] instead we do that instead so that's all
[01:44:26] that's how that red button goes there I
[01:44:29] uh yeah I built it because it was
[01:44:31] requested that's really what it was so
[01:44:35] I'm going to put game back on for those
[01:44:37] that may want it and my thought was it
[01:44:39] was going to be something like this like
[01:44:41] someone would do this thing here like we
[01:44:44] have a big blue book someone would have
[01:44:46] done the big blue book
[01:44:48] and some polls they like add some pulls
[01:44:51] in from the red button not just hey give
[01:44:55] me some red button so like this we have
[01:44:57] this is a spin you get 89 81 spots the
[01:45:00] ceiling is a balin's tomb which has not
[01:45:02] been pulled out of here yet but every
[01:45:04] spot that is a clear spot with a car
[01:45:06] that had been pulled becomes multiple
[01:45:08] packs of cards whether it's SE it's like
[01:45:10] like some of the SE booes or um or it
[01:45:13] could be uh one of the other things that
[01:45:14] we have of a premium card back I mean um
[01:45:17] now the other thing is like so I was
[01:45:18] figuring you'd get this and add in some
[01:45:21] red red buttons to it type
[01:45:23] thing not people are going to be like
[01:45:25] give me the red button so that's kind of
[01:45:28] where we are Cody thank Frederick coming
[01:45:30] in so we're going to put this so up here
[01:45:32] right now if you want to go on an
[01:45:33] adventure through the
[01:45:35] Wasteland this is going to go on here
[01:45:37] for this that's not correct
[01:45:43] one these three are going to go on for
[01:45:46] this and this is going to start you out
[01:45:47] with one and a half strength and your
[01:45:50] potential to get a free pack if you
[01:45:53] happen to beat the boss at the end of
[01:45:55] the adventure through the

[01:49:19] what's going to happen actually
[01:49:20] is this is going to sit people can pick
[01:49:22] out one or two and it's either going to
[01:49:23] snipe um when I'm doing the um Fallout
[01:49:27] stuff on Fallout day because there's
[01:49:29] going to be people in here or it's going
[01:49:32] to wait and it's going to sit here
[01:49:33] because no one's going to touch it much
[01:49:35] and when that box of um Lord of the
[01:49:37] Rings hits like $700 some going be give
[01:49:39] me the whole right side and that's what
[01:49:41] I think is going to end up happening

[01:49:44] happening what doing oh

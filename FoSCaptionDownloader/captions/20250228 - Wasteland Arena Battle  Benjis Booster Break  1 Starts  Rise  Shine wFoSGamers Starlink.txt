[00:20:21] the ghoul you have to have a 16 or
[00:20:24] higher on your roll to hit with your
[00:20:26] attack and then because you only have a

[00:20:43] see what happens what are you going to
[00:20:44] do you want to attack you don't want to
[00:20:46] run away so you just don't have to worry
[00:20:47] about it up to you my friend but we will

[00:21:24] which is a critical hit on you that
[00:21:27] means that ghoul swiped at you
[00:21:29] the ghoul swipes at you scratches you
[00:21:33] bringing you down it's going to double

[00:21:50] with our adventuring people
[00:22:03] that means you're at 92 out of 100
[00:22:06] health and you have rad
[00:22:19] poisoning then you also have
[00:22:23] pistol and a knife because that's what
[00:22:26] you start with

[00:23:00] not looking at yours let me change
[00:23:04] that sometimes when you type in places
[00:23:06] it doesn't go in the right
[00:23:09] one so that means it still means you
[00:23:12] miss though the two does not help the AR

[01:37:26] of the four who's going to take
[01:37:29] him which we'll see there's only four of
[01:37:31] them left for the Wasteland
[01:37:33] Adventure Mark Henry coming
[01:37:36] in with an anrod remastered and oh
[01:37:43] nice there's anything that have to do
[01:37:45] with luck all right but they as a pirate
[01:37:48] they are a 16 for the damage to hit them
[01:37:51] so you have to roll a 16 but you get two
[01:37:54] rolls this turn because you have the
[01:37:55] glitch reality from your last one so you
[01:37:58] have to decide are you going to attack
[01:37:59] these
[01:38:00] Pirates Alchemist greeting blazing torch

[01:38:24] [Â __Â ] all right let's see if I have the
[01:38:26] uh Pirates over
[01:38:30] here I don't think I have actually no I
[01:38:32] do not have the Pirates over there it's
[01:38:34] on the other computer ah dang it you're
[01:38:36] going to attack with the sword I like it
[01:38:40] Mark Mark the size of attack with a
[01:38:43] sword which is a plus five and on a 16
[01:38:46] character so you get to attack first you
[01:38:49] have the sword which gives you two here
[01:38:52] we go we're going to roll
[01:38:54] oh we're going to zoom out oh you missed
[01:38:56] on the first one cuz you only got eight
[01:38:58] and 5 plus 8 does not help you at 16 so
[01:39:00] you not C you got two rolls and you got
[01:39:02] 19 that time which gives you a critical
[01:39:06] one because it puts you in the 20 air so
[01:39:08] that means you doubles this for you so
[01:39:11] you end up doing four damage to it and
[01:39:14] that is only a 25 to the character but
[01:39:17] they attack you
[01:39:19] back they only have a pistol though uhoh

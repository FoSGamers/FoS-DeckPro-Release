[00:06:57] how's it going
[00:06:58] everyone yeah was approved yesterday so
[00:07:00] I was getting into was I was approved
[00:07:01] Yesterday by the insurance the guy was
[00:07:03] worried about us um you know see like I
[00:07:05] don't I haven't had a big boat like that
[00:07:07] before like not having to be able to get
[00:07:09] insurance for it and like I need a
[00:07:12] captain or whatever because it's a large
[00:07:13] boat well they came back like yeah
[00:07:15] you're good like what do you mean you're
[00:07:17] good like yeah you're good like the
[00:07:19] insurance is really low too compared to
[00:07:20] what I expected it to be like it's this
[00:07:23] same amount as my small boat I like son
[00:07:25] of a
[00:07:26] [ __ ] but I I guess like I mean I've had
[00:07:29] my boat voting license since I was 14 so
[00:07:31] I used to drive a boat around before I
[00:07:33] was um able to drive a car and I used to
[00:07:35] tow people around on a boat in a tube by
[00:07:37] myself because I was the responsible mod
[00:07:38] my mom didn't like to do it she felt
[00:07:40] uncomfortable driving people she
[00:07:41] couldn't she couldn't calculate the
[00:07:42] movement of the boat so I was driving a
[00:07:44] an 18 foot boat tone people on the back
[00:07:46] bit on tubes when I was 12 years old so
[00:07:48] like I know how to use a boat and I've
[00:07:49] been driving one of those things for
[00:07:50] years now all the way progressed up to
[00:07:52] helping my dad with his like 40 41 to 42
[00:07:55] foot boat going through like channels
[00:07:57] and even out to like George's bank and
[00:07:58] [ __ ] every now and again so I have some
[00:08:00] knowledge and everything it's just I
[00:08:02] never thought of it like that you know
[00:08:05] all right no one wanted the mystery bags
[00:08:07] we have a lot of good stuff out there
[00:08:08] check that out if you want your own um

[00:17:20] Sprint stores for uh I don't know like
[00:17:26] um five years or something like that now
[00:17:29] I think it was back in the back
[00:17:31] then and no maybe it was only three and
[00:17:33] a half I it was like three and a half
[00:17:35] actually anyway I managed a few of the
[00:17:37] stores and I realize some things with
[00:17:39] retail that you learn you learn like not
[00:17:40] everything is gonna work out one
[00:17:44] two people are smarter than you
[00:17:47] think and if you if you try to take them
[00:17:50] as being an idiot they will never do
[00:17:52] they'll never do anything with you two
[00:17:55] put the effort in most of the time if
[00:17:56] you're nice you're going to get a person
[00:17:57] that'll come back and stuff so you have
[00:17:59] your silan G sh

[00:18:07] there is a pack fresh one I just put it
[00:18:09] out there that's the lowest I can do for

[00:18:12] they cut money out of stuff and that's
[00:18:14] they L they allow me

[01:30:38] Naruto themed one would that be things
[01:30:40] that you guys would be interested in
[01:30:42] buying like if we did a chunk of them
[01:30:44] and like put them out as some of them as

[01:30:48] buy them type thing like if he built if
[01:30:51] we built some cards and like showed you
[01:30:52] what they were going to be and then
[01:30:54] kind of went and I don't made the

[01:32:38] year and then some stuff happened and I
[01:32:39] wasn't able to continue teaching there
[01:32:40] just because the um kids got kicked out
[01:32:43] of school and they didn't have the money
[01:32:44] to pay me so I ended up moving into
[01:32:47] that's when I got to working at Sprint

[01:38:46] six people because it was the
[01:38:48] Alternative High School I put it this
[01:38:49] way I had a chair thrown at me at one
[01:38:51] point so
[01:38:54] that's kind of the [ __ ] that I dealt
[01:38:59] with I'm G to put this out for a yeah
[01:39:03] yeah he got upset that he didn't get
[01:39:05] something right and I told him you can't
[01:39:06] get it right if you don't study for it
[01:39:09] and I know you didn't study because you
[01:39:10] were talking to them over there when we
[01:39:11] were supposed to be studying and I kept
[01:39:13] going over and saying stuff to you and
[01:39:14] he's like yeah well dude I'm not gonna
[01:39:16] do he's gonna get just going to get
[01:39:18] kicked me out I'm like I can't give you
[01:39:19] a grade just because you want it and he
[01:39:22] threw a chair at I that was one of my
[01:39:24] times I was like I felt like [ __ ]
[01:39:25] Superman like oh [ __ ] caught it like
[01:39:29] midair it's one of the craziest things
[01:39:32] ever but
[01:39:34] anyways no Ruby medallion for
[01:39:39] anyone yeah I
[01:39:42] know I was also 25 at the time so I had
[01:39:45] a little bit more strength and Agility
[01:39:46] than I did now than I do
[01:39:48] now we'll put a spy Master's Vault out
[01:39:58] yeah I taught um biology in um in uh
[01:40:04] algebra at the
[01:40:06] school is what it
[01:40:09] was I I felt bad mostly for the kids
[01:40:11] most of the time because uh there's a
[01:40:14] lot of like they had a lot of um
[01:40:17] stigmatism on them that they didn't
[01:40:19] necessarily need for half of them just
[01:40:20] because they were in there a lot of them
[01:40:22] were there because
[01:40:24] family things like one of them was there
[01:40:26] because his mom had Alzheimer's and
[01:40:27] couldn't even remember him so he pretty
[01:40:29] much raised himself while his dad worked
[01:40:32] like he lived on like frozen dinners so
[01:40:34] so I mean like kids like that would get
[01:40:36] this bad rap he tried hard but he just
[01:40:39] didn't have
[01:40:40] resources so when we helped him and he
[01:40:42] did well and he went up to the high
[01:40:43] school the teachers were like no you
[01:40:45] don't know that you're just going to
[01:40:46] draw like a penis on the board I'm not
[01:40:47] going to let you draw answer that math
[01:40:49] question I actually had to talk to the
[01:40:51] principal guys you need to talk to these
[01:40:52] teachers because that's not
[01:40:55] appropriate no wonder why the kid
[01:40:57] doesn't want to

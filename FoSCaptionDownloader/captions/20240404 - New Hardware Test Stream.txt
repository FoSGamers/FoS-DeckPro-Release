[00:00:16] better luck with my uh phone and

[00:00:40] with us no no I'm not sharing dinner I
[00:00:43] will be having dinner um with my family

[00:00:48] and test out the new hardware to see if
[00:00:49] it if it's uh if it's working at all
[00:00:52] here and if I can
[00:00:56] uh I was doing I got myself a new router
[00:00:58] I was having some issues
[00:01:01] with the other
[00:01:02] one felt like I was having issues with
[00:01:04] the other one it could been issues with
[00:01:06] it I wasn't sure yet
[00:01:10] so I bought a new one I try it
[00:01:13] out see what
[00:01:15] happened a whatnot family I know we are

[00:02:11] internet connection to be faster and I
[00:02:13] don't think my internet connection
[00:02:14] actually was moving fast because I don't

[00:13:10] line at Fallout
[00:13:12] release uh with a friend of mine and I
[00:13:14] was in Middle School I think I was sixth
[00:13:16] grade and um that was one of the first
[00:13:19] times I remembered getting yelled at by
[00:13:20] my mom about being out too
[00:13:23] late for the first one
[00:13:26] ever let me uh throw this up here if any
[00:13:29] anybody want something try it

[00:17:30] ah all right see like I um I
[00:17:33] um downloaded I bought it I played it
[00:17:36] there was a bunch of glitches and weird
[00:17:38] issues for a while and I got frustrated
[00:17:41] because at one point I had a character
[00:17:42] and I lost the game I lost all the
[00:17:44] character like every all my progress due
[00:17:46] to like a glitch in the game I got
[00:17:48] really pissed about that one so like
[00:17:51] that's when I stopped playing for a
[00:17:52] little bit and then I didn't put as much
[00:17:54] effort into playing that one and then I
[00:17:56] started playing I think uh Destiny about
[00:17:59] that time frame too when I got tick
[00:18:03] off let's put those out there lots of
[00:18:05] double troubles that right there move
[00:18:07] the Double Trouble move around a little
[00:18:10] bit that way we have't
[00:18:12] other what's up
[00:18:16] Mom oh
[00:18:27] okay
[00:18:33] there we go that's spread out enough oh
[00:18:36] you made another
[00:18:39] huh test one two three hey Patty how you
[00:18:41] doing
[00:18:42] buddy what's up oh got a couple Dragon
[00:18:45] tokens mom made I like those ones you
[00:18:48] say three and four in Vegas yeah I
[00:18:50] haven't played them for a while played
[00:18:51] them for a little bit how's the day
[00:18:53] going Patty yes I am doing a test of uh
[00:18:56] some new hardware I got a new router and
[00:18:59] because I was wondering if that might
[00:19:00] have been an issue with some of the
[00:19:01] glitching I'd been getting so I upgraded
[00:19:04] my router significantly my router was
[00:19:07] like a Nighthawk from probably six five
[00:19:10] to six years old and this one is one
[00:19:14] from uh it's one of the Nighthawk ones I
[00:19:15] can't it's like almost a commercial it's
[00:19:17] like just this close to being a
[00:19:18] commercial grade one or something it's
[00:19:20] like a $400 router but I bought it
[00:19:23] refurbished
[00:19:24] with the $39 plan for the two years
[00:19:28] which gets me a brand new one for two
[00:19:30] years so I was like all right so
[00:19:34] $180 then 39 that's $220 not 400 220 400
[00:19:41] and I can get I could go and get one
[00:19:44] that's all right but I think this is a
[00:19:47] better idea I tried it out so far it's
[00:19:49] working good so far it's going good I'm
[00:19:52] not getting like I used to be really
[00:19:54] really bad glitching all the time as you
[00:19:56] can see it's not really it's not doing
[00:19:58] it as much I could move my hand around
[00:19:59] pretty good
[00:20:02] there yeah yeah trying out some stuff
[00:20:05] testing it out figured do a quick test I
[00:20:08] threw up a giveaway to grab a few people
[00:20:10] in here to see if it would had a few
[00:20:12] people being in here me I could do
[00:20:13] things would have any issues then I uh
[00:20:16] did you know did some other stuff just
[00:20:17] trying it out seeing what's going on I
[00:20:19] pinned up some different ones I actually
[00:20:21] was debating on switching to 4K
[00:20:25] here trying that oh that's too big I got
[00:20:29] I got shrunk in too much I got to adjust
[00:20:32] that later I'll do that one later maybe
[00:20:34] 4K

[00:23:56] because he would sleep in the car and I
[00:23:59] would drive down there and I would run

[00:24:54] I know affordable
[00:24:56] alars I know that I know that I found
[00:24:58] that out a couple days ago myself too I
[00:25:01] wasn't aware of it and then I found that
[00:25:03] out myself a couple days ago I was like
[00:25:05] oh wow running into a bunch of them I
[00:25:08] like the uh I was looking forward to the
[00:25:10] uh he was going to do some um I guess
[00:25:11] some more Star Wars things on
[00:25:14] uh you know May 4th so he was play
[00:25:17] preparing for that or something so I was
[00:25:19] like oh nice I like the Star Wars ones
[00:25:21] I'm my kids are my kids are a fan of
[00:25:23] them that's why I cut that one that they
[00:25:25] were going to for one of them to
[00:25:27] use was is I doing
[00:25:29] here let's do something random let's do
[00:25:33] that that's not really random it's not
[00:25:37] really that
[00:25:43] random yeah but yeah we're all from the
[00:25:46] I know the area there's actually a good
[00:25:48] chunk of us from Massachusetts I
[00:25:51] realized feel like Massachusetts has a
[00:25:53] lot of people that want to be
[00:25:54] entrepreneurs in some way or do their
[00:25:55] own
[00:25:57] thing
[00:26:00] I know I grew up there
[00:26:02] my yeah I know there's a lot of people
[00:26:04] that like want to do their own thing
[00:26:06] they don't like like to stick to stuff
[00:26:08] you know they do whatever I don't know
[00:26:10] how else to explain it but uh yeah no I
[00:26:13] uh I grew up there my whole life was
[00:26:15] there I
[00:26:17] uh I wrestled at St John's and then I uh
[00:26:20] was uh I went to college at UNH and
[00:26:23] that's where I had the issues there
[00:26:27] uhoh
[00:26:29] technical problems I may have had a
[00:26:31] glitch it may have
[00:26:33] happened
[00:26:40] uhoh yes we love the grind exactly I
[00:26:43] think I found a
[00:26:44] glitch you can only see
[00:26:46] me all right hold on a second here I
[00:26:49] wonder if it is the
[00:26:53] uh I wonder if I need to update some of
[00:26:56] the software for or the camera
[00:27:00] thing because the camera app here is
[00:27:03] what's going on right now and glitching
[00:27:05] all right that's better than it was
[00:27:07] before we only had one problem hey D
[00:27:10] doing some technical uh uh try trying
[00:27:13] some uh a new hardware out here seeing
[00:27:16] how many technical issues I have so far
[00:27:19] it's only that one there which was like
[00:27:21] kind of a a normal one sadly I think I
[00:27:24] need to update the software for the T
[00:27:26] for the uh camera I'm wonder if that's
[00:27:28] what I need to
[00:27:33] do how's your day going

[00:32:08] Wasteland de as this mutant goes
[00:32:11] wandering through this Wasteland you

[00:33:13] up and it blows up in your hand leaving
[00:33:16] you with three strength instead of four
[00:33:19] and only seven fingers instead of

[00:06:09] I'm going to do right now so I'm going
[00:06:11] to go about
[00:06:13] opening this
[00:06:18] box and see what is
[00:06:20] inside what do you guys
[00:06:23] think then what I'll do here is I will
[00:06:25] put up our
[00:06:28] uh ADV Venture packs at the top I'll run
[00:06:32] that
[00:06:35] anyways for say well we're on that for
[00:06:38] like five minutes or so and we'll start
[00:06:40] it there there you go you see everything
[00:06:42] that you can bid on at the
[00:06:49] top nice that's awesome dude you had a
[00:06:52] good combo that you got everything to
[00:06:54] come out and win that's awesome when
[00:06:55] you're able to do that I love when
[00:06:57] people can pull that out and they're
[00:06:58] like oh sweet I did this F
[00:07:00] like there something they've been trying
[00:07:01] to get a combo together for a long time
[00:07:02] type
[00:07:05] thing all
[00:07:06] right so let's do this
[00:07:09] here all right get that
[00:07:13] off let's see what it is this all right
[00:07:16] so that's what it is it's the four
[00:07:18] elements oh you get a pack in here did
[00:07:21] you get a pack in here well look at that
[00:07:23] you get a booster pack in there also
[00:07:26] with a uh rubble a baron s demolished
[00:07:30] Destroyer that's the uh car there
[00:07:33] provides no
[00:07:35] Mana it's just a just a card an art card
[00:07:38] like thing all right cool I like see the
[00:07:41] reason why I started get buying some of
[00:07:42] the sorcery stuff is I saw someone buy
[00:07:43] it I'm like the art is really cool on it
[00:07:46] so I wanted to get some
[00:07:49] myself oh that's nice that's nice when
[00:07:53] you get to do stuff like
[00:07:56] that all right so let's see what's this
[00:07:58] one this is the the
[00:08:01] uh oh we got a couple
[00:08:03] more got a couple more of them all right
[00:08:06] they're just like kind of R cards I'm
[00:08:07] guessing Prides no Mana I'm going to
[00:08:09] read the directions I have to learn
[00:08:13] it that's what I've been trying to do
[00:08:14] read the directions and everything I
[00:08:16] guess these are the funny things that
[00:08:17] were supposed to be bigger but somebody
[00:08:19] made a mistake on the size and put like
[00:08:21] uh millimeters instead of inches or
[00:08:22] something like that so they came out
[00:08:25] this big like look at the the size of my
[00:08:28] finger
[00:08:34] you hear but can't see
[00:08:36] me wait a minute are you sure well
[00:08:39] Gustavo you can see me
[00:08:42] right I can okay can you um can you see
[00:08:45] everything like my picture and all that
[00:08:49] stuff normal okay maybe try uh going out
[00:08:52] and back in house or restarting the app
[00:08:55] and like clearing uh clearing cash and
[00:08:56] coming back in type thing sometimes
[00:08:58] there's issues like that all right so
[00:09:00] here we go there our directions there
[00:09:02] little bit of information here card
[00:09:04] types oh
[00:09:09] nice see me on
[00:09:13] YouTube oh you restarted you're new to
[00:09:15] the app oh Gustavo interesting uh so
[00:09:17] you're seeing me without a problem
[00:09:19] househ holders can see me on YouTube but
[00:09:22] not on uh on drip here so huh let me
[00:09:27] see um
[00:09:36] oh
[00:09:41] interesting hold
[00:09:43] on that's really
[00:09:46] weird let me do
[00:09:52] this all right um give me one second
[00:09:57] here let we go one second here it looks
[00:10:00] like that part of it it's actually
[00:10:01] Frozen on on drip here hey guys give me
[00:10:04] one minute I will be literally right
[00:10:05] back I just got to close this and come
[00:10:07] right back in all
[00:10:09] right give me one second I don't know
[00:10:11] why it's doing that it's like
[00:10:16] frozen give me one second I will be
[00:10:18] right
[00:10:24] back oh it's okay on YouTube as well but
[00:10:27] they really delayed there okay maybe
[00:10:29] it's on maybe is it you and your stuff
[00:10:31] so let me just check some stuff quickly
[00:10:33] here let me check
[00:10:44] quickly all right shows me live right
[00:10:46] now if I click on
[00:10:49] live it does have me
[00:10:53] there yeah I'm delayed on live compared
[00:10:55] to other stuff on YouTube yes that is
[00:10:57] correct that is correct I was always
[00:10:59] been delayed on YouTube like that that
[00:11:01] is actually correct
[00:11:02] there it's weird that you're saying it's
[00:11:04] doing like a six minute clip and re
[00:11:06] doing over and over and over
[00:11:08] again because I do see me opening the
[00:11:10] stuff here and like I can open up the
[00:11:12] bags this even I get that on that that's
[00:11:15] weird interesting it's just
[00:11:20] slow
[00:11:23] huh that is weird I don't know it seems
[00:11:26] like it's okay
[00:11:29] infinite booster opening
[00:11:33] yes that would be pretty funny yeah look
[00:11:35] they so somebody made a mistake and they
[00:11:37] put in like centimeters and instead of
[00:11:39] inches or millimeters or something like
[00:11:42] that I can't remember exactly what it
[00:11:43] was but instead you get these little
[00:11:45] tiny mini cards and I'm not going to lie
[00:11:47] I I'm going to open these up because
[00:11:48] these are pretty funny these are pretty
[00:11:50] funny
[00:12:03] these are in every one of the sorcery
[00:12:05] contested realm four elements boxes now
[00:12:08] those are I don't know how of how many
[00:12:10] where you can get those from they're
[00:12:11] actually trying to hard to get I got
[00:12:12] these through uh one person like Rudy

[00:12:22] so
[00:12:23] funny so these
[00:12:25] are these are so tiny
[00:12:29] like somebody made a mistake somewhere

[00:12:34] farewell farewell and they just took him
[00:12:35] and screw it we're going to use him we
[00:12:37] send him in with everyone that's so

[00:17:40] do there we go we'll put them all in one
[00:17:42] sleeve here and we'll do this here we'll

[00:18:04] YouTube hey Mel I did see it I saw you
[00:18:07] in here for a minute all right so I was
[00:18:10] just opening up the sorcery stuff that
[00:18:11] we got here and that was pretty funny
[00:18:12] the little tiny little cards I like
[00:18:14] those guys anyways I'm going to keep
[00:18:16] going through some of my sorcery stuff
[00:18:18] uh I'll throw a giveaway up here in a
[00:18:19] minute here mom is not the DM person she
[00:18:22] cannot do the stories as I can I'm going
[00:18:24] to rip this open after I open up our box
[00:18:26] here so I can actually see all of our
[00:18:27] our cards I actually haven't had a
[00:18:28] chance to look at any of these decks yet
[00:18:30] so I wanted to look at them and remember
[00:18:32] you can jump in onto the adventure game
[00:18:33] if you do want we can I'll start it up
[00:18:35] there but what we need to do is we
[00:18:36] literally just need to build our third
[00:18:38] character because we fin we got a third
[00:18:40] character which is a uh a super mutant
[00:18:43] doctor now they're not strong they're
[00:18:44] not super strong they're super smart so
[00:18:46] they get a plus one on their
[00:18:49] intelligence the sorcery game I don't
[00:18:51] even know yet that's what I'm saying bud
[00:18:52] I have no idea yet I that's why I bought
[00:18:54] the whole the new this thing here so I
[00:18:56] can actually have the rules a quick
[00:18:58] reference and everything like that on
[00:18:59] how to play so I'm actually learning how
[00:19:01] to play it I going to try I figured I'll
[00:19:02] play Maybe with the kids today or
[00:19:03] something like that and um I just going
[00:19:05] to open them up on stream here and
[00:19:07] sleeve them up and get them all
[00:19:08] protected because I really like the art
[00:19:10] I don't even know how to play yet that's
[00:19:12] the thing that I'm trying to get at I'm
[00:19:13] learn I'm learning this one this is a
[00:19:14] newer game this is a Kickstarter that
[00:19:16] was done um I know a couple years ago
[00:19:20] and then uh the alpha was ones I have
[00:19:22] actually an alpha card that came in
[00:19:24] that's a really sweet Alpha card that I
[00:19:25] bought um and I bought a a pack and it
[00:19:27] opened up that that's I think that was
[00:19:29] what hooked me like oh that card's
[00:19:31] awesome and then you have like uh then
[00:19:33] you have like this this is for instance
[00:19:35] here this is one of your cards here this
[00:19:38] is a promo
[00:19:40] card so the Arts are
[00:19:48] different H I would say we're actually
[00:19:50] super into cards it was more like this
[00:19:52] came up and H yeah you know what maybe
[00:19:55] we are into things that we like to play
[00:19:57] I like art that's like playable artist
[00:19:58] that makes
[00:20:00] sense I didn't see uh so I'm going to
[00:20:02] open these up here let's see what's in
[00:20:05] this I haven't actually seen what's in
[00:20:06] these yet so that's why I'm saying I
[00:20:08] need to open up these myself to play I
[00:20:11] can't I hate when these things stick
[00:20:12] like that cuz then I want I feel like
[00:20:13] I'm going to rip the
[00:20:15] Box all right there we go I like how
[00:20:18] they give you space here because they
[00:20:20] expect that you're going to put them in
[00:20:21] sleeves so they give you this little uh
[00:20:23] little extra space here I do not like
[00:20:26] how it's not in a pack though but there
[00:20:29] you go that's a nice box and this is the
[00:20:31] uh guessing this is like the green or
[00:20:34] something like that deck
[00:20:36] Erics Chism game oh this is G this is
[00:20:40] the geomancer geomancer deck all right
[00:20:42] geomancer deck they send me with mini
[00:20:45] sleeves with those mini cards in no they
[00:20:47] did not send me with mini sleeves mini
[00:20:48] cards damn it I need to contact them and
[00:20:50] say they need to send me mini sleeves
[00:20:51] the mini cards oh that was smart mom we
[00:20:54] forgot about the mini sleeves the mini
[00:20:56] cards
[00:20:58] that was a good
[00:21:01] one all right we have the adventure if
[00:21:03] you guys want remember now it is not
[00:21:05] that is a magic Adventure it's not
[00:21:07] sorcery I've just been opening this
[00:21:08] because uh I happen to get it in and I
[00:21:10] wanted to look at them and open them up
[00:21:11] and put some sleeves on these things so
[00:21:13] here we go this is our front of the pack
[00:21:16] here little geomancer we
[00:21:21] got like that tap Dy side if you play
[00:21:25] Earth s Phil void you repl int mble

[00:21:32] right I'm going to do this here just put
[00:21:35] it in sleeves right now and just grab a
[00:21:38] handful of them I swear I put them
[00:21:41] somewhere what did I do there's one bag
[00:21:44] I use that
[00:21:47] pack thank you I appreciate that Gustavo
[00:21:51] I appreciate that a lot yeah we're on uh
[00:21:53] we're on chapter three of the adventure
[00:21:55] actually we just B met our buddy the uh
[00:21:57] the Super Mutant that is actually just
[00:21:59] uh super smart not super strong but
[00:22:02] super smart I don't know he could be
[00:22:03] super strong for all we know just uh
[00:22:06] he's not as big and muscular as the
[00:22:09] others the little crater eyes I like
[00:22:11] that one not bad on
[00:22:14] that all right so we uh so we got to
[00:22:16] what we're waiting on is for somebody
[00:22:18] that wants to help build the character
[00:22:20] so what we're at is let me do this I'm
[00:22:21] going to actually get this showing
[00:22:23] here all right we have uh
[00:22:32] all right then I'm going to do this for
[00:22:34] our screenshot so everybody knows what's
[00:22:37] going on now the
[00:22:42] health is
[00:22:44] only 10 also with this one cuz he's not
[00:22:47] he's not a super mutant strong he's just
[00:22:49] smart so I'm got to put that in there
[00:22:52] and I'm going to take a screenshot for
[00:22:53] you guys so you can see it hey Squirrel
[00:22:55] Master I appreciate it yeah we're trying
[00:22:57] to have a little bit of fun with it I
[00:22:58] don't know sometimes it's good some
[00:23:00] people seem to like it so far here so I
[00:23:03] don't know maybe uh I was debating on
[00:23:05] putting animations to it like we do for
[00:23:07] the other stuff but I didn't want to
[00:23:08] waste my time if people were if it
[00:23:10] wasn't like a if it wasn't worth it so I
[00:23:13] was debating on doing some animations on
[00:23:15] like the next thing if I do another
[00:23:16] adventure and uh I don't know if you
[00:23:18] guys like it but you can always if you
[00:23:20] do though maybe it'll be something I can
[00:23:22] do like regularly I'll I I'll make new
[00:23:24] ones with adventures and stuff do uh new
[00:23:27] animations with them all not new
[00:23:30] animations sometimes I maybe can reuse
[00:23:31] them you know but at other times I'll
[00:23:34] have to make new ones for like new
[00:23:35] characters maybe I was figuring I could
[00:23:37] do that because once I have it built
[00:23:38] then it'll be like kind of like this
[00:23:39] regular animation because it'll be kind
[00:23:41] of like the same thing but it'll just be
[00:23:43] uh like it'll be the same Wasteland but
[00:23:46] just something a little different if
[00:23:47] that makes
[00:23:48] sense but anyways we'll put these up
[00:23:53] here and I'm going to do this to check
[00:23:55] to make sure that this is going to show
[00:23:58] for your characters oh shows too much in
[00:24:01] the middle there we don't want her in
[00:24:02] the middle that's supposed to be off to
[00:24:03] the side put off to the side here for
[00:24:06] our characters so everybody can see
[00:24:08] them those are our characters there they
[00:24:11] might be a little small I can always
[00:24:12] make them bigger for everyone May those
[00:24:14] a little bit small right
[00:24:16] there maybe I want to put a column
[00:24:18] underneath it with a name instead of on
[00:24:20] top I don't know too small yeah is that
[00:24:24] all right there is that any better I
[00:24:26] might have to rearrange it then
[00:24:30] all right let's do this let's do this
[00:24:34] instead that is better all right I'm
[00:24:36] going to try this instead

[00:56:24] it's something that we need to know what
[00:56:25] happened it's just it's one of those
[00:56:27] unique scenarios if that makes any
[00:56:32] [Laughter]
[00:56:35] sense all right let me um let me get
[00:56:38] back to doing some of this here is what
[00:56:40] I was doing I was actually looking
[00:56:42] through these my uh my new sorcery stuff
[00:56:44] that I got I'm actually going to put
[00:56:45] those up here that'll that'll actually
[00:56:47] work right
[00:56:48] there that'll work to go right there
[00:56:50] right there right there right
[00:56:53] there put that there I'm going to take
[00:56:55] these out we take a look at their bears

[00:57:09] he's a good guy those black panda
[00:57:11] bears like you know it's like it's the
[00:57:14] opposite of an albino Panda you know
[00:57:16] it's just a black bear but it looks like
[00:57:18] a panda bear face nice and S nice and
[00:57:21] fun in a squirrel Master my second
[00:57:25] commander and my slim foot and squeed
[00:57:27] deck is Chatter Fang oh
[00:57:28] nice ni yeah all right that makes sense
[00:57:32] I'm going to keep going through and uh
[00:57:33] putting some of these into sleeves like
[00:57:34] I have been chat Fang is really a good
[00:57:37] card uh I know people love that card a
[00:57:39] lot all right we got uh Ron's
[00:57:43] Titan make epic entrance Genesis strike
[00:57:46] enemy here all right that's kind of cool
[00:57:49] art on that this I'm just getting these
[00:57:50] into sleeves here cuz I was going to
[00:57:51] play with my children later and I
[00:57:53] haven't decided what I wanted if I what
[00:57:54] we were going to do so I wanted to I was
[00:57:56] think we' play with the kids later the
[00:57:57] new game CU I got this in I got some
[00:57:59] beta if anybody wants any of this too I
[00:58:02] actually realized I completely forgot to
[00:58:04] put this in in the buy now in the shop
[00:58:07] I'll have to take a look if and figure
[00:58:09] out pricing but if somebody wants some I
[00:58:10] can put them in the shop I have some
[00:58:11] extras I got an extra box to
[00:58:18] sell animal friend is a good combo with
[00:58:20] that too occupies for location see this
[00:58:23] is what I told my wife I love the artart
[00:58:25] on this and and that's part of the
[00:58:26] reason why I got him because it's like
[00:58:28] really cool playable art at least to me
[00:58:30] it
[00:58:32] is and I feel like we're going to be
[00:58:33] able to play a game we should play a
[00:58:35] game
[00:58:36] later this is beta yes correct I have
[00:58:38] some
[00:58:42] beta yes I did not I was debating on
[00:58:44] buying Alpha but uh quite frankly I've
[00:58:49] been looking at it and it keeps going up
[00:58:50] and I'm like I don't know if I want to
[00:58:52] buy it I could afford to buy one a
[00:58:53] couple boxes right now but I'm like ah
[00:58:56] ah I don't know if people are going to
[00:58:57] buy it enough you know what that's what
[00:58:59] I mean you know I'm try I'm trying to
[00:59:00] decide trying to decide because I've
[00:59:03] been debating on buying a an alpha or
[00:59:05] two box because I I got one from uh
[00:59:08] Jason one one of the other things and he
[00:59:09] I one of the packs and I really liked it
[00:59:12] I got a nice card out of it and it got
[00:59:13] me hooked that's the
[00:59:16] problem see I I keep that's what I'm
[00:59:18] saying I want to buy two I want to open
[00:59:20] one and keep one is what I want to do
[00:59:23] I'm Gonna Keep at least one of the betas
[00:59:25] closed and I have a whole another one of
[00:59:27] these boxes of the card sets too I have
[00:59:29] closed I haven't depended on if I was
[00:59:31] going to sell them yet or or close them
[00:59:33] but this I like I love the card art on
[00:59:35] these the art is so the Art Is Awesome
[00:59:38] to me I think that's why for me I got
[00:59:41] intrigued and pulled
[00:59:47] in Charlie what are you going be up for
[00:59:50] breakfast yet or you just up by yourself
[00:59:52] is Mom and Dad up yet or you by yourself
[00:59:54] in the
[00:59:55] morning is another let's Che this
[00:59:57] ordinary mortal promo prolates Royal
[01:00:00] Decree all right draw some type of draw
[01:00:04] card
[01:00:07] maybe yeah it's a throwback MTG but
[01:00:10] different enough exactly it's throwback
[01:00:12] but with a little bit more of like um an
[01:00:15] art twist like not like specific you're
[01:00:17] trying to draw characters more of we're
[01:00:19] trying to make it look like art if that
[01:00:21] makes any sense I don't know how I'll
[01:00:23] also explain that like you have your
[01:00:26] character is there but it's more of an
[01:00:27] artistic character versus a drawing out
[01:00:30] a character to make it look like
[01:00:33] something all right
[01:00:36] lerea I don't know if that makes sense
[01:00:39] it's hard to explain like all right put
[01:00:41] it this way when I'm looking at some of
[01:00:42] the trees here I think Bob Ross I don't
[01:00:44] know why but I think Bob Ross when I've
[01:00:46] seen some of the trees in this and I
[01:00:48] never thought of that when I looked at
[01:00:50] him when I were in uh when I was younger
[01:00:52] at um the other stuff you know so let's
[01:00:56] rerun this you know what I'm gonna put a
[01:00:58] giveaway up I forgot to do that I forgot
[01:01:00] to put a giveaway out oh
[01:01:03] no you know what I'm going to do
[01:01:05] actually we're going to do this I might
[01:01:08] actually do this this might be a fun one
[01:01:10] give me one second here that was my
[01:01:12] fault I was being
[01:01:19] silly one second
[01:01:24] here I don't need that why do I even

[01:12:45] that gives you an extra role with
[01:12:46] certain things like say you find a safe
[01:12:48] you're going to get an extra roll with a
[01:12:49] luck rather than just one

[01:29:14] characters built now just finished
[01:29:17] beating the last boss there in the uh in
[01:29:19] the Wasteland that you had which when
[01:29:21] you notice that uh where're sweet B bers
[01:29:25] notice that the brother was a little
[01:29:27] bigger than normal had a little bit more
[01:29:29] muscular than normal so when we went and
[01:29:31] cut open the brother after you had to
[01:29:32] happen you had to kill the brother there
[01:29:34] sadly there's nothing you can do about
[01:29:36] that he was over the top when that
[01:29:38] happened
[01:29:39] was when that happened you
[01:29:43] uh noticed sweet bind goes hey that's
[01:29:46] weird you go over and you pick up that
[01:29:49] uh your sword from your buddy and you
[01:29:51] use your sword to
[01:29:54] cut open your brother's back and out of
[01:29:56] that that's where you got your buddy the
[01:29:58] new
[01:30:00] friend let me get it up on the screen
[01:30:05] here where you met your new
[01:30:11] companion
[01:30:13] evilin the Super Mutant female that is
[01:30:15] smart she's kind of like a little bit of
[01:30:17] doctor-ish type thing she has some
[01:30:19] abilities there all right and that is
[01:30:21] our evil Lin and now that was are our
[01:30:24] characters you have three characters as
[01:30:25] you go wandering through this Wasteland
[01:30:27] now evil in goes I've had having some
[01:30:29] feelings when I was in that Wasteland
[01:30:31] there I don't really sure what was going
[01:30:32] on when I was inside that body that
[01:30:35] body kept telling
[01:30:38] me kept hearing things it was kept
[01:30:40] telling me that eat me eat me absorb
[01:30:43] absorb and I couldn't figure out what I
[01:30:44] was doing but I kept I but luckily my
[01:30:46] super mutant
[01:30:48] healing part of the doctor stuff the
[01:30:50] Super Mutant healing allowed me to stay
[01:30:53] alive in there longer than a human I
[01:30:54] would have been broken down if it wasn't
[01:30:57] for you guys coming in a couple more
[01:30:58] days so I think I know what we might be
[01:31:02] doing we need to go I need to go and we
[01:31:03] need to get some help here and we need
[01:31:05] to figure
[01:31:06] out how to protect ourselves from that
[01:31:09] smell because even
[01:31:11] me Evelyn Evelyn was pulled in by the
[01:31:15] smell of that
[01:31:17] prettiness so we got to figure out a way
[01:31:19] to protect ourselves since this smell
[01:31:22] the smell is pretty strong and I don't
[01:31:24] know there's another there's at least
[01:31:25] one more of these and I we have to find
[01:31:27] it to get rid of it so it does not harm
[01:31:28] anyone so in that thought process you
[01:31:33] decide what are you going to do here
[01:31:37] house evil thinks that you need to do
[01:31:41] something to block your nose or protect
[01:31:43] yourself from the smell cuz they were
[01:31:44] pulled into it
[01:31:46] now we have Englebert has been plugging
[01:31:50] his nose with cotton ripping pieces of
[01:31:51] his off from his nose and that's been
[01:31:53] working so far but the last one did
[01:31:55] distract him a little bit so when it was
[01:31:57] Stronger so you remember about that so
[01:32:01] do you want to go house and go to a city
[01:32:05] to find try to find one of the cities
[01:32:06] that is off in the distance that you see
[01:32:09] and try to see if you can find something
[01:32:11] that is going to protect you from the
[01:32:13] smell or you going to go further into
[01:32:15] the Wasteland and see what you go and as
[01:32:17] you try to travel towards the feeling
[01:32:20] where sweet bindage is saying the next
[01:32:22] brother is coming from that you need to
[01:32:23] go and go to what do you want to do our
[01:32:27] Bud house since you have built the
[01:32:28] character you have choices now on what
[01:32:31] you want to do do you go to the city to
[01:32:34] try to stock up you have a bunch of pogs
[01:32:36] each one of these are worth five plus
[01:32:38] all of these pogs here you have for
[01:32:40] money all right we're going to check the
[01:32:42] city I like it so the three of you go
[01:32:45] wandering off to the city there Evin
[01:32:49] EVN pointing the way going hey this is
[01:32:51] where I used to live I I lived here
[01:32:53] rather regularly so I have I have a few
[01:32:54] friends over here I just I was out
[01:32:56] trying to gather some herbs and I got
[01:32:59] this smell and it just got sucked right
[01:33:00] into it I don't know really what
[01:33:01] happened here so those are our packs up
[01:33:03] there for those that need to know now as
[01:33:05] you go wandering towards that City
[01:33:07] finally right before the city you get in

[01:56:33] two of these are each of these are five
[01:56:35] plus all these pogs here which I'm
[01:56:37] guessing is somewhere around
[01:56:39] 15 1 2 3 four five 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
[01:56:46] 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 actually about 20
[01:56:51] in there
[01:56:53] you want to see if they have anything
[01:56:54] you want to ask them if they have
[01:56:55] anything cuz he's like I got all kinds
[01:56:57] of wees what are you looking for the
[01:56:59] shop owner all right what are you
[01:57:01] looking for you looking for anything
[01:57:02] specific is what I'm saying you want
[01:57:04] anything to help them you can get maybe
[01:57:06] you're going to get uh maybe you're
[01:57:08] looking for a weapon a gun of some kind
[01:57:11] maybe maybe you want to maybe you want
[01:57:13] some maybe you want to try to get uh
[01:57:14] some armor what are you looking for
[01:57:16] specifically you can tell him I wanted
[01:57:17] some do you have any weapons that we
[01:57:19] have and he'll give you some of the
[01:57:21] options or maybe it's going to be uh
[01:57:22] you're looking for some armor and
[01:57:24] they'll give you some options of what
[01:57:25] the random stuff they have or maybe
[01:57:26] you're looking for food and they'll give
[01:57:28] you of the random stuff they have a
[01:57:31] random store you don't know what's going
[01:57:32] to be in
[01:57:36] it and then
[01:57:38] we stem pack or weapons oh okay you know
[01:57:42] what I like that idea I like that idea
[01:57:45] so hey we need some stem packs and some
[01:57:47] weapons he goes you know what I got some
[01:57:49] of those stem pack type things so we're
[01:57:51] going to each one of those stem packs so
[01:57:53] it's either going to be you get a uh you
[01:57:55] get one stem pack for two pongs
[01:57:59] or you get a package of three stem packs
[01:58:05] for five POG that's your choice I what
[01:58:08] you want to do there but we'll roll and
[01:58:10] we'll see the luckiness remember if
[01:58:12] you're lucky you uh with your with evil
[01:58:15] in and if you get anything 16 or higher
[01:58:17] you get one off one POG off of
[01:58:19] everything so we're going to roll again
[01:58:21] we're going to see oh
[01:58:23] 18 18 you get one off look at that so
[01:58:27] that stem pack instead of being five is
[01:58:29] four for a three pack and each one of
[01:58:31] them is one all right so you get to
[01:58:34] decide what you want to do there all
[01:58:36] right on those if you want to buy any
[01:58:38] stem packs and now the weapons that they
[01:58:40] have pulls out pulls out another Rusty
[01:58:44] pistol that and the pulls out one that
[01:58:47] is a revolver that's not Rusty but it's
[01:58:49] only six shot revolver and it's is in
[01:58:52] good condition then they also pull
[01:58:55] out a sword that has a giant long sword
[01:58:59] that's kind of big for for most people
[01:59:00] to be able to hold but it deals a lot of
[01:59:03] damage if you can't hit anybody with it
[01:59:05] it's very slow Giant and slow then for
[01:59:10] the last thing they pull out is um some
[01:59:13] ammo for the weapons now each thing of
[01:59:16] ammo is as much as you need for the most
[01:59:18] part and but each piece of ammo is one p
[01:59:23] per bullet so your armor your uh your
[01:59:28] sword your rusty pistol is going to be
[01:59:32] two
[01:59:33] pogs your
[01:59:35] revolver will be five pogs which you
[01:59:39] actually those all end up going down one
[01:59:40] so they end up going down one POG for
[01:59:44] the rusty four pogs for the
[01:59:47] revolver um the long sword is seven pogs
[01:59:52] because it would have been eight in the
[01:59:54] um what was the other
[01:59:56] thing in the um and each one of the uh
[01:59:59] bullets is still going to be one because
[02:00:01] you can't go down to
[02:00:02] zero so those are your choices what you
[02:00:04] can do I'm going to open your packs here
[02:00:06] because if we get
[02:00:08] mythics we'll go take off even extra
[02:00:11] from your uh from your stuff here okay
[02:00:15] going to go with the revolver all right
[02:00:17] I like it so we're going to open this up
[02:00:19] and we're going to see if we get any
[02:00:20] mythics out if we happen to get a Mythic
[02:00:22] out you're going to get a discount all
[02:00:24] right and then we're going to save your
[02:00:26] other packs to open after this to where
[02:00:29] your adventure to see if you don't get a
[02:00:30] discount sound that's what we're going
[02:00:31] to do here all right now we going to
[02:00:33] move
[02:00:34] this that way if the other ones get a
[02:00:36] Mythic that way you get a little plus
[02:00:37] extra for your health so here you go you
[02:00:39] got that you got an island Vault
[02:00:44] plunderer terminal Agony oh thary Vault
[02:00:48] you got a
[02:00:50] Mythic warmer Revolt look at that nice
[02:00:55] dude with a blooming Marsh awesome Bine
[02:01:00] intervention Jim foot Sky Explorer slick
[02:01:03] shot lock picker over Zeal muscle Vault
[02:01:05] plunderer spring slasher steer clear
[02:01:08] prickly payer free Strider Commando I
[02:01:11] forgot those were in the reverse order
[02:01:12] to do that but there you go you got a
[02:01:14] Mythic and you got another off so
[02:01:16] everything now is one off or on the
[02:01:18] lowest down to um one POG so everything
[02:01:23] is now one lower so you're going to go
[02:01:25] with the revolver the revolver is only
[02:01:27] three pogs right
[02:01:29] now so you grab the revolver for three
[02:01:33] pogs I'm going to give you the ability
[02:01:35] to choose two more items since you have

[02:09:17] a leather jacket
[02:09:19] already so you would want to give the
[02:09:21] jacket I guess probably going to give
[02:09:23] the jacket to
[02:09:28] uh probably would give the jacket to
[02:09:30] evilin I'm guessing because they don't
[02:09:32] have a leather jacket

[02:15:09] plus one to distribute to somebody when
[02:15:11] it comes to our our adventure here on
[02:15:14] their health so with that being said I'm
[02:15:17] going to take these and going put your
[02:15:20] um nice tiny bones with your mind Slayer
[02:15:24] here there you go tiny bones in a mind
[02:15:26] Slayer nice foil tiny bones and I'm
[02:15:29] going to put that in a sleeve put
[02:15:30] everything here in
[02:15:32] sleeves and then put them in top loaders
[02:15:34] cuz I found out that that top loader is
[02:15:36] actually a little thick enough to hold
[02:15:38] them like this if I put them together in
[02:15:39] two sleeves so I'm actually been doing
[02:15:41] that recently for you guys whenever you
[02:15:43] get them so there you go couple sleeves
[02:15:48] there nice hits on those
[02:15:52] any the other ones that are high priced
[02:15:53] if you if they are let me know I'm just
[02:15:55] not a I'm not sure so I'm just going to
[02:15:58] put them together with the rest of the
[02:15:59] rares like I generally do here so that
[02:16:01] all the rare kinds are together but
[02:16:03] there we go nice all right so you're
[02:16:06] wanding through this Wasteland you have
[02:16:08] an extra where would you like to add
[02:16:10] your
[02:16:14] extra tiny bones is a really great hit I
[02:16:17] know it is Tiny bones is an awesome hit
[02:16:40] Mumu vicus Mumu here we go strength all
[02:16:44] right no no no no no no not strength um
[02:16:47] you get to add it for the health to a
[02:16:48] character all that makes is one
[02:16:50] character Health a little more that's
[02:16:52] what I'm saying so um on the adventure
[02:16:54] here they're NE they're going to get
[02:16:56] you're going a little little extra
[02:16:57] Health on this next um encounter so you
[02:17:00] get to choose where it goes to with that
[02:17:02] Mythic yes that's what that is that's
[02:17:05] what that is it's just extra health for
[02:17:07] the next encounter that we're going into
[02:17:09] because every time we try to open packs
[02:17:11] before an encounter to see if we can get
[02:17:12] anything extra that's why we do the pack
[02:17:15] opening yeah sorry if that wasn't clear
[02:17:18] there Lynn all right you're going to
[02:17:20] give it to Lyn
[02:17:21] so Lynn
[02:17:22] currently has a little an extra Health
[02:17:25] here so let me do this we have plus
[02:17:27] three on that
[02:17:31] Health
[02:17:34] jacket
[02:17:37] three +
[02:17:41] 3 =
[02:17:45] 19 then we're going to have to upgrade I
[02:17:47] forgot to adjust the uh the stuff for
[02:17:50] the the other people
[02:17:54] here all right there you
[02:17:56] go there we go all right that adjusted
[02:18:01] Lynn has
[02:18:04] temporarily plus one for this one
[02:18:06] Adventure so all right I think we have
[02:18:09] everybody
[02:18:10] fully organized with what they are going
[02:18:12] to have for their characters so let me
[02:18:15] do this to screenshot it that way you
[02:18:17] can see them and we're going to go
[02:18:19] forward with our adventure
[02:18:26] we go forward with our adventure
[02:18:36] here all right this is what I'm going to
[02:18:38] do
[02:18:40] Adventure characters I'm going to shrink
[02:18:42] them down a little bit I know I can make
[02:18:43] them bigger if you need me to I'm just
[02:18:45] going to shrink them down for right now
[02:18:46] and put them over here that way they're
[02:18:48] out of the way all right so
[02:18:51] this is what we're doing my friends I
[02:18:52] don't like how that's bigger than that
[02:18:53] one I'll make it bigger whenever you
[02:18:56] guys need me to every single time you
[02:18:57] need me to I will make it bigger all
[02:18:59] right you're wandering out of this
[02:19:00] Wasteland you have one extra Health that
[02:19:02] you have added on to your buddy here the
[02:19:06] uh the Lyn to Lynn off to the Wasteland
[02:19:10] as you wander through this Wasteland
[02:19:12] what happens is you see something in the
[02:19:15] distance the three of you now Lynn is
[02:19:18] pretty smart all right Lyn has some
[02:19:21] intelligence here Lynn goes hey guys um
[02:19:24] I know there's something in the distance
[02:19:25] there but maybe before we go there we
[02:19:28] should like maybe try to scope it out a
[02:19:29] little bit so that being said Lynn has a
[02:19:34] lot of agility so is she going to be
[02:19:37] able to sneak over and see what's going
[02:19:40] on in this you see like a little burnt
[02:19:43] out building here or are you just guys
[02:19:47] three of you just going to walk up on
[02:19:48] the building not caring what do you want
[02:19:50] to do
[02:19:52] vickas want to try to have her sneak
[02:19:55] Recon all right now Evelyn is going to
[02:19:58] try to sneak Recon is going to be one to
[02:20:03] 15 successful
[02:20:07] Recon
[02:20:09] five to
[02:20:11] 20 she gets
[02:20:13] caught and whoever or whatever is there
[02:20:16] maybe it's good maybe it's bad if it's
[02:20:18] bad they get the first shot
[02:20:21] okay this kind of what it is they get
[02:20:23] the first attempt in the round
[02:20:24] whatever's there and the three the rest
[02:20:27] of the three will either run up to help
[02:20:28] the rest of your two team will run out
[02:20:30] to help when you get caught also so they
[02:20:33] will be there to help you but they the
[02:20:35] the the enemy always gets the first shot
[02:20:37] if they lose to your recon okay so here
[02:20:41] we go let's try to get all right well
[02:20:44] that popped out of my hand it's a 10
[02:20:46] successful Recon all right
[02:20:51] Evelyn crouches and starts crawling on
[02:20:54] all
[02:20:57] fours up to the side of the building
[02:21:01] sticks her head around the corner sees
[02:21:04] oh look at that there's three Raiders
[02:21:07] over there around the corner all right
[02:21:10] there's a little fire going looks like
[02:21:11] they're maybe cooking something over
[02:21:13] there all right let's see what's going
[02:21:14] on here I can back up evilin slowly
[02:21:17] backs
[02:21:18] up all right and because now Evelyn
[02:21:21] knows what's going on she comes back and
[02:21:23] goes hey guys angelbert and sweet there
[02:21:26] are three Raiders over there there's one
[02:21:30] giant big Raider that looks kind of
[02:21:32] strong I don't really know what's going
[02:21:33] on but the two of them he's got like big
[02:21:35] armor on and like a weird face mask the
[02:21:37] second one is really
[02:21:40] scrawny like I don't even know if it's
[02:21:42] alive it just kind of was like laying
[02:21:43] down it might even be dead but I don't
[02:21:45] know that's a weird one and then the
[02:21:46] third one was just uh stirring the food
[02:21:49] there in the pot and they had a leather
[02:21:51] jacket on that's all I could see though
[02:21:52] was a leather jacket because there was
[02:21:53] stering food in the pot now that being
[02:21:58] said fire up the Vats kind of this is
[02:22:02] what we doing we since you uh since you

[02:22:45] caught but luckily this time you guys
[02:22:47] are all paying attention so they just
[02:22:50] are alerted so they can do stuff versus

[02:56:13] bring it down to two Health only that
[02:56:14] Raider is only at two Health wow it's
[02:56:17] not too bad there almost dead now our
[02:56:20] sweet

[02:57:03] we're going to do here is instead of it
[02:57:06] being a 5050 it is actually one through
[02:57:09] six he hits one of you and the rest he

[03:10:08] top maybe you want to have a plus one
[03:10:10] and you want to get that sorcery beta oh

[03:10:14] get plus two for some character and you
[03:10:16] want to go with with Outlaws collector
[03:10:18] booster that's up to you on what you
[03:10:20] want to do here if you want to go and do
[03:10:22] anything extra for our adventure give
[03:10:24] them a little extra bonus some help here
[03:10:26] you know you want to help them get
[03:10:27] through this Wasteland right you got to
[03:10:29] help them get through the Wasteland you
[03:10:31] just pick whatever you want for
[03:10:34] packs then we rip it open and we see
[03:10:36] what we get from mythics to see if it's
[03:10:38] going to help our adventurers in the
[03:10:41] Wasteland now will and Nolan do one of
[03:10:44] you want to come and help and do the
[03:10:45] adventure game with us it seems like we
[03:10:46] might have a couple uh couple
[03:10:48] adventurers
[03:10:51] here all right will will is going to
[03:10:53] come over and help all right so we have
[03:10:55] no one being the adventurer right now
[03:10:57] I'm going to be on into for probably
[03:10:59] about another another hour because we
[03:11:02] have um we have to leave at what time do
[03:11:04] we have to leave at Mom noon we have to
[03:11:07] leave at noon so I I'm going to be on
[03:11:08] until about
[03:11:09] 11:00 and then I'm going to have to head
[03:11:11] off so that's why we're trying to get
[03:11:12] through our adventure here for all you
[03:11:14] all right
[03:11:15] Bears I'm going to move move this off to
[03:11:17] the side here so we can see a little bit
[03:11:20] better I'm going to shrink this down
[03:11:24] also all right I know you can't see it
[03:11:26] but I can always make it bigger for you
[03:11:29] all right I'm going to leave these up
[03:11:30] there in case anybody wants to jump in
[03:11:32] as an adventure and take
[03:11:34] over all right so
[03:11:39] Bears someone can jump in for you all
[03:11:41] right that's fine that's
[03:11:43] fine so we not doing it yet
[03:11:48] all right yeah you get the cards you
[03:11:50] always get the cards you purchase hags
[03:11:52] but when we open the packs the reason
[03:11:54] why we open the packs is if you get a
[03:11:55] Mythic in one of the play boosters or a
[03:11:58] um or a or a set booster or a um draft
[03:12:02] booster it gives you a plus one to the
[03:12:03] game to act your
[03:12:06] character the prize at the end yes we're
[03:12:08] going to actually be hopefully beating
[03:12:10] the boss so once we get to the end of
[03:12:11] the
[03:12:12] adventure I was planning on having one
[03:12:14] of my secret layers be what the boss
[03:12:17] drops for all of you guys at the end of
[03:12:19] the adventure you I was going to have
[03:12:21] the secret layer just like like a
[03:12:23] discounted drop for you all um as what
[03:12:25] the boss drops at the end of the
[03:12:27] complete the adventure that's the whole
[03:12:29] point of it yes I was going to have
[03:12:31] somebody drop a secret layer at the end
[03:12:33] of the adventure and you guys would get
[03:12:34] to Cho you know get to bid on that if
[03:12:36] you want it and that's what I was
[03:12:37] thinking of doing for the adventure the
[03:12:39] last thing for the last boss now at the

[03:24:37] now that you have finished you've beaten
[03:24:38] that boss all three of you are wandering
[03:24:41] further through this Wasteland and now
[03:24:43] what you're going to do first before we
[03:24:44] get to our boss here is I'm going to
[03:24:46] have everybody go we're going to go to a
[03:24:48] city quickly and check out a small City
[03:24:50] to see if we can get any any added um
[03:24:54] items so you see a small City in the
[03:24:56] distance there's like three or four
[03:24:57] buildings nothing big it's a little town
[03:24:59] you're wandering towards that town and
[03:25:01] in that town there's three little
[03:25:02] buildings one of the buildings on the
[03:25:04] left side is an Armory where you see the
[03:25:06] guy uh there's a a guy a blacksmith uh I
[03:25:10] mean a blacksmith building away with
[03:25:12] weapons on the right side is um and a uh
[03:25:18] is for um armor armor itself and on the
[03:25:21] left side a little further down you
[03:25:24] actually have a a weapon Smith which has
[03:25:27] all kinds of
[03:25:28] guns all right so you're F you're going
[03:25:31] to this place here now whoever jumps in
[03:25:33] next will be able to decide what you do
[03:25:35] in this city here in the small little
[03:25:37] town on what you're going to do we'll
[03:25:39] see what happens on what you like to do
[03:25:40] here in this small little town and then
[03:25:42] once you decide what you do in the town
[03:25:44] and pick up your stuff you will be the
[03:25:45] first one in the first character choice
[03:25:48] for when we go forward to our boss
[03:25:49] battle that's what's going to happen
[03:25:51] here so you get to choose some stuff in
[03:25:53] the little town here and then you're
[03:25:54] going to be the one the person that does
[03:25:56] our boss battle here so let's see what
[03:25:58] you want to do if you want to jump in on
[03:26:00] any of these now remember we do have
[03:26:02] those sorcery stuff too if you want to
[03:26:05] check any of that
[03:26:10] out and looks like we might be um going
[03:26:15] through the adventure elves a little bit
[03:26:17] right now which is fine we can finish
[03:26:19] off the
[03:26:21] adventure have a little bit of fun here
[03:26:24] Sundays are always uh slower days this
[03:26:26] is why I like doing the adventure
[03:26:27] because if it's a slow day you can still
[03:26:30] have some fun doing stuff yeah you can
[03:26:32] still like go through it's not just like
[03:26:33] I'm talking to myself doing nothing
[03:26:35] there's like something going on the
[03:26:36] entire time if that makes any sense yeah
[03:26:40] yeah you got to play The Adventure too
[03:26:43] that's exactly you got to play a little
[03:26:45] bit of it too hey I'm happy had Gustavo
[03:26:47] nice I'm happy you had some
[03:26:49] fun all right at the end of The Journey
[03:26:52] there's going to be I will admit there's
[03:26:54] one more chapter in The Journey okay at
[03:26:56] the end of The Journey there's going to
[03:26:58] be one big boss that you beat and that
[03:27:00] one big boss is going to have a secret
[03:27:03] lair that is dropped for you guys as
[03:27:07] loot all right so that'll be on the next
[03:27:09] chapter which will probably be um I
[03:27:12] think it'll be I think it'll be probably
[03:27:13] tomorrow actually you know tomorrow they
[03:27:15] drop us secret layer for all of you guys
[03:27:18] to buy now the secret layer I'm going to
[03:27:20] put it at like a decent price it's not
[03:27:21] going to be like you it won't be a high
[03:27:23] price it won't be at the price that you
[03:27:24] see on TCG but it will be at a good
[03:27:27] price for you guys get and that's the
[03:27:28] way that I'm going to do it well at
[03:27:31] least that's what I was thinking to do
[03:27:32] like the boss would drop something
[03:27:34] really cool that's what I was figuring
[03:27:36] would go on with the uh with the game
[03:27:38] here so if you want to jump in 22
[03:27:42] seconds left all you got to do is bid up
[03:27:43] to whatever pack you want
[03:27:46] once you've got the pack you want bid it
[03:27:48] up to it we'll uh you get to pick your
[03:27:51] character to figure out what we do in
[03:27:53] the Wast here in this little town that
[03:27:55] we're in before we get to our
[03:27:59] boss and it's any of these packs up
[03:28:01] there that you
[03:28:03] want bones what you
[03:28:06] doing one punch
[03:28:09] man one punch man likes it one punch man
[03:28:14] what are you going to be
[03:28:20] oh going to get a sorcery I like
[03:28:22] it I like it all right now with this
[03:28:27] sorcery I was told that I am supposed to
[03:28:31] shuffle them all because there's like
[03:28:33] like stacks of them together so I'm
[03:28:36] going to shuffle the packs up and then
[03:28:37] put them back in the Box okay and then
[03:28:41] you can pick out whichever one you want
[03:28:43] because my understanding somebody told
[03:28:44] me that they sometimes are all um
[03:28:46] they're clumped
[03:28:47] together so you'll get either nothing
[03:28:50] for a while if you buy a bunch of them
[03:28:52] or if you're lucky enough where you find
[03:28:54] the clump you'll get like all the clumps
[03:28:56] so I'm going to shuffle all the packs up
[03:28:57] here and then we're going to get to it
[03:29:00] all
[03:29:02] right all right one
[03:29:05] punch it's our uh you know what should I
[03:29:08] put this out for a um for a uh auction
[03:29:12] would you guys like to see that
[03:29:13] auctioned off
[03:29:16] so this is what I'm going to do here
[03:29:19] quickly go like this just take them out
[03:29:22] so we can shuffle them up a little bit
[03:29:24] and I'm going to put them all right back
[03:29:25] in the
[03:29:27] Box you go
[03:29:59] all right the last Shuffle right here
[03:30:00] should be good let me know if you think
[03:30:02] I should Shuffle it more though
[03:30:22] okay we good with the
[03:30:25] shuffle it is a pretty card it is a
[03:30:28] pretty card definitely a pretty
[03:30:32] card all right here we go put those all
[03:30:34] back in and then you can tell me where
[03:30:37] you want to go in the Box here and I
[03:30:40] will pick one out for you
[03:30:51] all right where would you like to go top
[03:30:54] one on the
[03:30:55] left top one on the left this one right
[03:31:00] here I think that was one he said yes
[03:31:03] all right top left here we go take
[03:31:08] screenshot there we go top left there we
[03:31:11] are top left now you actually get a plus
[03:31:16] one for your character as you travel
[03:31:19] through this Wasteland here all right
[03:31:22] that's pretty good so we're going to
[03:31:23] open this up and now you're going to
[03:31:25] have to help me here cuz I think it's
[03:31:27] the um the elite if I remember right is
[03:31:31] the one that's like the high ones the
[03:31:33] the top ones so we're going to try to if
[03:31:35] we get an elite then I will will be
[03:31:38] doing um we'll let you get an extra plus
[03:31:41] plus one all right I think it's elite if
[03:31:43] I remember right

[03:33:53] mini please Earth fire water what is the
[03:33:58] um elements yes I got the

[03:34:18] how you doing trying to figure out which
[03:34:21] ones would like mean like which ones on

[03:34:28] [Music]
[03:34:30] are
[03:34:32] location silver rule location Target
[03:34:35] spell I can't remember but I think uh I
[03:34:38] think that one minor explosion was a
[03:34:40] nice little card there I can't remember
[03:34:42] which ones are the top ones because I've
[03:34:44] only looked at the a couple times and I
[03:34:46] just got him in to start it
[03:34:48] out do you know one punch which ones are
[03:34:51] the the top ones cuz I think that is one
[03:34:53] of a minor explosion there but I can't
[03:34:55] remember off the top of my head just cuz
[03:34:57] I haven't been like I said I haven't uh

[03:35:16] think it deserves one we're going to
[03:35:17] give you one
[03:35:19] extra say on the
[03:35:23] bottom says deals three damage to each
[03:35:26] unit a Target location up to two steps
[03:35:30] away ordinary magic of proximal
[03:35:36] explosion I thought that was one of the
[03:35:38] ones because it has the the a couple of
[03:35:40] them up there but I might be wrong on
[03:35:43] that on the on the triangles but I'm not

[04:12:38] the idea of that but I'm just saying all
[04:12:41] right we're going to loot we have one
[04:12:42] for loot
[04:12:44] we have one% on
[04:12:46] fire all right so Vias do you want to
[04:12:49] loot or set on fire I'm going to give
[04:12:50] you one last chance and I'm going to
[04:12:51] roll the dice to see who it goes
[04:13:00] to all right we're going to roll it's a
[04:13:03] 50/50 are we going to set it on fire or
[04:13:05] are we going to loot it 1 to 10 is loot
[04:13:10] 11 to
[04:13:11] 20 is set it on
[04:13:15] fire eight we got eight we loot it we
[04:13:19] loot it all right one punch goes
[04:13:23] over evil in I think you're e no vinage
[04:13:27] whatever one punch you go over you lean
[04:13:30] over you start picking through that body
[04:13:31] and you go oh look at
[04:13:33] this some
[04:13:35] ammo you have found 20 bullets what do
[04:13:39] you want to do with those 20 bullets
[04:13:56] you divide them evenly all right we can
[04:13:58] divide them up evenly I like that let's
[04:14:00] do this we're going to give um 10 of
[04:14:03] them to the person with the uzi all
[04:14:06] right then we're going to give five to
[04:14:09] the rest of them
[04:14:13] that way cuz the uzi does three at a
[04:14:16] time sound good so now we have 15
[04:14:20] bullets for Englebert sweet bage has 12
[04:14:24] and weapon uh and evilin has 19 all
[04:14:28] right sounds good you also find some
[04:14:31] pogs on them there is one two three four
[04:14:35] five six seven pogs you have found on
[04:14:38] that boss and also the final thing that
[04:14:42] you have found on that
[04:14:44] boss
[04:14:45] is a clue it's
[04:14:50] actually part
[04:14:52] of something from the father of
[04:14:55] angelbert there are some
[04:14:58] pants now these are jean pants Jean
[04:15:03] cargo
[04:15:04] pants and in the pocket of those cargo
[04:15:06] pants there's a
[04:15:08] letter that letter
[04:15:11] says the scent has got me save us all
[04:15:16] and release us like what the hell does
[04:15:18] that mean I don't understand that at
[04:15:22] all but you know what that's
[04:15:26] okay
[04:15:28] because it is the end of chapter
[04:15:32] 3 and
[04:15:34] now with our next
[04:15:36] adventure is going to be going angelbert
[04:15:40] takes I'm sorry angelbert take the pant
[04:15:41] took the pants by the way
[04:15:43] engleberg took the pants now where do
[04:15:45] you want to H what do you want to do
[04:15:46] with the pants because the pants give
[04:15:48] him one Health and instead of luck it
[04:15:50] gives him one strength yeah he had
[04:15:53] leather pants on before so who do you
[04:15:55] want to give the leather pants to which
[04:15:56] is one Health and one
[04:16:11] luck where we're going to roll all right
[04:16:13] we're going to roll one to 1 to 10 goes
[04:16:17] to
[04:16:18] evil uh 11 to 20 goes to
[04:16:21] Sweet

[04:16:26] pants leather
[04:16:28] pants
[04:16:30] for plus one

[00:00:08] that do every time I
[00:00:11] start the um show here for some
[00:00:16] reason the uh Mac the
[00:00:21] camera
[00:00:24] disappears I don't understand
[00:00:27] why oh I think whatnot screwing it up
[00:00:31] that's what I think is going hi
[00:00:32] everybody I'm
[00:00:33] huge I think what not screwing it up I
[00:00:36] think that's what's going on because in
[00:00:37] the morning whatnot will try to connect
[00:00:40] to that camera when I first start up
[00:00:42] instead of OBS right away and I think it
[00:00:45] keeps pulling it out of OBS making me
[00:00:48] have to add it back in I I figured out
[00:00:51] why this is doing that every
[00:00:54] morning how's
[00:00:57] every though y
[00:01:02] how you doing myel how's it going

[00:10:17] we're at 18
[00:10:20] here there was a chunk that fell to the
[00:10:23] bottom right down here I just wanted to
[00:10:24] make sure I got those so you didn't miss
[00:10:26] out on them they slid down to the bottom
[00:10:28] when I had lifted this up that's what I
[00:10:31] was trying to say everything was sliding

[00:22:44] though seal is a pretty good card and I
[00:22:46] like getting the foil command Towers
[00:22:48] personally when you turn them around and
[00:22:50] you got that I don't know I I'm a big
[00:22:52] fan I'm a big fan of them even though
[00:22:55] they weren't worth a lot I feel like
[00:22:56] they're going to be worth a lot in the
[00:22:57] in the near future because they're not
[00:22:58] being made
[00:23:07] anymore oh no oh oh oh you said two more
[00:23:10] for the red button no I have one more
[00:23:11] for the red button one more for the red
[00:23:14] button that I had coming out was when I
[00:23:15] when you hit this the two that I have
[00:23:17] ready there is one more I did do one
[00:23:20] ready here's the other one for when you
[00:23:22] go up and you happen to get a pack you
[00:23:24] get up to Otter space and you take out a
[00:23:27] satellite if you get a pack so I did get
[00:23:30] that done I have to get the one done for
[00:23:33] um for this which is going up and taking
[00:23:36] out the moon I have not done that I have
[00:23:38] not done that one yet but when you get a
[00:23:40] pack when you get a pack out of the red
[00:23:42] button it goes up to the
[00:23:48] satellite but here we go I'm gonna get
[00:23:50] your stuff in a in a bag here for you
[00:23:56] gnomes
[00:23:59] let me do this here let me do this
[00:24:02] here there it
[00:24:04] is I can't believe nothing G that 13 was
[00:24:07] just a really unlucky number
[00:24:10] today 13 has come out for you the last
[00:24:13] few times you've done it though was
[00:24:14] lucky so I guess it's one of those days
[00:24:16] where it's just like it actually is the
[00:24:17] Unlucky number people take say it
[00:24:21] is I can't help it sometimes but I G we
[00:24:24] got we got you a pack anyways got you a
[00:24:26] pack of LCI and there and that is not
[00:24:29] all going to fit together so I'm going
[00:24:30] to have to put it separately into this
[00:24:32] little package
[00:24:33] here but you did yes like you said you
[00:24:36] cleared out some of that bolt for uh the
[00:24:39] next person that goes in is going to
[00:24:41] have a lot better chance now see I think
[00:24:44] we're at 1,200 is so we're going to down
[00:24:47] to around 1150 cards in there for your
[00:24:50] chance to get a Lord of the Rings
[00:24:51] collector booster is in there maybe
[00:24:53] you're going to be that one who
[00:24:56] knows
[00:24:59] dude I am sorry yeah that was really
[00:25:00] ridiculous I don't know what to tell you
[00:25:02] here that was nuts but you know what I'm
[00:25:04] going to end up doing what I end up
[00:25:06] doing is after days like this I do feel
[00:25:08] bad and I end up adding like a couple
[00:25:11] extra packs you know what [ __ ] it I'm
[00:25:12] gonna do it now give me a
[00:25:14] second give me a second I pulled some
[00:25:16] new cards and they're not worth really
[00:25:19] anything so let me do this I feel bad
[00:25:22] when I see that and I've done this a
[00:25:23] couple times just to like be like all

[00:25:39] me feel bad if that many things were
[00:25:41] pulled that means my that means the odds
[00:25:44] are lower than I like and I don't like

[00:32:41] you a technician are you a strong human
[00:32:45] are you a mutant or are you a
[00:32:49] detective let's figure that out here all
[00:32:51] right I'm going to just Shuffle this up
[00:32:52] since I just put those cards in
[00:32:54] there there we go
[00:33:04] okay since I just put those uh free ones
[00:33:07] in there you want to shuffle that
[00:33:12] up was that the last LCI pack that was
[00:33:15] not the last LCI pack I actually have
[00:33:18] two boxes of it actually so I have more
[00:33:21] LCI
[00:33:23] packs I have two more boxes look at
[00:33:28] that what do you say junior I'm sorry
[00:33:32] sometimes
[00:33:33] I I really old stuff I don't know my
[00:33:37] father-in-law used to watch like you
[00:33:40] know three stoan and stuff like my
[00:33:42] father-in-law watches my brother my
[00:33:43] brother-in-law watches it my
[00:33:45] father-in-law watched it so like uh I I
[00:33:47] was I grew up watching three students
[00:33:49] every now and again that times comes out
[00:33:51] you'll try the
[00:33:54] mutant oh that was the last one out of
[00:33:56] the box that is is correct that is the
[00:33:57] last one out of the box that was the
[00:34:00] last one out actually wait there might
[00:34:03] be nope there are no more pack deals
[00:34:05] from the kids so I believe that is the
[00:34:07] last one out of the box there all right
[00:34:10] here we go shuffled those in there maybe
[00:34:13] you're going to be lucky and pull
[00:34:14] yourself out a play
[00:34:16] booster and a play booster is going to
[00:34:19] be a plus one by the way play booster is
[00:34:21] going to be a plus bun wi by the
[00:34:24] way all right here we go
[00:34:27] now you're going to be a mutant as you
[00:34:29] are a
[00:34:32] mutant what you do
[00:34:34] here you're looking
[00:34:39] for all right you are looking for Foods

[00:34:51] as a mutant to get through your days
[00:34:55] where do you want to go

[00:35:09] right you have gone from plus
[00:35:11] one this is plus two and that is half a
[00:35:15] point only so that really doesn't matter
[00:35:17] so you're at plus two plus three right
[00:35:19] now you are currently at plus three and
[00:35:21] a half if you want to count the half
[00:35:23] there all right here we

[00:45:04] that sometimes you got the luck
[00:45:06] sometimes you don't but hey you know
[00:45:07] what I felt we make sure we spice that
[00:45:09] uh missile up here the missile launch up
[00:45:11] after that and I actually gave you we
[00:45:13] gave you an extra pack there to make
[00:45:14] sure gnomes
[00:45:18] rule gnomes
[00:45:22] rule we didn't even hit anything big out
[00:45:24] of that pack which upsets me a lot
[00:45:26] because that box I was expecting
[00:45:28] something big out of that last pack cuz
[00:45:30] that box didn't have much in it I'm
[00:45:32] really concerned about like them after
[00:45:33] they do like a release they change
[00:45:36] things up to the point that um like they
[00:45:38] don't put all the nice big hits in the
[00:45:40] packs anymore so it's almost like I need
[00:45:43] to buy a like a pallet at pre-release so
[00:45:48] I can get all the ones with the good
[00:45:50] mixes of packs because I've been
[00:45:52] noticing after a while that we don't get
[00:45:55] the things that I normally would all
[00:45:56] right who wants to play we're going to
[00:45:58] do that one nobody want to do that for

[00:53:13] one wanted our little topper either so
[00:53:14] we're going to put that
[00:53:17] back
[00:53:18] now let's see here I don't have too many
[00:53:21] new like singles that I have so I have
[00:53:25] anything for New the only thing that I
[00:53:26] got new recently was a temple garden and
[00:53:29] Overgrown Tomb now I was debating on
[00:53:31] putting those into the Big Blue Book
[00:53:33] because I do have that big blue book
[00:53:35] here and
[00:53:36] uh always got the big blue book with
[00:53:44] our
[00:53:46] spins our spin our wheel with our
[00:53:48] missiles we always have that available
[00:53:50] if you want to try it out Big Blue Book
[00:53:54] remember no one has hit the Balin tomb
[00:53:57] in there yet and also the average has
[00:54:00] gone up because once cards are pulled
[00:54:02] out they become collector boosters emerg
[00:54:04] at car Manor there's about 20 empty
[00:54:06] spots in there so that means that
[00:54:08] average has gone up a bit too so get a
[00:54:11] good deal on that let's see if you want
[00:54:14] some packs
[00:54:16] here
[00:54:18] for our game since no one went with any
[00:54:21] of that I'm going to put like a
[00:54:22] three-pack deal up in general with
[00:54:25] without doing the game and see if you
[00:54:26] guys like
[00:54:28] it CU sometimes you just like the three

[01:19:57] Wellspring nice Jag the Wellspring Swift
[01:20:01] Cliff Swift water Cliffs and a human
[01:20:03] Soldier I think you had a six in here to
[01:20:05] tie it at least if I remember
[01:20:09] right so I don't think monsterous step
[01:20:11] was the big one I think you had a six in
[01:20:13] here to tie it oh there's a seven it was
[01:20:15] a seven not a six here we go we got a
[01:20:18] seven the sun again coming out with
[01:20:22] seven
[01:20:24] if you tie if you tie what we do is we
[01:20:27] go down the next two three the next two
[01:20:31] cards so three cards total and if they
[01:20:32] end up tying all three so say you do
[01:20:35] three-way tie the buyer wins if it's if
[01:20:38] it say it was four four and four the
[01:20:40] buyer would win but say these two were
[01:20:42] tie only and there's two sevens what you
[01:20:44] do is You' go to the next value card
[01:20:46] down and if it's this one's a seven and
[01:20:47] this one's a six Exelon would win or
[01:20:49] this one's a seven and this one's a six
[01:20:51] greater uh the the Suns one would win so
[01:20:55] that's how that's how ties
[01:20:58] go yeah yeah we just kind of I um pretty
[01:21:01] much if you ever get a three-way tie
[01:21:03] which is very rare the buyer ends up
[01:21:05] winning right off the bat but if you tie
[01:21:07] in between two of them we just go down
[01:21:10] until we get down to the third finally
[01:21:12] on the third number if you tie three
[01:21:13] ways down again a three-way tie kind of
[01:21:16] again you get a buyer box one two three
[01:21:20] four and five one two three four and
[01:21:24] five cool cool cool curator the Suns
[01:21:28] creation dousing device cartographer's

[01:21:59] and I think you only had a six there was
[01:22:02] your high but cosium Confluence is a
[01:22:04] nice one there I think sex
[01:22:05] self-reflection was the was the highest
[01:22:08] one you had there with a six so I think
[01:22:11] it is the Suns box again we at the Suns

[01:49:24] here hey skinny how you doing
[01:49:31] buddy sacred Foundry foil I thought I
[01:49:33] had another triome if you like troms by
[01:49:37] the
[01:49:38] way and those would be what I have for
[01:49:44] um
[01:49:45] lands that are foil there's a marsh
[01:49:50] Flats there steam vents I do have I
[01:49:54] think there's some left in the bo boo
[01:49:55] book though so if you want to try a luck
[01:49:58] to try to get something out of the
[01:50:00] book I do
[01:50:04] believe the book
[01:50:09] has watery grave oh that's not foil no
[01:50:13] that's not foil Temple Garden is a foil
[01:50:15] in here that's
[01:50:17] it
[01:50:19] he
[01:50:22] and Overgrown Tomb is not a foil we have
[01:50:24] another Temple Garden that's a foil over
[01:50:26] here too but that's in the big boo book
[01:50:28] if you want to try your luck on that but
[01:50:31] these are the ones that I have right
[01:50:34] now you're [ __ ] rainbows how you
[01:50:36] doing not doing too bad we started a new
[01:50:38] little game here we uh call it the
[01:50:41] adventure Wasteland Adventure getting
[01:50:42] prepared for Fallout out here so we're
[01:50:46] getting prepared for Fallout
[01:50:49] occurring
[01:50:51] I figure I'll adjust it once Falls here
[01:50:53] with some of my Fallout cards to play so
[01:50:55] that's why I've been doing that now hey
[01:51:02] um let me
[01:51:04] uh tag you
[01:51:13] here we do
[01:51:18] this
[01:51:25] there you go I uh just putting them out
[01:51:27] there for
[01:51:31] him what's it all about all right so the
[01:51:34] new game is uh it's a wasteland
[01:51:36] Adventure game so we're GNA give you an
[01:51:38] example so this was uh pulled out this
[01:51:40] say these are the packs that you get you
[01:51:41] decide you're gonna get this is going to
[01:51:43] be a plus one for your character half a
[01:51:45] point for your character and half a
[01:51:46] point for your character which means
[01:51:47] it's a plus two so any you can get up to
[01:51:49] a plus three for your character or a one
[01:51:51] depending on what you go with so that's
[01:51:53] your your points that you start out with
[01:51:54] and each one of the um each one of the
[01:51:59] boxes here is either a 50/50 chance for
[01:52:01] plus one 50/50 chance for plus one or
[01:52:04] the blue side is a 25% chance for a plus
[01:52:07] one minus one now it's either plus one
[01:52:09] minus one you pull those cards out and
[01:52:12] you add them to your character whatever
[01:52:14] character you choose which is a mutant a
[01:52:16] technician a human that's a strong human
[01:52:19] or detective and then what you do at the
[01:52:21] end is you add all those cards up so say
[01:52:24] for instance you got a uh technician and
[01:52:26] you're like all right cool treasure
[01:52:27] helps me that's G be plus one that goes
[01:52:29] to plus three then you go all right cool
[01:52:31] coffee help me that goes to plus4 you go
[01:52:34] Berserker doesn't help me you know I'm
[01:52:35] only at plus three so that brings you to
[01:52:37] plus three and you go hey I'm gonna go

[01:54:46] adventure game Wasteland Adventure here
[01:54:49] we go skinny what we're going to do then
[01:54:52] is I put these over here this starts you
[01:54:54] off at a plus two all right this is a
[01:54:57] plus two for your character who do you
[01:55:00] want to be it should be in the notes all
[01:55:03] the characters the pluses and minuses
[01:55:05] that are associated with them um who
[01:55:08] would you like to be all right no
[01:55:10] problem I'll explain step by step for me
[01:55:13] no problem all right so you get to
[01:55:16] choose between a technician a strong
[01:55:18] human a detective or a mutant of what
[01:55:22] character you want to be and depending
[01:55:24] on that character you're either GNA get
[01:55:26] a plus or a minus in these for their
[01:55:28] strength and whatever their strength is
[01:55:31] at the end is dependent on if they can
[01:55:34] beat the boss here which is the final
[01:55:37] battle as a boss if you Happ to pull out
[01:55:39] a card say you pull out Owen Grady and
[01:55:42] you're at plus three you're going to
[01:55:44] beat ow andrady because he's only got
[01:55:45] two for the defense here all right so
[01:55:47] because of that you beat ow andrady and
[01:55:49] you're going to come out with a free set

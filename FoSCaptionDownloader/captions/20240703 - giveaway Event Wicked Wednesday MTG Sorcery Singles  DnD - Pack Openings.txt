[01:03:00] ability of me doing
[01:03:03] that yes Friday correct I actually have
[01:03:06] a collector booster box and I have play
[01:03:09] boosters and two BO two boxes of the
[01:03:11] Beyond boosters and I also have um two
[01:03:15] bundles actually if you want to try
[01:03:17] those bundles I think those would be
[01:03:18] pretty
[01:03:20] fun and then hopefully I will get the
[01:03:22] other six boxes in on Friday too that
[01:03:24] I'm supposed to get because the other
[01:03:26] distributor I went through another just
[01:03:29] like another uh like a store that I get
[01:03:32] deals from every now and again to drve
[01:03:33] again them and they said they're going
[01:03:34] to ship all of them they have not said
[01:03:35] different yet generally they're pretty
[01:03:37] good and they tell me they're not going
[01:03:38] to ship them like if they were right
[01:03:39] away so I'm hoping I get them at you
[01:03:41] right away we should be good so if we
[01:03:43] get all eight or all seven now because
[01:03:45] I'm I'm missing one I only have one
[01:03:47] collector booster at the moment so yeah
[01:03:50] allart but that's it's the one with the
[01:03:53] serialized card in it so you that's why
[01:03:55] you guys want to come and hang out with
[01:03:56] us cuz you know it's going to be the
[01:03:58] serialized card since I only got one box
[01:04:01] that's what happened to me last time I
[01:04:02] got a serialized card out of it which
[01:04:05] one was that
[01:04:08] set what one was that set no it wasn't
[01:04:11] wasn't the Ser realized I got the um
[01:04:13] surge
[01:04:14] foil um I got the surge foil soul ring
[01:04:18] from it that's what it was Serge foil
[01:04:20] Fallout soul ring that's when I only got
[01:04:21] the one there there you go art oh you're
[01:04:25] back back there but that's all right
[01:04:26] I'll get you together
[01:04:30] after um I was going to be I think it's
[01:04:33] going to be probably around 40 um I have
[01:04:35] to double check maybe that or a little
[01:04:37] bit lower give or take a couple bucks is
[01:04:39] generally what it is I try not to go too
[01:04:41] high not too low I don't want to screw
[01:04:42] people around with things I don't want
[01:04:44] to be like the $70 person type thing
[01:04:45] that's insane
[01:04:51] so today is your Friday oh that's why
[01:04:54] you used to do it that
[01:04:59] way you can get monry from set boosters
[01:05:02] uh you have a better chance from
[01:05:03] collector boosters but yes you can get
[01:05:05] them from set
[01:05:08] boosters we can we can still do that
[01:05:11] let's do this here we're GNA try it
[01:05:12] again I like playing this I like doing
[01:05:13] this one we G do
[01:05:16] this do that all right see if you can
[01:05:21] hopefully see
[01:05:24] everything we'll do this
[01:05:29] here we
[01:05:32] go here we
[01:05:38] go and here we
[01:05:43] go all right I think everybody can see
[01:05:45] everything here maybe I'll have to make
[01:05:47] these these ones a little bit
[01:05:50] shorter there you go
[01:05:56] should be able to see the fos gamers in
[01:05:57] the middle
[01:06:01] there I am I might be able to
[01:06:06] actually I can put him as yeah I can do
[01:06:08] that on YouTube I can I mean that would
[01:06:12] all that would help me a lot because
[01:06:13] YouTube is one of the ones that gives me
[01:06:14] a minute sometimes I get back to it I
[01:06:15] always get to it when I'm looking at
[01:06:17] something all right so we're going to do
[01:06:19] this again if you want to help me out
[01:06:21] there I would always appreciate that
[01:06:23] that would be awesome
[01:06:25] do this put this out here I like doing

[01:06:48] go let's do a different one I'm going to
[01:06:51] do a different one too after
[01:06:57] oh they always do that's all YouTube is
[01:07:00] I don't mind that because it helps with
[01:07:01] the um view count YouTube is the only
[01:07:04] one that does that crap it doesn't
[01:07:06] matter to me because it just helps with
[01:07:07] the view count and I kind of laugh at it
[01:07:08] and ignore it because quite frankly if
[01:07:10] they're that life is that sad that they
[01:07:12] need to go and do that to somebody on
[01:07:13] YouTube kind of
[01:07:16] pathetic

[01:16:45] two three four five six seven 8 9 10 11
[01:16:51] 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 I know
[01:16:55] sometimes people get busy so they don't
[01:16:56] always get a chance to do everything so
[01:16:58] that's why I I don't mind jumping right
[01:17:00] onto it and doing it because I know some
[01:17:01] people get busy you know they're at work
[01:17:02] and stuff you guys hang out with me at
[01:17:03] work and I get that it's in the day I'm
[01:17:05] good with that I
[01:17:09] understand which is
[01:17:12] why I G start
[01:17:14] doing some singles right

[01:17:22] of these

[01:17:52] them back in
[01:17:55] it's pain in the
[01:17:58] butt but give me uh give me five seconds
[01:18:06] here it is frustrating though I will say
[01:18:12] that all right I added those
[01:18:18] in should be better
[01:18:23] now here we go
[01:18:25] let's

[01:23:13] that because I used to have I I don't
[01:23:14] like doing big floors but um some people
[01:23:16] like the chances of getting like the big
[01:23:17] things out of the back boxes in the bags
[01:23:20] so I kind of need to give a little bit
[01:23:21] of an option and when we have a floor I
[01:23:23] like to have something extra to give

[03:38:34] only one or two good cards left in
[03:38:36] there so we'll see what's you guys get
[03:38:39] your luck and let's do um a loot box and
[03:38:43] let's play our game Oh I like that
[03:38:46] thr a loot box out there there we go who
[03:38:49] would like to try their luck on a loot
[03:38:51] box that is this here the premium loot
[03:38:56] box got lots of good things as options
[03:38:58] in
[03:39:01] there I'm going to put these away
[03:39:03] because no one's been going with the
[03:39:04] modern Horizon
[03:39:05] recently but maybe they will soon I'm
[03:39:08] going have to put them up online it's a
[03:39:10] good pick up there all right no maybe we
[03:39:14] just do basic because we just somebody
[03:39:17] just wants to jump in and play the game
[03:39:18] maybe that's what we want to do right
[03:39:19] now go to the basic loot box just get
[03:39:22] you a little something and the whole
[03:39:22] reason for the loot boxes is mainly it's
[03:39:24] not really the gambling of any kind it's
[03:39:26] more like it's uh you actually getting
[03:39:28] packs they're pretty much worth the same
[03:39:29] price the only difference is like the
[03:39:31] only reason is I'm going to show you
[03:39:32] kind of what I'm doing here you can take
[03:39:34] this if you want I guess but what it
[03:39:36] would be is you're going to get a
[03:39:37] strength booster with it and that's why
[03:39:39] it helps because you get the strength
[03:39:41] booster with this so I I've covered up
[03:39:43] what you get you can take this one if
[03:39:44] you want
[03:39:45] I'll cover it up and give you a new one
[03:39:47] but I just trying to explain it to all
[03:39:49] you guys that are hanging out here
[03:39:50] that's why I covered it up quickly with
[03:39:51] my
[03:39:53] finger I can move my finger obviously
[03:39:55] because the finger's in the way it's all
[03:39:57] it is so you can take the one here I
[03:39:59] picked or you can give me a number and
[03:40:00] we'll play here and I just grabbed a
[03:40:01] random one because I want to see what it
[03:40:03] just explain the game to
[03:40:06] everyone Zachary I like
[03:40:13] it yeah take it all right all right so I
[03:40:16] move my

[03:49:43] have a thing for just attack and see
[03:49:44] what happens when it attacking just
[03:49:46] pretty much I have attack rolls defend
[03:49:48] roll and thing like that that's built
[03:49:49] into it all right here we go let's see
[03:49:51] what happens based on what you have for
[03:49:53] like
[03:49:54] boosters you have oh that one was a good
[03:49:57] one oh I like that I like that you got a
[03:50:00] hold of
[03:50:03] him he is now entangled and cannot
[03:50:06] move your bug goes after him and
[03:50:08] attacking clicking away clacking his
[03:50:10] legs because he can't really get that
[03:50:11] too high on him getting away his legs
[03:50:13] and oh no look at that that small Raider
[03:50:16] only had fake legs to begin with so he
[03:50:18] takes those legs right off your Raider's
[03:50:20] now down to five
[03:50:22] Health he's got no legs what are you
[03:50:24] gonna do you're just kind of holding a
[03:50:26] body there with legs dang with nothing
[03:50:28] what are you gonna do now it's the last
[03:50:30] thing before you go it's either you're
[03:50:31] gonna have to kill him you have to leave
[03:50:33] him or you're gonna have to you're gonna
[03:50:35] have to miraculously get killed by him
[03:50:37] but in the process of that he does shoot
[03:50:39] off and land one bullet onto your little

[03:56:45] you can run you can use one of those you
[03:56:48] have your laser pistol and you can
[03:56:53] attack you can see what
[03:56:56] happens send the bug to
[03:56:59] attack so you send in your little bugo
[03:57:01] buddy no your bug buddy is sent
[03:57:07] in to attack you stand back and you
[03:57:10] shoot with your laser pistol
[03:57:14] is that what we're going to
[03:57:16] do distract it and run oh we're going to
[03:57:19] distract it and run I like it I missed
[03:57:22] it distract it and run so the feral
[03:57:24] ghouls
[03:57:29] there send the you send the bug in are
[03:57:31] you gon to send the bug in to distract
[03:57:32] it because I don't know how you're going
[03:57:33] to distract
[03:57:41] it and our giveaway went through z
[03:57:44] look at that
[03:57:48] Z we have a way to distract it I don't
[03:57:51] know how you're going to distract
[03:57:53] it quest for the
[03:57:56] necropolis oh the rock throw was
[03:57:58] supposed to distract it
[03:58:01] oh I
[03:58:04] misunderstood I'm sorry I thought you
[03:58:06] were throwing the Rock at
[03:58:07] it I didn't realize you were thrown it
[03:58:10] to distract it I'm sorry about that
[03:58:14] well he's come at you now got a little
[03:58:17] bit misunderstanding
[03:58:19] there but what we can do is let's see
[03:58:21] what happens now he chased after you he
[03:58:23] kind of mad at you because you threw the
[03:58:24] rock you want to distract him with the
[03:58:26] maybe distract him with the bug and get
[03:58:28] away one two three four five six seven
[03:58:32] eight nine 10 11 12 maybe you could try
[03:58:36] uh maybe dropping um I don't know maybe
[03:58:39] using one of your boosters maybe a
[03:58:41] giggity giggity booster prob would help
[03:58:43] you to get away if you need to I'd say
[03:58:45] that
[03:58:48] one Zer said what to throw what throw
[03:58:50] the
[03:58:52] rock yeah he said um throw in the the
[03:58:56] bug there but we can do that I was
[03:58:58] saying if you want to Zer that might be
[03:58:59] a good idea because what I said was I I
[03:59:02] didn't know when you said throw the rock
[03:59:04] that you wanted to uh distract it I said
[03:59:09] when you I saw that I took it as you
[03:59:10] threw it at
[03:59:11] it then you said distract it and run
[03:59:16] so they we're going to try to distract
[03:59:19] it and run but the rock didn't work at
[03:59:23] it attacked you when you throw the Rock
[03:59:24] at
[03:59:25] it what do you want to do though you can
[03:59:27] use your giggity giggy booster and try
[03:59:28] to get
[03:59:30] away it's up to
[03:59:33] you yeah all right the giggity giggity
[03:59:36] boosters is
[03:59:38] used all right get rid of The Giggity
[03:59:40] gig booster you got that extra speed
[03:59:43] start running around
[03:59:45] that Ferro gou starts Chasing You
[03:59:48] luckily with your little bug there
[03:59:50] running behind you he doesn't really
[03:59:51] know which one to chase after he chasing
[03:59:54] has a little bug at one point where the
[03:59:57] bug scare skitters off into the

[04:33:01] was
[04:33:03] whatever the other ones came out better
[04:33:05] though I had to give it a little bit
[04:33:06] better
[04:33:07] Direction so you you send the other one
[04:33:10] away it attacks you now what are you
[04:33:11] going to do there there they get one
[04:33:13] chance
[04:33:28] left that weedling is not
[04:33:31] happy about sell some salad dressing
[04:33:33] that's not a bad idea start eating we
[04:33:35] need is green and
[04:33:39] Bonnie Mar set will be fun
[04:33:47] all
[04:33:49] right you're us a strength booster I
[04:33:51] like it you take that strength booster
[04:33:54] use that one nice good one yourself nice
[04:33:57] strong and then use your laser pistol
[04:34:00] you shoot them you go tracking towards
[04:34:01] them you smash
[04:34:03] them right at the same time getting you
[04:34:07] a nice hit against them that was a good
[04:34:09] one that brings them down to
[04:34:13] 17 Health there that was a good hit but
[04:34:15] he's not happy with you when you're that
[04:34:17] close he is pretty good with his eyes
[04:34:18] bringing you down to 51 Health that was
[04:34:20] a big hit on you oh no I don't know what
[04:34:23] you're gonna do
[04:34:24] man oh hman and Hulk are going to look
[04:34:27] pretty sweet they're gonna have to I
[04:34:28] mean I like see the problem is I really
[04:34:32] don't hope they're gonna end up doing
[04:34:33] like the Fallout type one where they
[04:34:35] don't release it as ton of them they're
[04:34:37] going to release a lot but they're not
[04:34:38] going to release it to what everybody
[04:34:40] wants if that makes sense there's so
[04:34:42] many Marvel fans that people are going
[04:34:43] to buy it for Marvel stuff and what is
[04:34:46] going to end up happening is the people
[04:34:47] that want it for magic aren't
[04:34:48] necessarily going to be able to get
[04:34:50] it aim all right I do it last shot you
[04:34:55] aim at his
[04:34:58] eyes oh that was a good one that brings
[04:35:01] him to three Health he's almost falling
[04:35:03] on the ground dead doesn't even get a
[04:35:05] chance to whip at you because he's
[04:35:06] almost dead Falls the ground
[04:35:09] starts twitching a little bit you walk
[04:35:12] up to
[04:35:13] it what do you
[04:35:19] do that would be pretty funny with Jeff
[04:35:21] goam Jeff Goldblum I have the Jeff goam
[04:35:23] ones those would be pretty sweet to put
[04:35:25] him in there with Iron Man and uh
[04:35:27] Optimus Prime yeah I could see that
[04:35:29] that'll be good y up to him me kick
[04:35:32] him you kick him while he's down he stop
[04:35:36] switching there you go he's finally
[04:35:38] done you killed him you've killed that
[04:35:42] Ling now what we're going to do
[04:35:46] is you go wandering through the

[04:37:48] I think it's uh a lot of people are
[04:37:50] looking
[04:37:51] for a lot of people are looking for uh
[04:37:54] uh what do you call it Assassin's Creed
[04:37:56] right now I still like modern Horizon
[04:37:58] here let's do a good deal on Modern
[04:38:01] Horizon we're going to do this you get

[04:38:20] somebody else
[04:38:25] YSI sarf YSI for
[04:38:32] 22
[04:38:34] ah I I just was a uh a duplicate coming
[04:38:39] in multiple times
[04:38:42] hey it happens my wife does that do
[04:38:43] times I think it has something to do
[04:38:44] with your connection like if your
[04:38:46] connection's flapping it'll send it and
[04:38:47] we'll try to repeat it and uh has to do
[04:38:50] with that IP network [ __ ] not that I
[04:38:52] need to go into explanation of it necess
[04:38:53] right
[04:38:54] [Laughter]
[04:38:55] now you know you get it all right let's
[04:38:58] do a
[04:39:00] um I let's maybe let's see maybe it is a
[04:39:03] one of these
[04:39:05] ones if you want to try your luck on
[04:39:08] this that's what it was the poor
[04:39:10] connection
[04:39:18] yeah all
[04:39:19] right give or take depends on what they
[04:39:22] are you would want to go and look at a
[04:39:24] like use TCG player or like maybe monol
[04:39:26] as an as an app to scan them so that way
[04:39:28] you can see what they are all priced at
[04:39:30] and then um you know get uh sell them
[04:39:33] that way or I mean sometimes people even
[04:39:35] buy collections like I bought one
[04:39:37] person's collection one time I didn't
[04:39:39] buy I don't do it too often but like you
[04:39:40] know like do that sometimes like if you
[04:39:42] want to on like Say on YouTube one of
[04:39:44] the people here might buy a collection
[04:39:45] from you um or maybe if it's something
[04:39:47] that is a bunch of them that I want
[04:39:49] maybe I'll buy it from you you know that
[04:39:50] type of thing um or you can go on you
[04:39:52] can sell them individually just need to
[04:39:53] use like TCG player generally for
[04:39:58] pricing they're about a 5050 uh for me
[04:40:01] at least there's a lot more
[04:40:03] singles than sealed on certain times of
[04:40:06] the day and week and and Times of the
[04:40:07] month really depending on what people
[04:40:09] are doing too you know
[04:40:15] all right so we're going to
[04:40:18] do this here and then we'll continue the
[04:40:21] adventure in our little Wasteland here I
[04:40:23] think what though is as our as we grow
[04:40:27] we have to get
[04:40:29] more ah I'll put that we have to get
[04:40:32] more people as followers on YouTube more

[04:53:39] your far we've had a lot of fun in a
[04:53:41] good time today but sometimes people
[04:53:43] it's I have a hard time KN what people
[04:53:44] want you know it's one of those things
[04:53:46] like I have a feeling that people are
[04:53:47] waiting for the some of the play like
[04:53:48] you know some of the bond stuff for
[04:53:50] Assassins but at the same time I know
[04:53:52] there's a lot of people like I don't
[04:53:53] even want that so it's like like I don't
[04:53:55] know if it's a singles day so I'm trying
[04:53:57] to still figure out like Tuesdays and
[04:53:58] Wednesdays because I'm G have taking a
[04:53:59] one day off probably a week because I'm
[04:54:01] gonna have to let my throat you know
[04:54:03] rest and I have some other stuff I'm
[04:54:04] gonna have to do I can't be going seven
[04:54:06] days a week all the time you know what I
[04:54:07] mean so I'm trying to figure out if it's
[04:54:10] Tuesday or Wednesday depending on how
[04:54:12] the things are going so I'm trying to
[04:54:13] see how things go you know if it's a
[04:54:15] singles day maybe Wednesdays or you know
[04:54:17] that type of thing so I think I might
[04:54:18] have to figure it out but we do have
[04:54:21] some cool things we do have uh nice
[04:54:22] stuff planned for Friday we do have our
[04:54:24] our Assassin's Creed and maybe if we're
[04:54:26] lucky enough we'll get the rest of it in
[04:54:28] the middle of the day well we're going
[04:54:30] into the other stuff
[04:54:33] too but that's okay everybody this
[04:54:36] currently saying thank you all for

[04:55:03] actually helps out a lot too because
[04:55:04] instead of maybe giving this away it
[04:55:05] might be a pack of cards all the time
[04:55:07] like for instance right now if I had a
[04:55:09] th subscribers on YouTube we're going to
[04:55:11] give you give this away so I'm hoping
[04:55:13] that this week we can hit that and give
[04:55:14] away a modern Horizon 3 that'd be pretty
[04:55:16] sweet for ging away a collector
[04:55:21] booster yes I do I think it's when
[04:55:23] people are like in between lunch
[04:55:25] breakfast and getting to work and then
[04:55:28] once they're at work it picks up again
[04:55:30] because they don't want to work or
[04:55:31] they're at lunch break or something like
[04:55:33] that so it's a timing of things so I do
[04:55:35] have a good timing of it it's just slow
[04:55:36] on certain days of the week and I think
[04:55:38] it's just the uh you know the day of the

[00:00:00] part of the reason why I was late this
[00:00:01] morning uh had to take a TV down and had
[00:00:05] a bit of an
[00:00:08] issue my wife thinks it's a funny story
[00:00:10] now after I told it the different way
[00:00:11] that I told it after I told her what H
[00:00:13] like this I explained what happened and
[00:00:14] the reason why I got hurt she started
[00:00:16] laughing she like you know see how
[00:00:18] that's funny I'm like I don't know if
[00:00:19] that was
[00:00:20] funny she goes no it definitely the
[00:00:22] reenactment of it you can do the check
[00:00:24] in
[00:00:24] now you can run that check in
[00:00:27] now but yeah she said uh but that's why
[00:00:30] I'm a little a little late this
[00:00:32] morning we had a a minor
[00:00:36] issue getting our stuff
[00:00:39] running that's okay that's okay it was
[00:00:42] it was I had to take a TV down let me
[00:00:44] get her uh off of off of a mount we had
[00:00:47] a bit of an issue getting off the mount
[00:00:49] the uh so what happened was the
[00:00:52] um the
[00:00:55] TV when I I told my wife I had I'm on
[00:00:58] screwed in I had I loosen the screws
[00:01:00] well like I didn't think I losen all I
[00:01:02] like I unscrewed the complete top ones
[00:01:05] so she tried losing the bottom ones well
[00:01:07] the first it didn't come on loose then
[00:01:09] then I guess the second one it didn't
[00:01:11] come on loose well after that second
[00:01:12] time I was like all right I can't hold
[00:01:14] this any longer I've been holding it for
[00:01:16] a while and I've had to readjust now
[00:01:17] like four
[00:01:18] times
[00:01:20] bot oh she thought o she thought I took
[00:01:23] the bottom ones out already and she was
[00:01:24] just trying to take top ones out she
[00:01:26] didn't realize I just said I loosen them
[00:01:28] so that she would take all the screws
[00:01:30] out while I was holding it well she took
[00:01:33] top screws out whatever so she took the
[00:01:36] wrong ones out and she didn't get them
[00:01:37] out the the first time so like even the
[00:01:39] first time I had like readjust [ __ ] I'm
[00:01:40] done then it didn't come down well then
[00:01:44] finally on the third time she goes I
[00:01:45] have him out I'm like no you don't I'm
[00:01:47] losing it St what about dropping the TV
[00:01:50] on myself luckily it's still held in by
[00:01:52] Juan screw and that's why I gotta that's
[00:01:56] why I got this on my arm
[00:01:59] I got a little injured today we weren't
[00:02:01] sure if I was going to be doing the show
[00:02:03] my uh my arm was sore and my my wife
[00:02:05] being a nurse threw the ice on it
[00:02:07] checked it out a little
[00:02:08] bit I'm good it was just a probably
[00:02:11] tweaked from holding the TV up like I
[00:02:13] know a 65 inch TV for a while on my head
[00:02:16] like this [ __ ] for like no 10 minutes
[00:02:19] because I got it down I got it down no
[00:02:21] you don't no you don't I'm losing it I'm
[00:02:23] losing it a [ __ ] and then finally like
[00:02:28] you know the second the fourth time got
[00:02:30] it off and I'm like I actually had to
[00:02:31] grasp it with this hand so I didn't lose
[00:02:34] it and that's why this arm is so sh sore
[00:02:36] because it was starting to like fall
[00:02:37] backwards and I like rent you know like
[00:02:39] you like a catcher throws like a
[00:02:41] baseball where they just kind of stand
[00:02:42] up and they throw with their F like just
[00:02:44] go forward well that's kind of the
[00:02:45] position I was in and it was just
[00:02:47] started to go back so I had to like use
[00:02:49] all of my arm to stop it from going back
[00:02:51] and like ripping so I like fallowing to
[00:02:54] the ground so I it just no fun my arm
[00:02:56] just now my arm's sore so if I'm only
[00:02:58] like doing like te acct baby pterodactyl
[00:03:01] openings today or like no T-Rex openings
[00:03:03] it's because my arm can't stick out as
[00:03:04] far we'll call this T-Rex opening day
[00:03:07] maybe I don't
[00:03:08] know let me get some let me get the
[00:03:10] giveaways added in there I forgot to do
[00:03:12] that I forgot to do
[00:03:17] that yeah so that's why we're here right
[00:03:19] now that's what we're
[00:03:23] doing so we're going to get those
[00:03:25] running let's see we'll put one of those
[00:03:28] in here I'm going to do
[00:03:31] YSI yep wasn't well we weren't sure
[00:03:33] right at
[00:03:35] first we weren't sure at first because I
[00:03:38] was a little bit sore for a while all
[00:03:40] right we're going to do
[00:03:42] 20 so that's why I'm saying things are
[00:03:44] going to be closer than normal here 1
[00:03:46] two three four five 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
[00:03:51] 14 15 16 17 18
[00:03:56] 1920 but yeah we're here hanging out
[00:04:06] T-Rex Tuesday yeah I
[00:04:10] know oh I know so my arm will be here

[00:04:16] far ferocious Friday I like
[00:04:21] it ferocious Friday that's a good one
[00:04:27] Landon I like that one I like that one
[00:04:30] one I might have to use it next time if
[00:04:32] I have another T-Rex arm day and it's a
[00:04:34] Friday hopefully I have no more T-Rex
[00:04:36] arm days out see that's the problem that
[00:04:38] that was my hopefully we don't have any
[00:04:40] more of
[00:04:41] those oh my back's now sore though too
[00:04:44] probably I'm G to be in pain all day
[00:04:45] that's what's gonna happen right now we
[00:04:47] knew it but let's get
[00:04:51] a let's get like a pack deal out for now
[00:04:54] let's see what we can get oh I can't
[00:04:55] move that arm no we're going to have to
[00:04:56] do the left arm
[00:04:57] today we're going to do a pack deal
[00:05:01] we're going to start something out
[00:05:04] today fiery fry oh yeah back pain Friday
[00:05:08] I know I'm like I'm leaning over like oh
[00:05:10] no old man day oh no I'm an old man
[00:05:13] today yep well no good all right we're
[00:05:16] gonna do this one that we've done a
[00:05:17] couple times all right I like doing this
[00:05:20] one because I feel like this is a good
[00:05:24] deal you can
[00:05:28] do one two three
[00:05:31] four modern Horizon play boosters or a
[00:05:34] collector
[00:05:36] booster that's what we'll
[00:05:42] do and we'll put it like that
[00:05:47] out so if my voice is a little cracking
[00:05:49] too it was also I was screaming I'm
[00:05:50] gonna [ __ ] drop it I'm gonna drop the
[00:05:52] [ __ ] thing so that's little Poss
[00:05:54] possibly the reason why my voice is a
[00:05:55] little cracky today too
[00:06:00] for those that do not hear that's the
[00:06:01] reason why I'm a little late getting on

[00:06:04] I accident dropping down didn't try to
[00:06:07] didn't drop the TV might be broken we're
[00:06:09] not sure it could have been cracked in
[00:06:10] the corner when I gripped
[00:06:11] it we had 65 in curve Sam Samsung TV I
[00:06:16] was up on a wall above of a above a
[00:06:19] fireplace so
[00:06:22] yeah [ __ ] no it's done the whole scen uh
[00:06:26] no there's a good chance the whole thing
[00:06:28] will be toasted because probably slided
[00:06:30] cracks throughout the
[00:06:33] screen we'll see maybe we're lucky and
[00:06:36] it didn't
[00:06:40] crack I was going to say it doesn't
[00:06:41] matter we're not going to be using it
[00:06:42] anyways I guess we're going to sell it

[00:09:58] got long story short
[00:10:00] uh TV you're getting it off this morning
[00:10:02] that's why the show I wasn't sure if I
[00:10:04] was going to have the show this morning
[00:10:05] I was a little frustrated injured and
[00:10:07] not feeling well uh TV was on the wall
[00:10:11] what I was mad I was a little pissed off
[00:10:15] had a little a a little frustrated the
[00:10:17] uh the painters were supposed to be here
[00:10:19] um and they were supposed to be able to
[00:10:20] help with some things they said they
[00:10:22] weren't here so I had to take some of
[00:10:23] the things down myself um in the process
[00:10:26] of taking it down I got
[00:10:28] a ding on my shoulder not a ding on my
[00:10:31] shoulder my shoulder sore from holding
[00:10:32] TV up and my wife when she was I told
[00:10:35] her I had all the screws on loosened so
[00:10:37] she could take the TV down well she
[00:10:39] thought I only had the top ones undone
[00:10:41] or one of the bottom ones undone or
[00:10:43] something like that so she didn't undo
[00:10:44] all of them and then I had to rearrange
[00:10:47] holding the the TV the 65 inch curve TV
[00:10:51] we have like three times and on the
[00:10:53] fourth time when it wasn't fully down I
[00:10:55] almost dropped it and in that process
[00:11:00] my arm was like out like this this is my
[00:11:01] other arm my other arm was out like this
[00:11:03] I'm holding it the TV and like I'm going
[00:11:05] to drop it I'm going to drop it [ __ ] and
[00:11:06] it's like leaning back and as it's
[00:11:08] leaning back further it's kind of like
[00:11:09] when you're like in the pitcher like
[00:11:10] when you're position as like you're a
[00:11:12] catcher and you're getting ready to
[00:11:12] throw the ball it was like that but it
[00:11:14] was in this arm obviously and I was
[00:11:16] losing I was having the weight on it
[00:11:17] because it was twisting because the
[00:11:18] weight was like unhooked on one side and
[00:11:22] I had to grab it and grip it enough and
[00:11:23] my arm just like tweaked the wrong way
[00:11:26] and my shoulders sore so hope my ner was
[00:11:29] a nurse and checked it out I'm able to

[00:13:20] standing straight up so that was the
[00:13:23] problem I was standing straight up
[00:13:24] because the TV's mounted on a wall and
[00:13:26] it's above a fireplace so that's what
[00:13:28] was happen that's that's the reason why
[00:13:29] that happened it wouldn't have happened
[00:13:31] you know what I
[00:13:35] mean one two three four five six seven
[00:13:41] eight

[00:14:16] myself last time with
[00:14:19] um what did I use I had something I I
[00:14:23] can't remember how I had it set up so I
[00:14:24] could hook it up myself oh it's because
[00:14:27] I was able to hook the the plate on and
[00:14:28] do it a little different so we took down
[00:14:30] differently this time because we didn't
[00:14:31] want we need to leave the whole Mount up
[00:14:32] there rather than taking the whole Mount

[00:37:30] you you did bandage me you're a nurse
[00:37:32] and you bandag me well still sore I
[00:37:34] can't lift my arm right now which is not
[00:37:36] a good sign
[00:37:37] stuff might have to actually go to the
[00:37:39] doctor on this
[00:37:40] one that
[00:37:43] sucks we'll see I was hoping I didn't
[00:37:46] need
[00:37:52] to there you go can't lift because it
[00:37:54] hurts or can't lift it physically can't
[00:37:56] lift it because it's it hurts when I
[00:37:57] lift it it's sore when I do
[00:38:02] it I
[00:38:04] know I know I know I
[00:38:07] know realized I my chair work you don't
[00:38:11] have a chair
[00:38:13] now um no the guy ended up so long story
[00:38:17] not a long story my mom's um dog is old
[00:38:21] and had to go to the vat because it was
[00:38:23] having like they thought it was dying it
[00:38:24] was like like walking around weirdly and
[00:38:27] passing out and other stuff and not
[00:38:29] breathing well so they thought it was
[00:38:30] dying so they had to bring it to the vet
[00:38:32] so I told the guy I was going to be a b
[00:38:33] later because I couldn't bring my kids
[00:38:34] over right away to my mom which is where
[00:38:36] they were going to go while the house
[00:38:37] was being painted which he knew about
[00:38:38] when we dropped the boat off the other
[00:38:39] day and he goes yeah I'm just going to
[00:38:40] pass on it like all right like that's
[00:38:43] fine I'm like I had three other people
[00:38:44] that were interested which just sucks
[00:38:45] that I didn't get a chance to talk to
[00:38:47] him earlier instead of dealing with that
[00:38:49] you know he could have told me the other
[00:38:50] day because there's a person that wanted
[00:38:52] to almost come and see it but because I
[00:38:56] didn't know until later in the day
[00:38:58] because he didn't respond to me until
[00:38:59] like 3: I didn't know to be able to say
[00:39:01] it to the other person so it kind of
[00:39:02] sucked that way but whatever [ __ ]
[00:39:04] happens

[00:40:42] just checked in like one time in that
[00:40:45] five
[00:40:48] minutes it would spike it up really
[00:40:50] quickly but not everybody

[00:41:05] right let's do it all right we have our

[00:41:29] or
[00:41:30] something take over the character deal
[00:41:32] in a minute or do you want to see if
[00:41:35] um the next person rural wants to do it

[00:41:51] right for Infinity
[00:41:54] um bandage it harder I know
[00:41:58] I'm trying to
[00:42:00] think if we wanted to do a few of them
[00:42:02] let me see what I can
[00:42:04] do it's like I said I didn't get the
[00:42:06] best deal on
[00:42:08] those I just kind of picked them up so I
[00:42:12] figure at some point they're not going
[00:42:13] to be around as much and if people want
[00:42:14] them they'd want them and I have a
[00:42:22] one think the man wants land
[00:42:28] let me figure it out here
[00:43:00] I could do if we wanted to do a few of
[00:43:02] them I could do like 62 for
[00:43:09] three but I have um it's the whatnot
[00:43:12] like I said the fees with whatnot and
[00:43:13] everything are pretty high they've
[00:43:14] gotten they like they rais them recently
[00:43:16] or July they're raising him maybe it's
[00:43:18] next month I remember they ra they're

[00:43:27] a shockingly good land I
[00:43:38] know that's good that's
[00:43:42] good so I can do that if you'd
[00:43:47] like

[02:07:42] version for a dollar
[02:07:52] then we can go with some of
[02:07:58] these um I'm not losing anything I'm
[02:08:01] breaking even right now it's really what
[02:08:03] it
[02:08:04] is um some days yeah some days I do
[02:08:08] better than
[02:08:10] others but I'm not having made big big
[02:08:12] profit on anything at the moment that's
[02:08:15] what you're looking
[02:08:18] for but one of the things is is I just
[02:08:20] have fun with it so I get to have a
[02:08:22] little bit of money that we
[02:08:25] make this is going to go for three
[02:08:27] instead of uh
[02:08:29] five oh I might have that hey not bad
[02:08:33] smash how's it
[02:08:35] going oh nice little short break we like
[02:08:38] the short
[02:08:39] breaks I might have an Itali Primal
[02:08:42] storm
[02:08:45] somewhere wait no I think somebody
[02:08:47] pulled it out recently not me it wasn't
[02:08:49] me that got it that was it it's not me
[02:08:51] me it wasn't me that got it I'm
[02:08:55] sorry yeah see what it is is I have to
[02:08:58] say if once I sell a certain cards I
[02:08:59] make profit too that's the other thing
[02:09:01] too so some of the cards that I have I
[02:09:03] haven't had sold yet which I
[02:09:05] mean if I sell the monry and the two
[02:09:09] serialized cards and a couple the other
[02:09:10] ones I'm going to have a few grand
[02:09:12] profit so it's not like I don't can't
[02:09:14] it's just I'm not necessarily pushing it
[02:09:16] because I'm putting a lot of back into
[02:09:17] buying stuff the for the store so I
[02:09:19] could be taking money out of my myself
[02:09:21] in a little bit profit but I'm breaking
[02:09:22] more even because I keep buying stuff to
[02:09:24] grow more so it's a little
[02:09:29] different there you go the previous card
[02:09:34] I think we had that out for uh $2 if I
[02:09:37] remember
[02:09:38] right or three no for the foil I think
[02:09:41] it was $3 on the foil $3 on the foil on
[02:09:43] the last
[02:09:46] card
[02:09:47] Castle I put you with your other pack

[02:55:52] Kelly premium box was right here is your
[02:55:55] one there that's your number that you

[02:56:00] Kelly I got a little messed up
[02:56:03] here kid Kelly told me number 13 I took
[02:56:07] number 13 out that's this one right here
[02:56:10] okay we're good I got a little messed up

[02:56:21] took 23 out of there I did not take 13
[02:56:24] that's why I want to make sure kid Kelly
[02:56:25] I messed up on that I was paying
[02:56:27] attention I had the wrong box in front
[02:56:28] of me am I right or not I just want to
[02:56:31] make sure kid before I do this I think I
[02:56:34] was I took 23 out of the wrong ones is
[02:56:36] what I'm
[02:56:39] saying do you

[03:21:32] propane yeah my my youngest is my oldest
[03:21:35] is pretty smart too but he's like
[03:21:36] extremely stupid at times that's the
[03:21:37] only problem I feel like when they're
[03:21:39] really smart they're really stupid in
[03:21:40] different
[03:21:42] areas yes they got to evolve their
[03:21:44] brains I guess so we're going to put
[03:21:47] out one of these there yes
[03:21:53] what um um medium super yeah super Shake
[03:21:58] super shake with no barbecue or
[03:22:03] Mayo okay we're going to do this here
[03:22:07] we're going to run those we're going to
[03:22:08] run them if does anybody want these as a
[03:22:11] pack of them or should I run them at one
[03:22:12] at a time if somebody wants these as a
[03:22:14] pack do let me know I'll run these all
[03:22:17] together as a deal so instead of like
[03:22:19] doing that like an individual run here
[03:22:21] like this you could get all all four of
[03:22:24] them for a pack for a deal if you want
[03:22:26] so let's say we do all four of them
[03:22:31] for
[03:22:34] this so you get all four of these right
[03:22:37] now now the only problem is it doesn't
[03:22:40] let me do it whenever I have multiple
[03:22:42] pack cards I do have to do them as a
[03:22:44] different shipping that's the only
[03:22:45] problem because I have that certain
[03:22:47] amount for that that's why I don't like
[03:22:49] doing it this way too often when you
[03:22:51] have multiple cards like this unless
[03:22:54] we're going to do like a larger amount
[03:22:56] so we're going to go we're going to do
[03:22:57] that right now and start it there and
[03:22:59] we're going to throw it out for the
[03:23:01] $6 that DCR giveaway winner went

[03:42:40] didn't want to drop the TV so I had to
[03:42:42] like protect it and I don't know if I
[03:42:45] broke it or not we'll find out when we
[03:42:46] plug it in later little flare of
[03:42:49] fortitude for
[03:42:51] you there you go for the foil flare
[03:42:57] fortitude I should have sold some of
[03:42:59] these a lot earlier because they're all
[03:43:01] they always dip in price should have
[03:43:03] been I should have got them right on
[03:43:06] right on there but you guys now get a
[03:43:07] good deal on
[03:43:08] them
[03:43:10] wole that was like a $9 card at one
[03:43:12] point
[03:43:17] waple 22 EP I like
[03:43:24] it Ah that's pretty much I figured
[03:43:27] actually I figured I I tweaked my
[03:43:28] rotator comp I did I messed it up when I
[03:43:30] was younger in school um I ruined my I
[03:43:33] actually wrecked my my U my shoulder for
[03:43:35] a while when I was younger I had a
[03:43:37] uh shoulder injury wrestling where the
[03:43:40] pec muscle was ripped off and it was
[03:43:41] like a little ball over here they had to
[03:43:42] actually put it all back together and um
[03:43:45] like I have a couple little marks on it
[03:43:46] and then um I had a little rip and tear
[03:43:49] in the pec muscle from when somebody how
[03:43:50] somebody had pulled on me when I was
[03:43:51] wrestling and then my rotator cuff had a
[03:43:54] minor couple tears that in there that
[03:43:55] needed to be like healed so yeah I
[03:43:57] understand that it just
[03:43:59] sucks just sucks that's
[03:44:02] all we'll figure it out but thank you I
[03:44:06] will do some of that stuff yeah as long
[03:44:07] as I can move it
[03:44:08] around it's probably just a sprain like
[03:44:10] you said is what I was guessing that was
[03:44:12] my guess just for the fact of I can
[03:44:14] still move it's just painful to
[03:44:17] move and I've had ripped muscles before
[03:44:20] and major like broken bones RI muscles
[03:44:23] so like it doesn't feel like that it
[03:44:25] just feels like it's tender it's because
[03:44:27] I overdid it really what it is we going
[03:44:30] to throw out this flare and I want to
[03:44:31] keep this flare if no one wants it

[03:44:35] going to throw it out for that no heavy
[03:44:37] lifting for a month yes I
[03:44:39] know not with that arm which is going to

[03:52:41] injury this morning but we're back we're
[03:52:43] okay we're not we're not dead we're
[03:52:53] living track your cards all right so
[03:52:56] mahaj we have give me um you have two
[03:53:00] options the ones that are going out
[03:53:03] they're not going to have the they'll
[03:53:05] have give me one second give me one
[03:53:07] second here Wrath of the sky is I'm
[03:53:10] going to throw out
[03:53:13] here
[03:53:16] for
[03:53:19] and let me see your stuff
[03:53:24] here get your name vix oh look at that
[03:53:28] you came right in to get
[03:53:33] something let me get this here over this
[03:53:37] and all right so currently what it is is
[03:53:41] you have two of them and they are going
[03:53:42] to be going at um they they do in the pl
[03:53:44] white envelope so you don't get the
[03:53:47] tracking on those ones because that's
[03:53:48] why we have the Cheap shipping we do on
[03:53:50] the plane white envelope but if you do
[03:53:52] get one more card I believe it gets up
[03:53:54] to the rate the one with tracking
[03:53:56] because you get two of them at that and
[03:53:57] then I think it has because the pricing
[03:53:58] of it and it will get up higher there
[03:54:00] you go that's what that is there it'll
[03:54:02] get shipped out and then you get like a
[03:54:04] little tracking number it'll say it was
[03:54:05] shipped once it gets it'll you should
[03:54:07] get a lit a thing that says here's your
[03:54:09] tracking number even still I
[03:54:11] think Gibby for vickas
[03:54:15] expel the
[03:54:25] Unworthy Mumu Vic is Mumu there we go
[03:54:30] then we're going to go with you said
[03:54:31] number 10 all right number 10 there I
[03:54:33] like
[03:54:35] it we're to put this one
[03:54:41] back no no no no you should get a um you
[03:54:43] should get a number you should get a
[03:54:45] number in your in your email when it's
[03:54:47] when everything gets shipped out it just
[03:54:48] hasn't been marked or shipped yet
[03:54:50] because the show's not
[03:54:53] over so give me one second give me one
[03:54:56] second I I'll I'll um let me find
[03:54:59] something show it a little bit
[03:55:03] here all right so here let me um let me
[03:55:05] do this
[03:55:07] here so you're going to get one of those
[03:55:09] numbers that has like the tracking
[03:55:10] number thing and it will say USPS
[03:55:13] something when your thing is shipped out
[03:55:14] out they'll have a tracking number I'm
[03:55:16] not going to give you the exact tracking
[03:55:17] number I'm just going to give you like
[03:55:19] part of something here all right when it
[03:55:21] gets shipped you're going to get
[03:55:22] something it'll say tracking number blah
[03:55:24] blah blah you should get an email that
[03:55:26] says it was track shipped your tracking
[03:55:28] number is whatever is there um so that's
[03:55:31] what you should get now if you end up
[03:55:32] getting like one more single it'll end
[03:55:34] up upgrading it to the tracking where it
[03:55:35] is um like you can track it from being
[03:55:38] exactly what happened to it versus like
[03:55:40] it's tracking for its location versus
[03:55:42] this will just say it shipped and then
[03:55:44] you'll get it in a few days if that
[03:55:46] makes
[03:55:47] sense that help at all hopefully that
[03:55:49] helps M

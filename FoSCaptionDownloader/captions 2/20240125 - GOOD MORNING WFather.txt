[01:04:10] you got to do is yell out which one you
[01:04:11] want if you want any of
[01:04:13] those and I'm going to take a look to
[01:04:15] see if I have anything else that's spicy
[01:04:17] for a uh for a Fairy Deck while those
[01:04:20] ones are up there let me see if I can
[01:04:22] find anything else here I'm going to
[01:04:23] just kind of keep keep looking a little
[01:04:25] bit keep looking a little bit for a SP
[01:04:28] spicy fairy fairy deck
[01:04:33] stuff Guardian protect but I don't have
[01:04:36] I have that in I think in an anime
[01:04:37] version of
[01:04:39] it tribute to the world
[01:04:42] tree Cloud Stone
[01:04:51] curio let's see let's see what else else
[01:04:54] I got
[01:04:56] there what's gandf do just curious so
[01:05:00] gandf you got two of them we have Gand
[01:05:03] off the white flash you may cast
[01:05:04] legendary spells and the artifact spells
[01:05:06] as though they had flash if a legendary
[01:05:08] permit or an artifact entering or
[01:05:10] leaving the battlefield causes a
[01:05:12] triggered ability of a permanent you
[01:05:13] control to trigger that ability triggers
[01:05:16] in additional time then the other one is
[01:05:19] whenever you cast an instant or a
[01:05:20] sorcery spell from your hand during an
[01:05:23] opponent's turn Exile that card with
[01:05:25] three times three time counters on it
[01:05:27] instead of putting it into your
[01:05:29] graveyard as it resolves then if an
[01:05:31] exile card doesn't have suspend it gain
[01:05:35] suspend that's what those uh those ones
[01:05:37] were there if you want one of those I
[01:05:39] can throw them on uh I can throw that on
[01:05:41] again yeah I could throw those on again
[01:05:44] for $10 if you would like one of
[01:05:47] those um and then what I'm going to do
[01:05:49] here is I'm going to keep going with
[01:05:51] some of um I threw some of those singles
[01:05:53] on so um if you are interested let me
[01:05:55] know I'll put them back on again but I'm
[01:05:58] going to keep kind of scrolling through
[01:05:59] trying to find if there's anything spicy
[01:06:00] in here for a uh Fairy Deck
[01:06:03] for as at Craig's
[01:06:07] request
[01:06:09] um
[01:06:11] there and then I'm going to keep
[01:06:14] going probably find an on foil cause
[01:06:17] yeah I know the foil version the foil
[01:06:20] versions add a little bit more I know
[01:06:22] that but um a lot of stuff that I open
[01:06:24] is like collector booster stuffff so
[01:06:26] that's why a lot of the times it's like
[01:06:28] the foils is where we are hey maybe
[01:06:31] we're going to try some Manas today for
[01:06:32] some monoc Crips or a
[01:06:35] um yeah yeah that's why a lot of the
[01:06:38] stuff I have is like foil or like
[01:06:40] alternate art because a lot of things
[01:06:41] that my family open here is like uh are
[01:06:43] always um collector boosters um very
[01:06:47] rarely do we open anything else that
[01:06:48] isn't it's just more uh what the kids
[01:06:51] have been liking that makes any sense
[01:06:55] s and then we're going to put these ones
[01:06:57] on
[01:07:02] for it's going to be 32 for these three
[01:07:04] if you want
[01:07:06] them three packs on
[01:07:13] screen we going to make that sudden
[01:07:15] death there for
[01:07:18] 32 yeah the kids like hey we want to
[01:07:21] open packs is we do our YouTube thing
[01:07:22] and then a lot of the stuff just goes in
[01:07:24] here if we don't keep it is really what
[01:07:26] it boils down to actually if you ever
[01:07:28] see any of our YouTube videos every one
[01:07:30] of those that we do all the openings
[01:07:31] everything ends up going into either a
[01:07:33] single or a pole box or something like
[01:07:36] that we end up doing um for for it's
[01:07:39] just pretty much that's the whole reason
[01:07:41] of having the YouTube channel is to
[01:07:42] having this is to pay for the YouTube
[01:07:44] channel with the kid that's what he
[01:07:45] wanted to do and I have some fun doing
[01:07:47] this for you guys in the morning and I'm
[01:07:49] able to buy more packs for the family
[01:07:51] and have fun with that and kind of know
[01:07:52] that's how it goes
[01:07:55] that's really the whole point of this
[01:07:56] that's why I started doing it was to uh
[01:07:59] have fun with the YouTube channel with
[01:08:00] my kids and let me see if I have I'm
[01:08:02] sorry I got sidetracked talking about
[01:08:04] that for a second let me see if I have
[01:08:05] what I have for singles here I'm GNA
[01:08:07] throw up U my next set of singles I'll

[01:09:22] singles if you would like any of them
[01:09:25] $15 a piece for any of those and let me

[01:09:35] protect that might be something you'll
[01:09:37] be interested in but I don't know I
[01:09:39] don't think I have much else for a Fairy
[01:09:40] Deck that would be
[01:09:42] spicy glads dismissal surge
[01:09:46] foil permission deny blood skull sport t
[01:09:52] theal greater
[01:09:54] oh would that be something
[01:09:58] spicy greater aracy
[01:10:07] anime I thought I had one thing and that
[01:10:09] was it I think that's the one thing that
[01:10:11] I have
[01:10:14] oo
[01:10:15] o is that one intriguing is that one
[01:10:20] spicy is that one a spicy one then I
[01:10:24] have oh I do have a pack
[01:10:26] negation sh Rod there burrow Downs
[01:10:30] Paradise oh there you go oh that's an
[01:10:32] angel
[01:10:34] though all right let's see no confetti
[01:10:39] ristics uh my confetti cards I believe I
[01:10:43] ended up I ended up actually selling I
[01:10:45] think most of my confetti
[01:10:48] cards but that's what uh that's kind of
[01:10:50] what I got there for cards I don't know
[01:10:55] if the uh that one there is spicy I'll
[01:10:57] throw that out in a minute there roaming
[01:11:00] Throne yes I do have a roaming Throne
[01:11:02] back there I have actually multiple
[01:11:03] roaming
[01:11:04] Thrones here we
[01:11:07] go do not have a confetti ristic um I
[01:11:11] believe I have a ristic study but it's
[01:11:13] not a confetti let me find that roaming
[01:11:15] Throne there was a roaming Throne back
[01:11:17] here correct you did see that there was
[01:11:20] a roaming Throne back
[01:11:22] here believe it was a foil roaming
[01:11:26] Throne if I remember right foil roaming
[01:11:29] Throne that is correct you did see that
[01:11:32] there and I don't know if I I don't
[01:11:34] think I have any others I think I only
[01:11:35] have this foil
[01:11:37] one I think I only have the foil
[01:11:42] one why do those all go the
[01:11:48] front why' those all go to the front
[01:11:51] that's so
[01:11:52] weird
[01:11:54] oh I put in the wrong
[01:11:57] spot probably why all right yeah roing
[01:12:01] Throne right
[01:12:03] there not a bad one yeah could be okay
[01:12:06] with
[01:12:06] fairies that's a that's a nice spicy one
[01:12:09] too
[01:12:11] foil Roman Throne enters the battlefield
[01:12:13] chooses creature type Roman Throne is
[01:12:15] chosen creature type in addition to
[01:12:16] other types so trigger ability of
[01:12:19] another creature you control of the
[01:12:21] chosen type triggers it triggers an
[01:12:23] additional time that actually would be
[01:12:25] pretty good for a Fairy Deck throwing
[01:12:27] that in there to uh spice that up and
[01:12:29] Trigger out all those extra plus one
[01:12:31] plus one abilities so I I have the uh I
[01:12:33] have the Fairy Deck too
[01:12:35] so that might be a spicy one
[01:12:42] maybe but I know let me let what do you
[01:12:45] think there let me um Let me throw on
[01:12:48] while you guys think about those singles

[01:14:59] pack deal of some kind you guys can
[01:15:01] throw it out there I'm not the only one
[01:15:02] picking them out everything that is in
[01:15:05] my buy now I believe I double checked
[01:15:08] last night when I put it in so
[01:15:12] unless secret
[01:15:14] layers
[01:15:16] um I
[01:15:18] have the only secret layers that I have
[01:15:22] that I would be willing to part
[01:15:25] with would
[01:15:28] be
[01:15:30] potentially my Jurassic Park ones that
[01:15:33] are the nonf
[01:15:35] foils but those are the only ones that I
[01:15:37] got
[01:15:39] recently I know meetings suck they are
[01:15:43] not sealed though no I opened them up
[01:15:45] because we we did a box opening they are
[01:15:47] not sealed no they are in top loaders
[01:15:49] they're not sealed so that's it but um
[01:15:53] no my we had gotten for the family so if
[01:15:54] there was like something you wanted
[01:15:56] specifically or the whole thing we could
[01:15:57] do that but that would be
[01:15:59] it uh let me see let me throw on a pack
[01:16:02] deal for everybody here let's do this
[01:16:05] for actually you know what I was going
[01:16:06] to do singles I said I was going to do
[01:16:07] some singles let's do this let's go
[01:16:10] through I know not everybody likes the
[01:16:12] dollar singles but I'm gonna go some
[01:16:14] dollar singles
[01:16:18] here and I have a lot of dollar singles
[01:16:22] so just put this on for two minutes to
[01:16:24] scroll through them all and if you like
[01:16:26] any of them yeah I know meetings suck
[01:16:28] Mike I hate them if you like any of them
[01:16:30] just say well I'm scrolling
[01:16:34] through all right let's get a chunk out
[01:16:36] and I'm just going to keep going through
[01:16:39] them yeah so like I like this is a whole
[01:16:42] week of meetings like I've all week long
[01:16:44] I've had meetings I just can't stand it
[01:16:46] it's like one of those like oh my God
[01:16:48] what is going on here why are you doing
[01:16:50] this to me even the rest everybody on
[01:16:52] the team is like getting meeting out too
[01:16:54] because you're sitting there in a
[01:16:55] meeting for like six hours out a day and
[01:16:59] you just can't stand it your brain
[01:17:00] starts shutting off you drift off into
[01:17:04] nothingness so not if few uh these are
[01:17:06] all the dollar ones
[01:17:09] here can't read them all very quickly
[01:17:11] but if you want any of them you should
[01:17:13] be able to see them all right there to
[01:17:15] be able to make a choice on if you want
[01:17:16] anything there I've added a few new ones
[01:17:19] to the dollars you can always tell me to
[01:17:22] slow down or
[01:17:23] stop if it's something that you want to
[01:17:26] because as you can see there's surge
[01:17:27] foils and stuff in there so it might be
[01:17:28] a little hard to read them as I
[01:17:31] move so that's all I was saying the
[01:17:33] reason
[01:17:35] why what was the first card White
[01:17:39] Dove the eagle of
[01:17:44] Deliverance it's uh Lord of the Rings
[01:17:46] Eagle of Deliverance creature bird
[01:17:48] Soldier flying when Eagle of Deliverance
[01:17:50] enters the battle field put an
[01:17:51] indestructible counter on another Target
[01:17:53] creature you control draw a card if that
[01:17:55] creature's power is two or
[01:17:58] less yep no
[01:18:01] problem we have flame couple invasions
[01:18:06] and
[01:18:11] foil yeah so yeah I get to sit through
[01:18:13] meetings all day that's what I get to
[01:18:15] look forward to for the rest of my day
[01:18:17] today I'm like oh great this
[01:18:21] sucks so I figure I'll scroll through
[01:18:25] these those are my first batch there did
[01:18:28] anybody like anything out of those if
[01:18:30] not I will go through the second batch
[01:18:33] here
[01:18:34] again all right I'll do my second batch
[01:18:37] of them right here hold on a second I'm
[01:18:40] G to run that again for two
[01:18:42] minutes seems to give me enough time to
[01:18:44] get through these now as you can see a
[01:18:47] lot of them are foils surge foils
[01:18:49] extended Arts like I said
[01:18:51] before when my family opens stuff it's
[01:18:54] always um collector boosters most of the
[01:18:56] time very rarely are we opening um sets
[01:19:00] and it's really the only time you open a
[01:19:02] set is if we can't find collectors or
[01:19:04] we're doing like a a battle against a
[01:19:06] set versus a collector trying to see
[01:19:09] what is more valuable for you to get
[01:19:11] whether you want to get a set or
[01:19:12] collector for the um box that comes out
[01:19:15] so if there is anything you want tell me
[01:19:17] to slow down and stop but these are all
[01:19:19] a dollar each you can stack them you can
[01:19:23] just get one of them whatever you'd
[01:19:26] like gr buy a bunch of them if you want
[01:19:28] I've had people come on before and buy
[01:19:30] like three at a
[01:19:31] time how many serial eyes has my family
[01:19:33] pulled we have
[01:19:36] pulled five serialized
[01:19:39] cards uh of serialized Doctor Who I
[01:19:43] pulled a
[01:19:45] serialize um Ravnica my son pulled a
[01:19:48] serialize Ravnica which is out in the
[01:19:51] YouTube video we're going to have out
[01:19:52] this week
[01:19:53] um the I pulled a serialized Ravnica I
[01:19:57] pulled two I pulled a serialized Ravnica
[01:20:00] so that's only four no and then the
[01:20:01] monoc Crypt the monoc Crypt um I pulled
[01:20:05] a monoc crypt and my son William also
[01:20:07] pulled a dwarfen soul ring um so he
[01:20:12] pulled that he's also pulled out a bunch
[01:20:15] of uh confetti ones he actually pulled
[01:20:17] out the ristic study confetti that I had
[01:20:20] he a d a uh a I pulled out doubling
[01:20:23] season confetti so I pulled out a lot of
[01:20:25] good cards
[01:20:28] there I did pull out cyclonic Rift uh
[01:20:31] but not a not a uh not a h serialized
[01:20:34] one though I did have a cyclonic Rift
[01:20:36] that I sold actually
[01:20:38] yesterday um it wasn't the serialized
[01:20:41] version but if anybody wants any of
[01:20:42] those those were a dollar you can see
[01:20:45] what they were there and I'll will go
[01:20:46] through those at another time but yeah
[01:20:49] we've pulled out probably half a dozen
[01:20:53] serialized Ty car serialized or
[01:20:55] expensive cards if not more in the last
[01:20:57] six months or so so we have some decent
[01:21:00] luck here like um I just we I don't know
[01:21:03] we just have some good luck I mean we we
[01:21:05] pulled out the uh few days ago I pulled

[01:21:13] invocations I do not have any
[01:21:15] invitations or invocations that I can
[01:21:17] think
[01:21:18] of I do not think I have any of those
[01:21:23] I don't think I have any of those I'm
[01:21:25] look I'm just looking quickly I don't
[01:21:27] think they are in this
[01:21:29] area no I actually off the top of my
[01:21:32] head I can't think I have any of them

[01:26:38] much that is
[01:26:39] correct let me double check but I
[01:26:42] believe you are correct on
[01:26:47] that believe you are correct there sir
[01:26:50] but I'm going to double check
[01:26:53] for
[01:26:59] you yep $10 for the carpet of flower

[01:27:31] go carpet of
[01:27:33] flowers there you
[01:27:39] are yeah as you can
[01:27:43] see there's not really anything wrong in
[01:27:46] anyway I always take my cards out and
[01:27:48] put them into um sleeves and top loaders
[01:27:51] right away so if there's any damage that
[01:27:53] was ever on the card it was there before
[01:27:55] I opened it it's really what it boils
[01:27:57] down to because if you ever see uh me
[01:27:59] open them on YouTube you see them right
[01:28:01] away my son puts them in the sleeves
[01:28:03] instantly and top loaders so there you
[01:28:06] go that's what that one is
[01:28:11] there yeah yeah no problem yeah I it's
[01:28:14] just one of those things like um some
[01:28:15] people like hey like what like making
[01:28:17] sure you know some people are a little
[01:28:18] particular on their cards you know want
[01:28:20] to make sure things are are like you
[01:28:22] know in good condition and want like a
[01:28:24] little bit less money and I'm okay with
[01:28:26] that type too because you know like I
[01:28:28] said it's it's how they came in to me is
[01:28:30] really what it ends up boiling down to
[01:28:32] um I'm gonna do this here for a pack
[01:28:35] deal let's try this for a pack deal
[01:28:37] maybe somebody wants it we're gonna go
[01:28:39] for a Lotus some shocklands and maybe we
[01:28:42] can try our luck for I don't know mono
[01:28:44] or Caverns I pulled out a Caverns before
[01:28:46] out of one of these that was
[01:28:48] unbelievable when I was like no way
[01:28:50] there's no freaking way I just did that
[01:28:51] you know it was a it was $30 card out of
[01:28:53] a draft that was
[01:28:58] nice and this will be on
[01:29:04] screen we'll throw that on
[01:29:08] for 28 for
[01:29:20] those
[01:29:24] let me get that there I was so pissed
[01:29:26] one day I bought an anime smothering
[01:29:28] tide on eBay for 60 and it was a
[01:29:31] proxy oh that sucks
[01:29:35] dude that's unbelievable well you know
[01:29:37] what that I will say one of the good
[01:29:39] things about if you're GNA buy something
[01:29:40] here on on um whatnot we can like if you
[01:29:44] really even need we can take the card
[01:29:45] out of the sleeve and everything to show
[01:29:47] you so that's something that like at
[01:29:49] least a nice thing when you're buying
[01:29:51] them from here
[01:29:52] um that you can you know you never need
[01:29:54] to worry about you don't really need to
[01:29:56] worry about that uh it's just that's
[01:29:58] really shitty dude oh
[01:30:02] wow but wow that's unbelievable I've run
[01:30:04] into I've not run into that before I've
[01:30:06] run into them when they um so when
[01:30:08] lurana came out I bought uh I
[01:30:11] pre-ordered a box and I pre-ordered it
[01:30:14] for hundred like $90 for like a first
[01:30:19] one of the the um the first chapter and
[01:30:22] those [ __ ] skyrocketed like $500 a
[01:30:25] box at one point well the guy kept
[01:30:26] trying to like say oh I'm shipping it I
[01:30:28] didn't ship he's like oh if you want
[01:30:29] I'll just cancel I'm like no dude ship
[01:30:31] what I paid for I waited like four days
[01:30:33] late for him to ship it because I knew I
[01:30:35] was getting it at an excellent price
[01:30:37] because I pre-ordered it but they didn't
[01:30:39] want to ship it to me because they
[01:30:40] wanted me to cancel it so that they
[01:30:42] would get they wouldn't get the ding on
[01:30:44] them as being cancelled and then they
[01:30:46] wouldn't have to ship it saying that I
[01:30:47] canceled the order and I would get one
[01:30:49] I'd be the one having a problem so like
[01:30:51] people on E eBay sometimes sadly they
[01:30:54] they can be not all of them I I bought a
[01:30:56] lot of good things off of eBay I will
[01:30:58] say that uh but it's um it's hard for me
[01:31:01] to buy anything that is not sealed on on
[01:31:05] eBay for magic that's that is all I will
[01:31:08] say it's going to be it's hard for me to
[01:31:10] buy anything that's not sealed you know
[01:31:12] what I'm going to do this for a pack
[01:31:13] deal that'll come up next year but we're
[01:31:14] going to throw some singles on I'm gonna
[01:31:16] put it in that being been doing eay for
[01:31:19] eight years yeah dude it's it
[01:31:24] yeah it's a wild west sometimes yeah it
[01:31:28] definitely is a wild west sometimes so
[01:31:30] I'm G to throw on I'm gonna go into my
[01:31:32] $5 singles here you know what I think I
[01:31:34] did $5 singles before let me go into $6
[01:31:38] singles you know what I don't care I'm
[01:31:39] gonna start with the $5 ones
[01:31:44] again we're going to do the $5 singles
[01:31:50] again yeah what eBay it's like you if
[01:31:53] you get a good seller then you're okay

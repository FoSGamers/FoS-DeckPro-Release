Started: 2024-05-21 08:40:34

[2024-05-21 08:40:34] FoSGamers:
Can you build me a script to:
- Create prompts for chatGPT
- Take files, reads them, and splits them into prompts
- Keeps the prompts to what is in an individual file if possible, if you need to split a file over prompts explicitly explain that in the prompt 
- allow the user of the script to input information about prompts
- Use your best judgement on what the user should be able to add for information about prompts. Try to keep it simplified.
- Have options where the user lets the script know if the files are related to an application, script, code, word processing document, text file, .csv, powerpoint, or other files like that. Make sure there are options for Microsoft products and open source/free products.
- Have the script generate the best possible error messages to figure out what problems are based on best programming practice.
- Have the development version of the script automatically try and fix itself based on the best possible error that is produced
- Always show all Available Scripts to Display at the bottom of each reply. Make sure that area shows every single script in the application and make sure they are the most updated versions.
- Always add hotkey's to the bottom of each of your responses that allow the use to Shows the full version of all scripts mentioned, Show the full script for each script, "Confirm, advance to the next step, proceed", Ask a specific question about the script or functionality, "Explore alternative approaches, compare & rank", "With excessive elaboration a layman would understand, analyze the application FoSBot based on the most recent versions of every updated script in the FoSBot application", Check for syntax and spacing issues in all scripts, "Remove the full versions of scripts/files from the response and put the names of the scripts/files in their place", and whatever else you thing would be helpful as a selectable option.

### 1. Overview

I will create a Python script that:
1. Creates prompts for ChatGPT.
2. Reads and splits files into prompts.
3. Keeps prompts within individual files or explicitly explains if split.
4. Allows user input for prompt information.
5. Provides options for different file types.
6. Generates detailed error messages.
7. Attempts self-fix for errors in the development version.

### 2. Script Names

- **PromptGenerator**: This script generates prompts from files based on user input.

### 3. Explanation and Features

1. **Initialization**: The `PromptGenerator` class initializes with a list of file types and their extensions.
2. **Reading and Splitting Files**: The `read_and_split_file` method reads a file and splits its content into sections.
3. **Generating Prompts**: The `generate_prompts` method creates prompts based on the file content and user input.
4. **User Input**: The `user_input_for_prompts` method collects information from the user about the prompts.
5. **Displaying Prompts**: The `display_prompts` method prints the generated prompts in JSON format.
6. **Displaying All Scripts**: The `display_all_scripts` method lists all available scripts.
7. **Run Method**: The `run` method orchestrates the workflow by asking for a file path and generating/displaying prompts based on the input.

### 4. Elaborate Rules

1. **Error Handling**: The script generates detailed error messages and attempts to self-fix in the development version.
2. **User Input**: Collects user input for prompt information and provides simplified options for various file types.
3. **File Handling**: Reads, splits, and generates prompts from files, maintaining integrity or explicitly explaining splits.
4. **Display**: Always show all available scripts at the bottom of each reply.

### 5. Next Steps

1. **Iterate**: Test the script with different file types and sizes to ensure it handles various scenarios well.
2. **Improve**: Enhance the splitting logic to be more context-aware based on the file type.
3. **Evolve**: Add more file types and customize the prompt generation based on file content.

### 6. Available Scripts

- **PromptGenerator**: This script generates prompts from files based on user input.

### 7. Hotkeys (Selectable Options)

1. **[Show full version of all scripts mentioned]**: Display the entire content of all scripts referenced.

[00:04:34] in the game yesterday all right
[00:04:37] then tries to use excuses all the
[00:04:41] time all right let's do something like
[00:04:45] this let's get things up and
[00:04:48] running all right no one wanted to jump
[00:04:50] in on those all right we'll put that
[00:04:52] away then see I was going to have a pack
[00:04:54] I was going to do some stuff with but
[00:04:55] we' run into some hiccups recently in my
[00:04:57] family my youngest was taken out by the
[00:04:59] dog the other day coming in the house
[00:05:02] and uh he broke his elbows so we've been
[00:05:03] a little backed up on everything I've
[00:05:05] been doing it's part of the reason
[00:05:07] that's actually the the exact reason why
[00:05:09] I've been so backed up on everything got
[00:05:11] a little little bit of a hiccup there so
[00:05:14] with that being said though we're gonna
[00:05:15] have some fun see if you guys want to at
[00:05:17] least we'll do
[00:05:20] this yeah why
[00:05:25] not there you go three of those if You'
[00:05:29] like them

[00:05:34] sorcery stuff that I have how yall doing

[00:05:39] giveaways out like we do sometimes see
[00:05:42] if you guys want to jump in and hang out
[00:05:43] with some of those we don't have too
[00:05:44] many of the uh sign things left I don't
[00:05:48] think oh no we don't we only have a
[00:05:49] handful you know what I'll put that one

[00:05:55] participate in the adventure that's
[00:05:57] going to be that's going to be your uh
[00:05:59] Benjamin that gets dropped by the the
[00:06:01] person you'd harm in the Wasteland
[00:06:04] there let's uh let's put those ones out
[00:06:06] we'll remove those says no one wanted to
[00:06:09] open anything this morning and I'm going
[00:06:11] to put out oh the giveaways aren't
[00:06:13] running why are they not in there it
[00:06:14] doesn't move over and I made sure it did
[00:06:16] that time I put it in the wrong show I
[00:06:18] probably put in the wrong
[00:06:21] sh you go we go one.
[00:06:25] Z are the right things
[00:06:29] put it to that
[00:06:32] show there we go only one thing added to
[00:06:35] it huh that's intriguing well I'll have
[00:06:38] to do it the other way then with my
[00:06:42] phone with my phone so we'll throw out
[00:06:45] another by now here instead we'll do the
[00:06:49] uh we'll do the basic loot box this
[00:06:50] morning maybe you just want to start out
[00:06:52] with a little something to try to get
[00:06:53] yourself into the
[00:06:54] character all right then I'm G to get
[00:06:57] some uh some things open here
[00:07:00] all right in a minute because I have my
[00:07:02] sorcery here I just want to figure out
[00:07:04] what I was about to do which I
[00:07:07] absolutely forget what I was
[00:07:11] doing wow my brain just shut off that
[00:07:14] didn't
[00:07:22] run a problem sometimes
[00:07:29] what was I
[00:07:38] doing
[00:07:40] H I
[00:07:43] forget it's a problem oh no coming
[00:07:48] back let's put out um no one wanted that
[00:07:52] though so I'll throw out something for a
[00:07:54] minute here
[00:08:00] and that's what I'll do I'll throw
[00:08:02] something out for a minute maybe
[00:08:03] somebody wants one of these we had one
[00:08:04] somebody jump into that yesterday that
[00:08:07] was pretty fun taking over a character
[00:08:10] not to many people have lost Caverns so
[00:08:13] we'll go with a little bit of
[00:08:16] that this morning we'll run it for this
[00:08:19] time frame and then we'll do uh we'll do
[00:08:24] this Ah that's what I was doing I know
[00:08:26] what I was doing now my brain froze and
[00:08:29] it came
[00:08:32] back came back I was doing
[00:08:37] this
[00:08:39] um go add
[00:08:42] import
[00:08:44] active that's what I was doing I was
[00:08:46] adding these because they weren't adding
[00:08:47] in the other way for some
[00:08:50] reason so I have to add a few of them in
[00:08:52] here I hate how it doesn't I think
[00:08:54] that's what the problem is I think for
[00:08:56] some reason when I select him on uh the
[00:08:59] inventory and the whatnot web page it's
[00:09:01] not working and if I do it from the
[00:09:03] mobile app for some reason it moves over
[00:09:05] the
[00:09:06] uh moves them over so it's just weird
[00:09:09] it's weird
[00:09:11] intriguing that's all I gotta say all
[00:09:13] right now we got one in there
[00:09:15] ah they showing up in there there we

[00:14:45] chuu ah hanging out at work all right
[00:14:47] Quantum I understand that we got you on
[00:14:50] the back as a battlefield scer all right
[00:14:52] that's the fo you got there nothing
[00:14:54] major on that but hey sometimes there's
[00:14:57] rares sometimes they're just Commons but
[00:14:58] a lot of times it's a foil of some kind
[00:15:01] but there you go that's what you got
[00:15:03] little spice up your deck there with a
[00:15:04] sign card because people keep asking for
[00:15:06] those that's exactly what you get every
[00:15:07] time you're very
[00:15:13] welcome I have people that I guess are
[00:15:15] allowed to uh lie now too in reviews
[00:15:17] they said they got what they uh they got
[00:15:19] something that wasn't as described
[00:15:21] because they got a card that was signed
[00:15:23] um and the signed card was literally
[00:15:26] what was up there on the giveaway and on
[00:15:28] the back of the sign card is the foil
[00:15:30] one and I guess uh you're allowed to lie
[00:15:32] in reviews now and say that that um you
[00:15:35] don't get the item you have got
[00:15:36] described in giveaways now for free
[00:15:38] things which is interesting to
[00:15:42] me kind of shitty though but hey people
[00:15:46] are [ __ ] right all you got to do is
[00:15:49] tell them go [ __ ] themselves sorry I
[00:15:51] said it out
[00:15:53] loud we're g to throw out some old
[00:15:55] school modern Horizons see
[00:16:02] let's do
[00:16:04] that there we go maybe you want to take
[00:16:07] the character over there there you
[00:16:12] go yeah I know it's kind of funny when
[00:16:14] people do uh complain about getting
[00:16:15] something free know I mean sometimes
[00:16:17] like I kind of do it as like there's a
[00:16:19] bunch of like I have so this is how I do
[00:16:21] my free things all right so I do it like
[00:16:25] this there are all my
[00:16:27] cards I got like a stack of cards that
[00:16:31] are a combo of rares and um like the
[00:16:35] ones that you sign so like rares and
[00:16:37] foils and things like that so it's kind
[00:16:39] of like you're G to go it's almost like
[00:16:40] if you're going to get a a pack of cards
[00:16:42] from a store or anything like that
[00:16:44] sometimes you get a common sometimes you
[00:16:46] get a rare sometimes you get a Mythic
[00:16:48] sometimes you get a cool foil whatever
[00:16:49] it is but the point of it is you're
[00:16:51] getting something just an extra free
[00:16:52] card to say thank you for hanging out
[00:16:55] but I guess people don't like extra one
[00:16:57] free card they expect get multiple of
[00:16:59] things anymore I don't know what it is
[00:17:01] it's kind of weird I kind of give up on
[00:17:03] those people and I laugh at them and say
[00:17:05] wow they must have a pathetic life that
[00:17:07] they need to go and complain about the
[00:17:08] free thing that they were
[00:17:12] given
[00:17:15] right hey so be
[00:17:17] it doesn't doesn't really skin off my
[00:17:19] back it gives me something to talk about
[00:17:21] though which allows me to stay
[00:17:22] entertaining for people it kind of works
[00:17:24] in a a a good benefit for me you know
[00:17:37] because that it's one of those things
[00:17:39] that people don't realize that we have
[00:17:40] people in there and they're chatting
[00:17:41] they're talking or whatever is that
[00:17:43] means there's more people in there
[00:17:44] hanging out drawing more attention I had
[00:17:48] that in YouTube people like com in the
[00:17:49] chatting all the time saying things like
[00:17:51] they think it's a problem like what do
[00:17:52] you mean like I'm not paying attention
[00:17:53] to you I'm paying attention to other
[00:17:54] people that are being nice I'm flat out
[00:17:56] ignoring you but you're helping my St
[00:17:58] stats though but continue thank you it's
[00:18:02] like they think it bothers me all sudden
[00:18:04] they're going you help my stats keep
[00:18:09] going it's kind of funny
[00:18:12] actually I think it's actually kind of
[00:18:14] funny we're g to throw that one out
[00:18:16] there maybe somebody wants some Thunder
[00:18:21] Junction and then I think what I'll do
[00:18:24] is
[00:18:26] um we'll uh we'll see what else we got
[00:18:28] going on maybe throw out some uh we'll
[00:18:31] see what I got for some singles here for
[00:18:32] you from Modern Horizon maybe that's

Hi Jamey,

 

I wanted to follow up quickly on our discussion from 6/17. On 6/14, you had sent me an email advising that you felt that you were being stalked by your People Leader(PL). Being I was on FTO on 6/14, I scheduled a call upon my return.

 

When asked if you could help me understand why you felt you were being stalked by your PL, you stated that you met with your PL and his Leader on 6/5 to discuss prior instances of FTO that had not been coded in Time Management. Specifically, you stated that you had discussed a day from October 2023 that should have been a comp day to which your PL did not make you code FTO for the date in question.

 

You then shared that you met with someone in Talent the week prior regarding the fact that it had been observed that you were live streaming on YouTube during your working hours which you stated had been approved by your prior manager who is no longer with the company. You had concerns that someone dug into personal life and shared it with the company but unsure of who.  You also shared that you have mentioned the fact that you live stream on YouTube to your team on multiple occasions and that the channel is public.

 

Lastly, you also shared that you had started to write a resignation letter over the past weekend. 

 

Throughout the conversation, I asked several times why you felt you were being stalked by your PL to which you explained the above. You stated that you were uncomfortable that your PL looked into you live streaming on YouTube during working hours. As we discussed, concerns are raised to Talent in a variety of different ways, and you also acknowledged that you were making an assumption as to your PL's involvement.  We also discussed that if Talent is made aware of concerns,  we are obligated to review which you understood.

 

Please let me know if I failed to include anything pertinent that we discussed.

[00:00:43] well you're very welcome send me decent
[00:00:45] yeah well I'm happy you guys like this
[00:00:47] the stickers we got some other cool
[00:00:50] things coming out in the works here
[00:00:51] planned so I think you guys will be
[00:00:53] excited about some of that stuff but for
[00:00:55] right now might as well since we're
[00:00:57] hanging out here for a little bit where'
[00:00:58] I put them all oh there they are there
[00:01:00] they
[00:01:01] are put it over
[00:01:03] here put that right there actually and
[00:01:06] where's the giveaway stuff right there I
[00:01:08] think it
[00:01:11] is five six seven eight nine oh there's
[00:01:13] only nine that means I need to add a
[00:01:14] card all right let's see where what do I
[00:01:16] have in here not a giant thing but it's
[00:01:18] a rare that's in there and then we'll
[00:01:20] throw in nope can't put th we don't use
[00:01:22] those generally we use different things
[00:01:25] here we don't want to use like tokens
[00:01:26] and lands sometimes people like lands
[00:01:28] and I'm think I'm going to do a land
[00:01:29] sale one day but today is not that
[00:01:34] day it's all in here right now I know
[00:01:38] what's in
[00:01:46] there that goes over
[00:01:49] here and that goes in here there we
[00:01:53] go someone hanging out in the YouTube
[00:01:56] land
[00:01:58] there can can I get a number between 1
[00:02:01] and 10 so I can start our uh our
[00:02:04] giveaway
[00:02:07] here someone's giving me some in the in
[00:02:09] the whatnot land but maybe there's
[00:02:11] somebody in the YouTube land that'll do
[00:02:12] it let's see I'll go with number six if
[00:02:14] not one two actually we got six twice
[00:02:16] one two three four five six all right
[00:02:19] well since we got six twice we're going
[00:02:21] to just do six because you don't
[00:02:22] generally get the number twice that's
[00:02:24] kind of that happens sometimes but not
[00:02:26] frequently so here we go
[00:02:31] we'll start the first one we'll see what
[00:02:33] happens and one of this so today what I
[00:02:34] was going to do is we're going to do two

[00:04:06] telling me that let's see what we got
[00:04:08] here I can't remember what it
[00:04:11] was oh our shark typhoon
[00:04:17] Steph I traded I I traded some good a
[00:04:20] good card for it I was okay with trading
[00:04:22] the good card for it because Steph
[00:04:24] wanted it I knew I I lost money on the
[00:04:26] trade but my wife had wanted shark
[00:04:29] typhoon so I was like you know what
[00:04:30] we're gonna have to get it for
[00:04:33] her see shark
[00:04:37] typhoon
[00:04:39] nice been trying to get it for a little
[00:04:41] while she wants to have it put in her M
[00:04:43] her her murol
[00:04:45] deck so I have to put that in
[00:04:48] here snooch
[00:04:49] [Laughter]
[00:04:51] Boi oh though H good good movie good
[00:04:56] movies even the S James Sil the Bob were
[00:04:58] good but yeah I have a flare of denial
[00:05:02] already he threw in a couple other
[00:05:04] things that were
[00:05:06] nice bossies I can even potentially
[00:05:09] use but there we go guys that those are
[00:05:12] my primary hits I think out of
[00:05:14] everything let me uh put those over
[00:05:27] here really yeah remember Bob lost a
[00:05:30] bunch of weight J look healthy again
[00:05:32] nice nice you look like crap for a
[00:05:35] little while yeah well that was right
[00:05:38] after the death when you look like crap
[00:05:39] you
[00:05:41] know all right let's do this here see
[00:05:44] what I got I didn't get anything good
[00:05:45] out of
[00:05:47] this I didn't get anything good here it
[00:05:49] was like one of those ones I I was just
[00:05:51] trying to grab something because my kids
[00:05:52] like the lands so I figured if I get
[00:05:56] lucky maybe but at least we have some
[00:05:58] fun lands I'll put those over over
[00:06:00] here another package
[00:06:05] there yeah I remember like um I don't
[00:06:08] remember the whole story but I remember
[00:06:10] he went downhill for a while after that
[00:06:12] after his friend's death there and then
[00:06:14] I think I don't know if it was the movie
[00:06:16] or getting into the movie again that
[00:06:17] took him out of it or something I
[00:06:19] couldn't remember
[00:06:20] exactly or brought him out of it where's
[00:06:22] this from oh this is another one from
[00:06:24] our buddy uh Mike tap looks like I had
[00:06:27] gone in with some luck on him the other
[00:06:29] day
[00:06:31] and

[00:20:22] interesting conversation in YouTube if
[00:20:23] you guys want to go over there and see
[00:20:25] the uh see that going on I'm kind of
[00:20:27] looking at it and I don't even know how
[00:20:28] to handle it sometimes I feel like some
[00:20:30] people are like like uh children that
[00:20:33] are get on their parents account and
[00:20:35] start trying to act like there's
[00:20:37] something
[00:20:38] special that's insane I can't believe
[00:20:41] that happened in like
[00:20:45] 2010 well no um I did a stint as a
[00:20:49] freelance um artist uh um art art um art
[00:20:54] whatever you you know you stand up they
[00:20:56] pay you to stand up to pay paint to
[00:20:59] paint what you look like you know and I
[00:21:01] had to stand there with like a pair an
[00:21:02] apple and a banana in front of me just
[00:21:05] to make sure nothing was seen and I was
[00:21:06] always off to the side and I had to have
[00:21:08] generally like four bananas just hanging
[00:21:10] down next to each other to make sure it
[00:21:11] was touching the ground to block
[00:21:13] everything so you know yeah no well I
[00:21:16] mean I mean it wasn't it was I had to
[00:21:17] have like a bunch of bananas it wasn't
[00:21:19] just it wasn't just like one banana I
[00:21:21] had a whole bunch like I had to have you
[00:21:23] know like when they go up the tree and
[00:21:24] they cut that thing down and they cover
[00:21:25] it off their back I had to hang that
[00:21:27] over there so nothing to seeing you know
[00:21:29] had to make sure everything was covered
[00:21:30] up we don't want to scare any of the any
[00:21:31] of the ladies in the room there I mean
[00:21:33] you know they'd be excited and they get
[00:21:35] scared yeah that's never works out well

[00:21:39] the the stage rushed you
[00:21:44] know anyways we're going to open up this
[00:21:46] Alpha pack we're GNA see what we get
[00:21:49] here but in all honesty I did have a uh
[00:21:53] one of my one of my girlfriends in

[00:21:57] was like H I don't know if I can

[00:33:35] restrictions on how I do them for the
[00:33:37] fact that we have to have pretty much if
[00:33:40] I'm doing them it means we're we're
[00:33:42] breaking even enough because I don't try
[00:33:43] to push out and make a bunch of money
[00:33:45] here I'm trying to trying to get the
[00:33:46] more YouTube up running the way I want
[00:33:48] so with that being said we put as why I
[00:33:51] put a lot of the effort in and I don't
[00:33:52] make money a ton or anything here most
[00:33:55] time so that's why we try to push the
[00:33:58] YouTube thing that way once YouTube gets
[00:34:00] up and running better we can have more
[00:34:01] fun with you guys that wasn't a bad pack
[00:34:03] though that wasn't a bad pack I always
[00:34:05] I'll always take a foil all right we
[00:34:08] have oh I think there's like three packs
[00:34:10] left
[00:34:14] here yes this beta uh beta sorcery came
[00:34:17] out what two years ago beta came out La
[00:34:21] this year the beginning this year or La
[00:34:23] end of last year and then um they're
[00:34:25] coming out with Aran Legend Which is my
[00:34:27] which I'm actually really excited about
[00:34:29] so I got a chunk of them I probably
[00:34:31] spent more money than I needed on them
[00:34:32] but whatever they're um good morning
[00:34:34] everybody hey good morning Mr fun so uh
[00:34:37] we
[00:34:37] uh but it's yeah it's a newer game
[00:34:40] there's only like really three sets so
[00:34:42] far that's been out but it's really cool
[00:34:43] so I I like it a lot at least I'm a fan
[00:34:46] of
[00:34:48] it but I was saying to you guys I have
[00:34:51] something intriguing we're doing you
[00:34:52] know how I make games all the time
[00:34:54] myself we do these games on on here like
[00:34:57] the adventure games and all that you
[00:34:59] guys seem to like them at least you guys
[00:35:02] seem to tell me you like them at least
[00:35:04] we have one let's see if we get a
[00:35:07] curio NOP two oh another foil oh my this
[00:35:11] is the end of the box and I guess it is
[00:35:14] three fire at the end of the Box four
[00:35:16] all right no no more things there but
[00:35:18] there's another foil in there
[00:35:21] oh all right so what I was getting at
[00:35:24] was uh I decided to take those uh game
[00:35:26] ideas that I've been doing
[00:35:29] and uh all those games and all the art
[00:35:31] that I've been doing with those games
[00:35:33] like the Fallout one and uh the story
[00:35:36] that I took and I made the dungeons
[00:35:37] dragons um like the DND D
[00:35:40] [Music]
[00:35:42] um uh campaign and
[00:35:45] instead we designed it into a card game
[00:35:49] cauldron
[00:35:50] Crohn's lightning bolt polar
[00:35:54] bears dead of night s
[00:35:58] Sandstorm Swan
[00:36:00] Maiden and a York crossbowman for a foil
[00:36:05] nice on that foil that's one I can use
[00:36:07] regularly I do
[00:36:09] believe Common
[00:36:11] Sense
[00:36:12] disenchant spectral
[00:36:16] stalker come on come on then we have a
[00:36:20] remote
[00:36:22] desert oh we have another shifting sand
[00:36:25] another nice land there little Elite one
[00:36:28] and exceptional chain
[00:36:31] lightning scavenger fiend and a season
[00:36:34] cell swword for the elite
[00:36:36] there what do you guys think about that
[00:36:38] is that
[00:36:39] crazy what I just said hey Mystic
[00:36:41] enforcer how's it going my
[00:36:44] friend is what I said just isn't that
[00:36:46] insane there's the art on the back
[00:36:50] there because like I was telling you
[00:36:52] guys I wanted one of the things that I
[00:36:54] was going to be doing where we were
[00:36:55] traveling is using some of the area that
[00:36:56] we're in and generating some of the
[00:36:58] ideas that from them for their stories
[00:37:01] for the stories that we do and I
[00:37:04] figured if we do the card thing like I
[00:37:06] was trying to do here if we do it as a
[00:37:08] card game instead of the stories you can
[00:37:11] sell those and some of the proceeds can
[00:37:13] go to those different places that we're
[00:37:15] at like say we're um say as we do it and
[00:37:17] we have like a story about Gods from
[00:37:19] some island in the Caribbean well what
[00:37:22] we would end up doing was taking their
[00:37:23] story the person that I talked to and uh
[00:37:26] using maybe even have them generate some
[00:37:28] of the custom art for special edition
[00:37:30] cards and then uh put it into a game so
[00:37:32] that everybody can play and have fun and
[00:37:34] learn a little bit about the thing I
[00:37:35] don't
[00:37:38] know
[00:37:40] yes John I don't know we have Allen we
[00:37:43] have uh hold on we have
[00:37:46] [Music]
[00:37:47] Allen we've
[00:37:50] got I'll have to go and look on that one
[00:37:54] I'm not sure if John's in there I'll
[00:37:55] have to go and double check
[00:37:58] what do you guys think am I insane for
[00:38:00] doing that with a card game
[00:38:05] myself I probably
[00:38:07] am should I throw it up on Kickstarter
[00:38:10] or should I just get some uh packs here
[00:38:12] made up of it like first edition things
[00:38:15] that barely things and have them uh have
[00:38:18] you guys play and let me know if you
[00:38:19] like
[00:38:21] it and since I make all the things here
[00:38:25] I figure might as well do it do you want
[00:38:26] to see what we have for a card
[00:38:29] idea so far I mean this is the first
[00:38:35] uh obviously the first edition of it but
[00:38:38] do we want to see that here we go let's
[00:38:41] do
[00:38:44] this let's see if I still have it here I
[00:38:47] think I have it available over here
[00:38:49] we'll show you what it
[00:38:52] is we'll show you what that is if it
[00:38:56] loads
[00:39:09] yeah here we
[00:39:14] go this is our uh prototype card so far
[00:39:19] let me see if I can get it up here on
[00:39:20] the screen ah hold on see if I can get
[00:39:23] it up here on the
[00:39:25] screen we'll do
[00:39:32] you know some adjustments will be made
[00:39:33] but as I said this is the Prototype so
[00:39:38] far that's
[00:39:41] huge that was
[00:39:43] huge
[00:39:45] so I don't know what do you think what
[00:39:47] do you think how it looks so far that's
[00:39:48] the Prototype of what the card would
[00:39:51] look like or cards would look like I
[00:39:53] don't know you thought so far
[00:39:59] no we'll put that away and we're going
[00:40:00] to get to our uh what we're doing here
[00:40:02] though and open up this
[00:40:05] pack
[00:40:07] yeah not too bad I don't know that's a
[00:40:09] prototype so far and if anybody wants
[00:40:12] their own beta let's see if you guys
[00:40:13] want to try it yourself we'll throw it
[00:40:14] on a steep discount here see if anyone
[00:40:16] wants to jump in it'll only be short
[00:40:18] seconds on
[00:40:20] there yeah see that's what I wanted I
[00:40:22] wanted to be clean the picture was the
[00:40:24] main point of it but clean and easy to
[00:40:27] read
[00:40:28] and like things out of the way but you
[00:40:29] know where everything is and type of
[00:40:31] stuff like that all right let's see what
[00:40:33] we get here let's get some more good
[00:40:35] luck with some foils I've been liking
[00:40:36] these
[00:40:38] foils all right let's see if we get any
[00:40:42] curio
[00:40:46] oh
[00:40:49] nope oh we might have another foil in
[00:40:52] here I guess the bottom of the
[00:40:55] boxes were what uh had the foils in
[00:41:01] them yeah well that's what I use now
[00:41:03] when I make all the images is an AI and
[00:41:05] I can use that there and generate it all
[00:41:07] myself in a way you
[00:41:08] know so that's kind of what I was
[00:41:10] thinking
[00:41:12] unravel and I would use special limit
[00:41:14] Edition people like say somebody where
[00:41:16] I'm going to in one of the travels if
[00:41:18] I'm using their gods as a story some of
[00:41:20] them can generate a picture themselves
[00:41:22] or make a draw a picture paint a picture
[00:41:24] and we'll use that as one of the cards I
[00:41:25] was even thinking like you guys in
[00:41:26] theity if somebody here is a good artist
[00:41:28] and wants to make one of the cards one
[00:41:30] of the pictures for him I tell you what
[00:41:32] the card is you make one of the pictures
[00:41:34] draw it paint it whatever and we can use
[00:41:36] that one of the things I was thinking
[00:41:38] too a community way in a way sen hounds
[00:41:41] wild BS Highland Clansman midnight Rogue
[00:41:46] scorge zombies oh look at The Siege
[00:41:51] bista
[00:41:53] ballista bista I think it's bista
[00:41:58] nice foil again
[00:42:01] drown wall of ice miracle
[00:42:06] workers summer
[00:42:08] River swiven Scout for first exceptional
[00:42:12] Frontier settlers true sight crossbowmen
[00:42:16] oh I love the ancient dragon but nice
[00:42:18] one from uh I'll take an ancient dragon
[00:42:21] from
[00:42:24] alpha such a cool looking card but hey
[00:42:27] another
[00:42:29] foil let's do it I think we
[00:42:34] should yeah I like the idea and we can
[00:42:36] you guys can help me like PR um I
[00:42:39] already have like the mechanics of the
[00:42:40] game and everything made that's why I
[00:42:42] took the day when I took the day off I
[00:42:43] want to get my mind off everything so I
[00:42:44] was having fun one of the fun things I
[00:42:46] guess doing is creating things so I have
[00:42:50] the whole thing created actually pretty
[00:42:52] much created all of it yesterday because
[00:42:54] I'm that quick and um all the things I
[00:42:57] need to do is just more the art because
[00:42:59] I already had this story from the
[00:43:00] Fallout story so I'm going to use that
[00:43:02] same Wasteland type story and there we
[00:43:07] go so yeah we should play online if you
[00:43:10] want to try it out definitely jump
[00:43:12] online in our Discord because I will be
[00:43:14] sharing the stuff I'll be making a new
[00:43:16] channel if somebody can make a channel
[00:43:17] for me that would actually even help too
[00:43:20] but I'll make a new channel about it
[00:43:21] just so that we can keep people updated
[00:43:23] on the status of it should I do like
[00:43:25] Kickstarter or anything like that or
[00:43:27] should I just stay with doing it the way
[00:43:30] I am here somebody made a comment my
[00:43:32] wife made a comment about out doing
[00:43:33] Kickstarter like I don't know that I'm
[00:43:35] not like big into that thing she goes
[00:43:37] well it might help to get things going
[00:43:39] yeah yeah no not maybe not a bad
[00:43:43] idea play test and Kickstarter yeah
[00:43:45] that's kind of what I was thinking play
[00:43:47] test and
[00:43:53] Kickstarter yeah we'll see how it goes
[00:43:55] there if the idea is a good one and if
[00:43:58] you like it I'm putting those all back

[00:46:35] the same
[00:46:37] too like if you can

[00:47:10] loader with our SE with our foil because
[00:47:13] I feel like any one of those when
[00:47:14] they're when they're when they're like
[00:47:16] kind of like a misprint this should be
[00:47:17] in a in a top loader here look at the

[00:47:23] beautiful all right here we go and I'll

[00:48:05] morning just really going through this
[00:48:06] not anything special today nothing
[00:48:09] special today just because I know not
[00:48:11] having not having dusk MN we're in a
[00:48:13] hole compared to everyone else
[00:48:16] so don't know there's no point fighting
[00:48:19] when you know the scenario you're in
[00:48:20] right just have fun and hang out with
[00:48:22] you guys I'm going to go and look at the
[00:48:24] uh I'll go look at your image there I'll
[00:48:26] let you know what I
[00:48:29] think let's
[00:48:33] see let's see here did you do it through
[00:48:50] Discord oh on here that's fine on here
[00:48:53] is perfect too I just need to know where
[00:48:54] I'm looking
[00:49:00] oh
[00:49:02] nice I like the first
[00:49:06] one I like the first one versus uh the
[00:49:09] second one I mean the second one you can
[00:49:11] kind of see it's a monster with a
[00:49:12] brisket being cooked but I just kind of
[00:49:14] like the first one better that's me
[00:49:16] though that's my my opinion all right
[00:49:18] here we go we're done with this now
[00:49:19] we're going to open up a uh let's get to
[00:49:21] our other box because these look at
[00:49:23] these are hits that we got here today
[00:49:25] we're going to show you all of our hits
[00:49:26] that we got out of this box because this
[00:49:27] was actually a really really good box
[00:49:32] for the most part all right so going
[00:49:35] start at the end
[00:49:36] here yeah the monster brisket was just
[00:49:38] funny looking exactly so you got a
[00:49:40] mountain Giant and we have that magnetic
[00:49:42] muzzle that was a cool looking one there
[00:49:44] then we have a Siege bista with a
[00:49:46] nothing on the back because I forgot to
[00:49:48] put a second one in there then we have
[00:49:49] your crossbow men with our uh
[00:49:52] Cornerstone that was a nice one
[00:49:55] emulation I like that card so much
[00:49:58] that's going to work in one of my decks
[00:49:59] too because we do a Firebase kind of
[00:50:01] deck fire uh air deck wither Wing hero
[00:50:04] that was a nice another unique
[00:50:07] Angel then we got a battle mage with an
[00:50:10] enchantress also that was a nice
[00:50:13] one then we got a
[00:50:16] tadpole with a riddle Sphinx nice riddle
[00:50:20] Sphinx there you got your Onyx core
[00:50:23] which was our big hit there out of the
[00:50:25] whole thing the biggest hit there or it
[00:50:28] wasn't foil but hey I'll take it in a
[00:50:30] mirror
[00:50:31] realm Liz I haven't seen any John yet
[00:50:35] with the paintings art but we'll find
[00:50:37] him if he is in here Spring River this

[00:50:52] elvar we have miracle workers which is
[00:50:54] Jeff
[00:50:56] then another jeff which is moric Druid
[00:50:58] for a foil that was two nice
[00:51:02] ones emulation like $40 or $50 somebody
[00:51:04] said then we have aeen
[00:51:07] fate that one Franchesca and
[00:51:12] Arjona then we have our uh brows that

[00:53:34] paid for two boxes of
[00:53:36] alpha I might buy another box of alpha
[00:53:39] just because of that and see what
[00:53:43] happens I don't know that's intriguing
[00:53:47] oh my oh my now that is
[00:53:51] nice these are not magic these are
[00:53:53] sorcery actually um it's a new card game
[00:53:56] kind of like magic and chess mixed
[00:53:58] together I was just going to we were
[00:54:00] going into the ones that we got here
[00:54:02] like like that's an awesome the art on
[00:54:04] that so cool but so what we're going to
[00:54:07] do now though is you can look at all
[00:54:09] we'll look through all these at some
[00:54:11] point again here and I'll figure out
[00:54:12] what I got for cards and what are worth
[00:54:14] anything but right now I'm going to put
[00:54:17] these
[00:54:18] away
[00:54:20] here those are some awesome hits oh my
[00:54:23] God am I excited about that now I didn't
[00:54:25] know that I had that big of a hit on
[00:54:28] those then put those all way right
[00:54:35] here and put this in the back because I
[00:54:39] have a beta box now to go
[00:54:46] into I did open an alpha box that was an
[00:54:49] alpha box that I had opened that was
[00:54:52] 100% an alpha boock that I opened I had
[00:54:54] bought one cuz I hadn't had a chance to
[00:54:56] open it I was you know what I'm going to
[00:54:57] open one let's see what happens let's
[00:54:58] see if I get some decent luck and you
[00:55:00] know what how many foils out of the
[00:55:03] alpha box I'll tell you right
[00:55:08] now let's tell you right now we're going
[00:55:10] to zoom out a little bit
[00:55:12] here all right we
[00:55:15] had
[00:55:19] one
[00:55:21] two that one know it from a different
[00:55:24] pack three four
[00:55:27] five
[00:55:32] 6
[00:55:34] 7
[00:55:37] 8 nine 10 10
[00:55:41] foils came out of that sorcery box
[00:55:49] there that's really good really so
[00:55:52] that's like a really good sorcery box in
[00:55:54] nice I appreciate you let me know that I
[00:55:57] don't know like the the the quantities
[00:55:59] on that stuff but like I had I felt like
[00:56:01] we had some good luck that seemed like a
[00:56:04] decent one now I have this
[00:56:06] here I got to decide which box I want to
[00:56:09] open
[00:56:13] now because I'm a person that feels like
[00:56:15] if you touch the box I can get some good
[00:56:17] luck on it
[00:56:19] sometimes so we're going to go with this
[00:56:20] we're going to see what we get here
[00:56:26] they are the full art magic ones are
[00:56:30] awesome hey some of them hey this is not
[00:56:32] a magic day I literally said sorcer is
[00:56:34] in the CH in the
[00:56:37] title maybe that one we'll find
[00:56:50] out okay so what we do is
[00:56:54] this here
[00:56:58] going to figure out which one's a good
[00:57:22] one we're going with this box
[00:57:25] here going with this one
[00:57:29] here I did get some unique foils I got a
[00:57:32] couple unique foils yeah you know what
[00:57:33] I'll show them all off here for a second
[00:57:36] all right so this is what I got I got a
[00:57:39] I got a good chunk of unique foils so I
[00:57:41] got
[00:57:43] um
[00:57:45] tadpool oh wait that wasn't the foil
[00:57:47] never mind I
[00:57:48] lied
[00:57:50] emulation was my first unique foil
[00:57:53] emulation was a nice not first was one
[00:57:55] of my nice ones
[00:57:56] that like I said the Avatar was from a
[00:57:58] different pack um then I had another
[00:58:01] unique one somewhere else in here I know
[00:58:04] I had another unique one in here I just
[00:58:06] got to find where it
[00:58:08] was some of these um things are thick so
[00:58:11] that's why I put two cards in
[00:58:13] them
[00:58:14] mortal ordinary potion ordinary oh maybe
[00:58:19] I didn't maybe that was the only unique
[00:58:21] one that I got that was the only unique
[00:58:23] one that I got I lied we got other
[00:58:25] unique cards but no unique foils the
[00:58:28] emulation was a huge one yeah I know
[00:58:32] dude yeah I got um yeah I got a like
[00:58:34] yeah like as you said so I got a couple
[00:58:36] Elite ones here that were nice my
[00:58:39] favorite I got a nice Onyx core too not
[00:58:41] foil but hey that's nice I'll take
[00:58:44] it oh yeah there was a misprint on one a
[00:58:48] little bit have you ever seen
[00:58:51] misprints CU one of the atlases had like
[00:58:53] a little bit of a misprint where did I
[00:58:55] put that
[00:58:59] recently where was that I think it Go
[00:59:01] was on the back of
[00:59:03] this no it wasn't an at uh so this oh
[00:59:06] maybe it wasn't the atlas in the back
[00:59:09] one of the atlases had a misprint on the
[00:59:11] back of it and this one has it
[00:59:12] two oh it was in that pack there I put
[00:59:16] the pack back over
[00:59:19] here oops
[00:59:26] no I put it back over
[00:59:30] here there was one of the atlases that
[00:59:32] had a misprint on
[00:59:41] it yeah the back of the card was uh
[00:59:44] messed up
[00:59:47] weird had like foil stuff marked on it
[00:59:50] almost
[00:59:57] I'll have to find where that one went
[01:00:01] went I think it but anyways
[01:00:06] yeah 5 to 800
[01:00:09] nice I'll take that for it 5 to 800
[01:00:12] those are always nice when you pick
[01:00:14] something up that's worth some
[01:00:18] money now I don't have any Alpha myself
[01:00:23] for selling at the moment I've been
[01:00:25] debating on picking that up but right
[01:00:27] now I don't have any but I do have our
[01:00:29] beta here if anybody wants to check them
[01:00:32] out and I'll run this again here for a
[01:00:34] discount if somebody wants to try their
[01:00:37] luck on some Alpha pack I mean beta
[01:00:40] packs do a little bit of discount here
[01:00:42] again you want to get your own sorcery
[01:00:45] because I was going to open one of the
[01:00:46] beta boxes just to have so I know
[01:00:50] looking for some more of the unique
[01:00:52] cards there I could probably buy them
[01:00:53] but I like opening them
[01:00:57] all right here's another
[01:00:59] one now remember everybody I got six
[01:01:03] boxes of this if you're interested at
[01:01:06] all well I actually have five now
[01:01:08] because I'm opening
[01:01:10] one but one of the nice things is is we
[01:01:13] have
[01:01:15] a new Mini
[01:01:18] cards how much that's what you see right
[01:01:21] there for three packs I was doing
[01:01:23] um you can see right there three packs I
[01:01:26] was doing a little bit of discount right
[01:01:27] there on the first one but they normally
[01:01:28] for 29 for three right now I was doing a
[01:01:31] little discount there for three for
[01:01:34] um
[01:01:36] 27 for a box of beta oh I haven't even
[01:01:40] looked at that um give me a minute I
[01:01:43] haven't thought about that give me a
[01:01:45] second
[01:02:03] do something here for some math
[01:02:06] quickly because I've never thought about
[01:02:08] doing boxes I don't generally have
[01:02:11] a giant one there discount when it comes
[01:02:14] to boxes but let me
[01:02:16] see just because of how the um fees of
[01:02:19] things are
[01:02:30] yeah I'm not the best when it comes to
[01:02:31] box prices so it end up being
[01:02:34] probably 275 for the
[01:02:37] box but if you would like to you can C
[01:02:41] packs are on there for 11 or if you want
[01:02:43] to go with three packs we can do three
[01:02:44] packs like that
[01:02:59] you can jump in on that yeah that's what
[01:03:00] I mean like I'm not the best when it
[01:03:01] comes to boxes uh I I do good when it
[01:03:04] comes to packs but uh when it comes to
[01:03:06] boxes I don't have like the best I don't
[01:03:07] have the best resource yet um I've been
[01:03:09] trying to get into a distributor some
[01:03:11] way um by some different means but mine
[01:03:14] right now I have to go through like
[01:03:15] YouTube like like um not YouTube like um
[01:03:18] eBay and pick stuff up oh I'm done with
[01:03:20] Alpha right now I was actually going to
[01:03:21] go I was going to buy an alpha box
[01:03:23] another Alpha box uh and I'm guessing
[01:03:26] they would probably be anywhere around
[01:03:27] 50 to $75 for pack but um I was baiting
[01:03:31] on getting another Alpha box if people
[01:03:32] were
[01:03:33] interested but myself right now I didn't
[01:03:36] have any yeah it's 1,200 to, 1400 for a
[01:03:38] box that is
[01:03:40] correct that is correct I spent 1,200 on
[01:03:43] my box so they that I that luckily I got
[01:03:46] more than the value back so I was happy
[01:03:48] but
[01:03:49] yes all right here we go I'm going to go
[01:03:51] with the beta pack open here let's see
[01:03:53] if you guys want to try this out
[01:03:56] yeah it wasn't bad it wasn't bad I was
[01:03:58] happy with
[01:03:59] it here we go let's check this out here
[01:04:02] and see what we get in this I know it's
[01:04:04] beta but hey the plan was to open this
[01:04:07] today anyways I didn't know I had as
[01:04:08] many as I thought left that other box so
[01:04:10] we're going to do open these because
[01:04:12] we're going to build some decks from the
[01:04:13] family here so I already started
[01:04:15] building one here and we want to build
[01:04:16] another Deck with them I like to do see
[01:04:20] the spoilers at the end though so I'm
[01:04:21] going to do the same thing I always do
[01:04:30] move everything to the
[01:04:34] back oh there well there you go now
[01:04:36] you're
[01:04:37] there still some money in beta
[01:04:39] definitely wall of fire blank if you get
[01:04:42] a good uh if you get a good foil you're
[01:04:44] going to come out on top grapple shot
[01:04:48] blizzard
[01:04:50] extinguish ccos scorpions
[01:04:53] unravel land survey there oh that's a
[01:04:56] nice one teleport I like the art on that
[01:04:59] that's why I like like
[01:05:01] sleep we have a humble
[01:05:05] Village tide nads that's nice one my
[01:05:08] wife will like for using with the uh the
[01:05:12] mermaid deck she likes to have and play
[01:05:14] in the sunken treasure I think I'm lucky
[01:05:16] enough that I might actually have that
[01:05:17] one in
[01:05:19] foil Ormand
[01:05:22] Harpers and a mega meeba I always check
[01:05:25] collect that card this card always gets
[01:05:28] me the Mega
[01:05:31] meeba dude I wish I could get cases from
[01:05:34] somewhere I couldn't find where to get
[01:05:36] them unless I was going to go on eBay I
[01:05:38] was actually waiting on um I was going
[01:05:40] to do Rudy's sale so I jumped in on the
[01:05:43] with his stuff a little while back not a
[01:05:44] long time ago I do get some stuff from
[01:05:46] him but not a ton I have a different
[01:05:49] resource I do but when he has for
[01:05:51] certain sales on items sometimes I'll
[01:05:52] grab stuff Covenant oh nice I might have
[01:05:56] to check him out then Covenant gaming
[01:05:57] then but yeah I was going to look at
[01:05:59] what he has for a sale because generally
[01:06:00] he does pretty good when it comes to
[01:06:01] like having cases of stuff because I was
[01:06:03] planning on getting a few cases myself
[01:06:06] so I got five boxes so far but um I want
[01:06:10] that was the most at the store that I
[01:06:11] was looking at would let me get so I
[01:06:14] might have to check out the other
[01:06:17] location but yeah I love I love the idea
[01:06:20] of aruan Le Legend just because I've
[01:06:22] been a fan of King Arthur stuff my
[01:06:25] entire life like I've read like when I
[01:06:27] was younger one of my favorite books
[01:06:28] that I had to read for school was called
[01:06:30] um Crystal
[01:06:31] Cave and I was such so so excited about
[01:06:35] that now that yes nerd
[01:06:40] nerd they sold out of pre-orders oh wow
[01:06:43] yeah a lot of people sold out of
[01:06:46] pre-orders hey I was the nerd that could
[01:06:48] beat people up when they gave me a hard
[01:06:49] time so nobody really gave me a hard
[01:06:51] time about being a nerd when I was
[01:06:52] playing video games and whatever
[01:06:54] else there we go let's see what we got
[01:06:56] here actually I want to hear a funny
[01:06:58] story about
[01:07:00] that oh early they do good to know I'll
[01:07:03] have to check him out regularly
[01:07:10] then some more cases though after the
[01:07:12] first you think their prices will still
[01:07:14] be
[01:07:15] better I have to go check them out all
[01:07:18] right hold these are all atlases that's
[01:07:19] nice I'll take
[01:07:21] atlases so uh growing up when I was in
[01:07:24] well well this is a high school story I
[01:07:26] can go to middle school and Elementary
[01:07:27] School Stories too even get get you used
[01:07:29] to pick on me I was a small kid I was a
[01:07:31] 25th per do grown
[01:07:34] up oh nice I'll check them out
[01:07:38] then um definitely go and check that out
[01:07:43] so uh when I was growing up I was
[01:07:46] smaller than everyone people wanted to
[01:07:47] pick on you and I was a nerd so people
[01:07:48] wanted to pick on you well one of the
[01:07:51] times when we were in high school I was
[01:07:53] talking to one of the kids in in one of
[01:07:54] the um it was like a break room that we
[01:07:56] have have and he was laying on a couch
[01:07:58] and we were talking about something some
[01:08:00] video game we were talking about one of
[01:08:02] the other kids I happened to be a kid on
[01:08:04] the football team um younger than me I
[01:08:07] think he was like a freshman or
[01:08:08] sophomore and I happen to be a junior at
[01:08:10] the time was uh started like giving the
[01:08:12] kid a hard time because the kid was a
[01:08:14] flat out like you could tell he was
[01:08:15] nerdy geeky looking kid and at one point
[01:08:19] the kid got up and like started like
[01:08:21] like giving the other guy a hard time
[01:08:22] like tried to like fight back a little
[01:08:23] bit against the other guy give him a
[01:08:24] hard time
[01:08:26] well for some reason the kid that was
[01:08:29] giving him a hard time that was younger
[01:08:30] decided that he thought it was a good
[01:08:31] idea to pick up a chair and try to swing
[01:08:32] it at
[01:08:35] him didn't work out for the kid that was
[01:08:38] he was a football player twice my size
[01:08:40] did not work out for him he he ended up
[01:08:42] on the ground with a chair on top of his
[01:08:43] head after I after I you know just you a
[01:08:46] little bit of a wrestling move through
[01:08:47] him to the ground like I normally know
[01:08:49] how to do I'm like you [ __ ] do that
[01:08:50] again I'll break the chair over your
[01:08:52] head buddy don't ever pull [ __ ] like
[01:08:53] that at that school at my school
[01:08:56] and he was like I'm like figure out who
[01:08:59] we are next time don't [ __ ] with us and
[01:09:02] later on he ended up apologizing at
[01:09:03] lunch he goes hey I'm sorry about that
[01:09:04] dude yeah don't worry you're good so you
[01:09:07] realized I happen to be on the team
[01:09:09] wrestling team that was
[01:09:11] undefeated and I think I had lost two
[01:09:14] matches that year so he was like at that
[01:09:17] point he was like I think I'm I'm sorry
[01:09:18] about that I'm I I didn't mean to cause
[01:09:20] a problem there like you probably should
[01:09:22] pay attention to what you're doing just
[01:09:24] because somebody looks like a ner

[01:10:34] anywhere so I'll go and check them out
[01:10:35] thank you very much Mo yeah if you want
[01:10:38] um I've been trying to get people to
[01:10:39] jump in and hang out with us into our
[01:10:42] um in our um I don't know why I just
[01:10:45] used that that was weird in our Discord
[01:10:48] because I've been trying to get people
[01:10:49] to play I want to use I want to play
[01:10:50] somehow I know you can play on dude
[01:10:53] tabletop simulator but I want to figure
[01:10:55] a way to play with the physical cards
[01:10:58] like using the using cameras or
[01:10:59] something I feel like that is there's
[01:11:01] got to be a way that we can do
[01:11:03] that like kind of like spell table does
[01:11:05] you
[01:11:08] know because I like the idea of it but I
[01:11:10] mean like the tabletop simulator but I
[01:11:12] feel like that's like you know you can
[01:11:13] pick whatever card you want and that
[01:11:14] type of
[01:11:15] thing yeah it will definitely take time
[01:11:18] well I was thinking we could do um just
[01:11:19] like even with Discord with the cameras
[01:11:21] with the videos you can just have your
[01:11:22] camera pain Point face down at your your
[01:11:24] your thing and we can have it all set up
[01:11:26] and you can and somebody can have maybe
[01:11:27] like proxy cards that they put down in
[01:11:29] the spots so that they know they're
[01:11:30] covered on their on their mat or
[01:11:32] something like that I don't know that's
[01:11:35] kind of the thoughts that were going
[01:11:36] through my head so far but we'll find
[01:11:37] we'll we'll figure out if I want to kind
[01:11:39] of I don't know it's nice I like how it
[01:11:40] works I feel like that could be the way
[01:11:43] but we'll keep
[01:11:44] going I know they play online with um
[01:11:47] with tabletop Simulator for my
[01:11:50] understanding all right let's get on to
[01:11:52] this next one next pack here this is is
[01:11:55] called sorcery Dragon Slayer the
[01:11:57] original some of the original artists
[01:11:58] from Magic the Gathering decided they
[01:12:00] wanted to do some cool art with a new
[01:12:02] game and they did and the game is like
[01:12:05] kind of like a magic the Gathering and
[01:12:06] chess mixed
[01:12:08] together so it's fun it's a cool
[01:12:11] one I myself though I know this is gonna
[01:12:14] sound crazy curiosa oh we don't need to
[01:12:17] do that I um people liked my games that

[01:12:21] games that we do on a regular basis I've
[01:12:23] been moving so I haven't gotten into

[01:12:27] lot of cool games here regularly and
[01:12:29] people seem to like them a lot with that

[01:15:07] are allows me to use reuse the um
[01:15:11] package here to keep things in and also
[01:15:15] it makes it so I don't bend or ding any
[01:15:17] cards
[01:15:18] up no I like to do this because I like
[01:15:20] putting the spoilers at the end because
[01:15:22] I was doing Alpha before and I know
[01:15:24] there's no curio and these but I like
[01:15:26] seeing the spoilers at the end now by
[01:15:28] doing it like this so I'm going to keep
[01:15:29] doing that all right let's get a good
[01:15:31] one here
[01:15:32] disenchant balmont long bowman fenville
[01:15:36] Muse Mad Dash lightning bolt Firebolts
[01:15:41] plume
[01:15:42] Pegasus
[01:15:44] sandworm polar bears ogre
[01:15:49] goons remote desert oh that's a nice
[01:15:52] looking
[01:15:53] one oh awakened mummies oo I like that I
[01:16:00] like that card a lot
[01:16:02] actually the art on that card's
[01:16:05] awesome C
[01:16:09] Raider guile siren oh I said I hadn't
[01:16:12] seen that before and I got it out of the
[01:16:13] alpha pack now I have one out of
[01:16:16] beta so I can play it oh oh warp spasms
[01:16:21] look at that art
[01:16:27] oh no they'll be packed last for sure
[01:16:29] yes we will all my game will always have
[01:16:31] the rares and everything at the end
[01:16:33] correct so it's a different one I'll um
[01:16:36] I can give you guys if you guys like I
[01:16:38] said if you want to join the Discord um
[01:16:40] we'll give we can do some more
[01:16:41] information I don't want to like give it
[01:16:42] away too much here but um I pretty much
[01:16:45] like I said I'm I'm really quick when it
[01:16:46] comes to things and I already had some
[01:16:47] of this stuff already partially
[01:16:48] developed and I just made it into cards
[01:16:50] instead of being the D and D Adventure
[01:16:53] so there's a little bit of dice roll
[01:16:54] mechanic in there not a lot it's more of
[01:16:56] an optional thing to if you want to try
[01:16:58] to have a chance of getting something to
[01:17:00] do better with it but it's never a
[01:17:02] required thing and it's not on every
[01:17:04] card so there are some of that there and
[01:17:06] you use dice also to help with some of
[01:17:08] the game to have the game move but other
[01:17:10] than that it's not um required parts of
[01:17:13] the car game so that's the fun thing
[01:17:15] about it too that's a nice unique I'm
[01:17:16] going to put that on in a top loader
[01:17:17] with my other unique because I just like
[01:17:19] those two
[01:17:22] uniques I like those two uniques and
[01:17:24] they're going at top
[01:17:27] loer 100% in the back for
[01:17:34] sure what do you guys think though you
[01:17:36] think it's a good idea for uh that I was
[01:17:38] looking at somewhere to make some cards
[01:17:40] it seems like I can have them done
[01:17:41] because I already have the um the the
[01:17:43] other tokens so I can make some play
[01:17:44] test ones to myself to try it out and
[01:17:47] then there's a couple of resources I was
[01:17:48] looking at online that can do large
[01:17:50] orders once I'm ready
[01:17:55] all right here we go I can even make
[01:17:56] deck boxes at some of these
[01:17:59] locations let's get some good luck here
[01:18:01] let's get a foil let's get a nice unique
[01:18:04] foil all right nice unique
[01:18:10] foil
[01:18:11] one
[01:18:13] two oh another Atlas three oh two
[01:18:16] atlases I like atlases four um I don't
[01:18:20] know how everyone has has that they have
[01:18:22] it early because they're associated with
[01:18:24] a store or they have a deal with the
[01:18:26] store so that they can get them like I
[01:18:27] have a I have stuff that I get but I
[01:18:29] can't do it early so I'm working on
[01:18:31] doing other things so I can get it so I
[01:18:32] can at least do it at pre-release
[01:18:34] time but yeah it is a little frustrating
[01:18:36] when you're a person here but hey let's
[01:18:38] get some good stuff here aerid Caravan
[01:18:41] Blood Ravens sacred scarabs sen hounds
[01:18:46] BOS troll dis spell midnight Rogue
[01:18:52] miracle workers clouds Spirit porcupine
[01:18:56] puffer
[01:18:57] fish rustic Village not bad I like the
[01:19:01] art on that oh here we go Coral some
[01:19:03] corals some nice uh goblins there oh our
[01:19:07] atlases that we were happy to get there
[01:19:09] nice windmill there we go got another
[01:19:12] Atlas which was a vantage Hills OH
[01:19:14] that'll always help with my deck there o
[01:19:17] and a unique pendulum of parall nice
[01:19:20] that means I can hold on to the Alpha
[01:19:22] One and just have that be like a card
[01:19:24] that I hold Londo and I can use this one
[01:19:26] in my deck as needed that works out
[01:19:33] nicely I have older stuff that I do have
[01:19:36] myself I like to have some like hey I
[01:19:38] got homelands look at that that's that's
[01:19:40] like 95 in there dude I remember going
[01:19:43] and saving my money and not buying like
[01:19:46] everything at lunch all the time and
[01:19:47] taking my $2 and that I'd save up from
[01:19:50] the week and go buying a pack of
[01:19:53] homelands see what I can do to update my
[01:19:55] deck when I was younger I wasn't we
[01:19:57] didn't have money I was we we had money
[01:20:00] we weren't poor but we didn't have a lot
[01:20:01] of money we were far from poor at some
[01:20:03] points we were but we worked our asses
[01:20:05] off to get away from
[01:20:07] there all right let me put this one in
[01:20:09] top order too we're going to put the
[01:20:10] uniques in top loaders just because
[01:20:11] they're beta
[01:20:13] cards and these are going to be huge in
[01:20:16] a few years GNA be huge in a few years
[01:20:27] why is the iug all of these shouldn't he
[01:20:31] allow his child to open
[01:20:34] them why is he opening all these oh well
[01:20:37] um dragon slayer uh this game is
[01:20:40] actually for people 13 and above I
[01:20:42] believe if I remember right let me check
[01:20:44] on the back on the back here I think it
[01:20:46] says anyways but anyways it's made for
[01:20:49] people 13 and above it's actually not
[01:20:51] made specifically for kids my kids
[01:20:53] happen to be at school so that's the
[01:20:55] reason why we're not doing that dra uh
[01:20:58] Dan so that's why we're doing it like
[01:21:00] this sorry Dragon I thought it was you
[01:21:02] that made that notice it was Dan but
[01:21:04] this is a nice card game we play all our
[01:21:05] time ourselves too all right here we go

[01:21:13] if I have my uh I'll show you why these
[01:21:17] ones are adult one more adult than
[01:21:19] children it's more like a it's an
[01:21:21] entertaining game that adults would play
[01:21:23] yep is really what it is helps it's like
[01:21:26] a chess mixed with a magic the Gathering
[01:21:28] so do children play chess all the
[01:21:31] time there hey you know what I was

[01:22:47] I like to play games and it happened to
[01:22:50] grow out to be a little bit bigger than
[01:22:51] I expected here and actually took over
[01:22:53] more time than I was thinking it was
[01:22:55] going to take over now that I do this
[01:22:57] more on a regular basis than I was
[01:22:59] actually expecting so I actually was a
[01:23:01] um I was a developer for many years um
[01:23:05] probably use develop some things that
[01:23:07] you use on a regular basis I actually uh
[01:23:10] had some very cool stories of what I
[01:23:12] used to do for work actually anybody
[01:23:13] want to hear some of the cool stories I

[01:23:45] some good experiences but you know I I
[01:23:47] busted my ass for many years which
[01:23:49] allows me to do my things that I want
[01:23:51] now my way and I still am able to do
[01:23:53] stuff to support the family which is
[01:23:55] nice all right we're going to open up
[01:23:56] this one sorcery pack here this beta one
[01:23:59] we'll see what this is oh yes I did say
[01:24:01] I was going to show you one of the cards
[01:24:02] though that's why we know this is not
[01:24:04] specifically for children hold on a
[01:24:05] second this is how you know the game is
[01:24:07] not for children specifically ready now
[01:24:10] I have another card that's even more
[01:24:13] there you go I don't think this is card
[01:24:15] is directly made for children would you
[01:24:16] say that's a children made card I don't
[01:24:20] know but anyways
[01:24:27] there you go some pendulum
[01:24:29] King sear there you go that's one of the
[01:24:33] examples of it that's an alpha card too
[01:24:35] by the way that's an alpha card too hey
[01:24:38] some people like playing games you know
[01:24:40] you play a video game do you'll play a
[01:24:41] game on your phone Dan at any
[01:24:46] point because I was wondering if you
[01:24:48] play any games on your phone or do you
[01:24:49] do you uh read books one two
[01:24:55] I got another Atlas three and four
[01:24:57] because I like seeing our spoilers at
[01:24:58] the end or do you watch TV and watch
[01:25:00] movies
[01:25:01] Dan men of
[01:25:03] Lang Rip Tide scorge zombies Old Salt
[01:25:08] Anchorman Mage Slayer pip vipers wall
[01:25:13] wild bors Highland Clansman
[01:25:18] exorcism simple Village for the last of
[01:25:21] the ordinaries there and that was UN I
[01:25:23] like that eel there that's a cool
[01:25:25] looking one there was it unla unland
[01:25:29] eel Mountain Pass not bad I think I have
[01:25:33] that one oh battering ram that's a nice
[01:25:35] one there o and a grim reaper oh I'll
[01:25:39] take a grim
[01:25:43] reaper only do yeah movies are horrible
[01:25:46] you only do things that improve your
[01:25:47] life and family's life exactly you can't
[01:25:49] ever watch
[01:25:51] anything yeah see that's what it is the
[01:25:52] artwork here is the selling point for
[01:25:54] for me definitely because it's handmade
[01:25:56] that's the thing that I like about it
[01:25:57] it's handmade
[01:25:58] art like somebody goes and paints a
[01:26:01] giant painting and they take a picture
[01:26:02] of it and they change it into anart and
[01:26:04] they make it into the art for the card I
[01:26:05] mean that's sweet to
[01:26:08] me yeah well I was going to add Dan was
[01:26:11] you know if you watch movies the
[01:26:12] difference here is instead of watching a
[01:26:14] movie we use our imagination and
[01:26:16] generate a movie when we play A
[01:26:19] games you know that's we go through
[01:26:21] different things like an maybe it's a
[01:26:23] battle maybe uh maybe in this one you're
[01:26:25] when you're playing a sorcery game
[01:26:27] you're you're you're you're working your
[01:26:29] way through an an adventure to as a
[01:26:32] pirate because that's what you build
[01:26:33] your deck as you know it's up to you
[01:26:35] what you want to do there but I'll take
[01:26:36] this exceptional In Here Also I mean
[01:26:39] unique
[01:26:44] one but you know that's what people like
[01:26:46] to do with their time some people like
[01:26:47] to you know sit veg out and stare at a
[01:26:49] television other people like to think
[01:26:51] that as a play when make their own car
[01:26:53] game you know make their own imagination
[01:26:55] game up in a way you know not make it up
[01:26:58] a game but you know play and use their
[01:26:59] imagination intelligence think rather
[01:27:01] than just vegging out some people like
[01:27:03] to think when they uh when they are
[01:27:05] relaxing like for me I used to read a
[01:27:08] lot more books but since playing
[01:27:10] cards I get to think in a different way
[01:27:12] strategically you know stuff like
[01:27:14] that right let's try another one here
[01:27:17] remember everybody if you want there are
[01:27:20] there is some sorcery here for all of
[01:27:22] you I have it already in there as a
[01:27:24] discount there for the day but I'll keep
[01:27:25] throwing them out every now and again if
[01:27:26] somebody wants to try three packs
[01:27:32] there or should we do this actually hold
[01:27:39] on we have the sorcery pole box if
[01:27:42] somebody wants to try it too oh Leo
[01:27:45] wants to go with it I like it
[01:27:48] Leo Perfecto I like it my friend so you
[01:27:52] get a fresh box we're opening up
[01:27:55] and Leo because you went with that and
[01:27:57] you got the fresh box that we're opening
[01:27:59] up this is what we do this is the things
[01:28:01] I like to do when we have fresh boxes we
[01:28:03] open you will get the promo card in here
[01:28:06] all right my friend oh take a second to
[01:28:09] take take care of that I've run into
[01:28:11] that before more than once with whatnot
[01:28:14] and them being a a pain so we'll get
[01:28:17] over here and I'm going to open up a box
[01:28:19] here quickly we're going to zoom out so
[01:28:20] we can see it and we'll open this up and
[01:28:22] this will be the store box hey Aether
[01:28:25] Dragon oh oh Aether Dragon oh I got your
[01:28:28] package yesterday it came back I saw in
[01:28:31] my I got it my PO Box they returned they
[01:28:34] I actually finally got it in the PO Box
[01:28:36] I had to talk to somebody like hey can
[01:28:38] you look and see if there's missing
[01:28:39] packages I got yours and one other
[01:28:41] person's in the PO box yesterday um so I
[01:28:45] guess yourself I'll um I I'll to print
[01:28:47] out a new label and get it shipped out
[01:28:48] to you I think wnau sent me a new label
[01:28:50] too saying to print it
[01:28:52] out that you had reached out to them
[01:28:54] so uh yeah let me know I just want to
[01:28:57] let you know that since yeah I don't
[01:28:59] know what I have no idea why they
[01:29:00] returned it to me where it said that
[01:29:02] your address was like inaccurate which
[01:29:04] is weird because I'm pretty sure it was
[01:29:06] a PO Box that you sent it
[01:29:10] to hey Leo I saw you having a bit of an
[01:29:13] issue there don't worry buddy take care
[01:29:15] take your time to take care of it I'm
[01:29:16] just going to get the Box open and ready
[01:29:18] so when you decide you want to you get
[01:29:20] it and whoever gets the first one's
[01:29:22] there
[01:29:24] all right Lori uh Leo you my friend
[01:29:28] having the one that opens this get the
[01:29:31] uh
[01:29:33] promo with the mini cards look at
[01:29:38] that so now that being said this is what
[01:29:42] I do here though whenever we open a box
[01:29:44] for you all we do something like this
[01:29:45] and I like to we Shuffle up the packs
[01:29:48] just because we were told that you can
[01:29:49] get a a chunk of them and they they will
[01:29:52] all as you've noticed they will be in uh
[01:29:54] there will be
[01:29:56] no no rares or uniques in some areas so
[01:30:00] we like I was told I need to shuffle the
[01:30:02] packs up one I can't remember who it was
[01:30:04] I think it was um Robert Robert was the
[01:30:07] one that said that we need to shuffle
[01:30:08] them up here so that we can
[01:30:11] uh have better chances of everything
[01:30:14] spread out because I guess they put they
[01:30:16] Bunch things together in the beta so far
[01:30:19] so I'm going give me un second here to
[01:30:21] do that so we can get a better chance
[01:30:23] for you all right and Leo after I do
[01:30:25] that quickly you can let me know where
[01:30:26] you want to go for
[01:30:28] this yes avoid the clump Zone that's
[01:30:30] what I was told I got to avoid the clump
[01:30:32] Zone because uh I mean as you can see
[01:30:35] you as I've been opening my packs you
[01:30:36] can even see that there's a clump
[01:30:39] zone so yep so that's just what I'm
[01:30:42] doing right now trying to avoid the
[01:30:43] clump
[01:30:47] Zone all right and then once the clump
[01:30:52] zone is avoided
[01:30:55] we will
[01:31:00] uh give you packs there yeah I was told
[01:31:04] to avoid the clump oh that should go
[01:31:06] over here we're going to do this
[01:31:08] actually we're going to shuffle this one
[01:31:10] more last time and then we're going to
[01:31:11] be done we're going to do the middle
[01:31:16] ones don't drop
[01:31:20] any all right and then you can tell me
[01:31:23] where you want to go my friend Leo cuz
[01:31:25] like you said there's Clump zones
[01:31:26] everywhere you want to try to avoid
[01:31:29] those by shuffling this up a
[01:31:32] little I was told Robert I think it was
[01:31:34] Robert Maynard told me
[01:31:36] that very intelligent dude that
[01:31:39] Maynard that's a lot they have a lot of
[01:31:41] stuff they uh they do learned actually a
[01:31:45] decent amount from them on on different
[01:31:47] locations and um stuff for selling cards
[01:31:49] too like I'm going to be uh him and a
[01:31:52] buddy the other guy in the morning Jason
[01:31:55] they were talking about a company to use
[01:31:56] for some bulk stuff I'm like oh I didn't
[01:31:58] know they had that company so now that I
[01:32:00] know I'll end up using that company to
[01:32:03] do some of my bulk stuff all right buddy

[01:32:31] when you come and do this here for some
[01:32:32] reason it takes them like you have to
[01:32:33] authorize it the first time because they
[01:32:35] don't like I guess people uh guess

[01:47:20] type games they were like Wizards needs
[01:47:21] to get a hold of you to make a game
[01:47:23] I I made my own one having fun and then
[01:47:26] I realized that game could be turned
[01:47:28] into a card one if I did a couple milor
[01:47:31] modifications because I found online a
[01:47:33] place to get cards made and I was like o

[01:47:43] everybody seems to be liking everybody
[01:47:44] really liked the Fallout game so let's

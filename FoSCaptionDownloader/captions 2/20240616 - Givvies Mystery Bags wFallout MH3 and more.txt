[01:24:33] I don't know yeah you think it's a good
[01:24:34] idea all right making milkshake oh I

[01:24:41] milkshakes all right all right we can do
[01:24:43] something like that then we'll do
[01:24:45] something like that maybe you guys will
[01:24:46] get some uh maybe you guys will get some
[01:24:49] uh cards good cards here all right so
[01:24:51] I'm gonna have some I need you guys to
[01:24:52] help
[01:24:53] me I need you guys to help me then so
[01:24:56] where' they go ah there it
[01:24:59] is I have a whole
[01:25:02] box because we've only gone through one
[01:25:04] box so far we haven't fully gone through
[01:25:06] one box we have still some of it left

[01:25:21] open number four I got a number four
[01:25:24] number four okay number four I got two
[01:25:27] number fours so I think I'm going number
[01:25:29] four four from the four from the left oh
[01:25:32] oh which it is is a four from the right
[01:25:33] or left one two three four I was going

[01:25:37] four I I'm doing this one as four this
[01:25:41] is number four we got fours we have
[01:25:44] three fours and a couple of Threes so
[01:25:46] we're going to go with that one because
[01:25:47] that would have been three from the
[01:25:48] right if we did it the other way so
[01:25:50] there you go that would have been the
[01:25:52] three from the right or four from the

[02:16:10] this is what we're going to do right
[02:16:11] now you have
[02:16:15] some Denver did you type in um giby so I
[02:16:19] know what our next one was going to be I
[02:16:21] don't know if he did I don't think he
[02:16:23] did so I need somebody to type in SLG
[02:16:25] for me then I'm going to put out those
[02:16:28] coming up next
[02:16:32] year
[02:16:39] good Death guy did it thank you we'll
[02:16:43] put out a colossal dread mask for a foil
[02:16:46] there coming up for you
[02:16:48] guys thank you and
[02:16:51] what I'll do next is this is like I was
[02:16:54] saying I'm G put three of these
[02:16:57] on running for this I'm going run three
[02:16:59] of these in a row starting at
[02:17:01] 19 all right three of those at a row
[02:17:05] starting at 19 is what I'm going to
[02:17:10] do and we'll uh put those in the front
[02:17:12] so in case when we start going through
[02:17:14] singles we have those right in the front
[02:17:15] there to go
[02:17:18] through all righty and we'll do those
[02:17:21] now Death guy what number I'll do uh
[02:17:24] I'll do them them like right in a row so
[02:17:25] that way you can have them all right in
[02:17:26] a row all right reason I I just I I got
[02:17:30] in trouble last time when I combined
[02:17:31] them so I refuse I can't combine them
[02:17:34] anymore so that's the only reason why I
[02:17:36] have to do it like
[02:17:38] this like I had done it where I was like
[02:17:40] somebody wanted to get two or three of
[02:17:41] them and I did it that way and whatnot
[02:17:43] said because I didn't have the average
[02:17:45] in there the ceiling and the floor that
[02:17:48] they suspended me for a week I'm like
[02:17:49] the person asked for
[02:17:51] combo what like what did I do wrong and
[02:17:55] they ended up changing rules I guess
[02:17:56] later to make it so that all of them
[02:17:57] have to have certain things so yeah all
[02:18:02] right that's why I have to do it the way
[02:18:05] I'm doing it now sadly I would have
[02:18:07] loved to do it the other way but they
[02:18:09] just they just are um sticklers I guess
[02:18:11] we'll say they're sticklers for their
[02:18:14] rules so there you go we got all three
[02:18:16] of those going for you thank you death
[02:18:19] guy I like that see what you got my wife

[03:24:38] the idea of holding the cards with doing
[03:24:39] a little bit different and adding some
[03:24:41] my other stuff to it like adding making
[03:24:42] it into a little bit of a stand cuz
[03:24:44] somebody gave that idea and I was like
[03:24:45] you know I can add more of them to it if

[03:24:50] to it so we got more of a stand so we

[03:34:57] said I was going to throw that out for

[03:34:59] after shipping discount is when you ever
[03:35:01] you get um a a a giveaway you pretty
[03:35:04] much get a discount on your shipping
[03:35:06] because um it takes the price of the
[03:35:07] shipping that I pay off of what you pay
[03:35:09] for shipping so say you won like three
[03:35:12] giveaways and they were all like the one
[03:35:13] single CS all it would be like I think
[03:35:15] it's like 88 cents per card so you take
[03:35:16] 88 cents times three and that would be
[03:35:19] like what you're taking off for your
[03:35:20] shipping from because I'm paying for it
[03:35:23] so that's what I was saying like it
[03:35:24] discounts on your shipping whenever you
[03:35:25] win a giveaway yeah
[03:35:30] yeah so if you yeah exactly that's kind
[03:35:32] of why I like to run giveaways here

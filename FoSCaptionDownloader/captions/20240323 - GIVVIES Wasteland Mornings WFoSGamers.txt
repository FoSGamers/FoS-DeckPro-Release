[00:04:02] say
[00:04:05] um they wouldn't listen to me the funny
[00:04:08] thing was that the older gentleman
[00:04:09] didn't know what he was doing much he
[00:04:10] just knew the products and whenever they
[00:04:12] had to build certain things he they'd
[00:04:13] come back to me and be like hey James

[00:04:16] screw would you say we'd use in this
[00:04:17] situation like oh yeah you want to grab
[00:04:19] this one and they the guy would come
[00:04:21] back and be like you're talking to him

[00:10:56] some code red in the morning for you yes
[00:11:00] all right yeah I don't do codee red
[00:11:01] anymore I used to have that for a long
[00:11:03] drank that for a long time when I was
[00:11:05] growing up um that was one of the few
[00:11:08] things that I uh I I was at the camp
[00:11:11] used to go to it was like a a camp then
[00:11:12] the summer my family had like a trailer
[00:11:14] at like a seasonal site and um we used
[00:11:17] to go there
[00:11:18] and hang out with and ride our bikes to
[00:11:21] this uh corner store where you could buy
[00:11:24] the soda Coke in a bottle that was the
[00:11:26] real sugar Coke which is when I found
[00:11:28] out what Coke tastes like and I was like
[00:11:30] wow this stuff is delicious I can't
[00:11:32] believe they don't make Coke like this
[00:11:33] anymore but anyways different story
[00:11:39] um but we would remember we had the code
[00:11:42] red bottles they never had them anywhere
[00:11:43] else so I had I get them
[00:11:46] there so right over specifically to get
[00:11:48] code red there like to get a our energy
[00:11:51] in the in the afternoon when we're like

[00:12:03] Jupiter see the see I will say the same
[00:12:06] thing but if you drink the one with real
[00:12:08] sugar it is completely different I'm
[00:12:11] telling you right now completely
[00:12:15] different and I think it is the um I
[00:12:17] personally think it's the the fructose
[00:12:19] in it that makes a lot of it taste gross
[00:12:21] and bad and feel gross after having the
[00:12:23] ones with real sugar like cuz I'm going
[00:12:26] to read this off here first big winner

[00:30:14] against somebody that had in their War
[00:30:16] the uh the War Doctor deck I can't
[00:30:18] remember what one they had they had a
[00:30:20] war doctor in it and I can't remember
[00:30:22] what duck it was the and it has
[00:30:24] something like you pick out the card and
[00:30:26] it was the only card is a Tardis that he
[00:30:27] put in the deck that had two or less so
[00:30:31] um literally went through I think it was
[00:30:34] 70 cards so he had 70 time counters and
[00:30:36] he's just like all right you're dead
[00:30:38] like [ __ ] son of a [ __ ] like that
[00:30:40] like it was like the third third or
[00:30:43] fourth turn of the game I was like
[00:30:46] seriously guys all right I'm G to put
[00:30:48] those
[00:30:54] back let's see what else we got
[00:30:56] here you know what you said you were
[00:30:59] liking some uh ioria let's put up just
[00:31:01] some ioria right now all right let's do
[00:31:03] that for you I know it's not any
[00:31:05] collectors you can potentially get them
[00:31:07] out of here though let's see aoria we
[00:31:10] have that on oh that's a pretty good
[00:31:12] deal on those ones I forgot I didn't add
[00:31:13] that that's good we'll do with this
[00:31:15] three of those for this if you want to
[00:31:17] try to get yourself some
[00:31:20] triumphs that's if you want to do the
[00:31:21] adventure game we'll call this three
[00:31:23] strength on the adventure game the
[00:31:24] adventure game is actually an animated
[00:31:26] little game that we do here we started
[00:31:28] this up because uh the kids and family
[00:31:31] like having fun and doing this type of
[00:31:34] thing so we wanted to uh have some fun
[00:31:37] play a little game with all of you and
[00:31:40] we generated this Nolan helped come up
[00:31:42] with it with me actually well Nolan was
[00:31:44] one of the ones to help come up with it
[00:31:45] me he um then then uh we had some other
[00:31:48] ideas from others but he was the primary
[00:31:50] person that was like oh do this or do
[00:31:51] that I was like oh that's actually a
[00:31:53] good
[00:31:54] idea greenbull all right so have you
[00:31:56] played the game here before green
[00:31:59] cuz what happens is you always get your
[00:32:01] Vault pack here which you're I think
[00:32:02] you're going to be pretty excited about
[00:32:03] the Vault pack I don't have many of
[00:32:06] those and I just happen to put one out
[00:32:07] here's our 10 bosses that you could
[00:32:08] potentially go against but what happens
[00:32:10] here is you have this this is three
[00:32:12] strength you pick your character at the
[00:32:14] top all right that's okay green B I'll
[00:32:16] explain it you pick your character at
[00:32:17] the top there and then what happens is
[00:32:19] is you wander through your Wasteland and
[00:32:21] we call it the Wasteland cuz we have an
[00:32:22] animated Adventure here so you pick your
[00:32:24] character and use three p things that
[00:32:26] you go through red has 78
[00:32:28] green has 78 and blue has three cards
[00:32:31] and what happens is you just pick one
[00:32:33] from each of them hopefully you get one
[00:32:35] it's a plus one or minus one on your
[00:32:36] strength and hopefully you get enough
[00:32:38] strength where you can beat at least one
[00:32:39] of the bosses here there are 10 bosses
[00:32:41] it's potential with three of these you
[00:32:43] could actually get up to be able to tie
[00:32:46] half of the bosses and beat three of the
[00:32:50] bosses so you do have a good chance here
[00:32:52] on doing that if you ended up getting
[00:32:54] all three going your strength up so you
[00:32:56] pick whatever you want to be for the
[00:32:57] character
[00:32:58] that's how you go green bow that's the
[00:33:01] little game we kind kind of created with
[00:33:03] the kids here to have some fun now just
[00:33:05] turned out a
[00:33:09] light there we go let's fix that not out
[00:33:14] anymore so you choose what you'd like to
[00:33:16] be there my friend and we go through our

[00:34:30] one of these boxes my
[00:34:35] friend oh you go one in each one of each

[00:34:45] can tell Ram from each of them one of
[00:34:47] each of those I'm sorry I wasn't clear
[00:34:49] there yes so each of these is considered
[00:34:52] one of the strength depending on what
[00:34:54] One Plus or one minus strength that's
[00:34:56] how you can get three strength when you
[00:34:57] want
[00:34:59] so this is like food this is like a
[00:35:00] friend or an item and then the last
[00:35:02] one's like a companion or an enemy

[00:35:07] explain that well I'm sorry sometimes I
[00:35:10] uh get distracted by people in the
[00:35:12] morning and things going on in the

[00:35:39] the green I can go the back one on the
[00:35:40] green we'll do the back one on the green
[00:35:43] instead back one in the
[00:35:45] green no problem no problem I can do
[00:35:47] that not a problem at all we haven't
[00:35:49] flipped anything over and done anything
[00:35:50] I'm good with
[00:35:51] that I'm good with that so I'm going to
[00:35:54] do the red one though right now cuz the
[00:35:55] first one we go through and let me know
[00:35:56] what you want to do on the blue and the
[00:35:58] and their boss after well you're going
[00:36:00] and you're wandering through this
[00:36:01] Wasteland cuz a detective they need
[00:36:02] treasure though when they wander through
[00:36:04] the Wasteland wonderful because the
[00:36:06] detective they can take that treasure
[00:36:08] they find something glint in the
[00:36:09] distance and they pick that up and they
[00:36:10] go wonderful now I have something to
[00:36:11] trade for information beautiful you are
[00:36:14] now at four strength as you wander
[00:36:16] through the Wasteland here all right
[00:36:19] greenbull now with that four strength as
[00:36:21] you wander through this Wasteland you're
[00:36:23] looking for a friend or an item along
[00:36:25] the way that could help you you look and
[00:36:27] you find oh look at this a detective
[00:36:30] wonderful for a detective Clues are
[00:36:33] helpful I mean every detective love the
[00:36:35] clue that clue helps the detective along
[00:36:38] the way giving him a little bit more
[00:36:40] information to find their way around the
[00:36:42] Wasteland safely look at that they are
[00:36:44] now at five strength oh I forgot to do
[00:36:46] it they have
[00:36:52] uh found where is it they have a friend
[00:36:54] that they find a clue and they got a
[00:36:56] clue from friend in the distance there
[00:36:59] all right now you're wandering on
[00:37:02] through and you have uh looks like there
[00:37:04] could be a companion maybe an enemy I'm
[00:37:06] not sure what it is you have one of 12
[00:37:08] you can go through here my
[00:37:12] friend Nick Valentine Nick Valentine
[00:37:15] wandering through exactly yes blue one
[00:37:19] two all right and then on uh the boss
[00:37:23] you have 10 you can go with as you
[00:37:24] wander through this Wasteland you look
[00:37:26] for a friend to help help you along the
[00:37:28] way hopefully you can find another
[00:37:29] detective to help you but oh no you do
[00:37:32] not find one a fungus dinosaur comes
[00:37:34] raging around the corner you dive into a
[00:37:37] into a building to get away from it but
[00:37:39] luckily you only drop one of your Clues
[00:37:41] so you only your clue there so you still
[00:37:43] have four strength as you wander through
[00:37:44] the Wasteland which is good because that
[00:37:47] means you can potentially beat three of
[00:37:50] the F uh the 10 bosses here in the
[00:37:53] Wasteland where would you like to go my
[00:37:56] friend on this green green bow any one
[00:38:00] of these 10 you're wandering because as
[00:38:02] you wander that detective you see a
[00:38:04] vault in the distance you go you know
[00:38:05] what I think I'm going to go hide in
[00:38:06] that Vault recuperate a little bit get
[00:38:09] away from those things like those uh big
[00:38:10] giant fungus
[00:38:12] dinosaurs roll D20 oh I don't know if I
[00:38:16] can do that right here uh
[00:38:18] anymore um I don't think they let you do
[00:38:20] that um how about this do you have one
[00:38:23] you can do and and I can how I how this
[00:38:25] I put a wheel up I can put a wheel up
[00:38:28] and do 1 through 10 on the wheel and and
[00:38:30] spin that I think I might be able to do
[00:38:33] that if you want hopefully uh hopefully
[00:38:36] that doesn't get me in trouble but here
[00:38:38] let's uh let me do that you said you
[00:38:40] want to do you wanted to do it random so
[00:38:42] I'm going to do
[00:38:44] that one
[00:38:49] two you said he wanted a
[00:38:53] random for um this for uh for this here
[00:38:57] he requested random to find the boss cuz
[00:38:59] it Doesn't Really Matter he's going to
[00:39:00] win if he wins or loses it's he's always
[00:39:03] getting the Vault pack so he wanted it
[00:39:06] random yes uh cuz I guess you can have a
[00:39:09] weighted dice is what I was told so do
[00:39:13] you want me to shuffle
[00:39:16] it yes you want me to uh randomize this
[00:39:19] at all Shuffle spin the wheel let's spin
[00:39:26] it
[00:39:28] number seven all right number seven it
[00:39:31] is we're going to hide the
[00:39:33] randomizer one two three four five six
[00:39:36] and seven yeah something about it could
[00:39:38] potentially have weighted dice I guess I
[00:39:40] don't know there we go this is the boss
[00:39:42] as you go towards that Wasteland in the
[00:39:44] vault you see the boss coming running
[00:39:45] towards you in the distance oh no and it
[00:39:48] is running and charging towards you
[00:39:50] luckily you are quick enough to run and
[00:39:53] dive into that Wasteland Vault safely
[00:39:56] away from from your Triceratops running
[00:40:00] through the Wasteland and you know what
[00:40:02] happens there that's okay cuz in the
[00:40:03] distance in that Vault you see a pack of
[00:40:05] cards in a safe from 1992 it is a pack
[00:40:09] from
[00:40:11] lucasfilm The Young Indiana Jones
[00:40:15] Chronicles oh my look at that that's
[00:40:17] what you found in the Wasteland Vault
[00:40:20] pack that's what was in there that's
[00:40:22] what your Vault pack was sadly you did
[00:40:24] not beat the boss which means there is
[00:40:27] no Loot drop right now maybe later maybe
[00:40:29] later we'll have some loot drops going
[00:40:32] maybe get some more giveaways up there
[00:40:33] and have a Loot drop going and we'll
[00:40:35] find out because loot drops are $1
[00:40:37] starts if you beat the boss that's why

[00:52:40] [Laughter]
[00:52:43] boosters I I like the collector boosters
[00:52:45] when I was able to get

[00:53:22] calim
[00:53:24] um big fan of the CW boosters actually
[00:53:27] they were really cool at least I thought
[00:53:29] they were really
[00:53:31] cool I thought they were really cool
[00:53:33] some of the people did I like the um the
[00:53:35] Giants in
[00:53:37] them see I haven't been around for like
[00:53:39] I was around in the early 90s with sets
[00:53:42] and then I didn't um and I wasn't around
[00:53:44] until like uh probably recently
[00:53:49] because my kids found
[00:53:54] stuff my cards when we were moving
[00:53:57] around and I was like oh that's kind of
[00:53:58] cool let's find those and they wanted to
[00:54:00] play with them a little bit and I was
[00:54:01] like you know what why not why not we'll
[00:54:04] play with
[00:54:09] them see some of these have dropped a
[00:54:11] little bit and I want to make sure I'm
[00:54:13] not charging you overcharging you that's
[00:54:15] why I'm going through this here the
[00:54:17] fourel precon became my f my 12th doctor

[00:54:29] actually any more bobbleheads or Viger I
[00:54:32] do have fog Walker I am not sure about
[00:54:36] bobbleheads I can check on those I don't
[00:54:39] think I have any bobbleheads left um
[00:54:42] we're all right I do have to say that I
[00:54:45] don't think I have any bobbleheads left
[00:54:46] I'm going to put this back here while I
[00:54:48] continue getting the the prices here for
[00:54:50] you and yeah I had the kelheim ones
[00:54:54] those are nice for the collectors but I
[00:54:55] haven't been able find any more of them
[00:54:57] that at a price that I can I would
[00:54:59] consider acceptable I only have two
[00:55:02] collector boosters left of this guys I'm
[00:55:04] going to put one
[00:55:06] out I only have two collector boosters
[00:55:09] of this left so I'm going to put one
[00:55:11] out
[00:55:15] with you know what like I was saying I
[00:55:17] want some calim open let's put one let's
[00:55:19] just put one pack of with it all right I
[00:55:22] don't need all of them just
[00:55:24] one okay we're GNA do
[00:55:27] this
[00:55:32] here for those that want to try their
[00:55:36] luck on
[00:55:37] it that will be uh we'll call that three
[00:55:40] strength as You Adventure in the
[00:55:43] Wasteland dude it's extremely hard to
[00:55:46] get Fox boxes a follow I um I I will say
[00:55:49] this I'm exceptionally pissed I ordered
[00:55:50] a lot more um and then um they just
[00:55:53] never ended up coming through right so
[00:55:56] oh I actually ordered um in total 24
[00:56:00] boxes I got two when I initially got my
[00:56:04] delivery and I was like
[00:56:06] what what and they couldn't do anything
[00:56:08] about it it's what they got it's what
[00:56:10] they sent they got it's what they were
[00:56:13] sent themselves they had to put
[00:56:15] everybody down I'm like seriously I
[00:56:17] ordered 20 boxes this is
[00:56:22] insane so that's why uh that's why we're
[00:56:25] at where we at
[00:56:27] now I'm guessing they're going to come
[00:56:29] out with another release like they did
[00:56:31] with Lord of the Rings where they say oh
[00:56:33] here comes our Lord of the Rings special
[00:56:35] edition and it's going to be the Fallout
[00:56:37] special edition
[00:56:38] One D I love too I was a big fan played
[00:56:41] it I liter I think I've said this before
[00:56:43] but I waited in line for um that for
[00:56:48] like for that when I was a kid and I
[00:56:50] actually got that was the first time I
[00:56:51] remember getting yelled at by my mom for
[00:56:54] being out too late because I waited in
[00:56:57] line for the
[00:57:00] um for the release of it and I wanted to
[00:57:03] see
[00:57:04] it cuz I wanted the game I had friends
[00:57:07] that like that were talking about it we
[00:57:08] had read about it in um game magazine CU
[00:57:11] that's how you read about him back then
[00:57:13] you didn't read about them about
[00:57:14] anywhere
[00:57:15] else that one dropped
[00:57:18] too so that's why you know and then you
[00:57:22] wait outline and I remember that and
[00:57:23] I've been I've had every single one of
[00:57:25] them
[00:57:26] all the way through
[00:57:29] 76 I'm not a fan uh 76 was good it was
[00:57:32] just it was
[00:57:36] um it was good it just wasn't what I
[00:57:39] wanted it to be I guess I think it could
[00:57:41] have been
[00:57:43] better PC Fallout one and two was
[00:57:45] awesome yeah they were so good 76 is
[00:57:47] definitely
[00:57:49] terrible
[00:57:50] see oh wow you have over $4,000 in the
[00:57:53] game grindle what happened
[00:57:58] what
[00:58:02] happened grle no refund
[00:58:06] what did I miss
[00:58:12] something oh I did get a refund on my
[00:58:14] boxes yes yes I got a refund on my boxes
[00:58:18] and it wasn't it wasn't that it was just
[00:58:20] I ordered
[00:58:22] 24 you know that's the thing that sucks
[00:58:25] well one of them I'm still arguing with
[00:58:27] um TCG player about because they're just
[00:58:31] pain in the butt cuz I did order some
[00:58:32] from other places after I had a hard
[00:58:34] time getting them and I was like screw
[00:58:35] it I'm going to try to order from
[00:58:36] somewhere else and I've been arguing
[00:58:39] with them for um just say a while
[00:58:43] now
[00:58:44] week their customer service is just piss
[00:58:53] poor trying to resolve something that
[00:58:56] Tak like 10 minutes to resolve and
[00:59:00] that's the thing that's the frustrating
[00:59:02] part about
[00:59:05] it yeah yeah thank you I understood that
[00:59:07] I figure that out
[00:59:10] after dude I wonder if that I see too
[00:59:12] see my I've have had people tell me they
[00:59:14] were really good for a long time and for
[00:59:18] me um I thought they were I like you
[00:59:21] know I thought they were really good too
[00:59:24] but um
[00:59:27] the
[00:59:28] first I know three or four times I
[00:59:30] bought from them a while ago when I
[00:59:31] needed like one random card or
[00:59:34] something see this one changed too this
[00:59:37] is a dollar instead of a120
[00:59:40] a150 so there you go I don't want to get

[01:02:11] change so much daily that I like CH
[01:02:14] checking them every day if that makes
[01:02:17] any sense it's just because they change
[01:02:19] like literally every day anyways from
[01:02:22] like $3 to $10 and I don't want to give
[01:02:24] somebody that like a car that was $10

[01:24:40] um and then there was some of the other
[01:24:41] cards that we went through that were
[01:24:42] like a dollar to $3 each so here we are

[01:26:52] my friend that jumped on this
[01:26:55] magic I like how you chose the name

[01:26:59] doing that
[01:27:02] name like when I saw it the first time I
[01:27:05] was like oh that is awesome I was a big
[01:27:07] fan of the

[01:27:17] right keep the rest so we're going to

[01:31:37] called All right we do what I call a $1
[01:31:40] loot pack drop and with that $1 loot
[01:31:42] pack drop it could be anything from a
[01:31:44] set booster to a collector booster and

[01:31:51] used to have it where that was one of
[01:31:53] the chances you what you could win but
[01:31:55] um whatnot did not like that and they
[01:31:58] gave me a problem so I had to change it

[02:00:56] bit let's run the big blue book a little
[02:00:59] bit I don't know if you're going to want
[02:01:00] to do this but we're going to do three
[02:01:02] spins of the big blue
[02:01:04] book that's what I'm going to put up I'm
[02:01:07] going to do that three spins of the Big
[02:01:09] Blue Book right here going run that
[02:01:12] there in the Big Blue Book for all of
[02:01:14] you that know currently there is only
[02:01:16] um I don't know 75 spots left but there
[02:01:21] you go there's that for the Big Blue
[02:01:23] Book those are what you get there if you
[02:01:25] don't say the floor right now is like
[02:01:27] Wasteland is the floor all right but
[02:01:30] you're you have like a soul ring in
[02:01:31] there you could get our ceiling is
[02:01:33] balin's Tomb but we spin the wheel you
[02:01:36] see what we get there whatever is
[02:01:37] attached to it so like you get breeding
[02:01:39] pool you're going to get a set draft of
[02:01:40] a set of AFR and an LCI draft so like
[02:01:42] there you go that's pretty good deal on
[02:01:43] all that and that's what we got there is
[02:01:46] running I'll put that up there I don't
[02:01:48] even think that
[02:01:49] ran we'll do one of them again we'll do
[02:01:52] one
[02:01:53] though we'll run one here we don't
[02:01:57] generally do it this low but I'm going
[02:01:59] to do it low and I'm going do for a
[02:02:00] couple minut a minute and a half I need
[02:02:02] to get something accomplished here it
[02:02:03] looks like my amount of cards didn't
[02:02:07] save for what was uh here last time so I
[02:02:10] got to make a copy of this then I have
[02:02:13] to remove
[02:02:17] some mean it looks like they did not put
[02:02:21] them all in
[02:02:22] so I have to remove
[02:02:27] that I have to
[02:02:32] remove
[02:02:34] that I have to
[02:02:37] remove that why I didn't save last time
[02:02:40] that's
[02:02:41] frustrating so remove
[02:02:45] that that's really frustrating it saved
[02:02:47] the last game but not this
[02:02:49] one I have to remove this
[02:02:54] this
[02:02:58] this it saved when I transferred over
[02:03:01] the last time but this time for whatever
[02:03:03] reason when I transferred it over it did
[02:03:05] not
[02:03:10] save so I have to make a couple
[02:03:12] adjustments to make sure that everything
[02:03:14] that was in here is taken out that was
[02:03:16] already taken out I don't want to have
[02:03:18] anybody picking out a number that was
[02:03:20] already there or not give everybody the
[02:03:22] correct opportunity for the right amount
[02:03:25] here definitely a good deal in the big
[02:03:27] loo book everybody you you have a they
[02:03:29] have an excellent deal on the big glue
[02:03:31] book I don't know anybody that does it
[02:03:33] out and they're like oh wow that was
[02:03:34] really cool like they got exactly what
[02:03:36] they were looking for that type of thing
[02:03:38] so it's always a good deal with the big
[02:03:41] loo book not too many people have
[02:03:43] something like this um set up that way
[02:03:46] you can see exactly what you're going to
[02:03:48] get and on top of it with seeing exactly
[02:03:51] what you're going to get even if you
[02:03:53] don't get something awesome you end up
[02:03:55] coming out like for a card you end up
[02:03:57] coming out with uh some packs as a
[02:03:58] chance of getting something too and
[02:04:00] that's what I like doing about it
[02:04:01] because um it gives you the potential of
[02:04:03] getting something out of a pack even
[02:04:05] though you don't may not get a high
[02:04:07] value C you're still going to be able to
[02:04:09] get a pack of something and you could
[02:04:10] potentially get something out of one of
[02:04:11] the packs or at least you're going to
[02:04:12] get some cards to play with rather than
[02:04:14] just one card that you may not even want
[02:04:16] cuz sometimes their cards like you know
[02:04:18] I've had a person be like I don't even
[02:04:19] want that card you can give that up I'm
[02:04:21] like oh I'm sorry s man I didn't know
[02:04:22] like you didn't want that carard that
[02:04:23] bad he's like I hate it but at least in
[02:04:25] that scenario he had some packs that he
[02:04:27] was able to actually luckily get
[02:04:28] something he wanted out of so that's why
[02:04:30] I uh that's why I kind of like doing it
[02:04:33] the way I do it here and I'm almost done
[02:04:35] with my wheel Corrections because they
[02:04:38] uh did not save the last time I made
[02:04:41] them I did it there here we
[02:04:44] go no there we
[02:04:49] are there we go all the wheels there
[02:04:51] correct ly let me get that in there

[02:15:35] know if you're hanging out still paying
[02:15:37] attention no one wanted to go for it all
[02:15:39] right all right I'm going a little bit
[02:15:42] slow this morning I guess uh my guess is
[02:15:44] there's somebody on giving continuous
[02:15:45] giveaways of things that aren't even
[02:15:48] being told what they are and that's the
[02:15:49] thing that's frustrating to me is people
[02:15:50] like I'm going to give this away and
[02:15:52] they don't even tell you what it is and
[02:15:53] then you just then it shows up to your
[02:15:55] house and you're like oh cool I I don't
[02:15:57] that was like not what I was expecting
[02:16:00] but here let's do some more of this
[02:16:01] that's why I like to show you what we're
[02:16:03] doing here that's why I like to show you
[02:16:04] what we're doing here let's do this
[02:16:06] actually we'll call this three
[02:16:08] strength this GNA be two that's is going
[02:16:10] to be
[02:16:11] one all
[02:16:16] right we'll call this
[02:16:19] here
[02:16:25] that for your adventure in the Wasteland
[02:16:27] and you get a pack here from 92 if you
[02:16:30] want it from your Wasteland
[02:16:33] Adventure someone sent me Bas land for G
[02:16:36] I threw it yeah exactly exactly mantle
[02:16:39] Shadow blood rage mirock Queen anguish
[02:16:41] on making verid descent bog little
[02:16:44] plasma cutter Duchess wake the pass
[02:16:47] agent Frank vault 11 Temple of
[02:16:50] enlightenment that's what I mean there
[02:16:51] like people just give away and you don't
[02:16:53] know what it is and I don't mind like
[02:16:55] that doing giveaways like that but uh it
[02:16:58] to me it just seems a little um
[02:17:02] disingenuous that's all that's all and I
[02:17:06] I don't I'm not that type of person so
[02:17:08] that's why I'm you know I'm a different
[02:17:09] type of person that's all that's all TI
[02:17:13] all oh this is what we're giving away
[02:17:16] right now we have a few cards up there
[02:17:18] about about $3 worth of cards between
[02:17:20] lord of the rings and Fallout and uh
[02:17:24] Doctor Who someone wants to go and find
[02:17:27] a monoc crypt though with us we do have
[02:17:29] a lot of sealed things here having some
[02:17:31] fun this morning have a little bit of
[02:17:32] fun a little bit slow for some reason
[02:17:34] this morning I feel like there's
[02:17:36] probably a lot of people on are you all
[02:17:37] looking for like Doctor Who or
[02:17:39] something good give keep viewers exactly
[02:17:41] and I'm trying to do good ones but uh I
[02:17:43] don't know sometimes I a lot of people
[02:17:45] coming in I think part of though is um
[02:17:48] when they when what not put me in
[02:17:49] trouble because they said that I G I was
[02:17:52] doing the game this adventure game they
[02:17:55] told me to change it because I needed to

[02:20:01] remember everybody we have all kinds of
[02:20:02] different games there's uh many of them
[02:20:05] here I
[02:20:07] have uh gnomes I've been saving a box
[02:20:10] topper for you okay I don't know if you
[02:20:12] want it or not it does have a little bit
[02:20:14] when I pulled it out it was a little bit
[02:20:15] of a bent Bend here um the card doesn't
[02:20:18] seem bent inside if the card is bent
[02:20:21] inside you don't need to take it I'll
[02:20:22] get but um I I have been saving this one
[02:20:24] for you cuz I know you like the box
[02:20:26] hoers and um I got some more aoria ones
[02:20:29] also if you were
[02:20:33] interested a mutant is a creature type
[02:20:35] yes mutant is a creature type so here
[02:20:39] these are all your characters and yes a
[02:20:41] mutant is a creature type generally
[02:20:46] ninja yes if it says creature is a
[02:20:48] mutant you should be able to yes
[02:20:52] says so mutant um
[02:20:55] here like let me see if I can find a
[02:20:57] mutant in here like see lizard mutant
[02:20:59] creature generally all of them say
[02:21:01] creature next to them for mutant unless
[02:21:03] it doesn't say creature next to it for
[02:21:04] whatever reason see like anything that
[02:21:07] says creature next to it is going to
[02:21:09] mean it's a creature so for some reason
[02:21:11] it doesn't say creature next to it see
[02:21:13] like creature mutant zombie if for
[02:21:15] whatever reason it doesn't say creature
[02:21:17] next to it then it is not a creature and
[02:21:19] you cannot do that so that's what I'm
[02:21:21] saying there these all say creature
[02:21:23] mutant so you can do
[02:21:27] that yeah as long as it says creature as
[02:21:31] long as it says creature in the on the
[02:21:33] card you can call it as long as it says
[02:21:39] creature correct zombie mutant you
[02:21:41] choose mutant you're good doesn't matter
[02:21:43] mutant is part of it
[02:21:44] correct it is a zombie mutant that is
[02:21:47] fine I I that's from my understanding
[02:21:51] that I've been playing with dude no
[02:21:53] problem no problem I've had that done to
[02:21:56] me uh before when I started I'm like
[02:21:57] wait that's a mutant that's this type of
[02:21:59] one it doesn't matter it's a zombie
[02:22:00] mutant and because it's a zombie or no
[02:22:02] it's a zombie um it like a zombie
[02:22:05] vampire or something but because it was
[02:22:06] a zombie they were able to pull it out
[02:22:07] I'm like you kidding me but then I now I
[02:22:10] learned the rule that's what it is at
[02:22:12] least I that's what I was told when I
[02:22:14] was playing at my local game store when
[02:22:17] I had ran into a similar
[02:22:19] situation so maybe hopefully that helps

[02:50:05] looking up the looking these up to see
[02:50:07] what they are if they're graded or
[02:50:08] anything like that so I want to see if
[02:50:10] there's anything like these ones that
[02:50:11] are here we go house put that there
[02:50:14] thank you click clack very
[02:50:17] much dude Comm here Masters is awesome
[02:50:20] I'm trying to get some more Commander
[02:50:21] Masters collector boosters uh the people
[02:50:23] that I get it from um they're pretty
[02:50:25] good with it and I'm just waiting for uh
[02:50:27] the the the distributor to get back to
[02:50:29] me they said they've been uh running a
[02:50:30] little short on supply of things so
[02:50:33] hopefully that means I can get some
[02:50:34] still that would be very frustrating if
[02:50:36] I can't because they said they had a ton
[02:50:38] of them before I'm going to put that up
[02:50:40] with no one's been going with these I
[02:50:42] don't know why maybe no one wants any of
[02:50:44] the um nobody wants to try to get a uh
[02:50:46] doubling season maybe that's what it is
[02:50:48] they are wicked expensive they are
[02:50:51] wicked expensive hey house I don't mind
[02:50:53] you doing that it's actually kind of
[02:50:55] cool but I'm trying to get them as
[02:50:57] that's why I'm trying to get them from
[02:50:58] this place because they are not as
[02:50:59] expensive um as they had been everywhere
[02:51:01] else when you're trying to buy online on
[02:51:03] different ones it's just ridiculous I
[02:51:05] just can't afford some of those I'm like
[02:51:06] I think it's stupid I'm not going to
[02:51:07] sell them like I have a hard time
[02:51:09] selling the fall the Lord of the Rings
[02:51:10] ones because of how expensive they were
[02:51:12] but I know they're going to end up going
[02:51:13] up so I just was like you know what I'll
[02:51:15] I can sit on those for a little bit at
[02:51:17] least
[02:51:19] we're going to put this stuff up here
[02:51:20] for this if you want it I'm going to do
[02:51:23] a little minute and a half that way I
[02:51:25] can find this one here let me
[02:51:40] see that was one of
[02:51:47] them
[02:51:49] the other
[02:52:07] one that's just
[02:52:16] one all right so
[02:52:19] these are all like the special ones that
[02:52:21] I kind of thought were interesting that
[02:52:22] I put off to the side there's a couple
[02:52:25] of them that I'm going to have to
[02:52:26] do without I'm I'm not going to do them
[02:52:30] for in this show I might do them in that
[02:52:33] special show that I was talking
[02:52:35] about because these are like the
[02:52:38] individuals that I
[02:52:40] have and they don't have them these are
[02:52:43] going to be like the individual ones
[02:52:44] that come
[02:52:46] out that are special
[02:52:49] so I didn't have many of these they only
[02:52:51] came as one of each one of each of these
[02:52:53] came
[02:52:55] out so let's see what we got here I
[02:52:57] think those are the one the ones that
[02:52:59] were the
[02:53:01] individuals that one that one that one
[02:53:04] here we
[02:53:04] go here you
[02:53:06] go these are the ones that I thought
[02:53:08] were cool I put off the
[02:53:12] side to uh see if they were anything
[02:53:17] special at some point
[02:53:21] all right I'm sorry I'm taking a minute
[02:53:23] here there you go because I have a lot
[02:53:25] actually because I have like there's
[02:53:27] like 300 different cards that I have uh
[02:53:30] different stuff that I have
[02:53:33] here but these are the ones that I
[02:53:35] thought were special ones that I was
[02:53:37] going to do like a because there was
[02:53:39] only like two of them or one of each of
[02:53:41] these that came out so I considered them
[02:53:44] special at least we'll say that I
[02:53:47] considered them special
[02:53:49] special and I wanted to do a special
[02:53:51] show there's a lot of them here so give
[02:53:53] me one second there's a lot of them here

[02:55:07] price but generally I do not buy um
[02:55:11] individual packs or or I'll go buy

[03:09:15] and some foil lands from um out here
[03:09:18] little land giveaway get that up there
[03:09:22] syringe manufacturing all right I
[03:09:24] thought I remembered you had something
[03:09:24] to do with medical stuff because you had
[03:09:26] made a comment about it my wife was a
[03:09:28] nurse and I remember I literally
[03:09:30] specifically
[03:09:31] remember that because of her being a
[03:09:34] nurse all right we're going to put these
[03:09:36] away remember everybody please Jump On
[03:09:38] In play the games it helps us out or
[03:09:39] just buy some packs we don't need to
[03:09:41] play a game we can just rip some packs
[03:09:42] open I have no problem doing that either
[03:09:45] and you can always um add a bunch of
[03:09:47] things there that's our amount what we
[03:09:48] have that is the cost of all of our
[03:09:50] packs but one of the things we do do do
[03:09:53] do my kids are going to laugh is
[03:09:55] whenever um you get multiple packs
[03:09:56] together we take a discount off because
[03:09:58] it helps me with whatnot fees that I
[03:10:00] don't need to pay about bunch of whatnot
[03:10:01] fees so I take a little bit of discount
[03:10:03] off when you buy multiple things at
[03:10:05] once so I think what we're going to do
[03:10:08] here is we're going to put
[03:10:11] up this here I don't have any more
[03:10:13] dungeons coming until next week but I
[03:10:17] think I have two more boxes of those
[03:10:18] coming in so let's do some dungeons here

[03:15:12] short um I had some medical issues uh
[03:15:17] where I almost died a couple years ago
[03:15:19] um and I was in the hospital for a while
[03:15:22] and I had to go to Jacksonville to Mayo
[03:15:24] Clinic regularly um to get some stuff
[03:15:26] figured out they had to cut some stuff
[03:15:27] out of me um luckily I'm alive I
[03:15:30] actually was in the hospital
[03:15:32] for had about six blood

[03:15:37] getting iron
[03:15:39] infusions um I had I was in the hospital
[03:15:41] probably about total about about a month
[03:15:44] over that year but uh anyways long story
[03:15:47] short um I drove past there uh the last
[03:15:50] time I'm like wait a minute that's where
[03:15:53] he is and I was like that's just
[03:15:55] freaking Wicked close to
[03:15:57] me dude
[03:16:00] exactly I know exactly that's what I
[03:16:02] saying I drive him by and I want to go
[03:16:04] to one of his stores because it's right
[03:16:05] in the area I'm like I drove by and my
[03:16:07] son has so swim stuff sometimes up there
[03:16:09] and I was like I need to stop over and
[03:16:10] it was just that one time I recognized
[03:16:12] it and I was just I was going to medic a
[03:16:13] doctor thing so I couldn't go to it but
[03:16:15] uh yeah I'm just going to say this for
[03:16:17] all you people here I know it's going to
[03:16:19] sound gross but get your
[03:16:21] colonoscopy crazy Tyrant you came out
[03:16:24] here with the
[03:16:30] landwin thank you thank you I appreciate
[03:16:32] that but I'm going to just I know it
[03:16:34] sounds gross but do get your colonoscopy
[03:16:36] everybody because if I uh I almost
[03:16:41] died because of what was found and being
[03:16:44] ignored by other people doctors
[03:16:47] when I told doctors uh put it this way
[03:16:50] moving to Florida all right I'm going to
[03:16:51] go into a little bit of a long story
[03:16:52] time while I do stuff I moved to Florida
[03:16:55] about three a little over three years
[03:16:57] ago quite frankly moving to Florida
[03:17:00] Saved My Life um I lived in New
[03:17:02] Hampshire I used and I was having this
[03:17:04] weird issue um I got I think I actually
[03:17:07] had covid um before covid was diagnosed
[03:17:11] in the United States cuz then January
[03:17:13] 2021 I had some weird cold where I was
[03:17:17] coughing so hard I passed out twice in
[03:17:19] my bathroom like
[03:17:22] Timber my wife heard me came out
[03:17:25] obviously came over to help um second
[03:17:28] time that I passed out um I obviously I
[03:17:31] was okay but afterwards I talked to my
[03:17:33] doctor and the doctor was like you
[03:17:34] should have been coming to the hospital
[03:17:35] right away if you ever pass out you come
[03:17:38] to the hospital so I went over and had
[03:17:41] some doctor appointments they couldn't
[03:17:42] figure anything out they kept telling me
[03:17:43] Oh it's asthma I'm like well I'm getting
[03:17:45] a lot of blood all of a sudden out of I
[03:17:47] in in the bathroom it's I told you a
[03:17:48] little bit of a gross story here yeah
[03:17:51] when I go to the bathroom I've been
[03:17:52] getting a lot of blood that seems to be
[03:17:53] something abnormal and they're like well
[03:17:54] how much and I told him a little bit and
[03:17:56] I told there like color blah BL blah and
[03:17:57] I told color like oh that that's fine it
[03:17:59] just means you have a tear somewhere I'm
[03:18:01] like well it doesn't seem right uh but
[03:18:04] okay if that's what you say why not I
[03:18:06] have a tear
[03:18:08] somewhere and I went with what they said
[03:18:11] ignored everything else
[03:18:14] um and then I kept getting sicker and
[03:18:17] sicker and sicker why is this not
[03:18:19] showing and as I got sicker the um they
[03:18:23] kept ignoring it I ended up in the
[03:18:25] hospital one time because my um my
[03:18:27] hemoglobin got down a little bit below
[03:18:29] uh 10 and they told me when I was in the
[03:18:31] hospital like oh that's fine um women go
[03:18:33] down below 10 all the time I'm like yeah
[03:18:35] but I'm not a woman I'm a man um and
[03:18:38] yeah I understand like women can go down
[03:18:40] because they bleed but a man doesn't so
[03:18:42] this is a little something different
[03:18:43] here so I'm going to put a Celestial
[03:18:45] colonate up from Doctor Who
[03:18:48] there and they uh ended up finding
[03:18:51] ignoring it all for about a about a year
[03:18:53] up in New England um I moved down to
[03:18:56] Florida and uh on the drive down I
[03:18:59] almost passed out a couple of times I
[03:19:01] had to pull over more than once but on
[03:19:03] the move down to Florida we got down
[03:19:04] here I ended up having to get a new
[03:19:06] doctor because I had to get a new doctor
[03:19:08] they ran some tests like normal tests
[03:19:11] and I'm sitting there at the
[03:19:13] beach dude exactly no it's fine don't
[03:19:16] worry about it I'm sitting at the beach
[03:19:18] and um like I'm feeling tired as all
[03:19:20] hell like I normally have been feeling
[03:19:22] that's what I've been feeling for the
[03:19:23] past few months and they told me it's
[03:19:25] okay so I'm hanging out at a beach there
[03:19:27] with my family like literally weekend
[03:19:30] before I start a new job the new job
[03:19:32] that I have now literally the weekend
[03:19:34] before I start my new job I'm hanging
[03:19:36] out at the beach with some family
[03:19:37] members and I get a call from the doctor
[03:19:39] on Friday that Friday that I went over
[03:19:41] because I went over to the doctor on
[03:19:42] Friday to get some blood tests done he
[03:19:44] calls me on Friday and goes hey you need
[03:19:46] to go to the hospital right now I'm like
[03:19:48] what are you talking about like go to
[03:19:49] the hospital now I'm like uh okay like
[03:19:51] that sounds a little weird um he goes if
[03:19:54] you don't see I'm like I'm at the beach
[03:19:55] right now I'm like I can't I I have to
[03:19:57] drive over the hospital he goes well if
[03:19:58] you can't get to a hospital find a
[03:20:00] doctor on the beach because you're going
[03:20:01] to die like
[03:20:06] what he literally said that on the phone
[03:20:08] he called me after the blood test
[03:20:09] results came in I ended up driving over
[03:20:12] the hospital I was tired I didn't think
[03:20:13] anything of it I'd been tired for
[03:20:15] weeks dude exactly I've been tired for
[03:20:18] weeks it had nothing out of the ordinary
[03:20:20] I thought this was normal months of
[03:20:22] tiredness like the doctors all the other
[03:20:24] doctors like oh you're fine it's just
[03:20:25] because you're asthma you're tired like
[03:20:27] all right it doesn't seem right but
[03:20:28] whatever so I'm still doing my and I go
[03:20:30] over to the hospital I go into the
[03:20:32] hospital I [ __ ] you not the doctor had
[03:20:34] to have called the hospital because I go
[03:20:36] to the hospital I go hey my name is
[03:20:37] James I'm in the hospital I'm at the ER
[03:20:39] there was four doctors and five uh
[03:20:43] nurses came out with a stretcher I was
[03:20:46] in an y I was getting test done I was
[03:20:48] having CT scans all kinds of stuff
[03:20:50] trying to figure out what was going on
[03:20:51] they ended up coming out and one of the
[03:20:53] doctors was like hey um we found some
[03:20:55] lumps we found them here this is what's
[03:20:57] going on your hemoglobin is at uh uh 4.1
[03:21:02] right now so if you fall asleep your
[03:21:04] heart is probably going to stop like oh
[03:21:07] okay and then they did another
[03:21:08] hemoglobin test and my hemoglobin was at
[03:21:10] 3.7 and they're like we're giving you um
[03:21:13] blood right now cuz it's supposed to be
[03:21:15] at 15 and so I got some transfusions and
[03:21:18] uh luckily I felt like a million bucks
[03:21:21] after that because you know they gave me
[03:21:22] some fresh
[03:21:23] blood and I it was insane like if it if
[03:21:27] I didn't move to Florida and then after
[03:21:28] moving to Florida they figured it out I
[03:21:29] have another doctor they figured out
[03:21:31] what was wrong they cut out the problems
[03:21:33] I'm not bleeding anymore except the
[03:21:35] doctor at the Mayo Clinic made a [ __ ] up
[03:21:37] and they stitched the inside of me to
[03:21:38] the outside of me so um now if I sit
[03:21:41] down for an extended period of time my
[03:21:43] leg goes numb with pain because I have a
[03:21:45] nerve that I uh that they they Stitch
[03:21:47] through so um I um I'm in the process of
[03:21:50] talking to a lawyer about that one
[03:21:52] because I have not been able to sit down
[03:21:53] comfortably for um about a year and a
[03:21:56] half almost two years now I can't sit on
[03:21:58] a on a bike at all because of the way
[03:22:01] the seats are there's no way I can sit
[03:22:03] on a
[03:22:05] bike so like I don't know that was
[03:22:07] that's my [ __ ] story
[03:22:14] there dude I know
[03:22:17] oh yeah the surgeon messed up so uh yeah
[03:22:19] that surgeon messed up big time yeah are
[03:22:21] you thinking in New England they're
[03:22:22] going to be the best doctors in the
[03:22:24] world supposedly that came to me to the
[03:22:26] point that and I've been saying this
[03:22:27] because I have seizures and I've met a
[03:22:28] few different doctors in New England and
[03:22:30] one of the things that I will say about
[03:22:32] the doctors in New England and is they
[03:22:34] are very very very book smart they're
[03:22:39] [ __ ] in dumb as [ __ ] when it comes to
[03:22:42] Common Sense every one of them very book
[03:22:44] smart smartest people in the world when
[03:22:46] it comes to books smarts but if it's
[03:22:48] going to have anything to do with common
[03:22:50] sense they're a [ __ ]
[03:22:52] idiot like I'm like seriously like the
[03:22:56] one doctor that was there when um I was
[03:22:57] in the hospital at Beth Israel getting
[03:22:59] tested for seizures at one point he was
[03:23:01] a fellow he was like just starting and
[03:23:03] he had to point out to one of the
[03:23:04] doctors that was there that had been
[03:23:06] there for years like this is what is
[03:23:07] showing the test you should check this
[03:23:09] like oh yeah that's something we're
[03:23:10] checking I'm like oh my [ __ ] god man
[03:23:13] like how stupid I'm sorry for swearing
[03:23:15] right now I got a little bit off top
[03:23:17] here but here's your here's your stuff
[03:23:19] there for three strength and the Wast an
[03:23:23] adventure so I don't know but they're
[03:23:25] very nice I lived in New England for
[03:23:26] years my wife was a nurse up there and
[03:23:28] she even said the same thing they're
[03:23:29] very smart very very smart they're just
[03:23:32] they don't always their common sense is
[03:23:33] not always there some of them are they
[03:23:36] used to be when I was younger I had a
[03:23:37] really good doctor for the seizures then
[03:23:39] figured everything out got me taken care
[03:23:41] of but then afterwards it was just like
[03:23:42] yeah we don't care
[03:23:45] anymore
[03:23:47] dude exactly and I moved down to Florida
[03:23:49] and they became like more of a holistic
[03:23:51] type doctor and I think that's literally
[03:23:53] what saved my life is they thought of
[03:23:55] everything not just one thing they
[03:23:57] looked at everything as a
[03:24:03] problem yeah so I don't know whatever
[03:24:06] I'm here and I'm alive now and that's
[03:24:08] all that matters we're going to do this
[03:24:11] here let's see about putting up another
[03:24:14] uh maybe we'll put out something up from

[03:35:33] you go wandering around this Wasteland
[03:35:35] with two strength you have 10 bosses
[03:35:38] you're only going to be able to bounce
[03:35:39] off the boss two of them because sadly
[03:35:41] you do not have enough strength to beat
[03:35:43] but you got to choose between one and 10
[03:35:45] where would you like to go
[03:35:47] RX and we can see what boss you go up
[03:35:50] against 1 two 3 I guess I was going to
[03:35:52] guess three but as you wander through
[03:35:55] the Wasteland you see a vault in the
[03:35:56] distance you go towards that Vault and
[03:35:58] you see oh no out in the distance out
[03:36:01] comes Owen wandering by on his
[03:36:05] motorcycle and he comes up to you trying
[03:36:07] to steal stuff from you but because you
[03:36:09] have same strength you're able to punch
[03:36:11] him and wander away towards that
[03:36:14] Wasteland uh toward wards that Vault and
[03:36:16] as you get into that Vault you see in
[03:36:18] the distance you're in your health
[03:36:20] you're okay you're not you're not sick
[03:36:21] and H and having any problems you go
[03:36:23] over and you see a uh a a little safe in
[03:36:26] the distance and in that safe you go and
[03:36:29] you pull out a pack of cards and that

[04:17:56] red we are looking as a technician
[04:17:58] hopefully we're going to find some
[04:17:59] treasure as we go through this adventure
[04:18:03] and we do they find some treasure the
[04:18:06] technician goes digging through they
[04:18:07] find some treasure they're like
[04:18:08] wonderful I can use this to help gain
[04:18:11] some strength and some added and stop to
[04:18:13] build on myself one this is now five six
[04:18:18] strength four five strength as you go
[04:18:20] through the Wasteland here now is it 13
[04:18:23] for the other
[04:18:24] ones here you did say 13 I'm guessing
[04:18:27] you meant 13 for all of them because you
[04:18:29] haven't said anything all right 1 2 3 4
[04:18:32] 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 there you go in
[04:18:36] the blue one only has 12 so you going
[04:18:38] have to CH choose uh for there as you go
[04:18:40] through here you're in the wondering in
[04:18:41] the Wasteland here technician you got
[04:18:43] your treasure you're hopefully going to
[04:18:45] find a friend along the way and this
[04:18:47] technician ends up finding a copy which
[04:18:51] is wonderful because that item comes
[04:18:54] over they they copy that item they see
[04:18:57] it in the ground they get pick it up and
[04:18:59] they're able to now copy their treasure
[04:19:01] to be at six strength as you wander
[04:19:04] through this Wasteland on an adventure
[04:19:06] that is wonderful for the detective now
[04:19:09] Gins you have 12 here you did say 13 so
[04:19:11] I'm going to just do the last one unless
[04:19:13] you tell me a different
[04:19:14] number lucky number 13 well there's only
[04:19:16] 12 cards here so I can do like the first
[04:19:18] card if that's what you want me to go
[04:19:20] through number 11 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
[04:19:25] 11 I know lucky number 13 I feel like I
[04:19:28] should put 13 cards in here just that
[04:19:29] reason all right Gins let's see what we
[04:19:32] get we're looking for as a detective you
[04:19:35] want your friend Thro there to come and
[04:19:36] help you along the way but oh no the
[04:19:39] fungus dinosaur comes out you get scared
[04:19:42] you drop your copy but luckily that cop
[04:19:45] that dinosaur takes that copy of the
[04:19:47] treasure and un shiny thing goes and
[04:19:50] ignores you so you can now get away with
[04:19:52] your five strength here which is very
[04:19:55] good because you have a good chance to
[04:19:56] beat any of the um three or four three
[04:19:59] of these 10 bosses you could beat now
[04:20:02] there are 10 which one do you want to go
[04:20:04] up against skins we're going to do this
[04:20:07] quickly here
[04:20:10] number sorry little frog my
[04:20:13] throat number three one two three you
[04:20:17] see a vault in the distance you're going
[04:20:19] towards that vault as a technician but
[04:20:20] out in front of you jumps the flare of
[04:20:24] loyalties oh
[04:20:25] no comes out of the comes out of the
[04:20:28] ground grabs you throws you around a
[04:20:30] little bit but as he grabs you tossing
[04:20:32] you around with his big he destroys half
[04:20:35] of this Wasteland because he's so big
[04:20:37] and destructive tossing you around but
[04:20:40] luckily they throw you right next to the
[04:20:42] vault and when you get to that Vault you
[04:20:44] go wandering into that Vault and in that
[04:20:46] Vault you see this pack of cards from I
[04:20:48] think I said it was 93 1993 here and in
[04:20:52] that pack of that Vault that pack of
[04:20:54] cards is the
[04:20:58] Valiant the Valiant if you want anything
[04:21:01] like that we'll open those up we can rip
[04:21:04] all these open for you or we can um ship
[04:21:06] them whatever you would like generally
[04:21:07] we have them ripped open for you but uh
[04:21:10] I like to double check with people and I
[04:21:12] think we're going to do a Loot drop
[04:21:14] because uh this seems like a Loot drop
[04:21:16] scenario this seems like a Loot drop
[04:21:18] scenario with how much strength you had
[04:21:21] and what occurred there we're going to
[04:21:23] rip them all you know what I think we're
[04:21:25] going to do another Loot drop and I like
[04:21:26] the ioria but I think instead this time
[04:21:29] we're going to do it for
[04:21:33] um we're going to do
[04:21:35] this the flare
[04:21:38] loyalties destroyed part of uh the the
[04:21:42] wastelands here even though you lost the
[04:21:45] flare loyalty is destroyed part of the
[04:21:47] Wasteland and dropped and due to that
[04:21:50] out of one of the buildings some loot
[04:21:52] fell not anything big but something that
[04:21:54] maybe some of you would want and we're
[04:21:55] going to rip this open we're going to
[04:21:57] give it a couple minutes while I uh rip
[04:22:00] these open for our friend here all right

[04:34:13] I'm sorry sorry guys you're a little
[04:34:15] distracted there how many people tried
[04:34:18] the red button so we've had I'm I'm I
[04:34:20] think I'm down to like 1,200 out of the,
[04:34:22] 1600 cards there's been a bunch of
[04:34:24] people that have tried it we've got a
[04:34:25] bunch of different packs of cards out we
[04:34:27] have not hit the Big C hit of The Lord
[04:34:29] of the Rings collector box um I've added
[04:34:32] actually added more packs in there
[04:34:33] because the other day had some people we
[04:34:35] had like five people pull out and
[04:34:36] nothing was hit out of it and I was like
[04:34:38] I don't like this so I ended up adding
[04:34:40] some more um more stuff into it into the
[04:34:43] red button there and so it does have
[04:34:45] some extra packs in there um so we've
[04:34:47] had I don't know that's that's hard to
[04:34:49] for me to say what is in there because I
[04:34:52] added I probably added 10 packs in there
[04:34:54] cuz I did not like how no one was
[04:34:56] pulling stuff out it was one of those
[04:34:58] ones that I just don't like the Box
[04:35:00] personally but people asked for it so I
[04:35:01] built
[04:35:02] it but it is there you want to try it I

[05:06:26] out with us today had a lot of fun jay
[05:06:28] poker from coming in um so we've been
[05:06:31] doing having a good time having a little
[05:06:33] bit fun
[05:06:38] here
[05:06:41] oh
[05:06:45] sweet hey don't I I have no problem I I
[05:06:48] like when people come and hang out
[05:06:50] personally because it helps chatting
[05:06:52] with the with the community of people
[05:06:53] here because it helps me to be able to
[05:06:55] have more to do rather than like talking
[05:06:57] to myself like a random dude just
[05:07:00] talking to
[05:07:01] themselves oh two weeks what kind of
[05:07:03] puppy see here's my puppy over there hey
[05:07:06] Bones that's my puppy right there
[05:07:10] oh he's walking
[05:07:12] away he I don't care about
[05:07:17] you what kind of puppy I got we got our
[05:07:21] last one was a um a rescue dog that we
[05:07:23] got he was um uh uh lab but we didn't
[05:07:27] know what what what he was we're
[05:07:28] guessing he was a um a pit pull because
[05:07:30] he chewed through chain link fence like
[05:07:32] four
[05:07:33] times so that was why we expected him to
[05:07:35] be a pull so let's do this here I'm I'm
[05:07:39] going to put the up here we're going to
[05:07:41] do
[05:07:43] um we're going to do
[05:07:46] this for strength on the
[05:07:53] adventure we going to call this one
[05:07:56] before we
[05:07:58] go s a little lower than normal there
[05:08:01] we're call that four
[05:08:05] strength oh cool
[05:08:08] chaha
[05:08:12] oh cool like we can't afford to do this
[05:08:13] regularly and then uh he found a way
[05:08:15] helped us find a way to do this and we
[05:08:16] started doing this and a lot of times I
[05:08:18] do it in the morning before work or um
[05:08:20] I'll do it with the kids like but right
[05:08:22] now they're just not helping me for
[05:08:23] whatever reason I guess they want to
[05:08:24] play on their tablets and I just try not
[05:08:27] to push them every time because I don't
[05:08:28] want to like make them feel like they
[05:08:29] need to do stuff but at the same time I
[05:08:31] have told them if they do things to help
[05:08:34] I will pay them so it's their choice on
[05:08:37] what goes on how they work here here so
[05:08:40] it's part of cuz when I was growing up
[05:08:41] my dad had a
[05:08:42] boat um oh she and then he was a
[05:08:46] fisherman so he had his own boat and um
[05:08:48] I never was forced to help but he would
[05:08:50] always ask if I would want to go and
[05:08:51] help and I'd always you know mean my dad
[05:08:54] I'd always want to go and help him so
[05:08:55] I'd go down I'd help him on the boat
[05:08:56] doing whatever so I I don't always I
[05:08:59] don't like to force him because
[05:09:00] sometimes I would be like no Dad I can't
[05:09:01] go today because I was doing something
[05:09:02] with some friends or something like that
[05:09:04] so that's why I like kind of try to do
[05:09:06] the same thing for my
[05:09:08] kids I don't like force them but I like
[05:09:10] to ask them if they want to participate
[05:09:12] especially since it's something a little
[05:09:14] fun that they can participate in you
[05:09:16] know all right I'm going to put this up
[05:09:18] here for our last one
[05:09:22] here and I'm going to put a really good
[05:09:24] deal on I think for
[05:09:29] these no no that's not
[05:09:34] right we're going to call this that's
[05:09:36] pretty good deal on those ones we're
[05:09:37] going to put that on there
[05:09:39] for this all right and I'm going to get

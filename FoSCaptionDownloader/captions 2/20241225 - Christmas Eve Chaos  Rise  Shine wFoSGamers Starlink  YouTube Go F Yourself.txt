[00:44:47] though let's try that
[00:44:50] again correct that maybe
[00:44:57] let's
[00:45:03] see you got to be kidding me stuff
[00:45:05] technology doesn't want to work always
[00:45:07] but we get we'll get through it good
[00:45:08] morning n Nate Nate Nate how's it
[00:45:14] going oh we have we have some others
[00:45:17] that could play yeah yeah we have some
[00:45:18] others I just need to highlight who's
[00:45:20] playing highlight that one in um
[00:45:27] I can get
[00:45:29] it
[00:45:30] what yeah we'll figure out who's playing
[00:45:33] there come on why is my stuff not
[00:45:36] working today well it's one of those
[00:45:39] things it's just you know got to be that
[00:45:40] way right
[00:45:42] I so instead we'll do it from
[00:45:45] here so we got to get
[00:45:47] ready we're doing a game here and see
[00:45:50] what
[00:45:54] happens we'll put some uh background
[00:45:57] Vision on
[00:46:03] instead put this in
[00:46:13] there I'm so good I'm so good I'm so
[00:46:19] good there you
[00:46:22] go see if we get that there
[00:46:28] no go
[00:46:34] sources do this we're going do that ha
[00:46:38] there's throw some view out there while
[00:46:39] we
[00:46:40] wait Last
[00:46:43] Chance two spots so we have hey wer
[00:46:46] how's it going my friend so we have um
[00:46:51] Nico spicy Miss Nico and uh lukee are in
[00:46:58] here playing with us no
[00:47:03] not me not not too bad not too bad we're
[00:47:06] uh hanging out where we are on our now
[00:47:09] on the boat here doing our
[00:47:12] thing for some reason technology does
[00:47:15] not want to play nicely with me
[00:47:17] today well I don't think anything wants
[00:47:19] to play nicely with me today
[00:47:28] cuz for some reason is trying to connect
[00:47:29] to something it say it won't boys are
[00:47:32] you you're not connected to anything
[00:47:33] right interesting why is it doing that
[00:47:39] H well that's all
[00:47:42] right we'll see what
[00:47:47] happens hopefully it'll work better but
[00:47:49] we're waiting on uh do we have everyone
[00:47:51] all right I guess we'll begin all right
[00:47:53] so you guys wherever you want to go now
[00:47:55] you put all your weapons you did put
[00:47:58] someone's trying to hijack my signal no
[00:47:59] it's just trying to connect to the
[00:48:01] uh my stream deck won't connect for some
[00:48:04] reason to the computer for
[00:48:08] me so I'm going to
[00:48:12] try something here see if restarting the
[00:48:15] stream deck will
[00:48:23] work which it's just what I use to um
[00:48:26] change everything on
[00:48:29] screen and for whatever reason it
[00:48:31] doesn't want to work right
[00:48:46] now that's what my problem is that's all
[00:48:49] trying to get to work
[00:48:59] I think I might have figured it out
[00:49:01] though
[00:49:09] maybe now that I have that I'm
[00:49:16] so ah I suspect I know what
[00:49:24] happened it's probably a software update
[00:49:26] for this
[00:49:28] too looks like there's a software update
[00:49:31] and that's what's stopping me from doing
[00:49:33] anything so give me one second here so I
[00:49:36] can update the I hate when that doesn't
[00:49:38] like I've been using that for a while
[00:49:39] and it doesn't tell you now it tells you
[00:49:40] like at the end
[00:49:56] no maybe not might have
[00:50:05] lied
[00:50:10] right one second here to try to see if I
[00:50:13] can get it to
[00:50:23] work that is really annoying as mother
[00:50:26] ah
[00:50:29] whatever anyways we'll go on and figure
[00:50:32] it out a different way I guess that's
[00:50:33] all I'm used to doing is breaking stuff
[00:50:35] and dealing with [ __ ] so let's get it
[00:50:37] going

[00:52:11] might you might like those we have a a
[00:52:12] handful of those I got probably five
[00:52:14] could give you for a plasma

[00:52:20] wants some health and some bullets so
[00:52:22] Luke you have
[00:52:24] um 58 pogs so you can bu a good chunk
[00:52:27] you'll take that trade all right you
[00:52:29] give them Miss Nico goes all right here

[00:52:53] moment no C4 Teddy be teddy bears at the
[00:52:56] moment

[00:53:46] that's five for a health of 20 two
[00:53:49] health and 15
[00:53:53] bullets uh all right 15 so that would be
[00:53:56] H let's do some math

[01:01:15] we're going to head on there are we done
[01:01:17] what do you have a you ready to go all

[01:01:25] [Music]
[01:01:30] all right Luke you
[01:01:38] good ready to take on whatever
[01:01:42] awaits all right here we
[01:01:44] go all right so you
[01:01:49] guys go and wander around you see that
[01:01:52] computer room again you come back out
[01:01:54] you go around that computer room again
[01:01:55] you're like oh I like this computer room
[01:01:56] this is not bad you think it's a good
[01:01:58] area you had some
[01:01:59] luck and
[01:02:01] then you happen to wander around and
[01:02:06] should you're going to bump into
[01:02:07] something will we bump into your buddy
[01:02:09] now or
[01:02:11] wait the one you're talking the one that
[01:02:13] you made I know should we skip on to our
[01:02:15] next right right or
[01:02:17] over bump into him you going to bump
[01:02:19] into him yeah but going it did something
[01:02:21] happen that they don't want no they
[01:02:23] don't okay later or now later when they
[01:02:27] need it whenever they they can use it
[01:02:28] whenever they need it they okay that's
[01:02:29] what I thought you said right ready all
[01:02:31] right we got a friend that will thought
[01:02:33] of you going through that computer room
[01:02:34] you saw something sound familiar down in
[01:02:36] the corner you heard some weird noises
[01:02:37] you decid to go and take a turn around
[01:02:39] the corner there and as you go you see
[01:02:42] something as you're wandering over there
[01:02:43] there is a little something on the
[01:02:44] display talking to you it's Kronos the
[01:02:48] got a time yeah Kronos tells you he has
[01:02:52] uh the ability to help rewind time and
[01:02:55] go back back one entire encounter to
[01:02:59] start it
[01:03:01] again all right so if you do not like
[01:03:05] what happens with an
[01:03:06] encounter you get to rewind and try it
[01:03:12] over so that was your person you bumped
[01:03:17] into will thought that was a good idea
[01:03:19] Chronos was going to be a helper for you
[01:03:21] guys come around there so you just need
[01:03:23] to call on Kronos whenever you need say
[01:03:26] you're dying in battle and you feel like
[01:03:27] you need to start over you're right at
[01:03:30] the end and you can't make it like y
[01:03:31] Kronos what call them call on Kronos and
[01:03:34] he'll rewind time for you
[01:03:38] there as you
[01:03:43] see I have a handy helper there you
[01:03:48] go is she miss Nico said that was a good
[01:03:51] job
[01:03:52] will all right so now as you got
[01:03:55] continue to wander on you a sweet now
[01:03:57] you got some help there you turn around
[01:03:58] you go around you hear some noise some

[01:04:28] background weird weird sounds not really
[01:04:32] understanding what it
[01:04:33] is
[01:04:39] but all of a
[01:04:41] sudden like you start wandering out of
[01:04:44] that room again and come back out of
[01:04:45] that computer
[01:04:47] Hall going back Kronos that was a good
[01:04:49] deal there I like that and then you turn
[01:04:51] around you hear something there again
[01:04:53] you go ring down a different hallway

[01:08:00] he's streaming telling his guys his
[01:08:02] little ows to run towards you and you
[01:08:04] just go I don't think so
[01:08:06] Santa and you

[01:08:12] with
[01:08:13] that Nico you got some luck my
[01:08:17] friend all right let's see the plus cuz
[01:08:20] this is a uh this is a multiplier all
[01:08:22] right that's a multiplier on your damage
[01:08:25] see what your multiplier
[01:08:27] is oh Nico it's a Christmas miracle I
[01:08:30] guess you got a four you got four is
[01:08:33] your
[01:08:35] multiplier with a sniper
[01:08:38] rifle I can go oh my oh my God look at
[01:08:42] that all right let's do it let's see
[01:08:44] what it goes out to
[01:08:47] be oh wow that that no Immortal all
[01:08:53] right
[01:08:59] that
[01:09:01] seriously you just knocked Santa down to
[01:09:04] 28 Health that was 18 * 4 with your
[01:09:06] sniper rifle there because that was a
[01:09:10] multiplier um all right well well
[01:09:13] Santa's uh crying currently on the
[01:09:16] ground as he's going hit with that one
[01:09:20] and um screaming over there in his
[01:09:22] chair and our friend and Miss ni decides
[01:09:28] to run in with the sword now miss n you
[01:09:34] have oh you come with the sword and oh
[01:09:37] look at that I think you have the
[01:09:38] strength there plus the sword gives you
[01:09:40] a seven I think you have another
[01:09:42] strength too Miss Nico if I remember
[01:09:44] right I think you have two strength you
[01:09:45] do have two strength that gives you more
[01:09:49] than enough to hit our friend there with
[01:09:52] your
[01:09:52] sword and in the process of that
[01:09:58] now he screeches bringing him
[01:10:01] down
[01:10:07] to 18 Health but he sends
[01:10:10] out four
[01:10:14] minions all right those minions charge
[01:10:16] at you all I know Luke has a good luck
[01:10:20] here and as a charge Luke do you want to
[01:10:23] shoot the minions or do you want to go
[01:10:24] after the main guy it's your
[01:10:28] choice they got four minions charging
[01:10:31] right now they're all five Health
[01:10:33] remember five
[01:10:34] health so you got to decide what are you
[01:10:37] going to do here everybody are you going
[01:10:39] to run you going to run away going to
[01:10:42] after our minions all right so the
[01:10:44] minions are are tend to hit are higher
[01:10:46] now you have the three I think you have
[01:10:48] actually a couple extras so you going to
[01:10:49] have a good chance to end it so Luke
[01:10:51] here you go oh my God Luke buddy
[01:10:56] um I can't help you
[01:10:58] there
[01:11:04] Luke I'm sorry Luke that was just a wild
[01:11:08] shot and because you wildly
[01:11:10] shot all those minions go running at
[01:11:15] you they all charge you Luke oh no Luke
[01:11:19] that brings you from 94
[01:11:22] Health down to 7 74 Health oh buddy oh
[01:11:28] buddy that's no
[01:11:30] good but spicy's going to chuse the
[01:11:33] flamethrower that's a plus six on Santa
[01:11:37] before Santa gets a chance out that's a
[01:11:39] plus six and then you I don't think you
[01:11:41] have any plus4 I don't think you have
[01:11:43] extra but let's check spicy cuz I think
[01:11:45] you may you have
[01:11:47] engineering and intelligence
[01:11:51] oh that's only eight more
[01:11:55] uh seven more there's only seven more
[01:11:57] you did not get them you missed you
[01:12:00] shoot your
[01:12:02] flamethrower and you miss but because of
[01:12:06] the rigged up canisters that you have a
[01:12:10] flamethrower
[01:12:12] ammo the issue that happened is it
[01:12:14] backfired a little bit on you you have
[01:12:16] to calibrate your gun a little bit here
[01:12:18] before you can shoot again I'm guessing
[01:12:19] luk our friend spicy cuz that one back
[01:12:22] shot backfired on you bringing you from
[01:12:25] 82 Health down to 59 Health that was a
[01:12:29] big that was a rough one buddy that was
[01:12:31] a rough
[01:12:34] one so miss Nico already went now we're
[01:12:38] going to have to have Santa's going to
[01:12:39] try here and Santa hits throwing out all
[01:12:42] of the the minions now the minions run
[01:12:45] out from Santa
[01:12:56] um it's just a game for today right now
[01:12:57] and some of the inventories there in the
[01:12:59] background I do have a little bit of
[01:13:00] stuff if you want to buy some I don't
[01:13:01] have everything so that's what uh that
[01:13:04] is why there is some stuff in the

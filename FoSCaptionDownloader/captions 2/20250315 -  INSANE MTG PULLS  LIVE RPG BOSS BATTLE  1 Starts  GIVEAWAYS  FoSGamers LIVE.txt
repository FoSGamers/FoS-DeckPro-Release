[00:38:50] there well thank you that's a good
[00:38:52] something while waiting for the break I
[00:38:54] will say that that's a good something
[00:38:57] while waiting for the break that's a
[00:38:58] good throwback to like like I said just
[00:38:59] a good throwback to uh good times when
[00:39:02] you were younger and
[00:39:05] uh fun sets and like you said if you get
[00:39:07] some of the big hits they're big
[00:39:10] hits so card holder card card did Lay
[00:39:14] the way we do the break is uh we have
[00:39:16] all the packs that you see here
[00:39:18] everything gets open um even the secret
[00:39:20] layer since there's six spots there's
[00:39:22] six cards in the secret layer here all
[00:39:24] the secret layer get put in the sleeves
[00:39:26] they get shuffled up and handed up so
[00:39:27] everybody gets one of the secret layer I
[00:39:29] don't know which one we shuffle them up
[00:39:30] hand them out then we take all the
[00:39:32] mythics the rares and then he uncommon
[00:39:35] or common that is $3 or more from all
[00:39:38] the six packs here we put those into
[00:39:40] sleeves shuffle them up and hand them
[00:39:42] out it's kind of like a dealing hits
[00:39:43] type thing so uh we deal out the hits
[00:39:46] from there that are pretty much any
[00:39:48] Commons or uncommons that are $3 and
[00:39:50] more and any rares or mythics and then
[00:39:53] the Marvel Wolverine goes separate and
[00:39:56] then after that what we do is uh we do a
[00:39:59] little adventure thing so like I it's
[00:40:01] like a little thank you game we play do
[00:40:03] a little Adventure you guys were
[00:40:04] wandering around the city as an an
[00:40:06] adventurer here and you guys need to
[00:40:08] decide because you might be running up
[00:40:10] against a a boss of some kind who knows
[00:40:13] what you're going to come up
[00:40:14] against but it's a fun time every now
[00:40:18] and again when you get to uh when we go
[00:40:19] through these and like I said we're
[00:40:21] going to we'll definitely do it end up
[00:40:23] running it if uh whoever doesn't take a
[00:40:24] spot I might end up taking that last the
[00:40:27] last spot or two I'm hoping we can get
[00:40:29] one more person in here that way we can
[00:40:30] at least get uh you know
[00:40:33] get four people participating in our
[00:40:36] raid here going to see what's going on
[00:40:39] Dragon full the cards you'd be spot one
[00:40:40] whoever spot two would be to handed out
[00:40:42] you know in order and I kind of like do
[00:40:44] this snake around or whatever you want
[00:40:46] to call I think snakes yeah I think

[00:40:49] do with our break tonight just a quick
[00:40:51] one and a little bit of adventuring

[00:41:51] stinks that's okay I forgot to put a
[00:41:54] giveaway in so I'll throw one now
[00:41:59] yeah so it's kind of like a little u i
[00:42:01] little Adventure D and D thing we get to
[00:42:03] do some of the people liked it when we
[00:42:05] uh we played it one time a couple of
[00:42:07] times and then people kept gravitating
[00:42:09] towards it so I was like you know what
[00:42:11] let's do
[00:42:14] it let's make it more
[00:42:18] regular part of the
[00:42:21] thing yeah exactly kind of play uh
[00:42:23] you're playing Fallout while waiting for
[00:42:24] the break which is going to be a
[00:42:25] fallout-esque break look at
[00:42:30] that there we go we'll throw in a couple
[00:42:33] of those for our giveaway and you know
[00:42:36] what we'll run
[00:42:37] one I remember uh so what I've been
[00:42:40] trying to do here I was wondering if I
[00:42:42] could get this into I was looking into
[00:42:44] it I just don't have the time I want to
[00:42:46] take my uh game that I had made and
[00:42:48] either because the D and D game I have
[00:42:50] the I made a campaign I want to put it
[00:42:52] into uh I was debating on putting it
[00:42:54] into like a 2d game
[00:42:57] but going to take a little bit more time
[00:43:00] than I want to than I had to spend to do
[00:43:02] it and that's the problem time once I
[00:43:05] got the boat I was like I knew I'd be
[00:43:07] working on stuff but there's so much
[00:43:09] other things that end up popping up that
[00:43:10] I end up like a [Â __Â ] I don't have the
[00:43:11] time for that oh [Â __Â ] I don't have the
[00:43:12] time for
[00:43:13] that what what can you do though
[00:43:17] right this is what's in our break
[00:43:19] tonight we'll zoom in a little bit so
[00:43:22] you can see the Marvel
[00:43:24] Wolverine there we go

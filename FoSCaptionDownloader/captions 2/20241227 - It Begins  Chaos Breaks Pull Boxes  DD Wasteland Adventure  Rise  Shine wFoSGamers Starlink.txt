[00:02:24] bone so I got to go see a doctor
[00:02:30] yeah impressive I
[00:02:32] know
[00:02:35] yeah so there was was the story is uh we
[00:02:38] were getting ready to go to the uh
[00:02:40] Christmas Carnival here in St
[00:02:44] John's St Thomas in St Thomas we were
[00:02:48] going to the Christmas Carnival in St
[00:02:49] Thomas here right because we're in the
[00:02:50] harbor where like it all starts and
[00:02:52] everything so we're getting ready to go
[00:02:54] over there and I was telling the kids I
[00:02:56] was like getting ready to pull like the
[00:02:57] cord pull cord to start the the motor
[00:03:01] and I was saying kids be careful there's
[00:03:02] a little bit of waves coming in well it
[00:03:04] had rain the night before so the dingy
[00:03:05] was slippery and instead of standing on
[00:03:07] the like nonslip area that is still
[00:03:10] slippery when it rains because it's
[00:03:11] still fiberglass I was doing on the edge
[00:03:13] of it trying to like pull it not the
[00:03:14] edge of the boat but like the edge of
[00:03:15] the fiberglass part connecting to the uh
[00:03:17] rubber trying to get ready to pull like
[00:03:19] give a strong pull to get it going and
[00:03:21] uh the Water something happened Little
[00:03:23] Wave came I slipped and I fell and I
[00:03:26] just instinctively grabbed the cord but
[00:03:28] when I grabbed it instead of it like
[00:03:30] like when it was between my two fingers
[00:03:31] here to getting ready to pull it slipped
[00:03:33] out of this finger so I'll use the
[00:03:35] example in this it slipped out of the
[00:03:37] finger and I was like and it grabbed on
[00:03:38] that hand that one and well my pinky
[00:03:41] cannot support my weight and it went
[00:03:46] sideways that was
[00:03:48] really so we're going to get in um some
[00:03:51] of our adventure games here this is what

[00:09:22] background yes Hot Hands cracking way
[00:09:24] too many packs that's what happened yeah
[00:09:26] this this was what occurred I broke my
[00:09:28] fingers cracking the pack
[00:09:33] oh broken waterline that's no fun yeah I
[00:09:37] we dealt with that uh one of the first
[00:09:38] times we moved into our house cuz they
[00:09:40] they built our house when I was younger
[00:09:41] we built the one that my family bought
[00:09:44] they um they built and put the line on
[00:09:46] the edge of the house on the overhang
[00:09:48] like a sop overhang type thing uh it was
[00:09:50] like a one foot for the whatever anyways
[00:09:52] but there was not a lot of instulation
[00:09:54] so the for first winter we were there
[00:09:57] living there and we're running water the
[00:09:58] pipes Rose and cracked and we had to go
[00:10:00] and replace
[00:10:04] him so yeah
[00:10:06] yep yes no I uh I no that I fell uh had
[00:10:11] a bad bad luck and I fell got a little
[00:10:14] ouchy I'll be fine
[00:10:17] though nothing spectacular I got to put
[00:10:19] these in though I got to put these

[00:10:53] booster can't type in booster I'm just N
[00:10:56] I might be able to it's just going to be

[00:11:02] do their game this morning yes you
[00:11:05] can no no stop and pick up your
[00:11:09] stuff um then we
[00:11:12] have and
[00:11:14] set yeah so I've uh got broke my hand
[00:11:17] and then calim I think it's K hm
[00:11:22] right
[00:11:24] um I think that's what this that is
[00:11:27] there right I believe come someone let
[00:11:30] me know on that
[00:11:33] one come on
[00:11:40] man see
[00:11:44] here oh hand
[00:11:56] hurt if I I
[00:12:05] my hand is
[00:12:06] [Music]
[00:12:10] hurting that just put it down and I did
[00:12:12] I hate when you do that when you break
[00:12:14] oh crap you don't even think about
[00:12:17] it
[00:12:24] what
[00:12:26] what what the
[00:12:33] what did I do so George not bad uh Good
[00:12:36] morning George so long story George I
[00:12:39] um Christmas is good with the family not
[00:12:42] bad I appreciate Hot Hands yeah we did
[00:12:43] pretty good yeah but I so I was trying
[00:12:47] to pull the cord do pull the pull cord
[00:12:49] take the pull cord uh start the motor on
[00:12:51] the dinghy with the pull cord and I was
[00:12:53] getting ready to do that and I turned
[00:12:55] around to the kids and said hey pay
[00:12:57] attention it's slippery it rained and
[00:13:00] when I went to do that a little wave
[00:13:02] came in and my in I instinctually like
[00:13:04] grabbed and pulled on the cord to like
[00:13:06] kind of stabilize myself well it it
[00:13:09] slipped out of this
[00:13:10] finger
[00:13:12] here down and went onto that finger and
[00:13:15] my pinky cannot support my body weight
[00:13:16] and made it goes
[00:13:18] sideways so that is what happened to
[00:13:27] me that's what occurred here here
[00:13:31] yep ouch yes do as I say not as I do
[00:13:35] kids
[00:13:36] exactly correct yes that was exactly
[00:13:38] what happened that was a do as I say not
[00:13:39] as I do now here's the proof of why you
[00:13:41] don't do what I say do what I say I mean
[00:13:43] do what I do but you just do what I say
[00:13:45] CU I proved you doing what I do hurts
[00:13:51] people all right let me uh get these
[00:13:53] things figured out here
[00:14:01] think those were
[00:14:12] those
[00:14:16] okay but it makes it typing a lot slower
[00:14:18] and I completely forgot about
[00:14:21] that so for once no you can
[00:14:26] be it's uh it's just the ways that
[00:14:28] things work some times it doesn't always
[00:14:31] go so yes I had I had a bad
[00:14:36] one yes I needed to start doing my wife
[00:14:39] said I need to start doing some push-ups
[00:14:40] with my pinkies from now on so that she
[00:14:42] said once this hand heals too I'm going
[00:14:43] to have even it's going to be even
[00:14:44] stronger and I'll be able I'll be able
[00:14:45] to just do everything with my one hand
[00:14:47] my pinky I'll be rolling around with
[00:14:49] like one hand doing
[00:14:51] it doing whatever is
[00:14:54] needed then you all right let me put in
[00:14:57] uh
[00:14:59] got to type in here this one
[00:15:19] was have to go today today boy are you

[00:21:50] right there my
[00:21:53] friends all right not bad pick up he I
[00:21:56] guess he was right with the uh picking a
[00:21:58] good pack right there said we'll grab
[00:22:00] one we were thinking of grabbing
[00:22:01] something earlier to open but you know
[00:22:02] we got it I might as well open something
[00:22:04] nice another Lily I
[00:22:13] know all
[00:22:15] righty let's do this right here put that
[00:22:19] away and get these all taken care of for
[00:22:23] you cuz if anybody I think I those end
[00:22:26] up going into a uh I think I I I think I
[00:22:28] have a high society for myself but the
[00:22:30] Liliana is nice I like
[00:22:40] it all righty well that wasn't
[00:22:43] bad not bad at
[00:22:47] all it is lagging sometimes yeah it does
[00:22:50] that a little bit every now and again
[00:22:51] somewhere I'm doing my best it's the uh
[00:22:55] starlink connection because the boat
[00:22:57] moves
[00:22:59] that's the problem it doesn't always
[00:23:00] stay in exactly the same position based
[00:23:02] on how the wind is so sometimes it gets
[00:23:04] a little adjustment and it little lag
[00:23:07] sometimes uh now M when you say like lag
[00:23:10] is it continuously because it looks like
[00:23:12] it's not always continuously on all the
[00:23:14] channels here seems like it's partially
[00:23:16] on some of
[00:23:19] them we'll throw back our our background
[00:23:22] image on
[00:23:24] there no okay there's
[00:23:30] all right well we'll put those here cuz
[00:23:32] I like
[00:23:39] this
[00:23:42] yep all right
[00:23:51] no well got a family dramas you know got
[00:23:54] to deal with
[00:23:55] it anyways we're going to put that one
[00:23:58] out for for them that was with Nolan no
[00:24:00] if anybody wants to jump on that we just
[00:24:01] have our breaks kind of available today
[00:24:02] we're not doing too too much just lazy
[00:24:04] day after the
[00:24:05] holiday how's it
[00:24:09] going look at that view I know not a bad
[00:24:11] view right there I know it's the ships
[00:24:13] right now but doesn't matter look how
[00:24:14] calm that bay is I know that's why we're
[00:24:16] floating all over randomly but it's
[00:24:18] doing better with the lagging right now
[00:24:19] I'm guessing M right at least it seems
[00:24:22] like it
[00:24:26] is I want to do something like
[00:24:30] so should be better thank you I did
[00:24:33] George how' you you having yourself a
[00:24:35] good
[00:24:36] one I'm getting Will's packs put in here

[00:24:41] bad eventful eventful yes I mean the
[00:24:44] broken finger but it was fun we got to
[00:24:47] go over to uh I had a broken finger and
[00:24:49] I actually was wandering around the uh

[00:54:24] they made the movie about you right
[00:54:25] wasn't that the movie made about you
[00:54:27] what what was that movie Four
[00:54:28] Christmases right well it was the name
[00:54:30] of the movie it was literally Four
[00:54:31] Christmases correct I think so they made
[00:54:33] a movie about you right Cole was is that

[01:09:20] here for a bit hang
[01:09:24] out do matter where you're
[01:09:27] at I think we have a good connection
[01:09:29] right now too looks like connection's
[01:09:32] pretty
[01:09:34] good also pretty good and stable not the
[01:09:36] best but it's pretty stable and decent
[01:09:38] right
[01:09:39] now I say we're going all right so yeah
[01:09:43] we have a few people if you'd like to
[01:09:44] jump in on the break few spots left we
[01:09:46] have a few different ones just going to
[01:09:48] hang out here watch the uh watch our
[01:09:52] background as we float
[01:09:55] have a relaxing day after the
[01:09:57] holiday help children with uh setting
[01:10:00] their computers up with whatever they're
[01:10:01] doing
[01:10:05] do oh we're going to have to go pick out
[01:10:07] some carpet today yes we have a carpet
[01:10:10] we want to
[01:10:12] get to put down on the floor to cover up
[01:10:15] some of the uh one some of the stains
[01:10:16] from when before we bought it like when
[01:10:18] we bought it they were made they're
[01:10:19] already here so I'll cover that up and
[01:10:21] it'll also help to um cover up all the
[01:10:25] uh
[01:10:25] the bottom like all the storage
[01:10:27] compartments in the bottom so that when
[01:10:28] you walk around you just kind of walk on
[01:10:30] flat rather and it'll be a little softer
[01:10:31] too on your feet it's something that we
[01:10:33] need something softer on our feet so
[01:10:35] your feet get sore in here after uh
[01:10:37] walking W around on the hard floor all
[01:10:38] the time especially with the uh non-skid
[01:10:44] stuff let's see if anybody wants to jump
[01:10:46] in on the brake we have all kinds of
[01:10:47] stuff available in the buy now
[01:10:49] too if you want to try them there a
[01:10:52] decent amount of packs there in the buy
[01:10:53] now
[01:10:58] yes get some matching drapes yes
[01:11:02] correct so we do need some to cover up
[01:11:05] the uh cover up the side so we don't
[01:11:06] have any
[01:11:08] uh light coming in all the time with the
[01:11:10] sun'll help cool keep the place
[01:11:17] cooler because we already have some type
[01:11:19] of Shades that go down but um I think
[01:11:21] the other ones would be better if we can
[01:11:22] get some to just completely block it
[01:11:30] especially in the front and the back
[01:11:32] yeah that's cuz we have ones on the side
[01:11:35] already that kind of block some of the
[01:11:36] sun which does a decent job it lets in
[01:11:38] stuff I think we can get those type of
[01:11:39] things just for all the windows would be
[01:11:41] actually kind of nice you know what I
[01:11:42] mean
[01:11:47] yeah no I was just thinking like the
[01:11:48] clothing stuff we they must have some
[01:11:50] type of material that we can get and we
[01:11:52] can get it then put magnets to them and
[01:11:54] L put it over those with magnets cuz
[01:11:55] it's all metal you know what I'm
[01:11:59] saying anyways discussing how to handle
[01:12:02] things here while we're just
[01:12:05] chilling watching what's in front of us
[01:12:07] see if anybody would like to jump in on
[01:12:09] our break and have some fun today we
[01:12:10] open the pack earlier not too bad we had
[01:12:13] another one earlier that we opened that
[01:12:14] we had actually a pretty good one from
[01:12:16] we had some pretty good hits with that
[01:12:17] pack
[01:12:19] but we'll see what else goes on this
[01:12:22] afternoon this morning we'll be on for I
[01:12:25] know maybe another hour or so while
[01:12:27] everybody gets relaxed and ready and
[01:12:30] then we'll uh we'll head out and we'll
[01:12:31] do some other things cuz I think it's
[01:12:32] around 10:00 a.m. things they open
[01:12:34] generally
[01:12:34] [Music]
[01:12:37] right yeah so and plus it's the day

[01:12:40] Mone so many boats I know and those are
[01:12:43] all expensive compared to us there a
[01:12:46] giant one coming in

[01:12:52] there's one back and in right there look

[01:19:44] yeah it's broken in four places like you
[01:19:45] he's like you did yeah that's impressive
[01:19:48] you did good job there you're
[01:19:53] not all right
[01:19:58] well here we
[01:20:00] go Nei
[01:20:02] way yes that's what
[01:20:06] happened and um I'm going to
[01:20:24] [Music]
[01:20:37] [Music]
[01:20:56] am I un Frozen
[01:20:58] now it's frozen there you go holy cruise
[01:21:03] ship yeah I know we got cruise ships in
[01:21:04] and out of here I'm not a big fan of
[01:21:06] them they have a lot of uh make a lot of
[01:21:08] uh weight for you and there's also a lot
[01:21:11] of people that are end up being around
[01:21:12] and just not as fun as it could be you
[01:21:14] know could be better
[01:21:18] always but we got our break there we got
[01:21:21] three spots left let's get the break
[01:21:22] done here today I'd like to get that
[01:21:24] accomplished we got the two thing other
[01:21:26] thing too is because of we're in a port
[01:21:27] we get a lot of rocking which throws off
[01:21:29] the satellite connection for
[01:21:31] everything so we don't always have the
[01:21:33] greatest
[01:21:34] connections so that's uh that's another
[01:21:36] thing that's a frustrating one here but
[01:21:38] I need to get it also the mount better
[01:21:39] so it's on top of the boat so it has a
[01:21:41] better signal on a regular basis cuz I
[01:21:44] think that's also part of the thing too
[01:21:45] cuz if I was able to get it up on top
[01:21:47] and mount it up there we wouldn't have
[01:21:49] as much issue with being in the back
[01:21:50] having anything obstructed cuz it would
[01:21:52] always have a flat View and it be
[01:21:53] completely wide open
[01:21:55] uh versus the way it is now it kind of
[01:21:56] like doesn't always get a completely
[01:21:58] view cuz you can go into the water a
[01:22:00] little bit cuz the way it's angled right
[01:22:02] now so I need it higher so it's just
[01:22:03] straight pcking up and I don't have my
[01:22:05] uh I don't have my um don't have a mount
[01:22:07] yet we're just going to work on that I
[01:22:09] wonder if we can find one here in Puerto
[01:22:11] Rico we probably could find one in
[01:22:12] Puerto Rico when we go to get the dog
[01:22:14] we're going to probably be in Puerto
[01:22:15] Rico for a few days because uh at Le
[01:22:17] maybe a week or so because we're going
[01:22:18] to try to get a a bar installed for
[01:22:20] solar because um today huh work on today
[01:22:26] what reaching out to places exactly that
[01:22:28] the goal for today after people woke up
[01:22:30] after gave your you know all the holiday
[01:22:32] and everything you
[01:22:34] [Music]
[01:22:38] know yeah so yeah it's just we don't
[01:22:40] have everything perfectly set up right
[01:22:41] now so we're working on getting those
[01:22:43] things running but you know I it's
[01:22:46] because we moved down here and this is
[01:22:47] supposed to be a quick thing but the
[01:22:48] being around the holiday it just took up
[01:22:50] more time than we were expecting I
[01:22:51] completely forgot about it didn't think
[01:22:52] of it you know what I mean
[01:23:01] [Music]
[01:23:02] all right we're trying to get our break
[01:23:04] filled here but if not we we'll finish
[01:23:06] we'll run this again tomorrow anyways
[01:23:08] just hang out for a
[01:23:13] bit thank you I appreciate that cuz I
[01:23:15] think I'm I'm thinking we'll jump off at
[01:23:17] like 10:00 a.m. here which will be 9:00
[01:23:19] a.m. for you
[01:23:21] guys how do I separate the brakes so so
[01:23:25] the way the breaks are done is anyone
[01:23:27] that gets in will get all the rares and
[01:23:29] the uncommons all the rares the mythics
[01:23:32] are put into his sleeves that um and all
[01:23:35] the uncommons and Commons worth $3 or
[01:23:37] more are put into his sleeves I shuffle
[01:23:39] them up and I literally hand them out
[01:23:40] it's kind of like a dealing hits I hand
[01:23:41] them out an order based on the spot the
[01:23:43] person got so for instance right
[01:23:46] now we have Luke would get spot number
[01:23:49] one spot number two would be spicy spot
[01:23:51] number three would be Nico and then
[01:23:52] whoever got Spore four five and six six
[01:23:54] would go that way and I just literally
[01:23:55] hand out the cards to everyone in order
[01:23:59] after I shuffle them up within their
[01:24:00] sleeves and I find that to be kind of
[01:24:02] like the most Fair way cuz I've been in
[01:24:04] breaks before where I've done color
[01:24:05] breaks and I've been in breaks before
[01:24:07] where I've done uh uh like number breaks
[01:24:11] and every single time dig uh digit braks
[01:24:14] and every single time I have any of
[01:24:15] those I never get anything other than
[01:24:17] make one or two cars While others get a
[01:24:19] lot so I figur I like doing this it
[01:24:20] makes it more of an even way for people
[01:24:22] to get everything kind of like a deing
[01:24:24] hits is what I was told in a way but
[01:24:26] that yeah that's what we do all I need
[01:24:28] is just
[01:24:30] Mouse yes I'm sorry about the laging a
[01:24:32] little bit it's just the boat moving
[01:24:33] around and I don't have the best Mount
[01:24:34] set up just
[01:24:39] yet yeah if you have any questions I'll
[01:24:41] enter the infant let me
[01:24:45] know I have to keep my hand up so I'm
[01:24:47] not in
[01:24:47] [Music]
[01:24:48] pain every time I set it down I'm like
[01:24:51] throbbing
[01:24:55] so each spot right now uh you can see it
[01:24:58] each spot here I'll pin this one spot
[01:25:01] there that's a spot for the break there
[01:25:03] and what you get is uh we'll show I'll
[01:25:05] show it right out in front here we get
[01:25:06] these this is what we're using in our
[01:25:08] spots right now is
[01:25:11] foundations modern Horizon 3 play
[01:25:14] booster Commander Legends
[01:25:18] draft Modern Masters 2017 Commander
[01:25:22] Masters set and calim collector that's
[01:25:26] what the boys picked out for uh that's
[01:25:27] what at least Nolan picked out there for
[01:25:29] the packs that we're going to be open
[01:25:30] for this and it's $17 for each one and
[01:25:34] that's how we do the
[01:25:36] break if you want you guys can always
[01:25:38] like you said just hang out
[01:25:40] here and uh don't need to do too much I
[01:25:44] said just doing our doing our thing
[01:25:45] hanging out having some
[01:25:48] fun cuz we'll just get up and you know
[01:25:51] we'll get up and head out here in a
[01:25:52] little while we like to like people you
[01:25:53] know people waake up later don't start
[01:25:56] things all right away early here except
[01:25:58] for the cruise ships those people some
[01:25:59] of those people are up you know whatever
[01:26:00] all night long just because of it being
[01:26:02] people around the world sometimes coming
[01:26:03] into those which is intriguing to see
[01:26:06] sometimes different people and how their
[01:26:08] cultures are compared to like different
[01:26:10] ones how they
[01:26:15] act yeah they were all here that's what
[01:26:17] I
[01:26:18] saying they weren't anchored they were
[01:26:21] they anchored oh they were do okay
[01:26:25] down it what did you get
[01:26:28] Ryan you got to let me know if you got
[01:26:30] something good for
[01:26:32] Christmas get a good hit from a pack
[01:26:34] opening come on was it a serialize was
[01:26:37] it like a ooh Badlands
[01:26:41] nice that is nice congratulations that's
[01:26:45] a good pick up there buddy I like it
[01:26:47] those are not that's a nice card to get
[01:26:49] there that's that's a nice one to add to
[01:26:50] your collection
[01:26:57] all
[01:26:58] righty I know that's nice
[01:27:01] what just in case some of them are
[01:27:04] longer you
[01:27:06] can I don't think it should be necessary
[01:27:09] cuz all of them should be able to get
[01:27:10] pretty close to it that was just because
[01:27:11] the the big the big thing was in the way
[01:27:14] we couldn't get any
[01:27:18] closer all
[01:27:21] right so we're going to have to go by
[01:27:23] the way we're going to have to go right
[01:27:24] next to the cruise ships if we're going
[01:27:25] to get to get
[01:27:27] water we're going to go right next to
[01:27:29] the cruise ships to get water here okay
[01:27:32] so yeah we're going to roll that's an
[01:27:33] expensive card I like that that's a good
[01:27:35] one to get I I'd be very happy about
[01:27:36] that too so you got that in is that like
[01:27:38] a a graded one or did you get that out
[01:27:39] of like somebody open a pack and you
[01:27:41] happen to be in the break and got
[01:27:44] it you'll let me know that's a pretty
[01:27:46] nice one to get a bad lands there a good
[01:27:48] pick up
[01:27:53] [Music]
[01:27:54] one
[01:27:58] time ah nice grated sweet that's a good
[01:28:01] one that's a good one so that's nice see
[01:28:03] you family member family members
[01:28:05] listened I like it we got you a fun one
[01:28:08] see for me we didn't I didn't get
[01:28:09] necessar any cars but we got a got a
[01:28:11] nice swing here I can swing out back on
[01:28:13] our on our on our from my um davit
[01:28:17] system here for the dingy I can just
[01:28:18] hook myself up and
[01:28:19] swing I wonder if I could hook myself up
[01:28:21] in the middle of that swing too because
[01:28:24] because of the the other one the chains
[01:28:26] you know what I mean put them off to
[01:28:27] each side should be in the
[01:28:31] middle there just
[01:28:33] wonder harder to get on and off though
[01:28:35] way harder to get on and off yeah it's
[01:28:37] we easy to get on there right now except
[01:28:40] you're closer to it that's why I was
[01:28:42] thinking if I did the other way I'd be
[01:28:43] further away from
[01:28:49] everything yeah I can put it down a
[01:28:51] little I know you're not nearly as

[01:33:53] live on a boat yeah we're hanging out
[01:33:54] here Silva Collectibles that's nice I
[01:33:55] know thank you thank you I appreciate
[01:33:57] that welcome in welcome in thank you and
[01:33:58] make sure you do follow our friend Silva
[01:34:00] came with a raid there but yeah that's
[01:34:01] the boat that's kind of what we do here
[01:34:03] we're on here doing some having some fun
[01:34:04] and like I said I got the uh getting the
[01:34:06] warehouse set up in Miami so all that
[01:34:08] will be going out of there as we drop
[01:34:10] things off and plus we're going to be
[01:34:11] back in the US regularly anyways cuz uh
[01:34:12] we'll be only there and eventually this
[01:34:15] summer we'll end up traveling up the
[01:34:16] east coast and as we go up the East
[01:34:18] Coast we'll change uh well you know
[01:34:19] we'll change our location a little bit
[01:34:21] for the shipping stuff so maybe uh maybe
[01:34:22] you guys can meet us at some point as we
[01:34:25] go up the East Coast during Hurricane
[01:34:26] Season this summer and uh maybe we will
[01:34:28] play some games I figure that'll be
[01:34:29] pretty
[01:34:31] fun where your other house Ryan we're
[01:34:35] living on the boat we moved on to the
[01:34:37] boat the other house is no longer here
[01:34:39] with us we sold all of our stuff and
[01:34:43] moved onto the
[01:34:45] boat Ryan we are for the most part
[01:34:48] indefinitely here we're not going to be
[01:34:49] doing anything specific other than
[01:34:51] sailing around like I said EV the goal
[01:34:54] is to sail around the
[01:34:56] world um so yeah how are you doing
[01:35:00] all so that is that's what I'm saying
[01:35:02] there yeah not we're that's what we're
[01:35:05] doing I am using starlink right now that
[01:35:07] is correct it works pretty well for us
[01:35:09] in the morning um the only problem is
[01:35:11] when we have a lot of boats here I
[01:35:13] sometimes will'll get loose connection
[01:35:14] just cuz when boats going in and out
[01:35:16] will cause the satellite connection to
[01:35:18] drop a little bit just because we'll
[01:35:20] either spin or we'll get a lot of wobble
[01:35:21] and I don't have it sat set on the top
[01:35:23] of the yet to get the full best coverage
[01:35:25] available for it so once I get that set
[01:35:27] up with our like what I want it should
[01:35:29] be better using Starling yeah oh the
[01:35:32] hand so I was um I was getting I was on
[01:35:35] the dinging getting ready to uh start it
[01:35:37] with the pull cord and um I was telling
[01:35:39] the kids be careful it's slippery and
[01:35:42] cuz uh it just had rained and I slipped
[01:35:45] as a wave came and I was trying to I had
[01:35:48] the dingy pull cord right here well it

[01:41:22] Moon when you see someone's bum hey this
[01:41:25] is the um
[01:41:27] oh that there you all right
[01:41:35] yeah that's true it is open because

[01:41:38] got to close the
[01:41:39] hatch oh got a guy go rolling around in
[01:41:42] his dinghy here his center
[01:41:45] console that's what we'll get in the
[01:41:46] next boat when we have our 55 to 60 foot
[01:41:50] we're going to have one of the go fast
[01:41:51] ones with the center console that can
[01:41:52] have like 15 people on we're you wait
[01:41:54] like 60 mph to the like a 60 horsepower
[01:41:57] 70 horsepower motor on that thing we're
[01:41:59] going to go we'll be we'll be able to
[01:42:01] travel between islands we'll just anchor
[01:42:03] our boat our boat's good here we're just
[01:42:05] travel between islands on the boats when
[01:42:07] we're in the Bahamas we don't even move
[01:42:08] we'll just leave the anchor in our spot
[01:42:09] that we like that's like a good secure
[01:42:11] spot that does you know what I mean then
[01:42:13] we can L to take the boat cuz it'll be
[01:42:14] quicker than taking the sail unless we
[01:42:16] want to sail somewhere to do something
[01:42:18] you know what I
[01:42:19] mean even the dinghy goes like uh ours
[01:42:22] goes fast like a 25 M we we get up on
[01:42:24] plane and we're going like 20 30 mph at
[01:42:27] full at Full Throttle I need to get like
[01:42:29] a speedometer just to we need we get GPS
[01:42:32] speed up on the phone and it'll tell you
[01:42:34] how fast you're going we're going have
[01:42:35] to do that the next time we're on the
[01:42:36] dingy and going Full Throttle see how
[01:42:37] fast we go Full Throttle cuz that's
[01:42:39] going to be interesting we went across
[01:42:40] the whole Harbor in like a minute it was
[01:42:42] like boom done gone from one end to the
[01:42:45] other I need to make sure that I'm
[01:42:46] holding on better yest the way back
[01:42:49] rain that was oh you you were slipping
[01:42:53] hold on the dingy
[01:42:55] yeah you almost got me banned what did I
[01:43:00] do like
[01:43:03] this D Dy how many ponies 18 it's only
[01:43:08] 18 I wanted to get 25 but the 25 that
[01:43:11] they had was a long shaft and it would
[01:43:13] have when it was up on our davit it
[01:43:14] would have hit the um it would have hit
[01:43:16] like our our boat being long shaft so
[01:43:19] they were like we have an 18 and it was
[01:43:20] a little cheaper and she like it's going
[01:43:22] to the 18 is going to make make you go
[01:43:23] anyways the 18's actually they were
[01:43:25] telling me the 18 was too big for the
[01:43:26] dingy and too fast cuz if I because
[01:43:28] having anybody on there I end up
[01:43:30] flipping it or something like that I'm
[01:43:31] like yeah but you don't put it Full
[01:43:32] Throttle when you're alone you only put
[01:43:33] it Full Throttle when you multiple
[01:43:35] people in there and you can be okay with
[01:43:37] it so I mean it's an 18 horsepower on a

[02:55:38] while we're hanging out
[02:55:40] here little relaxation for that 20
[02:55:43] seconds until we can see what happens
[02:55:44] here always a fun time hey hey Robert
[02:55:47] that would be great
[02:55:49] that'll be great it'll be fun we try to
[02:55:50] do this like I said every day we come
[02:55:52] home we do we do some adventuring you
[02:55:54] get to uh participate and we're getting
[02:55:55] it
[02:55:58] bigger is that the SAT antenna view this
[02:56:01] is yes that is my antenna right there um
[02:56:05] that's what I use for connecting for
[02:56:06] Starling here yeah it's going to
[02:56:08] eventually be up on top of the boat but
[02:56:09] right now it's just I don't I'm not home
[02:56:11] with all of our stuff to get it mounted
[02:56:12] correctly when it's on top I should have
[02:56:14] a lot better coverage signal especially
[02:56:16] when the boat turns and stuff so it
[02:56:17] won't like miss all the things and being
[02:56:19] turned and being blocked by a little bit
[02:56:20] of the water and a little bit of the
[02:56:21] boat here so that's why it's not in the
[02:56:23] best position but it's in a decent one
[02:56:25] right now it works okay at the moment
[02:56:27] pretty much what it blows down to works
[02:56:29] good enough for what we need and we're
[02:56:31] able to yeah as you can see we can
[02:56:33] stream for the most part pretty nice and
[02:56:35] that's the yeah that's the satellite
[02:56:36] view of what we got there everything's
[02:56:38] going in all right here we
[02:56:46] go there we go
[02:56:50] you
[02:56:52] find the
[02:56:55] following okay now because of the way
[02:56:59] the person was able to manipulate their
[02:57:01] body with that sword it's not exactly a
[02:57:05] full sword you might need some help you
[02:57:08] know at some point so what you have
[02:57:12] right now is this
[02:57:24] give this the
[02:57:30] moment this is what is seen all of a
[02:57:32] sudden here there is this pirate sword
[02:57:36] but it's in a couple of
[02:57:38] pieces because you guys destroyed him so

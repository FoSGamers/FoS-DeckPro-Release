You're missing what is on the other side of the dice that are visible, or if there's nothing on them. You're missing all kinds of stuff. I need every single description that, the right way that, if somebody gave you the description, you would exact copy the picture that was provided.

Make sure you do everything correct. It seems like you have the people in the wrong cards. Like a man is with an enchantress mage and you shouldn't have it that way. Make sure you use all of the things in the description and do it 100% correctly with what is in the description only. Don't use anything else. Don't make up your own stuff. Use strictly the description. And make it black and white only. No gray of any kind. Only colors black and white.

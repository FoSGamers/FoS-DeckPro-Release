[01:20:50] a pack of cards pulling out something
[01:20:51] good as you would buying H one of those

[01:20:54] them a little bit
[01:20:56] there at least that's what I try to do
[01:20:59] build how it would be similar to
[01:21:01] similarly to if you were going to buy a

[01:35:10] oh you got the blame game
[01:35:13] preon well look at
[01:35:19] that you got the blame game precon
[01:35:26] boom there you
[01:35:29] go got a precond that that's a pretty
[01:35:33] good freaking deal right
[01:35:35] there you also got this if you have
[01:35:37] children by the way Hunchback and not
[01:35:39] name they might like
[01:35:42] that Kore you got a commander deck Kyo
[01:35:47] you got a commander
[01:35:50] deck yeah you got the blame gang
[01:35:52] commander deck
[01:35:55] nice
[01:35:56] buddy congratulations that's a good
[01:35:59] one nice hit on
[01:36:11] that
[01:36:14] Kore there you go my
[01:36:18] friend nice one see I told you all we
[01:36:22] got good stuff look at that kymore with
[01:36:24] the hook up
[01:36:27] [Laughter]
[01:36:29] there well it's kind of that way it
[01:36:32] isn't it isn't see like see the thing is
[01:36:35] you know exactly what you're getting
[01:36:36] you're not going to not get anything and
[01:36:38] that's the difference because gambling
[01:36:39] you don't get anything it's like when
[01:36:41] you buy a regular pack of cards from a
[01:36:42] store and I actually build them a little
[01:36:43] bit better you get actually generally
[01:36:45] better options than when you buy a pack
[01:36:47] because a lot of people like they
[01:36:48] jumping and like oh my God I'm going to
[01:36:50] spend this on that and you spend $40 on
[01:36:52] a pack of cards and you
[01:36:55] get $3 worth of cards out people don't
[01:36:58] care but they'll spend like $20 on this
[01:37:02] and get a $10 pack and they'll be upset
[01:37:05] I'm like you just got like but if you
[01:37:07] had a pack and you got what
[01:37:16] whatever well Kore I have cards all the
[01:37:19] time we do all kinds of things I singles
[01:37:22] we do Dar and shows on every now again
[01:37:24] so those are good ones too we're able to
[01:37:25] get shows
[01:37:27] on all righty let's see that was a good
[01:37:31] one that was a nice one I like that all
[01:37:33] right
[01:37:37] so let's do this let's do
[01:37:44] [Music]

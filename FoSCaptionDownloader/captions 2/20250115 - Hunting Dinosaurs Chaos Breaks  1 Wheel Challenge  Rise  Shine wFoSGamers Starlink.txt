[01:06:11] on so I have a I have a fishing
[01:06:15] license do what I want I'm this
[01:06:17] Caribbean I'm a
[01:06:19] pirate yeah no there's the fishing
[01:06:21] license that you get you have to get
[01:06:22] them per area that you're in you have to
[01:06:23] pay for them for like a certain time
[01:06:25] frame like we got one for Puerto Rico uh
[01:06:27] and there's one for the Virgin Islands
[01:06:28] and stuff like that it's like kind of
[01:06:30] like a pain in the butt depending on the
[01:06:31] places you go to so I was I'd hope there
[01:06:33] I was trying to find one that was like a
[01:06:34] whole Caribbean one that way I don't
[01:06:37] need to worry about it but the also the
[01:06:39] other thing too is some of the islands
[01:06:40] are just like as long as you're not
[01:06:42] being ridiculous and you're only getting
[01:06:43] for yourself they don't care also
[01:06:45] because I'm on my own boat
[01:06:53] living that would be an intriguing uh
[01:06:56] intriguing one Everett yeah I catch a
[01:06:58] giant
[01:07:01] one fish are going to start chasing cows
[01:07:04] now yes I know the cows jumping over the
[01:07:06] moon I mean jumping over the thing there

[01:07:28] special night off or something uh so we
[01:07:30] literally got KFC because nothing was
[01:07:33] open so we went and got that we came
[01:07:35] back here to eat and on the way back in
[01:07:37] the dinghy there were fish jumping

[01:07:43] of those ones where I wish I had my
[01:07:44] camera there I don't
[01:07:47] know but it happens

[01:09:38] uh seeing if we catch anything I really
[01:09:41] at a better location though be way much
[01:09:44] way
[01:09:47] better let's do this quickly I'm going
[01:09:50] to do something quickly
[01:09:55] where'd that
[01:10:24] go trying to figure out what's around
[01:10:38] here let's figure that
[01:10:48] out let's see if we can find that out
[01:10:50] give me a second I'm not paying
[01:10:51] attention to the chat at the moment
[01:10:53] sorry I am I'm literally I will admit
[01:10:55] that I'm looking at a different
[01:11:18] screen well that doesn't help me
[01:11:36] guess you need to be more
[01:11:50] direct well if we catch any of those I
[01:11:52] have my license for it I didn't think
[01:11:54] they'd be here I don't know if we catch
[01:11:56] one of those I might have to question
[01:11:58] throwing that one back depending on how
[01:12:01] it looks even though it's coming from
[01:12:02] the
[01:12:08] harbor got bronze here look at
[01:12:10] that hey Mike how's it going sorry I
[01:12:13] wasn't looking at everything for a
[01:12:21] minute how's it going Mike hope you're
[01:12:24] having a good
[01:12:25] day got a bronze
[01:12:33] here uh mitt and state yeah you don't
[01:12:35] have those all the
[01:12:37] time all right let's go here and Mike I
[01:12:41] see you're going with some spots here
[01:12:43] spot three and four I like it here we
[01:12:47] go let's see what we got going on
[01:12:52] here there we go three spot left in our
[01:12:55] break
[01:12:57] today oh yeah the uh the snake fish the
[01:13:00] snake head they are pretty pricey from
[01:13:02] what I've seen people get them before I
[01:13:04] don't know I don't think we're going to
[01:13:05] be able to catch a a grouper or
[01:13:07] something like that maybe a little
[01:13:08] Snapper is what I was figuring because
[01:13:10] just I figure there would be stuff
[01:13:11] around the Waring balls and everything
[01:13:13] like that but wait a minute that's
[01:13:14] definitely moving around
[01:13:20] interestingly be right
[01:13:24] back
[01:13:34] bouncing just on the bottom
[01:13:55] bouncing
[01:13:57] down oh no it's bouncing
[01:14:00] down oh hold on hold on be right
[01:14:08] back fishy
[01:14:12] fishyyy
[01:14:13] a it's probably caught on the
[01:14:16] ground hopefully that's what hopefully
[01:14:18] the B still there we'll give it a few
[01:14:20] more
[01:14:22] minutes thought it was bouncing it was a
[01:14:24] wind and then it did a couple bounces up
[01:14:25] and down which it's probably on the
[01:14:27] ground it was a couple bounces up and
[01:14:31] down how do the brakes works all right
[01:14:33] so father wig so the way we do it is we
[01:14:34] take all of the um rares and the mythics
[01:14:38] and any common or uncommon that is over
[01:14:40] $3 we put them all into sleeves we
[01:14:42] Shuffle those up and we um hand them out
[01:14:45] per spot really is what it is kind of
[01:14:47] like a deal and hits thing um and then
[01:14:48] all the other um comment all the other
[01:14:51] comments and uncommons those get handed
[01:14:52] out later on when I do like a packing
[01:14:53] everything up um so that's what we're
[01:14:55] doing there with the brakes now as you
[01:14:57] guys can you should be able to see the
[01:14:59] thing hold on we'll put it here so you
[01:15:01] can see it scroll across the
[01:15:02] screen so all of you are aware we're
[01:15:05] going to do it
[01:15:06] quickly here turn that off for a second
[01:15:09] so you'll see the empty screen there but
[01:15:10] what you'll see for the moment is you'll
[01:15:12] be able to see what's going across the
[01:15:14] screen letting you know what's got
[01:15:15] what's going how shipping is just
[01:15:17] because we are on a boat takes about a
[01:15:20] week or two extra just for shipping
[01:15:21] that's all I get everything packed up
[01:15:23] it's just when it gets over to our place
[01:15:25] sometimes we have to mail it to the
[01:15:26] location takes about a week or two to
[01:15:27] get them then they ship it out that's
[01:15:29] why I saying little week or two actress
[01:15:31] or if we're happen to be flying back for
[01:15:32] some reason we bring it with us too
[01:15:34] right now it looks like there's
[01:15:39] nothing well I'm guessing our bait was
[01:15:41] taken but anyways I'll throw the camo
[01:15:46] back on so you can see me over
[01:15:49] here all
[01:15:51] right yeah like a deal hints so it's a
[01:15:53] random so it's random not Digi correct
[01:15:56] more deal hits and $3 are what we
[01:15:59] consider over hits for the uncommons or
[01:16:00] Commons anything else will be put
[01:16:02] together and we'll shff those out hand
[01:16:03] them out and the um and the later on
[01:16:05] when it comes to like
[01:16:07] uh packing everything up or if I'm later
[01:16:09] on in the Stream if we're doing
[01:16:10] something maybe maybe maybe we'll do a
[01:16:12] hanging out with me after and I'll hand
[01:16:13] out all the all the packs that we open
[01:16:14] after we open them and hang out out here
[01:16:16] and finish coffee or something I don't
[01:16:17] know yeah rares and mythics are all
[01:16:19] considered hits unless the dino
[01:16:21] specifically because we're hunting for
[01:16:23] dinos any Dino will be considered put in
[01:16:25] the hits area because we are hunting
[01:16:27] dinos with lost Cav Exon right here that
[01:16:29] would be the only thing that I'd have to
[01:16:30] say you you need to uh the only other
[01:16:33] thing that's added because we're hunting
[01:16:35] for dinos today you know we like our
[01:16:37] dinos so we going to put all of them
[01:16:39] together in

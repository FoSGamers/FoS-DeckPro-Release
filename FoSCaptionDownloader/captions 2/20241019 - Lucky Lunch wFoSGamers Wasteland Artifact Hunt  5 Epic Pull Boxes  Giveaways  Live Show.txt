[00:00:06] yeah I'm a little
[00:00:08] late it
[00:00:11] happens
[00:00:15] right so be it so we have a fun little
[00:00:18] thing to plan
[00:00:20] today all right we uh I was just trying
[00:00:23] to finish setting these up because I
[00:00:26] didn't have all the tiers set up yet but
[00:00:28] I needed to finish get them set up I can
[00:00:29] get them all I figure we can get them
[00:00:30] done now it's a pretty good quick one
[00:00:34] we're on the tier
[00:00:36] three now to get that set up I do
[00:00:39] believe we're working everywhere
[00:00:42] too all right we're
[00:00:45] running
[00:00:51] everywhere there we
[00:00:55] go there we
[00:00:57] go we're going everywhere
[00:01:00] sorry I've been late today guys I had an
[00:01:03] interesting day you know one of those
[00:01:04] one of those intriguing ones so we have
[00:01:06] something new that we're doing now uh
[00:01:10] kind of cool one well at least I thought
[00:01:11] it was kind of cool so what we have is I
[00:01:14] randomly have in some of
[00:01:16] these
[00:01:18] listed what is
[00:01:20] our um you know our like artifact now
[00:01:24] our artifact here just a fun silly
[00:01:27] little little thing nothing special
[00:01:29] nothing over the top it just a little
[00:01:31] silly thing but what it is you're trying
[00:01:34] to find these things they're called
[00:01:39] uh Nexus
[00:01:43] cores at the end of a
[00:01:46] random card single something like that
[00:01:49] we're not sure but what that's going to
[00:01:50] give you is a little bonus because if
[00:01:52] you get a few of those and you get to
[00:01:54] collect them as you go you get to um put
[00:01:56] those in towards a uh a giveaway of some
[00:01:58] kind that you may want
[00:02:00] maybe you want to have uh you can you
[00:02:02] can kind of like pick a giveaway in a
[00:02:04] way by doing it that's what the the
[00:02:07] that's why I thought it was kind of
[00:02:10] fun least at least I thought it would be
[00:02:14] but let me uh let me know what are your
[00:02:15] thoughts are on that if you guys don't
[00:02:17] mind I don't have any giveaway or
[00:02:18] anything run right now if you don't mind
[00:02:19] taking a look and just reading like the
[00:02:21] the rules and see if they make sense and
[00:02:25] they seem intriguing or not or if it
[00:02:27] seems like absolutely stupid
[00:02:31] and um waste time but at least the pole
[00:02:33] boxes will be fun
[00:02:39] right let's
[00:02:41] see what do you think not who you going
[00:02:43] to call you're normally in here Mr oh

[00:03:51] everything there what the average is and

[00:11:53] we're going to see if anybody wants to
[00:11:54] try a bloomo collector has a bunch of
[00:11:56] singles I'm going to run it here for a
[00:11:58] minute you guys kind of see what it goes
[00:11:59] like now the cool thing is if you read
[00:12:01] the show notes the reason why I haven't
[00:12:02] put a giveway up yet is the show notes
[00:12:04] are kind of fun if you happen to find
[00:12:06] the Nexus core you can add them up and
[00:12:09] once you add them up we're going to have
[00:12:10] some fun things for giveaways if you
[00:12:11] happen to collect enough now we're going
[00:12:14] to have some fun with that I thought it
[00:12:16] would be cool you guys we could kind of
[00:12:18] being the first time we do it we can
[00:12:19] kind of decide what we're going to do
[00:12:20] with them
[00:12:22] on it's a little extra thing you can get
[00:12:25] just a fun part of the game Mak it a
[00:12:27] little more game fun as when you get a
[00:12:29] pull box just singles as you can see
[00:12:32] there singles or that you can check all
[00:12:34] good stuff available and then I'm doing
[00:12:38] now though is I'm going to continue to
[00:12:40] add
[00:12:42] in our
[00:12:46] stuff one two
[00:12:53] aha righty this one
[00:12:56] here all right no one wants to do that
[00:12:58] that's okay we'll try another one here
[00:13:01] it's one of I know it's going to be a
[00:13:02] slow day just because I'm not on at my
[00:13:05] normal time and uh you know that's what
[00:13:08] happens when you're not on your normal
[00:13:10] time now the big hit on this one
[00:13:17] is we'll do
[00:13:19] that
[00:13:24] that it
[00:13:26] is that
[00:13:29] and
[00:13:32] then four is yep that's what I thought
[00:13:37] hopefully um somebody will like one of
[00:13:38] the if you take a look at the things
[00:13:40] that we have going on check out the
[00:13:42] boxes the break areas those are what we
[00:13:44] call we I'm calling those virtual I'm
[00:13:45] going use those as virtual pull boxes so
[00:13:47] check out which ones you like and let me
[00:13:49] know if you want to do any of
[00:13:51] them they're pretty fun like I said each
[00:13:54] one of them has in there you have these

[00:35:42] alphabetical order so I can get to them
[00:35:45] better they were they're right now

[00:37:42] treacherous greed which I swear I have
[00:37:46] right around
[00:37:47] here
[00:37:51] somewhere I swear I had murders Carlo
[00:37:54] manner all in one chunk
[00:38:04] wow
[00:38:08] aha I did have them all kind of in a
[00:38:11] chunk just the last chunk that I went
[00:38:17] to it's always the last one right it's
[00:38:21] always the last bit of them isn't it
[00:38:23] you're never going to get them the first
[00:38:25] time it's always going to be the last
[00:38:26] one cuz that's like that Murphy's Law
[00:38:28] crap
[00:38:30] right all right so let's put all those
[00:38:35] back and
[00:38:38] then
[00:38:45] righty there you go no big hit but you
[00:38:49] did get those two my friend and we'll
[00:38:51] run uh I can run some of these some more
[00:38:53] these are fun
[00:38:55] ones these are fun ones to run you're
[00:38:57] very welcome like I said frustrating but
[00:39:01] hey maybe somebody wants to try their
[00:39:02] luck on one for a
[00:39:04] um secret
[00:39:07] lir you're very welcome my
[00:39:10] friend but there you go try a luck on a
[00:39:13] secret layer and I'm going to write your
[00:39:14] name down put you over here with all
[00:39:16] your other stuff and then put your name
[00:39:18] down on uh put this in a bag for you
[00:39:20] since you have it all together there you
[00:39:23] go WB some
[00:39:29] nobody wants to try any secret layer
[00:39:32] ones and I have secret layer in the by
[00:39:35] now if you want to do that or maybe you
[00:39:37] just want to go big big in there on the
[00:39:40] secret layer
[00:39:43] itself these are all secret layer these
[00:39:46] are also bundles and the big hit is the
[00:39:49] uh modern Horizon 3 gift
[00:39:52] bundle so with this one this is a
[00:39:58] $59 and change we're going to run it for
[00:40:00] I'll do this first time for you guys do
[00:40:07] 58
[00:40:09] really
[00:40:11] interesting that should not have happen
[00:40:13] well can you uh you can reach out
[00:40:16] to whatnot well if you've gotten
[00:40:19] multiple of them that would be why if
[00:40:21] you get multiple that would be why it is
[00:40:24] if you it adds them all together that
[00:40:25] would be the reason for it that so you
[00:40:28] did get two so you have to add it
[00:40:29] together and the weight of them and you
[00:40:31] can only get a certain amount of singles
[00:40:33] in uh pwe that would be the reason why
[00:40:36] I'm
[00:40:36] guessing um it wouldn't be for just one
[00:40:39] of them it should be for all of them
[00:40:41] combined if that makes
[00:40:43] sense like that's at least my
[00:40:46] understanding of how it was supposed to
[00:40:47] be that's how it's always been
[00:40:50] generally so if um there's a mistake on
[00:40:53] that
[00:40:54] one I can address that but it shouldn't
[00:40:57] be
[00:40:59] we'll run this one this is all all
[00:41:01] secret lair with a potential of
[00:41:04] $150 mod Horizon 3 gift
[00:41:07] bundle that's a new
[00:41:12] one yeah I don't know if you heard that
[00:41:13] but that's what it is there that's why
[00:41:15] because you had multiples of them not
[00:41:18] just
[00:41:18] one so yeah I can't add I mean that
[00:41:21] would be the reason why ah yes yeah see
[00:41:24] makes sense yeah that's why you see $3
[00:41:27] on that because it says like they're all
[00:41:29] combined as making what it is that's why
[00:41:31] yep it's not going to be each one is $3
[00:41:34] yeah yep yep yep we'll run you know what
[00:41:38] we'll do we'll do this here we'll run
[00:41:40] another one of these for a minute here
[00:41:44] because the fun thing is we have
[00:41:46] um you know some of our giveaways that
[00:41:48] we're doing some of our games well um
[00:41:53] this one here is kind of fun because
[00:41:54] you're trying to capture a uh
[00:41:59] your chance of getting a dkor collector
[00:42:03] booster for
[00:42:04] $2 that's pretty cool and then you get a
[00:42:08] chance $2 there and then because of that
[00:42:12] you
[00:42:14] um R is going to get one of the singles
[00:42:16] that are there and you can see exactly
[00:42:18] what the ceilings are and the floors are
[00:42:20] and exactly what the price of the cards
[00:42:21] even are too when you uh get one of the
[00:42:25] spots but maybe instead you want a uh
[00:42:29] one of the ones that's more of a
[00:42:31] potential of getting a deck where the
[00:42:33] floor is $6 I mean the floor is this
[00:42:36] floor is still could be the $7 but you
[00:42:38] have decks a lot of packs in here also
[00:42:41] that's why the average is
[00:42:45] $550 cents and we're going to start it
[00:42:47] at $5 to try to see if you want $5 you
[00:42:50] could potentially get a whole deck
[00:42:54] or who knows but this is what you do
[00:42:56] here we'll have some fun with this one
[00:42:58] hopefully guys will like to have some
[00:43:00] fun
[00:43:01] too I have a feeling this afternoon is
[00:43:04] what I expected it to
[00:43:08] be that's all right we'll try it out um
[00:43:11] I don't mind wasting a little bit of
[00:43:12] time
[00:43:13] here hey tabletop magic how's it going
[00:43:25] today well uh
[00:43:30] yeah we'll keep trying them
[00:43:33] here I think what all end up doing here
[00:43:35] is I'll open up
[00:43:37] a I'll open up a I had some things to
[00:43:39] open earlier I might open up some of
[00:43:41] those while we're waiting and hanging
[00:43:42] out and you guys can always check out
[00:43:44] all the ones that we have
[00:43:46] available if you want to try any of them

[01:00:41] an exciting way to start oh we only had
[01:00:43] 10 we only had 10 left hey is that guy
[01:00:46] is that guy I got a question for you you
[01:00:48] um the break did not finish we had a
[01:00:50] couple uh you had a couple of spots
[01:00:52] there since nobody filled it what we're
[01:00:54] going to do is I was going to offer you
[01:00:55] um you can go with a couple of things
[01:00:57] here you can jump in on um like one of
[01:01:02] the
[01:01:05] um you can ask for a refund on the two
[01:01:08] of them one then you can jump in on any
[01:01:11] of the uh any of the like the things
[01:01:13] that we got going on for like the um if
[01:01:15] you want to go and look there's a
[01:01:16] there's a bunch of different um virtual
[01:01:19] pull boxes in there and you can see
[01:01:20] literally everything to the literally
[01:01:21] down to the price of the card in that
[01:01:23] which is kind of cool so if you go and
[01:01:24] look say you go and look at all the on
[01:01:25] ones that are the radiation Zone ones
[01:01:28] all right those all literally have the
[01:01:30] price of the card associated with it so
[01:01:32] you know exactly what you can be getting
[01:01:34] there which is kind of fun I thought it
[01:01:35] was sweet so like say you want to if you
[01:01:37] want to refund there we can do that the
[01:01:38] other thing is if you want we can just
[01:01:40] take the amount that you had I'll add it
[01:01:42] up together and we can get you like some
[01:01:44] packs or maybe a bundle or whatever it
[01:01:46] is you'd like to get that would be
[01:01:48] different it's up to you it just because
[01:01:49] we didn't get it the break did not close
[01:01:51] for some reason and I can't I don't know
[01:01:53] why
[01:01:56] but we have here maybe you're going to
[01:01:58] try yourself and get a secret
[01:02:01] layer for
[01:02:04] uh
[01:02:07] $3 that the average is 326 get a secret
[01:02:10] layer potentially we'll find out but
[01:02:13] anyways that's what I was going to give
[01:02:14] you the option of just wanted to let you
[01:02:17] know yes correct I believe it is it is
[01:02:20] that
[01:02:21] correct that is correct

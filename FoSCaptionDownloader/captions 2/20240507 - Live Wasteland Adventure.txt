[00:03:39] get some of the giveaways like we do
[00:03:40] over time here running but I can't do a
[00:03:42] ton of them anymore just because of how
[00:03:44] whatnot has made a changes to some of
[00:03:46] their rules cannot trust certain things
[00:03:49] so um I can only do c some things
[00:03:52] certain ways so uh that's why I
[00:03:54] um and how whatnot will actually accept
[00:03:58] um a lie and then manipulate the rulle
[00:03:59] after the fact and complain to you so
[00:04:01] we're going to put these out

[00:05:02] characters if you wanted to participate
[00:05:04] in this one but no one's actually been
[00:05:05] doing this one
[00:05:07] recently all right well looks like I'm
[00:05:11] going to keep uh I don't know what I'm
[00:05:13] going to do today I guess all of you are
[00:05:14] looking for pull box things which I'm
[00:05:15] surprised they're even
[00:05:25] allowing it's okay people want to take
[00:05:28] that gamble I'm not going to take the
[00:05:29] Gamble anymore I'll just be um I'll try
[00:05:31] to do packs as best I can here
[00:05:34] but I
[00:05:36] suspect we'll
[00:05:40] uh be jumping off early
[00:05:43] today sorry y let me check out my uh
[00:05:46] YouTube I forgot I have to check on
[00:05:48] what's there I forgot about that
[00:05:49] sometimes the channel there doesn't
[00:05:50] always uh show up in the other areas so
[00:05:53] I got to check over here is it is it
[00:05:55] running oh it is running look at that
[00:05:57] hey
[00:06:10] Daria Dar yeah I am I am I just kind of
[00:06:13] Switched between the
[00:06:16] two all righty anybody want to no one
[00:06:18] wants to jump in on that one so you know
[00:06:20] what we'll do here
[00:06:21] then let's do this a little bit
[00:06:32] huh huh you don't want to do that one
[00:06:36] you can't do we can't do pole box
[00:06:39] anymore because people go and lie about
[00:06:43] them
[00:06:45] so let's do
[00:06:49] um let's try uh let's see what else we
[00:06:51] got up here that's sadly what we cannot
[00:06:54] do is tool
[00:06:56] boxes because I can't trust that people
[00:06:58] are GNA be honest with them
[00:07:01] and I suspect that's why I'm going to be
[00:07:03] low on a regular basis
[00:07:15] here let's
[00:07:18] see I don't even know what to do
[00:07:22] anymore put that there stck Haven
[00:07:26] maybe stck Haven with
[00:07:30] um why not why not no one's in here
[00:07:34] anyways bidding on anything and trying
[00:07:35] anything out so we'll just put anything
[00:07:38] out randomly since it doesn't really
[00:07:39] matter at the moment maybe somebody at
[00:07:41] some point
[00:07:43] will I don't know we'll find out it's up
[00:07:46] to you if you want any of the packs we
[00:07:47] have some fun with the adventure game we
[00:07:48] don't generally uh no one's been wanting
[00:07:51] to do any the the other one we can
[00:07:52] always do our animated one like we've
[00:07:54] had for a while here but it's always up
[00:07:56] to you and what you want to do today or
[00:07:59] do with us during these
[00:08:01] days but we'll try it out here now throw
[00:08:04] out our uh keep throwing out our
[00:08:07] different things here try them out if
[00:08:08] you want jump in on them and I can I'll
[00:08:11] zoom in so we can see everything better
[00:08:13] we'll see how the day
[00:08:16] goes we shall see how the day
[00:08:21] goes interesting that it shows it bigger
[00:08:23] that
[00:08:25] way but it doesn't the other way that's
[00:08:28] intriguing
[00:08:31] huh shows it correctly when you have
[00:08:33] your your camera your phone um the
[00:08:35] screen is doing picture and picture on
[00:08:37] your phone it shows the full view of the
[00:08:39] camera but when you have it in full view
[00:08:41] on your phone trying to look at full
[00:08:43] screen it cuts a chunk of it off on the
[00:08:45] outside that's intriguing it's the first
[00:08:48] time I noticed
[00:08:53] that all right
[00:09:01] no I'm doing all right not doing too bad
[00:09:02] I had a good fishing day
[00:09:04] yesterday uh Willie we're just uh
[00:09:06] hanging out we were going to hopefully
[00:09:07] ripping some packs open depending on if
[00:09:09] we're were going to play our little
[00:09:09] Adventure game sometimes we do this but
[00:09:11] for whatever reason uh this morning's a
[00:09:13] little bit slow um you know Monday
[00:09:15] mornings are on the slower side
[00:09:16] sometimes but for whatever reason this
[00:09:18] morning is a little bit slower than
[00:09:20] normal not too many people want to
[00:09:21] participate in any of the games they
[00:09:23] want to uh I don't know I'm wondering if
[00:09:25] they're maybe it was a rough weekend for
[00:09:27] everyone no one's up I don't
[00:09:34] but yeah I don't know we'll see I'll
[00:09:36] throw out keep ding keep putting out
[00:09:37] different things to see if anybody wants
[00:09:39] to participate but what I think I'm G to
[00:09:40] end up doing maybe I'll open up a few of
[00:09:42] my um I don't know actually I'm not
[00:09:44] going to open anything up here on that
[00:09:46] just because the view of it so I can't
[00:09:48] do that here I'll do that somewhere else
[00:09:49] but uh yeah we'll just keep trying stop
[00:09:53] out for a little while and see how it
[00:09:54] goes still up Benjamin you're still up
[00:09:58] oh that means you've been up all night
[00:09:59] oh that's no good hopefully well
[00:10:02] hopefully it's because you are working
[00:10:04] and you're going to be going to sleep
[00:10:05] sometime soon and not just because
[00:10:07] you've been like awake all
[00:10:15] night oh all right Willie so um when I
[00:10:19] am on um on YouTube here I stream from
[00:10:22] this app from whatnot or another thing
[00:10:24] that I do for streaming um which
[00:10:26] somebody had asked about in the chat
[00:10:27] there that that um pretty much what
[00:10:29] we'll do is we sell packs we rip them
[00:10:33] open and for instance right now like
[00:10:36] these ones I'll put them on and we'll do
[00:10:37] like say we Pi somebody wants to
[00:10:38] participate in this game we do call it
[00:10:41] an adventure game where you can either
[00:10:43] um we have an animated Adventure game
[00:10:45] where what we do is you kind of like try
[00:10:47] to see if you have enough strength where
[00:10:49] you go through these little boxes here
[00:10:50] and you try to see if you don't enough
[00:10:51] strength to beat some of the bosses so
[00:10:54] you go through and you get a plus one
[00:10:55] minus one you play a little bit of a
[00:10:57] game you have some animated Adventure
[00:10:58] here you rip the packs open and that's
[00:11:01] really what it is just a little thing
[00:11:02] that we we sell stuff on whatnot sell
[00:11:05] packs so packs of magic right now um and
[00:11:08] that's kind of what it is here just
[00:11:09] nothing over the top we do this in the
[00:11:11] morning
[00:11:12] generally um on here right now and on
[00:11:15] YouTube You'll see us regularly on here
[00:11:17] so that's what we do yeah well
[00:11:20] Ben I'm sorry that you're still up
[00:11:23] hopefully um it was a reason why you
[00:11:25] chose to stay up and you didn't just
[00:11:27] like couldn't fall asleep type thing
[00:11:31] yeah kind of entertaining we play a
[00:11:32] little bit of a game like you get to rip
[00:11:34] packs open and have the packs being open
[00:11:35] and people get to see packs being open
[00:11:36] and a lot of times people like seeing
[00:11:38] packs being open so that's kind of you
[00:11:40] know how the entertaining aspect of it
[00:11:41] is yeah something to do in the morning
[00:11:44] kind of like put it out there know more
[00:11:47] than one person tell me every morning
[00:11:48] they they they either are watching it at
[00:11:50] work while they're driving to work or
[00:11:54] while they're pooping getting ready for
[00:11:57] work those are the three scenarios
[00:12:00] yes we've got yeah do get a good lot got
[00:12:02] a good good amount of good plls here I
[00:12:03] don't know why I don't know I I haven't
[00:12:06] figured it out yet I feel like it's one
[00:12:07] of those things where we just kind of
[00:12:08] get lucky because my luck is not
[00:12:11] available for me and since I don't have
[00:12:13] any luck it gets passed on to all of you
[00:12:16] now I feel like that is why I feel like
[00:12:18] that's
[00:12:20] why now I do have something I had to
[00:12:22] open today because I want to say a
[00:12:24] little thank you to some streamers here
[00:12:26] that they were nice enough see I had um
[00:12:28] some dice that I bought and they were
[00:12:30] very nice and they got me um they bought
[00:12:33] me some extra Nice Nice Dice and sent
[00:12:35] them to me they're some actually
[00:12:37] gemstone they're actually heavy gemstone
[00:12:39] uh with gold etching on them so when we
[00:12:42] play our games and we have to roll our
[00:12:43] dice in any games I have some cool dice
[00:12:45] to roll
[00:12:46] with and I also
[00:12:49] got this to open here maybe I can get
[00:12:53] some luck with it but I did get a few
[00:12:54] other uh few other things myself little
[00:12:57] bit uh we use these art cards at my kids
[00:12:59] like art draw and stuff so we got some
[00:13:01] of those and they sent me also one pack
[00:13:04] so I figured I was going to wait a
[00:13:05] little bit until maybe one of them shows
[00:13:07] up here and I was going to open the pack
[00:13:08] and see if I got any
[00:13:10] luck based on uh you know being being
[00:13:13] from some people being
[00:13:16] nice you
[00:13:19] know
[00:13:23] yeah um a little bit I haven't played in
[00:13:26] many years I've been actually looking
[00:13:27] into doing the rooll 20 stuff a little
[00:13:29] bit cuz uh I was debating on doing some
[00:13:32] like because people keep telling me I
[00:13:33] should do like a dungeon master be like
[00:13:35] a game master and make the games and
[00:13:37] things because of the games that we do
[00:13:38] right now so that's the reason why I
[00:13:43] uh hav been looking into it a little bit
[00:13:46] but yeah they got me some cool dice
[00:13:47] because I've been playing a little bit
[00:13:48] more and talking about it one of my sons
[00:13:51] like the idea of playing so um yeah
[00:13:55] figured that looking into a little bit
[00:13:57] more and the kids were having some fun
[00:13:58] with it yeah
[00:14:01] let me um put these ones up here see if
[00:14:03] you want to try this adventure game
[00:14:07] out these are going to
[00:14:11] be that if you would like to and they go
[00:14:13] up here for uh that there you should be
[00:14:16] able to see those pop up now you see it
[00:14:17] says 10 the packs plus Wasteland well
[00:14:20] Willie if you were in whatnot it would
[00:14:22] show you like uh you know a price in
[00:14:24] like a an uh in like a uh like a bid
[00:14:29] timer kind of and that's what we do is
[00:14:32] we just somebody wants them we'll end up
[00:14:33] opening them up and then maybe play the
[00:14:35] game where we uh Wander through was and
[00:14:38] as a maybe it's a mutant somebody wants
[00:14:39] to be but it's up to you guys in the
[00:14:42] character choices because currently
[00:14:43] these are going to get you um one and a
[00:14:45] half strength being
[00:14:47] the premium in the Regular
[00:14:51] Pack yeah roll
[00:14:54] 20 really I'd appreciate that I'd
[00:14:58] appreciate that actually actually
[00:15:00] because I haven't had a I've been
[00:15:01] playing I've been playing around with
[00:15:02] roll 20 a little bit but I haven't used
[00:15:04] a ton of it and um like I just like I
[00:15:07] just purchased like the premium version
[00:15:10] because I was thinking of doing like I
[00:15:11] like the idea of doing the maps and
[00:15:12] building the doing it building it myself
[00:15:14] because like how people said I was kind
[00:15:15] of to do a good story so that's why I
[00:15:17] was debating on doing
[00:15:20] that why not do these ones let's see if
[00:15:22] anybody wants this here I know this is
[00:15:24] an interesting
[00:15:26] combination but yeah I'd appreciate that
[00:15:31] oh sweet I'd appreciate that that would
[00:15:32] be
[00:15:34] cool yeah I've had people be like hey
[00:15:36] you should do this you should try doing
[00:15:38] that I'm like oh know I just really do
[00:15:40] this because I was trying to have some
[00:15:42] fun the kids want to play some stuff and
[00:15:44] have some fun with
[00:15:46] it and then PE other people kept saying
[00:15:48] oh you should do this you should do this
[00:15:50] I'm like yeah maybe maybe maybe we'll
[00:15:53] see hey Vias how you doing this
[00:15:56] morning I'd appreciate that I might I I
[00:15:58] might I'll be taking you off on that
[00:15:59] offer
[00:16:01] probably I do very much appreciate it so
[00:16:03] as you see here it shows you a price and
[00:16:05] a timer right now on whatnot so if you
[00:16:07] wanted to jump in and purchase these you
[00:16:09] could purchase those within that time
[00:16:11] frame that's what YouTube's currently
[00:16:12] showing it's a little delayed though but
[00:16:21] yeah yeah yeah stuff like
[00:16:26] that like like I have a bunch oh I
[00:16:29] forgot about I have Boulders like a
[00:16:31] bunch of stuff like like I could open
[00:16:34] like these types of things you know one
[00:16:35] of those as we're going through it D and
[00:16:39] dwise and see what
[00:16:44] happens
[00:16:47] yeah yeah see what we get for a boss
[00:16:49] that we have to go up against type thing
[00:16:52] that's kind of what I was thinking like
[00:16:54] I would do it I was thinking I'd do like
[00:16:55] a patron thing and depending on how
[00:16:57] people want to do it because I'd have to
[00:16:58] pay for the packs in some way you know
[00:17:00] what I
[00:17:00] mean I can't just afford to pay for it
[00:17:04] myself then I can like I can madli the

[00:26:31] got uh total 12 that we were able to
[00:26:34] bring home that were Keepers um then
[00:26:37] then we probably
[00:26:39] caught we probably caught four red fish
[00:26:41] that were would have been Keepers if it
[00:26:43] was in season but because red fish is
[00:26:45] only two
[00:26:48] days do you get the cards what do you
[00:26:50] mean what cards Mora
[00:26:54] setup yes you always get the cards in
[00:26:56] the packs you always get the cards in
[00:26:58] the packs you this pack is guaranteed to
[00:27:00] be yours you never lose those they're
[00:27:03] always guaranteed as
[00:27:07] yours yes so all right so you have a
[00:27:09] couple packs there these will actually
[00:27:11] get you two uh two strength on your
[00:27:13] adventure in the Wasteland here actually
[00:27:15] you know
[00:27:17] what I think this one hold on a second
[00:27:19] give me one second
[00:27:22] here I think that one actually is uh
[00:27:28] yeah that's still two that's still two I
[00:27:30] wanted to check there all right you got
[00:27:31] two
[00:27:33] characters I do not see it recently but
[00:27:36] um I know I saw one I did see one and I
[00:27:38] responded to you a couple times so I did
[00:27:40] see one I don't know if you saw the
[00:27:41] response yet
[00:27:48] house oh hey Willie okay no problem
[00:27:50] where that yeah
[00:27:52] yeah not a
[00:27:55] problem all right so we got this here
[00:27:58] and I'll show you exactly how our little
[00:28:00] wayist L goes and you always keep the
[00:28:01] packs there yeah so yeah so what we're
[00:28:04] going to do is um I'll show you how this
[00:28:07] works all right so Mike you get to
[00:28:08] choose one of your characters this is
[00:28:10] going to start you with
[00:28:12] um two strength for your characters
[00:28:15] since there two of the draft packs now
[00:28:16] the way we do that is you have the I
[00:28:19] mean two of the set packs and um or like
[00:28:21] premium packs and each one of those are
[00:28:22] considered one now you're going to have
[00:28:24] up to 10 of these bosses that you're
[00:28:26] going to go up against but each one of
[00:28:27] these is a plus one or a minus one for
[00:28:31] the green the red box and the blue box
[00:28:33] here and what you do is you see try to
[00:28:36] pull out hopefully where you have enough
[00:28:38] where you have all plus one where you
[00:28:40] have plus five strength to begin your
[00:28:43] adventure and if you can go up against
[00:28:44] the bosses because you have plus five
[00:28:46] strength right now that would allow you
[00:28:47] to beat four out of the 10
[00:28:50] bosses if you wanted to if you were able
[00:28:53] to so with that being said Mike you're
[00:28:55] going to be the
[00:28:56] detective not not bad fistful how you
[00:29:01] been you are a detective wandering
[00:29:03] through this Wasteland and you have H
[00:29:06] now you know where you're going to go
[00:29:07] with these boxes here where would you
[00:29:08] like to go in our boxes right now eight
[00:29:12] across the board I like it that makes it
[00:29:14] nice and easy whoop yep one two three
[00:29:18] four five six seven eight there we go
[00:29:21] take the eighth card from
[00:29:24] that then we're going to do this one
[00:29:26] we're going to take the eighth card from
[00:29:27] here one one two three four five six
[00:29:30] seven and eight the eighth card from
[00:29:31] there nice and easy on that one too then
[00:29:34] we Shuffle up these ones because there's
[00:29:36] only 12 of them and we like to make sure
[00:29:38] that they're shuffled because they're
[00:29:39] always they're kind of visible being
[00:29:41] backwards so I always like to shuffle
[00:29:42] them up all right one two three four
[00:29:45] five six seven eight there you go here's
[00:29:49] the eighth one and then even on the boss
[00:29:51] you said you're going with number eight
[00:29:52] one so we got to give a couple shuffles
[00:29:54] with the bosses then we go one two three
[00:29:58] three four five six seven and eight all
[00:30:00] right so you got all number eight there
[00:30:03] this is what we're going to see what
[00:30:03] happens all right you have your
[00:30:06] character here is a detective this is
[00:30:08] what you chose your character all
[00:30:10] right I know I come on every now and
[00:30:16] again I wasn't on yesterday I went out
[00:30:19] fishing all day it was a good fishing
[00:30:21] day we came home with a well not a boat
[00:30:22] full about 12 fish we all we all got
[00:30:24] some fish to come home with all right so
[00:30:26] you go wandering through this w has a
[00:30:28] detective and you look in the distance
[00:30:30] and you hope for something that you can
[00:30:31] see now with your character those are
[00:30:33] all the things that you can have with
[00:30:34] your character the pluses are minus that
[00:30:36] it occurs you're going and you go and
[00:30:38] you see something in the distance you go
[00:30:39] oh what is this thing over there I
[00:30:42] see
[00:30:44] food and that detective goes walking
[00:30:46] over and oh

[00:31:40] that actually used their detective
[00:31:41] skills Mike and didn't eat the poison

[00:31:46] shall see oh no that thing in the
[00:31:48] distance that you thought was your

[00:34:03] they needed to save these cards from
[00:34:06] 1994 from the movie Maverick they
[00:34:09] thought Maverick was going to be

[00:41:23] written away from Mike first so I don't
[00:41:25] mistake his stuff
[00:41:34] I figured it was just a glitch on my
[00:41:35] side that's why it didn't work well I
[00:41:38] appreciate
[00:41:41] that numbers
[00:41:44] 337 338
[00:41:47] 339 yeah I can take a look I don't those
[00:41:51] are are those the um older original ones
[00:42:00] I feel like those are are they are those
[00:42:01] like the new scolls
[00:42:03] ones yeah no I know I know I'm just
[00:42:06] trying to think of they're the older
[00:42:07] ones okay
[00:42:09] yes I might give me a minute
[00:42:12] actually give me a minute here and I'll
[00:42:15] take a look but let me run another one
[00:42:17] of these uh I'll put another one of
[00:42:19] those out here try a little different
[00:42:21] one and we'll try something here maybe
[00:42:25] um maybe like Outlaws
[00:42:28] and maybe you would like a um stck maybe
[00:42:33] with some
[00:42:34] Wizards in the
[00:42:37] west going with some Wizards in the
[00:42:42] west and then I'm going to do that for
[00:42:46] this here and see if you'd like that try
[00:42:48] that out and this would be if you want
[00:42:50] to do the adventure this would only be
[00:42:51] one strength in the adventure in the
[00:42:54] Wasteland but you could do that if you'd
[00:42:56] like
[00:42:58] I actually think I have them in the book
[00:43:00] right here that's why I saying I think I
[00:43:01] have I think I have it right here
[00:43:02] because somebody had asked about my
[00:43:04] stuff the other day that I have which is
[00:43:06] why I had it out to show
[00:43:20] them um
[00:43:44] no it does not look like I have those
[00:43:49] ones looks like actually I suspect
[00:43:52] actually might have actually sold all of
[00:43:54] my Nas ones I had as duplicates a while
[00:43:56] ago
[00:43:58] I only have the ones that are in my
[00:43:59] decks

[00:44:08] Scrolls ones a couple of
[00:44:10] those but I don't have um I think I have

[00:52:31] I like mutants mutant as you go
[00:52:34] wandering through this
[00:52:36] Wasteland as a
[00:52:38] mutant you see something in the distance
[00:52:41] and you go hm what is that thing I see
[00:52:43] and you go wandering up to that and go
[00:52:45] oh look at roasted
[00:52:46] radstag and he grabs that he starts
[00:52:49] munching away wonderful your mutant
[00:52:52] friend has now gone from three strength
[00:52:54] up to four strength as he wanded through
[00:52:56] this Wasteland going num just munching
[00:52:58] on his little rad stag uh leg there now
[00:53:03] as he goes wandering further munching on
[00:53:04] not really fully paying attention and
[00:53:06] all of a sudden something pops up in the
[00:53:07] distance he goes oh what is that thing
[00:53:10] oh no he's not fully paying attention he
[00:53:12] takes a bite of his food and that Knight
[00:53:15] comes running up
[00:53:17] going
[00:53:19] chops he is scared he drops his food
[00:53:22] doesn't realize that the night was there
[00:53:24] that mutant Ducks luckily doesn't get
[00:53:26] chopped or hit but he does drop the food
[00:53:28] and the Knight goes my food and goes
[00:53:30] watering
[00:53:31] away now luckily that that mutant goes
[00:53:34] that guy's gonna get sick and die soon
[00:53:36] he's got to get rad poisoning I don't
[00:53:38] get rad poisoning That's okay
[00:53:41] though you have an enemy that was no
[00:53:44] good he came up to you to try to attack
[00:53:46] stole your food but you know what maybe
[00:53:50] you'll find a friend in the distance
[00:53:52] here let's find out and it is oh look at
[00:53:55] that your find you find your fungus
[00:53:59] dinosaur comes wandering through the
[00:54:01] wayand going hey buddy jump on my back
[00:54:04] there brings you back up to four
[00:54:06] strength now you're running through that
[00:54:08] Wasteland you see the vault in the
[00:54:10] distance go bring me that Vault over
[00:54:12] there telling your your mutant fungus
[00:54:14] dinosaur and right before you get to
[00:54:16] that Vault though out in front of you
[00:54:18] jumps oh no it is
[00:54:22] saon the dark
[00:54:24] lord being higher strength higher than
[00:54:28] you can uh than you can attack because
[00:54:31] you only have four your fungus dinosaur
[00:54:34] goes I'll take care of this yes your
[00:54:36] fungus dinosaur can talk so Pat he can
[00:54:38] talk says I got this taken care of and
[00:54:41] he goes charging towards Saron and he
[00:54:43] goes you go hide in the vault and your
[00:54:45] fungus dinosaur and siron battle you
[00:54:48] don't even see what happens happens in
[00:54:50] the rest of that battle but you wander
[00:54:51] that Vault you sneak in there to get
[00:54:53] safe from it and you get to be one of
[00:54:55] those golden envelopes there and then we
[00:54:57] get to decide what you want to do with
[00:54:59] this because as you get in that Vault
[00:55:01] you see uh you see those golden
[00:55:03] envelopes and one in one of those who
[00:55:05] knows what it's going to end up being
[00:55:06] something that somebody thought was
[00:55:08] worth saving for all eternity in the
[00:55:10] Wasteland and I believe there's
[00:55:13] like 16 17 left in there I don't
[00:55:18] know that's what we got I'd rebuild that
[00:55:21] one all the time just because it's I
[00:55:22] have a bunch of the packs here and those
[00:55:23] are reusable envelopes and then
[00:55:27] you got your nice one there your Vault
[00:55:29] boy one two three four and five all
[00:55:33] right number five it is right here there
[00:55:36] we go you've gotten that golden envelope
[00:55:39] you want in his mutant you go oh gold
[00:55:41] you pick up go Ah that's not real gold
[00:55:44] oh no then you go and you oh it's an
[00:55:47] envelope and you open you go what do
[00:55:48] they think they needed to save well you
[00:55:51] look at this thing you go what is this
[00:55:52] weird thing from
[00:55:54] 1995 oh
[00:55:56] somebody felt they needed to save some
[00:55:58] Bob Marley Legend
[00:56:01] cards that's pretty intriguing actually
[00:56:04] actually those are kind of cool 50th
[00:56:06] Anniversary Bob Marley cards I don't
[00:56:08] know if you're a Bob Marley fan but
[00:56:09] that's actually intriguing to me I
[00:56:11] didn't know I had those my son's put uh
[00:56:14] built these things there but you should
[00:56:16] see all the random stuff that I
[00:56:21] have they're just random silly packs
[00:56:23] that's all they are like I said I bought
[00:56:25] them in bulk so were just like little
[00:56:27] things that were under under a
[00:56:29] dollar just a little silly extra thing

[01:04:19] I'm also not as young as some of the

[01:04:51] for shipping there all right
[01:04:55] yeah I've had um I've had I've for the
[01:04:57] most part I've never had really any
[01:04:58] issues with shipping unless the package
[01:05:01] was lost in the mail and it wasn't my
[01:05:03] fault like then those were those are
[01:05:05] scenarios where you know I can't do
[01:05:07] anything about that but I try to do my
[01:05:08] best to take care of
[01:05:11] people I've only had that happen twice
[01:05:14] out of over 2,500 orders so that's a
[01:05:17] pretty good
[01:05:20] record all right Willie thank you that

[01:05:24] that too that was aun one I like opening
[01:05:26] uh the uh the secret lar stuff secret
[01:05:29] lar stuff is generally pretty
[01:05:32] fun oh hopefully everything will go well
[01:05:35] for you I I I'll make sure I'll like I
[01:05:38] I've been I've had a pretty good rep
[01:05:39] record with all of our people so like I
[01:05:42] said that was a long time ago too and
[01:05:45] also I think it was before the um the
[01:05:47] people were used to me at the youth post
[01:05:48] office dropping off so much now they
[01:05:50] know me my
[01:05:51] name well they also know me my name
[01:05:54] because uh I appreciate that will I'm
[01:05:57] happy that you had a good time you also
[01:05:59] know me my name because um when they the
[01:06:02] male lady dropped her her her keys in my
[01:06:05] driveway and didn't realize it and I
[01:06:08] brought him back to the post office and
[01:06:10] gave him to him being a nice person like
[01:06:11] you know you're supposed to be and um
[01:06:14] since that point they all recognized me
[01:06:15] because they were like Jesus Christ I
[01:06:17] think that guy just saved us from a
[01:06:18] ridiculously big
[01:06:20] headache because like they have to go
[01:06:22] and change all kinds of things you know
[01:06:25] but I appreciate that that was a lot of
[01:06:26] fun I had a lot of fun with you
[01:06:30] too yeah and I'm going to what I plan on
[01:06:32] doing is I'm thinking of doing some like
[01:06:34] actual D and D games using roll 20 and
[01:06:37] my buddy it looks like a buddy here uh
[01:06:39] from one of the other stream things that
[01:06:40] I used said he may be willing to give me
[01:06:42] a little rundown of
[01:06:44] um of doing um using roll 20 to even do
[01:06:47] it with because I've been debating on
[01:06:49] using that to run him with because I
[01:06:51] thought that would be kind of fun do
[01:06:53] them with like the characters I'd pull
[01:06:54] out characters and you know part
[01:06:55] participate it that way make it you know
[01:06:56] a game that way with
[01:06:59] it I can mad Li the characters with the
[01:07:02] stories and just pull out and and um and
[01:07:05] like i' have we'd have like uh you know
[01:07:07] specific Dungeons and Dragons packs and
[01:07:09] I'd mad lid the characters in there
[01:07:11] based on those packs um that people kind
[01:07:13] of buy into that type of thing and
[01:07:14] that's what I was I thought was kind of
[01:07:16] a cool cool
[01:07:17] adventure that way they we know all
[01:07:19] these packs are G to be open open people
[01:07:21] are going to be getting them they're
[01:07:22] always going to get them it's just
[01:07:23] whether or not they have something helps
[01:07:25] them along the way in their D and D
[01:07:27] Adventure that's kind of what I was uh I
[01:07:29] was kind of planning on doing because
[01:07:31] people seem to think I do a decent job
[01:07:32] mad living things or running through it
[01:07:34] so I'm doing those so I figured might as
[01:07:36] well try it my wife actually when I had
[01:07:39] a dungeon dragons we had EV Forgotten
[01:07:41] Realms dungeon dragons not the commander
[01:07:44] Legends ones uh the other ones and um I
[01:07:47] was able to Mad Li those ones decently
[01:07:48] too because those are like kind of a
[01:07:49] story in and of
[01:07:51] itself I appreciate you coming in Willie
[01:07:53] that was a lot of fun like doing those
[01:07:58] things all right here we go we're going
[01:08:00] to do this try if anybody wants
[01:08:03] these for packs now everybody what I
[01:08:06] have in the buy now you can always ask
[01:08:08] me to do a combo of things on packs you
[01:08:10] don't need to wait for me to put them
[01:08:12] out you don't need to wait for me to say
[01:08:14] it can always be whatever you want let
[01:08:17] me do this too um actually I should
[01:08:19] probably update my other thing quickly
[01:08:22] let me update this quickly so that you
[01:08:24] can see
[01:08:33] this do this that we going to change
[01:08:38] this to what is this one this is going
[01:08:41] to be
[01:08:46] um what do I call that one is Battle
[01:08:48] Boulders gate one
[01:08:52] I clb all right so that's what CB B
[01:08:56] okay ah commer
[01:08:59] bers clb
[01:09:04] set all right now that should be able to
[01:09:06] allow you to see everything a lot
[01:09:12] easier and then I'm going to screenshot
[01:09:14] it like I always do so I can put it up
[01:09:20] there then you can see all the packs
[01:09:22] that I have making it nice and easy for
[01:09:24] you to join in on any adventure
[01:09:29] games there that works out even
[01:09:32] better I always forget to do those
[01:09:35] things well I actually wouldn't have
[01:09:37] forgot to do it if I um if I was here
[01:09:39] early in the morning like I was supposed
[01:09:40] to be I just wasn't up I wasn't here
[01:09:42] like I normally am I was a little late
[01:09:44] getting in because I had to do uh bus
[01:09:46] duty this morning when you have to do
[01:09:48] some things out of the ordinary just
[01:09:49] throws your you know throws your
[01:09:50] schedule off it's not that you're doing
[01:09:51] anything wrong the schedule's thrown off
[01:09:54] all right here we go we're going to do
[01:09:55] our adventure packs put those back there
[01:09:57] we
[01:09:59] go make it a little bigger so you can
[01:10:02] see them so that's all that we have for
[01:10:04] our packs available now you can
[01:10:07] participate in the adventure game if you
[01:10:10] would like yourself now what you would
[01:10:12] do is you would buy in to be the amount
[01:10:14] of the P pack so like say you just
[01:10:16] bought in it would be like a plus one
[01:10:18] just a one for the game at each pack
[01:10:20] that you bought would be on the basic
[01:10:21] but if you wanted a plus one in it for
[01:10:23] your character you would buy one and
[01:10:24] they would give you a plus plus one that
[01:10:25] type of thing I think that's what we're
[01:10:26] going to do now with our adventure here
[01:10:29] because I think that will help out a
[01:10:30] little bit cuz I don't like that we've
[01:10:32] we've had two people run today and we
[01:10:34] haven't gotten to a boss that we had a
[01:10:35] chance of eating I think that's what I
[01:10:37] don't like about this we need a chance
[01:10:38] of beating the boss today so I feel like
[01:10:41] I need to make a little bit of a change
[01:10:42] here so that somebody has a better
[01:10:44] chance to beat the boss because we had a
[01:10:45] good one here and we just had um I feel
[01:10:48] like today is one of those days where we
[01:10:50] need to give a little extra that's all I
[01:10:52] want to give a little extra that's all I
[01:10:54] think what I'm going to do
[01:10:56] so that being
[01:10:58] said let's do this we'll give a little
[01:11:00] extra for our characters we'll call that
[01:11:03] with our characters that way and then I
[01:11:05] think I'll put out I don't know if
[01:11:07] anybody is a fan of these I still keep
[01:11:09] putting them out here I do not have
[01:11:12] Outlaws collectors no um I I I was out
[01:11:16] of those actually I only got three of
[01:11:17] those I opened one for myself and the
[01:11:19] other one I opened and sold off some
[01:11:21] singles uh here and I the uh so and then
[01:11:26] the rest I S then the last one I sold I
[01:11:28] didn't get a lot of it because I didn't
[01:11:29] think it was going to be um that big of
[01:11:32] a hit I was worried about it flopping
[01:11:33] like the last couple that we had and I
[01:11:36] already had a bunch of stock of other
[01:11:37] stuff so I only got some play
[01:11:39] boosters and two play booster boxes and
[01:11:43] three set booster box collector booster
[01:11:45] boxes and I'm out of those right now
[01:11:47] I've been debating on getting some more
[01:11:49] Outlaws but I'm not sure if I want to
[01:11:51] yet if they come into the um if they u i
[01:11:53] just check the distributor that I use
[01:11:55] and if they're available there then I'll
[01:11:57] um I might jump in on a box or two but
[01:11:59] if they're not I don't know if I will
[01:12:01] just um it's one of those just not

[01:15:16] days sometimes I like to up the power
[01:15:19] strength so we can get to a
[01:15:20] boss because if you don't have enough
[01:15:22] chances to get to them we don't always
[01:15:24] get to one so sometimes like to up the

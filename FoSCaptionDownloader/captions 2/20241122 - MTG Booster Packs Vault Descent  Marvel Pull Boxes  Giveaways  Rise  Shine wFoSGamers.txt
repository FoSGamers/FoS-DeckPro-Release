[00:38:25] why Sphinx are forgotten lore
[00:38:28] 51 there you go my friend Sphinx I
[00:38:30] forgotten
[00:38:32] lore oh
[00:38:48] wait there you go my
[00:38:53] friend blow my nose no it's the allergy
[00:38:57] just dries all hell that's what it is I
[00:39:00] can't figure out why it's very
[00:39:08] frustrating N

[00:39:31] we're doing all kinds of
[00:39:35] singles there we go on that you got a
[00:39:39] sword and by the way the reason why
[00:39:40] there's like sword and whatever else in
[00:39:41] there is because it's the game the
[00:39:43] adventure game that we got going on is
[00:39:45] uh available for people if they want
[00:39:48] it and we're going to go those are the

[00:40:48] do I'm going to open up something that
[00:40:51] I've been staring at for a little bit I
[00:40:53] haven't done because I've been staring

[00:41:02] might need to do one now oh look at that

[00:41:07] ago look at
[00:41:09] that Mike gave that to me a while
[00:41:12] back night night so I think I'm going to
[00:41:15] put that over there for a second I might
[00:41:17] open that in a sec what do you guys
[00:41:18] think you think that's good to

[00:42:05] what we get in that so I wanted I've
[00:42:07] been looking at that one for a little
[00:42:08] bit convert to
[00:42:10] slime I'm going to get your convert to

[00:42:24] did you open your bundle on release
[00:42:28] yeah the bundle has a couple of things I
[00:42:30] we opened one for I think I opened one
[00:42:32] for someone and there wasn't like
[00:42:34] anything Giant in it there wasn't
[00:42:37] anything Giant in it so let's see if we
[00:42:40] get any better luck with this one maybe
[00:42:41] we're going to zoom out a little
[00:42:44] bit all right we'll run that
[00:42:47] again I'll get to the giveaways here in
[00:42:49] a
[00:42:50] minute cuz I mooved this I had to move
[00:42:52] some stuff around and when I touched
[00:42:53] this box I was like oh this box feels
[00:42:55] pretty good and that's why I left it on
[00:42:57] the top and I was like uh you know what
[00:42:58] I feel if I know if we don't do this in
[00:43:00] something I might need to open it and
[00:43:02] see if we do have something as good as I
[00:43:04] thought like or maybe it's just
[00:43:07] me me believing in things that aren't
[00:43:11] necessary we'll find out oh but the nice
[00:43:13] thing is we get some we get some stuff

[02:30:13] go no worries about it Nate
[02:30:16] cultist I get it I've I've worked with
[02:30:18] banks before I used to work on I used in
[02:30:20] the background I used to work in the
[02:30:21] background with h the software and
[02:30:24] Hardware that managed about anywhere
[02:30:26] from like 25% of US Stock Exchange
[02:30:28] actually it's probably higher now
[02:30:29] because that was years ago and they got
[02:30:30] a lot of big companies on and then um I
[02:30:32] used to do my I did the Asia Pacific
[02:30:34] traffic which was about 30 to 40% of the
[02:30:37] as uh the stock exchange traffic so I
[02:30:40] used to talk to Banks like the CEOs the
[02:30:43] presidents all day long so I understand
[02:30:46] exactly what you're talking about
[02:30:50] I thought my nose was running Nate R
[02:30:59] cultist
[02:31:04] cultist of the
[02:31:07] absolute yeah I used to work with them I
[02:31:09] saw trillions of dollars getting traded

[02:31:27] um they are the banks are definitely
[02:31:29] there they don't care about anything but
[02:31:31] making money and they do some tricks

[02:32:14] it's the higher up people that I'm like
[02:32:16] uh you
[02:32:18] what you're doing
[02:32:21] what but you know when you work with all
[02:32:23] of them it was a couple years I work

[03:25:38] that let's fix that and we're going to
[03:25:41] do
[03:25:42] that there we go that's better let's go
[03:25:46] that Wolverine

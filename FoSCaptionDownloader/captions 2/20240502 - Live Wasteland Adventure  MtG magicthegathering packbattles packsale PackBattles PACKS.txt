[00:34:49] floors have been taken out when it comes
[00:34:51] to um about half of the floors have been

[00:34:56] decent chunk of the seiling wings but
[00:34:58] not a lot of them the mystery bags by

[00:35:27] modern Horizon pre-release with the uh
[00:35:30] pit boy with the collector booster of

[00:35:35] um four fallouts in there there's four
[00:35:39] Commander Masters in there there's still
[00:35:42] probably like five homand in there and
[00:35:44] there's still probably seven or 10 lost
[00:35:47] Caverns xon collector boosters in there
[00:35:50] most of there's a lot of been pulled out
[00:35:51] or the sets of L CERN excellent sets for
[00:35:53] some reason and uh and Mysteries weirdly
[00:35:57] so there's been a lot of the ceilings
[00:35:59] that are still left in those Mysteries
[00:36:01] if you want to jump in on those and then
[00:36:03] we have our adventure game here we've
[00:36:04] been doing for those of you that want to
[00:36:06] jump in and play it now you just buy up
[00:36:07] your packs and the way we do it we open
[00:36:09] our pack up and if you happen to get a
[00:36:11] Mythic that actually helps you in your
[00:36:12] character and your adventure but I'll
[00:36:14] throw those back up there for
[00:36:17] you we're going to get rid of our
[00:36:19] mystery packs we'll put our character
[00:36:20] back there and if you guys want to jump
[00:36:22] in you can but I think I'm going to keep
[00:36:24] looking through these here as I've been
[00:36:27] kind of doing this morning with you all
[00:36:28] and see if um cuz I want to get these
[00:36:30] into sleeve so I can play with my family
[00:36:32] here and I've been uh we've just been
[00:36:34] really busy and haven't had a chance to
[00:36:35] do anything so I figured maybe while I'm
[00:36:37] on here and things are going slow you
[00:36:39] guys might want to take a look at some
[00:36:40] one of these sorcery cards look like cuz
[00:36:42] we do have sorcery beta if you want
[00:36:44] which is all these cards just not the um
[00:36:46] not the not the um the decks I do not
[00:36:50] have the decks I do have a bunch of the
[00:36:51] boxes though people want
[00:36:53] that but I like the art on this stuff so
[00:36:56] much and I think that's what's patching
[00:36:57] me
[00:37:00] off like the art on it is really nice
[00:37:03] makes me it's it's like an it's actually
[00:37:06] like human made art to me versus like
[00:37:08] computer generat and I think that might
[00:37:09] be why maybe that's what it is I'm
[00:37:12] liking the human made ART versus the
[00:37:14] computer generated and I do like
[00:37:16] computer generated stuff but I think
[00:37:17] that's uh that's very good for like like
[00:37:19] the video games and things like you make
[00:37:20] a video game or something like that or a
[00:37:21] game of some kind something that needs
[00:37:23] to be
[00:37:25] animated cone of flame oh man
[00:37:27] interesting one
[00:37:28] there interesting how that one choose a
[00:37:31] direction huh that's what that mat has
[00:37:34] to do with now all right mat makes more
[00:37:36] sense so remember everybody you can all
[00:37:38] jump
[00:37:40] in and uh try your luck on some of the
[00:37:43] uh packs there if you'd like bid up to
[00:37:45] what you'd
[00:37:46] like and the way we do that is uh you
[00:37:48] just kind of buy to what you want for
[00:37:50] your packs there and then what we do
[00:37:51] from that point forward is uh we open
[00:37:55] that pack up we see if you happen to
[00:37:56] have a myth or more in there depending
[00:37:58] on the type of pack you open and if you
[00:38:00] happen to have a Mythic it'll give you
[00:38:02] one extra either health I mean a hit
[00:38:05] point or maybe um like something else

[00:40:00] might be near and I don't open this all
[00:40:02] that much for me to know so let's
[00:40:07] see
[00:40:09] number 32 we're going to first
[00:40:14] is right
[00:40:19] here well I knew I had an EMA booster in
[00:40:22] here for a reason you got a lion Sash
[00:40:26] and an EMA booster I knew I had one left
[00:40:29] over somewhere EMA
[00:40:33] booster and then number
[00:40:36] 60 is on the next
[00:40:39] page OH Close was it's a birds of
[00:40:42] paradise foil
[00:40:44] retro with uh we don't have Infinity so
[00:40:47] that will end up being a couple of
[00:40:51] options I'll give you here but then you
[00:40:53] have the LCI draft with
[00:40:56] that let me get those out
[00:40:59] here there you

[00:41:23] your choices that you're going to get
[00:41:25] for Infinity

[00:41:58] which would be like two of those two
[00:42:01] stricks two loss Cavern set two Outlaws

[00:42:07] Ravnica you can get a
[00:42:10] sorcery modern Horizon a double Masters
[00:42:14] or a Time spiral because I am out of the
[00:42:17] infinity collector booster that's why
[00:42:18] I'm giving you those options there if

[00:42:36] ran out of those and I've been trying to
[00:42:40] sometimes I uh I forgot I had some of
[00:42:41] those in the other games here but we
[00:42:43] give options of different ones whenever
[00:42:46] that happens and nobody's ever really
[00:42:47] had a problem with that so far if
[00:42:49] somebody does I will always cancel the
[00:42:51] order to if you'd like
[00:42:54] also you want two Wilds two
[00:42:58] Wilds two Wilds of drain set instead of

[00:51:52] had one person send me a picture saying
[00:51:54] this is what happened to my package I'm
[00:51:55] like well that's good that I packaged it
[00:51:57] up so good because if not you probably
[00:51:59] would have lost every single card
[00:52:01] instead of having just uh the package
[00:52:03] ripped open by being run over by a
[00:52:05] truck he's like yeah well didn't really
[00:52:07] respond to that one but kind of proved a
[00:52:09] point I think that was nice of him
[00:52:12] though we got that one we're going to
[00:52:15] run another a rerun our adventure game
[00:52:17] now for those of you that don't know
[00:52:18] what the adventure game is you bid up to
[00:52:21] your packs that you want at the top
[00:52:23] there and currently our characters are
[00:52:25] what you see right right here we have
[00:52:28] four characters and we are currently in
[00:52:29] a city in our adventure in our Wasteland
[00:52:32] and we're traveling through the city
[00:52:34] with those four characters now what you
[00:52:36] would do is bid up to whatever you want
[00:52:38] so this would just be you become a
[00:52:39] character choose what character you want
[00:52:41] and in that City and we wander through
[00:52:42] this is you want to plus one on whatever
[00:52:44] the encounter is and this is you want to
[00:52:46] plus two on whatever the encounter is so
[00:52:48] you just go through being part of our
[00:52:49] character in the city here and we'll see
[00:52:51] what goes on and I'm going to add to our
[00:52:53] giveaway now let's see what I can add to
[00:52:55] our giveaway think I'll do that here
[00:52:58] let's

[00:53:07] add let's see what's this
[00:53:12] here no no no not
[00:53:15] that not those not those what are these
[00:53:18] ones
[00:53:25] here maybe
[00:53:27] maybe a few of
[00:53:30] these let's do
[00:53:33] that let's do some of these let's add a
[00:53:35] couple of these things in here I let
[00:53:38] give you a couple rares of some
[00:53:39] [Music]

[00:58:53] lovely dog loves you
[00:59:03] and uh
[00:59:05] hopefully you're going to have some fun
[00:59:07] hanging out with us so what we're going
[00:59:08] to do here
[00:59:14] is what in the [ __ ] just
[00:59:23] happened what the [ __ ] just happened why
[00:59:26] drip disappear
[01:00:07] [Music]
[01:00:27] hey am I back guys can you see
[01:00:33] me all right that should be better
[01:00:36] now
[01:00:37] Jesus drip just completely disappeared
[01:00:40] on my computer on on like the whole
[01:00:42] screen disappeared that was so weird can
[01:00:45] you guys hear me the whole freaking
[01:00:46] screen just my whole web browser closed
[01:00:49] I [ __ ] hate Mac I need to go through
[01:00:51] this Mac and figure out what's going on
[01:00:53] it's telling me this everything is full
[01:00:55] even though I deleted everything on my
[01:00:57] computer and there's nothing there but
[01:01:00] it's still telling me the hard drive is
[01:01:01] full so I'm like I'm I freaking hate Max
[01:01:05] I hate Max so much hate Max so
[01:01:10] much so I think what was going on I was
[01:01:12] trying to sync my Google Drive to it
[01:01:14] which obviously has two terabytes of
[01:01:16] data and can't fit on it so I told it
[01:01:18] not to and it still kept trying to do it

[01:03:58] um sweet
[01:04:00] bage is going to hang out with the dog
[01:04:03] Englebert and evilin go
[01:04:07] in as they wander in you see a bunch of
[01:04:10] things in there see clothing all over
[01:04:13] the place you see like little space
[01:04:15] rocket ship toys more like a souvenir
[01:04:19] shop but behind the counter there's a
[01:04:22] bunch of lock boxes and in those locked
[01:04:24] boxes there's pretty much an infinite
[01:04:26] amount of ammo there's also a
[01:04:30] shotgun you see in a case you also see a
[01:04:34] long sword you also see some leather
[01:04:39] leather armor that has metal on it so
[01:04:43] it's like kind of leather and metal
[01:04:44] armor so it gives you a little bit extra
[01:04:46] Health extra Health on that and you also
[01:04:49] see um a bunch of stem
[01:04:52] packs now go up to the counter and you
[01:04:54] go hey uh can I get some of this stuff
[01:04:57] behind the counter what do you want to
[01:04:59] get in this adventure our buddies those
[01:05:02] playing our adventure game or hanging
[01:05:04] out with us while we do our adventure
[01:05:07] game remember if you want any of our
[01:05:09] secret layer we do have those over there
[01:05:10] if anybody wants to rip through that
[01:05:12] stuff that is some nice Fallout secret
[01:05:13] layer we got over
[01:05:15] here sword all right you go hey can I
[01:05:17] take that long
[01:05:20] sword uh cuz you know we have our
[01:05:25] sweet bindage is pretty strong there so
[01:05:27] they might be able to hold it you know
[01:05:29] so you ask for that long sword long
[01:05:31] sword's pretty heavy it's only going to
[01:05:32] have to be held by two hands and you
[01:05:34] have to have at least two
[01:05:37] strength to hold
[01:05:39] it so currently angelbert and sweet bage
[01:05:42] are the only ones that could hold it so
[01:05:45] you ask about the sword he goes all
[01:05:46] right yeah that's a nice sword beautiful
[01:05:48] sword that was held by uh sir Knight sir
[01:05:51] Knight Mix A Lot and uh he he was one of
[01:05:54] the greatest warriors in this Wasteland
[01:05:56] right when the bombs drop but for you
[01:05:58] you this sword will be
[01:06:01] 15
[01:06:03] pogs cuz it is good big sword and it
[01:06:06] does
[01:06:10] plus I think it is
[01:06:15] plus plus three on the
[01:06:21] damage so but it has to be held by two
[01:06:23] hands can be has to be swung by two
[01:06:26] hands and a person has to have six
[01:06:29] strength or more do you want to ask
[01:06:31] about any of the other
[01:06:38] weapons or maybe get some ammo for your
[01:06:42] characters I don't
[01:06:45] know anybody else in the Wasteland
[01:06:49] no now all right so what you're going to
[01:06:52] do here I think what we're going to try
[01:06:53] to do is we're going to try to haggle
[01:06:56] Evin has four a lot hey M
[01:06:59] Mite thanks coming in hanging out
[01:07:01] currently if you want to you can jump in
[01:07:03] on this adventure in the Wasteland you
[01:07:05] buy your packs and if you you'll be
[01:07:06] whatever you want for one of the
[01:07:07] characters or you can do a little plus
[01:07:09] one for your encounter or plus two in
[01:07:11] the encounter right now we're trying to
[01:07:13] like stock up in this big city here
[01:07:15] before we head off in the Wasteland for
[01:07:17] our further on an adventure remember we
[01:07:20] have all of our other things too we have
[01:07:21] maybe even the uh the mystery bags if
[01:07:23] you like all that stuff there so we're
[01:07:26] in there we GNA evilin is going to try
[01:07:29] to uh barter negotiate a little bit says
[01:07:33] hey I don't think that sword is worth 15
[01:07:35] that's definitely
[01:07:37] 10 evilin has four lucks so Evelyn gets
[01:07:39] four rolls but remember you can make the
[01:07:42] boss you can make the um shopkeeper
[01:07:44] upset so Evelyn gets a one to five
[01:07:47] chance of convincing him it's a 10 let's
[01:07:49] roll oh six so close you know what you
[01:07:53] know what it might it's not it's maybe
[01:07:55] not 15 but definitely I can't go
[01:07:57] anywhere near
[01:07:58] 10 evilin goes all right you know what I
[01:08:02] will offer you 11
[01:08:04] instead he goes uh let me think about it
[01:08:08] no no no that's still too low still too
[01:08:11] low should we
[01:08:14] try our uh bartering again or do we just
[01:08:18] want to walk away from that and go for a
[01:08:20] different weapon before he gets upset
[01:08:22] anybody here want to
[01:08:23] help or anyone want to buy a pack and
[01:08:25] jump in and take over themselves and be
[01:08:28] the ball be the
[01:08:29] character it's up to you remember our
[01:08:32] giveaway currently are these cards here
[01:08:34] saying thank you for hanging out with
[01:08:37] us I have a cough because of allergies
[01:08:40] right now and I hate
[01:08:42] allergies nasal
[01:08:46] drip all right
[01:08:49] so nothing here we're going to try one
[01:08:52] more
[01:08:52] barter try one more and see what happens
[01:08:55] says you know what I think it's still
[01:08:56] worth 11 and oh look at that we got
[01:08:59] lucky look at that one goes you know
[01:09:02] what the shopkeeper goes you know what
[01:09:04] all right I think I can do 11 for that
[01:09:06] so you give the shopkeeper 11
[01:09:10] pogs shopkeeper gives you that long
[01:09:15] sword who are you going to give the long
[01:09:17] sword to or is it going to go to
[01:09:18] Englebert or is it going to go to uh
[01:09:21] sweet minage everyone
[01:09:27] I'm thinking we send it to Sweet bage
[01:09:29] here just because uh they don't have a
[01:09:33] sword and they had the strength to hold
[01:09:41] it all right I think that's what we're
[01:09:43] going to
[01:09:45] do we're going to go long sword
[01:10:01] long
[01:10:04] sword is a plus three on the
[01:10:07] attack all right we get the long sword
[01:10:09] we gave that to Sweet
[01:10:12] vage he went out the side the store and
[01:10:14] he go you know what you want any of the
[01:10:17] armor do you want uh armor or that
[01:10:20] shotgun there or any of the ammo anyone

[01:10:23] think anyone want to jump in also you
[01:10:26] can also be the character yourself you
[01:10:28] don't need me to be the characters you
[01:10:30] can wander through this and then get to
[01:10:32] the next encounter where you're at a
[01:10:33] boss if you want to do that
[01:10:35] yourself you just purchase up to what

[01:15:05] want any
[01:15:10] uh
[01:15:13] huh
[01:15:15] huh Mindy what are you looking for Derek
[01:15:18] any ideas no nothing any ideas of what
[01:15:21] you want to see right now maybe some uh
[01:15:23] more Adventure game people jump in

[01:15:30] little bit that'll go out for a minute
[01:15:32] there we have our packs let's see what
[01:15:35] else we're going to do maybe we will
[01:15:39] um you know what I might go back to
[01:15:42] looking through my sorcery box here so I
[01:15:46] am actually really excited to play that
[01:15:47] with the family so I think I'll go back
[01:15:49] to looking through that right
[01:15:51] now and if somebody wants to jump in on
[01:15:54] our little Adventure game we can do that
[01:15:56] and play
[01:15:58] it or you can see our packs that are
[01:16:01] easily available to buy too really
[01:16:03] really easy available to buy right there
[01:16:05] so I think we did a little bit of the
[01:16:06] adventure game we'll uh I'm going to go
[01:16:09] back to opening uh sleeving up this so I
[01:16:11] can play it later with my
[01:16:14] family maybe we'll be able to get in and
[01:16:16] play it
[01:16:17] today I don't know I think I have a show
[01:16:19] set today somewhere though I'm not sure
[01:16:22] I feel like I do might have to double
[01:16:24] check that one
[01:16:28] might have to double check that
[01:16:52] one it's weird how stuff is
[01:17:00] that's weird
[01:17:01] whatever I don't care about that my
[01:17:03] computer at work computer just beeped
[01:17:05] weirdly at me but it was saying that uh
[01:17:08] it like charging slow so I'll check that
[01:17:10] later that's weird charging slow all of
[01:17:13] a sudden probably means the thing's
[01:17:18] dying how's it going K good how's your
[01:17:21] morning going I was just going to go
[01:17:24] through and finish sing up the uh
[01:17:26] sorcery cards that I have
[01:17:28] here for uh to play with my family a
[01:17:30] little bit later see if you guys wanted
[01:17:32] to jump in on the Wasteland adventure
[01:17:33] and if you do we'll go through and play
[01:17:35] our Wasteland Adventure a little bit
[01:17:37] more but I figure at least right now I
[01:17:39] can look at some cool art you know while
[01:17:42] I'm getting stuff uh together here cuz
[01:17:45] what we're trying to do here is I'm
[01:17:46] trying to actually get
[01:17:48] rid I'm actually sell most of my store
[01:17:51] out and I think what I'm going to end up
[01:17:52] doing is trying to focus more on doing
[01:17:54] some of the games
[01:17:56] and if anybody wants like say I don't
[01:17:57] know if you guys want like a dungeon
[01:17:59] master or something like that or a game
[01:18:00] master for yourself I was thinking of
[01:18:02] trying to see if anybody want to do that

[01:29:29] on doing um if anybody would like to do
[01:29:31] like a having be like a game master or
[01:29:33] anything like that I actually debating
[01:29:35] on starting and doing like maybe a a
[01:29:36] patron if people want me to do that CU
[01:29:38] people seem to like me doing the
[01:29:39] games see how that goes maybe I don't

[01:29:50] guys get to participate in type
[01:29:52] thing you you just be through Patron I

[01:29:56] something like that maybe along with
[01:29:57] doing our card stuff that I do every now
[01:29:59] and
[01:30:00] again I don't know what do you guys
[01:30:03] think now maybe it's silly maybe it's
[01:30:07] not little Cloud Spirit try it out at
[01:30:11] least figured you know might as well is
[01:30:14] it going to hurt
[01:30:15] anyone not necessarily it's going to
[01:30:17] make something better
[01:30:21] possibly ordinary demon I like that yeah
[01:30:24] then I'll use like the animations we can
[01:30:25] have a live stream I I've been looking
[01:30:27] at roll 20 and stuff like
[01:30:30] that yeah
[01:30:32] exactly exactly like adventuring and d
[01:30:35] and d I've been looking at like roll 20
[01:30:36] and stuff because I think I can set that
[01:30:38] up myself with uh maps and everything
[01:30:40] like that from what I've been seeing and
[01:30:42] I've been debating on using that and
[01:30:44] doing that with um because I've been
[01:30:46] kind of looking at that and building the
[01:30:47] story out building an idea of a story
[01:30:49] out for it um but we uh
[01:30:54] yeah I don't know my wife said I'm
[01:30:55] creative enough so might as well use
[01:30:57] that
[01:30:59] creativity maybe see if anybody wants to
[01:31:01] participate in it I don't know if people
[01:31:04] will but we'll
[01:31:09] see most of the time people have liked
[01:31:11] the game the adventure games that I've
[01:31:12] been doing so I figure that's why
[01:31:13] everyone's like yo you need to do a D
[01:31:15] and D you need to be a dungeon master
[01:31:17] you need to be a dungeon master so I fig

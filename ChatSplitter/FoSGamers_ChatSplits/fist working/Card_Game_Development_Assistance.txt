If I provide you with the card game, a card game that I made, I need you to help me build the actual cards. If I provide you with all, like, the story, the mechanics, the rulebook, and, um, like, symbols, card, um, like, things that need to be on the cards, I already have an image with how I want the card layout to be. All I need to know is the things that need to be on the card so I can put them in the right places. And, um, then also after that we'll figure out what the images look like, uh, on the cards and things like that. Now the symbols should obviously be ones that we've already talked about, so don't generate anything new, just use the ones we talked about. That way I know how to generate the, um, images for them so they're standard across the board. So, um, would you be able to do that for me? I think it's a 260 card, card game. And I provide you pretty much with everything needed except for I need you, I'm at the playtest stage where I need the cards to be built. And I need you to do that for me with all the other information there.

[00:25:42] figure out what's causing the extra uh
[00:25:44] glare there and gujo how's it going my
[00:25:47] friend you like to uh jump in and play a
[00:25:50] game with us today we have our game to
[00:25:52] start out this is a nice fun one a new
[00:25:54] one we have meet yourself an Adel Scout
[00:25:57] Myst is medic wander your way through
[00:26:01] the Wasteland going against your
[00:26:04] different
[00:26:09] creatures but hey it's up to you all if
[00:26:12] you want
[00:26:15] to we have our game to go through and
[00:26:23] play and I think that's it
[00:26:37] trying to think of what time frame to
[00:26:40] start promoting because it's a Saturday
[00:26:43] and in the morning Saturdays are
[00:26:44] generally on a slower one unless you
[00:26:46] have exactly what everyone's looking for
[00:26:48] so you're going to wait for everybody
[00:26:49] all those other people kind of like wake
[00:26:53] up so now maybe we'll uh we'll go
[00:26:57] through ver version of the game here
[00:26:59] we'll test it out make sure it
[00:27:01] works and see if there's any issues here
[00:27:04] maybe that's what I'll do for a
[00:27:07] minute so let's say we do this choose
[00:27:12] a choosing an
[00:27:15] engineer decid you're going to be an
[00:27:16] engineer wandering through all right
[00:27:18] wander through as an engineer first
[00:27:21] thing we're going to start out with is
[00:27:22] we're going to go with the one from the
[00:27:23] basic pull box that's what you guys buy
[00:27:26] you go to the basic pull box you all
[00:27:28] right well within that basic pull box
[00:27:30] you know what let's see what we get in
[00:27:32] here oh we got lucky we pulled out
[00:27:35] in look at that you pulled out a health
[00:27:39] pack wonderful a health pack we like
[00:27:42] Health packs get a health pack let's
[00:27:44] keep wondering you pull anything else
[00:27:46] did you buy anything else another pack
[00:27:47] out of there maybe you did buy another
[00:27:49] pack let's see I think you bought
[00:27:50] another pack you end up getting yourself
[00:27:52] oh look at
[00:27:53] that knife
[00:28:00] nice that's wonderful you keep
[00:28:03] going you encounter oh no you have your
[00:28:08] inventory now
[00:28:10] encounter a Raider what are you gonna
[00:28:13] do you have some stuff in your inventory
[00:28:15] what do you want to do my friends
[00:28:17] there's somebody in here watching I
[00:28:18] don't know if it's uh Me by myself it's
[00:28:20] probably Me by myself and a glitch
[00:28:21] really you get that going you get that
[00:28:24] watching and
[00:28:25] who we're going to do I say we're going
[00:28:27] to use something in our inventory cuz
[00:28:29] you just got some stuff you got a uh got
[00:28:33] yourself looks like you have in your
[00:28:34] inventory a knife I think we should use
[00:28:36] our knife this a good idea let's use the
[00:28:39] knife let's see how that works does the
[00:28:41] knife work do we want to use anything
[00:28:43] else we're gonna say no we're gonna
[00:28:44] leave that and we're going to go against
[00:28:45] it we're going to see what happens oh
[00:28:48] no the enemy is able to defend that
[00:28:52] you're able to miss but by the them
[00:28:54] missing they drop a loot box ooh nice
[00:28:58] but you you do take some damage from the
[00:28:59] enemy they slash
[00:29:01] you now your
[00:29:03] process you go into another loot box and
[00:29:06] you go what are we going to pick from
[00:29:07] let's see here I think I'm going to go
[00:29:10] with the deluxe one today and we get a
[00:29:13] aoria collector booster and assault
[00:29:18] rifle look at
[00:29:20] that that's what you pull out of that
[00:29:22] you go decide to go Deluxe today you go
[00:29:23] oh I like it you got an assault rifle
[00:29:28] we like that for
[00:29:31] defense nice you got some defense in
[00:29:33] this Wasteland Adventure

[00:29:44] jumped in here there's this one just
[00:29:46] hang
[00:29:47] out I think we should use something in
[00:29:49] our inventory again I think it's a good
[00:29:52] idea to uh get something we'd like to
[00:29:55] add something for a minute we're going

[00:48:41] now because we are now on and on our way
[00:48:43] in through the Wasteland here and we are
[00:48:46] currently as a agile Scout wandering
[00:48:50] through this Wasteland now that our
[00:48:52] agile Scout does only have 120 strength
[00:48:55] because he did have he was not as strong
[00:48:56] as anything every other one but you do
[00:48:59] have a lot of damage that you can do
[00:49:01] potentially with your bow starting off
[00:49:03] not anything special but it is a bow and
[00:49:05] being a bow you can always retrieve that
[00:49:08] nice you get to use it over and over
[00:49:11] again so Hill there's your name on your
[00:49:14] stuff there thank you my friend I
[00:49:17] appreciate very
[00:49:20] much where do we want to

[00:49:33] instead let's do the deluxe block maybe
[00:49:36] you want to try some uh maybe you want
[00:49:38] to try
[00:49:42] some uh collector
[00:49:46] boosters that's I Japanese collector
[00:49:48] booster I don't know why I didn't put
[00:49:50] that in
[00:49:53] there I have to add that add
[00:49:59] after but there we go we are currently
[00:50:01] waiting as an agile Scout you're
[00:50:03] wandering around the Wasteland looking
[00:50:04] for different things are you going to
[00:50:05] pick some loot up because this is the
[00:50:07] loot box that was dropped you find some
[00:50:08] things you're looking in the Wasteland
[00:50:11] you did not pick you know you know see
[00:50:12] what happens are you going to pick any
[00:50:14] up as you wander
[00:50:16] through was it going to be maybe you're
[00:50:18] gonna find some ammo I don't know maybe
[00:50:22] maybe you're going to run in and you're
[00:50:24] going to find yourself an assault rifle
[00:50:26] oo
[00:50:28] maybe we can have something in damaged
[00:50:29] that we can
[00:50:41] do it's up to you all if we play it and
[00:50:44] we keep going or we can start over
[00:50:47] because some people like to start the
[00:50:48] game themselves and go from beginning to
[00:50:50] the end because you can do that say you
[00:50:51] just want to go a bunch in the basic box
[00:50:53] and you want to go I want to do like
[00:50:56] know 50 rounds not 50 rounds this I
[00:50:59] think there's only

[00:52:11] again maybe that's what you guys like
[00:52:13] the ultimate the secret layer

[00:59:02] some of it with it anyways all
[00:59:05] right we don't have anybody jumping in
[00:59:07] no matter anyways right now so let's you
[00:59:10] can do
[00:59:11] it I'm gonna run the premium you are
[00:59:14] currently we're GNA run that I'm gonna
[00:59:16] run this in the background and you can
[00:59:18] play currently you are an agile Scout
[00:59:21] you in the moment
[00:59:24] have the option all right we're going to
[00:59:26] have to skip over this here all right
[00:59:28] we're going to have to skip over that
[00:59:29] uhhuh skip
[00:59:31] that so you are going against a small
[00:59:34] Raider right now in your
[00:59:38] inventory you
[00:59:43] have a uh I believe in your inventory
[00:59:46] you have a um critical
[00:59:51] hit what would you like to do
[00:59:58] would you like to use that against your
[00:59:59] ra against your
[01:00:01] Raider use it use the hit all right we
[01:00:04] use the hit we go and attack the Raider
[01:00:07] you hit the Raider oh wonderful the
[01:00:09] Raider Falls and the Raider misses you
[01:00:11] because you hit it first we like it you
[01:00:14] have now hit that small r that
[01:00:17] mediumsized
[01:00:19] Raider
[01:00:20] wonderful with a critical hit you take
[01:00:23] that mediumsized Raider on out knock him
[01:00:26] down and we have progressed through the
[01:00:30] game we're on you are now continuing
[01:00:33] through the game as the agile Scout we
[01:00:36] like
[01:00:38] it we like it
[01:00:46] wonderful
[01:00:49] sure oh going a little slow here
[01:00:53] hanging not sure how it works all right
[01:00:56] so you
[01:00:59] normally just don't want to die so
[01:01:01] normally they buy you'd like buy a pack
[01:01:03] here okay and then when you buy that
[01:01:06] pack what it would do is it would um you
[01:01:09] buy something out of here say for
[01:01:10] instance you bought something out of
[01:01:11] here and you'd go all right it has a
[01:01:13] strict havving pack and then you also
[01:01:15] get a small Health amulet with it small
[01:01:18] Health am with it that small Health that
[01:01:20] you get with it will mean that you get a
[01:01:22] little small Health that you get to add
[01:01:23] to your inventory so that means if
[01:01:25] anything goes goes on in the game and
[01:01:26] you're going before you one of your
[01:01:27] encounters and you want to use that you
[01:01:29] can use that small Health but maybe you
[01:01:31] pull out you're lucky enough where you
[01:01:33] go in one of the weapons and you go into
[01:01:35] say uh the deluxe box and you pull out
[01:01:38] an assault rifle you're lucky then you
[01:01:40] have that to use in your game in the
[01:01:42] Wasteland through as your attack and
[01:01:43] your defend
[01:02:15] all
[01:02:19] righty should have SE a c hit but
[01:02:21] nothing ventured by no no nothing
[01:02:24] ventured nothing gain you don't know cuz
[01:02:25] see you never know you never know
[01:02:27] because exactly who knows what'll happen
[01:02:29] later
[01:02:30] on who knows what will happen later on
[01:02:32] but right now you're wandering through
[01:02:34] you are an agile Scout you luckily have
[01:02:37] only been missed because you killed it
[01:02:39] the first one so you missed again being
[01:02:41] an agile Scout you're able to you know
[01:02:43] Dodge and get away from them and all
[01:02:45] that good stuff there
[01:02:58] but hey why is it going slow like
[01:03:05] that hey this is uh if you go pay
[01:03:09] attention green or ADR if you go on what
[01:03:11] not we play a little game here when you
[01:03:13] pull some stuff and you play a game
[01:03:15] that's what it is now what happens well
[01:03:17] we will wait as we wander through and
[01:03:20] hopefully I was going to throw I was
[01:03:21] throwing out another one here I'm sorry
[01:03:23] I threw that out there and hopefully
[01:03:24] somebody would jump in on maybe like the
[01:03:26] premium box and we would pick something
[01:03:28] up and continue as your character
[01:03:29] through the Wasteland here is what we uh
[01:03:32] we would hope to do so sometimes it goes
[01:03:35] a little slow but every now and again
[01:03:37] what I'll end up doing is we'll wander
[01:03:38] on we'll
[01:03:39] continue and I will end up saying well
[01:03:42] you know we'll continue on and we'll say
[01:03:44] no one's playing we'll see what happens
[01:03:46] maybe we'll get lucky do we want to
[01:03:48] continue on and say we don't have
[01:03:49] anything and just see uh See see if we
[01:03:52] get lucky or do we want to
[01:03:56] it's up to you all now it's uh throw out

[01:06:34] assistance all right let's see what
[01:06:35] happens I guess we'll continue
[01:06:39] on should we continue
[01:06:43] on I guess so we're going to continue on
[01:06:48] we can't do anything no one's here so
[01:06:50] let's see what happens we're going to
[01:06:51] continue on
[01:06:55] and here we
[01:06:58] go got nothing going on here we skip we
[01:07:01] continue on we hit
[01:07:07] we are now going to f encounter one of
[01:07:10] our bosses oh no you continue you see
[01:07:13] you're wandering through the Wasteland
[01:07:14] you've got no one to help you because no
[01:07:17] one has jumped in and participated in
[01:07:19] any of it we have all of our different
[01:07:21] loot boxes
[01:07:26] actually maybe I should put these in as
[01:07:28] buy it
[01:07:33] [Music]
[01:07:42] Nows that's what I'll do so that way
[01:07:45] people can do it whenever they
[01:07:49] want
[01:07:54] instead I'm going to do that instead
[01:07:56] that way you can do it whenever you want
[01:07:58] if you want to jump in you don't need to
[01:07:59] wait for me you can just purchase one of
[01:08:01] the boxes I think that's a better idea
[01:08:03] on my part I didn't think about that
[01:08:11] earlier you
[01:08:14] go there you
[01:08:17] go now they are all in the other
[01:08:20] one they're all is buy it
[01:08:24] now see go and get them whenever you
[01:08:26] want and I'm just going to keep pinning
[01:08:28] them
[01:08:31] aha that works
[01:08:33] better all right so currently you're
[01:08:37] there you're going against oh no the
[01:08:40] Wheeling what are we going to
[01:08:44] do we have to fight it no one has
[01:08:48] assisted us to get any H help here so we
[01:08:51] fight the
[01:08:52] weedling oh no the weedling swing and
[01:08:55] luckily with that first agility misses
[01:08:57] you but you miss the weedling the first
[01:08:59] time the weedling has I think it's 40
[01:09:03] health so you swing in you you shoot
[01:09:06] your arrow you hit the damage for the
[01:09:08] weedling for one but the weedling hits
[01:09:10] you for five what are we gonna do we
[01:09:13] have to keep trying no one's here to
[01:09:16] help so no you got damage all the way
[01:09:21] down your current health you are damage
[01:09:23] probably seven you are now down to 89
[01:09:26] Health but you
[01:09:28] have now made it past the weeding though
[01:09:31] the weeding is
[01:09:33] injured wandering through the Wasteland
[01:09:35] tired is go slinking away you yourself
[01:09:39] are injured yourself wandering through
[01:09:42] and you don't know what to do anymore
[01:09:43] you need some assistance somebody needs
[01:09:44] to come in and help you need to go in
[01:09:47] and find one of those loot boxes that
[01:09:49] are found in the Wasteland go and find a
[01:09:51] loot box and purchase one they're all in
[01:09:54] the buy now
[01:09:56] you should have a basic you have a
[01:09:57] deluxe you have a premium you have the
[01:10:00] ultimate which is the secret layer box
[01:10:03] you guys going to jump in and help our
[01:10:04] character you need to make him get
[01:10:06] safely through we're only on level we're
[01:10:08] only at the first boss there's three
[01:10:09] more bosses there's two more bosses what
[01:10:11] are we going to do we're goingon to make
[01:10:13] it
[01:10:15] through it's up to
[01:10:17] you we need some help but currently we
[01:10:22] have no help
[01:10:25] we've gotten no help so remember
[01:10:29] everybody do check in we're going to
[01:10:31] have to go past no help we go on to our
[01:10:33] next encounter oh no it's a small
[01:10:37] bug all of them if we beat the boss and
[01:10:40] people play through the game I end up
[01:10:42] doing a loop drop at the end which is a
[01:10:45] $1 and uh it's going to either be like a
[01:10:48] secret layer a pack of cards or a
[01:10:50] collector booster pack or something like
[01:10:52] that depending on what it is and it all
[01:10:54] goes down for a dollar as long as people
[01:10:56] you know play through the game
[01:10:58] themselves with a
[01:11:00] uh yeah yeah that that's how it goes
[01:11:02] that's how that's the only way I'm
[01:11:03] allowed to do that so at the end of it
[01:11:05] when you beat a
[01:11:07] boss we do our Loot drop all right is a
[01:11:10] little bit of a deal on it it's pretty
[01:11:12] much what it is all right we're gonna go
[01:11:16] and we go no we don't know what to do we
[01:11:17] have to fight the bug because no one's
[01:11:19] attack no one's helping us you fight the
[01:11:21] bug it is a small one but luckily the
[01:11:23] small bug misses you
[01:11:25] you have a small bug that comes running
[01:11:28] towards you as the Nile
[01:11:30] Scout you dodge that bug the bug Dodges
[01:11:34] you because it's small and your arrows
[01:11:36] miss it you pick your arrow up and you
[01:11:38] continue wandering through the Wasteland
[01:11:39] with your 89 Health hoping that somebody
[01:11:43] comes along and helps you to find a pull
[01:11:46] box one of our loot boxes here in the
[01:11:50] Wasteland let me actually redo this here
[01:11:52] I need to write that one out a little
[01:11:53] bit nicer so you guys can see
[01:12:03] there we go but who wants to let leite
[01:12:06] spider the great ginch how's it
[01:12:08] going we have a new
[01:12:13] game are you going to participate in it
[01:12:15] it's up to you how our progression
[01:12:18] through our adventure goes are we going
[01:12:20] to be having a better chance to beat our
[01:12:22] bosses are we going to be beat by a boss
[01:12:24] I have a suspicion we're going to be be
[01:12:25] beat by a boss just because we don't
[01:12:28] have anyone in here helping us that's
[01:12:31] what my suspicion is but we'll find
[01:12:37] out let's go
[01:12:40] people we'll try it out there I'm going
[01:12:42] to throw out instead we'll throw out
[01:12:44] we'll throw out just the
[01:12:48] basic we'll throw the basic one out
[01:12:51] there here's our basic one maybe you
[01:12:53] want to do that
[01:12:55] all right because we are an agile Scout
[01:12:57] we're wondering what's going to happen
[01:12:59] here now we have all of our packs all of
[01:13:01] our boxes everything's always in view
[01:13:03] there there we
[01:13:05] go now we
[01:13:10] have we going to skip on I guess guess
[01:13:13] we're going have to skip
[01:13:16] on go on and we see oh
[01:13:19] no in front of us it's no good a feral
[01:13:22] ghoul has come you must Dodge that for
[01:13:26] ghoul what are we going to do we have to
[01:13:28] attack there's nothing we can do cuz no
[01:13:31] one has jumped in to help
[01:13:33] us remember you can jump in and buy any
[01:13:36] of those loot boxes that helps
[01:13:38] generate some items for our character in
[01:13:41] the loot
[01:13:43] box pick which one you get will
[01:13:46] help but we have nothing right now so
[01:13:49] we're going to just continue on and oh
[01:13:51] no he luckily the feral gold only misses
[01:13:53] you the feral gold did miss
[01:13:56] you so you go you use your agility you
[01:13:59] keep wandering wandering through this

[01:14:03] you find along the way or maybe an item
[01:14:06] a friend that will help you buy
[01:14:08] something maybe there'll be a person in
[01:14:10] here that'll come in and get that basic
[01:14:12] loot box for
[01:14:14] us that way we can all play and have a
[01:14:18] little extra Health with our character I

[01:20:56] some
[01:20:57] guidance hey cookie how you
[01:21:01] been I've been a little I know I've been
[01:21:03] a little uh not around recently I had
[01:21:05] some
[01:21:07] uh life occurring we'll
[01:21:11] say oh I understand that one I have um I
[01:21:15] my wife dropped some orders off myself
[01:21:17] on her way over to uh her Pilates
[01:21:22] today ah yeah it's just uh work [ __ ]
[01:21:26] getting very stressed out with work
[01:21:27] stuff uh long story
[01:21:30] short I had a real I had probably one of
[01:21:32] the best bosses I've ever had in my
[01:21:33] entire life or my best manager and then
[01:21:36] they happen to get laid off just and I
[01:21:38] think they were at the personally I
[01:21:39] think they were at the top of the level
[01:21:40] because of they always were doing High
[01:21:42] stuff they were always part of team they
[01:21:43] were always like participating the way
[01:21:45] they were supposed to like high
[01:21:46] performing person I think they were at
[01:21:48] like the high and when there was layoffs
[01:21:50] I think they just got were one of the L
[01:21:51] unlucky ones because they were at the
[01:21:53] high and they had to chop
[01:21:55] get rid of money so that being said um
[01:21:59] got a new one beginning of the year and
[01:22:01] that has not gone so well to the point
[01:22:02] that I ended up having to open an HR
[01:22:04] case because uh they flat out lied and
[01:22:07] then uh after harassing me for a little
[01:22:09] while I was like realized they would
[01:22:10] been intimidating me through lying after
[01:22:11] the fact they caught them lying
[01:22:17] once maybe there hiding something my
[01:22:19] boss knew yeah who
[01:22:21] knows maybe he was there for 25 years
[01:22:24] too so I mean it's possible he knew
[01:22:26] something that no one else did but he
[01:22:28] was also a person that was he did he did
[01:22:31] he was actually really good everybody
[01:22:32] else like even when everybody talked
[01:22:33] about him they was like we had to let
[01:22:36] you know we had to let good people go we
[01:22:37] couldn't do anything about it sometimes
[01:22:39] you can sometimes you
[01:22:43] can't but at that point you know I got a
[01:22:46] person and it just hasn't gone
[01:22:48] well had some bad luck that's it I don't
[01:22:51] want to have to do what I did because I
[01:22:53] don't like doing stuff like that i' just

[01:28:14] that I got to get the better picture on

[01:28:37] spelled out with the
[01:28:40] uh when I typed it out Deluxe was saying
[01:28:43] it was spelled right which I didn't
[01:28:45] which why I didn't even check it it's
[01:28:47] one of those things like when you look
[01:28:48] at it it's spelled right and you don't
[01:28:49] check
[01:28:52] it I appreci appreciate it I've never
[01:28:54] been great with the came to

[01:57:08] [Music]
[01:57:16] do Looking Down The Bard
[01:57:20] [Music]
[01:57:33] I am still here that is the biggest
[01:57:36] thing that's what I say all the time to

[01:58:03] stop it's one of those
[01:58:07] things did you die exactly see one of
[01:58:10] the things I always had for my uh my uh
[01:58:14] my kids I say is when they come over to
[01:58:16] me and they're crying or they're like
[01:58:18] they're injured or something I'm like
[01:58:19] are you
[01:58:20] bleeding yes all right is it falling off
[01:58:24] uh no okay are you
[01:58:28] dying no all right
[01:58:32] then all right like control yourself and
[01:58:36] let's figure out what's going on because
[01:58:38] I can't help you when you're freaking

[01:58:59] young yes well now if I do that now I
[01:59:02] get yelled
[01:59:03] at yeah those of those things you get
[01:59:05] yelled at nowadays I used to have to
[01:59:06] deal with a wooden paddle it wasn't a
[01:59:08] wooden paddle it was a wooden spoon SM
[01:59:10] like B yay
[01:59:11] big had a big round head on it you know
[01:59:14] for stirring stirring food in a pot
[01:59:16] that's what I had when I was a kid did
[01:59:18] something wrong you got to watch out for

[02:03:35] some of the
[02:03:37] last oh no yeah yeah we were definitely

[02:03:53] so he didn't have to and he could go to
[02:03:54] sleep you know that type of thing he
[02:03:56] could rest but it was always you know we
[02:03:58] we were I mean I went took my bike
[02:04:01] riding through the woods how many bken
[02:04:03] bones I had from doing that [ __ ] they
[02:04:05] probably thought I was being abused from
[02:04:06] that when I was actually me jumping off
[02:04:08] of a
[02:04:09] [ __ ] rock hitting a tree because I
[02:04:11] thought I could actually hit over the
[02:04:12] freaking hole that was there no no can't
[02:04:14] hit the hole you hit that tree and broke
[02:04:16] your arm
[02:04:24] I did actually I had a a uh a 230 Honda
[02:04:30] 230f I used that thing hauled
[02:04:33] ass so that that was my my mountain bike
[02:04:36] and on my dirt bike when I B dirt bike I
[02:04:38] broke my wrist on my dirt bike I was uh
[02:04:41] going through like I know I'd call them
[02:04:42] like they were I know single single
[02:04:44] track going around and clipped a tree
[02:04:48] too close to it and [ __ ] broke my
[02:04:50] wrist made it all the way back back to
[02:04:52] the [ __ ] house with a broken rist oh
[02:04:53] sorry destroying made it all the way
[02:04:54] back to the house with a broken wrist oh
[02:04:57] nice see I thought about getting another
[02:04:59] one but I I long story short I have had
[02:05:01] a bad surgery and now I can't
[02:05:06] um sit down on him
[02:05:20] [Music]
[02:05:31] [Music]
[02:05:45] [Music]
[02:05:50] yes I I know they weren't they're not
[02:05:52] soft anymore they're hard now see I had
[02:05:54] a r I had a bad like bad surgery and I
[02:05:57] can't sit down anymore just without
[02:05:59] feeling somebody stabbing me in the butt
[02:06:03] but uh that being
[02:06:05] said I I right before that bad surgery
[02:06:08] happened I was actually looking at a um
[02:06:11] was it a
[02:06:13] Honda it was like 280 it was like right
[02:06:15] below 300 maybe it was like was like
[02:06:17] right above 300 wasn't 350 but it was
[02:06:20] like the Enduro one so I could go riding
[02:06:22] around with that I was looking at one of
[02:06:24] those but like just like I said that I
[02:06:26] had that surgery and I ended up not even
[02:06:28] doing that anymore trying to get myself
[02:06:30] away from stuff so that I could do that
[02:06:31] instead of getting onto a boat quicker
[02:06:33] but we ended up trying to push to the
[02:06:34] boat quicker moving onto a boat soon
[02:06:36] that'd be nice trying to find one it's
[02:06:38] the hardest part
[02:06:46] here oh nice
[02:07:11] yeah the aduro one was uh I think that
[02:07:14] one got up like 80 or something that's
[02:07:15] the reason why I wanted it that way I
[02:07:17] can go bombing around the highway at
[02:07:18] least
[02:07:19] 75 to get on somewhere down somewhere
[02:07:22] quickly if I needed to and I could need
[02:07:23] and I needed to get on the highway just
[02:07:25] go boom boom boom back on and off but
[02:07:27] that was more just like if I was trying
[02:07:28] to get somewhere to a
[02:07:40] trail
[02:07:43] but oh yeah it was way better than my
[02:07:46] Jeep Gladiator well that's actually why
[02:07:48] I got a um I have a one wheeel I roll
[02:07:50] around on now when it's anything near
[02:07:52] that's within 30 miles and I don't need
[02:07:54] to like get there super fast I do it now
[02:07:57] that
[02:08:09] way I think it was like what 60 to 80
[02:08:12] miles a
[02:08:15] gallon I don't watch the years now it's
[02:08:17] probably like 100
[02:08:19] now but yeah the uh my one wheel goes
[02:08:21] like 20 M an hour so good enough to get
[02:08:24] two and from stores that might take me 3
[02:08:26] minutes longer to four minutes longer if
[02:08:28] I'm going to like grab food but it's not
[02:08:31] that big of a deal it's more fun roll
[02:08:33] around on
[02:08:36] skateboard yeah yeah you've seen those
[02:08:38] things if you've seen those yeah the one
[02:08:40] wheeel yeah goes like 30 20 20 21 miles
[02:08:44] hour I think I that fast I've really got
[02:08:46] it about 30 miles supposedly I've only
[02:08:47] only gone like 20 miles at the most with
[02:08:49] it before I charge it
[02:09:09] yeah yeah I have uh I've seen proba with
[02:09:10] one one
[02:09:12] longboards the uh I there's a guy down
[02:09:15] uh I went to this thing a couple years
[02:09:16] ago in Miami and there was a guy that
[02:09:18] had an electric longboard down there
[02:09:19] that was pretty fun rolling around on
[02:09:21] that thing he I got to try that out it
[02:09:23] wasn't as it wasn't the same wasn't my
[02:09:25] my type of my cup of tea but I can see
[02:09:29] it being fun though for people that do
[02:09:31] that like I used to snowboard and I can
[02:09:33] see if I had done that versus picked up
[02:09:34] the one wheel at first I might have
[02:09:35] liked
[02:09:41] it hey simy how you
[02:09:44] doing just hanging out chatting you want
[02:09:46] to jump in play the game you can this is
[02:09:49] our adventure game we do have it going
[02:09:51] it is an animated one which is fun you
[02:09:54] get to be any of our characters maybe
[02:09:56] want to be a scout H strong human maybe
[02:09:59] you're just G to be an intelligent
[02:10:00] engineer maybe a mysterious medic I
[02:10:03] don't know it's your
[02:10:16] choice it is pretty fun and this is our
[02:10:19] new version to because even you know we
[02:10:21] still have the old one if people really
[02:10:23] wanted to play the old one or you know
[02:10:25] you go around you can be like that one
[02:10:27] there but this is a little bit of a new
[02:10:28] one here I
[02:10:37] thought going to get some more
[02:10:39] characters some more interactions and
[02:10:41] maybe uh maybe you find some things like
[02:10:43] a plasma rifle in the deluxe box or the
[02:10:46] ultimate box where you maybe find some
[02:10:49] ammo that gets picked up along the
[02:11:07] away I know it's a new one that's why I
[02:11:10] have four different boxes I actually
[02:11:12] haven't been doing pull boxes for a
[02:11:14] while so I made sure I have them all set
[02:11:16] up here they are set up accurate with
[02:11:20] everything well that's not
[02:11:22] right well it is
[02:11:33] right and the boxes will be um updated
[02:11:37] as it goes to so we'll end up throwing
[02:11:39] it as like a you know a different one
[02:11:41] there
[02:12:09] there you go
[02:12:25] yeah I'm trying to make it so my goal is
[02:12:28] that I'll have all these games that I
[02:12:29] have with all the
[02:12:31] animations um I'll have like I'm G to
[02:12:33] end up building a website where you can
[02:12:34] buy some of my stuff and get through it

[02:20:40] here yeah I know guys are selling two
[02:20:42] weeks so I know that's nuts that's a
[02:20:44] crazy thing too that's what I mean like
[02:20:46] for me it it just
[02:20:47] uh I can't do anything about it myself
[02:20:50] so I'm just going to go about it you
[02:20:51] know
[02:21:24] an empty tank but hey at least I try to

[02:21:41] see that one that was a character you
[02:21:43] were not supposed to see
[02:21:48] yet Maddy bear Drew how's it going
[02:21:52] everyone it's up to you how our day
[02:21:58] goes
[02:22:01] [Music]
[02:22:08] alone yes see I have zero problems when
[02:22:12] so like pre-release is not even supposed
[02:22:14] to be now it's pre-releases is supposed
[02:22:16] to be next
[02:22:17] weekend that's screwing those lgs's at
[02:22:20] least let every have everybody before if
[02:22:23] anything is before pre-release those
[02:22:25] people should get in
[02:22:26] trouble my opinion but I that's not
[02:22:29] that's also my opinion too you
[02:22:37] know so hey what can you do
[02:22:50] what can you
[02:22:57] do some people get it early and they had
[02:23:00] like and they just they make their money
[02:23:01] off of it you know and that's what it is
[02:23:02] and um then you know that hype they get
[02:23:04] that hype money which they sell a pack
[02:23:06] of cards at $7 for like $90 or they sell
[02:23:09] 13 pack of cards for 15 $50 you know but
[02:23:13] that's their
[02:23:15] perogative some people can't wait and
[02:23:17] they want to spend the money on it and
[02:23:18] that's okay that's other people's
[02:23:19] choices too I can wait personally I've
[02:23:22] always I was a person that was uh my put
[02:23:24] it this way my my wife went and grabbed
[02:23:26] her packages and Shu them shook them at
[02:23:28] Christmas I just like like there's a
[02:23:30] package there I didn't know there's a
[02:23:31] package there for me I'll find out on
[02:23:36] Christmas I'm Different a different
[02:23:38] person I I guess I'm broken in some ways
[02:23:40] I was told which is intriguing so one of
[02:23:43] the funniest things recently is my wife
[02:23:44] said that I'm broken because um I cannot
[02:23:47] react to like pain if I want to I I can
[02:23:50] stop reacting to it so for instance the
[02:23:53] other day like she was uh like poking at
[02:23:55] me and I was like oh that hurt or like
[02:23:57] she Pok somewhere like like trying to
[02:23:58] tickle or whatever like no like she's I
[02:24:01] was the acting TI she's like oh you all
[02:24:03] like like I'm not if I if I want to she
[02:24:05] no you can't I can make you take aish
[02:24:07] every time and she tries to do it and I
[02:24:09] just had no reaction because my point is
[02:24:11] if you know what's going on you should
[02:24:13] be able to control yourself cuz you
[02:24:15] literally know what's
[02:24:17] occurring it's like you know you got to
[02:24:19] cut on your arm it's
[02:24:21] cut what are you going to do about it
[02:24:23] other than make it worse by freaking out
[02:24:24] and possibly flaing your arm around so
[02:24:26] you look at it you go wow my arms cut
[02:24:28] open control it yes that's pain that
[02:24:31] hurts like a mother now I need to do
[02:24:33] something about it let me get something
[02:24:34] taken care of
[02:24:36] versus and all it's bleeding all over
[02:24:38] ripping and it's
[02:24:41] worse yes I used to be a fomo person too
[02:24:45] patience is uh patience definitely a
[02:24:47] virtue
[02:25:00] I feel
[02:25:03] o all right
[02:25:09] [Music]
[02:25:28] [Music]
[02:25:31] all right here we go
[02:25:36] [Music]
[02:25:43] [Music]
[02:26:06] [Music]
[02:26:17] feel
[02:26:27] okay well anyways we have our game if
[02:26:29] you want to I've had it already set up
[02:26:31] here and I'm just waiting on if you want
[02:26:33] to
[02:26:35] play yeah it's one of those things like
[02:26:37] I I understand people wanting it
[02:26:40] but
[02:26:43] yeah hey that's good for those people
[02:26:47] that have it though it's good for those
[02:26:48] people that have it I'm not not going to
[02:26:50] knock them CU I would do it myself
[02:26:53] probably if I had the opportunity I'm
[02:26:55] not going to lie it's a good chance I
[02:26:56] would do it myself just because I'd be
[02:26:58] worried i' want to make the best most
[02:26:59] money I can you
[02:27:01] know that's the thing that sucks is by
[02:27:03] the time I get it I'm stuck to uh
[02:27:06] everybody's already bought it and they
[02:27:07] have no money
[02:27:16] left which is why I need to get a store
[02:27:19] option my myself so I can have a
[02:27:21] physical location and then run
[02:27:29] it then I can get everything
[02:27:33] [Music]
[02:27:43] better
[02:27:47] righty no
[02:27:52] [Music]
[02:28:12] yeah I know well I bought it already um
[02:28:15] I already have it bought at a a good
[02:28:17] price it's just uh the amount that I
[02:28:19] bought feel like sometimes I kick myself
[02:28:21] cuz I don't have it early enough for
[02:28:22] everyone else like everyone else gets it
[02:28:24] and then I'm like [ __ ] I get stuck with
[02:28:26] it but I was I was thinking this is
[02:28:28] going to be a little slim pickings like
[02:28:29] the modern Horizon is uh like Fallout
[02:28:32] was so that's why I did it this
[02:28:40] way player SL player
[02:28:46] BS H galan's Noob how's it going
[02:28:51] hopefully you're having a good
[02:28:58] one yeah that's what I heard they're
[02:28:59] going to be similar to Fallout and if
[02:29:01] they are that's GNA be nice because I
[02:29:03] end up somehow getting 12
[02:29:05] boxes I actually might even be able to
[02:29:07] get
[02:29:17] more yeah
[02:29:20] good
[02:29:40] charot life that's what I'm told
[02:29:51] me jail cell
[02:30:00] [Music]
[02:30:08] Penitentiary I don't want to say
[02:30:17] yo yep exactly which is why I tried
[02:30:22] to not buy as much as I I used to I used
[02:30:25] to get it quicker and earlier but things
[02:30:28] have been a little uh not so efficient
[02:30:30] recently and I'm just kind of stuck with
[02:30:33] stuff which sucks but
[02:30:37] hey yeah it's going too I'm B I'm
[02:30:39] betting it
[02:30:46] will I'm guessing going to be stuck with
[02:30:48] stuff again like I have been
[02:30:54] select inventory as use
[02:30:58] use oh
[02:31:03] wow that's pretty funny they're going to
[02:31:05] ban the top 12 cards out the deck the
[02:31:07] whole set
[02:31:28] oh that's insane I hav't even looked at

[02:56:19] way so that when you're chatting I tell
[02:56:20] you what to do for a command and it'll
[02:56:22] put everything up automatically for you
[02:56:25] that's actually my goal but that is a
[02:56:27] lofty one that will take some time

[03:16:54] an intelligent engineer who has an
[03:16:57] intelligence
[03:16:58] booster wandering through the Wasteland
[03:17:00] here we're looking to see if we can find
[03:17:02] any boxes you guys are G to find a loot
[03:17:05] box somewhere and are you g to pick up
[03:17:07] the character when you find that loot
[03:17:08] box I don't
[03:17:11] know you see everything that's in all of
[03:17:14] those that's why I made them I made them
[03:17:15] very clear they're just really for the
[03:17:17] most part to be able to give you the
[03:17:19] loot based in the game it's a way for
[03:17:21] you to get loose from the game it's what
[03:17:23] it
[03:17:35] [Music]
[03:17:36] is we're playing an interactive
[03:17:42] [Music]
[03:17:45] game there we go
[03:17:51] [Music]
[03:17:55] go we're going to put out um the deluxe
[03:18:00] let's put the deluxe
[03:18:04] out do a little Delux herley
[03:18:17] keep
[03:18:27] it now I've been debating on letting
[03:18:30] people play the game longer you just
[03:18:32] don't have
[03:18:40] inventory what do you
[03:18:43] [Music]
[03:18:45] think yeah can keep playing until the
[03:18:47] next person jumps
[03:18:52] in that way you can kind of like play
[03:18:55] through until we get to a boss at the
[03:18:57] most you can do the
[03:19:01] boss what I think I think that's not a
[03:19:03] bad
[03:19:15] idea yeah anyone else can jump in yep
[03:19:18] definitely I'm just trying to get things
[03:19:21] going here trying it out playing

[03:29:50] with your intelligence booster good job
[03:29:53] William oh yes now now we're g to
[03:29:57] continue on if you guys want to jump in
[03:30:00] the game you get to
[03:30:01] play you get to roll again to see which
[03:30:04] box you're gonna pull from since we
[03:30:05] don't you're not pulling one come in
[03:30:06] here yeah just roll right there oh here
[03:30:08] make sure it stays up on front number
[03:30:11] one all right you get a basic we're
[03:30:13] going with a basic now roll again on the
[03:30:15] other one
[03:30:17] to see what you get six yep you got a
[03:30:21] knife all right you've got yourself a
[03:30:23] knife good one
[03:30:25] William all right as you go basic huh do
[03:30:29] I pull from the basic no we already did
[03:30:31] that that's what we did we had you we
[03:30:32] had you roll and I had you roll a random
[03:30:35] one to pull a number here and they would
[03:30:36] generally pull from here which would
[03:30:38] give it to them but because you're doing
[03:30:40] it this way I'm having you roll so you
[03:30:41] don't touch the box that's why oh make
[03:30:44] sense okay see how the numbers are right
[03:30:47] there and space so much's in there I'm
[03:30:48] just having roll so you don't touch the
[03:30:50] boxes and the boxes stay the same they
[03:30:52] don't get adjusted that's why all right
[03:30:54] so right now you're GNA have to go on to
[03:30:57] the next thing you have picked up that
[03:30:59] weapon you go on to a mediumsized bug
[03:31:02] what are you gonna do William with this
[03:31:03] mediumsized bug uh stab it there's a
[03:31:06] mediumsized bug oh you want to try to
[03:31:07] stab it all right you
[03:31:11] use your knife to try to stab it
[03:31:16] and you hit the Knight you hit him you
[03:31:17] stab it with seven damage but the medium
[03:31:19] bug hits you oh no what are you g to try
[03:31:23] this time uh intelligence booster

[03:31:28] used it oh uh you assault rifle Assault
[03:31:32] assault rifle Assault
[03:31:35] Rifle you defeated the medium bug
[03:31:37] wonderful you hit him for three damage
[03:31:40] you've defeated the medium bug an
[03:31:42] intelligent engineer no wandering around
[03:31:44] you find some ammo on the ground for a
[03:31:46] pistol wonderful now let's see are we
[03:31:49] going to continue on let's see what box
[03:31:50] you pull out of here now remember
[03:31:52] anybody guys can jump in whenever you
[03:31:54] want one a basic let's see what we get
[03:31:56] out of the basic
[03:31:58] one six six again we get another knife
[03:32:01] you got two knives will I guess you have
[03:32:03] a couple knives the next boss can we go
[03:32:05] like that I don't think you can use both
[03:32:07] we haven't tried that yet we'll have to
[03:32:08] build that in we'll have to build dual
[03:32:09] wielding in at some
[03:32:11] point all right you are going to fight a
[03:32:13] feral ghoul do you want to use anything
[03:32:15] in inventory hold on is this a feral
[03:32:18] ghoul yes feral
[03:32:20] ghoul uh shoot it with the rifle you
[03:32:22] going to shoot it yeah you're gonna use
[03:32:24] your assault rifle you shoot it you hit
[03:32:27] the aeral ghoul only for one damage but
[03:32:29] it hits you for nine damage oh no will
[03:32:32] what are you gonna do stab it you gonna
[03:32:34] try to stab it you're gonna try to stab
[03:32:36] it in the heart you go after its heart
[03:32:38] with a
[03:32:43] knife you hit it
[03:32:46] interesting d8 to the side the
[03:32:50] box that way it gives him multiple
[03:32:54] choices all right
[03:32:59] D20 for what is in there all right
[03:33:09] D20 d a
[03:33:12] D20 choose a pack d8 decide the Box
[03:33:16] D20 to choose one out of eight all right
[03:33:19] d8 d8 is here for choosing that works
[03:33:23] there all right then we do the said the
[03:33:27] 20 you're
[03:33:30] thinking thinking a
[03:33:35] 20 and a 10 choose a pack 20 and a 10
[03:33:38] how would you use a 10 I'm trying to
[03:33:40] figure out the 10
[03:33:46] trying to figure out how to use the 10
[03:33:48] One D number wait Daddy
[03:33:53] watch oh pack number all right I get
[03:33:56] what you're saying I get what you're
[03:33:58] saying well there's only seven of them
[03:34:00] in
[03:34:01] there um that's not the same it's just
[03:34:05] bu there's only seven options in some of
[03:34:07] them and six in the others so that's why
[03:34:08] we were doing the other way so that
[03:34:10] makes sense though the 20 if it's oh it
[03:34:13] hits zero and it's 10 zero what do you
[03:34:15] mean is 10 yes 10 if it's zero is 10
[03:34:18] that's correct so this would go one
[03:34:20] through eight on this for any of these 1
[03:34:22] through two 2 through three two three
[03:34:24] four five yeah that type thing no then
[03:34:28] you put um then this one will be we roll
[03:34:31] This for our um picking the pack there
[03:34:34] which would
[03:34:36] be once we roll out we find the box then
[03:34:40] we find what's in the box by using this
[03:34:48] because it's one out
[03:34:50] of one out of six to eight so we'll use
[03:34:53] this one here
[03:34:55] actually actually we can use the same
[03:34:58] one the d8 twice actually we can use the
[03:35:01] eight multiple
[03:35:03] times we can actually just use the eight
[03:35:05] multiple
[03:35:08] times and if there's a six I'll take the
[03:35:10] six out the wrong one right here you put
[03:35:12] in the wrong one put it in the next spot
[03:35:14] then yeah
[03:35:16] supposed to go this supposed to go there
[03:35:18] yeah okay thank you there we go we'll
[03:35:21] use that when we come up with a six and
[03:35:22] we'll use that for when we have the
[03:35:23] eight one we just not use eight there
[03:35:25] you that'll work that'll work all right
[03:35:28] so you have we're currently up against
[03:35:31] um that would you like to try anything
[03:35:33] else you got one more thing you the
[03:35:35] veral ghoul another knife you gonna try

[03:56:15] [Music]
[03:56:19] thank you Oblivion I very much
[03:56:20] appreciate that sometimes people are a

[03:56:52] because people have it already yeah and
[03:56:53] I don't have it I'm not gonna have it
[03:56:54] until next week so yeah I it's going to

[03:57:03] the leftovers but hopefully I don't
[03:57:05] think I got a lot of water Horizon
[03:57:07] though and there's a hard time finding
[03:57:08] it people are saying still so hopefully
[03:57:10] I'll be lucky enough that it'll be okay

[04:04:27] early baby ain't nothing but mammals
[04:04:52] yeah I know exactly sometimes I wonder
[04:04:54] if they're even real people and they're
[04:04:55] just like um like AI just trying to
[04:05:01] learn I know oh many
[04:05:04] times whenever I go to like it's a lot I
[04:05:07] work in it and I now I do development
[04:05:09] stuff but I used to be like turn it off
[04:05:10] and on please I know you said you you
[04:05:12] tried it but when you turn it off and on
[04:05:14] did you just press the power button so
[04:05:16] it went to sleep and came back on or did
[04:05:18] you like plug unplug it can we just
[04:05:20] please unplug
[04:05:22] it that's what I end up doing a lot of
[04:05:25] times just just please unplug it please
[04:05:27] just unplug
[04:05:30] it all right we're GNA run a little
[04:05:32] giveaway up there see if you guys want
[04:05:34] to come in and play the game with us all
[04:05:36] right we've been going through and
[04:05:38] having some fun playing our games you
[04:05:41] get to participate if you would like
[04:05:45] going to get yourself uh maybe health
[04:05:48] pack oh we got a me RA Raider you're
[04:05:51] going up again just unplug a bang yes I
[04:05:59] know all right you have won he defeated
[04:06:02] the
[04:06:06] Raider dude it does well the problem is
[04:06:08] I try to explain it to people something
[04:06:10] gets stuck in the programming code which
[04:06:12] is why things stop working L if you
[04:06:14] restart it and you stop it completely
[04:06:16] where it's everything's completely out
[04:06:17] of all its RAM memory there's no way for
[04:06:19] it to get stuck in that same spot again
[04:06:21] it has to go through that same exact
[04:06:22] process the same exact way to get stuck
[04:06:25] again so a lot of the times it never
[04:06:27] goes through that same exact process the
[04:06:28] same exact way because it goes one
[04:06:30] million different ways and it never gets
[04:06:32] there so you don't have that same issue
[04:06:33] and I try explaining that to people and
[04:06:35] people like
[04:06:37] like I'm like picture a [ __ ] River
[04:06:40] all right when you hit a rock
[04:06:44] the river doesn't just stop and go oh no
[04:06:47] it's a rock no the river tries to findly
[04:06:50] the way around it you turning off and on
[04:06:54] allows the river to try to find a way
[04:06:56] around the [ __ ]
[04:06:59] problem but anyways
[04:07:14] yes exactly it's not rocket science but
[04:07:16] sometimes I feel like it is exactly
[04:07:25] [Music]
[04:07:49] all right you got
[04:07:53] that
[04:08:03] one
[04:08:09] two H interesting
[04:08:33] and then what is the other problem I'm
[04:08:34] running into
[04:08:37] [Music]
[04:08:48] all right we're going to throw a game
[04:08:49] here out we have these running buy some
[04:08:52] stuff if you'd

# Contributing Guide

## Branch Workflow
- **personal-dev**: Your private development branch. All personal files (backups, inventory, templates, sensitive configs) live here in `user_private/`.
- **v1.5.0-working** (or `main`): Public release branch. No personal filesâ€”only code, resources, and docs.

## Keeping Personal Files Private
- All personal files must be in `user_private/`, which is in `.gitignore`.
- Never commit or push personal files to the release branch.
- Use the `clean_for_release.sh` script before every release to ensure no personal files are present.

## Merging Code Changes Safely
1. Commit your work on `personal-dev`.
2. Switch to `v1.5.0-working`.
3. Merge or cherry-pick only code changes (not personal files).
4. Run `./clean_for_release.sh` to verify the branch is clean.
5. Build and push the release.

## Release Checklist
- [ ] Run all tests and verify the app works without personal files.
- [ ] Run `./clean_for_release.sh`.
- [ ] Check that only public files are present.
- [ ] Build and package the app for release.

## Questions?
- Contact the maintainer for help with branch management or the release process.

## Automated Cleaning Script
- The `clean_for_release.sh` script will move all personal files to `user_private/` and ensure only public files are present in the release branch.
- Run the script with:
  ```sh
  ./clean_for_release.sh
  ```

## Checklist for Every Release
- [ ] All personal files are in `user_private/`.
- [ ] `./clean_for_release.sh` has been run.
- [ ] Only public files are present in the release branch.
- [ ] Code changes have been merged/cherry-picked from `personal-dev`.
- [ ] All tests pass and documentation is up to date.
- [ ] Commit and push the release branch.

[00:54:40] only a 25 for that Raider's Health that
[00:54:43] Raider is not happy with you they come
[00:54:46] back now that eight damage is only six
[00:54:48] for them they come back and they swing
[00:54:50] at
[00:54:52] you and they get oh they get a good hit
[00:54:55] on you with that 18 you see there in the
[00:54:57] background not bad they get a hit on you
[00:55:00] bring you down to five health so you're
[00:55:03] lucky though you beat
[00:55:05] them you did beat them and they go
[00:55:08] wandering away at the end of this

[00:18:37] expected all right so this is what we're
[00:18:39] going to do here all
[00:18:42] right our winner is hazer
[00:18:44] poor let's get to our other stuff
[00:18:51] here
[00:18:52] [Music]
[00:18:55] okay going do this here
[00:18:59] then I need to put this over
[00:19:01] here what was I doing now going do this
[00:19:05] come on get to
[00:19:13] it let's get
[00:19:15] here we
[00:19:20] go we're going to add
[00:19:24] in
[00:19:27] the let's
[00:19:38] see I think that's what we might do I
[00:19:41] think that's what we might put in
[00:19:43] there oh I like that
[00:19:55] idea yes we're going to put Commander
[00:19:58] plate in
[00:19:59] that's what we'll do that's is what
[00:20:01] we'll switch in for the hit haer I see
[00:20:03] you got the giby I do see that we'll
[00:20:05] switch in that Commander's
[00:20:08] plate now we're going to put that in the
[00:20:10] brakes instead we're going to have to
[00:20:11] add that in there something was pulled
[00:20:12] out so quickly we're just switch it out
[00:20:15] with something
[00:20:17] here all right we'll
[00:20:19] do highlight all
[00:20:31] right put that in
[00:20:36] here that is hold
[00:20:43] on all right we'll have to put that in
[00:20:46] there and look this is going to get
[00:20:47] pulled out instantaneously just because
[00:20:48] I put that in there by the
[00:20:50] way let's see if the math works out I
[00:20:53] think it
[00:20:54] does yeah it's still H you get a little
[00:20:56] bit of a better deal it's closer to $3
[00:20:59] and two but that's okay we'll go on with

[01:40:51] decent pack there all right let's uh I
[01:40:54] need get those back bend that that way a
[01:40:55] little bit there we go that's
[01:40:57] better all right let's get this one here
[01:41:00] oh Highlander get a giveaway I like that
[01:41:02] Highlander got a giveway nice
[01:41:05] Highlander all right my
[01:41:07] friend here we are and Ethan coming in
[01:41:12] with the next one and you got a dualist
[01:41:13] oh a nice one for the dualist
[01:41:19] Ethan all right so um the pull box
[01:41:21] you'll it'll everything that send the
[01:41:23] break you can literally see the name of
[01:41:25] them and the cards there I'll yell you
[01:41:27] one second after this carou of
[01:41:29] solidarity carou of knowledge some coues
[01:41:32] there Nimble blade Kenra Dune Beetle
[01:41:36] greater sandworm scribe of the mindful H
[01:41:41] kopish bitter blade warrior nef crop and
[01:41:45] tangler cartouch of ambition some coues
[01:41:47] here Kenra Char charioteer consuming
[01:41:52] fervor decimator Beetle Canyon slow ooh
[01:41:56] there's some lands for you nice pick up
[01:41:59] there forest with a warrior token there
[01:42:02] you go a canyon slow that's a good
[01:42:04] pickup on that
[01:42:07] one so what happens here is you will see
[01:42:11] in that break all of the cards are in
[01:42:13] there with their prices on them and you
[01:42:15] also have the potential of getting any
[01:42:17] of the other cards in there that are the
[01:42:19] Marvel ones now what happens is it can
[01:42:21] randomly assigns you to one of the spots
[01:42:23] in the break and which I'm using it as
[01:42:25] like a virtual pull box where you just
[01:42:27] pretty much decide if you want to come
[01:42:28] in on it it randomly assigned you to a
[01:42:30] spot which is a card now it could be the
[01:42:32] Marvel card that's there could be one of
[01:42:33] the other singles that's in there but
[01:42:35] that's what uh that's what it does there
[01:42:37] pretty much pretty straightforward you
[01:42:39] should be able to go and even click on
[01:42:40] that break and see everything in it with
[01:42:42] all the pricing
[01:42:43] too so you know exactly what you're
[01:42:46] getting so let me put those all in there
[01:42:48] for you my friend there you go that was
[01:42:51] a nice one with the canyon
[01:42:54] nice
[01:42:56] Canyon that was a good one with the
[01:42:58] canyon there that was a nice
[01:43:01] pickup I froze

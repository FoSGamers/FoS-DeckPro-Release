How do I disable the need to be connected to the internet at all times on new windows 11 so we can still use a computer saying that we don't always have internet

Disabling the requirement for a constant internet connection on a Windows 11 computer can be useful if you're in a situation where the internet is not always available. Here’s how you can set up your computer to function offline:

---

### **1. Install Windows 11 Without Internet**
If you're setting up a new PC, follow these steps during installation:

- **For Home Edition:**
  1. Disconnect from the internet by disabling Wi-Fi or unplugging the Ethernet cable.
  2. When prompted to connect to the internet, press `Shift + F10` to open the Command Prompt.
  3. Type the following command and press Enter:
     ```
     taskkill /F /IM oobenetworkconnectionflow.exe
     ```
  4. This will skip the internet connection check and allow you to set up a local account.

- **For Pro Edition:**
  - Select the option to set up a local account during installation, or follow the steps above if needed.

---

### **2. Switch to a Local Account**
If the system is already set up, but you want to remove the internet dependency:

1. Open **Settings** (`Windows + I`).
2. Navigate to **Accounts** > **Your Info**.
3. Under **Account Settings**, click **Sign in with a local account instead**.
4. Follow the prompts to create a local user account and switch.

---

### **3. Enable Offline Mode for Applications**
Many apps require an internet connection by default, but you can adjust their settings:

- **Microsoft Office/365:**
  1. Open an Office app.
  2. Navigate to **File** > **Account**.
  3. Sign out of your account to use the apps offline.

- **OneDrive:**
  1. Right-click the OneDrive icon in the taskbar.
  2. Select **Pause syncing** to stop constant cloud syncs.

- **Windows Store Apps:**
  - Use apps that have offline capabilities, or download offline versions.

---

### **4. Disable Online Features**
1. Open **Settings** > **System** > **Notifications**.
2. Turn off unnecessary notifications, especially those tied to cloud services.
3. Disable features like automatic Windows updates to avoid connectivity prompts:
   - Go to **Settings** > **Windows Update** > **Advanced options**.
   - Turn off **Download updates over metered connections** and set active hours to prevent automatic updates.

---

### **5. Ensure Key Features Work Offline**
Some services require configuration to function without an internet connection:

- **Local File Access:**
  - Save files locally instead of relying on cloud storage.

- **Apps Installation:**
  - Download apps and updates manually when connected to the internet and install them offline.

---

### **6. Disable Internet-Dependent Features**
To stop reminders about internet-related features:
1. Disable Cortana and Bing Search:
   - Open **Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Search Permissions**.
   - Turn off online search and results.
2. Turn off telemetry:
   - Go to **Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Diagnostics & Feedback**.
   - Set the diagnostic data to **Required only**.

---

### **7. Use Offline Tools**
- Opt for offline versions of software where possible (e.g., LibreOffice instead of Microsoft Office).
- Keep a USB drive or external storage with necessary installation files for offline use.

By setting up a local account, disabling online-only features, and prioritizing offline tools, you can make your Windows 11 PC fully functional without a constant internet connection.

I want to show on, shut off the internet dependency on the local administrator account. It's not allowing me to do it under accounts your info.

[2025-01-03 06:31:38] ChatGPT:
If you're unable to disable the internet dependency through the **Accounts > Your Info** section on a local administrator account in Windows 11, you can bypass the issue by forcing the system to use a local account and disabling mandatory internet connection checks.

Here’s how to do it step by step:

---

### **1. Switch to a Local Account Using Command Prompt**
If the GUI does not allow you to switch to a local account, you can force it using the Command Prompt.

1. Press `Windows + R`, type `cmd`, and press `Ctrl + Shift + Enter` to run Command Prompt as Administrator.
2. Enter the following command to create a new local administrator account:
   ```
   net user LocalAdmin /add
   net localgroup Administrators LocalAdmin /add
   ```
   Replace `LocalAdmin` with your desired account name.
3. Log out of the current account and log into the new local administrator account.

---

### **2. Disable Mandatory Internet Requirement**
Modify the system settings to prevent internet dependency using Group Policy or the Registry.

#### **Using Group Policy Editor (Pro and Enterprise Editions Only)**
1. Press `Windows + R`, type `gpedit.msc`, and press Enter.
2. Navigate to:
   - **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **System** > **Logon**.
3. Double-click **Do not display the ‘Getting Started’ screen**.
4. Set it to **Enabled** and click **OK**.
5. Restart your system.

#### **Using the Registry Editor (For All Editions)**
1. Press `Windows + R`, type `regedit`, and press Enter.
2. Navigate to:
   - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System`.
3. Right-click and create a **DWORD (32-bit) Value** called `DontRequireOnlineAccount`.
4. Set its value to `1`.
5. Restart your computer.

### **3. Enable Offline Mode for Existing Administrator Account**
If you want to ensure that the existing account no longer checks for internet:

1. **Disable Online Account Sync**:
   - Open **Settings** > **Accounts** > **Sync Your Settings**.
   - Turn off all sync settings.

2. **Remove Microsoft Account Association**:
   - Open **Command Prompt as Administrator**.
   - Type:
     ```
     net user Administrator /active:yes
     ```
   - Log into the **Administrator** account and switch the connected account to a local account:
     - Press `Windows + R`, type `lusrmgr.msc`, and press Enter.
     - Expand **Users**.
     - Right-click your user account, choose **Properties**, and remove any ties to Microsoft accounts under **Profile**.

---

### **4. Block Internet Access via Firewall**
To ensure that Windows services do not try to force internet dependency:
1. Open **Windows Defender Firewall**.
2. Go to **Advanced Settings** > **Outbound Rules**.
3. Create a new rule:
   - Block programs like `MicrosoftEdge.exe` and `oobenetworkconnectionflow.exe`.

---

### **5. Ensure Local Functionality**
1. **Disable Internet-Dependent Features**:
   - Turn off Cortana and Bing by going to:
     - **Settings > Privacy > Search Permissions**.
   - Set search to local results only.
2. **Disable Background Services**:
   - Press `Windows + R`, type `services.msc`, and disable services like:
     - **Connected User Experiences and Telemetry**.
     - **Windows Update Medic Service** (if you want manual updates only).

---

### **Final Step: Test the Offline Environment**
Log out and log back into the account. Verify that:
1. You can access settings and applications without internet prompts.
2. Your local administrator account is active, and system features do not require an internet connection.

If these steps are followed correctly, your administrator account will function entirely offline.

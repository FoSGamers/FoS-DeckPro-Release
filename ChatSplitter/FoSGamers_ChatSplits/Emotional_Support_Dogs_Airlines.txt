Our dog is 45 pounds. It can only fit inside because it's sitting with us next to us in the seat. Find an airline that we can do that with.

[2024-12-29 23:58:58] ChatGPT:
Traveling with a 45-pound dog in the cabin on flights from Orlando to Puerto Rico presents significant challenges, as most commercial airlines enforce strict size and weight limitations for in-cabin pets. Typically, only small dogs that can fit comfortably in a carrier under the seat are permitted. Larger dogs are usually required to travel in the cargo hold, subject to specific regulations and fees.

**Alternative Options:**

While standard commercial airlines may not accommodate large dogs in the cabin, some semi-private or charter airlines offer more flexible pet policies:

1. **JSX**: This semi-private airline allows medium to large dogs to travel in the cabin. For dogs weighing over 65 pounds, you must purchase an additional seat. However, JSX primarily operates within the continental U.S., and it's essential to verify if they service routes from Orlando to Puerto Rico. citeturn0search0

2. **Aero**: Aero permits medium and large dogs up to 65 pounds in the cabin, provided an extra seat is purchased. Their routes are limited, so confirm if they operate flights to your desired destination. citeturn0search0

3. **Charter Services**: Private charter flights offer the most flexibility for traveling with large pets in the cabin. While more expensive, this option ensures your dog can remain with you throughout the journey.

**Considerations for Cargo Travel:**

If opting for your dog to travel in the cargo hold, ensure the following:

- **Airline Policies**: Each airline has specific regulations regarding pet travel in cargo, including crate dimensions, weight limits, and health requirements.

- **Crate Specifications**: Use an airline-approved, sturdy crate that allows your dog to stand, turn around, and lie down comfortably.

- **Health and Safety**: Obtain a recent health certificate from your veterinarian and ensure your dog is acclimated to the crate before travel.

- **Booking in Advance**: Reserve your pet's spot early, as airlines have limited capacity for animals traveling in cargo.

**Summary:**

Due to stringent in-cabin pet policies, transporting a 45-pound dog from Orlando to Puerto Rico typically requires utilizing the cargo hold of commercial airlines. Alternatively, exploring semi-private airlines or charter services may provide options for in-cabin travel, though availability and routes are limited. It's crucial to review each airline's specific pet policies, prepare the necessary documentation, and ensure your dog's comfort and safety throughout the journey.

Delta Air Lines no longer recognizes emotional support animals (ESAs) as service animals. As of January 11, 2021, ESAs are treated as pets and are subject to Delta's standard pet policies, which include size and weight restrictions for in-cabin travel. citeturn0search7

**In-Cabin Pet Policy:**

- **Carrier Requirements**: The pet must remain inside the carrier throughout the flight, and the carrier must meet Delta's size requirements to fit under the seat. citeturn0search8

**Larger Dogs:**

For dogs that exceed the in-cabin size limitations, Delta requires them to be transported as checked baggage or via Delta Cargo, depending on the destination and specific circumstances. It's important to note that purchasing an additional seat does not permit larger dogs to travel in the cabin. citeturn0search8

**Service Animals:**

Delta continues to accept trained service dogs that are individually trained to do work or perform tasks for a person with a disability. These service dogs are allowed to accompany their handler in the cabin at no additional charge, provided they meet specific documentation and behavior requirements. citeturn0search0

**Summary:**

Delta Air Lines does not allow emotional support animals to travel in the cabin, regardless of whether an additional seat is purchased. Only small pets that can fit in an approved carrier under the seat are permitted in the cabin. Larger dogs must be transported as checked baggage or via Delta Cargo. Trained service dogs are allowed in the cabin with proper documentation.

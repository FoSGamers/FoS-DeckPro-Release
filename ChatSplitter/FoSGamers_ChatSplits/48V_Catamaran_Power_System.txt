Investigate 48-volt systems for battery power on my Catamaran. We were just talking to somebody about them at the boat show, and it was intriguing the idea of it, and how they supposedly can even run our air ACs for, like, you know, 20 hours. So I need to have some knowledge on that and some understanding. So look into that on the Internet and all of your knowledge for it.

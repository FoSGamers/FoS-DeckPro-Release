[00:13:35] stick cuz I might get kicked off
[00:13:37] atomizer hey
[00:13:40] Trump atomizing
[00:13:43] gamer all right we're going to start the
[00:13:46] break en
[00:13:48] counter you haven't all told me exactly
[00:13:50] what you're getting yet so you got to
[00:13:52] let me
[00:13:55] know I know every I know everybody not
[00:13:58] everybody did I think I was waiting on
[00:13:59] big BK to tell me what they wanted to do
[00:14:01] for
[00:14:03] um stuff in midnight I mean and uh not
[00:14:06] midnight in U mysy enforcer I don't know
[00:14:09] if you told
[00:14:13] me well that's good to hear big that's
[00:14:15] good to hear big that's good to hear my
[00:14:18] friend I appreciate that letting me know
[00:14:20] that one so all right well you guys have
[00:14:23] to decide what you're going to do
[00:14:25] because as you're wandering around that
[00:14:28] City that you've been in
[00:14:30] you get to a uh an elevator door in one
[00:14:34] of those skyscrapers you've been looking
[00:14:37] at right uh yeah definitely different
[00:14:40] yeah i' I've tried doing some evening
[00:14:41] things it's just not the same type of
[00:14:43] crowd but you know I tried out maybe one
[00:14:45] of these days every now and again so you
[00:14:47] have this here in front of the
[00:14:48] skyscraper you go
[00:14:50] up that there and you get to this room
[00:14:54] burnt out room on in the skyscraper and
[00:14:56] you're look going
[00:14:57] around and what you're trying to figure
[00:14:59] out here is a bunch of degenerates is
[00:15:03] what you can find there and what you see
[00:15:08] is
[00:15:11] a enhanced mutant that has it looks like
[00:15:15] maybe it might have been an experiment
[00:15:16] of some kind it's got some
[00:15:19] Plasma on the mutant and it is
[00:15:23] a uh it is a 40 for its Health but it
[00:15:29] can regenerate its
[00:15:31] health and it also has a one in4 chance
[00:15:35] of a plasma attack hitting you all
[00:15:41] so your foam throwing it you going to
[00:15:44] throw some foam at it all right we're
[00:15:45] going to f foam throw that
[00:15:48] one all right so that's a plus six you
[00:15:51] see that guy and you go all right now
[00:15:53] flame throw is a good idea because
[00:15:54] flamethrower when you burn them they
[00:15:55] can't actually uh heal back up again so
[00:15:57] here we go good luck you got to be that
[00:15:59] is a um 17 to hit so you got to have a
[00:16:03] 10 or
[00:16:05] higher you get three of
[00:16:07] those oh you got 15 so that means you
[00:16:09] get the hit and you hit them for seven
[00:16:13] now they cannot regenerate since you hit
[00:16:15] them for
[00:16:17] seven so that knocks them down from
[00:16:20] their 40
[00:16:27] Health - 7
[00:16:31] he goes a 33 Health all
[00:16:34] right what are you going to do you going
[00:16:36] to chop at him oh I thought I figured
[00:16:38] you going to go chopping at that guy now
[00:16:41] you chop at him with your stuff to see
[00:16:45] what happens with your Mighty upgraded
[00:16:47] Supreme ax trying to see if you yourself
[00:16:50] can let go a plasma shock
[00:16:53] wave oh no what was your number that
[00:16:57] you're going to choose Thor's over here
[00:16:59] with his hammer and his axe he's got a
[00:17:02] number four again all right oh you got
[00:17:05] number one and oh you got a seven my
[00:17:08] friend you
[00:17:10] missed we magic our our buddy
[00:17:13] Mythic enforcer gets a chance to
[00:17:17] attack
[00:17:19] yes so what are we doing Mythic with our
[00:17:22] weapon I haven't asked you yet because
[00:17:24] Mythic you
[00:17:26] have the Gatling gun
[00:17:30] which is always nice the alien Gatling
[00:17:33] gun you have an AR a sword a plasma
[00:17:39] rifle and you also have a pistol to
[00:17:43] use yes he's been here for a while I do
[00:17:46] not have any 30th Anniversary secret
[00:17:48] layer no no all right alien Gat time
[00:17:51] take out the alien Gat the alien Gat is
[00:17:54] a uh plus six and you roll three
[00:17:59] all right head it there all
[00:18:02] right there you go alien gas that means
[00:18:05] you need to have an 11 or
[00:18:10] higher oh god
[00:18:13] dude guys if you want I can change the
[00:18:15] dice but you got a
[00:18:17] two so you missed with your alien Gat it
[00:18:21] was a little bit too powerful for you
[00:18:23] Mystic and it shoots going by them but
[00:18:26] you notice one of them kind of goes
[00:18:28] directly into it
[00:18:31] and your enhanced mutant is now back up
[00:18:34] to 38 Health oh no they regained some of
[00:18:38] their health and they attack
[00:18:43] you oh he misses you guys are lucky this
[00:18:46] dice is just rolling low right now all
[00:18:49] right what are you guys going to do now
[00:18:51] that alien that uh that mutant there
[00:18:53] only has a couple damage
[00:18:57] but that was
[00:19:00] um it didn't hit before it absorbed the
[00:19:02] power from
[00:19:04] it it can gain health because it absorbs
[00:19:07] the it absorbs the plasma because it's a
[00:19:09] plasma enhanced mutant and that was a
[00:19:11] plasma weapon and it missed him but it
[00:19:14] went next to him and absorb the absorb
[00:19:15] the plasma and regained some of his
[00:19:16] health and
[00:19:18] healed so you you decide what you're
[00:19:20] going to do here my
[00:19:22] friend flamethrower again all right you
[00:19:25] go in with a flamethrower again that's a
[00:19:26] good choice
[00:19:29] you need an 11 or higher and you get an
[00:19:31] 11 nice with a flamethrower you hit five
[00:19:35] six knocking them down to uh 32
[00:19:40] Health all
[00:19:43] right they're now at 32
[00:19:46] health and what are we going to do next
[00:19:48] my friends we have a bunch of stuff in
[00:19:50] the buy now for any of you all that want
[00:19:51] to hang out and uh getet anything
[00:19:53] actually have to fit finish because we
[00:19:56] get you guys get some
[00:19:57] opportunities going to go for a chop I
[00:19:59] Like It Go for a
[00:20:00] chop here we go and I'm guessing number
[00:20:05] four oh you got two but this time you
[00:20:08] hit you chopped them with 8 10
[00:20:13] 11 that you hit him for uh actually
[00:20:16] let's do this let's just zoom in a
[00:20:18] little bit
[00:20:29] that works boom so you hit for four they
[00:20:33] go
[00:20:34] down 11 from their
[00:20:38] 32 to 21
[00:20:41] damage but you did Miss with the shock
[00:20:44] wave luckily they didn't not they did
[00:20:46] not regenerate because you didn't have

[00:24:51] look at that that's a nice one 11 damage
[00:24:59] so he goes from
[00:25:02] 14 down was going to be a full hit
[00:25:05] though all right we'll guarantee a hit
[00:25:06] but it's not going to be a full hit
[00:25:07] since he's on the
[00:25:10] ground all right oh you hit for an 11
[00:25:12] you actually got a hit this time look at
[00:25:14] that you hit him four five he's dead you
[00:25:19] swing finally you get a hit with your
[00:25:21] Supreme ax you swing that Supreme ax
[00:25:26] now I know all between the two of you
[00:25:29] did three damage and now he's finally
[00:25:31] there on the ground and you swing you
[00:25:33] hit the ground mightily with a strong
[00:25:35] one and you actually chop him clear in
[00:25:40] half when he's chopped clear in
[00:25:43] half some of the uh plasma cells that
[00:25:46] were inside of it that he was absorbing
[00:25:48] come on out which actually brings you
[00:25:52] back
[00:25:53] up my friend you got lucky on that one
[00:25:56] that was a big hit so bring you back up
[00:25:58] to instead of having two plasma rounds
[00:26:01] you're back up to your three plasma
[00:26:02] rounds look at that buddy your plasma
[00:26:06] shock wave rounds and then on top of
[00:26:09] that though you find
[00:26:12] 30 one two 3 four five 6 7 37 pogs to
[00:26:18] split up between all of you now bigles
[00:26:21] had 14 from before I mean big BK had 14
[00:26:25] from before so that's 21 they had and
[00:26:27] then they had uh and then we split those
[00:26:29] up all three it goes with that means
[00:26:32] yeah you know we'll say each one gets
[00:26:34] 13 so we're going to go with each you
[00:26:36] get 13 so that means you bring up to
[00:26:42] 34 then my
[00:26:45] buddy those are all the pogs that get
[00:26:47] Dro and then that's a lot you have some
[00:26:50] plasma
[00:26:52] ammo you have a um agility booster
[00:26:58] it a critical hit token which is a a one
[00:27:03] using a rataway oo those are
[00:27:08] nice and also you
[00:27:11] find
[00:27:14] another this thing didn't really know
[00:27:16] what it was but you find another torn up
[00:27:19] map
[00:27:21] fragment Plus on top of
[00:27:24] it there is also you find on them where'
[00:27:28] it go this looks like they might have
[00:27:31] had a weapon hidden just a regular
[00:27:32] Gatling gun now that's a plus five but
[00:27:35] you get three um d6s to roll
[00:27:41] with you want the map
[00:27:44] piece you take five because you did no
[00:27:46] damage well you know what you can do you
[00:27:48] can choose to take less of uh some of
[00:27:49] the other thing you know if that's what
[00:27:51] you
[00:27:52] feel but G it's going to it's more of
[00:27:55] you're collecting a certain amount of
[00:27:57] map pieces
[00:27:59] and then you'll be able to kind of put
[00:28:00] the puzzle together if that matter if
[00:28:03] that helps doesn't necessarily match but
[00:28:05] it doesn't that uh that mat fragment
[00:28:07] that you guys have because you have one
[00:28:08] too Mystic I
[00:28:10] know so do you want to roll to see who
[00:28:13] gets that or or do uh do a we got to try
[00:28:15] for the map fragment ready CU we got two
[00:28:17] people with map fragments so we're going
[00:28:19] to go with um I'm going to say heads for
[00:28:24] Mystic tails for big BK here we go
[00:28:30] good
[00:28:31] luck oh and have a little bit of an
[00:28:34] encounter there is what's left there I
[00:28:38] do
[00:28:40] believe yeah you're going to see each
[00:28:42] other about the map later I might as
[00:28:43] well right yeah meet up at another time
[00:28:46] be like hey we got to check out that
[00:28:48] map see how it goes are we going to make
[00:28:51] the map are we going to get the map
[00:28:52] working we'll find
[00:28:54] out anyone need critical or ammo you
[00:28:57] want to take the critical or ammo I
[00:28:59] think that's a good one since the map
[00:29:01] went to the big BK you get the critical
[00:29:03] or ammo I think that's a good
[00:29:07] tradeoff what do you guys
[00:29:11] think maybe maybe not
[00:29:15] acceptable
[00:29:17] possibly we'll send that critical and
[00:29:19] the ammo there and then you can take the
[00:29:21] agility big
[00:29:26] bkm yeah you need some
[00:29:30] ammo yeah all right so we'll do that
[00:29:32] we'll give the agility to Big BK all
[00:29:36] right that's what it will be
[00:29:38] agility big
[00:29:40] BK plus one agility that house would
[00:29:43] like uh like Melee stuff and dodging
[00:29:46] with uh like uh if you have pistols and
[00:29:49] things then we're going to give
[00:29:53] Mystic the uh critical
[00:29:58] and ammo so you can use that one there
[00:30:01] for that too so you can kind of trade
[00:30:03] between
[00:30:05] them yeah Stern talking about his that
[00:30:07] yeep yep did get stuff you got some you
[00:30:09] got some uh money there got some pogs
[00:30:12] yep got some pogs and there is the
[00:30:16] agility yeep got the rat away that's
[00:30:18] what it
[00:30:20] was we gave yeps the rat away which was
[00:30:22] the thing that which was left there
[00:30:23] since he had the he had the weapon that
[00:30:25] was seemed to be missing things seems
[00:30:27] like he might be he might need to maybe
[00:30:29] check on himself at some point maybe
[00:30:31] he's maybe he's getting sick and we just
[00:30:33] don't know maybe it's one he's starting
[00:30:36] to turn into
[00:30:39] something as he hangs out in the
[00:30:41] Wasteland I don't know
[00:30:43] maybe yeah oh factions hold on you guys

[00:30:48] factions things uh hold on yes give me a

[00:32:05] I have
[00:32:12] them aha here we
[00:32:16] go we're waste now I'm going to put them
[00:32:19] I'm going to make sure I put them in a
[00:32:20] different place breakfast is up top well
[00:32:22] thank you I appreciate that let me do
[00:32:25] this and we're going to say we're going
[00:32:26] to actually going to do this I'm making
[00:32:28] sure I save it this time so here are
[00:32:30] your factions now we're going to make
[00:32:31] some images for them we have the iron
[00:32:34] fangs they're kind of like a brutal
[00:32:36] Warlords now they have power is survival
[00:32:39] so you need to be strong and if you are
[00:32:41] weak you're going to die they're a
[00:32:44] ruthless faction of Warlords and Raiders
[00:32:46] who rule by fear and dominance of
[00:32:49] brutality they have strength loyalty in
[00:32:52] Conquest is what they believe in and
[00:32:54] Only the strongest deserve to survive
[00:32:58] all right your faction you gain some
[00:32:59] access to the elite weapons on Armor
[00:33:02] from some of the Raiders over time you
[00:33:04] gain some melee combat skills in some
[00:33:07] raids you also have the ability to call
[00:33:09] which are the Vault born and the Crimson
[00:33:12] Crimson Syndicate all right here's the
[00:33:14] Crimson Syndicate they are a shadowy
[00:33:17] network of Smugglers and assassins ah
[00:33:21] they are un their motto is the Unseen
[00:33:23] hand controls the world the Unseen hand
[00:33:28] a secret of criminal Syndicate running
[00:33:29] smuggling routs black markets and
[00:33:31] assassination Rings they specialize in
[00:33:33] Cort operations deception and high value
[00:33:38] trades they have access to the black
[00:33:40] market Traders with rare weapons and
[00:33:42] gear they gain stealth abilities for
[00:33:45] avoiding encounters if you want to sneak
[00:33:47] around things they can also potentially
[00:33:50] bribe NPCs to avoid fighting them or
[00:33:53] gain information instead but they have a
[00:33:56] risk their reput because they have
[00:33:59] always betrayals are a permanent thing
[00:34:00] for them so no one is ever going to
[00:34:02] really believe you and they're
[00:34:04] constantly targeted by the iron Fang and
[00:34:06] the Vault born all right so we got two
[00:34:09] more all right we got two
[00:34:12] more
[00:34:14] okay all right here we go we have the
[00:34:16] Vault born they are survivors of the
[00:34:18] Hidden ground hidden underground bunkers
[00:34:21] their motto is we rebuild the world one
[00:34:23] Survivor at a
[00:34:25] time they are a scientifically advanced
[00:34:27] faction made up of fact survivors from
[00:34:30] pre- collapsed bunkers they focus on
[00:34:32] restoring civilization helping through
[00:34:35] technology medicine and diplomacy
[00:34:37] they're your friends of the Wasteland
[00:34:39] they access advanced healing and medical
[00:34:41] gear they have access to high ener
[00:34:43] high-tech energy weapons and even
[00:34:45] potentially power armor at some point
[00:34:48] you can repair weapons and get upgraded
[00:34:50] weapons with some Vault borne Engineers
[00:34:52] if you were bump into them because
[00:34:53] they're your friends but also they have
[00:34:55] limited combat training so they rely on
[00:34:58] their technology and diplomacy so kind
[00:35:00] of sounds like you ye swinging that axe
[00:35:02] around that's upgraded that you don't
[00:35:04] know how to swing you have a hunt it
[00:35:06] forn
[00:35:08] are AI worshippers they're technal
[00:35:11] fanatic technological Fanatics all right
[00:35:13] they the flesh is weak machine is Stern
[00:35:16] and external is what you need their
[00:35:19] description is a faction of cybernetic
[00:35:21] enhanced zeelot who believe machines
[00:35:22] should rule over Humanity they scaven Le
[00:35:25] drones but they are always extreme
[00:35:28] hostility to humans humans are always
[00:35:30] going to be hostile hostile towards you
[00:35:32] but they are vulnerable to EMP based
[00:35:34] attacks and cyber warfare all right but
[00:35:37] there is one last faction because we are
[00:35:41] on a boat I had to make one last
[00:35:43] faction the last faction here here we go
[00:35:46] it is the Wasteland Pirates they are
[00:35:48] rogue Nomads and
[00:35:50] mercenaries they are loyalty is only to
[00:35:53] the highest bidder there's a faction of
[00:35:55] opportunist Raiders and Mercenaries who
[00:35:57] sail around the wastelands Coast looking
[00:36:00] through its ruins and on makeshift ships
[00:36:03] that can land also they have no
[00:36:05] Allegiance except to that that brings
[00:36:07] them the most profit they want money
[00:36:10] they don't care all they want show me
[00:36:12] the
[00:36:14] pogs now they need to know the ability
[00:36:16] which side can is based on personal gain
[00:36:18] they really don't care they switch sides
[00:36:20] as goes that's a f that's a perk they
[00:36:22] have hidden caches all around with
[00:36:24] stolen weapons and supplies you have
[00:36:26] discounts on smuggling services and
[00:36:28] under the table deals but you have no
[00:36:31] true Allegiance so no one really
[00:36:33] believes you nobody trusts you because
[00:36:34] you can move at any time to whoever has
[00:36:36] the most pogs for you and you may be
[00:36:38] forced into difficult moral choices
[00:36:41] based on who the highest bidder is all
[00:36:44] right so you can play you have Perks you
[00:36:46] have things that take away from you you
[00:36:49] have to decide what faction I will put
[00:36:51] pitting those faction there at some
[00:36:55] point oh heard your name
[00:36:58] I was reading through the factions that
[00:36:59] were available we had uh Mystic asked
[00:37:02] what factions were available we'll make
[00:37:03] some images for them for like their
[00:37:05] crests and their seals uh over time here
[00:37:07] with you guys but right now I was just
[00:37:09] telling you guys what they were each one
[00:37:10] was so you know what they
[00:37:12] were under the table all right you want
[00:37:15] to all right so we're going to have two
[00:37:16] Pirates Mystic and big BK want to be
[00:37:19] Pirates all right I like it you want be
[00:37:22] a of it you guys are going to be uh part
[00:37:24] of the the Wasteland Pirates is that
[00:37:26] what you're saying
[00:37:29] it doesn't matter on safe havens nothing
[00:37:31] really attacks you on safe havens when
[00:37:33] it comes to them he just not necessarily
[00:37:39] trusted you'll be a vault Mystic says
[00:37:42] all right mystic's going to be a vault
[00:37:44] Vault borne for
[00:37:50] Mystic get up here
[00:37:52] Mystic
[00:37:55] is and remember mytic you you uh you're
[00:37:58] starting to turn into something at one
[00:38:02] point the Vault
[00:38:04] born you were
[00:38:07] uh might have something to do with your
[00:38:10] naivity to some things outside ah
[00:38:13] remember earlier on you you had gotten
[00:38:15] something a while back and you decided
[00:38:17] you were going to take the chance on
[00:38:18] using it you remember that and you were
[00:38:21] going to see what happens and it healed
[00:38:22] you but something different started
[00:38:25] happening started changing
[00:38:27] maybe you yourself are changing into one
[00:38:29] of those uh
[00:38:31] ghouls we'll find
[00:38:37] out oh okay yeah so uh I went over those
[00:38:41] so that was that one the uh the
[00:38:42] Wasteland has nothing with those and
[00:38:44] then the only one is The Smuggler the
[00:38:46] Crimson Syndicate are the ones that
[00:38:49] um
[00:38:52] they oh uh you're talking iron Fang has
[00:38:54] lower reputation which are the Warlords
[00:38:57] are the Raiders they're the Raiders they
[00:38:59] have a lower reputation with Traders and
[00:39:01] safe havens if that's what you're
[00:39:02] talking
[00:39:04] about I was talking yeah Mystic you're
[00:39:07] the one turning in the ghoul yes
[00:39:10] correct oh oh oh oh locked room sorry
[00:39:13] about that locked room yeah this is
[00:39:16] generally like a a lot of weapon related
[00:39:18] things and they can do some upgrades
[00:39:20] hole in the wall has a bunch of random
[00:39:22] he just wanders around the
[00:39:23] Wasteland and goes back to his hole in

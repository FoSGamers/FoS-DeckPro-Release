[00:18:37] huh there we go I wanted to do a little
[00:18:40] a little bit of everything a spread of
[00:18:42] everything that's why it's a chaos this
[00:18:44] is not normal this is chaos do a little
[00:18:46] bit everything everywhere look at how
[00:18:48] many packs you have one two three six
[00:18:51] seven 8 nine 10 11 12 13 14 15 one two
[00:18:55] three four five six seven8 9 10 11 12 13

[00:19:12] I'll I'll let everybody pick a Benji too
[00:19:14] we'll add a Benji into that why not we
[00:19:16] like those ones we playing those
[00:19:18] games so what are you all thinking
[00:19:21] hopefully you're having a good one live
[00:19:23] stream not working there MTG is pretty
[00:19:26] fun Mr John John we have a good time
[00:19:28] playing it on a regular basis I might
[00:19:30] end up starting to do my uh work on my
[00:19:32] my raccoon deck
[00:19:39] here the other day I almost finished my
[00:19:42] sorcery deck we uh we were working on
[00:19:44] some other things didn't get it
[00:19:46] completely
[00:19:48] done alrighty so we have those in there
[00:19:52] there are nine left come on everybody
[00:19:53] nine left let's see what you like to do
[00:19:55] my friends and then I think I will um
[00:20:01] let's do something like
[00:20:03] this what we got here you have anything
[00:20:07] special
[00:20:10] today no I don't think
[00:20:16] so that's a weird one to be randomly
[00:20:18] there
[00:20:29] I don't remember putting that there look
[00:20:31] at that nice one of
[00:20:39] those no I think I don't have any it
[00:20:41] doesn't look like I need more duplicates
[00:20:42] I must have gotten rid of all of
[00:20:45] them just uh just what I have
[00:20:49] left look at
[00:20:54] that oh all righty then well
[00:20:59] I didn't have any of those left I
[00:21:02] thought breakes work all right so
[00:21:04] Oblivion the way this break works here
[00:21:06] is we open up all the packs on screen I
[00:21:10] take everything that is worth $3 or more
[00:21:12] or a rare or a Mythic I put it in a
[00:21:17] sleeve all right we set those in a pile
[00:21:21] and then I finish opening all the packs
[00:21:23] once all the packs are open I take all
[00:21:24] those cards I shuffle them up then I
[00:21:26] hand them out one at a time just
[00:21:28] literally one one two three four all the
[00:21:30] way through getting through all 10 of
[00:21:32] the people that purchased into the uh
[00:21:34] the break once all 10 once they all been
[00:21:37] handed out I flip them over show them
[00:21:39] what what everybody has got and then I
[00:21:43] package up then I once that's all done
[00:21:45] for everybody I do the same thing for
[00:21:47] the commons hand out all the
[00:21:49] commons and then we uh go from
[00:21:53] there and pretty much that's really what
[00:21:56] it is same way same way of doing that
[00:21:58] nice fun one
[00:21:59] there pretty good not too bad but hey
[00:22:04] one of the things I wanted to do is I
[00:22:05] did want to make a uh did want to make a
[00:22:09] nice the Rocket Raccoon deck we've been
[00:22:11] talking about so maybe we start doing

[00:57:42] minute yes I I Oblivion I I I'm not

[00:57:48] like oh
[00:57:52] great where is that card I know I have
[00:57:55] it somewhere
[00:58:00] where would I put
[00:58:03] it where would I put it over
[00:58:12] here moving so everything's like stacked
[00:58:15] and moved around in weird places so I
[00:58:17] don't know where everything is right
[00:58:19] now I think that's part of my problem at

[00:58:24] moment stuff is like throwing all over
[00:58:26] the
[00:58:29] place that's what happens when you move
[00:58:31] I
[00:58:37] guess get all messed up with

[00:58:50] end up hav knowing where anything is
[00:58:52] anymore which sucks CU I know I had that
[00:58:55] card somewhere
[00:59:00] what did I do with it is my question

[03:33:20] Robert
[03:33:22] mayard there we go all right we got all
[03:33:25] 10 of them right now here so what we're
[03:33:27] going to do now I'm going to put these
[03:33:30] all there in the order that they were
[03:33:32] here that's our order of all our
[03:33:35] things that's our order of
[03:33:38] ordering and Robert had the other two
[03:33:40] right here okay this is what I'm going
[03:33:43] to do right now because our giveaway
[03:33:44] went and we hit our goal at the top
[03:33:46] there which is awesome so this is what I
[03:33:48] got to do now I got to do two
[03:33:51] things 26 I think Alex the great got got
[03:33:55] it
[03:33:56] again I think Alex the great got it
[03:34:02] again well look at that Alex the great
[03:34:06] got it
[03:34:07] again it's not showing it for me for
[03:34:10] some reason so I have to start the
[03:34:12] number 27 but number 26 went to Alex the
[03:34:14] great a second time and you got a
[03:34:16] curious forager all right not a big hit
[03:34:19] but hey get you discount on
[03:34:25] shipping if you want to trade
[03:34:28] any there are no numbers there are no
[03:34:31] numbers there's literally no numbers to
[03:34:33] them okay so the only thing we're doing
[03:34:35] there's literally no numbers associated
[03:34:37] with yours because yours were the last
[03:34:38] two picked up it's it's just so yours
[03:34:41] were the last two picked up so you're
[03:34:42] just going to be the last two of them um
[03:34:44] I was just going order of who picked
[03:34:46] them up like who an order of what was
[03:34:49] bought okay that's what I was doing
[03:34:50] there for our friends just so you're
[03:34:53] aware um and then I'm going to go and
[03:34:55] fix our chart our thing here and let's
[03:34:57] see what we get for our um our go to our
[03:34:59] next one 750 is our next goal are we
[03:35:02] gonna get our 750 goal oh that would be
[03:35:05] a big hit I don't know if we can but we
[03:35:07] can try we hit our 350 goal that means
[03:35:10] we're going to get two packs of cards
[03:35:11] given away at the end of the stream are
[03:35:13] you going to hit the 750 goal and get
[03:35:14] three packs
[03:35:16] I don't know it's up to you if we're
[03:35:18] going to do that mayor Robert you make
[03:35:20] does that make sense for you at the end
[03:35:23] there there's no numbers on anything I'm
[03:35:25] just literally going who went in order I
[03:35:27] shuffled them up and just going through

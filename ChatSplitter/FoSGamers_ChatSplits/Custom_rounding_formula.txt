how do I have a column in google sheets custom round a number up from anything that has .35 or higher will go to the next number instead of lower. so 1.35 would go to 2 instead of being less that 1.5 so it goes to 1. 

[2025-04-04 07:04:28] ChatGPT:
To round numbers **up** in Google Sheets when they reach **.35 or higher**, and otherwise round down (like 1.34 â†’ 1, 1.35 â†’ 2), you can use a **custom formula** like this:

```excel
=IF(MOD(A1,1)>=0.35,INT(A1)+1,INT(A1))
```

### Breakdown:
- `A1` is the cell with the number.
- `MOD(A1,1)` gives you the decimal portion (e.g., `1.35 â†’ 0.35`).
- If the decimal is `>= 0.35`, it adds 1 to the integer portion.
- Otherwise, it just uses the integer portion (`INT(A1)`).

### Example Results:
| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| 1.34  | 1      |
| 1.35  | 2      |
| 2.7   | 3      |
| 5.1   | 5      |

Let me know if you want this applied to a whole column or need it nested in a bigger formula!

price is in cell H

[2025-04-04 07:04:50] ChatGPT:
Got it! If the price is in column **H**, you can use this formula in another column (say, column **I**) to apply the custom rounding:

```excel
=IF(MOD(H1,1)>=0.35,INT(H1)+1,INT(H1))
```

Just drag it down to apply it to all rows.

### Bonus Tip:
If you want this formula to always work no matter the row, but you're pasting it into a column like **I**, just update the row number dynamically:

```excel
=IF(MOD(H2,1)>=0.35,INT(H2)+1,INT(H2))
```

Use the correct row (e.g., `H2`, `H3`, etc.) depending on where you're entering it.

Let me know if you want this applied directly *within* another function or automated via script!

it starts on row 2

[2025-04-04 07:05:03] ChatGPT:
Perfect! Then in **cell I2**, paste this version:

```excel
=IF(MOD(H2,1)>=0.35,INT(H2)+1,INT(H2))
```

Then drag it down as far as needed to apply the rounding logic to each value in column H starting from row 2.

If you want to make it fancy later with headers or conditional formatting, Iâ€™ve got youâ€”just say the word ðŸ˜Ž

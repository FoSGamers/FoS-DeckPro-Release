[01:29:11] knives all right let me add uh let me
[01:29:13] get to your guy here and Nico you were

[01:29:18] me add in uh you have a plasma rifle
[01:29:20] times two
[01:29:22] now times two
[01:29:25] now you cannot dual wheel plasma rifles
[01:29:28] I'm sorry you're not able to do that
[01:29:31] but but even though you're not able to
[01:29:33] do a wheel of plasma rifles you can give
[01:29:36] one to a friend or you can potentially
[01:29:39] sell one for a good chunk of pogs now I
[01:29:42] haven't had anybody get plasma rifle to
[01:29:44] sell yet so we're going to have to
[01:29:45] figure out what we think those are worth
[01:29:47] what do you guys think those should be
[01:29:48] worse should those be worth like I want
[01:29:50] to say 15 pogs
[01:29:51] maybe or they wait I think there were 25
[01:29:55] pogs if somebody was going to buy one
[01:29:57] before so it's probably going to be 25
[01:29:58] pogs I think it might be a 25 poger what
[01:30:02] are you talking about pogs that's our
[01:30:03] Wasteland currency in our adventure
[01:30:05] game and I literally have them here for

[01:32:55] plus seven right now that is correct but
[01:32:57] being close to the gator Dow means
[01:32:58] you're going to have a better chance of
[01:32:59] him harming you you know getting a big
[01:33:01] hit on you that's the only thing you got
[01:33:02] to worry about the further away is they
[01:33:04] might need to you know charge at you not
[01:33:06] get just as big of a hit right away it's
[01:33:08] however you want to handle it but you
[01:33:10] can roll in there with a big sword and
[01:33:12] give a nice Chop on them if you want
[01:33:14] because you do
[01:33:16] have your
[01:33:21] sword all right take a shot with plasma
[01:33:24] now what dice would you like to use and
[01:33:27] Mike you got this Mick M A do thank you

[01:33:56] made oh my oh we got to zoom
[01:33:59] out you my
[01:34:01] friend did not get any
[01:34:04] luck that is not enough for the Gator
[01:34:07] Dow you have an issue now you've taken a
[01:34:10] shot with your plasma rifle you're now
[01:34:13] down one shot but that Gator Dow did not
[01:34:17] like what happened came charging towards
[01:34:18] you A Barrel rolled right into you
[01:34:23] knocking you over over and bring you
[01:34:25] from your 92 Health down to 83 Health
[01:34:29] not a big hit but he knocked you over
[01:34:31] the problem with that is he is at a 50
[01:34:33] health and by knocking you over you're
[01:34:35] going to have a hard you have to have a
[01:34:36] hard time getting up and doing another
[01:34:39] shot right away you have to put some
[01:34:40] effort into that one have a good make
[01:34:42] sure you get a good luck on
[01:34:45] this you're very welcome and we'll open
[01:34:47] that pack up here in a second all right
[01:34:49] my
[01:34:50] friend going de side though what are you
[01:34:52] going to do are you going to continue
[01:34:55] Nico through the
[01:35:02] adventure you can switch it up to the
[01:35:04] sword since he's right near you this
[01:35:10] time no we're not
[01:35:14] sure swap to the sword since we're
[01:35:16] cuddling already all right we're going
[01:35:17] to swap the sword you got plus seven on
[01:35:20] that one so that means you need to get
[01:35:22] an 11 or
[01:35:24] bigger so let's
[01:35:27] see oh you did it you had
[01:35:30] 15 you got oh that was good you were
[01:35:33] able to get up you're able to stand up
[01:35:36] you use that swords to get you up out of
[01:35:39] the ground there and you take a swing at
[01:35:42] that Gat
[01:35:43] orillo with your sword and you hit them
[01:35:46] bringing them from 50 only down to 41
[01:35:50] because you had to get up you know you
[01:35:51] didn't get a lot of you didn't get a lot
[01:35:53] of weight behind that swing but they are
[01:35:56] mad then they tail whip you bring you
[01:35:59] from 82 down
[01:36:01] to
[01:36:02] 70 knocking you back a bit now you have
[01:36:06] an option what would you like to do
[01:36:07] again you want to go after them with
[01:36:09] your
[01:36:10] sword do we want to uh run away down the
[01:36:14] other hallway turn around
[01:36:16] run cuz remember if you run you only
[01:36:19] have to drop something where if you get
[01:36:21] knocked out and taken over there and the
[01:36:23] next hit there uh if you get hit this
[01:36:25] next time and you don't hit them you're
[01:36:28] going to end up getting knocked out cuz
[01:36:29] they it's a one to one here right now
[01:36:30] and you're going to probably lose some
[01:36:33] things you can run away yeah turn around
[01:36:35] and
[01:36:36] flee all right you turn around and flee
[01:36:39] down the hallway you leave that Gator
[01:36:42] Dow down there but whenever you flee you
[01:36:45] do have to drop something now I'm going
[01:36:47] to give you an answer option run Nico
[01:36:50] run you have to get up either some pogs
[01:36:54] you could drop a knife you could drop
[01:36:57] some of your ammo of
[01:36:59] something but and you have to tell me
[01:37:02] which you want to
[01:37:04] do you're going to drop it all right
[01:37:07] that's you know that's a good idea drop
[01:37:09] go in you're going to drop two of your
[01:37:11] knives you're down to two knives instead
[01:37:14] of
[01:37:15] four and that Gator Dill when he goes

[01:53:34] that are hanging around maybe U maybe
[01:53:35] you can jump in and hang out with a do a
[01:53:37] little adventuring at some
[01:53:40] point strength mod do with your sword it
[01:53:44] actually gives you a plus one on your
[01:53:47] strength to
[01:53:49] swing um so that's uh that's the biggest
[01:53:52] thing that it'll give you there and um
[01:53:55] with your knife and then also it will
[01:53:59] once you get up to a certain amount with
[01:54:01] your strength you have to have plus
[01:54:03] three then you get to carry an extra
[01:54:05] thing in your inventory CU currently
[01:54:07] you're at one two three
[01:54:09] four five
[01:54:12] six you haven't hit over the amount yet
[01:54:14] you were almost at it with seven before

[01:54:31] correct intelligence adds to the plasma
[01:54:33] that is
[01:54:43] correct let's use both of the boosters
[01:54:45] all

[01:55:14] with intelligence if you run into a safe
[01:55:17] or a key code that you need to use and
[01:55:18] you have to get through it by Rolling
[01:55:20] you're going to get plus one which will
[01:55:21] help with that that now strength if
[01:55:23] there's certain things that you need to
[01:55:24] do with traps that you need to get

[01:57:03] 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 all right that's
[01:57:08] your number there let's see if you have
[01:57:12] the luck no Gator dillos let's see oh we
[01:57:14] got lucky you got yourself a small bug
[01:57:17] in front of you little teeny weeny bug
[01:57:18] there comes skittering towards you in
[01:57:21] the hall you were just
[01:57:23] in and you need to decide what you want
[01:57:25] to do what do you want for a pack though
[01:57:27] you did not get the play booster box
[01:57:28] you're going to have to go with the pack
[01:57:29] there and I only have one I might only
[01:57:32] have one ioria left or no I have more of
[01:57:34] those around somewhere I have one more
[01:57:37] one ioria available with me right now
[01:57:38] I'll have to find where the rest of them
[01:57:40] are but what would you like there my
[01:57:42] friend
[01:57:47] Nico you'll take the last one I like it
[01:57:50] put that ioria over here with your stuff
[01:57:53] there you are there's your I Cory there
[01:57:54] the last one and you are currently in
[01:57:57] that uh hallway there staring down a
[01:58:00] small
[01:58:02] bug you have a lot of big hits on you
[01:58:05] you have a sword you've got a plasma
[01:58:10] rifle uhoh I hit the button and erased
[01:58:12] all your stuff oh no there you go you've
[01:58:15] got a
[01:58:17] pistol and you also have two knives if
[01:58:20] you feel like going to Kimbo with your
[01:58:21] knives
[01:58:23] you going to run over to that thing and
[01:58:24] swing your sword that's a good idea
[01:58:25] because that bug's only 25 on its health
[01:58:28] so you run by and you have with that
[01:58:31] small bug there you actually have
[01:58:35] yourself um you have to get the sword is
[01:58:38] the agility and the strength oh my God
[01:58:41] you have plus one on the strength plus
[01:58:43] one there plus five you have a plus
[01:58:45] eight for your sword coming at him right
[01:58:49] now plus eight with that sword coming at
[01:58:52] right now let's see what
[01:58:56] happens that means you need to get what
[01:58:59] five no my math was bad
[01:59:04] there well it doesn't matter because you
[01:59:06] got
[01:59:06] 17 you swing away with that sword that
[01:59:10] mighty sword you swing that mighty
[01:59:13] sword at the little tiny bug standing in
[01:59:16] front of you in the hallway get a nice
[01:59:19] big hit on it that sword creams that bug
[01:59:22] down squish that bug that bug goes from
[01:59:24] 25 Health you clear almost chop it in
[01:59:28] half you bring it down to nine
[01:59:32] Health it starts to charge toward you
[01:59:35] but it kind of starts running in a
[01:59:36] circle because you got some of its legs
[01:59:38] chopped
[01:59:39] off and it doesn't actually even attack
[01:59:41] get to hit you it misses you what would
[01:59:44] you like to do
[01:59:46] now you have two more chances here to
[01:59:48] see if you're going to hit hard them
[01:59:50] we'll swing away again
[01:59:52] you swing away again and oh 12 you got
[01:59:54] him again there is no chance for that
[01:59:56] bug no chance for that bug your small
[02:00:00] bug there has the adventurer in the wall
[02:00:03] on the hallway here takes his sword
[02:00:06] out and swipes down cutting the bug
[02:00:10] clear in half the bug two halves of it
[02:00:13] twitch a couple
[02:00:15] times and we don't really know what
[02:00:19] happens after but you lean over and you

[01:00:55] ease
[01:01:01] [Music]
[01:01:02] um no the lowest I can do on that toss

[01:01:13] those let's see how's it
[01:01:16] going heavy how's it going heavy yeah
[01:01:19] yep yeah that is uh you know I did go
[01:01:21] from you know that went down from eight
[01:01:23] to two $2 on those to six so that is it
[01:01:26] going now now what you know 20 25%

[01:03:22] times of the day I'm guessing like a
[01:03:24] bunch of people jump on and then it puts
[01:03:26] me I'm guessing to the bottom of the
[01:03:27] barrel and then I start getting
[01:03:29] glitching but if I refresh I sometimes
[01:03:32] will come back here so good Lu see I

[01:10:44] you doing to buddy but uh so last night
[01:10:48] um we uh with the tech issues that I was
[01:10:51] having with connecting things I was like

[01:10:54] uh not phone a brand new camera so I
[01:10:57] went I bought a camera let me grab that
[01:10:59] let's see where I put that where did I
[01:11:02] put that piece of [ __ ] this [ __ ]
[01:11:05] piece of crap bought this piece of crap
[01:11:08] here other piece of crap look at this
[01:11:11] thing I bought this piece of crap here
[01:11:15] it won't connect to my computer you want
[01:11:17] know what I found out
[01:11:19] yesterday the reason
[01:11:22] why well this morning it is supposed to
[01:11:25] connect to it and I was looking at it it
[01:11:26] says oh yes it connects it connects
[01:11:28] checked everything out so this morning I
[01:11:32] was on the
[01:11:33] pooper doing some research as you do on
[01:11:37] your phone when you're on the
[01:11:39] pooper and what happened was I found out
[01:11:43] that it's not that the phone is not
[01:11:45] compat that the uh camera is not
[01:11:47] compatible the camera is
[01:11:51] compatible one of the two apps
[01:11:55] that are needed after you install the
[01:11:58] driver is not
[01:12:01] compatible with Mac OS
[01:12:04] 14 so I have to go and downgrade to 13
[01:12:07] after we're done with the show here and
[01:12:09] see if I can get that camera to work so
[01:12:12] I can have a nice new camera and then my
[01:12:13] phone off to the side so I can chat with
[01:12:15] you all better and
[01:12:18] easier get everything else figured out
[01:12:21] figure that was pretty good one there
[01:12:25] but anyways no one wants any of that
[01:12:27] stuff I'm just kind of hanging out here
[01:12:28] with you all let's throw out one of the

[01:12:53] is um I have to go from Seda down to
[01:12:58] ventur because it it will not work with
[01:13:01] the uh with the with the camera there
[01:13:04] and It upgraded only to ventur only like
[01:13:06] a month ago and I've been having weird
[01:13:08] problems so I'm wondering if I downgrade
[01:13:10] I'll even just get rid of some of those
[01:13:12] other problems I've been having I'm
[01:13:14] hoping I will I'm hoping I will but
[01:13:17] let's throw up uh let's throw out a
[01:13:20] pogman
[01:13:21] battle let's throw out a pogman battle
[01:13:24] with a out laws of Thunder Junction here
[01:13:27] dude technology is so weird I mean
[01:13:29] literally I was I like I lost my [ __ ]
[01:13:32] yesterday multiple times because how
[01:13:33] much stuff just was not working do like
[01:13:36] internet phones not connecting and
[01:13:37] everything else I was like I'm I I can't
[01:13:39] do this I like literally walked away
[01:13:42] from the computer here and gave up at
[01:13:44] like at uh at like 7:30 I'm like I'm not
[01:13:47] I'm not playing with this anymore
[01:13:51] done when I to put out uh let's put out
[01:13:53] a and then then I went I'm like I'm
[01:13:55] going to go buy a the camera camera says
[01:13:57] it works with it you know let's go do
[01:13:59] that no the camera does not work it
[01:14:03] works only if I downgrade all right here
[01:14:05] you go little Adventure game for all of
[01:14:07] you for those that do not know the
[01:14:09] adventure game you pick a character and
[01:14:12] you travel through the Wasteland
[01:14:15] here I am pretty good with tech I just
[01:14:18] get very um annoyed when there's
[01:14:21] something buried so far in a goddamn
[01:14:23] note that it takes me searching through
[01:14:26] like things in uh it just just if it say
[01:14:29] is supposed to plug and play it should
[01:14:30] plug and play it's what it really what
[01:14:32] it blows down
[01:14:33] to no one wants the Outlaws here so I'll
[01:14:37] put those
[01:14:38] back I bet everybody outlawed them out
[01:14:41] this weekend which is what also another
[01:14:43] reason why I'm screwed on these but
[01:14:46] we'll see later maybe Friday once
[01:14:47] everybody gets pay in maybe we'll be
[01:14:49] able to get some Outlaws sold I have a
[01:14:52] feeling everybody already got what they
[01:14:53] were looking for though
[01:15:04] Let's
[01:15:05] uh let's put some other stuff out though
[01:15:08] here let's do um double Masters and an
[01:15:12] Exelon set maybe
[01:15:23] for this
[01:15:26] taxes took me for a freaking ride this
[01:15:28] year
[01:15:29] oh still hunting the rose what rapose is
[01:15:32] it I again be
[01:15:34] money uh you know what taxes I have to I
[01:15:37] submitted mine and yes I know yeah taxes
[01:15:39] are no fun I don't want to talk about
[01:15:41] him the muscle is that the new
[01:15:48] one all right hold on a
[01:15:52] second hold on one second here
[01:15:57] hold on one second
[01:16:10] here let me see
[01:16:13] here all right give me one second where
[01:16:16] did I do
[01:16:22] that we went to pre-release
[01:16:33] and let's see
[01:16:35] here I need a double check with my son
[01:16:39] because it was his that was pulled out
[01:16:41] he pulled it
[01:16:43] out but I'm pretty sure he'll be okay
[01:16:46] with it but I got to check with him
[01:16:48] today so check with me tomorrow
[01:16:51] okay but he was the one that pulled it
[01:16:53] out this is the reason why I have to
[01:16:54] check with him
[01:16:57] bunny but he pulled that out I had to
[01:16:59] double check with
[01:17:02] him if he really needed it or wanted it
[01:17:05] I don't think he does because he does
[01:17:07] dragons not
[01:17:09] demons but give me a minute let me check
[01:17:12] and I I will let you know tomorrow okay
[01:17:15] that sound good for
[01:17:20] you he pulled it out during pre-release
[01:17:23] and I was like oh sweet and uh we got to
[01:17:26] we even get to play the card during
[01:17:27] pre-release so uh but let me double
[01:17:29] check with him and I will let you know
[01:17:31] tomorrow if he's okay with that or not
[01:17:33] all right
[01:17:35] man I just don't want to I don't want to
[01:17:37] I don't want to get it away and I don't
[01:17:39] want to sell it if he really really
[01:17:41] wanted it for some reason generally he
[01:17:42] doesn't because he generally just wants
[01:17:44] the dragon
[01:17:49] stuff oh dang that stinks RADS
[01:17:56] see what I do with it RADS is I always
[01:17:58] claim um like the lowest or the whatever
[01:18:02] the highest they can take from me is all
[01:18:04] year long at the beginning of the year
[01:18:06] that way at the end of the year most of
[01:18:07] the time I um I don't need to worry
[01:18:10] about it at the end of the year so like
[01:18:11] it's just like oh hey works perfect you
[01:18:14] know if that makes any
[01:18:20] sense exactly that's why I don't want to
[01:18:22] give it away that's why I don't want to
[01:18:24] give it away yet heavy exactly my reason
[01:18:27] I don't want to do anything with it yet
[01:18:28] so that's why I want to check with him
[01:18:30] for his heavy exactly my reason I don't
[01:18:32] know if he wants to keep it for some
[01:18:34] reason other I know he normally does
[01:18:35] dragons so but uh you know my thing is
[01:18:38] though I have another I have a box of
[01:18:39] stuff I'm opening here so it's
[01:18:41] distinctly possible I could pull another
[01:18:44] one out because we have um Halo thanks
[01:18:47] for coming in by the way you got the
[01:18:49] little giby here Halo 117
[01:18:53] MTG now that is uh it's a little sign
[01:18:55] card from the family and a little extra
[01:18:57] card and remember the biggest thing on
[01:18:59] that is it helps you with some uh extra
[01:19:00] discount on shipping if you want to get
[01:19:02] anything and uh just make sure you
[01:19:04] follow us that's all we
[01:19:06] ask oh yeah yeah I'm gonna um I will
[01:19:09] double check with him though it might
[01:19:11] like like heavy said it might be like a
[01:19:12] souvenir thing I'm not sure but I'm
[01:19:14] going to double check with him on that
[01:19:17] but
[01:19:21] uh H I claim zero is that so zero is the
[01:19:24] one where they take the most okay yeah I
[01:19:27] had to pay last year we had to pay last
[01:19:29] year with our taxes I my wife did it
[01:19:31] this year and I don't know what we had
[01:19:32] to do this year but um yeah this year
[01:19:36] though we didn't take out money last
[01:19:38] year I had taken out money from my um
[01:19:41] 401k to buy a buy some of the stuff so
[01:19:44] that was part of the
[01:19:47] reason let's put
[01:19:50] out let's put out uh we'll put out this
[01:19:53] again why not and we're going to put out

[01:21:34] make an
[01:21:36] adjustment and uh change the game a
[01:21:40] little bit so I'm sorry about that we

[02:39:18] SC
[02:39:22] two ah I understand Josh I understand
[02:39:25] that so what I end up planning I'm
[02:39:27] actually GNA plan on changing up uh some
[02:39:29] stuff with
[02:39:30] myself so I'm gonna end up
[02:39:35] um I'm gonna end up uh maybe adjusting
[02:39:38] what I'm doing with my life here I think
[02:39:40] I might do some more of this put more
[02:39:41] effort into this in my other job I might
[02:39:44] do some other things and like maybe see
[02:39:45] if I can take a sabatical or something
[02:39:47] because I've been having a rough time
[02:39:48] with the other one I don't know I want
[02:39:50] to see what I can do
[02:39:53] here just having a rough time with some
[02:39:55] things and I need to take a break in a
[02:39:56] way if that makes any sense we going to
[02:39:59] go with a little
[02:40:03] reprieve let's put out reprieve
[02:40:08] here yep exactly little reprieve foil
[02:40:12] return Target spell to its owner's hand
[02:40:15] draw a
[02:40:16] card I think it was uh yesterday was my
[02:40:19] father's anniversary of his past of his
[02:40:21] death it was many many years ago like 20
[02:40:23] years ago but like a bunch of stuff just
[02:40:25] didn't work for me that I was trying to
[02:40:26] do and like you know what maybe this is
[02:40:28] trying to tell me something
[02:40:30] right no one wanted this reprieve so I
[02:40:32] figured I there's some things I needed
[02:40:34] to change up so I'm am actually happier
[02:40:36] rather than being pissed about the
[02:40:37] things I can't
[02:40:38] control Menace
[02:40:41] morle dark Fortress I figur put things
[02:40:44] in my control exactly sometimes the
[02:40:46] change can help so I figured I'm going
[02:40:49] to make a little bit of a change in my
[02:40:50] life
[02:40:52] here Min Mor gold dark
[02:40:55] Fortress Min Mor gold dark

I appreciate you watching. I share the ones that got people excited in my live streams. They are all great foils since there are so few in sorcery alpha.

I appreciate you watching! I like to showcase cards that got people excited during my live streams. These foils are pretty special since Sorcery Alpha has so few of them. Thanks for the feedback!

search online for how many foil cards are in alpha for some added info on why this is a great pull.

[2024-10-01 08:32:51] ChatGPT:
The Sorcery: Contested Realm Alpha set is quite special due to its rarity and pull rates. The Alpha set contains 403 cards, and each card has a premium holographic foil version. Foils in the Alpha set are particularly rare, with pull rates of about 1 in 4 packs. The set includes different foil types, such as Ordinary, Exceptional, Elite, and Unique cards, with Unique foils being the rarest at a pull rate of 1 in 68 packs„Äê9‚Ä†source„Äë„Äê10‚Ä†source„Äë.

This makes any foil pull from the Alpha set, including even Ordinary cards, a rare and valuable collectible. Since Alpha boxes are already out of print with limited quantities produced, getting your hands on any foil, especially during live breaks, is a great find„Äê11‚Ä†source„Äë. 

Let me know if you'd like more details or have additional questions!

Thanks for checking it out! I understand how it might seem ordinary, but this foil is actually a rare find. In Sorcery: Contested Realm Alpha, foils are quite special. The set has 403 cards, and each one comes in a premium foil version, but foil pull rates are about 1 in 4 packs. To give you an idea, Unique foils are the rarest with a pull rate of 1 in 68 packs! So, any foil from this set is considered a great collectible, especially since Alpha boxes are out of print. Glad I could share this awesome pull from the stream with everyone!„Äê9‚Ä†source„Äë„Äê10‚Ä†source„Äë

Kinda make it a wise ass response since they were to me but nicely so they wouldn't know until thinking about it for a bit.

Thanks for the feedback! I get it ‚Äì foils can seem a bit ‚Äúordinary‚Äù at first glance. But in Sorcery: Contested Realm Alpha, these foils are far from common. With the set only offering a foil pull in 1 out of 4 packs, and Unique foils showing up as rarely as 1 in 68 packs, pulling *any* foil is like finding treasure. Plus, Alpha boxes are out of print, so it‚Äôs always a treat to snag one. But hey, I guess it‚Äôs all in the eye of the beholder, right? üòâ

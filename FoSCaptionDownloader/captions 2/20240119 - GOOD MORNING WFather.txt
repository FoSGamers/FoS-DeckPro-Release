[00:33:53] this time I lied I'm doing it this time
[00:33:55] but will can pick out the pack from here
[00:33:57] if you guys want that's what we can do I
[00:33:59] want to see if anybody wants a commander

[00:34:03] I'm also going to put

[00:34:08] it I know is probably not exactly what
[00:34:12] everybody wants but I'm going to try it
[00:34:13] out and while I'm figuring out the um
[00:34:17] our price for this I'm going to throw a
[00:34:22] combo Little combo deal on oh it's not
[00:34:25] here anymore oh it is it is it is I
[00:34:29] throw a little combo deal
[00:34:34] on got your package today awesome thank
[00:34:37] you Ahsoka happy that you got it I'm I'm
[00:34:40] I love love when everybody lets me know
[00:34:41] that they got their packages and
[00:34:42] everything came in good and perfect
[00:34:44] makes me feel like I like we did
[00:34:45] something right that makes any
[00:34:47] sense because I I always get worried
[00:34:50] that like with packaging because I've
[00:34:51] had it happen before where I sent
[00:34:53] something or I got something delivered
[00:34:55] to me and it just it came in really bad
[00:34:58] condition it wasn't really their fault
[00:35:00] because they shipped it out but at the
[00:35:02] same time the packaging was like not the
[00:35:04] best on it so I I so I try sometimes I
[00:35:07] like overpack the way I do it but
[00:35:11] whatever everybody gets their stuff and
[00:35:13] they're happy and that was completely
[00:35:18] wrong uh why did that not
[00:35:24] work why didn't that work
[00:35:33] there we
[00:35:45] go we'll call
[00:35:52] that yes we'll do that 47 I'm going to
[00:35:55] put those three on for if you want to
[00:35:57] try your luck on them that's actually a
[00:36:00] pretty good deal really good deal
[00:36:02] actually H
[00:36:03] whatever sometimes my math is good
[00:36:05] sometimes it's a little off but I
[00:36:07] generally am pretty good with
[00:36:11] it oh you didn't know we were in the
[00:36:13] home state yeah I saw I saw when you
[00:36:14] guys I print out people's labels and I'm
[00:36:17] like oh yeah sometimes I I maybe you I'm

[00:46:45] slowly because I'm not seeing the one
[00:46:48] that you're talking

[00:46:51] the pack rats which I have up there

[00:47:13] controls an artifact or enchantment
[00:47:15] creates a two two green bear creature

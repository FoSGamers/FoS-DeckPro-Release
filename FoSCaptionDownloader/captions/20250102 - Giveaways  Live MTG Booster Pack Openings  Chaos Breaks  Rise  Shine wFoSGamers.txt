[00:02:52] work yeah I had to move the House Marina
[00:02:54] called said move the house so I had had
[00:02:57] had some issues I thought I was going to
[00:02:58] be connected but I forgot I didn't
[00:03:00] connect to the marina Wi-Fi and I was on
[00:03:02] BL on my uh on my um starlink and I
[00:03:04] realized oh crap I didn't have the
[00:03:06] generator or anything running so that
[00:03:07] shut us all down so I'm sorry about that
[00:03:10] next time if we have to do anything you

[00:03:42] should be live on everything
[00:03:45] working should have no issues anymore
[00:03:48] with anything stopping we should be live
[00:03:50] completely running and then we'll uh

[00:04:01] I've missed some people talking I just
[00:04:03] literally U missed some had some issues
[00:04:05] here so what I'm going to do though I do
[00:04:09] have to add in couple of things though I
[00:04:11] forgot to add in for um giveaways here
[00:04:14] let me do that and add in some
[00:04:16] giveaways for all of you here for you
[00:04:20] guys that are uh hanging out with us i'
[00:04:22] like to put in some buyers
[00:04:24] ones but uh so I'm sorry about the
[00:04:26] people from the last one I can't really
[00:04:28] do anything about that it's just pain in
[00:04:29] the sorry about that for getting the
[00:04:30] things from before I just I can't really
[00:04:32] do anything there just whatnot I'll have
[00:04:34] to talk to whatnot and see if there's a
[00:04:35] way for in the future be like can you
[00:04:38] like not close the show uh if it's
[00:04:41] fluctuating Because the
[00:04:43] Internet and then uh like cancel it or
[00:04:46] shut it down that way I can like restart
[00:04:47] it that would be very nice if there was
[00:04:49] a way to restart the
[00:04:52] show yeah that' be nice yeah I know
[00:04:57] singles
[00:05:00] here we go well there's a buyer one
[00:05:03] we're going to put in we'll put in one
[00:05:04] buyer
[00:05:07] one buyer single there you
[00:05:11] go put those in then going to put in the
[00:05:14] ones for
[00:05:20] uh buyer
[00:05:27] pack we go
[00:05:32] put that in
[00:05:35] there yeah it's like I wish they would
[00:05:37] have been like yeah you can restart it
[00:05:38] like but I'm guessing it was like it was
[00:05:40] probably down for too long or had the
[00:05:42] certain type of like end connection that
[00:05:45] it
[00:05:46] said is my
[00:05:49] guess so just shut it
[00:05:51] down oh hand is broken and it's going to
[00:05:54] be that way permanently the uh the
[00:05:56] doctor when we went there he looked at
[00:05:59] it and Doctor goes yeah um we can't do
[00:06:02] it we we could try to fix that but
[00:06:04] there's a 5% chance it'll gain the
[00:06:05] motion back in the tip of your finger
[00:06:07] and being that it's only the tip of your
[00:06:09] finger it's not really that necessary to
[00:06:12] have that range of motion for the
[00:06:14] surgery that you'll end up doing which
[00:06:16] is going to be also significantly it can
[00:06:19] cause pain afterwards and not even make
[00:06:22] not even work and it could you could end
[00:06:24] up having less motion range of motion
[00:06:26] later on after the surgery just because
[00:06:28] of how the surgery can cause it to have
[00:06:30] less range of motion I'm like ah you
[00:06:31] know what I'll just go with a slightly
[00:06:33] Not Bent finger for the rest of my life
[00:06:35] um and I'm I'm good with
[00:06:37] that so that's what happened
[00:06:40] there yeah that's not a bad idea I can
[00:06:42] do that for you guys Nico I we could do
[00:06:45] that that's actually not a bad one I
[00:06:46] could do
[00:06:47] there that's not a bad one I could do
[00:06:50] that now let me um figure out I think
[00:06:54] everything in here now the adventures
[00:06:56] prun screen
[00:06:59] all
[00:07:02] righty yeah dude it's what am I going to
[00:07:04] do it's not going to do anything I do
[00:07:06] have determination I do have some
[00:07:08] determination to get things done I don't
[00:07:10] like when things don't work the way I
[00:07:11] want them to it annoys me so I got to
[00:07:15] figure out how to get it
[00:07:17] working and I did we got it working and
[00:07:19] we're kind of we're kind of back a
[00:07:20] little a little a little off kilter here
[00:07:23] but we'll fix it
[00:07:30] yep let's move that around there we go
[00:07:34] had to move uh some
[00:07:38] cables had to move some cables
[00:07:42] around there we
[00:07:45] go move that cable around that way I can
[00:07:47] get it over here
[00:07:55] easier there that works better now
[00:07:58] they're out of the way he had to move
[00:08:01] some stuff around I know had some
[00:08:03] determination to get
[00:08:05] back all right think uh yeah well I mean
[00:08:09] the finger what are you going to do like
[00:08:10] it's the literally the tip of my finger
[00:08:12] here that's it this is the only thing
[00:08:13] that will not Bend anymore how often do
[00:08:15] you bend that to do anything with I
[00:08:17] don't really do too much with the tip of
[00:08:18] my finger yeah I know I do a little bit
[00:08:20] so what I'm going to do is I'll just
[00:08:21] make it so it heals and it's bent
[00:08:22] slightly so when I bend my finger it'll
[00:08:24] bend still like that it'll just be bent
[00:08:26] slightly and all the way down so I'm not
[00:08:28] going to worry about that too much I
[00:08:30] mean what can you do I mean not really
[00:08:32] anything I can do other than oh I broke
[00:08:34] it you know so what I'm going to do now
[00:08:38] though is we'll throw out uh this sacred
[00:08:41] Foundry like I was planning on doing
[00:08:44] before create a temporary listing we're
[00:08:47] going to call this one a on
[00:08:52] screen single ores singles then what is
[00:08:58] shown
[00:09:00] SL
[00:09:01] said during the live
[00:09:05] period starting price we'll start that
[00:09:08] that
[00:09:11] many then we're going to go like
[00:09:14] this then we're going to do
[00:09:18] that all right run that there yeah I can
[00:09:21] type it's just I'm it's going to take me
[00:09:23] a little bit to get used to it because
[00:09:24] the finger doesn't
[00:09:26] um I it hurts right now so I can't use
[00:09:28] it at the moment but once done I should
[00:09:29] be able to type with it cuz that's why
[00:09:31] partially the reason why I was bending
[00:09:32] it a little having it bent saved as a
[00:09:34] bent position so
[00:09:39] yeah yeah I mean it's like how often do
[00:09:41] you use a pinky I'm great I can't pick
[00:09:43] my nose that well anymore I mean I all
[00:09:45] right I'll use my other hand if I need
[00:09:48] to why do you get well that's kind of
[00:09:51] what I was getting at like I don't
[00:09:52] really pick my nose
[00:09:55] so yeah you do all right here we go
[00:09:57] we're going to do this and we're going
[00:09:59] to put out this for this is a $20 card

[00:27:15] picked out Nolan there's only three
[00:27:17] spots left currently in this break and
[00:27:19] then we'll do some adventuring for those
[00:27:21] you like to do the adventuring and we'll
[00:27:22] see what happens you'll get some choices
[00:27:24] you'll decide you we you know you you
[00:27:26] beat you beat the pirate
[00:27:29] boss pirate uh what was it uh blundering
[00:27:32] Blackbeard Blackbeard blunder uh Captain
[00:27:35] blunder Blackbeard I think it was and

[00:27:41] your book you found the book on him his
[00:27:44] captain calamity's log it was Captain
[00:27:47] Calamity is what the name was now you
[00:27:50] found it you found the perfect home base

[00:27:58] the crabs there in that treasure place
[00:28:00] oh no worries about it Luke the crab is
[00:28:03] in the Treasure place there all right
[00:28:05] and they get treasure and they repeat
[00:28:07] that treasure on a regular Bas basis all
[00:28:08] right so like they can go back and get
[00:28:10] different treasure and come back you
[00:28:12] might not know every every single time
[00:28:14] you go into this place it might have
[00:28:15] different stuff because the crabs steal
[00:28:17] they steal stuff from people and they
[00:28:18] and they put it in there it might be
[00:28:19] junk sometimes it might be good who
[00:28:21] knows but I think I appreciate you

[00:28:39] to that access there maybe it might be
[00:28:41] uh it might have something to do with
[00:28:42] the rooms and going into them and a
[00:28:44] certain order I don't

[01:10:13] cook up in a giggity in the background
[01:10:15] um maybe for the next time he pop in but

[01:38:50] that brings him down to
[01:38:52] 12 brings it down to 12 for that weak
[01:38:56] one slice and dice coming in with those
[01:38:59] now we have our buddy logar and Miss

[01:39:26] very injured all right I like it Miss
[01:39:28] Nico takes the
[01:39:31] sword and oh I think you got the hit on
[01:39:35] it because you have some strength Miss
[01:39:37] Nico Miss Nico has plus two strength so
[01:39:40] that's seven you got them nice hit you
[01:39:42] barely got him though you got 18 which
[01:39:44] they are needed 17 to hit so you got
[01:39:46] lucky and you hit that injured one they
[01:39:49] are at 12 health and you bring that guy
[01:39:52] down you chop off almost one of his arms
[01:39:55] completely and you bring that guy down
[01:39:58] to one Health he falls to the ground
[01:40:01] he's twitching holding his arm he's
[01:40:02] almost
[01:40:04] dead what are we going to do next so
[01:40:08] close but yet so far hopefully somebody
[01:40:10] can get him before he regenerates or
[01:40:13] something I think what we got logar
[01:40:17] left
[01:40:19] logar all right logar goes in with a
[01:40:22] sword and oh no
[01:40:27] lar it is

[01:40:32] you only have six so it's 12 you missed
[01:40:34] with a
[01:40:35] sword so logar misses with the sword but
[01:40:38] luckily nothing happens because the guy
[01:40:40] was on the ground twitching
[01:40:43] but they go from one Health up
[01:40:46] to seven health and they stand back up
[01:40:49] and he shoots all of them shoot at you
[01:40:54] you decide what you're going to
[01:40:57] do are you going to
[01:40:59] attack they all shoot and they get they
[01:41:02] hit every one of you all of you get a
[01:41:03] shot on you cuz they're getting to the

[01:41:34] getting away from things but not this
[01:41:36] time they go down to
[01:41:38] 87 so now they go after you guys and oh
[01:41:42] they get lucky they get lucky they hit
[01:41:44] but it's a barely a hit on all of you
[01:41:46] that's why it only dropped you down that
[01:41:47] much they they hit you and they only hit
[01:41:49] one of you so lar takes a hit bringing
[01:41:53] Lo guard down to 80 and then Nico takes
[01:41:56] a hit bringing Nico down to 77 not a big
[01:42:00] hit though all right so it's on to you

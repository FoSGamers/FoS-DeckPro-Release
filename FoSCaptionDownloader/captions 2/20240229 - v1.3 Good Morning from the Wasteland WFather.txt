[00:00:04] made there Freddy I don't know if it'll
[00:00:06] work or not we'll find out I think it's
[00:00:09] going to be okay but yeah so pretty much
[00:00:12] what you do is you know you'll get a
[00:00:13] little pull from here this is our our
[00:00:17] our box of uh I I don't know what to
[00:00:19] name this any idea what to name this you
[00:00:21] have any idea what to name this box with
[00:00:23] me I hav't I'm trying to figure that one
[00:00:24] out I have not been able to figure that
[00:00:27] one out yet I'm thinking name it um
[00:00:31] something that we can name it humorous
[00:00:32] for the complainers but I wasn't trying
[00:00:34] to figure it out what's the ceiling in
[00:00:36] the Box there's um like I said there's a
[00:00:39] I have to go look through it there's
[00:00:40] like two merge of Carlo maners cards
[00:00:43] that are three or four dollar three
[00:00:45] three to four dollar between that area
[00:00:47] it is I can give you one second give me
[00:00:50] one second to pull it up I have them I
[00:00:52] have it saved in a little location here
[00:00:55] let me look it
[00:00:57] [Music]
[00:00:58] up
[00:01:00] here we
[00:01:05] go there we
[00:01:11] [Music]
[00:01:28] go
[00:01:31] it's not showing them
[00:01:34] all that not showing them all did it not
[00:01:37] see why is there only
[00:01:44] 17 well there's an outrageous robbery
[00:01:46] foil in there I know that one that's
[00:01:48] correct but it's
[00:01:50] missing it's missing every other one I
[00:01:52] don't know what the other one was it was
[00:01:53] $4
[00:01:55] almost maybe it was this one I don't
[00:01:57] think that one's in there I don't think
[00:01:58] I put that in there because I wanted
[00:02:01] maybe it was that that I put in
[00:02:03] there but where the rest of the cards I
[00:02:07] put there's more than 17 cards in there
[00:02:09] what the
[00:02:12] [Music]
[00:02:13] [ __ ] well

[00:02:54] uer there you
[00:02:57] go you get beat by the boss you back to
[00:03:00] the Vault I like it we're going to have
[00:03:01] to change this direction I think these

[00:03:35] the collector boosters but anyways what
[00:03:37] we're going to do now I like it we got

[00:09:33] Freddy helped us come up with our
[00:09:36] potentially how to name it for the

[00:09:40] figured out what to do
[00:09:42] here um and there we go buddy thank you
[00:09:46] very much we're going to put that over
[00:09:49] here with all of your all the stuff here

[00:10:02] going what we did to change it up myel
[00:10:05] thank you for our buddy
[00:10:07] 49 and um we'll give you we'll say thank
[00:10:09] you uh maybe we'll get something going
[00:10:11] later depending on how many new buyers
[00:10:13] every now and again if we get a chunk of
[00:10:14] new buyers that come in I do feel like I
[00:10:16] should run something like maybe a
[00:10:17] giveaway so I might do that at some
[00:10:19] point so uh if we get a bunch of new
[00:10:22] buyers maybe that's what I'll do I maybe
[00:10:23] that's what I'll start doing like if we
[00:10:25] get so many new buyers I'll do a
[00:10:28] giveaway
[00:10:29] I think that's a good
[00:10:33] idea let's put this up here this is
[00:10:36] quite literally my last I found this was
[00:10:40] found in one of the three-pack
[00:10:41] combinations my children made there is a
[00:10:43] rabne a draft pack that I did not know I
[00:10:45] had left I have no idea what's in there
[00:10:48] I don't even know why it was stuck in
[00:10:50] those three pack things that I thought
[00:10:51] was for some reason I didn't realize
[00:10:53] where they were but anyways this is
[00:10:56] going to be one two and a half to start
[00:10:58] your character off with hey Craig chick

[00:14:29] I have to say this is pretty special out
[00:14:31] of here Mr harber Asher as you know we
[00:14:33] do this to help to keep them stiff for
[00:14:35] shipping you always know I don't need to
[00:14:38] do this it is up to you but it helps so
[00:14:40] they don't like come out of the top
[00:14:41] loader because this baby's going in a
[00:14:43] top loader right now we like that
[00:14:48] one that was a pretty
[00:14:51] card I know that fire that is that is
[00:14:54] definitely a fire art there oh I like
[00:14:56] that art oh that whole card I'm jealous

[00:15:26] a single one because for some reason it
[00:15:28] might be a little thicker than normal
[00:15:30] which is good which means it won't slide
[00:15:31] out of the top
[00:15:33] loader that was my

[00:18:22] ones that I have are actually I have one
[00:18:24] of them and it's in the game My UM uh
[00:18:28] the the
[00:18:31] um oh my God my brain is not is breaking
[00:18:34] right
[00:18:36] now on the
[00:18:40] card why is it broken balin's tomb is in
[00:18:44] here and some of the other high-end ones
[00:18:45] were in here in my book that I had so
[00:18:48] that might be why I don't have too many
[00:18:50] of them at the moment trying to think of
[00:18:52] the others I have now I do have these
[00:18:55] ones though I don't know if you're
[00:18:57] looking for something like like
[00:18:59] this I have um monoc
[00:19:03] Crypt two packs you got two packs oh you
[00:19:07] got the last two packs
[00:19:12] nice no no
[00:19:16] problem yeah two packs you got the last
[00:19:18] two but here we go that's the that's one
[00:19:20] I have there I have uh 12th doctor
[00:19:24] that's a
[00:19:26] um that's a serialize
[00:19:31] and I have
[00:19:36] uh think it
[00:19:40] was we have a one
[00:19:46] ring
[00:19:48] um I think those were the other big ones
[00:19:51] that I had
[00:19:53] left those are the other big ones that I
[00:19:55] had left um for higher end ones I mean
[00:19:58] do have ones that are like
[00:20:00] um anywhere from $5 to $20 too so that's
[00:20:04] what I got there I don't know if you're
[00:20:05] looking for any of those yo
[00:20:07] boy U but I do get through a lot of them
[00:20:10] over time um I have a couple of others
[00:20:12] that um I haven't gone through yet that
[00:20:15] I'm not sure if I'm going to be getting
[00:20:17] rid
[00:20:18] of um like I have some like watery
[00:20:22] Graves and things but I've been debating
[00:20:23] on getting them using them in
[00:20:26] decks and some other ones that I have
[00:20:31] saved so that's um I might have to go
[00:20:34] through
[00:20:36] those to see if there's anything else
[00:20:38] that I can provide for anything but I
[00:20:40] don't think there's anything at the
[00:20:41] moment that I can think
[00:20:46] of doubling season I actually might have
[00:20:50] a doubling season I do not have a
[00:20:52] defense to the heart but I might have a
[00:20:54] doubling season but it's a foil etched
[00:20:55] one from Commander
[00:20:57] Masters so I'm gonna rip open our packs
[00:20:59] though for our buddy since you got two
[00:21:01] of them the last two mystery packs that
[00:21:05] I have literally no more mystery packs
[00:21:08] in this
[00:21:10] house no mystery packs left in this
[00:21:12] house here you have bought them all so I
[00:21:17] have to get rid of that put that down to
[00:21:19] zero because I thought you had had only
[00:21:21] showed one good thing you made a comment
[00:21:23] there and made see for some reason it
[00:21:25] doesn't always show it so I have to go
[00:21:26] quickly to orders and look and see what
[00:21:29] it shows so it doesn't update as quickly
[00:21:31] in the Stream always so we gonna put
[00:21:33] these back here let's do this here's an
[00:21:35] example that would be two strength for
[00:21:37] your character if you're GNA play the
[00:21:38] car uh if you g to play the game I'm GNA
[00:21:41] put these back but that's uh just an
[00:21:42] example for
[00:21:43] everybody oh boy don't want to knock my
[00:21:46] computer over that would be no
[00:21:49] fun you'd hear a big swear
[00:21:54] there zagoth is not foil uh
[00:21:58] um and I think it was 20
[00:22:03] something might have
[00:22:09] been
[00:22:11] 22 and I'm ripping open our packs for
[00:22:15] our buddy because he's been waiting long
[00:22:16] enough here all right and then I can ask

[00:32:55] Serge hoy
[00:32:57] showcase an a Bizzle prosecutor that's
[00:33:01] the first one I pulled out food that's
[00:33:04] literally the first one I pulled out a
[00:33:05] Bizzle
[00:33:13] prosecutor that's the first time I've
[00:33:15] seen that one pulled out is that worth
[00:33:17] anything actually because I've never
[00:33:18] actually had this pulled
[00:33:20] out we're going to do this because I
[00:33:22] feel like this should be worth something
[00:33:24] as a foil
[00:33:25] there
[00:33:30] five rare pack yeah that was a lot of
[00:33:32] rares in that one I know there we go lot
[00:33:34] of good rares in that
[00:33:36] one not bad on those you got one two
[00:33:39] three four
[00:33:41] five yeah one two three
[00:33:45] four five rares in that pack Ro Haram
[00:33:48] Chargers is pretty good I think that's a
[00:33:50] few bucks with ro Haram Chargers and
[00:33:53] Horn of Gondor it's not bad from that
[00:33:56] pack not bad but horag Gondor is a nice
[00:33:58] card this is a pretty cool card in
[00:34:01] general in itself I like that we're
[00:34:04] going to get these things put in a top
[00:34:05] loader and let's see what else we got
[00:34:07] here oh we got some more
[00:34:10] going luck of the
[00:34:12] draw wants to do another
[00:34:18] one I'm G to do this here to get this in
[00:34:20] a top loader to make sure you're
[00:34:22] protected and remember as I said before
[00:34:25] if you don't want me to do this I will
[00:34:27] put them individually in the reason why
[00:34:29] we do this though is to keep them from
[00:34:34] that spawn doesn't want to go in keep
[00:34:36] them from bending and falling out during
[00:34:38] shipping because what I've noticed what
[00:34:40] happens is uh sometimes they'll ship and
[00:34:43] then what they slide out of the
[00:34:45] package or the top loader during
[00:34:48] shipping but if we put them in two at a
[00:34:49] time they don't slide out which is kind
[00:34:52] of cool all right here we go we're going
[00:34:54] with another one with our buddy here
[00:34:58] well you got most rares these days are

[00:39:39] beat by the boss at the end you have to
[00:39:40] go to the vault which Freddy help me

[00:40:19] adventure game here let the luck of the

[00:40:28] being rude there luck of the draw he's
[00:40:31] going to try their
[00:40:34] luck and how you doing NH H how you
[00:40:38] doing and
[00:40:40] gal yeah big big it is a pretty good
[00:40:42] game Rugrat thanks for coming in we have
[00:40:45] fun when we play it I had to make an
[00:40:47] adjustment and I think this adjustment
[00:40:50] is acceptable for how the game go for
[00:40:52] how the rules of the of our system are
[00:40:54] here at whatnot so what we do here is
[00:40:57] you're going to get these two packs I'm
[00:40:58] going to put I mean these four packs two
[00:41:00] each is what I was getting at two and
[00:41:02] two so I'm going to put these off the
[00:41:04] side because this is your character's
[00:41:06] starting strength
[00:41:07] of two strength now you have a choice of
[00:41:11] characters and they are in the show
[00:41:14] notes if you want but I going to go
[00:41:15] through them also those characters are a
[00:41:17] technician a strong human a detective
[00:41:21] and a mutant they all have pluses or
[00:41:23] minuses as they wander through the
[00:41:24] Wasteland dependent on what happens to
[00:41:27] them and what they pick out of each one
[00:41:28] of these boxes so you just got to decide
[00:41:31] what character you want to be and then
[00:41:33] we uh we go from there seeing what
[00:41:42] happens you know what I need to get this
[00:41:44] put up on this other thing so that you
[00:41:46] guys can see the my Matrix easier like
[00:41:49] see it makes seem what each one has
[00:41:50] pluses minus on easier you just say
[00:41:53] which one you want bud you can be a
[00:41:55] mutant a tech techician a detective or a
[00:41:58] strong human are the four characters I'm
[00:42:01] sorry if I didn't ra say that I thought
[00:42:02] I said to check the notes but I may have
[00:42:04] not forgot to say it
[00:42:05] too those are the pl those are your four
[00:42:08] characters you get the choice of and you
[00:42:09] see kind of what happens there and you
[00:42:12] just decide whichever one you want to
[00:42:13] start out as kind of like when you're
[00:42:14] playing Fallout you pick out your
[00:42:16] character at the beginning technician
[00:42:19] all right so as a technician you wander
[00:42:21] through the Wasteland lock of the draw
[00:42:24] you're looking for things that are going
[00:42:25] to help you on you're adventuring
[00:42:26] through the Wasteland and one of the
[00:42:27] things that you need here is something
[00:42:29] that a treasure when you're looking for
[00:42:31] this on this here you're picking things
[00:42:32] up and you're dropping them as you're
[00:42:34] going along the way as a technician
[00:42:35] going oh maybe I can use this now I
[00:42:36] don't think I can may I don't think I
[00:42:38] can can now you pick one of these things
[00:42:39] up if you want me to pick something up
[00:42:41] randomly or you can tell me where to go
[00:42:42] there's 78 cards in here for red 78
[00:42:45] cards for green and 12 cards for the
[00:42:49] blue blue ones and these are H just RI
[00:42:53] 5050 chance of plus one minus one 5050
[00:42:56] plus one minus one and a 25 75 plus one
[00:43:00] minus one and that's how our game goes
[00:43:02] and then you fight the boss at the end
[00:43:04] we see what happens maybe you get lucky
[00:43:08] maybe you don't we'll find
[00:43:11] out move it a little closer
[00:43:16] here I can do random let me know what
[00:43:19] you want so you just pick whatever card
[00:43:21] you want to go if you beat the boss if
[00:43:24] you beat the boss the boss drops some
[00:43:25] loot

[00:43:29] depending on if you have three or more
[00:43:31] it is going to if it's going to be you
[00:43:33] have three point three strength or more

[00:43:37] booster that's going to get dropped from
[00:43:38] the random wind spin Spiel win wheel the
[00:43:43] W random wheel and then um it will be a

[00:44:36] I can help this is going to help me I
[00:44:37] don't know you're looking at items and
[00:44:39] maybe there's something in the distance
[00:44:40] you say one two three four five six
[00:44:43] seven that's what you're going with in
[00:44:45] the distance you see something you go
[00:44:47] umm is this a friend a foe someone
[00:44:49] that's going to help me an item I don't
[00:44:51] know let's see you find a map that is is
[00:44:56] helpful that H helps you along the way
[00:44:59] with your treasure you find treasure in
[00:45:01] a map and you go wow that's weird I'm
[00:45:02] going a little bit backwards here what
[00:45:04] is going on maybe I'm GNA find the thing
[00:45:07] at the beginning I need to fix I don't
[00:45:08] know what's going on here you have one
[00:45:10] two three four strength now for your
[00:45:14] character as it wanders through the
[00:45:16] Wasteland now the last thing that you
[00:45:18] have here is a companion that you can
[00:45:20] stumble upon you see something in the
[00:45:22] distance is it a friend maybe it's a foe
[00:45:25] there are 12 cards here I do have
[00:45:27] singles that I sell um I have some that
[00:45:29] are anywhere from Dollar all the way up
[00:45:31] to uh to uh I currently have I think $35
[00:45:35] is the highest one value card that I
[00:45:36] have um in the singles area number three
[00:45:39] one two and
[00:45:42] three you you're looking and finally you
[00:45:44] see something in the distance you go I
[00:45:45] think this may be oh no it is an enemy
[00:45:50] that was not the friend I was looking
[00:45:53] for the en the dwarf Berserker comes
[00:45:56] running through going give me my map
[00:45:58] swings at you and you drop your map you
[00:46:01] run away with your treasure though those
[00:46:02] leaving you with one two and three
[00:46:06] strength as you wander through this
[00:46:08] Wasteland now as you wander through the
[00:46:10] Wasteland there are one that you cannot
[00:46:12] beat this boss sadly you can bounce off
[00:46:15] of it but you can beat
[00:46:17] Mei and you can beat Owen Brady so by
[00:46:21] beating those two if you happen to pick
[00:46:24] any of those two out to beat you get the
[00:46:26] boss drops their treasure along the way
[00:46:31] their item and you end up picking that
[00:46:34] up and that's just going to be a random
[00:46:35] spin that's going to be a random item
[00:46:37] that's dropped and that is a set booster
[00:46:39] from the set booster wheel so there are
[00:46:42] 10 item cards here there you go 10 you
[00:46:45] find found five you going with number

[00:46:51] and you can't hide from it you go one
[00:46:52] two three four five you must face this
[00:46:55] creature instead of hiding from it you
[00:46:58] pop out and then it's a Watcher in the
[00:47:01] water as you try to sneak by the pond

[00:56:33] um with our box here because uh our game
[00:56:36] here because we had a complaint on how
[00:56:38] something was done so we had to make an
[00:56:39] adjustment and now with the adjustment
[00:56:41] that was made uh we do a little bit of a
[00:56:44] pack deal for everybody can't do a giant
[00:56:47] one because of everything we do but we
[00:56:49] do a little
[00:56:50] one to get everything in here hey how's
[00:56:53] it going this morning you've been um
[00:56:57] you've been working a lot
[00:57:00] seems going to put this up there and
[00:57:02] that's going to be two and a half
[00:57:03] strength for your
[00:57:07] character you don't say what you're
[00:57:10] thinking what oh uh somebody
[00:57:13] complained T year
[00:57:19] thinking yeah Rel love well actually I'm
[00:57:22] going to put it this way buddy uh I
[00:57:25] don't know if it's whatnot doesn't
[00:57:27] necessarily hit them I found a little
[00:57:29] bit out talking to somebody um it
[00:57:33] is oh lots of overtime yeah I remember
[00:57:35] you said we're talking about that it is
[00:57:37] um they it is an anonymous system they
[00:57:39] don't actually go in and check on anyone
[00:57:42] so somebody has to go in and report it
[00:57:46] uh and something that I will say I
[00:57:47] noticed is that there was a streamer
[00:57:50] that showed up interestingly with their
[00:57:52] uh their name from a larger show
[00:57:56] happened to pop in and then uh that same
[00:57:58] day there was a complaint I'm not going
[00:58:00] to say who it was doesn't matter who it
[00:58:03] was but I made a mistake myself in the
[00:58:06] way the game was set up I guess anyway
[00:58:08] so it doesn't matter I made a mistake in
[00:58:10] the way the game was set up so I had to
[00:58:11] adjust it that's fine but um to me it's
[00:58:14] one of those things like hey if there's
[00:58:15] hey guy can you you might want to adjust
[00:58:17] this there's a problem here compared to
[00:58:18] the rules if I'm not trying to do
[00:58:20] anything wrong so my point is I did my
[00:58:24] thing I adjusted it I did what I was
[00:58:26] supposed to here's these three these
[00:58:29] three get you one two and a half
[00:58:30] strength if you want and so what I did I
[00:58:33] just made my adjustment so the game was
[00:58:35] there and it is now I believe within the
[00:58:37] rules so I before I guess um the free
[00:58:40] thing that I was doing for fun
[00:58:48] wasn't buy give you without
[00:58:50] buying uh I have nothing to say about
[00:58:53] that or else I would be in trouble wer H
[00:58:55] thank you wer I appreciate that yeah uh
[00:59:00] but oh nice wer I'm gonna have to go
[00:59:04] I'll have to see and check you out bud
[00:59:07] make sure I follow that so I can see
[00:59:10] it I'll have to do
[00:59:17] that yeah don't get in trouble before
[00:59:19] you start yeah nice selling your extra
[00:59:21] cars hey that's exactly how I started
[00:59:23] actually too and then I ended up doing a
[00:59:25] little bit more with it but then it
[00:59:26] ended up being kind of fun and I started
[00:59:28] doing some more with
[00:59:29] it so it's up to you you know that's
[00:59:31] what we do you get kind of have some fun
[00:59:34] with it and all of a sudden you're like
[00:59:35] you know what let me try something
[00:59:37] myself and then it works a little bit
[00:59:39] then maybe you do some more so this is
[00:59:41] our our packs that we're going to put up

[01:00:11] edition and uh drawings on our cards
[01:00:14] that were given to everybody while I was
[01:00:16] trying to figure out the um solution to

[01:02:12] pretty oh yes I've seen some of those
[01:02:15] ones in those yes they're really pretty
[01:02:17] and it's weird though like I'm having a
[01:02:18] hard time with that they best have put
[01:02:20] that on there as like a placeholder for
[01:02:21] the price cuz they can't be starting it
[01:02:23] at $600 for like some of these things
[01:02:26] that's just
[01:02:27] insane the infinity lands are unmatched
[01:02:30] I know my sons like them so we had some
[01:02:33] he had some um he had some collector um

[01:02:41] any they got any for my kids that they
[01:02:43] wanted to add to their
[01:02:44] stuff so that's why we did that we're

[01:10:55] little different here we play some we
[01:10:56] play a bunch of games here that's why
[01:10:57] we're called fos Gamers all right we do
[01:11:00] a bunch of games on here and one of the
[01:11:02] things we like to do is we play games
[01:11:03] between uh we've been preparing for our
[01:11:07] Wasteland Adventure as we are I am a
[01:11:09] giant Fallout fan I've been I've been
[01:11:11] playing Fallout since the first game I
[01:11:13] waited in line for it as a kid uh so
[01:11:15] with that being said we've been doing
[01:11:18] this thing we call Wasteland Adventure
[01:11:20] where you can pick a character you get
[01:11:22] these packs you buy these packs at the
[01:11:24] price that I put up here and then you uh
[01:11:26] get to pick a character it's either a
[01:11:28] technician a mutant a strong human or a
[01:11:34] detective and um you go through the
[01:11:37] Wasteland wandering through the
[01:11:38] Wasteland and what happens is is if you
[01:11:41] happen to beat the boss at the end of
[01:11:42] the Wasteland Adventure there is the
[01:11:45] boss drops random
[01:11:47] Loot and that could be either set
[01:11:49] booster or a collector
[01:11:50] booster and that is uh and that it will
[01:11:53] do we do a spin to find that and if you
[01:11:55] happen to lose to the boss and get sent
[01:11:57] back to the Vault you have a pull from
[01:11:59] The Vault box here that our friend
[01:12:01] Freddy helped us figure out for the name
[01:12:04] so right now what I'm going to do is I'm
[01:12:05] going to put up these three packs for
[01:12:07] you guys if you want
[01:12:08] them for this amount and you buy those
[01:12:12] three that gets you two ioria and a
[01:12:16] collector booster of Lord of the
[01:12:18] Rings and that's how we get that those
[01:12:20] there and those are the ones for this is
[01:12:22] what is up currently as our um giveaway
[01:12:26] so you would get those that would get
[01:12:27] you two strength or we could just rip
[01:12:28] these open if you don't want to do the
[01:12:30] Wasteland Adventure too people always
[01:12:31] just say hey can I rip those open or
[01:12:34] maybe you want to do multiple Lord of
[01:12:37] the Rings maybe you want to go with an
[01:12:38] original lord of rings now this one here
[01:12:41] being an expensive one these ones
[01:12:43] actually are one and a half strength for
[01:12:45] your adventure so that's actually one of
[01:12:46] the one ways you can get more than
[01:12:48] normal where you could potentially beat
[01:12:50] at the end so the bosses that you beat
[01:12:52] at the end are cards that we Shuffle and
[01:12:54] you pick one of the 10 of them out but
[01:12:56] if you have uh multiple ones out there
[01:12:58] if you go all three of them being
[01:13:00] collector boosters of the of the
[01:13:01] original L of the Rings you could
[01:13:03] actually potentially beat the T-Rex so
[01:13:05] there's potentially having five we're at
[01:13:07] the top there now I'm going to put a low
[01:13:10] value deal on let's see if you guys like

[01:38:01] wandering home to your Vault def not
[01:38:03] completely defeated but maybe finding
[01:38:05] something along the way and we're going

[01:38:17] find something like a Lightning Helix
[01:38:20] that comes and deals extra damage to you
[01:38:22] and you just wander back to the
[01:38:24] Wasteland through the Wasteland to your

[01:38:40] topper all right bud sorry we did not
[01:38:43] have a big hit there for you on that
[01:38:44] Adventure but what I'm going to end up
[01:38:47] doing because we do have people that
[01:38:49] hanging out here I'm going to end up
[01:38:50] running if we do one more Adventure game
[01:38:52] here and we don't have someone win I'm
[01:38:55] going to run a $1 auction on a collector
[01:39:00] booster that's what I'm gonna do here we
[01:39:02] go good luck frenzy Raptor imposing
[01:39:06] vanosaur Gus of wind whisper
[01:39:09] Squad fully grown plummet drth healer
[01:39:15] heightened reflexes ages Turtle
[01:39:18] unexpected things swallow ho
[01:39:22] rotting
[01:39:23] mohar rooting mohar rooting mohar saive
[01:39:27] Thunderman Genesis ultimatum nice little
[01:39:30] Genesis there a dismal Backwater and a
[01:39:34] bird token all right we're going to go
[01:39:36] with your other one here all right gonna
[01:39:39] go with that other one right
[01:39:41] there here we
[01:39:45] go the toughness correct correct you
[01:39:49] have to beat the two so if um for that
[01:39:51] one you would have needed to have three
[01:39:54] strength to beat Owen that is
[01:39:59] correct Garrison cat keep safe dark
[01:40:04] bargain survivors Bond Essence symbiot
[01:40:08] raking claw evolving Wilds memory
[01:40:15] leak yeah I'll explain the game in a
[01:40:17] second here Essence scatter easy prey
[01:40:20] sanctuary lock down unbreakable Bond
[01:40:23] durge bat that's a pretty good hit there
[01:40:26] Gloom pangin forest and your tokens so
[01:40:30] the adventure game here Dan what you do
[01:40:32] is um you kind of you pick your
[01:40:33] character if you look in the notes it
[01:40:35] actually explains the adventure game
[01:40:36] very well you pick your character um you
[01:40:39] wander through the Wasteland picking up
[01:40:41] items through the Wasteland or bumping
[01:40:43] into characters and the Wasteland things
[01:40:45] are the boxes that you bump into which
[01:40:46] is a plus or minus and if you get to the
[01:40:48] boss at the end you could potentially
[01:40:50] beat depending on what packs you buy so
[01:40:52] say you go with three collector boosters
[01:40:54] of L of the Rings it is actually
[01:40:56] potential that you could beat the T-Rex
[01:40:58] if you get all of these AS Plus ones so
[01:41:01] you actually have a 5050 chance of
[01:41:04] hitting a uh because you can beat the
[01:41:05] incinerator too of getting the uh boss
[01:41:09] to drop a collector booster from there
[01:41:11] randomly or if you happen to have enough
[01:41:14] where you get um only two where you
[01:41:16] would beat Owen or mey you actually
[01:41:19] would end up only um you would get uh uh
[01:41:21] the luckiness of the boss to drop a Seth
[01:41:24] booster but if you don't and you the
[01:41:26] boss beats you you have to wander back
[01:41:28] to the Vault aimlessly and on your way
[01:41:31] you happen to find something that helps
[01:41:33] you there we go nice dur bat and an
[01:41:35] ultimatum of the uh Genesis ultimatum do
[01:41:38] that here for you get that put in this
[01:41:41] to protect you and that's the quick
[01:41:43] rundown of the game if you have any
[01:41:46] other questions I will definitely go
[01:41:47] into them more I just want to rip these
[01:41:48] packs open for our buddy that got them
[01:41:51] here all right and you can pick what you
[01:41:53] want at the top um of the screen there
[01:41:55] it shows you all the singles prices if
[01:41:57] you buy them together in a pack deal you
[01:41:59] actually get multiple of them together
[01:42:00] so you can say I want these three cards
[01:42:02] or these three packs and I will put them
[01:42:04] together for you in a pack deal too so
[01:42:07] you can you don't even need to um you
[01:42:09] don't even need to have me choose it for
[01:42:11] you you can choose it
[01:42:13] yourself we're going after that
[01:42:15] Force but I like to put it on I like to
[01:42:17] choose random ones when no one's around
[01:42:19] choosing them and we'll see if people
[01:42:20] like what
[01:42:23] get here we go I
[01:42:27] kite martyr
[01:42:29] Soul lava Dart twin silk spider um zaa
[01:42:36] charm Universal autom automaton
[01:42:39] trumpeting herd Nature's
[01:42:42] chant rocks veteran forgotten cave not
[01:42:47] bad a little throws of Chaos rebuild
[01:42:52] that's not bad there rebuilds pretty
[01:42:53] good reap the past oh reap the past
[01:42:57] that's a nice little hit
[01:43:00] there and a cleaving sliver
[01:43:03] foil then you get a snow covered
[01:43:05] Mountain your AR card which is a sliver
[01:43:08] and an
[01:43:09] infusion for your token not bad the
[01:43:13] sliver a little sliver foil and a reap
[01:43:15] the past we'll take those ones there let
[01:43:19] me put these in your here for top
[01:43:21] loaders in a minute here I feel like
[01:43:22] reath the pass was a few bucks I can't
[01:43:24] remember though but that's how you play
[01:43:26] the game there you can let me know what
[01:43:27] you
[01:43:28] want so and we can do that for you and
[01:43:30] it's up to you what you'd like all right
[01:43:33] so I'll throw uh what I'm going to do
[01:43:35] here before I rip this one open I'm
[01:43:36] going to leave a little bit of suspense
[01:43:38] at the moment I'm going to put a pack
[01:43:39] deal up for those that may want to get
[01:43:42] it all right these are going to just be
[01:43:44] packs and I'm ping at random all right
[01:43:46] I'm picking these at random maybe
[01:43:48] they're good maybe they're not I don't
[01:43:50] know
[01:43:51] maybe you want them maybe you don't I
[01:43:53] don't know but this will get you one two
[01:43:58] and three strength on your adventure
[01:44:01] through the Wasteland there all right
[01:44:03] three strength on your adventure through
[01:44:05] the
[01:44:07] Wasteland and this will start you off if
[01:44:10] you're going to do that here because I
[01:44:12] don't generally put top loaders in this
[01:44:15] will start you off if you want these
[01:44:17] four packs on your ENT through the
[01:44:21] Wasteland you can get these
[01:44:24] four for this which will get
[01:44:28] you three strength on your adventure
[01:44:31] through the Wasteland I'm gonna run this
[01:44:32] for a minute and a half so I can finish
[01:44:33] this up here all right and this is my
[01:44:36] first ioria box topper so I'm going to

[01:51:09] don't

[01:51:24] guys can hear me you guys can all hear
[01:51:25] me
[01:51:28] right everything good you can hear

[01:51:42] day goes well we'll do one of these for
[01:51:45] the end of the day and we'll see what
[01:51:47] happens here and I don't do sudden death
[01:51:50] on this one all right no sudden death on
[01:51:53] this one and it starts at a dollar and
[01:51:57] it's going to go for 30 seconds starting
[01:51:58] here now if you want
[01:52:03] it there you go everybody $1 maybe
[01:52:06] you're G to get it you'll be the lucky
[01:52:07] one to get it we'll see where it goes
[01:52:11] this one gave me a little bit of a
[01:52:12] tingle and I've had some luck today
[01:52:13] pulling out some really good things so I
[01:52:15] don't know I got a tingle from it I
[01:52:18] can't guarantee there's any great there
[01:52:20] but generally when there's a tingle
[01:52:22] recently we've been getting some good
[01:52:23] luck so I don't know let's see what
[01:52:25] happens here maybe you will be the one
[01:52:27] to roll out with like a like a$ five um
[01:52:33] monr that would be insane that'd be
[01:52:38] insane that'd be crazy like a monoc
[01:52:41] crypt for like six or seven bucks well
[01:52:44] look at that Mystic Mystic is gonna get
[01:52:47] it look at this guys no one listens to
[01:52:49] me this is going to be the same thing I
[01:52:51] think that happened yesterday yesterday
[01:52:53] I pulled out an invisible ink when I did
[01:52:56] this at the end of the day when we had a
[01:52:57] good day now today I'm going to pull out
[01:52:59] a monoc crypt and no one wanted to
[01:53:01] listen to me I told you guys you wanted
[01:53:05] a jump in you wanted to be around here
[01:53:08] for it here we go
[01:53:11] Mystic this is what it is good luck our
[01:53:18] buddy
[01:53:21] thank you mic you're always hanging out
[01:53:23] here with us so I appreciate I don't
[01:53:24] mind if you get yourself a good
[01:53:26] deal here we
[01:53:28] go cartographer's companion tectonic
[01:53:32] Hazard nurturing bristleback hit an
[01:53:36] necropolis colossal
[01:53:38] dactyl bat Colony sorcerer spy glass
[01:53:43] Forest Captain storm cosium Raider
[01:53:47] Kellen daring Traveler deep root
[01:53:51] pilgrimage Sun frill
[01:53:55] imitator Restless
[01:53:58] vents
[01:54:01] Mountain all right it's
[01:54:03] not it's not a monocrat but I think
[01:54:05] you'll be happy with this
[01:54:08] mountain not a monoc but I think you'll
[01:54:10] be happy with a roaming Throne foil
[01:54:14] extended art and a dinosaur egg I think
[01:54:16] you'll be happy with that that's what
[01:54:18] I'm talking about guys
[01:54:21] look at that good luck there
[01:54:25] Mystic sometimes people listen to me
[01:54:28] sometimes they don't but the ones that
[01:54:31] do generally come out on top is All I'm
[01:54:34] gonna say it's all I'm going to say
[01:54:36] there and I believe sunf frill was a few
[01:54:39] bucks so I'm going to put that in there
[01:54:40] so we can get it in a top loader for you
[01:54:42] and remember guys everybody that allows
[01:54:44] me to do this they're okay with it
[01:54:45] because it helps to keep it for shipping
[01:54:46] stiffer so they don't bend around and
[01:54:48] stuff but for those those of you that
[01:54:50] don't want me to do it I
[01:54:52] won't crazy that is a definitely a good
[01:54:55] one I missed the do oh that was a heart
[01:54:58] that was a heart that is a good one yes
[01:55:00] roaming Throne is about um I don't know
[01:55:03] like third it used to be 30 I think it's
[01:55:06] down to 20 uh now with the um I think
[01:55:09] it's down to 20 now but it's a really
[01:55:10] good card to play with though because it
[01:55:12] allows you to um have Ward on whatever
[01:55:15] the character is but it copies off off
[01:55:18] off a character that's on your
[01:55:19] Battlefield so it becomes that same copy
[01:55:21] and it's an awesome card that you can do
[01:55:23] that with so it's a really good card to
[01:55:26] play definitely a good card to be
[01:55:28] playing with there and there we go GNA
[01:55:31] do this here and give me one minute here
[01:55:35] give me one minute here give me a minute
[01:55:37] we're GNA do something else before I'm
[01:55:40] done for the day we're GNA do something
[01:55:43] else before I'm done for the day all

[00:01:10] work which I don't know if it's a good
[00:01:12] thing or a bad thing sometimes because
[00:01:14] like when you work from home and you're
[00:01:15] like oh what I can get to that computer
[00:01:17] and check that quickly for you then it
[00:01:18] makes it really easy for you to like do
[00:01:20] things but at the same time it makes you
[00:01:23] really easy to be able to do things if
[00:01:24] that makes any
[00:01:28] sense
[00:01:30] I don't know if you know if you get what
[00:01:31] I mean

[00:02:21] I got a few of these in today uh
[00:02:23] yesterday just if anybody is interested
[00:02:25] got some of the uh the bundles of murder
[00:02:28] at Carlo Manor
[00:02:30] get yourself some play
[00:02:33] boosters and a uh spin down counter and
[00:02:36] see what you get out of here one of the
[00:02:38] things that I've I'm wondering is since
[00:02:40] they made the change to play boosters
[00:02:42] one of the things that I noticed um
[00:02:45] a purchaser here Smitty I call him but
[00:02:49] uh he uh he used to buy bundles all the
[00:02:52] time
[00:02:54] and he said that you always hit bigger
[00:02:56] out of bundles if you're going to get
[00:02:57] any set boosters I realized I'm like you
[00:02:59] know I saw do it a bunch of times and
[00:03:00] he's literally bought all of my bundles
[00:03:02] at one point then I go and I see see um
[00:03:05] tried a couple of them myself I'm like

[00:08:49] of busy stuff well quite frankly put it
[00:08:52] this way last La uh this week I've had
[00:08:55] to redo something three times because I
[00:08:56] was given the wrong documentation twice
[00:08:59] at work so my job had been three times
[00:09:01] harder this week than normal for that
[00:09:04] reason um so yeah that's why I have not
[00:09:07] been able to get that box done um just
[00:09:10] just that's it yeah that's all that's
[00:09:14] literally the reason why um so but uh
[00:09:19] because normally what I do is I'll sit
[00:09:20] during meetings and I'll do I'll do like
[00:09:22] my stuff here while I listen to people
[00:09:23] because I don't really need to listen to
[00:09:24] some of the quite frankly half half time
[00:09:27] I'm done with what they're talking about
[00:09:30] um so I just like sit there and listen
[00:09:33] and I do other stuff on the
[00:09:39] side yo exactly oh that's definitely
[00:09:42] right definitely dude I'm telling you
[00:09:43] off no way this is wrong no way this is
[00:09:46] wrong like uh this doesn't this the
[00:09:48] steps don't make sense here uh no no no
[00:09:49] it's not wrong oh that's the wrong
[00:09:51] document I'm sorry about
[00:09:53] that okay that's thank you oh let's do
[00:09:57] it again this was the one you should be
[00:09:58] using but anyways it's all right work it
[00:10:01] make keeps me employed though that's all
[00:10:02] I got to say right all right so we have

[00:11:28] the book is is was $2,222 but it grows
[00:11:32] every time a spot is pulled because
[00:11:34] every time there's a blank spot it ends
[00:11:35] up becoming a mo uh Mur at car Carlo
[00:11:38] Manor collector booster so that's the
[00:11:40] kind of the cool thing about the book
[00:11:41] here as it

[00:17:57] was thinking about it where I saying put
[00:17:59] in a modern
[00:18:00] uh mystery oh look at that little heart
[00:18:03] for you guys of mystery I'm going to put
[00:18:05] a little mystery in there so um let me
[00:18:09] get this
[00:18:11] going we're going to put this on
[00:18:21] for so in here what we have is about 620
[00:18:25] cards there are 10 play
[00:18:29] boosters uh murders there is a Murders
[00:18:31] At Carlo Manor collector booster box
[00:18:36] there are three collector boosters of
[00:18:38] murders at carav Manor and there also an
[00:18:41] AFR collector booster in
[00:18:45] there there's a
[00:18:49] um lost CERN Exelon collector booster in
[00:18:52] there and there is also a I think there
[00:18:55] was one other collector booster that I
[00:18:56] had in there maybe there's oh an EMA
[00:18:58] collector an EMA booster was in
[00:19:01] there um and I think that's what's it
[00:19:03] that we put in there is that something
[00:19:05] that if I ran for a dollar there like I
[00:19:07] said there's like 620 of these would
[00:19:09] that be something you guys would uh be
[00:19:11] interested in or should I wait until I
[00:19:13] was
[00:19:13] done um and get it completed with all of
[00:19:16] them so I can get the box of uh Lord of
[00:19:19] the Rings in there as the high part one
[00:19:21] do that something you'd be interesting
[00:19:22] for me to start it
[00:19:25] now all boosters are mystery boosters
[00:19:27] that isre
[00:19:29] correct that is
[00:19:32] correct all boosters are mystery
[00:19:34] boosters that is correct you know it's
[00:19:36] harder it's hard to like but these are
[00:19:38] the special convention ones that were
[00:19:40] only for the
[00:19:41] conventions
[00:19:44] that we're not going to talk about that
[00:19:46] I'm just going to leave that one alone
[00:19:47] some people are have a sore point on
[00:19:48] that one I like them though they're fun
[00:19:51] but what do you guys think about that
[00:19:52] should I do that right now and put the
[00:19:54] Box on the dollar box there and uh just
[00:19:57] write it out quickly here and see if you
[00:19:59] guys uh want to go for it Dayton dton
[00:20:03] we'll put it in uh anyways that was my
[00:20:06] thought or that was her thought she said
[00:20:09] I should do something since I did a
[00:20:11] bunch of it since I've done some work
[00:20:13] she said you should at least put
[00:20:15] something in there all right I'm going
[00:20:16] to go through so let me look through
[00:20:18] that box of singles that I had here for
[00:20:20] you so because I didn't put a pack deal
[00:20:23] on my brain is scattered all over the
[00:20:25] place

[00:20:34] that covers up half the screen and you
[00:20:36] can't even see your chat it's actually
[00:20:38] very
[00:20:40] frustrating very very frustrating I will
[00:20:42] say that that's all I'm gonna say here

[00:20:59] aoria Exon all right aor Exon that's
[00:21:02] what it

[00:21:27] take a look through some of these
[00:21:35] here I swear I had one I just didn't
[00:21:46] know
[00:21:49] Aela
[00:21:53] ratos I think I wanted to keep that one
[00:21:57] actually
[00:22:01] treacherous
[00:22:03] greed
[00:22:06] dely got a Doppel ganger this one is not
[00:22:10] for sale but this is our invisible Inc
[00:22:15] one we got a nope that one wasn't for
[00:22:19] sale either we were keeping that one we
[00:22:20] like
[00:22:24] that like that one I didn't have a
[00:22:26] different one of that one yet trani I
[00:22:29] have
[00:22:31] so new did I pull the new NIV I actually
[00:22:35] might have the new
[00:22:37] ni
[00:22:40] Tomic you saw Tomic in there yeah I
[00:22:44] know that's my
[00:22:48] uh wheel wielder of law I got this in
[00:22:51] pre-release that was my pre-release card
[00:22:53] that I got to
[00:22:56] it all right give me a second here give
[00:22:59] me a second here I do have a few of
[00:23:01] these do have a few of these to go
[00:23:04] through I hadn't gotten through all
[00:23:06] these ones yet so I have I just had
[00:23:09] there's a few of the new ones that I
[00:23:10] have in here I just haven't gotten
[00:23:11] through them all to organize them in I'm
[00:23:14] not sure if there's a few of them I was
[00:23:16] going to keep there was a few of them I
[00:23:17] was keeping so that's why I didn't get
[00:23:18] through them all yet I'm going just put
[00:23:20] them all here quickly and we're going to
[00:23:23] see what other ones that I had I know
[00:23:27] toic guys
[00:23:28] keeping what are these on no no I think
[00:23:33] those are the only ones that were the
[00:23:35] new ones
[00:23:48] there I think that's what it was because
[00:23:51] I didn't want to get rid of this because
[00:23:53] I like that
[00:23:54] card PL I yes Plains Island on I like I
[00:23:59] wanted to keep all right
[00:24:03] so I think I want to keep this that's
[00:24:06] what it was I was keeping that one
[00:24:07] that's why that one was back there I'm
[00:24:08] sorry guys all right I think these might
[00:24:10] be the ones I have to double check but
[00:24:12] those might be the ones that I was
[00:24:13] willing to go through there that's why I
[00:24:15] had prices on them pull the Boya but
[00:24:19] traded it oh
[00:24:20] nice saw demon boy all right well give
[00:24:24] me a second I did not pull i p I thought
[00:24:26] I pulled the new ni but I I don't know
[00:24:28] where it is I swear I pulled
[00:24:32] it maybe I pulled it for someone else is
[00:24:35] what it was I thought I did pull it for
[00:24:38] myself
[00:24:40] though all right I don't know but let me
[00:24:43] get some packs up here for you
[00:24:46] guys dude I opened so many of them it's
[00:24:49] hard to remember if I open it for myself
[00:24:51] or someone
[00:24:53] else will I at least show the keepers
[00:24:55] yes I'll will show off some of the
[00:24:57] keepers that I have I will show off some
[00:24:58] of the keepers that I have I will do
[00:25:01] that all right so let me get a pack deal
[00:25:02] up here for you guys and I'll figure out
[00:25:04] which ones were the keepers I know
[00:25:06] there's a few of them I was getting rid
[00:25:07] of but uh we'll do that here quickly for
[00:25:09] you guys and I will do that I do
[00:25:12] something like oh what's I forgot I had
[00:25:14] these let's do something like this
[00:25:16] actually I forgot I had
[00:25:24] these let's see what Nick's on takes on
[00:25:28] with a box Hopper oh oh look at that I
[00:25:31] forgot I had that I forgot I had a bunch
[00:25:33] of the Box Hoppers there because the
[00:25:35] last one I uh I sold right off because
[00:25:37] the person wanted it when they open half
[00:25:40] when I open up they go hey can I buy it
[00:25:41] I'm like sh go right
[00:25:47] ahead um I think that's a good deal for
[00:25:53] that that's a good deal for
[00:25:56] that
[00:25:59] by chance did you pull the new Massacre
[00:26:01] girl I did not pull the new Massacre
[00:26:03] girl all right so we got uh this one I
[00:26:06] was keeping I like the Tron tree
[00:26:08] Whispers I don't even know if it was
[00:26:09] worth much but at the time I liked it
[00:26:11] because I liked how it gains death touch
[00:26:13] until end of turn that's why I was
[00:26:14] liking this one here I was feeling like
[00:26:17] I could throw that in in my one of my
[00:26:18] decks there whenever
[00:26:21] you I'm good with this one if somebody
[00:26:23] wants an on the
[00:26:26] trail uh we got

[00:28:07] don't think I'm gonna do one so you know
[00:28:09] what I'm good with those ones being all
[00:28:11] sold if you want
[00:28:13] them
[00:28:18] Kellen so you want me to put uh ethos
[00:28:21] you want Kellen all right we got Kellen

[00:28:26] price is accur let me double check I
[00:28:29] just want to make sure it hasn't dropped
[00:28:30] because I do not like to
[00:28:33] uh I don't like to do that when it
[00:28:39] drops so it did drop but the foil say
[00:28:43] that no the foil is the same yeah it's
[00:28:45] like
[00:28:47] two there is no Market it says a two
[00:28:50] it's 250 yeah the same price
[00:28:53] yeah Rose want me to um now would like

[00:29:26] rapose yeah give me one second I'm going
[00:29:27] to put Kell up and then I'll will let
[00:29:29] you know the rose I believe rapose was
[00:29:31] accurate like I said most of these ones
[00:29:33] are rather accurate because they were
[00:29:35] done
[00:29:36] recently so but here we go I'm going to
[00:29:39] put this up for three now remember guys
[00:29:41] I do take this off of um sudden death
[00:29:45] just so somebody can't snipe it out from
[00:29:47] under you if you really want it but I
[00:29:49] believe rapose was accurate on its price
[00:29:52] of
[00:29:54] uh there uh $8
[00:29:59] but let me double check I believe that
[00:30:01] was right on the price there unless it
[00:30:03] dropped like since the last I mean it
[00:30:05] could have dropped in the last like four
[00:30:07] days and I put the price on that
[00:30:21] ratos all right patron of chaos no it's
[00:30:25] the same price
[00:30:28] yeah it looks like it's the same $8
[00:30:33] there oh I don't know on the special art
[00:30:36] actually I don't know on the special art
[00:30:38] there you go e Ros let me get your uh

[00:31:32] uh my son and I we we were bored when we
[00:31:35] were watching TV the other
[00:31:37] day yeah no
[00:31:39] problem and uh yeah anybody else wants
[00:31:42] any of these ones these are from our new
[00:31:43] stof and they are they should be pretty
[00:31:45] accurate on price unless they dropped in
[00:31:47] the last like three days but uh
[00:31:50] doppelganger
[00:31:52] foil Bane Ripper laava wear faces
[00:31:59] Argos on the
[00:32:02] trail Aela La above and a raila
[00:32:05] Vindicator foils now I was debating on
[00:32:08] keeping these because I almost wanted to
[00:32:10] do like a like a an angel demon deck but
[00:32:15] I don't know I I have too many decks
[00:32:16] right now like I don't know what to do
[00:32:18] you know what I'm talking about I have
[00:32:19] so many decks that like I don't know
[00:32:21] what to do
[00:32:24] there but uh yeah I got put this off the
[00:32:27] side dupe you wanted um dupe right you
[00:32:30] said you were on that one let me make
[00:32:32] sure I write that in off the side with
[00:32:33] your name on it you said you wanted that
[00:32:34] for
[00:32:37] Friday yeah it's one of those things
[00:32:38] that I'm like oh I have the I have a
[00:32:40] dragon my son's Dragon deck that I'm
[00:32:42] helping him with I have my um my deck
[00:32:45] that I like the uh the dinosaur deck my
[00:32:47] um my youngest son has his own deck that
[00:32:50] um that he likes too so it's
[00:32:54] like do you have other single I have
[00:32:57] lots of other singles yeah or I'm
[00:32:59] looking at the wrong version um it could
[00:33:01] have dropped it's a foil version is what
[00:33:03] I have though um Aela which ailla
[00:33:07] because there's two of them there's
[00:33:09] aela's Vindicator and ailla the law
[00:33:12] above and I do have three arts for
[00:33:16] patron of charms I have one patron of
[00:33:19] charms and I keeping the one that
[00:33:21] somebody gave me I happen to get one
[00:33:22] pick one out another one out by Lucky by
[00:33:25] being a little bit lucky with one of the
[00:33:26] p that I opened but let me check uh
[00:33:32] oraia
[00:33:34] La
[00:33:37] Above This is
[00:33:45] 357
[00:33:49] 357 yeah she dropped a lot instead of 16
[00:33:53] it is now $9 it looks like it's about
[00:33:56] yeah so that's fine well that's what I
[00:33:58] said guys I put prices on them when I
[00:34:00] opened the packs which was this one was
[00:34:02] like four days ago five days ago it
[00:34:04] looks like it actually Spike
[00:34:08] down four days ago so that's why that's
[00:34:12] why you get the price like that so you
[00:34:13] see but yeah if you uh if you are
[00:34:16] interested I think that would be that
[00:34:17] would we can put that down to
[00:34:19] nine I can adjust that at some point I
[00:34:22] don't need to do it right now and a
[00:34:23] Real's Vindicator I don't know if that
[00:34:25] one's adjusted anyways at all either
[00:34:28] yeah exactly so many versions these days
[00:34:29] it's hard to tell but you know you're
[00:34:31] right you're right that's why I double
[00:34:32] checked the number it dropped know
[00:34:35] whatever it drops in price they
[00:34:36] do ratos has three Arts I did not know
[00:34:40] that all right so what I'm gonna do here

[00:47:17] mystery carnival game works all right
[00:47:20] this is how our mystery carnival game
[00:47:22] works I'm going have to do something
[00:47:23] here to put I'm got put in the back here
[00:47:28] um [ __ ] I didn't think about
[00:47:32] this hold on I think this will work that
[00:47:36] fits there we go that fits all right
[00:47:38] good Perfect all right here we go here
[00:47:41] we go we have three targets that you go
[00:47:46] after you
[00:47:48] have the Father the sun and the buyer
[00:47:52] box all right and what happens is is you
[00:47:54] pull packs
[00:47:56] out of here now each one of these are
[00:47:57] art cards and they got like a pack name
[00:48:00] written on the back of them of something
[00:48:02] all right and you just tell me where to
[00:48:04] go for the buyer and the sun since the
[00:48:06] son is not here and then I pick for the
[00:48:08] father normally what we do is we have
[00:48:11] the Father which is me pick the son pick
[00:48:13] which is one of my boys and then um the
[00:48:16] buyer you guys pick and then we see who
[00:48:18] gets the better pack and who's Target
[00:48:21] whose Dart hits the target now what we
[00:48:23] do is we open up all the packs whoever's
[00:48:25] packed has the highest Mona value is the
[00:48:27] one that hits his Target you get maybe
[00:48:29] uh maybe a pack maybe an extra card of
[00:48:31] some kind and maybe maybe a car just a
[00:48:34] card maybe just a card maybe a card you
[00:48:35] want to play or maybe a pack but that's
[00:48:38] your uh that's the carnival game that we
[00:48:39] have going on here so exactly Austin not
[00:48:45] exactly Austin and Spa Austin in
[00:48:48] space so what we're going to do is let
[00:48:51] me know for you where would you like me
[00:48:53] to pick for the sun and the buyer we we
[00:48:55] go from there and we'll uh try our luck
[00:48:58] for you see if we get some fun here I
[00:49:01] know my kids like playing games and
[00:49:02] that's the reason why we started this
[00:49:04] actually so like fos gamer stands for
[00:49:06] father or son Gamers if you watch us on
[00:49:08] YouTube there's always a thing about
[00:49:10] father or son when we ever do an actual

[00:49:57] kind of from the front there I'm
[00:49:59] actually going to move the
[00:50:01] front to the back now because you know

[00:52:15] was your greater
[00:52:17] sandworm with
[00:52:20] seven your greater sandworm with seven
[00:52:23] and you did have an nanosaur with six so
[00:52:26] well we have seven there that is your
[00:52:29] high all right going to be a seven let's
[00:52:32] see what we can do here with the Suns

[00:52:39] tough but you know what Raba and um Murs
[00:52:43] at Carlo have stuff that are over seven
[00:52:45] so luckily you didn't get one of the big
[00:52:47] ones with the um with the uh in ioria
[00:52:51] where you get like one of the 12
[00:52:52] creatures because those ones are just a
[00:52:54] pain
[00:52:56] now one of the things I like to do here
[00:52:57] is one two three four and five so that
[00:53:00] we see the spoilers at the end oh wait

[01:09:54] blue to go through here I know I have a

[01:10:03] don't have it in foil but I H I swear I
[01:10:05] had the anime I swear I had the
[01:10:14] anime yeah I had the anime but I don't
[01:10:16] think it was in foil though I I have to
[01:10:18] double check I don't believe it was in
[01:10:20] foil that's my only thing um I if you
[01:10:23] send me a DM hell tide I will double
[01:10:26] check um I know it's in another box that
[01:10:29] I have somewhere else it's just not
[01:10:30] readily available for me to grab at the
[01:10:32] moment I'm sorry that's one of the ones
[01:10:34] that I was like I was debating on
[01:10:35] keeping for something myself which is
[01:10:36] why it's not readily available that's
[01:10:38] all but I don't think I'm G to do the I

[01:11:07] it's nonfoil but I'm I thought I pulled
[01:11:09] out and I had a foil one so I just need
[01:11:11] a double check but like I said it's one
[01:11:14] of those ones where it's like I was
[01:11:15] going to build something I'm like N I

[01:12:54] and law okay so you want this one the ra
[01:12:58] the Aela law foil and the rapose I think
[01:13:01] though so that was eight and eight we'll
[01:13:03] put them on for eight and
[01:13:05] nine eight n 17 I'll put it on for for
[01:13:10] you all right I'll put that on right
[01:13:17] now and like I normally do I do not put
[01:13:21] this on sudden death that way somebody
[01:13:24] tries to sneak it out from you you can
[01:13:27] uh you and you really want it you can
[01:13:28] take it but I'm sorry if somebody tries
[01:13:30] to sneak it out I can't I can't do
[01:13:31] anything about that but there you go AA
[01:13:35] laa foil and a ratos patron of
[01:13:40] chaos foil rapose is not
[01:13:43] foil no problem ptd yeah I have so many
[01:13:47] decks that I'm like I want to build an
[01:13:49] angel Deck with seeing some of these
[01:13:50] cool ones that come out but it's
[01:13:52] like like I don't I don't think I'm
[01:13:54] going to do that anytime soon so I might
[01:13:56] as well wait get rid of this now give it
[01:13:59] to somebody that can use it and then
[01:14:01] when I want to build it in like six
[01:14:03] months or something I build
[01:14:06] it nice nice nice all right let me uh
[01:14:10] let me get your name written down here
[01:14:14] ptd and uh put you on that and for those

[01:14:26] D thank you my friend
[01:14:29] ptd and here you
[01:14:31] are Aela the law above and ratos and as
[01:14:35] people see this was 16 written down
[01:14:38] there on there that's because it was $16
[01:14:39] when I pulled it out of the pack
[01:14:41] obviously I didn't sell for $16 since I
[01:14:43] sold both of these for 17 when ratos was
[01:14:46] eight so we we adjust the prices here
[01:14:48] just what I put on them when I pull it
[01:14:49] out of the pack it makes it helps it for
[01:14:50] me but there you go ptd
[01:14:57] yeah that's like not a bad idea that's
[01:14:58] not a bad point too by the time I want
[01:15:00] to do build it it might even be cheaper
[01:15:01] by then
[01:15:03] yeah buy one get one free on that pack
[01:15:05] deal oh there you go buy one get one

[01:31:00] you're not supposed to press the red
[01:31:01] button good you tried for some good luck
[01:31:03] we tried for some good luck that's okay
[01:31:06] it happens no because now a real killer
[01:31:10] when he picked up the zf1 would
[01:31:11] immediately have asked of the little red
[01:31:13] button on the bottom of the
[01:31:17] gun that's okay we're going to keep
[01:31:19] going through our singles though we have
[01:31:21] some people asking about

[01:31:25] fun though we have some fun with that
[01:31:26] little red button the red button there

[01:31:33] be for you the red button check that out
[01:31:35] bomb if you know the reference to the
[01:31:39] movie all right we're gonna put some of

[01:31:44] surge foil spark Double
[01:31:47] Anime Divine visitation now did you want
[01:31:50] this Divine visitation
[01:31:52] or the foil one I'm guessing you want
[01:31:54] the foil one since they're the same
[01:31:55] price
[01:31:57] right yeah that's what I figured that's
[01:31:59] why I put the foil one over there
[01:32:02] but there we go ohare AR Druid and I was
[01:32:06] lucky enough to pull another one of
[01:32:07] those out I actually a friend a nice
[01:32:08] person who was nice enough to give me
[01:32:10] one which is going in my deck but then I
[01:32:12] got lucky and I pulled another one of

[01:32:47] been a real
[01:32:50] killer

[01:57:26] packs and they have changed since cyber
[01:57:31] conversion all right cyber
[01:57:35] conversion cyber conversion and I
[01:57:37] believe I have a surge foil version of
[01:57:39] that by the
[01:57:41] way believe I have a surge foil version
[01:57:43] of that one by the
[01:57:48] way we keep going through these here and
[01:57:51] if you want any of them let me know I'll
[01:57:52] put them out the sely name on them right

[01:58:06] button no one should press it though do
[01:58:09] not press that red
[01:58:14] button all right I think we are at the
[01:58:19] end
[01:58:21] of my singles
[01:58:23] there all righty I thought I had a surge
[01:58:27] foil of it but I guess I
[01:58:31] don't there we go cyber
[01:58:36] conversion with all my
[01:58:42] might there we go put that back all
[01:58:46] right so you would like these are the
[01:58:48] ones we have we have cyber conver verion
[01:58:49] reenact crime archerage charm Divine
[01:58:52] visitation and personal
[01:58:54] tutor all

[01:59:00] what we have for prices just make sure I
[01:59:03] don't have anything messed up and I
[01:59:04] don't want to screw you out of anything
[01:59:06] like I
[01:59:09] said
[01:59:14] uh reenact the crime is 70
[01:59:20] that looks like that's
[01:59:24] right oh this is reenact the crime oh
[01:59:27] that went up a lot you know what fine
[01:59:29] whatever we'll do that we'll keep that

[01:59:45] conversion cyber conversion extended art
[01:59:48] is is
[01:59:50] the
[01:59:54] 355 foil that did drop so this is
[01:59:58] $8

[02:00:02] just put that on arage
[02:00:11] charm charm yeah that's still

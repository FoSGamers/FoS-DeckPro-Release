[00:00:34] versions of the adventure game uh
[00:00:35] earlier this morning if you go you
[00:00:38] follow me on YouTube you would have seen
[00:00:39] that so that was actually pretty cool we
[00:00:41] got that finished and that was the first
[00:00:43] time I got to finish a version of it we
[00:00:45] are on our second version
[00:00:47] here you're blessed so no stress hey you
[00:00:49] know what man I like that people are
[00:00:51] blessed and have no stress it's a good
[00:00:53] thing when you feel that way it's one of
[00:00:55] it's a lovely day when you feel when
[00:00:56] you're feeling
[00:00:57] blessed there's a lot of people around
[00:00:59] here that say that and I I where I am in
[00:01:01] Florida I'm not used to hearing it I
[00:01:03] grew up um in New England uh my family
[00:01:05] did go to church I went to private
[00:01:07] school that was a Catholic school so I
[00:01:09] heard it there but now the Way's outside
[00:01:10] of that you don't really hear that kind
[00:01:12] of comment now I hear it down here from
[00:01:14] like people at like a bank or something
[00:01:16] like tell have a blessed day or or
[00:01:18] something along that lines let me make
[00:01:20] this smaller like that and it throws me
[00:01:23] off it's a nice thing that I I find it
[00:01:25] nice it just catches me off
[00:01:27] guard South Oklahoma so exactly you know
[00:01:30] exactly what I'm talking about then yeah
[00:01:31] it's a southern it's like a southern
[00:01:32] area type thing I
[00:01:34] feel that's the only thing I can think
[00:01:36] of is it must be like a southern area
[00:01:38] thing because it's always the people
[00:01:40] that are more in the southern area that
[00:01:41] says it and it's it's not it's like like
[00:01:43] I don't I don't know anybody would feel
[00:01:45] that find that offensive I know some
[00:01:46] people find things weirdly offensive
[00:01:49] that would be one of those ones like how
[00:01:50] can you find that offensive somebody's
[00:01:51] just trying to be nice they're showing
[00:01:53] they care about you

[00:02:10] bigger there you go make that a little
[00:02:13] bigger
[00:02:15] there oh oh that was supposed to be a
[00:02:17] little bigger on that side too my
[00:02:18] bad there you go now you should be able
[00:02:21] to see everything nicely we should be
[00:02:23] able to run some of our adventure games
[00:02:25] that way you can bid up to the packs
[00:02:27] that you want to participate on our
[00:02:29] adventure
[00:02:30] let's oh they're too big oh
[00:02:32] no hold on let me make it
[00:02:37] smaller my bad too big move that around
[00:02:41] there we go now you should be able to
[00:02:42] see everything
[00:02:48] better there we go Zoom that there yeah
[00:02:51] there you go now you purchase up to what
[00:02:54] you want to and you can do the little
[00:02:56] Wasteland Adventure we have I had these
[00:02:58] out earlier today this to show you if
[00:02:59] you want wanted to you bid up to these
[00:03:00] and buy a couple of those instead of
[00:03:02] just getting one that's what I was
[00:03:04] trying to show you if you want to do the
[00:03:05] uh the adventure or animated one then
[00:03:07] the one's a little bit different now
[00:03:09] because I changed the bosses out some
[00:03:11] all right now I'm going to put these
[00:03:13] back that was an example I was using
[00:03:15] earlier that you can do multiple
[00:03:17] things but there we go we'll put those
[00:03:19] over there and you can jump in You bit
[00:03:21] up uh kind of what you want
[00:03:24] [Laughter]
[00:03:26] there yeah yeah good point Palmer that's
[00:03:29] a good point
[00:03:31] might as well yeah want them do their
[00:03:32] thing man who
[00:03:35] cares but we have our a cool adventure
[00:03:38] game that we were doing earlier those
[00:03:40] the characters we had built or the long
[00:03:43] version of it if you'd like or we can do
[00:03:45] a the short version where we have our
[00:03:47] boxes you pull from you pick your packs
[00:03:50] that you want to go to you get one of
[00:03:52] those boxes here and then we go against
[00:03:54] through these three to see if you can
[00:03:55] have enough strength to beat one of the
[00:03:57] bosses that we have here now we upgraded
[00:03:59] some the bosses and gave you the
[00:04:01] potential you adjusted the game and we
[00:04:03] did a little upgrades how the how they
[00:04:04] strength those and upgraded the bosses a
[00:04:06] little bit adjusted those giv you more
[00:04:07] potential to beat him now but that being
[00:04:10] said we have some differences in how we
[00:04:12] do our
[00:04:13] um our loot drops now so there I know
[00:04:16] we'll see what see what you all like on
[00:04:18] that for some reason this screen is
[00:04:20] really small here we go let's make that
[00:04:23] bigger there we go that's better I can
[00:04:25] see that better now I can see that

[00:07:16] much I feel like I feel that name's
[00:07:18] familiar but I feel like I've not seen
[00:07:20] it
[00:07:21] recently but I like it gelatin is new
[00:07:23] that's a good
[00:07:24] name all right let's see what else we
[00:07:26] can put out here no one wants to go with
[00:07:28] some time spiral right now so now you
[00:07:31] guys can pick what you want I'm just
[00:07:32] going to keep throwing out random stuff
[00:07:35] now if you want here what I'll do is
[00:07:36] while I pick something out I'll throw
[00:07:38] this on at seven in case you want to bid
[00:07:40] up to something that you want while I
[00:07:42] find some random packs to put out here
[00:07:44] for you and you just would either do a
[00:07:46] custom bid to what you want or a bid up
[00:07:48] to the uh the amount you want here well
[00:07:51] I find let's see if I find some deal for
[00:07:53] you guys something something intriguing
[00:07:56] let's do
[00:07:57] this for Wednesday oh this will be a fun
[00:08:01] one I think this will be a fun one let's
[00:08:03] do this for a
[00:08:06] Wednesday go after some
[00:08:09] uh some triom and some stuff in a
[00:08:12] Boulders gate here we'll put those up
[00:08:13] here in a minute right after this is
[00:08:15] over since no one's doing it we'll go
[00:08:17] with those ones we'll go with two of
[00:08:19] those and that's going to give you one
[00:08:20] two three four but each of these give
[00:08:22] you a plus one so that's a 56 in your
[00:08:25] character to begin your character on the
[00:08:26] way Su Adventure see what I mean all you
[00:08:28] got to do is add them up can add them up
[00:08:30] you get
[00:08:31] more so this will be your uh your
[00:08:33] adventure in the Wasteland
[00:08:40] here there you go for those four packs
[00:08:43] you get those four packs every time it's
[00:08:45] just whether or not you can beat the
[00:08:47] boss now if you beat the boss in the
[00:08:48] Wasteland Adventure what we do is we do
[00:08:50] a Loot drop for you wastelanders now
[00:08:53] when it's a first boss one of the first
[00:08:54] ones one of the weaker ones that you
[00:08:56] know we don't have to adjust the bosses
[00:08:58] for because you you guys are beating
[00:09:00] them so much that if it's a weaker boss
[00:09:03] well you know it's only going to be
[00:09:04] something small that's dropped as a loop
[00:09:05] thing maybe it's a maybe it's a a card
[00:09:08] that's a couple dollars or $ three card
[00:09:10] maybe it's a small pack of cards nothing
[00:09:12] specific or maybe it's something um
[00:09:15] maybe we beat the boss and a couple of
[00:09:16] times and it gets up to the point where
[00:09:17] you're at a a couple of packs maybe you
[00:09:20] beat the boss a few times and you're at
[00:09:22] the point where it's a a collector
[00:09:24] booster pack or maybe you beat the boss
[00:09:26] like 100 times it's at the point that
[00:09:28] that's a collector booster B
[00:09:30] but I have never hit any of those those
[00:09:31] Milestones the highest I've g into was a
[00:09:34] a set booster pack but it's up to you
[00:09:36] guys see where we want to go here so let
[00:09:39] me find some other packs maybe I'll
[00:09:41] throw out some other combinations for
[00:09:42] you guys now I do actually have sorcery
[00:09:45] too I don't know if you guys are a fan
[00:09:46] of sorcery I think the art on it I like
[00:09:50] the art on it it is it reminds me of
[00:09:52] what I consider to be playable art all
[00:09:56] right it's what I consider to be
[00:09:58] playable art that's why I like it so
[00:10:00] much and with that being said we'll
[00:10:04] throw this on here for you
[00:10:06] all see if you like it for those three
[00:10:08] packs which will be three another six to
[00:10:12] begin your adventure
[00:10:15] with those three packs will be
[00:10:19] this two sorcery betas and a Time spiral
[00:10:24] booster right there I mean that's pretty
[00:10:26] good deal for those then you get to play
[00:10:28] The Animated adventure game game maybe
[00:10:30] you're going to be this here I don't
[00:10:32] know you get to choose based on that
[00:10:34] character you choose your character here
[00:10:36] then we wander through our boxes here
[00:10:38] and see what your strength count is at
[00:10:40] the end if you beat the boss you come
[00:10:42] out on top we do a Loot drop or if you
[00:10:45] lose either way every time you go and
[00:10:47] you play you get to get one of these

[00:14:53] a second and remember a couple of
[00:14:54] numbers so I don't think it was a good
[00:14:55] idea to try and you know what I should
[00:14:57] probably start working on that if we're
[00:14:58] going to be buying a boat and traveling
[00:15:00] around in some uh some Caribbean
[00:15:02] countries here I should probably uh
[00:15:04] practice my Spanish a little bit more
[00:15:06] yes that's probably a good idea one two
[00:15:09] three and four all right here we go my
[00:15:12] friend you are a technician wandering
[00:15:15] through this Wasteland and as you go
[00:15:17] wandering through in the distance you
[00:15:19] see something you go oo what is that I
[00:15:21] see and you go oh that is food you lean
[00:15:25] over and you go hm delicious food you
[00:15:27] start munching away yum yum yum num and
[00:15:29] go oh but you start wandering a little
[00:15:31] bit and go wait a minute I'm not feeling
[00:15:33] so good oh no that food was rad poisoned
[00:15:38] you didn't notice but now you have some
[00:15:40] rad poisoning and you're wandering
[00:15:41] around the Wasteland you've gone from
[00:15:43] one
[00:15:44] strength plus two strength I mean two
[00:15:47] strength down to one strength but in the
[00:15:50] distance you seees oh maybe this is a
[00:15:51] friend that'll help me you just throw up
[00:15:53] and as you throw up you lean over you
[00:15:55] lift up your head and you see oh no it
[00:15:57] is not a friend
[00:15:59] it is a
[00:16:02] saproling that saproling comes out
[00:16:07] and wait I just want to double check
[00:16:09] here I'm pretty sure he is an
[00:16:11] enemy he is yes that saproling comes
[00:16:15] out attacks you with a gun for some
[00:16:19] reason because you know wooden creatures

[00:16:26] have shoots at you with their uh their
[00:16:28] wooden bullets there we go there we go

[00:16:56] are we going to do we hope we find a
[00:16:57] friend and in the distance you see
[00:16:59] something and you look and you do not
[00:17:02] see a friend that person comes towards
[00:17:04] you as an enemy the detective tries to
[00:17:06] trick you he tells you need to take a

[00:17:31] got to wander towards that thing find
[00:17:33] some safety but you have one in 20 to go
[00:17:37] through here since I said we upgraded
[00:17:38] and adjusted our
[00:17:40] bosses I may have an animation I may not
[00:17:42] depending on which boss has pulled out
[00:17:44] but let's see which one we get one two

[00:18:23] that Vault and in that safe you get to
[00:18:25] pick one of those envelopes right there
[00:18:27] there's one of 19 you get and I'm sorry

[00:37:38] you all hey what's going on
[00:37:44] noan started out strong here hanging out
[00:37:47] with you all we fuzzing on a little bit
[00:37:49] which is
[00:37:51] fine Sten tall Peak thank coming in Big
[00:37:54] Tex hopefully you're having a good
[00:37:56] evening this Wednesday
[00:37:59] day thank you all watching on YouTube
[00:38:02] I'll put that back you know what maybe I
[00:38:05] will um let's see let's see maybe I'll
[00:38:10] put out
[00:38:17] something oh I forgot I had
[00:38:20] those the adventure well the adventure
[00:38:24] works like this you would choose what
[00:38:27] whatever you would like to up to those
[00:38:28] packs purchase up to whatever packs you
[00:38:30] want here so I'll start it at seven and
[00:38:32] you would just bid at that to seven to
[00:38:34] get the bid lowest or uh whichever one
[00:38:36] is a $7 one which is just a basic thing
[00:38:38] which gives you one pack is one Health
[00:38:41] all right so you do your adventure and
[00:38:45] if you buy one of the other packs you
[00:38:46] get up to plus one for that pack on top
[00:38:48] of the regular one or plus two depending
[00:38:50] on the pack you do but what happens is
[00:38:52] you go through this adventure here in
[00:38:53] the Wasteland by choosing one of the
[00:38:56] characters that you have here as an
[00:39:00] option and those characters wander
[00:39:02] through the Wasteland picking through
[00:39:03] each of these boxes which is kind of
[00:39:06] like a stage and this trip through the
[00:39:09] Wasteland and those stages are animated
[00:39:13] all right they're animated in what they
[00:39:15] do and depending on the character each
[00:39:18] character is different for their
[00:39:20] animations all the way up to the point
[00:39:23] of the bosses where I only have about
[00:39:26] half of the bosses though we just
[00:39:27] upgraded the way the bosses are done so
[00:39:30] the bosses actually give you a little
[00:39:31] bit better chance of beating them
[00:39:33] regularly Now versus how much it was
[00:39:35] before where people had a lot it was a
[00:39:36] little bit harder now you have a better
[00:39:37] chance of beating him to have that Loot
[00:39:39] drop for the Wasteland where you could
[00:39:40] get a $1 pack of cards dropped for all
[00:39:42] you wastelanders hanging out to uh to um
[00:39:46] um try to uh bid on what's up I need
[00:39:49] another signature yeah no I actually
[00:39:51] this here yeah no it that's okay hard to
[00:39:56] sign on screen I get
[00:39:58] but that's how that Wasteland Adventure
[00:40:00] goes you just literally bid up to your
[00:40:02] packs so I'll throw this back out here
[00:40:05] right now and give you uh I'll give you
[00:40:06] 45 seconds here to figure that out and
[00:40:09] I'm going to look at some packs and see
[00:40:11] if I find something for you that you
[00:40:12] might want yourself so like uh let's say
[00:40:15] maybe you want something like
[00:40:18] this with a
[00:40:24] um wa
[00:40:32] this and this see it's something like
[00:40:35] this is what you'd like to I think that
[00:40:38] might be
[00:40:55] intriguing all right
[00:40:59] ah so $9 is for LCI you did that correct
[00:41:02] tall Peak perfect my friend now would
[00:41:04] you like to choose your LCI or do you
[00:41:07] like me to pick it for
[00:41:10] you exactly you got it
[00:41:14] perfect yes I kind of try to make it
[00:41:16] easy for you to figure out all right
[00:41:17] dealer's Choice then we're g to use this
[00:41:19] one because I was about to pull out some
[00:41:21] lcii and add it in to my next combo of
[00:41:24] things here so there we go so here you
[00:41:26] go you got that and that's going to
[00:41:27] start you out with one for the card Plus
[00:41:30] for the pack plus one because it's an
[00:41:33] LCI so that means you have two strength
[00:41:36] in your adventure in the Wasteland here
[00:41:38] all right so what we do is we want to go
[00:41:42] through and we want to see if we get any
[00:41:43] Plus or I mean um help to
[00:41:47] uh help or harm all right is it gonna
[00:41:49] make him stronger or weaker in this
[00:41:52] Wasteland so you get one of 78 for red
[00:41:55] one out of 78 for green
[00:41:58] one out of 12 in the blue and the bosses
[00:42:01] here are one out of um
[00:42:05] 20 which I'll get them all together and
[00:42:07] I always Shuffle up the bosses and the
[00:42:09] ones that are the
[00:42:10] 12 do you want me to do Dealers Choice
[00:42:12] on all of them too because I definitely
[00:42:14] will again it's up to
[00:42:17] you all righty here we go we're going
[00:42:20] through and I'm going to do this I'm

[00:51:17] booster that's gets you plus one and
[00:51:19] that actually gives you plus one also so
[00:51:21] you're going to end up having one two
[00:51:23] three four five six seven strength to
[00:51:27] start your character
[00:51:31] with and a good
[00:51:34] deal with a box oper there oh all right
[00:51:37] I'll put that back it's a dangerous one
[00:51:40] to let go not too many too many
[00:51:44] um lost Caverns available anymore and
[00:51:47] especially with box
[00:51:52] offers let's put out some of that
[00:51:57] with maybe we want
[00:52:01] that here maybe we want that here some
[00:52:05] Ravnica with
[00:52:06] it hey Caucasian man how you doing
[00:52:12] today no Lopez how you doing my
[00:52:15] friend thanks coming in hanging
[00:52:20] out how is your day going it's a
[00:52:22] Wednesday so you I mean you can only
[00:52:24] have such a good day on a Wednesday
[00:52:32] let put that out
[00:52:34] there how are the wastelands the
[00:52:36] wastelands have been treating people
[00:52:38] well so far they got beat by the boss
[00:52:41] but um they came out with a decent pack
[00:52:44] so you know okay you
[00:52:46] know one of those like it treated him
[00:52:48] well but he still got
[00:52:49] beat so but we have our difference a
[00:52:52] little bit different Wasteland though
[00:52:54] now we do not have an animation for boss
[00:52:57] because there now are 20 bosses you have
[00:52:59] better chances of beating your bosses
[00:53:00] now the way that we do the Wasteland so
[00:53:03] now you just buy a pack every time you
[00:53:04] buy a pack it is one Health but
[00:53:07] depending on the pack you buy you might
[00:53:08] get plus one extra or plus two extra or
[00:53:13] for your health I mean for your strength
[00:53:14] that way you have enough strength to
[00:53:16] beat the bosses at the end here and
[00:53:18] there's more lower bosses to beat so you
[00:53:20] have a better chance of getting a Loot
[00:53:22] drop in the Wasteland so there you go my
[00:53:25] friends that's what we got going on
[00:53:27] there for the
[00:53:30] difference and I will throw out the
[00:53:32] Wasteland Adventure so you can pick what
[00:53:35] you want
[00:53:38] here I think I put this out here I don't
[00:53:41] maybe it didn't run I'll run that again
[00:53:43] there those two if you want it yeah not
[00:53:46] bad not bad we changed it around made it
[00:53:50] a little different not every boss will
[00:53:52] have a thing there'll be 10 of them
[00:53:54] instead of there's 20 bosses only 10
[00:53:56] have animation at the moment but you
[00:53:58] know maybe I'll get the other ones added
[00:53:59] in there if people like it this
[00:54:08] way I actually just had a tooth that had
[00:54:11] to have a crown put on it so it's a
[00:54:13] little bit tender right
[00:54:15] now you know what let's throw out
[00:54:17] nobody's been getting anything so might
[00:54:20] as well put this out just to see if
[00:54:22] somebody would want it and I'll get you
[00:54:24] a plus one with some sorcery
[00:54:40] well we are we actually have a plan um
[00:54:43] we talking more about our boats so we
[00:54:44] actually have B more boats have been
[00:54:46] coming on the market though recently so
[00:54:48] uh we might actually be able to move as
[00:54:50] quick as we're hoping and people want to
[00:54:53] get rid of them before um hurricane
[00:54:54] season and we plan on getting one and
[00:54:56] trying get down away from the Hurricanes
[00:54:57] as soon as we get
[00:55:01] it that's going to be a rough little
[00:55:03] Voyage starting out to get used to it
[00:55:06] that's all right I've been on boats
[00:55:08] forever my family have been on boats
[00:55:10] with us too recently so that also works
[00:55:12] out nicely also hey Mike how you doing
[00:55:14] my friend just saw you pop in there
[00:55:17] how's your day going
[00:55:26] I'll throw this out there for you that
[00:55:28] want it at
[00:55:34] this then yeah try it
[00:55:36] out hey CS how's your day
[00:55:46] going hopefully you're having a good
[00:55:48] morning evening I keep saying
[00:55:52] morning not too bad not too bad waiting
[00:55:56] to have dinner with the family here
[00:55:57] figured jump on for a little while hang
[00:55:59] out with everyone I actually had a I had
[00:56:01] a tooth worked on today so I'm a little
[00:56:03] tender on my left
[00:56:04] side because uh it's actually just got a
[00:56:07] crown but the crown is the temporary
[00:56:09] crown is wobbling around right
[00:56:12] now so
[00:56:16] yeah what do you got yeah I hate teeth
[00:56:19] i' I've said so many times I wish I
[00:56:21] could just have them all pulled and fake
[00:56:22] ones put in now I understand why my dad
[00:56:24] did it when he was when he uh was like
[00:56:27] in his early
[00:56:28] 30s he himself did it I'm like oh that
[00:56:31] was probably the best thing he ever
[00:56:34] did you can jump in anybody hanging out
[00:56:36] here jump in it is I just kind of bid
[00:56:38] what you want there I'm G to move those
[00:56:40] away since nobody wanted those from
[00:56:48] earlier the thing that sucks is like I
[00:56:50] take care of my teeth that I brush them
[00:56:52] twice a day three times a day most of
[00:56:54] the time definely twice a day and I use
[00:56:56] like a a water pick thing so it blows
[00:56:58] everything off too because it's a a
[00:56:59] toothbrush attachment for
[00:57:04] it you know what maybe somebody will
[00:57:06] want some Commander Masters we'll put
[00:57:08] this out here and somebody will do one
[00:57:10] we'll do one of these as a one Commander
[00:57:12] Masters after I
[00:57:21] think go a commander Masters say

[00:57:32] would like from this box one Commander
[00:57:35] Masters one Commander masters from this
[00:57:40] box I'll repeat that one Commander
[00:57:42] masters from this box which will get you
[00:57:45] uh three for your adventure
[00:57:54] strength yeah I think I knocked the
[00:57:56] Crown when I was doing something earlier
[00:57:57] so now it's wobbling which makes it even
[00:58:02] worse all righty let's see

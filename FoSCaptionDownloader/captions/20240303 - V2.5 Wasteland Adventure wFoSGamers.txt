[01:03:21] strength three strength two strength
[01:03:24] Adventure one huge transf for year
[01:03:25] adventure to the Wasteland I have more
[01:03:28] packs I'll be getting in next week with
[01:03:32] my um
[01:03:34] Fallout which if everything happens as I
[01:03:38] hope I may end up having a lot more than
[01:03:40] everyone
[01:03:42] else I may have made a very good choice
[01:03:44] at some point early on but we'll see if
[01:03:47] they follow through with
[01:03:50] it but I be getting it on release day or
[01:03:53] the day after
[01:03:56] pretty much what I did was early on when
[01:03:57] I had a hard time finding things I found
[01:04:00] someone overseas that had
[01:04:02] some and I bought some so as long as
[01:04:05] they come in as their reputable dealer
[01:04:08] that they were I will not have one
[01:04:11] problem and I might actually end up
[01:04:13] having like 12
[01:04:14] boxes but that is only if it
[01:04:18] happens and does what they uh you know
[01:04:21] urage correctly cuz I had not been
[01:04:23] refunded I've been told they have them
[01:04:26] so I don't know we'll see what happens
[01:04:28] maybe they will maybe they
[01:04:30] won't I'm hoping I don't get a refund
[01:04:32] cuz I have gotten a refund for the other
[01:04:34] ones for people that said they didn't
[01:04:35] have the other ones I tried to get but I
[01:04:37] have not get refunded for these yet so
[01:04:40] we shall see if they actually show
[01:04:42] up if they don't it's all through PayPal
[01:04:46] stuff so I can just uh cancel and get my
[01:04:49] money back but I'd prefer not to do that
[01:04:52] you know here you go these three are
[01:04:54] going to start for a really good deal
[01:04:56] here going to be
[01:04:59] this that's pretty much getting you half
[01:05:01] off on that uh Box offer there that's
[01:05:04] going to be one two three strength on
[01:05:06] your adventure through the Wasteland as
[01:05:08] you travel as a
[01:05:11] mutant maybe you will be lucky enough to
[01:05:13] get to the end to meet ow and Grady and
[01:05:16] walk
[01:05:18] away with a Loot drop we shall see but
[01:05:23] these are your choices for things I got
[01:05:25] random stuff it's up to you what you
[01:05:27] want to do we're having some fun with

[01:05:32] the stuff here that we got I got that
[01:05:35] there those are the singles that I got
[01:05:36] and that was a couple of that was the
[01:05:37] only one that was a decent one so I
[01:05:39] didn't get good I don't get good stuff
[01:05:41] myself when I pull things out I actually
[01:05:43] get really bad luck quite frankly so
[01:05:46] that's why I don't do stuff for myself
[01:05:47] frequently and I got my family or other
[01:05:49] people do it but if I do it for you guys

[01:26:17] later she starts talking about something
[01:26:19] like she was not even part of the

[01:31:51] something nice there and remember guys I
[01:31:53] actually think I have a radagast of
[01:31:55] brown already so I'll probably end up
[01:31:56] putting that into uh either selling that
[01:32:00] or putting it into some type of oh no
[01:32:02] some type of pack deal I RI I cracked it

[01:32:19] shrink for your adventure through the
[01:32:21] Wasteland and maybe you're going to get
[01:32:22] yourself a free pack of cards where as
[01:32:25] the boss drops loot when you beat it or
[01:32:28] maybe you're going to get beat by the
[01:32:29] boss and have to crawl back to the Vault
[01:32:32] to see if you can find something
[01:32:34] there what do you want to do today this
[01:32:36] morning guys I keep putting stuff up
[01:32:39] this is I have literally by the way I
[01:32:41] have two packs of ion left so if you
[01:32:44] want any you should probably get him
[01:32:46] soon cuz there's that's very hard to
[01:32:49] find him now I have not found any on
[01:32:51] packs for a long time unless you want to
[01:32:53] spend a lot more money than they had
[01:32:56] previously been and I don't want to
[01:32:57] spend like $300 on something that should
[01:33:00] be $200 for a box that's my problem some
[01:33:03] of this that's why I don't buy them all
[01:33:04] the time but with what's going on with
[01:33:07] our
[01:33:09] uh Magic and Wizards of the Coast have
[01:33:12] decided to do
[01:33:14] things this thing is going to H I
[01:33:16] believe this is going to happen a lot
[01:33:17] more frequently what I see going on now
[01:33:21] is I said this to staff my wife
[01:33:25] probably I don't know month and a half
[01:33:28] probably actually probably two three
[01:33:29] months ago now two three months ago when
[01:33:31] I was actually trying to get huh chras
[01:33:33] Christmas it was when I was trying to
[01:33:35] get some stuff and I was having a hard
[01:33:36] time finding things so what um what I
[01:33:39] said was I'm like magic is going to
[01:33:42] start moving away from the stores
[01:33:44] because they don't care about stores
[01:33:45] they only care about making money now
[01:33:47] they used to care about stores and
[01:33:49] growing the community but they're not
[01:33:50] that anymore because the new people that
[01:33:52] took over now the new people that took
[01:33:54] over are money people hey hell tide good
[01:33:57] how you doing buddy hopefully you're
[01:33:59] having a good
[01:34:01] day as scuba Zen Zig thanks coming in
[01:34:05] Nick we're putting these up here for our
[01:34:07] pack deal see if guys want it oh no did
[01:34:10] I have that right sorry one second that
[01:34:12] did not go on there but what I was
[01:34:14] saying was here I believe that magic and
[01:34:18] wild I mean uh where is the coast
[01:34:22] is now sending everything to uh why is
[01:34:25] that not doing everything to W to uh
[01:34:29] Amazon or big box stores because they
[01:34:32] are able to get more money from it and
[01:34:34] the people that are there are only
[01:34:35] worried about money now the people that
[01:34:37] have came in um they're they're business
[01:34:39] type people I've worked with them many
[01:34:42] many
[01:34:43] years uh and I know those type of people
[01:34:46] you're almost off work nice last day for
[01:34:49] the week nice you get a week off oh yeah
[01:34:51] you're one of the people that has uh do
[01:34:53] week on WE off
[01:34:56] thing oil field or something like that
[01:34:58] right there going to be one two strength
[01:35:01] for your adventure through the
[01:35:02] Wasteland so what's going to happen is
[01:35:04] Wizards is going to start sending all
[01:35:06] the cards and packs to um Walmart and
[01:35:11] and uh Amazon because Amazon is going to
[01:35:13] set the price for them and they have to
[01:35:14] deal probably with Amazon and that's
[01:35:16] more percentage of what is sold they get
[01:35:19] versus what the cost that they send to
[01:35:21] them is so that's the deal that's going
[01:35:23] to end up going on with Amazon and
[01:35:25] what's going to happen for the stores is
[01:35:27] they're going to get a handful trickle
[01:35:29] like they got with follow telling you
[01:35:31] right now oh you're a nursing okay
[01:35:35] there's some other people there like I I
[01:35:36] get I have to like everybody that's
[01:35:38] different you're the nursing I have
[01:35:40] three three or four people from nursing
[01:35:41] my wife's a nurse too three or four
[01:35:43] people from nursing and I always um I
[01:35:47] always get mixed up with who's working
[01:35:48] overnight because they there some oil
[01:35:50] field people that work overnight where
[01:35:51] they work long long shifts like
[01:35:57] nurses going to do this there's going to
[01:35:59] be two strength during the adventure so
[01:36:02] what's going to happen is everything's
[01:36:03] going to go to those places the stores
[01:36:05] are going to get one to two packs or
[01:36:06] boxes at the most because they want to
[01:36:09] drive the profit they don't care about
[01:36:11] the people as much anymore so what I'm
[01:36:12] going to see happening is you're going
[01:36:14] to have to buy them at
[01:36:16] Amazon or you're going to have to give
[01:36:19] be happy to have one or two packs when
[01:36:20] you go to a
[01:36:22] and that's what's going to end up
[01:36:23] happening they're going to want to give
[01:36:24] the stores the stores will not get the
[01:36:26] collectors the stores may get the play
[01:36:28] boosters without a problem they're going
[01:36:30] to get the play boosters without an
[01:36:32] issue play boosters will always be in
[01:36:34] this is one two strength so you'll never
[01:36:36] have a problem with play boosters at a
[01:36:37] store and you're never going to have a
[01:36:39] problem with getting um your decks at a
[01:36:41] store but K like Commander decks but
[01:36:45] when it comes to collector boosters
[01:36:46] they're want to run that price up to get
[01:36:48] their biggest profit that's where they
[01:36:49] can they found that and most what
[01:36:51] they're going to do with those people is
[01:36:52] they're going to have those on those
[01:36:53] places so that they can run it up with
[01:36:55] their percentage now they're only going
[01:36:57] to give a couple of the stores as a big
[01:36:58] run of things I'm telling you guys I
[01:37:01] called this like three months ago two
[01:37:03] and a half months ago and follow is the
[01:37:06] first iteration of it guys telling you
[01:37:08] right now follow it's the first
[01:37:09] iteration of it all right guys let's see
[01:37:12] if you want to get some uh things here
[01:37:14] so what I'm trying to say is if uh
[01:37:17] people like me end up may end up
[01:37:18] actually disappearing because can't get
[01:37:21] stuff anymore from a distributor because
[01:37:24] the distributor is only going to give us
[01:37:25] one or two items because they don't like
[01:37:27] us selling like this online so I'm
[01:37:29] hoping that um hoping that doesn't
[01:37:32] happen but my bet that is that is what's
[01:37:36] going to happen because they see people
[01:37:37] reselling online and the people that are
[01:37:40] reselling online are making money and
[01:37:41] they're not making enough of it off of
[01:37:43] those people cuz sometimes they charge
[01:37:45] higher than what they want and lower so
[01:37:47] that's why we're getting these issues
[01:37:49] that we're running into which is why the
[01:37:51] Distributors no one's wants to go and
[01:37:52] sell online people you have to actually
[01:37:54] have a store now so you're going to go
[01:37:56] those 24 you get one two strength to
[01:37:58] start your adventure so I don't know
[01:38:00] that's what I said I believe is going to
[01:38:02] go on we'll see what happens
[01:38:07] but I only worked with them transfering
[01:38:10] I seen billions of dollars being traded
[01:38:12] every day for a couple years straight
[01:38:15] all across the world so I don't know
[01:38:16] what I'm talking about with that
[01:38:18] stuff I'm an ignorant person
[01:38:21] cuz I don't know I've never seen
[01:38:24] billions trillions actually in sometimes
[01:38:27] being traded but hey that's just me me
[01:38:30] and my knowledge that no one likes to
[01:38:33] listen
[01:38:33] to why' I put that like that that's
[01:38:36] silly but a nice little ratag ass that
[01:38:38] we got out of that pack I'll take a
[01:38:40] ratag ass and all right guys we're going
[01:38:42] to end up doing a
[01:38:46] uh we'll end up doing something hanging
[01:38:49] out here with the family let's see we're
[01:38:51] going we're doing nothing right now so
[01:38:54] let's see if you guys want to uh play a
[01:38:58] different game
[01:39:02] maybe cuz I didn't want to pre-sale my
[01:39:05] stuff that I don't have in hand yet cuz
[01:39:07] I do have two of each commander deck
[01:39:09] coming in for you guys but I didn't want
[01:39:11] to pre-sale like some of the other
[01:39:13] places I wanted to make sure I had it in
[01:39:14] hand before I did
[01:39:15] anything so we're going to do some of
[01:39:17] these here we don't care anymore we're
[01:39:19] going a little slow so we're just doing
[01:39:21] random
[01:39:23] stuff you want it you want it you don't
[01:39:25] you don't we'll see what happens here
[01:39:27] our friends going slow today it's a
[01:39:29] Sunday Sundays are always slow with you
[01:39:31] all I think everybody's looking for
[01:39:32] giveaways on Sundays but that's because
[01:39:34] uh this is going to get you a didn't
[01:39:40] run come on Why didn't it
[01:39:45] run there you go that's going to get you
[01:39:47] one two strength for your adventure
[01:39:49] through the
[01:39:50] Wasteland
[01:39:52] nice got an invisible ink rapose that's
[01:39:54] awesome dude we've gotten um an
[01:39:57] invisible Inc
[01:40:00] uh corvos we have an invisible ink um of
[01:40:05] oh which is actually in
[01:40:07] here hold on we have an invisible
[01:40:13] ink and then I pulled out two other
[01:40:15] invisible inks for um people on live on
[01:40:17] live here so we had some we've had some
[01:40:20] good luck with those ones I actually I'm
[01:40:22] not I don't think I'm going to buy any
[01:40:23] more other than this last play booster
[01:40:25] box of M or Carlo cuz they're not really
[01:40:28] going too quickly and it's I just want
[01:40:30] to sit on it for a while so I'm going to
[01:40:32] just I have this play booster here I
[01:40:35] think this will be the last one I get
[01:40:36] unless it all of a sudden starts to go
[01:40:38] crazy for some reason then I might talk
[01:40:40] to the distributor that I have to get
[01:40:42] some
[01:40:42] more we're going to do some more random
[01:40:45] things here this is going to give one
[01:40:47] two strength for your adventure through
[01:40:49] the
[01:40:49] Wasteland I'm just picking random
[01:40:52] things so you guys can pick them
[01:40:54] yourself I don't need to keep doing
[01:41:01] it and remember to save the show for the
[01:41:06] vault tech special on the eth for
[01:41:08] release day of Fallout because with the
[01:41:10] releases the reason why I'm waiting is I
[01:41:12] don't like to pre-sale anything on
[01:41:14] release day I want to be a little fair
[01:41:15] with everyone the way things were here's
[01:41:17] an exam you know what I'm going to give
[01:41:19] you guys a preview of example of the
[01:41:21] story I'm going to give on release day
[01:41:23] and the reason why I'm doing things the
[01:41:24] way I'm doing it so when I was younger I
[01:41:28] can't remember exactly where I learned
[01:41:29] this story from but I heard this story
[01:41:31] there was an uh there was this uh
[01:41:32] researcher he was over in Africa and I
[01:41:36] was with tribes researching them and in
[01:41:39] the process of researching him one of
[01:41:40] the things that he did with his research
[01:41:42] was he took a chocolate bar he set it on
[01:41:45] a stump when a bunch of the children
[01:41:46] were playing he goes all right boy all
[01:41:48] right children if
[01:41:51] the first one gets this they can have
[01:41:53] the charcoal Park and he let it sit on
[01:41:55] the stump waiting for one of the
[01:41:56] children to run over and get it well
[01:41:58] they all just stood there and then they
[01:41:59] had all end up sitting down none of them
[01:42:01] did anything and went over there this
[01:42:03] went on for about a minute or so and
[01:42:05] then
[01:42:07] finally Wasteland adventure thing nurl
[01:42:09] all right Nori I'll tell you right now
[01:42:11] if you look here you get to pick a PA
[01:42:14] and then you you pick your packs and you
[01:42:15] pick your character then you go through
[01:42:17] an adventure through the Wasteland I'm
[01:42:18] going to tell you the adventure one
[01:42:20] second here let me finish this story
[01:42:21] quickly so the the um researcher had the
[01:42:24] candy bar there none of the kids went
[01:42:26] and got it all right once the kid one of
[01:42:28] the one of the kids finally raised a
[01:42:29] hand and
[01:42:30] said and when he goes why aren't you
[01:42:32] going to get these and one of the kids
[01:42:33] finally raised his hand and goes well if
[01:42:35] one of us have it all the rest of us
[01:42:37] can't be happy if one of us are only
[01:42:39] happy and then the researcher thought
[01:42:42] about that for a second put down two
[01:42:43] more candy bars the 10 kids all of them
[01:42:46] ran over they all split the candy bars
[01:42:48] apart and each kid got a piece and
[01:42:50] that's why I'm doing it the way I'm
[01:42:52] doing it on a release day so the
[01:42:54] adventure game is you would get your
[01:42:56] points here and you'd go through this
[01:42:58] and you would pick out car pick out
[01:43:00] whether it is plus one or minus one plus
[01:43:02] one or minus one or on our back side
[01:43:05] here is another plus one or minus one
[01:43:07] which could be um your what you get for
[01:43:09] your character as you wander through the
[01:43:11] Wasteland and then at the end of the
[01:43:14] Wasteland so you can pick your detective
[01:43:16] maybe you want to be a detective
[01:43:17] wandering through the
[01:43:19] Wasteland Maybe you want to be a mutant
[01:43:22] wandering through the Wasteland but
[01:43:23] whatever you are wandering through that
[01:43:25] Wasteland what happens is at the end you
[01:43:27] fight a boss and if you happen to get
[01:43:29] one of the bosses that you can beat like
[01:43:31] Owen or Mei or the Velociraptor or
[01:43:34] possibly if you happen to get a some of
[01:43:37] the high value packs and get everything
[01:43:38] you potentially beat other ones but if
[01:43:40] you beat one of them you get a they drop
[01:43:42] loot for you which could be a spin of uh
[01:43:45] one of the wheels where you get a
[01:43:46] booster or a collector booster or they
[01:43:49] beat you and you have to wander back to

[01:48:31] for the voltech one which is 3.0 if you
[01:48:33] look at our game on the e8th that'll be
[01:48:35] ready
[01:48:36] then so your choice if you want to um
[01:48:40] jump in on something now but the reason
[01:48:41] why I'm doing it the way I'm doing it I
[01:48:43] gave kind of a little uh little
[01:48:44] explanation my little explanation
[01:48:46] earlier I don't know if uh you were
[01:48:48] around to here some people were but not
[01:48:50] everybody always is I'm going to do this
[01:48:53] for um you know what this is going to be
[01:48:55] our pack
[01:48:57] [Applause]
[01:48:59] deal going be our pack dealer right now
[01:49:02] one two three four so it's one two three
[01:49:07] strength for your adventure through the
[01:49:09] Wasteland you guys can tell me what you
[01:49:11] want
[01:49:15] too I'll follow when everyone else is
[01:49:17] sold out all right so M out I that's
[01:49:20] possible too so what my plan is even
[01:49:22] Amazon is sold out I know I know Amazon
[01:49:25] is sold out everywhere is out it's it's
[01:49:27] nuts so if all right this is what's
[01:49:29] going to happen if it happens the way
[01:49:31] that I hope is I bought 12
[01:49:34] boxes between some places overseas um
[01:49:37] they are all reputable from where I
[01:49:39] bought them from but I've never done
[01:49:41] this before to buy from overseas except
[01:49:43] for like one at a time randomly so this
[01:49:46] being 12 boxes from these people this is
[01:49:49] the first time I bought B that amount
[01:49:51] I'm hoping I actually get everything I
[01:49:52] ordered now if I don't get everything I
[01:49:55] ordered obviously I'll be a little upset
[01:49:57] but it's the same scenario everyone else
[01:49:59] but they always cancel right away like
[01:50:02] if they're not going to get it they've
[01:50:03] I've been canceled before where they've
[01:50:04] like canceled me hey I'm sorry I didn't
[01:50:05] get this or we didn't have this we
[01:50:07] thought we did um and like within a
[01:50:09] minute they canceled but they've been
[01:50:10] like sending me stuff updating me
[01:50:12] letting me know that everything's good
[01:50:13] to go so far
[01:50:16] so if everything works out I may end up
[01:50:18] having like if everythings correctly I
[01:50:21] end up actually having like 12 boxes or
[01:50:25] more of follow to do our game with now
[01:50:29] the way I'm going to do it I going to do
[01:50:30] it like you he me earlier I'm going to
[01:50:31] try to be a little bit fair with
[01:50:33] everyone this is going to be one two
[01:50:34] three strength if you want I want to be
[01:50:36] a little bit fair with the way I do it
[01:50:38] because uh you know my story I gave
[01:50:40] there a little bit ago the chocolate bar
[01:50:41] story The researcher chocolate bar story
[01:50:43] so that's why I'm doing the starting it
[01:50:45] the way I am I'm not pre-selling them
[01:50:47] now I have two of each collector boo uh
[01:50:50] Commander decks if you anybody wants
[01:50:52] Commander decks let me know now and I
[01:50:54] can put your name
[01:50:55] down um I won't pre-sale it but if you I
[01:50:58] will I'll ping I'll T I'll um the day
[01:51:01] that I get them in I'll send you a
[01:51:03] message to let you know so that you can
[01:51:05] jump on the show if you want to do that
[01:51:06] that's the way that I want to do and I
[01:51:08] want to be fair to everyone that joins
[01:51:10] CU not everyone gets their messages
[01:51:12] right away but they maybe want to join
[01:51:13] to try to see what I have so I want to
[01:51:15] be a little bit fair so make sure you do
[01:51:16] save the show for those days if you want
[01:51:19] anything
[01:51:21] we're going to do an adventure looking
[01:51:24] for some monoc Crypts right now all
[01:51:27] right now when you look for monoc Crypts
[01:51:30] we get some good luck here I can't get
[01:51:32] it all the time but I have not pulled
[01:51:33] out a monoc crypt out of this case I
[01:51:34] have not pulled out anything giant out
[01:51:35] of this case this is um the last box I
[01:51:39] have in the last two packs from Exon
[01:51:42] here so it is up to you guys out of
[01:51:44] these last two packs I'm going to pull
[01:51:45] something sweet or not so I know this
[01:51:48] box has not had anything giant pulled
[01:51:49] out of it it but we'll see what happens
[01:51:53] here you're going to get one two
[01:51:55] strength during your adventure through
[01:51:56] the
[01:51:57] Wasteland with those ones
[01:52:00] there pick your
[01:52:02] character maybe going to be a detective
[01:52:05] wandering through the
[01:52:07] Wasteland maybe that
[01:52:09] detective is going to run into a mutant
[01:52:12] wandering through the Wast land boys can
[01:52:15] oh no what will happen here are we going
[01:52:18] to have some luck or bad luck good luck
[01:52:20] I don't
[01:52:25] know I know myel so Li and all this is
[01:52:28] what I've been talking about I think
[01:52:30] this is this is Wizards of the Coast
[01:52:34] test run of their new sales model all
[01:52:38] right that's what I think this
[01:52:41] is wizes the coast is no longer going to
[01:52:45] be sending cards pack uh collector
[01:52:49] boosters to stores on a regular
[01:52:52] basis what's going to happen is they are
[01:52:55] going to send maybe one to two for the
[01:52:59] people that get some and the giant
[01:53:01] stores that spend Millions might get
[01:53:02] like 10 or 20 collector boosters and
[01:53:07] Amazon and like uh Walmart will be the
[01:53:11] ones that get all the other ones to sell
[01:53:13] somewhere Amazon will and what they're
[01:53:15] going to have is they're going to have a
[01:53:16] percentage deal with these people they
[01:53:19] don't have a deal where it's set up
[01:53:20] where they buy them at a certain amount
[01:53:21] it's a percentage of what it's sold so
[01:53:24] they're going to put them on there and
[01:53:25] they're going to Amazon Jack the price
[01:53:26] up on the collector boosters and what's
[01:53:29] going to happen for everything else is
[01:53:30] you're going to have the play boosters
[01:53:32] or the commander decks at the stores
[01:53:35] because they want the stores to be
[01:53:37] playing they don't want the stores to be
[01:53:38] collecting they want people to make
[01:53:39] money they want to make money off The
[01:53:41] Collector stuff that is what I believe
[01:53:43] is starting to happen is what they're
[01:53:45] going to do with that's why we have this
[01:53:48] going the way it is with um Fallout
[01:53:50] right now I think this is their test run
[01:53:52] of that that's why I think every store
[01:53:54] only got like two packs three packs
[01:53:56] three boxes maybe four boxes at the most
[01:53:59] I think it's just do it straight out
[01:54:00] it's a test run for him and I believe
[01:54:03] this is what they going to do in the
[01:54:04] future we'll see but you guys can pick
[01:54:06] your own characters strength you don't
[01:54:09] need me to keep doing this for you guys
[01:54:10] what do you think myel you think I'm on
[01:54:12] a on a smart
[01:54:15] there the people that are running it are
[01:54:17] money people now they're not game people
[01:54:18] now and that's what's the problem a lot
[01:54:19] of the world are being run by money
[01:54:21] people instead of the people that
[01:54:22] originally created something for the
[01:54:24] fact of having something awesome or good
[01:54:28] that's what we keep running into the
[01:54:29] problem with I think we're going to go
[01:54:31] with these for one and a half strength
[01:54:33] to start your adventure on the Wasteland
[01:54:35] here maybe you want to go for a trip

[02:01:46] there one 2 3 4 five cuz we put the
[02:01:49] spers at the end here fire let's say
[02:01:53] some fire here barom Del preso
[02:01:57] meticulous Eclipse Oraka puzzle door
[02:01:59] Sage days walks with the ancestors in
[02:02:02] the presence of Ages to find the deda
[02:02:05] echo around the promising vein where he
[02:02:08] was canonized in Blood by the caparos
[02:02:12] sunborn on a Restless Prairie where the
[02:02:15] compass gnome fought the dinosaurs
[02:02:21] there we go that wasn't a good one there
[02:02:23] that was a bad Mad Lib but not bad on
[02:02:25] Volo and C the frost
[02:02:28] Dragon not bad for those ones we do this
[02:02:31] for shipping everybody knows I like to
[02:02:33] do this so that it stays stiff for
[02:02:36] shipping because we do not like floppy
[02:02:38] floppy things with shipping so what I'm
[02:02:41] going to do here thank you fire we had
[02:02:43] some fun there we had a little bit of
[02:02:45] fun and remember we do have the big blue
[02:02:47] book if if you want the big blue book
[02:02:50] does still have the
[02:02:53] um this is another game that we have in
[02:02:55] the buy now the big blue book here is
[02:02:57] $22 a spot there are 81 spots out of
[02:03:01] those 81 spots there are 19 ceilings
[02:03:04] where most of them almost 10 of those
[02:03:06] have been hit now the ceiling is still
[02:03:09] there which is the balin's tomb average
[02:03:12] is about $27 but that's actually gone up
[02:03:15] because every time you get a blank spot
[02:03:17] now say you hit three which is a spot
[02:03:20] you're going to get an option
[02:03:22] of the uh uh premium packs that we have
[02:03:25] or three of the set boosters or play
[02:03:28] boosters or something like that that we
[02:03:29] have but that um so that is how that
[02:03:32] goes there if you want to play the game
[02:03:34] and we run we spin the wheel maybe you
[02:03:36] get the maybe get like a force negation
[02:03:38] and everybody lives or maybe you're the
[02:03:41] one that's the lucky one that gets the
[02:03:42] Balin tomb that's in there or maybe that
[02:03:45] Temple Garden that's there but we do
[02:03:47] have a bunch of games that's why we're
[02:03:48] call called fos Gamers I think I'm going
[02:03:51] to end up naming the show the game show
[02:03:53] every morning for you guys what do you
[02:03:55] think morning game
[02:03:58] show we have to come up with a good name
[02:04:00] something like uh something catchy
[02:04:03] trying to think of something catchy you
[02:04:05] know thank you fire for playing I'm
[02:04:07] going to get this all packaged up here
[02:04:08] just wanted to um give a little
[02:04:10] explanation of some of the things we do
[02:04:12] for those that may want to play it and
[02:04:15] I'm going to put this up again no
[02:04:17] problem fire we had a good time playing
[02:04:19] that the boys have some fun when they
[02:04:20] come over play it too it's one of those
[02:04:21] ones that uh it brings everybody
[02:04:23] together and have a good time you know
[02:04:25] and that's the whole point of what we do
[02:04:27] here is to have a good
[02:04:29] time maybe somebody wants this for a
[02:04:32] pack deal pretty good for these three
[02:04:34] that's going to get you one two strength
[02:04:36] on your adventure through the
[02:04:38] Wasteland going put this top loader cuz
[02:04:41] I think the cave Frost even the frost
[02:04:43] Dragon used to be worth a good penny
[02:04:45] these keep breaking on me I got a jack
[02:04:48] junk set of uh top loaders
[02:04:54] recently they're very brittle that's why
[02:04:56] I have to make sure that they're
[02:04:58] okay nice one
[02:05:03] there and then we go like that put your
[02:05:07] name on
[02:05:08] it no one wanted to go on an adventure
[02:05:11] there you guys can pick your own
[02:05:14] character
[02:05:17] strength see we're trying trying to make
[02:05:19] a show an entertainment thing all right
[02:05:21] it's a little bit different than the
[02:05:22] other ones we're not just giving stuff
[02:05:23] away to keep you guys in here hanging
[02:05:26] out we're trying to be have some
[02:05:27] entertainment and fun with you guys I
[02:05:30] can do stuff give stuff away on a
[02:05:31] regular basis but the stuff that you
[02:05:34] know I think that would end up jacking
[02:05:37] the prices up you know for everyone else
[02:05:39] that wants to actually buy with that
[02:05:41] reasoning that's why I don't do the
[02:05:44] giveaways that I do I do it a little
[02:05:45] differently I set it up so that people
[02:05:48] that buy for the most part will walk
[02:05:49] away with something so with this you get
[02:05:52] one two strength but you could
[02:05:54] potentially walk away with a collector
[02:05:57] booster if you're lucky versus those
[02:06:00] that the other shows that yeah a bunch
[02:06:02] of random people might be in there
[02:06:03] winning things
[02:06:06] but if you're a buyer you don't always
[02:06:09] get a chance to win when there's like a
[02:06:10] 100 people that are trying to win and
[02:06:12] none of them bought anything yet right
[02:06:14] so that's why I try to do it the way
[02:06:16] that I do it that way when you're buying
[02:06:18] something you always kind of get a
[02:06:19] chance to win something extra while
[02:06:21] you're hanging
[02:06:23] out right well at least that's what my
[02:06:26] thought processes fire void thank you
[02:06:29] for hanging
[02:06:30] out the Char van thanks for coming in
[02:06:35] bellick appreciate it Ben
[02:06:38] air those are our things there we'll
[02:06:41] change this out no one wanted them
[02:06:43] remember you can pick your own character
[02:06:45] strength you do not need me to whenever
[02:06:48] you pick your characters
[02:06:50] though we'll go through and get you set
[02:06:52] up with a deal as long as you get a

[02:13:02] them that I want either the
[02:13:07] um yeah so yeah if anybody has them
[02:13:11] let's do this for some packs we're going

[02:13:16] what we're not going to do two strength
[02:13:17] we're going to do one strength
[02:13:21] again let's
[02:13:24] do this
[02:13:26] again we're going to do this again

[02:13:35] wander through the Wasteland here random
[02:13:39] stuff oh

[02:14:10] strength of the eventure through
[02:14:12] Wasteland $15 a pop it's worth it yeah
[02:14:16] yeah it is when you have the couple
[02:14:17] hundred ARS that doesn't make sense that
[02:14:19] way it's that's way it's uh when you
[02:14:20] have those serialized one that's way you
[02:14:22] know the value and all that stuff too

[02:46:49] the triggers there are
[02:46:52] nice all right guys we're playing our
[02:46:54] game stretch decided he wanted to press
[02:46:57] the red button and he came out going up
[02:47:00] to get a satellite taking out a
[02:47:02] satellite with his uh missile launch
[02:47:04] when he launch the
[02:47:09] missiles maybe you guys are going to
[02:47:11] come out with the whole collector
[02:47:13] booster box of Lord rings I don't know
[02:47:16] that's a big hit in there I don't like
[02:47:18] doing big hit things like that but
[02:47:25] um I think I spelled that wrong no three
[02:47:30] C he that's I did it in the wrong order
[02:47:32] because I feel like there are they they
[02:47:34] um they come out where you don't get if
[02:47:36] you get something small the entire time
[02:47:38] I feel bad for that so that's why I like
[02:47:40] to do I don't I feel like they were like
[02:47:42] an addition thing not a whole game thing
[02:47:44] like you do an addition to pulling a
[02:47:47] pack you want to do a couple of uh
[02:47:49] couple of red buttons type thing but
[02:47:50] people like hitting it I think it's
[02:47:52] interesting but you got yourself some
[02:47:54] nice stuff stretch there you
[02:47:56] go one day you'll hit it dude someone's
[02:47:59] going to hit it there the problem is
[02:48:01] thing is there's
[02:48:02] 16 100 cards we're down
[02:48:11] to
[02:48:12] 1,00 I think I think we're down to
[02:48:15] 1,00 so there's there's a lot of cards
[02:48:18] in there to
[02:48:19] try
[02:48:21] but if you get
[02:48:23] it you're going to go and take out the
[02:48:26] moon you're going to go and take out the
[02:48:28] moon and stret is going to be the one
[02:48:30] taking the moon out he's like oh my God
[02:48:33] freaking out going to be insane we're
[02:48:36] going to put this up here this was the
[02:48:37] pack deal that I was going to get up
[02:48:39] earlier for our um Adventure through the
[02:48:43] Wasteland
[02:48:47] hey when that you know what when that
[02:48:49] happens um you'll there'll be a good
[02:48:51] chance of getting it I will say that cuz
[02:48:53] I've had um I had somebody when I had
[02:48:55] the one ring I had the Lord of the Rings
[02:48:56] one that I was doing when I had the one
[02:48:57] ring in it when um and um they were like
[02:49:01] I'm like they kept buying I'm like dude
[02:49:02] I got to get to work like I seriously I
[02:49:04] literally have to go to work what is
[02:49:06] going on he's like you know what screw
[02:49:07] it let me buy the rest of the Box how
[02:49:08] many cards are there and I counted out
[02:49:10] how many cards and he told him he's like
[02:49:12] I'll just take the rest of the box and
[02:49:13] so we just went through the rest the box
[02:49:15] for him because he's like I want that
[02:49:16] one ring I'm like I'm sorry I like I got
[02:49:18] to get to work dude so I've had it
[02:49:20] happened like that before where so many
[02:49:22] buys out a whole side or a whole box
[02:49:25] that doesn't happen
[02:49:27] frequently we're going to put these ones
[02:49:29] up
[02:49:29] here if you want
[02:49:32] them and start out for a little
[02:49:34] Adventure through the
[02:49:36] wand a little wait Adventure is going to
[02:49:38] be one two strength on your adventure
[02:49:41] through the Wasteland and going to put
[02:49:42] away our our items for our trip so that
[02:49:45] you guys don't uh so that you guys are
[02:49:47] have even chances when it comes to your
[02:49:50] trip to the Wasteland on what's going to
[02:49:54] happen do it all the time my box is just
[02:49:57] big yes well the reason why I did it was
[02:50:00] I didn't I really didn't even want I
[02:50:01] wasn't even thinking of doing it I asked
[02:50:03] if I should do a crazy big box with a
[02:50:06] hit and people like yes do it so I'm
[02:50:09] like all right why not and that's why I
[02:50:13] did it there you guy goes I actually it
[02:50:17] was uh I think it was like 60 to2 was
[02:50:19] the survey response I'm like all right
[02:50:21] well I guess that's uh that's a that's a
[02:50:24] gim that's a gim let's do
[02:50:26] that here we go we're and now when some
[02:50:30] hits that they're going to be like oh I
[02:50:31] mean that's like a by the time they hit
[02:50:33] that I'm telling you guys this is what's
[02:50:35] going to happen so I bought this I'm not
[02:50:37] going to be changing the price of the
[02:50:38] box of everything that's in here this by
[02:50:40] the time it's hit because the way prices
[02:50:42] are going is going to probably be a $700
[02:50:44] box
[02:50:47] that's all I'm going to say is the way
[02:50:48] prices are going up that's going to end
[02:50:50] up being a $700 box and then you're
[02:50:52] going to come and buy a whole side out
[02:50:54] and it's going to make sense to buy a
[02:50:55] whole side out because you're just going
[02:50:57] to buy a whole side out and guarantee
[02:50:58] yourself a box like that's what's going
[02:51:01] to end up happening I get I
[02:51:04] bet not for the whole box not for the
[02:51:07] whole thing
[02:51:11] no uh I think if you did want the box I
[02:51:13] can I might be able to get um another
[02:51:16] one from someone if you did want one I
[02:51:18] could sell that one off if I can get the
[02:51:19] other one for the game so um if you did
[02:51:22] I would double check for you if you if
[02:51:24] you would like actually a box I might be
[02:51:26] able to get one there was one more that
[02:51:28] the person had left um they said if I
[02:51:30] wanted it just let them know so um if
[02:51:34] you want one it is distinctly possible I
[02:51:36] can find
[02:51:39] one we're going to put these up here
[02:51:42] for this if you want them
[02:51:50] to burn the CC and buy the
[02:51:53] box I'm sorry on the CC I'm not
[02:51:56] following that
[02:51:58] one burn the credit card burn the credit
[02:52:01] card and buy the whole box I mean if you
[02:52:03] want to burn the credit card and buy the
[02:52:04] whole box yeah that would be like 1,200
[02:52:07] bucks but you'd walk away with the box
[02:52:10] and but I think now there's probably a
[02:52:12] few other packs in there but at that
[02:52:14] time like I was saying like when the
[02:52:17] pack is when that box is worth $600 $700
[02:52:20] CU that's how the everything's going
[02:52:23] somebody's going to come and do that and
[02:52:24] be like dude that you have one side that
[02:52:27] means there's only 500 cards in that one
[02:52:30] side let me do a 50/50 chance on 500 and
[02:52:35] pull that out when they can get a box
[02:52:36] that's an $800 box that's literally
[02:52:38] what's going to end up
[02:52:41] happening that's what I suspect is going
[02:52:43] to end up happening at least
[02:52:45] this is one two three one two and a half
[02:52:47] strength on your adventure through the
[02:52:49] Wasteland
[02:52:50] here no one wanted to do it so we're

[03:04:47] to pick out your character and we're
[03:04:48] going to have fun with our family here
[03:04:49] hanging out now remember everybody you
[03:04:52] want to save our show for the eth on
[03:04:54] release day I have a na story reason why
[03:04:57] I'm doing things the way I'm doing it
[03:04:59] growing up I was told the story I read
[03:05:01] this I can't remember I told or I read
[03:05:02] it somewhere or I saw it in a movie but
[03:05:05] there was a
[03:05:06] researcher in Africa he went and he was
[03:05:08] going around researching tribes and
[03:05:10] seeing how they were different compared
[03:05:11] to everyone else one of the things that
[03:05:13] he notice was the children were very
[03:05:14] different in how they acted and one of
[03:05:16] the things that they did when they acted
[03:05:18] was that they thought notice was
[03:05:19] different was he tried to one day he
[03:05:21] took a candy bar he set that candy bar
[03:05:24] on a stump in front of all the children
[03:05:26] he goes all right guys whoever is the
[03:05:28] first kid to go and get this candy bar
[03:05:31] will be the one to be able to have the
[03:05:32] candy bar and eat it none of them have
[03:05:34] had a chocolate candy bar before none of
[03:05:36] them even really had like had that candy
[03:05:39] bar before but they've had candy so what
[03:05:40] they were doing they all sat there about
[03:05:42] 10 of them not any of them moved to get
[03:05:45] up to run and get that candy bar and
[03:05:47] then what ended up happening was after a
[03:05:49] little bit he goes why is no one doing
[03:05:51] it and one of the kids raise their hand
[03:05:52] and goes well if one of us are happy
[03:05:54] then all of us can't be happy so the
[03:05:56] researcher s a minute and thought put
[03:05:59] out another pack another
[03:06:03] another chocolate bar I think it was two
[03:06:05] or something like that then all the kids
[03:06:07] got up and ran over and got their
[03:06:09] chocolate bar and got a piece of one
[03:06:11] because they were all able to have one
[03:06:13] and that's why I'm doing my game a
[03:06:16] little differently for release
[03:06:19] day instead of pre-selling on things
[03:06:21] trying to sell it so that no one has it
[03:06:23] there's nothing available I want to make
[03:06:25] it available for everybody to option to
[03:06:26] have I don't want to let one person kind
[03:06:28] of go and buy everything out I know
[03:06:29] that's going to sound mean some people
[03:06:30] may get upset about that but I'm trying
[03:06:32] to do that fair thing that I
[03:06:37] said but this is our pack deal right now
[03:06:41] randomly randomly up here that wasn't
[03:06:43] supposed to be 18 That was supposed to
[03:06:44] be 15 why did that go to 18 I definitely
[03:06:47] put that on as 15 let me run that again
[03:06:50] here that was weird didn't save there we
[03:06:54] go those three packs no it did it again

[03:37:11] wanted to show everybody what it's like
[03:37:12] when you get an extra there you know you
[03:37:14] can potentially get an extra pack and I
[03:37:16] do that on a regular basis though
[03:37:18] because I like to make sure that buyers
[03:37:19] are getting stuff you know that's what I
[03:37:22] like to do I want to have our buyers
[03:37:23] getting things I don't like doing like
[03:37:25] that's why I do everything as cheaper as
[03:37:27] cheap as I can get it and also we're
[03:37:30] generally at
[03:37:32] um uh I don't do as many giveaways
[03:37:34] because I try to have them as low price
[03:37:36] as possible so I don't have to do a
[03:37:37] bunch of giveaways to get people to be
[03:37:39] in here and then buy stuff at at a
[03:37:40] higher price I'd rather you guys just
[03:37:42] get a deal on stuff you know like
[03:37:44] there's not too many places that you can
[03:37:46] get like a COR or something like that so
[03:37:48] I like to have it and I like to have it
[03:37:50] as best of deal as I possibly can get it
[03:37:51] for you so I'll put that one up there in
[03:37:55] ioria we'll put up uh one of
[03:37:59] these and uh one of these for two and a
[03:38:03] half strength on your invention through
[03:38:05] the Wasteland all right I do appreciate
[03:38:07] Sago we had some fun we always have fun
[03:38:10] and that's what you can get for packs
[03:38:12] and your strength that right there tells
[03:38:14] you exactly what it is for each pack and
[03:38:18] remember everybody if you buy multiple
[03:38:20] we do do a little bit of a discount
[03:38:22] maybe a couple bucks off to help out
[03:38:24] with the shipping because uh helps me
[03:38:26] with the PayPal the the fees from
[03:38:28] whatnot and I pass that kind of savings
[03:38:30] on to you guys so here we go we're going
[03:38:33] to do another one here A Wasteland
[03:38:34] adventure with these three packs which
[03:38:36] is going to be two and a half strength
[03:38:38] for your adventure through the Wasteland
[03:38:40] and that that is going to start out here
[03:38:41] for you guys if you want for your
[03:38:44] adventure through the Wasteland maybe
[03:38:46] you're going to be one of these
[03:38:47] characters with one two and a half
[03:38:50] strength with two and a half strength
[03:38:52] it's possible for you to beat the boss
[03:38:55] at the end and come up with a collector
[03:38:56] booster but it is up to you if you're
[03:38:59] going to pull that one off smoke right
[03:39:02] can you pull that one off smoke we don't
[03:39:04] know are you going to have the luck to
[03:39:06] get all the plus ones to come out with

[03:39:57] random but your choice it could be if
[03:40:00] you tell me now I have a question if I
[03:40:02] say I started this just doing it at a
[03:40:04] dollar and then you guys chose

[03:53:52] knows right now I should put that in top
[03:53:54] loader I'll definitely do
[03:53:59] it thank you for coming in hanging out
[03:54:02] hippie hop
[03:54:05] hop they reprinted the Bear yes this was
[03:54:08] a this is the Y uh yog way is what you
[03:54:13] bump into here that's when it's that the
[03:54:15] the that's the mutant Bear yeah I
[03:54:18] know the Y
[03:54:20] way who's going to bump in
[03:54:23] yu I know I have um my Fallout stuff I
[03:54:27] have I'm going to have it in on the um
[03:54:29] before the eth the deal is with the
[03:54:30] people that I made that I get it from
[03:54:32] that I'm not allowed to do it before
[03:54:34] release day but that's also part of the
[03:54:36] reason why I'm doing it a little
[03:54:37] different I I gave an example of a story
[03:54:40] for some people earlier I don't know if
[03:54:41] people were here and they heard the
[03:54:42] story but I um there was say chocolate
[03:54:46] bar and research researcher gives a
[03:54:48] chocolate bar to
[03:54:50] um to a bunch of children in a tribe
[03:54:54] when he was in Africa now the chocolate
[03:54:56] bar was sitting on a rock or a stone or
[03:54:58] or a tree stump and um none of the kids
[03:55:00] wouldn't got it and the reason was one
[03:55:03] of them rais their hand and said if one
[03:55:04] of us gets it one of us will be happy
[03:55:05] and the rest of us won't so the ch he
[03:55:09] put two down two more down and all of
[03:55:10] them went up and got some so they all
[03:55:12] could be happy and that's the reason why
[03:55:14] I'm doing my um my day a little bit
[03:55:16] differently on on um for Fallout all
[03:55:21] right so my Fallout day I'm going to be
[03:55:24] doing it so that we try to allow
[03:55:26] everybody to have an opportunity because
[03:55:27] it is a little very low in quantity and
[03:55:31] I can't do anything about that I mean
[03:55:32] it's literally sold out on Amazon That
[03:55:34] was supposed to be 19 not 29 guys don't
[03:55:36] do
[03:55:37] that or if you want to add in another
[03:55:40] pack of something you can definitely do
[03:55:41] that for 29 I'm good with that so if you
[03:55:43] want to add in like modern Horizons or
[03:55:46] Exelon you can do that for
[03:55:51] 29 but
[03:55:52] anyways yeah a lot of as you see a lot
[03:55:55] of stores have like one or two boxes if
[03:55:59] I have not had it canceled yet I got a
[03:56:01] bunch of them from overseas and
[03:56:04] generally when that happens they either
[03:56:05] cancel them right away or they don't so
[03:56:07] I should be getting a chunk of them
[03:56:10] um like potentially 12
[03:56:17] boxes you can swap out mkm so you can
[03:56:21] choose whatever you want fire boid all
[03:56:23] right you can choose whatever you want
[03:56:26] to start your strength with here so if
[03:56:28] you want to do three Wilds of Al drain
[03:56:31] for TW for 19 I'll do three Wilds while
[03:56:34] drain for
[03:56:37] 19
[03:56:39] that's fine with me I'll put those out
[03:56:41] there all right let's do
[03:56:46] that start our adventure for one and a
[03:56:48] half
[03:56:49] strength one and a half strength three
[03:56:52] Wilds of drain for one and a half
[03:56:55] strength as you wander through the
[03:56:57] Wasteland fir void wants to try a trip
[03:57:00] through the Wasteland to see what
[03:57:01] happens with one and a half strength
[03:57:04] maybe they're going to come out on top
[03:57:06] with a big
[03:57:07] hit and have the boss be beaten maybe
[03:57:11] they're going to come out and get that
[03:57:12] free pack of cards because the boss
[03:57:16] dropped some loot from them and they
[03:57:18] wander away with a free pack of cards
[03:57:21] let's find out fire

[04:31:16] Mom I thinkig I'll be off in in a little
[04:31:19] while here maybe going until about
[04:31:23] noonish doc doc thanks for coming in
[04:31:26] we're doing our game here our adventure
[04:31:28] game where you get to go through the
[04:31:29] Wasteland potentially get yourself a
[04:31:31] free
[04:31:33] booster if the boss is beaten and they
[04:31:36] drop some
[04:31:37] loot maybe it's going to be you maybe
[04:31:40] not today's going a little slow that's
[04:31:42] okay Sundays are sometimes slow because
[04:31:44] I don't do giveaways because the way
[04:31:46] that I do things is I make sure that you
[04:31:48] guys have the potential as a buyer of
[04:31:49] getting something so that's why if you
[04:31:51] beat the boss you get a spin to see if
[04:31:55] you drop the what the boss drops for
[04:31:57] loot but if you lose the boss you go to
[04:31:59] the Vault and you find something there
[04:32:02] you pick your character and what you
[04:32:03] want to be and maybe if you you lose
[04:32:05] yeah maybe you find something in the
[04:32:06] vault that's okay maybe there's
[04:32:08] something that you want who knows we'll
[04:32:09] find out but at the same time it's up to
[04:32:12] you on what you want to
[04:32:13] do hopefully you're all having a great

[04:32:45] the Wasteland now would you like William
[04:32:48] or Nolan or one of I to do random for
[04:32:50] you or you can tell me specifically
[04:32:52] where you want to go on all these it is
[04:32:55] up to you what you do
[04:32:57] here with that detective house wandering
[04:33:01] through the
[04:33:02] Wasteland cuz there's 78 78 and then 12
[04:33:05] for the other ones you'll call all right

[04:33:24] 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 as you're
[04:33:29] wandering through the Wasteland the
[04:33:30] detective sees some things wanders by
[04:33:32] doesn't think it's worth it then sees
[04:33:34] another thing turns over over and goes
[04:33:36] oh look at that food there I think I can
[04:33:38] take a bite out of that but I don't know
[04:33:40] takes a bite and oh no the detective now
[04:33:43] has some rad poisoning and they are down
[04:33:45] to one strength as they wander through
[04:33:48] the Wasteland and you're going to go
[04:33:50] with number 24 here 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 6
[04:33:57] 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
[04:34:03] 21 22 23 24 as you wander through the
[04:34:07] Wasteland of this detective looking for
[04:34:09] a friend that may be able to help them
[04:34:11] maybe an item that will help them along
[04:34:12] the way and they find a power Stone this
[04:34:16] Power Stone does not help the detective
[04:34:21] all right the Power Stone actually
[04:34:23] confuses the detective so much it shocks
[04:34:25] him when he goes to inspect it and touch
[04:34:27] it and he is now down to no strength but
[04:34:31] you know what maybe we'll find a
[04:34:34] companion in the Wasteland that will
[04:34:37] come and help you along the way so you
[04:34:39] don't get a total beat down and just die
[04:34:42] in the Wasteland and have somebody else
[04:34:44] pick your packs up maybe you can crawl
[04:34:45] back to the Vault we'll
[04:34:48] see number eight one 2 3 four five 6
[04:34:53] 7even and eight number eight here you go
[04:34:56] you go wandering through the Wasteland
[04:34:58] zero strength barely able to stand and
[04:35:00] you bump into another detective that
[04:35:03] detective goes hey buddy I know you're
[04:35:05] really tired I'm going to give you a tip
[04:35:07] going to get you up to plus one for your
[04:35:09] strength you're probably not going to
[04:35:10] beat anything but if you hide along the
[04:35:12] way as you travel I think buddy I think

How do i report to mtg that someone has product ealry and is selling it against their rules.

[2025-03-26 06:10:15] ChatGPT:
To report someone who is selling Magic: The Gathering (MTG) products early and in violation of Wizards of the Coast's (WotC) rules, follow these steps:

### 1. **Gather Evidence**
Collect as much supporting information as possible, such as:
- Screenshots of listings or live sales
- URLs to the offending seller’s store or stream
- Dates and timestamps
- Product details (e.g., "Outlaws of Thunder Junction Collector Booster listed on [platform] on [date]")

### 2. **Contact Wizards of the Coast Directly**
Use WotC's official reporting channels:

#### A. **Report Violations to WPN (Wizards Play Network)**
If the seller is a WPN retailer or store:
- Email: **WPNsupport@wizards.com**
- Include all evidence and a brief, factual description of the violation.

#### B. **General Violations or Early Sales**
If it’s not a WPN store, use WotC's general customer support form:
- Go to: [https://support.wizards.com](https://support.wizards.com)
- Click "Submit a Request" (top right)
- Select category: **Product Integrity / Violations**
- Fill out the form with all supporting details and attachments.

### 3. **Optional: Notify Platform Moderators**
If the seller is on a platform like **Whatnot**, **eBay**, or **Twitch**, you can also report the listing to that platform for violating MTG release policies or presale restrictions.

Would you like help drafting the message to Wizards or Whatnot?

### **Email to Wizards of the Coast (WPNsupport@wizards.com or via [support.wizards.com](https://support.wizards.com))**

**Subject:** Early MTG Product Violation Report – Unauthorized Pre-Release Sales

**Body:**

Dear Wizards of the Coast Team,

I am writing to report a violation regarding the early sale and distribution of Magic: The Gathering products before their official release date. I believe this activity is in direct conflict with WPN and WotC's product release policies.

**Details of the Violation:**

- **Seller/Store Name:** [Insert name]
- **Platform Used:** [e.g., Whatnot, eBay, Twitch]
- **Product Involved:** [e.g., Outlaws of Thunder Junction Collector Boosters]
- **Date of Violation:** [Insert exact date]
- **URL/Link:** [Insert direct link to listing or stream if available]

**Evidence Attached:**  
[Insert note if you're attaching screenshots or links]

This appears to be a clear breach of the product release schedule and may undermine the integrity of official pre-release events and sanctioned sellers.

Please let me know if additional details are needed. I’m happy to provide further context.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name or Handle]

### **Message to Platform Moderators (e.g., Whatnot, eBay, Twitch)**

**Subject:** Policy Violation – Early Sale of Magic: The Gathering Product

**Body:**

Hi [Platform Name] Support,

I am reporting a seller who appears to be listing and/or selling Magic: The Gathering products ahead of their official release date, which violates Wizards of the Coast’s distribution policy and potentially your platform’s terms as well.

**Offending Seller:** [Insert seller username or store name]  
**Platform Page:** [Insert link to listing, stream, or store]  
**Product Involved:** [e.g., Outlaws of Thunder Junction]  
**Observed Date:** [Insert date]

This undermines fair access for consumers and violates industry-wide expectations for product release timelines. Please investigate and take appropriate action.

Thank you,  
[Your Name or Handle]

**Subject:** Violation Report – Unauthorized Early Sale of *Tarkir: Dragonstorm* Product

### **2. Message to Whatnot Support (help@whatnot.com or via in-app Help Center)**

**Subject:** Policy Violation – Early Sale of Magic: The Gathering Product (*Tarkir: Dragonstorm*)

**Body:**

Hello Whatnot Team,

I would like to report a seller who appears to be violating both Whatnot’s guidelines and Wizards of the Coast’s release policies by listing or opening *Tarkir: Dragonstorm* Magic: The Gathering products before the official allowed date.

- **Product Sold or Displayed:** [e.g., Tarkir: Dragonstorm Collector Booster Box]

Wizards of the Coast has publicly stated that *Tarkir: Dragonstorm* products cannot be shown, sold, or opened until **April 4, 2025** (prerelease date). This seller appears to be violating that embargo by showing or selling the product early on Whatnot.

I appreciate your attention to this matter and hope you will review and take appropriate action in line with platform and product compliance standards.

**Body:**

Hello Whatnot Support,

I am reporting a seller who is violating Wizards of the Coast’s release policy by listing and potentially opening *Tarkir: Dragonstorm* Magic: The Gathering products ahead of the authorized date.

**Seller Details:**
- **Username:** `nemaraci`

### **To: Wizards of the Coast – WPNsupport@wizards.com**  
**Subject:** Violation Report – Early Distribution of *Tarkir: Dragonstorm* by Whatnot Seller “nemaraci”

**Body:**

Dear Wizards of the Coast Compliance Team,

I am submitting a formal violation report regarding the unauthorized advertisement and possible distribution of *Magic: The Gathering – Tarkir: Dragonstorm* product prior to the official release window defined by WPN policy.

**Seller Details:**
- **Username:** `nemaraci`
- **Display Name:** Nem
- **Platform:** Whatnot
- **Show Title:** “Tarkir Dragon Storm Collectors are Here!”
- **Date of Violation:** March 26, 2025 at 11:00 AM
- **Show Link:** [https://whatnot.com/user/nemaraci](https://whatnot.com/user/nemaraci)
- **Second Channel Mentioned:** @Nemaracii

**Violation Summary:**
This seller is actively promoting, selling, and potentially opening *Tarkir: Dragonstorm* Collector Boosters prior to the WPN-sanctioned product release window which begins **April 4, 2025**, with full retail release on **April 11, 2025**. According to Wizards’ distribution and product embargo guidelines, no WPN seller or partner is authorized to sell, break, or distribute product from upcoming MTG sets prior to these dates without express written permission.

**Why This Matters:**
- This action represents a breach of the WPN Retailer Terms and Conditions and violates Wizards' product embargo policies.
- It creates a competitive imbalance by granting unfair early access.
- It may constitute **unauthorized commercial use of Wizards of the Coast intellectual property**, depending on how the cards are represented and marketed.
- It damages the integrity of global prerelease planning and coordinated marketing rollouts.

If this seller is not a WPN-affiliated retailer, it raises serious concerns about the leak or mishandling of embargoed product. If they *are* a WPN retailer, this would warrant formal sanction, suspension, or potential removal from the program.

I’ve attached screenshots for your records and am available to supply video footage or additional documentation if required.

Sincerely,  
[Your Full Name or Business Name]

**Subject:** MTG Product Embargo Violation – nemaraci Selling *Tarkir: Dragonstorm* Prematurely

**Body:**

To Whom It May Concern at Whatnot Compliance,

I am reporting a serious violation of Wizards of the Coast product release policy by a Whatnot seller actively listing and potentially distributing unreleased *Magic: The Gathering* product.

**Offending Seller Details:**
- **Username:** `nemaraci`
- **Display Name:** Nem
- **Show Title:** “Tarkir Dragon Storm Collectors are Here!”
- **Scheduled Time:** March 26, 2025 at 11:00 AM
- **Link to Seller Profile:** [https://whatnot.com/user/nemaraci](https://whatnot.com/user/nemaraci)
- **Relevant Product:** *Magic: The Gathering – Tarkir: Dragonstorm* Collector Boosters (street date April 11, 2025 / prerelease window April 4–10)

**Legal and Platform Implications:**

Wizards of the Coast strictly enforces embargoes on MTG products prior to their scheduled prerelease dates. Violation of this embargo:
- May expose Whatnot to **third-party liability** related to distribution of embargoed or leaked product.
- Creates **unfair marketplace conditions** for other sellers who are following WPN and licensing rules.
- Violates **intellectual property handling expectations** for licensors like Hasbro/WotC, potentially harming future platform relationships.
- Erodes **platform trust**, especially during major set releases where coordinated rollout is critical to brand integrity.

**Requested Action:**
- Immediate review of seller activity.
- Temporary suspension of the stream until compliance is verified.
- Internal investigation into source and supply chain of early product.
- Coordination with Wizards of the Coast’s compliance division if needed.

Please confirm receipt of this report. I am happy to provide screenshots and additional media.

Thank you for maintaining the fairness and trust of the Whatnot community.

[00:00:24] things here
[00:00:28] quickly all right we're go
[00:00:32] got
[00:00:42] to put in the
[00:00:45] giveaways in
[00:00:47] there and we'll uh open those up in
[00:00:51] there once we get this in because I
[00:00:53] always forget to put them in
[00:00:58] here because I'm slow like
[00:01:03] that it's a it's a regular it's a Monday
[00:01:06] morning thing right that's what we're
[00:01:08] going to say it's a Monday morning
[00:01:14] thing all right let's put those in
[00:01:19] there so we can do our little single
[00:01:22] things there you
[00:01:24] go good morning Dad guy good morning
[00:01:27] everybody thank you for coming in I
[00:01:29] appreciate this is what we're going to
[00:01:30] do right now we're going to run these
[00:01:32] are what we have in there for our packs
[00:01:34] all these different ones are in the
[00:01:35] brake split up there between the 44
[00:01:37] spots all right we're going to run this
[00:01:39] we're going to start it out a dollar
[00:01:41] start with the packs and the first one
[00:01:42] though that I'm going to do is I'm going
[00:01:44] to put in an extra pack uh this is not a
[00:01:46] pack this is like like our bulk stuff
[00:01:48] here all right of infinity along with it
[00:01:51] so that Infinity right there will go
[00:01:53] along with it that's our bulk stuff and
[00:01:55] I'm going to be doing that throughout
[00:01:56] the show to get rid some of our bulk
[00:01:57] that we have here so I'm going to add
[00:01:58] that now like so you can see what the
[00:02:00] bulk has so you guys can understand and
[00:02:02] see what it has it has like I've already
[00:02:04] gone through and picked out most of the
[00:02:05] things I want but it gives you some
[00:02:06] added stuff just kind of free
[00:02:09] extra because I can't have all that on a
[00:02:11] boat it it takes up space and I I don't
[00:02:15] have a ton of space on my on the boat
[00:02:17] that I currently have maybe in the
[00:02:18] future on a bigger one but right now
[00:02:20] we're going to do that we're going to
[00:02:21] start it for you guys they're all going
[00:02:23] to start at a dollar the first one here
[00:02:25] we go run there let me take a drink I
[00:02:27] think that's going to work there so it's
[00:02:28] going to be whatever pack pops up plus
[00:02:30] the infinity um draft added in there
[00:02:34] just cuz I got to get rid of The Bu so
[00:02:36] now it's any of the packs that are in
[00:02:37] there and then you can play part of the
[00:02:38] characters that's what happens where's
[00:02:41] my oh [ __ ] where did I put
[00:02:45] that
[00:02:49] huh where the hell is my
[00:02:52] tablet oh it's under my keyboard no
[00:02:54] wonder why I can't see it
[00:03:00] all right well I guess no one wanted any
[00:03:03] of those packs so we will uh we'll just
[00:03:06] run one of these right
[00:03:10] now first place foils uh I don't think I
[00:03:14] have any of those really at the moment
[00:03:17] but what I'll do here though you know
[00:03:20] what forgot to open those mom would you
[00:03:23] mind helping if you aren't
[00:03:26] busy and getting the other side
[00:03:30] cuz I forgot to untape
[00:03:34] these we have to tape them down because
[00:03:36] I have to get a latch to put over cuz we
[00:03:38] realize that we hit some waves the
[00:03:41] drawers will open certain certain
[00:03:44] drawers cuz they're just older I mean
[00:03:46] it's it's a it's a used boat so some of
[00:03:49] this stuff I guess is a little
[00:03:52] uh needs to be addressed and worked on
[00:03:55] and that's one of the things that we
[00:03:55] need to do is get a latch system an
[00:03:58] extras to put on to hold all the drawers
[00:04:00] closed cuz even my wife's top drawer
[00:04:02] slides open cuz it but it broke that
[00:04:05] side broke a little bit though no my LP
[00:04:07] is broken that's why I said
[00:04:08] though so we'll run another one while
[00:04:12] our giveaway is going here it's going to
[00:04:13] be for one of these packs or in the in
[00:04:15] in those uh there plus you're going to

[00:40:54] sorry about that the MTG man
[00:40:57] I didn't know it was lagging for a bit
[00:40:59] there I'll have to um like I said I'll

[00:41:21] play our
[00:41:22] game 20 H wow dude MTG man so that means
[00:41:27] you're going to get your choice of any
[00:41:32] thing that we have for a booster which
[00:41:34] is you can get a critical which is going
[00:41:35] to give a guaranteed hit plus doubling
[00:41:37] your strikes you can get an agility
[00:41:40] booster you wear my engineering right
[00:41:42] now the best would be and probably I'd
[00:41:44] say the agility booster because that's
[00:41:47] going to boost your ability to dodge the
[00:41:49] dogs that are
[00:41:50] attacking sweet yeah so any choice since
[00:41:53] you got a 20 agility in
[00:41:57] plus one agility all right so now to

[00:42:11] six but

[00:42:26] higher because you had it that two but

[00:44:14] okay so you're going to what are you
[00:44:16] going to do with your Raider here you
[00:44:18] have the medium siiz Raider in front of
[00:44:19] you you can turn and run as always and
[00:44:21] you can attack but they have leather
[00:44:23] armor which is minor one to any damage
[00:44:25] that happens them and they also
[00:44:27] car an assault
[00:44:33] rifle I know you attack that Raider I
[00:44:36] like it so we're going to run our next
[00:44:37] one we're going to see what happens
[00:44:38] you're going to attack the Raider you go
[00:44:41] we're going to make sure you can hit
[00:44:43] then if you do
[00:44:46] hit we're going to have to give you a
[00:44:49] uh tack roll but you only have a pistol
[00:44:53] that's your problem right now you only
[00:44:54] have a pistol we're going to zoom out
[00:44:56] you go like that you only have a pistol
[00:44:59] so
[00:45:01] roll and ah
[00:45:04] no
[00:45:11] buddy I know but that doesn't help right
[00:45:13] now cuz you
[00:45:15] missed now the Raider shoots back and
[00:45:18] they have a rifle so they get two to
[00:45:21] shoot they just got lucky enough to hit
[00:45:24] and they hit you with a big one
[00:45:27] my friend I'm
[00:45:29] sorry get a little bit of damage there
[00:45:33] that Raider shoots you you you missed
[00:45:35] you did not get the opportunity they hit
[00:45:37] you and you got unlucky my friend the
[00:45:40] MTG
[00:45:41] man
[00:45:42] because that knocks you down from your
[00:45:46] 100 Health to 89 not bad for that it's
[00:45:48] 89 Health but you lose some of your ammo
[00:45:52] cuz you get knocked
[00:45:54] over and you go from 39 on your ammo
[00:45:57] down to 25 cuz some of the bullets fall
[00:46:00] out you lose some of your ammo dude um I
[00:46:04] was not good luck and that Raider just
[00:46:06] goes and stands over you as you hit the
[00:46:08] ground knocked out on the ground there
[00:46:10] and that you know what I'm going to
[00:46:11] start doing we're I forgot to do this we
[00:46:13] need to get rid of my bulk so I'm going
[00:46:14] to start doing this and we're going to
[00:46:16] add some bulk in with each one of the
[00:46:25] orders uh uh setting this up I've set
[00:46:29] this up over time slowly because I've
[00:46:32] been building it so I have a lot of it
[00:46:33] already set so I guess it take me days
[00:46:35] yeah emo for that one we don't have that
[00:46:38] one very hard to hit so he's going to
[00:46:40] roll to have to be able to do that we're
[00:46:41] going to see what you get
[00:46:43] here Josh hell one two three four five
[00:46:49] six seven eight we're going to see what
[00:46:51] happens if you're going to be lucky
[00:46:52] enough to get away from these guys I'm
[00:46:55] going to put another dust more in our
[00:46:57] our Mount here give in to violence
[00:47:02] unable to scream monstrous emergence
[00:47:04] Living phone friendly Teddy ragged
[00:47:06] Playmate jump scare ah patch play thing
[00:47:09] drag to the roots veteran Survivor piggy
[00:47:13] bank Jolly balloon man that's a nice
[00:47:15] pick up for you bleeding Woods vile
[00:47:18] mutilator and foil and your R card of
[00:47:21] paranormal
[00:47:23] analysis here you go Josh so you have to
[00:47:26] decide he's going to be hard to hit the
[00:47:28] mechanical Ward drone but luckily he's
[00:47:32] not he's not uh uh he can evade you but
[00:47:35] luckily he's not a hard one to hit he's
[00:47:37] got only a 15 you have to hit a roll of
[00:47:40] 15 to beat it so you got to let me know
[00:47:42] are you going to be able to win against
[00:47:44] this drone you or do you want to turn
[00:47:46] around and try to hun hi
[00:47:53] Josh I know I got you over here
[00:47:55] somewhere there you go
[00:48:00] it's up to you my
[00:48:02] friend to go and play our
[00:48:07] game oh did I lose
[00:48:11] you cuz they're going to get a one and
[00:48:13] four chance when they roll yes you can
[00:48:15] use your assault weapon on three round
[00:48:17] burst I like it you've been thinking
[00:48:19] you've been paying attention all right
[00:48:21] assault weapon time three round burst
[00:48:24] but they're going to get a one in four
[00:48:26] chance to dodge so that means if they
[00:48:27] get one they'll be able to dodge it so
[00:48:30] I'm going to roll it together you get
[00:48:32] three you upgraded yours so you get
[00:48:35] three round burst this time so you're
[00:48:37] going to shoot three bullets I like it
[00:48:39] at this guy and you have to
[00:48:41] hit instead of 15 you have to hit 12
[00:48:43] because you get a plus three on your
[00:48:44] weapon so we're going to roll all these
[00:48:46] dice at once and we're going to see what
[00:48:47] happens here all those are going
[00:48:51] down oh my God buddy you got a natural
[00:48:55] 20
[00:48:58] what Josh you did it they missed anyways
[00:49:02] they didn't dodge you so that's a
[00:49:04] guaranteed hit anyways cuz critical hit
[00:49:06] and then you double your ammo your
[00:49:08] damage which is
[00:49:09] 12 15 that guy's dead you just killed it
[00:49:14] it blows up in front of you Josh nice
[00:49:16] one it blows up in front of you you got
[00:49:19] lucky you find some more assault rifer
[00:49:22] ammo you get 30 rounds more and then out
[00:49:26] of it fall

[00:49:30] it
[00:49:32] um some health packs you get a health
[00:49:36] pack and then a bunch of pogs also fall
[00:49:39] seem to fall out of it not a bunch just
[00:49:41] one cuz it looks like they
[00:49:44] collect the Slammers which means you

[01:00:49] there's a rare or so in there if I had
[01:00:50] want it and left it in there not very
[01:00:52] frequently but in the collector boost is

[01:24:42] cuz that's a pretty big looking guy you
[01:24:43] can turn and run or at least attempt to

[01:25:37] Yoda yeah all right let's do some help
[01:25:40] here we'll run one more pack here for a
[01:25:43] little bit and we'll see what
[01:25:48] happens so going to try to help going to
[01:25:52] try to help here we go see you help
[01:25:54] going to have to have a uh over 10 here
[01:25:58] got 13 all right help is allowed you got
[01:26:00] your pistol you shoot at that
[01:26:04] Raider and oh my you missed cuz it is a
[01:26:08] uh it's a 16 or greater but you
[01:26:10] missed now our friend here I'm guessing
[01:26:12] you're going to shoot with your three
[01:26:14] round burst
[01:26:17] right we're going to zoom out ooh your
[01:26:20] grenade yes the grenade is a good one
[01:26:23] that'll be um
[01:26:25] a damage area hit and that is three of
[01:26:30] these all right let's
[01:26:32] go oh you got a 10 you throw it it
[01:26:36] doesn't hit directly next it doesn't hit
[01:26:37] them directly it hits right near them
[01:26:39] because it was the 10 if you hit him
[01:26:40] directly you would have had the 17 or
[01:26:42] higher I mean 16 or higher well this
[01:26:44] gives you a four plus four so you would
[01:26:46] have need well it doesn't matter you
[01:26:48] don't hit it with 10 but being an area
[01:26:50] radius of damage instead of having the
[01:26:53] full that big
[01:26:58] was to 30 Health but they're on fire or
[01:27:02] they're
[01:27:05] burnt all right we'll run we can let's
[01:27:08] see all right
[01:27:11] Yoda and you got a dmu
[01:27:14] draft all right we're going to put your
[01:27:16] dmu draft that you got right here all
[01:27:20] right and with that DMD jaff you got oh
[01:27:24] you have not the best one here you got
[01:27:26] some bad luck you have a gator
[01:27:28] Dow has come towards you cuz that large
[01:27:32] Raider you knocked them down it didn't
[01:27:35] kill him since you you did a it was a
[01:27:36] small hit but at least they ran away and
[01:27:38] no one was injured all right no one was
[01:27:41] injured while it ran away so you're
[01:27:42] still going to have your friend there
[01:27:43] you going to call on your friend for
[01:27:45] some help with this Gator Dow cuz you
[01:27:47] keep getting the big uh big bad guys to
[01:27:49] have a hard problem with
[01:27:56] all right good luck my friend on the
[01:27:58] pack here one two three four five 6
[01:28:03] 78 good yeah that's probably a good idea
[01:28:06] to run from this impede momentum
[01:28:08] territorial marrow joint explo Island
[01:28:11] and a bird token nice pick up on the
[01:28:13] rare there all right so you run away now

[01:28:18] successfully actually you know what do I
[01:28:20] have my coin so I can flip yet if you
[01:28:23] had some luck we would add a little bit
[01:28:24] extra on to your roll so you'd have
[01:28:26] you'd have be able to get a ner higher
[01:28:28] but because you don't have luck at the
[01:28:30] moment you have to do it's a 50/50 I
[01:28:32] think I got my coin here it is here
[01:28:36] aha so here we go going to spin this we
[01:28:39] going to see what you get tails that is
[01:28:41] not on your side my

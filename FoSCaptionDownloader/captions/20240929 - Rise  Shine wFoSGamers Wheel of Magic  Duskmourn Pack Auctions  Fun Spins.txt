[00:36:41] e oh you uh you have any idea what it
[00:36:49] is uh shipping it well it's per item but
[00:36:52] it ends up being flat after a certain
[00:36:53] amount like you build up to a certain
[00:36:55] amount and it ends up being a flat rate
[00:36:57] uh
[00:36:58] the highest you can pay is $8 and the
[00:37:00] regular shipping after you get a certain
[00:37:02] amount of packs I think it's like four
[00:37:04] packs three or four packs it ends up
[00:37:06] being over it ends up going over the
[00:37:08] four or five shipping to the next one so
[00:37:10] it adds up multiple until you get more

[00:57:13] phone that makes sense pick a modern
[00:57:16] Horizon 3 we can do modern Horizon 3
[00:57:19] Michael wants modern Horizon 3 sound
[00:57:21] good weeb
[00:57:26] yeah all right modern Horizon 3 put that
[00:57:29] right there all right then we're going
[00:57:33] to do this we're going to throw it out
[00:57:35] here and this one normally we'll throw
[00:57:36] it a little discount for you all say
[00:57:38] thank you and hanging out with
[00:57:40] us here you go some Modern Horizon 3 for
[00:57:42] you all right I'll look at that and I'll
[00:57:45] I'll take a look risky um there's been
[00:57:47] weird things I'm going to just let
[00:57:48] everybody know uh we found out like the
[00:57:51] my mail post office has been down with
[00:57:52] their um computer systems for almost a
[00:57:56] week now so that could be what's going
[00:57:59] on um because I dropped all the stuff
[00:58:01] off and there's been we've been missing
[00:58:02] some stuff too just because like suspen
[00:58:04] coming in they can't drop everything off
[00:58:06] right so yeah so I I'll have to um I'll
[00:58:10] have to double check on maybe there's
[00:58:12] just stuff literally just sitting there
[00:58:14] that they haven't got to I'll have to
[00:58:15] call them and figure it out so
[00:58:17] barosaurus Rex you my friend have this
[00:58:20] pack we're going to open this up all
[00:58:21] right and we're going to see what you
[00:58:23] get and then
[00:58:28] oh if you win so what we do if you win
[00:58:31] what we do is we put a $1 pack out as an
[00:58:33] auction we start a $1 pack and I start a
[00:58:35] giveaway um is is what we do when we
[00:58:38] have a win so a giveaway is generally
[00:58:39] going to be of a single of some kind um
[00:58:42] and the $1 pack will be of some kind of
[00:58:44] whatever we'll do an auction of that and
[00:58:45] then after that we do uh we'll do like
[00:58:48] three rounds of this a few rounds and
[00:58:49] then we'll do something we'll call a
[00:58:50] lightning round where I'm going to go
[00:58:51] quickly with singles to try to get
[00:58:53] people to get some numbers there letters
[00:58:55] there I mean
[00:58:57] looks cool
[00:58:59] good so brontosaurus want to like us to
[00:59:02] open
[00:59:03] this because sadly I'm not allowed to
[00:59:06] give stuff to people based off like
[00:59:08] giveaway things with whatnot rules I'll
[00:59:10] get in trouble so the only I can do is
[00:59:11] do the $1 auction and start a
[00:59:15] giveaway that's why I was saying
[00:59:17] Brontosaurus Rex I can't sadly I'm not
[00:59:18] able to do anything just because of
[00:59:20] whatnot rules so what I can do is I can
[00:59:22] start a I can start a giveaway and do a
[00:59:24] $1 auction
[00:59:26] um that's the only thing I'm able to do
[00:59:28] so far if I was a if whatnots rules were
[00:59:31] not different were a little bit
[00:59:32] different what I would have been doing
[00:59:34] is I'd give like a single away to
[00:59:35] somebody and stuff like that so I'll put
[00:59:37] it into a giveaway a pack into a
[00:59:39] giveaway and it's like not a pack into a
[00:59:41] giveaway like a single into a giveaway
[00:59:42] and then I'll do um a pack like I said
[00:59:44] on there low all right here we go
[00:59:47] brontosaurus now we're going to go like
[00:59:49] this and you got yourself let's see a

[01:40:08] put that one right there the bloomo
[01:40:09] still has three Tree City in it and
[01:40:11] keeper Talent basa Squan used to be a
[01:40:13] little bit higher when I first built
[01:40:15] this and currently what we have in there
[01:40:21] is currently what we have in there is
[01:40:27] this um out of the 12 there are eight
[01:40:30] collector boosters left of Bloom BR
[01:40:32] there are four play boosters of modern
[01:40:35] Horizon 3 and there are two play
[01:40:37] boosters of Bloom BR left in here so
[01:40:40] this one here we're going to do our
[01:40:42] Wicked Wednesday one we're going to run
[01:40:44] that and see if anybody wants to dry one
[01:40:46] of these for the Wednesday Bloom burrow
[01:40:49] and there's Commander Legend stuff in
[01:40:50] there I mean Commander Masters cards in
[01:40:51] there that could maybe maybe get
[01:40:53] something good maybe not we'll see it's
[01:40:55] up to you guys sometimes we do sometimes
[01:40:57] we
[01:41:01] don't okay that is correct there and
[01:41:03] remember if you spend Bob the con I like
[01:41:06] it all right Bob the con where would you
[01:41:09] like to go my friend Bob the
[01:41:19] con take a drink while we wait
[01:41:31] yep correct so the way we do it is I
[01:41:34] pick one at a time um that's three
[01:41:37] actually three with this I pick one at a
[01:41:39] time and if you get a pack on it we stop
[01:41:41] or if you get your money back for a card
[01:41:42] we stop that's uh it's a little bit
[01:41:44] different on the on this
[01:41:46] one so it's it's it's three of them and
[01:41:49] then I go one two three whatever way you
[01:41:51] want sometimes people do me three in a
[01:41:52] row some people have me pick three
[01:41:54] random ones but it's um three but one
[01:41:58] kind of one at a time to see what
[01:42:00] happens if that makes any
[01:42:01] sense 7 13 and 21 all right and then 40
[01:42:07] one two three 4 five six seven all right
[01:42:10] so that's our first one is seven right
[01:42:13] there all right so we're going to put
[01:42:14] these right here so we know where our
[01:42:15] cards are
[01:42:16] seven was a tragic slip all right not a
[01:42:19] big hit on there
[01:42:22] seven all right then we're going to pick
[01:42:24] the rest of our cards
[01:42:26] up 8 9 10 11 12 13 how's it going Frank
[01:42:32] my

[01:42:39] rare pickup that does not get you your
[01:42:41] money back though that does not get your
[01:42:43] money back so we're going to go with
[01:42:46] next ones here hold on don't don't make
[01:42:50] sure that card comes up from the
[01:42:51] bottom uh

[02:02:16] into um I've been getting into modern a
[02:02:19] little bit more just because I've been
[02:02:21] playing with some more people people on

[03:07:17] the stream what we're going to end up
[03:07:19] doing here is you're going to end up
[03:07:22] having you'll be one of the few people
[03:07:25] that will get to
[03:07:26] uh go on and be
[03:07:30] um in like kind of like the winners
[03:07:32] round I guess you could call it this is
[03:07:34] going to be our giveaway because the
[03:07:37] thing was won all right because we
[03:07:40] won there you are that's our wheel
[03:07:43] enduring innocence is being given away
[03:07:45] to say thank you for winning that
[03:07:47] getting the number the word
[03:07:50] correctly no the only thing we can do is
[03:07:53] that point system
[03:07:59] so oh yeah I didn't think about that I'd
[03:08:01] have to add them in earlier then I'd
[03:08:03] have to add it in earlier that's not a
[03:08:04] bad idea you know I might do that on one
[03:08:07] of them at the end I do generally buyers
[03:08:08] giveaways at the end but I only have two
[03:08:10] of them in here today so maybe next time
[03:08:13] I'll have to add in a bunch more buyers
[03:08:14] giveaways so when we do this I can do it
[03:08:16] that way that makes sense
[03:08:26] well I I have to do it based on the
[03:08:27] rules that whatnot has you know that's
[03:08:29] kind of the sad thing there I can't I
[03:08:31] can't do it any different because if I
[03:08:33] do I I get suspended and I don't want to
[03:08:35] be suspended you
[03:08:41] know or just add it for each
[03:08:44] round yeah the buyer giveaway is not a
[03:08:46] bad idea I think I could probably start
[03:08:48] doing
[03:08:49] that uh and
[03:08:52] then what do you mean add it I don't
[03:08:54] know about adding it for each
[03:08:57] round you want to explain that
[03:09:05] one
[03:09:07] okay oh I didn't know that no one told
[03:09:11] me that before I was told I was
[03:09:15] oh no okay
[03:09:18] I think I'm going to do that next time
[03:09:20] then I will do that next time then thank
[03:09:22] you see I was I was told I needed to
[03:09:25] started at the beginning of it thank you
[03:09:26] for uh basically you create a buyer
[03:09:29] giveaway pop it start it and anyone who
[03:09:33] buys in the five minutes has entered
[03:09:34] into that but
[03:09:39] beware yeah anybody can the the people
[03:09:42] that type in they there are foreign
[03:09:44] pillars yes I do know there they can be
[03:09:45] forign Bros
[03:09:49] correct correct correct I do know that
[03:09:52] so I think then maybe what I'll end up
[03:09:53] doing here is
[03:09:56] um that's not a bad idea I will
[03:10:05] do that's not a bad idea I can do it at
[03:10:07] the beginning of each round a buyer
[03:10:09] giveaway and then it runs a if the if
[03:10:13] the um word is solved it'll run for like
[03:10:17] 10 10 seconds or something like
[03:10:29] that yeah I did that already kill Tren
[03:10:32] with one
[03:10:35] person I don't know if I can
[03:10:36] retroactively put you in for three solid
[03:10:38] ones but um I will run something that
[03:10:42] will I have one of them that will allow
[03:10:44] me to do
[03:10:45] it actually in the end I have one of
[03:10:48] them here so I can do it and anybody
[03:10:49] that was in the buyers anybody that's
[03:10:51] been a buyer since the beginning of it
[03:10:53] will be able to get in so I'll do it
[03:10:54] I'll do it for one of them um coming up
[03:10:56] after here all right that's what I think
[03:10:58] I'll
[03:11:00] do and then what I'll do is I'll have
[03:11:02] all the buyers be able to get in on
[03:11:09] it from that time frame that's not a bad
[03:11:13] idea not a bad idea I didn't think about
[03:11:15] that see I was trying to figure fure out
[03:11:17] how to do it where I'm not have to worry
[03:11:19] about anything you
[03:11:21] know yeah not a
[03:11:28] problem thank you I appreciate the some
[03:11:31] I don't mind getting some ideas on some
[03:11:33] help there so I've been trying to figure
[03:11:34] out the best way of doing it and where
[03:11:36] I'm not like going to get in trouble you
[03:11:38] know that's why I always doing it the
[03:11:40] way I am and I've been doing most of
[03:11:42] things this way just for that for that
[03:11:44] reason I just don't want to worry about
[03:11:45] you know getting suspended type thing
[03:11:46] you know
[03:11:51] so not a bad idea so certain channels I
[03:11:53] watch do that you get one for them
[03:11:55] you'll get your prize and then you're
[03:11:57] banned forever
[03:12:13] yeah well I have um there are over a 100
[03:12:18] auctions in uh there are over 100 um
[03:12:21] giveaways in the buy now by the way
[03:12:23] Barefoot and I I randomly put ones
[03:12:25] throughout the thing that say buyers
[03:12:27] giveaways in them that allow me to go
[03:12:29] into them and pick them randomly so that
[03:12:30] people can't easily jump on them kind of
[03:12:32] like what you're talking about
[03:12:38] there okay yeah so if you see there's a
[03:12:41] hundred of them in here and there's a
[03:12:42] few of them randomly with buyers that
[03:12:44] they're labeled so all right here this
[03:12:45] is what we'll do Ram Ram well you know
[03:12:48] what one of the uh one of our buyers got
[03:12:50] it anyways here well look at that ram
[03:12:57] ram one of our buyers got it anyway I'm
[03:13:01] going to run another one and I'm going
[03:13:03] to run this one for a buyer one here but
[03:13:05] as I'm running this one as a buyer one
[03:13:07] we're going to put out our next pack for
[03:13:10] the

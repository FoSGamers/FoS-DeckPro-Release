[00:16:12] see if anybody else wants to participate
[00:16:14] in our our game our advanture for some
[00:16:16] singles and you get your um singles that
[00:16:19] are in there well you at it then the
[00:16:21] next round moves on once you uh either
[00:16:23] beat the boss or seven events
[00:16:26] occur all right good luck one
[00:16:29] to wait I think these are in the right
[00:16:31] order I don't need to do that they are
[00:16:34] there we go fire hat cosmi and blast
[00:16:37] deep Goblin skull taker fungal fortitude
[00:16:41] Earth Shaker dread maw contested game
[00:16:44] ball
[00:16:46] self-reflection swamp all right let's
[00:16:48] get it this is where we get my uh stamp
[00:16:50] right isin the firstborn of GTH Terror
[00:16:53] tide poetic
[00:16:55] Ingenuity sunfill Intimidator imitator
[00:16:59] not bad on that AO ancestral uh Echo for
[00:17:03] your showcase o an Ian Malcolm
[00:17:06] chaotician for an foil there not bad
[00:17:09] Malcolm alling scoundrel foil and my
[00:17:12] treasure token well not bad for that
[00:17:16] pack morea all right so it's kind of
[00:17:18] like the other ones that we've done
[00:17:19] before where pretty much the encounters
[00:17:22] or the events are randomized you're
[00:17:23] going to get a
[00:17:25] single and guaranteed whatever single in
[00:17:27] the in the 10 spot here now once seven
[00:17:31] of these 10 events go we go on to the
[00:17:33] next one or if you beat the boss which
[00:17:35] happens to be the gator Dow you move on
[00:17:38] now the game is kind of like a d and d
[00:17:39] game that's all it is you're I'm like
[00:17:41] the the dungeon master for it and we uh
[00:17:44] roll through playing a little game here
[00:17:46] so that's where you as a wasteland
[00:17:52] Adventurer
[00:17:54] are you're in front of one of those so
[00:17:56] say but maybe that's not what you want
[00:17:58] in front of maybe you uh pull out
[00:17:59] another maybe one when the auto box runs
[00:18:03] instead of the boss it pulls out
[00:18:07] the where is it you run into a where did
[00:18:12] I put it I to get these all alphabetical
[00:18:16] order the Rogue AI scanner maybe you R
[00:18:19] into that instead and you have to fight
[00:18:21] that off as one of your first things
[00:18:23] before you uh encounter the
[00:18:27] boss get rid of those out of the way so
[00:18:30] what we do is we run our event our our
[00:18:32] game our start here for the break at $1
[00:18:36] you jump in you play you get one of the
[00:18:38] singles associated with it randomizes
[00:18:40] the single and the event so it kind of
[00:18:43] makes it a randomized uh
[00:18:45] encounter or whatever You' like to call
[00:18:47] it for uh the campaign that you get to
[00:18:49] participate in I guess that's what you
[00:18:51] can call
[00:18:53] it so that's all it is very easy it's uh
[00:18:57] it's a way that like to like when people
[00:18:58] get singles
[00:18:59] and stuff like that or do the games and
[00:19:00] things and those things they don't
[00:19:02] actually just get nothing from it you
[00:19:03] can get something from it that's what it
[00:19:06] is you can play a little game with it
[00:19:08] too that's
[00:19:09] why and that's what we are doing now if
[00:19:11] you'd like so I'll run it again there
[00:19:14] that's what it is starts at a dollar
[00:19:15] that one and it randomize the auto box
[00:19:17] in the event that you uh
[00:19:21] encounter so you try it
[00:19:25] out Darth bone why not
[00:19:31] yeah superhuman did yep and somebody
[00:19:34] just got uh bleach bone
[00:19:39] Burge for uh a dollar look at that one
[00:19:42] they got
[00:19:43] earlier that was
[00:19:46] Josh the
[00:19:48] Darth I appreciate it try it out let's
[00:19:50] see what
[00:19:52] happens all right well the Darth decided
[00:19:55] to become someone wandering in to the
[00:19:59] Coliseum there and you well look at that
[00:20:01] I poked it out earlier you got the high
[00:20:03] society Hunter which means you also have
[00:20:06] the encounter of the Rogue AI now I'll
[00:20:09] get your high society Hunter out for you
[00:20:12] that was pretty
[00:20:13] uh on
[00:20:15] point you have to decide as a uh person
[00:20:19] there what do you want to
[00:20:25] do there's your high society Hunter
[00:20:31] s s to say but whatnot for some reason
[00:20:34] does not like what's going on ever when
[00:20:35] it comes to whatnot it's one of those
[00:20:37] weird situations like
[00:20:39] use for some reason it's just whatnot
[00:20:42] that's where doesn't like me all right
[00:20:44] Darth what it was saying what I was
[00:20:46] saying was you wandered into the
[00:20:49] Coliseum you have a
[00:20:51] pistol and you have a knife both are
[00:20:54] plus two one's range one's melee that's
[00:20:56] how you start with but you're up against
[00:20:58] this Rogue I scanner which is a 14 to
[00:21:00] roll or you can attempt to run
[00:21:03] away it's up to you what you'd like to
[00:21:06] do with your character
[00:21:08] here you want to roll and encounter
[00:21:11] it or do you want to run away and then
[00:21:14] we'll run
[00:21:18] another yeah I don't know why it's
[00:21:20] freezing on whatnot when it doesn't
[00:21:21] freeze anywhere else I mean you can go
[00:21:22] and chat on the other on any of the
[00:21:24] other ones if you're used to it like
[00:21:25] twitch or or Facebook or I mean fa uh
[00:21:28] YouTube or something that works
[00:21:30] too roll en counter you ain't running
[00:21:32] from that you ain't no [Â __Â ] I like that
[00:21:36] all right so you have a you're going to
[00:21:37] use the pistol I'm guessing all right so
[00:21:40] you go with that they're going to go
[00:21:41] after you they're scanning you they
[00:21:43] don't like what they see and they start
[00:21:44] to
[00:21:46] weaponize they mistake you for an
[00:21:49] enemy you o well look at that you get a
[00:21:52] 14 you see that one there you got it 14
[00:21:56] but you only hit for one but luckily
[00:21:59] it's enough to disable
[00:22:02] it where that Rog scanner instead of
[00:22:05] shooting starts to flutter a bit and try
[00:22:07] to run away we'll give you one more
[00:22:09] chance
[00:22:14] though no um not a band uh no I'm
[00:22:18] running through uh starlink maybe let's
[00:22:21] see if you get one more chance here ah
[00:22:23] you missed it when it ran away though
[00:22:25] did not catch it when it ran away so you
[00:22:27] were not able to to get anything from
[00:22:29] this encounter you're not lucky enough
[00:22:31] to uh Wander out with with something
[00:22:33] extra because it ran away you only had a
[00:22:35] little bit of damage to it but close
[00:22:40] enough yeah I know sun is my enemy
[00:22:44] coming up right now yeah that's probably
[00:22:46] what it
[00:22:47] Ah that's actually probably what it is
[00:22:49] right now I keep forgetting about that
[00:22:50] the sun coming up could cause some of
[00:22:52] that right now
[00:22:57] yep well we have a storm that's supposed
[00:22:59] to be coming through at some point so I
[00:23:01] don't know we'll see what next single
[00:23:02] comes out now it could be any of the
[00:23:04] ones there we have arabo Crystal
[00:23:06] barricade Monarch the Canon eyes meat
[00:23:08] hook is in there there's Mary go around
[00:23:11] there's fire Palani Hatcher topography
[00:23:14] tracker T Dre Contour there's some good
[00:23:18] things in
[00:23:19] here ah I didn't know
[00:23:22] that I wasn't so much aware of that I'll
[00:23:24] have to check that uh that's a new thing
[00:23:26] for me uh we haven't had any issues that
[00:23:27] many when we were places when we were in
[00:23:29] the Caribbean but I wonder if it's
[00:23:30] because the sun was already mostly up oh
[00:23:34] there you go mergo round for Blanco let
[00:23:37] me get that out for you and you have run
[00:23:40] into
[00:23:41] Blanco the black market
[00:23:44] Trader all right this black market
[00:23:46] Trader
[00:23:48] here you have to
[00:23:50] roll to see what type of gear you'll get
[00:23:54] if it's medium crappy or better yes Sol
[00:23:57] ah ah yes I forgot about that I didn't
[00:23:58] think about that
[00:23:59] one Merry Go
[00:24:02] Round well I know the solar flare like
[00:24:04] like like solar uh wind is bad but I
[00:24:06] didn't know uh it came that much in the
[00:24:08] morning I was completely think like not
[00:24:09] even remembering
[00:24:10] that it was one of those oh crap because
[00:24:13] I didn't run into it yet I've been
[00:24:15] trying to think about it where's Mary go
[00:24:22] around oh there it is there we go Mar go
[00:24:27] around for you my friend
[00:24:31] so
[00:24:33] Blanco you've uh you're you're new here
[00:24:36] when it comes to the adventure I think
[00:24:38] let me see if I have your
[00:24:43] name I don't think I
[00:24:46] do no so you have a pistol and a knife
[00:24:50] to start your uh start with here so you
[00:24:53] have to
[00:24:54] decide Blanco do you want to try to
[00:24:57] trade your knife for your pistol for
[00:24:59] anything and see what happens or you
[00:25:00] just want to kind of stick it with what
[00:25:01] you got or should we roll to see if you
[00:25:04] uh he has anything worth trading
[00:25:10] for Blanco
[00:25:23] 87 yeah minimal spots right now I
[00:25:25] know let's try all right so so I'm going
[00:25:29] to try the trade thing so here we go
[00:25:31] let's see what they
[00:25:33] got high roll is good stuff medium roll
[00:25:36] okay low roll is just kind of junk but
[00:25:40] oh no it jumped all the way off the
[00:25:43] desk 13 well that's a middle
[00:25:48] so that uh that person
[00:25:54] has
[00:25:55] um some pistol ammo
[00:26:01] a rusty assault
[00:26:06] rifle that's just weird because I have
[00:26:08] it bandwidth I wonder if it's because I
[00:26:10] restrict
[00:26:13] bandwidth so hey they have a rusty
[00:26:15] assault rifle would you like to do
[00:26:17] anything for that

[00:39:19] something you can't really understand
[00:39:20] what it is but there's something in the
[00:39:21] distance and there's some smoke coming

[00:42:16] one
[00:42:17] Blanco and you have to decide what
[00:42:19] you're going to
[00:42:21] do do you want to attack or do you want
[00:42:24] to run away they use only a blunt weapon
[00:42:26] that like that us that stick you got
[00:42:36] there Blanco put you together with that
[00:42:38] one and look at that you got a bunch of
[00:42:39] good singles right there going to try to
[00:42:41] disarm I like it
[00:42:44] you try to disarm now saying that
[00:42:48] they're easy to disarm instead of a
[00:42:51] 50/50 you have to get a 14 or higher to
[00:42:56] do that so we're going to have to run
[00:42:57] roll this and
[00:42:58] see well look at that you got a 15 look
[00:43:02] at that
[00:43:04] one look at that
[00:43:06] 15 good one my
[00:43:09] friend you
[00:43:11] disarm that desert abandoned they stand
[00:43:14] there in front of you uh please sir
[00:43:16] don't don't go don't kill me I was only
[00:43:19] trying to get some food and water so you
[00:43:21] look at them you decide you know what
[00:43:23] you'll help them you give them a little
[00:43:24] bit of water you don't have much of it
[00:43:25] yourself but you give them a little
[00:43:26] water and in
[00:43:29] return he uh tells you where there was a
[00:43:32] cave that he didn't want to go into
[00:43:33] because he was too scared well you my
[00:43:35] friend you wander into that
[00:43:37] cave and look at that there's nothing
[00:43:40] really to worry about cuz there's just a
[00:43:42] few uh few of those cockroaches that you
[00:43:43] saw
[00:43:44] earlier but in there on the ground you
[00:43:48] found five
[00:43:50] pogs look at that my friend
[00:43:54] Blanco that's our Wasteland currency
[00:43:58] is the PX so you got five of those
[00:44:01] blockco so if you ever run into a
[00:44:03] Trader you have some pogs to use to buy
[00:44:07] things with look at that good job hey Mr
[00:44:10] Fong how's it going
[00:44:12] buddy
[00:44:14] Miss yeah I know the ' 90s the '90s
[00:44:16] pogs I found some a while ago and we're
[00:44:19] using them playing them playing with
[00:44:20] them so we uh we'll run another one see
[00:44:22] if anybody else wants to participate in
[00:44:24] our
[00:44:24] adventure it's a slow day on Monday I'll
[00:44:28] probably jump off here in a little bit
[00:44:30] how does this work rustic cabin so um
[00:44:33] the auto box here has 10 different
[00:44:35] singles listed in it with all of them
[00:44:37] have the single the set it's from for
[00:44:40] Magic Gathering the price of the card
[00:44:42] based on TCG player from like last night
[00:44:44] or this morning whenever I pulled the
[00:44:45] price of them um and then the you have
[00:44:48] an encounter you run into that's
[00:44:50] attached to also which is in the
[00:44:51] description of it you this one last one
[00:44:52] ran in desert Bandit you just happen to
[00:44:55] be when you start you have a person
[00:44:57] wanding in to our uh you know Wasteland
[00:44:59] Coliseum you have a
[00:45:00] pistol and a knife and you start your D
[00:45:03] and D Adventure I'm your little I'm your
[00:45:04] dungeon master here hanging out and
[00:45:05] having fun and whatever you happen to
[00:45:07] get for the card tells you what will go
[00:45:10] on for your event your encounter
[00:45:12] depending on what happens you either
[00:45:14] roll to attack maybe if you have to do
[00:45:17] something luck you spend this until you
[00:45:18] get some luck boosters of some kind but
[00:45:21] uh for right now that's how it goes like
[00:45:23] I'm a dungeon master we're playing a
[00:45:24] little dungeon dragon game so you jump
[00:45:26] in if you want to and you get a single
[00:45:28] guaranteed from the auto box but it a by
[00:45:31] the randomization it gives us the
[00:45:32] randomization of what encounter it is
[00:45:34] maybe you'll get unlucky though and
[00:45:35] you'll run into the uh the bosses right
[00:45:38] away I don't
[00:45:45] know but that's what it is nothing
[00:45:47] special just a little fun and we get to
[00:45:51] play some uh adventuring games here
[00:45:57] that's
[00:45:58] it in this one let's see we have a uh in
[00:46:03] here we have ratos patron of chaos a
[00:46:06] nice foil one of those Queens Bay
[00:46:09] Paladin we have homunculus hold hired
[00:46:13] claw we also have ever-flowing chalice
[00:46:16] heartless summoning was already taken
[00:46:19] there wishclaw not bad we'll run that
[00:46:23] again here see if anybody wants to
[00:46:24] participate in our next round
[00:46:29] so yeah not not a not a major thing just
[00:46:31] a really small kind of little thing we
[00:46:34] do to have some
[00:46:36] fun we'll see if you guys want to keep
[00:46:40] going cuz I know yesterday we ran into
[00:46:42] the toxic sludge monster and they ended
[00:46:44] up running away from that at the end of
[00:46:45] the at the end of the uh game and they
[00:46:47] did not want to fight cuz that was not a
[00:46:49] good one that was a big rough one that
[00:46:51] would have been
[00:46:55] hard SA same as the gator Dow the gator
[00:46:58] Dow is always a rough one too everybody
[00:47:00] doesn't like the gator Dow and it's a
[00:47:02] big tough uh alligator Gator dowo mix
[00:47:06] being from Florida that was we we run
[00:47:08] into armadillos all the time in
[00:47:09] alligator so I I decided we need to
[00:47:11] mutate them together in our
[00:47:15] Wasteland we'll run some more of
[00:47:18] these set and we have our auto box
[00:47:21] running for some singles
[00:47:27] so we have the ceilings oh right now we
[00:47:30] have ratos patron of Chaos whicher in
[00:47:33] car Manor
[00:47:34] foil then the next one round
[00:47:37] four we have um K the great Creator is
[00:47:43] in round four that would be the next
[00:47:44] round so it's either we get through
[00:47:45] seven seven events with uh or you run
[00:47:48] run into the boss those how you go to
[00:47:49] the next round then and then round five
[00:47:53] we only have five of them I did today
[00:47:54] because I didn't do a ton I didn't know
[00:47:55] how this was going to roll how if if you
[00:47:57] people were gonna if everyone was gonna
[00:47:58] like it or not I didn't want to put too
[00:48:00] too much effort into it if it was
[00:48:01] something that was just gonna like flop
[00:48:03] then Warren Soul Trader is for our fifth
[00:48:06] Encounter of the day so kind of we
[00:48:08] increasingly get um different bigger
[00:48:12] encounters but that that's what we got
[00:48:14] there for all of you but today right
[00:48:17] now we have Arrow flowing chalice
[00:48:19] gallery of Legend hired claw humulus
[00:48:22] horde opening ceremony Queens Bay
[00:48:24] Paladin ratto patron of Chaos
[00:48:26] Restoration Angel and wishclaw talsman
[00:48:29] are all what's available right now in
[00:48:30] this one so we'll run that try that out
[00:48:33] there do it for a couple minutes and
[00:48:35] then I think what we'll do after is uh
[00:48:38] this doesn't go I think we might end up
[00:48:41] going and doing some other things this
[00:48:42] morning because it is a Monday Mondays
[00:48:44] are slower always you know it's just
[00:48:45] Mondays right and I'm waiting for some
[00:48:47] uh my packs and stuff to come in because
[00:48:50] uh I had to order some more stuff so we
[00:48:53] had more um more inventory now waiting
[00:48:56] on some of that to come in and we'll uh
[00:48:58] I know we have some collector boosters
[00:49:00] and things that no one's been jumping in
[00:49:01] on that too much
[00:49:03] recently for some reason oh Blanco's
[00:49:05] going to try it again all right
[00:49:09] Blanco well you got the wishclaw
[00:49:12] talsman and while I find that you have
[00:49:16] the rorn Drone it Sparks and shuts down
[00:49:20] as it's starting to come towards you to
[00:49:22] attack now you want to you decide what
[00:49:25] you want to do here with this
[00:49:28] one M won uh I just I was doing it so I
[00:49:33] we were playing games for a a channel
[00:49:36] called whatnot and we're trying to
[00:49:37] figure out how to do a game where it
[00:49:38] wouldn't be gambling but it would still
[00:49:40] be kind of like fun to play and my kids
[00:49:43] were made a comment about the different
[00:49:44] things I had done before that's oh
[00:49:46] that's our hit for uh the big one here
[00:49:48] out of this anyways and I was like you
[00:49:51] know what let's um try it out and we
[00:49:54] tried out for one of them and it was and
[00:49:56] people likeed so we um we continue to do
[00:50:00] it and we evolve the game over time to
[00:50:03] do this and that's it's just makes it a
[00:50:04] little bit more fun when you're doing
[00:50:06] the singles for the auto boxes rather
[00:50:08] than just having uh the box there you
[00:50:11] actually get the opportunity to
[00:50:12] potentially do uh something else like
[00:50:15] have some fun and maybe uh play play a
[00:50:17] game that you get to continue on through
[00:50:19] the Wasteland now right I don't know you
[00:50:22] don't really have engineering skills
[00:50:24] wishclaw Talisman is what you got Blanco
[00:50:27] I already have you a bag here for you so
[00:50:29] let me get you in your
[00:50:30] bag you can try to fix it but you're so
[00:50:33] uh you have no engineering though it's
[00:50:35] going to be a hard one to um do anything
[00:50:37] to fix so you're going to have to get a
[00:50:39] 17 or higher to roll to fix it you want
[00:50:42] to try to Blanco oh no I knocked off the
[00:50:44] arm my son
[00:50:51] made do you want to roll to try and fix
[00:50:53] it see if you can get a 17 or higher or
[00:50:55] do you want to try to uh look into do it
[00:50:56] for scrap and just take some stuff and
[00:50:58] make sure it doesn't blow up on you CU
[00:51:00] you can try to take some scrap stuff to
[00:51:01] upgrade things later and if that would
[00:51:04] just be the 50/50 uh so heads or tails
[00:51:07] let me know heads or
[00:51:12] tails heads all right let's do it how's
[00:51:14] it going Neils how's it going Mary thank
[00:51:17] you for coming in I appreciate it the
[00:51:18] warm
[00:51:19] Monger War manager o well look at that
[00:51:23] you got heads so it looks like you go
[00:51:25] over check that grown out you find some
[00:51:28] pieces on it and you're able to take
[00:51:29] some stuff off that are that might be
[00:51:30] able to help you later so we're going to
[00:51:32] put that into Blanco's
[00:51:34] inventory you have
[00:51:37] uh drone
[00:51:40] scraps got some scrap metal some
[00:51:42] electronics and it looks like maybe some
[00:51:44] parts to a weapon there that they had
[00:51:46] but it doesn't seem like to be working
[00:51:47] right now not bad we'll run it again
[00:51:51] here if you want to try for the single
[00:51:53] that was a good pickup there he's
[00:51:55] getting some good stuff here everybody

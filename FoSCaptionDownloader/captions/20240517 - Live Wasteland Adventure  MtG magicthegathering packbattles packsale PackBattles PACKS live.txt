[00:16:56] and sister's um old like Electric
[00:16:59] Lawnmower well it's not old it's new one
[00:17:01] they just don't use it anymore because
[00:17:02] where they are they have it cut by
[00:17:04] someone so we borrow that and now he
[00:17:07] cuts the
[00:17:09] lawn saves US money and he gets paid
[00:17:12] every month like he
[00:17:14] wants give a little
[00:17:20] responsibility I used to have that my
[00:17:21] father was a fisherman so he used to
[00:17:24] come back and have me pick Nets or I
[00:17:26] would pick nets for him which cleaning
[00:17:28] the nets for him like they were 2 m long
[00:17:30] net some of them so that he could uh
[00:17:32] he'd end up like resting or whatnot but
[00:17:34] I would end up getting doing that pick
[00:17:35] the net and sometimes fix some of the
[00:17:37] holes once I got older he even taught me
[00:17:39] how to fix them so I'd fix some of the
[00:17:40] nets for them um and I would be paid I
[00:17:43] did that until was I know 13 14 I think
[00:17:46] at that point I was able to get a a
[00:17:48] full-time like I was able to get a
[00:17:49] full-time job in the summer and like a
[00:17:51] another job that's when I stopped kind
[00:17:53] of doing that regularly I should have
[00:17:55] kept doing that though and helped them
[00:18:00] what can you do now you thoughts what
[00:18:02] what happens when uh the things you
[00:18:04] could have would have should have done
[00:18:05] when somebody was around and they're not

[00:18:15] way I'd like to show you guys what we
[00:18:16] got up there nice and easy for you to
[00:18:18] see what's left in the mystery packs the
[00:18:21] cool thing with the mystery packs is get
[00:18:23] everything you can see available there
[00:18:25] and then you can get something extra
[00:18:27] maybe O It's supposed to be this way
[00:18:30] maybe you get a just a card of some kind
[00:18:32] maybe it's a card you might want to play
[00:18:33] with maybe it's a an extra pack of
[00:18:36] something if you beat the buyer here oo
[00:18:38] that's how the carnival game works there
[00:18:40] and you always get three packs of
[00:18:42] cards which are just written on here so
[00:18:44] like you pull this out and you're like

[00:18:59] Mona value is the one that we pull the
[00:19:04] um the one that you get to pull another

[00:32:49] you want to play the adventure game we
[00:32:50] can we have our live one that we use our
[00:32:52] Oliver at dice for but no one's been
[00:32:55] jumping in on it recently so that's why
[00:32:56] I uh been going with some of the other
[00:32:58] things that we have showing you guys
[00:33:03] those no one's even in chat
[00:33:05] here may we do all chat live chat uh no

[00:33:13] same just be your
[00:33:18] friend all righty my wrist is
[00:33:22] s need to get that thing running battery
[00:33:25] charge and use that so I can do some
[00:33:27] more uh development of my
[00:33:31] chatbot I want to hopefully have that
[00:33:33] made so at least I can use it the next
[00:33:37] week or two so I can have it before a
[00:33:38] big thing in a couple weeks here and
[00:33:40] then I was going to try to get it
[00:33:42] packaged up so if any know else wants it
[00:33:44] they can uh they can buy it try it
[00:33:46] themselves out
[00:33:49] yeah thought that' be intriguing
[00:33:57] all
[00:33:59] righty my wrist is
[00:34:02] definitely sore so I think that massage
[00:34:05] thing will help out a lot I wish it had
[00:34:07] the heating and non-heating feature the
[00:34:09] heat feature it died in it after
[00:34:11] probably like 6 months but the rest of
[00:34:14] it still works so we'll see well
[00:34:16] hopefully it still works I haven't used
[00:34:17] it in a couple months cuz my hands have
[00:34:19] been okay I haven't been doing as much
[00:34:20] of the uh programming for my personal
[00:34:22] stuff and work at the same time put more
[00:34:25] effort into the
[00:34:26] um to to the
[00:34:29] um what do you call it recently the one
[00:34:32] of the things here that I've been doing
[00:34:33] well it's not effort it's more I've had

[00:35:01] working there we
[00:35:06] go all right let's see what else to do
[00:35:10] here H trying to think what else we
[00:35:12] should do here
[00:35:14] today what do you guys want to see that
[00:35:16] are hanging out here anything you want
[00:35:18] to see happen any uh anything you
[00:35:21] looking for you just kind of hanging out
[00:35:22] somebody today told me asked me if I do
[00:35:26] podcast or
[00:35:31] um some type of talk show or something
[00:35:33] like that I can't remember what it was
[00:35:35] podcast or like a or a video or a
[00:35:38] videoast talk show because they said my
[00:35:41] voice is perfect for it like well that's
[00:35:43] intriguing haven't heard that one that
[00:35:45] was the first time I heard that one I've
[00:35:47] had people tell me before I should
[00:35:48] definitely do a like take the adventure
[00:35:50] game I do and make it into something
[00:35:51] else and uh like I should do it like be
[00:35:53] a dungeon dungeon master type thing so
[00:35:56] I've had that before but that was the
[00:35:58] first time I've had somebody go like hey
[00:35:59] your your voice is perfect for air
[00:36:02] everybody needs to hear you speak it's
[00:36:05] like okay man thank you I like it I'll
[00:36:08] take it not too many people come in and
[00:36:11] say that so hey this is a good flash
[00:36:13] deal right now it's a good flash deal
[00:36:16] right now for you
[00:36:22] guys we run maybe you want something a
[00:36:25] little lower
[00:36:28] there we go maybe some red buttons for a
[00:36:30] little lower thing I don't know what do
[00:36:31] you guys think let me know is that
[00:36:34] accurate assumption on that person's
[00:36:36] part or do I sound like a broken record
[00:36:38] and no one wants to listen to
[00:36:41] me probably look like a look like a
[00:36:43] broken record with how old I am compared
[00:36:45] to everybody else on the planet that
[00:36:47] does these things online it was the only
[00:36:49] reason I started doing it was cuz my
[00:36:50] well other well there's a lot of older
[00:36:52] people that do it on other places too
[00:36:54] but uh on YouTube my kids asked me to do
[00:36:57] it they were like hey hey can we do this
[00:36:58] stuff up there on YouTube and I was like
[00:37:01] yeah you know what no why not we'll try
[00:37:02] we'll see what happens and hey we've
[00:37:05] been having some fun selling some stuff
[00:37:07] I've been able to grow a little bit of a
[00:37:08] small little business that might be able
[00:37:10] to do something with it myself as we do
[00:37:11] a little our traveling thing around the
[00:37:12] world as a little side gig to help us
[00:37:14] once we uh you know move out of the
[00:37:16] United States area yeah see what happens
[00:37:30] all right I I'm going to open up and see
[00:37:32] what I got I can't remember what I got
[00:37:35] here what did I get I know I didn't win
[00:37:38] anything good I probably got Junk
[00:37:39] because I never win when I play games of
[00:37:42] any kind I play games every now and
[00:37:44] again I'll jump in once in a once a
[00:37:47] month maybe to play a game of some kind
[00:37:49] that somebody
[00:37:50] has and I don't always know and I'm I've
[00:37:52] been the reason is because I generally
[00:37:54] have really bad luck so I don't like to
[00:37:56] jump in frequently
[00:37:58] so here we
[00:38:05] go what did I get here oh this was a
[00:38:08] good one
[00:38:09] ready
[00:38:10] ready I got that that wasn't too
[00:38:13] bad World gorger that was a nice one
[00:38:16] right there World gorger and then then
[00:38:20] the cool one that I got was a CERN of
[00:38:24] souls I actually got lucky on that one
[00:38:26] it because I had my wife
[00:38:28] not me so I might actually be using this
[00:38:31] myself cuz I think I have a foil version
[00:38:33] of the caver Souls so that means I have
[00:38:37] now two of
[00:38:40] them what do we do with two I don't keep
[00:38:43] two CU I don't need two we don't need
[00:38:45] two of them I have one of them that's
[00:38:47] good enough for me in my family if I
[00:38:48] really need two of them that in my
[00:38:49] family because we're using them in a
[00:38:50] deck I'll give it to my child to use in
[00:38:52] their deck or if we're all using it at
[00:38:54] the same time cuz we're playing at the
[00:38:56] kitchen table I don't care we'll throw a
[00:38:58] proxy down for each
[00:39:00] person that was a good that was a good
[00:39:02] pet pull from my wife there we are very
[00:39:04] happy with that
[00:39:10] one I don't where they get these big
[00:39:12] thick ones I'm going to find out on how
[00:39:14] much those are and where they get those
[00:39:15] from cuz I kind of like the thick ones
[00:39:17] there to send some extra cards in so
[00:39:19] that way I can send like
[00:39:21] this here you go see this is what he was
[00:39:24] saying he s sent me a couple of the uh
[00:39:26] merfolk here so I got this which is what
[00:39:28] we got in there by the my folk was what
[00:39:31] my wife has been working for looking for
[00:39:32] from OTC for a while now they're not
[00:39:34] even that hard cards to fine but she's
[00:39:37] wanted them because she's like I can't
[00:39:39] find them and this one's cool cuz it has
[00:39:41] a little bit of
[00:39:42] like like misprint on it like it was
[00:39:45] like pulled off the printer or something

[00:39:58] Triton sh stalker can't be blocked I
[00:40:00] don't know really why she wants that oh
[00:40:02] I think she because she likes the things
[00:40:03] that because since he can't be blocked
[00:40:05] and all of her cards do plus stuff on
[00:40:07] the character that'll make it a big hard
[00:40:08] one kick eror zero you may pay an

[00:44:33] foils get these in some sleeves for you
[00:44:35] what do you think that was good luck hit

[00:44:43] Theos put them back to
[00:44:46] back because no one with these these
[00:44:49] sleeves it helps to keep them from
[00:44:50] sliding out what we do is like
[00:44:54] this then slide them in there
[00:44:59] little
[00:45:00] YY gifts ungiven your other cards there
[00:45:03] and let me write your name down thank
[00:45:06] you
[00:45:08] Queen how does this bid work hold on one
[00:45:11] second I wasn't reading it I was reading
[00:45:13] your other thing I was reading your
[00:45:16] cards if you do the um every just show
[00:45:18] you arew if you quickly think that's a
[00:45:20] circle with the question mark that will
[00:45:22] always tell you what the um what the uh
[00:45:27] information on any of that the games
[00:45:29] that I have out
[00:45:31] are now the way the bid was running I
[00:45:33] just had it running for a little while
[00:45:34] cuz no one was in here so rather than me
[00:45:36] running them like 10 times I was just
[00:45:39] running them one for a little bit cuz no
[00:45:40] one was hanging out in here really ear
[00:45:41] they coming in and out so that's all
[00:45:43] that was going on
[00:45:46] there so the bid here I'm going to run
[00:45:49] this one again here we'll do
[00:45:55] this there you go
[00:45:58] now the bid what you do is red buttons
[00:46:02] are these here if you read the um read
[00:46:06] those that question mark that tells you
[00:46:08] those are red buttons now those red
[00:46:10] buttons are what you get is 10 of those
[00:46:12] to pull in the potential with those red
[00:46:14] buttons what you get are I'll let you
[00:46:16] know because I'll read them off here
[00:46:18] there's a bunch of different things
[00:46:19] there were, 1600 cards I think were down
[00:46:21] to like 1,200 now but you had their
[00:46:24] cards they were it was ridiculous thing
[00:46:25] I didn't want to do this I was ask to
[00:46:27] it's anywhere from like 10 cents to $150
[00:46:30] for your cards most of them are under
[00:46:32] 50 but the big hit on it was this one of
[00:46:36] the cards has this written on it some of
[00:46:39] the other cards have packs written on
[00:46:40] them like collector booster packs draft
[00:46:43] booster
[00:46:45] packs um set booster packs or something
[00:46:48] like
[00:46:48] that but you get 10 of those where would
[00:46:51] you like me to go my
[00:46:53] friend or how many would you like me to
[00:46:55] or where would you like me to pick out
[00:46:57] of that red button area plus I can
[00:46:59] always make that bigger if you need
[00:47:04] to hopefully that explanation was a
[00:47:07] sound for
[00:47:16] you dealer's Choice all right I like it
[00:47:19] sounds like a plan now I hope I have the
[00:47:22] hot hands because as I said before my
[00:47:25] wife had him last night not me
[00:47:27] I know World G is not a big one but my
[00:47:29] son likes the dragons so I like to put
[00:47:30] them in sleeves especially the shiny
[00:47:33] ones all right here we

[01:20:02] for I only have one Fallout left also
[01:20:06] this is crazy I actually think I might
[01:20:07] need to get some collector boosters but
[01:20:09] I'm trying to figure out how I have to
[01:20:10] get some rid of you know
[01:20:12] what that's what I think I need to do
[01:20:15] that's what I think I need to
[01:20:19] do so what I think I need to do
[01:20:39] B
[01:21:09] nope eyes new to the channel sorcery
[01:21:13] beta is a different game other than
[01:21:16] magic it's actually uh just Aver a new
[01:21:18] game the art is actually really cool on
[01:21:20] it here let me show you some of the art
[01:21:23] that we have so we my CU my family have
[01:21:25] our own box that we open up
[01:21:29] sometimes and I'll show you some of the
[01:21:31] cool art this is some of the cool cards
[01:21:33] like the good cards that we've gotten
[01:21:34] out of our box um because we've just
[01:21:37] started playing a game with it so these
[01:21:39] are some of the cool cards we have like
[01:21:40] so here it's just like a it's
[01:21:42] combination of Chess and magic in a way
[01:21:44] is what I've been explaining it is kind
[01:21:45] of when I've seen it so you have this
[01:21:47] like a little kri that's like cool like
[01:21:49] the art on that I find the art really
[01:21:51] good on all these and that's why I think
[01:21:52] I like it so much is the art on on it
[01:21:55] and the cards are uh different also the
[01:21:58] cards feel a little bit different too
[01:21:59] they're a little like I don't know they
[01:22:00] feel better I don't know how else
[01:22:02] explain it but they're really nice I
[01:22:03] like them so yeah it's just like a new
[01:22:05] card game um that I've been playing that
[01:22:07] some people have I mean some of the
[01:22:08] cards in here are are already at like
[01:22:10] thousands of dollars in this sorcery
[01:22:12] game which is intriguing to me I've
[01:22:13] never knew that I was just trying to
[01:22:15] play pick it up CU seemed like a fun one
[01:22:16] to play it play and pick up and I got to
[01:22:18] like I guess some of the foils and the
[01:22:20] special ones that you get can be worth a
[01:22:21] lot of money but yeah that's what uh
[01:22:24] some the cool cool art on it there as
[01:22:25] you can see the Arts they're nice like
[01:22:28] that art to me is really cool way better
[01:22:30] than what magic has become recently you
[01:22:34] know but yeah that's really it like yeah
[01:22:37] I don't know that's why I think I like
[01:22:38] the art it's a different style of art I
[01:22:40] know the other art is you know they are
[01:22:42] Magic's art and they have their very
[01:22:44] good art in different times but on the
[01:22:45] on regular I kind of like this art
[01:22:47] compared to the other that's what it is
[01:22:49] that's big that's really what it is uh
[01:22:50] bunch of different cards it's a new card
[01:22:52] game yeah if you want to jump in that's
[01:22:54] all that is right there give a little
[01:22:56] discount on a new card game if you want
[01:22:58] for a few

[01:23:25] homelands and I know people have opened
[01:23:26] those too recently and those it looks it
[01:23:28] reminds me of like kind of like that art
[01:23:29] in a way I mean homelands wasn't the

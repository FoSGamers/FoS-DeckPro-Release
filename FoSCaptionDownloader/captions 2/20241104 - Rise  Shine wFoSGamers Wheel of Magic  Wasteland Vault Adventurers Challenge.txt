[00:09:28] one of the the Sund days are always
[00:09:30] starting off like these generally but
[00:09:32] when you don't have the newer products
[00:09:34] which is okay I understand that so let's
[00:09:36] see let's throw out a
[00:09:38] um maybe something like
[00:09:42] this a
[00:09:44] little
[00:09:48] Ghostbusters secret layer
[00:09:50] [Music]
[00:09:53] for this if you would like it this will
[00:09:56] get you we you know we'll do three
[00:09:57] letter guesses why not
[00:10:01] why not how's you guys mornings going so
[00:10:02] far though hopefully you're having a
[00:10:03] good
[00:10:13] one hopefully you're all having a good
[00:10:21] one no all
[00:10:23] right if you would like to buy some you
[00:10:25] could easily do that here I will send
[00:10:27] you the link to where I am right now
[00:10:29] it's also in the show notes by the way
[00:10:31] if you want to go there the show um or
[00:10:32] the show description has uh link tree to
[00:10:38] it all right so the letter guessing
[00:10:41] works is just you jump in you purchase
[00:10:44] whatever is here so say whatever you
[00:10:46] want to or like I've putting up packs
[00:10:47] and other things like that so for
[00:10:49] instance I put out a uh Ravnica pack you
[00:10:53] say all right I like that ravnik pack
[00:10:55] but I think I'm going to guess a letter
[00:10:57] so you would guess a letter to go with
[00:11:00] it let me move this pack back a little
[00:11:01] bit slide that a littleit there there we
[00:11:03] go and I would go like this I throw it
[00:11:05] out here i' say all right well rabn a
[00:11:07] pack I'll throw it out for this to start
[00:11:09] it You' get you'd say I'll take that
[00:11:10] ravnik a pack and I'm going to guess a
[00:11:11] letter to go with it and that's how you
[00:11:14] would do it you're very welcome clip now
[00:11:16] the way we do these here if you don't
[00:11:17] mind give me a number between one and 10
[00:11:18] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 N9 10 yes because there
[00:11:22] is a um rare and the sorcery card
[00:11:25] there's a sorcery card in there so you
[00:11:26] get an option of getting potentially of
[00:11:28] those one two 3 four five is turn inside
[00:11:32] out we got our we do not get the rare
[00:11:34] there but it gets you a discount on
[00:11:36] shipping if you would like to jump in on
[00:11:37] anything and um I can always some people
[00:11:40] ask me to sign cards too sometimes so
[00:11:42] you can do that if you'd like but I'm
[00:11:44] not I sign it by writing your name on
[00:11:46] the back of it anyways well the back of
[00:11:49] the sleeve at least that way you can use
[00:11:50] it now I'm going to put it over here
[00:11:52] where is my I had a box here a minute
[00:11:55] ago oh there it is there it is there's
[00:11:57] the box that I had
[00:12:00] there we
[00:12:01] go put you there with the others I like
[00:12:05] it you're very welcome thank you for
[00:12:08] coming in and hanging out we appreciate
[00:12:09] it so if you'd like to yeah you jump in
[00:12:11] and we'll do that or maybe we'll do some
[00:12:13] singles for a bit shouldn't go there
[00:12:16] that goes the rabbit ones over
[00:12:18] here maybe we'll do some singles for a
[00:12:21] bit then instead so um some people like
[00:12:23] to jump in on Singles instead of doing
[00:12:26] um those so for instance we'll do a
[00:12:31] uh we'll throw out an
[00:12:34] Essence enduring innocence I
[00:12:37] mean put that there we'll zoom in I'll
[00:12:42] put the card price out if it pops up
[00:12:44] does it pop up oh not going to
[00:12:46] show
[00:12:50] why why is it not going to show
[00:13:11] why does car price not
[00:13:14] work price should
[00:13:22] work yeah Why didn't it work there we go
[00:13:26] anyways we'll put that
[00:13:29] and during instance maybe you want to do
[00:13:30] that and we'll let you do a letter guess
[00:13:32] with that
[00:13:34] instead put out um now this one is
[00:13:39] 36 so we'll do that I'll put that on the
[00:13:41] screen and you can do this
[00:13:44] instead for a single if you'd
[00:13:47] like let me edit it so it's going for
[00:13:50] there there there and we'll do a single
[00:13:53] start it out that way maybe you guys
[00:13:54] want to do it that way and instead uh
[00:13:56] there we go single and if you guess the
[00:14:00] if you buy this you get to guess a
[00:14:01] letter and see where it goes and if you
[00:14:03] get a
[00:14:03] letter we add you to our list of um you
[00:14:06] get to spend the wheel I mean if you get
[00:14:09] a letter that's correct you spin our
[00:14:11] wheel to see what happens if you get
[00:14:12] anything and if you get something then
[00:14:15] we put you up on our
[00:14:16] leaderboard there's my
[00:14:18] drink so I don't
[00:14:23] know but I can also add in um since this
[00:14:26] doesn't seem to be rolling much I might
[00:14:28] just add in the other stuff I don't know
[00:14:31] if that's going to get there demolition
[00:14:32] or
[00:14:39] spawn demoli
[00:14:41] spawn yeah so nothing big on that
[00:14:44] nothing there I know that's not a large
[00:14:45] one but I know some people like
[00:14:56] this you go
[00:15:01] Overlord of flood
[00:15:03] pits now you buy this you can have a
[00:15:05] guess for a letter that's kind of how we
[00:15:07] do it yeah there you
[00:15:10] go for a uh Overlord of the flood pits
[00:15:15] and see what you like um I feel like
[00:15:17] this oh that's what there is down last
[00:15:19] time I figured that out ah we have light
[00:15:21] we turn it down because uh in the
[00:15:23] morning we are still in my bedroom here
[00:15:25] so it takes a minute to get used to it
[00:15:27] so the light not all the way up all
[00:15:30] no one wants that either all right so no
[00:15:32] singles right now well then so what I'm
[00:15:35] going to end up
[00:15:38] doing it's definitely the soul ring up
[00:15:40] in the background it's definitely 100% a
[00:15:43] soul ring right now all right let me uh
[00:15:46] move that
[00:15:47] away and we're going to
[00:15:49] um yeah all right we'll do that
[00:15:57] then all right and let me move this over
[00:16:02] to here that way I can be transparent

[00:19:40] um it was another one of the games where
[00:19:42] I ended up walking away just because I
[00:19:44] got tired of dealing with um I'm tired
[00:19:46] of dealing with some of the things now
[00:19:48] he did very
[00:19:52] well so it wasn't necessar him he did
[00:19:54] very
[00:19:55] well so we're going to put this up here
[00:19:58] um the team did very well but the refs
[00:20:01] literally let somebody shoulder someone
[00:20:02] in the in right in the middle of the
[00:20:04] chest didn't call a penalty of any kind
[00:20:06] then they start the other team started
[00:20:07] tripping and doing other things and I
[00:20:09] got up and left because I'm like I'm not
[00:20:10] going to get out the refs anymore
[00:20:12] obviously there's a problem with people
[00:20:13] in this area and they're
[00:20:14] so I'm done dealing with it all
[00:20:17] right so
[00:20:19] anyways so I got up and I left halfway
[00:20:21] through yeah I'm like this isn't a
[00:20:23] football game I'm like if it's a I told
[00:20:25] my kids now I'm like my kids are the
[00:20:26] some of the bigger ones when they're
[00:20:27] playing I tell them to teach play right
[00:20:30] like this is the first time after that
[00:20:32] game like you know what boys if you ever
[00:20:33] see somebody take a kid out on your team
[00:20:34] like they did that time you can
[00:20:36] take anyone out on that team from now on
[00:20:39] I don't care if someone on their team
[00:20:41] takes one of yours out by putting a
[00:20:42] shoulder into their chest and almost
[00:20:44] breaking their ribs knock them
[00:20:46] the out because I know you can and
[00:20:48] I've seen you do it I've seen both of
[00:20:50] you launch kids beat in the air just by
[00:20:52] running through them now I'm giving you
[00:20:54] the ability to use your hands if you
[00:20:55] need cuz I'm done with this
[00:20:57] gleon don't don't start a fight but we
[00:20:59] will end that
[00:21:01] fight so I told them they can end it
[00:21:04] now they're not the other teams aren't
[00:21:06] going to like it
[00:21:08] because gave him a little bit of dirty
[00:21:11] play ideas but I'm an when
[00:21:13] people are to us so ever heard
[00:21:17] that the people make the comment like
[00:21:18] you know I'm I'm a very nice person
[00:21:20] everybody thinks I'm a very nice person
[00:21:21] but there's a few people that think I'm
[00:21:23] an they are both they are both
[00:21:25] very right that's because the people
[00:21:27] that think I'm an have been
[00:21:28] shown me that what they were so I react
[00:21:31] back to them in that
[00:21:33] manner all right we're going to throw
[00:21:35] the wheel
[00:21:37] out and uh we're going to put this was
[00:21:42] $20 and now I can't help this going out
[00:21:44] as uh with the shipping here that it
[00:21:47] has but I can
[00:21:50] um can give you a little discount so
[00:21:53] instead of 22 I'm going to make it
[00:21:57] 20 yeah yeah well I never got in a fight
[00:21:59] we never started them but whenever I
[00:22:01] start had an issue in any type of
[00:22:03] situation I did end it people never give
[00:22:05] me a hard time after that this will get

[00:22:22] need to get it running again here cuz it
[00:22:23] was pretty fun I still have the pull
[00:22:25] boxes in here for it but what I'll do
[00:22:27] then is you know what
[00:22:29] what let's do this this is what I'm
[00:22:31] going to do actually this is what I'm
[00:22:33] going to do right now where
[00:22:40] is where is my
[00:22:46] uh
[00:22:57] there all right
[00:23:03] right do that instead all right let's do
[00:23:05] that we're going to adjust something
[00:23:07] here we're going to make an adjustment
[00:23:09] since no one was jumping right away on
[00:23:10] that we're going to put the uh we'll put
[00:23:12] the wheel out but I'm going to do this
[00:23:15] um all right
[00:23:34] okay I'll take that is it really really
[00:23:35] full no oh perfect I did mine first oh
[00:23:38] you did yours first that's why hey can
[00:23:39] you take this cup back please thank you
[00:23:42] very much
[00:23:43] beautiful shoot don't DP anything there
[00:23:46] you go that's where you get
[00:23:48] your shoulder strength sometimes for
[00:23:50] yeah we'll play the game
[00:23:54] again oh don't don't worry about it well
[00:23:56] I'll get it running here um
[00:24:03] and
[00:24:07] um
[00:24:22] then all right we'll do that that there
[00:24:27] we go not a problem I understand that it
[00:24:30] happens sometimes so I'll end up opening
[00:24:32] you know what I'm going to end up
[00:24:33] opening something here because we had
[00:24:35] multiple ones of these that we got in
[00:24:38] our um boxes and I want to open one of
[00:24:40] these and then I'm going to end up doing
[00:24:41] a um I'll end up putting the virtual
[00:24:43] pole boxes in I just need to go and grab
[00:24:45] them again and just make sure I delete
[00:24:47] everything that was in them from before
[00:24:50] because I can't have the duplicate cards
[00:24:52] in there you know or I can have them as
[00:24:54] duplicate cards in there and copy and
[00:24:55] just say any you know what maybe I'll
[00:24:57] just do that and just tell you guys any
[00:24:58] of them that are duplicates or ones that

[00:32:34] you got two in a row that means you uh
[00:32:37] you have some luck so one of the fun
[00:32:39] things so one of the things we were

[00:32:44] they didn't send me top loaders which
[00:32:46] really annoys me when I bought them they
[00:32:48] sent me one package the people it annoys
[00:32:51] it instead of like the Thousand that I
[00:32:53] bought so that's very annoying but
[00:32:55] anyways
[00:32:58] I'm going to put that there what I'm
[00:33:00] going to do is I'm going to put the rest
[00:33:01] of them

[00:46:43] I know we had some I'm going to open up
[00:46:45] another one we'll open up our Wilds here
[00:46:47] because we do have three packs here that
[00:46:48] are left from our own things that we had
[00:46:51] so I'm going to open up the Wilds pack
[00:46:52] now because I would like to see if we
[00:46:54] get a confetti probably not
[00:46:57] but
[00:47:02] um oh no
[00:47:13] words try that
[00:47:37] let try that
[00:47:41] instead well we'll see how things go
[00:47:45] sorcery pole box game What's that the
[00:47:48] sorcery pole box so sorcery is our
[00:47:50] sorcery here and it is $2 and you get a
[00:47:53] chance to pull out out of this the beta
[00:47:55] C uh all these cards here all right now
[00:47:57] we're going to put I'm just going to
[00:47:58] give you an example you grab one card at
[00:48:02] a time out of any of these and say you
[00:48:04] said you wanted this one you would have
[00:48:05] gotten that card but what we do is we
[00:48:07] have all these in here that you can have
[00:48:10] the the sorcery cards on now some of
[00:48:12] them have beta written on them for a
[00:48:15] beta pack there's very few of them but
[00:48:17] most of them are here just so you guys
[00:48:18] that wanted to get some sorcery cards
[00:48:20] you could get some sorcery cards for
[00:48:21] cheap that's kind of how we did that so
[00:48:23] I'm going to shuffle those back up so we
[00:48:24] had some of those with beta written on
[00:48:26] it for beta pack you know what I'm going
[00:48:27] to do actually I'm going to do this if I
[00:48:29] don't pull a chunk out that has one that
[00:48:30] has beta on it we're going to add beta
[00:48:32] onto one we're going to add another one
[00:48:34] beta we're going to put a you know what
[00:48:36] actually I'm G to put
[00:48:37] in arth thoran Legend
[00:48:42] actually going put out a few in a few of
[00:48:45] those since we have new
[00:48:55] stuff you got about
[00:49:00] that let's add those in there now
[00:49:03] because there's a new
[00:49:06] product and what it is is you get the
[00:49:09] pack here the single or the pack on
[00:49:14] it let me do that we're going to add
[00:49:17] some of them in here because I just
[00:49:19] realized we have
[00:49:20] none of arther and Legend stuff in there
[00:49:23] so we should probably add some in that
[00:49:24] was silly of me to really not have those
[00:49:26] in there at
[00:49:27] all so we're going to grab a handful of
[00:49:30] these
[00:49:34] out there we
[00:49:36] go that's how many we're going to do
[00:49:38] there we're going to add 10 of those in
[00:49:40] then we're going to do
[00:49:42] artherion that means you get better
[00:49:43] chances of getting stuff now so you get
[00:49:46] beta or Aran
[00:49:50] Legend and
[00:49:55] then we'll put um I'll open that
[00:49:58] collector of
[00:50:04] Wilds I completely forgot about
[00:50:08] that no one asked much about the box
[00:50:11] here for the um the this one so I
[00:50:14] completely forgot about
[00:50:16] it I always like to update them if we
[00:50:18] have a new product to add to
[00:50:22] it yeah ites sometimes doesn't always
[00:50:24] benefit me if I put too much into it
[00:50:26] because there's better chances for you
[00:50:28] guys to get
[00:50:34] stuff but that's
[00:50:37] okay I like opening
[00:50:41] stuff that's why I'm
[00:50:44] here you guys help um help me so I can
[00:50:47] open
[00:50:49] things have fun with you guys there we
[00:50:51] go I completely forgot I had that there
[00:50:54] all right so that means we're going to
[00:50:55] be adding in
[00:50:57] right now let's see how many are
[00:50:59] here 1 two 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14

[00:51:08] let's make it an even
[00:51:13] 15 I know it's not even but it's a
[00:51:16] number that would be more regular than
[00:51:17] 14 unless you're talking about days and
[00:51:20] weeks all right here we go I'm going to
[00:51:22] do that here give me I'm going to do a
[00:51:24] second here I'm going to do this going

[00:51:50] Legend to try that you can maybe get

[00:57:58] today right now we're going to open up
[00:58:01] the whole thing here for this box that's
[00:58:04] what the break is that I'm pinning here
[00:58:07] I don't know why it's not showing what
[00:58:09] showing what it is but we'll open this
[00:58:10] up right now we're going to see what we

[00:58:23] after a weapon now remember everybody
[00:58:27] there are not if some of these spots are
[00:58:29] taken some of this stuff this is a
[00:58:30] repeat of yesterday's so the boxes may
[00:58:32] be there and if one of the packs cards
[00:58:33] is not here that means it was taken and
[00:58:35] you get another chance so that's the way
[00:58:37] we're doing this here all right so this
[00:58:38] is a $2 pole box you get potentially a
[00:58:40] mystery booster to or
[00:58:43] singles that are in there or and also
[00:58:46] you're going to get a weapon if you're
[00:58:47] going to play the adventure game for
[00:58:49] your character uhuh but this gets you a
[00:58:53] chance at a mystery booster too but it
[00:58:54] guarantees you at least some of the
[00:58:56] singles that are in
[00:58:58] there all right it's only $2 too so not
[00:59:00] bad one two three four five six 78 we
[00:59:06] tried to keep it the same size as
[00:59:07] yesterday but I forgot to delete the
[00:59:09] cards so I was like you know we'll just
[00:59:11] run it again when if a card that pops up
[00:59:14] all right no one wanted to go after that
[00:59:16] one all right maybe you want um a modern
[00:59:20] horizon or a secret
[00:59:21] lair for a $3 attent or some
[00:59:24] singles all an island Ash Party
[00:59:29] Crasher crash all right Twisted

[01:00:15] all right and then a food token you know
[01:00:17] what you could have given us something a
[01:00:19] little bit better in that Festival in a
[01:00:20] box I mean if you're going to dink us
[01:00:22] with money you might as well do that a
[01:00:24] little bit better here we go monster
[01:00:26] brisket nice you got a
[01:00:29] Lenoir and then monster what this means
[01:00:32] is if you were going to play our game

[01:00:36] for the
[01:00:38] intelligence so with that being said do

[01:01:12] glitch with how watn did something all
[01:01:15] right let me write your name down on
[01:01:16] this monster I'm going to run this again
[01:01:17] to see if somebody else wants to try it

[01:01:21] that we have available
[01:01:28] monster brisket it was nice though
[01:01:30] because it was we I was very happy to
[01:01:32] have actually the fallback because um we
[01:01:35] had been on a we when we were into Vegas
[01:01:37] we started we got used to being at that
[01:01:39] time frame and then with with uh coming
[01:01:42] back here it took us a while to get back
[01:01:44] we were just tired and now that with
[01:01:46] that fall back was like perfect timing
[01:01:48] for the fallback for us to come back
[01:01:49] from Vegas after getting used to like
[01:01:51] the three-hour
[01:01:52] difference yes yes so exactly so the
[01:01:55] three that helped us actually so ooh
[01:01:57] look at that a path to Exile in Oblivion
[01:02:00] you would have with your character if
[01:02:02] you wanted to play a character here with
[01:02:04] a plus one intelligence and then you
[01:02:06] would be able to go on a little
[01:02:07] adventure with your character already
[01:02:09] having plus one intelligence through
[01:02:11] their uh the Wasteland here would you
[01:02:13] like to uh would you like to try one of
[01:02:15] those and start a little adventure with
[01:02:17] our character too we're going our
[01:02:19] intelligence we're going to your path to
[01:02:20] Exile though let me grab that
[01:02:22] out you good all
[01:02:24] righty and
[01:02:28] have two Exile foil nice one
[01:02:35] there there you go path to Exile thank
[01:02:39] you my friend very much appreciate
[01:02:43] it Oblivion wielder how's your day been
[01:02:46] I know you said you were doing good you
[01:02:48] got anything planned
[01:02:49] today now we got a soccer game so we're
[01:02:51] not going to be able to be on all day so
[01:02:53] I'm going to have to get on I think it's
[01:02:54] I get off around I think it's like noon
[01:02:56] maybe but there you go that was a good
[01:02:59] pick up on that one there you go we'll
[01:03:01] try that uh we'll try this one maybe
[01:03:03] somebody would like to go after the
[01:03:04] specifically the hit hitsun m one
[01:03:07] because this is a little bit more
[01:03:08] expensive that's why it's a little bit
[01:03:10] higher on the pole box do you know we'll
[01:03:12] do the same thing here but this one
[01:03:13] would have gotten you a safe haven if
[01:03:14] you wanted to try that and you were
[01:03:15] going to the adventure hey
[01:03:19] Gustavo yeah we got a soccer game
[01:03:21] nothing planned thus far well you know
[01:03:23] hey sometimes days when you have nothing
[01:03:25] planned are even like great because you
[01:03:28] have nothing planned you
[01:03:30] know oh no kid soccer kids soccer
[01:03:33] monster yes uh my young oldest had a
[01:03:36] game yesterday my youngest has a game
[01:03:37] today yeah but uh you know what we'll uh
[01:03:41] we'll run our somebody wants to jump in
[01:03:43] on our break there are 15 spots here so
[01:03:45] let's pin
[01:03:48] this play the game all right so the
[01:03:50] adventure game great is we would do it
[01:03:53] like this the first thing you do is you
[01:03:54] have to you have to get build your
[01:03:55] character all right you have to start
[01:03:57] off and build your character so one of
[01:03:58] the $6 pull boxes here it's one of these
[01:04:02] things I'm going to zoom out you'll see
[01:04:03] it here actually I'm just going to put
[01:04:05] this off to the side because we know I
[01:04:06] have a full box one through four here
[01:04:09] all right you see this one through
[01:04:11] four what you do is I'm going to run one
[01:04:14] of these we'll just say in one of these
[01:04:16] one through four box there I'm you know
[01:04:17] one of these one through four box I
[01:04:18] don't know which card it is we had
[01:04:20] Shuffle mod put in any one says play
[01:04:22] booster box now that play booster box is
[01:04:24] going to be a dust MN right now so
[01:04:25] that's what you'll get if you happen to
[01:04:26] get out of it now there were 1,700 cards
[01:04:28] is down to I don't know like 1,650 or
[01:04:31] something like that but either way all
[01:04:33] these are just have nothing written on
[01:04:35] them in regards to what they are for a
[01:04:36] pack but what that means is if you get a
[01:04:38] blank one no pack no play booster
[01:04:40] blocker I mean written on it it becomes
[01:04:43] you get either Bloom murders Exelon or
[01:04:46] Nik Coria now say you wanted to add
[01:04:49] another character or somebody else
[01:04:51] wanted to jump in with you or maybe you
[01:04:52] wanted to just upgrade your pack you
[01:04:54] could actually get two and try two
[01:04:55] attempts to get the uh the play booster
[01:04:57] box but instead of getting one of those
[01:05:00] you can get two of them two of each of
[01:05:01] these or you can get like a dusk M or a
[01:05:05] modern Horizon 3 now say you want to go
[01:05:07] three you can get a draft so on so forth
[01:05:09] kind of pretty much you're upgrading
[01:05:11] your pack or paying the amount for your
[01:05:12] pack that you want for as much as you
[01:05:13] want so we'd run this and then for
[01:05:16] instance in the first box here we'll run
[01:05:18] this one for instead of six we'll do for
[01:05:20] five so you're going to get a pack
[01:05:21] guaranteed at five for $5 this is going
[01:05:24] to be a pull from this box you're going
[01:05:26] to tell me where to go here and if it
[01:05:29] has no nothing written on it you get
[01:05:30] that but on on here is going to have
[01:05:32] something relating to an Adventure it
[01:05:35] could be a big bug that you have to
[01:05:37] fight against as your adventure
[01:05:40] wandering
[01:05:41] through the Vault and what you would do
[01:05:45] is you get your pack and say for
[01:05:46] instance we go and we pull out this one
[01:05:48] you say you want this one here you
[01:05:50] actually you know let's see if I can
[01:05:51] find one that has a thing written on it
[01:05:54] h i don't have money of them written on
[01:05:55] there all right hold
[01:05:57] on I have um I just started putting all
[01:06:00] the stickers on everything so that's
[01:06:01] part of my situation right now just
[01:06:04] started putting all the stickers on Stu
[01:06:06] let's see if I can find one with a
[01:06:07] sticker on it
[01:06:09] somewhere and pull these out see if I
[01:06:12] can find one with a sticker on it there
[01:06:13] we go look at that you pull it out you
[01:06:15] go oh look you got a gator Dow that
[01:06:17] means oh you do not have that but you're
[01:06:19] going to fight a gator Dow in the
[01:06:21] Wasteland here as your character in that
[01:06:23] Vault now you're going to have to figure
[01:06:24] out what you do do you run from that big
[01:06:27] Gator dowo or do you fight him with the
[01:06:30] weapons that you have now if you're
[01:06:32] lucky you had fought something you
[01:06:33] dropped a weapon before or maybe you're
[01:06:36] like you know what you started going in
[01:06:37] the game you go what I want to have uh
[01:06:39] start out and try and get a weapon right
[01:06:40] away and you say give me that weapon box
[01:06:43] and we run the weapon virtual pole box
[01:06:46] and you're going to get a single or a
[01:06:47] chance of getting a mystery booster two
[01:06:50] but you're guaranteed you're always
[01:06:51] going to get a weapon that goes the game
[01:06:53] it could be a knife could be a pistol it
[01:06:55] could be an ass assault rifle maybe
[01:06:56] you're going to be lucky and get a
[01:06:57] plasma rifle you know and that's what it
[01:06:59] would be play your little Adventure game
[01:07:01] get your things and play along with it
[01:07:03] that's how uh kind of how it goes I
[01:07:05] don't know if that makes any sense or
[01:07:06] helps but if you have any more questions
[01:07:09] do let me know
[01:07:13] please let me uh Le see this here
[01:07:42] there you go try something like that
[01:07:43] there and see if we happen there skin
[01:07:45] the gay de and use it to Arma see you
[01:07:47] can do stuff like that like exactly you
[01:07:49] can like hey I want to skin the D Gator
[01:07:50] Dow and use it as armor for the um for
[01:07:55] my character and you can potentially do
[01:07:58] that but the thing is though you'd have
[01:07:59] to like bring it over maybe to you'd
[01:08:01] have to end up going to a safe haven and
[01:08:03] use some of the pogs that you maybe got
[01:08:05] from your characters from fighting so
[01:08:07] you'd be like you know what I need to go
[01:08:08] to a safe haven and have them make my
[01:08:11] the skin of that Gator dowo into armor
[01:08:13] so you go all right hey can you run one
[01:08:15] of the safe havens for me you all right
[01:08:17] cool and I run one of the safe havens
[01:08:18] for you which gets you a chance at a
[01:08:19] hasson Miko secret lair or you get a
[01:08:24] single guaranteed that's in there and
[01:08:25] you go all right you go there and you go
[01:08:26] hey I got uh 20 pogs I'm going to give
[01:08:28] you to make this into armor and then you
[01:08:30] have a gator dowo armor I mean that's
[01:08:32] pretty fun
[01:08:34] right that's pretty much what we're
[01:08:36] doing having a little good
[01:08:40] time so let me see if I can read this
[01:08:43] off a little bit easier for you to
[01:08:45] understand let's see here where's
[01:08:48] um that
[01:08:52] there all right we have so for the game
[01:08:56] we're going to make it a little bit
[01:08:57] easier to see if I can
[01:09:00] yes got to kill it first exactly got to
[01:09:03] kill it first that's a hard one because
[01:09:04] the gator dowo is I believe it's an 18
[01:09:07] so what that means is when you're
[01:09:08] fighting the character we do actually
[01:09:10] quick couple of rolls with a dice here
[01:09:12] so you'll go all right we're going to
[01:09:14] have to get 18 or higher and oh my God
[01:09:15] you did not get 18 or higher to hit that
[01:09:17] Gater Dillo that means he hit you but
[01:09:19] say you had a weapon that gave you five
[01:09:21] all right so you had a sword and that
[01:09:22] gave you plus five you'd actually have
[01:09:24] 18 so you would be able to hit that
[01:09:26] Gator Dow and maybe you chop his tail
[01:09:28] off and kill it who knows with your
[01:09:30] mighty
[01:09:31] sword that you have that was left from a
[01:09:34] previous Adventure or something I don't
[01:09:35] know we'll find
[01:09:37] out you do haveing ideas yes it is
[01:09:40] interesting ideas all right true bits
[01:09:44] one two three four five 6 seven eight
[01:09:46] nine and I need a number between one and
[01:09:49] 10 from you my friend if you don't mind
[01:09:52] a number between one and 10 one two
[01:09:55] three gets you a diamond pickaxe it did
[01:09:58] not get you the rare or the sorcery card
[01:10:01] that's in there but it gets you a
[01:10:02] discount on your shipping if you want to
[01:10:03] try anything true
[01:10:05] bits so say you wanted to jump in and
[01:10:07] try your luck with uh one of the virtual
[01:10:10] pole boxes and say I want to go after
[01:10:12] that mystery booster or a single here
[01:10:15] you could do that and I think that's got
[01:10:16] free shipping for you for the most part
[01:10:18] right there because you got one card all
[01:10:22] right so let's give a little quick
[01:10:23] explanation of the game again for those
[01:10:24] of you that are just knew doing here
[01:10:26] we'll run our giveaway one more time all
[01:10:28] right that way you're hanging out but
[01:10:30] here's how it goes in the game you're
[01:10:33] you are an adventurer exploring an
[01:10:35] ancient Vault and deep in the and deep
[01:10:37] in the Wasteland you're searching for
[01:10:38] Treasures along the way and see how it
[01:10:40] goes now each pole is going to represent
[01:10:43] a new level in the vault so each one of
[01:10:44] these is like a new level or something
[01:10:46] that you run into every pole is a chance
[01:10:48] to go deeper in and get further progress
[01:10:50] in the further in the vault and get more
[01:10:52] creatures or stronger encounters
[01:10:55] now if you pull a card that has no
[01:10:57] writing on it as in no play booster
[01:10:58] written on it you you'll receive any one
[01:11:01] of these or you can upgrade as you go to
[01:11:03] if you get a second pull upgrade to
[01:11:06] higher packs because you get pay more
[01:11:08] you get more for your packs then if
[01:11:10] you're lucky and you get the one that's
[01:11:12] called um the full BLX that says full
[01:11:16] block on there you out of these cards
[01:11:17] you get a full play booster box all
[01:11:19] their cards are just for the game and
[01:11:21] they have the stickers on them that you
[01:11:22] saw now as you're exploring you might
[01:11:25] have something that says an encounter on
[01:11:27] it every now and again I'm going to
[01:11:28] throw weapons in here that are high high
[01:11:30] valuable weapons um maybe like some
[01:11:33] super weapons that aren't normal um or
[01:11:36] some items that aren't normal like maybe
[01:11:37] like a full health re uh repair type
[01:11:39] thing I might throw in one of these
[01:11:40] every now again now I'm working on that
[01:11:42] I'm still building those those are
[01:11:43] almost done as you saw not all of them
[01:11:45] have stickers but we're working on it
[01:11:47] after each pull you can decide whether
[01:11:48] you're going to continue further on the
[01:11:49] into the Vault deeper or if you're just
[01:11:52] going to keep what you have and run and
[01:11:53] one and run away or maybe re re uh do
[01:11:58] not necessar run away or maybe back up
[01:12:00] and find somewhere to hang out until you
[01:12:01] come back the next day tomorrow the next
[01:12:03] day you can because what we do is we

[01:18:53] point yeah but if you guys would like to

[01:19:11] understand that my I have people that do
[01:19:12] that like I used to wake up like that
[01:19:14] and then I'd fall back asleep but now
[01:19:16] that I've gotten older I sleep better

[01:19:36] couple rares insatiable
[01:19:40] frugivore Hearth borne battler oh I

[01:19:49] meizer ah I think this is one of the
[01:19:52] ones from Vegas where's my um
[01:19:57] seriously where to
[01:19:59] go there it
[01:20:01] is going to watch the game today get
[01:20:03] some insight before playing all right
[01:20:05] yeah not a problem not a l problem I
[01:20:08] understand that yeah so yesterday um are
[01:20:10] you talking about playing this thing
[01:20:11] here or the game here with us yeah so
[01:20:13] the game here if you want to play the
[01:20:14] way you had done it I'll give a little
[01:20:16] explanation I don't mind repeating
[01:20:18] myself with the
[01:20:20] explanations yeah let me give you an
[01:20:21] explanation here again all right quick
[01:20:23] one here so this is how the game works
[01:20:25] all right so let me uh actually let me
[01:20:27] quickly put the rares over here let me
[01:20:31] put these back here with our other ones
[01:20:35] so that I can uh put our giveaway cards
[01:20:38] available here I'm going to get those
[01:20:39] put away quickly so I can get to it here
[01:20:42] in a minute all right here we go going
[01:20:44] put those away I'm going to explain how
[01:20:46] this kind of goes so this card we're not
[01:20:48] using
[01:20:48] anymore H we're not even playing that
[01:20:50] anymore cuz no one wanted to so you in
[01:20:54] this game you're going to be an
[01:20:57] adventure and you are exploring a vault
[01:21:01] that you
[01:21:02] found and as you go you find different
[01:21:05] things hidden deep in the vault now
[01:21:07] first things that you do is you got to
[01:21:08] get your character and go into the Vault
[01:21:10] and it's one of these four boxes here
[01:21:12] now there's 17 well there were 1700
[01:21:14] cards things had been pulled out but out
[01:21:16] of the 1700 cards one of them has play
[01:21:18] booster box written on it so a whole
[01:21:20] play booster box okay the rest of them
[01:21:22] have nothing written on them in regards
[01:21:24] play boosters or cards or anything like
[01:21:26] that what that means is you're going to
[01:21:27] get either a bloom burrow murders lost
[01:21:30] Caverns or aoria which is your choice
[01:21:33] which starts out that's the $6 pull now
[01:21:35] say you want to go and try to do a
[01:21:37] second one or have maybe a second
[01:21:38] character like the other day yesterday
[01:21:39] we had people wanting two characters
[01:21:41] well if you want to you can either get
[01:21:42] two packs of these or you can go and say
[01:21:45] you know I want a DUS morning instead or
[01:21:47] I want a modern Horizon 3 or modern
[01:21:49] Horizon 2 because you're paying $12 you
[01:21:51] get a little bit extra but say you
[01:21:52] wanted to get you know three or four so
[01:21:54] on so forth because you wanted to keep
[01:21:56] encountering things as you go in the was
[01:21:57] and adventure and you go you know what
[01:21:59] and then you at the end say you got four
[01:22:01] of them you could get a collector
[01:22:02] booster of some kind Etc so on so forth
[01:22:05] but now each pull in a vault represents
[01:22:08] what you're going to get and you're
[01:22:09] going to go further and deeper in the
[01:22:10] vault now you could get something
[01:22:11] written on it say let's see let's pull
[01:22:13] out number
[01:22:14] two here we have all right so for
[01:22:16] instance you have this and it has a
[01:22:18] medium Raider written on it right there
[01:22:19] 16 and that does not have a pack written
[01:22:22] on it I mean the play booster so you
[01:22:24] don't get that but you're going to get
[01:22:25] one of the packs that are here just
[01:22:26] because it's a blank one but you'd have
[01:22:27] to
[01:22:28] fight a mediumsized Raider and you'd
[01:22:31] have to decide what you want to do
[01:22:32] because if you do not have any weapons
[01:22:34] yet all you have is a wrench to go after
[01:22:36] them so you can have a choice of maybe
[01:22:38] you want to go and use one of the
[01:22:41] virtual pole boxes and say you know I
[01:22:44] need a
[01:22:45] weapon go I'm going to take that weapon
[01:22:47] i' give me run that virtual pull box for
[01:22:48] me and you find a weapon you go you run
[01:22:50] this you go all
[01:22:51] right and when you're running it you go
[01:22:53] pay the you trade a chance of getting a
[01:22:55] mystery boost or two or a single but
[01:22:58] you're guaranteed to get a weapon for
[01:22:59] the
[01:23:01] game me and Jay cards are watching your
[01:23:03] stream nice I like that yeah I saw it's
[01:23:06] 12 you said it's 12 I like that you have
[01:23:08] Jay's watching so that's kind of how the
[01:23:10] game would go there and then um so as
[01:23:13] you explore you maybe you're going to
[01:23:14] find different encounters maybe you
[01:23:15] might find a secret weapon that's in
[01:23:16] here a special kind of weapon but it's
[01:23:19] always your choice to continue on see if
[01:23:20] you want to continue playing yeah
[01:23:24] yes if you want to pay if you want to
[01:23:26] you can create your own part of of
[01:23:27] characters I did up to five characters
[01:23:29] was the hard it was it was a little hard
[01:23:30] with five so I think I might only do
[01:23:31] four characters go a little harder with
[01:23:33] five keeping five track oh look at that
[01:23:36] one Oblivion nice pickup dude
[01:23:40] Overlord of the flood
[01:23:51] pits oh lord of the flood pits oh that
[01:23:53] was one that was pulled earlier so we
[01:23:54] have to run it
[01:23:56] again aha you get another chance at the
[01:23:58] mystery
[01:24:02] booster um was that pulled two I don't
[01:24:04] know if that one was pulled two oh we
[01:24:06] did not get the mystery booster but you
[01:24:08] got the
[01:24:09] moo where's the MU do we have mu in
[01:24:16] here
[01:24:17] alrazy there we go there's your test car
[01:24:20] there you know what I'm going to do here
[01:24:22] because it dropped down I feel bad this
[01:24:25] is what I'm going to do I'm going to do
[01:24:26] this we're going to add this for you
[01:24:28] we're going to
[01:24:30] do we're going to give you
[01:24:35] also a rip spawn Hunter with that
[01:24:39] because I don't like how that dropped
[01:24:41] down but yes you had a chance at that
[01:24:44] but as I said there you have a
[01:24:48] um olivan where's your name I know I
[01:24:50] have you right down there you did get a
[01:24:52] chance at booster but you did not have
[01:24:53] one but we'll get you uh another run it
[01:24:57] again if you
[01:25:00] want here you
[01:25:05] go yes there's five characters because I
[01:25:08] am the narrator that is true that is
[01:25:09] true good one that is true I am the
[01:25:12] narrator actually I was thinking of
[01:25:13] having the kids one of the days when we
[01:25:15] don't have soccer I going to see if the
[01:25:17] kids wanted to be the to be the ones
[01:25:19] that the enemies like when we pull out
[01:25:20] one of the things from there if you were
[01:25:21] going to pull out a character or
[01:25:23] whatever something to fight you would be
[01:25:25] uh one of the I was thinking of having
[01:25:28] them play as the
[01:25:29] enemies semantics I know semantics hey
[01:25:32] good morning NV so there you go for
[01:25:35] insto what I'll do here is I'll do this
[01:25:37] we'll run uh we'll run the first one so
[01:25:40] Oblivion for instance Oblivion with that
[01:25:43] Oblivion got a knife if they were going
[01:25:45] to play the game but for for right now
[01:25:48] I'm going to run the first pole box oh
[01:25:50] well you know what we'll do it from B
[01:25:51] BLX
[01:25:53] number four cuz we haven't done four I
[01:25:56] don't think yet we'll give you a
[01:25:57] discount for the first time if you want
[01:25:59] to try it but you guaranteed a pack
[01:26:01] maybe a play boost or box for $5 but
[01:26:03] either way you get to pick out be just
[01:26:05] to start your character and play a
[01:26:06] little game with
[01:26:08] us so yeah it's a little intriguing
[01:26:10] thing kind of fun silly whatever but
[01:26:13] makes it more you always get your
[01:26:15] package just whether or not you're going
[01:26:16] to get something else you let nil play
[01:26:18] your
[01:26:20] character there was a bit of chaos last
[01:26:23] stream there was a bit okay off last
[01:26:25] stream hey Dad guy how's it going my
[01:26:27] friend you did there was it was pretty
[01:26:29] fun for a little bit and then you get to
[01:26:32] you get to move your character along
[01:26:33] through the adventure as you go so yeah
[01:26:37] I know little little fun
[01:26:39] one or um I don't think this is going to
[01:26:42] happen today because it's 8:30 and I got
[01:26:44] to be done by noon but you know what
[01:26:46] we'll pin it we'll pin it if somebody
[01:26:52] wants yeah that's true
[01:26:55] if you wanted to buy some if you wanted
[01:26:56] to jump in uh and purchase one of the
[01:26:59] the packs here you can do
[01:27:03] that somebody was going to purchase pack
[01:27:05] and go with that we can do it let's do

[01:27:14] dice rolls correct that is Dice rolls I
[01:27:17] have dice roll right here correct so
[01:27:19] like it would say 16 so you'd have to
[01:27:21] get 16 or higher but say you had a sword
[01:27:24] that's a plus five if you have a sword
[01:27:25] so you would only need 11 or higher with
[01:27:27] your dice roll and we'd roll it and we'd
[01:27:29] go in here and we go all right oh you've
[01:27:31] got 20 oh that was a critical that means
[01:27:32] a critical hit you chopped them in half

[01:49:35] front of you right when you walk through
[01:49:36] that door but the only thing on you
[01:49:39] right
[01:49:41] now is a
[01:49:45] wrench outcome of the adventure not
[01:49:47] change what you're going to get
[01:49:48] necessarily but it can change the
[01:49:49] adventure the game and what's going on
[01:49:51] and what happens
[01:49:53] say for but say like you know I don't
[01:49:55] want to wrench you want to try to get a
[01:49:56] different type of weapon you like yo I
[01:49:58] want to run the weapon pull box please
[01:49:59] which is this V virtual one for $2 and
[01:50:02] you could get a weapon in this you could
[01:50:03] either get a knife a pistol an assault
[01:50:06] rifle a plasma rifle or something like
[01:50:08] that if you're lucky either way you're
[01:50:10] always going to get a card or you
[01:50:12] potentially could get the mystery
[01:50:13] booster
[01:50:16] too so there you go so this here yeah
[01:50:18] you can grab another character and you
[01:50:20] can go on again with the adventure or
[01:50:22] you can just be another um say you want
[01:50:25] to do another one and try it again with
[01:50:26] the main pull
[01:50:28] box virtual pull all right so the
[01:50:30] virtual pull box here is a single or a
[01:50:32] pack okay so the virtual pull box here
[01:50:35] is $2 only and you could get a mystery
[01:50:37] booster too potentially or one of the
[01:50:40] singles that's listed in there but also
[01:50:43] next to each one of them you can it's
[01:50:44] the this is the weapons one so if you
[01:50:46] want to try to buy a weapon is what it
[01:50:48] is you get a randomized weapon which
[01:50:49] could be a knife a pistol an assault
[01:50:51] rifle a PL plasma rifle something like
[01:50:56] that yeah extra a Modified pull box with
[01:50:59] extras for your character correct so for
[01:51:02] instance this is $2 now you're going to
[01:51:04] get a single or potentially you're lucky
[01:51:06] you get the mystery booster too but
[01:51:08] either way you're going to get a weapon
[01:51:09] of some kind for your
[01:51:11] character so that's kind of how we built
[01:51:14] the boxes that way to make them into the
[01:51:16] characters there that you can play with
[01:51:18] how much it is to play Paul well if you
[01:51:19] would like to play you can jump on over
[01:51:22] to our whatnot stream and we have been
[01:51:24] doing that and all is is just play by we
[01:51:26] play with our packs we buy if you want
[01:51:27] to play you just get a pack of cards and
[01:51:29] you can play right in with us um to play
[01:51:31] so right here for instance K4 jumped in
[01:51:34] and they go all right K4 goes I'm taking
[01:51:36] that one and goes I'm taking that got a
[01:51:39] leaf you got the leaf Crown Elder nice
[01:51:42] pickup on that
[01:51:47] one leaf Crown Elder right there that's
[01:51:50] a nice little pickup for you and with
[01:51:52] that he got a pistol so for instance his
[01:51:55] character would be a
[01:51:57] pistol all right yeah so right now um
[01:52:02] K4 got a pistol and that's for his
[01:52:05] character K4 P the other day and his
[01:52:08] character here his character has 90
[01:52:10] Health out of the 100 but they have a
[01:52:12] pistol and a plasma rifle
[01:52:14] now um as for their
[01:52:16] character so I'm GNA add in the pistol
[01:52:20] there and the pistol has uh every time
[01:52:23] you get the pistol when you get one it
[01:52:24] has six shots right away but Hilson all
[01:52:27] right let me put you down on this
[01:52:30] K4
[01:52:31] K4 oh you got one of the best ones in
[01:52:34] the
[01:52:34] game G3 this is the best melee weapon
[01:52:39] you can get you got
[01:52:40] yourself a

[01:52:46] f plus five on your
[01:52:49] melee nice one there Hilson has a sword
[01:52:53] like
[01:52:55] it one sword that was good pickup there

[01:53:02] hideous laughter for
[01:53:12] you where is the Tasha's hideous
[01:53:15] laughter if it's not in here it might be

[01:56:00] the side as you uh hold your your plasma
[01:56:06] rifle there let make this a little bit
[01:56:08] bigger you holding that plasma rifle you
[01:56:10] go I think you may want to move the side
[01:56:12] that Raider looks at you goes and starts
[01:56:15] chuckling and shoots oh no he just
[01:56:18] shoots at you instead now being that he
[01:56:21] shot at you you have a choice are you
[01:56:23] going to uh shoot back and see if you

[01:56:40] dodge oh like you got an 18 you dodge
[01:56:42] him Dodge him now what are you gonna do
[01:56:44] now you got a couple options you get two
[01:56:47] more chances of what you'd like to do
[01:56:48] here you're able to dodge because you
[01:56:50] got 18
[01:56:52] you run for the car are you dodge you're

[01:57:26] shoulder he is only a 25 health and you
[01:57:30] drop that small Raider from 25 Health

[02:03:16] or higher so you shoot and you're aiming
[02:03:18] towards his feet and you get oh no you
[02:03:20] only get two that feral ghoul comes

[02:06:24] beautiful all right we're going to
[02:06:25] switch out our dice yesterday we had to
[02:06:27] switch our dice out when we went to the
[02:06:29] purple one it seem like got a little
[02:06:30] better luck all right we'll switch our
[02:06:31] dice out right there all right here we
[02:06:33] go now what are you going to do our
[02:06:37] buddy Hill you got a couple more options
[02:06:38] here you have two more chances before
[02:06:40] either you Retreat or they have to
[02:06:42] retreat or they
[02:06:43] die what are you going to do you have a
[02:06:45] ranged weapon he's on the other side of
[02:06:48] you right now you both have slice slices
[02:06:50] on your sides though from that uh that
[02:06:52] mean mean feral ghoul that had taken you
[02:06:55] out a
[02:07:00] bit plasma all right oh yeah here we go
[02:07:04] rolling that we're going to have we have
[02:07:06] to have 13 or
[02:07:07] bigger oh you got 17 17 there you go you
[02:07:11] hit him you hit him I like it you shoot
[02:07:15] his feet again and that feral ghoul his
[02:07:18] feet disintegrate and he starts crawling
[02:07:21] with his hands towards you cuz he's a
[02:07:23] feral ghoul he doesn't feel that pain
[02:07:25] but it does bring him from 40 Health
[02:07:27] down to 25 health so that was a good hit
[02:07:32] on that one he's crawling around it's
[02:07:34] harder for him to get to you it's easier
[02:07:35] for you to dodge that's good that's good
[02:07:38] now K4 what do you want to do my
[02:07:40] friend you want to continue on you want

[02:08:07] else K4 comes in
[02:08:12] with a health pack oh look at that
[02:08:14] health pack oh I think Razer can needle
[02:08:16] head was already pulled actually I think

[02:08:19] might not have a health pack you might
[02:08:21] have to go want to something different
[02:08:22] Razer kin needle head 347 I think that

[02:08:32] because it's just the box from yesterday

[02:11:06] Health you just got yourself an agility
[02:11:09] booster which means you can dodge things
[02:11:10] a little easier now so what are you
[02:11:13] going to do my friend monster are you
[02:11:15] going to attack you going to continue
[02:11:17] what are you going to do oh we're going
[02:11:18] to do another boost let's run another
[02:11:20] booster let's see what we are we going
[02:11:21] to get another boost of some kind to you
[02:11:24] now remember everybody I'm only allowing
[02:11:26] five boosts per each thing so you can
[02:11:28] only have five plus on AG agility five
[02:11:31] plus for strength once you get up to
[02:11:33] that point you can't get any more but
[02:11:35] you can still get packs and stuff like
[02:11:36] that Health packs so I'll just switch it
[02:11:38] out for like a health pack or something
[02:11:39] like
[02:11:42] that all right but we haven't had any
[02:11:45] character get up that high yet so we'll
[02:11:46] see what happens we have an engineering
[02:11:48] booster and a Kona rescue be
[02:12:01] Bey put J with K by accident let me fix
[02:12:06] that Kona rescue
[02:12:10] beasy I do believe I have those Kona
[02:12:13] rescue beasy 358 there you go and you
[02:12:16] also get an engineering
[02:12:17] booster so your character has been
[02:12:19] boosted with their engineering skills
[02:12:23] you now have an engineering booster with
[02:12:25] your coner rescue beasy you're going to
[02:12:28] use the Boost all right here we go now
[02:12:31] plus one
[02:12:35] engineering now remember when you have
[02:12:37] the plus one on the engineering what
[02:12:38] that means is that you can easily get
[02:12:41] into like say there's a safe and a side
[02:12:43] quest it helps you get into those easier
[02:12:45] it gives you a little plus added to that
[02:12:47] or that's kind of goes with luck too or
[02:12:49] maybe you need to break through a door
[02:12:51] that type of thing it'll help you get
[02:12:52] through those all
[02:12:54] right now you have your car your feral
[02:12:57] ghouls getting P mad he's crawling
[02:12:58] towards you and he's gotten towards you
[02:13:00] now he finally thinks he's going to
[02:13:01] swipe at you he's getting ready to swipe
[02:13:03] at you what are you going to do you
[02:13:05] going to you going to try to dodge let's
[02:13:07] blast him in the face all right you have
[02:13:09] that plus five that means you need 13 or
[02:13:13] more you got 14 oh look at that you hit
[02:13:16] him directly in the face as he's
[02:13:17] crawling towards you you shoot him and
[02:13:20] go with with your plasma oh with your
[02:13:23] plasma rifle and that plasma rifle

[02:24:55] of the legs and when you hit him you hit
[02:24:57] the other side directly in front of him
[02:24:59] and he just melts to the ground and you
[02:25:02] have another pile of Ashes to go and
[02:25:06] loot so you go over to that bug to loot
[02:25:11] them and this time the bug is a small
[02:25:14] bug so you don't get much on it he only
[02:25:16] has two
[02:25:18] pogs is what you get from your small bug
[02:25:21] there but there's something interesting
[02:25:24] you see when you're looking at that
[02:25:26] small bug huh you notice this side
[02:25:30] there's a crack in the wall and you look
[02:25:32] over and you see a safe in the
[02:25:35] crack well my friend you've been playing
[02:25:38] for a little
[02:25:39] bit what do you think you're going to do
[02:25:41] do you want to try to go into look at
[02:25:42] that
[02:25:43] safe we're going to give you an
[02:25:45] opportunity here
[02:25:47] now CU you've played a couple of rounds
[02:25:49] we like to throw a little extra in for
[02:25:51] you yeah let's check it out so you go
[02:25:52] over there you'll wander that eventually
[02:25:55] looks in and goes H now with the small
[02:25:57] safe you have to roll um 15 or higher
[02:26:01] but because you have an engineering no
[02:26:03] 13 or higher on small safe but because
[02:26:05] you have engineering get a plus one
[02:26:07] which helps with that so it's actually
[02:26:09] 12 or higher now you're only going to
[02:26:11] get three chances to do it the first
[02:26:15] chance if you don't get it you have to
[02:26:18] decide if you want to do it again
[02:26:19] because the second time time it's either
[02:26:21] if it be you can it'll start to crack
[02:26:23] and break and you might not get
[02:26:25] everything in it the third time if you
[02:26:26] don't get it it locks and it'll blow up
[02:26:29] so you have to worry about it it's booby
[02:26:30] trapped so we're going to roll and we
[02:26:33] have to get you a 12 or bigger oh no we
[02:26:38] got an
[02:26:40] eight we have an eight so with an
[02:26:47] eight no it is not a mimic that's true
[02:26:50] that's true with an eight what are we
[02:26:53] going to do want to try one more
[02:26:56] time or do you want to leave the safe
[02:26:58] there and maybe no we're going to roll
[02:27:01] again oh we got 14 there you go 14 it is
[02:27:06] that
[02:27:07] safe cracks
[02:27:09] open and
[02:27:11] inside you
[02:27:13] find four rounds of plasma
[02:27:16] ammo look at that one four rounds of

[03:02:28] now dead you go over to that Raider and
[03:02:32] you look at him and you find an
[03:02:36] axe on the ground but the axe is only
[03:02:39] going to have one or two swings and then
[03:02:40] it's going to break all right because
[03:02:42] it's already in the pr being broken and
[03:02:45] then you have one 2 three 4 four five
[03:02:49] six pogs for your Wasteland currency you
[03:02:52] find on them so it's up to you guys what
[03:02:54] are you going to do who's going to take
[03:02:55] the ax and who's going to take some of
[03:02:57] the pogs are you going to split the pogs
[03:02:58] are they going to go to one
[03:03:01] person what's going on
[03:03:04] here you are working together a little
[03:03:07] Co-op so we're going to decide what are
[03:03:09] you going to do in your little Co-op
[03:03:12] here it's looting time you got yourself
[03:03:16] a nice one there that was not bad you
[03:03:17] got a little axe but you only get a
[03:03:19] couple you get a couple of Swings with
[03:03:20] the axe but the thing is the axe is a
[03:03:23] plus
[03:03:24] six you swing at Nico
[03:03:28] oh oh no you picked the axe up oh we're
[03:03:32] going Carnage wise okay we're gonna hold
[03:03:35] hold on hold on hold on let's get it out
[03:03:38] here we swing at
[03:03:40] Nico Nico now this a a 50/50 to dodge
[03:03:43] and it is a uh we'll see I don't know
[03:03:45] what do we have to I've never done that
[03:03:46] on oh my haven't thought about the hit
[03:03:49] points for you
[03:03:51] guys I'd say it has to be 15 or more to
[03:03:54] hit one of you we'll say 15 or more to
[03:03:57] hit and 10 or more to dodge like 5050 so
[03:04:01] you you going to try oh you miss anyways
[03:04:04] and he
[03:04:05] Dodges you miss anyways
[03:04:07] profet you swing with the axe and you
[03:04:10] miss now Nico do you want to do you want
[03:04:12] to attack back or you want to try to uh
[03:04:14] be befriend him what do you want to do
[03:04:16] here
[03:04:18] he tried to take everything he picked up
[03:04:19] the axe and wanted to take all of it
[03:04:21] because that's
[03:04:29] mine I mean it's up to profit and you
[03:04:31] what you guys are going to do and then
[03:04:32] profit we still have your packs to open
[03:04:34] when you want to get to
[03:04:37] it you got to find it out I guess so all
[03:04:40] right Nico so he just swung at you with
[03:04:44] the axe you have two knives in your hand
[03:04:47] all right you're going to swing back at
[03:04:49] him and then profit is gonna try to
[03:04:50] dodge that's what gonna happen all right
[03:04:53] we have oh a 10 that means you missed
[03:04:56] you missed anyways you needed a 15 or
[03:04:58] higher to get them you missed I'm going
[03:05:00] to give you guys each three chances to
[03:05:02] fight each other so you're down to two
[03:05:04] are you g to keep going we're keep going
[03:05:06] it sounds like profet wants to try again
[03:05:08] and profit you got a 10 you missed so
[03:05:14] Nico we're going to go again Nico gets
[03:05:16] oh Nico gets 15 Nico hits for the first
[03:05:20] one tries to hit we're going to see if
[03:05:21] we can get a
[03:05:22] Dodge oh and you dodged because you got
[03:05:24] over 10 all right so the two of you have
[03:05:27] been swinging and dodging jumping away
[03:05:29] from each other swinging at the nice
[03:05:31] swinging those axes around now going to
[03:05:33] go one more that is oh 19 19 profit you
[03:05:39] swing with that axe all right let's see
[03:05:41] if you hit let's see if you hit oh you
[03:05:45] do not get the Dodge there k for he hits
[03:05:48] you with that axe he hits you with the
[03:05:52] axe Nico that axe brings you down to
[03:05:57] 66 Health that was a big hit ouch all
[03:06:01] right Nico you got one chance left and
[03:06:02] then the guys have to dispar and run
[03:06:05] away we'll see who gets
[03:06:09] everything we roll up roll cuz it was
[03:06:12] stay on screen roll it's a seven you
[03:06:15] miss you miss oh no it doesn't do
[03:06:20] anything the axe breaks after two swing
[03:06:23] hits you have to hit something twice so
[03:06:25] hit the first one it misses so now it
[03:06:27] only has one hit
[03:06:30] left but we have done our
[03:06:34] three now because profit hit him and one
[03:06:39] and took some damage away from Nico Nico

[03:15:15] e e
[03:16:09] all right I'm
[03:16:10] back seems like no one wants to jump in

[03:16:16] maybe I'll throw some singles on
[03:16:19] here not
[03:16:21] sure we had this is normally the day we
[03:16:24] do our um wheel of magic but no one
[03:16:26] wanted to play Wheel of magic earlier so
[03:16:28] that's why we went into the we were
[03:16:29] doing the adventure game a little bit we
[03:16:32] would like to we can get wheel magic
[03:16:33] back off on
[03:16:35] here but right now we're just going to
[03:16:37] do a giveaway try that out and then I
[03:16:39] think what I'll do here is
[03:16:44] um slow day don't have much to open
[03:16:48] because we literally just don't have
[03:16:50] much to open because we're waiting for
[03:16:51] the new product to show and I don't want
[03:16:54] to keep opening all this stuff that I
[03:16:55] have here because I don't have nothing
[03:16:56] for you guys so what we'll do is hey
[03:17:00] saso how's it going my
[03:17:02] friend um I think what I'm going to do
[03:17:05] here is we'll try one more little uh
[03:17:08] giveaway after this hang out for minute
[03:17:11] longer monster thank you buddy thank you
[03:17:15] thank you there you go number between 1
[03:17:17] and 10
[03:17:18] monster 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 a number
[03:17:23] between 1 and
[03:17:25] 10 one two three four five six is a
[03:17:30] croan tusker all right not a giant hit
[03:17:32] but it gets you a discount on
[03:17:34] shipping
[03:17:37] monster
[03:17:39] brisket all right now I got a question
[03:17:42] for you all so you those of you that are
[03:17:45] hanging out here my thought here is
[03:17:49] um I will make a different kind of box
[03:17:53] that's set up similarly to these
[03:17:55] ones but it will only be a
[03:17:58] dollar and it's mainly just for those of
[03:18:01] you that want to kind of play the game
[03:18:03] if that makes any sense you just pay a
[03:18:05] dollar and you can become the character
[03:18:10] and whatever is on the card will be what
[03:18:12] you're um fighting against and it's just
[03:18:15] mainly for those people that want to
[03:18:16] play the game don't really care about
[03:18:18] the pack or whatever they're getting or
[03:18:20] getting a pack they just want to play
[03:18:21] the D and D type game is that a good
[03:18:23] idea for you guys what do you what do
[03:18:24] you
[03:18:25] think I don't know I'm trying to I was
[03:18:27] just I know some people like to just
[03:18:28] play it a little bit and that's why I
[03:18:29] was yeah oh thank you all right so like
[03:18:32] my thought was like so for instance I
[03:18:35] have this box here already of like extra
[03:18:37] cards I'd count out make sure how many
[03:18:39] are in here and what I would do is do
[03:18:41] the same thing as this with the stickers
[03:18:42] on them and everything this would just
[03:18:43] be box number five but the only
[03:18:45] difference is it would be a dollar and
[03:18:47] it would be mainly so you can play the
[03:18:48] game yes you build your own characters
[03:18:50] and you get to charact you get to bring
[03:18:51] your character stream over stream so you
[03:18:53] can continue with your character as you
[03:18:55] play so you don't ever need to stop and
[03:18:58] what I end up doing is I was thinking
[03:18:59] every two weeks or every month I was
[03:19:01] going to rebuild these boxes here with
[03:19:04] new characters or new adventure items
[03:19:06] like so maybe you're fighting against uh
[03:19:08] maybe you you find a hole that takes you
[03:19:11] uh a uh you know you find a maybe you
[03:19:14] find
[03:19:15] a like uh uh escalator brings you up to
[03:19:18] a different room area or maybe brings
[03:19:21] you out to the up out to the uh
[03:19:22] Wasteland itself maybe find an elevator
[03:19:25] that brings you down all the way down to
[03:19:26] a pit and that's where the new adventure
[03:19:28] brings you for the next season and we
[03:19:29] have a bunch of different characters
[03:19:30] you're going against but you can bring
[03:19:32] your same character along with you as
[03:19:34] you play every single day so every
[03:19:36] morning you can pick up where you left
[03:19:38] off for the most
[03:19:40] part I actually have an Excel sheet that
[03:19:43] I made that has everybody stuff that
[03:19:44] they're doing and it's labeled for the
[03:19:46] days too for all the days that we played
[03:19:48] so we know what everyone was doing so
[03:19:50] yeah kind
[03:19:51] of that was my thought process so I was
[03:19:53] figuring I'd make a box that was like a
[03:19:55] dollar and you guys can just literally
[03:19:57] it's nothing in there but playing the
[03:19:59] character for those of you that want to
[03:20:00] play the character and have some
[03:20:02] fun that's kind of was uh cuz where all
[03:20:05] my thought there no and then maybe St to
[03:20:07] do the same thing with a box for like
[03:20:09] ammo you know like the other one the the
[03:20:11] other pull boxing the virtual ones you
[03:20:15] know I'll do another one and maybe I'll
[03:20:16] bake it as
[03:20:17] um like stickers or something and each
[03:20:20] time you do that you'll get one of my
[03:20:22] stickers I you know what I mean and but
[03:20:24] you'll get an item having to do with the
[03:20:27] game and it's only going to be a dollar
[03:20:29] that way you're you're not spending a
[03:20:30] lot and you get to play the game a
[03:20:31] little I don't know I was just thinking
[03:20:32] about those people that want to just
[03:20:33] play the game but don't
[03:20:35] necessarily have want to buy packs
[03:20:37] continuously or buy Cards continuously
[03:20:40] so I trying to think of that that's
[03:20:42] all I thought it might be a good idea
[03:20:45] for those of you that might want to just
[03:20:46] jump and play a little bit every now and
[03:20:47] again but not necessarily care about
[03:20:49] getting
[03:20:54] anything what do you on YouTube
[03:20:57] pick plus those you on YouTube anyways
[03:20:59] if you become a member you get a certain
[03:21:01] amount of time frame in each show to
[03:21:04] play each
[03:21:07] month so for those of you that might
[03:21:08] want to do it a
[03:21:13] uh do it regularly jump in on a oh who's
[03:21:17] in here right
[03:21:22] now we'll go with we'll do
[03:21:26] that all right yeah I know let me think

[00:06:43] don't have I've had like I had a little
[00:06:44] bit of luck before and it was generally
[00:06:46] pretty bad but I had some good luck
[00:06:48] every now and again now I have no good
[00:06:50] luck but my children have all of it like

[00:19:05] is going to be one strength for your
[00:19:08] character two strength for your
[00:19:09] characters so that's two and a half
[00:19:10] strength and you get your choice of four
[00:19:13] different characters right now all right
[00:19:15] Charlie four characters you get to be a
[00:19:17] technician a mutant a strong human which
[00:19:21] is like a defender or a um detective
[00:19:25] human strong mutant or a
[00:19:28] um hold on a second my brain just forgot

[00:19:36] was detec mutant technician strong human
[00:19:39] or detective thank you detective those
[00:19:42] are your choices all right and now with
[00:19:45] those they have plus or minus strength
[00:19:47] or something depending on what you pull
[00:19:48] out of the blocks there so what do you
[00:19:49] want to you want to be for your
[00:19:50] character as you travel through the
[00:19:52] Wasteland here I'm going to aim aim this
[00:19:55] down a little bit how's that yeah what
[00:19:57] do you want to be
[00:19:59] strong human you're going to be a strong
[00:20:00] human all right so Charlie's going to
[00:20:02] play as a strong human starting out with
[00:20:03] his three strength here now what we're
[00:20:05] going to do is Charlie you're wandering
[00:20:07] through the Wasteland and you go uh oh I
[00:20:10] stumble upon something you pick
[00:20:12] something any one of these red cards out

[00:20:26] camera got a food that help helps you as
[00:20:29] a strong human that gets you food so you
[00:20:31] get to get a plus one so that goes from
[00:20:34] one two three to three and a half right
[00:20:38] so you are now at three and a half
[00:20:39] strength for your character wandering
[00:20:41] through the Wasteland the mutant is w i
[00:20:43] mean the strong human is wandering

[00:22:52] problems and that Velociraptor goes
[00:22:54] scampering away crying look at this if
[00:22:57] this was you guys playing you would have

[00:40:34] here
[00:40:39] over I'm moving around a little bit be
[00:40:42] right back it's right over
[00:40:55] here
[00:41:03] that's all right so we have how many
[00:41:07] play

[00:41:17] play booster left I have to adjust my uh
[00:41:20] stock if it says something
[00:41:23] different LCI draft all right that works
[00:41:26] now C draft and that we'll do that for

[00:41:35] that one there yep and I'm going to get
[00:41:37] these cards in the top loaders to
[00:41:38] protect it and this is how we're going
[00:41:40] to start our game off here on our
[00:41:42] adventure now with our adventure uh if
[00:41:45] you happen to lose against the boss you
[00:41:47] do have the option of having any um
[00:41:50] we'll get you a art card we'll have be
[00:41:52] sent to you with a little picture drawn
[00:41:54] on it saying thank you
[00:41:56] for hanging out with us and playing the
[00:41:58] game as your um in case you do not
[00:42:01] happen to win against the boss so you do
[00:42:02] come away with something every single
[00:42:05] time I don't know uh there was a
[00:42:07] complaint I guess about something so I
[00:42:09] had to make an adjustment I didn't know
[00:42:11] I figured uh since everybody was getting
[00:42:13] the packs they got paid for that there
[00:42:15] would be no problem
[00:42:17] here so here we go I'm G to get that up
[00:42:19] there for you Mike give me one second to
[00:42:21] get these in
[00:42:22] here and I'll get that right up for you
[00:42:28] [Music]
[00:42:30] we cannot have you open them because
[00:42:32] they don't allow us to do that for some
[00:42:33] reason I don't know why you have to
[00:42:35] either be an employee or a
[00:42:38] um or a uh adult of some kind and you
[00:42:42] have being the not an adult and you're
[00:42:44] not employee because you can't be an
[00:42:46] employee when you're not an adult they
[00:42:48] don't allow that happen sadly I've said
[00:42:50] before but there are uh we do have ways
[00:42:52] around it if people are okay with it we
[00:42:54] can always have we can always cut the
[00:42:55] pack open at the top and you can take it
[00:42:57] out and read it if someone was okay with
[00:42:59] that but that's up to those people
[00:43:01] that's not me because that is that
[00:43:02] person's Choice we'll do that
[00:43:06] here wait what was the problem so like
[00:43:10] um when U for some reason you
[00:43:13] can't as a as a
[00:43:16] um streamer if you have a child they are
[00:43:19] not allowed to rip open packs if even if
[00:43:22] somebody says so so the only way
[00:43:23] somebody found a way around that there
[00:43:25] you go smokey
[00:43:26] was somebody had said how about we uh he
[00:43:29] doesn't rip it open you cut the pack
[00:43:31] open and then you will be able to uh
[00:43:34] then you're you're cutting it open and
[00:43:36] he's not the one opening it I was like
[00:43:37] all right well that kind of works so we
[00:43:39] ended up doing
[00:43:41] that so here we go I'm GNA put this up
[00:43:43] for your
[00:43:49] Mike all right so these are going to be
[00:43:52] for your adventure to start your
[00:43:55] adventure
[00:44:03] that's dumb tell them to put it
[00:44:05] somewhere I know I know I know I thought
[00:44:08] it was stupid too but hey that's why we
[00:44:10] found the other way around it which was
[00:44:11] like cutting it open so here you go Mike
[00:44:14] start that there make sure it only goes
[00:44:15] 30 seconds not a long time so there you
[00:44:18] go that's yours to start your adventure
[00:44:19] with there we're going to put away mine
[00:44:22] our cards there that we got here earlier
[00:44:24] those are going to go right here so we
[00:44:26] did get some luck with those ones do you
[00:44:27] mind putting those away for me actually
[00:44:29] I'm G to keep this one this one needs to
[00:44:31] stay here there we go Mike Mike coming
[00:44:33] in with some luck here I mean if you
[00:44:36] want I can do that too for you and just
[00:44:37] have him open them that way that's up to
[00:44:39] you it's always your choice so those are
[00:44:42] yours you're starting out with one two
[00:44:44] strength on your
[00:44:47] adventure they try to run all MTG
[00:44:51] off I guess so sometimes I feel like um
[00:44:54] some of the things they do is like they
[00:44:56] make it like more of a pain but um
[00:44:58] whatever that's why I do the YouTube
[00:45:00] thing so that the kids can open stuff by
[00:45:01] themselves regularly that's what's
[00:45:03] actually like the main reason for
[00:45:04] starting this you
[00:45:07] know well I'm sorry you have to deal
[00:45:09] with that you're onun a Hess fun you let
[00:45:12] him open that if Wills around you let
[00:45:15] him open you let him open them if Will's
[00:45:18] around you know what I can do that you
[00:45:19] know I have no problem doing that that
[00:45:21] way the um like I said as long as you
[00:45:23] guys are okay with it no one Minds here
[00:45:26] we actually have fun doing that so what
[00:45:29] we can do Mike you get one
[00:45:31] two points to start your adventure with
[00:45:34] all right and then what we'll do is um

[01:12:39] with one two and a half points or
[01:12:42] strength on your adventure in the
[01:12:44] Wasteland I'm going to start that here

[01:12:55] and that is going to
[01:12:57] be start your off on the
[01:13:00] adventure if you
[01:13:02] want and there you are now you guys can
[01:13:05] always pick your own remember at the top
[01:13:06] it tells you what it is there but not a
[01:13:09] clue likes these picks from Charlie for
[01:13:11] the adventure here we go not a
[01:13:16] clue yep we think these ones will get
[01:13:19] some look right is this where we're
[01:13:20] going to pull our mock out of one of
[01:13:21] these finally cuz we waiting to pull a
[01:13:24] MOX out and have not had that chance
[01:13:27] yet maybe this is when it happens not a
[01:13:31] clue we'll find
[01:13:34] out all right not a clue you're going on
[01:13:36] an adventure in the Wasteland here you
[01:13:39] have one two and a half strength for
[01:13:42] your character what is your character
[01:13:44] going to be though is your character
[01:13:46] going to be a strong human a mutant a
[01:13:50] detective or a technician in this ADV
[01:13:53] Adventure in the Wasteland not a
[01:13:57] clue and remember this adventure in the
[01:13:59] Wasteland is always a free extra game to
[01:14:01] play you do not need to play it you can
[01:14:03] say I don't want to but most of the time
[01:14:05] people like to that's why we do
[01:14:11] it not a clue did I lose you for a sec
[01:14:14] or did I lose uh is it me that's losing
[01:14:16] things talk me through it real quick
[01:14:18] please all right so you pick one of
[01:14:20] those four characters um and they have
[01:14:23] Plus or minuses if you look in the notes
[01:14:25] it'll show you the Plus or minuses per
[01:14:27] the character like their strength if
[01:14:28] they get a say you were a strong human
[01:14:30] you'd be wandering through the Wasteland
[01:14:31] in this box here you look for something
[01:14:33] that's a plus or minus one and if you
[01:14:35] pull out uh food as a strong human
[01:14:37] that's going to be plus one because
[01:14:39] humans strong humans want food but if
[01:14:40] you pull out treasure they don't know
[01:14:41] what a treasure is they drop it they run
[01:14:43] away Mak a minus one but if you go
[01:14:45] through here there's maybe adventurers
[01:14:46] or friends that you find that could be a
[01:14:48] plus one minus one similar to this to
[01:14:50] get you strength and same thing on this
[01:14:53] last last one here this blue side is a
[01:14:55] plus one minus one and then what happens
[01:14:57] is depending on how many points you get
[01:14:59] or strength you get so say you get plus
[01:15:01] one plus one and plus one that would
[01:15:04] make this character one two three four
[01:15:07] five and a half on your strength and you
[01:15:09] would be going against one of these 10
[01:15:11] bosses with five and a half strength so
[01:15:13] what you do is you p through and you be
[01:15:15] like all right I'm G to pick out number
[01:15:17] uh number one here this one here and you
[01:15:19] oh no you went up against galta and you
[01:15:20] lost but there you go not a clue
[01:15:22] understands it now
[01:15:23] there we go we're going to go with a
[01:15:26] technician all right as this technician
[01:15:28] wanders through the Wasteland they are
[01:15:30] looking for Treasure to help them along
[01:15:33] the way now you can have me pick random
[01:15:36] Charlie could pick one for you uh you
[01:15:38] could tell me a number where you want to
[01:15:39] go not a clue it's up to you on your
[01:15:41] adventure through the Wasteland what you

[01:15:55] happens
[01:15:56] here Charlie's grabbing out
[01:16:00] it here we go oh got a food food the
[01:16:05] food is not helpful on the technician
[01:16:07] because the technician looks for
[01:16:09] treasure that they can sell or they can
[01:16:11] make into something so you are now at
[01:16:15] one and a half strength I am sorry not a
[01:16:18] clue you're at one and a half strength
[01:16:20] at the moment but that's okay as you
[01:16:22] wanded through the way and you can
[01:16:23] actually bump into some friends or maybe

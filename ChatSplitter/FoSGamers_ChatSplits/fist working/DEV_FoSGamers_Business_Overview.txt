Implementing a check-in system can encourage viewers to interact regularly, fostering a sense of community.

#### **4.1 Overview of the Check-In System**

- **Purpose**: Viewers use a command to "check-in," earning points or acknowledgments.
- **Usage**: Viewers type `!checkin` in chat.
- **Response**: Bot confirms their check-in and possibly updates a leaderboard.

#### **4.2 Setting Up a Check-In Command**

1. **Create an Action**:

   - **Name**: `CheckInAction`.

2. **Add Sub-Actions**:

   - **Sub-Action 1**: **Logic** > **If** > **Logic Condition**.
     - **Condition**: Check if the user has already checked in today.
     - Since Streamer.bot doesn't have built-in variables for this, we'll use the **`User`** attribute system.

   - **Sub-Action 2**: **Logic** > **If Condition Is False**, proceed to check them in.

   - **Sub-Action 3**: **Actions** > **Set User Attribute**.
     - **Attribute Name**: `CheckedInToday`
     - **Value**: `True`
     - **Expiration**: Set to expire in `24 hours` (or at midnight).

   - **Sub-Action 4**: **Twitch** > **Send Message**.
     - **Message**: `Thank you for checking in, $user.displayName!`

   - **Sub-Action 5**: **Add Points or Update Leaderboard** (Optional).
     - If you're using a point system, increment their points.
     - This may require additional configuration or an external system.

3. **Create the Command**:

   - **Name**: `!checkin`.
   - **Action**: `CheckInAction`.
   - **Permission**: `Everyone`.

#### **4.3 Implementing a User Attribute System**

Since Streamer.bot allows you to store custom attributes for users, we can use this feature to track check-ins.

##### **Setting User Attributes**

- **Set Attribute**:

  - Use the **`Set User Data`** sub-action.
  - **Key**: `CheckedInToday`
  - **Value**: `True`
  - **Expiry**: Set an expiry time (e.g., at midnight).

##### **Checking User Attributes**

- **Check Attribute**:

  - Use the **`If User Data`** condition.
  - **Key**: `CheckedInToday`
  - **Condition**: **Exists**

##### **Example Sub-Actions for Check-In**

1. **If User Data Exists** (`CheckedInToday`):

   - **Then**: Send message: `You have already checked in today, $user.displayName!`

2. **Else**:

   - **Set User Data**: `CheckedInToday` = `True`, expires in 24 hours.
   - **Send Message**: `Thank you for checking in, $user.displayName!`

[2024-10-01 20:33:17] FoSGamers:
knowledge to make what I want and need. Here’s an **extensive breakdown** of all the possible things you can do using the **Custom Commands extension** in **Streamer.bot**:

### **1. Adding Commands with Detailed Responses**:
The basic function is to add a command that triggers a response in the chat. Example:
```plaintext
!commands add ![command] [response]
```
Example command:
```plaintext
!commands add !price The price of the item is currently $30.
```

### **2. Custom Variables and Dynamic Content**:
Commands can include variables that dynamically change based on input or context:
- **%userName%**: Outputs the name of the user who triggered the command.
- **%channel%**: Outputs the name of the channel.
- **%randomNumber%**: Generates a random number.
- **%time%**: Displays the current time.
  
Example with dynamic variables:
```plaintext
!commands add !greet Welcome, %userName%! You joined us at %time%.
```

### **3. Editing Commands**:
You can modify an existing command's response at any time:
```plaintext
!commands edit ![command] [new response]
```
Example:
```plaintext
!commands edit !price The price has now changed to $35.
```

### **4. Removing Commands**:
To delete a command from the list:
```plaintext
!commands remove ![command]
```
Example:
```plaintext
!commands remove !price
```

### **5. Cooldowns and Permissions**:
- **Cooldown**: Prevents a command from being used repeatedly in a short period.
  ```plaintext
  !commands add !price The price is $25. (Cooldown: 30s)
  ```
- **Permissions**: Restrict a command to certain users, such as **Mods** or **Subscribers**.
  ```plaintext
  !commands add !modCommand This is a special command for mods only. (Permissions: Mods)
  ```

### **6. Listing All Commands**:
To list all the available commands, type:
```plaintext
!commands
```
This shows all active commands within the chat.

### **7. Random Responses**:
You can create commands that randomly select from different responses, which is useful for games, random events, or rolling dice:
```plaintext
!commands add !roll Rolling dice... %randomNumber% between 1 and 6.
```
You can customize the range of numbers generated to fit your needs (e.g., `1 to 100` for larger ranges).

### **8. Aliases**:
Aliases allow you to create different names for the same command. This is useful if you want multiple triggers for the same action.
```plaintext
!commands alias !shop !store
```
Typing either `!shop` or `!store` will output the same response.

### **9. Timed Messages (Repeated Commands)**:
You can set commands to automatically run at regular intervals in chat:
- Use **Timed Messages** to remind viewers to follow, join a giveaway, or check out links.
  
Example:
```plaintext
!commands add !reminder Don’t forget to follow the channel for updates! (Repeated: every 15 minutes)
```

### **10. Math-Based Commands**:
You can integrate math calculations into commands:
```plaintext
!commands add !multiply 5 * 5 equals %result%
```
For more advanced interactions like dice rolls:
```plaintext
!commands add !dice Roll a dice: %randomNumber% between 1 and 6.
```

### **11. Polls and Voting**:
You can create simple polls for viewers to interact with:
```plaintext
!commands add !vote Type 1 for "Yes", 2 for "No".
```
Streamer.bot can tally responses from users to determine the outcome of votes.

### **12. Checkpoints and Progress-Based Commands**:
For adventure games or milestone-based interaction, you can use commands to track progress:
- Example for role-playing:
  ```plaintext
  !commands add !quest You have started your journey! Type !nextstep to continue.
  ```

### **13. Inventory and Item Drops**:
Commands that trigger item drops or track an inventory can be handled through **Streamer.bot**:
```plaintext
!commands add !loot You found a magic sword! Add to your inventory? (Type Yes or No)
```

### **14. Game Integration**:
You can create mini-games or simple random events in chat. For example:
- **Random Battle**:
  ```plaintext
  !commands add !fight You engage in a battle! Roll to attack: %randomNumber% between 1 and 10.
  ```
- **Treasure Hunt**:
  ```plaintext
  !commands add !treasure You found a hidden treasure! It contains %randomNumber% gold.
  ```

### **15. Feedback and Suggestions**:
You can set up feedback or suggestion commands for your viewers:
```plaintext
!commands add !suggestion Please submit your suggestions here: [link to a form or Discord].
```

---

### **Full Setup Example**:
Let’s say you want to build a custom command for a simple dice roll game and a price checker, with permission settings for mods and cooldowns to prevent spamming.

1. **Dice Roll Command**:
   ```plaintext
   !commands add !roll Rolling a dice... You rolled a %randomNumber% between 1 and 6. (Cooldown: 10s)
   ```
   - This rolls a random number between 1 and 6, with a 10-second cooldown to avoid spam.

2. **Price Checker Command**:
   ```plaintext
   !commands add !price The current price for the card is $25. (Permissions: Mods)
   ```
   - This is a simple price-checking command restricted to moderators.

3. **Adventure Game Command**:
   ```plaintext
   !commands add !explore You ventured into the cave. Roll to see what happens: %randomNumber% between 1 and 20.
   ```

---

### **Advanced Features**:
- **If Statements**: You can create conditional logic based on certain criteria, such as user roles or values.
- **API Integration**: Commands can be set up to pull data from external APIs, such as weather or live statistics.

---

With **Streamer.bot's Custom Commands Extension**, you can automate and customize chat interactions to suit your stream’s needs, making your streams more interactive and fun for viewers. If you need more complex setups, like multi-step adventures or progression-based commands, just let me know!

Here are the **advanced features** of **Streamer.bot's Custom Commands Extension** explained in full detail:

---

### **1. Variables and Dynamic Placeholders**:
Variables allow for dynamic responses within commands. These placeholders can change based on user input or other conditions.
- **%userName%**: Displays the name of the user who triggered the command.
- **%channel%**: Displays the name of the current channel.
- **%randomNumber%**: Generates a random number within a specified range.
- **%time%**: Displays the current time.
  
**Example:**
```plaintext
!commands add !greet Welcome, %userName%! You joined us at %time%.
```
This command would greet the user with their username and display the time they joined the stream.

### **2. Math and Randomization**:
You can use **Math operations** and **Random Number Generation** to build commands that involve calculations or randomness (such as dice rolls).
  
**Random Number Generation Example**:
```plaintext
!commands add !roll Rolling a dice... You rolled a %randomNumber% between 1 and 6.
```
This creates a simple dice roll where a random number between 1 and 6 is generated each time the command is used.

### **3. Cooldowns and User Permissions**:
You can prevent commands from being spammed by adding **cooldowns** or restricting them to specific user groups, such as moderators, subscribers, or VIPs.

- **Cooldown**: The amount of time before the command can be used again.
  ```plaintext
  !commands add !price The current price is $25. (Cooldown: 30s)
  ```
- **Permissions**: Set which users can use the command (e.g., Mods, Subscribers).
  ```plaintext
  !commands add !modCommand Only mods can use this command. (Permissions: Moderator)
  ```

### **4. Conditional Logic and If Statements**:
**Conditional Logic** allows you to add advanced behavior by setting up different outcomes depending on certain conditions. **If Statements** check for conditions and trigger different actions based on the result.

For example:
```plaintext
If [condition] then [action]
```
A command can check if a user is a moderator or subscriber and respond differently:
```plaintext
If %isMod% then "Thanks for being a mod, %userName%" else "Welcome, %userName%"
```

### **5. Command Aliases**:
Aliases allow you to set multiple trigger words that call the same command or response. This is helpful if you want different versions of the same command, but with different names.

**Example**:
```plaintext
!commands alias !shop !store
```
Now, both `!shop` and `!store` will trigger the same response.

### **6. Multi-Step and Multi-Choice Commands**:
You can set up commands that simulate multi-step processes or give users multiple choices, such as in RPG games or decision-making scenarios. The response can vary based on the user’s choices.

For example, in an adventure game, you can ask users to choose their path:
```plaintext
!commands add !explore You ventured into the cave. Type !fight or !flee to choose your next action.
```
This type of command can prompt users to interact with multiple outcomes depending on their input.

### **7. Polls and Voting Commands**:
You can create **Polls** or **Voting Commands** that let users cast their votes or participate in decisions during your stream.

Example:
```plaintext
!commands add !vote Type 1 for 'Option A' or 2 for 'Option B' to cast your vote.
```
With this command, viewers can vote on something, and you can tally the results manually or via external scripts.

### **8. Timed Messages (Repeated Commands)**:
You can set commands to repeat automatically after a specified interval. This is helpful for reminding viewers about important information like subscribing or following.

**Example**:
```plaintext
!commands add !reminder Don't forget to follow! (Repeated: every 15 minutes)
```
This command will trigger every 15 minutes, reminding viewers to follow.

### **9. API Integration**:
With **API Integration**, you can pull live data from external sources such as weather, stock prices, or gaming statistics and display them in chat when a command is used.

For example, to fetch live data:
```plaintext
!commands add !weather The current temperature is %fetchFromAPI[weatherAPI]%
```
This would retrieve live weather data using an API service.

### **10. Advanced Randomization and Weighted Responses**:
You can create **Weighted Responses** where certain outcomes are more likely than others, useful for RPG mechanics, loot drops, or mini-games.

**Example**:
```plaintext
!commands add !loot You found %randomItem% (chance of rare items is higher).
```
You could configure the backend to have a higher probability of dropping common items than rare ones.

---

### **Putting It All Together: An Advanced RPG Command Example**

Here’s an example of how you could use all these features to build a simple **RPG Adventure Command**:

1. **Command**: `!explore`
2. **Response**: Randomized outcome with multiple choices.
```plaintext
!commands add !explore You explore the cave and encounter a dangerous enemy! Roll to attack: %randomNumber% between 1 and 20. Type !fight or !flee to decide your next move.
```

3. **Follow-Up Commands**:
   - If the user types `!fight`:
     ```plaintext
     !commands add !fight You attack the enemy and deal %randomNumber% damage! If successful, type !loot to see what you find.
     ```
   - If the user types `!flee`:
     ```plaintext
     !commands add !flee You narrowly escape! Rest and recover your HP.
     ```

4. **Randomized Loot**:
   ```plaintext
   !commands add !loot You found a %randomItem%! (Weighted chance of rare items).
   ```

5. **API Integration for Game Stats**:
   - If the game is connected to external data (e.g., live scores, game info), you could use an API to pull real-time data:
   ```plaintext
   !commands add !stats The current game score is %fetchFromAPI[gameStatsAPI]%
   ```

The Custom Commands extension allows you to add, edit, and manage commands directly through chat, making it easier to create and modify commands on the fly.

### **1. Enabling the Custom Commands Extension**

Before you begin, ensure that the Custom Commands extension is enabled in Streamer.bot.

1. **Open Streamer.bot**.
2. Navigate to **`Extensions`** in the left panel.
3. Find **`Custom Commands`** in the list of available extensions.
4. Enable it by checking the box next to it or clicking **`Enable`**.

---

### **2. Adding Informational Commands via Chat**

You can add commands directly through your chat by typing specific syntax.

#### **Example Command: `!shop`**

**In Chat:**

```plaintext
!commands add !shop Check out our shop at https://yourshoplink.com
```

This command adds `!shop` to your bot, which responds with the message when a viewer types `!shop`.

**Notes:**

- The command starts with `!commands add`.
- `!shop` is the command trigger.
- The message after the command is the response the bot will give.

**Repeat this process** for other informational commands like `!socials`, `!price`, etc.

---

### **3. Using Variables and Dynamic Content**

Leverage variables to personalize responses.

#### **Example Command: `!greet`**

**In Chat:**

```plaintext
!commands add !greet Welcome, %userName%! Thanks for joining us.
```

When a viewer types `!greet`, the bot will respond with a personalized greeting using their username.

---

### **4. Implementing a Check-In System**

Encourage viewer engagement by allowing them to check in.

#### **Adding the `!checkin` Command**

**In Chat:**

```plaintext
!commands add !checkin You have successfully checked in, %userName%! (Cooldown: 24h)
```

**Setting a Cooldown:**

Since we can't set a cooldown directly via chat with the Custom Commands extension, we'll need to adjust this in Streamer.bot.

**In Streamer.bot:**

1. Go to **`Commands`**.
2. Find the `!checkin` command.
3. Set the **User Cooldown** to `86400` seconds (24 hours).
4. Save the command.

**Notes:**

- This prevents users from checking in more than once every 24 hours.
- The message confirms their check-in.

---

### **5. Creating an RPG Adventure Game**

Develop an interactive RPG experience using chat commands and randomization.

#### **Command: `!adventure`**

**In Chat:**

```plaintext
!commands add !adventure You embark on a daring adventure, %userName%! Type !explore to see what you find.
```

#### **Command: `!explore`**

Since we need random outcomes, we'll use the `%randomNumber%` variable.

**In Chat:**

```plaintext
!commands add !explore %userName%, you venture forth. Rolling for outcome... You rolled a %randomNumber% between 1 and 3.
```

**Handling Outcomes:**

Since the Custom Commands extension doesn't support conditional logic directly via chat, we'll need to create separate commands for each possible outcome.

**Alternative Approach Using Streamer.bot Interface:**

1. **Create an Action** called `AdventureOutcome`.

2. **Add a Sub-Action**:

   - **Type:** `Math > Random Number`
   - **Store Result In:** `RandomOutcome`
   - **Minimum Value:** `1`
   - **Maximum Value:** `3`

3. **Add Conditional Sub-Actions** based on `RandomOutcome`:

   - **If `RandomOutcome` Equals `1`:**

     - **Action:** `Twitch > Send Message`
     - **Message:** `%userName%, you found a treasure chest filled with gold!`

   - **If `RandomOutcome` Equals `2`:**

     - **Action:** `Twitch > Send Message`
     - **Message:** `%userName%, a wild monster appears! Prepare for battle!`

   - **If `RandomOutcome` Equals `3`:**

     - **Action:** `Twitch > Send Message`
     - **Message:** `%userName%, you wander aimlessly and find nothing. Better luck next time!`

4. **Create the Command** in Streamer.bot:

   - **Command:** `!explore`
   - **Action:** `AdventureOutcome`
   - **Permission:** `Everyone`
   - **Cooldown:** Set as desired.

---

### **6. Adding Inventory and Progress Tracking**

Since the Custom Commands extension doesn't support variables for inventory, we'll need to use Streamer.bot's user data features.

#### **Storing User Data**

**In Streamer.bot:**

1. **In the `AdventureOutcome` Action**, when the user finds a treasure:

   - **Add Sub-Action:** `User > Set User Data`
   - **Key:** `Inventory`
   - **Value:** `Gold`
   - **Operation:** `Append`

2. **Create a Command:** `!inventory`

   - **Action:** `ShowInventory`

3. **Action:** `ShowInventory`

   - **Sub-Action:** `User > Get User Data`
     - **Key:** `Inventory`
     - **Store In Variable:** `UserInventory`
   - **Sub-Action:** `Twitch > Send Message`
     - **Message:** `%userName%, your inventory contains: %UserInventory%`

---

### **7. Implementing Cooldowns and Permissions via Chat**

While the Custom Commands extension allows you to add cooldowns and permissions in the command syntax, complex settings may require adjustments in Streamer.bot.

#### **Adding Cooldowns in Chat**

**In Chat:**

```plaintext
!commands add !roll Rolling a dice... You rolled a %randomNumber% between 1 and 6. (Cooldown: 10s)
```

**Note:** If the syntax `(Cooldown: 10s)` doesn't set the cooldown, adjust it in Streamer.bot:

1. Go to **`Commands`**.
2. Find `!roll`.
3. Set the **User Cooldown** to `10` seconds.
4. Save the command.

---

### **8. Editing and Removing Commands**

#### **Editing a Command**

**In Chat:**

```plaintext
!commands edit !shop Visit our updated shop at https://newshoplink.com
```

#### **Removing a Command**

**In Chat:**

```plaintext
!commands remove !shop
```

---

### **9. Creating Aliases**

To have multiple triggers for the same command.

**In Chat:**

```plaintext
!commands alias !shop !store
```

Now, both `!shop` and `!store` will trigger the same response.

---

### **10. Advanced RPG Mechanics**

For more complex game features, you can utilize variables and conditional logic within Streamer.bot.

#### **Implementing a Battle System**

**Due to the limitations of chat-based command creation, we'll set this up in Streamer.bot.**

**a. Create an Action:** `BattleAction`

**b. Add Sub-Actions:**

1. **Generate Player Attack Roll**

   - **Math > Random Number**
     - **Store In:** `PlayerRoll`
     - **Minimum:** `1`
     - **Maximum:** `20`

2. **Generate Monster Defense Roll**

   - **Math > Random Number**
     - **Store In:** `MonsterRoll`
     - **Minimum:** `1`
     - **Maximum:** `15`

3. **Determine Outcome**

   - **Logic > If Condition**

     - **Condition:** `%PlayerRoll%` greater than `%MonsterRoll%`

     - **If True:**

       - **Send Message:**
         - `%userName%, you dealt a critical hit to the monster! Victory is yours!`

       - **(Optional) Reward the Player**

     - **If False:**

       - **Send Message:**
         - `%userName%, the monster overpowered you! You have been defeated.`

       - **(Optional) Apply Penalty**

**c. Create the Command:**

- **Command:** `!battle`
- **Action:** `BattleAction`
- **Permission:** `Everyone`
- **Cooldown:** Set as desired.

---

### **11. Utilizing Math and Randomization in Commands**

Incorporate random elements directly in your commands.

**Example: `!dice` Command**

**In Chat:**

```plaintext
!commands add !dice Rolling a dice... You rolled a %randomNumber% between 1 and 6.
```

---

### **12. Setting Up Timed Messages**

Timed messages cannot be created via the Custom Commands extension through chat. You need to set them up in Streamer.bot.

**In Streamer.bot:**

1. Go to **`Timers`**.
2. Click **`Add`** to create a new timer.
3. **Name:** `FollowReminder`
4. **Message:** `Don't forget to follow the channel for updates!`
5. **Interval:** Set the time interval (e.g., every 15 minutes).
6. **Chat Lines Requirement:** Optionally set the minimum number of chat lines to prevent messages in inactive chats.
7. Save the timer.

---

### **13. Managing Permissions**

Set who can use specific commands.

**Example: Restrict `!price` Command to Moderators**

**In Chat:**

```plaintext
!commands add !price The current price is $25. (Permissions: Moderator)
```

**Note:** If permissions cannot be set via chat syntax, adjust in Streamer.bot:

1. Go to **`Commands`**.
2. Find `!price`.
3. Set **Permission** to `Moderator`.
4. Save the command.

---

### **14. Integrating External APIs**

For advanced features like live price checks or game stats, you need to use Streamer.bot's C# scripting or external scripts, as the Custom Commands extension doesn't support API calls via chat commands.

---

### **15. Testing and Debugging**

- **Test Commands in Chat:** After adding or editing a command, test it directly in your chat.
- **Use Streamer.bot Logs:** Monitor the logs to see if commands are being triggered and to identify any errors.
- **Adjust as Needed:** If a command isn't working as expected, review the syntax or settings in Streamer.bot.

---

## **Final Tips**

- **Organize Commands:** Regularly review your commands to keep them organized and relevant.
- **Engage Viewers:** Encourage viewers to use the new commands and provide feedback.
- **Stay Informed:** Keep an eye on updates to Streamer.bot and its extensions for new features.
- **Community Resources:** Utilize forums and communities for additional support and ideas.

## **Additional Notes and Limitations**

- **Randomization and Conditional Logic:**

  - The `%randomNumber%` variable can generate random numbers, but you cannot perform conditional logic (e.g., checking if the roll is above a certain number) via chat commands.
  - To implement success/failure based on the roll, you will need to create actions in the Streamer.bot interface with conditional logic.

- **Adjusting HP and User Data:**

  - Modifying a player's HP and storing user-specific data cannot be done via chat commands alone.
  - You need to set up actions within Streamer.bot that handle user data management.

- **Interacting with Other Users:**

  - Commands that require interaction between users (e.g., attacking another player) need to be configured in Streamer.bot using actions and variables.

- **Multiplayer and Cross-Platform Integration:**

  - Cross-platform user identification and interactions require advanced setup in Streamer.bot.
  - You will need to use the Streamer.bot interface to handle platform-specific variables and user data.

## **Setting Up Advanced Features**

To fully implement your game with all the desired features, you will need to:

1. **Access the Streamer.bot Interface:**

   - Open Streamer.bot and navigate to the **Actions** and **Commands** sections.

2. **Create Actions for Complex Logic:**

   - For commands like `!roll`, `!boss_roll`, `!attack`, etc., you need to create actions that include:
     - **Variables and Random Number Generation**
     - **Conditional Logic (If Statements)**
     - **User Data Management (Setting and Getting User Data)**

3. **Set Up User Data Variables:**

   - Store user-specific data like HP, role, and inventory.
   - Use unique identifiers combining the username and platform.

4. **Implement Conditional Responses:**

   - Use **If Conditions** to determine the outcome based on random rolls or user actions.

5. **Handle Cross-Platform User Interactions:**

   - Ensure that user data is tracked correctly across different platforms (e.g., Twitch, YouTube).
   - Use platform identifiers in user data keys.

## **Example: Setting Up the `!roll` Command with Conditional Logic**

Since you cannot implement the required logic via chat commands, here's how you can set up the `!roll` command within Streamer.bot:

1. **Create an Action:** `DefenseRoll`

2. **Add Sub-Actions:**

   - **Generate Random Number:**
     - **Type:** `Math` > `Random Number`
     - **Store In Variable:** `RollResult`
     - **Minimum:** `1`
     - **Maximum:** `100`
   - **Conditional Logic:**
     - **If** `RollResult` >= `50` (Success):
       - **Modify User Data:** Add HP
       - **Send Message:** Success message
     - **Else** (Failure):
       - **Modify User Data:** Subtract HP
       - **Send Message:** Failure message

3. **Assign the Action to the Command:**

   - **Command:** `!roll`
   - **Action:** `DefenseRoll`

### **Advanced Features (Optional)**

**Note**: The commands above will create the basic structure of your game. However, to make the game more interactive and track things like health points (HP), you'll need to set up some things in Streamer.bot itself. Here's how to do it:

---

### **Setting Up Actions in Streamer.bot**

#### **What Are Actions?**

- **Actions** are like instructions that tell Streamer.bot what to do when a command is used.
- They can handle more complex things, like keeping track of a player's HP or making decisions based on random numbers.

#### **How to Create an Action**

1. **Open Streamer.bot**.
2. Click on **Actions** on the left side.
3. Click **Add** to create a new action.
4. Give it a **Name** (e.g., "DefenseRollAction").
5. Click on **Subactions** to add steps to your action.

---

#### **Example: Creating the '!roll' Action with HP Tracking**

##### **Step 1: Create the Action**

- **Name**: DefenseRollAction

##### **Step 2: Add Subactions**

1. **Generate a Random Number**

   - Click **Add**.
   - Choose **Math** > **Random Number**.
   - Set **Minimum** to 1 and **Maximum** to 100.
   - Store the result in a variable called `RollResult`.

2. **Check if the Roll is a Success or Failure**

   - Click **Add**.
   - Choose **Logic** > **If**.
   - Set the condition to: If `RollResult` is greater than or equal to 50.

3. **If Success**

   - **Add a Subaction under the If**.
   - Choose **Twitch** (or your platform) > **Send Message**.
   - Message: `Success! You defended successfully and gained 10 HP!`

   - **Add another Subaction**.
   - Choose **User** > **Modify User Data**.
   - Key: `HP`
   - Operation: **Add**
   - Value: `10`

4. **Else (If Failure)**

   - **Add a Subaction under Else**.
   - Choose **Twitch** > **Send Message**.
   - Message: `Oh no! You were defeated and lost 10 HP.`

   - **Add another Subaction**.
   - Choose **User** > **Modify User Data**.
   - Key: `HP`
   - Operation: **Subtract**
   - Value: `10`

##### **Step 3: Assign the Action to the '!roll' Command**

- Go to **Commands** in Streamer.bot.

- Click **Add** in Actions.
- Name it **DefenseRollAction**.

#### **3. Add the Random Number Subaction**

- Click **Subactions**.
- Click **Add** > **Math** > **Random Number**.
- Set **Minimum**: 1, **Maximum**: 100.
- Store result in variable: `RollResult`.

#### **4. Add the If Condition**

- Click **Add** > **Logic** > **If**.
- Condition: If `RollResult` **>=** 50.

#### **5. Add Success Outcome**

- Under **If**, click **Add**.
- **Send Message**: `Success! You defended successfully and gained 10 HP!`
- **Modify User Data**:
  - Key: `HP`
  - Operation: **Add**

---

### **Testing Your Command**

- Go to your chat.
- Type **!roll**.
- The bot should now perform the action you set up, including random rolls and adjusting HP.

---

### **Tracking Player HP**

- **To Check HP**:

  - Create a command **!status**.

  - **Command**:

    ```plaintext
    !commands add !status Your current HP is [HP value].
    ```

  - **But**, to show the actual HP, you need to set it up in Streamer.bot.

- **Setting Up '!status' in Streamer.bot**:

  - Create an action called **ShowStatus**.
  - **Subactions**:
    - **Get User Data**:
      - Key: `HP`
      - Store in variable: `CurrentHP`
    - **Send Message**:
      - Message: `Your current HP is %CurrentHP%.`

  - Assign **ShowStatus** to the **!status** command in **Commands**.

---

### **Making Multiplayer Battles**

**Note**: Multiplayer interactions are more complex and require careful setup in Streamer.bot.

- **Basic Idea**:
  - Players can attack each other using commands.
  - You need to track each player's HP and manage attacks.

- **Example Command**: **!attack [username]**

- **Setting Up '!attack' in Streamer.bot**:

  - **Create an Action**: AttackPlayer
  - **Subactions**:
    - **Check if the target player exists**.
    - **Generate attack success or failure**.
    - **Adjust the target player's HP**.
    - **Send messages to inform both players**.

**This setup involves advanced actions and might be a bit tricky. If you're comfortable with the basics, you can try setting it up step by step.**

---

### **Final Tips**

- **Take It Slow**: Start with the basic commands and make sure they work before adding more features.

[2024-10-01 21:54:28] FoSGamers:
Add this understanding to everything on how to build the game, and let's get this built right.

Here is an elaborate, step-by-step explanation of how to set up Streamer.bot so that it works with Restream.io's Unified Chat, allowing you to integrate chat messages from multiple platforms like Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, X (Twitter), and more. This guide can be copied into any ChatGPT instance and should provide a full and comprehensive approach to setting up your desired system.


---

Objective:

You want Streamer.bot to respond to chat commands from any platform connected via Restream.io (Twitch, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and others). Restream aggregates all incoming chat messages into a unified chat system. The goal is to have Streamer.bot listen to these messages and send appropriate responses back to the chat of the originating platform.


---

Overview of Setup:

1. Restream.io Setup:

Connect platforms like Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and others through Restream.io.

Use Restream Chat as the central hub for managing all incoming chat messages from these platforms.



2. Streamer.bot Setup:

Connect Restream Chat to Streamer.bot using WebSocket so that Streamer.bot listens to all incoming chat messages.

Configure commands and responses in Streamer.bot to handle chat commands across multiple platforms.



3. Platform-Specific Responses:

Streamer.bot will detect which platform the chat message is coming from (e.g., YouTube or Twitch) and send the response back to the correct platform.

Interactive features, such as RPG games, check-ins, and mini-games, will work across all connected platforms.





---

Step-by-Step Process:


---

Step 1: Connect Platforms to Restream.io

1. Create a Restream.io account if you haven’t already: https://restream.io/.


2. In the Restream Dashboard, connect all the platforms you plan to use:

Go to Destinations and add platforms like Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok.



3. Make sure the chat integration is enabled for each platform. This will ensure that all messages are sent to Restream Chat.



Step 2: Access Restream Unified Chat via WebSocket

1. Open Restream Chat:

You can access it via the Restream.io web app or download the Restream Chat desktop app.



2. Enable WebSocket Integration:

Open the Restream Chat settings.

In the advanced settings, you should find an option to enable WebSocket. Enable this and copy the WebSocket URL provided. It will look something like ws://restream.io:12345.

This URL is the connection you will use to link Restream Chat with Streamer.bot.




Step 3: Set Up WebSocket in Streamer.bot

1. Open Streamer.bot and navigate to the settings.


2. Go to Settings > WebSocket and add a new WebSocket Client.

Name the WebSocket connection (e.g., "Restream Chat Listener").

Paste the WebSocket URL from Restream.io’s chat settings into the URL field.

Save and test the connection to make sure Streamer.bot is receiving messages from Restream.




Step 4: Create Chat Command Actions in Streamer.bot

Now that you have WebSocket connected, you can configure commands and actions in Streamer.bot to respond to chat messages.

1. Create New Commands:

In Streamer.bot, go to Actions and create actions for the different commands you want to implement (e.g., !price, !goals, !checkin).

Add a Sub-action like Send Chat Message to send a response when the command is triggered.



2. Create Multi-Platform Commands:

You can create a single command that works across all platforms connected via Restream.io. For example:

A user on YouTube can type !checkin and receive the same response as a Twitch user who types the same command.

Both commands will work because the WebSocket connection is aggregating all platform messages into Streamer.bot.




3. Detect Platform Origin:

To ensure the responses are sent back to the correct platform, use the message.origin variable in Streamer.bot. This variable lets you know which platform the message originated from (e.g., Twitch or YouTube).

Set platform-specific responses if needed:

If the message came from Twitch, send the response using Twitch’s chat commands.

If the message came from YouTube, use YouTube’s chat system for the response.




4. Create Triggers for Commands:

For example, for the !checkin command:

In Actions, create a sub-action for when a user types !checkin.

Add logic to check the platform origin (message.origin) and respond accordingly.

The action will send back a response to the appropriate platform.






---

Step 5: Set Up Interactive Features (Optional)

You can add more interactive features like RPG games, mini-games, and check-ins that work across platforms:

1. RPG Games:

Set up RPG games in Streamer.bot that are triggered by chat commands (e.g., !adventure or !battle).

These commands will work for users on any platform connected via Restream.



2. Mini-Games:

Implement mini-games like Wheel of Magic or Hi/Lo Dice Roll.

Users from Twitch, YouTube, or other platforms can play these games in chat by typing commands, and the game results will be broadcast to the originating platform.



3. Check-In Systems:

Use commands like !checkin to create a community engagement feature.

Each platform’s users can check in, and you can track the number of check-ins across platforms using Streamer.bot’s user data system.





---

Step 6: Test and Finalize

1. Test Commands:

Go live and test the chat commands on different platforms (Twitch, YouTube, Facebook).

Verify that the responses are routed correctly through Restream.io to the appropriate platform.



2. Monitor Logs:

Check the logs in Streamer.bot to ensure all chat messages are being received and that actions are being triggered correctly.





---

Additional Notes:

Cross-Platform Interaction:

If you want to allow users from different platforms (e.g., YouTube vs Twitch) to interact with each other through shared games or leaderboards, you can use Streamer.bot’s variables to keep track of their progress. For example, a leaderboard can be global, showing participants from all platforms in the same list.


Future Platform Support:

Platforms like TikTok and others can be added to Restream.io in the future. Once they’re added, the same WebSocket setup will work to capture and respond to chat messages from those platforms.




---

By following these steps, you will have Streamer.bot fully integrated with Restream.io, allowing your chatbot to handle messages from multiple platforms and respond appropriately. The system will be capable of supporting chat-based interactions, RPG games, mini-games, and check-in systems across platforms like Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, and others.

I’m combining previous Streamer.bot setup instructions with Restream.io integration, adhering to guidelines and addressing any incomplete or interrupted instructions.

**Understanding the guidelines**

I’m piecing together the potential issues, emphasizing adherence to policy on disallowed content and careful inclusion of third-party integrations like X, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.

**Integrating platforms**

I’m working on integrating Restream.io's Unified Chat with Streamer.bot, enabling seamless gaming across multiple platforms. The guide will cover prerequisites, setup, and chat command integration.

**Piecing together**

Integrating **Streamer.bot** and **Restream.io** for a multiplayer RPG game involves importing advanced actions, setting commands, testing, and finalizing.

**Crafting instructions**

I'm assembling detailed, step-by-step guidance with all necessary commands for import into Streamer.bot, aiming for clarity and usability.

**Ensuring prerequisites**

OK, let me see. I’m checking that Streamer.bot is installed, you have a Restream.io account set up with connected platforms, and the Custom Commands extension is active.

### Restream.io setup
First, I create a Restream.io account. Then, I link streaming platforms like Twitch and YouTube, and authorize Restream.io to access these accounts. Finally, I ensure chat integration is enabled.

### Streamer.bot setup
I download and install Streamer.bot, then activate the Custom Commands extension through the left menu in the Extensions section.

**Establishing WebSocket Connection**

I’m setting up the WebSocket connection between Restream.io and Streamer.bot to synchronize chat commands. This involves enabling WebSocket server in Restream.io and integrating the URL into Streamer.bot.

**Selecting roles**

Players can choose roles: defender (100 HP), scout (90 HP), medic (80 HP), hunter (85 HP), engineer (75 HP). Each role has specific commands for guiding actions in the game.

**Mapping out actions**

I’m organizing initial prompts for responding to raider attacks from four directions and planning actions like rolling dice and waving.

**Crafting command sequences**

I’m developing a set of commands for interactions. Rolling the dice, exploring, investigating, searching, and defending emerge as key actions. Progressing through these steps enhances engagement and decision-making.

**Preparing for action**

OK, let me see—adding commands for continuing exploration like '!explore', engaging enemies with '!battle', and initiating a boss fight through '!boss_roll'. Multiplayer commands like '!join_battle' are set up for teamwork.

**Integrating Streamer.bot**

I’m integrating advanced actions into Streamer.bot to manage game logic, HP tracking, and multiplayer interactions. Actions include !attack, !status, and !leaderboard.

**Establishing roles and actions**

I’m mapping out actions for each role, like setting a player's role and health points. For Defenders, this involves setting their role and HP, then sending a message indicating their selection.

**Handling commands**

I’m documenting the '!north' command to ask for user input on defending against the approaching wave, considering various defensive responses and penalties.

**Laying out options**

First, I pull a random number to gauge next steps: Continue exploring or confront the Raider Leader. Then, I roll for a chance against the Raider Leader.

**Setting up game actions**

Interestingly enough, I’m defining game actions and outcomes. If the user solves the riddle, they advance; otherwise, they lose health and must heal.

**Winning the battle**

Interestingly enough, if an user is in a match and their attack roll hits 50 or more, they successfully reduce the opponent's health by 20 points. The aftermath depends on whether the opponent's health drops to zero.

**Assigning actions**

I assigned actions to commands in Streamer.bot by selecting them and editing as needed, ensuring each command had the appropriate action linked.

**Ensuring game functionality**

I'm testing the game steps, verifying the bot's responses, confirming role choices, and updating HP as commands are executed.

**Ensuring smooth multiplayer**

I’m testing multiplayer features by having another user join and attack, then checking HP adjustments. Next, I’ll verify cross-platform routing through Restream.io.

  ]
}
```

### **Step 6: Assigning Actions to Commands**

After importing the actions, assign them to their corresponding commands.

#### **Assigning Actions**

1. **Open the `Commands` Tab** in Streamer.bot.

2. **Select the Command** you want to assign an action to (e.g., `!defender`).

3. **Click `Edit`**.

4. **Assign the Action**:

   - In the **`Action`** dropdown, select the corresponding action (e.g., `SetRole_Defender`).

5. **Click `OK`** to save the command.

6. **Repeat** for each command that requires an action.

---

### **Step 7: Testing Your Game**

Now it's time to test everything to ensure your game works across all platforms.

#### **3. Begin Defending**

- Type `!north`, `!south`, `!east`, or `!west`.
- Check that the bot prompts you to `!roll`.

#### **4. Roll to Defend**

- Type `!roll`.
- The bot should execute the `DefenseRoll` action and adjust your HP.

#### **5. Check Your Status**

- Type `!status`.
- The bot should display your current HP.

#### **6. Test Multiplayer Features**

- Have another user join the battle with `!join_battle`.
- Attempt to attack each other using `!attack [username]`.

To implement Mini Team Break Races with teams of 3 participants, where two teams face off initially (with the option to add more later), here’s how to structure the game while ensuring Whatnot compliance:

Mini Team Break Races Structure

1. Team Formation:

Each team consists of 3 participants. Two teams will face off in each race, meaning a total of 6 participants per break.

Participants can either choose or be randomly assigned to a team, ensuring balanced competition from the start.



2. Card Pulls and Point System:

As in the larger version, assign points based on the rarity or value of the cards pulled:

Commons: 1 point

Uncommons: 3 points

Rares/Mythics: 5-10 points (you can adjust the point values depending on the set or game being played).


Each team’s points will be tracked and displayed live, keeping participants engaged throughout the race.



3. Game Flow:

Opening Packs: Each participant receives a set of cards (e.g., one booster pack) during the break. These cards are opened live on screen, with points being assigned based on the pulls.

Tallying Points: Each team’s points are calculated as a combined score from the cards pulled by all 3 members. The team with the highest total score wins the race.



4. Prize Distribution:

Guaranteed Items: Every participant receives the cards they pulled as part of the break, ensuring that no one leaves empty-handed.

Winner’s Advantage: The team with the most points gets to choose their bonus items first. Bonus items can include booster packs, rare singles, or other collectibles. Within the winning team, the participant with the highest individual points picks first, followed by the second-highest, and so on.

The losing team also gets to pick from the bonus pool, but after the winning team has selected their items.




Why This is Compliant:

1. Guaranteed Value for All Participants:

Each participant receives their own cards from the packs, so no one leaves empty-handed, satisfying Whatnot’s requirement for guaranteed value.



2. No Gambling Elements:

There is no element of chance in terms of getting nothing. Everyone is guaranteed cards from their packs and a chance to select a bonus prize, which avoids any perception of gambling.



3. Full Transparency:

The entire process, from pack opening to point tallying and prize selection, is fully visible to all participants in the live stream, ensuring transparency and trust.



4. Competitive but Fair:

The competition aspect (which team scores the most points) is fair and transparent, but it does not disadvantage any participant. The winner’s advantage is simply choosing prizes first, but everyone still receives a bonus item.




Step-by-Step Implementation for Mini Team Break Races:

1. Pre-Show Setup:

Announce the game rules in your show notes: how teams are formed, how points are earned, and how the prize selection process will work.

Clearly list the market values of the cards and bonuses available for prize selection (e.g., extra booster packs, rare singles).



2. During the Stream:

Form the teams of 3 participants each.

Open the packs live on-screen, assigning points based on card rarity and value.

Keep a visible leaderboard to track team progress in real time.



3. Prize Selection:

After points are tallied, allow the winning team to choose their bonus items first, in order of highest individual points. The second team follows.

Ensure everyone gets to pick a bonus prize, guaranteeing that all participants receive both their cards and a bonus item.



4. Post-Break Wrap-Up:

Congratulate the winners and share details of the next Mini Team Break Race (if more teams will be added in future breaks).




By following this structure, your Mini Team Break Races will stay within Whatnot's guidelines while delivering an engaging and competitive experience for your viewers. The format is scalable, allowing you to add more teams in future breaks without compromising compliance.

### **Implementation of Mini Team Break Races with Whatnot Compliance**

#### **Step-by-Step Guide for Setting Up the Mini Team Break Races**:

1. **Pre-Show Setup**:
   - Announce the game rules in the show notes:
     - Teams are made up of 3 participants.
     - Points are assigned based on card rarity (Commons = 1, Uncommons = 3, Rares/Mythics = 5-10).
     - Winning team picks bonus prizes first; all participants win something.
   - List the prizes available for selection, such as booster packs or rare singles.

2. **Forming Teams**:
   - Either let participants choose their teams or assign them randomly.
   - Two teams of 3 will compete in each break. (You can add more teams later as the format grows.)

3. **Live Pack Opening**:

   - Cards are opened live on screen, with points awarded based on rarity.

4. **Tracking Points**:
   - Use a visible leaderboard to show the total points for each team in real time.
   - Display individual scores within each team.

5. **Prize Selection**:
   - After the points are tallied, the winning team picks their bonus items first.
   - Within the winning team, the highest individual score picks first, then the second highest, and so on.
   - The losing team follows the same process after the winners have chosen.

6. **Post-Break Wrap-Up**:
   - Announce the next Mini Team Break Race and encourage participants to join upcoming breaks.

The engaging competition will keep viewers entertained while maintaining transparency and fairness throughout the event.

[2024-10-03 05:53:38] FoSGamers:
Okay, that looks good. What I need you to do now is generate me an Excel file that will have tracking for all this, for the 6 people and the 3 people on each team, or the 3 people, you know, for 3 people and I can like copy that and make it into other columns if needed. So there's 3 teams, 3 people per team. But whatever I need you to do is, I need to be able to have like an up arrow, or something where I can quickly tally up the amount, because it's only between 1 and 5 points that they get, so it's not a lot of points that they can get here. So what I think we can do is, if we have like an up arrow, I can just press the up arrow on each person when I'm in there, so like I press the up arrow, like up this, up, oh, they got that, they got this card, 1, they got another, 1, they brought this card, 1, 2, 3, they got this card, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, that type of thing. That way I can press the up arrow and only have to do that and not have to put a number in quickly, and that way it'll make it work a little easier. Let me know if that's, if that'll work, and if you can build that for me. If you can, build it for me so I can download it and use it in my Google Sheets.

[2024-10-03 05:53:57] ChatGPT:
I've created the Excel file for tracking the points of the 3 teams, with 3 players per team. You can download the file from the link below and use it in Google Sheets.

[Download the Mini Team Break Race Tracker](sandbox:/mnt/data/Mini_Team_Break_Race_Tracker.xlsx)

For easy tallying, you can manually increment the points by entering numbers. Unfortunately, Google Sheets doesn't support up-arrow click increments directly, but you can easily click on the cell and use "Ctrl + Up Arrow" to increase values by 1 if needed. Let me know if you need further customization!

[2024-10-03 05:55:54] FoSGamers:
How do I increase the value by one using Google Sheets when I have the value highlighted for one of the users?

[2024-10-03 05:56:08] ChatGPT:
In Google Sheets, there isn't a direct built-in feature to increase values using the up arrow alone, but you can easily increment values manually using keyboard shortcuts. Here's a simple method:

### How to Increment a Value by One in Google Sheets:

1. **Select the Cell**: Click on the cell with the number you want to increment.
   
2. **Use Keyboard Shortcut**: 
   - **Windows**: Press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `=` (or `+`) to open the "Insert" menu, but you need to type `1` to add that value manually.
   - **Mac**: You can press `Cmd` + `Shift` + `=` or manually enter the number and use `Enter`.

3. **Alternatively, Use a Formula**:
   - If you'd like to make the process more automated, you could enter a formula in the cell like this:
     ```excel
     =A1 + 1
     ```
   - Afterward, copy the result and paste it back as a value.

4. **Quick Manual Increase**:
   - You can manually click on the cell, type `+1` after the current value, and press `Enter`. Google Sheets will add `1` to the existing value.

If you'd like something more automatic, we could build a script within Google Sheets using **Google Apps Script** to increment values by 1 with a button or a specific key command.

Let me know if you'd like help setting up a custom script for easier incrementing!

[2024-10-03 05:57:16] FoSGamers:
Build the script within Google Sheets to do this for me, so Google Apps Script, so that I can do this within Google Sheets.

[2024-10-03 05:57:48] ChatGPT:
Here’s how you can create a Google Apps Script that will allow you to increment a value by one with a button inside Google Sheets:

### Step-by-Step Guide to Implement an Increment Script in Google Sheets

1. **Open the Google Sheet** where you want to apply the script.

2. **Open the Apps Script Editor**:
   - Click on `Extensions` in the menu bar.
   - Select `Apps Script`.

3. **Add the Increment Script**:
   - Delete any code that may already be there and paste the following code:

```javascript
function incrementCell() {
  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getActiveSheet();
  var range = sheet.getActiveRange();
  var currentValue = range.getValue();
  
  // Ensure the current value is a number, or start from 0
  if (!isNaN(currentValue)) {
    range.setValue(currentValue + 1);
  } else {
    range.setValue(1);  // If cell is empty or not a number, start at 1
  }
}

function onOpen() {
  var ui = SpreadsheetApp.getUi();
  // Add a custom menu
  ui.createMenu('Custom Functions')
      .addItem('Increment Cell', 'incrementCell')
      .addToUi();
}
```

4. **Save the Script**:
   - Name the project something like `Increment Script`.
   - Click the floppy disk icon to save.

5. **Authorize the Script**:
   - After saving, click on the play button to run the script.
   - A window will pop up asking you to review permissions. Click `Continue`, select your Google account, and allow the permissions.

6. **Refresh Your Google Sheet**:
   - After authorizing, go back to your Google Sheet and refresh the page.

7. **Using the Script**:
   - Now you’ll see a new menu called `Custom Functions` in the menu bar.
   - Click on `Custom Functions` and choose `Increment Cell`.
   - This will automatically increment the value of the currently selected cell by 1.

### Optional: Create a Button to Increment

If you want to have a button directly in your Google Sheet to make this process even faster:

1. **Create a Button**:
   - Go to `Insert` in the menu bar and select `Drawing`.
   - Create a simple shape or button.
   - After creating the button, click on it, then click the three vertical dots in the upper-right corner of the drawing, and select `Assign script`.
   - Type `incrementCell` (this is the name of the function we created).

2. **Test the Button**:
   - Now, click on the button. It should increment the value of the currently selected cell by 1.

This method will allow you to easily increment any selected cell by 1 with a button or from the custom menu, making it more convenient for you to tally up points during your games.

You don't need anything with the rules in the description for it. Just make an image of some kind. Describe an image. You don't need anything with rules. Just say the title and giveaways. That's it. And make it, like, read through this entire chat multiple times. Analyze it multiple times. Read through it word-for-word multiple times. Analyze it multiple times. Read through it line-for-line multiple times. Analyze it multiple times. Read through it paragraph-by-paragraph multiple times. Now, when I say everything, I mean everything that I provided you since the first thing I provided you and everything that you provided me also after. And you need to understand thoroughly where we're at, what we're doing, and then use the correct template that would have been provided to you from the FOS Gamer's Business Bible.

Only have the title in there once, so as not to confuse it, and giveaways in there once, so as not to confuse it. And make sure that you thoroughly describe the image and, like, what everything should look like. Characters, or table, or whatever the hell is in there. There are cards, the people, the images, the creations, whatever they're doing, and having it made based on all the stuff that we normally have done. That's what I needed to kind of do it there. But only have words in there once, because if you have them in there more than once, it confuses it.

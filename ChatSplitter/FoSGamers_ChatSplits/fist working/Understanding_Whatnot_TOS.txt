I need you to look at the whatnot Terms of Service and all of the rules and related to trading cards and how to sell them and any type of games that are there. Anything that would be related to gambling, make sure it's not done, that type of stuff. I need you to read each single line of the Terms of Service and make sure you thoroughly understand it. Now read each page also, so if there's still links to go further in, you continuously go further in until there's nothing left for you to find from one of the pages. When you are done with that, let me know that you fully understand it so that we can build a game that will be within the Terms of Service and I won't get in trouble.

### Understanding Whatnot's Terms of Service and Guidelines

To ensure compliance with Whatnot's Terms of Service (TOS) and related guidelines, I have thoroughly reviewed all relevant documents. Here are the key points and rules that you need to be aware of to avoid any violations while designing your game:

#### 1. **Card Breaks and Mystery Boxes**
- **Card Breaks**: Only eligible sellers can conduct card breaks, which must involve professionally sealed products. The entire process must be visible on screen from start to finish, including any tools or hands dealing with the cards. Each buyer must receive at least one card per purchase. Breaks must not span multiple shows, and pre-sales off-platform are prohibited.
- **Mystery Boxes**: Sellers must provide clear descriptions including the minimum, maximum, and average values of the items. Items must be shipped with a combined fair market value matching the winning bid【7†source】【8†source】.

#### 2. **No Gambling or Purchase-Based Prizes**
- Whatnot strictly prohibits gambling, including paid entries to raffles or races. Sales containing bounties or other purchase-based prizes are also banned. Ensure that all elements of your game are free from any form of gambling or purchase-based prize mechanisms【9†source】.

#### 3. **Honesty and Transparency**
- **Accurate Representation**: You must accurately describe the condition of items and not inflate their market value. Misrepresentation can lead to corrective actions.
- **Prohibition of Fake Items**: Selling or giving away counterfeit items is strictly prohibited. Intellectual property rights must be respected, and any violations can result in severe penalties【9†source】【11†source】.

#### 4. **Community Guidelines and Conduct**
- **Respectful Behavior**: All participants must adhere to respectful and honest behavior. This includes honoring purchases, avoiding any form of shill bidding (artificially inflating prices), and not engaging in off-platform transactions.
- **Adult Content**: Explicit or sexually suggestive content is prohibited. Any sensitive content must be appropriately flagged【9†source】【10†source】.

#### 5. **Live Streaming Rules**
- **Visibility and Supervision**: Live streams must comply with visibility requirements, and any underage participants must be supervised by an adult on screen. Excessive drinking, marijuana use, and dangerous behaviors during streams are discouraged.
- **Supported Locations**: Selling must occur within supported countries, and any change in location requires re-onboarding on the platform【9†source】.

#### 6. **Refund and Buyer Protection Policies**
- Refunds are available under specific conditions, such as incorrect or counterfeit items, but are generally not provided for issues like grading discrepancies or off-platform transactions. Detailed timeframes for submitting refund requests are outlined for various categories【11†source】.

#### 5. **Live Streaming Requirements**
- **Visibility**: All aspects of your pull boxes or wheel-based games must be visible during live streams. This includes showing the items being pulled and any tools used.
- **Supervision**: Any underage participants must be supervised, and excessive drinking or dangerous behaviors during streams are discouraged【17†source】.

Okay, I want to build a game where the person that buys into a pull box will pull out cards until they are either beaten by the boss in an adventurous story or the boss beats them. I need that to be compliant and also what they pull out to be worth monetary value. I'll have singles and packs of cards in there, so that's what I need you to help me figure out on that. If possible, I can have you connect to my Google Sheets so that you can read what I have for inventory.

### Designing a Compliant Game for Whatnot

To design a game where players buy into a pull box and engage in an adventure story, while ensuring compliance with Whatnot's Terms of Service, we need to focus on the following aspects:

1. **Game Mechanics**:
   - Ensure every participant receives an item of value.
   - Clearly disclose the monetary value of singles and packs in the pull box.
   - Avoid any elements that could be construed as gambling.

2. **Transparency and Honesty**:
   - Accurately describe the condition and value of the items.
   - Maintain transparency about the game rules and mechanics.

3. **Compliance with Community Guidelines**:
   - Adhere to guidelines about explicit content and respectful behavior during live streams.
   - Ensure proper visibility of the pull process during live streams.

#### Game Structure
Here's a potential structure for your game:

1. **Pull Box Setup**:
   - Create a pull box containing a mix of singles and packs of cards.
   - Clearly list the value range of the items (minimum, maximum, and average values).

2. **Gameplay Mechanics**:
   - Players buy into the game to pull cards from the box.
   - Each card or pack pulled is shown live on stream and its value is disclosed.
   - The game continues with the story element where players face a boss. If they pull a high-value card or pack, they deal damage to the boss. If they pull a low-value item, the boss deals damage to them.
   - The game ends when either the player defeats the boss or the boss defeats the player.

3. **Monetary Value**:
   - Ensure that every pull provides a tangible value that aligns with the disclosed values.
   - Disclose that the value of items can vary but ensure the average value provides a fair chance of pulling valuable items.

#### Compliance Checks
1. **Avoiding Gambling**:
   - Since Whatnot prohibits gambling, ensure that every pull results in a guaranteed item of value.
   - Avoid any elements of chance that determine whether a player wins or loses beyond the predefined rules.

2. **Transparency**:
   - Provide clear rules and item values in the show notes or item listings.
   - Ensure the entire process is visible during the live stream.

3. **Respect Community Guidelines**:
   - Maintain respectful behavior and avoid explicit content.
   - Ensure all participants are supervised if underage and avoid excessive drinking or dangerous behavior during streams.

It seems I cannot directly access Google Sheets in this environment. However, you can follow these steps to set it up on your local machine and share the relevant data with me.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Access Google Sheets with Python

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install gspread pandas google-auth
   ```

2. **Set Up Google Cloud Credentials**:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a new project or select an existing project.
   - Navigate to the “APIs & Services” > “Credentials” page.
   - Click on “Create credentials” and select “Service account”.
   - Follow the steps to create a new service account and download the JSON key file.

3. **Share the Google Sheets Document**:
   - Open your Google Sheets document.
   - Click on the “Share” button and share it with the service account email address (found in the JSON key file).

4. **Python Script to Access Google Sheets**:
   Save the following script as `access_google_sheets.py` and run it:

   ```python
   import gspread
   from google.oauth2.service_account import Credentials
   import pandas as pd

   # Load credentials from the JSON file
   creds = Credentials.from_service_account_file('path/to/your/json_key_file.json')

   # Authorize and connect to Google Sheets
   client = gspread.authorize(creds)
   sheet = client.open_by_url('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hE6Pca-Aih5ZyxE2oMwy4R_Vk8JZk_rJlCSzqK4L5FE/edit?gid=0#gid=0').sheet1

   # Get all records
   data = sheet.get_all_records()

   # Convert to DataFrame
   df = pd.DataFrame(data)

   # Print the first few rows of the DataFrame
   print(df.head())
   ```

Replace `path/to/your/json_key_file.json` with the path to your downloaded JSON key file.

5. **Share the Data**:
   - Run the script to ensure it works correctly and retrieves the data.
   - Export the DataFrame to a CSV file and share it with me, or copy the relevant parts here for further assistance.

### Next Steps
Once you have the data in a format that can be shared, I can help you structure the pull box content, ensuring all items are correctly valued and the game mechanics comply with Whatnot's guidelines.

Would you like to proceed with this setup, or do you have any other questions or concerns?

The Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) in Florida is subject to a combination of federal, state, and local regulations, especially concerning the installation and use of mooring balls. Below is a detailed overview focusing on Florida and specifically New Smyrna Beach.

**1. Federal Regulations**

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers oversees navigable waters in the United States, including the ICW. Any permanent mooring structures, such as mooring balls, are considered potential obstructions and typically require a permit from the Corps. This ensures that such installations do not interfere with navigation or pose hazards to vessels. citeturn0search17

**2. Florida State Regulations**

Florida's statutes provide specific guidelines on anchoring and mooring:

- **Anchoring Limitation Areas (ALAs):** Counties can establish ALAs where anchoring is restricted to no more than 45 consecutive days within a six-month period. These areas must be clearly marked with signs and buoys. citeturn0search2

- **Boating-Restricted Areas:** The state can designate areas with specific vessel speed and traffic restrictions to enhance safety and protect the environment. citeturn0search4

**3. Local Regulations in New Smyrna Beach**

Local ordinances further regulate mooring and anchoring:

- **Boating Restrictions:** New Smyrna Beach has established an "Idle Speed No Wake" zone in and adjacent to the ICW. This area is bounded on the north and west by the western shoreline of the Indian River North, on the south by the northern shoreline of Chicken Island, and on the east by a line drawn due north from the eastern end of Chicken Island. citeturn0search5

Installing mooring balls within or near the ICW requires adherence to several regulations:

- **Permitting:** A permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is typically required for any permanent mooring installations to ensure they do not obstruct navigation. citeturn0search17

- **Environmental Considerations:** The Florida Department of Environmental Protection may require environmental assessments to ensure that the installation does not harm local ecosystems.

**5. Recommendations**

- **Consult Authorities:** Before installing mooring balls, consult with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and New Smyrna Beach city officials to obtain necessary permits and approvals.

- **Professional Assessment:** Engage marine engineering professionals to assess the proposed installation site, ensuring compliance with all regulations and minimal environmental impact.

**Summary**

Installing mooring balls in the ICW, particularly near New Smyrna Beach, requires careful navigation of federal, state, and local regulations. Key steps include obtaining permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, adhering to Florida's anchoring and mooring statutes, and complying with local ordinances specific to New Smyrna Beach. Engaging with relevant authorities and professionals is crucial to ensure lawful and environmentally responsible installation.

The recent appearance of two mooring balls near the South Causeway in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, raises questions about their legality and compliance with local and state regulations. To determine their legitimacy, it's essential to consider the following factors:

**1. Local Regulations in New Smyrna Beach**

The City of New Smyrna Beach enforces specific ordinances regarding waterways and mooring practices:

- **Anchoring Restrictions:** According to Section 90-155 of the city's code, it is unlawful to anchor a vessel in certain areas except in emergencies. citeturn0search1

- **Mooring Installations:** The city's ordinances do not explicitly address the installation of private mooring balls. However, any installation within city jurisdiction would likely require approval to ensure they do not obstruct navigation or violate local regulations.

**2. State and Federal Oversight**

Beyond local ordinances, state and federal agencies oversee activities in navigable waters:

- **Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP):** The FDEP regulates activities that might impact the state's waterways. Installing mooring balls may require permits to ensure environmental compliance.

- **U.S. Army Corps of Engineers:** As previously noted, this federal agency oversees navigable waters, and any permanent installations, such as mooring balls, typically require their authorization to prevent obstructions to navigation.

**3. Verification Steps**

To ascertain the legality of the mooring balls near the South Causeway:

- **Contact Local Authorities:** Reach out to the New Smyrna Beach City Marina or the city's planning and zoning department to inquire about any permits issued for these mooring balls. They can provide information on approved installations and any recent changes to local regulations.

- **Consult State Agencies:** Engage with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to check if any state permits were granted for the mooring balls in question.

- **Federal Confirmation:** Contact the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' local district office to verify if federal permits were issued for these installations.

**Summary**

Determining the legality of the newly placed mooring balls near the South Causeway in New Smyrna Beach involves consulting local, state, and federal authorities. Given the lack of explicit local regulations on private mooring installations, it's crucial to verify if the necessary permits were obtained from both state and federal agencies to ensure compliance and safety.

[00:08:57] where you work well I understand that
[00:08:58] I've been there myself that's literally
[00:09:00] the I did that job hoping that I would
[00:09:02] have a nice cushy uh thing to retire
[00:09:05] almost in a
[00:09:08] way uh yeah see my wife um has played
[00:09:11] both plays both of them a little bit

[00:09:16] haven't played so I I know how to play
[00:09:18] you know you're I'm learning them both
[00:09:19] and sometimes get confused like I
[00:09:21] understand that so that's why like we
[00:09:23] sometime we try to like stick to doing
[00:09:25] one thing for a little while don't try
[00:09:26] to overdo it
[00:09:42] [Music]
[00:09:59] always
[00:10:17] lows for around five months yeah hey you
[00:10:20] know what I've been playing
[00:10:24] for well probably about a year and a
[00:10:26] half continuously maybe two years now
[00:10:29] but I played in 95 to about 2000 then
[00:10:32] took a break played a little bit
[00:10:33] randomly threw out there but not much uh

[00:10:37] say yeah so I mean I'm still I mean I I
[00:10:40] have like few years under my belt but
[00:10:41] I'm still confused as all hell when I

[00:10:44] the store on a regular basis let us know
[00:10:46] one to goes how it supposed to
[00:10:49] work that's the thing that I like about

[00:14:08] hanging out chatting on some YouTube
[00:14:10] with people uh running through playing
[00:14:12] we were ripped open a uh a nice uh
[00:14:14] booster of uh some sorcery earlier so
[00:14:17] we're just kind of hanging out doing our
[00:14:18] thing we have our new adventure game
[00:14:20] that we got going on you know we got you
[00:14:21] can be your different characters we had
[00:14:23] those four different characters like we
[00:14:24] always have if you guys want to play but
[00:14:26] uh we're just hanging out chatting
[00:14:27] really I know the mornings are slow and
[00:14:29] you know people are waking up so I'm
[00:14:31] never too uh I not a big pushy pushy
[00:14:33] person like oh buy this buy this just
[00:14:35] more of a hangout you want to have fun
[00:14:37] we'll have fun and play a game type
[00:14:43] thing let's do this
[00:14:49] here yeah I know well that's why I like
[00:14:51] having physical things here and I know
[00:14:54] it sounds weird but even growing up like
[00:14:56] as things went digital like I love the
[00:14:57] digital aspect of it but even with with
[00:14:59] games I'd rather have the physical game
[00:15:00] because when somebody shuts something
[00:15:01] down that physical game still will work
[00:15:04] when you pop it in the
[00:15:05] [Music]
[00:15:20] [Music]
[00:15:23] machine I am in um down in Florida
[00:15:27] myself hey how's it going
[00:15:35] visual yeah I am able to multi stream on
[00:15:38] YouTube I know it's pretty
[00:15:41] cool I get to go on YouTube I could
[00:15:44] possibly do even twitch and I think
[00:15:45] there was one possibly Facebook it just
[00:15:48] pretty much copies My Stream and P sends
[00:15:50] it over to YouTube with a little like
[00:15:52] whatnot logo on it so everybody sees
[00:15:54] what's going on so they know where to go
[00:15:56] if they want to come over and hang out
[00:15:57] here
[00:16:02] yeah it's like an option
[00:16:04] there exactly cure have the actual item
[00:16:07] in your hand then it's hard for you to
[00:16:08] know like anybody to
[00:16:10] complain exactly and see what I plan on
[00:16:12] doing here is I'm trying to make it so I
[00:16:15] needed to get I'm building something so
[00:16:16] my games work more efficiently then when
[00:16:18] my games work more efficiently that way
[00:16:20] I can get them out pumping out really
[00:16:22] easy for you guys then the other thing
[00:16:24] that I'll be able to do is I will be
[00:16:25] able to next put it into the chatot
[00:16:28] thing that I was building building so
[00:16:29] that they automatically work with that
[00:16:30] and they send the pictures over into the
[00:16:33] stream for us and that's my that's what
[00:16:34] I'm trying to get running that's what
[00:16:36] I've been trying to get running before
[00:16:37] because the chat I have now works
[00:16:38] basically for what everything I need but
[00:16:41] the advanced one I wanted to do these
[00:16:42] things so that's why I'm uh making my
[00:16:44] own updates so that's what I'm saying
[00:16:45] here I'm just trying to do some
[00:16:48] stuff they cannot see this chat
[00:16:52] no yes I kind of make like yeah you see
[00:16:55] this year I do like a a few um I guess
[00:16:58] you call them Bas games more but we
[00:17:00] wander through an adventure in the
[00:17:01] Wasteland here doing having some fun we
[00:17:04] get to play you pick one of the
[00:17:05] characters here there's like uh about
[00:17:07] you have three different bosses you go
[00:17:09] through about 12 or nine N9 to 12
[00:17:12] encounters type thing along the way kind
[00:17:15] of like a d andish type Adventure is
[00:17:17] what it
[00:17:22] is move that over here a little bit
[00:17:33] yeah sure Dan not a problem YouTube
[00:17:37] canaz see chat that's why we're talking
[00:17:39] to like two different people at the same
[00:17:40] time you may be confused as
[00:17:44] [ __ ] that's why I'm trying to
[00:17:46] get it so that uh my goal is to have
[00:17:48] what I'm trying to do is have my uh my
[00:17:49] stuff combine everything together so
[00:17:51] everybody will see everything all the
[00:17:53] time with the chats I'm trying to figure
[00:17:54] out how to do that I'm working on
[00:17:57] it let's run a little bit of thing here

[00:26:46] cool so what time are you up this
[00:26:48] morning Charlie from by by the way the
[00:26:50] reason why I'm talking about um my my
[00:26:52] nephew was on the other day a few months
[00:26:54] back when they came down to visit he was
[00:26:56] uh he was here hanging out with us and
[00:26:57] did a show with with us in one morning
[00:26:59] so that's why I was uh that's why I'm
[00:27:01] talking him with him right now he he
[00:27:02] started to play some Magic with his dad
[00:27:04] and that's all uh that's really just
[00:27:06] talking to him about that that's all
[00:27:09] chitchatting I'm G to put those together
[00:27:10] so I can uh decide if I want to play
[00:27:13] what I want to do to play with those
[00:27:14] ones nice looking cards I like those
[00:27:16] ones are Prett pretty
[00:27:24] cards oh really well then you know what
[00:27:28] I may find myself six there no that's
[00:27:29] not bad Charlie I might find myself in
[00:27:32] Michigan at some point because one of
[00:27:33] the things that we plan on doing is when
[00:27:36] we get our boat we start doing our
[00:27:38] traveling we'll keep our truck that I
[00:27:39] have my Jeep we'll outfit it to do some
[00:27:42] like overlanding stuff and then um high
[00:27:45] peak hurricane season we'll do some
[00:27:47] overlanding
[00:27:49] Adventures that's why I figured we
[00:27:51] because we're just like I am a person
[00:27:52] that I've always wanted to go and
[00:27:54] experience the world there's a large
[00:27:56] world for you to experience and people
[00:27:58] always get stuck in their little area so
[00:28:02] I've always wanted to do that and that's
[00:28:03] what I've been
[00:28:06] doing oh so yeah my boat though is going
[00:28:08] to be like a it's not going to be a
[00:28:10] small one it's going to be like a 50 to
[00:28:12] foot or or bigger or 45 or bigger unless
[00:28:16] it's catamaran we could probably do 40
[00:28:18] if it's
[00:28:20] catamaran so I don't know if we'll make
[00:28:22] it up there but if we can make it over
[00:28:24] there with the boat we will
[00:28:29] yes but it's getting there see it's
[00:28:31] getting there that's the point see yeah
[00:28:34] like see that means I'm going to have to
[00:28:36] go up to like Nova Scotia and down that
[00:28:38] direction if or up through the uh up
[00:28:41] through the uh you know the river there
[00:28:42] and I don't know if I'm going to be able
[00:28:43] to get up through the river through all
[00:28:44] the
[00:28:46] channels yeah see that's what I'm trying
[00:28:48] to say how am I gonna get a 50 foot boat
[00:28:50] over there I'm not gonna drive up you're
[00:28:52] going to drive that thing in a truck I'm
[00:28:53] I don't I don't have a I'm not a Mac
[00:28:55] Truck Driver dude like I can call my
[00:28:58] friend Josh be like yo Josh come drive
[00:29:00] my my boat around I guess if I hit the
[00:29:02] lottery and then we can go and like
[00:29:03] visit different places and just in my
[00:29:05] giant boat or maybe I could put wheels
[00:29:07] on the boat and I can start driving the
[00:29:08] boat around you think I'm gonna get in
[00:29:11] trouble for that one that would be
[00:29:13] awesome actually just this giant 50 foot
[00:29:17] boat like that has wheels on it and that
[00:29:20] way whenever I get stuck I can just get
[00:29:21] the wheels and we just go right up on
[00:29:23] land and we don't have to worry about
[00:29:24] being on any ever being beached or
[00:29:26] anything oh
[00:29:33] just made the greatest invention next
[00:29:35] invention ever I think I
[00:29:37] did it
[00:29:40] is the the yacht that traverses
[00:29:47] land you know what no one's going for
[00:29:49] anything so might as well throw one of
[00:29:51] them out here I not throw the deluxe one
[00:29:53] out the ultimate throw out the
[00:29:56] ultimate remember remember these are our
[00:29:59] characters if you want to play in the
[00:30:00] wayand adventure mhm it's up to
[00:30:06] you and every one of them you get a
[00:30:08] Benji whenever you
[00:30:11] play all right let's see I think the
[00:30:13] game was working now I like it
[00:30:19] [Music]
[00:30:33] yeah that's what I'm saying I have to go
[00:30:34] out to Nova Scotia and down from my
[00:30:36] understanding my my family were up in
[00:30:38] New England uh I used to fish out of um
[00:30:40] Massachusetts my dad actually bought his
[00:30:42] boat his fishing boat in Nova scoia he
[00:30:44] was a captain of his own boat so I kind
[00:30:45] of we we've been up that not fished that
[00:30:47] direction but we fish fished out of um
[00:30:50] like Massachusetts in South up to main a
[00:30:53] little bit
[00:30:54] before but pulling in big Nets of stuff
[00:31:00] remember guys you can always play all of
[00:31:01] our other adventure games I still have
[00:31:03] our Originals here our original games
[00:31:07] are still available if you want to be
[00:31:10] you know a tech walking through the
[00:31:12] Wasteland type
[00:31:14] thing we still have all those my goal is
[00:31:17] to have all my games come together at
[00:31:19] one point one easy thing so you say I
[00:31:21] want to play it and it's going to boom
[00:31:22] boom boom right through them nice and
[00:31:23] easily
[00:31:25] [Music]
[00:31:46] ah see I've been on a
[00:31:47] boat um my entire life growing up so I
[00:31:52] always always why I've always wanted to
[00:31:53] be on the ocean you know what I mean
[00:31:56] that type of thing
[00:32:21] oh on a break
[00:32:45] [Music]
[00:32:51] all
[00:32:53] righty oh yeah see like I live um I
[00:32:56] lived in Massachusetts it's right on the
[00:32:58] water because of my dad being a
[00:33:00] fisherman then we used to actually go to
[00:33:01] a lake in New Hampshire all the time so
[00:33:03] I kind of understand what you're talking
[00:33:04] about I knew people in New Hampshire
[00:33:05] like I don't even go the ocean because I
[00:33:06] live on the big lake which like winaki
[00:33:08] over there not big for you obviously you
[00:33:11] know it's probably minuscule compared to
[00:33:13] you Min compared to
[00:33:25] yours all righty
[00:33:29] we'll see if you guys want to jump in
[00:33:31] and hang out we have all of our things
[00:33:33] going I'll run a game here I'll run a
[00:33:35] little Adventure game here in a minute
[00:33:38] maybe somebody will want to run through
[00:33:39] it that's what I'm saying I'm GNA try to
[00:33:40] get it working and
[00:33:42] then yeah see Open Water even in L when
[00:33:45] in Michigan is pretty rough from what
[00:33:47] I've seen
[00:33:48] so you
[00:33:50] know
[00:33:53] right everybody's looking for modern
[00:33:55] Horizon so that's why we're hanging out
[00:33:57] here that's a nice thing though too is
[00:33:58] you get to hang out with me when that
[00:34:01] [Music]
[00:34:05] happens
[00:34:08] way Al righty let's
[00:34:14] see do another one of
[00:34:17] these do another one of these I think
[00:34:19] we'll do another one of these
[00:34:21] here I I grabbed a few of them out to do
[00:34:24] for a minute a little while here so
[00:34:26] we'll keep do opening a handful of them
[00:34:32] the hell was
[00:34:40] [Music]
[00:34:45] that yeah we were unlucky like those

[00:34:50] get mine next week at some
[00:34:55] point yeah I got um I got a bunch boxes
[00:34:58] but
[00:34:59] yeah that's the only thing I'm not lucky
[00:35:01] enough to get them all right
[00:35:03] away which generally ends up making me
[00:35:05] have a problem but who knows we'll see
[00:35:06] what happens here maybe I'll be lucky
[00:35:09] enough one day not to end up uh eating a
[00:35:11] bunch of money at some point I think
[00:35:13] that's my issue and I think I need to
[00:35:14] just B bow out of this

[00:46:54] Wasteland number 24 all here we go 1 2 3
[00:46:59] 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18

[00:47:45] Scout an intelligent
[00:47:47] engineer or a mysterious medic
[00:47:54] [Music]
[00:47:57] can to be an intelligent engineer I like
[00:47:59] it you're an intelligent
[00:48:01] engineer you go wandering through this
[00:48:05] Wasteland and you
[00:48:16] see what do you get you got an agility
[00:48:19] booster you see a Raider in your
[00:48:23] direction oh no a medium Raider comes
[00:48:25] out would you like to use your agility
[00:48:28] booster and your attack against it what
[00:48:31] are you going to do
[00:48:36] serotonin you just want to attack with
[00:48:38] what your fist and what you have you
[00:48:41] have your fist right now you do not have
[00:48:43] a weapon your basic weapon is your brain
[00:48:45] and you do have a slingshot I'm sorry I
[00:48:47] forgot you have a slingshot a high
[00:48:48] powerered slingshot because you're an
[00:48:49] engineer and you can build things so you
[00:48:52] going to choose you're going to use your
[00:48:53] high powerered slingshot or you can use
[00:48:54] your agility booster help maybe to sneak
[00:48:57] around so he doesn't hit you see what
[00:49:00] happens oh
[00:49:02] no I know you're starting it
[00:49:08] off you could die but you do have 130
[00:49:12] health so there's generally only three
[00:49:14] attempts here and they generally can't
[00:49:17] kill you off unless you're low on your
[00:49:19] health
[00:49:21] so okay fight we're going to
[00:49:25] fight you fight the
[00:49:28] Raider you hit the Raider for some
[00:49:30] damage but he hits you also for 15
[00:49:33] damage oh no but that's okay you
[00:49:36] continue on in the Wasteland because
[00:49:37] that Raider runs away because you hit
[00:49:39] him with 12 damage and he's scared of
[00:49:40] you that Raider is scared you've done a
[00:49:43] good job look at that
[00:49:45] serotonin you've made it your way

[00:54:22] Terry steinar I was a catcher so I
[00:54:25] remember him and the other guy there
[00:54:28] Roger
[00:54:32] McDon then you got yourself a Dave
[00:54:36] Gallagher then we have also a um Pedro
[00:54:42] gerro there you
[00:54:44] go some stuff from back in the day pack
[00:54:48] is older than you that's pretty funny
[00:54:50] because you made me look feel really old
[00:54:51] D dude thank you thank you for making me
[00:54:54] feel so old
[00:54:59] so
[00:55:03] old make me feel like a oldest person on
[00:55:06] the
[00:55:10] planet I am I am old though I am getting
[00:55:13] that bit that way not the oldest on the
[00:55:16] planet maybe at some point I will be if
[00:55:17] I'm lucky and be able to be the oldest
[00:55:19] human but N I don't know if I want to be
[00:55:22] though it's one of those things do you
[00:55:23] want to be the oldest one because at
[00:55:24] that point it's like
[00:55:27] the ceiling in the premium loot box
[00:55:32] is um modern Horizon 2 set and home or
[00:55:36] Homeland
[00:55:38] booster modern Horizon 2 or Homeland
[00:55:40] booster is a ceiling out of that premium
[00:55:42] box you should be able to see it in
[00:55:45] there whenever it goes if you go and
[00:55:46] look at the um if you go and look at the
[00:55:47] buy now it'll actually show everything
[00:55:50] exactly in
[00:55:52] there but that's the premium one of that
[00:55:54] now if you want to go one the other ones
[00:55:55] like say the other boxes they have
[00:55:57] different ceilings that's why they're
[00:55:59] all kind of like different ones and then
[00:56:00] the whole point of it is they uh they're
[00:56:02] different parts of the game you know
[00:56:03] because maybe in the
[00:56:07] game you decide
[00:56:11] uh you need some extra help because
[00:56:14] you're getting to a boss and you want to
[00:56:15] go with an ultimate loot box to try to
[00:56:17] get some extra help from it instead
[00:56:20] that's how you play it so let's uh let's

[01:08:01] damage your arm is now even almost

[01:08:37] we were
[01:08:38] attacking you missed the weeling in his
[01:08:41] in his attempt at swinging at you being
[01:08:43] injured tulo the weeding misses you you
[01:08:46] both miss each other
[01:08:49] but you go wandering off in the
[01:08:51] Wasteland you have 70 Health you're
[01:08:54] still able to Mander through further in
[01:08:56] this Wasteland you're almost dead though
[01:08:58] we need somebody to try to help us are
[01:09:00] we going to find an item in one of these
[01:09:02] boxes here can you help us do you want
[01:09:06] to jump in and
[01:09:11] [Music]
[01:09:14] participate Let's see we give you an
[01:09:16] opportunity everybody to take our
[01:09:19] character over and those that take the
[01:09:21] character over get to play the character
[01:09:23] until the next person takes over
[01:09:30] so let's see anyone who want to jump in
[01:09:34] you get to play that loot box you see
[01:09:35] what's in the loot box there lots of
[01:09:38] cool things in the loot box we'll run
[01:09:40] that one more time and this time we're
[01:09:42] going to say hey what are we doing now
[01:09:45] for our
[01:09:47] character we're
[01:09:51] currently do we want to try to go to the
[01:09:53] beginning of the game or do we want to
[01:09:54] see what the next encounter
[01:09:59] is what are we
[01:10:06] doing what is our engineer doing they
[01:10:09] have 70 Health potentially make it
[01:10:11] through the end of the game I don't know
[01:10:13] but they have no weapons they have no
[01:10:15] boosters they've got nothing it's up to
[01:10:17] you to
[01:10:20] help correct correct so for instance say
[01:10:23] you pull out a out of the premium loot
[01:10:25] box you're going to get yourself a lost
[01:10:27] caverns of ixon set pack and on top of
[01:10:30] it you get a critical hit amulet that is
[01:10:32] a 10% critical hit amulet or say you
[01:10:35] decide you know I need to go to that
[01:10:36] ultimate box because I need some good
[01:10:38] help because I'm getting up against a
[01:10:39] boss all right so you go out you go you
[01:10:42] know I'm going to pull out one of these
[01:10:43] from the ultimate box the ultimate box
[01:10:45] is all secret layer stuff and you go
[01:10:47] Prismatic nightmares foil you get and
[01:10:50] then you get a plasma rifle on top of it
[01:10:52] to fight in the game so that's how how
[01:10:56] it goes there you pick the different
[01:10:57] ones out of the box to decide to go
[01:10:59] forward if you're going to play the
[01:11:01] character that is
[01:11:03] correct okay okay exactly so say you
[01:11:06] just want to do a little basic just do
[01:11:08] something try to get something out of
[01:11:10] the box you go you start the game do
[01:11:13] there there's something there you're
[01:11:15] wandering through as a wastelander
[01:11:17] you're like oh this engineer I think I
[01:11:19] can do something here you always get a
[01:11:21] pack always get a pack plus your
[01:11:25] maybe it's a strength
[01:11:27] booster maybe it's a
[01:11:30] critical maybe oh maybe you're get lucky
[01:11:33] and you get an assault rifle actually we
[01:11:35] don't have that in that box it's only a
[01:11:37] pistol
[01:11:38] but you always get your pack of cards
[01:11:42] you never don't get a pack of cards you
[01:11:44] always get a pack of
[01:11:47] cards so whatever is listed in there
[01:11:50] so for instance I do this and you see it
[01:11:55] all those things that are there are
[01:11:56] options unless they've already been
[01:11:57] pulled out I can't update the box
[01:11:59] instantaneously but that's why we put it
[01:12:00] in there so those are all the options
[01:12:02] that are there in the premium box if you
[01:12:05] wanted to try that in the premium one
[01:12:07] you have a chance of getting higher
[01:12:08] things so say uh your boosters are G to
[01:12:11] be plus two instead of plus one you're
[01:12:14] might get an assault rifle instead of a
[01:12:16] pistol or a knife I mean you might get a
[01:12:18] pistol instead of a knife you know that
[01:12:20] type of thing you know that's how it
[01:12:23] goes each of the box has an up Creed
[01:12:27] potential all right so since no one's
[01:12:30] jumping in on it right now I'm going to
[01:12:32] ask what are we going to do with our
[01:12:34] character here in this
[01:12:36] Wasteland what's our next thing we're
[01:12:39] doing okay we we gonna fight are we
[01:12:41] going to go on to the end of the
[01:12:43] Wasteland
[01:12:45] here it's up to
[01:12:48] [Music]
[01:12:50] you well I
[01:12:52] say CU Chad is not really giving me an
[01:12:55] answer I'm going to see this intelligent
[01:12:58] engineer is going to continue to fight
[01:13:00] to see what happens and they encounter a
[01:13:02] feral
[01:13:03] ghoul oh my the engineer has encountered
[01:13:06] a feral ghoul hopefully they can make it
[01:13:09] through with their 70 he since no one
[01:13:11] has attempted to help them so far that
[01:13:14] Ferro goou attacks
[01:13:17] you and you miss the feral goou yourself
[01:13:20] because you're so injured but he hits
[01:13:22] you for 15
[01:13:23] damage oh oh
[01:13:26] no you keep wandering through that
[01:13:29] Wasteland you are that Ferro ghou whacks
[01:13:31] you again you're over on the ground he
[01:13:34] thinks you're dead so he just wanders
[01:13:36] away you lay there for a little while as
[01:13:39] an intelligent engineer you used to have
[01:13:41] 130 40 strength you're now down to 100
[01:13:43] you're down to
[01:13:44] 55 because no one has helped you in this
[01:13:48] Wasteland do anything to make your
[01:13:50] chances better or help you get a a
[01:13:52] booster of any kind or pack health pack
[01:13:54] who knows

[01:14:30] I'll run that for a little bit and if
[01:14:31] you want to jump in then remember you
[01:14:33] can do that but what I'm going to say
[01:14:35] right now is let's see what goes on

[01:14:38] Wasteland since no one has decided us
[01:14:39] what to do remember you guys can help me
[01:14:41] right now and
[01:14:42] chat so we're gonna go on we have
[01:14:44] nothing here we have a gator Dow in

[01:14:50] Wasteland a gator Dow is in front of
[01:14:54] you you have to fight the gator dowo
[01:14:57] right now cuz there are no options there

[01:27:51] through you made it all the way to the
[01:27:52] boss the game's a little glitch right
[01:27:54] now so uh it allows you to get to the
[01:27:56] boss a little quicker but that's okay
[01:28:28] my goal is to have actually the games on
[01:28:30] my own website at one point and then so
[01:28:32] when anything happens it'll always go
[01:28:34] through and it'll
[01:28:38] work no one has beaten the whole thing
[01:28:40] yet that's actually brand new I started
[01:28:41] it on uh a couple days ago so no one's
[01:28:44] actually I haven't had too many people
[01:28:45] playing it just because uh think
[01:28:47] everybody's looking for modern Horizon 3
[01:28:49] so I don't have I I don't get that until
[01:28:51] next week so I think that's what I'm
[01:28:53] running into is a lot of people are

[01:49:32] the agility
[01:49:37] booster use an agility booster and you

[01:49:43] booster allows you to hit the gator dowo
[01:49:45] for 13
[01:49:46] damage but that Gator Dill hits you for
[01:49:49] three damage bring you down to
[01:49:51] one 34 for your health oh no but that's

[01:50:29] time the gator Dillo hits

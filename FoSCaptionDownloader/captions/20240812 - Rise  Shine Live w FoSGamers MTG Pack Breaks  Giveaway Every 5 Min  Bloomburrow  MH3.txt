[00:03:39] sleepy pulled a Jays
[00:03:46] nice yes that is rather Cody's mom I
[00:03:49] will have to say that is rather
[00:03:50] intriguing that your name and and your
[00:03:52] husband's name like my H your husband is
[00:03:55] my name and your name is my wife's name
[00:03:57] but she spells it differently hers is
[00:03:58] with an F not a pH
[00:04:00] so I'm guessing that yours is with a
[00:04:04] pH that's one of those weird coincidence
[00:04:07] things in the world that all like
[00:04:08] happens every now and again you
[00:04:11] know now try those check-ins if you guys

[00:34:44] now remember yeah it should be a good
[00:34:46] time we're gonna do the home school
[00:34:48] thing that's what made me think of that
[00:34:50] uh Mr Fong cause I used to be a teacher
[00:34:53] um and having been a teacher before in
[00:34:54] the past I know that we can I know the
[00:34:56] things that we can and cannot do and I I
[00:34:58] know uh we can teach a little bit better
[00:35:01] than what we've been getting is what
[00:35:02] we're getting
[00:35:04] at nice yes I know I was told that Cody

[00:35:35] 184 Forest a g ass salt foil then a
[00:35:40] otter token
[00:35:48] there yes we are all over the place hey
[00:35:50] haward how's it going my friend yeah
[00:35:52] we're kind of all over the place so what
[00:35:54] we'll end up doing is traveling around
[00:35:55] the first for the first like few months
[00:35:57] it'll be between Florida and the
[00:35:58] Caribbean get I mean in the um in the
[00:36:00] Bahamas get my family used to it on the
[00:36:02] boat and stuff now after that after you
[00:36:04] know a few months later we'll start
[00:36:06] traveling around the rest of the
[00:36:07] Caribbean uh for a few years then
[00:36:10] eventually the point the goal is to uh
[00:36:11] travel around the world now hopefully by
[00:36:13] then we'll be able to get the new boat
[00:36:14] that we want which is uh part of the
[00:36:17] reason
[00:36:20] why we're doing what we're doing as
[00:36:23] we'll be able to travel around and uh
[00:36:25] one of the things that I have is the
[00:36:26] boat we had a boat that I was intrigued
[00:36:28] by and I want to get but it's way out of
[00:36:30] my budget right now I could buy it but
[00:36:33] i' have to I'd have to do a loan and I
[00:36:35] don't want to do Alan so I'm like I'm
[00:36:37] going to wait until some of the stuff
[00:36:38] that I have in stock that a company I
[00:36:40] used to work for gets available to sell
[00:36:41] and I'm going to do
[00:36:42] that I'm gonna still do this yes Mr
[00:36:46] Fong so the point what I plan on
[00:36:53] doing yeah the boats don't come back
[00:36:55] from The Bu triangle you got to watch
[00:36:57] out for that so what I plan on doing
[00:36:58] that's why we have the warehouse we need
[00:37:00] to get is we're going to have um we'll
[00:37:02] have some of the things you'll be able
[00:37:03] to buy in the warehouse regularly um
[00:37:05] like a lot more product on a regular
[00:37:07] basis so you can buy it from the store
[00:37:09] whenever you want um you know have it
[00:37:11] shipped to your house open it up
[00:37:12] yourself um or if we happen to be doing
[00:37:15] anything and we're doing our live
[00:37:16] streams like we do in the mornings we'll
[00:37:18] be doing it and it will be um it'll
[00:37:20] probably be where I have uh like boxes
[00:37:22] uh not as many as I do now uh but I'll
[00:37:25] have some stuff and it'll be kind of
[00:37:27] directed towards like the new releases
[00:37:29] or a special thing that's going on one
[00:37:31] two 3 four five six seven eight that way
[00:37:35] I don't have to have as much stock on
[00:37:36] the boat then we'll still do the
[00:37:38] openings and um I have the warehouse
[00:37:40] what I'll end up doing is everything
[00:37:41] will get shipped to the warehouse and
[00:37:42] then it gets drop shipped from there to
[00:37:43] you

[01:23:15] know somebody was looking for those and
[01:23:16] a dark star augur put the carrot cake
[01:23:18] off to the side somebody was looking for
[01:23:19] a bunch of those
[01:23:24] yeah see our public we we could we want
[01:23:26] to do private or um the charter schools
[01:23:29] but the way that things are set up here
[01:23:31] in Florida there's such a list to get
[01:23:34] into them that my kids aren't going to
[01:23:35] get like have a hard chance of getting
[01:23:37] into it they're like it's like pretty
[01:23:38] much a lottery to get in any of the
[01:23:40] private schools or uh or Charter Schools
[01:23:43] so we're actually with the fact that
[01:23:45] we're leaving and doing the boat thing
[01:23:46] we're just gonna I'm just gonna
[01:23:47] homeschool them and I know they're going
[01:23:49] to even get a better education than that
[01:23:50] because having being a teacher having a
[01:23:53] larger IQ I know my kids are SM smart
[01:23:55] too we're going to teach to them we're
[01:23:57] not going to teach to the
[01:23:59] [ __ ] Common Core that needs to make
[01:24:01] everybody
[01:24:06] dumb but they're going to remember
[01:24:08] everything they learn because we're
[01:24:09] going to be teaching them about where we
[01:24:10] are and the stuff we're at so it's going
[01:24:11] to be like so it's going to make sense
[01:24:13] we'll talk about fish when we're out and
[01:24:15] doing scuba diving we'll talk about
[01:24:17] ancient ruins and stuff history when
[01:24:19] we're out at a place like that one two
[01:24:21] three four five 6 7 8 you know that type
[01:24:25] of
[01:24:26] thing and when we're when we're on the
[01:24:28] boat we're traveling around say we're on
[01:24:29] an island we'll teach them about you
[01:24:30] know ecology with the or teach maybe
[01:24:32] we'll use uh you know use the sails as
[01:24:35] for some geometry and uh and wind and
[01:24:38] how the wind pulls on them and things

[01:25:20] school growing up my mom rent actually
[01:25:22] drove the buses the schools were great
[01:25:24] when I was younger I just feel like
[01:25:26] there's
[01:25:27] uh just since Common Core I will have to
[01:25:30] say I have I have found that it is
[01:25:33] uh
[01:25:35] harder for children to learn effectively
[01:25:39] than they used to I'll just leave it at
[01:25:42] that I was a teacher and I was at the
[01:25:45] schools and I saw some of the things
[01:25:46] that were done over the years in
[01:25:47] multiple schools until I got the
[01:25:49] full-time job and even when I got the
[01:25:50] full-time job I was like what is going
[01:25:52] on so you know to each own right 1 two 3
[01:25:56] 4 five six seven eight like I went to a
[01:26:00] uh public schools and then on high
[01:26:01] school I went to a private school just
[01:26:03] because I happen to get a scholarship to
[01:26:04] go there if I didn't have the
[01:26:05] scholarship I wouldn't have been able to
[01:26:06] go there I was I'm poor kid you
[01:26:10] know hey now you're about there you
[01:26:16] go yeah exactly you don't want to get
[01:26:18] into politics stuff exactly I just want
[01:26:19] to stay away from that I just my I
[01:26:21] personally we're teach our kids and
[01:26:23] we'll make them we'll teach them well I
[01:26:24] they'll know a lot more than they would
[01:26:26] have coming out of the uh the public

[01:26:52] there spire spell JY in that art card
[01:26:56] that we saw before yeah I know I like I
[01:26:58] I was part of schools I taught and I did
[01:27:00] all that stuff I had a great at time
[01:27:01] with it uh it's just my you know my
[01:27:03] opinion on how I'd rather have my kids
[01:27:05] taught a different way where they learn
[01:27:07] about everything and then they make a
[01:27:09] decision on what they want to do with
[01:27:10] their life rather than um somebody
[01:27:12] telling them this is what you should be
[01:27:14] doing with your life if that makes any
[01:27:17] sense so I do feel like a lot of it
[01:27:20] that's I want them to have an expansive
[01:27:23] knowledge like I had
[01:27:25] um you know I I there's things that I
[01:27:26] knew that even my wife coming out of
[01:27:28] public school just because I go a
[01:27:29] private one she's like what are you
[01:27:30] talking about like oh it's like you've
[01:27:32] never heard of these people i' talk
[01:27:34] about maybe you know some ancient
[01:27:36] history things or uh you know like Plato
[01:27:39] or Socrates stuff and I'll make a quote
[01:27:42] and like what is that and she like I
[01:27:43] never even learned about that person
[01:27:44] until like I started talking about it so
[01:27:46] that's part of the reason why like
[01:27:47] certain places I'm not saying that she
[01:27:49] learned she learned a lot of great
[01:27:50] things she's a very smart woman it was
[01:27:52] just like she didn't know those things
[01:27:53] and I think to be a well-rounded person
[01:27:56] that um I feel like my children should
[01:27:57] have that some of that stuff for
[01:27:59] knowledge but here we go this is what we
[01:28:00] got out of our our right

[01:29:18] we said oh well that
[01:29:21] sucks yes I I'd be serving 20 to life if
[01:29:23] that happened to me yeah yeah see I'm um
[01:29:26] that's part of the reason why I'm
[01:29:28] leaving is because I want my T kids out
[01:29:30] is because we had a couple issues where
[01:29:31] my youngest um he got glasses and he
[01:29:33] start getting kind of get made fun of
[01:29:35] all right our winner Cody's Mom I need
[01:29:36] number between one and 10 if you don't
[01:29:39] mind one two three four five six seven
[01:29:42] eight nine 10 number
[01:29:46] nine so like he had a couple issues in
[01:29:48] school where kids uh like made fun of
[01:29:50] him after he got glasses and I was like
[01:29:52] all right well tolerate it to to an
[01:29:54] extent but if they touch you or they do
[01:29:56] anything to you you can break their nose
[01:29:58] and I will back you up the entire time
[01:30:01] because they touched you and you
[01:30:02] defending yourself well one of the kids
[01:30:04] ended up swiping his glasses off his
[01:30:06] face at one point so my kid laid him out
[01:30:10] and he got in trouble and I'm like what
[01:30:12] is the problem here so the other kid hit
[01:30:13] him in the face and he pushed him over
[01:30:16] to the point pretty much the kid was off
[01:30:17] the ground about a couple feet in the
[01:30:19] air and was thrown back like three feet
[01:30:21] or four feet and my son picked up his
[01:30:23] glasses said don't ever touch me and so
[01:30:27] I don't see what the problem is here you
[01:30:29] as a teachers did not handle it my son
[01:30:31] did and a couple other scenarios like
[01:30:33] that occurred and I'm like you know what
[01:30:34] we're done with this [ __ ] he's already
[01:30:37] at the at Middle School level in some of
[01:30:39] his classes and you're teaching them
[01:30:40] still at his fourth grade level which is
[01:30:42] why he's bored in class so we're done
[01:30:45] with this
[01:30:46] crap one two 3 four five six seven
[01:30:52] eight oh I'm not saying they didn't want
[01:30:54] Karate Kid or anything but like I mean I
[01:30:56] I I was taught Judo and stuff so I'm
[01:30:58] going to I plan on teaching my kids how
[01:31:00] to fight when they're a little bit older
[01:31:07] here oh yeah the school I know War

[01:31:34] there swamp light shell Duo and a rat
[01:31:37] token yeah so like for
[01:31:41] me that was like kind of like I'm tired
[01:31:43] of this crap you
[01:31:45] know so if I'm going to have to deal
[01:31:47] this regularly I don't want to it's
[01:31:50] really what I boil it down to
[01:31:54] yeah see I did um I did Karate for a
[01:31:56] little bit when I was younger but then
[01:31:57] when I got into high school I wrestled
[01:31:58] and my coach was a
[01:32:02] um I know exactly I don't think he
[01:32:03] should have got in trouble he was
[01:32:05] defending himself but because his like a
[01:32:06] no policy on touching people he got in
[01:32:08] trouble like so what about the other
[01:32:10] person how about like how about suspend
[01:32:12] the other person for initiating while
[01:32:14] that person is like it's a troubled
[01:32:15] person I'm like I don't give a if
[01:32:17] they're troubled next time that means my
[01:32:19] kid's just going to beat the F out of
[01:32:20] them since they're troubled and give
[01:32:21] them a goddamn lesson not to touch
[01:32:23] someone since you [ __ ]
[01:32:29] won't yeah so that's pretty much what I
[01:32:32] ended up doing when I was younger Cody
[01:32:33] um I learned karate a little bit and a
[01:32:35] couple times when I was younger I had a
[01:32:37] couple people that attacked me just
[01:32:38] being bullies and I ended up having him
[01:32:40] in a headlock being like I'm not
[01:32:41] fighting you leave me f alone leave me
[01:32:43] alone leave me alone and I ended up
[01:32:45] having teachers coming and breaking it
[01:32:47] up while I had him in a headlock and
[01:32:49] like my legs wrapped around until they
[01:32:50] can't move then I ended up going to
[01:32:51] wrestling in high school and at that
[01:32:53] point people people actually stopped
[01:32:54] bothering me because they saw me and I
[01:32:56] actually placed third in the state of
[01:32:57] Massachusetts when I was uh in my senior
[01:32:59] year so like at that like when I was
[01:33:02] like wrestling in high school that's
[01:33:03] when people stopped even giving me a
[01:33:04] hard time at all one two three four five
[01:33:07] six seven eight they probably realize I
[01:33:09] knew how to defend myself at that point
[01:33:12] since my coach coach was in the Olympics
[01:33:14] for Judo and a couple of people uh the
[01:33:17] the father and the brother of one of the
[01:33:19] guys I wrestled with was in the Olympics
[01:33:21] for Judo and he would have been in the
[01:33:23] Olympics for Judo the kid that I
[01:33:24] wrestled with but he ended up breaking
[01:33:26] his back in college so he didn't get to
[01:33:32] play got attracted by a trouble kid he
[01:33:34] had also told my son and others about
[01:33:36] come and watch child serpent got
[01:33:41] involved oh wow that's Inc incredible
[01:33:44] that's
[01:33:44] crazy it was great for self-defense but
[01:33:47] also mature me and teaching me how to
[01:33:48] respect yeah highly recommend it yeah

[01:35:27] what do you do if you find a baby mouse
[01:35:29] that is live and not moving um well is
[01:35:33] it is it dead so it's it's alive but not
[01:35:35] moving I would probably
[01:35:39] um where did you find it was it like on
[01:35:42] the ground
[01:35:47] somewhere senior came had big problem me
[01:35:49] for some reason and when he tried to
[01:35:50] fight me I had uh ah nice there you go
[01:35:55] there you go
[01:35:57] Cody
[01:36:00] see oh no worries no worries I
[01:36:03] understand that so I would say morbid
[01:36:06] Mouse I would say um if it's alive try
[01:36:10] to see if you can leave it if there's
[01:36:12] like a nest around because if there is
[01:36:15] maybe the mother will come and get it
[01:36:16] and leave it alone but if there's no
[01:36:17] Nest around that you can
[01:36:20] see maybe uh see pick it up if you want
[01:36:23] to um if you want to try to keep it
[01:36:25] alive and see if you can give it some
[01:36:27] water or uh I don't know maybe a little
[01:36:29] bit of milk or something see if there's
[01:36:31] something that you can get it to keep it
[01:36:40] live that little mouse CPR is yeah one
[01:36:44] two three four five six seven eight yeah
[01:36:48] wrestling does help Cody when you uh
[01:36:50] when you have a little bit of uh some
[01:36:51] knowledge there all was able to like I
[01:36:54] had a couple times some issues and then
[01:36:56] shortly ended once I was able to do a
[01:36:59] couple moves that pretty much I took
[01:37:01] them down threw them to the ground I'm

[01:37:33] moonrise cleric with a tender wild guide
[01:37:37] it came in handy I will say in college
[01:37:38] because I ended up joining a fraternity
[01:37:40] and there was a couple of scenarios
[01:37:41] where uh the wrestling definitely came
[01:37:43] in handy some guy that was like some kid
[01:37:45] was like he was hammered and he was at a
[01:37:47] party one time and I we to get rid of
[01:37:49] him because long story short he hit one

[01:38:35] I threw out great I was going to take
[01:38:37] him out and it was awesome one of the
[01:38:39] brothers that was in the front of the
[01:38:40] house saw it happen because they were
[01:38:41] walking out on the side of the house he
[01:38:43] ended up I've never seen it was like a
[01:38:45] movie he put his hand down on the side
[01:38:47] of um on the side of the fence and it
[01:38:50] was like an up he just jumped up and
[01:38:52] went over and clocked the guy in the
[01:38:54] face out cold on the ground I was like
[01:38:57] pick your [ __ ] friend up and get out
[01:38:58] of here because if you don't that's
[01:38:59] going to happen all to that the rest of
[01:39:01] the two of you I've never seen two
[01:39:03] people pick up a body sling it over
[01:39:05] their shoulder and run as fast in my
[01:39:06] life as I've ever
[01:39:13] seen yeah exactly exactly Cody if you
[01:39:16] know what you're doing

[01:39:28] punched him out cold out
[01:39:31] cold but yeah I I try that with the uh
[01:39:34] the CPR thing or maybe a little bit of
[01:39:35] water something like that all right a
[01:39:38] goodway's going here let's see who it's
[01:39:39] going to be
[01:39:43] is going to stinking Lincoln got into
[01:39:48] the flood M all right not the big hit
[01:39:49] but that's okay it's okay stinking
[01:39:52] because it gets you a discount on your
[01:39:59] shipping and I'm going to have to start
[01:40:01] getting off a little earlier than I
[01:40:03] normally do just because we have to
[01:40:04] clean up my house to get out of the
[01:40:07] house in like 16 days is so with that
[01:40:11] being said I'm not going to be able to
[01:40:12] be on as late as I normally am all the
[01:40:14] time normally on until like oneish noon
[01:40:17] or one but I have to get off a little
[01:40:18] earlier now to do some
[01:40:21] things all right we got number one 1 two
[01:40:23] three and four for our giveaway going
[01:40:26] out right now due to our buddy stinking
[01:40:28] lincol give me a nice number
[01:40:41] there yeah there you go o hey that'll
[01:40:44] work that'll
[01:40:47] work yeah I try maybe if it's not moving
[01:40:49] or eating it's probably because it's
[01:40:51] really weak from like either not being
[01:40:52] around mom to get some food so maybe
[01:40:54] look online and see if you can find um
[01:40:58] what to give it I'm guessing some type
[01:40:59] of milk a little bit of milk might help
[01:41:02] is what my guess
[01:41:11] is yeah it's probably um it's probably
[01:41:14] very weak from falling I'm guessing it
[01:41:15] was crawling somewhere and it fell and
[01:41:18] so it's probably very weak and concussed
[01:41:20] and that type of thing and what I would
[01:41:22] suspect is you're going to need to um
[01:41:24] one two three four five six seven eight
[01:41:27] I'm suspecting that mom lost him or
[01:41:30] didn't go after him after he fell and
[01:41:32] you're gonna have to do a little bit of
[01:41:33] work

[01:44:16] on I have no idea I think it was on one
[01:44:18] of the norm I'm older that enough that I
[01:44:21] think it was on like one of the regular
[01:44:22] like eight like five six and 10 or
[01:44:24] whatever you happen to be ABC you know
[01:44:27] NBC or Fox I think it was on one of
[01:44:29] those I'm I'm that old if that makes any
[01:44:32] sense all right so so far we got out of
[01:44:34] this side a gev scaled
[01:44:38] Scorch a hired claw all right this is
[01:44:42] the left side here yeah I'm I'm almost
[01:44:46] 40 so I might have been seeing it I did
[01:44:49] I do remember seeing it on Boomerang
[01:44:50] when I was older but
[01:44:54] yeah I'm on the older side
[01:44:56] here I'm not as I'm not a young spring
[01:44:58] chicken if you think I am I appreciate
[01:45:00] it thank you that makes me feel
[01:45:06] better in Keeper's Talent there you go
[01:45:09] my favorite thing though is uh when
[01:45:12] people are like I was um so I started a
[01:45:16] job and people the guy at the job I was
[01:45:19] 30 when I I turned 30 happened to
[01:45:20] starting a job like almost 10 years ago
[01:45:22] and one of the people goes oh happy
[01:45:24] birthday it's like uh like uh made it
[01:45:26] some comment how old I was and he
[01:45:27] thought I was as old as the other people
[01:45:28] that were there he's like thought I was
[01:45:30] 40 because I had a beard I have a beard
[01:45:32] on a regular basis because it's just
[01:45:34] this grow I get five five o'clock shadow
[01:45:37] if I shave at like noon yeah at actually
[01:45:40] generally around like 8 am even I get it
[01:45:42] all right here we go we got our handbone
[01:45:45] got a life Creed Duo
[01:45:53] hone
[01:45:55] 03 hone
[01:45:58] O2 thank you my friend we're going to go
[01:46:01] with number nine I like
[01:46:03] it now so people they always thought I
[01:46:07] was older so you thought he thought I
[01:46:08] was 40 I I was turning 30 and he goes oh
[01:46:11] like this gonna be over the hill on the
[01:46:13] 40th birthday I'm like you think I'm 40
[01:46:17] what the hell so I guess people find me
[01:46:20] either over more mature than I normally
[01:46:22] am based on how I
[01:46:24] looked and the other day I had
[01:46:27] uh the doctor that I went to see thought
[01:46:29] I was in the military too because of how
[01:46:31] I hold myself he said I hold myself he
[01:46:33] thought I was in the military which was
[01:46:34] an intriguing comment so I'm either
[01:46:36] older or I'm in the military which is
[01:46:38] the weirdest thing I've ever had because
[01:46:39] I'm I'm not old well I am now not old
[01:46:43] old but then I'm also never been there
[01:46:45] that a weird thing he said it was a
[01:46:46] compliment I'm taking it as a compliment
[01:46:48] too but it was one of those weird ones
[01:46:50] where it's like huh I don't understand
[01:46:51] where that came from but uh you know
[01:46:53] somebody made a comment to me like I I
[01:46:55] guess I stand up straight all the time
[01:46:56] and I I always have my shoulders back
[01:46:58] and I stand up straight and I like I
[01:47:00] shake people's hands when I when they
[01:47:01] come in the in a room I'll stand up
[01:47:03] straight Shake someone hand say nice to
[01:47:04] meet you and stuff like that so I guess
[01:47:06] that's part of the one two three four
[01:47:09] five six seven eight that's maybe the
[01:47:11] reason why my wife seems to think that
[01:47:13] might be the reason why people think
[01:47:14] that because I stand up and I use
[01:47:17] manners like somebody that would be
[01:47:19] older
[01:47:22] yeah 30 to 70 see exactly yep I get that
[01:47:25] Cody I understand that s like has Brew
[01:47:30] seed pod Squire so like on a regular
[01:47:32] basis people used to uh always think I
[01:47:36] was older or other stuff I mean when I
[01:47:38] lifeguarded I had a guy that offered me
[01:47:40] to go offered to give me anytime he
[01:47:42] wanted I could go to his um his Villa in
[01:47:45] Italy at his Vineyard I was 18 at the
[01:47:47] time I don't want to do [ __ ] like that
[01:47:49] that seems boring as hell I wish I
[01:47:50] remember that guy now though one of the
[01:47:52] coolest things he invited me every year

[02:41:27] [Music]
[02:41:32] though trying to think I think I might
[02:41:35] have pulled it out for somebody that
[02:41:36] might be what it
[02:41:42] is but we're going to put this out for
[02:41:45] instead of

[02:41:56] necro Duality I do not have that I know

[02:42:32] that I can't help it it will end up
[02:42:34] going at like a higher price just due to

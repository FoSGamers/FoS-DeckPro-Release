New idea. How to have an application, or a script, or a website that will have the opposite of articles, news articles online, and it will replace words with the opposite version of them so that people can get a different reaction. So an example would be they replace the color of a person from black to white, or from white to black. Or they replace their race from Hispanic to Caucasian, or African-American to Caucasian, or Caucasian to African-American, or something along those lines. That way we can show how ridiculous these news articles are and how they are essentializing titles to just cause a problem versus actually telling news.

Jamey has a new idea for an application, script, or website that will take news articles and replace words with their opposite versions to highlight how sensationalized news articles can be. For example, replacing the color of a person from black to white or white to black, or their race from Hispanic to Caucasian, African-American to Caucasian, or Caucasian to African-American, to show the absurdity of such essentializing titles.

Got it, Jamey! Here's a brief summary of your new idea:

You want to create an application, script, or website that takes news articles and replaces specific words with their opposite versions. This tool would help highlight the sensationalism in news articles by making changes such as:
- Changing the color of a person from black to white, or white to black.
- Changing the race of a person from Hispanic to Caucasian, African-American to Caucasian, or Caucasian to African-American.

This approach aims to show how these articles are essentializing titles to cause problems rather than telling the news.

Would you like to explore this idea further, perhaps by discussing technical requirements or implementation strategies?

New idea, an audio music generator that will listen to music that you are providing it through YouTube links or something along that line or have it search the YouTube for most popular music videos and be able to figure out that type of music and generate something similar in regards to the sound of the current music that is there or the one that you gave it as an example. Similar enough that it will be people liking it but different enough that no one will get in trouble for copyright.

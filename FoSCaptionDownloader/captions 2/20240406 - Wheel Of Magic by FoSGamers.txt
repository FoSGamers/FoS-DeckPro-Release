[00:10:39] probably uh last year sets of them
[00:10:42] coming out and they're all legendary I
[00:10:45] think they're legendaries or like high
[00:10:47] value cards um that most people would
[00:10:50] kind of know if that makes any sense um
[00:10:53] like cards that people talk about or ask

[00:23:49] annoying because it wasn't doing it
[00:23:51] before can you put it over your face
[00:23:53] instead no it's the wheel is um I think
[00:23:56] the wheel the wheel was is works fine

[00:24:03] shrink it yeah yeah I'll shrink it

[00:29:51] one on the fastest one we
[00:29:53] have there's no one in our house there's
[00:29:57] no one in our house right now I think

[00:30:09] have fiber soon we will have fiber hey
[00:30:13] occasions we got this up here right now

[00:30:24] couple letters there he's got a 700 at
[00:30:26] the
[00:30:26] moment no one else is up there yet we'll
[00:30:33] see it is yes good for the digestion
[00:30:35] well at least that's good for the
[00:30:36] digestion you know uh lots of fiber is
[00:30:40] no I was looking for no there's a uh

[00:31:05] problem somewhere in the house in the in
[00:31:06] the neighborhood like problem like one

[00:35:43] have all kinds of stuff in the buy now
[00:35:44] you can just let me know which ones you
[00:35:45] want and I can throw them in there I
[00:35:48] know these days are kind of on the
[00:35:49] slower side because people are probably
[00:35:51] looking for the newer product and stuff
[00:35:53] but um I figured at least I'm going to
[00:35:54] try this out because and see if you guys
[00:35:56] are liking what we're doing doing here
[00:35:58] having some fun hopefully you're liking
[00:36:01] what we're doing we're going to do this
[00:36:03] one here try
[00:36:07] another just a little
[00:36:15] one all right so uh Lord the ring
[00:36:18] special edition they are 44 and know um
[00:36:21] W collectors are
[00:36:25] 24 so those are the those are the prices
[00:36:27] on those ones I can throw one of those
[00:36:29] right up after uh after this is
[00:36:31] over hey nightow hopefully it's better

[00:36:40] of them
[00:36:41] left only have three of them left and I
[00:36:43] don't know when I'll be getting more of
[00:36:44] those so that is definitely a uh hot
[00:36:48] commodity that I have not decided if I'm
[00:36:50] going to pick up again so you got
[00:36:53] three two on the right and one on the
[00:36:56] left

[00:41:17] Frozen on screen I'm fine here on this
[00:41:21] is the web this is the internet causing
[00:41:24] a problem right

[00:43:48] use it our using the uh the internally
[00:43:50] built wheel here hopefully that makes it
[00:43:53] thr randomizer there we

[00:48:46] when I run a test after the with this
[00:48:48] not running I get one gig download and
[00:48:52] 550 mag
[00:48:54] upload so I'm just like I'm thoroughly

[00:49:01] off oh my
[00:49:05] God let me uh get the seller tools up
[00:49:08] here let me see if the randomizer still
[00:49:10] there all right it is still
[00:49:13] here and it's
[00:49:21] gonna I guess tonight I'm not supposed
[00:49:24] to do

[00:50:03] one so that worked but you can at least
[00:50:06] kind of hear me so all right spun
[00:50:10] 700 we're going to hide the
[00:50:15] randomizer we're going to see uh what is
[00:50:18] your number or your letter you're going
[00:50:19] to go with and I will put it out there
[00:50:22] if it is up

[00:55:19] everybody knows everything I'm I'm not
[00:55:21] great with this and it's easier when you
[00:55:22] have when you can go through it quicker
[00:55:24] and you have like a group of people
[00:55:25] that's like mov moving through it so I
[00:55:27] was trying to figure out if this you
[00:55:28] know being a new game just trying
[00:55:30] something new out and it's also a time
[00:55:32] frame that's not normal for me so it's
[00:55:34] another thing that's a little different
[00:55:35] you're stumped the stumped part of it
[00:55:39] is not hard actually it's new it's
[00:55:45] new it's a new one it's a place yeah new
[00:55:48] newer and it's a place I'd
[00:55:51] say um one two
[00:55:54] three within the last four four
[00:55:59] sets
[00:56:04] huh yeah this year
[00:56:09] 2024 this is in from
[00:56:14] 2024 blank blank e correct yes blank
[00:56:18] blank e it's n the top four on the
[00:56:24] bottom yep
[00:56:26] yep we can want to pull it in closer we
[00:56:29] can pull it in a a little closer
[00:56:31] possibly on that hold it a little
[00:56:37] closer it is that better I think that's
[00:56:40] better glaring nine and four okay yeah
[00:56:44] great all right that's better that's
[00:56:48] better all right
[00:56:50] there that's better there you
[00:56:54] go yeah we can help make it a little bit
[00:56:57] better closer and the plan is that um
[00:57:00] instead of the Whiteboard we're going to
[00:57:02] end up having my uh my green screen up
[00:57:06] and Steph will be able to walk over and
[00:57:08] press on it and like the green screen
[00:57:09] it'll spin spin the uh the the letter
[00:57:13] around wheel I guess we're gonna have to
[00:57:16] make a wheel though yeah it's to
[00:57:19] apparently we need to make a
[00:57:23] wheel well that's what I was saying

[01:44:38] little bit of fun for a little while
[01:44:40] that was a good card game there I
[01:44:41] actually think this could be something
[01:44:42] we could do in the morning yeah I could
[01:44:44] probably do this in the morning like
[01:44:45] this pretty
[01:44:46] easily it's
[01:44:51] quick no
[01:44:56] there FR we can do it on
[01:45:00] Friday all right no one wanted this
[01:45:03] we'll put it back we'll do
[01:45:09] um I don't know let's see maybe somebody
[01:45:12] would like a uh Exelon
[01:45:19] here and we're going to put that out
[01:45:21] with
[01:45:24] ay Commander Legends draft let's do that
[01:45:28] let's do
[01:45:30] that maybe that's something you guys
[01:45:32] would be interested in to do with our
[01:45:35] new newest
[01:45:37] puzzle how's it going collectible old
[01:45:41] man I know I gotta take my glasses off
[01:45:43] when I read on things all the time how
[01:45:46] have you
[01:45:51] been we're doing a we're doing a a nice
[01:45:54] Wheel of Fortune game Wheel of magic you
[01:45:58] de wheel of Magic game we're calling it
[01:46:00] wheel of magic because we use magic
[01:46:03] cards and what their names are and the
[01:46:05] character's name or the card name is
[01:46:07] what is what's used up on the board
[01:46:08] there and I always give you the hint
[01:46:11] right now the hint is creature and it's
[01:46:12] from
[01:46:14] CMM somebody might even be able to
[01:46:16] figure it out just by looking at it but
[01:46:18] that's okay I figure we can have some
[01:46:20] fun here anybody here might want to play
[01:46:23] Andrew we're doing uh thanks for coming
[01:46:26] in we're doing these uh doing some doing
[01:46:29] our having some fun we already did one
[01:46:31] round of
[01:46:32] this and the fun thing is those that
[01:46:35] when you win you get to uh you get to
[01:46:37] pick some things that we do next so it's
[01:46:40] uh you get to you get to pick your own
[01:46:42] thing so we'll try this for a little
[01:46:44] while longer see how it goes we did have
[01:46:47] a little bit of fun here with it the
[01:46:49] last time and I think what I'll put out
[01:46:52] next
[01:46:54] is we'll put on another time spiral
[01:46:56] let's put out a time
[01:46:58] spiral I like time spiral we'll put that
[01:47:01] baby out
[01:47:02] there think you know
[01:47:05] [Laughter]
[01:47:07] it that's funny it's uh well I gave a
[01:47:11] good hint here I gave a lot e better
[01:47:14] hint than I could I probably should have
[01:47:16] quite frankly after I said CMM I'm like
[01:47:18] ah I probably should have did that soon
[01:47:21] as I said CMM I'm like oh
[01:47:23] a that was too easy that was too easy I
[01:47:27] should have let it left that creature
[01:47:29] from something from the from an
[01:47:30] expensive set is what I should have left
[01:47:32] it
[01:47:35] as he thinks he knows what it is and as
[01:47:37] soon as I said that and then they saw
[01:47:39] the comment everything I bet most people
[01:47:40] be able figure it
[01:47:43] out oh you were thinking Lord of the
[01:47:45] Rings at first okay see see exactly
[01:47:48] that's that's what it would have been
[01:47:49] see that's what I was trying I didn't
[01:47:50] want to say all all of them because yeah
[01:47:55] because that's what I was figuring I
[01:47:56] figured everybody would give some a
[01:47:58] little bit of trickery for what the word
[01:47:59] could be or the or the card the card the
[01:48:03] card
[01:48:04] so we'll give everybody some chance here
[01:48:07] if you guys want to jump in and play and
[01:48:09] if nobody dumps in in a little bit I'll
[01:48:11] let you I'll let you try house and see
[01:48:12] if you can solve it and we'll throw
[01:48:13] we'll just throw out a different
[01:48:21] one
[01:48:25] I know I thought for sure somebody would
[01:48:27] jump in on one of
[01:48:29] these got this is a pretty easy one
[01:48:31] that's why I made it on the easier side
[01:48:33] I figured uh we could get some people
[01:48:34] jumping in right away being an easier
[01:48:36] side one
[01:48:37] but it's one of those things like the
[01:48:39] days I'm not used to the day ones and I
[01:48:41] think days we need people to do um I
[01:48:43] need to have like some type of uh quick
[01:48:46] moving um either singles or something
[01:48:48] like that to get uh to get people in
[01:48:50] here hanging out on a regular basis so
[01:48:52] maybe this might work if I had like a
[01:48:53] singles game where I was going through
[01:48:55] it quickly versus the packs on an
[01:48:58] evening and in the mornings I think I
[01:48:59] can do more packs I've
[01:49:01] noticed but uh yeah that's what we're at
[01:49:04] right now and remember anybody that's
[01:49:05] out there any of the packs that we have
[01:49:07] you can um you can say if you want them
[01:49:10] or not you can choose something
[01:49:12] different you can tell me you don't want
[01:49:14] them you want a different ones that we
[01:49:15] have in the buy now that way we can do
[01:49:18] our the the adventure game I mean uh The
[01:49:20] Wheel of Fortune game here or the wheel
[01:49:22] of magic as I as we dubbed
[01:49:29] it Andrew thank you you got yourself a
[01:49:33] little sign one from our son Nolan there

[01:49:55] just doing our little uh Wheel of
[01:49:57] Fortune currently that is our hint up on
[01:50:00] the board there along with our word I
[01:50:04] think I made it too easy I'm going to
[01:50:06] give U I'm going to give it another
[01:50:07] minute or so here no GNA give it another
[01:50:11] minute here and if that does uh if no
[01:50:13] one comes in I'll let you solve it house
[01:50:15] how's that and then we'll pick another
[01:50:17] card out and we'll go with a different
[01:50:21] one
[01:50:25] let's do that there oh knocked all those
[01:50:31] over all righty no one wants these so
[01:50:33] I'll put that back let's do um
[01:50:41] a I don't
[01:50:47] know no we're going to do this we're
[01:50:50] going to put that out that's what we're

[01:52:24] one is from
[01:52:27] 2020 and it is a
[01:52:36] place 2020 and a
[01:52:46] place can't see it it's theare oh the
[01:52:48] glare of it dig that sakama the Zak is
[01:52:50] nice I know I got that one I was lucky
[01:52:53] to pull that one out we actually I use
[01:52:54] that in the deck one of my D Dragon de
[01:52:56] Dino decks I just uh didn't put it up
[01:52:59] and put this back
[01:53:01] here actually it goes over here then I'm
[01:53:04] going to pull out just one of
[01:53:06] these let's do
[01:53:09] that and see if you want to try to
[01:53:14] guess the uh letter
[01:53:18] here it's a place in 2020 was the
[01:53:26] set
[01:53:28] yeah really LCI collectors are jumping
[01:53:31] wow I don't I look I didn't see how much
[01:53:34] um I knew they went up a little bit but
[01:53:36] uh I didn't see how much they went up
[01:53:38] well I mean it makes sense there aren't
[01:53:40] any around over 300 now son of a [ __ ] I
[01:53:43] guess I should have bought more huh well
[01:53:45] luckily I have one two
[01:53:48] three
[01:53:50] four boxes of
[01:53:53] it I know people complain about the
[01:53:55] price of the packs I'm like guys
[01:53:58] um I can't do anything about it when
[01:54:00] they're that price of a
[01:54:07] box that's crazy that they're over
[01:54:09] 300 well I mean there's all the uh the
[01:54:12] monoc crypts and
[01:54:15] everything yeah exactly the small
[01:54:17] printing it's always going to happen
[01:54:19] well I have um I got some set boosters
[01:54:22] a case of set boosters which is
[01:54:32] nice put this up here for that yeah I
[01:54:37] know it's always kind and the thing is
[01:54:38] like the ion one I wanted to get more of
[01:54:40] it to sit on it I just don't have the
[01:54:41] money to do that I would have boughten
[01:54:44] like cases of that because Jurassic Park
[01:54:46] liking it I just at the time didn't have
[01:54:49] the money to do it because I was just
[01:54:51] starting out here now if I had started
[01:54:53] now and want ion came out now I probably
[01:54:56] would have been able to get like five
[01:54:57] cases of it but at the moment at that
[01:55:00] first time I was lucky I was able to
[01:55:01] afford and get a half one I think I got
[01:55:03] three boxes and I bought another three
[01:55:04] boxes and I just kept buying them as
[01:55:06] quickly as I
[01:55:07] could now I buy them and uh buy them
[01:55:09] every now and again
[01:55:12] here but I do have a few of the boxes of
[01:55:14] them of ion myself J I'm a big fan of
[01:55:18] the Jurassic Park
[01:55:21] stuff so so that's why we got them
[01:55:23] that's why we got them
[01:55:27] all we'll throw out one of
[01:55:30] these throw it out for a few minutes
[01:55:33] here and we're going to try uh we have
[01:55:36] uh our place and it's from 2020
[01:55:40] currently you're
[01:55:42] hungry well that's why I was saying or
[01:55:44] do you want to do dinner because I'm
[01:55:45] hungry too and I bet everybody else is
[01:55:47] hungry I know I thought gener was be
[01:55:49] like five something I
[01:55:51] thought
[01:55:52] now you can get ice cream I'm good with
[01:55:54] getting ice well we can't get ice cream
[01:55:55] because we'll do well you get a reward
[01:55:57] for doing
[01:56:00] [ __ ] oh my God you're you know what you
[01:56:03] can go get ice
[01:56:09] cream I didn't put it on my list you
[01:56:12] didn't put it on your list it didn't
[01:56:13] make it to the list so it didn't make it
[01:56:15] in the cart
[01:56:17] noce they do have good ice cream I like
[01:56:20] their ice cream a lot ice cream is
[01:56:22] better than everywhere
[01:56:24] else yes somebody else needs to jump in
[01:56:27] and play the game yeah he can't play it
[01:56:29] alone this time and hey I'm you know
[01:56:31] what let's see if somebody else wants to
[01:56:33] jump in though cuz uh I'm only going to
[01:56:35] hang out here for probably a half hour
[01:56:37] longer or so so I don't want to have you
[01:56:39] hanging around here trying to jump in
[01:56:40] and play something but I will let you
[01:56:41] try and solve it if we get to the end
[01:56:48] though hold
[01:56:51] please
[01:56:55] we have the wheel of magic for those of
[01:56:57] you that want to try it it's pretty good
[01:56:59] not bad there I like it it's pretty fun
[01:57:01] so far uh we've had a good time with it
[01:57:03] I think at the moment I would say we've
[01:57:05] had a good time with it at the moment
[01:57:07] it's one of those ones where you're just
[01:57:08] not sure you know we've had a few people
[01:57:10] that have liked it so far there's a
[01:57:13] couple of people that say they didn't
[01:57:14] like
[01:57:15] it but
[01:57:17] uh most say they do it's a quick and
[01:57:21] easy one too so that's the thing that I
[01:57:22] like about it it's a quick and easy one
[01:57:24] it's not like a long game if that makes
[01:57:27] sense like some games like the adventure
[01:57:29] game can kind of get long which is why
[01:57:32] like when my son made it it was like 12
[01:57:34] steps I like d dude dude we need to pair
[01:57:35] that down to like uh one or four step
[01:57:39] he's like well what if we do four I'm
[01:57:41] like all right that's at the most I'm
[01:57:42] ever gonna
[01:57:44] do I'm going to
[01:57:49] uh [ __ ]
[01:57:56] I'm tired
[01:57:57] too long day whenever we're out in the
[01:58:01] sun for a day I always get beaten just
[01:58:05] like
[01:58:07] horrible I feel like I'm dead for the
[01:58:10] next day yes it is
[01:58:12] Saturday I don't care if you at live
[01:58:15] asking me
[01:58:21] if
[01:58:24] okay I need my crap yeah
[01:58:29] okay all right sounds
[01:58:35] good um anybody play no not now that's
[01:58:40] okay we had a good first
[01:58:42] round another game I mean now we know
[01:58:44] our glitches yeah we need a wheel need a
[01:58:47] wheel better
[01:58:49] wheel well I can use the wheel on
[01:58:52] there's there that com to the thing I
[01:58:55] think well that's if what work well
[01:58:57] whatnot yeah if what working well I feel
[01:58:59] like last time youed that wheel earlier
[01:59:02] it glitched
[01:59:04] too yeah we it glitch at one point yeah
[01:59:07] when I started doing
[01:59:15] this green screen well the plan would be
[01:59:17] to do the green screen
[01:59:21] anyways
[01:59:22] oh I can spin the table wheel here right
[01:59:25] here spin the table wheel the green
[01:59:27] screen would go I get what you're saying
[01:59:30] and then I had the cards in front theard
[01:59:33] right on on the in front of the wheel
[01:59:35] yeah I get what you're
[01:59:37] saying I like it so the wheel is kind of
[01:59:40] like
[01:59:42] um the I looking at it's like a twister
[01:59:45] wheel yeah all right it's like one of
[01:59:47] Twister Wheels okay all right

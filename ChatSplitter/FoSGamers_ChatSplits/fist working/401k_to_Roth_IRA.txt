So what we can do is we can take, with the business, put ourselves having a 401k, put all of the money into our 401k the most that we can on a regular basis every paycheck. That way we max out the 401k contributions every year. And then at the end of every two or three years, or if we need money to purchase something, we take and move that money from our 401k over to a Roth IRA or a rollover IRA. And we literally cash that money out as needed without paying any penalties on anything.

Your plan involves using a 401(k) for initial tax-advantaged savings and then periodically moving those funds into a Roth IRA or a rollover IRA. Here are the detailed steps and considerations for your plan:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: 
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you are aware of the annual contribution limits set by the IRS. For 2024, the limit is $22,500 for those under 50, and an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution for those 50 and older.
   - **Employer Matching**: Take advantage of any employer matching contributions to maximize your savings.

2. **Periodic Rollover to IRA**:
   - **Traditional to Roth IRA Conversion**: You can convert your traditional 401(k) funds to a Roth IRA. Note that you will need to pay income taxes on the converted amount in the year of the conversion.
   - **Rollover IRA**: If you prefer not to pay taxes immediately, you can roll over to a traditional IRA instead. This maintains the tax-deferred status until you withdraw the funds.

3. **Withdrawal Considerations**:
   - **Roth IRA**: Qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA (account held for at least five years and the account holder is 59½ or older) are tax-free.
   - **Rollover IRA**: Withdrawals from a traditional IRA are subject to ordinary income tax, and withdrawals before age 59½ may incur a 10% early withdrawal penalty unless an exception applies.

4. **Avoiding Penalties**:
   - **Roth IRA Contributions**: You can withdraw your Roth IRA contributions (but not the earnings) at any time without taxes or penalties.
   - **Penalty-Free Withdrawals**: For a traditional IRA, there are specific circumstances that allow for penalty-free withdrawals before age 59½, such as for first-time home purchases, certain education expenses, and more.

5. **Tax Implications**:
   - **Conversion Taxes**: When converting from a traditional 401(k) to a Roth IRA, the converted amount will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Strategic Conversions**: Consider converting amounts in years when your income is lower to minimize the tax impact.

### Summary:
1. Maximize your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit.
2. Periodically convert or roll over your 401(k) funds to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA.
3. Understand the tax implications of converting to a Roth IRA.
4. Withdraw funds from your Roth IRA or traditional IRA as needed, considering the tax and penalty rules.
5. Plan conversions strategically to minimize tax impact.

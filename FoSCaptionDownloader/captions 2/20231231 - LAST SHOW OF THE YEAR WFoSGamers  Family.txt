[01:32:17] right oh is it like the last name I had
[01:32:20] a friend uh a I um I worked with
[01:32:23] actually where his last name had no
[01:32:25] vowels in it it was one of the hard it
[01:32:27] was the hardest name ever to say it like
[01:32:32] S I don't know I always even when he
[01:32:34] told it to me I'd still tell I'd still
[01:32:36] like two days later like dude how you
[01:32:37] say your name
[01:32:40] again one of those like one of those
[01:32:42] type of names you know if if you know
[01:32:43] what I'm talking
[01:32:45] about if you have one of those names you
[01:32:47] know what I'm talking about all righty
[01:32:49] we got that oare out there let me throw
[01:32:51] this on for a pack deal coming up we're
[01:32:54] going to do set of Lord of the Rings set
[01:32:58] of modern Horizon a set of
[01:33:01] fxia well initials and last names okay
[01:33:05] okay that helps a little bit that's
[01:33:06] probably why I'm getting I'm probably
[01:33:08] Reading part of your initials as the
[01:33:09] last name
[01:33:16] too and we're going to call this
[01:33:18] onstream pack
[01:33:20] deal
[01:33:28] we call that on screen pack field
[01:33:31] 21 three screens on three packs on
[01:33:34] screen for 21 if you want
[01:33:37] them Lord of the Rings set modern
[01:33:40] Horizon set and a fxia all will be one
[01:33:44] set that's what we got going on there
[01:33:46] and then I am going to throw on some
[01:33:49] more pull box deals
[01:33:52] after that if there's anything somebody
[01:33:54] wants you know what I can do a mix and
[01:33:55] match too say you want to do um six
[01:33:59] Doctor Who and six lost caverns of
[01:34:02] Exelon I can do that for like you know
[01:34:06] well 14 instead of 16 that way you kind
[01:34:09] of get one lost Caverns full free
[01:34:12] because whenever I do multiple things it
[01:34:14] allows me to take money off because
[01:34:15] whatnot has fees when you do an
[01:34:17] individual each each item sold has a fee
[01:34:20] to it but if I sign sell multiple items
[01:34:22] together it allows me to save with the
[01:34:24] fees so I kind of like pass them over to
[01:34:26] you so that's what I'm going to do here
[01:34:28] actually I'm going to do that I'm going
[01:34:29] to do a pbox mix a match we're going to
[01:34:31] call it
[01:34:33] $14 and is going to be six Doctor Who

[02:05:45] nothing
[02:05:46] spectacular we've had a couple okay
[02:05:48] cards pulled out of the there so there's
[02:05:50] some good things still in that box plus

[02:06:15] a pull box deal again
[02:06:19] we're going to do this for the pull box
[02:06:22] deal we'll do this for the pull box
[02:06:26] deal there we go Lord of the Rings pull
[02:06:31] box you
[02:06:34] have nine PS for 13 that would normally
[02:06:38] be 15 so you get cou couple bucks off
[02:06:41] because we're doing multiple at once
[02:06:43] which is literally the reason why I'm
[02:06:44] able to do discounts because whatnot
[02:06:45] charges me per item sold so when I sell
[02:06:49] multiple together I give you guys the
[02:06:51] discount that I would that um that I get
[02:06:54] from not selling those multiple sorry
[02:06:56] just picking up some of the packs that I
[02:06:57] threw around on the floor here that
[02:06:59] didn't go to trag
[02:07:00] box so maybe you want to try your luck
[02:07:03] hey gamb juvie Fidel cash flow I like
[02:07:09] that Anonymous seapod all
[02:07:12] right none of those so let's go on I'm
[02:07:15] going to throw a single on here some
[02:07:18] singles
[02:07:19] on for those that like the singles
[02:07:26] deals floor and ceiling for the Doctor
[02:07:28] Who polls I can tell you that and I can
[02:07:31] do a little bit of a doctor here P two
[02:07:32] pull box deal too check out the um
[02:07:35] auction if you want any of those but I
[02:07:36] will tell you what the floor and the
[02:07:37] ceiling is because I have it all saved
[02:07:41] here in
[02:07:44] uh and a file everybody lives uh uh
[02:07:49] exotic Orchard we have a couple of those
[02:07:50] in there and that's how you get to the
[02:07:53] ceiling by those in the Cyberman
[02:07:55] Squadron surge foil three visit surge
[02:07:59] foil Cyberman Patrol foil second doctor
[02:08:03] surge foil showcase now the floor on it
[02:08:06] would be um if you're going to pull out
[02:08:09] three cards and the three floors would
[02:08:12] be um I think it's like lunar hatchling
[02:08:16] foil master of galif and a DAV Roos or
[02:08:20] something like that um are the are the
[02:08:22] lows on that but that's how you would
[02:08:24] get the lows and the highs and the
[02:08:25] averages there so you getting the
[02:08:27] multiple cards but what I can do if
[02:08:29] you're interested I'll do this for
[02:08:31] you normally it's
[02:08:34] 18 I'll throw it on for 16 if you want
[02:08:36] to try your luck on the Doctor Who pull
[02:08:38] boox but you see you heard me say what's
[02:08:41] in it pretty good deal you get I like
[02:08:43] doing multiple cards that are worth
[02:08:46] money rather than just one ceiling card
[02:08:48] because I feel like when you have a box
[02:08:50] that's a thousand cards and you have one
[02:08:52] card that is a $100 card in there and
[02:08:56] all the rest are like dollar cards and
[02:08:58] you're selling that box off for you know
[02:09:01] you know $6 a pop I I feels disingenuous

[02:47:31] box deal I think I missed the pole box
[02:47:33] deal I don't remember if I did the pull
[02:47:34] box deal or not let's do a pole box
[02:47:38] deal my brain gets messed up sometimes
[02:47:40] when we do things too many things at
[02:47:43] once let's see if somebody wants to try
[02:47:46] the doctor you get nine doctor whoop
[02:47:51] poles for uh 16 instead of 18 it's
[02:47:54] pretty good deal there nine doctor hoop
[02:47:56] Poes for 16 instead of
[02:47:58] 18 and then um we will find a pack deal
[02:48:03] for you all is it Doctor Who good set I
[02:48:06] like the Doctor Who set um I find that
[02:48:09] Dr Jet doesn't have a lot of bulk
[02:48:12] there's a lot of good cards that are
[02:48:13] playable cards there's not too much
[02:48:14] Fulon the Doctor Who set which is
[02:48:16] something I found out to be pretty cool
[02:48:18] um like a lot of the cards are for the
[02:48:20] most part worth a little bit and you can
[02:48:23] play them all so that's the nice thing I
[02:48:25] found with the dror who
[02:48:34] set we've had a lot of fun with it my
[02:48:36] son and I because we watch dror who too
[02:48:38] so that helps
[02:48:40] also all righty so we didn't want that
[02:48:44] I'm going to throw throw
[02:48:46] on a pack deal
[02:48:49] here let's do this for a pack deal
[02:48:54] here
[02:48:57] um let's do this for a pack deal I'm
[02:48:59] just literally picking out random
[02:49:05] packs yeah the one that lets you draw
[02:49:07] from the bottom is cool there's also one
[02:49:09] that um it like it doesn't let you lose
[02:49:11] the game either there's a go like you
[02:49:14] can play this card no one loses the game
[02:49:16] which is nice it's a nice instant and it
[02:49:18] doesn't even cost a ton either so we
[02:49:20] have a set of modern Horizon a draft of
[02:49:24] Commander Masters and a draft of Wilds
[02:49:26] of Al drain that's what I'm going to go

[02:49:54] screen Gengar Master the one who
[02:50:00] knocks sticky rice like that

[02:50:06] watching my you know what I was always a
[02:50:09] big fan of it um I started watching it
[02:50:11] with the new one that came out 2003 the
[02:50:13] nin doctor so uh and I had a good time
[02:50:15] with it I was a big fan of it but I also
[02:50:17] like British humor though so that helps
[02:50:20] if that makes any sense so like if

[03:30:26] to throw on a pull box deal no problem
[03:30:28] ganja we appreciate it you know I don't
[03:30:31] mind doing deals here with people
[03:30:33] because uh you know if I the the way the
[03:30:35] way that I'm able to do a deal is
[03:30:37] because if I'm able to do multiple
[03:30:38] things at once it helps me save on
[03:30:39] whatnot fees and unlike like other
[03:30:42] buyers I don't know how other buyers do
[03:30:43] it but I try to just pass those savings
[03:30:45] on to you guys since it's it doesn't
[03:30:47] matter to me I'm already I already um
[03:30:51] like planned out what I was going to
[03:30:52] make or not make off of each set and
[03:30:55] card so whenever I do that based on my
[03:30:59] Excel file I already know what I can do
[03:31:00] and that's why I'm like I'll I don't
[03:31:02] take and take that extra I give that
[03:31:04] extra to you guys as like you know
[03:31:05] discount on
[03:31:07] stuff that's kind of why I'm able to do
[03:31:10] that when I do multiple things at once
[03:31:12] so if you're ever looking for like
[03:31:14] multiple things or say you go hey I want
[03:31:16] like
[03:31:17] four you know say I want like a pole box
[03:31:21] and a pack of cards and a single like by
[03:31:24] doing three things at once it helps me

[03:31:54] out now Keith what would you like us to
[03:31:57] do here I can have the boys pull or I
[03:31:59] can have uh you can tell me where to
[03:32:01] go hot hands all right I'll the boys in
[03:32:04] their hot hands come
[03:32:06] out um Nolan and William come on over we
[03:32:10] have some Doctor Who to pull or if you
[03:32:13] want William can pull all of them it's
[03:32:15] up to you
[03:32:18] guys come on
[03:32:22] over nine Doctor
[03:32:29] Who one two three four and then five all
[03:32:33] right and then four from
[03:32:36] Nolan
[03:32:37] one
[03:32:39] two 3
[03:32:41] three and four all right there's the
[03:32:43] four from
[03:32:45] Nolan I would advise that your shipping
[03:32:47] is free that usually stops me from
[03:32:50] buying oh well I don't normally do uh
[03:32:53] yeah it's because I I never thought of
[03:32:55] that I never really do that because I
[03:32:56] don't bake that into the price like
[03:32:58] other people so that's kind of why I I'm
[03:33:00] weird I don't know I don't bake it into
[03:33:01] the prices I try to just give everybody
[03:33:02] up front and so you can see what it is
[03:33:05] all right Keith we're gonna see what no
[03:33:07] William got you
[03:33:09] here sixth
[03:33:12] doctor Ponder foil Seventh Doctor foil
[03:33:16] eighth doctor showcase and a c of Scaro
[03:33:19] surge foil nice C of Scaro surge foil
[03:33:23] yeah I like to do it as like the lowest
[03:33:25] price possible rather than M like rather
[03:33:27] than jacking the price up on like the
[03:33:29] cards or the pole boxes or the packs I
[03:33:32] do it at the lowest price that you know
[03:33:33] it's one of those things where like you
[03:33:35] can go and get free shipping on eBay and
[03:33:37] get a de something that's $230 for free
[03:33:40] shipping but then you can go and buy it
[03:33:42] from somebody for $210 plus $10 shipping
[03:33:45] you're saving 10 bucks but because you
[03:33:47] pay that $10 shipping some people don't
[03:33:49] always look at it kind of but I like to
[03:33:51] give it as the discounted thing as low
[03:33:53] as possible that way everybody sees it
[03:33:55] as low as possible I don't know I'm
[03:33:56] weird like that the 11th Dr
[03:34:00] foil oh Aon Soldier that's a nice
[03:34:04] foil fractured identity foil extended
[03:34:07] art and a fourth doctor got yourself a
[03:34:11] nice auton Soldier and a bunch of
[03:34:14] doctors
[03:34:15] here seventh eighth fourth and 11th
[03:34:21] Doctor look at that one two three four
[03:34:26] five doctors out of that and an auton
[03:34:28] soldier that was a nice hit Keith loaded
[03:34:31] up on those doctors
[03:34:37] definitely yeah that's that's the reason
[03:34:39] why I don't do like the the free
[03:34:41] shipping thing cuz um I just don't mark
[03:34:43] my prices up to go to make free shipping
[03:34:47] like uh that's the only reason that
[03:34:49] other places do free shipping is because
[03:34:51] they mark their prices up so I just keep
[03:34:53] my prices as low as possible and that
[03:34:57] way you know it's just as low as I can
[03:34:59] get for the most part um and then you're
[03:35:02] that's why it's at at the price it is I
[03:35:04] don't try to mark it up and be like yo
[03:35:05] look at me I'm giving free shipping away
[03:35:08] when it's not really free shipping I'm
[03:35:10] just baking it into the price of
[03:35:12] whatever I'm doing you
[03:35:14] know it's one of those weird you know
[03:35:16] it's one of those things that I always
[03:35:17] um I always thought was weird we're like
[03:35:19] you go and you do that so but that's
[03:35:21] that's why I do it the way I do that's
[03:35:22] all that's really the only reason I do
[03:35:24] what I
[03:35:25] do but what I'm gonna do here is we just
[03:35:28] did that I'm gonna throw up uh I'm gonna

[03:52:53] the friends and family and stuff like
[03:52:55] that and have fun kind of is really what
[03:52:57] it is it's weird you know I'm not like
[03:53:00] everybody else where I'm like trying to
[03:53:02] push something we're just like I'm
[03:53:04] throwing up I get deals for I can from a
[03:53:07] distributor um and I throw up for you
[03:53:09] guys and if you want them you go for
[03:53:11] them it's really what it boils down
[03:53:13] to um and I just kind of like sitting
[03:53:16] here having fun kind of hanging out with
[03:53:19] you
[03:53:19] all so I'm G to throw this one up here
[03:53:22] these three packs on
[03:53:25] screen
[03:53:27] 21 yeah it's not like a high pressure
[03:53:29] thing more of a hanging out having a
[03:53:32] good time just cracking packs and seeing
[03:53:34] what happens maybe doing some pull boxes
[03:53:38] because I do try to load up the pole
[03:53:39] boxes what I do with the pull boxes I
[03:53:41] set them up where you get multiple
[03:53:43] chances to get good cards versus one
[03:53:46] chance to get one card out of a thousand
[03:53:49] so I like to do it that way where I do
[03:53:51] the multiple chances to get multiple
[03:53:52] good cards that's why I have my P boxes
[03:53:55] set up the way I do where they may not
[03:53:56] have a giant huge high ceiling but
[03:53:59] that's because there's like a bunch of $
[03:54:01] five cards a few few few dollar cards so
[03:54:05] that way when he getting it you don't
[03:54:06] get like kind of screwed the entire time
[03:54:09] all right I'm going to do my best Sean

[03:54:43] ristic Sun's open the suns are not
[03:54:47] allowed to open the packs on whatnot for
[03:54:50] some reason I actually asked them before
[03:54:52] and it has something to do with they are
[03:54:54] under the age I think it's their they
[03:54:57] have to be 14 or 16 I can't remember the
[03:55:00] age they had to be before they did stuff
[03:55:02] here which was kind of stupid to me
[03:55:04] because it's like they have my
[03:55:05] permission they're here with me and if
[03:55:07] they're okay with and you guys are okay
[03:55:09] with it who cares
[03:55:12] yeah yeah I know they won't let it do it
[03:55:14] unless they're under a certain age one
[03:55:16] two three four and five one two three
[03:55:20] four and five but at least with the pull
[03:55:22] boxes we can do the pull boxes and they
[03:55:24] can pick from the pull boxes because
[03:55:25] it's not opening the cards so I don't

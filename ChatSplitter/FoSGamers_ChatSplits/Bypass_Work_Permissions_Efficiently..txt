Chat: Bypass_Work_Permissions_Efficiently.

[2024-06-17 10:03:08] FoSGamers:
Use the internet. Is there a way to get around work permissions so I can access you on my work computer?

[2024-06-17 10:03:30] ChatGPT:
Accessing restricted websites on a work computer can be tricky due to the security measures in place, but there are several methods you might consider:

1. **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**: Using a VPN is one of the most effective ways to bypass work restrictions. A VPN encrypts your traffic and routes it through a server in a different location, masking your IP address and making it appear as though you're browsing from somewhere else. This method is highly secure and reliable for unblocking websites【6†source】【7†source】.

2. **Proxy Servers**: Proxy servers act as intermediaries between your computer and the internet. They can help you access blocked sites by masking your IP address. However, proxies do not encrypt your data, which can pose security risks. They are generally faster than VPNs but less secure【6†source】【7†source】.

3. **Tor Browser**: Tor, short for The Onion Router, routes your internet traffic through multiple servers to anonymize your browsing. This makes it difficult for work networks to track your online activities. Tor is highly secure but can be slow due to the multiple layers of encryption it uses【6†source】【7†source】.

4. **Using IP Addresses**: Sometimes websites are blocked by their URL but not by their IP address. You can find the IP address of a website using a tool like Command Prompt (e.g., `ping website.com`) and enter the IP address directly into your browser【7†source】【8†source】.

5. **Browser Extensions**: Some VPN and proxy services offer browser extensions, which can be quicker and easier to use than full VPN applications. They usually only affect your browser traffic, leaving other applications unaffected【6†source】.

6. **Google Translate or Wayback Machine**: You can use Google Translate as a makeshift proxy by entering the URL of the blocked site and translating it. Similarly, the Wayback Machine stores older versions of websites and can sometimes bypass current restrictions【7†source】【8†source】.

7. **Mobile Data**: If all else fails, you can use your mobile data as a hotspot. This method bypasses the work network entirely, allowing you to access any site as long as your mobile network doesn’t have the same restrictions【7†source】.

Remember, using these methods to bypass work restrictions might violate your company's policies, so proceed with caution and consider the potential consequences. If you need to access blocked sites for legitimate reasons, it might be best to discuss this with your IT department.

Would you like to know more about any of these methods, or need help setting one up?

**Willis, Sharon**  
So you folks have put together a bucket of items that we thought we would just start to go through and see where we get.

**Brown, Patrick**  
We can schedule more time if we go through everything today, that's more than fine.  
We're being a thorough as I recall.  
I was mentioning that I was trying to be respectful of everyone’s time.

**Rech, Colleen**  
Thank you, Patrick.  
And Sumi, thanks for being on the line with Lisa.  
This was important because we’re still finding ways to be more efficient.

**Brown, Patrick**  
Through the exceptions folder you mean?

**Miller, Kenneth**  
Yes, for anything, are you still getting mail delivered that isn't really for legal files, but you’re still using legal files if it’s just to get an electronic copy of it?

**Rech, Colleen**  
Sumi, Sumi, Sumi,  
OK, got that.  
Well, that made my day already!

Yes, yes, absolutely, that is something to figure out.

**Brown, Patrick K** 4:48
I'll interrupt you for a second, Lisa and I am, I'm sorry, this is just a test document.  
We did not get ICS records through our scanning vendor.  
I just realized my audience, so I just wanted to make sure I happen to be working on the duplicate.  
So we just put it in the desk and didn't remove it because obviously we have nothing in the exceptions box.  
She cleaned it out today, but we wanted to just be able to show you how we change the document name from the document into different doc types/folder.  
So she got a notice document that comes through our exceptions box.  
We need to rename them and then we get things through and we have got all scanned.  
The goal is in Michigan we have a lot of courts that are not E filed.  
We do send out all paper mail still.  
And Lisa is scanning those every when she does get mail.  
And I am just hoping or a court document how we run Wizard and process that, but that that's what we are later.  
So I just wanted to make that clear.

**Evenson, Lisa** 7:41
Thank you, Lisa.

**Miller, Kenneth** 8:05
I could seriously take that for a while.  
We are in this topic.  
Now if this is more mail that's outside of legal files?  
Just legal mail.

**Willis, Jason** 8:10
I got to see it. We have an exceptions folder.

**Rech, Colleen** 8:16
OK.

**Willis, Jason** 8:20
Another office would have their own exceptions folder.  
Then channeled through the scanning vendor via a bar code the retailer back to the client.  
Soft copies that gets one in front of the scan job that gets opened and then processed.  
All part of the scan process.

**Soman, Sumi** 8:35
OK.  
Thank you for explaining that.

**Willis, Jason** 8:39
OK.

**Evenson, Lisa** 8:50
So yes, I'm done. We named the document. I have to save it first ok, like the user finds on doc.  
So I just renamed it now in doc now it until the document is renamed, so we’ll go ahead and re upload the mail that I have being the document detail without again and let me, oh actually, let me just save the file.

**Rech, Colleen** 9:21
Yes.

**Evenson, Lisa** 9:30
All right so now I’m going to save the document detail again.  
I’m open, save it now save it again here.  
Click on it and now the file is available.

**Willis, Sharon** 9:40
I got to see it. Yeah we have an exceptions folder.

**Miller, Kenneth** 9:45
Yep.

**Rech, Colleen** 9:50
So folks have put together a bucket of items that we thought we would just start to go through and we’ll see where we get.

**Willis, Sharon** 10:02
All right.  
So you're talking about, I don't know, bar notices, things of that sort.

**Miller, Kenneth** 10:08
Right.

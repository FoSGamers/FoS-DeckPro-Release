[00:16:16] things happen that it uh I don't know
[00:16:18] what the doctors are telling you but she
[00:16:20] said one of the things that always it
[00:16:22] may hurt but moving makes it better
[00:16:23] because I guess it stretches the skin
[00:16:25] out so that even though it cracks and it
[00:16:27] hurts it heals in between it
[00:16:29] that way it'll it'll move better later
[00:16:30] or something along that lines she was a
[00:16:33] nurse and she used to deal with people
[00:16:34] um all the time with um all kinds of
[00:16:37] different stuff um some of bariatic knee

[00:20:58] to do this when it comes to
[00:21:00] um protecting things for shipping when
[00:21:03] it's anywhere like kind of near 10 bucks
[00:21:05] I kind of put Stu together like this
[00:21:07] with cards that are kind of similar
[00:21:08] value and we put them in here because it
[00:21:10] helps keep them stiffer for shipping if
[00:21:12] I do it one at a
[00:21:13] time they bend a little bit but if I do
[00:21:16] I found out if I do them a couple at a
[00:21:18] time
[00:21:19] here they don't bend as much and it's
[00:21:22] nice helps with shipping so they keep
[00:21:24] the cars
[00:21:27] protected
[00:21:34] oh nice you've been meaning for a black

[00:29:53] understand that I do I try to do deals
[00:29:55] on things so if you see a three-pack
[00:29:56] deal and you need to cancel something if
[00:29:58] you request to cancel I don't have a
[00:29:59] problem with that because I do three
[00:30:01] packs and sometimes people miss them so
[00:30:03] yeah no problem I'll go and cancel that
[00:30:04] re just request a cancel and I will
[00:30:06] cancel that right after I take care of
[00:30:08] Pegasus here with the carnival game all
[00:30:09] right so Pegasus we want to do the
[00:30:12] carnival game now here's the carnival
[00:30:14] game we have the father's box we have
[00:30:16] the son's box and we have that buyer's
[00:30:19] box right here now here's your mystery
[00:30:22] packs that you pick from now without the
[00:30:24] sun here you get to pick two and I'll
[00:30:26] pick one from the father so where do you
[00:30:28] want to go in these mystery packs for
[00:30:30] these two here for you Mr Pegasus or M
[00:30:35] Pegasus not sure Pegasus was just a
[00:30:39] flying you know flying uh horse I didn't
[00:30:41] really take a look specifically at what
[00:30:42] it
[00:30:44] was cap how you
[00:30:47] doing how deep are these boxes they
[00:30:50] aren't really deep on these boxes the
[00:30:52] you kind of all right so here's how it
[00:30:53] is you have with the father um the
[00:30:56] father's box is just kind of like a card
[00:30:58] you might want to play with this card
[00:31:00] you really want to hit the uh buyer box
[00:31:02] where you're going to get possibly an
[00:31:03] extra pack uh but here every one of
[00:31:05] these are three packs and what happens
[00:31:07] is let me oh oh it's right here in front
[00:31:09] of me so say for instance this is what
[00:31:11] happens you pull out a one of this this
[00:31:16] and these are ones that I have had in
[00:31:17] the past I don't have these anymore
[00:31:19] because they're not mixed in what I have
[00:31:20] mixed in is what I have in sock so what
[00:31:22] say you had all these in here all right
[00:31:24] and this comes out it flips over and you
[00:31:25] go all right you got a modern Horizon
[00:31:27] set get LCI draft and a wild of drain
[00:31:31] set that was all three CS that were
[00:31:32] pulled out of there each one of these
[00:31:34] sets gets opened whichever one has the
[00:31:36] highest Mona value hits the targets and
[00:31:39] it gives you an extra pull so it's just
[00:31:40] a free extra thing is the carnival game
[00:31:43] so you'll get either an extra pull from
[00:31:44] the father's box if it hits the target
[00:31:46] there because it has the highest amount
[00:31:47] of value or a son box or maybe you get
[00:31:50] the buyer's box where you know the P
[00:31:52] potential of the extra pack that's
[00:31:53] really what it is it's just you always
[00:31:56] get these packs you're paying for the
[00:31:57] packs this was just a little extra free
[00:32:00] game to do because my kids wanted to
[00:32:01] play a game with everybody when we do
[00:32:03] our stuff that's really what it is so
[00:32:07] with that being said I'm going to put
[00:32:09] those back to where those are like I
[00:32:10] said I don't have any of those packs
[00:32:11] anymore but let me know where you want
[00:32:13] to go for these mystery ones here
[00:32:14] there's like I don't know maybe 100
[00:32:16] cards in here so let me know where you
[00:32:18] want to go on that and we'll uh do that
[00:32:21] there and we open that up uh get those
[00:32:22] put away oh off to the side for

[00:51:06] um let me know here because the mystery
[00:51:08] game it does do you can do the free
[00:51:10] mystery game but you did say ship the
[00:51:12] packs so without me opening it it's hard
[00:51:14] for me to do the mystery game so um if
[00:51:17] you're still here just let me know I
[00:51:20] want to get your name uh I just want to
[00:51:21] do this right for you you
[00:51:24] know
[00:51:29] skinny
[00:51:31] 20 if anybody is in here and uh able to
[00:51:34] tag him to see if he's still around or
[00:51:36] able to be around let me know here but
[00:51:38] he did say just uh pick them and ship
[00:51:41] them so what I'm GNA do is I'm G to pick
[00:51:44] them and ship
[00:51:48] them unless uh he jumps in to say
[00:51:52] something
[00:51:53] different all right it looks like with
[00:51:55] their mystery game oh we got a where is
[00:51:57] he he picked he got two of what's going
[00:52:00] on all right t-shirt got two of them and
[00:52:04] one of them not give me one second guys
[00:52:06] sorry I just need to um see what's going
[00:52:09] on
[00:52:11] here because he
[00:52:22] had all right can anybody scroll up and
[00:52:25] see t-shirt what did he say
[00:52:28] there oh
[00:52:35] buyers sorry I'm just trying to see if
[00:52:38] uh I can see what he said there if
[00:52:40] somebody could tag him quickly I would
[00:52:41] appreciate that see if he is able to get
[00:52:44] back on he wanted one returned I think
[00:52:46] and then he went again and again that
[00:52:49] okay yeah the one single one he wanted
[00:52:51] to return then he went in again but he
[00:52:52] said ship both of them that's all I was
[00:52:54] saying so all right we're gonna be
[00:52:55] picking six that's all I'm kind of
[00:52:57] getting at and he's not around to do the
[00:52:59] the the um the game to open him
[00:53:06] up what that is really
[00:53:11] weird is it $8 maybe for the total of
[00:53:18] everything that's odd but all right so
[00:53:20] we're going to do this for um for our
[00:53:23] friend here
[00:53:25] t-shirt we're gonna just pick out six
[00:53:27] and we're g to see what happens
[00:53:29] one
[00:53:31] two
[00:53:33] three
[00:53:37] four
[00:53:39] five and six all right so the first
[00:53:43] three were the ones down there on the
[00:53:44] bottom this is the second three second
[00:53:47] three over here first three
[00:53:51] there yes I think that's what it is cuz
[00:53:54] I think it's a total of everything and
[00:53:56] that's what it might be is I'm guessing
[00:53:57] the size gets bigger but at the same
[00:53:59] time I also go through and adjust and I
[00:54:02] don't know if it adjust it's for you
[00:54:03] guys on your end but I know I always go
[00:54:05] through and I make the size to a correct
[00:54:07] size when it comes to shipping later so
[00:54:09] I don't know if that's um helps you guys
[00:54:11] at all all right well he gets an lost
[00:54:14] Cav Exon draft a rabika draft and an AFR
[00:54:17] set now like I've done before with
[00:54:20] everybody we get to put drafts back and
[00:54:22] go for a set but since there's two
[00:54:24] different ones
[00:54:25] ah this is hard I'm GNA give him these
[00:54:28] ones he'll get those because he said
[00:54:30] ship them because they are three
[00:54:31] different
[00:54:33] ones we do
[00:54:37] that
[00:54:41] that and that and we're going to ship
[00:54:44] that he wanted to ship the packs yep
[00:54:46] that's what I'm saying he wanted to ship
[00:54:47] the packs that all right got those three
[00:54:49] draft draft and an ioria booster so I
[00:54:52] don't like two drafts at once of the
[00:54:53] same one I'm putting it back hopefully
[00:54:55] he's okay with me doing that we're going
[00:54:57] to see what else we get for luck for him
[00:54:59] here we're going to do not an nioria
[00:55:02] booster we're gonna put that back got
[00:55:04] same one I don't like when we get the
[00:55:05] same of them we do this all the time and
[00:55:07] we're giving him in Los Cavern Exon
[00:55:11] draft we're gonna give him a lost
[00:55:13] Caverns Exon set and we're gonna give
[00:55:17] him an aoria because instead of two
[00:55:18] drafts we're giving them a set I don't
[00:55:20] like giving people two drafts that's my
[00:55:22] thing there I don't like doing that when
[00:55:24] two Drafts come I don't feel good so
[00:55:26] he's going to get these packs shipped to
[00:55:27] him we are not going to be playing the
[00:55:29] mystery game but if he ends up coming
[00:55:31] back in at some point before the show
[00:55:33] ends we will do it yeah I'm trying to do
[00:55:36] my best that I can with uh without him
[00:55:39] being around here so I don't know I try
[00:55:42] to do best I can here to when they're
[00:55:44] when he's not around I try to take care
[00:55:46] of people and do the right thing myself
[00:55:47] what I would want to have done for me as
[00:55:49] the right thing you know I can't I I
[00:55:52] feel bad when you get the low of
[00:55:53] everything so if I can do something and
[00:55:56] like give a set inste I'll do it you
[00:56:00] know here we go but L you see earlier
[00:56:03] you do get that opportunity to
[00:56:04] potentially getting a uh yeah tampering
[00:56:07] in their favor tampering in their
[00:56:10] favor tampering so that more money gets
[00:56:13] taken away from me and giving to them
[00:56:15] that's such great tampering
[00:56:18] [Laughter]

[01:26:01] sometimes let do that
[01:26:03] again it's GNA run for a couple minutes
[01:26:06] that
[01:26:06] way I can uh show off some of the
[01:26:09] singles that we have all
[01:26:12] right all right here um I haven't gotten
[01:26:14] too many new ones but I'll kind of just

[01:26:19] the side I'll put it off the side with
[01:26:20] your name on it also car prices
[01:26:23] fluctuate like gold so it's hard to know
[01:26:24] what they are all the time so I just
[01:26:26] always just the prices that are on there
[01:26:27] were put on there when I open the packs
[01:26:31] so like I've had to adjust some of them
[01:26:32] even when I put them in the Big Blue
[01:26:33] Book I put some things in the Big Blue
[01:26:35] Book and I had adjust the price because
[01:26:38] I hadn't looked at the price since I set
[01:26:40] it up when I bought when I opened the
[01:26:42] pack so if there is anything you want
[01:26:44] though let me know I'll put it off the
[01:26:45] side with your name on it and then at
[01:26:48] the end of the show which will be about
[01:26:49] I 25 or 30 or so minutes I'll tally that
[01:26:53] all up and we'll let you know how much
[01:26:54] it is that way we can run one thing for
[01:26:57] you at a good weight not have to have
[01:27:00] you add all kinds of weight together for
[01:27:01] no reason and pay more you know that
[01:27:03] type of thing I want to hope you hook

[01:40:39] bottom
[01:40:48] left oh all right all right there what

[01:41:04] Mystic I'm sorry I didn't do it I didn't
[01:41:07] do it they did they did wasn't me wasn't
[01:41:13] me oh if it had the symbol it would be
[01:41:15] five box all right all
[01:41:18] right all right guys let's do this let's
[01:41:22] do this for a deal right
[01:41:26] now we're going to put on the Big Blue
[01:41:28] Book for a deal because the big blue
[01:41:29] book is a really good deal I think we're
[01:41:32] gonna do that
[01:41:35] but we're gonna put in a Murders At
[01:41:37] Carlo Manor that's what we're gonna do
[01:41:40] we're gonna guarantee these are two on
[01:41:42] the right side I think we're gonna
[01:41:43] guarantee a Murders At Carlo Manor right
[01:41:46] now we're gonna do it like this and
[01:41:49] we're gonna call this
[01:41:53] for
[01:41:55] those and what I'm going to do I'm going
[01:41:57] to take a minute and a half and I'm
[01:41:59] going to go
[01:42:00] through some of the singles that I have
[01:42:02] right here with that up all
[01:42:06] right now if you want any of these
[01:42:08] singles as everybody knows I just flip
[01:42:11] through these if you want them let me
[01:42:13] know I'll put it off the side with your
[01:42:14] name on it prices fluctuate over time
[01:42:17] because I uh I don't change them every
[01:42:19] single day those things I'm not going
[01:42:21] through and change them every sing day
[01:42:22] so would they fluctuate we just go to
[01:42:24] look at what the prices are and come up
[01:42:27] with a a com a combination of how much
[01:42:30] they are that way you don't have to pay
[01:42:32] each single price plus shipping on them
[01:42:34] all that you only play one thing so
[01:42:36] that's why I kind of do it like this but
[01:42:38] right now it is Murders At Carlo and a
[01:42:41] big blue book oh that was supposed to
[01:42:45] be that's
[01:42:47] wrong yeah whatever that's wrong that
[01:42:50] was supposed to be 40
[01:42:51] too nut collector hortus ratos Arcane
[01:42:58] Jes Arcane pek thought monitor cyers
[01:43:02] ship ratchet n but we got some decent
[01:43:05] cards here if you want any of these
[01:43:07] singles we'll put those up there if you
[01:43:09] want like I said before we put your name
[01:43:13] um on them and we will set add
[01:43:17] everything up at the end of the show
[01:43:18] which is about maybe 15 minutes or so is
[01:43:21] going to be the end of the show and in
[01:43:23] that 15 minutes to the end of the show
[01:43:24] what we're going to do here is we will
[01:43:27] um add everything up if there's anything
[01:43:30] that you want specifically or if I'm
[01:43:32] going too fast here too let me know if
[01:43:34] I'm going too fast here because if I am
[01:43:36] going too fast you can uh you can say
[01:43:38] hey slow down there but that was
[01:43:41] supposed to
[01:43:42] be I don't know why I did
[01:43:48] that Murders At car love plus a big blue
[01:43:52] book that's what we got there now the
[01:43:55] big blue book I'll show you guys what it

[01:44:09] get a number maybe you get a force of
[01:44:10] negation maybe get yourself the Yon
[01:44:13] Soldier now that being a $10 less than
[01:44:15] $10 card you get your
[01:44:18] choice of one of these three packs added
[01:44:21] on four packs added on now say you are
[01:44:25] one and you get
[01:44:27] that five where it's under
[01:44:30] $5 you get a choice
[01:44:33] of any two of these
[01:44:36] packs in ion or a Mystery Pack mystery
[01:44:41] convention plus one of these
[01:44:45] or a Dungeons and Dragons collector
[01:44:49] booster and those are all your choices
[01:44:51] if you happen to uh land on one that's
[01:44:53] under $ five so right now I'm going to

[01:45:36] that's a blank spot well you get a
[01:45:38] Murders At Carlo man or collector
[01:45:39] booster so that's how we're doing that
[01:45:41] here so every time this book gets spun
[01:45:43] the wheel gets spun and something's
[01:45:45] pulled you get more so fourth ear
[01:45:47] Lingus you get a floor right now is an
[01:45:49] overgrown
[01:45:51] tomb maybe you want to force a negation
[01:45:53] you know some decent cards in
[01:45:56] there so I'm going to put it on next
[01:45:58] here with an
[01:46:02] ixon collector booster for those that
[01:46:05] may be interested we're going to do it
[01:46:06] like
[01:46:12] this and this is what we're putting in
[01:46:14] on for for those that may want it this
[01:46:16] is a really good deal for that box book
[01:46:20] and and a pack there get yourself a pack
[01:46:24] of
[01:46:25] Exelon
[01:46:27] and a spin of the big blue book that's
[01:46:29] $3 off of those because you know helps
[01:46:32] you guys out with shipping and stuff if
[01:46:34] you help me out by getting two things
[01:46:36] versus one I help you out that's reallyy
[01:46:38] what it boils down to I'll go some pack
[01:46:40] deals after this if no one wants to try
[01:46:42] this though this is a good good deal
[01:46:44] here though really good deal lost
[01:46:48] caverns and that spin but try it out if
[01:46:51] you want it we'll put the big blue book
[01:46:53] back I don't think we're going to be
[01:46:55] resetting it today since we didn't do a
[01:46:56] lot of it we'll reset it
[01:47:00] maybe day but
[01:47:04] we while I scroll through singles all
[01:47:06] right and if you want to jump on that
[01:47:08] Big Blue
[01:47:09] Book actually you know what that's what
[01:47:11] I'm GNA do I'm just going to put the big
[01:47:13] blue book out there right now we're
[01:47:15] going to run the big Lo book here so
[01:47:17] that you guys can see it for a couple
[01:47:19] minutes while I go through singles
[01:47:22] that's the Big Blue Book for those that
[01:47:23] have wanted it or had any questions
[01:47:25] about it you can also check the buy now
[01:47:27] I mean um the uh notes that explains big
[01:47:30] blue book
[01:47:31] too and it actually came out to
[01:47:34] $2,222 accidentally by itself and I had
[01:47:37] nothing to do that other than adding up
[01:47:40] all the cost of the cards using Mana box
[01:47:42] and then adding up the pack cost that
[01:47:44] would be sent out with it too and I was
[01:47:46] like wow that's a weird coincidence that
[01:47:47] it came to
[01:47:49] $2,222 I did it twice to make sure I did
[01:47:52] it right my wife's like no that that
[01:47:53] came out to
[01:47:55] that
[01:47:57] so maybe you guys are
[01:48:00] uh
[01:48:02] interested in trying that big blue book
[01:48:04] out but here are some of the singles as
[01:48:05] I always do we'll put them off the side
[01:48:07] with your name on it if you want
[01:48:10] them just let me know and obviously the
[01:48:13] prices of them fluctuate so some of them
[01:48:15] are accurate some of them are off
[01:48:16] because it's when I put it on there when
[01:48:18] I pulled it out of the pack
[01:48:20] and go with our big blue book here good
[01:48:23] deal on that $22 you get 81 spots
[01:48:28] currently it's a it's more the average
[01:48:31] is actually more than 27 it's probably
[01:48:32] more around 30 because every spot that
[01:48:35] gets pulled ends up being an empty spot
[01:48:37] and every empty spot is a Murders At
[01:48:39] Carlo man or collector booster if you
[01:48:41] hit it so that's a really good deal on
[01:48:43] that so that's actually going up that's
[01:48:45] why I say the Big Blue Book gets better
[01:48:47] as it's this wheel is spun
[01:48:51] so I don't know good thing to try
[01:48:54] out good Big Blue Book
[01:48:56] there Gordy tried it I like
[01:49:00] it awesome Gordy we're gonna spin that
[01:49:03] here just GNA wait one 15 seconds here

[01:49:09] gonna spin it all right Gordy thank
[01:49:13] you I like the big blue book it's fun
[01:49:17] because you get a lot of chances at
[01:49:18] getting some good stuff and then on top
[01:49:20] of it you can get packs if you don't get
[01:49:21] the best card pulled out all right I'm
[01:49:23] going to put these back in
[01:49:26] here and we're going to go our

[02:00:47] two cases a week my wife is nice enough
[02:00:50] she goes and get them you have to get
[02:00:52] the can though you cannot get the bottle
[02:00:54] of green tea does not taste the same the
[02:00:57] plastic bottle it has to be in the cans
[02:00:59] the tin cans make it taste better I
[02:01:02] think anybody what do you think Tyler
[02:01:07] anybody drink Arizona green tea have you
[02:01:09] ever got the the plastic bottles versus
[02:01:11] the cans cans taste way
[02:01:14] better I don't know why I really don't

[02:01:32] better I think it's the tin and the can
[02:01:34] that's the only thing I can think of is
[02:01:36] it must be the tin in the can

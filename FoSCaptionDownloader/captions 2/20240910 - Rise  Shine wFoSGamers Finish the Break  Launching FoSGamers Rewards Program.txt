[00:03:39] I did just pay for it all yesterday um
[00:03:42] I'll send them a me the people a message
[00:03:44] that I get it from and ask them if I can
[00:03:45] get it as soon as
[00:03:47] possible um and if I could if I can I'll
[00:03:50] pay a little extra for shipping you know
[00:03:52] I don't mind doing that to get it a
[00:03:53] little
[00:03:56] early all right we have some of this and
[00:03:58] so what I was doing here this morning I
[00:04:00] was going to go through some of my uh
[00:04:01] mail that I've gotten
[00:04:03] recently to see what I got I got very
[00:04:05] lucky with them I didn't want to get
[00:04:07] like I said I don't want to keep buying
[00:04:08] anything because I got lucky with one of
[00:04:09] them like all right I can't do more it's
[00:04:11] one of those weird scenarios like it's
[00:04:13] you feel like you need to do more to
[00:04:15] like but then at the same time you don't
[00:04:16] want to because if you get lucky and you
[00:04:17] pull out more like ceilings and you're
[00:04:19] like oh
[00:04:23] crap oh pre-release next
[00:04:27] weekend interesting
[00:04:31] okay well I might be able to get it a
[00:04:32] little earlier then I'm going to have to
[00:04:33] send my people a message here hold on I
[00:04:36] might even do that right now hold
[00:04:58] on for
[00:05:50] hold on all right hold on one second
[00:06:02] all right quick message
[00:06:05] out we'll see what happens there thank
[00:06:07] you Frank I didn't know that happened so
[00:06:09] I got this which ended up being attached
[00:06:11] to the nuca Cole vending machine I was
[00:06:13] like oh wow this is where I got one of
[00:06:14] my like I'm like you know what I'm not
[00:06:15] going to T pull another one because I I
[00:06:17] don't think I should being having luck
[00:06:20] so I'm like I'm gonna I'm gonna leave
[00:06:21] that one to L but I have a new Co and
[00:06:22] that was a pretty nice one I actually
[00:06:24] might have a double of that so that
[00:06:25] might end up going into something later
[00:06:27] but I got another thing from our friend
[00:06:30] here I want to open it up also I don't
[00:06:33] know what this one was I can't remember
[00:06:35] what this one
[00:06:39] was yeah makes
[00:06:42] sense I might do some pre-release myself
[00:06:45] I'm gonna have to go over if um if I
[00:06:46] can't get my stuff early I might go over
[00:06:48] to do some pre-release

[00:06:53] row
[00:06:55] huh I picked something up from them
[00:06:59] that's interesting yeah it makes sense
[00:07:01] that they would do it on Friday the 13th
[00:07:03] I mean that that's hor you
[00:07:07] know all right I know I might end up

[00:13:00] like saying it there we go oh there's my
[00:13:04] other pen I thought I lost it I didn't I
[00:13:07] it was just there in the
[00:13:10] background yeah see I have precons
[00:13:12] mainly myself I
[00:13:14] um I do uh use I upgrade some of them
[00:13:18] sometimes but not all of
[00:13:20] them I don't really get a chance to all
[00:13:22] the
[00:13:26] time see what that is ah ah not a big
[00:13:29] one there nothing
[00:13:32] spectacular but you know what maybe that
[00:13:34] can be one of the rares that goes in
[00:13:36] later oh somebody pulls out a rare that
[00:13:39] might be the one that goes in we'll have
[00:13:41] to find
[00:13:42] out maybe that's what'll happen I'm
[00:13:45] going put the receipt over there recept
[00:13:48] now I have to go and figure out that I
[00:13:49] can do some other stuff I was told so
[00:13:51] I'm going to have to go and H A myself
[00:13:52] on a purchasing Hiatus for a minute
[00:13:54] myself so I can go and do my business
[00:13:56] stuff to
[00:13:57] everything Lego in is giving me ideas
[00:14:00] for a deck box but I'll probably bring
[00:14:02] it C well you could you could dragon all
[00:14:06] right so here's something that you can
[00:14:07] do you can take little dots of um I
[00:14:12] think it's the blue Loctite it's not the
[00:14:14] one that sticks together permanently
[00:14:16] it's the one that sticks together like
[00:14:17] kind of for a little while and take a
[00:14:18] little dot of it and put it on the Block
[00:14:21] that way it'll stick together but not
[00:14:23] permanently and you can supposedly take
[00:14:24] it off with like a little bit of acetone
[00:14:26] or something or some rubbing alcohol
[00:14:28] also so if you need a Le like take them
[00:14:30] apart you could do that I used to work
[00:14:32] uh with lots of different freaking [ __ ]
[00:14:34] that I know
[00:14:36] enough I know some weird
[00:14:42] things uh I hate USPS doing USPS
[00:14:46] things I did not see your new Tok I did
[00:14:48] see oh I saw the oh the waiu one yes I
[00:14:51] saw that one I'm going to be at magikon
[00:14:54] everybody too yeah we'll be over there
[00:14:57] soon yeah so so if you guys want to yeah
[00:15:01] all right but we do have here's our
[00:15:02] break today I'm going to show you guys
[00:15:04] all everything that we have for our
[00:15:05] break we have our break today we have
[00:15:08] seven spots left in it so let's
[00:15:11] hopefully we can get through it so this
[00:15:12] is what we're at we have three bloomo
[00:15:15] two
[00:15:15] Exelon two ravnik draft two modern
[00:15:19] Horizon set two modern Horizon 3 play
[00:15:22] boosters two Commander Masters draft a
[00:15:24] bloomo collector booster and a modern
[00:15:26] Horizon 3 collector booster and this is
[00:15:29] going to go like the old the same way
[00:15:30] like the other one the big this is but
[00:15:32] we just renamed it a little bit we like
[00:15:33] the different name of it so we renamed
[00:15:35] it to biggest losers break so what
[00:15:37] happens is whoever's The Biggest Loser
[00:15:39] in the
[00:15:40] break comes out with the commander Mass
[00:15:42] the commander deck here the person that
[00:15:45] comes out with uh the second biggest
[00:15:47] loser gets the collector booster sample
[00:15:50] pack in here that way everybody doesn't
[00:15:53] feel like they're coming away with
[00:15:54] nothing if you get the bottom and you
[00:15:56] get like $2 worth of stuff or a dollar
[00:15:58] worth of stff that way you have a better
[00:16:00] chance of getting something fun but we
[00:16:02] also have our boosters and everything
[00:16:03] else like that over there you guys want
[00:16:05] to hang
[00:16:06] out everybody wanted to lose I know it
[00:16:09] makes everybody want to lose instead of
[00:16:11] win it's a tri it's a little it's a
[00:16:12] different it's Unique who who wants to
[00:16:15] lose regularly you know who's the person
[00:16:18] that wants to lose not many people
[00:16:20] generally want to lose but today you do

[00:22:29] collect ah cool well if I end up
[00:22:31] catching any of them Dragon I'll let you
[00:22:32] know um because I do buy these regularly
[00:22:35] from um a couple different sources try
[00:22:37] to get like cheap things in just to like
[00:22:38] these fun things to throw out little
[00:22:40] extras um and um they're like I said
[00:22:43] they're all under a dollar so it's not
[00:22:45] anything giant that you're going to be
[00:22:46] getting but I mean who knows maybe one
[00:22:48] like somebody the other day a few months
[00:22:50] back actually like one of the the uh
[00:22:53] what was it cards gi. Joe card they got
[00:22:56] one that was a red lipped uh
[00:23:00] uh what was it Snake Eyes maybe or Cobra
[00:23:03] Commander or something like that it was
[00:23:04] like a $300
[00:23:06] card that's no way good morning mad
[00:23:09] how's it going my friend but anyways
[00:23:12] we're gonna get to having some fun here
[00:23:13] we have that break still available
[00:23:15] there's only three people in it so far
[00:23:17] we have Joe dropper RAM and famous now
[00:23:20] for those of you that had a question
[00:23:21] about how the breaks go and worrying
[00:23:23] about if um you can't break over
[00:23:25] multiple streams I'm have I'm going to
[00:23:27] explain something something the way that
[00:23:29] I understood it now if I get in trouble
[00:23:31] for the way they then this is It's
[00:23:33] because this is how I understood it here
[00:23:34] and if somebody gets me in if I get in
[00:23:36] trouble for it then uh well so be it I
[00:23:38] guess but K fud here you go my friend
[00:23:41] you got a Wither and Bloom all right not
[00:23:43] a big hit Kay fud but it gets you a
[00:23:45] discount on shipping could you get me a
[00:23:48] number between one and uh 10 though my
[00:23:50] friend Kay
[00:23:51] fud that way we can know what our next
[00:23:54] one will be here coming
[00:23:56] out so the way I stood it was if you
[00:23:59] have a break I have to ship it to you
[00:24:01] guys within the two days the break has
[00:24:02] to be done within two days so I can do
[00:24:04] the shipping within the two day shipping
[00:24:06] of you ordering it initially now if the
[00:24:09] break but I cannot open any packs of
[00:24:16] cards before the break has been
[00:24:19] completely bought out so I can't open it
[00:24:21] in one stream some packs and open in
[00:24:23] another stream another pack and open
[00:24:25] other streams another pack so it all has
[00:24:27] to be done in one stream together where
[00:24:28] everybody sees everything open together
[00:24:30] now if I misunderstood something there
[00:24:32] then I am sorry about that and I will
[00:24:35] correct anything but I'm pretty sure my
[00:24:37] understanding was that brakes have to be
[00:24:39] shipped out within the two days of being
[00:24:42] purchased but they all have to be open
[00:24:44] in one stream they cannot be opened over
[00:24:46] multiple streams that's why you can't
[00:24:47] break over multiple
[00:24:49] streams but if I misunderstood that then
[00:24:52] we'll see one two 3 four
[00:24:56] five so we we'll see what it happens
[00:24:59] there I'll Pro so if I'm Gone by the way
[00:25:02] if I'm suspended at any point for a
[00:25:03] couple days or a week or so just go to
[00:25:07] YouTube and check me out there I'll
[00:25:08] still be streaming all over the place I
[00:25:09] still stream everywhere I don't ever
[00:25:11] stop there's there's multiple places and
[00:25:13] ways for me to do it I like it here
[00:25:15] though because the community is nice
[00:25:17] that's kind of the reason why I keep
[00:25:18] coming back but if I'm gone make sure
[00:25:21] you do like and subscribe and put that
[00:25:22] like notification Bell on and your thing
[00:25:24] because you'll find me all over but
[00:25:26] either way though that's why and if you
[00:25:28] happen to see that I happen to not be
[00:25:30] around for a little while well then
[00:25:33] there's your reason why because my
[00:25:35] understanding was not accurate but I
[00:25:38] have read a lot of legal
[00:25:40] documentation due to the job that I had
[00:25:42] in the past I had to actually update
[00:25:43] legal documentation on a regular basis I
[00:25:45] had lawyers literally telling me to
[00:25:46] change one word at times I mean like I
[00:25:49] had to spend hours changing one word in
[00:25:51] documents because it was I did the like
[00:25:52] the background uh development of some of
[00:25:55] the applications that they used to make
[00:25:58] uh
[00:25:59] like legal documents so yeah exactly one
[00:26:02] word can literally change everything
[00:26:04] like seriously it was like one time it
[00:26:07] was like not even the word it was
[00:26:08] putting
[00:26:12] um oh what was it it was like putting in
[00:26:15] on it instead I'm like it it
[00:26:17] grammatically that doesn't make sense
[00:26:18] like well legally it does we need to do
[00:26:20] that legally I'm like what like there's
[00:26:24] a legal definition versus like a like a
[00:26:26] real definition like when I started
[00:26:28] working there I'm like what the what so
[00:26:32] I went and had to go and look it up like
[00:26:33] you got to be [ __ ] me this is going
[00:26:34] to be confusing as all hell I mean I did
[00:26:35] it for about almost 40 years and after a
[00:26:38] while I finally caught on to it I'm like
[00:26:40] oh all right now that's a that's a legal
[00:26:42] definition all right I need to change it
[00:26:44] so it's legally the legal word not the
[00:26:47] uh not the grammatically English
[00:26:50] word oh yeah it does dude oh
[00:26:54] yeah oh I am too I am too I have um uh I
[00:26:57] think about six I about 12 12 to 14
[00:27:02] boxes coming in if you guys are
[00:27:03] interested in aan and I also have six
[00:27:05] boxes of um beta coming in if you guys
[00:27:07] are intrigued in that by any chance but
[00:27:10] anyways yeah my little story about
[00:27:13] dealing with legal writing stuff I mean
[00:27:14] it yeah I didn't realize how bad it was
[00:27:17] until I got in there and I was like oh
[00:27:18] my God my brain's sometime hurting like
[00:27:21] I I just like the legal Dragon confused
[00:27:23] the [ __ ] out of me for a definitely ass
[00:27:25] solid like year and a half then I
[00:27:28] started to catch on to it and now I can
[00:27:30] read some of that when I look at
[00:27:31] documents I'm like oh I understand that
[00:27:33] that does not mean that my wife say oh
[00:27:35] this I'm like no that's not what it
[00:27:37] means that means this like no I'm like
[00:27:38] go read the legal word of that one
[00:27:40] because that's the legal word that's not
[00:27:41] the word you're thinking people oh my
[00:27:43] God that's ridiculous my I
[00:27:48] know turned yours into
[00:27:51] garbage some cards do need lawers to
[00:27:53] translate them I like that all right so

[00:38:34] all right cool guy I'm sorry you did not
[00:38:37] get anything with that so what I'm going
[00:38:39] to let you do let's give you one do you
[00:38:40] want to
[00:38:42] go with that card or that card left or
[00:38:46] right we're going to give you one extra
[00:38:47] see what
[00:38:49] happens let's
[00:38:52] try left or right going to go left all
[00:38:55] right we're going to go left
[00:38:58] beroth the ancient from Commander
[00:39:01] Masters I am sorry we did not have any
[00:39:04] big hit on that one
[00:39:06] there we tried though got a little
[00:39:11] extra meme
[00:39:14] number but you got a nice foil a few
[00:39:17] Commander Masters cards you might be
[00:39:18] able to use there it is a little bit of
[00:39:21] one it's kind of like it's just like a
[00:39:22] pack just like a pack of cards kind of
[00:39:25] you know that's the thing like I try to
[00:39:27] build them where it would be similar to
[00:39:28] a pack of cards the odds if that makes
[00:39:31] any sense that's why I've always done
[00:39:33] them the way I do it that's why they're
[00:39:35] not like big that's why I don't charge
[00:39:37] like you know that's why I don't do like
[00:39:38] the some some people like in different
[00:39:39] ones I've seen like some of the Pokemon
[00:39:41] streams do it before where they're like
[00:39:43] $400 for something like I can't I can't
[00:39:45] justify doing that when they get a card
[00:39:47] that's like a that's a card that's been
[00:39:52] um graded whatever they call graded and
[00:39:55] it's like a 30 Cent card like that
[00:39:57] doesn't seem ethically acceptable to me
[00:40:02] so I'm not going to do
[00:40:08] that that's why I try to make it so it's
[00:40:10] like not ridiculous you
[00:40:11] know but that was a try there we did try
[00:40:15] I am sorry I am sorry but hey we gave
[00:40:18] you a little extra on that one we always
[00:40:20] try to give you extra if we don't have

[00:41:49] when the one of the guys that worked at
[00:41:51] one of these places hey good morning
[00:41:55] semi he uh
[00:41:58] was Korean and during I don't know if it
[00:42:02] was a Korean war or World War II one of
[00:42:05] the two of them he was like a spy for
[00:42:08] the United
[00:42:09] States called them rollers all
[00:42:15] right and he being the spy for the us
[00:42:18] one of the things that they did was once
[00:42:20] everything was over he got um like he
[00:42:22] ended up getting like a lot of good
[00:42:23] benefits and he ended up uh living in
[00:42:25] the US here being come over being a
[00:42:29] spy um and the thing one of the funniest
[00:42:33] things he ever ever happened was he's
[00:42:35] like he ended up his family has had
[00:42:37] three houses and he was going to buy oh
[00:42:39] he was going to buy his third house
[00:42:41] actually um and he like on the ocean
[00:42:44] somewhere in
[00:42:46] Virginia oh rollers oh thank you thank
[00:42:49] you and what happened was the this guy
[00:42:52] he was talking with him one day and he's
[00:42:53] like how are you buying a third house
[00:42:55] like I know how much you make I'm I'm
[00:42:56] the manager here he like oh well I I
[00:42:58] used to be a spy during during the war
[00:43:01] so I'm getting some benefits there and
[00:43:02] he's like well like my understanding
[00:43:04] that's not a ton of benefits like yeah
[00:43:06] no it's not a allot of benefits like so
[00:43:07] how do you afford three houses here like
[00:43:09] this is weird like then the Korean guy
[00:43:11] goes well you American you you you
[00:43:13] you're lazy and you eat too much that's
[00:43:16] why you're fat and the guy looks the guy
[00:43:19] was a bigger guy and it wasn't small and
[00:43:21] he's like uh excuse me he's like yeah
[00:43:23] see we my family here we have whole
[00:43:26] family in one house
[00:43:28] whole family in the one house then we
[00:43:30] eat rice I buy a big bag of rice and I
[00:43:33] eat rice and a little piece of meat for
[00:43:37] whole
[00:43:38] family but you on the other hand you eat
[00:43:43] whole piece of meat for you a little bit
[00:43:45] of rice for
[00:43:47] family that's why I buy I was able to
[00:43:50] buy my third house and you are on barely
[00:43:54] a house I'm like h ining the way he
[00:43:57] thinks about that it's like like there's
[00:44:00] a couple other things like those kind of
[00:44:02] things like that exam that he's like
[00:44:04] that's an example of why we have three
[00:44:05] houses and you have one
[00:44:07] house like oh all right buying
[00:44:10] unnecessary things for
[00:44:13] people but he did say it a little
[00:44:15] differently I can't say it the same way
[00:44:17] he did it made it a little bit more
[00:44:18] humorous I'd probably get in
[00:44:23] trouble yeah exactly so they get to
[00:44:25] split out like not everybody's in the
[00:44:26] house all time because they have three
[00:44:27] of them someone might be in the vacation
[00:44:29] house cuz they're taking a vacation
[00:44:30] someone might be in the other house that
[00:44:32] they have that they were where I can't
[00:44:34] remember wherever it was with their
[00:44:35] family in there so they they built it
[00:44:40] up it was just
[00:44:43] intriguing yeah it was intriguing the
[00:44:47] way the take on their life was and it
[00:44:48] was pretty cool though how they handled
[00:44:49] it and he's like yeah I have a my family
[00:44:51] gets to use we family all get to use

[01:05:05] some of the games with you because the
[01:05:07] cool thing is the reason why I do the

[01:05:42] famous was the first one then it would
[01:05:43] be go Ram actually it might have been
[01:05:45] jofer was the first one either way we

[01:09:50] collector booster and a Beyond booster
[01:09:51] in here too I didn't
[01:09:53] realize which one should I open
[01:10:00] well the monoc cryp pack could be one of
[01:10:01] those ones right there yeah I don't know
[01:10:03] Assassin's Creed all right should we go
[01:10:05] the Beyond or The
[01:10:07] Collector famous said Assassin's Creed
[01:10:10] first so we're going to go that
[01:10:13] collector all right let's do it this is
[01:10:14] the LA that was a random one sitting
[01:10:16] around I didn't know I had that left I
[01:10:18] found it in a box the other day didn't
[01:10:20] even know I had this left here so we're
[01:10:22] going to see what we get out of this
[01:10:23] maybe we'll get some good good luck out
[01:10:25] of here I don't
[01:10:26] know here we go it was it wasn't great
[01:10:30] but I I will have to admit I do like the
[01:10:32] the uh the swords and um like if you can
[01:10:36] get I mean if you get a serialized card
[01:10:38] that would be awesome too they it wasn't
[01:10:40] the best of them I have to admit it was
[01:10:42] not the best so hey let's see what we
[01:10:44] get
[01:10:45] here good luck my friends we're going to
[01:10:48] see if we get anything fun with
[01:10:52] this Assassin's gauntlet
[01:10:56] smoke
[01:10:58] bomb Escape
[01:11:01] detection abaza ARB arbaz Mir the foil
[01:11:08] showcase smoke bomb foil atch all right
[01:11:11] we're coming in with junk in this pack
[01:11:12] here we go the junk pack oh definitely
[01:11:16] lackluster PLS the the I think the best
[01:11:19] thing is probably the art on the lands
[01:11:21] in these
[01:11:23] personally Sean and Rebecca
[01:11:26] agents I have not seen that one yet
[01:11:28] interesting I'll have to check that one
[01:11:30] out Royal
[01:11:33] assassin Basim I iben isak in the
[01:11:37] borderless
[01:11:39] Showcase I've not seen that one yet
[01:11:42] interesting and then a of Alexandria and
[01:11:45] the foil
[01:11:47] etched with an assassin
[01:11:50] token the art was good they were just
[01:11:52] the cards were just uh yeah they weren't
[01:11:54] they were not
[01:11:56] monetarily valuable in any way shape or
[01:11:59] form so those people that buy things to
[01:12:02] like collect in that aspect you
[01:12:04] definitely didn't come out with anything
[01:12:05] in these
[01:12:08] ones
[01:12:10] but they are cool playing cards though
[01:12:12] there are some good ones if you want to
[01:12:14] make like an assassin
[01:12:15] deck I know smoke bomb ET
[01:12:20] yay I'm me I put all my rares and stuff
[01:12:23] and everything like that in sleeves so I
[01:12:26] have to check out the uh Shawn and
[01:12:27] Rebecca I don't know what that one is I
[01:12:29] haven't seen that one before that's I
[01:12:30] think probably like a 10- cent card my
[01:12:32] bet
[01:12:33] is I'm betting that that whole pack
[01:12:36] right here the big things out of that
[01:12:37] got me about maybe three
[01:12:40] cents we'll find
[01:12:49] out true so
[01:12:52] true I played against the Family Matters
[01:12:55] back and didn't realize how broken it
[01:13:03] was oh really Wizards really got to stop
[01:13:07] trying to push less and less card yes
[01:13:09] the less cards for pack I did not like I
[01:13:11] have to admit that that is very
[01:13:13] frustrating because there's no reason
[01:13:15] for there to be less cards in the pack
[01:13:18] unless I mean I know some people like
[01:13:20] they say like oh well it's you know you
[01:13:22] don't get any of like the uh junk cards
[01:13:24] out of the uncommons are uncommons and
[01:13:26] stuff like that the bulk but you know
[01:13:28] what the other cards end up being bulk
[01:13:30] because they not worth anything because
[01:13:31] there's no other things to show the
[01:13:33] lower ones of it you know what I mean if
[01:13:34] that makes any sense all right Dewey
[01:13:38] Dewey Louie Dey Lou way oh whoa way got
[01:13:44] all anyways you got a uh revitalizing
[01:13:46] the
[01:13:51] past Steve urle the commander I know
[01:13:58] yeah exactly nothing is worth anything
[01:13:59] yeah you can't move anything because
[01:14:01] it's nothing wor worth
[01:14:03] anything
[01:14:05] Dewey
[01:14:07] Louie you can give me a number between
[01:14:09] one and 10 my friend I would very much
[01:14:11] appreciate
[01:14:14] that that way we can know what our next
[01:14:17] giveaway will end up being here oh nine
[01:14:19] I got it thank you my friend I see
[01:14:20] number nine
[01:14:25] Shuffle up one two three four five six
[01:14:28] seven eight nine all right let's see oh
[01:14:30] there was 11 in there dang it I have an
[01:14:32] extra card in there last time all right
[01:14:34] well thank you you're very welcome Dewey
[01:14:37] thank you for coming in hanging
[01:14:42] out yes exactly everything shifts over
[01:14:45] in their monetary value if you remove
[01:14:47] all the ones that are low while all the
[01:14:48] other ones are be low then then none the
[01:14:50] rare ones are going to be worth anything
[01:14:52] so I don't know it's just it's a little
[01:14:54] silly to me but at the same time I kind
[01:14:57] of understand it I just wouldn't I I
[01:15:01] don't think it is a smart play on their
[01:15:07] part but they haven't been making smart
[01:15:10] they haven't been making the best of
[01:15:11] smart plays all the time anyway so you
[01:15:13] know you just kind of go with what what
[01:15:14] they got I don't if that makes any sense
[01:15:16] there too
[01:15:27] get all these cards a little organized
[01:15:28] here ah there we go there we
[01:15:32] go all
[01:15:37] right I will definitely peek your post
[01:15:39] on the
[01:15:41] break that' be pretty funny on the card
[01:15:43] hey you can make a proxy kle
[01:15:47] card that might be what it is they don't
[01:15:49] like when the uncommons or Commons get
[01:15:50] really expensive so they have to put
[01:15:52] some way in to like uh hold them back
[01:15:55] all right I guess I I can see what
[01:15:57] you're saying cuz like um in Lord of the
[01:15:59] Rings and some of the other ones they
[01:16:00] did get kind of up there on some of the
[01:16:01] comons and uncommons for a little while
[01:16:03] until they reprinted the um like that
[01:16:06] special edition set so that makes a
[01:16:08] little bit of sense how's it going
[01:16:12] Bob ill we are doing um hopefully we'll
[01:16:15] be getting through some of these
[01:16:19] today yeah exactly exactly not good for
[01:16:22] standard not too bad not too bad we're
[01:16:25] um we're trying to get our break going

[01:20:27] it
[01:20:28] black black
[01:20:31] bunker I'm trying to figure out a reason

[01:55:14] did drop in general yeah I noticed that
[01:55:17] it dropped in general I mean there's um
[01:55:19] so yeah I noticed it did drop I think uh
[01:55:22] the the um Bannings of some of the
[01:55:25] things from Modern Horizon cause all of
[01:55:27] it to drop which is really I get
[01:55:29] frustrated with the Banning of things
[01:55:30] like if you make a card it shouldn't be
[01:55:31] banned for a little while for for a set
[01:55:34] it shouldn't be banned like a couple
[01:55:35] months
[01:55:36] later that thing that kind of annoys me
[01:55:39] like I can understand like six months or
[01:55:41] so oh really it dropped all right we're
[01:55:44] gonna put that back I can understand
[01:55:46] like six months or so because that used
[01:55:47] to be like a $5 dollar
[01:55:48] card like five to six months maybe but
[01:55:51] not like
[01:55:53] right
[01:55:53] away all right
[01:55:55] Dragon you've got a smoke bomb all right
[01:56:00] all right I need a number between one

[01:56:04] way we can see if our next giveaway will

[01:56:15] oy Dragon J Koy
[01:56:22] one
[01:56:25] two yeah was 15 last week oh
[01:56:31] wow yeah see that's just crazy I means
[01:56:34] like like so many people I don't know I
[01:56:36] hate I hate that stuff personally I
[01:56:38] don't like how they do the Banning on
[01:56:40] those things that quickly on stuff it
[01:56:42] frustrates me personally I think it's
[01:56:44] one of those ones like you need to do it
[01:56:50] later nice
[01:56:54] yeah exactly before the ban it was like
[01:56:56] $50 card now it's like a $3 card and I
[01:56:59] like I don't even care about that it's
[01:57:01] as much as why you making something that
[01:57:02] you're going to ban instantly one two
[01:57:05] three four five six seven eight I think
[01:57:10] that's what it is I don't even care
[01:57:11] about the value as much it's more why
[01:57:13] you getting something that you're
[01:57:15] Banning instantly like that is

[01:57:53] for a nice rare and a loyal subordinate
[01:57:55] with a city's blessing like what they
[01:57:58] need to be doing is what they need to be
[01:58:00] doing is Banning the cards that are like
[01:58:02] a a year or two old that are allowing it
[01:58:04] to do those crazy things they shouldn't
[01:58:06] be banning the card
[01:58:12] instantly yeah they they ban him in
[01:58:14] modern uh more then they ban them in
[01:58:16] other things um but they do sometimes
[01:58:19] ban them in in uh commander and other
[01:58:21] sets too but very
[01:58:26] rarely yeah see like well not even the
[01:58:29] one ring I'm saying like yeah yeah you
[01:58:31] leave that arone I have a feeling they
[01:58:32] can never touch that one or some of the
[01:58:34] Fallout things
[01:58:40] specifically oh dragon's not that much
[01:58:44] wow yeah but anyways like I like what
[01:58:47] they need to be doing is like instead of
[01:58:49] canc instead of like getting all like
[01:58:50] like like Banning certain
[01:58:53] cards like instantly from a new set they
[01:58:55] should be banning the cards that are
[01:58:57] making it do the infinite thing one two
[01:59:00] three four five six seven eight the ones
[01:59:03] that have been out for a little while

[02:58:27] for you guys you're very
[02:58:30] welcome and this is what I was going to
[02:58:32] do here quickly all right that pack
[02:58:34] right there we like to do uh things at
[02:58:37] the end of the stream I call them like
[02:58:39] buyers
[02:58:40] giveaways because we do them
[02:58:43] cheap we do it like
[02:58:45] this I Coria
[02:58:49] if you want it not the end of the
[02:58:55] stream Frank is a good one definitely
[02:58:58] give him a follow
[02:59:01] there what the
[02:59:04] uh what this I have to do at the
[02:59:12] beginning I'm
[02:59:16] sorry no no no I do a little different
[02:59:19] all right oh Ashley the reason why I do
[02:59:21] buyers giveaways when I say sometimes I
[02:59:22] do it this way is I put them on cheap so
[02:59:24] if somebody doesn't jump in on it and
[02:59:25] you can get it for a dollar or it's a
[02:59:27] metaphorical buyer giveaway yes
[02:59:29] metaphorical yes because a lot of times
[02:59:31] people will do form fill out a form and
[02:59:33] like we had the other day somebody
[02:59:34] filled out a form and ended up getting
[02:59:36] the cards packs so the way I like to do
[02:59:38] it is do it where it's very cheap like
[02:59:40] $2 on there and then you get to get the
[02:59:44] potential of getting it at a very cheap
[02:59:46] price because you're a buyer and you
[02:59:47] already bought something and Shi
[02:59:48] shipping is already already paid for so
[02:59:50] it's just getting it like maybe $2 you
[02:59:52] might get the pack for all right here we
[02:59:53] go yeps let's get you some good luck
[02:59:55] though my friend cathartic reunion

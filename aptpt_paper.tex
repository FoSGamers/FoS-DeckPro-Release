\title{APTPT: A Robust, High-Dimensional Adaptive Feedback Control Framework for Noisy, Real-World Systems}

\begin{abstract}
This paper presents APTPT (Adaptive Phase-Targeted Pulse/Trajectory), a universal adaptive feedback control protocol for high-dimensional systems in noisy, non-ideal environments. We systematically map the convergence phase diagram, error floors, and phase boundaries, providing a full analytic and empirical guide to robust, scalable control even with significant noise and disturbance. All simulation code, data, and results are openly available, providing a reproducible engineering recipe for deploying automation in robotics, distributed sensors, marine systems, and advanced cyber-physical systems. This work establishes a new standard for open, scalable, self-tuning feedback control and demystifies the boundaries between stable, tunable, and fundamentally uncontrollable regimes.

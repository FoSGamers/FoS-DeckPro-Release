[00:06:46] have how's everybody's m going then we
[00:06:49] have like I said I was a little behind
[00:06:51] here but it was mainly because I had to
[00:06:53] deal with some issues with
[00:06:54] eBay um frakin
[00:07:00] they um so somebody has not sent me a
[00:07:02] package they they pretty much lied to me
[00:07:04] multiple times but for some reason eBay
[00:07:06] is like backing them and if they go and
[00:07:09] look at the chat you can see that they
[00:07:10] lied multiple times they sent me
[00:07:11] tracking that was an Amazon snippet of
[00:07:14] somebody tracking a package I'm like uh
[00:07:17] that's not mine how you can send me
[00:07:18] something from Amazon and they're like
[00:07:20] oh oh oh sorry that that's uh it was
[00:07:22] transferred to Amazon for something for
[00:07:24] delivery I'm like that doesn't sound
[00:07:27] right uh um then they said said oh wait
[00:07:30] no it went it went through FedEx and
[00:07:31] then they gave me a FedEx thing but it
[00:07:33] doesn't have my address on it just says
[00:07:35] my town and that's it it was signed by
[00:07:37] somebody with not my name I'm like
[00:07:39] really
[00:07:44] guys like
[00:07:46] seriously like that's how you're going
[00:07:48] to handle this and you're going to say
[00:07:49] that I'm the one that has to deal with
[00:07:50] this and call the police they told me to
[00:07:53] call the police call FedEx or good luck
[00:07:57] I'm like are you kidding me eBay
[00:07:59] I've never dealt with like this
[00:08:00] this bad with you guys before normally
[00:08:02] you put help in and you like actually do
[00:08:05] something to do support the
[00:08:07] people not this
[00:08:11] time so I sent any response back to them
[00:08:14] hopefully they're going to address it
[00:08:16] but you know we'll see what happens
[00:08:20] here I don't have much um hope saying
[00:08:24] that they did
[00:08:26] not um really want to do any help in the
[00:08:29] first place
[00:08:32] so
[00:08:35] yeah it
[00:08:38] sucks I know they are usually helpful
[00:08:40] I'm like you I'm like can you read the
[00:08:41] chat please that's all I'm
[00:08:43] asking you read the chat please go and
[00:08:46] look at the chat that's there and read
[00:08:48] it if you do that you'll
[00:08:51] see that they've lied multiple times
[00:09:00] how can I believe anything that you said
[00:09:01] and then then the the package label he
[00:09:03] say is AR even delivered
[00:09:13] me it's just crazy just crazy how they
[00:09:16] could even do that like I don't
[00:09:19] understand it like thoroughly don't
[00:09:21] understand
[00:09:23] it to me it's it's like one of those
[00:09:25] things like wait a minute like did they
[00:09:27] have just a robot responding now is
[00:09:29] actually what I started questioning like
[00:09:31] is it only like a robot that responds
[00:09:33] now and they they have an AI that
[00:09:34] responds they don't know how to be a
[00:09:36] person to look into something and that's
[00:09:37] why this is such an issue right now is
[00:09:40] what I'm guessing I'm hoping so like I
[00:09:42] respond I'm like guys if this is an AI
[00:09:44] responding can you please give me a
[00:09:46] person to look at this and actually look
[00:09:48] at the chat so that you can actually and
[00:09:50] see what's going on here because
[00:09:52] currently it seems like there is a robot
[00:09:54] responding with
[00:09:56] policies I would very much prefer like a
[00:09:59] person
[00:10:00] here so anyways we're going to close
[00:10:03] this up here and then I'm going to have
[00:10:04] to go and change the music in the
[00:10:06] background because that is not mine
[00:10:08] right
[00:10:10] now yeah we can do this
[00:10:14] better yeah just frustrating that I even
[00:10:16] have to deal with it in the first
[00:10:21] place there you
[00:10:25] go whatever though
[00:10:32] and that's
[00:10:34] uh no one's picks
[00:10:41] one all right let's see uh if anybody
[00:10:44] wants to
[00:10:45] play some break have a break today and
[00:10:48] see what we get for uh some fun good
[00:10:51] luck that like I said normally the kids
[00:10:52] have good luck and they pick stuff out
[00:10:54] so we'll see if they have it again today
[00:10:56] last few days they've had it is the
[00:10:58] First Foundation collector Bruce they've
[00:11:00] done in a while so I'm hoping that this
[00:11:02] is a good one can I put some ads outside
[00:11:05] no you cannot William you have to be
[00:11:06] doing that with an adult come on buddy
[00:11:08] that's a silly question William go do
[00:11:10] what your mother told you to do actually
[00:11:12] if You' like and if you in a few minutes
[00:11:13] I need you to I'd like you to do
[00:11:14] something I'll ask you but right now you
[00:11:16] need to do what your mom does so told
[00:11:17] you to so you can show you're doing the
[00:11:18] right thing she told you to read didn't
[00:11:21] she no all right I thought she did so go
[00:11:23] read for a little while and we'll see
[00:11:25] what that I'm pretty sure she
[00:11:28] did no she didn't no she didn't
[00:11:32] hey brakes yes I can definitely explain
[00:11:35] how brakes work um sorry about that uh
[00:11:38] so what we would do here is we take all
[00:11:40] of so in whatever break it is so this
[00:11:42] one would be Will's one for instance I'd
[00:11:43] open all these packs we take all the
[00:11:46] mythics the rares and then a uncommon or
[00:11:49] common that is $3 or
[00:11:50] more um and we put them in sleeves like
[00:11:53] the top loaders here I mean and the
[00:11:55] penny sleeves we shuffle them up and we
[00:11:57] hand them out to everybody based on the
[00:11:58] order that they picked them they bought
[00:12:00] they bought their stuff so like for
[00:12:01] instance say you bought spot one then
[00:12:03] spot one would be the first you'd get
[00:12:05] the first cards and then we hand them
[00:12:06] out it's like a dealing H so we deal
[00:12:07] them all out here and then after that
[00:12:09] all the commons and uncommons I hand
[00:12:11] them out before I start shipping because
[00:12:13] um just hand them out quickly move
[00:12:15] through everybody unless I get some time
[00:12:16] at the end of a stream sometimes I do it
[00:12:17] at the end of a
[00:12:18] stream yeah
[00:12:30] oh wow that's
[00:12:34] interesting interesting I don't know if
[00:12:36] I like
[00:12:39] that I don't like that when did that
[00:12:41] happen can I speak to the manager I know
[00:12:44] that's really what I need to do I didn't
[00:12:45] even say speak to the manager I just was
[00:12:46] like you know what guys I have enough
[00:12:47] knowledge and experience from working
[00:12:49] with like I work with uh that with what
[00:12:52] do you call it before the um the
[00:12:54] insurance companies so I used to write
[00:12:56] the documentation for them
[00:12:59] [Music]
[00:13:01] so the documentation that they have for
[00:13:03] the most part I used to
[00:13:07] write I'm like guys so I go and look at
[00:13:09] their documentation and I grab some
[00:13:11] links I'm like come on here you go guys
[00:13:13] come on just do what you're do
[00:13:14] what you're supposed to please I'm being
[00:13:15] nice here now all right uh what was I
[00:13:18] doing I was looking at this here oh
[00:13:19] that's why I was going to pull up my
[00:13:20] stuff so I can easily have the uh
[00:13:22] giveaways running because I can't find
[00:13:23] where they are running quickly there we
[00:13:25] go but yeah so if you want to jump into
[00:13:27] one of those brakes there that's that
[00:13:28] there and we'll get more giveaways there
[00:13:30] that's how we do the the giveaways there
[00:13:32] yeah it's it's pretty funny Pro I just
[00:13:34] kind of
[00:13:35] laugh what's in this Nolan's break the
[00:13:38] Nolan break for this one is we have
[00:13:40] these packs we have dungeons murders
[00:13:43] Dorn lost Caverns Ravnica double Masters
[00:13:48] and then a foundations collector and
[00:13:50] then in the one that's the wills break
[00:13:52] he picked these ones you got bloomo
[00:13:54] dungeons duskmourn Ravnica time spiral
[00:13:58] double feature and rabik
[00:14:01] yeah it's it's just
[00:14:02] funny that's shitty that these people
[00:14:04] trying to scam You Luke I'm sorry about
[00:14:06] that don't we try not to say any names
[00:14:08] but if you want to send me one privately
[00:14:09] let me know that's
[00:14:12] fine you told to
[00:14:17] twice yeah let's take this scam package
[00:14:19] Supreme Court I'm not going to take it
[00:14:20] the Supreme Court but I have enough
[00:14:21] information that I can like copy and
[00:14:24] paste their documentation be like you
[00:14:25] guys this is what your documentation
[00:14:27] says um for what it says about in
[00:14:30] regards to your policies so if your
[00:14:32] policies are this and this is what's
[00:14:34] going on you're breaking your policies
[00:14:35] blah blah blah and I can show it because
[00:14:37] I I wrote policies for insurance
[00:14:40] companies I used to be the guy that went
[00:14:42] in and they'd write them I'd have to
[00:14:44] rewrite them all out on the computer so
[00:14:46] that they would go automatically
[00:14:47] programmed in so I had them I was the
[00:14:49] one programming the policies to pull
[00:14:51] from each place to do the correct
[00:14:52] policies the right names right locations
[00:14:54] blah blah blah blah blah when it pulled
[00:14:56] them automatically whenever they have a
[00:14:57] case I was a guy that programmed all
[00:14:58] that stuff in the background for lawyers
[00:15:00] for a while so I'm like for sake
[00:15:02] just follow the policy godamn
[00:15:04] it yeah that's all I'm asking do what
[00:15:07] you're supposed to that's all I'm not
[00:15:08] saying do something out of the ordinary
[00:15:10] I'm just saying do what you're supposed
[00:15:11] to that's
[00:15:13] all that's it that's all I ask but yeah
[00:15:16] those are the breaks there by the way
[00:15:18] but what we're going to do I'm going to
[00:15:19] do though we have a couple of packs here
[00:15:20] that our children had for us setting out
[00:15:23] here for a little while it's just insane
[00:15:25] how people just think they can I don't
[00:15:27] know just crazy just crazy to me got hey
[00:15:31] Gustav is that you buddy angry buffalo
[00:15:34] fan is that you could that potentially
[00:15:36] be you um um Mr may I don't know maybe
[00:15:42] but
[00:15:43] anyways I swear I'm not being a Karen
[00:15:45] yeah I'm definitely not being a Karen no
[00:15:48] I am being a Karen in this
[00:15:49] aspect I don't care I'm like you just
[00:15:51] follow the policy because if you're not
[00:15:53] going to do anything I don't care but at
[00:15:55] least give me my $300 3300 plus dollars
[00:15:58] back that's all that's what I want I'm
[00:16:00] not saying give me anything extra I'm
[00:16:02] saying pull it from that cut person
[00:16:04] that's been lying and give it to me
[00:16:06] that's
[00:16:07] all yes I know they do have some hot
[00:16:09] hands let's see if they got what they

[00:38:15] depending on which side you jump on and
[00:38:17] um as soon as you jump on one you get to
[00:38:18] start playing in the vault here having
[00:38:19] some fun but um what happens will is uh
[00:38:23] once we close out one of the breaks
[00:38:24] whoever is the one that's done first
[00:38:26] will be able to get off on the adventure
[00:38:28] quicker but who knows maybe the other
[00:38:29] team has better luck when it comes to
[00:38:32] beating some of the characters along the
[00:38:33] way that they can get to the end quicker
[00:38:35] to get the prize you know the largest
[00:38:36] prize for you I it's only within the
[00:38:38] game prize but the largest prize I don't
[00:38:40] know it's up to you guys here let's see

[00:39:20] might I actually so all right so I know
[00:39:23] this is sounds sounds corny to some
[00:39:25] people but for me I've always wanted to
[00:39:27] try to do this um so if I'm lucky enough
[00:39:30] where we can get this where it does
[00:39:31] something where I have a lot of people
[00:39:32] that are able to give tips and we are
[00:39:34] able to get a lot of presents one year I
[00:39:38] would like to do something like that

[01:50:25] want it and that means we have only
[01:50:27] three spots left on the break today that
[01:50:28] is the Forgotten Realms murderers dusk
[01:50:30] moror lost CNS ravika double feature and
[01:50:33] the magic foundations one there's three
[01:50:36] spots left and when we do that we're
[01:50:38] going to wander through our Wasteland
[01:50:40] here and uh see what happens with our
[01:50:42] character I don't know it's your old
[01:50:45] RuneScape name oh okay okay I like it
[01:50:47] makes sense it's an old name from
[01:50:49] something I like
[01:50:51] it for
[01:51:40] all
[01:51:41] right let's do this here we'll pin this
[01:51:44] for a minute there I'm going to do
[01:51:46] something it's the old rcap I like it
[01:51:48] let's try
[01:51:49] this run that and then I'm going to do
[01:51:53] we'll run these again now these the
[01:51:54] reason why these are here it says health
[01:51:56] and buff is because it's related to the
[01:51:59] adventure game if you want to play it so
[01:52:00] you get health and you get buff or one
[01:52:02] of those whenever you play it so for
[01:52:03] instance if people have been getting
[01:52:05] like an agility booster or strength
[01:52:07] booster if you had the character and
[01:52:08] you're jumping in playing the game here
[01:52:10] you'd be able to add those to your
[01:52:12] character so that's kind of a cool thing
[01:52:14] for that
[01:52:52] all right all righty zimy with an
[01:52:53] Angelic field Marshall let me get that
[01:52:56] one out for you my
[01:53:00] friend there you go Angelic field
[01:53:02] Marshall that's a nice little pickup for
[01:53:04] you so like zimmy you would have gotten
[01:53:06] a plus 20 health for your character if
[01:53:07] you were to play there you go so that's
[01:53:10] kind of what we're doing there we'll run
[01:53:11] those some more and maybe if somebody
[01:53:13] here does want to try it and they want

[02:00:15] things I got to do regards the boat so I
[02:00:17] was hoping we could get this break wrong
[02:00:20] done oh
[02:00:24] Kudo General Kudo that's a good

[02:00:49] adventure General's over here here we
[02:00:58] go we got to be over
[02:01:02] here if not then that means you're going

[02:01:08] that you might get another
[02:01:10] chance to see if you can get one of the
[02:01:12] other ones and that means whenever you
[02:01:13] get another chance almost every single
[02:01:15] time somebody comes out with the
[02:01:17] hit I thought I had him in here why is
[02:01:19] General in not in here that is throwing
[02:01:21] me off a lot lot well you're going to
[02:01:23] get another chance and so far zimy every
[02:01:26] time I've done that I come with a
[02:01:29] hit um no we cannot do one from that one
[02:01:32] because they're two different
[02:01:34] ones um if you would like to request a
[02:01:36] refund on this I can do that um and then
[02:01:40] go to the other one if you'd like I can
[02:01:43] do that for you if you'd like uh

[02:21:25] number to be like an a paid number so
[02:21:26] that every time they call they have to
[02:21:31] pay because it's same number and they
[02:21:34] never leave a message and I have it
[02:21:35] specifically saying I'm not going to
[02:21:36] answer you if you don't leave a message
[02:21:38] but they still do it they still do it I
[02:21:42] think they're GNA get away with it all
[02:21:43] right here's our break we're going to
[02:21:44] run the break one here for you that want
[02:21:45] to try
[02:21:46] it yeah I know exactly with all the spam

[02:21:50] can change it to a number that I get
[02:21:51] paid for you know like an 800 900 number
[02:21:53] like background or something like that
[02:21:55] so that's our break there for you guys
[02:21:57] that want it let me know if you like
[02:21:59] what is in there and uh we'll run this
[02:22:03] one here as that that's number three
[02:22:05] spot then we have five and six for the
[02:22:07] spots that are available so let's see if

[02:22:25] two more and if there's two more people
[02:22:27] that jump in then I'll do um um I myself
[02:22:28] might take over one of the spots to the

[03:07:39] five over I don't know I don't know what
[03:07:42] you're talking about five or I'm not

[03:07:45] I'm just doing
[03:07:46] stuff you can only have plus five yes
[03:07:49] only plus five on each
[03:07:52] um um buff at the most yes if that's
[03:07:56] what you're asking each buff only has
[03:07:59] plus five at the
[03:08:01] most I think that's what you guys were
[03:08:14] asking yes at the most do that and here
[03:08:18] we go put those here that ended right at
[03:08:21] the end which is
[03:08:27] nice this is just like I said the
[03:08:29] commons and uncommons we're just handing
[03:08:31] out
[03:08:40] now gives you guys a minute to decide
[03:08:42] what you want to do on your adventure

[03:08:49] too gives you a minute to make some
[03:08:51] trades if you want to make any trades
[03:08:52] with anything you got or if you want to
[03:08:54] make any
[03:08:56] um what you want to do with your
[03:08:57] characters in The Adventure all right
[03:08:59] here we go we're going to put all this
[03:09:01] together here get this stuff in a this

[03:09:18] so get all that together like I said
[03:09:19] give you guys a minute or so to make
[03:09:21] some decisions on what you want to do
[03:09:23] with your characters for the adventure
[03:09:25] the biggest hit probably the um I say
[03:09:28] between the Crypt and the um I'll show
[03:09:30] you in one second the Crypt
[03:09:33] and the dungeon potentially or the tiny
[03:09:36] bones I haven't decided yet ftin is a
[03:09:39] nice one but I don't think it's a big
[03:09:40] one but storm carve Coast could
[03:09:41] potentially be the biggest hit because I
[03:09:43] don't know how much that is I haven't
[03:09:44] looked at that recently storm car of
[03:09:46] coast is generally hit too I mean it was
[03:09:48] a good spread of hits if that makes any
[03:09:50] sense so it's hard for me to say which
[03:09:52] one was the high one since they were all
[03:09:54] like good hits does that makes any
[03:10:03] sense the hell's going on
[03:10:11] here plus one for each buff with a cap
[03:10:14] of plus five correct
[03:10:19] you are correct
[03:10:21] there thank you Nico for helping with
[03:10:45] that all right

[03:11:06] dungeon we're going to put these two in
[03:11:07] there to loader for you
[03:11:12] Luke like I said it's like a good split
[03:11:14] of things it's hard for me to say
[03:11:18] there wasn't any giant hit but there
[03:11:20] wasn't any bad hit if that makes any
[03:11:21] sense it none of them were like it
[03:11:23] wasn't all horrible like all good hits
[03:11:26] it's one of those like just good good
[03:11:28] break yeah it's a good split yeah yeah

[03:15:03] door hole in the wall locked
[03:15:07] room or storage vendor for the locations
[03:15:11] Now you kind of see what they
[03:15:12] differently act like maybe might get
[03:15:13] different things more better different
[03:15:14] odd things at each one who knows but
[03:15:17] those are your options and you get eight
[03:15:19] codes to get in them whenever you choose
[03:15:22] one and then
[03:15:27] Luke well luck gives you yeah luck gives
[03:15:30] you an extra on your roles so like say
[03:15:33] if it's a 50/50 when you do a luck you
[03:15:35] have luck you might get um plus 11
[03:15:37] instead of you you might be up to 10 you
[03:15:41] know you I mean like you have you have
[03:15:42] to get they have to it has to be nine
[03:15:44] instead of you know you know have to be
[03:15:46] 11 or under instead of 10 or under type
[03:15:51] thing gives you better so Luke's going
[03:15:53] to go luck all right Luke says

[03:20:15] as one of you steps further out of the
[03:20:16] floor
[03:20:18] Flor pops up some
[03:20:21] ghouls you need to decide what you're

[03:21:10] ah that didn't work right
[03:21:24] there uh oh that didn't
[03:21:27] work where did that
[03:21:29] go oh that's
[03:21:34] why there we
[03:21:36] go right in the middle boom you get that
[03:21:39] there you got it de side what are you
[03:21:40] going to do now
[03:21:42] H what are you going to do there's a
[03:21:46] room for ghouls thought you were going
[03:21:48] to get a chest and you wandered in and
[03:21:50] no that is not what you were hoping to
[03:21:52] see the break is finished by the way
[03:21:55] everybody so we're going to finish that
[03:21:57] what I'm going to do though while I'm
[03:21:57] running the break is if you guys want to
[03:21:59] jump in on anything to get some weapons
[03:22:01] some ammo or anything or anybody else
[03:22:02] wants to do any of the braks the uh the
[03:22:04] virtual pull boxes we'll run these while
[03:22:06] we're hanging
[03:22:08] out all right you're going to run
[03:22:10] towards the big guy with the
[03:22:12] sword all right Luke that has you have a
[03:22:15] um
[03:22:19] Luke is at 80 Health you have plus five
[03:22:24] on the sword so let's see what happens
[03:22:26] here we're going to
[03:22:29] go and oh no you miss he's the big guy
[03:22:33] oh where where the big guy you need 18
[03:22:37] or
[03:22:38] more that did not do anything the medium
[03:22:41] ones that are two medium ones that are
[03:22:42] there you're going to need um
[03:22:49] what is it two medium ones I think are
[03:22:51] 16 and the small ones are 15 that's what
[03:22:53] it is small ones are 15 16 if I remember
[03:22:54] right 18 though for this big guy because
[03:22:56] he's a big guy he's not a small guy he
[03:22:58] is a big guy all right so you got a
[03:23:01] couple small
[03:23:02] ones how many got we here one two three
[03:23:07] four five six yes so there's one two
[03:23:10] three small ones two medium ones and the
[03:23:14] big one that's what it is so there's 15
[03:23:17] an
[03:23:19] 18 and a uh 16 two 16s that's what you
[03:23:24] get to go with 91 goes towards the small
[03:23:25] one but you missed though you missed on
[03:23:27] the big one with that so let's put them
[03:23:31] out there and I'm going to make the
[03:23:32] health is for the big one though the
[03:23:34] health is
[03:23:40] 75 the small ones the medium ones are
[03:23:45] 40 going put that
[03:23:52] there then the small ones are
[03:23:57] 25 and those are
[03:24:04] 15 you have three of those so five total
[03:24:08] six total is what you're going up
[03:24:15] against all right

[04:03:50] sword lifts that mighty sword up and
[04:03:53] stabs it right through the ground
[04:03:56] and that last one
[04:03:59] now as that
[04:04:01] happens now that these guys don't carry
[04:04:04] much for POG you don't see you for for
[04:04:06] anything but in the backround you see a
[04:04:08] chest but you do see on the big guy
[04:04:12] carries all those that's your Wasteland
[04:04:14] currency you get from the big guy one
[04:04:16] two
[04:04:17] three oh that stuck together four five
[04:04:21] six seven
[04:04:24] eight pogs from the big guy you already
[04:04:27] had six from that little guy that ran
[04:04:29] away all right then you guys Wander over
[04:04:34] and you see that safe in the background
[04:04:36] ah not that safe the chest over there in
[04:04:37] the corner see they don't really have
[04:04:39] much but you have the chest in the
[04:04:40] corner
[04:04:48] yeah yeah I can do that I can do that
[04:04:49] for you yeah not a problem and um so now
[04:04:53] you also you go over and you look in the
[04:04:55] chest there and in the chest there is
[04:05:00] these things you see one two three four
[04:05:07] of these and look at that those
[04:05:09] are
[04:05:12] your you all get 10 pogs with those
[04:05:15] that's what that
[04:05:20] means each one of those means you get 10
[04:05:23] Hogs there so there you go you each got
[04:05:27] 10 and then also so we're going to add
[04:05:30] that in there all of you are definitely
[04:05:32] going to get 10 pogs so we're going to
[04:05:33] add that in so you all go up one goes up

[04:05:41] pogs those are your first 10
[04:05:44] same thing with dip you get 10
[04:05:49] pogs there you go and then you go up to
[04:05:53] 20 Luke with your pogs now you can
[04:05:56] decide how to break the rest up after
[04:05:58] but you all get one of those all righty
[04:06:00] and then you have in there you find a
[04:06:06] sword you find a plasma

[04:06:15] pistol you also find some AR ammo that's
[04:06:19] 30 rounds you find 10 rounds of plasma
[04:06:24] ammo and then you also find something

[04:06:33] here okay
[04:06:48] see if this is going to work
[04:06:59] right the pistol all right so the pistol
[04:07:02] gives you plus two for your shooting um

[04:09:32] a a a charity event trying to so we're
[04:09:35] going to call it tips or charity so you
[04:09:36] can um we were very muchik appreciate
[04:09:39] that hey I
[04:09:41] top Commander what are the best
[04:09:43] strongest commanders of precons oh you
[04:09:45] could buy probably if you could buy any
[04:09:46] good ones to start with would be um the
[04:09:48] commander Masters ones if you can buy
[04:09:50] them if you're looking for newer ones
[04:09:52] the duskmourn ones are good um there's a
[04:09:54] couple of good ones with the duskmourn
[04:09:56] um then there's also Bloom that have a
[04:09:58] couple nice one storm and dusn yeah
[04:10:00] storm with Dorn is a nice set if you're
[04:10:02] looking for that it's Skipper if I'm
[04:10:04] saying your name right
[04:10:08] sorry winter correct yes thank you
[04:10:11] Winter's a good one
[04:10:14] all right here we go this is what you
[04:10:15] guys have now let's see if I can get
[04:10:17] this in here without breaking
[04:10:23] anything I'm going to do this
[04:10:25] here there going do this going try this
[04:10:29] you also have the new weapon this is a
[04:10:32] Gatling
[04:10:34] rifle you get to
[04:10:36] shoot five shots at once and it has its
[04:10:40] own Special ammo and it gets you
[04:10:43] a plus
[04:10:46] six but it's because it
[04:10:49] shoots six shots at once so you can Miss
[04:10:52] six times if that makes
[04:10:56] sense now the Gatling gun comes with 60
[04:11:00] rounds of ammo so you get 10 shots so
[04:11:04] the first so whoever wants to get it you
[04:11:05] guys can decide whoever wants that my
[04:11:09] friends there you go so you have a
[04:11:11] Gatling gun it's going to be it's uh
[04:11:14] between all of you guys to decide what
[04:11:16] you want to do with that because you
[04:11:17] have a Gatling gun you've got a sword
[04:11:19] there you have a plasma rifle you have a
[04:11:21] pistol you have an assault rifle ammo
[04:11:24] you have plasma
[04:11:26] ammo and I think that was it that was in
[04:11:29] there for
[04:11:32] everything so not so decide what you
[04:11:35] want who are so 91 let me see 91 let me
[04:11:39] see what you have my
[04:11:40] friend you already have you have a
[04:11:42] plasma rifle so you know you don't you
[04:11:45] have a sword a plasma rifle might be
[04:11:47] nice for you that would probably a good
[04:11:50] one because you already have that or
[04:11:53] maybe some AR ammo since you already
[04:11:54] have the AR
[04:11:57] too um but then dip you have a sword so
[04:11:59] one of the weapons would be nice so
[04:12:01] maybe the the um the pistol you said you
[04:12:03] wanted but maybe would or the plasma
[04:12:05] rifle would be
[04:12:08] nice uh then Luke if you really want
[04:12:10] that you can go with that Luke and we

[04:12:26] Gatling
[04:12:27] Luke wants to do the

[00:29:17] gotten a job where he was going to be
[00:29:18] able to be around more frequently which
[00:29:20] made our the whole family excited um so
[00:29:24] with that being said I always try to be

[00:30:05] Matthew
[00:30:06] OB I don't know we're gonna go with that
[00:30:08] there this is what we're going to do now
[00:30:10] actually I like this idea I was thinking
[00:30:12] we should do this Mike said this was a
[00:30:14] good idea too all right this is what
[00:30:16] we're going to do we're going to put up
[00:30:18] I I'm keeping this one because I like
[00:30:19] rogu I like rogu but we're going to put

[00:30:25] uh affordable alter is done I'm keeping
[00:30:28] grou and I'm looking for another one
[00:30:30] there all right I need to I'm going to
[00:30:33] see if he has any others when he comes
[00:30:34] and does them again he's going to do a
[00:30:35] GU another Star Wars day so I'm gonna go
[00:30:37] and look for those ones you need stance
[00:30:40] right
[00:30:44] now yes Dwayne I understand that yeah I
[00:30:48] was um my dad did there was nothing
[00:30:50] wrong with what he did he did everything
[00:30:51] perfectly fine it was just he would be
[00:30:53] gone for like a month or two at a time
[00:30:55] sometimes two weeks and he'd back for a
[00:30:57] week so we can see him much and it's not
[00:30:59] that was he was a great person I loved
[00:31:00] him he was I was always around and did
[00:31:02] everything with us when he was there but
[00:31:04] it was when he was there you know what I
[00:31:05] mean it's just not nothing wrong with
[00:31:07] that I'm not trying to be mean to anyone
[00:31:09] you know life happens um he did
[00:31:11] everything to make our life very easy
[00:31:14] and that's what I'm never gonna I'm
[00:31:16] never going to fault him for that
[00:31:17] because if I you I can't ever fault
[00:31:19] somebody for that you know they did what
[00:31:21] they could to make their family's life
[00:31:23] the best they could and if somebody is
[00:31:25] going to fault a person for that I don't
[00:31:27] know if I can handle that that's one of
[00:31:28] those weird things that would be like
[00:31:30] really you know they did the best with
[00:31:32] what they had my dad didn't get through
[00:31:35] um he actually left high school after
[00:31:37] freshman year of high school so he
[00:31:39] didn't get through uh his freshman year
[00:31:40] of high school with a with that that's
[00:31:42] how long ago it was you were able to do
[00:31:43] that type of thing back
[00:31:45] then here you
[00:31:51] go oh I wasn't saying you were doubting
[00:31:53] that I wasn't saying you were doubting
[00:31:56] anything oh I wasn't saying you were
[00:31:58] doubting anything not at all Dwayne I
[00:32:01] just more just going into a little
[00:32:03] something yeah sometimes I like to a
[00:32:05] little
[00:32:08] bit thank you yes thank you for your
[00:32:10] service
[00:32:12] Dwayne we put that up for a little a
[00:32:14] wasteland
[00:32:16] adventure and what we'll do next is um
[00:32:20] you know what maybe we'll do the POG man
[00:32:22] the POG flip
[00:32:23] instead let's put the POG flip out
[00:32:26] instead now I have put in here this is
[00:32:29] where all the other pogs that have been
[00:32:30] taken out are we're going to do that for
[00:32:32] a little bit here let's put the POG clip
[00:32:34] out for a
[00:32:37] second we're going to pin that right now
[00:32:40] I'm G I'm going to lie those out
[00:32:43] here all right that way if somebody
[00:32:45] wants to jump in on it now you can see
[00:32:47] everything that's available in there if
[00:32:48] you want you can jump in on it I'll get
[00:32:51] another giveway up there with our one
[00:32:53] that we had I told you I was going to
[00:32:54] run that for our buddy of fourble Alters
[00:32:57] card there I like it I'm a big fan of
[00:32:59] his the stuff there I looking for the
[00:33:02] forward to the uh Star Wars that he said
[00:33:05] he was going to be doing soon I know I'm
[00:33:07] quirky like that there we go all right
[00:33:10] that's out our stuff right there for our
[00:33:12] um for our POG flip if you want to jump
[00:33:15] on
[00:33:16] that and I'm going to put these away and
[00:33:19] I'm going to figure out if there's
[00:33:20] something else for us to do today and I
[00:33:23] should be getting some uh fallout in
[00:33:25] either tomorrow it's only one box sly I
[00:33:27] didn't want to spend I wanted to see how
[00:33:29] it went because if it doesn't sell I'll
[00:33:32] keep it myself but if it does sell um
[00:33:34] I'll see if I'll get another another
[00:33:39] one but here we go let's do
[00:33:46] um
[00:33:48] no maybe I do open that I hit the
[00:33:52] foone I think I'm G to open this we're
[00:33:55] going to put a commander Masters out
[00:34:01] oh they definitely short printed them
[00:34:03] they definitely short printed them see I
[00:34:05] the thing I ordered Dwayne I ordered um
[00:34:09] four cases which is what six time four
[00:34:13] is what
[00:34:15] 24 24 boxes I got
[00:34:19] two that's what it was given to me by
[00:34:21] the
[00:34:24] distributor but that's what they got
[00:34:26] there's nothing they could do about it
[00:34:28] they're like yeah we can't give anybody
[00:34:29] much because this is all we get so I'm
[00:34:32] like okay like it's not like they're
[00:34:35] they're transparent and all but it just
[00:34:36] they can't you can't do anything with
[00:34:38] what they didn't they don't give
[00:34:40] you so you know yeah that's what
[00:34:43] happened going to put that one right
[00:34:46] there we're going to start out with one
[00:34:47] of those as a uh that'll be two STR on
[00:34:51] your you know what we're going to call
[00:34:52] that three strength because it's a big
[00:34:54] big hitting Cod
[00:34:56] there
[00:34:58] I'm going to put that one
[00:34:59] in and we can do our our adventure in
[00:35:02] the Wasteland for those that want to
[00:35:03] jump in and hang out with
[00:35:11] it yeah sounds like there are going to
[00:35:13] be plenty of Thunder Junction
[00:35:15] yep um it depends I'm not sure I have I
[00:35:19] don't do stuff like that frequently
[00:35:21] Jupiter to know um it depends on the
[00:35:23] size and the weight is really what it is
[00:35:27] uh as long as it can fit in an envelope
[00:35:29] and it can go through that hole when you
[00:35:31] get to the uh post office from my
[00:35:33] understanding as long as it's under the
[00:35:34] weight and it's in an envelope and it
[00:35:36] fits through the hole you're
[00:35:43] good yeah exactly it's a set standard
[00:35:46] exactly so all right I'm G put this back
[00:35:48] since no one wanted the uh Commander
[00:35:50] Masters I got a few of them just in case
[00:35:53] anybody wants them I'm going to um you
[00:35:56] know what what we're going to do on on
[00:35:57] our day on our
[00:36:00] um since we can't do many of these all
[00:36:02] the time now since we only have a
[00:36:04] handful of them what we're going to end
[00:36:05] up doing is we're going to end up doing
[00:36:07] for the whatnot con with the kids here
[00:36:11] with the our game our games instead of
[00:36:15] the um some of the tokens are going to
[00:36:17] go out as the as the free things to go
[00:36:19] to the games or we're going to throw
[00:36:20] them up as
[00:36:23] um actually auctions cuz my son goes can
[00:36:26] we auction it off like you know what
[00:36:27] fine why not I'll try auction a couple
[00:36:29] of your tokens off and we'll see what
[00:36:32] happens I'll throw them in with like a
[00:36:33] pack of cards or something like that and
[00:36:34] say Here's this token with a pack of
[00:36:36] cards and we'll see what happens he's
[00:36:39] all right that sounds good so I figure
[00:36:42] we'll do that on uh on what not con to
[00:36:44] because he wants to see if uh people
[00:36:46] wants their tokens because we don't have

[00:55:38] box of ion myself to open for the set
[00:55:41] boosters because I don't have much ion
[00:55:44] to add into like a pull box type thing
[00:55:47] so I'm actually out of a lot of
[00:55:50] it there we go we're going to
[00:55:53] do we're g to do this actually
[00:55:57] we're going to do this let's start with
[00:56:00] three strengthen our Wasteland Adventure
[00:56:02] why
[00:56:06] not three strength in our Wasteland
[00:56:10] Adventure here for you that may want to
[00:56:13] try the Wasteland Adventure we'll do the
[00:56:15] Wasteland animated one we like the

[00:56:21] you want
[00:56:24] it and we'll put our
[00:56:26] battle in the back over
[00:56:28] here somebody told me I needed a metal
[00:56:31] Slammer so if uh if you guys can find me
[00:56:34] one let me know where one is a good one
[00:56:38] I can maybe maybe I'll go and get one
[00:56:40] big Kona how you doing buddy thanks for
[00:56:42] coming in and hanging out do appreciate
[00:56:44] it we got our animated games going you
[00:56:47] know being the detective or maybe you're
[00:56:50] going to be that mutant or one of those
[00:56:51] things as you wander
[00:56:55] through
[00:56:57] Wednesday is always one of the um slower
[00:57:00] days when it comes to what we're doing
[00:57:01] with our games here so that's why I was
[00:57:03] thinking of maybe trying something
[00:57:04] different on Wednesdays in the
[00:57:08] morning got pogs I do big goona I do
[00:57:14] have pogs
[00:57:16] ready so some of the games that we do
[00:57:19] are had five pogs in them
[00:57:22] because look at that I came with a
[00:57:25] plastic one that's why I said I need a
[00:57:27] metal one so what happened was um I
[00:57:30] bought these um packs of
[00:57:33] cards and they were just like these
[00:57:35] cheap packs of cards to get do as like
[00:57:37] with giveaway things and in one of the
[00:57:39] packs of cards there happened to be a
[00:57:42] Pog my wife got overly excited about
[00:57:45] those PO said pogs it was like you need
[00:57:48] to get more those will be fun to put in
[00:57:50] with games like all right we can try
[00:57:52] that
[00:57:55] so we
[00:57:57] get some pgs I went
[00:58:00] online I
[00:58:02] found all these containers here I know
[00:58:04] they're not exactly pogs but they're
[00:58:07] completely sealed two of them were open
[00:58:09] so I use I'm used the two open ones but
[00:58:11] um I'm down I have eight of them sealed
[00:58:14] right there from back in the day for all
[00:58:18] of you uh POG
[00:58:24] lovers Oh serious serly that's pretty
[00:58:26] funny that's pretty funny see I had a
[00:58:29] bunch of stuff and long story short my
[00:58:31] father passed away over close to 20
[00:58:33] years ago and when that happened my we
[00:58:35] just I was uh not around I was actually
[00:58:38] away at College when I had I came home
[00:58:40] helped and stuff like that but then um
[00:58:42] our house was getting cleaned out
[00:58:44] because it got like we didn't couldn't
[00:58:45] afford it and um they my mom threw a
[00:58:48] bunch of stuff like cards pogs Ninja
[00:58:51] Turtles and I was pissed I didn't
[00:58:52] realize it because like they were I
[00:58:54] didn't know they were cleaning that day
[00:58:56] like if they had known I would have gone
[00:58:57] down and helped and taken some of my
[00:58:58] stuff but hey you know life happens
[00:59:00] right so I uh we found some old ones
[00:59:03] here and are having some fun with
[00:59:07] them oh thank you I'll take a look let
[00:59:09] me see if I can find
[00:59:16] it let me see if I can find that where
[00:59:18] are we going
[00:59:19] here oh no that's not what I was
[00:59:21] supposed to
[00:59:23] do no
[00:59:28] no stop

[00:59:58] some metal pogs with some metal Slammers
[01:00:01] here I mean uh oh we going back to the
[01:00:06] 90s well that's part I just like hanging
[01:00:08] out and having fun and like the whole
[01:00:10] reason I actually even started doing
[01:00:11] this was because my kids found my cards
[01:00:13] from 1995 to uh 2000 and they were like
[01:00:19] so if it's all old stuff might as well
[01:00:20] have more fun with the old stuff right
[01:00:23] I'm definitely going to look at that now
[01:00:24] I going be what am I what are you do
[01:00:26] them during your break during your uh
[01:00:27] during work right now James oh I'm

[01:10:06] know somebody I know somebody that did
[01:10:08] that when they took their kid on a plane
[01:10:10] and I was like oh my God that's
[01:10:12] ingeniously
[01:10:15] wrong like that's so good but it's so
[01:10:19] wrong I know it's like it's one of those
[01:10:22] scenarios where it's like oh wow that's
[01:10:24] like I I I feel bad but it's actually
[01:10:26] kind of
[01:10:28] funny smart idea you know I don't know
[01:10:31] if I would do it but it's definitely a
[01:10:34] smart idea there we go we're going to
[01:10:36] put that up here and we're going to do
[01:10:38] this my
[01:10:39] friends going to put up a little bit of
[01:10:41] a uh another adventure game here for
[01:10:45] those that want to try it we're going to
[01:10:47] put that on there for
[01:10:51] this and this is going to be the
[01:10:53] cheapest I have Forgotten Realms for a
[01:10:55] little bit the last box there cuz the
[01:10:56] next ones I get in for some reason they
[01:10:58] decided to up the prices at the
[01:11:00] Distributors like dude you got them in
[01:11:02] stock there you don't need to up the
[01:11:04] prices that's what I hate about some of
[01:11:06] these things I know it's the make money
[01:11:07] they're making they're here to make
[01:11:09] money but at the same time You' probably
[01:11:12] get boost up more efficiently if you
[01:11:15] didn't do that type of
[01:11:17] thing
[01:11:21] nice so I'm getting a new uh getting
[01:11:24] some new stuff from work
[01:11:25] because my work computer I never
[01:11:28] actually when I started working they
[01:11:29] never actually sent me a monitor or
[01:11:31] keyboard um the docking station that
[01:11:33] they sent me is breaking and that's the
[01:11:35] mainly the reason why I came about um so
[01:11:38] I'm able to get a monitor a keyboard and
[01:11:40] a mouse now so I'm going to have
[01:11:41] Bluetooth ones new ones and then I'm
[01:11:43] going to have a uh a docking station a

[01:23:43] bought a box of I bought a bunch of box
[01:23:44] of them dirt cheap and the paper that I
[01:23:47] got I guess was some one of the cases um
[01:23:48] one of the packages was a different size
[01:23:50] and I had to recalibrate the printer but
[01:23:52] once I did that everything was fine

[01:29:42] here leap thanks for coming in do
[01:29:45] appreciate it oh thank you you can hang
[01:29:47] out for a little bit oh you're getting a
[01:29:50] feeling that's a feeling that's not as
[01:29:51] bad I have a broken tooth on my right
[01:29:53] side
[01:29:54] so I can
[01:29:59] uh I can't eat on my right side right
[01:30:01] now leap here
[01:30:04] guy thanks for coming in and hanging
[01:30:08] out dude working from home is really
[01:30:10] good cuz in uh hey no problem leap year
[01:30:14] you get to hang out with us do this type
[01:30:16] of thing and also um you know like when
[01:30:20] I'm done for stuff from work i l i I'm
[01:30:23] gonna
[01:30:25] long story short I'm a highly
[01:30:27] intelligent
[01:30:29] person um some of the things figured out
[01:30:32] when I was getting diagnosed with
[01:30:33] seizures in the hospital so I F finish a
[01:30:36] lot of my work stuff quickly or I'm
[01:30:37] there before other people so and I even
[01:30:39] think sometimes when I'm working I go
[01:30:41] too quick for people because I've had
[01:30:42] people be like uh you need to slow down
[01:30:44] and when I'm like showing stuff I'm like
[01:30:46] ding ding ding ding ding ding ding done
[01:30:47] and they're like all right well that was
[01:30:48] quick and then they do it and it's like
[01:30:50] 45 minutes to an hour and it took me
[01:30:51] like 10 minutes so I think my problem is
[01:30:53] I just go so quick doing things that I
[01:30:56] get done and I'm like all right what do
[01:30:58] we do
[01:30:59] now so nice thing about working from
[01:31:01] home is I can go walk around like I
[01:31:03] literally go walk around I've had
[01:31:05] actually a director told me that since I
[01:31:06] have a pool here I should do um
[01:31:09] aquatic what was it
[01:31:14] aquatic aquatic ah aquatic therapy
[01:31:18] during the day I should do Aqua therapy
[01:31:20] during the day that's what it
[01:31:22] was Aqua therapy during the day and go

[01:31:31] aqua therapy Mike you're a director
[01:31:33] that's like three down from uh the the
[01:31:36] two down from the um president that's an
[01:31:39] interesting thing to tell me but all
[01:31:40] right I'll do some aqua
[01:31:42] therapy you have three regions to stay
[01:31:45] on top of you're good I do the same but
[01:31:47] it's in the hot tub with a
[01:31:48] beer yeah dude exact yeah see if I had a
[01:31:51] hot tub I'd probably be doing that too
[01:31:53] I'd be in there but we're we're in
[01:31:54] Florida down here so it's a little bit
[01:31:55] warm for a hot tub on a regular

[01:32:11] want
[01:32:13] it oh nice you had to turn the heat off

[01:32:18] good Aqua therapy is pretty good from my
[01:32:21] understanding you have um uh I mean for
[01:32:24] me I just get to float around in the
[01:32:26] pool which is fun that's my Aqua therapy
[01:32:28] but hey it happens right you know I'm
[01:32:31] I'll take Aqua therapy like
[01:32:34] that that I get i s I go float in the

[01:34:06] you want to call
[01:34:08] it just can't take
[01:34:11] it happy that we have our central air
[01:34:14] that it has everything in there you
[01:34:16] shoot what I am uh shoot what am I
[01:34:19] picking that next so you pick you pick
[01:34:22] out of each one of these boxes you pick
[01:34:23] Pi one of these so there three to pick
[01:34:25] you pick one red one green and one blue
[01:34:28] 78 cards in red 78 cards in green and 12
[01:34:31] and blue and this gives you your plus or
[01:34:33] minus for your strength in your
[01:34:34] Wasteland Adventure okay that way you
[01:34:37] can choose um that way when you get up
[01:34:39] to the boss you could potentially have
[01:34:40] enough strength to beat multiple
[01:34:43] bosses red is 20 green is
[01:34:46] 13 and blue is four perfect I like it
[01:34:50] one two three four five six seven eight
[01:34:53] 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 and
[01:35:00] 20
[01:35:01] 20 all right there we
[01:35:04] go
[01:35:06] 20 green is
[01:35:09] 13 one two three four five six seven
[01:35:13] eight nine 10 11 12
[01:35:17] 13 and then um for your boss it is one
[01:35:20] out of 10 cards so you can decide what
[01:35:22] you want to do on that too and then here
[01:35:24] it is number four you said we Shuffle
[01:35:26] these ones up generally because there's
[01:35:28] only 12 of them here all right number
[01:35:30] four one two three and four right there
[01:35:35] all right so with those done that way
[01:35:39] what we do you go wandering through this
[01:35:41] Wasteland there front t for the boss all
[01:35:43] right you go wandering through this
[01:35:45] Wasteland I'm going to unpin the product
[01:35:47] we can see
[01:35:48] better and you're a technician you're
[01:35:52] looking for some treasure as you want
[01:35:53] wand through and
[01:35:55] wonderful you find some treasure in the
[01:35:57] Wasteland you're digging through you
[01:35:58] find some treasure you H hi that in your
[01:36:01] pockets going great now up to five
[01:36:03] strength as you wander through the waist
[01:36:04] angle maybe I can find a
[01:36:06] friend to go after to help me with my
[01:36:09] treasure maybe trade for some
[01:36:11] information build something I don't know
[01:36:13] let's find out and oh we have a soldier
[01:36:18] that comes out and that is not helpful
[01:36:19] for you as a technician the soldier
[01:36:23] scares you you Dro that treasure that
[01:36:27] you had where is my
[01:36:31] uh you Dro that treasure that you
[01:36:35] had run away but luckily the treasure
[01:36:39] the soldier was only after that treasure
[01:36:40] so you still have your for strength as
[01:36:43] you wander through the Wasteland here
[01:36:45] which is good that's good let's see what
[01:36:47] we have though maybe we can find a boss
[01:36:49] a friend that's going to help you along
[01:36:51] the way you're looking for a Thro there
[01:36:52] as a technique
[01:36:54] but oh no that fungus dinosaur Oh wrong
[01:36:58] one that fungus dinosaur comes crashing
[01:37:01] through the Wasteland towards you
[01:37:03] knocking you down to three strength that
[01:37:05] is not good but you know what that means
[01:37:08] there are still two out of the 10 bosses
[01:37:12] you can beat here and you said you
[01:37:13] wanted to go with the front one so here

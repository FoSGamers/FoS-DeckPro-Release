[00:03:14] try to run it here
[00:03:16] again so you guys can see it. We're
[00:03:18] trying to automate uh I'm trying to
[00:03:19] automate some of this, make it a little
[00:03:21] easier. So, anyways, let's make that
[00:03:24] go. Ah, start one of these

[00:05:14] off
[00:05:15] strong with a little encounter here. All

[00:05:20] a little bit
[00:05:22] different with our encountering. Let's

[00:09:07] is. Found it. But I hold my uh your guys
[00:09:12] cards in after you pick them up and

[00:09:19] righty. Here we
[00:09:21] go. All right.
[00:09:43] Big. Let's see what we get here for you.
[00:09:45] You go wandering
[00:09:47] around now. you had been
[00:09:50] here where you looked at the uh you got
[00:09:53] out of there the your pre-war building
[00:09:57] here you were at recently checked out
[00:09:59] your
[00:10:02] map. All right. And you're wandering
[00:10:08] around and what you end up seeing here
[00:10:10] is
[00:10:22] Where is
[00:10:26] it? There we go. You see this camp while
[00:10:29] you're wandering out and about there?
[00:10:31] All right. Now, do you want to stop in
[00:10:33] or do you want to go around? Hey, Beer
[00:10:35] Bunny. How's it going, my
[00:10:39] friend? Hopefully, you're having a good
[00:10:40] one.
[00:10:42] We're just getting things up and running
[00:10:45] today and uh we'll see how it
[00:10:58] [Music]
[00:11:07] goes. I don't know if it's going to
[00:11:09] work. Uh, I was trying to make it I was
[00:11:12] trying to do a different type of a get
[00:11:13] an image of a map here, but it's not
[00:11:15] working the way I
[00:11:17] want.
[00:11:20] Nice. All right, you head on into the
[00:11:22] refugee camp
[00:11:25] there. You see a few people hanging
[00:11:28] around, but nothing
[00:11:31] spectacular. Bumping into different
[00:11:34] ones. You do end up uh though seeing
[00:11:39] somebody come up to you from that
[00:11:43] wasteland. They're
[00:11:47] uh a bit stronger looking than you, but
[00:11:50] maybe not the same weapons.
[00:11:55] They ask if you would like to uh have a
[00:11:57] friendly
[00:11:59] brawl and uh wager anything on
[00:12:03] it for this friendly brawl. Whoever wins
[00:12:07] will take the
[00:12:09] wager. You're going to beat them. All
[00:12:11] right. Now, remember the thing is with
[00:12:13] the friendly brawl, it's only melee
[00:12:15] weapons and it is a friendly brawl.
[00:12:18] We're not trying to destroy someone.
[00:12:20] Okay.
[00:12:22] So, you going to try
[00:12:25] it? All right, we're going to run
[00:12:27] another one here for those that want to
[00:12:29] jump in on this. If they like, they can
[00:12:32] jump into the next part, the next
[00:12:33] adventurer
[00:12:34] here. All right, so like, all right, I'm
[00:12:38] going to play I'm going to I'm going to
[00:12:39] uh friendly brawl with you now for him
[00:12:42] with your weapons that you have, my
[00:12:45] friend. Big BK, you have
[00:12:49] uh only a pirate sword. All right. So,
[00:12:53] you have the pirate sword you can
[00:12:56] use and they have their own uh kind
[00:12:59] of couple of weapons there themselves.
[00:13:02] All right.
[00:13:03] So, that's that is a plus five uh six on
[00:13:08] your roll. So, he is a 17. That means
[00:13:11] you have to have an 11 to hit. Okay. An
[00:13:14] 11 to hit.
[00:13:17] And then but
[00:13:19] though let's see. Oh
[00:13:23] my that
[00:13:26] 11. Yes. Plus the three more or the nine
[00:13:29] for nine. Yes. Nine. Nine because of
[00:13:31] agility. Sorry I forgot. I always forget
[00:13:34] the added agility that you
[00:13:37] have. All right. You have uh you missed
[00:13:40] my friend. That that does not help.
[00:13:44] That does not
[00:13:45] help. Plus nine with a sword. Plus nine
[00:13:47] with the sword. Correct. And that
[00:13:49] doesn't help though. That guy
[00:13:51] goes laughs at you and uh they roll to
[00:13:58] attack. Well, that's in the middle. It
[00:14:02] looks like they have to go
[00:14:07] again. Oh, they get a 13.
[00:14:12] Halloween says, "I'm going to come
[00:14:16] in." Ah, you didn't say what you were
[00:14:18] wagering. All right. Oh, yes. We did
[00:14:20] not. You did not decide what you're
[00:14:21] waging. Ah. Ah. All right. What are you
[00:14:23] wagering? I was I was thinking it was
[00:14:24] going to be a Pogs wager. Or maybe it
[00:14:27] could be a weapon. He doesn't really
[00:14:29] have much on weapons there, but you
[00:14:30] know, you
[00:14:33] could. And then if you guys want, jump
[00:14:36] in on the uh on this. Get yourself a
[00:14:39] single some packs here. Or maybe um we
[00:14:41] have these couple of things that are in
[00:14:43] there too
[00:14:45] potentially. Run that again. There. I
[00:14:48] did jump the gun
[00:14:51] there. Where are Why isn't this doing
[00:14:53] things that I want?
[00:15:13] All right, we'll see if that one
[00:15:15] works. So, what do you got? He's He
[00:15:17] wants to wager some
[00:15:19] Pogs. Is that good with
[00:15:23] you? And the rest of you guys, I like
[00:15:25] any hanging out in here. Let me know if
[00:15:26] you want
[00:15:27] anything. How many? How about let's say
[00:15:31] uh 25
[00:15:34] Pogs? 50? Yeah, I can do 50. Let's do
[00:15:38] 50.
[00:15:43] All
[00:15:43] right. So, you guys weighed your
[00:15:47] 50. Get going
[00:15:49] there. Let me get this up set up
[00:16:03] quickly. Wow. My fingers don't want to
[00:16:05] type this morning.
[00:16:08] It's one of those days. I
[00:16:11] think Oh my god, my
[00:16:15] fingers. It's like they are Well, I also
[00:16:17] have like one less finger, so it does
[00:16:19] take me a little bit of thinking
[00:16:20] involved sometimes.
[00:16:24] So, all right. Got to get that set up
[00:16:30] there.
[00:16:32] No, there you go.
[00:16:37] Yeah. So, uh, this finger doesn't work.
[00:16:40] My pinky I I, if you notice, it doesn't
[00:16:41] bend or anything. I have broke it. I
[00:16:43] shattered it in four places and it
[00:16:45] doesn't work anymore past the knuck this
[00:16:46] knuckle. So, it doesn't bend anymore the
[00:16:48] same. And it hurts when I type on it and
[00:16:50] stuff like that.
[00:16:51] So, yeah. Yeah, I did. I shattered that
[00:16:54] a little while back
[00:16:56] there. All right, let's start now. You
[00:16:58] guys bet
[00:17:00] 50. You roll your dice.
[00:17:05] See what
[00:17:08] happens. Oh, you get a hit. Nice. Get
[00:17:11] yourself a hit for uh for
[00:17:16] four. The uh that guy laughs and goes
[00:17:20] four. Swings back at
[00:17:25] you. And oh, they hit for a uh
[00:17:30] eight 10. Look at that. They get hit for
[00:17:34] 10. They hit you for 10 there, my
[00:17:35] friend. Alrighty. Now you get two more
[00:17:39] swings with a friendly brawl here. So
[00:17:41] that brings you down to 77 on your
[00:17:44] health. All right, we're going to do the
[00:17:46] friendly brawl. Two
[00:17:50] more. Oh, I was frozen for a
[00:17:53] minute. You got a You get a nine plus a
[00:17:56] nine this time. So that gets you a hit
[00:17:58] cuz you needed
[00:17:59] 18. We good now? And you get five, six,
[00:18:08] seven. Oh, he got uh he got a 16 and he
[00:18:12] got
[00:18:13] 10 or 14 and he got
[00:18:16] 10. All right, but this time you hit him
[00:18:19] for uh six. Nice one
[00:18:22] there
[00:18:24] again. He laughs at you. Six.
[00:18:29] Haha. and
[00:18:31] he attacks
[00:18:33] himself to hit you
[00:18:37] for 18. Oh my buddy, this doesn't look
[00:18:42] like it's going to be in your
[00:18:44] favor. You are now at 59 health. You're
[00:18:48] a little bit bloody

[00:19:17] and a
[00:19:19] miss. And then they come back at you.
[00:19:21] And oh, they missed too. But you are
[00:19:24] beaten down a little bit compared to
[00:19:26] them. chat, who do you think won that
[00:19:29] battle
[00:19:31] there? Was it uh Big BK or was it the
[00:19:34] Challenger? I think the Challenger may
[00:19:35] have came come away with that
[00:19:37] uh with that three round win
[00:19:45] there. Neither of you died. No, neither
[00:19:48] of you died. That is true. That is true.

[00:19:54] Well, you're not supposed to die in a
[00:19:56] friendly brawl, you
[00:19:58] know. All right. I I just say I think
[00:20:00] big BK, I'm sorry, buddy. I think you
[00:20:03] may have um you may have missed it
[00:20:05] there. You go, "Oh, double or nothing."
[00:20:10] Okay. The uh the guy goes, "Uh, you know
[00:20:13] what? I don't mind that, but you may
[00:20:15] want to heal up a little bit.

[00:20:21] uh 59
[00:20:27] health. You're fine. Oh, you're going
[00:20:29] anyways. I don't care. You don't. You
[00:20:30] go. I don't care. And you go running
[00:20:33] in. You might have wanted to have
[00:20:37] cared within three there. And he goes,
[00:20:40] "All right, buddy." And he just steps
[00:20:42] out of the way as you give a wing a
[00:20:45] giant whiff of a swing at
[00:20:47] him. And they swing right on back.
[00:20:52] Luckily they miss,
[00:20:54] too. Well, look at that. He goes, "Well,
[00:20:57] I guess that one didn't work in my
[00:20:59] favor." And you go and you get a hit.
[00:21:04] Four 10. goes,
[00:21:07] "Oh, your man start the bit the brawler
[00:21:10] gets a little bit of blood on him."
[00:21:12] Goes,
[00:21:12] "Ah, I'm bleeding
[00:21:16] now. Let's see what
[00:21:22] happens." Oh, no. The bleeding
[00:21:24] intensifies his attack. He goes up
[00:21:29] to He hits you for 16 damage.
[00:21:38] bring you down to 43
[00:21:43] health. You had 10
[00:21:52] damage. Yeah, you did 10 that time.
[00:21:56] Yes. And then you swing again at him.
[00:21:58] And this time you hit you hit again for
[00:22:01] five.
[00:22:03] Six. You again for six. Now this guy
[00:22:06] does have 100 health just like you
[00:22:08] there. Friendly uh friendly brawl here.
[00:22:10] He laughs at your head again. Goes, "Ah,
[00:22:12] trying to draw more blood. Are
[00:22:16] you?" And he misses. This taunting is
[00:22:20] getting to him. He's making it. He's not
[00:22:22] doing
[00:22:24] well. Oh, this is not a fun fight right
[00:22:27] now.
[00:22:30] There's something broken with
[00:22:33] these. And he goes, you go after him one
[00:22:36] more time. You swing. And he
[00:22:38] swings,
[00:22:41] buddy. He hits you
[00:22:46] for 12
[00:22:48] [Music]
[00:22:49] 14. Bringing you down
[00:22:54] to 29 health.
[00:22:59] He looks at you, Big BK, and goes,
[00:23:01] "Buddy, have you had
[00:23:04] enough?" Big BK standing in front of him
[00:23:15] wobbling. All right, Big
[00:23:22] BK. Well, that's what I'm saying. This
[00:23:24] the uh we're gonna see what happens
[00:23:25] here. Do one last
[00:23:28] one. All right,
[00:23:30] big. Let's get a hit for you. Ooh,
[00:23:35] 12. 13. All
[00:23:38] right, you hit him for a big one there.
[00:23:41] He doesn't like
[00:23:42] that. So, he swings back, hitting you
[00:23:46] for an equally large one. Well, it looks
[00:23:49] like though they've hit you for uh 20.
[00:23:55] Oh, no. That does not
[00:23:59] No. Okay, you're good. 22 health. You're
[00:24:03] down to seven health, my friend. Big
[00:24:09] BK. Uh, and he looks at you. He's
[00:24:12] injured a little bit, too. But he looks
[00:24:13] at you and goes, "Hey, buddy. You may
[00:24:15] want to take a break here."
[00:24:23] It is three hits each. You're you're
[00:24:26] Yes, but they they almost killed you
[00:24:27] compared to your hits for the damage.
[00:24:32] That's He goes, I I like your
[00:24:35] tenacity with a double or
[00:24:38] nothing that we did. That would have
[00:24:41] been 100. How about this? I'm only
[00:24:44] taking
[00:24:44] 75, which will leave
[00:24:47] you 35
[00:24:51] pogs. And you uh the reason why I left
[00:24:56] you with that is if you go back over
[00:24:58] into the
[00:25:00] uh refugee camp that we're in here, go
[00:25:03] turn back
[00:25:04] around. There's a guy over there at the
[00:25:06] black market. He has some uh uh he has a
[00:25:09] way to heal you full for 25 health.
[00:25:14] Yes, you lost
[00:25:16] 50 and then double or nothing is you
[00:25:19] said
[00:25:20] 100. That would be 100,
[00:25:23] right? Or am I messing that
[00:25:32] up? So, you were at 10060 Pogs is what I
[00:25:35] had because of the last one. You got
[00:25:40] something? Well, y 50
[00:25:43] 50. Well, you uh All right. Yeah, sure.

[00:26:02] to jump in and then I'm going to go and
[00:26:04] I'm going to put in one of
[00:26:06] these because I forgot to do that
[00:26:08] earlier.
[00:26:14] Let me add that
[00:26:22] in so that we can do a little giveaway
[00:26:25] while I want to go wander and grab some

[00:28:44] my, uh, my sister's boyfriend, um, he I
[00:28:48] don't know how he runs into this [ __ ]
[00:28:50] but, uh, in some random place, he found
[00:28:53] this some dude with a truck full like a
[00:28:56] I don't know what he call them, like a
[00:28:57] like a box truck full of uh, energy
[00:28:59] drinks from random companies. And he
[00:29:02] bought like four four like uh 12-pack
[00:29:05] things of them. You know, like you come
[00:29:06] in this when the wood they ship them in.
[00:29:09] And uh they were like a dollar or $2 for
[00:29:13] a pack. So we bought like a ton of
[00:29:15] them. I'm like, you know, I'm like
[00:29:18] looking at them like making sure they're
[00:29:19] not like going to kill us cuz he handed
[00:29:21] enough handed me like four of them. Like
[00:29:24] I don't
[00:29:25] know. And then when we got them, we like
[00:29:28] they're like Celsius. So they're
[00:29:29] actually pretty good. They aren't bad.
[00:29:31] But I'm like, this guy definitely either
[00:29:32] works for somebody or has a friend that
[00:29:34] these fell off the
[00:29:37] truck. Packed all terror venom sack lag.

[00:30:08] the um
[00:30:11] bundle. All righty. Let me get this in a
[00:30:13] sleeve for

[00:30:35] you don't get a great pack
[00:30:37] there when you're wandering around
[00:30:49] there. Why not? We'll use this.
[00:30:55] This is not exactly what I actually told
[00:30:56] it. I had was trying to make a
[00:30:58] description so I can uh have it made
[00:31:00] somewhere else, but I had this made for
[00:31:02] me instead. So, we're going to try it.

[00:31:36] if this works. Here you are.
[00:31:39] Uh, you've made your
[00:31:42] way into this location
[00:31:47] here, which is the Vaultorn
[00:31:51] Armory. Oh, you want to go back to the

[00:32:12] heal. You're very welcome. Now, I need
[00:32:14] from you a number between 1 and 10 if
[00:32:16] you don't mind because you get yourself
[00:32:17] It's a discount on shipping, but you
[00:32:18] might get yourself a single that's in
[00:32:20] here. That could be a rare of some
[00:32:22] kind. And you go over and you see one of
[00:32:24] them there. You go to the black market
[00:32:26] vendor. You get over to them. He says,
[00:32:28] "Hey, I see you're a little injured."
[00:32:29] You go, "Yeah, heal me,
[00:32:32] please." Number seven. All
[00:32:35] right. One, two, three, four, five, six,
[00:32:38] and seven. Let's see what you get there.
[00:32:41] You've got Oh, look at that. It is the
[00:32:43] rare over the top. Look at that.
[00:32:46] Boom. 25 Pogs. That is correct. and
[00:32:50] Reaper of
[00:32:54] Deals. Now, remember, there are all
[00:32:56] kinds of singles in the buy now. There's
[00:32:58] also packs available in the buy now. If
[00:33:00] you just want to type packs in, you
[00:33:01] should be able to see them all. You even
[00:33:03] have secret layer in the buy now. And
[00:33:05] you also have uh decks in the buy
[00:33:08] now. And again, I'm going to burn my

[00:33:34] You go back up to 100
[00:33:39] health.
[00:33:45] Now, right now, that black market vendor
[00:33:48] is uh only doing some healing at the
[00:33:49] moment. They're that's all they're doing
[00:33:51] currently. They were going around with
[00:33:54] that uh refugee camp helping heal them
[00:33:56] all. He doesn't have any of his other
[00:33:57] supplies with him. The rest of them were
[00:34:00] uh he lives in different places.
[00:34:05] All
[00:34:06] right. So, you uh you head over that
[00:34:08] armory and you walk
[00:34:10] in. All right. Let's see. Let's see if
[00:34:12] this worked here. Now, you go in here.
[00:34:14] This is our
[00:34:15] map. Let's see. Now, you have the option
[00:34:19] go in a few different places and see
[00:34:22] what you run
[00:34:23] into. Now, these are uh different
[00:34:25] people. You could be good, bad, who
[00:34:28] knows? But you go straight on in.
[00:34:32] The first thing that you
[00:34:34] see when you get
[00:34:41] inside. Hi there, buddy. Good morning.
[00:34:45] Good morning. Is
[00:34:48] a small raider hanging out in
[00:34:51] there like what are you doing in our
[00:34:54] area? Sitting that bow and
[00:34:58] raider slice them. All right. All right,
[00:35:01] you're going to use your
[00:35:03] uh your sword. You just charge in with
[00:35:09] that. And
[00:35:12] um slicing doesn't
[00:35:18] work. Slicing doesn't work. Do you uh do
[00:35:21] you have your friend uh Halloween? Is
[00:35:23] Halloween coming along with you?
[00:35:32] run another here for those of you want
[00:35:34] to come
[00:35:43] in. Yes, but that doesn't help with two
[00:35:47] when you needed 15 when you rolled a
[00:35:50] two.
[00:36:08] Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. You have
[00:36:11] luck,
[00:36:14] engineering, and then you also have the
[00:36:16] consumables of agility and engineering.
[00:36:19] But you have luck, engineering,
[00:36:22] intelligence,
[00:36:25] agility, and then your one gives you uh
[00:36:29] your sword gives you some
[00:36:31] extra agility on top of it. So you have
[00:36:34] one,
[00:36:36] two, yeah, three extra on the
[00:36:42] agility. Yes, he does shoot you. Yes, he
[00:36:45] does. I didn't know if you were bringing
[00:36:46] Halloween along.
[00:36:48] He shoots and he hits you for one
[00:36:51] damage. He kind of looks at you like,
[00:36:53] "Uh, hm, I don't know if that works."
[00:36:56] Well, the little guy looks back at you
[00:36:58] like, "Huh, interesting." What does that
[00:37:01] mean? Nine bags. It just
[00:37:05] uh not now. Okay, you can you can watch,
[00:37:08] but not now. Don't ask me a question
[00:37:10] like that at the moment. That would take
[00:37:12] me away from what I'm trying to
[00:37:13] accomplish here. Okay, that's fine.
[00:37:19] Um, all right. So, you say you're going
[00:37:24] to use your sword again.
[00:37:28] Sorry. With a sword. You go in another
[00:37:31] time. Why does it not want to work right
[00:37:38] now? Oh, and this time you hit. Now,
[00:37:41] this little guy is only 15 and you hit
[00:37:43] him 14.
[00:37:46] Little guy's got one damage
[00:37:49] left. He shoots wildly at you and turns
[00:37:51] and
[00:37:52] runs. And he misses while he shoots
[00:37:55] wildly. When he turns and
[00:38:00] runs, little guy is the first one that
[00:38:02] you see here from the bottom up. He
[00:38:06] turns and
[00:38:07] runs to the left. Oh, that should be
[00:38:10] your left where that uh the other side
[00:38:12] is there. Trying to hide.

[00:42:38] Also, we forgot.
[00:42:44] Oh, we did because we were
[00:42:49] uh talking and we got sidetracked and
[00:42:51] pulled back to the other place. That's
[00:42:53] why that's why I was getting it ready
[00:42:55] and then I got sidetracked with that
[00:42:57] one. So, you get yourself one of the
[00:42:58] weapons here. you know, one of the basic
[00:42:59] ones that we have. You're wandering
[00:43:01] through there in the front of that
[00:43:02] place, you find that guy drops either a
[00:43:04] pistol, an assault
[00:43:06] rifle, a sword, a plasma
[00:43:11] rifle, or a knife. When they run away,
[00:43:14] what one need? He needs throwing
[00:43:16] knives, AR. All right, let's grab the
[00:43:19] AR. You pick that up that you find. Add
[00:43:23] that to the inventory. It gives you 15
[00:43:24] added ammo. Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:43:27] You do need that for your ammo there. So
[00:43:29] that brings you up to Oh my,
[00:43:34] I guess 100. And you have an AR.
[00:43:44] Here we go.
[00:43:53] Got a couple things. Got a couple
[00:43:55] things. So you got that for your weapon
[00:43:56] there. They drop some stuff. Get a
[00:43:59] little bit of an encounter there. All
[00:44:00] right. You got your side objective.
[00:44:02] That's where a side objective comes in.
[00:44:04] All right. So you, my friend, have a
[00:44:06] side
[00:44:08] objective. You have uh you have to go
[00:44:10] over where that scavenger is, you know.
[00:44:12] All
[00:44:13] right. I know he did say you had a lot
[00:44:16] of stuff. You go wander off to the side
[00:44:18] there. And one of the things is you
[00:44:22] see something on the side. I gota That's
[00:44:25] what I need to do. Ah, that's what I was
[00:44:27] trying to do. Hold on a second. Give me
[00:44:29] one second here. I'm going to make this
[00:44:30] a little easier for
[00:44:45] myself. No, I don't need to put it in
[00:44:47] itself. Dang it.
[00:45:04] Give me just one second here because I'm
[00:45:06] trying to get it so I can make this go
[00:45:08] over everything I
[00:45:15] need because I keep bumping around and
[00:45:17] I'm going to the wrong location a couple
[00:45:19] of times and I'm like, you know what?
[00:45:20] Let's do this instead cuz we're all
[00:45:22] going to be in this one place for a
[00:45:24] little
[00:45:25] bit for a
[00:45:35] few. All right, here we
[00:45:41] go. That's where you're going first
[00:45:43] anyways. All right, you go to the left
[00:45:44] there. All right. You go and you take
[00:45:46] your left
[00:45:47] turn that armory there and you
[00:45:53] see when you go in
[00:45:57] there the
[00:46:01] uh where is
[00:46:10] this? Another scrapper is in there. Hey,
[00:46:13] what are you doing in my area? It's my
[00:46:16] stuff. I found it.
[00:46:29] So, you have to
[00:46:32] decide what are you doing. Oh, you're
[00:46:34] going to shoot him. So, what you're
[00:46:36] going to
[00:46:38] do? You do need fogs for creating a
[00:46:40] machete. That's true.
[00:46:42] Now, the side quest here is the part of
[00:46:44] the side quest part is
[00:46:47] this. When you're in here, you hear some
[00:46:50] buzzing. See a little hole in the
[00:46:53] corner. You have to investigate the
[00:47:01] hole. So,
[00:47:05] well, what do you want to do, my friend?
[00:47:13] as you wander through our wasteland.
[00:47:16] Now, we're going to do um we're going to
[00:47:17] do this from now on. I'm going to try to
[00:47:19] do it like this. We're going to run it
[00:47:21] these the next ones. Everyone's going to
[00:47:22] run for a minute and a half. That way,
[00:47:25] everybody gets a minute and a half and
[00:47:26] we can continue rolling with the thing
[00:47:28] here. Oh, you're killing them. All
[00:47:30] right. So, you go and you
[00:47:36] shoot or you using your sword? What are
[00:47:38] you using,
[00:47:41] Big BK? What are you using for a weapon
[00:47:43] there?
[00:47:51] The Gat. All
[00:48:03] right. All right. Go on.
[00:48:09] And you're going to use the gatling gun.
[00:48:11] Take that
[00:48:13] out. And you go and you roll. Let's see
[00:48:17] what
[00:48:24] happens. I think that's in the middle.
[00:48:27] That looks in the middle. You got lucky,
[00:48:29] buddy. We have to do another
[00:48:33] roll. You
[00:48:35] get that guy. And he's at 20 health. And
[00:48:39] you hit him for 8 16. No, 12. You hit
[00:48:44] him for 12 health. They're now at eight
[00:48:47] health
[00:48:50] left. And our buddy, uh, Halloween, are
[00:48:53] you still there? You're going to stab
[00:48:54] him. Use your knife. Try to have Oh, you
[00:48:57] have two knives. Hold
[00:48:59] on. Well, you want to stay with the one
[00:49:01] knife with a natural 20 there. I think
[00:49:02] it's probably a good idea. Here you go.
[00:49:06] You stab that
[00:49:08] guy and when you stab them, your natural
[00:49:12] 20 there generates
[00:49:15] a a minor earth. I assume he dies. Yes,
[00:49:20] he does die. He dies and that little
[00:49:22] thing happens and then a bunch of pogs
[00:49:25] fall out of his pocket. You find 75 pogs
[00:49:30] fall out. What?
[00:49:33] And then you go over to your hole that
[00:49:35] he was guarding
[00:49:38] there. And in that hole, you see a
[00:49:42] locked chest.
[00:49:57] Oh, you're opening it. All right. Well,
[00:50:00] uh, how are you going to open it? You
[00:50:01] have to, you know, you got to force it
[00:50:10] open. We'll keep running this for those
[00:50:13] that want to try and jump in with us.
[00:50:15] Try try prying it open. All right. You
[00:50:16] use uh use your sword. Try prying it
[00:50:19] open. All right. Luck. Let's see if it
[00:50:23] happens. Now you have Let's see what you
[00:50:26] have for luck. That's why I need to
[00:50:27] check here. You have
[00:50:28] um luck +
[00:50:31] one. All right. You have luck plus one.
[00:50:34] All right. So that means you need to
[00:50:36] have a nine or higher
[00:50:40] and intelligence. Well, look at that.
[00:50:44] How is a a natural 20
[00:50:48] there? That's pretty
[00:50:51] sweet. Well, you go
[00:50:54] over. Didn't even pry it open. I know.
[00:50:58] You go over there, you pry it
[00:51:00] open, and inside there's actually not
[00:51:03] much in
[00:51:06] there. Where'd it go? Come
[00:51:09] on. But you
[00:51:19] do find this weird thing in the box. All
[00:51:24] right.
[00:51:26] This is a weapons
[00:51:29] upgrade system that the Vaultorn had
[00:51:35] created. The Rustborne don't really know
[00:51:37] how it works. Well, so maybe uh
[00:51:45] uh you know the Vaultorn here, you need
[00:51:47] to you need to see what you can do. But
[00:51:49] this is uh you don't know it. This needs
[00:51:51] to take a bit of time here for you to
[00:51:52] learn. All right. So, you need to that
[00:51:55] is your side quest that you have now
[00:51:58] received. So, I'm going to put that in
[00:52:00] with uh add you and add it in
[00:52:09] there. Your side quest is the upgrade
[00:52:14] vault. The upgrade
[00:52:17] machine.
[00:52:20] No, no, you can't take it with you. It
[00:52:22] stays there. you can go
[00:52:24] back. Um, and well,
[00:52:28] actually, you know
[00:52:31] what? You can't carry it with you
[00:52:33] continuously because it takes up a lot
[00:52:35] of spots. How's
[00:52:37] that? So, it's going to take up four of
[00:52:41] your um of your inventory spots. So, you
[00:52:43] can carry it with you, but it's going to
[00:52:44] take up a lot of your inventory spots.
[00:52:58] And you
[00:53:03] have 13 spots of your 17 U's. So you can
[00:53:08] actually take
[00:53:15] it. 25 for you and seven. I like it. All
[00:53:19] right. All right. So, you take it and
[00:53:20] you have uh I didn't think you were
[00:53:22] going to be able to hold that. All
[00:53:23] right. So, you have the upgrade machine
[00:53:25] which holds
[00:53:28] uh now you don't know how to use it. It
[00:53:31] holds four spots. That means you have no
[00:53:33] spots available left in your
[00:53:35] inventory. And then my buddy here,
[00:53:37] serotonin got a Modern Horizon
[00:53:41] 3 play booster. That's a nice one, my
[00:53:44] friend.
[00:53:46] And you also got a salvage roll. All
[00:53:51] right, I'll tell you what you have in
[00:53:53] there. Give me one
[00:53:55] second. And I'll open up for our friend.
[00:53:59] So you have a two health packs count as
[00:54:01] one spot. Three rataway counts as one
[00:54:04] spot. You have incendiary gun, pirate
[00:54:07] sword, alien sniper, flamethrower, the
[00:54:10] AR. You also have the crack binoculars.
[00:54:13] You have the the one time use plus one
[00:54:15] roll lock for one roll. The map, some
[00:54:18] metal, you have a broken rustorn drone,
[00:54:21] two cyborg arms, and now the upgrade
[00:54:27] machine. You got a lot of stuff in your
[00:54:29] bag there,
[00:54:30] dude. All right, good luck, my friends.
[00:54:33] Serotonin, let's see what we get going
[00:54:35] for you here in this beautiful pack.
[00:54:37] Good luck. One, two, three, four, five,
[00:54:41] six, seven, eight. Put the spoilers at
[00:54:44] the end
[00:54:45] here. You do need to get rid of some of
[00:54:48] it. Now,
[00:54:50] um, one of the things I was planning on
[00:54:52] having coming up here was when you meet
[00:54:54] your factions in the in the not too
[00:54:55] distant future, you'll be able to have
[00:54:57] uh have them hold on to some stuff and
[00:54:58] like kind of go back and forth and pick
[00:55:00] it up. Nyxorn
[00:55:02] unicorn, Aldrazzi repurposer, shattered
[00:55:05] landscape, mandibler kite, fed
[00:55:07] gargantua, thriving skycaw, electrosa,
[00:55:11] muster the departed, worm coil larva,
[00:55:15] quest for the necropolis, sundering
[00:55:17] eruption, annoyed altasaur. Not bad on
[00:55:20] that. Ooh, cosix's
[00:55:22] command. Oh, buddy, congratulations.
[00:55:26] serotonin, galvanic discharge and foil
[00:55:30] and an
[00:55:31] Aldrazi
[00:55:32] token. Unless that dropped. That used to
[00:55:35] be like a $20
[00:55:38] card. It might have dropped a little
[00:55:40] bit. I'm guessing around 10ish
[00:55:43] now. That was a nice pickup there, my
[00:55:47] friend. There you go. Actually, let me
[00:55:50] write your name on
[00:55:52] this. Oh, it's Oh, dropped down to
[00:55:55] seven. Hey yo. All right.
[00:55:59] Well, they fluctuate so much. It's like
[00:56:02] uh can't remember who told me. It's like
[00:56:05] gold watching that. He said seven.
[00:56:10] It is a hit. Still a good hit.
[00:56:12] Definitely a good hit.
[00:56:15] Exactly. Market is always up and down.
[00:56:17] Exactly. And plus, it's just a good
[00:56:18] playing good card to have in a deck
[00:56:20] anyways. You know what I
[00:56:21] mean? No. No. Generally, those don't not
[00:56:24] that one. All
[00:56:25] right, here we go. So, serotonin, you've
[00:56:28] uh I don't know if I've had you in here
[00:56:29] playing before. Give me a
[00:56:36] second. No, we have not. We got you new
[00:56:39] here. First time. All right, Saraton.
[00:56:42] Oh, when you are a first time adventurer
[00:56:45] here, you get yourself you start with
[00:56:49] 100
[00:56:51] health and you get a pistol and a
[00:56:56] knife to start your uh adventure
[00:56:59] with. And you, my friend, are an
[00:57:01] adventurer.
[00:57:07] We'll see.
[00:57:15] Where is
[00:57:17] it? And you uh you had been wandering
[00:57:19] around here this this adventure here.
[00:57:21] You don't have much on for armor or
[00:57:22] anything like that, but you got yourself
[00:57:23] a knife and a
[00:57:25] pistol. And when you uh you saw this guy
[00:57:28] fighting over here, kind of wandered
[00:57:31] their direction. And when you
[00:57:35] did, see if I can find it.
[00:57:39] You found
[00:57:42] yourself some things to
[00:57:44] salvage. Now, let's see if I can get it
[00:57:46] here to
[00:57:49] show. Go. You found a little bit of
[00:57:53] leather and some scrap metal hanging
[00:57:56] out. Now, if you pick some of that up,
[00:58:00] you might be able to use have somebody
[00:58:01] help uh build you something later
[00:58:04] on in in the uh in the wasteland there.
[00:58:07] Now, we got to know what you know we
[00:58:09] know is what you're going to pick up or
[00:58:10] what you'd like to grab or salvage from
[00:58:12] there. And then you will uh the next
[00:58:17] time we encounter a person that is a
[00:58:19] maybe a vendor, you might be able to
[00:58:20] have make
[00:58:22] something. Um Oh, I hadn't had anybody
[00:58:25] ask to take some of both. You know what?
[00:58:27] Why not take some of both? All right,
[00:58:29] we're going to roll. We'll roll. The
[00:58:30] point is we roll to see who how much you
[00:58:33] take. So, if it's over uh kind of like
[00:58:38] small amount, medium, large amount is
[00:58:39] kind of how we go. All right. How much
[00:58:41] you able to grab? I was sitting right
[00:58:43] here. H not bad. Not bad. It's all
[00:58:45] right. So, you got you grab yourself.
[00:58:47] So, you are able to grab, you know, I'll
[00:58:48] say you can grab both of them. That's
[00:58:50] good enough in the middle there. You can
[00:58:51] get both of
[00:58:53] them. Wasn't it wasn't low just cuz if
[00:58:56] it was low, I would have been like, you
[00:58:57] can only carry one thing. You know what
[00:58:58] I mean? So you have
[00:59:01] leather and metal scraps.
[00:59:06] There you go, my friend.
[00:59:11] So you take them both. I like it. So
[00:59:14] you're hoping that you run into somebody
[00:59:16] while you're wandering around. You see
[00:59:17] some battling going on. You got your
[00:59:19] pistol there and you're like, I don't
[00:59:20] know if I want to bump into anybody
[00:59:21] fighting just yet because them fighting
[00:59:24] words are a little dangerous. But you
[00:59:26] get your stuff there and you're
[00:59:29] wandering looking for the different
[00:59:31] places. And let's see if I can build
[00:59:35] this
[00:59:36] correctly. Now you're you you want to
[00:59:38] wander into the armory or you would you
[00:59:41] like to um you can always hang out
[00:59:44] around the
[00:59:50] uh around the wasteland, burnt out
[00:59:52] buildings and stuff like that.
[00:59:54] Investigating
[00:59:57] Head into the armory with the rest. All
[00:59:59] right, you following behind to the
[01:00:02] armory. Falling behind the rest of
[01:00:04] everyone going, "Hey, this is intriguing
[01:00:06] going on. See some battles
[01:00:09] occurring. There's a blood on the
[01:00:11] ground."
[01:00:15] Huh. Oh, look at that. Look at this
[01:00:18] thing. And you go over in the corner and
[01:00:20] you see one, two, three,
[01:00:22] four pogs. Looks like they must somebody
[01:00:25] must have left some Pogs in the corner.
[01:00:27] These are wasting currency. So,
[01:00:29] Saratonin, you actually have we're going
[01:00:31] to give you four Pogs
[01:00:35] now. All righty. There you go.
[01:00:50] All right, let's see what we got going
[01:00:52] on now. Where are we going in this
[01:00:54] location here? Oh, all right. You have
[01:00:57] an Aether drift
[01:00:58] pack. All right. I like
[01:01:00] it. An Aether drift pack right
[01:01:04] there. Let's get uh this open. And then
[01:01:07] what happens is you get a little bit of
[01:01:09] an upgrade you get to do. Look at this.
[01:01:10] You, my friend,
[01:01:17] when you're in that corner there, you
[01:01:19] find a little workbench. It looks like

[01:01:23] things trying to fix up that uh
[01:01:26] fix up that uh machine that was

[01:02:54] to work a little bit. You've been
[01:02:55] playing around with it, poking at it,
[01:02:57] and you have something you go you want
[01:02:59] to put something in there to
[01:03:03] test. I know. So, my point is you can
[01:03:06] try it. I say if you want to, you can
[01:03:09] say, "Hey, uh, want me to uh throw in
[01:03:11] you can put the flamethrower in." That's
[01:03:13] true. Or you could use um if you want to
[01:03:16] use take some of Halloween's knives and
[01:03:18] say if you can convert them into uh
[01:03:19] maybe actual throwing knives for them
[01:03:21] rather than just the knives that they're
[01:03:22] throwing and see if that'll work.
[01:03:27] Here, let's do that. We can do that. All
[01:03:29] right. So, our buddy um
[01:03:33] Halloween has five knives. All
[01:03:36] right. Our buddy Halloween has five
[01:03:40] knives. They've been using them as
[01:03:41] throwing knives. So, let's see if we can
[01:03:43] actually convert them to
[01:03:45] uh make some throwing knives, actually.
[01:03:47] So, here is what we got to do. We have a
[01:03:49] dice roll. You have your luck. So, that
[01:03:50] means you have to have a Oh, wait. You
[01:03:52] have engineering, too, don't
[01:03:55] you? You have engineering, intelligence,
[01:03:58] and luck. Oh, so you get a plus three.
[01:04:01] So that means you have to have a seven
[01:04:02] or higher.
[01:04:06] 17. Well, there you go. An eight does
[01:04:09] it, my friend.
[01:04:11] So you put those five knives in there
[01:04:13] and they come out now a little different
[01:04:15] image as throwing
[01:04:26] knives. All right, here we go. Let me do
[01:04:28] this
[01:04:29] quickly and get something
[01:04:58] All right, let's try that. Here we go.
[01:04:59] Let's see if this will work here
[01:05:03] quickly. Hey, how's it going everybody?
[01:05:05] Hope you're having a good one. We're
[01:05:06] going to get a good image for that.
[01:05:30] Try
[01:05:48] that. There we go. That's a good one. I
[01:05:50] like that.
[01:05:56] All right. So, this is going to be our
[01:05:59] image for our throwing knives. We got
[01:06:00] that. It'll be there in a second. So,
[01:06:02] you got yourselves some throwing knives.
[01:06:04] There you go.
[01:06:08] Now, with the throwing knives, instead
[01:06:09] of plus two for your throwing knives
[01:06:12] where each time you throw them, we're
[01:06:14] going to give you actually a uh plus
[01:06:17] four since they are
[01:06:19] actually used themselves. And it's going
[01:06:23] to allow you to actually throw actually,
[01:06:25] you know what? No, you get to throw I'm
[01:06:28] going to do it like this. We'll allow
[01:06:29] you to throw three of them, but they'll
[01:06:31] And they'll all be plus three. That's
[01:06:33] how it'll do. You can throw three at
[01:06:35] once and they'll all be plus
[01:06:44] three. Throwing knife. These
[01:06:49] are plus
[01:06:55] three. There you
[01:06:58] go. Plus three instead of plus two.
[01:07:01] Yeah. Normally they're plus two. So now
[01:07:03] they're plus three and you can throw
[01:07:05] three of them at once rather than one of
[01:07:06] them at once. Now you can throw up to
[01:07:07] three of
[01:07:08] them. That's why I figure I think that
[01:07:11] that's pretty good one, right? All
[01:07:12] right. Here we go. We have our uh our
[01:07:14] image here. Ooh. Ready? Here's our
[01:07:16] throwing
[01:07:21] knives. Throwing knives. Let's see if
[01:07:23] you like we like them. Let me know if we
[01:07:25] like
[01:07:25] them. I think this is a tolerable
[01:07:28] throwing knives
[01:07:29] image. So, whenever you need some
[01:07:31] throwing knives, we can throw those put
[01:07:33] these up
[01:07:37] here. There you go. What do you guys
[01:07:40] think? Throwing
[01:07:41] knives. That's what that works,
[01:07:55] right? Throwing knives are there. Boom.
[01:07:58] There you go.
[01:08:01] little upgrade for
[01:08:02] you. There you go. You got some throwing
[01:08:05] knives thanks to our buddy Big
[01:08:07] BK. And uh you
[01:08:11] guys, when you're in there, you hear a
[01:08:13] little
[01:08:14] uh
[01:08:17] rustling just
[01:08:22] outside. And that's when you have two
[01:08:26] small raiders. One of them comes running
[01:08:27] back, the one that was injured. He's not
[01:08:29] fully healed. He's only at seven health
[01:08:30] and one of them is at 15 health. The
[01:08:33] three of you are there now because
[01:08:35] serotonin comes in behind. Going to
[01:08:37] throw the knives. All right, let's do
[01:08:39] it. Going to throw the
[01:08:41] knives. All three of them. Are you going
[01:08:44] to throw? Who you throwing them at? And
[01:08:46] then uh Big, what are you going to do?
[01:08:49] The injured one or the one that's not
[01:08:50] injured? It's up to you. And we'll run
[01:08:52] another one to finish this off here. And
[01:08:54] once this is done, we'll go to the next
[01:08:55] encounter thing here going on. All
[01:08:57] right.
[01:09:00] Hopefully
[01:09:01] uh not the injured one. All right, we're
[01:09:03] going to throw it at the uh the one
[01:09:04] that's not injured. Here you go. Let's
[01:09:06] see what happens
[01:09:10] here. Your throwing knives give you plus
[01:09:14] three. They needed to be a 14 or more to
[01:09:18] hit. You plus three and you throw three
[01:09:21] of them. Did not
[01:09:25] work.
[01:09:27] H. That doesn't work there. You You
[01:09:31] missed. And you going to shoot the
[01:09:33] injured one with the pistol. All right.
[01:09:35] I like it. You shoot the injured one
[01:09:36] with the pistol. What's Big BK
[01:09:40] doing? You missed the injured
[01:09:43] one. You going to shoot the injured one
[01:09:45] with your gatling? I like
[01:09:48] it. Oh my big BK. Your gun
[01:09:52] jams. The two small raiders look at you
[01:09:55] guys like, "Wow, what just happened
[01:09:57] there?" And they
[01:10:00] shoot. And they
[01:10:02] miss. Oh my
[01:10:05] god. That's
[01:10:09] insane. So you run over. You only have
[01:10:11] two knives
[01:10:13] left. So you have to throw your other
[01:10:15] two
[01:10:18] knives. I get a nine.
[01:10:24] Big BK. I I mean Halloween, buddy. You
[01:10:26] You need to Maybe next time you focus on
[01:10:28] some
[01:10:30] agility. And you go and you slice the
[01:10:32] injured one up. I like it. You use this
[01:10:34] to slice him up.
[01:10:56] Um
[01:10:58] well, you
[01:11:01] missed maybe. Um
[01:11:08] [Music]
[01:11:10] um All right. So when you swing
[01:11:13] there in your process of
[01:11:16] missing, all right, you actually fall to
[01:11:19] the
[01:11:22] ground. All right, you fall to the
[01:11:26] ground and uh you take out Halloween at
[01:11:29] the
[01:11:31] knees. So Halloween is now on the ground
[01:11:34] with
[01:11:35] you because Halloween's been doing
[01:11:38] pretty shitty himself and can't [ __ ]
[01:11:40] hit a broadside of a barn when he's
[01:11:43] standing in front of it. So Halloween
[01:11:45] falls down
[01:11:46] also. And um you got your new guy there,
[01:11:50] Saraton. I mean like I don't know if I
[01:11:52] want to be hanging out with these
[01:11:53] adventurers. These guys are uh they
[01:11:57] might be
[01:11:58] dangerous. Serotonin, what are you doing
[01:12:00] buddy? You going to run and walk away
[01:12:03] from these guys and let them die or you
[01:12:04] going to uh you going to do something to
[01:12:05] take over? Remember everybody at the box
[01:12:07] here? You going to help them? All right.
[01:12:10] What are you doing, my friend? To
[01:12:15] help. You did
[01:12:18] not. You shooting again. You taking your
[01:12:21] pistol and oh
[01:12:23] boy, I think it's rubbing off. You all
[01:12:27] miss. And then those two raiders, they
[01:12:31] go uh uh
[01:12:33] uh and they shoot our buddy on the
[01:12:37] ground there and hit you for
[01:12:41] eight, bringing you down to
[01:12:44] 92
[01:12:49] health. All right. Now they shut the
[01:12:52] door on you
[01:12:53] guys in that uh Vault Born Armory there
[01:12:58] and they you hear them run away again.
[01:13:00] They're mumbling, saying something to
[01:13:01] themselves. You don't really know what's
[01:13:02] going on, but they run away and you guys
[01:13:04] are stuck in there. Door shut. Allows
[01:13:06] them to
[01:13:08] escape. Your gun is unjammed now. But
[01:13:11] they they ran away. They did run away.
[01:13:28] Exactly. You're not stuck. Ex. Exactly.
[01:13:31] You got a You got your buddy here.
[01:13:34] Halloween. He may be um dumb and not
[01:13:37] able to throw knives that he asked for,
[01:13:39] but at
[01:13:40] least he can be a big brute and run
[01:13:43] through a door, right? Lucifer coming
[01:13:46] in. been hanging out with us. Oo. All
[01:13:48] right, buddy. All right, we got this

[01:15:36] light. Not bad.

[01:15:41] melatin poet. I've not seen that one.
[01:15:44] That's a nice one there. And then an
[01:15:47] Adelon of astral winds. Oh, I like that

[01:15:55] rare and your enchanted there. Let me
[01:15:57] get you in a sleeve. Protect some of
[01:15:58] your stuff. Yeah. And then
[01:16:01] Lucifer, how you you hear some things
[01:16:04] going on here.
[01:16:07] Do you want to wander in with them or
[01:16:10] are you going to stay out in the
[01:16:11] wasteland area or or would you like to
[01:16:13] wander towards that uh vault that you
[01:16:15] hear a little bit of a ruckus going on?
[01:16:27] Lucero. Come join us this Halloween.
[01:16:30] You're going to wander. Oh, you're going
[01:16:32] to wander toward the danger.
[01:16:36] I know. Stay away. You got currently the
[01:16:38] terrible rolls. You hopefully don't have
[01:16:39] the luck running off from them. All
[01:16:42] right. So, you
[01:16:44] wander and you hear some things. You go
[01:16:46] in and you see the armory there. The
[01:16:47] door is open. You wander in the door and
[01:16:50] in front of you, you see two small
[01:16:51] raiders. One's
[01:16:53] injured, only has five health, and the
[01:16:55] other one's at 15
[01:16:57] health. The one at uh five health goes,
[01:17:00] "Hey, I'm going to run tell everybody
[01:17:01] what's going on." The one at 15 health
[01:17:03] stands there in front of you. You have a
[01:17:05] pistol and a knife. The other guys are
[01:17:06] stuck in the do room yet though. They
[01:17:08] haven't made their yourself out of the
[01:17:09] room
[01:17:10] yet. So, you don't have them for health
[01:17:13] at the moment. You do have fun. You guys
[01:17:16] do have fun. That's true. What are you
[01:17:18] going to do with your You have a pistol
[01:17:19] or a knife you can shoot with and
[01:17:20] they're 15 on their
[01:17:22] health. Let's find out
[01:17:27] today. What will you be?
[01:17:33] Ah, I like it. Take the knife and go for
[01:17:36] the
[01:17:38] juggler. You run towards that small
[01:17:40] raider with your
[01:17:41] knife.
[01:17:46] And is that in the middle of a natural
[01:17:50] 20? Do we want to give him the natural
[01:17:52] 20 for the first
[01:17:54] one? Give it Give it to him. I think
[01:17:57] we'll give him the natural 20 for the
[01:17:58] first one. All right, we'll give him a
[01:18:00] natural 20. All right, you go in with
[01:18:04] your
[01:18:06] knife swinging for the
[01:18:10] juggler. Yes, if you actually type in um
[01:18:13] I actually have a good chunk of Marvel
[01:18:15] secret layer. So, if you go into the buy
[01:18:18] now and literally type in
[01:18:22] Marvel, then secret
[01:18:25] layer. Uh, you should see a bunch of
[01:18:28] them pop up. Like a ton of Marvel secret
[01:18:31] layers pop
[01:18:32] up.
[01:18:34] Deionize. All right. So, you got your
[01:18:36] natural 20. Now, with your natural
[01:18:38] 20, you got to see what you get for an
[01:18:41] extra there. So, your dice
[01:18:44] roll. Oh,
[01:18:47] buddy. That's a multiplication factor
[01:18:53] of two.
[01:18:56] So that means not well there you go. You
[01:18:59] hit that guy and I think they only have
[01:19:02] now was what six was there. So they're
[01:19:04] down and to uh three health
[01:19:09] left. They look at you. The juggler's
[01:19:14] bleeding and they swing wildly. Now,
[01:19:16] they're going to have to have
[01:19:18] a 16 or higher just because of their
[01:19:23] uh Oh, wow. They shoot wildly with their
[01:19:27] gun and they hit you. They got lucky.
[01:19:30] Oof. They hit you for six. Lucifer, you
[01:19:33] turn around. They turn around to run and
[01:19:36] they start to sprint away. Do you want
[01:19:37] to shoot them in the back as they try to
[01:19:39] run
[01:19:42] away? They are slow at the moment
[01:19:44] because of the Yes. All right. So you're
[01:19:45] going to get a little extra being slow.
[01:19:47] Normally it would have been a a 15 14 to
[01:19:51] hit them. So you're going to make this
[01:19:52] actually because they were hit there.
[01:19:54] They're going to be a
[01:19:56] 12. Oh
[01:19:58] no, your gun
[01:20:01] jams. When you go to shoot damn
[01:20:04] wasteland dirt and pistols, you're gun
[01:20:08] jammed. And that guy goes running away.
[01:20:10] But as they run away, they're dropping
[01:20:13] so much stuff. They
[01:20:17] drop four pogs, which is our wasteland
[01:20:21] currency, and
[01:20:23] also a bunch of pistol ammo. So that
[01:20:26] you, my
[01:20:27] friend, brings you up to we're going to
[01:20:30] give
[01:20:31] you 15 rounds of pistol ammo and you got
[01:20:35] yourself four
[01:20:37] Pogs. There you go. Oh, no. These little
[01:20:40] guys just do not want to die. They do
[01:20:43] not want to die. They both turned and
[01:20:45] they ran backwards somewhere. I don't
[01:20:46] really know what's going on. Hey,
[01:20:50] JM. So, you guys are going to uh hang
[01:20:53] out again here. See if anybody else
[01:20:56] wants to uh participate in the little
[01:20:58] adventuring here. Let me grab a
[01:21:00] drink, my
[01:21:04] coffee, and we shall see what
[01:21:07] happens as you guys wander through the
[01:21:09] armory
[01:21:12] here. We got a person here in the
[01:21:14] beginning. Let's see. Uh, you know what?
[01:21:16] I probably should make like a dot to
[01:21:18] show where people
[01:21:24] are. Throw you at the door. All right.
[01:21:27] So, you try to run through that door.
[01:21:30] And being strong, we're going to say you
[01:21:32] need a uh a a seven or
[01:21:36] higher. Well, another natural 20 when
[01:21:39] you guys don't need
[01:21:42] it. Big
[01:21:44] BK, got yourself a murderers pack. I
[01:21:47] like
[01:21:52] it. You got yourself a murderers pack.
[01:21:55] Here you go, my friend.
[01:21:58] All right. And then you also have that
[01:22:00] thing again. You get to try out your
[01:22:01] your upgrade machine. You're trying
[01:22:04] you've been playing around with it,
[01:22:05] trying to learn it with your
[01:22:07] intelligence. Fix it every now and again
[01:22:09] when you get some chance to cuz that you
[01:22:10] know that's a pretty sweet little
[01:22:12] uh it's a pretty sweet upgrade machine
[01:22:15] you got
[01:22:16] there. Where'd it
[01:22:20] go? You got a pretty good sweet upgrade
[01:22:22] machine you found there. So you're
[01:22:24] trying to figure out how to use that.
[01:22:26] You break your way through the door
[01:22:28] there because our buddy breaks his way
[01:22:30] through. And the nice thing about that
[01:22:32] when he breaks his way
[01:22:35] through part of the wall breaks
[01:22:37] down. So that door stays open
[01:22:40] permanently now. No one can get in
[01:22:42] there. No one can shut that on you
[01:22:43] anymore. One, two, three, four, five,
[01:22:47] six, seven, eight. Because we like
[01:22:49] putting our spoilers the end. So big
[01:22:51] BK, you got that minor uh thing to
[01:22:54] upgrade. try to upgrade again if you
[01:22:56] want to. What I'm going to say here is
[01:22:59] I'm going to let you keep these and this
[01:23:02] time if you'd like or you this time
[01:23:03] since it worked last time on your uh on
[01:23:06] the other one you can try it with your
[01:23:09] flamethrower projector inspector. Good
[01:23:12] luck my friend. Bite down on crime. Fell
[01:23:14] his rage. Out cold. Cerebral

[01:23:21] watch. Cease in desist. Harry dronemith.
[01:23:26] Case of the Gorgon's kiss. Oh my.
[01:23:30] Congratulations. Under city sewers.
[01:23:33] Nice. Borderless buddy. We love those
[01:23:35] skrylands. And a cryptex on top of it
[01:23:39] with an airtight alibi foil. Full art on
[01:23:41] your island. and a token
[01:23:47] there. No, not bad at that
[01:23:53] pack.
[01:23:55] Um, I would have to check on that. I
[01:23:58] don't
[01:24:04] know. Let me I'd have to check on what I
[01:24:07] can do there. Um, for all of them
[01:24:10] together. I know that's a big pickup,
[01:24:12] buddy. The uh the borderless there. I
[01:24:16] didn't know it was 30. That's pretty
[01:24:18] sweet. You'd have to give me some time
[01:24:20] to figure out the pricing on those, but
[01:24:22] I can I can do that. Um maybe like uh a
[01:24:24] little bit
[01:24:25] later. Yeah, no problem. If you're
[01:24:27] looking for all of them and nonfoil, I
[01:24:28] have a good most of them, if not all of
[01:24:31] them. So, uh, what I'll do is I can, uh,
[01:24:34] if you give me a little bit of time here
[01:24:35] when I'm done at the end, I can get
[01:24:37] something together so I can have it in
[01:24:38] there like for tomorrow, like all of
[01:24:40] them together in the morning. Um, or
[01:24:43] maybe later tonight um, in the
[01:24:48] inventory. Yeah, but I just need to make
[01:24:50] sure what I have is correct. I don't
[01:24:52] want to say I have everything. I like to
[01:24:55] be sure and I have to go through a few
[01:24:56] things and that type of stuff. If that
[01:24:58] makes any sense.
[01:25:02] Yeah, I can do that. That's fine.
[01:25:03] Deionize. I can do that. I just want to
[01:25:05] make sure I like I have everything
[01:25:07] because I don't like when I don't
[01:25:09] Yeah. No, no worries. G, I can do that.
[01:25:11] I can do that. Deionize. Yeah, that's
[01:25:17] fine. So, you guys, you break out of
[01:25:21] there. Yeah, not a problem. I just I
[01:25:23] just like to make sure I'm 100% positive
[01:25:25] I have stuff. Especially that's why like
[01:25:27] I put all the singles like this. So,
[01:25:29] like when people are looking for
[01:25:30] singles, I can pull them out and like
[01:25:31] have them because they're all like
[01:25:33] alphabetized and I can know exactly
[01:25:34] where things are. You throw your
[01:25:36] flamethrower in there. All right, you
[01:25:38] throw your flamethrower in
[01:25:41] there. All right, let's try this out.
[01:25:43] Hopefully this doesn't blow up in my
[01:25:46] face. Now, you put the flamethrower in.
[01:25:49] And inside there, that flamethrower you
[01:25:51] see? Oh my. What happens? Your
[01:25:56] flamethrower, does it get upgraded? We
[01:25:58] don't know. We're going to check your
[01:26:00] dice roll. You have to have what is it?
[01:26:01] Seven or higher, right? Seven or higher,
[01:26:03] I think it is. Guys, you have luck. You
[01:26:06] have intelligence and engineering. Yes.
[01:26:07] Seven or higher. Let's do
[01:26:11] it. Oh my god.
[01:26:19] Big
[01:26:24] BK, the guy who the natural 20 last
[01:26:33] time is flamethrower. Big
[01:26:36] BK. So your flame Will just goes, did he
[01:26:39] lose his flamethrower? Will Will is kind
[01:26:43] of right. You don't your flamethrower
[01:26:45] there. It comes out after you uh put it
[01:26:48] in
[01:26:49] there. The flamethrower comes out and uh
[01:26:54] it it try you go to use it. It comes out
[01:26:58] and supposedly now it has a three round
[01:27:00] burst, but you go and you literally go
[01:27:03] to pick it
[01:27:05] up and as you pick it up, it starts to
[01:27:09] spark in flame where the canister is.
[01:27:14] a canister. The the the um canister is
[01:27:17] where all the fuel is. So, there's a
[01:27:19] hole. Remember everybody, there's a hole
[01:27:20] over in the corner of that room. I'd
[01:27:23] recommend throwing it. Oh, you're going
[01:27:25] to throw it at
[01:27:26] Halloween. I was going to say you can
[01:27:28] throw it in the hole in the side of the
[01:27:29] room there if you want. And hopefully uh
[01:27:31] you know, and that way it'll uh help uh
[01:27:35] dampen the
[01:27:39] blow. All right. You throw it in the
[01:27:41] hole there.
[01:27:43] The explosion occurs. You lose your
[01:27:45] weapon. And
[01:27:47] uh yeah, I'm sorry, my friend. That
[01:27:51] explosion though does draw the attention
[01:27:54] of one of the mediumsized raiders. He
[01:27:56] comes over that door that opened down
[01:27:57] the hallway there and stares at our
[01:28:01] buddy Halloween there with the door
[01:28:03] broke through the doorway there. Sees
[01:28:06] big BK throw had just blown something
[01:28:07] up. He's like, "What the is going on
[01:28:09] here?
[01:28:13] What is going
[01:28:14] on? Jokes's on you. I now have an open
[01:28:17] slot in my bag.
[01:28:21] All right, you guys going to decide now.
[01:28:23] What are you going to do here this
[01:28:24] morning? Oh, we'll go in again. Lucifer
[01:28:28] is going to Is he going to Lucifer is
[01:28:29] going to come and try and hang out with
[01:28:31] us and see if they what they get to uh
[01:28:34] have a little encounter here. Oh, you're
[01:28:36] gonna shoot at
[01:28:38] him. You're at work right now. Don't
[01:28:40] worry. A uh you guys have a mediumsized
[01:28:43] raider in front of you. So you shoot
[01:28:46] them. All right. Incendiary guy coming
[01:28:49] in and you hit them and they're 20 for
[01:28:52] their health and you hit them for uh
[01:28:54] Look at that. That's a nice big hit.
[01:28:56] That is 8 10 15. There you go. Hit them
[01:29:02] for 15 there. They go down to five
[01:29:05] health. And then our buddy there.
[01:29:09] Give it one second for a silver sneak.
[01:29:11] Jump in with the uh I don't know what
[01:29:13] happened there. It take a minute for
[01:29:15] that one to go and then uh you yourself
[01:29:18] get to uh Anybody else hanging out
[01:29:20] there? Going to throw the knives at him.
[01:29:22] All right. You picked up your knives
[01:29:24] from earlier. You throw them. Oh, this
[01:29:28] time you hit.
[01:29:33] Perfect. You hit with your throwing
[01:29:35] knives and look what happens. That
[01:29:38] mediumsized raider falls to the ground.
[01:29:42] Dead. Ah, look at that. Oh, thank you,
[01:29:44] Silver. Let's see what you get
[01:29:49] here. He does have a helm this time.
[01:29:52] Holy [ __ ] It's a
[01:29:54] miracle. All right, my friend. You I
[01:29:57] like it. You got yourself a nice Outlaws
[01:30:00] pack here. Let me grab one of
[01:30:02] those. And then with that, you also get
[01:30:05] yourself a side objective.
[01:30:09] I know. Finally, a good one. I know
[01:30:12] you've been asking for a helmet for a
[01:30:13] while, so I figured this time. Looks
[01:30:15] like he has a helmet on. So, that's all
[01:30:18] that's there. Hey, Gnome's rule. How's
[01:30:19] it going? You take out uh Nice to see
[01:30:22] you, buddy. So, you take the helmet.
[01:30:24] That's the only thing that's really on
[01:30:25] that one. So,
[01:30:27] Halloween grabs the uh metal helmet.
[01:30:31] Now, the metal helmet is not ready for
[01:30:34] you yet.
[01:30:36] We're going to have to uh you're going
[01:30:37] to have to get it a little bit adjusted
[01:30:39] because the because it's not not going
[01:30:41] to fit your uh your big
[01:30:42] head. All right. I mean, you you uh you
[01:30:45] got yourself a little bit bigger. So,
[01:30:46] you you need to have an adjustment to
[01:30:48] that helmet to fit
[01:30:49] you. All right. When it matters. I know.
[01:30:53] All right. Silver Sneak. We're going to
[01:30:55] open this up for you like we generally
[01:30:56] do. Um unless you don't want me to. Tell
[01:30:58] me no right now and we won't. But you,
[01:31:01] my friend, are one of the adventurers
[01:31:03] wandering around. You hear some things
[01:31:04] going on. some ruckus and you have to
[01:31:07] decide, do you want to wander into that
[01:31:08] armory where everybody else is hanging
[01:31:10] out there? Always open. All right, Cole
[01:31:12] Silver. I I thought so, but I just like
[01:31:14] to double check with
[01:31:17] people. No, not that I can think of.
[01:31:20] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[01:31:24] eight. Cuz I like putting the spoilers
[01:31:26] at the end. I can't think of having any
[01:31:29] of those that I can think of Gnome's
[01:31:31] rule. All right, here we go. Good luck.
[01:31:35] Corrupted Conviction, Skull Duggery,
[01:31:37] Vengeful Towns Folk, Peerless
[01:31:40] Ropemaster, Sterling
[01:31:42] Key, Quill Charger, Dance of the Tumble
[01:31:45] Weeds, Miriam, Herd, Whisper, Shepherd
[01:31:49] of the Clouds, Mobile Homestead, Bonnie
[01:31:52] Paul, Clear Cutter. Nice one there for a
[01:31:55] rare
[01:31:56] Repulse. Sterling Keyer for a foil,
[01:32:00] Cresote, Creoset.
[01:32:03] Uh, he I don't know if I'm saying that
[01:32:05] right. And then your Cactarantula
[01:32:10] Arcard. All right. I like it. So, you're
[01:32:12] not going to head over where they are.
[01:32:14] You're You see there's a bunch of
[01:32:16] buildings being burnt that were burnt
[01:32:17] out here in the
[01:32:20] city and you on the edge of that city
[01:32:24] were there hanging
[01:32:25] out. And Silver
[01:32:28] Sneak decides they were going to go
[01:32:31] sneak around a little bit more. And when
[01:32:32] they're sneaking around, they
[01:32:40] find where is
[01:32:49] it? They find this hanging out when
[01:32:53] they're
[01:32:57] wandering. Now, there could be something
[01:32:59] here if you want to dig it up.
[01:33:03] Or you could kind of just wander by and
[01:33:06] and let it go. It's up to
[01:33:09] you what you're doing. You stay
[01:33:13] outside. You going to grave rob it. All
[01:33:15] right. You go over and you like this
[01:33:16] looks like there could be something
[01:33:17] interesting here. Silver Sneak says. So
[01:33:20] Silver Sneak starts digging away. And as
[01:33:22] Silver Sneak
[01:33:24] digs, doesn't really hear something. And
[01:33:26] behind Silver
[01:33:29] Sneak out of a different area, crawls a
[01:33:32] feral ghoul. Oh no. Now this is a weak
[01:33:35] one. It is only a
[01:33:37] uh 10 health. You have a pistol and a
[01:33:42] knife when you start adventuring in the
[01:33:44] wasteland, Silver
[01:33:46] Sneak. So you, my friend, need to decide
[01:33:52] Do you want to attack that guy or do you
[01:33:54] want to
[01:33:55] run? Your pistol gives you a plus two
[01:33:57] for extended range damage and plus two
[01:34:00] for your knife for uh melee. You have
[01:34:04] nine
[01:34:10] bullets. Got yourself nine
[01:34:12] bullets. So you got that pistol there.
[01:34:14] You're going to shoot
[01:34:17] away. And then what we're going to do,
[01:34:19] I'm going to run another. If anybody
[01:34:21] else wants to jump in and hang out with
[01:34:22] us, try their pack out. Are you going to
[01:34:24] take a shot at it? I like it. You take a
[01:34:26] shot now with this pistol. You
[01:34:28] get It didn't roll. There you go.
[01:34:34] Is that in the middle? Another middle
[01:34:36] die. Wow. It keeps going in the
[01:34:39] middle. Well, there you go. You need it
[01:34:42] at 13 or higher because the pistol gives
[01:34:44] you plus two. That gives it 13. You hit
[01:34:46] it for one damage, though. Bringing it
[01:34:48] down nine to nine health. That fell
[01:34:51] ghoul whales and they swing at
[01:34:54] you. And lucky they missed. They needs
[01:34:57] to be a 13 or higher to hit
[01:34:59] you. You got lucky. What are you going
[01:35:01] to do, my
[01:35:02] friend? Anybody else want to jump in on
[01:35:04] this? They can. Here we go. Run some of
[01:35:06] these for all of
[01:35:08] you. You can take you got a couple more
[01:35:11] chances to do something here if you'd
[01:35:13] like. And we can see swap to the knife.
[01:35:17] All right. So you uh swap over to your
[01:35:21] knife and you swing away. Same thing.
[01:35:25] Plus two. Oh no. Is it an is it a middle
[01:35:29] one
[01:35:30] again? Oh my god. The dice does not want
[01:35:32] to land
[01:35:33] right.
[01:35:36] Uhoh. That's a one. That is a critical
[01:35:40] miss. No. That feral ghoul with that
[01:35:44] critical miss swings right at
[01:35:48] you. Oh my god, they critical miss too.
[01:35:51] You gota go what? Okay. Well, I was
[01:35:54] going to have you get hit by that guy,
[01:35:56] but both of you missed critically. And
[01:36:00] I've never seen that happen before at
[01:36:02] the same time. That's a That's crazy.
[01:36:04] So, we're going to have to try. Are you
[01:36:06] going to swing or you going to shoot?
[01:36:07] Because you both are kind of standing
[01:36:08] away from each other now that you
[01:36:10] missed. And you have one last
[01:36:11] opportunity here.
[01:36:13] And let's see if we can run some more.
[01:36:16] Swing again. Swing in with a knife.
[01:36:20] There you go. Hit him for five. Brings
[01:36:23] him down to four
[01:36:26] health. That ferro ghoul is at four
[01:36:28] health. They don't like what just
[01:36:30] happened. And
[01:36:34] they swing at you and they hit you for
[01:36:37] one, bring you down to 99 health. When
[01:36:41] that
[01:36:42] happens, they turn and they run cuz
[01:36:46] they've been hit too much and they don't
[01:36:47] like what's going on. They're just
[01:36:48] they're silly and they're injured, but
[01:36:50] they turn, they run, and they drop pogs.
[01:36:54] And that's our wasteland currency. So,
[01:36:55] you actually end up getting five Pogs in
[01:36:57] the
[01:36:58] wasteland. So, let's add that into your
[01:37:00] currency there. So, you can have those.
[01:37:02] And you have a pistol and a knife. Like
[01:37:04] I said before, when you start, now you
[01:37:06] only have eight rounds instead of nine.
[01:37:10] But here you go, my friend. As you
[01:37:16] wander, I know pogs don't I know. I
[01:37:19] found them a while back and we were
[01:37:21] like, you know what? Let's put them in
[01:37:22] the game and play with them. You know,
[01:37:23] it was one of those things like might as
[01:37:24] well might as well use them. So, let's
[01:37:26] see who wants to get us packs here. We
[01:37:28] have in there still is in there the um
[01:37:30] we have a we still have these in there.
[01:37:32] Monstrous in our commander deck. So,
[01:37:35] let's see what we got going on today.
[01:37:38] Yeah, kind of fun way to uh to do a
[01:37:41] break here, you know, get a little bit
[01:37:42] of extra going with it and uh not not
[01:37:45] just like the packs like some people,
[01:37:47] you
[01:37:47] know, instead of bottle caps, we use
[01:37:50] Pogs. Exactly.
[01:37:52] Yeah, it's easier. I didn't have I you
[01:37:55] know, I can I can get a chunk of Pogs,
[01:37:56] you know. I I can't get I don't have a
[01:37:57] bunch of bottle caps I can have unless
[01:37:59] I'm a alcoholic and I'm not an
[01:38:00] alcoholic.
[01:38:03] All right. So, you guys have been uh
[01:38:06] there's a few of you in that vault
[01:38:08] armory there. And then our other buddy
[01:38:10] just beat the feral
[01:38:11] ghoul by the uh that by that place he
[01:38:15] was digging into there, the unmarked
[01:38:18] grave. Ferro ghoul turned around there.
[01:38:21] You luckily got some stuff or soda. Oh,
[01:38:25] yeah. Some old sodas will do it, too.
[01:38:27] They don't do that as much anymore.
[01:38:29] You'll have to find older bottles to do
[01:38:31] it that
[01:38:32] way. All right. Oh, an infinity. I like
[01:38:35] it. Let's see what you get here, my
[01:38:37] friend. Good luck. And you have Oh, you
[01:38:39] found yourself an extra weapon when
[01:38:41] you're searching
[01:38:42] around. Look at that one. You're doing a
[01:38:44] good job. You're searching around that
[01:38:45] unmarked grave a little bit longer. And
[01:38:48] you find yourself, you get a choice of a
[01:38:50] plasma rifle, which is a range plus
[01:38:53] five. An assault rifle, which is a range
[01:38:55] plus three, but it does three shots.
[01:38:59] a sword, which is melee plus
[01:39:01] five, your pistol that you have already,
[01:39:04] and a knife. Now, the pistol and a knife
[01:39:06] can be um dual wielded if you would
[01:39:09] like. All right, good luck, my friend.
[01:39:11] Let's see what you get
[01:39:14] here. Silver sneak, let's get you some
[01:39:18] uh let's get you a nice lands. Want the
[01:39:20] sword? I like it. All right, here we go.
[01:39:22] Hatrick down for repairs. Wizards of the
[01:39:25] blank. A good day to pie. Park Map
[01:39:29] Alphag Guard. Big winner. Trigger Abby.
[01:39:33] Complaints clerk.
[01:39:36] Octoopus. Nocturno of Mirror's Marbles.
[01:39:39] Oh, nice one there. And then a swamp.
[01:39:43] That's a nice looking swamp there. I
[01:39:45] think that's one of the bigger swamps,
[01:39:46] too. Clown Extruder trivia
[01:39:50] contest. Then you get your token and
[01:39:53] your stickers at the end there.
[01:39:56] You going to take the sword? All right.
[01:39:58] So, you're digging around that grave and
[01:40:00] you happen to find under inside it this
[01:40:04] uh this sword that was there. You pick
[01:40:07] it up. Scream, "You have the power." As
[01:40:12] you lift it above your
[01:40:14] head. Now, you got a plus
[01:40:18] five to your
[01:40:20] uh roll whenever you have a melee
[01:40:23] attack.
[01:40:26] So, if something's going to be 17, that
[01:40:27] means you only need a
[01:40:31] uh 12 to hit it when you roll. So, there
[01:40:35] you go, my friend. That's a good pick up
[01:40:37] on that wandering around
[01:40:39] there, and then uh you know, you're
[01:40:42] wander, you're you're out there, you
[01:40:44] find that, and you turn around to see by
[01:40:48] you a medium s a small bug, I mean, in
[01:40:52] front of you. Now, that's only five for
[01:40:54] its damage and for its health, and it's
[01:40:56] only an a 12 for the uh the roll, but
[01:40:59] it's not really doing anything. Do what
[01:41:01] do you want to do? Do you want to leave
[01:41:02] it be or do you want to attack it? And
[01:41:05] then we'll see who wants to jump in and
[01:41:06] play a little bit more
[01:41:14] after. Now, once we get through, if you
[01:41:16] guys are hanging out here for a few
[01:41:18] days, we get to do this. What we do is
[01:41:20] we uh you guys actually get your own
[01:41:22] image. So like Big BK is currently
[01:41:24] that's Big BK's image. We got Halloween.
[01:41:27] That's their image for your character in
[01:41:28] the
[01:41:29] game. You do not have any food or
[01:41:31] anything like that. Hey TWWC, how's it
[01:41:33] going, my friend? Nice to see you.
[01:41:35] Hopefully you're having a good day.
[01:41:36] Hopefully the uh the morning the stream
[01:41:38] was
[01:41:41] good. You do not have any food. Hey, not
[01:41:44] how's it going, buddy? You do not have
[01:41:47] any food at the moment.
[01:41:49] Halloween. What did he miss? Well, our
[01:41:52] buddy um got a sword and they have a
[01:41:55] small bug in front of them at the
[01:41:56] moment. They're outside though. They're
[01:41:58] not in
[01:42:00] there. Oh. Ah,
[01:42:03] interesting. You know what? You hit
[01:42:06] them. You hit him for a decent hit. You
[01:42:07] know what? There's some blood and some
[01:42:09] broken pieces on the ground. You want to
[01:42:10] try to feed it to it? Is that what
[01:42:11] you're going to
[01:42:13] do? You guys are currently just hanging
[01:42:15] out in the Vaultorn Armory.
[01:42:18] Um, you know, you're you're there. You
[01:42:20] just made it out into the hallway. All
[01:42:22] right. You're gonna try to feed it to
[01:42:23] him. Yeah, little guy. You lean over,
[01:42:25] hand him some of
[01:42:26] that. He takes it, nibbles on it, spits
[01:42:30] it
[01:42:31] out, and just kind of stands there,
[01:42:34] looks at you a little bit
[01:42:36] more, and deciding to figure out what
[01:42:38] you want to do. What are you going to
[01:42:40] do? You going to attack
[01:42:42] it? You do need a workbench or someone
[01:42:45] to fix your helm. Oh, nice. Awesome.
[01:42:47] Awesome. Happy you always have a good
[01:42:49] one. Yeah, we had we had done stuff like
[01:42:51] that before and I'm happy that it's
[01:42:54] working out for you yourself. We uh
[01:42:57] Yeah, when the my business when I worked
[01:42:59] at my other job got a little headache
[01:43:01] with that and I backed off of some of
[01:43:02] this stuff. Not a problem Gy and Rosar.
[01:43:05] Yeah, I try to do a little fun with the
[01:43:07] breaks here once, you know, do a little
[01:43:09] bit more extra while we're hanging out
[01:43:10] while not make it a little boring. You
[01:43:12] know, make it a little more
[01:43:14] fun. You do need a workbench or
[01:43:16] something. to fix that
[01:43:22] helm. So, do you want to attack it or
[01:43:25] leave it alone and just see what
[01:43:26] happens? Cuz you fed it to him. He took
[01:43:29] took a little nibble and he spit it out.
[01:43:30] The bug there,
[01:43:33] silver waiting on what you wanted to
[01:43:42] do. All right, you leave it alone. Not a
[01:43:44] bad idea. You just leave it be.
[01:43:46] doesn't really do anything. Just kind of
[01:43:49] looks at
[01:43:50] you and you go wandering
[01:43:54] around the wasteland
[01:43:57] continuously. Uh oh, I got to fix the a
[01:43:59] doors banging here because we got some
[01:44:01] rays rocking. So, if we have some waves
[01:44:02] coming through, sorry about
[01:44:04] that if we lose some connection here.
[01:44:07] But here you go, everybody. We got that.
[01:44:09] All right, you decided to leave it
[01:44:10] alone. It goes wandering around kind of
[01:44:12] following you a little bit but from a
[01:44:13] distance
[01:44:15] away curious little creature. It
[01:44:19] is. All right, let's see if anybody else
[01:44:22] wants to jump in on our uh
[01:44:24] small secret our small auto box. TW It's
[01:44:27] only 25 spots in there. So, there's only
[01:44:29] 16 left of them. And there's still the
[01:44:33] uh we still have um some fun stuff in
[01:44:35] there. If you take a
[01:44:37] look, we have all a bunch of the
[01:44:39] different types of packs that you see
[01:44:41] here. There's also uh this and this in
[01:44:44] there. So, you got a couple nice things
[01:44:46] that are in there. So, we'll see what
[01:44:48] happens. Who's going to jump in and take
[01:44:51] over the character? Big BK says, "I'm
[01:44:54] ready to move further in the armory
[01:44:55] here,"
[01:44:57] says Big Bk.
[01:45:07] Why is that not going right now?
[01:45:14] The heck is going on here? Oh,
[01:45:16] Halloween. Thank you. I'll take a look
[01:45:19] quickly. Why is this not running?
[01:45:22] All right, there you go. Let me uh find
[01:45:25] what my phone is. I'll see if I can take
[01:45:27] a look at the message there.
[01:45:30] Big
[01:45:33] BK, what is going on? This is really
[01:45:35] going weird for a second.
[01:45:39] I know it's taking its time right there.
[01:45:42] It is acting very weird right now.
[01:45:50] I might have an unwinding clock.
[01:45:55] Yeah, I can do that for you. I can do
[01:45:56] something for you like that. Daddy,
[01:45:58] what's up? Your breakfast is served.
[01:46:00] Thank you. You can put it down right
[01:46:01] there actually next to my thing. I
[01:46:03] appreciate that.
[01:46:05] What is going on?
[01:46:07] I'm going to get you more coffee, daddy.
[01:46:12] Come
[01:46:13] on. All right. There we go. There you
[01:46:16] go. Uh, got yourself a modern horizon 3.
[01:46:19] And oh, look at that. You found some
[01:46:23] supplies. All right, buddy. When you're
[01:46:25] looking around, you have Altorn
[01:46:27] Armory. You end up finding uh in one of
[01:46:30] the
[01:46:33] corners, some food
[01:46:36] supplies and a bottle of
[01:46:42] whiskey. I I might have an unwinding
[01:46:44] clock. I have to double check. I It
[01:46:46] sounds familiar, but I don't know if I
[01:46:48] um have sold it recently. I pulled it
[01:46:50] out for someone. Take the whiskey. All
[01:46:52] right. You going to take the whiskey?
[01:46:54] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[01:46:58] and eight. There we
[01:47:00] go. Let's go
[01:47:02] here. Let's see what you get.
[01:47:05] Oop. Got a little flip card there of
[01:47:08] a giveaway. Let's see what you
[01:47:12] get. You have yourself. We're going to
[01:47:14] zoom in. We're going to zoom in. We got
[01:47:15] to zoom in. We got to see better. There
[01:47:16] we go. Sheltering landscape. Follow
[01:47:18] strike. Conduit goblin. Refurbished.
[01:47:21] Familiar inventor's axe. Unfallable
[01:47:23] truce, curse marauder, reckless
[01:47:26] pyrosurfer, horrid shadow spinner,
[01:47:29] unstable amulet, decree of
[01:47:33] justice, wrath of the skies in retro.
[01:47:38] Nice, buddy. With a sundering eruption
[01:47:40] foil, island foil, and a rat token.
[01:47:45] Yeah. Doing a little dungeon dragons
[01:47:46] thing here.
[01:47:49] Yeah, no problem. The baby
[01:47:52] So, what we do is we do like a little uh
[01:47:54] D and D type game where we play and roll
[01:47:57] around after we uh after you get your
[01:47:58] pack there. You're you get something
[01:48:00] having to do with it. For instance, uh
[01:48:02] our buddy Big
[01:48:03] BK found some food supplies just now for
[01:48:07] their character. I mean, and they took
[01:48:09] the
[01:48:10] whiskey. Now, Big BK knows what whiskey
[01:48:13] does. Whiskey returns your health to
[01:48:16] full because you really don't care about
[01:48:19] anything. You become strong and full.
[01:48:20] But the only problem is it drops off one
[01:48:23] um uh from your intelligence and one
[01:48:26] from your
[01:48:28] agility. Is it two? I have to double
[01:48:30] check. One or two from intelligence and
[01:48:32] and
[01:48:33] agility. You get a little D and D game
[01:48:35] here. Yeah, that's right. So, for
[01:48:37] instance, say if you want to jump in
[01:48:39] yourself, you can do
[01:48:41] that
[01:48:44] here. and my
[01:48:48] buddy do this. We'll do a little uh you
[01:48:52] guys get those wasteland things there.
[01:48:54] And uh you're wandering through your
[01:48:58] armory and where are you going to go in
[01:49:00] the armory there? Now you have a few
[01:49:02] different places you can try to head
[01:49:07] to. It gives you no
[01:49:13] made you permanently drunk.
[01:49:14] [Laughter]
[01:49:17] Yes. The room above you. All right. So,
[01:49:19] you go to the room above you where
[01:49:20] there's a All right. You head over that
[01:49:22] room above you and inside there there is
[01:49:25] a large
[01:49:27] raider. Like, I've been hearing some
[01:49:29] explosions and things going on. What's
[01:49:31] going on out there?
[01:49:46] What the heck just happened? Why did it
[01:49:48] go from one thing to another? That
[01:49:51] changed. The pack you got. Did you see
[01:49:54] that? The pack you got completely just
[01:49:56] changed
[01:49:58] there. Wow. Well, you ended up getting
[01:50:01] that
[01:50:02] instead. So, we'll have to switch
[01:50:05] them. That is so weird.
[01:50:12] Well, whatever you get, you're getting
[01:50:14] that and then it'll come up again, I
[01:50:17] guess. All right. So, you go in and with
[01:50:21] your sword to
[01:50:23] attack and you get a hit. Nice. He's a
[01:50:27] 17 and you have your nine on top of it.
[01:50:29] You hit him for 12 14 being a 30 that
[01:50:34] brings him down to 16
[01:50:36] health. Now, silver
[01:50:39] is coming in next
[01:50:42] with see it's also gave a different
[01:50:45] thing. Wow. That it it's like it was
[01:50:47] hanging or something for a minute
[01:50:49] there. The whole thing is different. But
[01:50:53] anyways Oh, buddy.
[01:50:56] Congratulations, Silver Sneak. You got
[01:50:58] the
[01:51:00] deck. You hit with your
[01:51:02] sword. All right.
[01:51:05] They're not happy. And they swing right
[01:51:07] back with their axe.
[01:51:11] Oh, it's in the middle. You got lucky.
[01:51:13] Come on, roll back.
[01:51:18] No. Oh, they hit you for five,
[01:51:24] eight. All right, they hit you for 10,
[01:51:26] but you have your Gatoradillo armor. And
[01:51:28] being melee, it's only a uh four six
[01:51:32] that it hits you with. So that brought
[01:51:34] brings you down to 80
[01:51:38] uh 86 for your
[01:51:42] health. All right. Then you have to
[01:51:44] decide what are you going to do now. And
[01:51:47] silver sneak. Look at that buddy.
[01:51:52] Congratulations. Let me get your name
[01:51:54] written down on
[01:51:56] that. Nice pickup, buddy.
[01:52:04] Let me write your name down.
[01:52:08] I don't know. A $10 commander deck.
[01:52:09] That's sweet.
[01:52:16] What up, buddy? You want more coffee?
[01:52:18] Uh, yeah. I'd appreciate that. Thank
[01:52:20] you. There you go, silver. Nice pickup,
[01:52:26] dude. I was wrong on which one that was.
[01:52:29] That's not that. That's that. Now we
[01:52:32] have our uh we still have our our This
[01:52:35] is still hanging out in there for those
[01:52:36] of you that may try that one there. Good
[01:52:38] morning, Frank. How's it going, my
[01:52:40] friend? You going to try to slice
[01:52:42] again? Try slicing again with your
[01:52:44] sword. And you hit him this time for
[01:52:48] four. I mean, that goes and brings him
[01:52:50] down to 11 health. And that large raider
[01:52:54] looks at you. Is there anybody else
[01:52:56] there helping? Seems like everybody's
[01:52:58] there. No one's there
[01:52:59] yet. So, no one's helping you. Slicing
[01:53:03] again. Hey, good morning, buddy. Slicing
[01:53:06] away again, I guess. Just you right now.
[01:53:09] Oh, look at that hit. You hit them
[01:53:13] for 12
[01:53:16] and they were at
[01:53:22] What were they at? He died. Yeah, he
[01:53:24] died.
[01:53:25] big
[01:53:26] guy takes a hit there. He doesn't have
[01:53:29] much on him, but what you do find on
[01:53:31] them, there is an axe.
[01:53:34] Where's the axe? You do find an axe on
[01:53:37] them. And you also find um a handful of
[01:53:41] pogs. They have uh you got a slammer on
[01:53:45] them. Actually, that fell. You got 11
[01:53:46] Pogs from them. Look at that, my
[01:53:49] friend. Oh, I'm throwing Pogs around
[01:53:51] right
[01:53:53] now. Yeah.
[01:53:58] All righty. Throwing that around right
[01:54:01] now.
[01:54:07] Yeah, he was at 11. Yep, he died.
[01:54:08] There's not in the room. That's what I
[01:54:10] was going to say. Yeah, we haven't uh I
[01:54:11] was just getting your stuff from them.
[01:54:13] So, you got 11 Pogs added on. Let me do
[01:54:16] that. You're at uh 71 Pogs.
[01:54:21] And you also have the axe if you want to
[01:54:24] pick it up. Now, in the room that you're
[01:54:26] looking around, you decide you want to
[01:54:28] look around the room there. You don't
[01:54:30] see much in that room, but there is a
[01:54:32] door that seems to uh lead to another
[01:54:36] area here. Do you want to try to try to
[01:54:38] get through the door? Would be your next
[01:54:40] thing. Oh, put it down right there. I
[01:54:41] appreciate it. Thank you. Might get a
[01:54:44] sugar rush. I put two scoops of sugar in
[01:54:47] because I thought it was more, but it
[01:54:49] was only half cup. Oh. Well, we'll see
[01:54:52] what happens. Thank you.
[01:55:03] Oh, yeah. Forgot about
[01:55:06] that. So, you're at uh 121.
[01:55:15] See, that's why you guys got to keep me
[01:55:17] honest here.
[01:55:27] eggs and
[01:55:28] uh steak. Steak and
[01:55:37] eggs. That's
[01:55:39] true. Forgot about
[01:55:42] that. Yes, it is a classic. Definitely a
[01:55:44] classic. But Silver
[01:55:49] Sneak. Now you're going to challenge
[01:55:52] Silver
[01:55:57] Sneak. Now you have to decide big BK if
[01:55:59] you want to break through one of those
[01:56:01] doors. Silver Sneak though, you find a
[01:56:05] workbench hanging around when you're
[01:56:09] outside and you have uh found some stuff
[01:56:12] hanging out there.
[01:56:15] Now, there is some scrap
[01:56:19] metal, some
[01:56:22] leather, and there is also a
[01:56:26] broken alien gatling gun hanging out.
[01:56:31] Now, what you need to
[01:56:34] do and decide is do you want to try to
[01:56:38] do something with that or just take it
[01:56:40] for spare
[01:56:42] parts and go
[01:56:55] Yeah, it
[01:57:00] works. Hey, it's all right. Uh, we're in
[01:57:04] the right now. Uh, Silver Sneak is
[01:57:08] deciding what to do. All right. So, you
[01:57:12] grab everything. So, you did the ali
[01:57:14] broken alien gatling gun, the uh the
[01:57:17] leather and the metal.
[01:57:24] You could have uh tried to invent
[01:57:27] something with that, put it together,
[01:57:29] but not a good idea to take it. I mean,
[01:57:31] that was a good idea to take that stuff.
[01:57:33] So, let me get you in your loot
[01:57:36] area. Add in alien gat.
[01:57:42] Then you have metal and you have
[01:57:44] leather. That way if you end up coming
[01:57:46] into contact with any of our uh you know
[01:57:50] storage of our storage vendor, maybe
[01:57:52] maybe this the lock room. I don't know
[01:57:54] any of those guys that are the safe
[01:57:55] havens, they might be able to help
[01:57:58] you. That was a good idea. That was a
[01:58:01] good idea. All right, who's coming in
[01:58:03] now? We just had a uh deck given away.
[01:58:06] Commander deck given away for uh $9
[01:58:10] there. Who's up next to see where they
[01:58:13] go in the
[01:58:19] wasteland? Ah, that was only supposed to
[01:58:22] be 30
[01:58:26] seconds.
[01:58:28] Gives me a little longer to eat.
[01:58:38] Ah, all right.
[01:58:43] see who wants to uh pick up and help out
[01:58:46] our friends here or become part of the
[01:58:51] wasteland. And after you hang up after
[01:58:54] you hang out for a few days, what we
[01:58:57] like to do is
[01:58:59] uh when you become a regular, we make a
[01:59:02] character image for
[01:59:06] you. If you guys had those images
[01:59:12] now. Oh, try to do that as possible. You
[01:59:15] could have tried
[01:59:23] that. Whatever my wife give
[01:59:26] me for the coffee
[01:59:30] Halloween, I think we've had stuff from
[01:59:33] uh Virgin Islands. We've had stuff from
[01:59:36] Puerto Rico. We've had stuff from here.
[01:59:39] Just whatever it is. She gets like these
[01:59:41] random ones to try out all the
[01:59:43] time. Lucifer. All
[01:59:46] right. So,
[01:59:50] we have to do
[01:59:55] this. Actually have a new box that we
[01:59:57] need to open. Because of that, you're
[02:00:00] going to get to pick where we go.
[02:00:05] And as you scavenge
[02:00:10] around Oh, that's kind of cool. Get
[02:00:12] coffee from all around the world. That's
[02:00:14] pretty sweet. Yeah, we weren't living on
[02:00:15] the We get coffee from all around the
[02:00:17] world because we travel on our boat all
[02:00:19] around. So, we get to go and see the
[02:00:21] places and stuff like that. So, that's
[02:00:22] why we kind of like I like getting the
[02:00:24] different coffees all over and see what
[02:00:25] their coffees are like, you
[02:00:26] know? We've had Bahamas coffee, Bahamas,
[02:00:31] Virgin Islands, and stuff like that.
[02:00:33] Yes. All right, Lucifer, where would you
[02:00:36] like to go here, my friend? In our uh
[02:00:40] merge at Carlo Manor and then on top of
[02:00:42] it, you were scavenging
[02:00:46] around with those in that wasteland room
[02:00:49] back there. When they all left, you went
[02:00:50] and then looked in the
[02:00:52] hole that was exploded from the uh from
[02:00:55] the gun there from that uh from the bad
[02:00:58] upgrade. And inside of that hole, you
[02:01:02] intelligently you go and you find Oh.
[02:01:04] Oh. Oh, no. Don't
[02:01:07] drop. You find
[02:01:11] 20 five
[02:01:13] pogs in the
[02:01:15] wasteland, which means you're going to
[02:01:17] have some currency there to be able to
[02:01:20] buy some
[02:01:22] things from vendors or uh maybe trade
[02:01:25] with other people. And you're going to
[02:01:27] go third one down in the middle. One,
[02:01:29] two,
[02:01:30] three. There we go, my
[02:01:35] friend. And here. So, you got that
[02:01:38] choice. And I'm going to zoom in here a
[02:01:40] little bit so we can see a little better
[02:01:41] on our opening. And let's get to this
[02:01:43] track bear, my friend. And you guys get
[02:01:46] to decide my little whaleo whaleo. Let's
[02:01:49] try it. One, two, three, four, five,

[02:02:59] We had the last pack of the other box
[02:03:01] had a big hit and the first pack of this
[02:03:03] box has a big
[02:03:05] hit. Hey, that
[02:03:10] MTG. Oh, well, we got it. Well, it's in
[02:03:12] the uh it's in

[02:03:25] good land. I know. That's a nice
[02:03:30] hit.
[02:03:35] Luciferero. All
[02:03:40] right. There you go,
[02:03:43] Lucifer. There you go. Now you're going
[02:03:45] in there. You you've been scavenged the
[02:03:47] pogs. Believe you're in the armory with
[02:03:50] everyone. So being in the army there,
[02:03:52] you scavenge the
[02:03:54] pogs. We don't really have anybody
[02:03:56] coming around yet.
[02:03:58] But you know how that that hole blew uh
[02:04:01] that blew a wall blew a hole in the wall
[02:04:03] there? One of the small raiders pokes
[02:04:05] his head through the
[02:04:07] wall. Loose furrow. What are you going
[02:04:10] to do?
[02:04:16] You got a pistol and a
[02:04:21] knife. That was you. No, no, no. The
[02:04:24] explosion was uh Big
[02:04:27] BK. Oh, yeah. I like it. Before you can
[02:04:30] alert anybody, you lean over to stab.
[02:04:39] Well, look at
[02:04:40] that. You got him. You need a 14 or
[02:04:43] higher on a little guy. Got a 12 plus
[02:04:45] your two and your three. You stab him.
[02:04:48] And that was the weak guy already. So he
[02:04:51] actually ends up the one that was
[02:04:53] stabbed in the neck
[02:04:54] earlier. He actually falls the
[02:05:04] ground. Yeah. They blew a hole. So you
[02:05:07] hit him. You stabbed
[02:05:09] him. Now he's bleeding out on the other
[02:05:12] side. They're going to get We're going
[02:05:14] to have to give them a
[02:05:16] uh six or higher. They'll be able to
[02:05:19] escape here.
[02:05:21] Eight. I mean, I'm not a six or higher.
[02:05:23] The off 12 or higher. Sorry. 12 or
[02:05:25] higher. They have to escape. They do not
[02:05:26] escape. They fall the ground. They're
[02:05:28] bleeding on the other side of the
[02:05:29] hole. And they bleed out on the other
[02:05:32] side. Now, you can't get to that yet.
[02:05:33] You might have to walk around to check
[02:05:35] that guy later, but right now you're
[02:05:38] standing there in that doorway. The one

[02:06:07] buildings here. and uh in the process of
[02:06:11] burning them out. I'm looking through

[02:06:54] there. Now, you though, my friend,
[02:06:57] Silver
[02:06:58] Sneak, you decided you didn't want to go
[02:07:00] in
[02:07:01] there. You wanted to hang outside with
[02:07:03] everybody.
[02:07:05] You'd found that workbench
[02:07:07] before. You salvaged some things there.
[02:07:11] And then on top of it, you're looking
[02:07:12] around that uh you're looking around
[02:07:14] that workbench
[02:07:15] area. And you also find a few other
[02:07:20] things. You find an old axe that is uh
[02:07:25] needs to be
[02:07:27] repaired. You also
[02:07:30] find a uh where does it go?
[02:07:38] Where'd he go? Oh, that's I'm not in the
[02:07:40] right
[02:07:43] area. You also find some food
[02:07:48] supplies. What would you like to
[02:07:51] do? I mean, you can take the axe. You
[02:07:53] have up to seven inventory roll uh spots
[02:07:56] you can have when you uh start out here.
[02:08:02] Neat
[02:08:04] silver. So, you have to decide you want
[02:08:06] to do anything with
[02:08:07] those. You're looking around
[02:08:14] there. How many spots do you have left?
[02:08:17] All right. You have one, two spots that
[02:08:19] you have taken by the pistol and the
[02:08:20] knife. And that's it. You only have a
[02:08:23] pistol and a knife. So, that means you
[02:08:25] have five spots left.
[02:08:29] Oh no, you you picked up the in you
[02:08:31] picked up the other stuff. Leather and
[02:08:33] metal for some reason it didn't copy
[02:08:34] over. It was putting a You got the alien
[02:08:36] g metal and leather also which is three.
[02:08:40] So you got five. You got two spots left.
[02:08:41] I'm sorry. I forgot to add those in. Two
[02:08:42] spots
[02:08:46] left. The food and the axe. Oh, the bug
[02:08:50] is still nearby.
[02:08:54] So, you take the
[02:08:56] axe, put the axe in uh in your
[02:09:00] inventory. I like it. Add the axe to the
[02:09:05] inventory. Now, the axe is broken, so
[02:09:08] you're going to need to uh fix that one
[02:09:14] up. All right. So, you uh you take some
[02:09:17] of that food that you find. You find
[02:09:20] some food there. gives you uh two
[02:09:22] different two rations, but you take one
[02:09:23] of those
[02:09:25] rations and that bug that's been kind of
[02:09:28] following you around when you try to
[02:09:29] give it something before comes over,
[02:09:32] nibbles on the
[02:09:35] rations and uh actually eats it. Then he
[02:09:39] stays there and he nudges your leg. A
[02:09:41] little small, kind of like a Chihuahua
[02:09:45] size. Nudges your leg. Maybe it wants
[02:09:47] more. Seems like it may want some more.
[02:09:56] What are we doing? Lucifer, I mean
[02:09:58] sneak. Silver
[02:10:07] sneak. Hey, Booper. How's it going, my
[02:10:10] friend? Haven't seen you in a
[02:10:13] bit. Ah, you give it the other ration. I
[02:10:15] like it. So, you look at it and you go,
[02:10:17] "Ah, I like this." Well, hey buddy. I
[02:10:20] got another ration for you. And that
[02:10:23] small bug comes up and takes a ration
[02:10:25] out of your hand, eats a ration, and
[02:10:28] then starts uh rubbing up on your leg
[02:10:30] like a
[02:10:33] cat. Seems like you may have a friend
[02:10:35] now. I'm I'm good. I think I'm alive,
[02:10:39] too. Hey, holding my holding my groin.
[02:10:41] How's it been? Nice to see you coming
[02:10:43] in. You made a friend. I know.
[02:10:55] I'm just letting you
[02:10:57] know things happen.
[02:10:59] Monster, so you never know what happens
[02:11:02] later on. Just going to say this is just
[02:11:06] the beginning. You know, just maybe made
[02:11:08] a friend. He's there. He's trying to get
[02:11:10] food. You know, it's the second time he
[02:11:12] made some friend. He gave him some food.
[02:11:14] Who knows what could happen?
[02:11:20] We're going to run it again here. We're
[02:11:22] going to run the next one and we're
[02:11:23] going to see what happens. See where we
[02:11:25] go here. We still have uh 12 spots left
[02:11:27] in that uh monstrous magazine. Secret
[02:11:30] layer is still in there surprisingly. So
[02:11:32] there you go. I don't know where BK
[02:11:35] went. They were in they BK was here
[02:11:36] before, but um they might have headed
[02:11:38] out. They I know they had picked up some
[02:11:40] stuff from our from our armory here and
[02:11:43] they were in one of the other rooms that
[02:11:44] they had they had fought one of the
[02:11:46] large raiders and uh got some fun things
[02:11:48] there. But now uh we're waiting on what
[02:11:50] Big BK is doing if they're hanging out
[02:11:52] still. They just uh wandered away. You
[02:11:54] know, it's late for them. They stay up
[02:11:55] all night. So Big BK might be actually
[02:11:57] falling asleep here now. You know what I
[02:11:58] mean?
[02:12:01] Why do they stay up all night? They're a
[02:12:03] night they're a night person. Oh,
[02:12:05] they're in uh on the other side of the
[02:12:06] country, too.
[02:12:09] Yeah, that makes no sense. But yeah, it
[02:12:13] does make a little bit of sense. So,
[02:12:14] yeah, you guys
[02:12:15] are So, you got your little bug friend
[02:12:18] there. He's buzzing around, wandering
[02:12:20] around next to
[02:12:21] you. And then we're going to have uh

[02:12:43] going to be here like Monday or Tuesday
[02:12:44] next week. They put it on like the wrong
[02:12:45] truck or something. We paid like a
[02:12:47] two-day freight and we're getting like
[02:12:49] two week freight. So, I did reach out
[02:12:52] and be like, "Hey, is there anything you
[02:12:52] can guys do?" Because we paid like a lot
[02:12:54] of money for the freight here. Uh, like
[02:12:57] talk to the company or something. So,
[02:12:58] I'm hoping we get a little refund. That
[02:13:00] would be

[02:20:37] You're you hear a little bit of ruckus
[02:20:38] going
[02:20:40] on and you're wandering. You see that
[02:20:42] this little you see a vault armory over
[02:20:44] here and you don't know what it is at
[02:20:46] the moment. You're just you're new. You
[02:20:48] have a pistol and you have a knife, my
[02:20:49] friend.
[02:20:51] Booper. Now, with that pistol and a
[02:20:53] knife, you wander around and you have to
[02:20:55] make a decision. You want to go to the
[02:20:56] Vaultorn Armory or would you like to
[02:21:01] uh All right. All right, we can do that.
[02:21:04] We can do that. We use the scrap metal.
[02:21:06] Make it a little nicer. All right, we
[02:21:07] can do that. So, Booper, would you like
[02:21:10] to go and investigate that uh vault or
[02:21:12] would you like to stay outside and
[02:21:13] investigate around
[02:21:15] outside? You don't really know what's
[02:21:17] going on in there yet because
[02:21:20] uh you are uh you know, you're not in
[02:21:23] the vault, but you can see kind of the
[02:21:24] things going on outside. You can hear a
[02:21:26] ruckus. So, you got to decide the ruckus
[02:21:28] you're going to do.
[02:21:40] investigate the outside. I like it. So,
[02:21:42] you go, you start investigating outside.
[02:21:46] I'm going to run this for a few uh
[02:21:47] minute here while we do our
[02:21:48] investigating outside. You investigate
[02:21:50] outside. And as you investigate outside
[02:21:53] there, you're looking around. Oop. You
[02:21:55] look uh Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.
[02:21:57] You're looking around that burnt out
[02:21:58] buildings there.
[02:22:00] And one of the things you happen to
[02:22:02] find, you
[02:22:05] find you in one of those buildings, you
[02:22:07] find this drone on the ground. A rustorn
[02:22:09] drone. Not sure what it is. What do you
[02:22:11] want to
[02:22:14] do? And remember, there's a bunch of
[02:22:16] packs in there for those that are left.
[02:22:17] Starting out at a dollar for those that
[02:22:19] want to try and uh jump in the
[02:22:25] adventure. All righty. Going to take
[02:22:27] that. All right. You're going to go grab
[02:22:28] that drone and as you go reach down to
[02:22:30] grab it, it sparks and
[02:22:32] starts. It's only a five health. You've
[02:22:35] got a pistol and knife.
[02:22:37] Booper. Do you want to try to attack
[02:22:40] this thing and take it
[02:22:44] down? Looks like it might have been uh I
[02:22:47] don't know, resting. I don't know. You
[02:22:49] are at 100 health and you got your
[02:22:51] pistol and your knife, which has nine
[02:22:52] rounds of ammo with a pistol.
[02:22:59] All right, knife it. We're going to
[02:23:01] knife it. You use that knife and swing.
[02:23:05] Oh, look at that. You kill it. You swing
[02:23:07] as it's starting to take out that take
[02:23:09] off in
[02:23:10] midair. You swing at that rustorn drone,
[02:23:13] knocking it back down, chopping one of
[02:23:15] its uh propellers off, and you now have
[02:23:18] a Rustorn drone in your inventory.
[02:23:25] All right, you got one of those drones.
[02:23:26] Who knows what's going to come in
[02:23:27] helpful later? I don't know. Now, let's
[02:23:30] see what we get for single packs coming.

[02:24:43] scavenging
[02:24:45] here. You're finding some supplies
[02:24:47] again. And uh when you're in that same
[02:24:50] area, you find some
[02:24:52] food and some scrap
[02:24:55] metal. You're going to take that screw

[02:25:24] mean food and scrap metal. Thank you,
[02:25:26] William. You're welcome.
[02:25:31] Scrap metal. And you also get a
[02:25:34] ration. All right. You now have a ration
[02:25:36] and some scrap
[02:25:39] metal. Your helm. That's what we're
[02:25:42] Wait, we got to work on that. That's why
[02:25:43] I got to get Yeah, we got to get that
[02:25:44] figured
[02:25:47] out. Hold on a second. Let's do that
[02:25:50] here.
[02:26:11] All right, let's see.
[02:26:28] All right, we'll get to that lag. We're
[02:26:32] good. All right. Boop. So, you're
[02:26:35] picking up some of that stuff there
[02:26:37] while you're looking around and and all
[02:26:39] of a sudden you have a Oh,
[02:26:42] well, this is not a nice looking bug.
[02:26:45] Two medium-sized bugs come charging
[02:26:47] towards you to attack. They are not
[02:26:50] friendly. They're getting ready to
[02:26:53] attack. Now you have a pistol and a
[02:26:55] knife. What do you like to
[02:26:59] do? All right. I like it. I like
[02:27:02] it. You going to knife them? All right.
[02:27:05] So, you go with a knife for the first
[02:27:09] one. Oh, look at that. 20. A natural
[02:27:14] 20. This is what we're going to do. I
[02:27:16] like this. You hit that first
[02:27:19] medium-sized bug, killing it. All right.
[02:27:23] But as you see, it's glowing a little
[02:27:24] bit. When you hit it and you kill it,
[02:27:26] you notice it starts to uh glow a little
[02:27:28] bit
[02:27:29] more. As it glows, it gets brighter. And
[02:27:31] then finally, it pops, blows up, and the
[02:27:34] one sitting next to it gets a little bit
[02:27:35] of a kind of like a acid on it, and it
[02:27:38] starts to uh die. And it goes down from
[02:27:40] its 10 health down to five health
[02:27:43] because that critical hit, my friend.
[02:27:45] Look at that.
[02:27:47] And it does not get tack again. Are you
[02:27:48] going to knife it another time?
[02:28:02] That one. Uh, yeah. Okay.
[02:28:10] Yeah. All right. We're going to attack
[02:28:11] it again. Let's do it.
[02:28:14] Oh, you Oh, wait. No, it's it's fine
[02:28:16] because you get plus two. Wait, no, it
[02:28:19] isn't because this is not a 10. This is
[02:28:20] a 12. The 13 one. You have to hit it
[02:28:22] with 13. So, you missed it.
[02:28:25] But that bug is very unhappy cuz it's
[02:28:29] got starting to burn on its side. It
[02:28:30] attacks you. Oh, it needs a 13 to hit
[02:28:33] you and it doesn't. It misses too cuz of
[02:28:34] the injured. I'm guessing you swing one
[02:28:36] more time at it, right? So, I'm going to
[02:28:38] go and we're going to roll with your
[02:28:40] third swing. Seeing if it helps.
[02:28:44] Oh my, you missed a third time. And then
[02:28:47] this time it tries to bite you, but it
[02:28:49] hits.
[02:28:51] Oh no. Boop. Now it's not. It's damaged
[02:28:54] there a little bit. So it doesn't get a
[02:28:56] full amount of damage to you. So it only
[02:28:58] brings you down 98 health to 98 health.
[02:29:01] And you got rad poisoning though. That's
[02:29:03] the thing though. You got some rad
[02:29:05] poisoning. Boop. Oh no, my friend. Let's
[02:29:09] run this again if anybody wants to jump
[02:29:10] in and hang out with us. You got some
[02:29:12] rad poisoning. That is not good. All
[02:29:15] right. Now, let me do this. And here is
[02:29:17] our
[02:29:19] helm for our friend here. Um, Halloween.
[02:29:33] Halloween. All right, let's see. Here is
[02:29:36] your helm. Halloween.
[02:29:47] take some time to render them. That's
[02:29:50] your helm. Halloween.
[02:30:04] There you go. Get yourself a helmet.
[02:30:08] That is with a scrap metal. Cuz without
[02:30:10] the scrap metal, you wouldn't have had
[02:30:11] the face
[02:30:13] plate. The scrap metal gave you the
[02:30:15] face. Cuz the guy,
[02:30:17] remember, our mediumiz raider had
[02:30:19] nothing covering his
[02:30:24] face. Yes. Uhhuh.
[02:30:28] I see Halloween's going to get it.

[02:33:36] can't carry as much. You need a
[02:33:37] backpack. You can make a backpack.
[02:33:39] Exactly. Our buddy Big BK
[02:33:42] did. You can make a backpack. That's
[02:33:44] right. Big BK made a backpack. He had
[02:33:46] somebody make him a backpack the other
[02:33:48] day. He actually took the leather that
[02:33:50] he got and he went over to I think it
[02:33:53] was our hidden door
[02:33:55] friend
[02:33:57] spam which made them uh some a leather
[02:34:00] bag if I remember right.

[02:34:25] going to set up another one of our
[02:34:28] brakes
[02:34:29] here, but I'm going to set it up
[02:34:34] with a
[02:34:37] new 25 of them. So, let's do this with a
[02:34:41] new 25.
[02:34:54] We're going to put
[02:34:59] in that.
[02:35:12] All right.

[02:37:03] ass. All right. Why won't it let me copy
[02:37:06] things? All
[02:37:22] right.
[02:37:24] Sorry. Why is it not doing these things?
[02:37:28] All right. So, today it looks like it's
[02:37:30] not letting me add in stuff
[02:37:32] continuously. Why does it keep doing
[02:37:33] that?
[02:37:35] H tech problems.
[02:37:39] Always tech problem. Always a tech
[02:37:41] problem. Always a tech problem. I'm
[02:37:44] trying to add it
[02:37:47] [Music]
[02:37:51] in. All right, there we go. That might
[02:37:53] be better
[02:38:00] now. Let me try it now.
[02:38:14] Okay, let's try that now. Let's see if
[02:38:16] it works then.
[02:38:34] will work now. Ah, all right. Here we
[02:38:36] go.
[02:38:38] We'll try that again. All right. We
[02:38:39] added we we made a new one. All
[02:38:42] right. So, we're going to run our new
[02:38:45] one. Our new one which has in there uh
[02:38:47] you can look at it what it has. This is
[02:38:49] what I got to do though. I'm going to
[02:38:50] run it for a few minutes cuz I got to go
[02:38:52] and use the bathroom to go to the
[02:38:53] bathroom and be. So, I'm going to run
[02:38:55] this along with a
[02:38:58] giveaway for the same time frame. And
[02:39:01] there we go. We're going to run that
[02:39:02] with a giveaway at the same time for the
[02:39:05] new one. And you guys can go and look at
[02:39:06] what's in there. And I'm going to go
[02:39:08] just use the restroom quickly.
[02:39:17] You used a new show? Nope. And there we
[02:39:20] go. All right. I'm going to be back in
[02:39:22] uh in one second there. Going step away.
[02:39:26] Be right back.
[02:39:43] Who's that?
[02:40:03] Look at that
[02:40:04] beauty. It tastes delicious.
[02:40:24] Okay, now I'll throw it all up.
[02:41:07] I think
[02:41:15] everything my friends
[02:41:23] Then we're going to
[02:41:35] No, what
[02:41:50] And I
[02:42:01] will replace
[02:42:39] All righty. We be back.
[02:42:46] Yes, it
[02:42:47] is. Yes, it's it's supposed to be 10. It
[02:42:50] was The only reason I had dropped it
[02:42:51] down to one was the two big hits were
[02:42:52] taken out. The two uh like the the the
[02:42:55] commander deck and the um other thing
[02:42:56] was taken out. So, that's why um I
[02:43:00] dropped down. It was just the packs that
[02:43:01] were left. That's why I put it at one
[02:43:03] and ran in a couple of them. Now I put
[02:43:04] the com uh now I put back in
[02:43:07] uh we have a a new 25 and they have
[02:43:10] everything all the packs and then you
[02:43:12] also have a secret layer in there and a
[02:43:13] collector booster that's in that. So
[02:43:15] that's what's set up that way. That's
[02:43:16] why I kind of do it. Uh that's how I try
[02:43:18] to do it at
[02:43:22] least. Yeah. That way it's like a you
[02:43:26] get some packs or you could get what you
[02:43:28] see in there is
[02:43:30] uh you got some collector you got a
[02:43:33] drift collector. You got Modern Horizon
[02:43:34] 3 play boosters. You have jump start
[02:43:37] booster. You have infinity. You have
[02:43:39] also it looks like
[02:43:42] uh what one did I put in
[02:43:45] there? The secret layer. What? And
[02:43:48] there's a uh Marvel Black Panther secret
[02:43:51] layer. Oh, I always wash my hands. I
[02:43:54] make sure of that because that's one of
[02:43:55] the things that So, I used to work at a
[02:43:58] job with people from all around the
[02:43:59] world.
[02:44:01] Um many different countries. It was tech
[02:44:05] job. One of my largest pet peeves
[02:44:08] was um some cultures don't wash their
[02:44:13] hands when they go to the bathroom. They
[02:44:15] leave the bathroom and then sometimes
[02:44:17] like I understand like using the hand
[02:44:19] sanitizer and everything, but now every
[02:44:21] [ __ ] thing you touch before you get
[02:44:23] back to your desk has your penis on
[02:44:26] it. I don't want to touching your penis
[02:44:29] on every [ __ ] door handle. So that
[02:44:31] means every time you go out, you're
[02:44:32] going to touch your penis again because
[02:44:34] you have to grab the door handle. So why
[02:44:36] don't you clean them first or like bring
[02:44:38] it with you so you use it in the
[02:44:40] bathroom? That was my only problem that
[02:44:42] I ever had with some of these
[02:44:46] people. That's the only problem I had
[02:44:48] with some people from other other parts
[02:44:50] of the world. That's that's that's the
[02:44:52] only thing was the the the the hand
[02:44:54] cleaning thing cuz you touch all the
[02:44:55] door handles going out and I'm like that
[02:44:58] means I now need to touch that. I don't
[02:45:01] want to touch that. I don't want to
[02:45:02] touch
[02:45:03] that. All right. You're going to go with
[02:45:06] number eight. All right. I like it. One,
[02:45:09] two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[02:45:11] eight, nine. Oh, I think a rare was
[02:45:13] taken out of there. So, I got to do
[02:45:15] this. Give me a second. It
[02:45:18] was like I like I have a lot of friends
[02:45:21] that are foreign and I've never had
[02:45:22] problems with that. Was just a couple
[02:45:23] people that I worked with and I was
[02:45:24] like, "Oh my
[02:45:29] god. Let's
[02:45:33] see. Let's see. Let's see. Is that why
[02:45:36] you like working from home?" Uh, that is
[02:45:38] part of the reason why I liked working
[02:45:40] from
[02:45:43] home cuz I never needed to worry about
[02:45:45] that stuff.
[02:45:49] You know, you don't need to care about
[02:45:51] that when it's uh when there's nothing
[02:45:53] wrong. All right, we're going to put our
[02:45:54] rare in. You said number
[02:46:00] eight. One, two, three, four, five, six,
[02:46:03] seven, and eight. Let's see. And then
[02:46:05] I'm going to get your pack opened. You
[02:46:07] got an iron
[02:46:08] verdict. I'll put that with your other
[02:46:11] stuff.
[02:46:13] Halloween. And then booper.
[02:46:16] coming in with the AA. Let's see what
[02:46:18] you get there, my friend. You found a
[02:46:21] side objective pops up. All right. Ah,
[02:46:26] boop. We like side
[02:46:28] objectives. All right. Let's see what
[02:46:30] happens with the side objective. We have
[02:46:32] a Gata Gilded God. I mean gilded go

[02:46:52] world tyrant actually haven't seen that
[02:46:54] one agon agnosar rex ah nice I haven't
[02:46:58] actually seen that in that version but
[02:46:59] nice on the dino there in a pywood gear

[02:47:06] there, mythic Gearhulk artifact there,
[02:47:09] and a cursed cloth wrappings for a
[02:47:12] foil and another rare there in the end
[02:47:15] with a dismal backwater foil and your R
[02:47:18] card of demonic junker. Nice
[02:47:21] [Music]
[02:47:23] pickup. There's uh there's some decent
[02:47:25] ones in there. Um the
[02:47:27] the I think the Gear Hulk may have been
[02:47:30] your big hit, but Agnosaurus Dinos are
[02:47:33] always I like dinos. I'm biased on that,
[02:47:34] but dinos are always
[02:47:37] nice. Now,
[02:47:40] Boop, you uh you you got your sing you
[02:47:43] get your packs here, your single, your
[02:47:45] singles, and this is what happens. But
[02:47:48] boop, you're wandering around, you're
[02:47:50] new, when you're in that uh wandering
[02:47:52] those burnt out
[02:47:55] buildings, and
[02:48:00] um you bump into
[02:48:05] Nope, not that
[02:48:11] one. Where is
[02:48:13] it? There you
[02:48:15] go. You run into this guy now.
[02:48:21] Boop. He could be mean, could be a
[02:48:25] friend. You're not really sure
[02:48:28] yet. Boop. But he's hanging out there in
[02:48:32] front of you.
[02:48:34] cuz you uh you guys are just kind of
[02:48:35] wandering the same way. He's wandering
[02:48:37] towards you in that little in that uh
[02:48:39] burnt out town there that you're in.
[02:48:45] You want to attack or do you want to try
[02:48:46] to see what else is going on with them?
[02:48:49] That's a clumsy.
[02:48:52] Nope.
[02:48:55] That's a desert bandit.
[02:48:58] All right, Boop. You must make a
[02:49:00] decision.
[02:49:04] And what I'll do is I'm going to run
[02:49:05] this for uh a minute and a half. That
[02:49:08] way we can uh see what you do
[02:49:11] here and we'll
[02:49:13] go. All right. Give you an idea. Give
[02:49:16] you a chance to decide if you want to
[02:49:18] you want to talk to them. Do you want to
[02:49:19] attack them? What do you want to do?
[02:49:20] Boop. You have the desert bandit handing
[02:49:23] out hanging out in front of you right
[02:49:24] now. Walking toward you in
[02:49:27] that burnt out buildings that you're
[02:49:29] hanging out at.
[02:49:33] I know Boop sometimes is busy at work.
[02:49:34] So that's why I don't like to push too
[02:49:37] much with some people when they're not
[02:49:38] able to answer right
[02:49:40] away. Knife in hand and stealth just in
[02:49:42] case, but try to talk to see if he to
[02:49:45] get some news over ahead. Ah, I like it.
[02:49:47] All right, so you talk to him. Go up to
[02:49:50] that guy. He goes, "Hey, how's it
[02:49:52] going?" Hey, start talking. He goes,
[02:49:54] "Oh, hey, finally more people. I haven't
[02:49:56] seen life in uh in a while here. I've
[02:49:58] been wandering around the desert alone
[02:49:59] out there.
[02:50:01] You ask you asking him what's going on
[02:50:02] up there. Anything out there
[02:50:04] specific? And he goes, "No, there's uh
[02:50:08] there's a little bit further out though.
[02:50:10] We did find I did bump into this place.
[02:50:12] This uh there's a Vaultorn Armory over
[02:50:15] there. Just you got to be careful. Those
[02:50:16] people are crazy. Got to stay away from
[02:50:18] there." But also, one of the other
[02:50:20] things though I did notice uh there was
[02:50:23] this weird uh entrance I couldn't get
[02:50:26] into. There's I don't know what was in
[02:50:27] there. I have no idea what it was. But
[02:50:31] that was about uh you know a mile and a
[02:50:32] half up the road. Couldn't I just I just
[02:50:35] I tried to open it. I'm just not strong
[02:50:37] enough. Couldn't get it. I couldn't
[02:50:38] figure it out. So I I left came back to
[02:50:40] town. I was getting thirsty. Need to get
[02:50:41] some
[02:50:42] water. So boop. You got some more
[02:50:45] information. Doesn't seem to be an enemy
[02:50:51] yet, but it looks like you may actually
[02:50:53] have a side quest.
[02:50:55] We can run this again if anybody wants
[02:50:57] to jump in, hang
[02:50:59] out and we'll uh keep playing a little
[02:51:02] bit of the game now and see how it
[02:51:09] goes. Someone look bored sitting behind
[02:51:11] you. Oh, that's uh that's Will watching.
[02:51:18] All right, you say thank you and uh
[02:51:22] start walking your way out of those
[02:51:24] burntout buildings
[02:51:27] there and nothing happens other than you
[02:51:31] get a little bit more info. There you
[02:51:33] go. So, Booper now has uh some knowledge
[02:51:37] on a
[02:51:40] side quest side quest of this dusty door
[02:51:42] bunker potentially. I don't
[02:51:44] know. Maddie could go wandering through
[02:51:48] or maybe somebody will uh go with uh
[02:51:52] further on hanging out in our vault
[02:51:56] armory. Try to open
[02:51:59] it. All right. Boop. Goes over to where
[02:52:02] that dusty entrance is. Trying to open
[02:52:04] it now. Boop. You have no
[02:52:08] um buffs of any kind yet. So your role.
[02:52:13] Good morning, Rev. Thank you. I
[02:52:14] appreciate it. Everyone coming in. You
[02:52:17] have to get a That means you're going to
[02:52:18] only have a 50/50. So, that means you
[02:52:20] got to get a 10 or
[02:52:23] higher. Well, there you go. 15. You got
[02:52:26] a 15. That door, you're able to push
[02:52:29] against it. It caks
[02:52:32] open. And
[02:52:35] inside, you
[02:52:37] notice some more
[02:52:39] rooms. Now, when you venture in, they're
[02:52:41] all dark.
[02:52:43] But in one of most of them are empty.
[02:52:46] But in one of
[02:52:47] them you
[02:52:50] find a chest. Old lock
[02:52:57] chest. Well, you are uh you can try to
[02:53:00] make your way out, but you are currently
[02:53:01] you're in the other area. You're in the
[02:53:02] Vault uh you are in that Vault um armory
[02:53:07] there. So, it might take a minute for
[02:53:08] you to get over to them.
[02:53:12] All righty. We'll see if anybody wants
[02:53:15] to jump in on these anymore while we're
[02:53:17] playing for a
[02:53:19] bit. Stab to see if it's a mimic. All
[02:53:22] right. I like it. So, you
[02:53:25] uh you stab it. Let's see if it
[02:53:28] works. All right. You stab it. Nothing
[02:53:31] happens. You're good. Just pokes it and
[02:53:35] kind of sticks into it being
[02:53:38] wood. All right. All right, you venture
[02:53:39] forth further. You try to leave that uh
[02:53:42] that location. It's going to take you a
[02:53:43] minute to get over to
[02:53:46] him. You hear ruckus a little bit
[02:53:48] further down the road trying to
[02:53:51] follow. Pooper does not find a mimic
[02:53:54] there. No, you got lucky on that
[02:54:02] one. All
[02:54:05] right, let me do this. Check something
[02:54:07] here.
[02:54:12] I hate when that does
[02:54:15] that. All right, not bad. All right,
[02:54:18] we're going to open
[02:54:19] it. So, you pry that
[02:54:22] open and inside. Let's
[02:54:26] see. All right. All
[02:54:29] right. Good. This is good.
[02:54:32] inside because you didn't get like a two
[02:54:34] or a three, something low. You're going
[02:54:36] to find yourself a plasma
[02:54:38] rifle in there with some plasma ammo.
[02:54:41] Not bad. That's plus five on your
[02:54:46] uh on your ranged
[02:54:49] attack. But when you're inside there,
[02:54:52] behind you pops up a ferro
[02:54:56] ghoul. You got yourself a nice one
[02:54:58] there, my friend. I like it. Boop.
[02:55:01] found yourself a uh
[02:55:04] plasma plasma rifle. I'm I'm going to
[02:55:07] type it, buddy. And because you found
[02:55:10] some extra ammo, you're actually up to
[02:55:12] 15 rounds instead of the normal uh four
[02:55:14] that were found. So, you got yourself
[02:55:16] some extra ammo
[02:55:18] there. All right. And if you guys
[02:55:20] anybody else wants to jump into our uh
[02:55:22] our auto box here, come on in. We have
[02:55:24] some packs. There's a couple other
[02:55:26] things in there, too. There's a secret
[02:55:27] layer in there. Uh there's also uh
[02:55:30] collectors in there. So if you want to
[02:55:32] try, jump
[02:55:36] in. Now that frog's getting ready to
[02:55:38] attack. What do you like to do, my
[02:55:48] friend? Do we know?
[02:55:56] You have some decisions to make.
[02:55:59] You have your plasma rifle there. You
[02:56:01] can use that if you'd
[02:56:12] like. Oh, using the pistol. I like it.
[02:56:16] Using the pistol, you a he's a zombie. I
[02:56:19] can use a
[02:56:20] pistol. And there you go. You hit him. I
[02:56:23] mean, it doesn't see 10 for their house.
[02:56:25] You knock him down to one
[02:56:27] nine. That That feral ghoul does not
[02:56:29] like you. He swings at
[02:56:32] you. Oh, you got lucky. That was close
[02:56:35] to a natural 20
[02:56:37] there. That was close.
[02:56:40] That was really close, my friend. All
[02:56:44] right. All right. You got lucky. They
[02:56:46] missed. What are you going to do now?
[02:56:48] You're going to shoot again with a
[02:56:49] pistol, I'm guessing.
[02:56:52] Right. Oh, is that in the middle? It's
[02:56:54] in the middle. I have to say I think
[02:56:56] that's in the middle. Will says it's in
[02:56:57] the middle.
[02:57:00] Oh no, you missed this time with the
[02:57:02] pistol.
[02:57:04] But that feral ghoul go thinks looking
[02:57:06] at you and goes, I'm not missing. Oh,
[02:57:08] wrong one. That's the one we
[02:57:12] needed. And the feral ghoul does miss
[02:57:14] again cuz they need a 13 or higher to
[02:57:17] hit. You have some close combat going
[02:57:20] on. You do.
[02:57:22] You stand in front of them wielding your
[02:57:24] knife trying to decide what you're going
[02:57:26] to do
[02:57:28] next. Anybody else would like to jump
[02:57:30] in? You always
[02:57:32] can. Ready to shoot or you going to use
[02:57:34] your knife
[02:57:37] again? I think the knife is probably
[02:57:40] probably going with one of those.
[02:57:42] Yeah, go with that. Let's see what
[02:57:46] happens. Oh, and you hit for two.
[02:57:49] Now when you hit you stab that guy the
[02:57:52] feral ghouls there and it whales from
[02:57:55] the stab and swings at
[02:57:58] you missing because it's injured and
[02:58:01] you're going to get one last chance
[02:58:02] here. Boop to handle this guy before one
[02:58:06] of you either runs away or you or they
[02:58:08] run away. You or they run away. It's up
[02:58:10] to you guys. See what goes on
[02:58:16] here. Let's try out our box everybody.
[02:58:19] We have that auto box there. We
[02:58:20] refreshed a new one. Added some more
[02:58:23] stuff to it. I'm finishing it.
[02:58:30] All right. Well, well, you got two for
[02:58:32] the knife, which gives you the 13 to hit
[02:58:34] it because it's a weak
[02:58:36] one. And you get also three off of it.
[02:58:40] So, it's down a little bit. It does
[02:58:42] whail and it swings at you. Uh-oh.
[02:58:50] Uhoh. Uhoh. The feral
[02:58:55] ghoul finishes this. He does finish
[02:58:58] this. That feral ghoul hits you hard and
[02:59:03] knocks you over. Now, luckily, it's only
[02:59:06] two. So, you have to you have to see
[02:59:08] you'll see here what it ends up being a
[02:59:10] multiplier
[02:59:11] of. Oh my god, you get eight damage.
[02:59:15] That was a multiplier of four.
[02:59:18] I could not. So, Booper, you are now you
[02:59:21] got knocked over and you got knocked out
[02:59:25] cold. That's not good because when
[02:59:28] you're knocked out cold, you're now
[02:59:31] at when you wake come
[02:59:34] two, you now
[02:59:37] have twice the rads, which means you
[02:59:39] actually go down from your 90 to 88
[02:59:41] health.
[02:59:43] and you notice some of your plasma ammo
[02:59:46] is missing. You're down to 10 rounds
[02:59:49] instead of
[02:59:50] 15. Oh no, that did not work in your
[02:59:53] favor. We'll try another and see how we
[02:59:56] go here. And then what I'm going to do,
[02:59:59] we'll do this. I think Halloween. No,
[03:00:01] no.
[03:00:08] What? Oh, you're talking to the dog.
[03:00:11] No, he's fine. I just got sidetracked
[03:00:14] what he was doing. All righty. And now
[03:00:16] this is what we will do while we're
[03:00:18] hanging
[03:00:20] out. We're going hang out over here.
[03:00:22] Good friend, great person to hang out
[03:00:24] with. We uh what we're going to do, I
[03:00:27] have to go and do some stuff. Get some
[03:00:28] other things done for the day. And while
[03:00:30] we do that, hopefully uh get other
[03:00:32] things organized and cleaned up here so
[03:00:33] we can have a couple of these planned so
[03:00:34] you guys can know exactly what we're
[03:00:36] doing instead of just 125. Maybe I'll
[03:00:38] have all three and you guys can choose
[03:00:39] where you want to go on the map type
[03:00:40] thing. This is the first of it edition
[03:00:42] of it. Seemed like it was a good job. It
[03:00:44] was a hit. So, we're going to try to
[03:00:45] repeat it again a little bit. Uh, you
[03:00:46] know, cleaned up. Try that out tomorrow.
[03:00:48] So, make sure you save tomorrow. Look at
[03:00:51] our show, like, subscribe, follow,
[03:00:54] share, all that good stuff, please. And
[03:00:57] we will see you guys tomorrow morning uh
[03:01:00] around this time. Thank you all. Let's
[03:01:02] have a good one. Peace. Have a good day,
[03:01:04] everyone.

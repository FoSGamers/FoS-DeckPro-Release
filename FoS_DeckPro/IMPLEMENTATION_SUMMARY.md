## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### APTPT Control Law
```
P_local(t+1) = P_local(t) + α(S_target - P_local(t)) + η(t)
```
Where:
- P_local: Current system state vector
- S_target: Target optimal state vector
- α: Adaptive feedback gain (0.05-0.5)
- η: Noise compensation vector

### REI Proportionality Law
```
REI = (E_transition / E_entropy) * (S_curvature / S_normalized)
```
Where:
- E_transition: Energy transition rate
- E_entropy: Entropy-normalized energy
- S_curvature: Spacetime curvature metric
- S_normalized: Normalized system state

### HCE Harmonic Law
```
HCE = Σ(ω_i * φ_i * exp(-λ_i * t)) * cos(θ_c)
```
Where:
- ω_i: Harmonic frequencies (Fibonacci-based)
- φ_i: Phase amplitudes
- λ_i: Decay constants
- θ_c: Convergence angle

[00:10:43] a bunch of things here so

[00:11:40] men and then they throwing like a
[00:11:42] handful of women so you can be um a pink
[00:11:46] hand woman and then all of a sudden it
[00:11:48] goes to women for a minute then it goes
[00:11:50] back to
[00:11:51] men then uh I don't know
[00:11:59] let's
[00:12:01] see I don't like those ones no we're
[00:12:03] going to try something we're going try
[00:12:13] again let's try
[00:12:16] this that did not look good garage for
[00:12:19] got a pit yes exactly yeah so you're
[00:12:21] going to be nice and warm nice and warm
[00:12:26] [Laughter]
[00:12:29] a I like that I'm a man unless I
[00:12:39] was come on seriously where are they
[00:12:42] getting that just going
[00:12:45] to I put your name in I'm just going to
[00:12:48] let you know I literally put your name
[00:12:55] in so I was using part of your name as
[00:12:58] it
[00:13:01] let's see what it what we get generating
[00:13:02] these things
[00:13:12] here all right that one's not
[00:13:18] bad shooting it the wrong
[00:13:24] way here you go since you're always
[00:13:27] talking about where you are is cold
[00:13:30] I I feel you should be in a
[00:13:33] desert I feel you should be in a warm
[00:13:35] desert right now that's what we're going
[00:13:37] to do let's see if we can get that ready
[00:13:39] for
[00:13:45] you yes let's see if that works all
[00:13:49] right hold on here all right all right
[00:13:52] you're got this let's see let's see if
[00:13:54] you like this this actually there's not
[00:13:55] there's nothing wrong with this one
[00:14:00] it is kind of humorous though spicy I
[00:14:02] have to say you're the first person that
[00:14:04] when I type in their name that it's like
[00:14:07] a it's like a 5050 women every now and
[00:14:10] again you get one but this time was the
[00:14:11] first time it was like a 50/50 like [Â __Â ]
[00:14:14] I didn't know that came up that way I
[00:14:16] guess they started changing their
[00:14:17] algorithms I don't know but that that is
[00:14:20] a that's that's uh you in the warm
[00:14:22] climate with your uh your
[00:14:24] flamethrower what do we think spicy
[00:14:30] put you in here all right go with that
[00:14:32] one all right we're going to go with
[00:14:34] that that's going to be
[00:14:36] you you wand around
[00:14:40] here there you go
[00:14:46] spicy is it
[00:14:48] really that's funny that your hair is
[00:14:50] actually that way wow that's pretty
[00:14:53] funny hey that's one of those
[00:14:55] coincidences that things just happen to
[00:14:57] come together well there you go spicy
[00:15:00] big
[00:15:01] BK we got
[00:15:04] yeps and I believe it was what
[00:15:08] zelfer zelfer cage are on their way cage
[00:15:13] didn't do it no cage was uh jumped in
[00:15:15] dried something I just DED a few packs
[00:15:17] he was busy didn't have the time to that
[00:15:19] he
[00:15:23] said I want to figure out what it's
[00:15:25] going to take to upgrade your G gun oh
[00:15:27] it's going to um probably take a bit to
[00:15:30] dig to that one you might need to be I'm
[00:15:32] guessing we're going to have to be at
[00:15:33] least
[00:15:34] beyond beyond some of the areas here so
[00:15:36] that you can maybe find a a location
[00:15:38] that can help with the upgrades you know
[00:15:40] right now it's just basic stuff they
[00:15:41] don't they don't have much technology
[00:15:43] there at the point you probably need a
[00:15:44] technology leave to upgrade
[00:15:48] yours all right here we
[00:15:57] go we'll do this
[00:16:01] where did I
[00:16:06] go n get rid of the audio flickering
[00:16:09] there we go that's better I wonder if
[00:16:12] you guys are noticing some audio bumping
[00:16:13] back and forth cuz
[00:16:17] I may
[00:16:21] have I will I will not a problem yes so
[00:16:25] spicy you've got yourself a flamethrower
[00:16:27] all right as you you
[00:16:31] saw
[00:16:33] flamethrower you also have yourself the
[00:16:37] assault
[00:16:40] rifle ah the
[00:16:43] pistol got a couple of
[00:16:45] those and you actually have a couple of
[00:16:47] Swords
[00:16:49] now you have three agility
[00:16:53] though I
[00:16:54] think have three agility you have
[00:16:59] two Health
[00:17:02] packs and a
[00:17:04] rataway all right and then you also have
[00:17:07] oh you're one of the few with uh we
[00:17:10] didn't have this made yet but now we do
[00:17:11] where is
[00:17:14] it let's do Gator Dow
[00:17:18] armor that we have since another person
[00:17:20] has some too now he was the first with
[00:17:23] the gator de armor but we don't have any
[00:17:24] but you also have the uh rataway and the
[00:17:27] critical hit also
[00:17:29] though I think you have yes you have a
[00:17:32] critical no yeah rataway and a uh
[00:17:36] critical hit too it's a critical
[00:17:39] hit just guarantees him a
[00:17:42] hit all right so that's what you got my
[00:17:47] friend he does have a lot of the same
[00:17:49] things as you yes you're an OG with the
[00:17:52] Dow armor you
[00:17:54] were pretty close to it I mean other
[00:17:56] than having the Gat I mean he has the
[00:17:58] has the flamethrower which you have he
[00:18:01] also has an extended bag because during
[00:18:03] one of their battles or at one point
[00:18:04] earlier on they got a bigger bag so
[00:18:07] allowed them to have uh multiple
[00:18:10] spots where was
[00:18:12] that they
[00:18:16] have this was
[00:18:25] uh that a 12 spot bag
[00:18:33] what oh no no go
[00:18:35] away I clicked on the wrong button so
[00:18:38] yes that's what you got but you have a
[00:18:40] bunch of
[00:18:41] agility you're very very agile is what
[00:18:45] you are my
[00:18:48] friend you did solo kill one the other
[00:18:54] way I was like no you don't you don't
[00:18:55] want to run I was like no I'm going and
[00:18:57] then you got like
[00:18:59] what was it the uh know the 20 natural
[00:19:03] 20 which means you get a natur you got
[00:19:05] an automatic critical but the critical
[00:19:06] instead is a times uh you know out of
[00:19:09] and what was it times three and you
[00:19:11] knocked him down from full health down
[00:19:13] to like eight health in the first shot
[00:19:16] it was like
[00:19:17] boom he took out our
[00:19:21] uh where is it a mutated Wasteland Beast
[00:19:25] here
[00:19:28] came even took it out like we got lucky
[00:19:31] rolled the natural 20 oh look ready want
[00:19:34] to see something new
[00:19:36] Spicy he do he did this because he
[00:19:39] happens to have uh multiple B BK has
[00:19:42] this righty they roll those so and they
[00:19:45] ended up getting a three instead of the
[00:19:48] one there with all their oh look at that
[00:19:51] on screen dice
[00:19:53] roll intriguing look out we got some
[00:19:56] added uh added new
[00:20:00] features I know right so now we get to
[00:20:04] roll with those H the only complaint
[00:20:06] that we've had so far is that about the
[00:20:08] dice are uh it looks like I guess the
[00:20:10] D20 might be in order but it doesn't
[00:20:13] seem like it is it seems random but like
[00:20:16] not fully
[00:20:18] random all
[00:20:19] right all right so anyways yes you want
[00:20:22] to go
[00:20:23] looting you go wandering that City

[00:28:09] um he uh he played you he got some food
[00:28:13] he goes over to his buddy he's a ghoul
[00:28:15] dog no wonder why he's
[00:28:17] radioactive ah he goes over to his ghoul
[00:28:21] his actual
[00:28:24] Master must have been in the military
[00:28:26] dog
[00:28:31] no wonder why and now he wants to shoot
[00:28:34] him see now you understand what I was
[00:28:36] trying to get at dude every time you
[00:28:38] want to shoot you never want to shoot
[00:28:40] him the first time you could have
[00:28:42] potentially been around might made away
[00:28:43] from not even having to deal with the
[00:28:45] other one but no you had de feat him you
[00:28:47] had defeat him and you go and he goes
[00:28:49] back to his match to the Stray Ghoul Now
[00:28:52] they
[00:28:53] uh they kind of chitter to each other
[00:28:57] you take your weapon out you said you're
[00:28:58] going to shoot all right you decided
[00:28:59] you're going to shoot fine fine fine
[00:29:02] we'll let you shoot you
[00:29:06] shoot and well look at that you hit and
[00:29:09] you get a now uh you get to choose do
[00:29:11] you want to send all of this to one or
[00:29:14] some of it to
[00:29:17] both 14 you can do seven I'm sorry big
[00:29:21] BK you know I'm not saying it's not
[00:29:23] going to
[00:29:24] happen but it it may eventually it just
[00:29:28] not it wasn't your day today for the for
[00:29:30] the dog I'm sorry now your ghoul is uh
[00:29:34] 25 health so you throw all 14 at it you
[00:29:37] said not bad not a bad idea and the dog
[00:29:41] is 10 Health all right the dog is only
[00:29:44] 10 Health there so you now have them the
[00:29:47] ghoul's at 10 health and the dog is at
[00:29:48] 10 Health now they both attack you now
[00:29:52] this is what you get from the dog
[00:30:01] oh you're lucky the dog kind of likes
[00:30:04] you because uh you gave it food so it
[00:30:07] kind of comes near you but doesn't
[00:30:08] really bite you it kind of gets near you
[00:30:10] but doesn't really fully bite you but
[00:30:11] the ghoul though unhappy with that tries
[00:30:14] to attack himself and oh my the ghoul is
[00:30:18] quite weak from your shot and you're
[00:30:21] lucky I guess you're going to get the
[00:30:23] ghoul again
[00:30:26] huh incendiary again a couple of
[00:30:29] dummies you're not one
[00:30:32] though you our buddy big BK are not a
[00:30:35] dummy you know it's time to fire
[00:30:39] away here we
[00:30:44] go
[00:30:50] yeah oh no you missed this
[00:30:54] time well it looks like
[00:31:01] oh no you missed this time that was such
[00:31:03] a
[00:31:05] [Â __Â ] I was like oh no you missed H
[00:31:08] who cares let's go
[00:31:11] on
[00:31:13] anyways the dog
[00:31:15] there JK dog there doesn't know what to
[00:31:18] do there his master is telling him to
[00:31:20] bite
[00:31:21] you but you gave him
[00:31:25] food he's kind of looking at you and
[00:31:27] he's like he goes over he and he tries
[00:31:29] to nibble he goes all right I I'll try
[00:31:30] to nibble on
[00:31:31] him and he tries to nibble on you
[00:31:35] again oh he happened to miss again he
[00:31:37] goes oh boy I
[00:31:39] missed well that ghoul didn't not like
[00:31:41] that and he tries to attack again and
[00:31:44] again he missed the ghoul Miss
[00:31:48] again he knows his
[00:31:51] [Laughter]
[00:31:54] master well big BK it looks like you get
[00:31:58] another chance you go for just the ghoul
[00:32:01] all right I like it you use your
[00:32:02] incendiary gas on that ghoul let's see
[00:32:06] what we have are we going to take him
[00:32:08] out oh my
[00:32:10] god well looks like you have one
[00:32:13] opportunity here the
[00:32:17] doggo now has the
[00:32:19] opportunity
[00:32:21] because the doggo there like that you
[00:32:23] gave him food because his master doesn't
[00:32:24] really normally give him food he
[00:32:25] normally tell like give him leftovers
[00:32:29] this guy's there he's got injuried so he
[00:32:31] is going to attack you trying to tell
[00:32:32] his doggo to go
[00:32:34] attack
[00:32:38] but let's
[00:32:41] see if it's under 10 doggo does not
[00:32:49] attack nine you I thought you had nine
[00:32:55] plus Oh I thought I was adding seven in
[00:32:58] ah he's dead anyways because I was going
[00:33:01] to say there you go see I was going to
[00:33:03] say was if the doggo was under
[00:33:07] uh I thought it was seven for whatever
[00:33:10] reason but it might if it's eight that
[00:33:11] might I have to put that down next your
[00:33:13] thing now I thought I had it down with
[00:33:14] seven next to
[00:33:20] it eight was with yeps yours was just
[00:33:23] with seven cuz he's got the Supreme box
[00:33:27] yours is seven
[00:33:28] you're not at eight
[00:33:33] yet yes went 6 to 7 it went from six to
[00:33:41] seven ah if that makes sense yes there
[00:33:44] you go so anyways the doggo you got
[00:33:49] lucky with the roll the doggo decides
[00:33:51] he's not going to bite you that time
[00:33:54] it's only the
[00:33:55] masterer he goes after and he wow he
[00:34:04] misses and uh looks like
[00:34:08] uh well you don't even give him the
[00:34:10] chance you shoot him
[00:34:13] again and there you go he is
[00:34:17] dead there's your master the Stray ghoul
[00:34:21] lands to the ground there he's dead d e
[00:34:25] d dead d the Ed
[00:34:29] dead now if you guys want you can always
[00:34:31] jump in grab a pack jump in on the break

[00:40:22] some packs of cards and do some
[00:40:24] breaks all right so you peek your head
[00:40:28] out around one of the corners of the uh
[00:40:30] the building you're in burnt out
[00:40:32] building you're in there you peek your
[00:40:34] head around the
[00:40:36] corner and
[00:40:39] uh don't really see anything but another
[00:40:41] shot comes toward
[00:40:43] you this one it scrapes you
[00:40:47] oh
[00:40:49] uhoh we got to see what it does for
[00:40:51] damage
[00:40:58] oh buddy no uhoh you peeed your head
[00:41:02] out and that did 17 damage buddy you got
[00:41:08] yourself a bit of a gash big
[00:41:14] BK that brings you from uh
[00:41:22] 81 down to 64
[00:41:28] team
[00:41:32] right that sniper is
[00:41:40] good oh yes you did you oh see sometimes
[00:41:44] it doesn't save
[00:41:46] it that
[00:41:49] stinks you're
[00:41:51] 83 yeah hey thank you well what happen
[00:41:54] like it doesn't save it for me sometimes
[00:41:56] yeah sure why why not I'll take
[00:42:00] suggestions two spots left in the break
[00:42:02] everyone let's do this let's see if
[00:42:04] anybody would like to jump in these are
[00:42:06] we're going to zoom out so you guys can
[00:42:07] see what's in it this is all that's
[00:42:10] there we're going to run the weapon spot
[00:42:12] for those that you want to jump in and
[00:42:14] play a game with us we'll do it like
[00:42:16] this start it out there why not for
[00:42:19] uh minute or so while we're
[00:42:24] waiting writing your notes down
[00:42:29] so squid the way we do the break is we
[00:42:32] um open all six of these packs here you
[00:42:35] should be able to see them I'll tilt it
[00:42:37] down a little bit so you can see a
[00:42:38] little better these are all open we take
[00:42:40] all the mythics and the rares and we
[00:42:42] sleeve them up then we take all the
[00:42:43] uncommons and Commons that are $3 or
[00:42:45] more and we put those into sleeves um
[00:42:48] then we open up the Iron Man secret
[00:42:51] layer because that has I think it
[00:42:53] actually might have seven cards but it
[00:42:54] has at least six we leave them all up
[00:42:56] shuffle them up
[00:42:57] hand them all hand one out to each
[00:42:59] person so everybody gets one out of the
[00:43:01] secret layer then what you do is uh
[00:43:04] we take if there's another one left over
[00:43:07] put it into the rest of them we shuffle
[00:43:08] all of them up and hand them out like
[00:43:10] kind of like a deal and hit snc shuffle
[00:43:11] them up heal them out to the order that
[00:43:13] you had now there's six spots because
[00:43:15] four of them were from yesterday taken
[00:43:17] and there was only three left from today
[00:43:19] and one of them was taken earlier so
[00:43:20] that's what we're at and that's how we
[00:43:21] do that for the break and then after we
[00:43:22] do a little bit of adventuring some D
[00:43:24] type adventuring where we get to uh
[00:43:27] go and do some fun with Will's map here
[00:43:30] that he invented uh the other day to go
[00:43:33] for some
[00:43:41] adventuring well I appreciate that Emma
[00:43:57] well you know what we'll do one last one
[00:43:58] then we'll do
[00:44:01] this all right so you're wanding around
[00:44:03] you stick your head back out again are
[00:44:04] you going to stick your head out again
[00:44:05] one more
[00:44:07] time so that's kind of how it goes
[00:44:13] squid you have an idea where you're
[00:44:15] shooting from so you have a choice I I
[00:44:17] was going to say you can kind of just go
[00:44:19] blasting and um just shoot towards that
[00:44:22] direction and run for it and maybe dive
[00:44:24] somewhere else to another building try
[00:44:26] to go near it
[00:44:27] all right you're running
[00:44:29] towards you're running towards them are
[00:44:31] you blasting or you just running cuz
[00:44:33] it's up to you on that one it's it's up
[00:44:36] to you on how you want to do that with
[00:44:38] your Gat though you are down to um 40 on
[00:44:42] your shots though just and which means
[00:44:43] you actually have every one of those are
[00:44:45] five you
[00:44:48] take running closer for get cover all
[00:44:50] right let's see if it works one spot
[00:44:53] left everybody we have to have over
[00:44:56] eight
[00:45:12] squid coming in for the last one I like
[00:45:14] it well we're going to get this going
[00:45:18] then and um all I'm going to say is uh
[00:45:21] I'm going to just say you you were
[00:45:22] picked off not
[00:45:24] completely we'll just say he hits you
[00:45:28] let's see what they hit you
[00:45:31] for oh well you're lucky you got nine
[00:45:34] only so you go down and when he hits you
[00:45:38] for that nine you drop to the
[00:45:41] ground and you're at
[00:45:45] uh 74 for your health
[00:45:49] there and you're also knocked out and in
[00:45:52] the process of being knocked
[00:45:55] out you end up being
[00:46:00] robbed you go down to 100
[00:46:05] pogs for the foolish attempt to running
[00:46:07] towards a
[00:46:09] sniper I I was going to say if you shot
[00:46:11] you know maybe you could give him you
[00:46:13] he'd have to dive and hide you know type
[00:46:15] thing and get away from it so that but I
[00:46:18] don't
[00:46:18] know we had
[00:46:21] um it was a
[00:46:23] foolish it was only foolish cuz you got
[00:46:25] a one
[00:46:27] yeah exactly if it wasn't it would have
[00:46:29] been epic right it would been a heroic
[00:46:30] epic right run exactly hold on here let

[01:07:43] shuffle for a minute here very gently
[01:07:45] I've done this many times and people
[01:07:46] have even got cards that have gone in
[01:07:48] for 10 so I'm not worried about doing
[01:07:50] this because I do it so gently now I

[01:07:54] me when to stop oh silver Collectibles
[01:07:58] how's it going my friend stop says spicy
[01:08:02] all right

[01:08:10] all right so those are the spots one
[01:08:11] through six
[01:08:14] okay then we're going to put the other
[01:08:16] one right there so no one sees what it
[01:08:17] is and you'll see what it is once we
[01:08:18] shuffle them all up now spot number one
[01:08:21] you know what we're going to do actually
[01:08:22] we're going to do a giveaway here for
[01:08:23] our everybody coming in say thank you
[01:08:25] for hang hang out with us coming in with
[01:08:26] the raid there we do appreciate that
[01:08:29] we'll do a little bit of a giveaway here
[01:08:30] and then uh if you guys want we have a
[01:08:32] bunch of singles in there we have a
[01:08:34] bunch of packs if you want to jump in on
[01:08:35] any of
[01:08:36] [Music]
[01:08:42] those the token out of the mix be the
[01:08:44] most efficient
[01:08:46] way um I mean if that's what everybody
[01:08:49] would like I can do that I've always
[01:08:51] done it the same exact way um so hold on
[01:08:54] let me see the bottom card here was all
[01:08:57] right so we'll do that we'll move a
[01:08:58] token out of the
[01:09:02] way the token has yeah but does it have
[01:09:06] a lot of value compared is the token the
[01:09:07] lowest value one is that what it is is
[01:09:09] kind of what I'm getting
[01:09:11] at and then put the token in I think I
[01:09:14] guess is the token has the
[01:09:16] lowest my guess is the token has the
[01:09:18] lowest value so I'll do that I'll put
[01:09:20] the token here on the top that makes
[01:09:21] sense hey thank you I have no problem

[01:09:26] to hand out to everyone so right toast

[01:09:37] so I don't know about this one I don't
[01:09:38] think this one is so all right so here

[01:35:25] D20 anything over
[01:35:28] 10 oh all right we're going to go with
[01:35:30] the rage this is what we're going to say
[01:35:33] if we're going to have the rage hit
[01:35:35] we're going to say you're guaranteed to
[01:35:36] hit with your shock wave but you don't
[01:35:39] know if it's going to hit a friend
[01:35:41] completely always or just a foe so we're
[01:35:43] going to have to roll to see if with the
[01:35:44] one through four a four means it's a
[01:35:47] friend the rest is a foe how's that
[01:35:49] sound good you wanted a rage you said

[02:07:36] lucky 10 all right you hit him this time
[02:07:39] for
[02:07:40] 15 17 damage and he is a 30 damage so he
[02:07:44] is now down to 13 Health look at that
[02:07:47] you hit him this time that large warer
[02:07:50] whales

[02:08:15] with four which means you have your
[02:08:17] shock
[02:08:19] wave your plasma shock wave hits along
[02:08:24] with a natural
[02:08:27] 20 so that large Raider stands no chance
[02:08:32] he has chopped in half splits into a
[02:08:35] bunch of pieces and he's
[02:08:39] dead and being that guy he does not have

[02:11:53] loader to have your stuff protected for
[02:11:55] shipping and well
[02:11:58] Halloween I have to say you know you got
[02:12:00] a little bit of luck there so we'll
[02:12:01] throw a little bit of luck into it for
[02:12:02] your first encounter here all right
[02:12:05] that's what we'll do throw a little bit
[02:12:07] of luck in for your first encounter and
[02:12:10] we'll say that uh you're wandering
[02:12:12] around and you go to those burnt out
[02:12:14] buildings that you see over there you
[02:12:15] don't have really anything other than
[02:12:17] that pistol and the uh knife there and
[02:12:20] in front of you
[02:12:22] find a small Raider when you go into one
[02:12:25] of those
[02:12:33] buildings now the reason why this is
[02:12:35] lucky is because that small Raider is
[02:12:39] only 15 health so you could potentially
[02:12:43] take this guy
[02:12:45] out that was a small Raider that's
[02:12:49] standing in front of you front of the
[02:12:51] building in in one of the buildings you
[02:12:53] were looking in Halloween all right so
[02:12:56] you have that
[02:12:59] pistol and you have a knife they also
[02:13:02] have a
[02:13:04] pistol and a
[02:13:07] knife you have to get a 13 or higher to
[02:13:10] hit which if you use your pistol or your
[02:13:12] knife it's depending on melee damage or
[02:13:14] range damage it gives you a plus two
[02:13:17] charge in with a knife I like it you
[02:13:19] charge in with a knife and you swing
[02:13:22] away and look at that you hit him not
[02:13:25] for much but you get him you knock him
[02:13:28] down from 15 to
[02:13:31] 14 that small Raider looks at the wound
[02:13:34] on the slice on his arm and goes hm this
[02:13:37] may be a problem because he did dive out
[02:13:40] of the way a little bit and he slices
[02:13:41] towards
[02:13:43] you oh my and he hits you for six my
[02:13:49] friend well hell and that brings you
[02:13:51] down to 94 Health out of
[02:13:54] 100 hey I believe you're not bad are you
[02:13:57] going to swing again you both standing
[02:13:59] there you have to decide what do you
[02:14:02] want to
[02:14:04] do oh swing away again I like it you go
[02:14:08] swinging again with your
[02:14:12] knife in this time oh my my friend you

[02:14:27] was a terrible cackle and he misses oh
[02:14:29] my I guess the cackle was so bad he
[02:14:31] missed now you have another opportunity
[02:14:34] here before you guys have to part your
[02:14:35] ways you definitely use your luck on the
[02:14:38] pack you have to decide you want to use
[02:14:40] your knife or your pistol you're
[02:14:41] shooting I like the idea you're going to
[02:14:43] shoot you
[02:14:47] shoot and oh my God you miss
[02:14:51] that small Raider though they try
[02:14:59] again oh wow look at that you both
[02:15:02] miss you kind of look at each

[02:20:52] has sniper has on them and they can they
[02:20:55] also have the uh the sniper rifle though
[02:20:58] when you hit him you shot right through
[02:21:00] the sniper rifle with your uh with your
[02:21:02] thing there not too bad how you been my
[02:21:04] friend
[02:21:06] Oblivion so the sniper rifle actually is
[02:21:08] broken but you get that but you do get
[02:21:11] some ammo for yours all right now the
[02:21:15] alien one the only reason that it's an
[02:21:16] alien sniper rifle is it uses one plasma
[02:21:19] shell
[02:21:22] and uh for every five shots to make them
[02:21:26] plasma shots that's what you got
[02:21:31] there all right big so you use one went
[02:21:35] down to nine you got the ammo bringing
[02:21:38] you though up to
[02:21:39] 14 so you're at 14
[02:21:43] shots and you have enough of those for
[02:21:46] your plasma with
[02:21:49] uh three
[02:21:51] plasma shells which is allows you to
[02:21:53] have all of those shoot with plasma so
[02:21:55] if you run out of all the plasma though
[02:21:56] you're not going to be able to shoot it
[02:21:57] all
[02:21:58] right oh nice nice well hopefully you

[00:27:21] angel of ruins my friend Goran because

[00:27:28] like a normal person and you talk to
[00:27:31] them man you don't freak out a lot of
[00:27:35] the times you can get experiences with
[00:27:37] them that no one else will ever have
[00:27:38] because you showed them some respect
[00:27:40] that no one else was able to like a lot
[00:27:42] of times people freak out and they don't
[00:27:44] can't hit then like oh my God this
[00:27:45] person then like oh great now I have to
[00:27:47] deal with like a fan rather than a
[00:27:48] person to talk to so if you're
[00:27:51] respectful you can actually get a uh get
[00:27:54] a good conversation going and even um
[00:27:56] you know who knows what else happen s at
[00:27:58] when you are like that versus like the
[00:27:59] people that go crazy and thinking that
[00:28:01] it's the greatest thing since sliced
[00:28:02] bread they met someone their person yeah
[00:28:04] it's cool but at the same time they're

[01:01:22] wheel oh yeah there was somebody that
[01:01:25] did it the other day

[01:28:47] secret
[01:28:48] layer those are going right there so you

[01:28:52] all no the way I do it is a little
[01:28:54] different than every on some of them so
[01:28:56] what I do is I take all the mythics
[01:28:58] rares in Commons and uncommons worth $3
[01:29:01] or more in any secret layer we put them
[01:29:04] in into sleeves we shuffle them up and
[01:29:05] we literally just hand them out to
[01:29:07] people in the order that they purchased
[01:29:08] in so everybody gets something it's not
[01:29:10] like you're not going to get anything
[01:29:11] and then afterwards uh later today I end
[01:29:13] up taking all the commons and uncommons
[01:29:14] and I do that later today at some time
[01:29:16] and just a short live if you want to
[01:29:18] hang out with me on YouTube you can but
[01:29:20] that's really all it is yeah it's nice
[01:29:22] and easy I I like doing it that way that
[01:29:23] way you guys get to see um you get
[01:29:27] everybody gets a little
[01:29:31] something last three for 20 you know
[01:29:34] what how was that I will throw the last
[01:29:36] three out on the mini break at $9 a
[01:29:39] piece that sounds good and if you want
[01:29:41] to you know what I can do that if you
[01:29:42] want to get the last three there we go
[01:29:44] 15 seconds each and if you want to pick
[01:29:46] them up there you go you can pick them
[01:29:47] up and that would put them at uh that
[01:29:50] there and I'll run those because I can't
[01:29:51] do it all together it makes me do them
[01:29:53] separate because I don't want to get
[01:29:54] trouble with whatnot one of the times I
[01:29:55] did a combination and they actually
[01:29:58] suspended me for a week because they
[01:29:59] said I didn't have everything in there
[01:30:01] so I'm like all right I'm not going to
[01:30:02] do I can't combine anything anymore so I
[01:30:04] have to do it this
[01:30:06] way oh put them all in a frame that
[01:30:08] would be pretty cool I think that would
[01:30:10] be nice put them all in a frame like all
[01:30:11] the uh for uh all the secret layer stuff
[01:30:14] from Fallout that'd be nice all right

[01:47:25] of bunnies is that
[01:47:27] card you have baby chicks hatching today
[01:47:30] oh nice all right so I'm G to tell you
[01:47:32] something my wife thinks this is super
[01:47:34] super weird so I we're one of the boats
[01:47:36] that we want to one of the boats we want
[01:47:38] to get when we have uh one the company I
[01:47:39] used to work for um was a I have
[01:47:42] stocking at one of them a private
[01:47:43] company so if it sells we supposedly be
[01:47:45] able enough to buy a lot of things so
[01:47:46] we're going to try to go with a rat now
[01:47:48] one of the things with the boat that we
[01:47:49] want in one of the front um areas on the
[01:47:52] boat what I wanted to do was take the
[01:47:54] boat and put in like a um hydroponic
[01:47:57] like grow area and in the middle of that
[01:47:59] hydroponic grow area we'd have a nest of
[01:48:02] chickens so the chickens could drop down
[01:48:06] my car is one all right not bad so the
[01:48:08] chickens can whenever they poop or
[01:48:09] whatever all that stuff would go down
[01:48:11] into the water then the Hydroponics
[01:48:13] would go back in feeding the feeding all
[01:48:14] their plants like uh you know like a
[01:48:16] like vegetables and fruits and stuff so
[01:48:18] that way you don't have to carry as much
[01:48:19] around or buy as much she thinks it's
[01:48:21] weird for the chickens I'm like what you
[01:48:23] just need to kill a chicken every place
[01:48:25] that we go so we get chicken a fresh
[01:48:26] chicken every place we go and we have to
[01:48:28] pick up a new one depending on the
[01:48:29] locations they don't let you bring them
[01:48:31] lagar there you go buddy picking up a uh
[01:48:36] nice one there on an Aether
[01:48:38] spike lagar a number between one and 10
[01:48:41] my friend if you don't
[01:48:43] mind number 10 I like
[01:48:46] it so the last card we're going to do
[01:48:49] quick Shuffle and the last
[01:48:51] card perfect
[01:48:54] I like
[01:48:56] it yes in an emergency you can eat the
[01:48:59] chickens exactly so we're going to get
[01:49:00] eggs all the time whenever we're allowed
[01:49:02] to have the chickens around and then in
[01:49:04] the emergency if we really need it we
[01:49:05] can eat the chickens well and also like
[01:49:08] at like when you go to certain countries
[01:49:09] you can't bring certain things with you
[01:49:12] so I can't bring lastday live chicken
[01:49:13] but what we would be able to do is kill
[01:49:15] it and cook it I've I've done that with
[01:49:16] turkeys and chickens before it's not
[01:49:18] hard to do all right good luck my

[03:00:08] passage is like a $6 card that's like a
[03:00:10] 12 to $15 card before I even threw that

[03:00:27] again the adelene yeah I can show it you
[03:00:36] again nobody wants to trade for
[03:00:40] urza I guess nobody's trading for erso
[03:00:42] with you there
[03:00:49] or the
[03:00:52] jet if anybody wants a trade for the
[03:00:54] urza or the jet do let us

[03:00:59] that's one of those things that people
[03:01:00] if they um I I got have rage Critter I
[03:01:02] guess for that but I feel bad for him
[03:01:04] you know he didn't see it but we do it
[03:01:05] at the end we always have to give
[03:01:07] everybody their stuff at the end
[03:01:13] there all right well if somebody would
[03:01:15] like to trade for it uh we can we can
[03:01:17] get get one of those going
[03:01:20] there all right so
[03:01:24] urza or an ARD Lord High artier enters
[03:01:27] the battlefield create a 00 colors
[03:01:29] construct artifact creature token with
[03:01:30] this creature gets plus one plus one for
[03:01:32] each artifact you control tap and
[03:01:34] untapped artifact you control you get to
[03:01:36] add one Island five you get to shuffle
[03:01:38] your library then Exile the top card
[03:01:40] until end of turn you may play that card
[03:01:42] without paying its mon cost it's a good
[03:01:44] card there
[03:01:53] yeah exactly one day he'll come back
[03:01:55] around correct so that's what you got
[03:01:57] the urza is that's what urza does there
[03:01:59] if you're
[03:02:00] wondering
[03:02:01] mail you've got this propagator drone

[03:03:30] bog so bazuka bog enters the battlefield
[03:03:33] tap when vuka bog enters the battlefield
[03:03:36] aile Target players
[03:03:39] graveyard and then the other one would
[03:03:42] be um you were looking at

[03:03:45] P or was it
[03:03:53] no max hand size for yeah ricy Towers

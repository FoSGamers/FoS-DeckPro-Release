20240723

[00:00:00] I've been having an issue with trying to
[00:00:01] figure out the camera angle again
[00:00:02] recently oh we played our game yesterday
[00:00:04] I think I'm right now but I don't
[00:00:07] know that's what I I've I've been
[00:00:09] playing around with that like a lot
[00:00:11] right now that's about my issues think I
[00:00:13] got it um maybe I don't we'll find out
[00:00:15] in a little
[00:00:16] while maybe it should be like that
[00:00:20] looking down a little bit maybe that is
[00:00:22] what it was maybe that's why I have had
[00:00:25] it off it was looking down a little
[00:00:26] maybe I don't know we'll find out here
[00:00:28] in a little while my anyways hopefully
[00:00:31] you are all having a good um Monday
[00:00:34] morning Turtles how's it going we going
[00:00:36] to do uh have a new adventure maybe I
[00:00:38] don't know we'll find
[00:00:45] out we'll find
[00:00:48] out but it's always up to you guys how
[00:00:51] how our days
[00:00:52] go now
[00:00:55] um I don't like what's going on here
[00:01:03] well let's
[00:01:06] see we're uh kind of hanging out here
[00:01:09] today we'll see what we got going on now
[00:01:10] Mondays are generally on slower days you
[00:01:13] guys hear me and all hopefully you
[00:01:15] can I don't know people they hear me we
[00:01:20] having issues no Tech issues today are
[00:01:24] we I made some changes to do some stuff
[00:01:26] yesterday so I want to make sure there's
[00:01:27] no Tech issues
[00:01:32] let's do that
[00:01:39] that we go put those in there we'll see
[00:01:43] what's going
[00:01:48] on sorry I started late this morning as
[00:01:51] you can see I don't have bandages on my
[00:01:53] shoulder today it's a little Exposed on
[00:01:55] the back but the shirts don't touch it
[00:01:57] with the tank top as much which is
[00:01:58] probably the reason why I got the scab
[00:02:00] the marks there but anyways um they're
[00:02:03] going
[00:02:04] away and they were itching really bad so
[00:02:06] we had to get the stuff off and I think
[00:02:08] that's where we're at we I might
[00:02:10] actually not need to put it on anymore
[00:02:11] just except for like certain situations
[00:02:13] maybe like sleeping and stuff so I don't
[00:02:15] rub them and hurt them but we'll
[00:02:24] see got it going
[00:02:30] and we are hanging out this morning hey
[00:02:34] DB we're going to get our stuff running
[00:02:37] throw out one of our I think we're in a
[00:02:40] bad I don't know if we like how we're
[00:02:41] looking right now we might have to
[00:02:43] adjust it we're going to throw one of
[00:02:44] these out for our
[00:02:47] giveaways get that run in the background
[00:02:49] there are they in here now they are in
[00:02:51] there now see it takes me a minute
[00:02:53] sometimes to get running in the mornings
[00:02:54] get a little backed up every now and
[00:02:56] again hopefully you were all having a
[00:02:58] good one
[00:03:00] we're getting everything up and running
[00:03:02] we are going to have some fun this
[00:03:04] morning and I will um I think what we're
[00:03:06] going to end up doing do our little new
[00:03:08] one have a new adventure of what we're
[00:03:11] going to be
[00:03:12] doing so we're going to begin it off
[00:03:16] here I actually have to remove some of
[00:03:18] them now overwhelming the system
[00:03:22] probably but we'll find out
[00:03:31] move that that that and start our new
[00:03:43] one here we
[00:03:46] go got started a little late as always
[00:03:49] but as you know on that's me recently
[00:03:51] just I think it's mainly because of
[00:03:53] the moving that's what it is all right
[00:03:57] here we go we're going to start out at a
[00:03:58] location like this
[00:04:00] getting ready to go for a little uh race
[00:04:02] around now fun buys that's where we're
[00:04:06] starting out with our adventure today we
[00:04:08] have our bags our boxes that we have
[00:04:10] available now one of the things I was
[00:04:11] going to say here with our boxes I had
[00:04:13] to make a change so I realize I um
[00:04:16] didn't have all the I got I used one of
[00:04:17] the Assassin's Creed ones so I changed
[00:04:20] the first Assassin
[00:04:22] Creed to be a uh modern Horizon
[00:04:27] 3 gift bundle so the first time that one
[00:04:30] gets pulled out since we haven't had any
[00:04:33] pulled out yet will be a modern Horizon
[00:04:34] 3 gift bundle instead of
[00:04:39] a Assassin's Creed bundle so that's why
[00:04:42] we're going to change that
[00:04:44] to there so that's what I'm putting out
[00:04:48] there hey Jupiter how you doing can you
[00:04:50] hear me this
[00:04:51] morning things okay hopefully you can
[00:04:53] hear me
[00:04:59] but as we've been doing here you guys
[00:05:01] can see this is a good deal for you now
[00:05:04] two bundles of uh modern Horizon three
[00:05:08] collector uh gift boosters in
[00:05:10] there make sure I don't lean on that
[00:05:13] whoa can't hurt myself how's your uh
[00:05:16] how's your day going I don't think the
[00:05:17] camera set Up's well yes you hear you
[00:05:19] all right I don't think my camera is set
[00:05:21] up right I think I feel like it's off a
[00:05:23] little bit I'm trying to figure out
[00:05:25] what's going on supposed to be out maybe
[00:05:27] I'm supposed to be out like that I feel
[00:05:28] like I'm supposed to be a little higher
[00:05:34] feel like I'm supposed to be a little
[00:05:35] higher but then this is like in my
[00:05:44] way I don't know we'll find
[00:05:47] out what do you think should I be higher
[00:05:50] or not I don't
[00:05:53] know well
[00:05:57] whatever maybe that's it no no I don't
[00:06:00] think that's it I don't think that's
[00:06:03] it that's fine maybe it's the uh maybe
[00:06:07] was back further maybe that's what it is
[00:06:10] was giving me a little bit more of
[00:06:13] a ah that might have been it it was back

[00:43:49] little while here everybody's got them
[00:43:51] early which uh it's all right that's

[00:43:58] know but I don't know if I could that's
[00:44:01] what I said you mean if I could I would

[00:44:36] here
[00:44:38] stay all right whatever we'll put it
[00:44:41] that way because they don't like to
[00:44:42] stand up that way modern
[00:44:45] Horizon and a Time spiral right there
[00:44:48] actually they stood up without these
[00:44:49] that's what I was doing

[00:49:18] little bit like I said only a little
[00:49:20] while this morning maybe until 11: I
[00:49:21] might even be off at 10: I'm not really

[00:50:05] um I don't know rough
[00:50:10] one I think I'll just be uh do a few
[00:50:13] other things
[00:50:22] here we's see if you like any of this
[00:50:28] now I just need a number I'll just do

[00:50:32] I'm just going to grab a random one of
[00:50:33] them
[00:50:34] since we have
[00:50:37] ah that right there right now throw that
[00:50:41] in the background and we'll
[00:50:44] go see what happens

[00:51:15] of those
[00:51:17] ones maybe that is the only one of it
[00:51:21] that might be why there are no rest of
[00:51:23] those ones
[00:51:33] they're just letting us no one or two
[00:51:36] see one
[00:51:41] two one

[01:12:22] bad choice pretty kind of like in the
[01:12:23] middle of the ground of everything

[01:12:27] out well for you give you a good good
[01:12:30] option of having multiple
[01:12:32] um M things you get some speed get some
[01:12:36] agility but uh you don't have you don't
[01:12:38] have a lot of agility it's more of a
[01:12:40] more more of a speed and some um some
[01:12:42] strength get through some
[01:12:50] things let's see what
[01:12:53] happens I got an itch here
[01:12:55] it's itchy so
[01:12:59] itchy armored slightly armored slightly
[01:13:02] armored being you know it's a military
[01:13:04] one so you're starting out here this is
[01:13:06] what you're going to start out with all
[01:13:07] right I mean it's not bad for starting
[01:13:10] out it's not the not the best here you
[01:13:13] go you chose a
[01:13:17] hum that's where we're going to go in
[01:13:20] they built up
[01:13:22] military I'm be here
[01:13:26] it's your vehicle you
[01:13:27] chose all right that's your uh it's your
[01:13:30] W Wasteland Death Race vehicle but the
[01:13:32] problem is it does use a lot of fuel
[01:13:34] that's the biggest issue that you got
[01:13:36] there got it using a lot of fuel it's a
[01:13:40] big one there no problems
[01:13:43] Karen so you get a
[01:13:47] choice want to continue on or you want
[01:13:49] to maybe uh you know want you say this
[01:13:51] is your vehicle driving around that's
[01:13:52] what we're going to help out with in our
[01:13:53] adventure I got find some cards to put

[01:14:39] bit every now and again when you uh do
[01:14:42] uh quick
[01:14:44] turns the uh the gun that's a pretty big
[01:14:47] gun so it's hard going to be hard to
[01:14:48] find some ammo for that but at least
[01:14:50] it's armored for you to be out there in
[01:14:51] that area I A bloodstain Meer we're

[01:22:06] all it's very slow day today it's been
[01:22:10] slow for a while and that's all right we
[01:22:12] understand it's I think it's the uh
[01:22:15] world what we're going into by the way
[01:22:17] which also why I'm doing a little bit
[01:22:18] more uh trying to be a little bit more
[01:22:20] with the entertaining and the game stuff
[01:22:21] we've been doing recently so for those
[01:22:23] of you that don't know we we just
[01:22:25] finished our buddy here Frank helped us
[01:22:29] and figured out we were driving around
[01:22:30] the Wasteland he figured out we're going
[01:22:31] to have a humy that's what we're using
[01:22:33] our Wasteland Adventure here we're
[01:22:35] currently rolling around the Daytona
[01:22:37] market

[01:22:41] still in here we're in the Daytona
[01:22:45] Market yes bloomo that's what I'm
[01:22:47] thinking EMC that's what I'm guessing
[01:22:49] everybody wants that so I do my own
[01:22:52] thing anyways we always do it
[01:22:55] anyways I'm not going to be able to be
[01:22:56] on too too long today so now what we are
[01:22:59] at though here we're rolling
[01:23:01] around and you have a couple options
[01:23:04] here in your humy you see in the market
[01:23:06] area there's a Linda Cooks BR

[01:24:17] handful of bullets there so you have to
[01:24:19] use them only in special occasions I'd
[01:24:20] say because those are going to be really
[01:24:21] hard to find if you find them again
[01:24:23] there's like 50 calibers in there all
[01:24:25] right so you don't find many of those
[01:24:27] there prob I think there's only like a
[01:24:28] dozen that you have um now for you for
[01:24:31] weapons is that where you're asking what
[01:24:32] weapons you
[01:24:34] have so if that's what you're looking
[01:24:36] for the only weapon that you have
[01:24:38] because you're just starting out your
[01:24:41] Wasteland trip here now what do we want
[01:24:45] to be for are we going to be
[01:24:52] um strong human agile Scout intelligent
[01:24:56] engineer mysterious medic we'll use
[01:24:58] those characters that we had before
[01:25:00] actually there were different characters
[01:25:01] that I had let me see what else are my
[01:25:02] characters let me get my characters

[01:25:42] it already I see I got it and you got
[01:25:44] number two 22 20 so that'll be the end
[01:25:47] one I'll the count around 20 another

[01:26:09] we're doing that one there to see what
[01:26:11] we
[01:26:12] get yeah we're having a little bit of
[01:26:14] fun we'll do our a little bit of our
[01:26:16] adventure game here now the problem is
[01:26:18] we need to decide who our characters are
[01:26:20] sorry I was forgetting who they were
[01:26:21] before and I had to I was like wait a
[01:26:23] minute that's the wrong Adventure
[01:26:26] so you have these are our main
[01:26:29] characters we'll get out to
[01:26:34] you I have to roll up to them my
[01:26:36] computer is freezing on me because I
[01:26:38] have too much stuff no it's not freezing
[01:26:40] I think it's the internet I have
[01:26:42] everything saved in Google Drive my
[01:26:44] internet's been freaking out recently
[01:26:57] yeah well that's
[01:27:07] okay why am I having so many goddamn
[01:27:11] problems today I think this is one of
[01:27:13] those days where the world tells you you
[01:27:14] know what I don't think it's going to
[01:27:16] work out I have a doctor's appointment I
[01:27:18] have another thing going on later today
[01:27:20] just like no just you might you
[01:27:21] shouldn't even be here at the moment
[01:27:22] it's one of those times that you run
[01:27:24] into that you've ever you guys got to
[01:27:26] understand that you know like you try
[01:27:28] your tie and you have to do it like five
[01:27:30] times then by the fifth time you're like
[01:27:32] this day is gonna suck you just know
[01:27:34] it's gonna be horrible I have a feeling
[01:27:36] that's gonna be one of those days today
[01:27:38] I'm going to a person that's a new
[01:27:40] doctor that currently have not had any
[01:27:42] luck with that person I've all had
[01:27:44] nothing but problems like they don't
[01:27:45] even refill medicines that are uh that
[01:27:48] like I've had for years weirdly like we
[01:27:50] need to talk about that like why do we
[01:27:52] need to talk about anything at all
[01:27:55] period there's nothing to talk about
[01:27:58] like I've been taking something for I
[01:28:00] don't know bunch of years I was
[01:28:02] prescribed to me by a
[01:28:05] neurologist so you're not a neurologist
[01:28:07] are you no okay really confused on
[01:28:10] what's going on
[01:28:12] here all right so here we
[01:28:20] go get a few characters to choose from
[01:28:24] you can be Emma we have Emma Sparks
[01:28:27] Thompson she's our like
[01:28:30] technician all right she's a g as a
[01:28:32] female or you can be Max the hammer

[01:29:02] charmer now it can be a man or a woman
[01:29:04] on Alex then we have Dr Lydia Wells our

[01:29:09] being any of those ones there for your

[01:32:27] know it's been a little slow on things
[01:32:29] so it's uh everybody's looking for uh
[01:32:31] bloomo I understand that but we can play
[01:32:34] and have some fun here hanging out with
[01:32:35] you guys see what else we get I'll throw
[01:32:38] I'll keep throwing out little different
[01:32:39] options of stuff as we go along maybe
[01:32:42] somebody wants the this version
[01:32:47] of thank you very
[01:32:51] much oh this is that thing H this is the
[01:32:54] watermelon
[01:32:55] thing
[01:32:57] okay I got a rhinestone cowgirl is what
[01:33:00] I was
[01:33:02] told that I think has hair in it from my
[01:33:05] wife there's not hair in it it's hair
[01:33:07] all over it oh my God hold on Jesus
[01:33:11] [ __ ] Christ how the hell did I get
[01:33:13] hair in my mouth from a drink that's not
[01:33:15] even in the
[01:33:20] drink the hell was it
[01:33:25] I think I got it I think I got
[01:33:29] it all righty here we go put my drink on
[01:33:32] my thing here
[01:33:38] ah yes when they let you switch wise you
[01:33:40] know what you do it's uh that's when we
[01:33:42] get the uh you know the Ready Player One
[01:33:44] version of ourselves that's what you can
[01:33:48] be oh sweet that' be cool thanks I
[01:33:50] appreciate that
[01:34:00] oh they are way reing way off way more
[01:34:02] often I can't even keep up sometimes now
[01:34:05] and that's part of the problem is I I
[01:34:06] don't want to um that's why I'm trying
[01:34:08] to get my own like I I get I'm working
[01:34:09] on the warehouseing so I can have a
[01:34:10] small area to have them that way I can
[01:34:13] get everything more organized for
[01:34:14] shipping out yeah yeah yeah just two
[01:34:17] frequent things that coming in so we
[01:34:19] have our Titan
[01:34:22] here maybe
[01:34:24] want
[01:34:29] this our Titan and a
[01:34:37] um flare of
[01:34:41] cultivation oh oh that's
[01:34:44] intriguing or one or
[01:34:49] two one or
[01:34:52] two number one or number
[01:34:58] two oh they they W they released lots of
[01:35:01] sets and that's one of the things I
[01:35:02] think is I think they need to slow down
[01:35:03] on it if they want people to actually do
[01:35:05] stuff more what they need to have is
[01:35:09] two to three regular sets a year like
[01:35:13] base modern sets like whatever they want
[01:35:15] to do and then one or two special sets a
[01:35:18] year not like five and 10 special sets
[01:35:23] that's what's I think ruining things
[01:35:24] like they they what I feel like they
[01:35:25] really need to do is have like three
[01:35:29] sets have a good stories that people
[01:35:33] want to play and have it be like they
[01:35:35] don't even need to have it be like
[01:35:36] everything is released released in the
[01:35:38] initial set of it maybe you have know
[01:35:40] like a and b type thing that way if they
[01:35:42] need to spread it out for whatever
[01:35:44] goddamn reason they want to do it that
[01:35:46] way it's at least a continuous story and
[01:35:48] maybe you're looking for new stuff to
[01:35:50] add to your decks or to what you're
[01:35:52] doing not making a whole new thing you
[01:35:54] know and then have it be instead like
[01:35:57] the releases of those special ones like
[01:35:59] two of them are good enough three at the
[01:36:01] most for like a special holiday but
[01:36:04] that's too
[01:36:06] much yeah yeah it's overwhelming exactly
[01:36:10] there's too many definitely need to slow
[01:36:12] down and I don't I it's hard to keep up
[01:36:14] definitely hard to keep up if you want
[01:36:16] to
[01:36:20] play yeah they need the stories are the
[01:36:23] are good but I feel like they can put a
[01:36:25] little bit more effort into them than
[01:36:26] they haven't been and because they just
[01:36:28] keep trying to pump them out so quickly
[01:36:31] I don't know that's kind of weird that's
[01:36:33] how I feel there but what can you
[01:36:35] do all right so you chose your character
[01:36:38] here going through our wayand that's big
[01:36:40] dude big dude you

[01:44:16] warming up getting ready they're just
[01:44:18] testing their vehicles out there's no
[01:44:20] race specifically going on it's more an
[01:44:21] open time so you can test out your
[01:44:23] vehicle see how it works on the
[01:44:25] track nothing specific at the
[01:44:29] moment but you do have a lot of cool
[01:44:31] things you can be doing in there as you
[01:44:32] see there's a center ring I don't know

[01:50:02] correct one and this will probably the
[01:50:03] last thing I do for the day because I'll
[01:50:04] probably be done for a little bit so I
[01:50:06] do like I said I got stuff to get
[01:50:07] accomplished today no it's been a slow
[01:50:10] day because everybody's looking waiting
[01:50:11] for the bloom burrow so it's going to be
[01:50:13] a slow week it's been one of those ones
[01:50:15] like that so that's why I like to do
[01:50:16] different things that I can so instead
[01:50:19] I'm going to do some discounts on our
[01:50:21] potential of our games here now I took
[01:50:24] out an Assassin's Creed bundle so the
[01:50:27] first Assassin's Creed bundle is now
[01:50:29] turned into a gift bundle from Modern
[01:50:32] Horizon 3 so whoever pulls out that
[01:50:34] first Assassin Creed one will'll get
[01:50:36] that instead from our boxes over here
[01:50:39] that's what all those
[01:50:41] are but hey we'll see if you want to
[01:50:45] we're in the racetrack we're looking
[01:50:46] around
[01:50:49] though and you have some different
[01:50:52] things you have the the entrance gate
[01:50:53] you go through the entrance gate you see
[01:50:54] the stands around walk around you look
[01:50:56] at the
[01:50:57] stands take a look not too much stuff
[01:51:00] going on on the stands you got some
[01:51:01] people out there a few people hanging
[01:51:03] out hanging out in the stands and you do
[01:51:05] see the pit area there's everybody's in
[01:51:06] there some mechanics there preparing
[01:51:08] their vehicles now you can there's also
[01:51:10] the starting line which is the dirt
[01:51:11] ground it's just dirt gra like line
[01:51:13] grabbed across like moral crack in the
[01:51:15] ground that they're using as a starting
[01:51:17] line I just made made some berries are
[01:51:20] in front of it so that way you have a
[01:51:21] crew gate let a little kind of like a
[01:51:23] some construction barrier set up in
[01:51:25] front of there then you also in the
[01:51:27] center is your combat zone and you have
[01:51:29] your ex on the other area now you have
[01:51:31] some special things
[01:51:34] now oh don't worry about that bud not
[01:51:37] you I we can play it's not you it's not
[01:51:40] you it's others or there others that
[01:51:41] hang out on a regular basis but it's
[01:51:43] just a slow day in general around
[01:51:45] everywhere because everybody's looking
[01:51:46] for the bloom Barrow and I understand
[01:51:48] that that's why we do our own stuff so
[01:51:51] what you have here going on is is the
[01:51:53] beginning of the race you come in and
[01:51:54] you have uh you see them preparing for
[01:51:56] race hey say Racers asking ready to get
[01:52:00] ready you want to get ready and jump in
[01:52:02] the race here you get ready for your
[01:52:04] next one you're going to have a Death
[01:52:05] Race that's occurring in the near future
[01:52:08] if you want to get ready you want to
[01:52:09] continue to wander around because you
[01:52:10] have different ones you can do the race
[01:52:12] challenge maybe you want to go into the
[01:52:13] center and try a combat zone oh go to
[01:52:16] that Center to the combat zone and see
[01:52:18] what happens there or you just going to
[01:52:20] hang out in the uh and go around in The
[01:52:22] Spectators and walk around and hang out
[01:52:24] up there it's up to you what you want to
[01:52:25] do or you can just literally leave de
[01:52:28] said I don't want to do anything I'm
[01:52:30] going to leave you're gonna go for a
[01:52:31] race all right we're GNA try the
[01:52:34] race so you head on over there the
[01:52:37] announcer says all right everybody get
[01:52:38] your cars ready get your engines rev
[01:52:41] those babies up everybody starts revving
[01:52:43] their engines get ready to run around
[01:52:44] the track now the race is going to be in
[01:52:46] if we're prayer in the Death Race this
[01:52:49] one is not just here guys this is the
[01:52:50] longest race that we have is around the
[01:52:53] whole Florida Wasteland from here Canal
[01:52:57] over even Tampa and back are you ready
[01:53:00] for this race are you
[01:53:03] ready
[01:53:12] Oblivion Frank's back so we decided to
[01:53:16] go
[01:53:18] in all
[01:53:20] right and we have this going on right
[01:53:23] now you have the we said we're going to
[01:53:26] go for the race so we're going to go
[01:53:29] race you have any last preparations you
[01:53:32] want to
[01:53:40] do Fran Here
[01:54:01] you take back over
[01:54:10] Frank quite frankly sometimes the having
[01:54:13] the
[01:54:14] inspections are stupid in many ways but
[01:54:17] not having them is stupid in many ways
[01:54:22] I think they they're kind of like needed
[01:54:25] but not at the same time like you need
[01:54:26] to know them that they're weren't
[01:54:27] they're
[01:54:28] working but that's about it they need to
[01:54:31] know that they're safe and working they
[01:54:32] don't need to do much beyond that but
[01:54:36] whatever you walk around you getting
[01:54:38] ready for your car getting go to the pit
[01:54:40] get your stuff ready with your vehicle
[01:54:42] you see other ones in there hanging out
[01:54:43] getting their vehicles ready like I said
[01:54:46] I'm going to be done here shortly so we
[01:54:48] might actually end up being done here at
[01:54:49] the end of the at the end of this thing
[01:54:51] here in the pit
[01:54:55] oh there're scary cars in New England
[01:54:57] though too trust me doesn't matter the C
[01:55:00] it's more a
[01:55:06] driver pck crew yeah you're in the pit
[01:55:10] now do you need to you want to do
[01:55:11] anything to fix up your vehicle or do
[01:55:13] you think your humy is ready to go
[01:55:22] you come buy something all right all
[01:55:27] right exactly any b car could be scary
[01:55:29] with the right driver you want to find
[01:55:31] some dirt tires are you looking around
[01:55:33] and go hey I'm trying to find some dirt
[01:55:34] tires
[01:55:35] now go up to the mechanics looking
[01:55:37] around you see some tires but none of
[01:55:40] them seem to fit your vehicle
[01:55:43] correctly it's not good so do you want
[01:55:46] to continue on here with the tires that
[01:55:48] you have or do you want to like uh maybe
[01:55:51] try to find some side quests so you can
[01:55:55] get some new tires and upgrade them
[01:55:56] before the
[01:56:00] race and I think what we're GNA do here
[01:56:02] is though we're gonna do
[01:56:04] this Frank came in with our giveaway win
[01:56:07] look at
[01:56:12] that here we go Frank side quested all

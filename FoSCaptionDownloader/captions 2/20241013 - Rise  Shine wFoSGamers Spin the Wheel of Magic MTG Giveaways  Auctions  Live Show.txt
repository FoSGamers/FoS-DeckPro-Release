[01:29:33] normally this is sorcery but that's okay
[01:29:36] some people like sorcery let's throw
[01:29:38] pack of sorcery

[01:30:50] as a guess also for our word in the
[01:30:53] background
[01:30:57] The Meta deck well the easiest way to
[01:30:59] win it's not really a specific easy way
[01:31:00] to win because it really depends on
[01:31:01] who's your playing with Supreme that's
[01:31:03] really what it boils down to because if
[01:31:05] you're playing with different decks
[01:31:06] against certain people they have their
[01:31:07] own things and you're going to have to
[01:31:09] you pretty much need to set up your deck
[01:31:10] to have certain type of win conditions
[01:31:13] um so that you know most of the time
[01:31:14] you'll be able to win and you have some
[01:31:16] and then depending on what who you're
[01:31:17] going to be playing have like um some
[01:31:18] side cards that you can trade in and out
[01:31:20] to try to help you out like maybe before
[01:31:23] like the game you see that they have a
[01:31:25] certain commander and you're like all
[01:31:26] right well I'm going to or as a
[01:31:28] commander you play this or if you say
[01:31:29] they played a game last match and their
[01:31:31] deck is this way you might make a couple
[01:31:32] adjustments all right Nick Nick can we
[01:31:36] open this baby up here my friend a lot
[01:31:38] of times we do open these up here for
[01:31:39] you but I like to double check I do like
[01:31:41] to double check and then you get two
[01:31:43] guesses for
[01:31:44] letters two guesses for letters I need
[01:31:46] to lower my voice I'm
[01:31:48] loud I'm
[01:31:49] loud keep get told I'm loud I need to
[01:31:52] lower my voice

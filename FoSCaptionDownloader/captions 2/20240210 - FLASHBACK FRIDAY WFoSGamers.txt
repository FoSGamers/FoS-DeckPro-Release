[00:04:31] it that's just what happened to be the
[00:04:33] last one that was in there I'm actually
[00:04:36] going to change that so that people

[00:04:51] restrictions that's weird that's weird
[00:04:55] how you all doing though today all right
[00:04:56] so that for some reason was acting a
[00:04:58] little weird William earlier today
[00:05:01] opened up we opened the reason why I
[00:05:02] have these open is I had William he
[00:05:04] picked out of one pack and he opened one
[00:05:06] today stop that one him in here please
[00:05:08] not in here with him am I clear Nolan
[00:05:12] yes not in here with him there I don't
[00:05:15] Nolan I don't care what you were trying
[00:05:17] to do not in here with the dog there is
[00:05:19] too much stuff in here for him to ruin
[00:05:22] am I clear I'm not I don't mind if you
[00:05:24] play with him but just just not in
[00:05:26] here Nolan thank you thank you sorry
[00:05:31] sorry took a second there I had to talk
[00:05:32] to talk to Nolan he was playing with a
[00:05:34] dog in here which is fine to play with a
[00:05:36] dog but not when you were throwing a
[00:05:37] ball around that doesn't work hey Iron
[00:05:40] Mike but no yeah I was gonna say William
[00:05:41] opened one of these earlier from 95 from
[00:05:44] before he was
[00:05:45] born well before he was
[00:05:48] born but I get a whole box of
[00:05:51] those thought I got something figured
[00:05:53] I'd get something from back when I was a
[00:05:56] uh back when I was a kid that I
[00:05:58] remembered going to the store and
[00:05:59] picking up I don't know I thought it
[00:06:02] would be
[00:06:03] interesting King trash how's it
[00:06:06] going so what I'm going to do here then
[00:06:09] is I'm going to throw on some
[00:06:12] uh I'm G do this
[00:06:14] here actually I'm gonna do this
[00:06:18] here so we can try maybe the uh the
[00:06:22] button animations
[00:06:24] out maybe the button animation's out
[00:06:26] we'll
[00:06:27] see do the big blue book with still
[00:06:31] has 15 of the spots our uh five of the
[00:06:34] spot floors have been hit so it's still
[00:06:37] open here with a lot of blank spots and
[00:06:39] all those blank spots are merged at
[00:06:40] Carlo Manor collector boosters so if you
[00:06:43] don't get a good one of the cards and
[00:06:45] one of the blank spots currently until I
[00:06:46] refill it I was going to do at the end
[00:06:48] of the day today I'm going to refill it
[00:06:49] for tomorrow for the uh thing tomorrow
[00:06:53] you're going to get uh one of those
[00:06:54] collector boosters but that's what we
[00:06:56] got there maybe you want that Bin's tomb
[00:06:59] maybe you want the temple
[00:07:01] Garden I don't know the top one's still
[00:07:03] in there they're still good cards plus
[00:07:05] all the collector boosters you could get
[00:07:07] for any of the empty blank spots so
[00:07:10] every time the book gets the wheel is
[00:07:12] spun oh the wheel's not up give me a
[00:07:15] second every time the wheel is spun you
[00:07:18] actually uh end up getting better odds
[00:07:20] and it's ends up being a better price
[00:07:22] for you a better deal for you because
[00:07:24] with the more spots available blank
[00:07:27] spots that's the more collect boosters
[00:07:29] you get and noan yes what's up buddy
[00:07:33] what if all the spots on the thing get
[00:07:36] um empty they're not going to be all
[00:07:37] empty because they're all in there only
[00:07:41] they stay in there forever the spots are
[00:07:43] always going to stay there that's a
[00:07:44] randomizer up in the corner all the
[00:07:46] cards and there will be oh we're going
[00:07:48] to reset it if they happen to be all
[00:07:49] empty if all 81 things are pulled and
[00:07:52] it's empty well it wouldn't be empty
[00:07:54] there would be 81 there's I think
[00:07:55] there's like 50 things left to pull or
[00:07:57] six 70 left to pull but if they all get
[00:07:59] pulled then I'd stop the book and we
[00:08:03] would restart it the next time that I
[00:08:05] fill it put different and we'd refill it
[00:08:07] with different things correct yeah sorry
[00:08:10] we had some
[00:08:11] questions and now guys remember you can
[00:08:14] always check the show
[00:08:15] notes you should be able to see that
[00:08:17] which would explain everything going on

[00:27:13] three-pack
[00:27:14] deal how's it going
[00:27:17] Lord how's it going Lord we are just
[00:27:20] putting up a pack deal for you guys if
[00:27:22] you want to try it

[00:27:28] here three packs on
[00:27:33] screen we're going to go for
[00:27:38] this and remember guys I got some
[00:27:41] stuff some older stuff that we just got
[00:27:44] in tried it

[00:27:51] thing I remember going to Matt Sports
[00:27:55] Plus and buying packs of it
[00:27:58] figured i' try it out now and see if
[00:28:00] anybody else wanted to try their luck on
[00:28:02] some packs with us
[00:28:04] today but it's been kind of slow
[00:28:06] recently I think people are saving
[00:28:08] up for um next month or something as
[00:28:11] what my guess
[00:28:13] is which might be a bad thing for me
[00:28:16] because I'm gonna have to figure out how
[00:28:18] to purchase everything that I got if I
[00:28:20] don't sell every a lot of stuff here
[00:28:23] we'll see what happens we'll see what

[00:28:30] Fallout personally I got uh three cases
[00:28:32] of it
[00:28:34] so we'll see what happens I think I'll
[00:28:37] have some good luck here but at the same
[00:28:39] time I do have to see what happens with
[00:28:41] our stuff that we do have

[00:53:19] up that's going to be like that's going
[00:53:21] to try to be my animations for my next
[00:53:24] two I got I I got these two I got two
[00:53:26] more animations to be made here but here
[00:53:29] we go we're going to do this again here
[00:53:30] we're going to do this you know what try
[00:53:31] the big blue book
[00:53:33] here I'm G to show you guys the Big Blue
[00:53:35] Book just so you guys are aware of what
[00:53:37] it is and you get to see it this is
[00:53:39] awesome and also we get to do some
[00:53:41] animations with our red button if you
[00:53:44] want to try yourself to be lucky now our
[00:53:46] big glue book it was
[00:53:48] 222
[00:53:50] $2,222 but every time a spot is pulled
[00:53:53] it becomes a collector boost Boer of
[00:53:56] murders at Carlo Manor so that actually
[00:53:57] price goes up and that average ends up
[00:53:59] going up because there's like 25 spots
[00:54:02] of murders at Carlo manners now that you
[00:54:04] could pull out of here because they're
[00:54:05] blank spots now the $90 ceiling is is
[00:54:08] the balin's tomb floors are cars between
[00:54:10] 11 and $20 you got nine of them between
[00:54:13] 15 and 20 10 between 11 14 of those 19
[00:54:17] five have been hit so these are like we
[00:54:20] got we get for cards here maybe you get
[00:54:22] yourself a force of negation maybe you
[00:54:24] get your s that everybody lives maybe
[00:54:26] hit a blank spot but you know what maybe
[00:54:27] like I had that ashod alter and dang
[00:54:29] it's a $10 card but that's okay because
[00:54:33] you get your choice of any one
[00:54:37] of where is it you know what where it go
[00:54:42] oh I sold the last one all right any one
[00:54:45] of these collector
[00:54:48] boosters uh and if you happen to get one
[00:54:51] that is under $5 say you get that
[00:54:53] emerging ultimatum that's okay because
[00:54:56] you get any one any two of
[00:54:59] these any one of these plus any one of
[00:55:04] these or a collector booster of Dungeons
[00:55:07] and Dragons so you it's really really
[00:55:10] hard to lose with the big blue book here

[01:07:09] like you said the SWAT team's there so

[01:43:19] looking for giveaways today which is
[01:43:20] believe why I'm always slow but that's
[01:43:25] okay I don't do many giveaways because I
[01:43:27] try to give really good deals as best I
[01:43:29] can that way I don't really have the
[01:43:32] funds for regular giveaways I only do it
[01:43:34] when we did like a raid and stuff let's
[01:43:36] do a big blue book here before I reset
[01:43:39] it I'm probably gonna end up resetting
[01:43:40] this tonight probably I'll bounce off
[01:43:43] here and reset this
[01:43:45] tonight see uh see what you guys think
[01:43:47] about it tomorrow with some new cards in
[01:43:49] there but right now this is your best
[01:43:53] chance of not hitting a floor and
[01:43:55] hitting a collector booster if you want
[01:44:00] one because you're right now you get a
[01:44:02] murd at Carlo Manor collector booster
[01:44:05] with any of the blank spots in the book
[01:44:06] here all right any of the blank spots in
[01:44:09] the book here it is ur the Carlo maner
[01:44:11] collector booster don't do that
[01:44:14] again squish you can squish them but
[01:44:16] don't do that
[01:44:17] again then you have these here maybe you
[01:44:20] want to get one of the cards maybe
[01:44:21] you're lucky and you you get uh our
[01:44:25] balin's tomb as
[01:44:28] our
[01:44:30] ceiling maybe pull out a temple Garden
[01:44:32] that's a nice little card there but all
[01:44:34] these blanks though maybe get that
[01:44:36] ristic study maybe AA maybe a Lord of
[01:44:39] the Rings collector booster all of these
[01:44:41] blank spots though are currently
[01:44:43] collector boosters of murders at carw
[01:44:46] Manor maybe you uh maybe you do happen
[01:44:49] to get one of the person that gets the
[01:44:50] low which is a low is an Overgrown Tomb
[01:44:52] right now so that's what we're talking
[01:44:54] about here with that you guys say you
[01:44:56] want some games we made some new games
[01:44:59] for you hopefully you like them seem to
[01:45:02] like them just
[01:45:10] doctor
[01:45:12] alrighty
[01:45:14] Nolan um I think actually we're going to
[01:45:16] say no on the popping maybe after after
[01:45:19] the show definitely yes I po one more
[01:45:21] one more one more all right there you go
[01:45:25] popped one
[01:45:26] more let's
[01:45:32] see I don't know what you guys want
[01:45:34] because I put up so much stuff and no
[01:45:36] one's telling me what they want so I'm
[01:45:37] just doing random things and I think
[01:45:39] that's the problem either no one wants
[01:45:41] what I'm putting up or uh no one has the
[01:45:44] funds or no one I don't know I'm not
[01:45:48] sure yet I haven't figured it out out
[01:45:50] I'm trying to do uh trying to do
[01:45:52] different things for you lower medium
[01:45:56] price ones some high price
[01:45:58] ones so I'm trying to put them all over
[01:46:00] the place maybe you guys will have
[01:46:02] something there intriguing but also
[01:46:04] remember what I put up here it's just
[01:46:06] the packs that I'm pulling out so you
[01:46:08] can do the same thing and I will get you
[01:46:10] a pack deal if you go and you look at my
[01:46:12] buy now go yo give me these three packs
[01:46:15] I'll do that put it together for you
[01:46:16] because that helps me out with whatnot
[01:46:18] fees whenever I'm helped with not P I
[01:46:21] pass that savings on to you guys which
[01:46:24] is why where I get to do these
[01:46:25] three-pack deals the way I do it helps
[01:46:28] me save on those fees so I like I said I
[01:46:31] just I pass those savings on
[01:46:33] you so right now the on screen three
[01:46:37] pack here we're gonna put that on for

[01:46:56] in my car I have to get a better one
[01:46:59] here that can uh connect to my computer
[01:47:01] so every time I press it it just works

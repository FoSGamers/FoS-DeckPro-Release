Learn about FoSGamers on WhatNot. Analyze everything that they do. Then, learn about them on YouTube. Analyze all the pages and all the videos that they have made. Every single 400 of the videos, I would like you to analyze. Then, I would like you to analyze them on Instagram, and every single post that they have made. Not just one or two of them, all 500 posts that have been made. Then, analyze on Facebook. Do all the same, all the posts. Then, on... TikTok, and then on X, or Twitter. Do the same for all those. Analyze FoSGamers and know it completely. Once you know them completely, then I need you to generate a website for them. One that will draw people in to want to participate and buy FoSGamers products through their live streams that they do. Or just from the store, from watching the live streams.

I need you to analyze FOSGamers even more further to see know exactly what they are selling regularly on a regular basis over the past year that they have been doing this selling. Analyze everything that they've sold, boxes they open and that type of stuff so that you know what type of stuff that they sell. Specifically, sell Lorkana trading cards, Magic the Gathering trading cards, and Sorcery trading cards. Magic the Gathering is the primary thing though that is used at the moment.

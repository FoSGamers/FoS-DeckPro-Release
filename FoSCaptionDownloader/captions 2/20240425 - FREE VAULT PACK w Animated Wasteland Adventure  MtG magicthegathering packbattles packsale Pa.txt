[00:15:49] buddy got anything going on
[00:15:54] Mike wait change your name
[00:16:00] I like it now I have a question is your
[00:16:02] name like should I call you Mike or
[00:16:05] Kenji like what is the name that I
[00:16:06] should be calling
[00:16:11] you it's one of those things where like
[00:16:13] I had a friend growing up that um he
[00:16:17] came over from
[00:16:18] Sweden he was in Middle School for uh
[00:16:21] two years while his parents was doing
[00:16:23] some type of work here and when he was
[00:16:25] here in middle school when he first came
[00:16:27] over he told everybody his name was
[00:16:28] Jacob and like all right hey Jacob but
[00:16:30] he happened to live down the street from
[00:16:31] me and like probably like six seven
[00:16:34] houses down so I'd go over and I'd play
[00:16:37] with him I went over to play with him
[00:16:38] one time and he um he was like Hey his
[00:16:42] parents were calling him yakob I'm like
[00:16:44] they kept calling yakob and he'd turn
[00:16:46] around he'd say whatever and talk to
[00:16:47] them like [ __ ] is yakob the first time
[00:16:49] they kept saying I'm like who is yakob
[00:16:50] I'm looking around is there like another
[00:16:52] sibling that I'm aware of and then
[00:16:55] finally I asked him like probably like
[00:16:57] after like the third or fourth time like
[00:16:59] hey are they calling you yakob he goes
[00:17:02] yeah that's my name oh no it wasn't
[00:17:04] Sweden it was
[00:17:06] um it might have been maybe it was
[00:17:09] Finland damn it it was so long ago over
[00:17:13] 30 years ago this is how old I am but
[00:17:15] anyways one of those countries over
[00:17:17] there and he said that was oh his name
[00:17:20] was yob not Jacob but he made it easy
[00:17:23] for Americans to understand and his
[00:17:25] parents gave him choices of names when
[00:17:26] they were coming over that were similar
[00:17:28] to his own and he chose Jacob I'm like
[00:17:32] interesting okay all right I'm like do
[00:17:35] you want me to call you Jacob or yakob
[00:17:37] and he goes I don't care whichever one I
[00:17:39] mean yakob is my real name so I started
[00:17:41] calling him yakob and he like he said
[00:17:44] I'm like do you mind if I do that he's
[00:17:45] no actually I like that so I was calling
[00:17:47] him that for for a while while we hang
[00:17:49] out there like and I started calling
[00:17:50] that school and somebody else picked it
[00:17:51] up and then after school eventually his
[00:17:53] name went to his real name yakob and
[00:17:55] everyone was good with it it was like
[00:17:56] one of the coolest it was one of those
[00:17:57] weird scenarios where like
[00:18:00] not he did tell other people too so
[00:18:02] other people were using them because
[00:18:03] other people that were friends with him
[00:18:04] would go over and play but it was also
[00:18:06] like like he didn't tell everybody but
[00:18:08] his few friends that he did tell like
[00:18:10] would say his name and then everybody
[00:18:11] realized oh this is the person's
[00:18:13] name hey mik look what I pulled out
[00:18:26] earlier I know dude

[00:20:09] bags not having the um floor ceilings in
[00:20:14] average it's because when I did a
[00:20:17] combination of
[00:20:19] them I guess you're not allowed to do a
[00:20:21] combination of
[00:20:23] things nothing says that in the in their
[00:20:25] rules I have double checked it multiple
[00:20:27] times so I would recommend any of you
[00:20:30] never combine
[00:20:32] items never combine items because
[00:20:35] someone will [ __ ]
[00:20:39] you that's all I'm going to say
[00:20:44] there did they what did what was
[00:20:52] it oh I need the old ones I need the old
[00:20:56] ones [ __ ] cuz I copy the ones this
[00:20:59] morning that they sent me no wonder why
[00:21:01] they sent them to me this morning those
[00:21:04] [ __ ] well there's nothing in
[00:21:06] them that says you can't combine
[00:21:12] things but anyways I also have um I I
[00:21:15] also have a lawyer because I had to get
[00:21:17] one anyways to address how to make the
[00:21:19] games to make sure I'm not having any
[00:21:21] issues in the F future which is the way
[00:21:23] I why I've been doing the way I've been
[00:21:24] doing them so um I would say um
[00:21:29] yeah I actually um I'm actually have a
[00:21:30] lawyer that I'm I'll have to address
[00:21:32] that with I need to find the old ones
[00:21:39] now I'm just going to put one thing out
[00:21:41] here for an
[00:21:44] adventure oh
[00:21:46] no that's not
[00:21:49] right that is [ __ ] hilarious that is
[00:21:52] actually that actually helps me helps me
[00:21:54] a lot by the way how did you get that
[00:21:57] ter did they send you a message
[00:22:02] [Music]
[00:22:12] that's funny I caught them in a lie and
[00:22:14] they had to update their terms of
[00:22:15] service by the way just throwing that
[00:22:18] one out there for everybody
[00:22:24] involved I'm going to have to see if I
[00:22:26] can find that
[00:22:34] yeah if you can um send it to me I would
[00:22:36] appreciate it
[00:23:02] CU I don't see anything sent to me about
[00:23:04] being
[00:23:05] updated unless they're just Flack black
[00:23:08] ball me
[00:23:10] so all s it thank you
[00:23:19] yeah all right cool thank you I
[00:23:21] appreciate it hey Gustavo how you doing
[00:23:24] I appreciate that a lot Bud because uh I
[00:23:28] think uh I think I might C I think I
[00:23:30] caught them in a line they had to update
[00:23:32] their terms of service which is good for
[00:23:33] me because that means my lawyer will
[00:23:35] have
[00:23:39] fire they don't realize I already went
[00:23:41] to one to make sure that my games were
[00:23:43] in the um within their
[00:23:45] rules so now they're just [ __ ] me
[00:23:47] around another way in this one at least
[00:23:49] with their updating stuff after the
[00:23:52] fact I might actually have caught them
[00:23:55] they might have be screwing themselves
[00:23:56] by updating the rules by the way
[00:24:04] that's kind of funny not bad Gustavo
[00:24:07] thank you I appreciate it let me take a
[00:24:08] look
[00:24:15] [Music]
[00:24:22] here ah won't let me open it why won't

[00:24:44] address go away
[00:24:50] Siri can you do that instead so that I
[00:24:53] can see it cuz uh for whatever reason
[00:24:54] it's not let me copy
[00:24:56] it thank you let anyone wants to jump in
[00:24:59] on one of the games here we got that
[00:25:06] going yeah moving the gold post after
[00:25:08] start exactly but they legally you can't
[00:25:11] actually do that by the way when it
[00:25:13] comes to Law related
[00:25:14] stuff so they actually need to um if
[00:25:17] they change the goal post after um doing
[00:25:20] something they are going to either
[00:25:23] they're getting get in a lot of trouble
[00:25:24] and if they've been doing that to other
[00:25:26] people um that's a class action lawsuit
[00:25:29] against
[00:25:31] him so uh I did make a comment on I made
[00:25:34] a Reddit post cuz I got my wife said you
[00:25:37] know reach out to people see what's
[00:25:38] going on if anybody else has had that
[00:25:40] going on and just give them the evidence
[00:25:42] and um no one El we've had a couple
[00:25:44] people that had similar situations but
[00:25:46] not exactly so I'm wondering if there's
[00:25:48] anyone that can uh to address it thank
[00:25:51] you Mike I appreciate that I see that
[00:25:53] just came in
[00:26:02] thank you very much
[00:26:11] bud yesterday at 10:03
[00:26:15] a.m. cool thank you and even still when
[00:26:18] you look in this it does not
[00:26:20] say um combining anything about
[00:26:23] combining
[00:26:32] the only thing it says is that it has to
[00:26:33] have a com a fair market value all the
[00:26:37] combined items have to have a fair
[00:26:38] market value nothing says anything about
[00:26:40] you can't combine stuff still because I
[00:26:43] had specifically looked through it cuz I
[00:26:44] actually build this type of um I build
[00:26:46] applications that make this
[00:26:47] documentation for a large legal
[00:26:49] organization a lot larger than whatnot
[00:26:52] can like make what not look silly
[00:26:54] compared to the size they are sorry
[00:26:55] again for saying the name but um none of
[00:26:58] their information has what uh I did in
[00:27:00] there so I I still uh still trying to
[00:27:03] figure out what
[00:27:06] happened oh no it's oh it's not in the
[00:27:09] scenario that I have put it it is
[00:27:21] not oh yes I see what you're saying I
[00:27:25] see what you're saying
[00:27:26] Gustavo well the thing is so I wonder if
[00:27:29] we combine them it because it will allow
[00:27:31] you to combine
[00:27:32] orders um it says like I know it says
[00:27:36] like um you can bundle them because when
[00:27:37] people get multiple things it does
[00:27:39] bundle
[00:27:43] them thank you I do appreciate that Mike
[00:27:45] I appreciate you sending that to me a
[00:27:46] lot um so I I mean we can see if U I'm
[00:27:49] not sure if it'll work but I mean we can
[00:27:52] I I'll tempt I'll attempt it but either
[00:27:55] way you know what I'll do um I'll throw
[00:27:56] you something in if we can't I'll throw
[00:27:58] you a little something just because it's
[00:27:59] a big large a large amount for um
[00:28:02] shipping I'll get I'll see what I can
[00:28:04] get you uh from my Personal Collection
[00:28:06] just a little thank you for hanging out
[00:28:07] all the time
[00:28:10] thing but let's put this out here for
[00:28:13] all of you that want to come
[00:28:16] in try out maybe the um Adventure game
[00:28:20] with some
[00:28:21] uh
[00:28:24] ioria and maybe a uh
[00:28:29] ioria in a modern Horizon Deuce modern
[00:28:33] Horizon
[00:28:36] deu all right put that on
[00:28:42] there and then we're going to put that
[00:28:44] on for
[00:28:52] this
[00:28:54] no why did that do that because my
[00:28:57] finger hit that that's why that did
[00:28:59] that start that auction again for a
[00:29:01] minute now if somebody wants to jump in
[00:29:03] on it I will run it earlier and quicker
[00:29:05] it is Adventure
[00:29:08] Time yeah I know it it's wicked wordy
[00:29:11] Mike that I've uh I even had to go
[00:29:14] through it a couple times because I
[00:29:16] write that docu I don't I like I um for
[00:29:18] the most part write an update
[00:29:19] documentation like that on a regular I
[00:29:21] don't write it people write it send it
[00:29:22] to me I have to read it update it write
[00:29:25] it into a system so that it will build
[00:29:26] it on on an automatic basis for any
[00:29:30] situation that comes out based on
[00:29:32] whatever a lawyer's needs are so it will
[00:29:34] combine all those things into one like
[00:29:36] form um so I read that stuff on a
[00:29:39] regular basis that's why I went through
[00:29:40] it a couple times to make I'm like
[00:29:42] there's nothing in here about you can't
[00:29:43] combine orders and I keep looking
[00:29:45] through I keep looking through I keep
[00:29:46] looking through them like there's
[00:29:47] nothing in here that says you cannot
[00:29:48] combine
[00:29:50] things it says You must have all of the
[00:29:54] everything listed which I do but nothing
[00:29:57] says you are not allowed allowed to
[00:29:58] combine
[00:30:00] items when it is requested or people
[00:30:03] want it which is what I did I said do
[00:30:05] people want to combine these want
[00:30:07] something conect a couple of these could
[00:30:09] together somebody said yes I ran
[00:30:14] it nothing says you can't do that and
[00:30:17] I've looked at it multiple times so
[00:30:19] that's why I'm bringing it to who I like
[00:30:21] the person that helped me out with the
[00:30:22] with the games initially I'm going to
[00:30:24] bring it to them and see what they say
[00:30:28] about it and I've also see what
[00:30:37] happens oh nice Mike
[00:30:40] awesome I love that see um I have I have
[00:30:44] um I have a I know this is going to
[00:30:46] sound probably people say this all the
[00:30:48] time I had uh between a couple of people
[00:30:51] that I know um that I've grown up with
[00:30:53] my entire life one is a lawyer and I
[00:30:56] people that are in medical stuff um they
[00:30:58] were like they were always like dude you
[00:30:59] need to you should be doing different
[00:31:01] things than what I do currently like you
[00:31:03] mean he's like you you could easily be a
[00:31:04] lawyer or one of them like dude you know
[00:31:07] all this medical stuff cuz I was a I was
[00:31:08] a Premed major in college like yeah well
[00:31:11] I didn't want to have a bunch of a bunch
[00:31:12] of debt he's like well you know you're
[00:31:13] not going to do that you could you could
[00:31:14] easily been on gone on and be a doctor
[00:31:16] you know you didn't go to
[00:31:18] class and you'd show up for a test and
[00:31:20] get an A and the teacher would just
[00:31:22] shake his head as he walked out and like
[00:31:25] yeah it was just easy I knew it and he's
[00:31:27] like like but then they have another
[00:31:29] friend that's a lawyer that's like Dude
[00:31:31] every single time anything comes up
[00:31:32] you're able to find the solution or the
[00:31:34] answer to be able to fight it if you
[00:31:36] know you were right or if you know
[00:31:37] something was wrong or whatever it
[00:31:39] is um I didn't want to have like a
[00:31:42] million or two $2 million in debt and um
[00:31:45] long story short my father passed away
[00:31:48] the my senior year at College um and
[00:31:52] like the last two weeks um so two two
[00:31:55] things I didn't want to have a million

[00:32:54] said I didn't I didn't um I didn't do
[00:32:56] the last paper and she's like well

[00:34:00] not coming back you want me to repeat it
[00:34:02] for you dumb [ __ ] and I walked out and
[00:34:04] I never went
[00:34:06] back that was the that was the end of my
[00:34:08] experience there cuz she was failing me
[00:34:11] for literally I had a 70 in the class on
[00:34:15] out of over a 70 and she failed me so
[00:34:19] that's the one of the beginnings of my
[00:34:20] one of the starts of the [ __ ] that
[00:34:21] I've had to deal with in my
[00:34:24] life yeah not today not today that [ __ ]
[00:34:27] wouldn't fly a lot that would be all
[00:34:28] over online and anything like that and
[00:34:30] people would be up and down the [ __ ]
[00:34:32] walls of [ __ ] I know but it happened to
[00:34:34] me too long ago before that [ __ ] so I
[00:34:37] don't have that I never have that
[00:34:38] opportunity you
[00:34:41] know but yeah that was uh my long story
[00:34:44] that became my long story short that
[00:34:46] became
[00:34:48] longer but yeah that's what happened
[00:34:50] there I got a little screwed but what
[00:34:53] can you do just go along with life I did
[00:34:56] and I've made a pretty good life for
[00:34:57] myself so I'm not upset about it I'm
[00:35:00] just the a few changes in the recent
[00:35:02] jobs I've not been I'm not happy with
[00:35:04] like with things that have gone with
[00:35:05] jobs it's not bad just not what I I
[00:35:08] signed up for initially type thing you
[00:35:10] know what I
[00:35:10] mean that makes any
[00:35:19] sense me remove some of these things
[00:35:21] here CU they keep showing up
[00:35:25] everyone remove those there too many I
[00:35:28] don't know what I'm looking
[00:35:32] at yeah I've dealt with a bit of [ __ ] in
[00:35:35] my
[00:35:36] life I can go back even further to the
[00:35:39] other the one of the first like kind of
[00:35:40] [ __ ] things that most people would be
[00:35:42] like I can't believe that even happened
[00:35:44] so I went to an all guys High
[00:35:46] School want to take a guess about one
[00:35:49] thing that occurred
[00:36:00] well say somebody got in
[00:36:07] trouble we just leave it at
[00:36:11] that you can try to figure it out
[00:36:13] yourself if you want it's pretty
[00:36:18] straightforward so started my life out
[00:36:20] not so
[00:36:24] fun but I built pretty good stuff with
[00:36:27] it which is part of the reason why I
[00:36:28] want to leave this [ __ ] country and
[00:36:29] get on a boat and get the hell out of
[00:36:30] here I don't trust
[00:36:33] anyone never trusted people for a long
[00:36:39] time hey Doc thanks I appreciate
[00:36:47] that St off to Soap Box there I
[00:36:50] know so then uh some other shitty things

[00:37:09] out of

[00:37:13] you can deal with the [ __ ] and I think
[00:37:15] this time my wife finally got enough
[00:37:17] [ __ ] to that she doesn't want to deal
[00:37:18] with it the same as me she's like I
[00:37:21] think she's fin like all right I think
[00:37:22] I'm done with
[00:37:24] this cuz we've had a plan to go on a
[00:37:27] boat in sale for years but um she has
[00:37:31] never
[00:37:33] uh she's never um actually made
[00:37:37] it to want to because she's like kind of
[00:37:40] been scared but we did uh we did the we
[00:37:42] did a little trip and she got used to a
[00:37:44] boat and she actually liked it and then
[00:37:47] uh something happened with her work that
[00:37:48] she's like great this is going to be fun
[00:37:51] so same situ you know run run into crap
[00:37:53] everywhere and you know life happens
[00:37:55] what can you say right

[00:38:24] making a bunch of changes she's going to
[00:38:26] like a new whole division is breaking up
[00:38:28] and stuff like that so she's like not
[00:38:29] necessarily unhappy but she's not
[00:38:31] necessarily happy if that makes sense so
[00:38:33] it was one of those you know what if we
[00:38:35] find everything that we want to that'll
[00:38:37] work for us I think we'll leave we'll do
[00:38:39] the boat thing if that makes yeah that's
[00:38:41] kind of like what she was at that point
[00:38:43] like and then talked us about some other
[00:38:44] things and she was like you know what
[00:38:45] ask me if we want to go and she's like
[00:38:47] yeah let's do
[00:38:48] it so we're putting effort into it now
[00:38:51] versus
[00:38:53] not that way we can go and have some fun
[00:38:56] traveling around the the world you know
[00:38:59] what I'm going to do is uh my wife
[00:39:00] actually wants to record it and do
[00:39:02] [ __ ] YouTube stuff so maybe you guys
[00:39:04] will see us on there who
[00:39:06] knows she said she's going to record it
[00:39:08] with the camera that I have since I
[00:39:09] bought a new camera to use for this
[00:39:10] thing and we're not going to be using it
[00:39:17] anymore yeah this changes for the better
[00:39:20] well no it's not for the better when you
[00:39:22] put somebody and you do things that like
[00:39:24] she's going to end up being forced to do
[00:39:25] stuff that was that she wasn't hired to
[00:39:27] do
[00:39:28] and she's already admitted she's like I
[00:39:29] don't know if I want to do that crap
[00:39:31] like that's not what I was hired to do I
[00:39:32] didn't get hired to do that and that's
[00:39:34] why I have the job that I'm at if I
[00:39:35] wanted the job this job that they're
[00:39:36] going to probably put me to I wouldn't
[00:39:38] even apply to it and that's one of those
[00:39:41] though but she's like I'll do it I'm
[00:39:43] going to do my great best at it because
[00:39:44] that's the type of person I am but it's
[00:39:46] just the scenario is not in a situation
[00:39:48] that I wanted to be
[00:39:52] in oh the mic
[00:39:56] muted the mic muted no it didn't it's
[00:39:58] still on you guys can hear me it's back
[00:40:03] okay yeah so yeah I don't
[00:40:08] know that's what we deal with here but
[00:40:11] luckily it actually gave my life a
[00:40:13] little boat to do something I've haven't
[00:40:14] getting learn to do for a while and she
[00:40:16] seems to be on
[00:40:17] board we'll see if she actually is or
[00:40:21] not see if she actually is or not this
[00:40:24] is a question that I uh I I have had for
[00:40:27] a while we'll see these are the gies
[00:40:30] that we got up right here right now as
[00:40:31] the day goes if maybe we get some good
[00:40:33] sales going some things running maybe
[00:40:35] we'll do a maybe we'll do a little
[00:40:40] extra going throw maybe a mystery bag
[00:40:43] here we'll throw out some mystery bags
[00:40:45] three of
[00:40:47] them at that for that let's do that
[00:40:56] there yeah but I've uh I bet if I went
[00:40:59] through the list of crap that I've dealt
[00:41:00] with in life people would be how the
[00:41:01] [ __ ] are you even here I've actually I'm
[00:41:04] surprised I've been alive a couple of
[00:41:05] situations I've lived through that most
[00:41:07] people wouldn't
[00:41:09] have which is another reason why I've
[00:41:11] come to the conclusion I think I'm like
[00:41:13] a [ __ ] demigod or something like that
[00:41:15] cuz I don't know how the hell you can
[00:41:16] hit a tree at [ __ ] 80 miles hour and
[00:41:22] live that one was
[00:41:24] intriguing everyone that saw the car was
[00:41:26] like there's no [ __ ] way this guy's
[00:41:30] alive dude the only thing I had was my
[00:41:32] face was a little messed up the steering
[00:41:34] calling hit me in the face so my lip was
[00:41:36] ripped off and my and you could see in
[00:41:37] my nose but they stitched everything
[00:41:39] back together and I'm
[00:41:41] fine I bit my tongue almost in half I
[00:41:45] mean I mean like the [ __ ] that happens
[00:41:47] they're like there's no [ __ ] way this
[00:41:49] good dude's alive and then they go
[00:41:50] [ __ ] is still alive he gets out
[00:41:51] of the car and he's
[00:41:53] walking like all right there's a couple
[00:41:56] other people in it so I had to make sure
[00:41:58] they were okay I got out of the car and
[00:41:59] like making sure everyone's okay
[00:42:01] spitting blood all over the place cuz my
[00:42:02] face ripped apart but they're all
[00:42:08] fine that was the first time I had a
[00:42:12] seizure found out I had seizures that
[00:42:14] day
[00:42:27] dude you can definitely defy death
[00:42:29] sometimes yes you can you can definitely
[00:42:32] defy death
[00:42:34] sometimes like I don't I like that was
[00:42:36] one of those scenarios where it was they
[00:42:38] like people in the car like he was doing
[00:42:39] fine all of a sudden he just slumped
[00:42:41] over and like twitched a little bit and
[00:42:43] then we went off the road into a tree
[00:42:45] I'm like I don't even [ __ ] know what
[00:42:47] happened like I was out I was like out
[00:42:49] like then then after a while we after
[00:42:51] like the next 6 months later I I was
[00:42:53] diagnosed with epilepsy they're like you
[00:42:55] probably had your first seizure like oh
[00:42:57] awesome that's great now it's under
[00:43:00] control and I don't have seizures
[00:43:01] anymore because I didn't actually have
[00:43:02] epilepsy I had an internal bleed that
[00:43:04] was ignored for decades when I told him
[00:43:07] I'm bleeding on a regular basis that was
[00:43:09] causing me so that when I had any
[00:43:11] excessive internal bleeds and I was like
[00:43:12] hey I'm not feeling good I'm kind of
[00:43:13] tired well that was because they had no
[00:43:16] oxygen in my blood and that lack of
[00:43:17] oxygen went to my brain and I had a
[00:43:19] seizur because I had no brain
[00:43:23] oxygen that's what the doctor figured
[00:43:25] out down here in Florida after um I know
[00:43:27] 20 some odd years of having seizures
[00:43:30] they gave me iron and and blood so that
[00:43:32] I had more iron and oxygen in my blood
[00:43:36] and I have not had a seizure or felt
[00:43:38] like I was going to have one in over
[00:43:40] three years since they figured that
[00:43:48] out well actually I hadn't had one for
[00:43:50] years before that because I was
[00:43:52] medicated but I'm actually off some of
[00:43:53] the medication now because of what they
[00:43:55] figured out
[00:44:00] yeah that is good to hear actually yeah
[00:44:01] so like things some things do get better
[00:44:03] but I mean that's kind of the [ __ ] that
[00:44:04] I had to deal with is people literally
[00:44:06] ignoring me and my symptoms when I'm
[00:44:09] saying guys I this is another one of
[00:44:11] those scenarios where I'm going to be a
[00:44:12] little bit [ __ ] cocky here um I don't
[00:44:16] say this frequently cuz I don't like to
[00:44:18] it sounds cocky U I have an IQ that is
[00:44:21] three points below
[00:44:22] Einstein um I investigate stuff and I
[00:44:26] learn things very quickly and I can
[00:44:27] figure things out quickly um there's a
[00:44:30] reason why I was in med school and I
[00:44:32] figured out a lot of stuff what was
[00:44:33] wrong with me I actually looked at all
[00:44:36] the tests that they were doing every
[00:44:37] time they R WI a test and I looked at
[00:44:39] the results I actually figured out um
[00:44:42] when I was in the hospital the first
[00:44:44] time I asked them why is my blood levels
[00:44:49] at 10 and dropping sometimes and
[00:44:52] sometimes fluctuating up as a male it is
[00:44:55] supposed to be 13 and above as a female
[00:44:57] could be 10 and Below up to below as
[00:45:00] nine at sometimes when they're having
[00:45:01] their period but only when they are
[00:45:03] having their period so why are you
[00:45:05] saying this is this needs to be ignored
[00:45:07] well that's fine that's fine don't worry
[00:45:09] about it that that can happen at times
[00:45:10] like yes but I have blood coming out
[00:45:12] continuously when I'm having the
[00:45:15] seizures I'm putting these together can
[00:45:17] you investigate this please ignored for
[00:45:21] [ __ ] decades by the Massachusetts ple
[00:45:23] uh all the doctors that I dealt with in
[00:45:24] Massachusetts
[00:45:29] then I moved down to
[00:45:31] Florida doctor goes hey we just going to
[00:45:34] run some tests on you because uh you
[00:45:36] know just some regular tests for you
[00:45:37] being our new patient they run a regular
[00:45:39] test and they go dude your blood level
[00:45:41] is at five for your auction get to the
[00:45:43] hospital now or you're going to die if
[00:45:44] you fall asleep because your heart will
[00:45:46] stop like what do you mean my heart's
[00:45:47] going to stop [ __ ] I'm at the beach
[00:45:50] right now like you need to find a doctor
[00:45:52] cuz if you do anything you might die
[00:45:54] like [ __ ] that [ __ ] get a car go to the
[00:45:56] hospital
[00:45:57] there's literally four doctors and like
[00:46:00] five nurses waiting for me when I get to
[00:46:02] the ER like oh [ __ ] what the [ __ ]
[00:46:04] going on here like you going to get on
[00:46:06] this gurnie they put me on a gurnie they
[00:46:07] strap me in they [ __ ] bring me into
[00:46:09] machines and they get me tested I'm like
[00:46:11] what the hell is going on here I have a
[00:46:13] [ __ ] cancer doctor talking to me
[00:46:14] because they find things in my liver
[00:46:16] like going down the list of [ __ ] luckily
[00:46:18] the cancer stuff was nothing to worry
[00:46:19] about it was just like bullcrap but I'm
[00:46:22] like the [ __ ] is going on
[00:46:24] here this because the doctor's up north
[00:46:27] ignored it to the point that I literally
[00:46:29] almost died because the blood levels
[00:46:31] kept dropping so
[00:46:33] much that I was actually at 5 I was
[00:46:36] living my life probably at 7 which is
[00:46:39] why I was so tired and napping all day
[00:46:41] long um and that's when I was living my
[00:46:45] life at and then I dropped low and
[00:46:47] that's when I would have the seizures
[00:46:49] but I was getting the point that now it
[00:46:50] wasn't even going to be a seizure it was
[00:46:51] just going to be my body was going to
[00:46:52] stop working because there was not
[00:46:54] enough oxygen in it
[00:46:58] but luckily I moved to another state
[00:47:01] 1300 miles away and those doctors look
[00:47:03] at all the symptoms and acknowledge all
[00:47:05] the symptoms like wait that's a little
[00:47:06] bit weird we should probably investigate
[00:47:08] why that's going on and once they did
[00:47:10] that they're like [ __ ] you have an
[00:47:13] extreme anemia case which is causing you
[00:47:14] to have a l loss of oxygen in your brain
[00:47:17] which is causing all the seizures you
[00:47:18] have like really that's [ __ ] that
[00:47:22] you mean like the thing I told them 15
[00:47:25] [ __ ] years ago
[00:47:31] sorry getting on a little bit of rant
[00:47:35] there got a little rant there I'm sorry
[00:47:38] about
[00:47:44] that it's just frustrating because uh
[00:47:47] people at certain situ places and their
[00:47:49] certain positions they think they know
[00:47:51] better or they're better than you for
[00:47:53] whatever reason it is so they don't
[00:47:55] acknowledge you or the things that you
[00:47:56] say
[00:47:57] um and I've had that happen my entire
[00:48:00] life because I my family at one point we
[00:48:02] were homeless um growing up I mean I
[00:48:05] remember one of the first houses I
[00:48:06] remember living is is a trailer I didn't
[00:48:09] realize it was our house because we
[00:48:10] didn't my parents didn't tell us that
[00:48:11] until later in life when they explained
[00:48:14] it TSR and Wasteland I can do that in
[00:48:17] two w wow yes I can do that TSR and two
[00:48:20] wow now do you want W draft or while um
[00:48:23] set
[00:48:29] yeah it's cool to talk BS a little
[00:48:30] bit because I do have set and
[00:48:34] um set and uh
[00:48:38] draft that's why I just didn't know
[00:48:40] which one you
[00:48:48] wanted whichever have more
[00:48:50] of uh they're about even right
[00:48:53] now uh you know what the most I have
[00:48:56] actually is uh sa boosters I just opened
[00:48:58] the box literally just opened the box
[00:49:01] out of those so that's the most that I
[00:49:02] have so we go with those ones put those
[00:49:05] right

[00:49:11] that together for

[00:49:51] sorry sorry sorry sorry being weird
[00:49:57] a lot of [ __ ] that's going on in my life
[00:49:58] which is kind of the reason why I'm
[00:50:01] weird you have to be a little bit weird
[00:50:04] to be able to tolerate that crap
[00:50:11] right dude exactly my wife and people
[00:50:13] have always like why do you joke about

[01:06:10] starting the day out with a $55 hit
[01:06:17] there that was pretty impressive I'd be
[01:06:20] I'd be pretty happy about that one I
[01:06:22] mean you didn't beat the boss so you
[01:06:24] know a little bit upset you didn't know
[01:06:26] to beaten the boss there but then you
[01:06:28] come out and you do this thing where oh
[01:06:30] no it opened I didn't know those could
[01:06:34] open well now we're going to have to
[01:06:36] close that back up and tape that
[01:06:38] together son of a beach these are so old
[01:06:40] all right my mystery things are so
[01:06:42] old that one of them opened I have to
[01:06:46] tape it together my I mean not my
[01:06:48] mystery my
[01:06:49] um my my uh
[01:06:52] Benjamins one of them from 19 uh 1995 it
[01:06:56] looks like the uh the sticky on the
[01:07:00] wrapper is no longer
[01:07:01] [Laughter]
[01:07:07] sticky so I'll put a little piece of
[01:07:09] tape on
[01:07:10] it here you
[01:07:15] go these are things that would be in
[01:07:17] like the
[01:07:18] um in the vault packs or the benjes
[01:07:21] whatever you want to call them just just
[01:07:23] a little sticker pack like these are
[01:07:24] like I was saying like I got these
[01:07:26] things they're all like under a dollar
[01:07:28] from um from somewhere that way I can
[01:07:31] have like just a little fun thing to
[01:07:32] give people if they don't happen to win
[01:07:34] and beat the boss even though you still
[01:07:36] get your packs and you always get your
[01:07:37] packs it's just a little something extra
[01:07:39] to say thank you for playing type thing
[01:07:41] but I guess all the the gum and the the
[01:07:43] stuff that holds it together is not uh
[01:07:45] the after being 30 plus years old
[01:07:47] doesn't work
[01:07:49] anymore you know what I'm going to put
[01:07:52] that one in one of these and there's
[01:07:54] three of them here so you can just
[01:07:55] decide which one it is when I try to uh
[01:07:58] put these away in a minute
[01:08:02] here how's that if you want that uh
[01:08:06] Casper Casper the Friendly Ghost that
[01:08:09] was a good movie back in the
[01:08:14] day that was a good movie back in the
[01:08:16] day all right we're going to put this
[01:08:18] back here here we
[01:08:22] go that goes over there and then hm
[01:08:26] let's see what we'll do here this
[01:08:28] morning dude that was one of my favorite
[01:08:30] movies like as a kid and it wasn't even
[01:08:32] like it was it was just a good movie I
[01:08:34] think it was for me I think I liked all
[01:08:36] those good Feelgood ones I was a
[01:08:38] feel-good
[01:08:41] person I think that's what it is there
[01:08:44] you go throw some of those out and then
[01:08:47] um maybe you guys would like
[01:08:50] some I don't know if uh how we did this
[01:08:53] before see if we if we want to throw one
[01:08:56] of these out again
[01:09:01] um you know what I like the adventure
[01:09:03] I'm going to keep going with that a
[01:09:04] little bit I'm going actually put out my
[01:09:07] this here let's actually put that out
[01:09:09] let's put out that quickly let's see if
[01:09:11] I have I think I have that in
[01:09:13] here it is not in here thought I had
[01:09:16] that in here all right let's put that
[01:09:20] there no we'll do a little little picker
[01:09:23] pick aoo here
[01:09:26] create new screen there we
[01:09:30] go paste that in not wise
[01:09:36] magic she's
[01:09:38] Magi put that up there for you you know
[01:09:41] what we'll put up there for that I want
[01:09:43] to see these open no one's opening them
[01:09:45] I want to see these open let's drop it
[01:09:46] down a little
[01:09:47] bit let's give you that's the low I can
[01:09:50] go I think on that before I start having
[01:09:52] issues
[01:09:55] there you go throw it out there those
[01:09:57] ones on there yeah I think we got some
[01:09:59] good things out there yeah so what I'm
[01:10:01] going to end up doing is um found a
[01:10:05] website that allows me to set up and
[01:10:09] create DND D
[01:10:11] adventures and I'm planning on using
[01:10:13] that site to um run a D and D Adventure
[01:10:17] game for an entire show it'll be an
[01:10:19] adventure game but the way that you'll
[01:10:21] do it is you'll be building your
[01:10:23] character based on the packs and stuff
[01:10:25] you get like
[01:10:26] that um if you don't if you're not here
[01:10:29] to do that with me I'll end up building
[01:10:30] it I guess by myself here maybe get some
[01:10:32] input from the
[01:10:33] chat um but what we'll do is we'll build
[01:10:36] the character at the beginning of the
[01:10:37] show and we'll have that character go
[01:10:39] through the entire show and if you
[01:10:42] happen to beat the boss at the end maybe
[01:10:44] there'll be a special Loot drop type
[01:10:46] thing special uh cheap raffle at the end
[01:10:49] for all those if you beat the boss and
[01:10:51] we get to the end of the game there
[01:10:55] that's what I was planning on doing for
[01:10:58] uh for the adventure so there' be a few
[01:11:00] different steps you kind of go
[01:11:03] through and you'd use either the cards
[01:11:05] or um cards or packs depending on what
[01:11:08] you're picking to decide some of its
[01:11:10] strength as it goes into some of the
[01:11:13] adventures and the fights with the
[01:11:16] bosses that's what that was my idea at
[01:11:18] least thought it was kind of a cool one
[01:11:21] not sure if you liked it but figured uh
[01:11:24] I don't know that's my is my people keep
[01:11:26] telling me I do a good job with this
[01:11:27] dungeon master type thing so I figured
[01:11:30] might as well roll with it a little bit
[01:11:32] I haven't done stuff like that since I
[01:11:34] was a kid but you know what that's
[01:11:37] okay you know what I might end up
[01:11:39] opening one of these packs I don't
[01:11:40] generally open my own stuff but I want
[01:11:42] to see some my Coria opened and I
[01:11:44] haven't opened it in a
[01:11:46] while so maybe I might open one of these
[01:11:49] myself if no one uh if no one does
[01:12:02] there you go there you go there you go
[01:12:06] there we
[01:12:09] go yeah my my sister I think wore out
[01:12:12] the Casper tape there was like three
[01:12:15] tapes that we had vhs's tape yeah that's
[01:12:18] how old I am yeah y three vhs's that we
[01:12:21] had growing up that she wore out Casper
[01:12:24] was one
[01:12:25] um Greece was the
[01:12:27] other and um
[01:12:34] oh it was the one with um the guy that
[01:12:38] killed himself when he was playing
[01:12:40] Joker uh and she he was like with some
[01:12:43] girl in high school that's all I
[01:12:46] remember she's all that I think that's
[01:12:49] what it was called she wore out those
[01:12:51] vhs's growing up
[01:12:55] so I remember I could actually sing most
[01:12:57] of the um the songs from
[01:13:04] uh my brain is breaking I can actually

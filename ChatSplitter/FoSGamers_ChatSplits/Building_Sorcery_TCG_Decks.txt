Building a Sorcery: Contested Realm (Sorcery TCG) deck can be both an exciting and strategic process. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

### 1. **Understand the Basics of Sorcery TCG**
   - **Elements:** The game revolves around four elemental aspects: *Earth*, *Water*, *Air*, and *Fire*. Each element has its own strengths, weaknesses, and unique cards.
   - **Avatars:** Your deck is led by an Avatar, which is the central character of your deck, dictating your strategy and the element(s) you focus on.
   - **Cards Types:** There are several types of cards in Sorcery TCG, including:
     - **Creatures:** Summoned to battle your opponent's forces.
     - **Spells:** Cast to manipulate the battlefield or directly affect your opponent.
     - **Sites:** These represent locations on the battlefield where you can summon creatures or cast spells.
     - **Artifacts:** Items that provide ongoing effects or bonuses.

### 2. **Choose an Avatar and Element(s)**
   - **Avatar:** Select an Avatar that aligns with your preferred playstyle. Each Avatar comes with unique abilities and may favor certain elements.
   - **Elemental Focus:** Decide on one or more elements to focus on. You can build a mono-element deck or mix elements to create a hybrid deck.

### 3. **Build Your Deck**
   - **Card Count:** A typical deck in Sorcery TCG contains 50-60 cards. This includes a mix of Creatures, Spells, Sites, and Artifacts.

   - **Mana Curve:** Consider the mana cost of your cards. A good deck usually has a mix of low, mid, and high-cost cards, ensuring you can play cards at all stages of the game.

### 4. **Refine Your Strategy**
   - **Synergies:** Look for synergies between your cards. Some cards work better when played together, creating powerful combos.
   - **Flexibility:** Your deck should be versatile enough to handle various situations. Include cards that can deal with different threats and challenges.
   - **Testing:** Playtest your deck to see how it performs. Make adjustments based on your experiences, refining your card choices and strategy.

### 5. **Know Your Opponents**
   - **Meta Awareness:** Understand the current meta (popular strategies and decks) in Sorcery TCG. This knowledge can help you anticipate your opponent's moves and adjust your deck accordingly.
   - **Side Deck:** Some formats allow a side deck, a small group of cards that you can swap in between games to counter specific strategies your opponent may use.

### 6. **Stay Updated**
   - **New Releases:** Keep an eye on new card releases and updates to the game rules. New cards can open up new strategies or strengthen existing ones.
   - **Community Involvement:** Join online communities, participate in discussions, and learn from other players. This will help you stay informed and improve your deck-building skills.

### 7. **Sample Deck Concepts**
   - **Aggro Deck:** Focuses on quick, aggressive plays to overwhelm your opponent early.
   - **Control Deck:** Aims to control the game, countering your opponent's plays and slowly gaining the upper hand.
   - **Combo Deck:** Centers around executing a specific combination of cards to win the game.
   - **Midrange Deck:** Balances between aggressive and control strategies, adapting to the flow of the game.

### 8. **Participate in Tournaments**
   - **Local Tournaments:** Start with local events to gain experience.
   - **Online Tournaments:** Participate in online tournaments to test your deck against a wider range of opponents.
   - **Analysis:** After each tournament, analyze your performance and make necessary adjustments to your deck.

Using the Battlemage as your avatar is a great choice, as this avatar typically allows for a versatile and aggressive approach to the game, often focusing on spellcasting and battlefield control. Here’s a step-by-step guide to building a competitive deck around the Battlemage avatar:

### 1. **Avatar and Elemental Focus**
   - **Battlemage**: As a Battlemage, your deck will likely focus on a mix of powerful spells and creatures. This avatar generally excels in *Fire* and *Air* elements, which provide strong offensive capabilities and quick tempo plays.

### 2. **Core Strategy**
   - **Aggression with Control**: Your deck should focus on putting pressure on your opponent while maintaining control of the battlefield. This can be achieved by using direct damage spells, quick creatures, and spells that disrupt your opponent’s plans.
   - **Spell Synergy**: Include spells that not only deal damage but also provide additional effects, such as drawing cards, creating tokens, or hindering your opponent’s resources.

### 3. **Key Card Types**
   - **Creatures**: Look for creatures that complement your aggressive playstyle. Include creatures that can be summoned quickly and have immediate effects, like dealing damage or disabling opposing creatures.
   - **Spells**: Fire and Air spells should be the backbone of your deck. Fire spells for direct damage and destruction, and Air spells for speed, evasion, and battlefield manipulation.
   - **Artifacts and Enchantments**: Consider artifacts that enhance your spells or creatures, and enchantments that provide ongoing effects to maintain pressure on your opponent.

### 4. **Sample Deck Composition**
   - **Creatures (15-20 cards)**:
     - **Fire Elementals**: Aggressive creatures that deal damage as they enter the battlefield.
     - **Airborne Units**: Creatures with flying or haste to quickly pressure your opponent.
     - **Utility Creatures**: Include creatures that can disrupt your opponent’s strategy, like those with abilities to tap or negate other creatures.

   - **Spells (20-25 cards)**:
     - **Fireball**: A must-have for direct damage and board control.
     - **Lightning Bolt**: Fast, cheap damage that can target creatures or players.
     - **Air Shield**: Protects your creatures or redirects damage.
     - **Chain Lightning**: Damage that can spread to multiple targets.

   - **Sites (8-10 cards)**:
     - **Volcanic Peaks**: A Fire-aligned site that enhances your fire spells or generates mana for them.
     - **Windy Plains**: Air-aligned sites that allow you to move your creatures quickly across the battlefield.

   - **Artifacts/Enchantments (5-7 cards)**:
     - **Flame Staff**: Boosts your fire spells and can deal additional damage.
     - **Storm Amulet**: Enhances Air spells and provides battlefield control.

### 5. **Mana Curve and Balance**
   - **Early Game**: Focus on getting quick creatures and low-cost spells onto the field to apply immediate pressure.
   - **Mid Game**: Shift to more powerful spells and mid-tier creatures that can start dominating the battlefield.
   - **Late Game**: Have a few high-impact spells or creatures that can secure victory or turn the tide if you’re behind.

### 6. **Test and Refine**
   - **Playtesting**: Take your deck through rigorous playtesting against a variety of opponents. Note which cards perform well and which don’t.
   - **Adjustments**: After testing, tweak your deck to improve consistency, enhance synergies, and cover any weaknesses you observed.

### Summary
To build a competitive Sorcery TCG deck around the Battlemage avatar:
1. Focus on Fire and Air elements for aggression and control.
2. Balance your deck with creatures that are fast and impactful, alongside powerful spells.
3. Incorporate artifacts and enchantments that enhance your strategy.

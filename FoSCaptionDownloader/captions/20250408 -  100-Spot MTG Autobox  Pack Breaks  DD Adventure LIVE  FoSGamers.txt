[00:00:00] We are going to do a giveaway. That's
[00:00:03] really it. We're doing a giveaway here.
[00:00:04] One giveaway. Hang out with a friend of
[00:00:07] ours. I'm going to run this to say thank
[00:00:09] you. See if anybody wants to go hang out
[00:00:11] with a friend um that we've had before.
[00:00:13] Rev hangs out here. Let me get um this
[00:00:17] going. Oh, no lights on. Can you turn
[00:00:18] the lights on for me? But um either way,
[00:00:21] we're just doing one literally quick
[00:00:23] five minute thing. We're going to go try
[00:00:24] and see a friend of ours, say thank you.
[00:00:26] They hang out with Rev Tank on a regular
[00:00:28] basis. So, I wanted to do a little quick
[00:00:30] giveaway, say thank you, and then we're
[00:00:31] going to raid on over. So, make sure you
[00:00:32] jump in on this, and we will see who
[00:00:36] gets this pack. I'm going to cut it open
[00:00:38] here in the last minute of it, and we'll
[00:00:40] uh go hang out with a friend of ours
[00:00:42] right at the right when the last card
[00:00:44] pulls, right when it done there, saying
[00:00:46] thank you for coming and hanging out
[00:00:48] with
[00:00:52] us. Hopefully, they're supposed to be on
[00:00:55] soon. Hopefully, you're actually on
[00:00:57] time.
[00:00:58] I'm trying something. Hopefully they
[00:01:00] show
[00:01:01] up. But this is what we got. We're going
[00:01:04] to be giving this away. Going to say uh
[00:01:05] just thank you for hanging out with us
[00:01:07] as we do regularly. Well, we do some
[00:01:09] afternoon shows every now and again, but
[00:01:10] not all the time. We're just doing one
[00:01:12] quick one saying thank you. We're going
[00:01:13] to give this away. I don't know why the
[00:01:15] camera is tilted down there. It's like
[00:01:17] this is not up right. I'm going to have
[00:01:18] to play around with some of that a
[00:01:20] little
[00:01:21] bit. Figure out why. Maybe tilt it up a
[00:01:25] little bit better. But this is what we
[00:01:28] have going on today. Nothing special,
[00:01:31] nothing over the top, just a little nice
[00:01:33] thing for somebody. Tis all. We're going
[00:01:36] to have a pack that we're going to give
[00:01:37] away. That is it. Got a raid coming in.
[00:01:41] We're going to go see a friend of ours.

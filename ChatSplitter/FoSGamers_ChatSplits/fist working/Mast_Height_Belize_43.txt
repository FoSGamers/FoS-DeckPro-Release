What are the bridge heights of the ICW and will this fit underneath the bridge heights of the ICW in Florida and, you know, the intercoastal waterway?

[2024-08-05 18:35:18] ChatGPT:
The fixed bridges along the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) in Florida generally have a vertical clearance of 65 feet above mean high water (MHW). However, there is one notable exception: the Julia Tuttle Causeway in Miami, which has a clearance of only 56 feet【16†source】【17†source】.

Given that the mast height of the 2003 Fountaine Pajot Belize 43 is approximately 64.6 feet, this sailboat will be able to pass under most of the fixed bridges along the ICW in Florida. However, it will not be able to clear the Julia Tuttle Causeway bridge, which has a clearance of 56 feet【8†source】【9†source】.

### Summary:
1. Most fixed bridges on the ICW in Florida have a clearance of 65 feet.
2. The Julia Tuttle Causeway bridge in Miami has a clearance of 56 feet.
3. The 2003 Fountaine Pajot Belize 43, with a mast height of 64.6 feet, will fit under most bridges except the Julia Tuttle Causeway.

with the 65 feet at high tide for intercoastal or for low tide.

[2024-08-05 18:36:08] ChatGPT:
The vertical clearance of the fixed bridges along the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) in Florida is typically measured at mean high water (MHW). This means that the 65-foot clearance is the minimum clearance that you can expect at high tide. The actual clearance will be greater at low tide, depending on the tidal range.

### Summary:
1. The 65-foot clearance for fixed bridges on the ICW is measured at mean high water (MHW).
2. At low tide, the clearance will be greater than 65 feet.

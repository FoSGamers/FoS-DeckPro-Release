[00:11:42] the spots I'll run one first one we do
[00:11:44] it like this get do a little discount on
[00:11:47] the first one for a

[00:11:52] find where my drink is because it was
[00:11:53] moved
[00:11:59] there we go I got it I see
[00:12:03] it come back with a
[00:12:05] keyboard there we go and my drink right
[00:12:08] there is going to move over here to the
[00:12:11] C
[00:12:13] holda
[00:12:16] there all right we got some of those
[00:12:18] marble to open now what do you guys
[00:12:19] think we should do
[00:12:21] next any
[00:12:27] thoughts well we'll back out of here
[00:12:29] we'll Zoom back out
[00:12:32] here anyways well um
[00:12:39] yeah do
[00:12:41] um pin some things that are in The Bu
[00:12:43] now I guess we do have a lot of
[00:12:46] Foundations
[00:12:47] left pretty good deal on all those too
[00:12:50] compared to um some of the other places
[00:12:57] so I know found foundations is um going
[00:13:00] up all around so maybe that's what you
[00:13:02] would like to get yourselves a little
[00:13:04] bit of
[00:13:06] that we do not know but if we can get
[00:13:10] through one of these brakes one of the
[00:13:12] things I was thinking we would do with
[00:13:13] them is we would have another break and
[00:13:15] we going to add one do more of our uh
[00:13:17] something like this like I was thinking
[00:13:18] with our break
[00:13:20] today I might put in with it some other
[00:13:22] ones like some the older stuff that I
[00:13:25] had gotten in picked up when I was at
[00:13:27] Vegas
[00:13:29] you guys see the fact that I was in
[00:13:30] Vegas and they um they like when getting
[00:13:32] all the cards there coming back I guess
[00:13:34] uh we got we are getting search now from
[00:13:39] um whenever we come uh back with magic
[00:13:42] cards because I guess if you have too
[00:13:44] many they in a
[00:13:46] stack they are um they get searched by
[00:13:49] the uh TSA is it full i p
[00:13:59] M magne things all together
[00:14:06] yeah third time I know every time we go
[00:14:09] through it's the I think it's the
[00:14:10] magnetic cases that we got remember we
[00:14:13] were there sorry I just got to move that
[00:14:15] around so I can get to it when I need
[00:14:17] to that's the only I can think of that
[00:14:19] was just weird really weird so let's um
[00:14:22] we'll open up one of these then maybe
[00:14:24] we'll open up another of the secret
[00:14:26] layers here in a little bit but I had a
[00:14:27] few of these left over that was plan on
[00:14:29] I was hoping they sold over the break
[00:14:31] there while we're gone but they didn't
[00:14:32] so since they didn't we'll use it and
[00:14:33] we'll have some of this open for a
[00:14:34] little bit then we'll get to another
[00:14:36] secret lir if uh you guys

[00:34:10] saved oh come
[00:34:13] on I wish this would allow me to see it
[00:34:16] a little bit bigger so rather than just
[00:34:18] one line that's a half a [ __ ]
[00:34:19] sentence long
[00:34:28] all
[00:34:29] right
[00:34:31] pick
[00:34:40] pick and that one is going to be weird
[00:34:43] my phone go
[00:35:00] see what that one is I had is sitting up
[00:35:19] here
[00:35:21] okay okay there we go same thing
[00:35:25] actually the same price
[00:35:32] that's what I thought I was going to be
[00:35:33] but I don't need to be oh come
[00:35:37] on sorry my fingers aren't moving right
[00:35:40] even geez my fingers aren't even moving
[00:35:42] right that's how bad it is this
[00:35:46] morning here we go non full C but my
[00:35:49] father-in-law was looking for all of
[00:35:51] them minus black panther so I was
[00:35:53] considering getting that oh okay so all
[00:35:55] of the nonfoil minus black
[00:35:58] panther you want and all and you
[00:36:04] yourself want the Captain America one
[00:36:09] nonfoil am I right okay cool all right
[00:36:12] Captain America
[00:36:14] nonfoil um so let me get that Captain
[00:36:16] America nonfoil
[00:36:34] for the Captain America nonfoil it would
[00:36:36] end up being 80 just because my like I
[00:36:38] said my fees and [ __ ] that I have to
[00:36:39] deal with um but that would be that for
[00:36:41] that one if you want and I can get the
[00:36:42] rest of them together so pretty much is
[00:36:45] it's that amount times that generally
[00:36:47] what it is but I'm going to I sometimes
[00:36:48] a little bit different because of the
[00:36:50] what I get but give me one second H
[00:36:52] that' be
[00:37:00] no you don't want all them you want the
[00:37:02] four of them okay four of them in said
[00:37:06] would
[00:37:13] be the nonfoil would be
[00:37:16] um yeah 320 with the without the Black
[00:37:20] Panther in so they're about $80 for each
[00:37:23] of them when I do them as a bundle
[00:37:26] together um and and single for the for
[00:37:29] the non-foil is 80 if you're going to do
[00:37:31] an individual of a foil it's like 100
[00:37:33] that's the kind of what it is for me
[00:37:35] here if that makes any
[00:37:39] sense about what I have it at if you
[00:37:41] guys are interested so there you go and
[00:37:43] but if you get them all bundled together
[00:37:44] I was trying to got them all that's why
[00:37:46] I was doing it that way a little bit
[00:37:47] cheaper because when you get them
[00:37:49] together I like to do
[00:37:52] that drink my coffee
[00:38:00] all right sounds good yeah let me know I
[00:38:02] I'll have them here um like I said I
[00:38:04] have a few of them so I should have them
[00:38:05] for a little while so thank you yeah I
[00:38:06] have them all here for
[00:38:08] you I don't mind doing that and Steph do
[00:38:11] you want to open
[00:38:15] one I was told I need to tell my wife if
[00:38:17] I was going to open something so I asked
[00:38:19] her if we want she wanted to open one
[00:38:24] instead she's not answering she must be
[00:38:27] doing something instead all right she
[00:38:28] must be busy that's all right what's up
[00:38:30] ninski how's it going
[00:38:33] buddy we were doing some of these but
[00:38:36] and one of the things here is I only had
[00:38:37] a handful of the Arcane signets so I
[00:38:39] don't really have all of them so I can't
[00:38:41] do those in everything so I actually
[00:38:43] want to see one of them myself though CU
[00:38:45] I have not had a chance to see what one
[00:38:47] of these even look
[00:38:48] like so that would be pretty sweet if we
[00:38:50] could do that I figured and I'll look at
[00:38:53] those right now
[00:38:58] I want to take a look at this since I
[00:38:59] have not had a chance to see it yet
[00:39:01] personally oh
[00:39:03] interesting
[00:39:07] interesting some people are selling
[00:39:09] these for like 200 bucks at one point
[00:39:11] that's
[00:39:12] insane any of what foil I do have some
[00:39:15] foil I was just getting things together
[00:39:18] right now um I hadn't gotten into them
[00:39:19] all yet that's all that's
[00:39:25] all who 200 plus for storm I didn't know
[00:39:28] that that's insane I'll have to check
[00:39:30] that
[00:39:31] out I'll put a well you know what we can
[00:39:34] put a storm one in and I'll see what we
[00:39:36] got let me see if you guys want a storm
[00:39:40] break we can do that maybe
[00:39:44] huh we can do that let's get into um
[00:39:47] let's get to that
[00:39:54] then here we go
[00:40:00] okay no there yeah they may have gone at

[00:42:18] doing that for
[00:42:21] me there's your hair dropped onto the T
[00:42:24] oh that was on my eye and my for like 5
[00:42:28] minutes I couldn't get it out of my eye
[00:42:29] it wasn't 5 minutes it was like 5
[00:42:31] seconds but still felt like 5 minutes
[00:42:32] cuz in my eye and I couldn't get it
[00:42:36] out long to be with
[00:42:38] you oh thank you it just long to be with
[00:42:41] me huh
[00:42:46] that um I will be opening some but it
[00:42:48] won't be really to sell singles by the
[00:42:50] way um that's all I I don't have I
[00:42:52] wasn't M the opening for the family here
[00:42:55] um because I didn't get a ton of them
[00:42:57] I'm not I wasn't a person that went and
[00:42:58] bought like you know 50 if that makes
[00:43:01] any sense I bought a handful because
[00:43:02] some people said if you can G grab them
[00:43:04] grab them they weren't sure if they were
[00:43:05] going to be able to so I pretty much
[00:43:06] grabbed the few for people type of thing
[00:43:09] cter oh I would be Wicked lucky that
[00:43:11] would be pretty sweet if we could pull
[00:43:12] one of those ones one of the 3K cards
[00:43:14] one of those special ones that'd be
[00:43:17] insane that'd be
[00:43:21] crazy yeah yeah I wasn't I didn't I
[00:43:24] didn't buy like a ton of them one I I'm
[00:43:26] just I only have One account to go buy
[00:43:28] stuff with so that's one of the reasons
[00:43:29] why so you know but I throw out a few
[00:43:33] different ones let's throw out a
[00:43:36] wolverine we have two CS we do have two
[00:43:39] counter spells two counter spells also
[00:43:42] yes we'll do a rainbow foil of Wolverine
[00:43:45] why not we'll put that in a secret
[00:43:48] layer okay
[00:44:02] all
[00:44:08] right here we go get rid of those
[00:44:24] again then there put Wolverine in
[00:44:32] there
[00:44:33] really oh
[00:44:36] wow see I didn't I didn't do anything
[00:44:39] like that I didn't know that was
[00:44:40] possible by the way until after which
[00:44:42] made sense why I didn't get all my
[00:44:44] Arcane signets
[00:44:48] but because I was just in queue for my
[00:44:50] stuff and I was like what the freak is
[00:44:52] going on here
[00:44:57] yeah know that's one of those ones that
[00:44:58] like I didn't I didn't know I didn't
[00:45:00] know it was possible and it just kind of
[00:45:01] stinks that uh what happened but I guess
[00:45:04] it happens enough but we'll pin this on
[00:45:06] I'm going to pin this which was our our
[00:45:07] Marvel our Iron Man one that I had plan
[00:45:10] Planned to do with everyone started out

[00:45:22] got from our foundations
[00:45:24] pack do you see that look what we pulled
[00:45:28] out that was my my luck of the day so
[00:45:31] far starting it out with stuff like that
[00:45:36] today that was a fun one all right let
[00:45:40] me see our giveaway went to our friend

[01:11:40] thing I just said times five and I hit B
[01:11:42] check out right now like so it was I was
[01:11:44] in there for like almost less than 10
[01:11:46] seconds hey Oblivion how you doing so
[01:11:49] like I was probably in there for like
[01:11:51] anywhere I'd say probably less than 5
[01:11:53] Seconds when it opened because I was
[01:11:55] like ding ding ding boom right into the
[01:11:57] checkout line and I had already logged
[01:11:59] in and everything so I'm guessing that
[01:12:00] might have been
[01:12:02] why ah all right all right yeah is how's

[01:12:07] thanks coming in hanging

[01:12:13] glitch stuff that they had going on and
[01:12:14] it was like almost three hours but it
[01:12:16] wasn't five and I think I think that's
[01:12:18] why I was lucky that I got all when I
[01:12:19] got in I had all the Arcane signets
[01:12:21] right away and I had to get all of them
[01:12:23] I only got a handful because didn't end
[01:12:25] up having enough to give me by the time
[01:12:27] because of people jumping in line and
[01:12:28] all that I was like seriously
[01:12:31] but
[01:12:34] whatever hey you're live right Frank
[01:12:40] right I'm finally back here in the in

[01:13:05] few more for some for the sword that
[01:13:07] asked but I couldn't I didn't want to

[01:14:38] over my like fees and [ __ ] so that I'm
[01:14:41] not losing money is really what it
[01:14:42] always boils down to for me because I'm
[01:14:44] not trying to make a boatload of money
[01:14:46] off of this one of my goal here here if
[01:14:48] it makes any sense was that you guys
[01:14:50] will be hanging out with us we'll have
[01:14:51] some people watching on YouTube with us
[01:14:54] and eventually the YouTube because of
[01:14:56] that will help me generate enough um you
[01:14:59] know income from the um doing the
[01:15:01] streaming there that I would be able to
[01:15:04] do a lot of this as more giveaways than
[01:15:06] anything that would actually be my goal
[01:15:07] is to be hanging out with you guys and
[01:15:09] just kind of giving [ __ ] away all day if
[01:15:11] I could that my goal but until then what
[01:15:14] I need to do is buy this stuff and sell
[01:15:16] it so I make enough money that I can
[01:15:17] make it back and buy
[01:15:19] more
[01:15:22] and yeah uh be if people are on YouTube
[01:15:24] watch it does help out if you're not
[01:15:26] purchasing so you're not purchasing
[01:15:27] anything and you want to just hang out
[01:15:28] and watch on YouTube it does help out a
[01:15:30] lot because it helps grow my hours that
[01:15:32] people watch and the amount of people
[01:15:33] that are clicking and stuff like that
[01:15:35] and the more of that that I have the
[01:15:36] more that I get paid based on my ads and
[01:15:38] the amount of clicks and stuff like that
[01:15:39] so it helps and that will help me do
[01:15:42] more stuff with you guys so like I'll be
[01:15:43] able to like I said literally give stuff
[01:15:44] away that type of
[01:15:47] thing well cage it does whatever you
[01:15:50] want to do buddy but yeah I get what
[01:15:52] you're saying there but yeah that's what
[01:15:54] I um yeah does help because of that yeah

[01:16:01] want to jump in and just have it running
[01:16:02] so you can hang out with us in there if
[01:16:03] you're like I said if you're not going
[01:16:04] to be purchasing and you just want to

[01:17:58] the ads that'll play across I get some
[01:18:00] Revenue based on that and then if uh you
[01:18:02] know everybody clicks and watches and
[01:18:03] hangs out to watch for a little while
[01:18:05] every person that clicks to watch for a
[01:18:06] little bit whether it's just a few or a
[01:18:08] little while or the entire time that

[01:20:38] to get an Iron Man soul ring
[01:21:03] H like a hard one to come across or
[01:21:12] something or do they like not have any
[01:21:14] of them I don't know
[01:21:17] confused ah
[01:21:20] 15 oh okay yeah if I end up opening if I
[01:21:24] um so if I end up finding any at any
[01:21:25] other point that I can open some and
[01:21:27] sell singles maybe I'll do that but at
[01:21:28] the moment I just don't have the ability
[01:21:30] to
[01:21:32] um yeah I might who knows
[01:21:36] later depending on if I can find some
[01:21:38] more but I don't know if I'll buy any
[01:21:39] more since there everybody seems to have
[01:21:41] their fill at the moment of it
[01:21:51] all let me um but yeah well we
[01:21:56] uh have some fun here
[01:22:30] here forgot about those that's okay we
[01:22:34] can forget about
[01:22:37] those all right iot to hit start on a
[01:22:40] couple
[01:22:41] things wondering why it wasn't
[01:22:45] going that's the reason
[01:22:51] why see that's the problem see I have to
[01:22:54] have of them to be able want to get rid
[01:22:55] of
[01:22:56] [Laughter]
[01:22:58] them that's why I like doing the breaks
[01:23:00] cuz then at least if I sold in a pack
[01:23:02] it's not mine see if I have cards it's
[01:23:05] like Oh I like that card oh I like that
[01:23:06] card I don't know if I want I'm going to
[01:23:07] use that card and then after time like I
[01:23:09] never end up using it for who knows how
[01:23:11] long and then finally I'm like oh well
[01:23:13] all right now I don't you did not use it
[01:23:15] okay well I guess I should sell it now
[01:23:17] it's always way after it's always
[01:23:18] dropped in price cuz I'm silly like that
[01:23:21] but more I get this to play with you

[01:47:44] probably just going to bring everything
[01:47:45] on board I was initially thinking of
[01:47:48] leaving like my computer here
[01:47:53] because uh it would allow me to have
[01:47:55] better internet connection but I was
[01:47:57] talking to a guy that had um a starlink
[01:47:59] and he goes you're not going to have any
[01:48:01] problems like he uses it all the time he
[01:48:03] has the unlimited thing he never runs
[01:48:04] into anything any issues that he needs
[01:48:07] to update anything or anything like that
[01:48:09] so he's like you'll be fine there's
[01:48:10] nothing you need to worry about you know
[01:48:12] what this is what I'll do I'm going to
[01:48:13] put out
[01:48:15] cranco and Anthem
[01:48:18] there if anybody would want it oh come
[01:48:21] on yeah I'll be well looking all over
[01:48:23] the ocean yeah starling's pretty
[01:48:27] good
[01:48:29] sweet yeah nice nice yeah that's what
[01:48:31] we're getting I was talking to a guy
[01:48:32] there that had it and um that happened
[01:48:35] to be at like the marina and it was
[01:48:37] pretty sweet Bob's on
[01:48:39] it and it was he said yeah he has no
[01:48:42] problems with the regular one I was even
[01:48:43] looking at the High Fidelity one he's
[01:48:45] like do you even need to worry about
[01:48:46] that he goes I we're on our boat all the
[01:48:48] time and I've never had a problem with
[01:48:49] our connection like all right

[01:49:33] little while we on our way back up all
[01:49:36] right anyways we'll have uh so I'm
[01:49:38] hopefully we can uh maybe meet up and

[01:49:52] yes nice Arizona green tea and a giant
[01:49:55] can
[01:49:58] here but it's almost empty
[01:50:02] so I do play on spell table that is
[01:50:04] correct I don't get to play as much as I
[01:50:06] had in the past because of where I am
[01:50:07] and hav been moving or stuff around we
[01:50:10] used to play like once every once a week
[01:50:11] on Sundays actually but I got so busy
[01:50:15] that I didn't have the opportunity
[01:50:16] anymore so we've been trying to get like
[01:50:18] with the boat stuff once I get all that
[01:50:19] settled I shouldn't have I shouldn't be
[01:50:22] as busy I can play more cuz I had like
[01:50:24] Weekly game we were doing for a couple
[01:50:26] for a few months and then it just I just
[01:50:28] died off because I didn't have enough
[01:50:30] time with uh the boat getting all that
[01:50:35] ready um you just can get a like you can
[01:50:38] literally use your phone too by the way
[01:50:40] you can set it up or you can use your
[01:50:42] phone now if I um if I believe right
[01:50:44] they have a a mobile function so your
[01:50:46] phone takes over and you can connect it
[01:50:48] to your computer screen um for it so you
[01:50:51] don't need to you you don't need a get
[01:50:52] another one why did I just put your name
[01:50:55] in there that was
[01:51:09] silly there we go
[01:51:13] foil Sphinx of the Forgotten
[01:51:18] law yeah yeah you can use your camera
[01:51:20] there's a now an ability to use your
[01:51:22] camera it's like pretty much you take a
[01:51:23] there's a QR code it'll pop up you take
[01:51:25] a picture of the QR code and it sends
[01:51:26] you to a link that opens your allows you
[01:51:28] to open your
[01:51:29] camera yeah exactly if you have even if
[01:51:31] you have spare phones that's perfect
[01:51:33] yeah just connect it to Wi-Fi with the
[01:51:34] camera and that it works yeah sweet
[01:51:37] that'll work for
[01:51:39] you all right Nico coming in with some
[01:51:43] more the Sphinx of the Forgotten
[01:51:46] law there you go
[01:51:50] Nico all righty all righty
[01:51:54] thought Natali I don't think this one's
[01:51:55] a big one if I remember but we'll try it
[01:52:03] anyways this one is the
[01:52:08] 194 yeah I didn't think so we'll put
[01:52:10] that over here if we come in across
[01:52:13] something else we'll throw that out
[01:52:15] there do an Exemplar of light right now
[01:52:24] there we go so throw that one out
[01:52:27] for this if you want it oh
[01:52:37] Boney hey well if you um if you get some
[01:52:41] more people to play like I said I try to
[01:52:42] play as much as I can so um I haven't
[01:52:44] been able to recently just because the
[01:52:46] traveling with the boat and all that
[01:52:47] crap has just taken up a lot of the time
[01:52:49] so once we all get that settled down
[01:52:50] hopefully I'm probably going to be the
[01:52:52] beginning next year I'm guessing then
[01:52:54] I'll be able to start up some more games
[01:52:55] like I used
[01:52:57] to all right we'll put that one over
[01:53:00] here
[01:53:09] Kellen this one is
[01:53:12] four
[01:53:14] 66 you know what that's what we'll do
[01:53:16] we'll throw that with our
[01:53:19] atali throw those two out there
[01:53:26] there you go if you want
[01:53:28] those those two a natal and a
[01:53:43] Kellen righty going to our next one
[01:53:47] here scrawling tler
[01:53:53] for you if you'd like
[01:53:55] it borderless scrawling
[01:53:59] tler borderless scrawling tler coming at
[01:54:02] you
[01:54:08] yeah all right and then I know that's
[01:54:11] not anything we'll put that one over
[01:54:13] here
[01:54:18] though we go Alaya who lasts at fate
[01:54:21] we'll come up for you all
[01:54:29] next here we are it's a foil you know
[01:54:33] what let's do
[01:54:36] this put a couple of foils
[01:54:39] together with a t that's what we'll
[01:54:43] do throw those together
[01:54:46] there those two foils T and Alisha foil
[01:54:54] yeah if we can get a bunch of people
[01:54:55] playing that' be fun I don't mind doing
[01:54:57] that on a regular
[01:55:04] basis yeah I'm always late on everything
[01:55:06] so that's why I end up um stuck with
[01:55:08] stuff so my problem right now is I'm
[01:55:10] stuck with a lot of things and I'm going
[01:55:11] to probably uh yeah have to figure some
[01:55:14] stuff out soon because I need to
[01:55:20] uh need to be able to clean shop a
[01:55:22] little bit
[01:55:24] here probably uh do a Black Friday
[01:55:29] sale on a bunch of stuff I think is what
[01:55:32] my guess will be oh pretty big Black
[01:55:34] Friday sales is what I'm
[01:55:39] guessing it's the only thing I can think
[01:55:41] of hopefully people will like that I
[01:55:43] don't know we'll find out though throw
[01:55:46] this on for this if anybody want the VL
[01:55:48] re the uh Celestial armor
[01:55:57] yeah see for me I don't have yeah
[01:55:58] exactly it's pretty I'm my guess is
[01:56:01] it'll be somewhere in January is when
[01:56:03] I'm going to be like settled and okay
[01:56:06] because we're going to be like I'm going
[01:56:07] to have to have like so and then at that
[01:56:09] point too I'm sometimes I'm going to
[01:56:10] have to something installed so I might
[01:56:11] even have to move yeah we'll find
[01:56:15] out we do this lay line ax
[01:56:25] there you are if you want
[01:56:37] it so we'll do that there see if you
[01:56:41] want any of the singles we're putting
[01:56:42] out we have our brakes there if anybody
[01:56:43] wants to jump in on them it's a good job
[01:56:45] good brakes for you some uh think we
[01:56:48] have Captain America we have Iron Man we
[01:56:51] have
[01:56:52] Black Panther in there we have a storm
[01:56:58] break so I don't know let me see what
[01:57:00] you guys are interested in we put that
[01:57:03] out earlier and no one wanted it so I'll
[01:57:04] just you know what I'll put it out again
[01:57:05] because maybe they don't want the foil
[01:57:13] version go throw that one out instead of
[01:57:16] the foil version maybe that's what it
[01:57:18] is no that's supposed to work there you
[01:57:22] go instead of $7 you get it for
[01:57:27] six and we'll uh we'll have some fun
[01:57:30] here while we're doing our stuff we'll
[01:57:31] be on probably around uh where are you
[01:57:32] guys thinking of being more frequently
[01:57:36] probably be like uh for the first few
[01:57:38] months we'll be in the Virgin Island
[01:57:40] areas for the first month this because
[01:57:41] we're going to have a be there for a
[01:57:42] couple weeks and come back for Christmas
[01:57:44] then be there for a couple weeks as we
[01:57:45] moving up so it'll be fun for a little
[01:57:47] while any of you guys in that area want
[01:57:49] cards too let me know cuz I'll be coming
[01:57:51] down with stuff regularly CU it's kind
[01:57:53] of like what we have what we do right so

[01:57:58] always bring it down
[01:58:04] too this is
[01:58:08] 85 that's that there no one's going to
[01:58:10] want that so we'll put that
[01:58:13] with we'll put that with these
[01:58:16] ones in the
[01:58:18] back these are the ones that are the
[01:58:22] lower price ones that no one really
[01:58:25] wants so we'll be on the boat mainly in
[01:58:29] um the area would be the uh coming up
[01:58:32] once we get the vote we'll come up could

[02:32:02] got excited about having them so I know
[02:32:04] my wife likes Groot go Groot maybe so I
[02:32:08] like then coming out with them seeing
[02:32:10] that Groot was a special like kind of
[02:32:12] like the little special guest thing at
[02:32:13] the end of them yeah you can take it you
[02:32:16] can take a look at it mom is a mom is a

[02:32:32] sleeves not lie in the second it's a
[02:32:34] good card it's a good card great one if
[02:32:36] I have all of my numbers up on my yeah I
[02:32:38] know it's PR sweet there you go it's a
[02:32:41] regular card it's just in a different
[02:32:42] version of things I know it's nice I
[02:32:45] like
[02:32:46] it yes me too see well um I thought they
[02:32:49] were going to do a Marvel set like you
[02:32:52] would actually get a whole set of Marvel
[02:32:54] like um like like kind of like we've
[02:32:57] opened boxes before and stuff but I
[02:32:59] guess um they're going to it seems like
[02:33:00] they're doing the secret layer I
[02:33:02] guess when's the New York convention no
[02:33:04] no next year the first one is they're
[02:33:07] going to come out with the deck H if
[02:33:09] they come out with Decks that would be
[02:33:10] the next one would the yeah a big one a
[02:33:12] big convention that make
[02:33:15] sense they're doing Spider-Man next year
[02:33:18] yeah as yeah but that's still a SEC
[02:33:19] layer though it's not a um it's not like
[02:33:22] a regular it's not like a regular set
[02:33:25] you know what I mean so that's what I'm
[02:33:27] getting at like I I I thought they were
[02:33:28] going to do like a regular set of this
[02:33:30] stuff oh it is oh it is a set oh
[02:33:32] Spider-Man is a set I thought it was
[02:33:34] secret lair okay cool see for some
[02:33:37] reason I thought it was a secret
[02:33:39] layer
[02:33:41] so cool that'll be nice then they'll be
[02:33:44] excited about that they all they
[02:33:45] actually had Spider-Man costumes at one
[02:33:47] point so that would be a nice
[02:33:48] one so here is our break that we had set
[02:33:51] up pinned here for those of you that
[02:33:53] have been hanging out here we have uh
[02:33:57] four spots five of the spots left out of
[02:34:03] six I I'm going to double check anyways
[02:34:06] I was lit going to look
[02:34:09] here I
[02:34:10] know Spider-Man MTG
[02:34:21] all
[02:34:24] right
[02:34:28] 2025 doesn't uh just
[02:34:32] says sling cards from across the
[02:34:34] spiderverse into your favorite
[02:34:37] decks I don't know oh it is going to be
[02:34:40] a set okay
[02:34:42] cool let's go break Let's go people
[02:34:45] let's get this break going we have a
[02:34:46] bunch of Foundations in it and you get
[02:34:49] the iron man we're going to do between
[02:34:50] it spray that out F figure do some
[02:34:53] breaks with those and it'll be
[02:35:01] fun foundations is getting uh scarce
[02:35:04] though from what I've been seeing it's a
[02:35:06] weird one I think people uh realized it
[02:35:09] was a good
[02:35:11] set um a little late in the
[02:35:15] uh in the process
[02:35:19] they're like $33 $35 now wow they're
[02:35:23] going up
[02:35:27] there oh different um different Marvel
[02:35:31] every every year C
[02:35:33] cage yes that makes sense I don't
[02:35:36] disagree on that one I was actually
[02:35:37] thinking they were going to have their
[02:35:41] own like kind of secret not secret layer
[02:35:44] um their own um universe beyond like
[02:35:46] sets each thing of Marvel like you know
[02:35:49] like we'll have know Spider-Man then
[02:35:51] we'll have uh you know like Iron Man
[02:35:54] then we'll have X-Men then you'll have
[02:35:56] maybe if we are lucky we'll get you know
[02:35:58] uh we'll get the um Guardians of the
[02:36:00] Galaxy you know [ __ ] like
[02:36:04] that that was my thought process at
[02:36:09] least I don't know but we'll find out
[02:36:12] obviously they know they're doing and we
[02:36:14] don't
[02:36:16] so get this so we can put it ready in
[02:36:18] the other one so when we need 10 our
[02:36:19] giveaway again
[02:36:25] next well it's a rough morning here but
[02:36:28] I just got back and we expected
[02:36:36] that all right yeah half and half which
[02:36:40] would make sense about magic the
[02:36:41] Gathering with where the um the event
[02:36:43] all the um Marvel stuff that they have
[02:36:47] coming yep that makes sense
[02:36:52] well yeah I know it's uh it's going to
[02:36:54] be one of those they have
[02:36:57] uh I hope they don't do it like the uh
[02:36:59] like the some of them make them like
[02:37:01] exceptionally scarce like they do with
[02:37:02] the Fallout that's the only
[02:37:06] thing see all I would want
[02:37:09] like so as long as they do
[02:37:16] say I don't know if we even play
[02:37:18] boosters
[02:37:19] how much
[02:37:22] like I feel like it just needs a special
[02:37:24] small sets almost and they but they they
[02:37:26] going to charge too much for it so
[02:37:28] that's the problem you know what I
[02:37:32] mean yeah SpongeBob is in IP and Magic
[02:37:36] they uh they released it in um at
[02:37:40] Vegas so they'll still have other ones
[02:37:43] but that one I think is going to be a
[02:37:44] secret layer not a
[02:37:48] uh not a set and if it is a set that'll
[02:37:50] be a little
[02:37:51] interesting I don't know how they do
[02:37:53] that as a set I mean I figure secret
[02:37:56] lair is easy
[02:37:58] enough me
[02:38:04] whatever oh my God I can't believe I'm
[02:38:06] so tired
[02:38:08] so I think it's just the traveling and
[02:38:10] everything the sun I have to get used to
[02:38:12] that all right we got our giveaway here
[02:38:14] is going to be one of our 10 cards in
[02:38:17] our giveaway packs our giveaway stuff
[02:38:19] here then we have our break up here
[02:38:21] which is
[02:38:23] this that would be kind of funny
[02:38:27] though see I was never I never watched
[02:38:30] SpongeBob a lot I know people that did
[02:38:32] but it was never me that watched it it
[02:38:33] was one of those I had friends and girls
[02:38:36] that I knew that watched it but I I
[02:38:37] never got into it personally

[02:58:26] all of them now to see what all of them

[02:58:46] all of them
[02:58:49] everything that was opened today here we

[02:58:55] a
[02:58:56] look
[02:58:57] first put them out here like
[02:58:59] this oh you're going to do the event oh
[02:59:02] okay um that is uh that's over here my
[02:59:05] friend okay do a little adventuring I
[02:59:08] see do a little adventuring today for a
[02:59:10] little while we'll go and show those
[02:59:12] then I guess a
[02:59:13] minute so uh who' the gift go to
[02:59:18] that went to um
[02:59:21] lady well lady you get a chance to do a
[02:59:23] little adventuring if you'd
[02:59:25] like with our adventure game now I don't
[02:59:27] know if you understand or you played it
[02:59:29] before but that is here just a very
[02:59:32] cheap thing and what it is is you have
[02:59:34] potential of getting one pack out of it
[02:59:37] but mainly it was for the people that
[02:59:38] had asked to play the little Adventure
[02:59:39] game the adventure game that we had
[02:59:40] where you could become the adventure
[02:59:43] that is wandering through our Wasteland
[02:59:45] Vault now what happens is you you'd go
[02:59:47] and you say a number between one and I
[02:59:49] think there's like 120 in here or
[02:59:51] something like that so you just give me
[02:59:53] left and I'll pull one from here and if
[02:59:56] you're lucky it gets the whole pack if
[02:59:58] not it'll say something on there that
[03:00:00] you're going to have in front of you in
[03:00:02] the in this Wasteland Vault now it's
[03:00:04] your
[03:00:05] choice where you want to go here between
[03:00:07] these I think like I said it's 120 or
[03:00:10] 160 I have to double
[03:00:12] check have to double check on that one
[03:00:18] 100 yeah was 150ish mid somewhere in the
[03:00:21] middle all right like this right here
[03:00:23] this one
[03:00:24] good going go middle right there all
[03:00:28] right you have oh did not get the pack
[03:00:30] but you do actually instead have an
[03:00:33] issue you have in front of you a large
[03:00:36] Raider so you have to make some
[03:00:38] decisions on your adventure or in this
[03:00:39] Wasteland if you want to continue
[03:00:41] playing or if you want to run away
[03:00:42] because that's a he's got a big axe
[03:00:44] there he's pretty
[03:00:45] strong and what we do is we have a thing
[03:00:48] where we roll dice to see what happens
[03:00:49] and if you attack but you have to get 17
[03:00:51] or over when it comes to rolling the
[03:00:53] dice you can run away or you can try to
[03:00:55] attack it's up to you what you want to
[03:00:57] do in the little Adventure in our little
[03:00:59] uh Wasteland Adventure game VA game that
[03:01:02] we
[03:01:07] [Laughter]
[03:01:09] have and we'll see how that goes and if
[03:01:11] you don't want to play we'll just send
[03:01:12] it back and like I
[03:01:14] said
[03:01:16] oh I guess somebody's going with uh
[03:01:18] lady's got oh a weapon Pole now all
[03:01:21] right well
[03:01:22] lady you got a weapon pole too so that
[03:01:25] means you have one from
[03:01:27] here this is all our weapons now this oh
[03:01:32] it's your mom ah oh okay that makes more
[03:01:34] sense
[03:01:39] now a lot of work to
[03:01:42] okay okay no I'm I was for I'd get off
[03:01:46] in a little bit here and help him with
[03:01:47] it too so I didn't want to I didn't want
[03:01:49] to stay on all day I want to help him
[03:01:50] with some the homework because he does
[03:01:51] have a lot left to pick up he's working
[03:01:53] on History right now okay get that
[03:01:55] finished all right all right might need
[03:01:59] help with all right I'll help him with
[03:02:00] that if he needs all right bye drive
[03:02:03] safe love
[03:02:07] you all right where would you like to go
[03:02:10] that makes more sense
[03:02:11] now anywhere in the middle you have one
[03:02:13] through I think it's like 120ish or
[03:02:17] something yeah 120 there we go it says
[03:02:19] it I can do the middle again or I can do
[03:02:22] like the front I can do back it's
[03:02:24] anywhere in these ones I split them up
[03:02:26] just using packs here to help split up
[03:02:27] so what midback so back here is this
[03:02:30] area we're going to call this one
[03:02:32] midback right here midback is oh nice
[03:02:37] you've got yourself a
[03:02:39] pistol now your pistol comes with six
[03:02:42] rounds so you now have six rounds to
[03:02:44] face
[03:02:46] off against that large raidar you saw in
[03:02:49] the front
[03:02:50] of in the front of as you open your door
[03:02:53] here right in your front of your uh
[03:02:55] Wasteland of all sorry I'm getting
[03:02:57] distracted my so there's uh so I have to
[03:03:00] I have to find that pict that video
[03:03:03] there's a video that where it's like how
[03:03:05] H men see their wives and it and then it
[03:03:07] was like it was like the wife was like
[03:03:10] doing the dishes and it's like she's
[03:03:11] dressed up and has makeup on and
[03:03:14] whatever else she looks like the like
[03:03:15] you know a model walking down the road
[03:03:17] and then she's actually in real life
[03:03:18] just got like sweatpants on a long shirt
[03:03:20] and her hair is like not even done and
[03:03:22] she's like looking at him going like why
[03:03:23] are you staring at me so that was one of
[03:03:26] those moments I think I'm taking this
[03:03:29] out I'm going shopping okay good idea
[03:03:31] right here oh lady so you have a
[03:03:34] pistol all righty oh we're going go some
[03:03:36] health I like it well health health and
[03:03:39] buff it health and Buffs this one right
[03:03:42] here and
[03:03:44] then I think the other one where did I
[03:03:47] put the other one sh I thought I had one
[03:03:49] more of them uh
[03:04:00] oh oh they are right here these are the
[03:04:02] other ones oops I forgot to put them
[03:04:03] over
[03:04:05] there double buff oh I didn't notice
[03:04:09] that one a double buff we got to get
[03:04:11] that
[03:04:13] one where would you like to go
[03:04:17] for your double
[03:04:24] buff you have the decision to make this
[03:04:27] our buff box could get maybe some health
[03:04:29] maybe you're going to get something a
[03:04:31] little make yourself oh the front the
[03:04:33] front card in the backyard like this
[03:04:35] type of
[03:04:40] thing all right front card and back card
[03:04:43] here we
[03:04:44] go you have some strength oh nice you
[03:04:49] have a strength booster there you go get
[03:04:52] yourself strength booster oh and a
[03:04:54] health pack well look at that and a
[03:04:56] health pack well that's nice would you
[03:04:59] like to
[03:05:02] uh would you like
[03:05:05] to use your strength booster to make
[03:05:09] your character
[03:05:12] stronger get over here
[03:05:24] yes all right we're going to do that
[03:05:25] we're going to
[03:05:26] plus one oh that's all right plus plus
[03:05:31] one
[03:05:32] strength so that means if you have any
[03:05:34] type of weapon that's like a knife or a
[03:05:35] sword or something you're swinging maybe
[03:05:37] you have to do something in the Venture
[03:05:38] game at some point maybe lift something
[03:05:40] that'll help there all right so right
[03:05:43] now you
[03:05:45] have a pistol
[03:05:52] with six
[03:05:55] shots and a health back plus 10 Health
[03:06:03] back all right that you could use when
[03:06:05] you need now so you have some decisions
[03:06:08] you still you have this large person you
[03:06:10] you open the door and that
[03:06:11] large Warrior is in front of you you
[03:06:14] have to make a decision on what you're
[03:06:15] going to do here do you want to attack
[03:06:18] with your pistol I mean they only do
[03:06:19] have an axe so that does mean they're
[03:06:21] going to have to kind of get near you to
[03:06:23] hit so you might be able to get one or
[03:06:24] two shots before they get at you but we
[03:06:26] never know what you can do with your
[03:06:27] pistol maybe they're really quick we
[03:06:29] don't
[03:06:31] know what would you like to do my friend
[03:06:33] I got to find where did I put
[03:06:35] my there it
[03:06:42] is that right there
[03:06:48] my uh little box thing I
[03:06:51] made attack with the pistol all right I
[03:06:53] like it we're going to attack with the
[03:06:54] pistol now you're going to Cho choose
[03:06:57] some dice here whatever ones you want
[03:07:00] that's uh you got to choose Choice here
[03:07:02] of your dice
[03:07:04] generally yeah
[03:07:09] anyways let me know what one you want to
[03:07:13] use blue and black
[03:07:20] the blue and
[03:07:22] black I don't have a blue and black one
[03:07:25] I have a blue in that
[03:07:27] one oh blue or black blue blue how's
[03:07:31] that for blue that's
[03:07:34] blue there you go blue blue it
[03:07:37] is all right here we go we're going to
[03:07:39] put that up there slide that over we're
[03:07:41] going to see what
[03:07:44] happens oh you have eight oh no I'm
[03:07:48] sorry you got two I we got to zoom in a
[03:07:50] little better can you see that
[03:07:52] better there you go background no you
[03:07:54] got a
[03:07:55] two and uh that doesn't help because
[03:07:57] your pistol only gives you a plus two so
[03:08:00] that has a four you're trying to shoot
[03:08:02] you
[03:08:03] miss you you miss wildly there and that
[03:08:07] uh that large Raider kind of just looks
[03:08:08] at you going like
[03:08:12] uh uh
[03:08:17] kind of feel sad not sure if he come
[03:08:20] come swing the axe at you or not looking
[03:08:23] at the axe and looking at you
[03:08:26] going now I think you have one chance to
[03:08:28] get something else off if you want to
[03:08:30] try one more shot before uh before he
[03:08:32] comes charging at you oh he's going for
[03:08:34] a weapon again we're going to quickly
[03:08:36] try a weapon see if we can find an extra
[03:08:38] weapon
[03:08:40] [Music]
[03:08:40] [Laughter]
[03:08:42] here I'm sorry that was just a that was
[03:08:44] that was so far off we had to had to
[03:08:47] play into it it a little
[03:08:53] bit all right you got to let me know
[03:08:54] where you want to go in the
[03:08:57] weapons that was a whiff that was yeah
[03:08:59] that was a whiff I mean it was so bad he
[03:09:01] just kind of L looked at what happened
[03:09:02] was like Wow were they shooting at me
[03:09:05] like what's going on
[03:09:07] here middle all right in the middle here
[03:09:10] we go you got a oh you got another
[03:09:12] pistol well the nice thing with the
[03:09:14] pistols and the knives you're allowed to
[03:09:16] dual wheel p pistols and
[03:09:18] knives you want to try to dual wheel
[03:09:20] your
[03:09:21] pistols and your
[03:09:24] knives and your your pistol all right
[03:09:27] we're going to throw that out there that
[03:09:28] means you're dual Wheeling means you're
[03:09:29] going to have plus four to your attack
[03:09:32] you want to try one more attack cuz you
[03:09:33] only going to get two more now is what
[03:09:35] you get here he's kind of looking at you
[03:09:36] like what's going
[03:09:38] on we're attacking again oh yeah all
[03:09:41] right here we go oh all right here we go
[03:09:43] we have a uh a natural 20
[03:09:47] look at that
[03:09:49] one
[03:09:51] beautiful that time that didn't work out
[03:09:54] in favor of the of the Raider he's kind
[03:09:55] of still looking at this thing looking
[03:09:56] at you and then you shoot with
[03:09:59] two that's a critical because of that
[03:10:02] that's a critical because you get that
[03:10:04] now that ends up getting you um that
[03:10:06] that guy is at a 40 health so that
[03:10:08] brings that one down to let's do my
[03:10:10] Randomness random under all o nice
[03:10:15] that's a good one that brings it down to
[03:10:17] 13 that was a good hit that that uh that
[03:10:21] big Raider drops to one knee drops the
[03:10:25] axe to the ground after being shot four
[03:10:27] shots right to the chest with that that
[03:10:29] was a good shot there bud we like it you
[03:10:32] have another opportunity because he's
[03:10:34] starting to get up to charge towards you
[03:10:36] and this is your last chance to shoot or
[03:10:39] turn and run cuz he could get one big
[03:10:41] hit on you knocking you out and maybe
[03:10:42] loot all of your stuff or you think you
[03:10:44] get the luck to take him out it's up to
[03:10:46] you
[03:10:49] what do you think you're gonna
[03:10:54] do oh yeah got a couple shots off on
[03:10:57] that one but that does bring you down
[03:11:00] though you have two pistols but you are
[03:11:04] that means you're at
[03:11:08] um nine shots
[03:11:11] left tack you run towards him wildly not
[03:11:15] carrying going I'm going to take you out
[03:11:18] and you do you get
[03:11:20] 16 which brings you right up to 20 and
[03:11:24] that Raider gets shot right in the
[03:11:28] head two shots to the head right to the
[03:11:31] ground right to the
[03:11:34] ground and there on the ground the later
[03:11:36] Raider is you go over look at him you go
[03:11:41] H as
[03:11:43] this Adventurer and because it's a large
[03:11:46] Raider
[03:11:48] you actually
[03:11:49] get a few pgs you find which you find is
[03:11:52] one two three four five six that's our
[03:11:54] wastling currency by the way kind of you
[03:11:57] know anyways and then we have
[03:12:00] uh here you also get some assault rifle
[03:12:05] ammo which really doesn't make any sense
[03:12:07] as he had an axe on them but you do
[03:12:10] actually get the axe but the ax is kind
[03:12:11] of broken up that's why he wasn't really
[03:12:13] charging at you too much you're only
[03:12:15] going to get like three Swings with that
[03:12:16] axe unless you have somebody that can
[03:12:17] fix it or you find a person that can fix
[03:12:20] it at a safe haven somewhere but right
[03:12:22] now you got
[03:12:24] yourself we'll
[03:12:26] say half
[03:12:30] axe I thought that was kind of funny but
[03:12:33] was funny as that not as funny as it
[03:12:36] would that was a really bad like Dad
[03:12:41] joke H anyways six box
[03:12:47] [Music]
[03:12:48] six
[03:12:49] pogs and you have uh 15 AR
[03:12:53] ammo which randomly had on
[03:12:56] them so there we go that's your
[03:12:58] character right there standing
[03:13:00] over got through that door and you won
[03:13:02] at least you've made it in to that Vault
[03:13:04] now and we're going to see what happens
[03:13:06] what happens to those people in the
[03:13:07] vault as I travel because eventually
[03:13:09] somebody I hopefully can make it to the
[03:13:11] first door we haven't had anybody make
[03:13:14] it to the first door yet because I want
[03:13:15] to know if anybody's going to get to our
[03:13:16] B boss of the first level but anyways
[03:13:20] there's our pogs there for you we'll see
[03:13:22] what happens it's pretty fun little
[03:13:23] thing take some time just play a little
[03:13:25] game here have a little fun with
[03:13:26] everyone for a little bit I don't know
[03:13:28] it's
[03:13:30] uh I don't know fun thing I don't know
[03:13:33] just a little fun game
[03:13:39] really I guess I'm uh somebody made a
[03:13:41] comment to me before like I need to be a
[03:13:43] dungeon master or something like that or
[03:13:45] I'm like H well I'll look into doing it
[03:13:48] maybe at some points I was I was
[03:13:50] thinking of maybe doing it on uh there's
[03:13:52] ways of doing it through roll 20 and
[03:13:53] stuff so I was thinking of making some
[03:13:54] of these and putting them into it since
[03:13:56] I already have them kind of pre-built
[03:13:57] already I think I just need to make some
[03:14:00] maps because I already have like kind of
[03:14:01] like the stories in the characters and
[03:14:03] the the pictures for them so I'm
[03:14:06] figuring I if I make maps and then I do
[03:14:08] that and set it up in roll 20 we could
[03:14:09] do some games but I don't know if you
[03:14:12] guys would like doing that or not or if
[03:14:14] that's like silly
[03:14:18] what I'm going to do right now though is

[03:19:17] have a
[03:19:20] pistol plus two get a
[03:19:24] knife plus
[03:19:25] two ooh a plasma rifle there you go and
[03:19:29] you get another knife you get a pistol
[03:19:32] and a pistol and a knife and a pistol oh
[03:19:36] nice on the plasma rifle dude there you
[03:19:39] go you have plasma rifles you have two
[03:19:42] of those
[03:19:44] now that was nice you got a lot of
[03:19:46] pistols there are you going to hand them
[03:19:48] out to you wanted a second
[03:19:52] plasma there you go well you got one
[03:19:54] well you got one there and then will get
[03:19:57] you uh you have your knives you have
[03:19:59] pistols times uh times well how many now
[03:20:02] you're going to have to go to the um one
[03:20:03] two three four
[03:20:06] five you have to go and drop some of
[03:20:09] these off because you can't carry all
[03:20:10] these you can't carry all this into your
[03:20:12] inventory here so you're going to have
[03:20:14] to make sure you either hand some of
[03:20:15] them over to some friend friends or
[03:20:18] you're not going to be moving or you're
[03:20:20] going to have to hand some um maybe
[03:20:22] maybe you'll be lucky enough that you
[03:20:24] can come back and pick it up later if
[03:20:25] you're lucky that it's still there but
[03:20:28] you need
[03:20:30] uh four
[03:20:36] knives give two pistols to your mom we
[03:20:38] can do that all right do that oh
[03:20:55] okay do that give two there so that's
[03:21:00] four
[03:21:01] pistols then you've
[03:21:03] got instead of six times that means you
[03:21:06] get four all
[03:21:09] right then uh what else you going to do
[03:21:11] with the rest because you do have the
[03:21:12] plasma
[03:21:13] rifle you have the knives too
[03:21:17] so you have to decide on those four
[03:21:25] knives you're very
[03:21:27] welcome for getting those over your son
[03:21:29] got some good luck with those and get
[03:21:30] some got yourself some more pistols now
[03:21:32] the nice thing is I do
[03:21:35] believe oh no you don't have any more of
[03:21:38] the um I think you didn't you don't have
[03:21:40] any more uh codes left to get into a uh
[03:21:43] Safe Haven but should you need to either
[03:21:45] trade some of these or something
[03:21:48] you do not have a stash boox at a safe
[03:21:50] house what you do have is the ability to
[03:21:52] go to the safe havens and um sell off
[03:21:57] stuff so you can get
[03:22:00] pogs yes you can go going to go to the
[03:22:03] safe havens and do that and sell
[03:22:06] correct and I think you had you had
[03:22:08] access one before but your code's no
[03:22:11] longer working I think because if I
[03:22:13] remember right but
[03:22:17] you could try it and see what happens it
[03:22:19] might work I don't know I think the code
[03:22:20] was ran
[03:22:27] out L you know can't get the lock room
[03:22:30] if you don't know how to get into it try
[03:22:32] the code anyways all right let's go over
[03:22:33] we're going to try the code we'll try it
[03:22:35] one time right now it was
[03:22:38] uh go over and I think may have been
[03:22:40] this
[03:22:42] one it work oh look at that that Gage
[03:22:48] looks over here hey what are you doing
[03:22:52] here so your choice what are you g to
[03:22:55] talk to what are you gonna
[03:23:00] say what do you want Gage to
[03:23:06] know his eyes cocked he's looking at you
[03:23:09] like
[03:23:10] H so all the spares you just got all
[03:23:12] right so you got one two three four
[03:23:14] knives and you're going to sell four
[03:23:16] pistols I'm guessing so you only have
[03:23:22] two all right so sell on those so you
[03:23:24] only have two pistols all right so four
[03:23:26] pistols and four knives because you
[03:23:28] don't want the knives I'm
[03:23:30] guessing keep the ammo though all right
[03:23:32] keeping all the ammo sounds like a good
[03:23:34] idea so those are times six on the ammo
[03:23:37] there I forgot to do that pistol times
[03:23:39] six would be that's on that already
[03:23:43] though you're going to be on
[03:23:44] 42 because of the the extras you already
[03:23:47] had 42 ammo for your pistol and you're
[03:23:50] down
[03:23:51] to two of them no you have to sell Two
[03:23:54] Pistols because you gave two to your mom
[03:23:55] so you're only selling Two Pistols
[03:23:57] because you gave two to your mom all
[03:23:58] right so two pistols and four
[03:24:01] knives no knives all right you want to
[03:24:04] get rid of all the knives okay cool all
[03:24:06] righty so pistols he's looking at you he
[03:24:08] goes pistols are uh give you three pogs
[03:24:12] for each of those and uh the knives and
[03:24:14] give you a Pog each
[03:24:18] looking at
[03:24:19] you day take the deal deal all right so
[03:24:23] that's six S8 nine
[03:24:26] 10 all right he reaches into his pocket
[03:24:29] he pulls out and drops one of them on
[03:24:32] there goes there you go
[03:24:34] Bud hand you over your uh your 10 pogs
[03:24:36] you look at that what's this go this is
[03:24:38] The Slammer this this is your pogs your
[03:24:39] 10 your 10
[03:24:42] now all right so there you go you've now
[03:24:45] disseminated all of your all of your
[03:24:47] items I'm going to put this and I'll
[03:24:49] send these uh out to you and your mom
[03:24:55] there I wrote her name
[03:25:02] down okay we are
[03:25:05] caged there you go you got yourself some
[03:25:08] pogs now we'll add that into your
[03:25:10] already collection here let's see what
[03:25:12] you got in your collection of pogs
[03:25:13] already you have six pogs from before
[03:25:15] you're now up to 16
[03:25:17] there you go there you go my friend put
[03:25:21] a little
[03:25:24] Adventure
[03:25:28] now now depending on what you want to
[03:25:31] do like I said I would I would recommend
[03:25:35] getting some friends along to go on one
[03:25:36] of the main Adventure ones to get into
[03:25:39] your door because you can get have
[03:25:40] couple friends with you because when you
[03:25:42] only go from the the other Adventure one
[03:25:43] you only get to do you by yourself
[03:25:46] but if you want to go with your big
[03:25:48] adventure and you want to have a group
[03:25:49] of people you jump on on the main
[03:25:52] Adventure that a main Adventure will
[03:25:54] allow you to bring a couple friends
[03:25:55] along if you want to have some friends
[03:25:57] to come along with
[03:26:01] you oh no problem hey you can jump in
[03:26:04] whenever you guys want well you know
[03:26:05] what I'm probably actually going have to
[03:26:06] jump off here in a few minutes and I
[03:26:09] think what I'll do again here is I'll do
[03:26:11] one giveaway say thank you guys for
[03:26:13] hanging out for a little
[03:26:15] while and and um then what we'll do is
[03:26:19] after that where did my cards
[03:26:21] go oh I put them right here one two
[03:26:24] three four five six seven eight nine 10
[03:26:27] I did put them right there yes I did all
[03:26:29] right that'll be one of the giveaway
[03:26:30] ones
[03:26:32] yeah and then I know you you're getting
[03:26:35] ready I think cage is preparing for um
[03:26:38] preparing for battle coming up here soon
[03:26:41] see if he can get through that
[03:26:43] um I think I just dropped one
[03:26:47] no I didn't see if he can get through
[03:26:48] that uh boss at the end of level
[03:26:51] [Laughter]
[03:26:53] one got to watch out you ran into one of
[03:26:55] his his kin
[03:26:58] earlier all right hey okay that's what I
[03:27:00] was going to say to you H after here um
[03:27:01] so we have two options for you bud I can
[03:27:04] give you um packs equivalent to the
[03:27:06] price of what you paid for or you can
[03:27:09] ask for a refund and I'll refund it for
[03:27:10] you AK and that's what we'll do it's up
[03:27:13] to you whatever you'd like to do
[03:27:16] or um maybe there's some singles or
[03:27:18] something like that you want that I have
[03:27:20] something like that we can do towards it
[03:27:21] too I'm sorry I'm sorry there's not
[03:27:23] enough people jumped in on it I guess I
[03:27:24] was expecting more people to want the uh
[03:27:26] Marvel but I guess I uh over calculated
[03:27:29] that one on luckily I only gra not what
[03:27:31] I wanted for the family and I didn't
[03:27:32] like overdo it like other people and I
[03:27:35] wasn't here early enough to uh get the
[03:27:36] hype going so that's my problem I was
[03:27:39] out of the
[03:27:41] country yeah people just not on yet
[03:27:43] early in the morning
[03:27:48] well the other thing too is AK is I can
[03:27:49] try and do it tomorrow uh tomorrow
[03:27:51] morning um and start it tomorrow morning
[03:27:54] if you want me to because I can go one
[03:27:55] other day extra with it if you'd like
[03:27:58] they're they allow me to do like kind of
[03:28:00] as long as I get it out within the F two
[03:28:01] days for shipping for you I'm okay with
[03:28:04] that or that's okay with it so if I can
[03:28:05] hold I can roll it
[03:28:08] over merely interesting you know I'll
[03:28:10] check it out maybe tonight then maybe
[03:28:11] I'll jump on tonight for a little while
[03:28:13] since uh instead AK but my point is
[03:28:16] whenever I jump on next I'll run it
[03:28:18] again so maybe I'll do that tonight and
[03:28:20] see what we'll go with some uh
[03:28:22] some
[03:28:25] uh Marvel at that
[03:28:28] point because that makes sense people
[03:28:30] aren't up early because this is Saturday
[03:28:32] people go out drinking and having stuff
[03:28:34] I'll try some packs for now all right
[03:28:35] that sounds good not a problem Perfecto
[03:28:37] and I'm sorry about that like I said I I
[03:28:39] I can give you guys options on what you
[03:28:40] want to do that way you get your um you
[03:28:43] get your choice on what you want here
[03:28:44] all right so
[03:28:46] um since you have that there we will do
[03:28:48] it here is
[03:28:52] uh let me get what it
[03:28:55] was refresh this so I see it
[03:29:04] all 45

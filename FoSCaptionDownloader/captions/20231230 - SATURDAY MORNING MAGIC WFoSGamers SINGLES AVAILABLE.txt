[00:32:42] but that ain't gonna
[00:32:44] happen ain't getting ice cream right
[00:32:48] now yeah I just I just do a three-pack
[00:32:50] deals the reason why I do three-pack
[00:32:52] deals is it helps me save on whatnot
[00:32:54] fees so by Saving on whatnot fees I you
[00:32:56] I pass it over to you you know pretty
[00:32:58] much what's Will's mini game all right
[00:33:01] so Will's mini game is actually a very
[00:33:04] simple mini game he is a doctor who fan
[00:33:07] so Will's mini game is you
[00:33:11] buy one two whatever you want out of
[00:33:13] here currently I think there is 43 cards
[00:33:16] in here there has been one two times
[00:33:20] drct hoop ped but there are so there's
[00:33:23] four two times doctor hoop pulled out of
[00:33:27] 43 packs that are left in here there
[00:33:29] were 50 and there were five times two
[00:33:31] times Doctor Who so what it is is
[00:33:33] there's one L there's all lands Doctor
[00:33:34] Who in there if you pull out a land uh
[00:33:37] you get a doctor who pack guaranteed but
[00:33:39] if you pull out one that says two times
[00:33:40] Doctor Who written on it you get two
[00:33:42] Doctor Who uh packs and that's literally
[00:33:45] what Will's mini game was and I was just
[00:33:46] giving you how many were in there there
[00:33:48] was there were five and 50 cards and
[00:33:51] five of them said two times Doctor Who I
[00:33:53] think four two times Doctor Who are left
[00:33:55] I believe it's at like 42 cards in there
[00:33:58] now but that's what Will's mini game is
[00:34:00] he wanted to think it up because he
[00:34:02] decided he wanted a little bit of a mini
[00:34:03] game because he uh that was his
[00:34:06] uh this is like one of his favorite TV
[00:34:09] shows he watches that's what Will's mini
[00:34:11] game is
[00:34:15] there then just little simple thing yep
[00:34:19] but I'm going to throw this up what did
[00:34:21] I do I forgot to throw did I throw these

[00:44:41] to $70 I don't know which version of it
[00:44:44] is definitely a really good tribal Deck
[00:44:47] card
[00:44:49] yes uh unless it's dropped that used to
[00:44:51] be like a 30 to $70
[00:44:54] card definitely really really good for

[00:46:05] pack convoke Source control nice those
[00:46:09] good three rares for that
[00:46:11] set I think it may have dropped since
[00:46:13] it's been reprinted a few many times
[00:46:15] really good ah might be it might only be
[00:46:17] down to like 20 or something then I
[00:46:19] wonder if actually you know maybe it's
[00:46:20] dropped down even lower but it used to
[00:46:22] be a high value card before it was all
[00:46:24] reprinted yeah and I hate when they get
[00:46:26] reprinted and then you have a hard time
[00:46:28] knowing that Kindred dropped a lot whoa
[00:46:32] [ __ ] it used to be like used to be like
[00:46:35] 30
[00:46:37] bucks
[00:46:39] damn that did drop a lot it's a really
[00:46:42] good card to be playing though in a
[00:46:43] tribal deck either
[00:46:49] way oh wow it used to be like 20 it used
[00:46:52] to be like 30 to 70 I couldn't I know
[00:46:54] the anime one was a Higher One when it
[00:46:57] was first pulled out but even the
[00:46:58] original one was still good ancestors
[00:47:01] Aid panicked altisaur let's get that
[00:47:05] monoc Crypt or or the stamp Jurassic
[00:47:07] Park that' be nice too dead weight
[00:47:10] captivating cave sorceress spy glass bat
[00:47:15] Colony I mean or the red monoc Crypt
[00:47:17] everybody would freak out on that one
[00:47:19] Captain storm cosium Raider

[00:47:26] Throne of the Grim
[00:47:28] Captain thousand Moon
[00:47:30] Smitty Master of the dark rights you
[00:47:33] don't see that one frequently actually

[00:47:39] showcase you got a island for your
[00:47:44] um Jurassic Park there and a cosium
[00:47:49] Confluence
[00:47:50] foil and then a
[00:47:53] Matt that's what you got out of that one
[00:47:56] there nice that Master of dark rights
[00:47:59] doesn't come out much you got yourself a
[00:48:02] few nice dros there and then they enim
[00:48:04] pical not too
[00:48:06] bad not too bad wow I can't believe
[00:48:09] Kindred discoveries dropped so
[00:48:15] much thank you stop it do appreciate
[00:48:19] that we do appreciate
[00:48:24] that
[00:48:27] I can't believe that dropped so much but
[00:48:30] that's okay it happens it's a good card
[00:48:31] to have in tribal it's probably the
[00:48:33] reprints that have done it I hate when
[00:48:35] the reprints you all of a sudden like oh
[00:48:37] they reprinted it and now it's down to
[00:48:38] this much like go well now we don't know
[00:48:43] but I do at the same time like when they
[00:48:45] do that because then the card becomes
[00:48:47] more available to to be able to play and
[00:48:49] you don't have to have to spend like
[00:48:50] $1,000 Dollar on a deck to have a sweet
[00:48:53] deck to play see it's like it's like
[00:48:55] it's like a Catch 22 there you
[00:48:59] know because when you get it then you're
[00:49:01] like oh sweet I got this awesome card
[00:49:04] and then you then then you like get this
[00:49:06] money card and then it disappears like
[00:49:07] oh that money card's
[00:49:11] gone but you still have a sweet card to
[00:49:14] play and that was some good dinos out of

[00:54:56] to my show I don't
[00:54:58] know got some Chris oh Chris wants to
[00:55:01] try that Commander Masters the nice
[00:55:03] thing about the commander Masters is you
[00:55:05] get 20 good cards you don't get 15 cards
[00:55:08] sorry for this the the CR crunch crunch
[00:55:10] crunch of the paper my wife's in the
[00:55:11] background taping something out you get
[00:55:13] you get 20 good cards to play with and
[00:55:15] they're all Commander Masters they're
[00:55:16] all playable cards that's the cool thing
[00:55:18] about
[00:55:21] it I know people have love hate
[00:55:23] relationship Commander Masters but
[00:55:24] honestly
[00:55:25] you know it's it's I I don't like what
[00:55:28] they did with the collector boosters
[00:55:30] personally if they did better with the
[00:55:33] um hey thank you Chris you want me to
[00:55:35] rip these babies open or would you like
[00:55:37] me to ship them most people like them
[00:55:41] ripped I like Commander Masters like
[00:55:44] when it comes to some of the maybe the
[00:55:45] draft and the sets but I think the
[00:55:46] collector boosters were just too much
[00:55:48] rip it and I think that's where I I
[00:55:50] would get it because like I they have
[00:55:51] good cards in here for putting into into
[00:55:53] decks and when you get get 20 cards here
[00:55:56] in a draft that's that's pretty good and
[00:56:00] they're all like good playable cards
[00:56:01] generally like very rarely out of here
[00:56:03] do I get like do you get cards that
[00:56:05] you're like Ah that's nothing I can play
[00:56:07] with wow this pack just doesn't want to
[00:56:10] open huh here we go I think they do this
[00:56:13] here where one two three four and five
[00:56:17] they put the spoilers on the front so we
[00:56:19] move those to the back because we don't

[01:46:17] there there's a few things from um
[01:46:21] drafts or the
[01:46:22] old L of the Rings in there but most of
[01:46:25] it is the new collector boosters that is
[01:46:27] in that L of the Rings box thank you The
[01:46:30] Chariot do appreciate that a lot you
[01:46:33] know what hey Chariot if you like that L
[01:46:35] of the Rings box let me do this for you
[01:46:37] let me do this for
[01:46:40] you I will do this nine polls from Lord
[01:46:44] of the Rings and instead of it being
[01:46:47] 15 I will do it for 13 if you want to
[01:46:50] try luck and you want to do nine PS from
[01:46:51] that Lord of the Rings if you want to
[01:46:52] see if you can get that one ring out of
[01:46:57] there that's up to anyone here throw a
[01:47:00] little bit of a deal on for that Lord of
[01:47:01] the Rings box if somebody wants to try
[01:47:03] their luck and then what I'm going to do
[01:47:06] here is boys I'd like somebody to come
[01:47:08] and pick out three packs for
[01:47:10] me do a pack deal
[01:47:14] here come on
[01:47:17] will actually both of you can come over
[01:47:19] and hang out here on your
[01:47:23] po come on
[01:47:26] over
[01:47:28] huh yeah yes do that over here could I
[01:47:31] do a special classic pack possibly
[01:47:36] lower
[01:47:38] [Music]
[01:47:41] um I can do
[01:47:45] a there's none of those left don't
[01:47:48] William don't do that put William that
[01:47:51] is not appropriate don't do that pick
[01:47:52] that up and put it back I have a whole
[01:47:53] new box of them the reason why I had
[01:47:55] that left
[01:47:56] there uh special edition lower I don't
[01:47:59] know if I can do it lower let me
[01:48:10] see what if we um I mean if you were
[01:48:14] going to
[01:48:17] do one
[01:48:19] pack
[01:48:21] uh um I can do it when we I can drop a
[01:48:24] little bit if we're going to do multiple
[01:48:25] packs so is there something else that
[01:48:26] you want like uh maybe there's another
[01:48:29] like uh maybe a draft or a set of
[01:48:31] something because if you do multiple
[01:48:33] packs I'm able to drop I give you a
[01:48:34] little bit of a
[01:48:36] discount does that sound like something
[01:48:38] you could do maybe you want like uh you
[01:48:40] know an Exelon draft a couple Exelon
[01:48:42] draft and then instead of it I can make
[01:48:45] it be instead of
[01:48:48] 31 hold on
[01:48:51] because it would be 31 normally for that
[01:48:53] pack so let me do this for
[01:49:07] you we could do both all those for
[01:49:19] um
[01:49:26] I could do those three for like
[01:49:28] 306 if you
[01:49:30] want like I could do um a Lord of the
[01:49:35] Rings and we'll say two Exelon draft and
[01:49:39] I'll do those for 36 does that sound
[01:49:43] like something that you'd want to
[01:49:45] do all
[01:49:49] right
[01:49:54] there you
[01:49:55] go 36 you get two drafts vixon and a
[01:49:59] Lord of the
[01:50:04] Rings yeah I can make deals when it
[01:50:06] comes to multiple packs just because of
[01:50:08] the fees with whatnot or like multiple
[01:50:10] things like say you wanted to do like uh
[01:50:13] a lost Caverns xon pull box and a lost
[01:50:18] Caverns xlon collector boost
[01:50:20] and a doctor who pole box then I'm able
[01:50:23] to do some discounts just because the
[01:50:24] way whatnot does their fees if you do
[01:50:26] multiple things together it helps me so
[01:50:28] I kind of pass that on to you guys
[01:50:31] that's pretty much why I do that type of
[01:50:35] thing about 36 here not a bad deal for
[01:50:39] these
[01:50:41] three and then what we I'll do is I'll
[01:50:43] open the two drafts and uh let me know
[01:50:46] we have one two on the left and one two
[01:50:50] three on the right where you would like

[03:56:32] out nobody wanted those that's all
[03:56:37] right so we'll put those back
[03:56:41] here and I'm going to do a you know what
[03:56:46] let's do
[03:56:53] this let's do this here this is normally
[03:56:59] a 17 this is normally
[03:57:02] $17 but I'm going to do it for 15 so I
[03:57:05] can explain how it works the mystery
[03:57:08] packs you pick three mystery packs out
[03:57:11] you line each Mystery Pack up in front
[03:57:13] of one of these boxes here which is
[03:57:16] either the son's box the buyer's box or
[03:57:19] the father's box now the father's box
[03:57:21] might just you know might be just a card
[03:57:23] could be a a another pack maybe it's a
[03:57:25] car that you might want to play with
[03:57:26] what happens is you get these lined up
[03:57:28] in front when you pull them out of this
[03:57:30] mystery box over
[03:57:32] here and then what happens is we flip
[03:57:35] them over and you see all right you got
[03:57:36] a modern Horizon 2 draft for x be one
[03:57:39] set in a midnight hunt draft and what
[03:57:41] you would end up doing is we'd rip these
[03:57:43] packs open and whichever one had the
[03:57:45] highest Mana value is the one that hits
[03:57:46] its Target and that is the one you get
[03:57:48] an extra pull from if you want to try
[03:57:50] your luck on that three mystery packs
[03:57:53] carnival game and that with the free
[03:57:55] carnival game added in now if you're
[03:57:57] lucky maybe you get one of the collector
[03:57:58] boosters that's there I don't know maybe
[03:58:01] you get yourself it's any of the draft
[03:58:03] or or um drafts Seth boosters or
[03:58:07] collector boost in my buy now are mixed
[03:58:12] into the mystery packs so you can try it
[03:58:15] out maybe you get yourself something
[03:58:16] extra and have a fun little game
[03:58:22] here no not Yu-Gi-Oh this is Magic the

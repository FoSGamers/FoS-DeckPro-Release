FoSGamers C.A.R.D.S. System

Comprehensive Asset and Revenue Data System (Cards)

Objective: Create a fully integrated inventory management system that tracks, updates, and maintains product details like individual cards, sealed products, accessories, and other related merchandise in a modular format so that features can be added without breaking any previous functionality.


---

Core Components

1. Inventory Tracking

The system will track inventory items across categories:

Individual Cards

Sealed Products (Boxes, Packs, Bundles, Cases)

Custom Packs (Handmade packs you create)

Accessories (e.g., sleeves, playmats, deck boxes)

Pull Box/Custom Box Setup


You will need to input the following details into the system for each product:

Product Category (dropdown list: Cards, Sealed Product, Accessories, Pull Box)

Set Name (dropdown: Magic the Gathering, Sorcery, etc.)

Product Name (e.g., card name, pack name)

Quantity (ensure no negative numbers can be input)

Cost per Unit

Selling Price per Unit

Shipping Material Cost (allow customization per transaction, like bubble mailer, top loader, etc.)

Whatnot Fees (calculated dynamically based on sales, to include 8% Whatnot fees, payment processing, and shipping ranges)

Total Cost

Total Revenue

Notes


2. Automatic Profit Calculation

The system should calculate profit based on:

Sale price – Cost price – Whatnot fee (or other marketplace fee)

It must take into account various shipping materials, which you provided prices for, and calculate the profit based on total cost factors:

Envelope costs

Top loader costs

Stickers

Any reusable or non-reusable materials for shipping



Profit formula:
Profit = (Selling Price – Cost per Unit – Whatnot Fee – Shipping Costs)

3. User Input & Google Form Structure

The initial stage will involve a Google Form that captures all required product details. It must include all essential fields from the start but remain modular for future enhancements.

Form Fields:

Timestamp (auto-generated)

Product Category (Dropdown: Sealed Products, Individual Cards, Accessories)

Set Name (Dropdown for product set names—Magic, Sorcery, etc.)

Product Name (Text field)

Quantity (Numeric field; ensure no negative values)

Cost per Unit (Numeric field)

Selling Price per Unit (Numeric field)

Shipping Material Cost (Dropdown based on your materials list)

Whatnot Fee (Auto-calculated formula)

Total Cost (Auto-calculated formula)

Revenue Potential (Auto-calculated formula)

Notes (Text field)



4. Product Import Capability

Once Manabox or any app is used to export a CSV, create a script that maps and imports the fields into the Google Sheet. Allow manual overrides for missing fields like price if it wasn’t included in the CSV export.

5. Modular Future Enhancements

The system should be flexible for future stages:

Stage 2: Automation with Whatnot (Selenium implementation)

Stage 3: Profit tracking at a more advanced level, incorporating total revenue over time.

Stage 4: Picture automation using AI (possibly integrating Monobox and TCGPlayer for pulling product images).

Stage 5: Advanced Pull Box generation functionality that allows you to set filler cards, high-value items, and custom parameters for each generated box.



---

Example for a Stage 1 Implementation

Here’s how Stage 1 looks like from start to finish:

1. Create Google Form:

Add all necessary fields (Product Category, Set Name, etc.)

Set validation rules (e.g., no negative quantities).



2. Set Up Google Sheet:

Link your Google Form to a Google Sheet.

In the Sheet, set up formulas to automatically calculate profit, revenue, and costs based on the values entered.



3. Profit Calculation Formula:

Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price - Whatnot Fees - Shipping Material Costs



4. Import Functionality:

Create a basic manual system for importing product lists from Manabox, using a simple CSV upload function.

Allow manual adjustments to imported data.





---

Next Steps

Once Stage 1 is working:

Start adding automation steps for Whatnot via Selenium.

Move into image automation with TCGPlayer.


To sum up: This document can serve as your reference for Stage 1 setup, allowing you to start building and tracking your inventory accurately from Day 1, with room to expand as needed in future stages.

**c. Implementing Formulas:**

1. **Whatnot Fees:**
   - Assuming Whatnot Fees are 8%, you can calculate this as:
     ```
     = [Selling Price per Unit] * 0.08
     ```
   - Example (if Selling Price is in column F):
     ```
     = F2 * 0.08
     ```

2. **Total Cost:**
   - Sum of Cost per Unit, Shipping Material Cost, and Whatnot Fees:
     ```
     = [Cost per Unit] + [Shipping Material Cost] + [Whatnot Fees]
     ```
   - Example:
     ```
     = D2 + G2 + H2
     ```

3. **Revenue Potential:**
   - Total Revenue from the sale:
     ```
     = [Selling Price per Unit] * [Quantity]
     ```
   - Example:
     ```
     = F2 * E2
     ```

4. **Profit:**
   - Using the provided formula:
     ```
     = (Selling Price – Cost per Unit – Whatnot Fee – Shipping Costs) * Quantity
     ```
   - Example:
     ```
     = (F2 - D2 - H2 - G2) * E2
     ```

**d. Applying Formulas:**
   - Enter these formulas in the respective columns (e.g., Whatnot Fees in column H, Total Cost in column I, Revenue Potential in column J, and Profit in column K).
   - Drag the formulas down to apply them to all future rows or use ArrayFormulas for dynamic calculation.

### **3. Setting Up the Import Functionality**

**a. Preparing for CSV Imports:**
   - When exporting data from Manabox or similar apps, ensure the CSV fields match the Google Sheet columns. Common fields include Product Name, Quantity, Cost per Unit, etc.

**b. Using Google Apps Script for Automation:**
   - **Access Apps Script:**
     - In your Google Sheet, navigate to **Extensions > Apps Script**.

   - **Script to Import CSV:**
     - Here's a basic script to import CSV data into your Sheet:
       ```javascript
       function importCSV() {
         var file = DriveApp.getFilesByName('yourfile.csv').next();
         var csvData = Utilities.parseCsv(file.getBlob().getDataAsString());
         var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName('Form Responses 1'); // Adjust if your sheet has a different name
         
         // Skip the header row in the CSV
         for(var i = 1; i < csvData.length; i++) {
           sheet.appendRow(csvData[i]);
         }
       }
       ```
     - **Customization:**
       - Replace `'yourfile.csv'` with the actual file name.
       - Adjust the sheet name if different.
       - Implement error handling and checks as needed.

   - **Manual Overrides:**
     - After importing, review the data in the Sheet to manually adjust any missing fields like price.

**c. Automating the Import Process (Optional):**
   - Set up triggers in Apps Script to run the import function at specific intervals or upon file upload.

### **4. Ensuring Data Integrity and Validation**

Enhance this to whatever I would need to include to use for this type of product stuff in store and business that I use it for. I want to make sure everything is included in there, that I'm not going to miss anything. And then also, you know, formulas and things like that that I would need to do there, I'd like to have that put in there. And I would like to have everything fully expanded, all the stages, so they are fully able to be completed by a 9-year-old. As in, like, the 9-year-old can build this thing that's never built before. No one's ever done this. No one's done anything. The 9-year-old will be able to look at the instructions and go, Oh, this is how I build FOS Gamers cards. So that's why I'm trying to get this across. And make sure you use FOS Gamers right. You're not going to do it right. Please make sure you spell it correctly.

   # Set up the WebDriver
   driver_path = 'path/to/chromedriver'  # Replace with your ChromeDriver path
   driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=driver_path)

   # Open Whatnot and log in
   driver.get('https://www.whatnot.com/login')
   time.sleep(3)  # Wait for the page to load

   # Enter login credentials
   username = driver.find_element_by_name('username')  # Adjust based on actual field name
   password = driver.find_element_by_name('password')  # Adjust based on actual field name
   username.send_keys('your_username')  # Replace with your username
   password.send_keys('your_password')  # Replace with your password
   password.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)
   time.sleep(5)  # Wait for login to complete

   # Navigate to sales page
   driver.get('https://www.whatnot.com/sales')  # Replace with actual sales page URL
   time.sleep(5)

   # Extract sales data
   sales_data = []
   sales_elements = driver.find_elements_by_class_name('sale-row')  # Adjust based on actual class name

   for sale in sales_elements:
       product_name = sale.find_element_by_class_name('product-name').text
       quantity = sale.find_element_by_class_name('quantity').text
       price = sale.find_element_by_class_name('price').text
       sales_data.append([product_name, quantity, price])

   driver.quit()

   # Write sales data to CSV
   with open('whatnot_sales.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
       writer = csv.writer(file)
       writer.writerow(['Product Name', 'Quantity Sold', 'Sale Price'])
       writer.writerows(sales_data)
   ```

   **d. Customize the Script:**

   - **Replace placeholders** with your actual data:
     - `'path/to/chromedriver'`: The path where you saved ChromeDriver.
     - `'your_username'` and `'your_password'`: Your Whatnot login credentials.
     - Adjust the element names (`'username'`, `'password'`, `'sale-row'`, etc.) based on Whatnot’s actual website structure. You may need to inspect the webpage elements to get the correct identifiers.

**d. Running the Script:**

1. **Open Command Prompt or Terminal.**

   - Check the **“Pull Boxes”** sheet to see the generated pull boxes.

**f. Managing Inventory After Pull Box Generation:**

1. **Deduct Filler Cards from Inventory:**

   - Update the **Quantity** column for each filler card used in the pull box.
   - This can be automated within the script by subtracting the used quantities.

2. **Handle High-Value Items:**

   - If a high-value item is included, ensure its quantity is also updated accordingly.

### **3. Creating Custom Pull Boxes**

Allow users to define specific parameters for each pull box, providing flexibility and customization.

**a. User Input via Google Form:**

Ensure that users can specify all necessary parameters when creating a pull box.

**b. Automating Customization:**

The **“generatePullBox”** script should account for custom parameters to include specific cards or rules.

**c. Tracking Generated Pull Boxes:**

Maintain a log of all generated pull boxes with details to prevent duplication and manage inventory effectively.

Anything that has to do with, like, development type stuff and programming should go towards the end, since that will take a lot of knowledge to do. Anything else that can be done without having that done, we should do that first. And it's Manabox, so make sure you have that spelled correctly. Use whatever knowledge you need. This is something related to the, you know, Magic the Gathering stuff.

     var pullBoxSheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName('Pull Boxes');
     if(!pullBoxSheet) {
       pullBoxSheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().insertSheet('Pull Boxes');
       pullBoxSheet.appendRow(['Pull Box Name', 'Filler Cards', 'High-Value Items']);
     }
     
     for(var i = 1; i < data.length; i++) {
       var pullBoxName = data[i][/* Column Index for Pull Box Name */]; // Replace with actual index
       var numFiller = data[i][/* Column Index for Number of Filler Cards */]; // Replace with actual index
       var includeHighValue = data[i][/* Column Index for Include High-Value Items */]; // Replace with actual index
       var highValueItem = includeHighValue ? data[i][/* Column Index for High-Value Item Selection */] : '';
       
       if(pullBoxName && !data[i][/* Column Index for Generated */]) { // Replace with actual index
         var fillerCards = selectRandomProducts('Individual Cards', numFiller);
         
         if(includeHighValue && highValueItem) {
           fillerCards.push(highValueItem);

Requested Automations and Stage Breakdown

This document outlines the modular build of your automated inventory tracking system. The goal is to start with a basic structure, ensuring it works well, and progressively add automation features as needed in a modular fashion, ensuring the integrity of each stage. Below is a fully fleshed-out explanation.


---

Stage 1: Basic Inventory Tracking Setup (Google Sheets + Google Forms)

Overview:

The first stage focuses on setting up a basic inventory tracking system where you can manually input products (e.g., sealed products, individual cards, accessories) with core information and track the quantities and costs. This will provide you with a simple structure to start recording sales and inventory, ensuring it’s easy to use even for a nine-year-old.

Key Features in Stage 1:

Google Forms for Inventory Entry:

You’ll be able to input basic data for all product categories like:

Product Category (e.g., Individual Cards, Sealed Product, Accessories)

Product Name (A description of the product)

Quantity (The amount you have in stock)

Cost per Unit (How much the product costs you)

Total Cost (Auto-calculated based on quantity and cost per unit)

Selling Price per Unit

Potential Revenue (Auto-calculated based on quantity and selling price per unit)

Additional Notes for tracking specific details like product condition, editions, etc.



Google Sheets Backend:

Formulas:

Use formulas in the Google Sheet to calculate:

Total Cost (Quantity x Cost per Unit)

Potential Revenue (Quantity x Selling Price per Unit)

Basic validation: Prevent negative values or empty fields for Quantity and Cost.


Profit Formula: Profit can be calculated (Potential Revenue - Total Cost), but this feature is fully elaborated in later stages.



Categories in Stage 1:

Product Category Options: Ensure that "Sealed Product," "Individual Card," "Accessories" are the available product categories.

Accessories Option: Added for tracking items like card sleeves, top loaders, etc.




---

Stage 2: Add Basic Profit Calculation

Overview:

Once the basic tracking is functional, Stage 2 will add the ability to calculate profit. This includes deducting Whatnot fees, basic shipping material costs, and other costs like top loaders or envelopes.

Key Features in Stage 2:

Profit Tracking:

Add formulas to Google Sheets to automatically calculate profit:

Profit = (Selling Price x Quantity) - (Cost per Unit x Quantity) - (Whatnot Fees) - (Shipping Materials Cost).



Shipping Material Costs:

Create a list of shipping materials with associated costs, e.g.:

Plain white envelope: $0.12

Top loader: $0.11

Sticker cost: $0.25

Bubble mailers: $0.24 - $0.13


These will be subtracted from the revenue when calculating profit, but will need to be manually entered at this stage.


Whatnot Fees Calculation:

Based on what you’ve mentioned, Whatnot typically charges:

8% commission + a 2.9% payment processing fee + $0.30 flat fee per transaction.

Create a formula in Google Sheets to automatically calculate Whatnot fees:

Whatnot Fee = (Selling Price x 8%) + (Selling Price x 2.9%) + $0.30






---

Stage 3: Automated Pull Box Generation

Overview:

Stage 3 will allow you to automate the generation of pull boxes. This is critical for tracking the various elements that make up a pull box, such as cards, sealed packs, and high-value items.

Key Features in Stage 3:

Custom Pull Box Setup:

Allow input parameters such as:

Number of Cards in the pull box.

Types of items included: Cards, Sealed Packs, Accessories, etc.

Number of high-value cards, filler cards, etc.


Once input, the system will generate a pull box with randomized results and calculate the potential value of the pull box based on the items selected.




---

Stage 4: Semi-Automated Inventory Updates via Manabox/Monobox

Overview:

Stage 4 integrates card data from Manabox/Monobox. This will enable you to scan cards with your phone, have the app pull the card data (e.g., name, set, rarity), and export it into your inventory system.

Key Features in Stage 4:

Monobox Export Integration:

Use Manabox to take card pictures and extract relevant information (e.g., card name, set, pricing).

Export this information into a CSV file.

Create an import system where the exported data from Monobox can be uploaded into your Google Sheet and mapped into the corresponding fields (Product Name, Quantity, Cost per Unit, etc.).


Image Pulling from TCGPlayer:

Automate the process to pull images of the cards from TCGPlayer based on the product name and set.




---

Stage 5: Validation and Error Checking Automation

Overview:

Stage 5 focuses on adding error-checking and data validation to prevent invalid data from breaking the system or causing inaccuracies in profit calculations.

Key Features in Stage 5:

Negative Value Prevention: Ensure that fields like Quantity and Cost cannot be negative.

Field Validation: Ensure all required fields (e.g., product name, selling price) are filled out before allowing submission.

Duplicate Prevention: Implement a check to prevent duplicate entries of the same product unless manually overridden.



---

Stage 6: Automation via Selenium

Overview:

Once the inventory system is fully functional, you want to automate the process of uploading products to Whatnot. This stage introduces automation via Selenium to streamline product listings.

Key Features in Stage 6:

Selenium Web Automation:

Use Selenium to automate the process of inputting product information (Product Name, Selling Price, Quantity, etc.) from the Google Sheet to Whatnot’s product listing page.

The bot will simulate the manual entry of product details into the Whatnot web interface, saving you the time of having to do it manually.




---

Stage 7: Full Automation for Inventory Management and Profit Calculation

Overview:

Stage 7 focuses on achieving full automation where inventory is seamlessly managed, profits are tracked in real-time, and products are listed automatically on Whatnot.

Key Features in Stage 7:

Real-Time Inventory Sync:

If possible, establish a sync between Google Sheets and Whatnot via automation tools to ensure that inventory is automatically updated in both systems when a product is sold.


Advanced Profit Calculation:

Implement advanced formulas that calculate:

Shipping Variability: Based on historical data, estimate the shipping costs for each order and incorporate this into the profit formula.

Dynamic Cost Tracking: Automatically update cost prices as market fluctuations occur (e.g., if you reorder a product at a different price).





---

Conclusion:

By following this modular approach, you can start small with a simple inventory tracking system and progressively add more complex features, from profit tracking to full automation with Whatnot. Each stage adds valuable functionality, while ensuring that the system remains user-friendly and can be used by anyone, even a child, as requested.

This step-by-step approach ensures no need to start over—just build on each stage as your business needs grow.

[2024-09-26 14:01:35] FoSGamers:
Understood! I’ll walk through the process of refining the Whatnot fee calculations based on the standard shipping scenarios you provided earlier and the detailed Whatnot fee structure.

Shipping Scenarios Based on Your Business:

1. Single card shipped in a plain white envelope:

Packing material: Top loader ($0.11), Envelope ($0.12), Sticker ($0.25).

Estimated cost: $0.48.

Shipping cost: Likely between $0.80 to $1.50 depending on weight.



2. Packs of cards shipped in a bubble mailer:

Packing material: Bubble mailer ($0.24), plastic bag ($0.05), tape, penny sleeves (as needed), and sticker ($0.25).

Estimated cost: $0.54 to $1.00 (depending on quantity).

Shipping cost: Likely between $5.00 to $8.00.



3. Bulk items or larger orders shipped in a USPS priority box:

Packing material: Reused box (low cost), plastic bag ($0.05), bubble wrap or padding (minimal cost), sticker ($0.25).

Estimated cost: Around $0.30 to $0.50.

Shipping cost: $7.00 to $8.00.




Updated Whatnot Fee Calculation:

1. Commission: Whatnot takes 8% of the sale price of the item.


2. Payment Processing: 2.9% of the total transaction amount plus a $0.30 flat fee.


3. Shipping Fees: Paid by the buyer for regular sales; paid by you for giveaways or promotions.



Updated Example Using Provided Information:

Let’s walk through an example where you sell a single card for $5.00, with the buyer paying $1.00 in shipping. You’ll be responsible for packing costs, but not shipping in this case.

Breakdown:

1. Sale Price: $5.00


2. Buyer-Paid Shipping: $1.00


3. Whatnot Commission (8% of $5.00): $0.40


4. Processing Fee (2.9% of $6.00 + $0.30): $0.47


5. Packing Materials: $0.48 (Top loader + Envelope + Sticker)



Total Whatnot Fees: $0.40 + $0.47 = $0.87

Net Profit: 

Larger Sale Example:

Let’s say you sell a sealed pack for $25, with the buyer paying $5.00 in shipping.

1. Sale Price: $25.00


2. Buyer-Paid Shipping: $5.00


3. Whatnot Commission (8% of $25.00): $2.00


4. Processing Fee (2.9% of $30.00 + $0.30): $1.17


5. Packing Materials: $0.54 (Bubble mailer + Sticker + Penny sleeves)



Total Whatnot Fees: $2.00 + $1.17 = $3.17

Net Profit: 

Final Adjustments:

1. Include the shipping costs as needed for giveaways or paid by you.


2. Modify the formulas to subtract costs in each respective field when entering items with different shipping scenarios.



Formula Adjustment (Google Sheets):

1. Commission Fee:

= Sale_Price * 0.08


2. Processing Fee:

= (Sale_Price + Shipping_Paid) * 0.029 + 0.30


3. Total Whatnot Fees:

= Commission_Fee + Processing_Fee


4. Packing Material Costs:

= Bubble_Mailer + Top_Loader + Sticker + Envelope


5. Net Profit:

= Sale_Price – (Whatnot_Fees + Packing_Costs)



Final Output in Google Sheets:

This setup now considers both Whatnot fees and your shipping scenarios as you've described them.

If you need any further clarification or additional adjustments, feel free to ask!

- **Buyer-Paid Shipping:** $1.00
- **Whatnot Commission (8%):** $0.40
- **Processing Fee (2.9% of $6.00 + $0.30):** $0.47
- **Total Whatnot Fees:** $0.40 + $0.47 = $0.87
- **Packing Materials:** $0.48
- **Profit Calculation:**
  - `=5.00 - (0.87 + 0.48) = 3.65`

**Sealed Pack Sale Example:**

- **Sale Price:** $25.00
- **Buyer-Paid Shipping:** $5.00
- **Whatnot Commission (8%):** $2.00
- **Processing Fee (2.9% of $30.00 + $0.30):** $1.17
- **Total Whatnot Fees:** $2.00 + $1.17 = $3.17
- **Packing Materials:** $0.54
- **Profit Calculation:**
  - `=25.00 - (3.17 + 0.54) = 21.29`

Make sure importing from MANA box is correct and explained so that it's detailed enough a child, a nine-year-old child, can do this and they would have no confusion on what to do. Now, sometimes if people order things, multiple items together, they'll pay for, you know, like if they order, like, an item, a ship, I'd say they order in one show, like maybe, you know, 10 packs of cards or something like that, that'll all probably be under the one thing where it would be a, you know, a reused box or something like that. Or if they use one where it's, you know, six packs of cards, I might be doing it in the padded envelope in one pack of card, definitely, you know, I mean, like it depends on how many things they're ordering. That is a little bit of a different information there. I don't know if that helps or is that a problem or if that's something you would do a little later into kind of generating your information here for your thing, for your formulas.

### **d. Example Scenarios Integration**

Let's walk through examples to ensure our formulas work correctly.

#### **Example 1: Single Card Sale**

- **Sale Price:** $5.00
- **Buyer-Paid Shipping:** $1.00
- **Shipping Scenario:** Single Item (Envelope)
  
**Breakdown:**

1. **Whatnot Commission (8%):**  
   `=5.00 * 0.08 = $0.40`
   
2. **Processing Fee (2.9% of $6.00 + $0.30):**  
   `=(5.00 + 1.00)*0.029 + 0.30 = 0.47`
   
3. **Total Whatnot Fees:**  
   `=0.40 + 0.47 = $0.87`
   
4. **Packing Materials Cost:**  
   `=Envelope (0.12) + Top Loader (0.11) + Sticker (0.25) = $0.48`
   
5. **Total Cost:**  
   `=Cost per Unit + Whatnot Fee + VLOOKUP(Shipping Material) + Packing Cost`  
   `=2.00 + 0.40 + 0.48 + 0.48 = $3.36`
   
6. **Revenue Potential:**  
   `=5.00 * 10 = $50.00`
   
7. **Profit:**  
   `=(5.00 - 2.00 - 0.87 - 0.48) * 10 = $15.00`

#### **Example 2: Sealed Pack Sale**

- **Sale Price:** $25.00
- **Buyer-Paid Shipping:** $5.00
- **Shipping Scenario:** Multiple Items (Bubble Mailer)
  
**Breakdown:**

1. **Whatnot Commission (8%):**  
   `=25.00 * 0.08 = $2.00`
   
2. **Processing Fee (2.9% of $30.00 + $0.30):**  
   `=(25.00 + 5.00)*0.029 + 0.30 = $1.17`
   
3. **Total Whatnot Fees:**  
   `=2.00 + 1.17 = $3.17`
   
4. **Packing Materials Cost:**  
   `=Bubble Mailer (0.24) + Plastic Bag (0.05) + Penny Sleeves (0.10) + Sticker (0.25) = $0.64`

### **e. Example Scenarios Integration**

Let's walk through examples to ensure our formulas work correctly.

#### **Example 1: Single Card Sale**

- **Sale Price:** $5.00
- **Buyer-Paid Shipping:** $1.00
- **Shipping Scenario:** Single Item (Envelope)
- **Quantity:** 10

**Breakdown:**

1. **Whatnot Commission (8%):**  
   `=5.00 * 0.08 = $0.40`
   
2. **Processing Fee (2.9% of $6.00 + $0.30):**  
   `=(5.00 + 1.00)*0.029 + 0.30 = $0.47`
   
3. **Total Whatnot Fees:**  
   `=0.40 + 0.47 = $0.87`
   
4. **Packing Materials Cost:**  
   `=Envelope (0.12) + Top Loader (0.11) + Sticker (0.25) = $0.48`
   
5. **Total Cost:**  
   `=Cost per Unit + Whatnot Fee + VLOOKUP(Shipping Material) + Packing Cost`  
   `=2.00 + 0.40 + 0.12 + 0.48 = $2.00 + $0.40 + $0.12 + $0.48 = $3.00`
   
6. **Revenue Potential:**  
   `=5.00 * 10 = $50.00`
   
7. **Profit:**  
   `=(5.00 - 2.00 - 0.87 - 0.48) * 10 = $1.65 * 10 = $16.50`

#### **Example 2: Sealed Pack Sale**

- **Sale Price:** $25.00
- **Buyer-Paid Shipping:** $5.00
- **Shipping Scenario:** Multiple Items (Bubble Mailer)
- **Quantity:** 4

**Breakdown:**

1. **Whatnot Commission (8%):**  
   `=25.00 * 0.08 = $2.00`
   
2. **Processing Fee (2.9% of $30.00 + $0.30):**  
   `=(25.00 + 5.00)*0.029 + 0.30 = $1.17`
   
3. **Total Whatnot Fees:**  
   `=2.00 + 1.17 = $3.17`
   
4. **Packing Materials Cost:**  
   `=Bubble Mailer (0.24) + Plastic Bag (0.05) + Penny Sleeves (0.10) + Sticker (0.25) = $0.64`
   
5. **Total Cost:**  
   `=Cost per Unit + Whatnot Fee + VLOOKUP(Shipping Material) + Packing Cost`  
   `=15.00 + 2.00 + 0.24 + 0.64 = $17.88`
   
6. **Revenue Potential:**  
   `=25.00 * 4 = $100.00`
   
7. **Profit:**  
   `=(25.00 - 15.00 - 3.17 - 0.64) * 4 = $21.19 * 4 = $84.76`

Read everything you have so far, along with everything I've updated, and make sure you have all the data ready. Things are fully integrated, right? And if things need to be reordered so they're smarter and easier to follow, do that. And remember, it's supposed to be modular and easily done in steps so that it can be used immediately after each step is done. That way, things can be started and built up to be adjusted as things go. You need to explain how those things can be adjusted without there being a problem, and why there wouldn't be a problem. Like if you needed to add a new field into a form or something like that, how adding that in wouldn't break anything, etc., all that stuff. It needs to be so much done that no one would have any questions on it, even including a nine-year-old child.

Product name should be for set. The product would be Magic, Sorcery, or whatever it is. Then the set name would be the mic. So you'd first be saying if it's a card, a sealed item, or what. Then once you have that, you'd say, first you would say, first thing you would do is select what type of thing it is. Is it magic? Like what trading card game it's from. Let's do that. Trading card game it is. That type of thing. After you have selected if it's a card, a sealed product, or an accessory, or a pull box, then you would select the trading card game it's from. Then you would enter the product name, which would be whatever it is. If it's a card pack, whatever happens to be. And then just go from there. So please make sure that's done right.

Analyze this chat all the way to the beginning. Thoroughly understand what we've been doing in it. Then analyze it again and be 100% clear you know what we're doing in here. Then confirm 100% positively you know exactly what we're doing in here in this chat. Then generate stage one of this, allowing to make sure it's done everything correctly that I've wanted it to be. Don't be lazy. Do it right. And generate stage one. Well, actually, first generate the FOSGamers card system, the table of contents, then stage one. Then once that is completed, I will ask you to generate stage two. But don't do anything until I tell you to. And so on and so forth until we get through all of the stages in the FOSGamers card system.

### **4. Integrate Shipping Costs into Calculations**

Now, we'll ensure that **shipping material costs** are accurately calculated based on the **shipping scenario** and the **number of items** in an order.

#### **a. Update Google Form to Include Shipping Scenario**

Ensure that the **Google Form** includes the **Shipping Scenario** field (done in Stage 1).

#### **b. Update Google Sheet to Capture Shipping Scenario**

After submitting the form, the **Google Sheet** should now include the **Shipping Scenario** data in column **N**.

#### **c. Calculate Shipping Material Costs Based on Scenario**

1. **Add a New Column for Packing Cost (Column U):**
   - **Header:** Packing Cost
   - **Formula in U2:**

     ```plaintext
     =ARRAYFORMULA(
       IF(N2:N="", "",
         IF(N2:N="Single Item (Envelope)", 
           VLOOKUP("Envelope", ShippingCosts!A:B, 2, FALSE) + 
           VLOOKUP("Top Loader", ShippingCosts!A:B, 2, FALSE) + 
           VLOOKUP("Sticker", ShippingCosts!A:B, 2, FALSE),
         IF(N2:N="Multiple Items (Bubble Mailer)",
           VLOOKUP("Bubble Mailer", ShippingCosts!A:B, 2, FALSE) + 
           VLOOKUP("Plastic Bag", ShippingCosts!A:B, 2, FALSE) + 
           VLOOKUP("Penny Sleeves", ShippingCosts!A:B, 2, FALSE) + 
           VLOOKUP("Sticker", ShippingCosts!A:B, 2, FALSE),
         IF(N2:N="Bulk Items (USPS Priority Box)",
           VLOOKUP("Reused Box", ShippingCosts!A:B, 2, FALSE) + 
           VLOOKUP("Plastic Bag", ShippingCosts!A:B, 2, FALSE) + 
           VLOOKUP("Bubble Wrap/Padding", ShippingCosts!A:B, 2, FALSE) + 
           VLOOKUP("Sticker", ShippingCosts!A:B, 2, FALSE),
           0)))))
     )
     ```

   - **How to Enter the Formula:**
     1. Click on cell **U2**.
     2. Enter the above formula and press **Enter**.
     3. The formula will automatically apply to all relevant rows.

   - **Explanation:**
     - The formula checks the **Shipping Scenario** and calculates the **Packing Cost** by summing the costs of the necessary shipping materials from the **"ShippingCosts"** sheet.

2. **Update Total Cost and Profit Formulas to Include Packing Cost**

   - **Total Cost (Column R):**
     - **Updated Formula:**
       
       ```plaintext
       =ARRAYFORMULA(IF(F2:F="", "", (I2:I * F2:F) + U2:U + Q2:Q))
       ```
     
     - **How to Update:**
       1. Click on cell **R2**.
       2. Replace the existing formula with the updated formula.
       3. Press **Enter**.
       4. The ArrayFormula will automatically apply to all relevant rows.

   - **Profit (Column T):**
     - **Updated Formula:**
       
       ```plaintext
       =ARRAYFORMULA(IF(F2:F="", "", (J2:J * F2:F) - (I2:I * F2:F) - S2:S - U2:U))
       ```
     
     - **How to Update:**
       1. Click on cell **T2**.
       2. Replace the existing formula with the updated formula.
       3. Press **Enter**.
       4. The ArrayFormula will automatically apply to all relevant rows.

   - **Explanation:**
     - **Total Cost (R):** Now includes the **Packing Cost (U)** along with the previous calculations.
     - **Profit (T):** Subtracts the **Total Cost (R)** and **Packing Cost (U)** from the **Revenue Potential (S)** to calculate the profit.

2. **Processing Fee (R3):**  
   `=(25.00 + 5.00)*0.029 + 0.30 = 0.87 + 0.30 = $1.17`

3. **Total Whatnot Fees (S3):**  
   `=2.00 + 1.17 = $3.17`

4. **Packing Cost (U3):**  
   `=Bubble Mailer (0.24) + Plastic Bag (0.05) + Penny Sleeves (0.10) + Sticker (0.25) = $0.64`

5. **Total Cost (R3):**  
   `=(15.00 * 4) + 0.64 + 3.17 = $60.00 + $0.64 + $3.17 = $63.81`

6. **Revenue Potential (S3):**  
   `=25.00 * 4 = $100.00`

7. **Profit (T3):**  
   `=100.00 - 63.81 = $36.19`

[2024-09-26 15:17:42] FoSGamers:
No, it's not a single item shipped in a plain white envelope. Single items aren't. Like, it's only single cards are that way. There are... Anything else would be shipped in a bubble mailer, whether it's an individual pack or to six packs, and then once you get to bigger items, it ends up being some type of box.

**Mapping out the hierarchy**

I'm organizing shipping categories for the FoSGamers C.A.R.D.S. System. Single cards go in plain envelopes, small items ship in bubble mailers, and larger ones need boxes.

**Correction clarification**

The user needs Stage 2 of shipping scenarios corrected to align single cards in envelopes, packs or multiple packs in bubble mailers, and larger items in boxes, following the clarified definitions.

Ensuring accuracy

**Clarifying shipping methods**

OK, let me see. The user’s shipping method list now includes bubble mailers and boxes, addressing items ranging from single to larger packages.

REVISING SHIPPING SCENARIOS:

I learned that single cards go in envelopes, while other items ship in bubble mailers or boxes. Adjusting the shipping scenarios accordingly.

**Clarifying product details**

I’m noting the need to select the product type, specify the trading card game, and accurately input the product name and set name to ensure correctness.

**Ensuring accurate definitions**

I’m redoing Stage 1 to ensure shipping scenarios are accurately defined. This involves adjusting the Google Form to reflect correct product categories and selection steps, ensuring single cards, multiple packs, and larger items are properly categorized.

**Revamping sections**

I’m tweaking the FoSGamers C.A.R.D.S. System, focusing on updating the Table of Contents and Stage 1. Ensuring accuracy in product categorization and shipping methods is key.

2. **Processing Fee (R3):**  
   `=(25.00 + 5.00)*0.029 + 0.30 = 0.87 + 0.30 = $1.17`

3. **Total Whatnot Fees (S3):**  
   `=2.00 + 1.17 = $3.17`

4. **Packing Cost (U3):**  
   `=Bubble Mailer (0.24) + Plastic Bag (0.05) + Penny Sleeves (0.10) + Sticker (0.25) = $0.64`

5. **Total Cost (R3):**  
   `=(15.00 * 4) + 0.64 + 3.17 = $60.00 + $0.64 + $3.17 = $63.81`

6. **Revenue Potential (S3):**  
   `=25.00 * 4 = $100.00`

#### **b. Parameters to Define:**

1. **Box Size:** Determines the number of items in the pull box.
   - **Small Box:** 5 items
   - **Medium Box:** 10 items
   - **Large Box:** 20 items

2. **Product Composition:** The types of products included in the box.
   - **Individual Cards**
   - **Sealed Packs**
   - **Accessories**

3. **Rarity Distribution:** Ensures a mix of common, uncommon, and rare items.
   - **Common Items:** 60%
   - **Uncommon Items:** 30%
   - **Rare Items:** 10%

4. **Total Value Range:** Defines the minimum and maximum total value of the pull box.
   - **Small Box:** $50 - $100
   - **Medium Box:** $100 - $200
   - **Large Box:** $200 - $400

5. **Customization Rules:** Any specific rules for bundling products.
   - **No duplicate rare cards**
   - **At least one accessory per box**

#### **c. Example Pull Box Parameters:**

| **Box Size** | **Number of Items** | **Common (%)** | **Uncommon (%)** | **Rare (%)** | **Value Range** |
|--------------|---------------------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------|
| Small        | 5                   | 60% (3)        | 30% (2)           | 10% (0.5)    | $50 - $100       |
| Medium       | 10                  | 60% (6)        | 30% (3)           | 10% (1)      | $100 - $200      |
| Large        | 20                  | 60% (12)       | 30% (6)           | 10% (2)      | $200 - $400      |

**Note:** Percentages are approximate and will be adjusted to fit whole numbers.

---

### **2. Update Google Form for Pull Boxes**

To ensure that the **Pull Box fields** appear only when necessary, we'll use **conditional logic**.

1. **Set Up Conditional Logic for Pull Box Size and Notes:**
   - Click on the **three dots (⋮)** at the bottom right of the **"Is this a Pull Box?"** question.
   - Select **“Go to section based on answer”**.
   - **Configure Paths:**
     - **If "Yes" is selected:** Go to **"Pull Box Creation"** section.
     - **If "No" is selected:** Continue to the next section or submit the form.

#### **c. Finalize Form Updates**

1. **Review the Form:**
   - Ensure that the **Pull Box Creation** section appears only when **"Yes"** is selected for **"Is this a Pull Box?"**.

2. **Make Fields Required:**
   - Ensure that **"Is this a Pull Box?"** and **"Pull Box Size"** are marked as **“Required”**.

#### **d. Example Form Flow:**

  - **Is this a Pull Box?** [Yes/No]
  - If **Yes:**
    - **Pull Box Size:** [Small/Medium/Large]
    - **Notes for Pull Box:** [Optional]
  - If **No:**
    - Continue or Submit

---

### **3. Create Pull Boxes in Google Sheets**

With the **Google Form** updated, we can now set up **Google Sheets** to automatically generate pull boxes based on the entries. This involves creating formulas to select random products, ensure rarity distribution, and calculate total value.

#### **a. Set Up the "PullBoxes" Sheet**

1. **Create a New Sheet:**
   - At the bottom of your **"FoSGamers Inventory Data"** Google Sheet, click the **"+"** button to add a new sheet.
   - **Rename the Sheet:** Right-click the new tab and select **“Rename”**. Name it **"PullBoxes"**.

2. **Define Columns for Pull Boxes:**

   | **A**          | **B**             | **C**                | **D**        | **E**           | **F**      | **G**          | **H**            | **I**          | **J**             | **K**                    | **L**                | **M**          | **N**              | **O**        | **P**              | **Q**           | **R**          | **S**              | **T**      | **U**          | **V**             |
   |----------------|-------------------|----------------------|--------------|-----------------|------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|--------------------|--------------|--------------------|-----------------|----------------|--------------------|------------|----------------|-------------------|
   | PullBox ID     | Box Size          | Product Category     | Trading Card Game | Set Name     | Product Name | Quantity       | Reorder Level    | Reorder Quantity | Cost per Unit       | Selling Price per Unit  | Shipping Material Cost | Buyer-Paid Shipping | Number of Items   | Shipping Scenario | Date Added         | Expiration Date | Notes           | Whatnot Fees      | Total Cost | Revenue Potential | Profit            |
   
   **Note:** You can adjust the columns as needed based on your system's requirements.

#### **b. Generate Unique PullBox IDs**

1. **PullBox ID (Column A):**
   - **Purpose:** Assign a unique identifier to each pull box for easy tracking.
   - **Formula in A2:**  
     ```plaintext
     =IF(B2="", "", "PB-" & ROW()-1)
     ```
   - **How to Enter:**
     1. Click on cell **A2**.
     2. Enter the formula: `=IF(B2="", "", "PB-" & ROW()-1)`
     3. Press **Enter**.
     4. Drag the fill handle downward to apply the formula to other rows.

#### **c. Define Pull Box Creation Logic**

To automate the creation of pull boxes with randomized contents based on predefined parameters, we'll use a combination of formulas and helper columns.

1. **Helper Columns Setup:**

   - **Total Items in Box (Column B):**
     - **Formula in B2:**  
       ```plaintext
       =IF(A2="", "", IF(B2="Small Box", 5, IF(B2="Medium Box", 10, IF(B2="Large Box", 20, 0))))
       ```
     - **How to Enter:**
       1. Click on cell **B2**.
       2. Enter the formula.
       3. Press **Enter**.
       4. Drag the fill handle downward.

   - **Random Selection of Products:**

     To select random products based on the defined parameters (Box Size, Rarity Distribution), we'll use the following approach:

     - **Filter Available Products:** Select products that are available in inventory and meet the criteria.
     - **Assign Random Numbers:** Use the `RAND()` function to assign a random number to each eligible product.
     - **Sort and Select:** Sort the products based on the random number and select the top N products to include in the pull box.

2. **Implementing Random Selection:**

   Google Sheets does not support dynamic arrays in a straightforward manner, but with the use of helper columns and formulas, we can approximate this behavior.

   - **Create a Helper Column for Eligibility (Column W):**

     - **Header:** Eligible for PullBox
     - **Formula in W2:**  
       ```plaintext
       =IF(AND(E2>=0, I2>=0), TRUE, FALSE)
       ```
     - **Explanation:** This checks if the product has a valid quantity and cost.
     - **How to Enter:**
       1. Click on cell **W2**.
       2. Enter the formula.
       3. Press **Enter**.
       4. Drag the fill handle downward.

   - **Assign Random Numbers to Eligible Products (Column X):**

     - **Header:** Random Number
     - **Formula in X2:**  
       ```plaintext
       =IF(W2, RAND(), "")
       ```
     - **How to Enter:**
       1. Click on cell **X2**.
       2. Enter the formula.
       3. Press **Enter**.
       4. Drag the fill handle downward.

   - **Sort Products by Random Number:**

     Since Google Sheets does not support dynamic sorting within formulas, we'll use a separate sheet or use scripting for more advanced sorting. However, for simplicity, we'll manually sort the eligible products when creating pull boxes.

3. **Automate Selection Based on Rarity Distribution:**

   To ensure that each pull box contains a mix of common, uncommon, and rare items based on the defined distribution, we'll need to categorize products by rarity.

   - **Add Rarity Column to Inventory Sheet:**

     Ensure that each product in your **"FoSGamers Inventory Data"** sheet includes a **Rarity** field (e.g., Common, Uncommon, Rare).

     - **How to Add:**
       1. Open **"FoSGamers Inventory Data"** sheet.
       2. Insert a new column titled **"Rarity"**.
       3. Assign rarity levels to each product.

   - **Update PullBoxes Sheet with Rarity-Based Selection:**

     Implement formulas to select products based on their rarity. This can be complex with pure formulas, so for simplicity, we'll outline a basic approach:

     1. **Define Number of Items per Rarity:**

        - **Small Box (5 items):**
          - Common: 3
          - Uncommon: 2
          - Rare: 0

        - **Medium Box (10 items):**
          - Common: 6
          - Uncommon: 3
          - Rare: 1

        - **Large Box (20 items):**
          - Common: 12
          - Uncommon: 6
          - Rare: 2

     2. **Use FILTER and SORT Functions:**

        - **Select Common Items:**
          ```plaintext
          =FILTER('FoSGamers Inventory Data'!E2:E, 'FoSGamers Inventory Data'!R2:R="Common", 'FoSGamers Inventory Data'!F2:F>=1)
          ```
        - **Select Uncommon Items:**
          ```plaintext
          =FILTER('FoSGamers Inventory Data'!E2:E, 'FoSGamers Inventory Data'!R2:R="Uncommon", 'FoSGamers Inventory Data'!F2:F>=1)
          ```
        - **Select Rare Items:**
          ```plaintext
          =FILTER('FoSGamers Inventory Data'!E2:E, 'FoSGamers Inventory Data'!R2:R="Rare", 'FoSGamers Inventory Data'!F2:F>=1)
          ```

        - **Randomize Selection:**
          ```plaintext
          =SORT(FILTER('FoSGamers Inventory Data'!E2:E, 'FoSGamers Inventory Data'!R2:R="Common", 'FoSGamers Inventory Data'!F2:F>=1), RANDARRAY(COUNTA(FILTER('FoSGamers Inventory Data'!E2:E, 'FoSGamers Inventory Data'!R2:R="Common", 'FoSGamers Inventory Data'!F2:F>=1))), TRUE)
          ```

        - **Limit the Number of Items:**
          Use the `INDEX` function to limit the selection based on box size.

          ```plaintext
          =INDEX(SORT(FILTER('FoSGamers Inventory Data'!E2:E, 'FoSGamers Inventory Data'!R2:R="Common", 'FoSGamers Inventory Data'!F2:F>=1), RANDARRAY(COUNTA(FILTER('FoSGamers Inventory Data'!E2:E, 'FoSGamers Inventory Data'!R2:R="Common", 'FoSGamers Inventory Data'!F2:F>=1))), TRUE)), 1, 1)
          ```

     **Note:** Implementing this entirely with formulas can be cumbersome. For a more streamlined process, consider using **Google Apps Script** to automate the selection based on rarity and box size. However, for simplicity, we'll proceed with a formula-based approach.

4. **Populate Pull Box Contents:**

   - **Manual Process:**
     1. **Determine Box Size:**
        - Based on the **Pull Box Size** selected in the form, determine the number of items per rarity.
     2. **Select Products:**
        - Use the above formulas to filter and sort products by rarity.
        - Select the top N products for each rarity category.
     3. **List Products in PullBoxes Sheet:**
        - Enter the selected products into the **"PullBoxes"** sheet under their respective columns.
     4. **Calculate Total Value:**
        - Sum the **Selling Price per Unit** of all items in the pull box.

   - **Automated Process (Advanced):**
     - Implement **Google Apps Script** to automate the selection and population of pull box contents based on the defined parameters. This requires basic scripting knowledge and is optional for advanced users.

#### **d. Calculate Total Value and Profit for Pull Boxes**

1. **Total Value (Column V):**
   - **Purpose:** Calculate the total selling price of all items in the pull box.
   - **Formula in V2:**
     ```plaintext
     =IF(A2="", "", SUM(J2:J6))
     ```
     **Note:** Adjust the range (J2:J6) based on the number of items in the pull box.

2. **Profit Calculation:**
   - **Total Cost (Column T):**
     - **Formula in T2:**
       ```plaintext
       =IF(A2="", "", SUM(R2:R6))
       ```
       **Note:** Sum all relevant costs, including product cost, shipping material cost, and Whatnot fees.

   - **Profit (Column U):**
     - **Formula in U2:**
       ```plaintext
       =IF(A2="", "", V2 - T2)
       ```

3. **Automate Formulas with ArrayFormulas:**
   - To apply formulas automatically to new pull boxes, use **ArrayFormulas**.

   - **Total Value (V2):**
     ```plaintext
     =ARRAYFORMULA(IF(A2:A="", "", MMULT((J2:J)*1, TRANSPOSE(COLUMN(J2:J)))))
     ```

   - **Total Cost (T2):**
     ```plaintext
     =ARRAYFORMULA(IF(A2:A="", "", MMULT((R2:R)*1, TRANSPOSE(COLUMN(R2:R)))))
     ```

   - **Profit (U2):**
     ```plaintext
     =ARRAYFORMULA(IF(A2:A="", "", V2:V - T2:T))
     ```

   **Note:** Adjust the formulas based on your sheet's layout and the number of items per pull box.

#### **e. Example Pull Box Creation**

Let's walk through an example to ensure our pull box generation works correctly.

##### **Example 1: Small Box**

- **PullBox ID:** PB-1
- **Box Size:** Small Box (5 items)
- **Contents:**
  - 3 Common Items
    - "Common Card A" - $2.00 each
    - "Common Card B" - $2.00 each
    - "Common Card C" - $2.00 each
  - 2 Uncommon Items
    - "Uncommon Card A" - $5.00 each
    - "Uncommon Card B" - $5.00 each
- **Shipping Scenario:** Single Card (Envelope)
- **Packing Cost:** $0.48
- **Whatnot Fees:** $0.87
- **Total Cost:**
  - Product Cost: (3 * $2.00) + (2 * $5.00) = $6.00 + $10.00 = $16.00
  - Shipping Material Cost: $0.48
  - Whatnot Fees: $0.87
  - **Total Cost:** $16.00 + $0.48 + $0.87 = $17.35
- **Revenue Potential:** (3 * $2.00) + (2 * $5.00) = $6.00 + $10.00 = $16.00
- **Profit:** $16.00 - $17.35 = -$1.35

**Note:** The example shows a loss, indicating that pricing or cost adjustments may be necessary. Ensure that selling prices cover all costs to maintain profitability.

##### **Example 2: Medium Box**

- **PullBox ID:** PB-2
- **Box Size:** Medium Box (10 items)
- **Contents:**
  - 6 Common Items
    - "Common Card A" - $2.00 each
    - "Common Card B" - $2.00 each
    - "Common Card C" - $2.00 each
    - "Common Card D" - $2.00 each
    - "Common Card E" - $2.00 each
    - "Common Card F" - $2.00 each
  - 3 Uncommon Items
    - "Uncommon Card A" - $5.00 each
    - "Uncommon Card B" - $5.00 each
    - "Uncommon Card C" - $5.00 each
  - 1 Rare Item
    - "Rare Card A" - $10.00 each
- **Shipping Scenario:** Multiple Packs (Bubble Mailer)
- **Packing Cost:** $0.64
- **Whatnot Fees:** $3.17
- **Total Cost:**
  - Product Cost: (6 * $2.00) + (3 * $5.00) + (1 * $10.00) = $12.00 + $15.00 + $10.00 = $37.00
  - Shipping Material Cost: $0.64
  - Whatnot Fees: $3.17
  - **Total Cost:** $37.00 + $0.64 + $3.17 = $40.81
- **Revenue Potential:** (6 * $2.00) + (3 * $5.00) + (1 * $10.00) = $12.00 + $15.00 + $10.00 = $37.00
- **Profit:** $37.00 - $40.81 = -$3.81

**Note:** Again, this example shows a loss. Review pricing strategies to ensure profitability.

#### **f. Validation Measures**

To ensure that pull box generation maintains data integrity and follows the defined parameters, implement the following validation measures:

1. **Protected Columns:**

   Below is a **basic script** to automate pull box creation based on form submissions.

   ```javascript
   function onFormSubmit(e) {
     const sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName('PullBoxes');
     const inventorySheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName('FoSGamers Inventory Data');
     
     // Get the latest form submission
     const responses = e.values;
     const isPullBox = responses[17]; // Adjust index based on form setup
     
     if (isPullBox.toLowerCase() !== 'yes') return;
     
     const boxSize = responses[18]; // Adjust index based on form setup
     
     // Define number of items per rarity
     let rarityDistribution;
     switch(boxSize) {
       case 'Small Box':
         rarityDistribution = { 'Common': 3, 'Uncommon': 2, 'Rare': 0 };
         break;
       case 'Medium Box':
         rarityDistribution = { 'Common': 6, 'Uncommon': 3, 'Rare': 1 };
         break;
       case 'Large Box':
         rarityDistribution = { 'Common': 12, 'Uncommon': 6, 'Rare': 2 };
         break;
       default:
         rarityDistribution = { 'Common': 0, 'Uncommon': 0, 'Rare': 0 };
     }
     
     // Fetch inventory data
     const inventoryData = inventorySheet.getDataRange().getValues();
     
     // Filter available products by rarity
     let pullBoxContents = [];
     ['Common', 'Uncommon', 'Rare'].forEach(rarity => {
       const required = rarityDistribution[rarity];
       if (required > 0) {
         const eligibleProducts = inventoryData.filter(row => row[/* Rarity Column Index */] === rarity && row[/* Quantity Column Index */] >=1);
         // Shuffle eligible products
         shuffleArray(eligibleProducts);
         // Select required number of products
         for (let i = 0; i < required && i < eligibleProducts.length; i++) {
           pullBoxContents.push(eligibleProducts[i]);
           // Update inventory quantity
           let productRow = inventoryData.indexOf(eligibleProducts[i]) + 1;
           let currentQty = inventorySheet.getRange(productRow, /* Quantity Column */).getValue();
           inventorySheet.getRange(productRow, /* Quantity Column */).setValue(currentQty - 1);
         }
       }
     });
     
     // Populate PullBoxes sheet
     const newRow = [
       "PB-" + (sheet.getLastRow()),
       boxSize,
       ...pullBoxContents.map(item => item[/* Product Category Column */]),
       // Continue mapping other necessary fields
     ];
     
     sheet.appendRow(newRow);
   }
   
   // Utility function to shuffle an array
   function shuffleArray(array) {
     for (let i = array.length -1; i > 0; i--){
       const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i +1));
       [array[i], array[j]] = [array[j], array[i]];
     }
   }
   ```

   **Note:**  
   - Replace the placeholder comments (e.g., `/* Rarity Column Index */`) with the actual column indices based on your sheet's layout.
   - Ensure that the script correctly maps form responses to sheet columns.
   - Test the script thoroughly to prevent accidental data loss.

4. **Set Up Triggers:**

   - **Trigger the Script on Form Submission:**
     1. In the Apps Script editor, click on the **clock icon** (Triggers) on the left sidebar.
     2. Click **“Add Trigger”**.

        - **Choose which function to run:** `onFormSubmit`
        - **Select event source:** From spreadsheet
        - **Select event type:** On form submit
     4. Click **“Save”**.
     5. Authorize the script when prompted.

5. **Testing the Script:**

   - **Submit a Test Pull Box Entry via Google Form:**
     - Fill out the form with **"Is this a Pull Box?"** set to **"Yes"** and choose a **Pull Box Size**.
   - **Check the "PullBoxes" Sheet:**
     - Ensure that a new pull box is created with the correct number of items and that inventory levels are updated accordingly.

#### **f. Benefits of Using Google Apps Script:**

- **Automation:** Eliminates manual steps in pull box creation.
- **Accuracy:** Ensures adherence to predefined parameters.
- **Efficiency:** Saves time by automating repetitive tasks.
- **Scalability:** Easily adjust parameters and logic as your inventory grows.

I should be able to enter the number of cards or items in the pull box, because it could be a mystery box or a pull box. It doesn't matter, because they are built rather similarly. And I should be able to give you the amount of things in it for the size, so it shouldn't be a dropdown on that. And you should be able to use it to calculate it that way. And pull boxes should be able to have all cards of value that people might want. Or it could be a mix of cards and packs. Or it could be packs that are in there. Now, the way pull boxes are made are based on me taking a certain amount of cards. They could be of $0.01 value to who knows, a couple hundred dollars or more value. It depends on what I want to put in there. But generally, when they aren't doing much and they're going to have only, say, if it's going to be one that's all packs that are on there and sealed products, then all the cards that are going to be in there are just going to be junk bulk cards that are $0.01 to $0.10, maybe $0.50 at the most. And I might throw in a few cards that are worth some money, if I ask you to, based on the parameters. Sometimes I'll build one just based on cards only. And I'll add in a couple of packs for it to spice up the pull box. And at that point, I'll tell you to select a certain amount of, I'll tell you how many cards I want to have in the pull box. I'll tell you how many cards of monetary value within a certain price range type thing. Or I might go and select certain cards. Or maybe I want to say, I want 10 cards of $1 to $5. I want five cards of $5 to $10. I want one card that is a $60 card or something like that. I'll be able to select how many things, parameters, and set it up however I want. It shouldn't be restricted. I should be able to build it however I need it to be. And you should do that for me that way. So let's work on that update then.

## **Stage 3: Automated Pull Box Generation**

**Objective:**  
Introduce an **Automated Pull Box Generation** feature that allows you to create **pull boxes** or **mystery boxes** with **customized parameters**, including the number of items, value ranges, and product types. This feature will help in bundling products, managing inventory efficiently, and calculating the total value and profitability of each pull box automatically.

---

### **1. Define Pull Box Parameters**

Before automating pull box creation, it's essential to **define the parameters** that determine the contents and value of each pull box. This ensures consistency and accuracy in the generation process.

#### **a. What is a Pull Box?**

A **Pull Box** (or **Mystery Box**) is a bundle of products (cards, packs, accessories) packaged together to be sold as a single unit. Pull boxes can offer variety to customers and help in moving inventory more efficiently.

#### **b. Parameters to Define:**

1. **Box Type:** Determines whether it's a **Pull Box** or **Mystery Box**.
2. **Number of Items:** Total number of items (cards or packs) in the box.
3. **Product Composition:** Types of products included in the box.
   - **Individual Cards**
   - **Sealed Packs**
   - **Accessories**
4. **Value Ranges:** Specifies how many items fall within certain monetary value brackets.
   - **Example:**
     - 10 cards of $1 - $5
     - 5 cards of $5 - $10
     - 1 card of $60
5. **Customization Rules:** Any specific rules for bundling products.
   - **No duplicate rare cards**

| Customization Rules | Specific rules for product inclusion                | No duplicate rare cards, include at least one accessory |

---

### **2. Update Google Form for Pull Boxes**

To facilitate the creation of pull boxes with customized parameters, we'll update the **Google Form** to include options for defining these parameters. This allows users to specify when they want to create a pull box or mystery box and define its contents precisely.

#### **a. Add a New Section for Pull Boxes**

1. **Open Your Google Form:**
   - Navigate to your **"FoSGamers Inventory Entry"** Google Form.

2. **Add a Section Break:**
   - Click the **“Add section”** button (two vertical lines icon) to create a new section.
   - **Name the Section:** "Pull Box Creation"

3. **Add Pull Box Fields:**
   - In the new section, add the following fields:

     1. **Is this a Pull Box or Mystery Box?** (Multiple Choice)
        - **Options:**
          - Pull Box
          - Mystery Box
          - Neither
        - **Required:** Yes

     2. **Number of Items** (Number) *(Visible only if "Pull Box" or "Mystery Box" is selected)*
        - **Validation:** Must be a **number greater than or equal to 1**
        - **Required:** Yes

     3. **Define Value Ranges** (Paragraph Text) *(Visible only if "Pull Box" or "Mystery Box" is selected)*
        - **Description:** Specify the number of items and their value ranges in the following format:
          - **Example:**
            - 10 cards of $1-$5
            - 5 cards of $5-$10
            - 1 card of $60

     4. **Product Types Included** (Checkboxes) *(Visible only if "Pull Box" or "Mystery Box" is selected)*
        - **Options:**
          - Individual Cards
          - Sealed Packs
          - Accessories
        - **Required:** Yes

     5. **Customization Rules** (Paragraph Text) *(Optional)*
        - **Description:** Specify any rules for product inclusion.
        - **Example:** "No duplicate rare cards", "Include at least one accessory"

#### **b. Set Up Conditional Logic**

To ensure that the **Pull Box fields** appear only when necessary, we'll use **conditional logic**.

1. **Set Up Conditional Logic for Box Type:**
   - Click on the **three dots (⋮)** at the bottom right of the **"Is this a Pull Box or Mystery Box?"** question.
   - Select **“Go to section based on answer”**.
   - **Configure Paths:**
     - **If "Pull Box" or "Mystery Box" is selected:** Go to **"Pull Box Creation"** section.
     - **If "Neither" is selected:** Continue to the next section or submit the form.

#### **c. Finalize Form Updates**

1. **Review the Form:**
   - Ensure that the **Pull Box Creation** section appears only when **"Pull Box"** or **"Mystery Box"** is selected.

2. **Make Fields Required:**
   - Ensure that **"Is this a Pull Box or Mystery Box?"**, **"Number of Items"**, **"Define Value Ranges"**, and **"Product Types Included"** are marked as **“Required”** when applicable.

#### **d. Example Form Flow:**

- **Section 1:** Product Entry
  - All existing product fields.
- **Section 2:** Pull Box Creation
  - **Is this a Pull Box or Mystery Box?** [Pull Box/Mystery Box/Neither]
  - If **Pull Box** or **Mystery Box**:
    - **Number of Items:** [Number]
    - **Define Value Ranges:** [Paragraph Text]
    - **Product Types Included:** [Checkboxes]
    - **Customization Rules:** [Paragraph Text]
  - If **Neither**:
    - Continue or Submit

---

### **3. Create Pull Boxes in Google Sheets**

With the **Google Form** updated, we can now set up **Google Sheets** to automatically generate pull boxes based on the entries. This involves creating a separate sheet to handle pull box parameters, selecting products based on defined criteria, and calculating the total value and profit.

#### **a. Set Up the "PullBoxes" Sheet**

1. **Create a New Sheet:**
   - At the bottom of your **"FoSGamers Inventory Data"** Google Sheet, click the **"+"** button to add a new sheet.
   - **Rename the Sheet:** Right-click the new tab and select **“Rename”**. Name it **"PullBoxes"**.

2. **Define Columns for Pull Boxes:**

   | **A**          | **B**           | **C**                | **D**             | **E**              | **F**                 | **G**                 | **H**                  | **I**               | **J**             | **K**                    | **L**                | **M**          | **N**              | **O**        | **P**              | **Q**           | **R**          | **S**              | **T**      | **U**          | **V**             |
   |----------------|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|--------------------|--------------|--------------------|-----------------|----------------|--------------------|------------|----------------|-------------------|
   | PullBox ID     | Box Type        | Number of Items      | Product Types     | Value Ranges       | Customization Rules    | Selected Products     | Total Value            | Total Cost          | Revenue Potential | Profit                  | Notes                | Date Created   |                        |              |                    |                 |                |                    |            |                |                   |

   **Note:** Adjust columns based on your specific needs. The above is a suggested layout.

#### **b. Generate Unique PullBox IDs**

1. **PullBox ID (Column A):**
   - **Purpose:** Assign a unique identifier to each pull box for easy tracking.
   - **Formula in A2:**  
     ```plaintext
     =IF(B2="", "", "PB-" & TEXT(ROW()-1, "000"))
     ```
   - **How to Enter:**
     1. Click on cell **A2**.
     2. Enter the formula: `=IF(B2="", "", "PB-" & TEXT(ROW()-1, "000"))`
     3. Press **Enter**.
     4. Drag the fill handle (small square at the bottom-right corner of A2) **downward** to apply the formula to other rows.

   **Result:**  
   - **A2:** PB-001
   - **A3:** PB-002
   - And so on.

#### **c. Define Pull Box Creation Logic**

To automate the creation of pull boxes with customized parameters, we'll use a combination of **Google Apps Script** and **Google Sheets formulas**. Given the complexity of selecting items based on multiple value ranges and product types, **Google Apps Script** is the most efficient method.

#### **d. Implement Google Apps Script for Automation**

**Note:** This step involves writing a script to automate the selection of products based on user-defined parameters. If you're unfamiliar with scripting, follow the instructions carefully or seek assistance.

##### **i. Introduction to Google Apps Script**

**Google Apps Script** is a powerful tool that allows you to automate tasks in Google Sheets, Forms, and other Google Workspace applications using JavaScript-based code.

##### **ii. Setting Up Google Apps Script**

1. **Open Apps Script Editor:**
   - In your **"FoSGamers Inventory Data"** Google Sheet, click on **“Extensions”** > **“Apps Script”**.

2. **Create a New Script:**
   - Click on **“New project”**.
   - Name your project, e.g., **"PullBoxGenerator"**.

##### **iii. Write the Script**

Below is a **basic script** to automate pull box creation based on form submissions. This script will:

1. Detect form submissions that are pull boxes or mystery boxes.
2. Parse the defined value ranges.
3. Select products from the inventory based on product types and value ranges.
4. Populate the "PullBoxes" sheet with selected products.
5. Update inventory quantities accordingly.

**Important:** Customize the column indices in the script based on your actual sheet layout.

```javascript
function onFormSubmit(e) {
  const response = e.values; // Array of form responses
  const timestamp = response[0];
  const productCategory = response[1];
  const tradingCardGame = response[2];
  const setName = response[3];
  const productName = response[4];
  const quantity = response[5];

  const reorderQuantity = response[7];
  const costPerUnit = response[8];
  const sellingPricePerUnit = response[9];
  const shippingMaterialCost = response[10];
  const buyerPaidShipping = response[11];
  const numberOfItems = response[12];
  const shippingScenario = response[13];
  const dateAdded = response[14];
  const expirationDate = response[15];
  const notes = response[16];
  
  // Pull Box Fields (Assuming they start from index 17)
  const isPullBox = response[17].toLowerCase(); // "pull box", "mystery box", "neither"
  
  if (isPullBox === 'neither') {
    return; // Exit if not a pull box
  }
  
  const boxType = isPullBox === 'pull box' ? 'Pull Box' : 'Mystery Box';
  const totalItems = parseInt(response[18]);
  const valueRangesRaw = response[19];
  const productTypesIncluded = response[20].split(',').map(item => item.trim().toLowerCase()); // e.g., ["individual cards", "sealed packs"]
  const customizationRules = response[21]; // Optional
  
  // Parse Value Ranges
  // Expected format:
  // 10 cards of $1-$5
  // 5 cards of $5-$10
  // 1 card of $60
  let valueRanges = [];
  const lines = valueRangesRaw.split('\n');
  lines.forEach(line => {
    const regex = /(\d+)\s+(cards|packs)\s+of\s+\$?([\d.]+)-\$?([\d.]+)/i;
    const singleValueRegex = /(\d+)\s+(cards|packs)\s+of\s+\$?([\d.]+)/i;
    let match = line.match(regex);
    if (match) {
      valueRanges.push({
        count: parseInt(match[1]),
        type: match[2].toLowerCase(),
        min: parseFloat(match[3]),
        max: parseFloat(match[4])
      });
    } else {
      match = line.match(singleValueRegex);
      if (match) {
        valueRanges.push({
          count: parseInt(match[1]),
          type: match[2].toLowerCase(),
          min: parseFloat(match[3]),
          max: parseFloat(match[3])
        });
      }
    }
  });
  
  // Access Sheets
  const ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  const inventorySheet = ss.getSheetByName('FoSGamers Inventory Data');
  const pullBoxesSheet = ss.getSheetByName('PullBoxes');
  
  // Fetch Inventory Data
  const inventoryData = inventorySheet.getDataRange().getValues();
  const headers = inventoryData.shift(); // Remove headers

  });
  
  // Function to select products based on criteria
  function selectProducts(type, min, max, count) {
    // Filter based on type, value range, and availability
    let eligible = inventoryMap.filter(item => {
      let typeMatch = false;
      if (type === 'cards') {
        typeMatch = (item.productCategory === 'individual card');
      } else if (type === 'packs') {
        typeMatch = (item.productCategory === 'sealed pack');
      } else {
        typeMatch = false;
      }
      let value = item.sellingPricePerUnit;
      let valueMatch = (value >= min && value <= max);
      let availability = (item.quantity > 0);
      return typeMatch && valueMatch && availability;
    });
    
    // Shuffle eligible products
    eligible = shuffleArray(eligible);
    
    // Select required number
    return eligible.slice(0, count);
  }
  
  // Utility function to shuffle an array
  function shuffleArray(array) {
    for (let i = array.length -1; i > 0; i--){
      const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i +1));
      [array[i], array[j]] = [array[j], array[i]];
    }
    return array;
  }
  
  // Select Products Based on Value Ranges
  let selectedProducts = [];
  valueRanges.forEach(range => {
    const selected = selectProducts(range.type, range.min, range.max, range.count);
    selectedProducts = selectedProducts.concat(selected);
  });
  
  // Check if enough products were selected
  const totalSelected = selectedProducts.length;
  if (totalSelected < totalItems) {
    // Optionally, select additional common items to fill the box
    const remaining = totalItems - totalSelected;
    const additional = selectProducts('cards', 0, 1000, remaining); // Adjust min and max as needed
    selectedProducts = selectedProducts.concat(additional);
  }
  
  // Update Inventory Quantities
  selectedProducts.forEach(product => {
    const index = inventoryMap.findIndex(item => item.productName === product.productName);
    if (index !== -1) {
      const currentQty = inventorySheet.getRange(index + 2, 6).getValue(); // Column F: Quantity
      inventorySheet.getRange(index + 2, 6).setValue(currentQty - 1);
    }
  });
  
  // Calculate Total Value and Total Cost
  let totalValue = 0;
  let totalCost = 0;
  selectedProducts.forEach(product => {
    totalValue += product.sellingPricePerUnit;
    totalCost += product.costPerUnit + product.shippingMaterialCost + (product.sellingPricePerUnit * 0.08) + ((product.sellingPricePerUnit + product.buyerPaidShipping) * 0.029) + 0.30;
  });

  // Prepare Selected Products String
  let selectedProductsStr = selectedProducts.map(p => p.productName).join(', ');
  
  // Append to PullBoxes Sheet
  pullBoxesSheet.appendRow([
    "", // PullBox ID will be auto-generated
    boxType,
    totalItems,
    selectedProductsStr,
    valueRangesRaw,
    customizationRules,
    totalValue,
    totalCost,
    profit,
    notes,
    timestamp
  ]);
}
```

**Important Notes:**

- **Rarity Column:** Ensure that your **"FoSGamers Inventory Data"** sheet includes a **"Rarity"** column (e.g., Common, Uncommon, Rare) for each product. This script assumes it's the 18th column (index 17). Adjust the index based on your actual sheet layout.

- **Adjust Column Indices:** Modify the column indices in the script to match your sheet's structure. For example, if "Rarity" is in column **R**, adjust the `item.rarity` assignment accordingly.

- **Error Handling:** The script does basic checks but does not handle all possible errors. Consider adding more robust error handling as needed.

##### **iv. Set Up Triggers**

1. **Trigger the Script on Form Submission:**
   - In the Apps Script editor, click on the **clock icon** (Triggers) on the left sidebar.
   - Click **“Add Trigger”**.
   - **Configure the Trigger:**
     - **Choose which function to run:** `onFormSubmit`
     - **Select event source:** From spreadsheet
     - **Select event type:** On form submit
   - Click **“Save”**.
   - **Authorize the Script:** You'll be prompted to authorize the script to access your Google Sheets. Follow the on-screen instructions to grant the necessary permissions.

##### **v. Testing the Script**

1. **Submit a Test Pull Box Entry via Google Form:**
   - Fill out the form with **"Is this a Pull Box or Mystery Box?"** set to **"Pull Box"** or **"Mystery Box"**.
   - Define the **Number of Items**, **Value Ranges**, **Product Types Included**, and any **Customization Rules**.
   - **Example:**
     - **Is this a Pull Box or Mystery Box?** Pull Box
     - **Number of Items:** 16
     - **Define Value Ranges:**
       ```
       10 cards of $1-$5
       5 cards of $5-$10
       1 card of $60

- **Profit:** $20.00
- **Notes:** "Includes exclusive stickers"

**Breakdown:**

1. **Whatnot Commission:**
   - Total Selling Price: $100.00
   - Commission: 8% of $100.00 = $8.00

2. **Processing Fee:**
   - Total Transaction: $100.00 (selling price) + $5.00 (buyer-paid shipping) = $105.00
   - Processing Fee: 2.9% of $105.00 + $0.30 = $3.05 + $0.30 = $3.35

3. **Total Whatnot Fees:**
   - $8.00 (Commission) + $3.35 (Processing) = $11.35

4. **Packing Cost:**
   - Based on shipping scenario: Single Pack (Bubble Mailer) = $0.64

5. **Total Cost:**
   - Product Cost: $80.00
   - Shipping Material Cost: $0.64
   - Whatnot Fees: $11.35
   - **Total Cost:** $80.00 + $0.64 + $11.35 = $91.99

6. **Revenue Potential:**
   - Total Selling Price: $100.00

7. **Profit:**
   - $100.00 (Revenue) - $91.99 (Total Cost) = $8.01

**Note:**  
Ensure that your pricing strategy accounts for all costs to maintain profitability. Adjust selling prices or optimize costs as needed.

[2024-09-26 15:37:14] FoSGamers:
Here’s an enhanced and detailed explanation of Pull Boxes, Mystery Boxes, and Card Breaks within the trading card game (TCG) market on Whatnot, combined with some additional aspects from our discussions and specific practices you're involved in.


---

1. Pull Boxes and Mystery Boxes Overview

Pull Boxes: These consist of a random assortment of cards or other collectibles. Each buyer purchases a "pull," and the seller draws a card or item from the box. The key appeal is the chance of receiving a high-value card, although most pulls are likely to be lower-value items.


Example:

You set up a Pull Box with 100 items:

10 cards worth $50 each (e.g., rare Magic: The Gathering mythics or Pokémon holo rares).

90 cards worth $1 to $5 each.


Buyers pay $10 per pull, and the cards are drawn live on Whatnot, with all pulls kept on camera for transparency. Some buyers may pull a valuable card, while others receive lower-value cards.


Best Practice: Clearly state the floor, ceiling, and average values in your listing. For instance, “Each pull has a floor value of $1, a ceiling of $50, and an average pull value of $8.” This ensures transparency and meets Whatnot’s requirements.


---

2. Whatnot’s Terms of Service for Pull Boxes and Mystery Boxes

Whatnot has strict rules governing how these products should be run to ensure fair play and transparency.

Accurate Market Value Representation: Sellers must provide the floor, ceiling, and average value of the items. Over-inflating the value of items is prohibited, and sellers can be suspended or banned if they are found misleading buyers.

Example:

You offer a mystery box with a floor value of $30 and a ceiling value of $200, with an average value of $65. Every box contains at least one card, booster pack, or collectible item with a value of $30 or more. This must be clearly stated in your listing.


Full Visibility: In live sales, such as card pulls or box breaks, every action must be visible on camera. Cards or boxes cannot be taken off-screen. This ensures transparency for buyers who are relying on the randomness of the process.

Distribution: Every buyer in a Pull Box or Mystery Box event must receive something. No one should walk away empty-handed, even if they don’t pull a high-value card.



---

3. Card Breaks on Whatnot

A Card Break is where multiple buyers purchase spots, and the seller opens a sealed product (such as a booster box) live, distributing the contents according to the break rules (e.g., by team, color, or player).

Example (Color Team Break):

You host a Magic: The Gathering booster box break with 36 packs. Buyers can purchase a color (red, green, blue, etc.) for $25 each.

After the box is opened, you send all cards of the buyer’s selected color to them.



Transparency: The entire break must be visible on-screen from start to finish, and all rules should be clearly stated upfront. For example, you might include in the listing, “This is a team break; all red cards from the box will be sent to buyers who select the red team. Bulk commons won’t be sent unless requested”.

Buyer Protections: If a buyer feels that the break wasn’t conducted fairly or a card was hidden off-camera, they can report the issue to Whatnot for a possible refund.


---

4. Community Sentiment and Best Practices for Selling

Sellers who consistently offer transparent, fair, and well-managed Pull Boxes and Mystery Boxes can build strong reputations. However, buyer concerns about overpricing and fairness often come up on platforms like Reddit and card-collecting forums.

Example of Overpricing:

A seller offers mystery boxes for $50 each but fills most boxes with cards worth only $10, while only a few contain items worth $100. While technically allowed, buyers may feel misled if the floor value isn’t clearly communicated.


To avoid this, always clearly state the odds of pulling a high-value card, and ensure that even lower-value pulls provide some satisfaction.


Best Practices:

Start Small: When first starting, it’s best to sell a limited number of boxes or pulls to build your reputation. Offering clear value and transparency will help you gain positive feedback.

Fair Distribution: If you are running a card break, ensure that every buyer receives something, even if their chosen team or color doesn’t have many cards pulled. For example, if someone chooses "blue" in a break but only a few blue cards appear, you should still send them a card from the break to meet Whatnot’s requirement of distributing at least one item per buyer.



---

5. Examples of Pull Boxes and Mystery Boxes You Could Run

FoSGamers Pull Box Example:

You could offer a Pull Box with 50 pulls at $15 each, containing:

5 cards worth $100 each (e.g., limited-edition Commander cards or rare foils).

20 cards worth $25 to $40.

25 cards worth $10 to $15.



Transparency: Your listing would state, “Pull Box with a floor value of $10, a ceiling of $100, and an average pull value of $30.”

Biggest Loser Break:

Another example could be running a Biggest Loser Break, where the buyer with the lowest-value pull wins a bonus prize (e.g., a collector’s booster pack). This would need to be clearly explained upfront, such as, “The participant with the lowest total card value at the end of the break wins a sealed collector’s booster pack as a bonus”.




---

6. Conclusion

By following Whatnot’s rules and offering fair, transparent sales, you can build a strong reputation and attract repeat buyers. Whether selling Pull Boxes, Mystery Boxes, or running card breaks, clarity in listings, fair odds, and full visibility are essential.

For Sellers: Always describe your product thoroughly, provide accurate values, and keep all actions visible on camera during live streams. Start small and ensure positive feedback through fair pricing and good communication.

For Buyers: Do your research before participating, read the product descriptions carefully, and understand the odds. If something seems unclear or too good to be true, it’s wise to proceed with caution.


This explanation, with examples and real scenarios, ensures that anyone reading will fully understand how Pull Boxes, Mystery Boxes, and Card Breaks work on Whatnot, along with the necessary steps for compliance and success.

     ```
   - **How to Enter:**
     1. Click on cell **A2**.
     2. Enter the formula: `=IF(B2="", "", "PB-" & TEXT(ROW()-1, "000"))`
     3. Press **Enter**.
     4. Drag the fill handle (small square at the bottom-right corner of A2) **downward** to apply the formula to other rows.

   **Result:**  
   - **A2:** PB-001
   - **A3:** PB-002
   - And so on.

#### **c. Define Pull Box Creation Logic**

To automate the creation of pull boxes with customized parameters, we'll use a combination of **Google Apps Script** and **Google Sheets formulas**. Given the complexity of selecting items based on multiple value ranges and product types, **Google Apps Script** is the most efficient method.

#### **d. Implement Google Apps Script for Automation**

**Note:** This step involves writing a script to automate the selection of products based on user-defined parameters. If you're unfamiliar with scripting, follow the instructions carefully or seek assistance.

##### **i. Introduction to Google Apps Script**

**Google Apps Script** is a powerful tool that allows you to automate tasks in Google Sheets, Forms, and other Google Workspace applications using JavaScript-based code.

##### **ii. Setting Up Google Apps Script**

1. **Open Apps Script Editor:**
   - In your **"FoSGamers Inventory Data"** Google Sheet, click on **“Extensions”** > **“Apps Script”**.

2. **Create a New Script:**
   - Click on **“New project”**.
   - Name your project, e.g., **"PullBoxGenerator"**.

##### **iii. Write the Script**

Below is a **basic script** to automate pull box creation based on form submissions. This script will:

1. Detect form submissions that are pull boxes or mystery boxes.
2. Parse the defined value ranges.
3. Select products from the inventory based on product types and value ranges.
4. Populate the "PullBoxes" sheet with selected products.
5. Update inventory quantities accordingly.

**Important:** Customize the column indices in the script based on your actual sheet layout.

```javascript
function onFormSubmit(e) {
  const response = e.values; // Array of form responses

  // Adjust indices based on your form and sheet structure
  // Assuming the following order:
  // [0] Timestamp
  // [1] Product Category
  // [2] Trading Card Game
  // [3] Set Name
  // [4] Product Name
  // [5] Quantity
  // [6] Reorder Level
  // [7] Reorder Quantity
  // [8] Cost per Unit
  // [9] Selling Price per Unit
  // [10] Shipping Material Cost
  // [11] Buyer-Paid Shipping
  // [12] Number of Items
  // [13] Shipping Scenario
  // [14] Date Added
  // [15] Expiration Date
  // [16] Notes
  // [17] Is this a Pull Box or Mystery Box?
  // [18] Number of Items (for Pull/Mystery Box)
  // [19] Define Value Ranges
  // [20] Product Types Included
  // [21] Customization Rules

  const isPullBox = response[17].toLowerCase(); // "pull box", "mystery box", "neither"

  if (isPullBox === 'neither') {
    return; // Exit if not a pull box
  }

  const boxType = isPullBox === 'pull box' ? 'Pull Box' : 'Mystery Box';
  const totalItems = parseInt(response[18]);
  const valueRangesRaw = response[19];
  const productTypesIncluded = response[20].split(',').map(item => item.trim().toLowerCase()); // e.g., ["individual cards", "sealed packs"]
  const customizationRules = response[21]; // Optional

  // Parse Value Ranges
  // Expected format:
  // 10 cards of $1-$5
  // 5 packs of $5-$10
  // 1 card of $60
  let valueRanges = [];
  const lines = valueRangesRaw.split('\n');
  lines.forEach(line => {
    const regex = /(\d+)\s+(cards|packs)\s+of\s+\$?([\d.]+)-\$?([\d.]+)/i;
    const singleValueRegex = /(\d+)\s+(cards|packs)\s+of\s+\$?([\d.]+)/i;
    let match = line.match(regex);
    if (match) {
      valueRanges.push({
        count: parseInt(match[1]),
        type: match[2].toLowerCase(),
        min: parseFloat(match[3]),
        max: parseFloat(match[4])
      });
    } else {
      match = line.match(singleValueRegex);
      if (match) {
        valueRanges.push({
          count: parseInt(match[1]),
          type: match[2].toLowerCase(),
          min: parseFloat(match[3]),
          max: parseFloat(match[3])
        });
      }
    }
  });

  // Access Sheets
  const ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  const inventorySheet = ss.getSheetByName('FoSGamers Inventory Data');
  const pullBoxesSheet = ss.getSheetByName('PullBoxes');

  // Fetch Inventory Data
  const inventoryData = inventorySheet.getDataRange().getValues();
  const headers = inventoryData.shift(); // Remove headers

  // Create a map for inventory with indexes
  const inventoryMap = inventoryData.map(row => {
    return {
      timestamp: row[0],
      productCategory: row[1].toLowerCase(),
      tradingCardGame: row[2].toLowerCase(),
      setName: row[3].toLowerCase(),
      productName: row[4].toLowerCase(),
      quantity: parseInt(row[5]),
      reorderLevel: parseInt(row[6]),
      reorderQuantity: parseInt(row[7]),
      costPerUnit: parseFloat(row[8]),
      sellingPricePerUnit: parseFloat(row[9]),
      shippingMaterialCost: parseFloat(row[10]),
      buyerPaidShipping: parseFloat(row[11]),
      numberOfItems: parseInt(row[12]),
      shippingScenario: row[13].toLowerCase(),
      dateAdded: row[14],
      expirationDate: row[15],
      notes: row[16],
      rarity: row[17] ? row[17].toLowerCase() : 'common' // Assuming you have a "Rarity" column
    };
  });

  // Function to select products based on criteria
  function selectProducts(type, min, max, count) {
    // Filter based on type, value range, and availability
    let eligible = inventoryMap.filter(item => {
      let typeMatch = false;
      if (type === 'cards') {
        typeMatch = (item.productCategory === 'individual card');
      } else if (type === 'packs') {
        typeMatch = (item.productCategory === 'sealed pack');
      } else {
        typeMatch = false;
      }
      let value = item.sellingPricePerUnit;
      let valueMatch = (value >= min && value <= max);
      let availability = (item.quantity > 0);
      return typeMatch && valueMatch && availability;
    });

    // Shuffle eligible products
    eligible = shuffleArray(eligible);

    // Select required number
    return eligible.slice(0, count);
  }

  // Utility function to shuffle an array
  function shuffleArray(array) {
    for (let i = array.length -1; i > 0; i--){
      const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i +1));
      [array[i], array[j]] = [array[j], array[i]];
    }
    return array;
  }

  // Select Products Based on Value Ranges
  let selectedProducts = [];
  valueRanges.forEach(range => {
    const selected = selectProducts(range.type, range.min, range.max, range.count);
    selectedProducts = selectedProducts.concat(selected);
  });

  // Check if enough products were selected
  const totalSelected = selectedProducts.length;
  if (totalSelected < totalItems) {
    // Optionally, select additional common items to fill the box
    const remaining = totalItems - totalSelected;
    const additional = selectProducts('cards', 0, 1000, remaining); // Adjust min and max as needed
    selectedProducts = selectedProducts.concat(additional);
  }

  // Ensure total selected items match the desired number
  selectedProducts = selectedProducts.slice(0, totalItems);

  // Update Inventory Quantities
  selectedProducts.forEach(product => {
    const index = inventoryMap.findIndex(item => item.productName === product.productName);
    if (index !== -1) {
      const sheetRow = index + 2; // Adjust for header row
      const currentQty = inventorySheet.getRange(sheetRow, 6).getValue(); // Column F: Quantity
      inventorySheet.getRange(sheetRow, 6).setValue(currentQty - 1);
    }
  });

  // Calculate Total Value and Total Cost
  let totalValue = 0;
  let totalCost = 0;
  selectedProducts.forEach(product => {
    totalValue += product.sellingPricePerUnit;
    // Whatnot Fees: 8% commission + 2.9% payment processing + $0.30
    const commission = product.sellingPricePerUnit * 0.08;
    const processing = (product.sellingPricePerUnit + buyerPaidShipping) * 0.029 + 0.30;
    totalCost += product.costPerUnit + product.shippingMaterialCost + commission + processing;
  });

  let profit = totalValue - totalCost;

  // Prepare Selected Products String
  let selectedProductsStr = selectedProducts.map(p => p.productName).join(', ');

  // Append to PullBoxes Sheet
  pullBoxesSheet.appendRow([
    "", // PullBox ID will be auto-generated by formula in Column A
    boxType,
    totalItems,
    productTypesIncluded.join(', '),
    valueRangesRaw,
    customizationRules,
    selectedProductsStr,
    totalValue,
    totalCost,
    profit,
    notes,
    new Date()
  ]);
}
```

**Important Notes:**

- **Rarity Column:** Ensure that your **"FoSGamers Inventory Data"** sheet includes a **"Rarity"** column (e.g., Common, Uncommon, Rare) for each product. This script assumes it's the 18th column (index 17). Adjust the index based on your actual sheet layout.
  
- **Adjust Column Indices:** Modify the column indices in the script to match your sheet's structure. For example, if "Rarity" is in column **R**, adjust the `item.rarity` assignment accordingly.

- **Error Handling:** The script does basic checks but does not handle all possible errors. Consider adding more robust error handling as needed.

- **Customization Rules:** The script currently does not enforce customization rules (e.g., "No duplicate rare cards"). Implement additional logic if necessary.

##### **iv. Set Up Triggers**

1. **Trigger the Script on Form Submission:**
   - In the Apps Script editor, click on the **clock icon** (Triggers) on the left sidebar.
   - Click **“Add Trigger”**.
   - **Configure the Trigger:**
     - **Choose which function to run:** `onFormSubmit`
     - **Select event source:** From spreadsheet
     - **Select event type:** On form submit
   - Click **“Save”**.
   - **Authorize the Script:** You'll be prompted to authorize the script to access your Google Sheets. Follow the on-screen instructions to grant the necessary permissions.

##### **v. Testing the Script**

1. **Submit a Test Pull Box Entry via Google Form:**
   - Fill out the form with **"Is this a Pull Box or Mystery Box?"** set to **"Pull Box"** or **"Mystery Box"**.
   - Define the **Number of Items**, **Value Ranges**, **Product Types Included**, and any **Customization Rules**.
   - **Example:**
     - **Is this a Pull Box or Mystery Box?** Pull Box
     - **Number of Items:** 16
     - **Define Value Ranges:**
       ```
       10 cards of $1-$5
       5 cards of $5-$10
       1 card of $60
       ```
     - **Product Types Included:** Individual Cards, Sealed Packs
     - **Customization Rules:** No duplicate rare cards, Include at least one accessory

2. **Check the "PullBoxes" Sheet:**
   - Ensure that a new pull box is created with the correct number of items and that inventory levels are updated accordingly.
   - Verify that **Total Value**, **Total Cost**, and **Profit** are calculated accurately.

3. **Review Inventory:**
   - Confirm that the quantities of selected products have decreased by the number of times they've been included in pull boxes.

[2024-09-26 15:38:27] FoSGamers:
Make sure I can have a mix of single cards and packs if I want to, because sometimes I will write sealed an item like a pack on a card, on a one-cent card in a poll box, that type of thing.

[2024-09-26 15:39:44] FoSGamers:
**Crafting a flexible system**

I’m thinking through the setup to let pull boxes include both single cards and packs, even low-value packs as single cards, ensuring it adapts to various inventory needs.

Updating instructions and form fields

**Enhancing system flexibility**

I’m piecing together ways to improve flexibility by manually entering the number of items and mixing product types in Google Forms and Sheets. It’s interesting to consider how updates can streamline Apps Script handling.

**Structuring and enhancing**

I’m organizing the 'PullBoxes' sheet, tweaking the Apps Script for single cards and packs, and detailing special cases like sealed packs as low-value cards. This includes clarifying value range handling for each product type.

[2024-09-26 15:39:44] ChatGPT:
Absolutely! Let's further enhance **Stage 3: Automated Pull Box Generation** to incorporate the flexibility you need for mixing single cards and packs within your pull boxes or mystery boxes. This update ensures that you can **customize the composition** of each box precisely, whether you're including individual cards, sealed packs, or a combination of both—even representing packs as single low-value cards.

    - Continue or Submit

---

### **3. Create Pull Boxes in Google Sheets**

With the **Google Form** updated, we can now set up **Google Sheets** to automatically generate pull boxes based on the entries. This involves creating a separate sheet to handle pull box parameters, selecting products based on defined criteria, and calculating the total value and profit.

#### **a. Set Up the "PullBoxes" Sheet**

1. **Create a New Sheet:**
   - At the bottom of your **"FoSGamers Inventory Data"** Google Sheet, click the **"+"** button to add a new sheet.
   - **Rename the Sheet:** Right-click the new tab and select **“Rename”**. Name it **"PullBoxes"**.

2. **Define Columns for Pull Boxes:**

   | **A**          | **B**           | **C**                | **D**             | **E**              | **F**                 | **G**                 | **H**                  | **I**               | **J**             | **K**                    | **L**                | **M**          | **N**              | **O**        | **P**              | **Q**           | **R**          | **S**              | **T**      | **U**          | **V**             |
   |----------------|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|--------------------|--------------|--------------------|-----------------|----------------|--------------------|------------|----------------|-------------------|
   | PullBox ID     | Box Type        | Number of Items      | Product Types     | Value Ranges       | Customization Rules    | Selected Products     | Total Value            | Total Cost          | Revenue Potential | Profit                  | Notes                | Date Created   |                        |              |                    |                 |                |                    |            |                |                   |

   **Note:** Adjust columns based on your specific needs. The above is a suggested layout.

#### **b. Generate Unique PullBox IDs**

1. **PullBox ID (Column A):**
   - **Purpose:** Assign a unique identifier to each pull box for easy tracking.
   - **Formula in A2:**  
     ```plaintext
     =IF(B2="", "", "PB-" & TEXT(ROW()-1, "000"))
     ```
   - **How to Enter:**
     1. Click on cell **A2**.
     2. Enter the formula: `=IF(B2="", "", "PB-" & TEXT(ROW()-1, "000"))`
     3. Press **Enter**.
     4. Drag the fill handle (small square at the bottom-right corner of A2) **downward** to apply the formula to other rows.

   **Result:**  
   - **A2:** PB-001
   - **A3:** PB-002
   - And so on.

#### **c. Define Pull Box Creation Logic**

To automate the creation of pull boxes with customized parameters, we'll use a combination of **Google Apps Script** and **Google Sheets formulas**. Given the complexity of selecting items based on multiple value ranges and product types, **Google Apps Script** is the most efficient method.

#### **d. Implement Google Apps Script for Automation**

**Note:** This step involves writing a script to automate the selection of products based on user-defined parameters. If you're unfamiliar with scripting, follow the instructions carefully or seek assistance.

##### **i. Introduction to Google Apps Script**

**Google Apps Script** is a powerful tool that allows you to automate tasks in Google Sheets, Forms, and other Google Workspace applications using JavaScript-based code.

##### **ii. Setting Up Google Apps Script**

1. **Open Apps Script Editor:**
   - In your **"FoSGamers Inventory Data"** Google Sheet, click on **“Extensions”** > **“Apps Script”**.

2. **Create a New Script:**
   - Click on **“New project”**.
   - Name your project, e.g., **"PullBoxGenerator"**.

##### **iii. Write the Script**

Below is a **comprehensive script** to automate pull box creation based on form submissions. This script will:

1. Detect form submissions that are pull boxes or mystery boxes.
2. Parse the defined value ranges.
3. Select products from the inventory based on product types and value ranges.
4. Populate the "PullBoxes" sheet with selected products.
5. Update inventory quantities accordingly.

**Important:** Customize the column indices in the script based on your actual sheet layout.

```javascript
function onFormSubmit(e) {
  const response = e.values; // Array of form responses

  // Adjust indices based on your form and sheet structure
  // Assuming the following order:
  // [0] Timestamp
  // [1] Product Category
  // [2] Trading Card Game
  // [3] Set Name
  // [4] Product Name
  // [5] Quantity
  // [6] Reorder Level
  // [7] Reorder Quantity
  // [8] Cost per Unit
  // [9] Selling Price per Unit
  // [10] Shipping Material Cost
  // [11] Buyer-Paid Shipping
  // [12] Number of Items
  // [13] Shipping Scenario
  // [14] Date Added
  // [15] Expiration Date
  // [16] Notes
  // [17] Is this a Pull Box or Mystery Box?
  // [18] Number of Items (for Pull/Mystery Box)
  // [19] Define Value Ranges
  // [20] Product Types Included
  // [21] Customization Rules

  const isPullBox = response[17].toLowerCase(); // "pull box", "mystery box", "neither"

  if (isPullBox === 'neither') {
    return; // Exit if not a pull box
  }

  const boxType = isPullBox === 'pull box' ? 'Pull Box' : 'Mystery Box';
  const totalItems = parseInt(response[18]);
  const valueRangesRaw = response[19];
  const productTypesIncluded = response[20].split(',').map(item => item.trim().toLowerCase()); // e.g., ["individual cards", "sealed packs"]
  const customizationRules = response[21]; // Optional

  // Parse Value Ranges
  // Expected format:
  // 10 cards of $1-$5
  // 5 packs of $5-$10
  // 1 card of $60
  let valueRanges = [];
  const lines = valueRangesRaw.split('\n');
  lines.forEach(line => {
    const regex = /(\d+)\s+(cards|packs)\s+of\s+\$?([\d.]+)-\$?([\d.]+)/i;
    const singleValueRegex = /(\d+)\s+(cards|packs)\s+of\s+\$?([\d.]+)/i;
    let match = line.match(regex);
    if (match) {
      valueRanges.push({
        count: parseInt(match[1]),
        type: match[2].toLowerCase(),
        min: parseFloat(match[3]),
        max: parseFloat(match[4])
      });
    } else {
      match = line.match(singleValueRegex);
      if (match) {
        valueRanges.push({
          count: parseInt(match[1]),
          type: match[2].toLowerCase(),
          min: parseFloat(match[3]),
          max: parseFloat(match[3])
        });
      }
    }
  });

  // Access Sheets
  const ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  const inventorySheet = ss.getSheetByName('FoSGamers Inventory Data');
  const pullBoxesSheet = ss.getSheetByName('PullBoxes');

  // Fetch Inventory Data
  const inventoryData = inventorySheet.getDataRange().getValues();
  const headers = inventoryData.shift(); // Remove headers

  // Create a map for inventory with indexes
  const inventoryMap = inventoryData.map((row, index) => {
    return {
      rowIndex: index + 2, // To account for header row
      productCategory: row[1].toLowerCase(),
      tradingCardGame: row[2].toLowerCase(),
      setName: row[3].toLowerCase(),
      productName: row[4].toLowerCase(),
      quantity: parseInt(row[5]),
      reorderLevel: parseInt(row[6]),
      reorderQuantity: parseInt(row[7]),
      costPerUnit: parseFloat(row[8]),
      sellingPricePerUnit: parseFloat(row[9]),
      shippingMaterialCost: parseFloat(row[10]),
      buyerPaidShipping: parseFloat(row[11]),
      numberOfItems: parseInt(row[12]),
      shippingScenario: row[13].toLowerCase(),
      dateAdded: row[14],
      expirationDate: row[15],
      notes: row[16],
      rarity: row[17] ? row[17].toLowerCase() : 'common' // Assuming you have a "Rarity" column
    };
  });

  // Function to select products based on criteria
  function selectProducts(type, min, max, count) {
    // Filter based on type, value range, and availability
    let eligible = inventoryMap.filter(item => {
      let typeMatch = false;
      if (type === 'cards') {
        typeMatch = (item.productCategory === 'individual card');
      } else if (type === 'packs') {
        typeMatch = (item.productCategory === 'sealed pack');
      } else {
        typeMatch = false;
      }
      let value = item.sellingPricePerUnit;
      let valueMatch = (value >= min && value <= max);
      let availability = (item.quantity > 0);
      return typeMatch && valueMatch && availability;
    });

    // Shuffle eligible products
    eligible = shuffleArray(eligible);

    // Select required number
    return eligible.slice(0, count);
  }

  // Utility function to shuffle an array
  function shuffleArray(array) {
    for (let i = array.length - 1; i > 0; i--){
      const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
      [array[i], array[j]] = [array[j], array[i]];
    }
    return array;
  }

  // Select Products Based on Value Ranges
  let selectedProducts = [];
  valueRanges.forEach(range => {
    const selected = selectProducts(range.type, range.min, range.max, range.count);
    selectedProducts = selectedProducts.concat(selected);
  });

  // Check if enough products were selected
  const totalSelected = selectedProducts.length;
  if (totalSelected < totalItems) {
    // Optionally, select additional common items to fill the box
    const remaining = totalItems - totalSelected;
    const additional = selectProducts('cards', 0, 1000, remaining); // Adjust min and max as needed
    selectedProducts = selectedProducts.concat(additional);
  }

  // Ensure total selected items match the desired number
  selectedProducts = selectedProducts.slice(0, totalItems);

  // Update Inventory Quantities
  selectedProducts.forEach(product => {
    const index = inventoryMap.findIndex(item => item.productName === product.productName);
    if (index !== -1) {
      const sheetRow = inventoryMap[index].rowIndex; // Get the actual row in the sheet
      const currentQty = inventorySheet.getRange(sheetRow, 6).getValue(); // Column F: Quantity
      inventorySheet.getRange(sheetRow, 6).setValue(currentQty - 1);
    }
  });

  // Calculate Total Value and Total Cost
  let totalValue = 0;
  let totalCost = 0;
  selectedProducts.forEach(product => {
    totalValue += product.sellingPricePerUnit;
    // Whatnot Fees: 8% commission + 2.9% payment processing + $0.30
    const commission = product.sellingPricePerUnit * 0.08;
    const processing = (product.sellingPricePerUnit + product.buyerPaidShipping) * 0.029 + 0.30;
    totalCost += product.costPerUnit + product.shippingMaterialCost + commission + processing;
  });

  let profit = totalValue - totalCost;

  // Prepare Selected Products String
  let selectedProductsStr = selectedProducts.map(p => p.productName).join(', ');

  // Append to PullBoxes Sheet
  pullBoxesSheet.appendRow([
    "", // PullBox ID will be auto-generated by formula in Column A
    boxType,
    totalItems,
    productTypesIncluded.join(', '),
    valueRangesRaw,
    customizationRules,
    selectedProductsStr,
    totalValue.toFixed(2),
    totalCost.toFixed(2),
    profit.toFixed(2),
    response[16], // Notes
    new Date()
  ]);
}
```

**Important Notes:**

- **Rarity Column:** Ensure that your **"FoSGamers Inventory Data"** sheet includes a **"Rarity"** column (e.g., Common, Uncommon, Rare) for each product. This script assumes it's the 18th column (index 17). Adjust the index based on your actual sheet layout.

- **Adjust Column Indices:** Modify the column indices in the script to match your sheet's structure. For example, if "Rarity" is in column **R**, adjust the `item.rarity` assignment accordingly.

- **Error Handling:** The script does basic checks but does not handle all possible errors. Consider adding more robust error handling as needed.

- **Customization Rules:** The script currently does not enforce customization rules (e.g., "No duplicate rare cards"). Implement additional logic if necessary.

##### **iv. Set Up Triggers**

1. **Trigger the Script on Form Submission:**
   - In the Apps Script editor, click on the **clock icon** (Triggers) on the left sidebar.
   - Click **“Add Trigger”**.
   - **Configure the Trigger:**
     - **Choose which function to run:** `onFormSubmit`
     - **Select event source:** From spreadsheet
     - **Select event type:** On form submit
   - Click **“Save”**.
   - **Authorize the Script:** You'll be prompted to authorize the script to access your Google Sheets. Follow the on-screen instructions to grant the necessary permissions.

##### **v. Testing the Script**

1. **Submit a Test Pull Box Entry via Google Form:**
   - Fill out the form with **"Is this a Pull Box or Mystery Box?"** set to **"Pull Box"** or **"Mystery Box"**.
   - Define the **Number of Items**, **Value Ranges**, **Product Types Included**, and any **Customization Rules**.
   - **Example:**
     - **Is this a Pull Box or Mystery Box?** Pull Box
     - **Number of Items:** 16
     - **Define Value Ranges:**
       ```
       10 cards of $1-$5
       5 cards of $5-$10
       1 card of $60
       ```
     - **Product Types Included:** Individual Cards, Sealed Packs
     - **Customization Rules:** No duplicate rare cards, Include at least one accessory

2. **Check the "PullBoxes" Sheet:**
   - Ensure that a new pull box is created with the correct number of items and that inventory levels are updated accordingly.
   - Verify that **Total Value**, **Total Cost**, and **Profit** are calculated accurately.

3. **Review Inventory:**
   - Confirm that the quantities of selected products have decreased by the number of times they've been included in pull boxes.

       2. Click on **“Format”** > **“Conditional formatting”**.
       3. Set rules based on the expected number of items per rarity.
       4. Choose a **red fill color** for mismatches.
       5. Click **“Done”**.

   - **Validate Total Items:**
     - Ensure that the number of items in each pull box matches the defined box size.
     - **How to Apply:**
       1. Select the **Number of Items** column.
       2. Click on **“Format”** > **“Conditional formatting”**.
       3. Use a **custom formula** to check if the sum of items equals the box size.
       4. Choose a **red fill color** for discrepancies.
       5. Click **“Done”**.

3. **Inventory Check:**
   - **Ensure Sufficient Inventory:**
     - Before creating a pull box, verify that there are enough items in inventory.
     - **How to Apply:**
       - Use **formulas** to compare inventory levels with the required number of items for pull boxes.
       - Highlight rows where inventory is insufficient.

4. **Automated Alerts:**
   - **Set Up Notifications:**
     - Configure Google Sheets to send you an email or pop-up notification when a pull box does not meet the defined parameters or when inventory levels are low.
     - **How to Apply:**
       - Use **Google Apps Script** to set up triggers that send alerts based on specific conditions.

### **7. Example Pull Box Creation**

Let's walk through an example to ensure our pull box generation works correctly.

#### **Example 1: Custom Pull Box**

- **PullBox ID:** PB-001
- **Box Type:** Pull Box
- **Number of Items:** 16
- **Value Ranges:**
  ```
  10 cards of $1-$5
  5 cards of $5-$10
  1 card of $60
  ```
- **Product Types Included:** Individual Cards, Sealed Packs
- **Customization Rules:** No duplicate rare cards, Include at least one accessory
- **Selected Products:** "Common Card A", "Common Card B", "Common Card C", ..., "Rare Card A"
- **Total Value:** $100.00
- **Total Cost:** $80.00
- **Profit:** $20.00
- **Notes:** "Includes exclusive stickers"

**Breakdown:**

1. **Whatnot Commission:**
   - Total Selling Price: $100.00
   - Commission: 8% of $100.00 = $8.00

2. **Processing Fee:**
   - Total Transaction: $100.00 (selling price) + $5.00 (buyer-paid shipping) = $105.00
   - Processing Fee: 2.9% of $105.00 + $0.30 = $3.05 + $0.30 = $3.35

3. **Total Whatnot Fees:**
   - $8.00 (Commission) + $3.35 (Processing) = $11.35

4. **Packing Cost:**
   - Based on shipping scenario: Multiple Packs (Bubble Mailer) = $0.64

5. **Total Cost:**
   - Product Cost: $80.00
   - Shipping Material Cost: $0.64
   - Whatnot Fees: $11.35
   - **Total Cost:** $80.00 + $0.64 + $11.35 = $91.99

6. **Revenue Potential:**
   - Total Selling Price: $100.00

7. **Profit:**
   - $100.00 (Revenue) - $91.99 (Total Cost) = $8.01

**Note:**  
Ensure that your pricing strategy accounts for all costs to maintain profitability. Adjust selling prices or optimize costs as needed.

#### **Example 2: Mystery Box**

- **PullBox ID:** PB-002
- **Box Type:** Mystery Box
- **Number of Items:** 10
- **Value Ranges:**
  ```
  7 cards of $0.50-$2
  2 cards of $5-$10
  1 card of $50
  ```
- **Product Types Included:** Individual Cards
- **Customization Rules:** Include at least one high-value card
- **Selected Products:** "Junk Card A", "Junk Card B", ..., "Rare Card X"
- **Total Value:** $35.00
- **Total Cost:** $25.00
- **Profit:** $10.00
- **Notes:** "Includes a surprise rare card"

**Breakdown:**

1. **Whatnot Commission:**
   - Total Selling Price: $35.00
   - Commission: 8% of $35.00 = $2.80

2. **Processing Fee:**
   - Total Transaction: $35.00 (selling price) + $3.00 (buyer-paid shipping) = $38.00
   - Processing Fee: 2.9% of $38.00 + $0.30 = $1.10 + $0.30 = $1.40

3. **Total Whatnot Fees:**
   - $2.80 (Commission) + $1.40 (Processing) = $4.20

4. **Packing Cost:**
   - Based on shipping scenario: Individual Card (Envelope) = $0.48

5. **Total Cost:**
   - Product Cost: $25.00
   - Shipping Material Cost: $0.48
   - Whatnot Fees: $4.20
   - **Total Cost:** $25.00 + $0.48 + $4.20 = $29.68

---

### **2. Update Google Form for Pull Boxes**

To facilitate the creation of pull boxes with customized parameters, we'll update the **Google Form** to include options for defining these parameters. This allows you to specify when you want to create a pull box or mystery box and define its contents precisely.

#### **a. Add a New Section for Pull Boxes**

1. **Open Your Google Form:**
   - Navigate to your **"FoSGamers Inventory Entry"** Google Form.

2. **Add a Section Break:**
   - Click the **“Add section”** button (two vertical lines icon) to create a new section.
   - **Name the Section:** "Pull Box Creation"

3. **Add Pull Box Fields:**
   - In the new section, add the following fields:

     1. **Is this a Pull Box or Mystery Box?** (Multiple Choice)
        - **Options:**
          - Pull Box
          - Mystery Box
          - Neither
        - **Required:** Yes

     2. **Number of Items** (Number) *(Visible only if "Pull Box" or "Mystery Box" is selected)*
        - **Validation:** Must be a **number greater than or equal to 1**
        - **Required:** Yes

     3. **Define Value Ranges** (Paragraph Text) *(Visible only if "Pull Box" or "Mystery Box" is selected)*
        - **Description:** Specify the number of items and their value ranges in the following format:
          - **Example:**
            ```
            10 cards of $1-$5
            5 packs of $5-$10
            1 card of $60
            ```

     4. **Product Types Included** (Checkboxes) *(Visible only if "Pull Box" or "Mystery Box" is selected)*
        - **Options:**
          - Individual Cards
          - Sealed Packs
          - Accessories
        - **Required:** Yes

     5. **Specific Sets or Games** (Checkboxes or Dropdowns) *(Visible only if "Pull Box" or "Mystery Box" is selected)*
        - **Options:**
          - **List of TCGs:** Magic: The Gathering, Sorcery, etc.
          - **List of Sets:** Innistrad, Zendikar, etc.
          - **Custom Option:** Allow multiple selections or custom input
        - **Required:** Yes

        **Implementation Options:**
        - **Multiple Choice Grid:** Allow selection of both TCGs and specific sets.
        - **Checkboxes:** Separate fields for TCGs and Sets.
        - **Dropdowns with Multiple Selections Enabled:** Allow selecting multiple TCGs or sets.

        **Recommended Approach:**
        - **Two Separate Fields:**
          1. **Select Trading Card Games (TCGs):** (Checkboxes)
             - Options: Magic: The Gathering, Sorcery, etc.
             - **Add "All TCGs" as an option for flexibility**
          2. **Select Specific Sets (Optional):** (Checkboxes or Dropdown)
             - Populate based on selected TCGs using **dependent logic** (advanced)
             - Alternatively, allow manual selection or input

     6. **Customization Rules** (Paragraph Text) *(Optional)*
        - **Description:** Specify any rules for product inclusion.
        - **Example:** "No duplicate rare cards", "Include at least one accessory"

#### **b. Set Up Conditional Logic**

To ensure that the **Pull Box fields** appear only when necessary, we'll use **conditional logic**.

1. **Set Up Conditional Logic for Box Type:**
   - Click on the **three dots (⋮)** at the bottom right of the **"Is this a Pull Box or Mystery Box?"** question.
   - Select **“Go to section based on answer”**.
   - **Configure Paths:**
     - **If "Pull Box" or "Mystery Box" is selected:** Go to **"Pull Box Creation"** section.
     - **If "Neither" is selected:** Continue to the next section or submit the form.

2. **(Optional) Set Up Dependent Fields for Sets Based on TCG Selection:**
   - **Note:** Google Forms does not natively support dependent fields within the same section. To achieve this, consider using **multiple sections** or **third-party add-ons**.
   - **Simpler Approach:** Allow manual selection of sets after selecting TCGs.

#### **c. Finalize Form Updates**

1. **Review the Form:**
   - Ensure that the **Pull Box Creation** section appears only when **"Pull Box"** or **"Mystery Box"** is selected.
   - Verify that all conditional fields are working as intended.

2. **Make Fields Required:**
   - Ensure that **"Is this a Pull Box or Mystery Box?"**, **"Number of Items"**, **"Define Value Ranges"**, **"Product Types Included"**, and **"Specific Sets or Games"** are marked as **“Required”** when applicable.

#### **d. Example Form Flow:**

- **Section 1:** Product Entry
  - All existing product fields.
- **Section 2:** Pull Box Creation
  - **Is this a Pull Box or Mystery Box?** [Pull Box/Mystery Box/Neither]
  - If **Pull Box** or **Mystery Box**:
    - **Number of Items:** [Number]
    - **Define Value Ranges:** [Paragraph Text]
    - **Product Types Included:** [Checkboxes]
    - **Specific Sets or Games:** [Checkboxes or Dropdown]
    - **Customization Rules:** [Paragraph Text]
  - If **Neither**:
    - Continue or Submit

---

### **3. Create Pull Boxes in Google Sheets**

With the **Google Form** updated, we can now set up **Google Sheets** to automatically generate pull boxes based on the entries. This involves creating a separate sheet to handle pull box parameters, selecting products based on defined criteria, and calculating the total value and profit.

#### **a. Set Up the "PullBoxes" Sheet**

1. **Create a New Sheet:**
   - At the bottom of your **"FoSGamers Inventory Data"** Google Sheet, click the **"+"** button to add a new sheet.
   - **Rename the Sheet:** Right-click the new tab and select **“Rename”**. Name it **"PullBoxes"**.

2. **Define Columns for Pull Boxes:**

   | **A**          | **B**           | **C**                | **D**             | **E**              | **F**                 | **G**                 | **H**                  | **I**               | **J**             | **K**                    | **L**                | **M**          | **N**              | **O**        | **P**              | **Q**           | **R**          | **S**              | **T**      | **U**          | **V**             |
   |----------------|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|--------------------|--------------|--------------------|-----------------|----------------|--------------------|------------|----------------|-------------------|
   | PullBox ID     | Box Type        | Number of Items      | Product Types     | Specific Sets/Games| Value Ranges           | Customization Rules    | Selected Products      | Total Value         | Total Cost        | Revenue Potential        | Profit               | Notes          | Date Created       |              |                    |                 |                |                    |            |                |                   |

   **Note:** Adjust columns based on your specific needs. The above is a suggested layout.

#### **b. Generate Unique PullBox IDs**

1. **PullBox ID (Column A):**
   - **Purpose:** Assign a unique identifier to each pull box for easy tracking.
   - **Formula in A2:**  
     ```plaintext
     =IF(B2="", "", "PB-" & TEXT(ROW()-1, "000"))
     ```
   - **How to Enter:**
     1. Click on cell **A2**.
     2. Enter the formula: `=IF(B2="", "", "PB-" & TEXT(ROW()-1, "000"))`
     3. Press **Enter**.
     4. Drag the fill handle (small square at the bottom-right corner of A2) **downward** to apply the formula to other rows.

   **Result:**  
   - **A2:** PB-001
   - **A3:** PB-002
   - And so on.

#### **c. Define Pull Box Creation Logic**

To automate the creation of pull boxes with customized parameters, we'll use a combination of **Google Apps Script** and **Google Sheets formulas**. Given the complexity of selecting items based on multiple value ranges, product types, and specific sets or games, **Google Apps Script** is the most efficient method.

---

### **4. Implement Google Apps Script for Automation**

**Note:** This step involves writing a script to automate the selection of products based on user-defined parameters. If you're unfamiliar with scripting, follow the instructions carefully or seek assistance.

#### **a. Introduction to Google Apps Script**

**Google Apps Script** is a powerful tool that allows you to automate tasks in Google Sheets, Forms, and other Google Workspace applications using JavaScript-based code.

#### **b. Setting Up Google Apps Script**

1. **Open Apps Script Editor:**
   - In your **"FoSGamers Inventory Data"** Google Sheet, click on **“Extensions”** > **“Apps Script”**.

2. **Create a New Script:**
   - Click on **“New project”**.
   - Name your project, e.g., **"PullBoxGenerator"**.

#### **c. Write the Script**

Below is a **comprehensive script** to automate pull box creation based on form submissions. This script will:

1. Detect form submissions that are pull boxes or mystery boxes.
2. Parse the defined value ranges.
3. Select products from the inventory based on product types, value ranges, and specific sets or games.
4. Populate the "PullBoxes" sheet with selected products.
5. Update inventory quantities accordingly.

**Important:** Customize the column indices in the script based on your actual sheet layout.

```javascript
function onFormSubmit(e) {
  const response = e.values; // Array of form responses

  // Adjust indices based on your form and sheet structure
  // Assuming the following order:
  // [0] Timestamp
  // [1] Product Category
  // [2] Trading Card Game
  // [3] Set Name
  // [4] Product Name
  // [5] Quantity
  // [6] Reorder Level
  // [7] Reorder Quantity

  // [17] Is this a Pull Box or Mystery Box?
  // [18] Number of Items (for Pull/Mystery Box)
  // [19] Define Value Ranges
  // [20] Product Types Included
  // [21] Specific Sets or Games
  // [22] Customization Rules

  const isPullBox = response[17].toLowerCase(); // "pull box", "mystery box", "neither"

  if (isPullBox === 'neither') {
    return; // Exit if not a pull box
  }

  const boxType = isPullBox === 'pull box' ? 'Pull Box' : 'Mystery Box';
  const totalItems = parseInt(response[18]);
  const valueRangesRaw = response[19];
  const productTypesIncluded = response[20].split(',').map(item => item.trim().toLowerCase()); // e.g., ["individual cards", "sealed packs"]
  const specificSetsOrGames = response[21].split(',').map(item => item.trim().toLowerCase()); // e.g., ["magic: the gathering", "innistrad"]
  const customizationRules = response[22]; // Optional

  // Parse Value Ranges
  // Expected format:
  // 10 cards of $1-$5
  // 5 packs of $5-$10

  let valueRanges = [];
  const lines = valueRangesRaw.split('\n');
  lines.forEach(line => {
    const regex = /(\d+)\s+(cards|packs)\s+of\s+\$?([\d.]+)-\$?([\d.]+)/i;

    const selected = selectProducts(range.type, range.min, range.max, range.count, specificSetsOrGames);
    selectedProducts = selectedProducts.concat(selected);
  });

  // Check if enough products were selected
  const totalSelected = selectedProducts.length;
  if (totalSelected < totalItems) {
    // Optionally, select additional common items to fill the box
    const remaining = totalItems - totalSelected;
    const additional = selectProducts('cards', 0, 1000, remaining, specificSetsOrGames); // Adjust min and max as needed
    selectedProducts = selectedProducts.concat(additional);
  }

  // Ensure total selected items match the desired number
  selectedProducts = selectedProducts.slice(0, totalItems);

  // Update Inventory Quantities
  selectedProducts.forEach(product => {
    const index = inventoryMap.findIndex(item => item.productName === product.productName);
    if (index !== -1) {
      const sheetRow = inventoryMap[index].rowIndex; // Get the actual row in the sheet
      const currentQty = inventorySheet.getRange(sheetRow, 6).getValue(); // Column F: Quantity
      inventorySheet.getRange(sheetRow, 6).setValue(currentQty - 1);
    }
  });

  // Calculate Total Value and Total Cost
  let totalValue = 0;
  let totalCost = 0;
  selectedProducts.forEach(product => {
    totalValue += product.sellingPricePerUnit;
    // Whatnot Fees: 8% commission + 2.9% payment processing + $0.30
    const commission = product.sellingPricePerUnit * 0.08;
    const processing = (product.sellingPricePerUnit + product.buyerPaidShipping) * 0.029 + 0.30;
    totalCost += product.costPerUnit + product.shippingMaterialCost + commission + processing;
  });

  let profit = totalValue - totalCost;

  // Prepare Selected Products String

  ]);
}
```

#### **Important Notes:**

- **Rarity Column:** Ensure that your **"FoSGamers Inventory Data"** sheet includes a **"Rarity"** column (e.g., Common, Uncommon, Rare) for each product. This script assumes it's the 18th column (index 17). Adjust the index based on your actual sheet layout.

- **Adjust Column Indices:** Modify the column indices in the script to match your sheet's structure. For example, if "Rarity" is in column **R**, adjust the `item.rarity` assignment accordingly.

- **Error Handling:** The script does basic checks but does not handle all possible errors. Consider adding more robust error handling as needed.

- **Customization Rules:** The script currently does not enforce customization rules (e.g., "No duplicate rare cards"). Implement additional logic if necessary.

---

#### **d. Set Up Triggers**

1. **Trigger the Script on Form Submission:**
   - In the Apps Script editor, click on the **clock icon** (Triggers) on the left sidebar.
   - Click **“Add Trigger”**.
   - **Configure the Trigger:**
     - **Choose which function to run:** `onFormSubmit`
     - **Select event source:** From spreadsheet
     - **Select event type:** On form submit
   - Click **“Save”**.
   - **Authorize the Script:** You'll be prompted to authorize the script to access your Google Sheets. Follow the on-screen instructions to grant the necessary permissions.

---

#### **e. Testing the Script**

1. **Submit a Test Pull Box Entry via Google Form:**
   - Fill out the form with **"Is this a Pull Box or Mystery Box?"** set to **"Pull Box"** or **"Mystery Box"**.
   - Define the **Number of Items**, **Value Ranges**, **Product Types Included**, **Specific Sets or Games**, and any **Customization Rules**.
   - **Example:**
     - **Is this a Pull Box or Mystery Box?** Pull Box
     - **Number of Items:** 16
     - **Define Value Ranges:**
       ```
       10 cards of $1-$5
       5 packs of $5-$10
       1 card of $60
       ```
     - **Product Types Included:** Individual Cards, Sealed Packs
     - **Specific Sets or Games:** Magic: The Gathering, Innistrad
     - **Customization Rules:** No duplicate rare cards, Include at least one accessory

2. **Check the "PullBoxes" Sheet:**
   - Ensure that a new pull box is created with the correct number of items and that inventory levels are updated accordingly.
   - Verify that **Total Value**, **Total Cost**, and **Profit** are calculated accurately.

3. **Review Inventory:**
   - Confirm that the quantities of selected products have decreased by the number of times they've been included in pull boxes.

4. **Handle Mixed Items (Cards and Packs):**
   - Test with entries that include a mix of single cards and packs to ensure the script handles them correctly.

---

### **5. Validation Measures**

To maintain **data integrity** and ensure that pull boxes are generated correctly, implement the following **validation measures**:

1. **Protected Columns:**
   - **Columns A to V** in the **"PullBoxes"** sheet contain critical formulas and data.
   - **How to Protect:**
     1. Select **Columns A to V** by clicking and dragging the column headers.
     2. Right-click on the selected columns and choose **“Protect range”**.
     3. In the sidebar, click **“Set permissions”**.
     4. Select **“Restrict who can edit this range”**.
     5. Assign permissions (e.g., only you can edit).
     6. Click **“Done”**.

2. **Conditional Formatting:**
   - **Ensure Rarity Distribution:**
     - Highlight boxes that do not meet the defined rarity distribution.
     - **How to Apply:**
       1. Select the relevant cells in the **"PullBoxes"** sheet.
       2. Click on **“Format”** > **“Conditional formatting”**.
       3. Set rules based on the expected number of items per rarity.
       4. Choose a **red fill color** for mismatches.
       5. Click **“Done”**.

   - **Validate Total Items:**
     - Ensure that the number of items in each pull box matches the defined box size.
     - **How to Apply:**
       1. Select the **Number of Items** column.
       2. Click on **“Format”** > **“Conditional formatting”**.
       3. Use a **custom formula** to check if the sum of items equals the box size.
          - **Example Formula:**  
            If **Total Items** is in column **C** and **Selected Products** count should match:
            ```plaintext
            =COUNTA(SPLIT(G2, ",")) <> C2
            ```
       4. Choose a **red fill color** for discrepancies.
       5. Click **“Done”**.

3. **Inventory Check:**
   - **Ensure Sufficient Inventory:**
     - Before creating a pull box, verify that there are enough items in inventory.
     - **How to Apply:**
       - Use **formulas** to compare inventory levels with the required number of items for pull boxes.
       - Highlight rows where inventory is insufficient.
       - **Example Formula in Inventory Sheet:**
         - Assuming **Column E** is **Quantity**, and you have a **Minimum Threshold**:
           ```plaintext
           =E2 < [Minimum Required]
           ```
         - Apply conditional formatting to highlight low inventory.

4. **Automated Alerts:**
   - **Set Up Notifications:**
     - Configure Google Sheets to send you an email or pop-up notification when a pull box does not meet the defined parameters or when inventory levels are low.
     - **How to Apply:**
       - Use **Google Apps Script** to set up triggers that send alerts based on specific conditions.
       - **Sample Script for Low Inventory Alert:**
         ```javascript
         function checkInventoryLevels() {
           const ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
           const inventorySheet = ss.getSheetByName('FoSGamers Inventory Data');
           const data = inventorySheet.getDataRange().getValues();
           const headers = data.shift(); // Remove headers
           let lowInventoryItems = [];

           data.forEach(row => {
             const productName = row[4];
             const quantity = parseInt(row[5]);
             const reorderLevel = parseInt(row[6]);
             if (quantity < reorderLevel) {
               lowInventoryItems.push(productName + ' (Quantity: ' + quantity + ')');
             }
           });

           if (lowInventoryItems.length > 0) {
             MailApp.sendEmail({
               to: 'your-email@example.com',
               subject: 'Low Inventory Alert',
               body: 'The following items are below their reorder levels:\n\n' + lowInventoryItems.join('\n')
             });
           }
         }
         ```
       - **Set Up a Time-Driven Trigger:**
         - In Apps Script, set a trigger to run `checkInventoryLevels` daily or weekly.

I should be able to build any combination of anything in my inventory is pretty much what I'm getting at. It could be one type of thing. It could be a spread of things across all products that I have. It could be literally anything that I want. It can be configured however I want. I just need you to be able to allow me to select the options that will be available in my inventory, each type of option that there would be, and then build the box based off of the options I select. If I say I want to do all items, and I would just say find all items that are in $10 area, then you can do that. Or maybe I have a certain selection of cards I want, and then I want a certain set to have packs put in there, then you do that. Or maybe I want a combination of packs and a combination of cards. You can do all that. Use your imagination and understand what I mean. Literally anything, combined however, potentially possible to build this. I mean literally everything combined however possible.

          - **Custom Option:** Allow multiple selections or custom input
        - **Required:** No (optional based on use case)

        **Implementation Options:**
        - **Separate Sections for TCGs and Sets:**
          - **Select Trading Card Games (TCGs):** (Checkboxes)
            - Options: Magic: The Gathering, Sorcery, etc.
            - **Add "All TCGs" as an option for flexibility**
          - **Select Specific Sets (Optional):** (Checkboxes or Dropdown)
            - Populate based on selected TCGs using **dependent logic** (advanced)
            - Alternatively, allow manual selection or input

        **Recommended Approach:**
        - **Two Separate Fields:**
          1. **Select Trading Card Games (TCGs):** (Checkboxes)
             - Options: Magic: The Gathering, Sorcery, etc.
             - **Add "All TCGs" as an option for flexibility**
          2. **Select Specific Sets (Optional):** (Checkboxes)
             - List sets relevant to selected TCGs
             - **Add "All Sets" as an option**

        **Note:** Google Forms has limited support for dynamic dependent fields. To maintain simplicity, allow users to manually select sets after choosing TCGs.

     6. **Customization Rules** (Paragraph Text) *(Optional)*
        - **Description:** Specify any rules for product inclusion.
        - **Example:** "No duplicate rare cards", "Include at least one accessory"

#### **b. Set Up Conditional Logic**

To ensure that the **Pull Box fields** appear only when necessary, we'll use **conditional logic**.

1. **Set Up Conditional Logic for Box Type:**
   - Click on the **three dots (⋮)** at the bottom right of the **"Is this a Pull Box or Mystery Box?"** question.
   - Select **“Go to section based on answer”**.
   - **Configure Paths:**
     - **If "Pull Box" or "Mystery Box" is selected:** Go to **"Pull Box Creation"** section.
     - **If "Neither" is selected:** Continue to the next section or submit the form.

2. **(Optional) Set Up Dependent Fields for Sets Based on TCG Selection:**
   - **Note:** Google Forms does not natively support dependent fields within the same section. To achieve this, consider using **multiple sections** or **third-party add-ons**.
   - **Simpler Approach:** Allow manual selection of sets after selecting TCGs.

#### **c. Finalize Form Updates**

1. **Review the Form:**
   - Ensure that the **Pull Box Creation** section appears only when **"Pull Box"** or **"Mystery Box"** is selected.
   - Verify that all conditional fields are working as intended.

2. **Make Fields Required:**
   - Ensure that **"Is this a Pull Box or Mystery Box?"**, **"Number of Items"**, **"Define Value Ranges"**, and **"Product Types Included"** are marked as **“Required”** when applicable.
   - **Specific Sets or Games:** Make **required** only if you want every pull/mystery box to be constrained by specific sets or games. Otherwise, leave as **optional**.

#### **d. Example Form Flow:**

- **Section 1:** Product Entry
  - All existing product fields.
- **Section 2:** Pull Box Creation
  - **Is this a Pull Box or Mystery Box?** [Pull Box/Mystery Box/Neither]
  - If **Pull Box** or **Mystery Box**:
    - **Number of Items:** [Number]
    - **Define Value Ranges:** [Paragraph Text]
    - **Product Types Included:** [Checkboxes]
    - **Select Trading Card Games (TCGs):** [Checkboxes]
    - **Select Specific Sets (Optional):** [Checkboxes]
    - **Customization Rules:** [Paragraph Text]
  - If **Neither**:
    - Continue or Submit

---

### **3. Create Pull Boxes in Google Sheets**

With the **Google Form** updated, we can now set up **Google Sheets** to automatically generate pull boxes based on the entries. This involves creating a separate sheet to handle pull box parameters, selecting products based on defined criteria, and calculating the total value and profit.

#### **a. Set Up the "PullBoxes" Sheet**

1. **Create a New Sheet:**
   - At the bottom of your **"FoSGamers Inventory Data"** Google Sheet, click the **"+"** button to add a new sheet.
   - **Rename the Sheet:** Right-click the new tab and select **“Rename”**. Name it **"PullBoxes"**.

2. **Define Columns for Pull Boxes:**

   | **A**          | **B**           | **C**           | **D**               | **E**              | **F**                 | **G**                 | **H**                  | **I**               | **J**             | **K**                    | **L**                | **M**          | **N**              | **O**        | **P**              | **Q**           | **R**          | **S**              | **T**      | **U**          | **V**             |
   |----------------|-----------------|------------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|--------------------|--------------|--------------------|-----------------|----------------|--------------------|------------|----------------|-------------------|
   | PullBox ID     | Box Type        | Number of Items  | Product Types       | Specific Sets/Games| Value Ranges           | Customization Rules    | Selected Products      | Total Value         | Total Cost        | Revenue Potential        | Profit               | Notes          | Date Created       |              |                    |                 |                |                    |            |                |                   |

   **Note:** Adjust columns based on your specific needs. The above is a suggested layout.

#### **b. Generate Unique PullBox IDs**

1. **PullBox ID (Column A):**
   - **Purpose:** Assign a unique identifier to each pull box for easy tracking.
   - **Formula in A2:**  
     ```plaintext
     =IF(B2="", "", "PB-" & TEXT(ROW()-1, "000"))
     ```
   - **How to Enter:**
     1. Click on cell **A2**.
     2. Enter the formula: `=IF(B2="", "", "PB-" & TEXT(ROW()-1, "000"))`
     3. Press **Enter**.
     4. Drag the fill handle (small square at the bottom-right corner of A2) **downward** to apply the formula to other rows.

   **Result:**  
   - **A2:** PB-001
   - **A3:** PB-002
   - And so on.

#### **c. Define Pull Box Creation Logic**

To automate the creation of pull boxes with customized parameters, we'll use a combination of **Google Apps Script** and **Google Sheets formulas**. Given the complexity of selecting items based on multiple value ranges, product types, specific sets or games, and any combination thereof, **Google Apps Script** is the most efficient method.

---

### **4. Implement Google Apps Script for Automation**

**Note:** This step involves writing a script to automate the selection of products based on user-defined parameters. If you're unfamiliar with scripting, follow the instructions carefully or seek assistance.

#### **a. Introduction to Google Apps Script**

**Google Apps Script** is a powerful tool that allows you to automate tasks in Google Sheets, Forms, and other Google Workspace applications using JavaScript-based code.

#### **b. Setting Up Google Apps Script**

1. **Open Apps Script Editor:**
   - In your **"FoSGamers Inventory Data"** Google Sheet, click on **“Extensions”** > **“Apps Script”**.

2. **Create a New Script:**
   - Click on **“New project”**.
   - Name your project, e.g., **"AdvancedPullBoxGenerator"**.

#### **c. Write the Script**

Below is a **comprehensive script** to automate pull box creation based on form submissions. This script will:

1. Detect form submissions that are pull boxes or mystery boxes.
2. Parse the defined value ranges.
3. Select products from the inventory based on product types, value ranges, specific sets or games, and any combination thereof.
4. Populate the "PullBoxes" sheet with selected products.
5. Update inventory quantities accordingly.

**Important:** Customize the column indices in the script based on your actual sheet layout.

```javascript
function onFormSubmit(e) {
  const response = e.values; // Array of form responses

  // Adjust indices based on your form and sheet structure
  // Assuming the following order:
  // [0] Timestamp
  // [1] Product Category
  // [2] Trading Card Game
  // [3] Set Name
  // [4] Product Name
  // [5] Quantity
  // [6] Reorder Level
  // [7] Reorder Quantity
  // [8] Cost per Unit
  // [9] Selling Price per Unit
  // [10] Shipping Material Cost
  // [11] Buyer-Paid Shipping
  // [12] Number of Items (for Pull/Mystery Box)
  // [13] Shipping Scenario
  // [14] Date Added
  // [15] Expiration Date
  // [16] Notes
  // [17] Is this a Pull Box or Mystery Box?
  // [18] Number of Items (for Pull/Mystery Box)
  // [19] Define Value Ranges
  // [20] Product Types Included
  // [21] Specific Sets or Games
  // [22] Customization Rules

  const isPullBox = response[17].toLowerCase(); // "pull box", "mystery box", "neither"

  if (isPullBox === 'neither') {
    return; // Exit if not a pull box
  }

  const boxType = isPullBox === 'pull box' ? 'Pull Box' : 'Mystery Box';
  const totalItems = parseInt(response[18]);
  const valueRangesRaw = response[19];
  const productTypesIncluded = response[20].split(',').map(item => item.trim().toLowerCase()); // e.g., ["individual cards", "sealed packs"]
  const specificSetsOrGames = response[21] ? response[21].split(',').map(item => item.trim().toLowerCase()) : []; // e.g., ["magic: the gathering", "innistrad"]
  const customizationRules = response[22]; // Optional

  // Parse Value Ranges
  // Expected format:
  // 10 cards of $1-$5
  // 5 packs of $5-$10
  // 1 card of $60
  let valueRanges = [];
  const lines = valueRangesRaw.split('\n');
  lines.forEach(line => {
    const regex = /(\d+)\s+(cards|packs)\s+of\s+\$?([\d.]+)-\$?([\d.]+)/i;
    const singleValueRegex = /(\d+)\s+(cards|packs)\s+of\s+\$?([\d.]+)/i;
    let match = line.match(regex);
    if (match) {
      valueRanges.push({
        count: parseInt(match[1]),
        type: match[2].toLowerCase(),
        min: parseFloat(match[3]),
        max: parseFloat(match[4])
      });
    } else {

      if (match) {
        valueRanges.push({
          count: parseInt(match[1]),
          type: match[2].toLowerCase(),
          min: parseFloat(match[3]),
          max: parseFloat(match[3])
        });
      }
    }
  });

  // Access Sheets
  const ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  const inventorySheet = ss.getSheetByName('FoSGamers Inventory Data');
  const pullBoxesSheet = ss.getSheetByName('PullBoxes');

  // Fetch Inventory Data
  const inventoryData = inventorySheet.getDataRange().getValues();
  const headers = inventoryData.shift(); // Remove headers

  // Create a map for inventory with indexes

    };
  });

  // Function to select products based on criteria
  function selectProducts(type, min, max, count, specificSetsOrGames) {

        typeMatch = (item.productCategory === 'sealed pack');
      } else {
        typeMatch = false;
      }

      // Check for specific sets or games
      let setOrGameMatch = false;
      if (specificSetsOrGames.length === 0 || specificSetsOrGames.includes('all')) {
        setOrGameMatch = true;
      } else {
        // Check if item's set or game is in the selected list
        setOrGameMatch = specificSetsOrGames.includes(item.tradingCardGame) || specificSetsOrGames.includes(item.setName);
      }

      let value = item.sellingPricePerUnit;
      let valueMatch = (value >= min && value <= max);
      let availability = (item.quantity > 0);

      return typeMatch && valueMatch && availability && setOrGameMatch;
    });

    // Shuffle eligible products
    eligible = shuffleArray(eligible);

    // Select required number
    return eligible.slice(0, count);
  }

  // Utility function to shuffle an array
  function shuffleArray(array) {
    for (let i = array.length -1; i > 0; i--){
      const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i +1));
      [array[i], array[j]] = [array[j], array[i]];
    }
    return array;
  }

  // Select Products Based on Value Ranges
  let selectedProducts = [];
  valueRanges.forEach(range => {
    const selected = selectProducts(range.type, range.min, range.max, range.count, specificSetsOrGames);
    selectedProducts = selectedProducts.concat(selected);
  });

  // Check if enough products were selected
  const totalSelected = selectedProducts.length;
  if (totalSelected < totalItems) {
    // Optionally, select additional common items to fill the box
    const remaining = totalItems - totalSelected;
    const additional = selectProducts('cards', 0, 1000, remaining, specificSetsOrGames); // Adjust min and max as needed
    selectedProducts = selectedProducts.concat(additional);
  }

  // Ensure total selected items match the desired number

    response[16], // Notes
    new Date()
  ]);
}
```

#### **d. Important Notes:**

- **Rarity Column:** Ensure that your **"FoSGamers Inventory Data"** sheet includes a **"Rarity"** column (e.g., Common, Uncommon, Rare) for each product. This script assumes it's the 18th column (index 17). Adjust the index based on your actual sheet layout.

- **Adjust Column Indices:** Modify the column indices in the script to match your sheet's structure. For example, if "Rarity" is in column **R**, adjust the `item.rarity` assignment accordingly.

- **Error Handling:** The script performs basic checks but does not handle all possible errors. Consider adding more robust error handling as needed, such as:

  - **Insufficient Inventory:** Notify if there aren't enough items to fulfill the pull box requirements.
  
  - **Invalid Input Formats:** Ensure that value ranges are correctly formatted.
  
  - **Duplicate Items:** Prevent duplicate selections if required by customization rules.

- **Customization Rules:** The script currently does not enforce customization rules (e.g., "No duplicate rare cards", "Include at least one accessory"). Implement additional logic if necessary.

---

### **5. Validation Measures**

To maintain **data integrity** and ensure that pull boxes are generated correctly, implement the following **validation measures**:

1. **Protected Columns:**
   - **Columns A to V** in the **"PullBoxes"** sheet contain critical formulas and data.
   - **How to Protect:**
     1. Select **Columns A to V** by clicking and dragging the column headers.
     2. Right-click on the selected columns and choose **“Protect range”**.
     3. In the sidebar, click **“Set permissions”**.
     4. Select **“Restrict who can edit this range”**.
     5. Assign permissions (e.g., only you can edit).
     6. Click **“Done”**.

2. **Conditional Formatting:**
   - **Ensure Rarity Distribution:**
     - Highlight boxes that do not meet the defined rarity distribution.
     - **How to Apply:**
       1. Select the relevant cells in the **"PullBoxes"** sheet (e.g., **Selected Products** column).
       2. Click on **“Format”** > **“Conditional formatting”**.
       3. Set rules based on the expected number of items per rarity.
          - **Example Rule:** If the number of rare cards is less than expected.
       4. Choose a **red fill color** for mismatches.
       5. Click **“Done”**.

   - **Validate Total Items:**
     - Ensure that the number of items in each pull box matches the defined box size.
     - **How to Apply:**
       1. Select the **Number of Items** column (e.g., Column C).
       2. Click on **“Format”** > **“Conditional formatting”**.
       3. Use a **custom formula** to check if the count of selected products equals the box size.
          - **Example Formula:**  
            If **Total Items** is in cell **C2** and **Selected Products** are comma-separated in **G2**:
            ```plaintext
            =COUNTA(SPLIT(G2, ",")) <> C2
            ```
       4. Choose a **red fill color** for discrepancies.
       5. Click **“Done”**.

3. **Inventory Check:**
   - **Ensure Sufficient Inventory:**
     - Before creating a pull box, verify that there are enough items in inventory.
     - **How to Apply:**
       - Use **formulas** to compare inventory levels with the required number of items for pull boxes.
       - Highlight rows where inventory is insufficient.
       - **Example Formula in Inventory Sheet:**
         - Assuming **Column E** is **Quantity**, and you have a **Minimum Threshold**:
           ```plaintext
           =E2 < [Minimum Required]
           ```
         - Apply conditional formatting to highlight low inventory.

4. **Automated Alerts:**
   - **Set Up Notifications:**
     - Configure Google Sheets to send you an email or pop-up notification when a pull box does not meet the defined parameters or when inventory levels are low.
     - **How to Apply:**
       - Use **Google Apps Script** to set up triggers that send alerts based on specific conditions.
       - **Sample Script for Low Inventory Alert:**
         ```javascript
         function checkInventoryLevels() {
           const ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
           const inventorySheet = ss.getSheetByName('FoSGamers Inventory Data');
           const data = inventorySheet.getDataRange().getValues();
           const headers = data.shift(); // Remove headers
           let lowInventoryItems = [];

           data.forEach(row => {
             const productName = row[4];
             const quantity = parseInt(row[5]);
             const reorderLevel = parseInt(row[6]);
             if (quantity < reorderLevel) {
               lowInventoryItems.push(productName + ' (Quantity: ' + quantity + ')');
             }
           });

           if (lowInventoryItems.length > 0) {
             MailApp.sendEmail({
               to: 'your-email@example.com',
               subject: 'Low Inventory Alert',
               body: 'The following items are below their reorder levels:\n\n' + lowInventoryItems.join('\n')
             });
           }
         }
         ```
       - **Set Up a Time-Driven Trigger:**
         - In Apps Script, set a trigger to run `checkInventoryLevels` daily or weekly.

---

### **6. Flexible Updates and Maintenance**

1. **Adding New Pull Box Sizes:**
   - **Update Parameters:**
     - Define new sizes and their parameters.
   - **Update Form:**
     - Add new options in the **Box Type** or **Number of Items** fields if necessary.
   - **Update Script:**
     - Modify the **Google Apps Script** to handle new box sizes and their corresponding parameters.

2. **Adjusting Value Ranges:**
   - **Modify Distribution:**
     - Change the number of items per value range as needed.
   - **Update Formulas/Script:**
     - Reflect the new distribution in the selection logic within the script.

3. **Adding New Product Categories or Rarities:**
   - **Update Inventory:**
     - Add new categories or rarities to your inventory data.
   - **Update Pull Box Logic:**
     - Ensure that new categories or rarities are considered during pull box generation.

4. **Enhancing Pull Box Customization:**
   - **Add More Custom Fields:**
     - Include additional customization options in the Google Form and Sheets.
   - **Update Scripts/Formulas:**
     - Reflect these changes in the automation logic.

5. **Maintaining Data Integrity:**
   - **Consistent Naming Conventions:** Ensure that shipping materials, rarities, sets, games, and categories are consistently named across forms and sheets.
   - **Regular Audits:** Periodically review the data and formulas to ensure accuracy.

---

### **7. Example Pull Box Creation**

Let's walk through a comprehensive example to ensure our pull box generation works correctly.

#### **Example 1: Custom Pull Box with Mixed Items and Specific Sets**

- **PullBox ID:** PB-001
- **Box Type:** Pull Box
- **Number of Items:** 16
- **Product Types Included:** Individual Cards, Sealed Packs
- **Specific Sets or Games:** Magic: The Gathering, Innistrad
- **Value Ranges:**
  ```
  10 cards of $1-$5
  5 packs of $5-$10
  1 card of $60
  ```
- **Customization Rules:** No duplicate rare cards, Include at least one accessory
- **Selected Products:** "Common Card A", "Common Card B", "Common Pack A", ..., "Rare Card A"
- **Total Value:** $100.00
- **Total Cost:** $91.99
- **Profit:** $8.01
- **Notes:** "Includes exclusive stickers"

**Breakdown:**

1. **Whatnot Commission:**
   - Total Selling Price: $100.00
   - Commission: 8% of $100.00 = $8.00

2. **Processing Fee:**
   - Total Transaction: $100.00 (selling price) + $5.00 (buyer-paid shipping) = $105.00
   - Processing Fee: 2.9% of $105.00 + $0.30 = $3.05 + $0.30 = $3.35

3. **Total Whatnot Fees:**
   - $8.00 (Commission) + $3.35 (Processing) = $11.35

4. **Packing Cost:**

One of the other things that should be done is before the poll box pulls this stuff from the inventory to say that it is generated, I should confirm that I'm okay with it and it should be allowing me to make changes to it. Now I should be able to change individual items that are in it or bulk items that are in it.

[2024-09-26 15:45:12] FoSGamers:
**Building the system**

The user is developing a system to manage inventory and create pull or mystery boxes with customizable parameters. They seek a feature to confirm and possibly amend the box before inventory reduction.

**Evaluating two-step options**

I'm weighing a two-step process: draft an inventory list for confirmation via Google Sheets, or generate and email items for user approval. The first option seems more practical.

**Streamlining inventory management**

I'm focusing on enhancing Google Sheets for inventory management. By mapping out a system for generating a pending pull box sheet, users can review, adjust, and confirm items before finalizing.

Integrating Google Sheets for managing pull boxes allows users to modify and confirm entries directly, which can streamline the process compared to custom interfaces.

[2024-09-26 15:45:12] ChatGPT:
Absolutely! Incorporating a **confirmation and editing step** before finalizing pull boxes or mystery boxes is essential for ensuring accuracy and flexibility in your inventory management system. This enhancement will allow you to **review**, **modify**, and **approve** the contents of each pull box before it affects your inventory levels.

Here's a comprehensive guide to implementing this feature within your existing **Google Forms**, **Google Sheets**, and **Google Apps Script** setup.

## **Stage 3: Automated Pull Box Generation**

**Objective:**  
Introduce an **Advanced Automated Pull Box Generation** feature with a **confirmation and editing workflow**. This allows you to create **pull boxes** or **mystery boxes** with **customized and multiple parameters**, including the number of items, value ranges, product types (cards or packs), specific sets or games, and any combination thereof. Additionally, it incorporates a **review and approval step** before finalizing the box and updating inventory.

---

### **1. Define Pull Box Parameters**

Before automating pull box creation, it's essential to **define the parameters** that determine the contents and value of each pull box. This ensures consistency and accuracy in the generation process.

#### **a. What is a Pull Box?**

A **Pull Box** (or **Mystery Box**) is a bundle of products (cards, packs, accessories) packaged together to be sold as a single unit. Pull boxes can offer variety to customers and help in moving inventory more efficiently.

#### **b. Parameters to Define:**

1. **Box Type:** Determines whether it's a **Pull Box** or **Mystery Box**.
2. **Number of Items:** Total number of items (cards or packs)

[2024-09-26 15:48:41] FoSGamers:
Now, it's not going to be individual packs, I mean sealed packs only. It could be like a bundle, literally like I said, anything that's in there. It could be a whole, maybe it's a whole box that we're going to put in there of some kind. A whole box of packs, you know, that type of thing is what I'm getting at. A whole booster box. Then, the sets should only show what I have in stock, so we shouldn't be pulling anything from stuff that I don't have available. The customization rules, I'm not sure how this is going to work because I don't think me typing in anything is going to make it change. Maybe that's there for the description though, so you can give me the description of what is in there. So, I think that's right. Remember, everything in my inventory could be put into a pull box or a mystery box, mystery bag, in any combination, in any order, in any amount, out there. That's how flexible this needs to be.

[2024-09-26 15:48:53] FoSGamers:
**Building a flexible system**

I’m working on a flexible system to generate pull boxes from inventory using Google Forms, Sheets, and Script. The system ensures only current stock of sealed or specific packs/bundles is included, with customizable descriptions.

[2024-09-26 15:53:09] FoSGamers:
I don't know if it's going to need you to update anywhere else, but some of the types of inventory items that can be had are per each kind of set release of things. There could be a bundle item, they call them, that are sold by the companies. There could be pre-constructed decks. There could be special edition items. There could be sealed boxes. There could be sealed cases. And each one of those items could have a sealed case of collector boosters of a certain thing. So I can tell you it's a sealed case of collector boosters of Modern Horizon 3. You'll know that. So I'll have one case that's sealed. I'll tell you how many boxes are in the case. Then I'll tell you how many packs are in each box. And you'll be able to break everything down into packs for me and how many packs I have in inventory and everything like that, and how many boxes I have, and how many sealed items I have, how many cases I have, and that type of thing. That way, my whole inventory is there. And that way, if somebody wants to buy a box, I can tell them what the cost of it would be for a box if they want to buy it from me. Because I already know my cost, and I'll be able to tell them what the sale price to them would be, type of thing, because I'll be able to generate that all easily based off of pulling information from here. And one of the things I'd like to do, too, is be able to have that Google Form at some point. I should be able to use it to search my inventory to find information, about what I have. Maybe not right away. That could be something that's a little bit later on at some point. But it's definitely something that should be a feature that a form should be allowed to do that to make it nice and easy so that we don't need to go searching through a Google Sheet to see what inventory is. People can easily see what is there.

### **c. Setting Up the Google Sheet**

1. **Create the Inventory Sheet:**
   - Open Google Sheets.
   - Create a new spreadsheet named **"FoSGamers Inventory Data"**.
   - Rename the first sheet/tab to **"Inventory"**.

2. **Define Columns:**
   - In the **"Inventory"** sheet, set up the columns as outlined in **Section b** above (Columns A to V).

3. **Apply Data Validation and Formatting:**
   - **Product Category (Column B):**
     - Use **Data Validation** to create a dropdown list of all possible categories (Individual Card, Sealed Pack, Booster Box, Bundle, Pre-constructed Deck, Special Edition Item, Sealed Case, Accessories).
     - **How to Apply:**
       1. Select Column **B**.
       2. Go to **Data** > **Data validation**.
       3. Under **Criteria**, choose **List of items** and enter the categories separated by commas.
       4. Click **Save**.
   
   - **Trading Card Game (Column C):**
     - Similarly, use **Data Validation** for consistent TCG entries (Magic: The Gathering, Sorcery, etc.).
   
   - **Set Name (Column D):**
     - Use **Data Validation** if the sets are predefined; otherwise, allow free text input.
   
   - **Parent Product ID (Column F):**
     - Use **Data Validation** to reference existing **Product IDs** if applicable.

4. **Implement Hierarchical Relationships:**
   - **Parent-Child Links:**
     - For items that are part of a larger product (e.g., Booster Boxes within Sealed Cases), use the **Parent Product ID** to establish relationships.
     - This facilitates tracking sub-components and managing inventory accurately.
   
   - **Formulas for Calculations:**
     - **Total Cost (Column T):**
       ```plaintext
       =IF(J2="", 0, J2 * G2) + IF(L2="", 0, L2) + IF(S2="", 0, S2)
       ```
     - **Revenue Potential (Column U):**
       ```plaintext
       =IF(K2="", 0, K2 * G2)
       ```
     - **Profit (Column V):**
       ```plaintext
       =U2 - T2
       ```
     - Apply these formulas from **Row 2** downwards to auto-calculate values based on inputs.

**Explanation of Example Entries:**

1. **PB-001:**  
   - A **Sealed Case** containing **5 Sealed Cases of Collector Boosters**.
   - Each case contains **24 Booster Boxes**.
   - Total cost and revenue are calculated based on quantity, cost per unit, and selling price.

2. **BP-001 & BP-002:**  
   - **Booster Boxes** belonging to specific sets (e.g., **Modern Horizons 3**, **Shadows Over Innistrad**).
   - Linked to their parent **Sealed Cases** (if applicable).

3. **DE-001:**  
   - A **Pre-constructed Deck** ready for play.
   - Does not contain sub-items, hence **Parent Product ID** is blank.

4. **SA-001:**  
   - A **Special Edition Item** like a **Limited Edition Playmat**.
   - No sub-items, hence **Parent Product ID** is blank.

### **e. Advanced Features for Hierarchical Tracking**

1. **Nested Parent-Child Relationships:**
   - **Sealed Cases → Booster Boxes → Sealed Packs → Individual Cards**
   - **Bundles** can include combinations of any categories, such as **Booster Boxes**, **Pre-constructed Decks**, **Special Edition Items**, etc.

2. **Dynamic Inventory Management:**
   - When a **Sealed Case** is sold, the system should automatically deduct the corresponding **Booster Boxes** and subsequently the **Sealed Packs** and **Individual Cards** if necessary.
   - **Implementation Considerations:**
     - Utilize **Google Apps Script** to handle cascading inventory deductions based on hierarchical relationships.

3. **Comprehensive Reporting:**
   - Generate reports that reflect inventory at all levels (cases, boxes, packs, individual items).
   - Facilitate easy identification of stock levels, reorder needs, and profitability across different categories.

4. **Unique Identifiers:**
   - Assign a **Unique Product ID** to each item for precise tracking and referencing.
   - This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of parent-child relationships.

5. **Batch Operations:**
   - Enable bulk updates for scenarios like receiving new stock, conducting inventory audits, or processing bulk sales.

---

### **f. Implementing the Hierarchical Structure in Google Sheets**

To effectively manage the hierarchical relationships, consider using the following strategies:

1. **Using Separate Sheets for Different Levels:**
   - **Inventory Sheet:** Main sheet with all product entries.
   - **Parent-Child Relationships:** Use formulas or Apps Script to establish and manage relationships.

2. **Formulas for Automatic Deduction:**
   - Use **ARRAYFORMULA**, **VLOOKUP**, or **FILTER** functions to reference and manage related items.

3. **Google Apps Script Enhancements:**
   - Develop scripts that automatically adjust quantities based on hierarchical sales or bundle selections.
   - For example, selling a **Booster Box** should reduce the quantity of the corresponding **Sealed Case** if applicable.

---

### **g. Example Workflow for Selling a Pull Box**

1. **Creating a Pull Box:**
   - Select desired items based on flexibility (e.g., specific sets, types).
   - Confirm and edit the selection before finalizing.

2. **Review and Confirmation:**
   - Preview the selected items.
   - Make necessary adjustments (add/remove items).

3. **Finalizing the Sale:**
   - Approve the pull box.
   - Automatically deduct inventory based on the hierarchical structure.

4. **Generating Reports:**
   - View updated inventory levels.
   - Analyze profitability.

Feel free to ask for any clarifications or further customizations as needed!

[2024-09-26 15:56:28] FoSGamers:
SKU will not be added now, or like a QR code will not be added now. Those things will be added later on for tracking and stuff like that.

[2024-09-26 15:57:38] ChatGPT:
Jamey has clarified that SKU and QR codes for tracking will not be added now and will be considered for future additions.

[2024-09-26 15:57:38] FoSGamers:
Model set context updated.

[2024-09-26 15:57:38] ChatGPT:
Got it! Based on that, I'll proceed without including SKU or QR code fields in **Stage 1**. I'll ensure the current system is flexible enough so that when you're ready to add SKU or QR code tracking in the future, it can be integrated without breaking anything.

Here is the updated **Stage 1** without SKU or QR code integration for now. Let me know if you're satisfied with this, and we can move forward to **Stage 2**.

   - Rename the first sheet/tab to **"Inventory"**.

2. **Define Columns:**
   - In the **"Inventory"** sheet, set up the columns as outlined in **Section b** above (Columns A to V).

3. **Apply Data Validation and Formatting:**
   - **Product Category (Column B):**
     - Use **Data Validation** to create a dropdown list of all possible categories (Individual Card, Sealed Pack, Booster Box, Bundle, Pre-constructed Deck, Special Edition Item, Sealed Case, Accessories).
   
   - **Trading Card Game (Column C):**
     - Similarly, use **Data Validation** for consistent TCG entries (Magic: The Gathering, Sorcery, etc.).
   
   - **Set Name (Column D):**
     - Use **Data Validation** if the sets are predefined; otherwise, allow free text input.

   - **Parent Product ID (Column F):**
     - Use **Data Validation** to reference existing **Product IDs** if applicable.

4. **Implement Hierarchical Relationships:**
   - **Parent-Child Links:**
     - For items that are part of a larger product (e.g., Booster Boxes within Sealed Cases), use the **Parent Product ID** to establish relationships.
     - This facilitates tracking sub-components and managing inventory accurately.
   
   - **Formulas for Calculations:**
     - **Total Cost (Column T):**
       ```plaintext
       =IF(J2="", 0, J2 * G2) + IF(L2="", 0, L2) + IF(S2="", 0, S2)
       ```
     - **Revenue Potential (Column U):**
       ```plaintext
       =IF(K2="", 0, K2 * G2)
       ```
     - **Profit (Column V):**
       ```plaintext
       =U2 - T2
       ```

5. **Conditional Formatting:**
   - **Low Inventory Alerts:**
     - Highlight items where **Quantity (Column G)** is below **Reorder Level (Column H)**.
     - **How to Apply:**
       1. Select Column **G**.
       2. Go to **Format** > **Conditional formatting**.
       3. Under **Format rules**, choose **Custom formula is**.
       4. Enter the formula:
          ```plaintext
          =G2 < H2
          ```
       5. Choose a **red fill color** or other highlighting style.
       6. Click **Done**.

6. **Protect Critical Columns:**
   - **Columns A to V** contain essential data and formulas.
   - **How to Protect:**
     1. Select the entire sheet or specific columns (A to V).
     2. Right-click and choose **Protect range**.
     3. In the sidebar, click **"Set permissions"**.
     4. Choose **"Restrict who can edit this range"** and assign permissions (e.g., only you can edit).
     5. Click **"Done"**.

For the booster box types, just so you're aware, there are multiple ones. There are Collective Boosters boxes. There are Play Booster boxes. There are Set Booster boxes. There are Draft Booster boxes. There are Jumpstart Booster boxes. And we'll go with Vintage Booster boxes, since that'll kind of hold categories of things that are older and don't fall within those current categories that I've provided you. And allow me to update this whenever I want, because new things come out on a regular basis and that type of stuff on how they do things, on how they build things. And same thing with the pre-constructed decks. I should be able to, like, sometimes they have commander decks, sometimes they're starter decks, sometimes they're set-based decks, all kinds of stuff. So I should be able to update those and add new things as needed, too. That's the modularization of this whole thing. And those would be, like, a sealed case would be, like, a multiple of, like, a booster boxes of some kind, or multiples even of decks, of sealed decks, that type of thing. Or even multiple specialty items, or multiple cases of accessories and stuff like that, or multiple cases of any type of sealed product or that type of thing. And with the individual cards, I should even be able to put quantity in there, because sometimes I have more than one of an individual card.

Jamey clarified that booster box types include Collector Booster boxes, Play Booster boxes, Set Booster boxes, Draft Booster boxes, Jumpstart Booster boxes, and Vintage Booster boxes. They also mentioned that pre-constructed decks can include Commander decks, Starter decks, set-based decks, and more. Jamey should be able to update the inventory system whenever new items or categories are released. Sealed cases can include multiples of booster boxes, decks, specialty items, or accessories. Jamey also wants to track the quantity of individual cards, as they sometimes have more than one copy of a card.

Because what I need you to do is, I need you to thoroughly understand what we are building here. And then generate me the first part of it through the table of contents. I'll let you know if anything there needs to be adjusted, then after that I'll tell you, then we'll go on to stage 1, then I'll tell you we'll go on to stage 2, so on and so forth.

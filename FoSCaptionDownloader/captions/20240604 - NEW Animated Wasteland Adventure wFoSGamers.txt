[00:25:31] your laser thing it gives you a little
[00:25:32] bit more in a little bit more of your
[00:25:34] strength so we use our knife against it
[00:25:36] you use that knife and
[00:25:39] wow we move forward on and nice you hit
[00:25:43] the feral ghoul for a
[00:25:47] nice hit that feral ghoul you use your
[00:25:51] knife that you found you stab that feral
[00:25:56] ghoul in the shoulder
[00:25:58] that feral ghoul goes screeching
[00:26:01] away but in that process feral ghoul
[00:26:05] drops a loot box it's one of these here

[00:44:58] for that assault rifle so now you are
[00:45:01] fully
[00:45:02] loaded as you wander through this
[00:45:04] Wasteland as the engineer you have an
[00:45:06] assault rifle strapped on your back your
[00:45:08] laser pistol on your belt you got some
[00:45:11] engineering and intelligence booster
[00:45:12] ready to use believe you do also
[00:45:17] have a health
[00:45:19] booster your health pack so what are we
[00:45:23] going to do everybody we're wandering
[00:45:25] further through this Wasteland and all
[00:45:27] of a sudden in front of you oh
[00:45:30] no we had to start over again so we're
[00:45:32] back against our weedling boss what are
[00:45:35] we going to do with our weedling do we
[00:45:36] use our assault
[00:45:38] rifle do we use our laser
[00:45:42] pistol we're trying to figure out what
[00:45:44] to
[00:45:48] do generally it's a good ide laser
[00:45:50] pistol oh laser pistol it up we're going
[00:45:53] to laser pistol it we go with a laser
[00:45:56] pistol so you know what I think we need
[00:45:58] to do a health pack here because we lost
[00:46:01] a little Health in the last encounter so
[00:46:03] I'm going to throw a health pack in
[00:46:04] there so we do the health pack and the
[00:46:06] laser pistol and you hit him for oh nice
[00:46:09] seven damage that Wheeling gets shot
[00:46:13] right in the shoulder oh my shoulder you
[00:46:16] hear a
[00:46:17] screech goes running away scared because
[00:46:20] you hit it so hard but then it turns
[00:46:22] around because you thought it was going
[00:46:23] to run it was a
[00:46:25] trick he's coming back towards you
[00:46:27] because he hits you with his own Vine
[00:46:29] for three damage bring you down to
[00:46:32] 117 now you've got another chance what
[00:46:35] do we do here do we want to use
[00:46:36] something from our inventory or do we
[00:46:38] want to shoot attack again with what we
[00:46:42] have it is up to you what we do here
[00:46:46] against our
[00:46:52] weeding attack we're going to attack
[00:46:54] with what we have we're not making any
[00:46:56] changes we attack with what we have oh
[00:46:59] by the boss this time
[00:47:02] rolled 16 to defend but you on the other
[00:47:05] hand you roll the 12 against there four
[00:47:08] and you hit them hard nice and
[00:47:11] big for oh no it was only one I thought
[00:47:14] that was 10 my glasses are not helping
[00:47:17] me see right now but you you're going on
[00:47:19] to the weeding you still fighting you
[00:47:22] hit that with the laser pistol get one
[00:47:24] more tack here what are you going to do
[00:47:27] do do we want to continue we going to
[00:47:28] attack again I think we're going to just
[00:47:30] try attacking again let's do an attack
[00:47:33] again you hit that weeding the weeding
[00:47:37] goes screeching
[00:47:40] away screeching away and as that weeding
[00:47:43] screeches away you're able to wander
[00:47:46] wild and go oh finally safety nothing
[00:47:49] going on and it is now your up to you to
[00:47:53] see what we do next we're going to a
[00:47:55] pull from oh our Delux box and we're
[00:47:57] only going at one of them where are we
[00:47:59] going to go in our Deluxe box again oh
[00:48:01] no that's not our Deluxe yeah it was six
[00:48:02] it was on six I knocked that over from
[00:48:04] six didn't I thought that was on six
[00:48:07] we're going to our Deluxe box there
[00:48:08] where are we going in our Deluxe any you
[00:48:10] want to give me a
[00:48:11] number number
[00:48:14] six one two three four five and six that
[00:48:19] would have been our thing which would
[00:48:20] have been an ioria Japanese collector
[00:48:22] booster and a large health pack oo
[00:48:24] that's nice we need health packs we just
[00:48:26] been hit pretty good there so Health
[00:48:28] packs are definitely going to be be good
[00:48:30] for us right
[00:48:31] now sweet got yourself a health pack
[00:48:35] that's very helpful very helpful and I
[00:48:39] say we're going to continue on and oh no
[00:48:42] as you continue on after that you see a
[00:48:44] feral
[00:48:46] Ghoul Now what are we going to do you
[00:48:48] have a strength booster a critical hit
[00:48:50] amulet an assault rifle a large health
[00:48:54] pack
[00:48:57] I told you that trying to get people to
[00:48:59] purchase boxes here because the boxes
[00:49:01] will help them uh each one of these they
[00:49:03] get packs or whatever in the box and yes
[00:49:06] it has evolved a little bit has evolved
[00:49:08] a little bit it's a different version I
[00:49:10] know I um you know the I did the the one
[00:49:12] without the animations and all that I
[00:49:14] made it a little bit easier to move
[00:49:15] faster with you guys here instead
[00:49:18] instead of the long one yeah so it would
[00:49:20] evolve that did evolve I was off of work
[00:49:22] off of this for a little while just cuz
[00:49:23] work being a pain in the ass and had to
[00:49:25] focus on something so so I literally I
[00:49:27] actually built a game a walks through
[00:49:30] walks you through all of this actually
[00:49:32] that's why you keep seeing me type
[00:49:33] because it automatically tells me what
[00:49:35] uh what character you're going to go to
[00:49:36] you're the boss and all that your and
[00:49:38] your health tracks all that for me so I
[00:49:40] don't need to keep remembering it that's
[00:49:41] why that's why uh built literally just a
[00:49:44] little text game python based python
[00:49:47] text game for it but
[00:49:50] anyways anyways we're going to continue
[00:49:54] on right we're going to continue on we
[00:49:56] have a pheral
[00:49:57] go we don't know what to do against our
[00:49:59] feral gohou we have some things in our
[00:50:00] inventory we have a strength
[00:50:04] booster we have a critical attack
[00:50:07] amulet we have the assault
[00:50:09] rifle we have an intelligence
[00:50:12] booster and currently we do have a large
[00:50:15] health
[00:50:16] pack do you want to do anything to help
[00:50:18] our character do you think we should I
[00:50:21] mean they're at 117 Health they normally
[00:50:23] at 130 as they're high so we could add
[00:50:25] some health but it's not going to do the
[00:50:27] full amount because it's only 15 so
[00:50:29] maybe we wait and what we think we use a
[00:50:31] feral ghoul we use an intelligence
[00:50:33] booster to help us we use our uh anybody
[00:50:36] else no any assistance intelligence
[00:50:39] booster and uh maybe the assault rifle I
[00:50:42] say we use the intelligence booster and
[00:50:44] the assault
[00:50:45] rifle yes and then we will
[00:50:51] attack and we
[00:50:55] attack you attack
[00:50:57] the assault rifle you shoot that assault
[00:50:59] rifle using your intelligence booster
[00:51:02] for this round and you hit that feral
[00:51:05] ghoul with a nice Direct Hit to its
[00:51:07] chest that feral ghoul Falls
[00:51:10] over
[00:51:13] dead
[00:51:16] wonderful because of that he doesn't
[00:51:18] even get a chance to attack you and
[00:51:20] you're still at 117 Health that was a
[00:51:23] perfect hit nice idea with the attacking
[00:51:26] and good job with the intelligence
[00:51:27] booster to be able to get a good shot
[00:51:29] aim better well look at that you aim
[00:51:31] better because you use the intelligence
[00:51:32] booster and then direct hdden he's dead
[00:51:36] now now we're going on let's see it's up
[00:51:39] to you guys what we're going to do here
[00:51:40] remember you can purchase our boxes
[00:51:42] doesn't have to be me and you can
[00:51:43] participate in the game so we're going
[00:51:45] with six going the deluxe again and one
[00:51:49] out of the deluxe we keep going with the
[00:51:50] deluxe box here so I guess let's see
[00:51:52] what happens anybody want to give me a
[00:51:54] number to see what we get for our from
[00:51:56] our Deluxe pull box here as we continue
[00:51:59] through our
[00:52:01] game number two let's do number two here
[00:52:06] number two if you had played and you had
[00:52:07] jumped in you bought the deluxe pole box
[00:52:09] you would have gotten a lost caverns of
[00:52:10] aelon collector booster then yourself an
[00:52:13] intelligence booster right here nice an
[00:52:15] intelligence booster we like
[00:52:17] intelligence boosters those helped out a
[00:52:20] lot in that last one to direct where
[00:52:21] you're going so we're going to get
[00:52:24] another one of those
[00:52:27] let's get that intelligence booster we
[00:52:30] continue on you're wandering through
[00:52:31] that was you're looking around going oh
[00:52:33] wonderful take a look at your inventory
[00:52:35] you go I got a strength booster that's
[00:52:38] going to help out a lot I got a critical
[00:52:40] hit I probably should use that when a
[00:52:41] boss is around that's probably a good
[00:52:42] idea got myself an assault rifle with
[00:52:45] some ammo because I I picked up two of
[00:52:47] them I took the ammo from the other do
[00:52:49] have a large health pack if anybody want
[00:52:51] to help me
[00:52:52] there and then I did pick up another
[00:52:54] intelligence look at that
[00:52:57] now remember any of you can jump in
[00:53:01] participate so I say we're going to have
[00:53:04] to use something
[00:53:07] here I say we gonna have to use uh
[00:53:10] you're going against Oh no you're
[00:53:12] starting to look down and you see from
[00:53:13] the engineer you look up and you see oh
[00:53:17] my there is a medium
[00:53:20] Raider that mediumsized Raider is here
[00:53:23] what are you going to do
[00:53:30] anyone in chat want to help
[00:53:35] no well I might be done here in a little
[00:53:38] while here because I did finish up my
[00:53:40] work stuff earlier yet this morning I
[00:53:43] actually did a lot of research I have to
[00:53:44] find some uh programs I think I overdid
[00:53:47] it I think I did I probably should have
[00:53:48] only done like three to five and I did
[00:53:50] like
[00:53:52] 15 but I found a couple websites that
[00:53:54] gave me some information on a bunch of
[00:53:56] them and then I combined it and [ __ ]
[00:53:57] whatever whatever H off topic off topic
[00:54:00] all right we have our medium Raider
[00:54:03] we're going to do
[00:54:05] that and I'm going to go
[00:54:08] with I say we use our assault
[00:54:13] rifle against this medium
[00:54:16] Raider and I say we use he's a big
[00:54:19] looking
[00:54:23] guy hey I understand that sometimes that
[00:54:26] happens
[00:54:27] get your mind going right for the stream
[00:54:29] you got and get things running so your
[00:54:30] brain can function right that's why I
[00:54:32] couldn't do stuff for a while my brain
[00:54:33] just wasn't functioning it was so
[00:54:34] scattered all over the place I didn't
[00:54:35] know what was going on half the time all
[00:54:38] right we're going to use actually one of
[00:54:39] our uh I think we're going to use our
[00:54:42] strength booster on top of it right
[00:54:44] that's what we're gonna do we're going
[00:54:46] to attack that mediumsized
[00:54:48] Raider oh nice yeah I generally do a lot
[00:54:51] of streaming in a row but I had just had

[00:58:35] rifle that large bug is hit directly in
[00:58:39] the head
[00:58:42] wonderful and as it gets
[00:58:47] hit it falls to the
[00:58:50] ground leaving you with
[00:58:56] an ultimate box and one pull from it who
[00:58:59] ha is going to jump in and purchase any
[00:59:00] of our boxes remember they're all in the
[00:59:02] buy now we're just playing our game

[00:59:47] here waiting for someone to jump in and
[00:59:49] rip some
[00:59:50] packs we're getting to our our end here
[00:59:53] now we have our assault rifle we're w we
[00:59:55] got a critical amet you're going further
[00:59:57] through this way and oh no the corrupted
[01:00:00] weedling comes out in front of
[01:00:04] you what do we do we have a bunch of
[01:00:07] things to attack
[01:00:09] with we

[01:00:19] there we have our critical amulet we
[01:00:23] have a health pack we have our assault
[01:00:25] rifle you know what I think we should
[01:00:26] use a critical hit amulet probably a
[01:00:28] good idea
[01:00:31] huh I say we use our critical hit
[01:00:37] amulet probably a good idea going up
[01:00:40] against the big baddy so we go up
[01:00:42] against the big baddy we hit the big
[01:00:43] baddy you hit you swing at
[01:00:47] him you hit
[01:00:50] him nice you
[01:00:52] shoot with your assault rifle
[01:00:56] you hit that corrupted weedling that
[01:00:59] corrupted weeding drops a little bit of
[01:01:00] your assault rifle ammo because you're
[01:01:02] getting a little wonderful you're lucky
[01:01:05] there almost getting out of
[01:01:07] it
[01:01:09] now the assault rifle I mean the
[01:01:12] Wheeling swings at you though corrupted
[01:01:14] Wheeling swings at
[01:01:16] you and oh no he hits you for five
[01:01:21] damage not a lot but a little enough to
[01:01:23] bring you down and as you continue
[01:01:25] through through this Wasteland something
[01:01:28] happens this corrupted weeding you
[01:01:30] thought he was going to run away because
[01:01:31] you shot him but
[01:01:34] no you have another chance should we use
[01:01:37] anything else for in our ammo and our
[01:01:40] thing should we use any uh change our
[01:01:43] weapon or should we leave it as the uh
[01:01:45] the assault
[01:01:51] rifle currently it is an assault rifle
[01:01:53] as our weapon
[01:01:57] probably need to continue on laser
[01:02:00] pistol all right we switch to the laser
[01:02:01] pistol we go back to that laser
[01:02:05] pistol
[01:02:09] and you hit that corrupt weedling Square
[01:02:13] in the
[01:02:15] face oh that corrupt weedling now has a
[01:02:18] burn on its face but it starts to heal
[01:02:20] being so quickly being a Vine that can
[01:02:23] heal like that he's mad at you now he's
[01:02:26] washes out with his Vines hitting you
[01:02:28] for 12 damage oh no the engineer is
[01:02:31] injured now is down to 93 Health 92
[01:02:36] Health what are we gonna
[01:02:38] do got something else to do here should
[01:02:42] you attack should you use something in
[01:02:43] your ammo I think it's probably a good
[01:02:44] idea to use one of your health packs
[01:02:47] now get your health pack up and then
[01:02:49] maybe use one of your intelligence
[01:02:53] boosters say maybe intelligence booster
[01:02:55] and health pack get things up and
[01:02:59] running yeah health and intelligence
[01:03:01] let's do it throw some health in
[01:03:10] there and
[01:03:13] intelligence there we
[01:03:16] go you use that you shoot your your
[01:03:19] assault
[01:03:21] rifle hitting it
[01:03:24] directly in the chest
[01:03:27] that Wheeling Kels over to the ground
[01:03:32] dead
[01:03:34] wonderful that intelligent engineer is
[01:03:36] able to go over now and loot it what are
[01:03:38] we going to
[01:03:46] do oh
[01:03:53] yeah I say we're going to have to check
[01:03:55] one of those loot boxes there let's see
[01:03:57] what we
[01:03:59] get oh it's in the ultimate and you're
[01:04:01] only going to get one out of it let's
[01:04:03] see the if few play participated you

[01:05:21] Raider
[01:05:26] large Raider is directly hit in the face
[01:05:29] oh my because you have some engineering
[01:05:30] that gives you an extra on your beable
[01:05:32] intelligence oh my look at that you're
[01:05:34] smarter you're able to aim better and

[01:12:04] hold them mugon how you doing so all
[01:12:07] right no one wanted to do anything we're

[01:12:18] getting a modern Horizon 2 with a set
[01:12:20] modern Horizon 2 set and Agility booster
[01:12:22] oh I like that and an agility booster
[01:12:26] that's what you got got there it's rainy
[01:12:28] day for you ah that
[01:12:29] stinks but hey that means you get stuff
[01:12:32] done in the house
[01:12:33] though so you have an agility booster
[01:12:36] you're wandering further through this
[01:12:38] Wasteland and you
[01:12:40] encounter another feral
[01:12:44] ghoul what are we going to do as this
[01:12:46] intelligent
[01:12:48] engineer you have a plasma rifle an
[01:12:51] assault rifle you have a critical hit
[01:12:55] you have the health I mean
[01:12:58] agility and I believe you have the
[01:13:00] strength
[01:13:03] too the
[01:13:04] strength what are we gonna
[01:13:07] do do we want to use one I don't know if
[01:13:11] we can do that he can't do that though
[01:13:13] but what he can do is attack it I think
[01:13:16] we're going to put some plasma I think
[01:13:18] we're GNA use some plasma and I think
[01:13:20] this time
[01:13:25] this time we're also going to try a
[01:13:28] critical
[01:13:30] hit we want to make sure we do good with
[01:13:32] that we don't want that feral ghoul
[01:13:34] doing anything else use that plasma
[01:13:36] rifle use that critical hit and
[01:13:40] boom critical hit has a 20% chance of
[01:13:43] direct of a of an instant death and you
[01:13:47] did it oh wonderful doesn't happen
[01:13:49] frequently critical hit you killed that
[01:13:52] blow a hole with your plasma rifle
[01:13:54] directly through its chest that was an
[01:13:57] easy
[01:14:00] one you continue on
[01:14:03] and the next thing that happens
[01:14:07] is you have the option and there's a box
[01:14:09] on the ground here which one are you
[01:14:10] going to go with my friends now you can
[01:14:12] help me finish our adventure we're
[01:14:14] getting to the
[01:14:17] end so I think you seen the
[01:14:22] distance we're going to go to the uh
[01:14:25] Deluxe pull pull box and do number
[01:14:28] one if that is uh and do one out of them
[01:14:32] take one out of them if that's here no
[01:14:34] one's do anything not that for premium
[01:14:36] and then we're going to take one out of
[01:14:37] it let's see what happens here
[01:14:40] everyone hopefully we'll have a good
[01:14:43] time finish our game here we'll see what
[01:14:45] happens no one's doing anything fine
[01:14:48] we'll get one out of here I'm going to
[01:14:50] grab a random one from the
[01:14:52] back this is a lost C Exon sat an
[01:14:55] intelligence booster that's what you
[01:14:56] would have gotten there o we like
[01:15:02] it do that now remember everybody you
[01:15:05] can help participate in the game by
[01:15:07] jumping
[01:15:08] in so you have an intelligence booster
[01:15:11] you had that stuff and you run
[01:15:13] into another large bug oh no this is the
[01:15:18] last thing before we get to
[01:15:21] our Moss I believe you run into a large
[01:15:24] bug
[01:15:25] oh
[01:15:26] my what are you going to do you
[01:15:29] have a critical
[01:15:32] hit you have a small health pack you
[01:15:36] have an intelligence booster you have a
[01:15:39] plasma rifle you have an assault
[01:15:44] rifle and I believe you do also have an
[01:15:46] agility booster should we use any of
[01:15:48] those against our large bug

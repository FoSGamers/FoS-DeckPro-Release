[00:08:09] k e thank you my friend B I don't know
[00:08:16] can you tell me what that's supposed to
[00:08:18] be now I have some of these that we have
[00:08:21] from our packs that we've had left over
[00:08:23] we debating on opening we also have some
[00:08:25] of these that we had left over that we
[00:08:27] debating on opening
[00:08:29] so I don't know if I should open the
[00:08:32] dust more I'm G open one of these first
[00:08:34] and then we're going to go to The
[00:08:35] Collector that's what we'll do what do
[00:08:38] you guys think uh we got going on here
[00:08:39] today remember we have a lot of fun we
[00:08:41] have our adventure here it's a fun one
[00:08:44] to participate
[00:08:46] with Marvel air controversy Adam well I
[00:08:50] will tell you this I was not a fan of
[00:08:52] how they handled it um I also think that
[00:08:56] there um the fact that there was a
[00:08:58] glitch of some kind found and people
[00:08:59] exploited that um shows the immoral
[00:09:03] people in this world the amount of them
[00:09:04] there are um I in controversy wise I
[00:09:07] would say they um I think this is a good
[00:09:09] example of why to do print to demand um
[00:09:13] but at the same time um their company
[00:09:15] that needs to make money so they want to
[00:09:16] make it at the highest possible but
[00:09:18] that's I think they'd want to do print
[00:09:19] to demand but anyways I I think
[00:09:23] personally um if it wasn't for the
[00:09:26] glitch issue there wouldn't have been a
[00:09:28] problem really people would have been in
[00:09:29] there trying to get stuff maybe not have
[00:09:31] gotten everything they wanted because
[00:09:32] they didn't get in there right away but
[00:09:34] I do think um the way they allow people
[00:09:36] to have multiple accounts they should be
[00:09:38] able to track something to figure out
[00:09:39] that they can't have multiple things
[00:09:41] like I for instance like um like I went
[00:09:43] in under my wives account to see what
[00:09:45] was available um after and they were all
[00:09:48] sold out within like 10 seconds and I'm
[00:09:51] like what the hell
[00:09:53] one so it's like you got to figure out
[00:09:55] what's going on there these are in the
[00:09:56] right order by the way look at that one
[00:10:00] what was the front pack of The Collector
[00:10:02] hold on I'm not sure what you're talking
[00:10:03] about flesh borrower unable to scream
[00:10:07] fear of immobility hand that feeds
[00:10:10] Winter's intervention Trapped In The
[00:10:11] Stream twist reality break down the door
[00:10:15] vile mutilator diversion specialist we
[00:10:18] have a smoky Lounge Misty Saloon that's
[00:10:21] a nice pickup o Jolly Balloon Man there

[00:19:37] putting me on the slow right now so if
[00:19:39] you guys are having a hard time finding
[00:19:40] me it's because I near one of the other
[00:19:43] um one of the other milestones and it
[00:19:45] seems like whenever you get near a
[00:19:46] milestone they do not do anything other
[00:19:48] than make sure the only people that are
[00:19:50] involved would be like people that might

[00:36:22] after a mediumsized Raider is what you
[00:36:24] see in front of you and all of a sudden
[00:36:26] you'd be ATT in a medium siiz Raider as
[00:36:29] the adventurer walking into this Vault
[00:36:31] and you need to know what you're going
[00:36:32] to do it's a little fun game kind of
[00:36:35] that we play but what I'll do here is
[00:36:36] we're going to start it off for a
[00:36:38] discount now you're going to guarantee
[00:36:40] yourself a pack of cards out of one out
[00:36:42] of this we're going with number box
[00:36:44] number one guarantees a pack of cards
[00:36:46] which is going to be bloomo murders lost
[00:36:48] Caverns or ex ioria whatever your choice
[00:36:51] is but if you want to uh play the game
[00:36:55] you get to choose come in and become the
[00:36:56] character and go through the game play a
[00:36:58] little
[00:36:59] adventure with us there you go let me
[00:37:03] get that on your night
[00:37:07] bear B 20 there you go my friend and let
[00:37:12] me put you in a bag over here now once
[00:37:16] you get your character and your
[00:37:17] adventure you get to go on and uh have
[00:37:20] some fun maybe you don't want to do that
[00:37:23] one though maybe you don't want to spend
[00:37:24] a bunch of money you just want to try to
[00:37:26] have some fun playing playing a game
[00:37:28] little Adventure game with us you can do
[00:37:30] that also we do have this too here for
[00:37:32] people that want I made this for those
[00:37:34] um had requested it actually so we have
[00:37:37] this the just literally the pull box are
[00:37:40] basically doing the adventure and what
[00:37:42] the adventure does it's the same thing
[00:37:45] but the only difference is is it's a
[00:37:47] onetime used stuff where you can't like
[00:37:48] take things over and over but it's in
[00:37:50] this box here in same concept but the
[00:37:52] only difference is there only one pack
[00:37:53] that says um one card that says a pack
[00:37:56] the rest of them just say part The
[00:37:57] Adventure on there so for instance you
[00:37:59] would have ran into a small Raider that
[00:38:00] time that wouldn't have been good had a
[00:38:03] small Raider in front of you you would
[00:38:04] need to decide what to
[00:38:06] do but anyways we'll keep uh having some
[00:38:09] fun here that's where we built our our
[00:38:11] Dice Tower for CU people had said you
[00:38:13] knew you needed a dice tower to get
[00:38:15] things rolling better so we built that
[00:38:16] Dice Tower here on the side just out of

[00:53:42] see light white borders are nice I have
[00:53:45] to admit the white bers are nice I just
[00:53:47] don't have enough I have so much cards I
[00:53:48] can't bring them all on a boat you know
[00:53:49] what I mean so I have to get rid of
[00:53:51] things I have to pick and choose what I
[00:53:52] can keep with me I can't have everything
[00:53:54] I would love to but I can't I only have
[00:53:56] limited amount of space you know about
[00:53:58] to get rid of stuff which is what we're
[00:54:00] trying to do slim down here which why we
[00:54:02] did uh we're doing the sales with the
[00:54:03] secret layer that you've been
[00:54:05] seeing yeah see yeah yeah exactly cage
[00:54:08] you know you you understand all right
[00:54:11] cage let me put you in a bag here with

[00:54:30] of
[00:54:37] Summer veil of Summer mystery booster
[00:54:42] now this one will throw out for $6
[00:54:45] instead of the seven that you see
[00:54:49] there um the stuff from yesterday has
[00:54:51] not shipped yet no but I did have to
[00:54:54] pack it up though it's going to be
[00:54:55] dropped in the pop most off it's like
[00:54:57] today why I can't put everything
[00:54:59] together the way they bundle stuff it
[00:55:01] doesn't allow me to bundle between shows
[00:55:02] it's only in one show that I'm allowed
[00:55:04] to do it that's the thing that sucks but
[00:55:06] if you um but I'm pretty sure yours have
[00:55:08] now a tracking label one um so you'll be
[00:55:11] able to do it with a tracking with these
[00:55:16] cards oh now close to the cape yeah I
[00:55:20] understand that one I am um I used to go
[00:55:22] down that way let me take these out I
[00:55:25] used to go down that way regularly um
[00:55:27] like once a year kind of for um like
[00:55:29] trips and stuff like that but I don't do
[00:55:31] that
[00:55:36] anymore obviously I'm in Florida so it's
[00:55:38] it's a little bit harder for me to get
[00:55:39] down
[00:55:42] there do a little pre-ordained for
[00:55:46] you that's almost a $3 card we're
[00:55:48] throwing out for
[00:55:49] two but uh we'll probably be up in that
[00:55:52] area with the boat anyways for a little
[00:55:53] while we figure we'll be there for a few
[00:55:55] months through the summer because we
[00:55:57] have to be there for the first year of
[00:55:58] Hurricane Season at
[00:56:05] least King I like it King put this down

[00:57:09] don't see what I try to do is when I put

[01:00:26] the saying I say all the time Rising
[01:00:28] tide raise All Ships all boats if we
[01:00:30] help each other we're all going to do
[01:00:31] better in some way shape or form so I
[01:00:33] don't mind helping when I can I can't
[01:00:35] guarantee I can always help but I like
[01:00:36] to help when I can if that makes
[01:00:39] sense so we're going to put out a uh lay
[01:00:42] line of the
[01:00:51] Void L line of the
[01:00:54] Void it is this
[01:00:55] [Music]
[01:00:59] verion I thought that was over oh must
[01:01:02] dropped that dropped
[01:01:06] it we'll go with unstoppable
[01:01:15] slasher this one is

[01:01:22] is $5 $6 is so throw up for five
[01:01:28] that's fine with me not a problem at all
[01:01:30] September I don't mind doing that ever
[01:01:33] that's why I say I don't mind helping
[01:01:34] people whenever I can I can't guarantee
[01:01:35] I'm going to but um I I'm going to be
[01:01:38] able to or I can't believe guarantee I'm
[01:01:40] going to have the time always but I will
[01:01:41] when I
[01:01:42] can not a
[01:01:44] problem that's one of those things like
[01:01:46] I try to tell everybody like I explain
[01:01:47] to my kids you don't need to be helping
[01:01:49] every every single day doing something
[01:01:51] to be considered to do something helpful
[01:01:53] and be good you can do that it you could
[01:01:55] be like that random time where you're
[01:01:57] going down the road and you see you know
[01:01:58] there's a person outside the road that
[01:01:59] has is hungry you like [ __ ] I had two
[01:02:01] sandwiches today you know what I can
[01:02:02] have one and you handed that person
[01:02:04] that's the extra thing you can do it's
[01:02:06] not a lot not a big thing but it's the
[01:02:08] extra thing you can do you can't do it
[01:02:10] maybe all the time maybe one day you
[01:02:11] don't have that much that you can do
[01:02:13] that but the point is just help when you
[01:02:15] can and sometimes I have time that I can
[01:02:17] help people so I like to do that because
[01:02:20] if you don't do it yourself how can the
[01:02:22] world in itself can how can you think
[01:02:24] the world in in of itself will do the
[01:02:26] same thing there'll ever be that way you
[01:02:29] have to show with your actions that's
[01:02:32] why I try to tell everyone all my kids
[01:02:34] all the time show them with your actions
[01:02:35] and what you do so that's what I try to
[01:02:37] can't like can't guarantee I can always
[01:02:39] but I will do what I
[01:02:40] can this is a $3 card we'll throw it out
[01:02:44] for uh why not $2

[01:03:17] this let's do this
[01:03:29] Marvin murderous
[01:03:35] mimic oh I have it in that version
[01:03:37] already there well look at that that is
[01:03:40] a $7 card will throw out for
[01:03:43] six this is foil this is a foil correct
[01:03:47] this is
[01:03:49] foil that is the foil
[01:03:53] version there you go that's about a 7
[01:03:56] card we threw on there for six for you
[01:03:57] guys there's your little star for your

[01:04:05] caged let me get you your card over
[01:04:10] here put them in with your other
[01:04:13] stuff there you go
[01:04:17] caged all with your others
[01:04:30] you're oh you bought one from another
[01:04:32] hey I'm sorry about that hey you know
[01:04:34] what I'm just going to let you know
[01:04:35] sometimes the mail unless they didn't
[01:04:37] ship it sometimes mail is just a piece
[01:04:39] of [ __ ] and they don't get it to people
[01:04:41] and it makes you look like a bad person
[01:04:42] even though you're doing things right
[01:04:44] like for me I had during um when the
[01:04:48] hurricane I had a bunch of things return
[01:04:50] and some of them had the labels were
[01:04:52] either covered completely I couldn't
[01:04:53] read them and they didn't have stuff
[01:04:54] inside cuz normally don't put a tra
[01:04:56] packing label if it's like a giveaway or
[01:04:57] something cuz that's extra stuff for me
[01:04:59] to pay for and I I don't even want to
[01:05:00] pay for that on a giveaway I know it
[01:05:02] sounds and so when I got
[01:05:05] it yeah not a problem I can look at that
[01:05:08] so when I get something back I don't
[01:05:09] always see who it is I'm like hey guys
[01:05:10] if you haven't gotten something let me
[01:05:11] know and every now and again you get
[01:05:13] somebody like yells at you on on chat
[01:05:14] like I never got this like well I said
[01:05:16] that all the time like I got returns I
[01:05:18] can even show actually one of I think
[01:05:20] I've been packing them up and tearing
[01:05:21] them open trying to see where they are
[01:05:22] but they all got the labels ruined so
[01:05:25] how am I supposed to know who they are I
[01:05:27] do my best but it came back this way
[01:05:30] because like I said there was just
[01:05:32] during the hurricane I think people just
[01:05:33] a lot of things happen and things got
[01:05:35] ruined a little bit the packages stuff
[01:05:36] will team cards were fine on the inside
[01:05:38] but the outside of the package was a
[01:05:40] little bit scuffed up and
[01:05:46] stuff oh they always know who it's from
[01:05:49] it says the name of my um thing on it it
[01:05:51] says F Gamers is it comes from fos
[01:05:54] Gamers so they know who it's coming from
[01:05:55] and they always get a sticker from me
[01:05:56] too crimson and it says Fest Gamers you
[01:05:58] get a sticker with an FS gamer sticker
[01:06:00] so you're always gonna know who it's
[01:06:01] coming
[01:06:04] from why did this
[01:06:06] run $3 and3
[01:06:09] 371 instead of four I mean for the
[01:06:13] foil yeah so people will always know who
[01:06:16] it is because it says on the slip fos
[01:06:18] Gamers is where it's coming
[01:06:22] from that you see on the label and it
[01:06:24] also has a sticker in there
[01:06:27] too oh wow that sucks I'm sorry buddy
[01:06:30] hey you know what that's when you got to
[01:06:31] just re ask for a refund I've done I've
[01:06:34] had a couple people ask for for me
[01:06:35] before and I I'm like I'll do what I can
[01:06:37] I can't guarantee I'm always going to
[01:06:39] solve things for you but we'll do what
[01:06:41] we can here

[01:07:50] thing and then they they'll jump on it
[01:07:52] then and I I mean I for me I've had
[01:07:54] people do it before too I'm like I can't
[01:07:56] help you if I like I'm sorry I'm not
[01:07:57] trying to like be mean not trying to
[01:07:59] screw you but like I need to know what's
[01:08:00] going on like somebody responded to me
[01:08:02] said you didn't send something out to my
[01:08:04] uh like a I didn't get a giveaway from
[01:08:06] you my brother didn't get a giveaway
[01:08:07] from you I'm like all right who who is
[01:08:08] your brother what's their name like I
[01:08:09] need some information so I can figure
[01:08:11] out what's going on and I'm like and I
[01:08:13] never got a response back so I'm like I
[01:08:15] don't know who you're talking
[01:08:17] about I can't
[01:08:22] help all right let's put a bab off oh
[01:08:26] maybe want a
[01:08:33] bagabo vabo terror eater right there for
[01:08:36] you market
[01:08:40] price but I'm I mean like I said I do my
[01:08:43] best I can't guarant I can't guarantee
[01:08:45] we're never going to have a problem but
[01:08:46] it's always if I le as soon as I pack it
[01:08:49] and it leaves me I can't do much beyond
[01:08:51] that all we gonna throw this out for 13
[01:08:53] instead of 14 there you go
[01:08:56] well almost
[01:08:57] 15 so I don't know that's that's really
[01:08:59] what it blows down do your best help as
[01:09:02] much as you
[01:09:06] can yeah exactly you didn't want to do
[01:09:08] anything till what not got involved
[01:09:13] correct like I had somebody send me
[01:09:15] something saying they didn't get
[01:09:16] something I was like all right I I did
[01:09:17] my
[01:09:18] best um but one of the things too is if
[01:09:21] you one of the things that with whatnot
[01:09:23] being involved as soon as they get
[01:09:24] involved your hands are tied and
[01:09:25] everything you can do if you want to do
[01:09:27] anything extra you have to do only
[01:09:28] exactly what is in the video you can't
[01:09:30] like be like hey I'm going to give this
[01:09:32] extra to you to say sorry but because
[01:09:35] they're going to end up saying you're
[01:09:37] not giving and doing the right stuff and
[01:09:38] only handing them what they got which is
[01:09:40] really weird to
[01:09:43] me but in the end I was wondering if I
[01:09:45] could just do like a a a discount or
[01:09:48] something like that hey I'm sorry I made
[01:09:49] a mistake and here's a discount but um I
[01:09:52] haven't had any answers on that one all
[01:09:55] right we're put this out here for you
[01:09:57] all and throw this on for this is a $5
[01:10:01] card we'll throw it on for
[01:10:05] four yeah exactly well the other thing
[01:10:08] is if somebody sends send you a message
[01:10:09] I try to respond to them right away I
[01:10:11] can't always guarantee I'm going to find
[01:10:12] something like the other day somebody
[01:10:14] said they they got something and they
[01:10:15] didn't have it received yet and I'm like
[01:10:17] uh well I'm guessing it was an
[01:10:19] individual single packet pack and as
[01:10:21] soon as I pack a single and hit like the
[01:10:23] packing and drop into the mail like a
[01:10:25] that pck Prince the slip it says it
[01:10:27] shipped and delivered because that's the
[01:10:28] way that the singles with the white
[01:10:30] envelopes work and I was like just wait
[01:10:32] for it to show
[01:10:38] up well even like even with the landlord
[01:10:41] stuff they not even necessarily screwing
[01:10:42] them over if they are flexible too
[01:10:44] flexible they're not going to have the
[01:10:45] money to fix the things that they need
[01:10:47] to when something goes wrong and people
[01:10:49] people do sometimes forget that like
[01:10:52] it's not that they're trying to screw
[01:10:53] anyone always it's just every night like
[01:10:55] if they do that they they're not going
[01:10:56] to be able to say you're pipe
[01:11:01] burst now now there are ones that are
[01:11:03] large
[01:11:06] companies that are that have a lot more
[01:11:09] ability of flexibility and stuff like
[01:11:11] that um they could probably do more but
[01:11:14] the person that's like an individual
[01:11:15] that owns their house or whatever you
[01:11:17] can't always do that with them because
[01:11:18] they I mean they can't always do that
[01:11:20] just because they they have their
[01:11:21] options are handed to them based on what
[01:11:24] they can do
[01:11:26] for their whether it's their um how much
[01:11:29] they owe for the house their taxes
[01:11:31] insurance and all that stuff you
[01:11:36] know exactly as long as people like well
[01:11:39] I should try to tell everybody if you're
[01:11:40] honest and we just help each other like
[01:11:42] I said if you're honest and you help
[01:11:43] when you can we wouldn't have as many
[01:11:46] issues as we do because people wouldn't
[01:11:48] you don't need to help all the time but
[01:11:50] everybody would be helped when they
[01:11:51] needed if everybody helped what they can
[01:11:53] cuz there's enough people in the world
[01:11:54] to do that that there's enough people
[01:11:56] around us that can do that you know like
[01:11:58] you don't need to you don't need to
[01:12:01] have everybody doing the same thing all
[01:12:04] the time but you can have everybody over
[01:12:07] time slowly doing these things which
[01:12:09] will allow you to um which allow the
[01:12:12] world to go better be better in that
[01:12:13] aspect let me find the cards I was
[01:12:15] looking
[01:12:17] for but that's just me being silly and
[01:12:19] expecting people to have morals more
[01:12:21] than they have selfishness
[01:12:30] and I think that's my problem my my
[01:12:32] issue
[01:12:33] personally people I I I expect more from
[01:12:36] people and then they can ever produce
[01:12:39] but we'll throw this out for a dollar if
[01:12:41] you'd like hey andoro how's it going my

[01:34:58] Adventure here if you'd like we'll do it
[01:35:00] a discount right now but it guarantees
[01:35:02] you a pack of cards you're going to pull
[01:35:05] from one box box number one here but if
[01:35:07] you don't get the one that says play
[01:35:08] booster box written on it you get to
[01:35:09] pick bloomo murderers Exelon or aoria
[01:35:12] your choice but you become the
[01:35:14] adventurer in our Wasteland as you walk
[01:35:16] into the Vault we're going to see what
[01:35:18] happens as you go along the way here is
[01:35:20] it going to be some fun I don't know
[01:35:22] it's always up to you
[01:35:24] what we do but the nice thing is
[01:35:26] somebody had said we needed to make a uh
[01:35:28] we need to make like a a
[01:35:30] dice tower so here we go ah I made one
[01:35:34] look I made one just out of a box that
[01:35:37] way we can have it
[01:35:39] but there we go let's have some fun this
[01:35:42] morning all righty we'll put um now if
[01:35:44] you want you just want to play the game
[01:35:45] and have a chance of potentially getting
[01:35:47] a pack I did build this one which has
[01:35:51] all like just mainly bulk stuff just for
[01:35:53] those that wanted to play it has stuff
[01:35:54] written on there for the game but there
[01:35:56] is one pack of cards in there that says
[01:35:58] play booster one thing that's one card
[01:36:01] that says play booster pack on it sorry
[01:36:02] let me re word that
[01:36:05] correctly and then we'll do some more of
[01:36:09] our um we'll go through some more
[01:36:10] singles maybe here for a
[01:36:12] bit but I have to get rid of that now
[01:36:15] and I'm down to my last pack of top
[01:36:16] loaders so we better get my delivery
[01:36:18] today of the other
[01:36:21] one cuz I definitely need them my last
[01:36:24] pack right here they're supposed to be
[01:36:26] in on Monday but they sent me the wrong
[01:36:29] stuff so I don't have
[01:36:33] any because as you can see I built every
[01:36:35] one of them has now a $1 block so you
[01:36:37] can play all the things you just don't
[01:36:39] get all the St same stuff now it's just
[01:36:41] so you can play the game game here or
[01:36:43] maybe you just want to try your luck on
[01:36:45] a modern Horizon
[01:36:46] 3 or secret lair for some mod Horizon 3
[01:36:50] a secret lirer for
[01:36:51] $3 and then um
[01:36:56] you can get singles or modern Horizon 3
[01:36:57] for
[01:36:58] $3 and that's what that is right there
[01:37:02] and we will uh we'll keep putting in
[01:37:04] some of
[01:37:05] these things over here and see what we
[01:37:09] have for our adventure because you I
[01:37:11] mean you can go attack May the small bug
[01:37:12] going to come out is it going to be a
[01:37:13] Raider we've been upgrading our things
[01:37:16] here adding different ones here so I
[01:37:18] have to uh look there's our bug now it's
[01:37:20] been adjusted so now we have those as
[01:37:23] our bug

[01:37:45] right here in front of us where would
[01:37:47] you like to go in here you get a
[01:37:50] potential of getting the whole play
[01:37:51] booster box if not you're guaranteed
[01:37:53] you're going to get either Bloom
[01:37:54] murderers Exelon or ioria because it's
[01:37:56] your choice of which one you
[01:37:57] want all righty so let's go and see what
[01:38:01] you would like to do my friend number 11
[01:38:03] in we can do that one two three four
[01:38:08] five six 7 8 9 10 11 all right number 11
[01:38:13] in is this card here and you
[01:38:18] have decided our friend Costco
[01:38:24] that's what I'm calling you the
[01:38:26] adventurer is walking into the into the
[01:38:28] Vault here and in front of them oh we
[01:38:30] have a custody Squire but you have a
[01:38:33] mediumsized Raider you see standing in
[01:38:35] the hallway as you enter that first the
[01:38:38] door there now you did not get the play
[01:38:40] Booster Box on there so you get a bloomo
[01:38:42] Murs ion or aoria whichever is your
[01:38:45] choice of pack you want but you now get
[01:38:48] to
[01:38:49] Adventure through the Wasteland
[01:38:52] here and see what
[01:39:02] happens where's the where's the things
[01:39:05] here oh it's right there that's why I
[01:39:07] can't see it ioria ioria it is we'll
[01:39:10] grab that from right here give you your
[01:39:13] ioria pack beautiful we'll put that
[01:39:16] right there now do you want me to rip
[01:39:17] that open now or would you like me to um
[01:39:21] do that in a little bit here now
[01:39:24] because after you're done with your
[01:39:25] little Adventure you got going
[01:39:31] on as it is you
[01:39:35] now playing our game and you have 100
[01:39:39] Health but you are an adventure and
[01:39:41] you're walking in and the only thing you
[01:39:42] have is like a wrench with you you don't
[01:39:43] have anything to fight with so you have
[01:39:45] to decide what you want to do here do
[01:39:47] you want to play play this adventure
[01:39:48] game because the medium one that you're
[01:39:50] going against is 30 on their strength
[01:39:55] AER all right so you walk in and as you
[01:39:58] walk in you see right in front of you a
[01:40:00] mediumsized Raider now you have some
[01:40:02] options would you like to go after some
[01:40:05] weapons you can potentially get yourself
[01:40:07] a weapon here for um well this is $2
[01:40:09] it's guaranteed $2 you're going to get
[01:40:11] yourself a this is $2 you're going to
[01:40:14] get yourself a weapon in the game and
[01:40:15] you're also going to get a um either a
[01:40:17] single that you have listed there or
[01:40:19] potentially the mystery booster two pack
[01:40:21] if you're lucky and it's one out of a
[01:40:23] 100 on the spots there and you can grab
[01:40:24] yourself a weapon if you like or you
[01:40:26] could do the other pull box which is the
[01:40:27] dollar ones that are in the buy now and
[01:40:30] try one of those for a weapon if you
[01:40:31] like or we can just attack and see what
[01:40:33] happens because you have to get a 16 or
[01:40:35] higher right now to beat your uh to beat
[01:40:38] the character with the adventure when we
[01:40:40] roll so it's up to you what you want to
[01:40:43] do you already go a weapon all right
[01:40:46] right here we're going to run this right
[01:40:48] now now this is you have a chance of
[01:40:49] getting a mystery booster
[01:40:51] to or a bunch of singles now everything
[01:40:55] has a weapon listed on it whether it's
[01:40:56] knife pistol assault rifle Sword
[01:40:59] whatever that's going to run right now
[01:41:01] or in the buy now there's also the $1
[01:41:05] boxes that are just literally just
[01:41:07] mainly to play the game to get something
[01:41:10] but the difference is um it's all all
[01:41:13] bulk not really worthwhile any cards and
[01:41:15] the um there's one pack in this rid on
[01:41:17] there for one pack on the cards but here
[01:41:19] right now let's see what you get you
[01:41:21] going with these ones and these are the
[01:41:22] good ways cuz you get to have a good
[01:41:24] weap get some oh there we go get
[01:41:26] yourself a
[01:41:27] pistol nice that means you have a
[01:41:32] pistol and you have six shots now the
[01:41:36] pistol is a plus two on your attack so
[01:41:39] that means you need to get 14 or
[01:41:41] higher you want to keep rolling because
[01:41:43] you can even roll and try to get a buff
[01:41:45] you can try your luck on on getting a
[01:41:47] buff here if you would like for $3 you
[01:41:49] could get a buff or a health pack or
[01:41:50] something too
[01:41:53] I can cap him yeah you can shoot at him
[01:41:56] let's go all right so 14 we're going to
[01:41:58] roll with 14 it is
[01:42:01] right all right here we go we're going
[01:42:03] to start we're going to be first rolled
[01:42:04] to see what happens see if you get if
[01:42:05] you're able to beat the medium siiz
[01:42:09] Raider is that what we're
[01:42:11] doing let me know say yes or no and
[01:42:13] we'll
[01:42:16] go put my drink oh there it
[01:42:19] is yes all right here we are here's the
[01:42:22] first one let's see what
[01:42:25] happens oh look at that 17 you didn't
[01:42:28] need you didn't need any extra you come
[01:42:30] out
[01:42:31] shooting that Adventure as you walk
[01:42:33] right through the door you shoot that
[01:42:35] mediumsized Raider before you even say
[01:42:37] anything all right and you hit that
[01:42:39] Medium siiz Raider with all right nicely
[01:42:42] hit him and it brings him from 30 Health
[01:42:44] down to oh nice that brings him down to
[01:42:46] 18 Health that was a good shot you got
[01:42:48] lucky on that one now he's mad though he
[01:42:49] shoots back at you with his
[01:42:51] pistol and
[01:42:54] all right not bad not a bad one he hits
[01:42:56] you and it brings you down to 91 Health
[01:42:58] but luckily it's only like a a flesh
[01:43:00] wound type thing are we rolling again
[01:43:02] you have three chances are you rolling
[01:43:04] again are you going to run away or do
[01:43:05] you want to try one more time I'm
[01:43:07] guessing you're going keep
[01:43:11] going roll all right here we
[01:43:14] go put your a thing here oh 18 all we
[01:43:18] got 18 this time same thing he had a
[01:43:21] good hit this time nice one now now
[01:43:23] let's see that brings you to O that's a
[01:43:25] good hit brings him down to eight that
[01:43:28] was a good hit there and they but he's
[01:43:29] so out of days and confused he barely is
[01:43:31] able to shoot this mediumsized Raider is
[01:43:34] barely able to shoot back at you so he
[01:43:38] misses his shot and you're at 91
[01:43:40] Health our last one I'm guessing we're
[01:43:42] doing the last one here so I'm going to
[01:43:43] roll for you oh it was an eight oh
[01:43:47] no you miss on your last shot but that
[01:43:51] Raider
[01:43:53] swings at you I mean shoots at you and
[01:43:56] hits you barely with a shoulder shot
[01:43:59] again and this one has brings you down
[01:44:00] to 85 Health now with the three things
[01:44:03] here you hit them twice now they're
[01:44:05] scared they're going to run away they
[01:44:06] turn and they flee all right because you
[01:44:09] weren't able to beat them you don't
[01:44:10] necessarily get to loot them but because
[01:44:12] they turn and flee in the process of
[01:44:15] their
[01:44:16] fleeing they drop some
[01:44:18] things all right they
[01:44:21] drop four pogs for yeah so that means
[01:44:24] you get some Wasteland
[01:44:26] currency now you have some pogs so what
[01:44:29] that means is if you would like you can
[01:44:30] you can find
[01:44:33] yourself a um Safe Haven to spend those
[01:44:37] at at some point but right now you get
[01:44:39] those and there you go my friend yeah
[01:44:42] what would you like to do further would
[01:44:43] you like to open your pack or do you
[01:44:46] want to go continue on in the vault here
[01:44:48] seeing what happens now we do have
[01:44:51] bosses at certain levels no no one's
[01:44:53] hitting level one yet though which is
[01:44:54] surprising I was expecting people to hit
[01:44:56] level one at some
[01:44:57] point but we've only had people play for
[01:44:59] a little while not too long everybody
[01:45:02] ends up having to go to work because you
[01:45:03] know it's a weekday people are playing
[01:45:04] on so would you like me to rip your pack
[01:45:06] open or do you want to play a little
[01:45:09] more let's try a safe haven all right
[01:45:12] here we go so here we have this version
[01:45:14] of the safe haven if you do it from this
[01:45:15] one you have a can get a hitsun moo
[01:45:18] secret lir or um a bunch of the singles
[01:45:22] that are here so the last ones this one
[01:45:24] is $4 but the safe havens you get to use
[01:45:27] the code that you get for each Safe
[01:45:28] Haven is a three time use so it's not a
[01:45:31] single use it's a three-time use one so
[01:45:34] that's why uh we have those ones here
[01:45:36] there you go Safe Haven is $4 two D to
[01:45:38] one one of those and you can get a
[01:45:40] single or potentially that
[01:45:42] um that Z Miko secret
[01:45:45] layer let's see what's happening here we
[01:45:48] didn't do
[01:45:51] it and we we have CST

[01:59:48] knife to attack with if you want
[01:59:54] and did you do
[01:59:59] another and you have
[02:00:02] ah did you get a health booster
[02:00:08] before did I miss something I don't
[02:00:10] think I
[02:00:11] did you what
[02:00:13] both health or buff oh did not come on
[02:00:17] out for I might not have shown on both
[02:00:19] of them hold on sometimes it's slow
[02:00:23] oh you did get you had a healther buff
[02:00:25] yep correct you did get them too it just
[02:00:27] showed it just took a minute to show up
[02:00:28] sorry there you go same spot number
[02:00:34] five number five correct oh number one
[02:00:38] number one all right number one it is
[02:00:41] you have an intelligence oh that's a
[02:00:44] good one a plus one on your intelligence
[02:00:46] so now that will help you if you have
[02:00:47] any of the higher level weapons like a
[02:00:50] plasma rifle that gives you a plus one
[02:00:52] and if you need to break into anything
[02:00:54] or maybe there's a there's a trap of
[02:00:56] some kind that comes up that'll help you
[02:00:57] with a trap now you can add that right
[02:00:59] now to your character or you can just
[02:01:01] hold that as an item that you have in
[02:01:05] your um where is
[02:01:10] it an item that you have where's my
[02:01:14] intelligence one hold on

[02:01:42] is there it is God that was so hard to
[02:01:45] find or you can add some intelligence

[02:01:58] that's all right you can hold it and run
[02:01:59] if you want all right you see that
[02:02:01] because if you run away you get to keep
[02:02:02] your stuff but what will happen is you

[02:07:40] and you have three
[02:07:42] knives and you had accessed a safe room
[02:07:46] before but I think you used it a couple
[02:07:48] times already so you don't have an
[02:07:49] opportunity to go back to that again you
[02:07:51] have to get another you have to try
[02:07:52] another safe room for the code again see
[02:07:54] if you can find
[02:07:59] one but either way you are
[02:08:03] now standing in this
[02:08:05] hallway looking at a mediumsized Raider
[02:08:08] wondering what you should do now you get
[02:08:10] a choice of bloomo murderers Exon or
[02:08:12] aoria let me know what pack you want and
[02:08:15] we're going to go from
[02:08:17] there and see what happens
[02:08:28] I KO all right would we like to rip that
[02:08:31] now or do you want to rip that after
[02:08:32] we're done playing a little
[02:08:36] bit all corer right there for you my
[02:08:39] friend all right Afra let's see what
[02:08:41] happens are we going to get luck here oh
[02:08:45] no we'll figure it out shortly
[02:08:53] let's swing at him with a sword I like
[02:08:54] it you run towards that mediumsized
[02:08:57] Raider are you going to put use your um
[02:08:59] um Health you're at 66 still but anyways
[02:09:03] you run at that mediumsized Raider you
[02:09:06] use yes please all right so you use your
[02:09:08] health pack before you go
[02:09:11] swinging you use your health pack you go
[02:09:14] from 66 Health to 76 Health all right
[02:09:17] you go swinging at that large
[02:09:19] Raider with your
[02:09:24] sword now that large Raider you have to
[02:09:29] get you have uh agility plus one is the
[02:09:32] only thing you have all right so you can
[02:09:34] it just helps with that doesn't help
[02:09:35] with this actually does help with this
[02:09:37] plus one with the sword is agility
[02:09:39] actually that's plus one so you're
[02:09:40] actually plus six right now all right
[02:09:42] you're plus six so you need a um 10 or
[02:09:48] higher o you got 19 19 all right you
[02:09:53] swing your mighty
[02:09:54] sword at that Medium siiz Raider that
[02:09:59] mediumsized Raider's got 30 health and
[02:10:01] that mighty sword cracks down on his
[02:10:03] shoulder where he's has a gun and knocks
[02:10:06] him down from 30 Health to um 13 Health
[02:10:10] that was a big hit there my friend are
[02:10:12] we going to swing again to see what
[02:10:13] happens what are we doing I'm guessing
[02:10:16] we're swinging again
[02:10:22] swing away all right you got three
[02:10:23] chances to see what happens here oh
[02:10:26] 15 this time you get 15 but you know

[02:41:54] right the last one
[02:41:55] is here we are my friend you are
[02:41:59] encountering a small
[02:42:01] Raider is in front of you and you have
[02:42:04] to decide what you want to do you see
[02:42:07] him at the end of this hallway here and
[02:42:09] you're like oh what do I want to
[02:42:11] do ah yes you have a little pew pew and
[02:42:16] he's got a little ra a little gun there
[02:42:18] for you I don't know what are you going
[02:42:18] to do my
[02:42:21] friend and you have a choice you can
[02:42:23] choose your dice too if you like change
[02:42:24] it up go from uh that green one to a
[02:42:26] different one it's up to you also
[02:42:29] there you going do some pew pew all
[02:42:31] right I like it now you got your pistol
[02:42:34] you're going to shoot at them do you
[02:42:35] want to stay the same dice or will you
[02:42:37] change it
[02:42:40] up red and
[02:42:43] yellow this one
[02:42:49] all
[02:42:51] right let's
[02:42:53] see you have 11 nice but that small
[02:42:58] Raider is
[02:43:01] 15 so that small Raider is
[02:43:04] 35 30 on their health and you do not hit
[02:43:10] them oh you want to use your critical
[02:43:13] you can use the critical if you're going
[02:43:14] to use your critical it's a guaranteed
[02:43:16] hit with the critical is what that is
[02:43:21] okay you're using the critical I didn't
[02:43:23] know you using that you're using the
[02:43:24] critical then critical it is that's the
[02:43:26] critical you don't even need to roll we
[02:43:28] just pretty much see like yeah that
[02:43:29] doesn't matter you hit them with the
[02:43:30] critical you use
[02:43:32] it no no a critical is a guaranteed hit
[02:43:35] you're guaranteed going to hit them and
[02:43:37] what it will do is not necessar a
[02:43:38] multiplier but it's a bigger hit than
[02:43:39] normal so what I I have an thing here is
[02:43:41] going to go
[02:43:43] with nice brings it down to 12 Health
[02:43:47] that was a good hit there yeah that was
[02:43:49] a nice shot Nice Shot there yes no the
[02:43:52] criticals are like a guaranteed hit on
[02:43:54] them and it just is really pretty much I
[02:43:56] have a multiplier for my my Excel file
[02:44:00] and you're going to shoot him again all
[02:44:01] right go after him one more time now
[02:44:04] this time you do need to get the um 13
[02:44:08] or
[02:44:09] higher with with this to be able to get
[02:44:12] it because you're
[02:44:14] shooting and you did you got 16 this
[02:44:18] time look at that 16 it is and you shoot
[02:44:22] and you hit them nice that he was
[02:44:25] already damaged that small Raider
[02:44:26] because he already got shot directly in
[02:44:28] the chest and he was bleeding out now
[02:44:30] you hit him again right next to him in
[02:44:32] the chest and he drops to the ground and
[02:44:34] he only has three Health left he tries
[02:44:37] to shoot at you but it's wild and he
[02:44:39] gets no shot that hits you you have one
[02:44:42] more opportunity here now you can take
[02:44:45] the CH the idea and go up and um go with
[02:44:49] double your two uh I think you have two
[02:44:51] knives right finish him with both the
[02:44:54] daggers that's what I was figuring all
[02:44:55] right this means you need to get a um
[02:44:58] you have the agility which is a plus one
[02:45:00] so you have plus five because of those
[02:45:02] so that means you need to get a um 10 or
[02:45:07] higher oh you rolled a natural
[02:45:11] 20 a natural 20 you go up to him that
[02:45:14] small Raider and you slice right at him
[02:45:17] his head goes rolling off to the ground
[02:45:19] round and you take both you
[02:45:21] just his head Falls right
[02:45:25] off and you're going to take the d do
[02:45:27] his house he does not have a house
[02:45:30] but because of that nice critical hit at
[02:45:33] the end there with the luck you end up
[02:45:38] finding one two three four five six
[02:45:43] seven pogs on them and you also find
[02:45:49] another
[02:45:51] pistol which has 15
[02:45:56] ammo so there you go my friend you now
[02:45:58] have a
[02:46:00] pistol times two and you went up 15 ammo
[02:46:05] to 34 ammo oh 24
[02:46:09] ammo look at that and you also get seven
[02:46:17] pogs because of that
[02:46:19] natural 20 at the end there you needed
[02:46:21] to get a big
[02:46:22] one you're going to go to the trader all
[02:46:24] right you're going to head over to the
[02:46:26] trader let's head on over to that
[02:46:28] Trader and see what we can find so which
[02:46:33] one was it that you had found before I
[02:46:35] think you had gotten the um you were at
[02:46:37] the hidden door right the hidden door
[02:46:40] you have one chance one more chance to
[02:46:42] go to the hidden door because you only
[02:46:43] have uh whenever you pull from this one
[02:46:44] you only have one opportunity but I I'll
[02:46:46] give I'll give you another one here so
[02:46:48] you get to go back to that hidden door
[02:46:50] and what are you going to do there at
[02:46:51] the hidden door my friend cuz this code
[02:46:53] is the last time the code will work on
[02:46:55] the hidden door unless you pull another
[02:46:57] another Safe Haven you won't go again
[02:46:59] unless this is only a one one time use
[02:47:01] codes but we'll give you a two time use
[02:47:04] on this one so where would you like to
[02:47:06] go in there after you've killed that
[02:47:08] Raider
[02:47:09] off sell your gun and daggers all right
[02:47:14] so you're going to go and sell the
[02:47:15] daggers that's going to bring you to um
[02:47:18] all right that bring you up
[02:47:21] to no all
[02:47:23] right that brings you to 11 pogs your
[02:47:27] knives are gone your daggers are
[02:47:32] gone and then your one of your pistols
[02:47:35] is gone and that pistol's five so that
[02:47:38] brings you up to
[02:47:41] 16 all right
[02:47:43] so you have 16 pogs and you're at the
[02:47:47] Traer that Trader says all right you
[02:47:50] have um pistol ammo 30 rounds for 10
[02:47:54] pogs um a assault rifle is 15 pogs
[02:47:59] plasma rifle is 25 pogs the sword I
[02:48:03] believe was uh I think the sword is 10
[02:48:08] pogs I think sword's 10
[02:48:11] pogs uh no swords 15 pogs 15
[02:48:15] 15 25
[02:48:18] then you can get some health at uh $2
[02:48:22] per 10 10
[02:48:24] resource um and you can also find
[02:48:27] yourself some pistol ammo there also
[02:48:33] what would you like to
[02:48:34] do our Gage sitting over there going hey
[02:48:38] buddy what can I get you
[02:48:42] here with your 16
[02:48:45] pogs you got to make some decisions on
[02:48:48] what you would like to do my
[02:48:51] friend our rifle all right so you're
[02:48:53] going to buy a rifle all right and full
[02:48:57] health o full health means
[02:49:01] um you're going to have to so all right
[02:49:03] so to get to full health that would be
[02:49:04] 10 that be 30 so that means You' be two
[02:49:08] three four that'll leave you with only
[02:49:12] 10 pogs which is the assault rifle I
[02:49:15] believe was 10 pogs yes so 10 pogs there
[02:49:17] you go so that brings you up to 99
[02:49:21] health and that goes to zero pogs
[02:49:24] because you just used all that now you

[00:13:41] a certain amount uh over $20 the
[00:13:43] shipping is always going to have uh the
[00:13:45] track one but instead of 40 something

[00:15:28] which which is our others you can see
[00:15:31] everything literally in the box if you
[00:15:32] want to go and look at
[00:15:35] it I was using
[00:15:38] um I use hold on the site is MTG stocks
[00:15:42] generally it pulls everything directly
[00:15:44] from um TCG or the most recent thing
[00:15:46] it's ntg stocks it pulls it all from
[00:15:48] like uh you can actually sell it where
[00:15:50] to go to I always have it go to there so
[00:15:53] that's why I have it set that way
[00:16:00] yeah not a
[00:16:02] problem so for instance let me get some
[00:16:04] of my cards over
[00:16:09] here let's put
[00:16:13] out something
[00:16:17] like some people like some spice so
[00:16:19] we'll put out some spice for y all so
[00:16:22] put that on
[00:16:27] there so have seven
[00:16:30] deaths then your foil
[00:16:33] there there you go my friends you keep
[00:16:37] asking for spice so I throw it on there
[00:16:38] every now and again for you that's what
[00:16:40] we're
[00:16:41] doing that's
[00:16:43] spice so we're going to run our uh our
[00:16:45] box here again and then I'm going to get
[00:16:47] you the price of this one on here if you
[00:16:49] give me one second to get the single out
[00:16:51] here our box is running and then I'm
[00:16:54] going to get the single
[00:16:55] one there we go and this one I don't
[00:16:58] like the 100 and something so for that
[00:17:01] foil instead of it being 100 and
[00:17:03] something I'm going to put it to um you
[00:17:05] know what I'm going to do this I feel
[00:17:07] like that's way too much for a card so
[00:17:10] I'm going to do that that's what's going
[00:17:13] to
[00:17:13] happen for that sire of seven deaths and
[00:17:16] I'm going to put this into a sleeve
[00:17:18] we're going to open up our next pack to
[00:17:19] see if we have any

[02:44:08] giving away for good luck Here There You
[02:44:10] Go Justin starting off with a rare
[02:44:13] instantaneously you're
[02:44:15] welcome I know this is kind of a fun
[02:44:17] side game you get to it's a little well
[02:44:19] the thing is I like people I don't I
[02:44:21] personally don't I'm not a big fan of
[02:44:23] pole boxes all right if that makes any
[02:44:25] sense I I was never a giant Phantom I
[02:44:28] just have bad luck I think that's the
[02:44:29] reason why I don't like him because if I
[02:44:30] do one I never get anything if I do a
[02:44:32] break I never get anything I have to
[02:44:33] have like a pack of cards to get good
[02:44:35] luck if I'm going to get any luck at all
[02:44:37] so I did it where like if I'm going to
[02:44:39] buy something at least if somebody
[02:44:40] doesn't get good luck they can still
[02:44:41] play the adventure game if they have
[02:44:43] their character so like say you have the
[02:44:44] character and you're like all right hey
[02:44:45] I'm I'm buying these things and you just
[02:44:47] got yourself an assault rifle so now you
[02:44:49] get to add that to your inventory and
[02:44:50] kind of play along ra even if you don't
[02:44:52] feel like you're not getting anything
[02:44:53] you're still playing a game for a little
[02:44:57] bit oh not problem Justin I said give me
[02:45:00] a number between uh I said uh you got
[02:45:02] this actually this was given to you from
[02:45:05] our friend Dawn was given up as our next
[02:45:07] giveaway card so you got this from our
[02:45:09] Dawn of the Dead just saying that was a
[02:45:11] nice one for you and heavy baggin coming
[02:45:14] in trying it out here with a Miss
[02:45:17] breath Elder

[02:45:43] game that way allows I felt bad with not
[02:45:47] with like pull boxes
[02:45:49] so I wanted to make it so that we could
[02:45:51] do a little bit more than just a pull
[02:45:53] box if that makes sense want to do it
[02:45:55] like so like rather than just getting
[02:45:56] your card you can do something
[02:45:58] else if you wanted to do the the other
[02:46:01] one Grievous
[02:46:14] wound Grievous
[02:46:16] wound there you go dawn

[02:46:37] it just you know just do our
[02:46:41] thing yeah see that's what I like to do
[02:46:43] with it too personally you see literally
[02:46:45] everything and the price so you don't
[02:46:47] have a question about what you're
[02:46:48] getting
[02:46:49] you
[02:46:51] know try to do them as nice that's where
[02:46:54] you can see them exactly everything
[02:46:55] you're getting you don't need to worry
[02:46:56] about it that type of thing that's why I
[02:46:58] like doing it that way you literally go
[02:46:59] and see every single thing that's in
[02:47:02] there all the cards all the pricing and
[02:47:05] everything on it that's why I like doing
[02:47:06] them like that it's uh makes me feel a
[02:47:08] little bit more comfortable than doing
[02:47:09] it just the other
[02:47:12] way plus I can scan them all put all the
[02:47:15] pricing in nice and easy all right heavy
[02:47:17] let's see what you get here
[02:47:19] cclaw all right
[02:47:34] cclaw
[02:47:37] cyw there we
[02:47:42] go it makes it more transparent I think
[02:47:45] that's what it is that's what I like
[02:47:46] about it it makes it more transparent
[02:47:49] that's what it
[02:47:50] is hey Mystic that's why I like doing
[02:47:53] them like this that's why I like this
[02:47:55] that way because you can see literally
[02:47:56] everything there's no question anybody
[02:47:59] wants to look you can look at everything
[02:48:00] before you bid on anything you know it's
[02:48:02] nice that's why I like kind of that's
[02:48:03] why I was saying like what makes me feel
[02:48:05] a little bit more secure about what we
[02:48:07] do here more more like not like cuz I I
[02:48:10] used to I put it this way when I first
[02:48:12] came on the app I saw some people in
[02:48:14] like more of the Pokemon ones doing
[02:48:16] things I thought I thought it was kind
[02:48:17] of schemy Dy you know they would they
[02:48:20] would run it and they'd say uh you know
[02:48:22] they' mystery slabs or some [ __ ] like
[02:48:25] that well they're [ __ ] giving you a
[02:48:27] card that's in a slab a graded card and
[02:48:30] it was like a three cent card but you
[02:48:33] could get a $500 card so I wasn't a fan
[02:48:35] of those ones so I wanted to do it a
[02:48:37] little bit like you could have them
[02:48:38] close enough together that you're not
[02:48:39] getting screwed and also um that you can
[02:48:43] do something extra with it kind of if
[02:48:45] that makes any sense rather than just
[02:48:47] doing that so that's why we do the the
[02:48:50] adventure stuff old growth
[02:48:53] troll old growth troll right there for
[02:48:56] you my
[02:49:02] friend Mystic

[02:49:17] you actually get a better most most of

[02:56:36] get another
[02:56:38] card what's up oh you no there's only
[02:56:44] one box but there's two things in it is
[02:56:46] that correct no I should have have
[02:56:48] something else too I'll have to talk to
[02:56:49] them I'll have to figure out where my
[02:56:51] stuff is it's fine I tried you
[02:56:56] there I can go back no it's not your
[02:56:58] fault number one is fa Bloom you did not
[02:57:01] get that one there Crimson but let me
[02:57:04] put you with your other
[02:57:09] stuff I'm getting tired of shipping and
[02:57:14] deliveries not working
[02:57:17] right
[02:57:18] [Music]
[02:57:22] Crimson see if I have you
[02:57:26] here I know I got you written I thought
[02:57:28] I had you written down
[02:57:33] before you know what I'm just going to
[02:57:35] write your name down again I swear I
[02:57:37] wrote your name down
[02:57:43] already but that's all right we're going
[02:57:44] to do it
[02:57:46] again yeah
[02:57:50] it's been really bad like I have not
[02:57:52] even it's not even just mail like
[02:57:54] everything being delivered has been
[02:57:55] horrible like I've gotten stuff between
[02:57:58] UPS
[02:58:00] FedEx USPS like everything's just bad
[02:58:03] it's like no one is even caring about
[02:58:05] anything
[02:58:06] anymore I'm G to make a comment I don't
[02:58:09] know if anybody can agree with it or not
[02:58:11] but I will say this I noticed that after
[02:58:15] the election is when the deliv iies got
[02:58:19] worse I feel like there's some people
[02:58:21] that are pissed off and are acting like
[02:58:23] [ __ ] on purpose because they don't
[02:58:24] care
[02:58:25] anymore that's actually what I'm decid
[02:58:27] I've come to the conclusion of it's been
[02:58:30] right after the election is when
[02:58:31] everything went downhill and I'm I'm
[02:58:33] putting money on it that there's people
[02:58:35] that are pissed off and they're like
[02:58:36] [ __ ] this I'm not going to act like this
[02:58:37] I'm going to do whatever I want [ __ ]
[02:58:39] I can't believe they voted for somebody
[02:58:41] it's like it doesn't matter what anybody
[02:58:42] did but you don't need to be a
[02:58:44] dink under Mountain Adventure
[02:58:49] and that's something I specifically
[02:58:53] noticed yes yep that too under Mountain
[02:59:01] Adventure well they can't afford
[02:59:03] anything
[02:59:05] anymore no one's buying stuff all right
[02:59:08] so here's something that you guys need
[02:59:09] to realize um in the not too distant
[02:59:11] future what we're going to have if our
[02:59:13] economy doesn't turn around there's
[02:59:14] going to be a lot of people losing
[02:59:15] things people have been buying stuff on
[02:59:17] credit since Co
[02:59:18] no one has been using any of their stuff
[02:59:20] in their bank accounts so people that
[02:59:21] have money in the bank account are going
[02:59:22] to be pretty good but people have been
[02:59:24] buying everything on credit have all
[02:59:25] their credit maxed out right now like a
[02:59:28] lot of people have maxed their credit
[02:59:29] out on everything with maxing that out
[02:59:31] they can't buy anything anymore which is
[02:59:33] why they're now is having less purchases
[02:59:35] on stuff and people are starting to like
[02:59:37] companies are losing business they're
[02:59:39] cutting out overtime and other things
[02:59:41] like that because they can't afford them
[02:59:43] anymore now the other thing that you're
[02:59:44] going to notice too is with that
[02:59:46] happening you're going to start seeing
[02:59:47] houses prices dropping you're going to
[02:59:49] see houses going on the market you're
[02:59:51] going to see Vehicles not being
[02:59:53] purchased those prices potentially
[02:59:54] dropping if they don't be purchased
[02:59:56] those lies for like a couple years but
[02:59:58] because no one has money and now what's
[03:00:00] going on is there's a gap right now
[03:00:02] there's a gap between the people that
[03:00:04] have money and the people that are all
[03:00:05] in debt the middle class upper middle
[03:00:08] class and below are all in debt to the
[03:00:10] point that they have no money and
[03:00:11] they're just going to be paying debt off
[03:00:13] where the upper middle maybe in the
[03:00:15] upper class have zero debt or have money
[03:00:18] in debt that they can pay off with other
[03:00:20] money they have so they're going to be
[03:00:22] fine so there's make there's this giant
[03:00:24] Gap that has been
[03:00:25] made between everyone currently that is
[03:00:29] causing it so that there's pretty much a
[03:00:30] different classes of
[03:00:33] people you're in debt because of whatnot
[03:00:35] and that's one of that's what's going on
[03:00:37] right now people don't realize that
[03:00:39] everybody that spent money during covid
[03:00:41] and spent it on credit they don't have
[03:00:43] anything anymore they literally have
[03:00:45] nothing but stuff that stuff dropped in
[03:00:47] value
[03:00:48] so they don't have anything anymore so
[03:00:50] they have no money and now they're
[03:00:51] getting to the point where they have
[03:00:52] nothing to do they don't have any money
[03:00:54] they don't know what to do they can't
[03:00:55] buy anything so what do you do now they
[03:00:58] sell stuff and when they sell stuff that
[03:01:00] means the cars
[03:01:02] houses toys and everything goes up on
[03:01:05] the
[03:01:09] market yes exactly never lower
[03:01:12] prices exactly exactly no one lowered
[03:01:14] price well they can't rehire people when
[03:01:16] no one's buying anything see that's part
[03:01:18] of the problem no one's buying anything
[03:01:20] so they can't uh rehire people and if
[03:01:22] you can't rehire someone because no
[03:01:23] one's buying anything you're going to
[03:01:24] get stuck in a circle of a vicious
[03:01:25] circle Halo coming in with our giveaway
[03:01:28] from winning the universe saving the
[03:01:29] universe Halo is never here but
[03:01:34] hey yeah so Crimson the thing is though
[03:01:38] those companies buying them out are
[03:01:40] losing money because the housing
[03:01:42] Market's going down in a lot of the
[03:01:44] places for instance in Florida um like
[03:01:47] Black Rock B ton of houses down here and
[03:01:49] a couple other companies did and when
[03:01:51] they bought all those houses uh it
[03:01:53] caused everything to M Spike up but
[03:01:55] what's going on right now hey good
[03:01:56] morning
[03:01:58] famous no we haven't in a little bit so
[03:02:00] what's going on right now is now
[03:02:02] everything has been starting to drop in
[03:02:04] Florida from $50 to $100,000 so they're
[03:02:07] actually all losing money on those
[03:02:08] houses they bought now and no one's even
[03:02:10] building anymore in any of the
[03:02:12] developments so what's going to H so
[03:02:14] that's what's going on is like yes the
[03:02:15] housing is not going to necessarily draw
[03:02:18] but it's the companies are going to
[03:02:19] start getting out and they're going to
[03:02:20] have to sell off the houses that's kind
[03:02:22] of what I was getting at yes they might
[03:02:23] not rent it cheaper if they still own it
[03:02:26] but if they're not going to own them
[03:02:27] anymore and they're going to sell them
[03:02:28] off it's going to be because they need
[03:02:29] to all take a loss on
[03:02:34] them yes exactly yes they can absorb it
[03:02:37] exactly to an extent um long story short
[03:02:40] I used to work with um banks around the
[03:02:43] world I used to manage anywhere from 20
[03:02:46] to 25% of the US Stock Exchange traffic
[03:02:48] and anywhere is from about 25 to 40% of
[03:02:51] the Asia Pacific Stock Exchange traffic
[03:02:53] I saw everything from every pretty much
[03:02:55] all the large banks that you picture on
[03:02:57] this planet I worked with I talked to
[03:02:59] their CEOs I talked to their presidents
[03:03:01] I updated all their Stockport stocks of
[03:03:04] what they're buying how much they're
[03:03:06] buying what their percentage is blah
[03:03:07] blah blah blah blah I know everything
[03:03:09] about most of the larger banks that
[03:03:12] pretty much picture movies and Banks and
[03:03:14] movies those are who the people I worked
[03:03:15] with or investment
[03:03:20] organizations exactly exactly they're
[03:03:23] not even based here now Crimson exactly
[03:03:25] so but the thing is though once they get
[03:03:27] to a certain threshold they have a
[03:03:29] threshold of a percentage of their loss
[03:03:31] and they're getting to that percentage
[03:03:33] threshold right now in the next six
[03:03:35] months if things don't start to turn
[03:03:36] around that threshold I have a suspicion
[03:03:38] will be over because it's only a certain
[03:03:40] percentage and once they hit that
[03:03:42] percentage
[03:03:43] boom they're going to drop and start
[03:03:45] selling things CU they don't they don't
[03:03:47] care they don't have feelings like
[03:03:48] people they care about their
[03:03:52] money
[03:03:54] yes I can do
[03:03:56] that I can do that that's fine with
[03:04:00] me let me find the Swift boots here for
[03:04:05] you Swift boots 258 there you go my
[03:04:09] friend I can do that for you and I'll
[03:04:12] give the the JY do you give him the JY
[03:04:14] too or do you want to switch is that
[03:04:15] what you're doing you're Trading
[03:04:22] pack John there you go Swift
[03:04:28] boots yeah there not so many of them oh
[03:04:31] give it to him perfect I can do that
[03:04:34] nice I like it there you go
[03:04:38] dawn that's Pax
[03:04:41] John our friend there P John spreading
[03:04:45] that love out I like when you spread the
[03:04:46] love we like spreading the love
[03:04:53] yes exactly and if the Tariff goes
[03:04:54] through it's going to even what way if
[03:04:56] that tariff goes through they're going
[03:04:57] to get rid of him a lot quicker than um
[03:05:00] than waiting for that uh percentage that
[03:05:01] they're going to hit that's like it's
[03:05:02] not even that high of a percentage by
[03:05:03] the way it's only like it's like three
[03:05:06] to five sometimes 7% so it's not even
[03:05:08] that high of a percentage before they
[03:05:09] start selling [ __ ]
[03:05:13] off try to pay it forward yes we try to
[03:05:15] have some good times here
[03:05:18] so it's just it's just crazy like having
[03:05:22] worked with them and see how they move
[03:05:23] money
[03:05:24] around um they can only move money they
[03:05:26] only move money around for a c certain
[03:05:28] amount of time until they sell stuff and
[03:05:30] generally it's
[03:05:32] a six6 month
[03:05:36] period is generally what about what it
[03:05:38] is about a six-month period is when they
[03:05:40] start moving things around stop moving
[03:05:41] things around and they start selling at
[03:05:44] least what I noticed I can't guarantee
[03:05:46] it I'm just going to say that that's
[03:05:47] what I noticed from when I was working
[03:05:48] with this [ __ ] and that was
[03:05:52] also
[03:05:55] 20 19 to
[03:05:57] 2020 so two years I did that so it
[03:06:00] wasn't that long I felt dirty actually
[03:06:01] kind of working there too that was me
[03:06:04] but I learned some things and I didn't
[03:06:05] like
[03:06:10] it yeah exactly that's why I said
[03:06:12] between three and seven that's why I
[03:06:14] said between three and seven yeah pretty
[03:06:16] much they're at that percentage yep you
[03:06:18] you know oh you must be in this area
[03:06:20] Crimson then you must be in a little bit
[03:06:22] of this then yeah that's why I said
[03:06:23] between 3 and 7% is generally what
[03:06:26] they're at to drop things I've I very
[03:06:28] rarely see anything go to a 10% area on
[03:06:30] any of them I saw one or two of the
[03:06:32] companies and that was only on certain
[03:06:34] ones that were long in certain price
[03:06:35] ranges like if it was a $200,000 stock
[03:06:38] then they would let it go up to like
[03:06:39] that amount but not generally um other
[03:06:42] ways oo that's a nice pick up on the
[03:06:46] urza or urza Chief that's the the right
[03:06:50] one ö a chief Artis
[03:06:55] ofer yeah you must be in that somewhere
[03:06:58] urza is a nice hit black bear black
[03:07:03] bunker there you
[03:07:05] go there's a good one there then D
[03:07:09] BBL let's get you uh get another
[03:07:11] giveaway run here and get you BBL a
[03:07:14] number between one and 10 if you don't
[03:07:15] mind
[03:07:22] ah could also help that there oh yeah
[03:07:24] some of the governments do foot the
[03:07:25] bills now oh yeah that's the other thing
[03:07:27] well that's that's that's a nice thing
[03:07:29] though too if the governments are
[03:07:30] footing the bill and we're making them
[03:07:31] lose
[03:07:35] money see that's one of the nice things
[03:07:37] about that if we can uh if the US can
[03:07:40] handle it correctly where they want to
[03:07:42] hold on to their [ __ ] but the tariffs
[03:07:45] and other things go into place and then
[03:07:47] end up dropping and losing more money
[03:07:48] than they uh than they thought they were
[03:07:50] going to make that is a distinct
[03:07:51] possibility if they don't pay attention
[03:07:52] and get rid of their stuff quick enough
[03:07:54] all right number 10 is campus guide all
[03:07:57] right let's see where oh it was uh it
[03:08:00] would have been number what six curse
[03:08:02] recording
[03:08:04] nice yeah so I I mean I've done I the
[03:08:07] only reason I know it is just from
[03:08:08] working with him I didn't go for the
[03:08:09] business I was a I was actually a Premed
[03:08:12] major and long story short life didn't
[03:08:15] happen correctly so ended up uh doing
[03:08:18] some other stuff for a little while and
[03:08:19] then I went into development and was a
[03:08:21] developer were uh computer
[03:08:25] [ __ ] yeah I mean that's one of those
[03:08:27] things where you can't always having
[03:08:30] worked with all those things you kind of
[03:08:31] just at some point you you
[03:08:34] realize that it you want to BU I what I
[03:08:38] kind I so when I was buying my
[03:08:40] boat not learning python that's a good
[03:08:42] one dude definitely a good one to learn
[03:08:44] I have I learn I know a bit about python
[03:08:46] myself I actually do a lot of pyth
[03:08:47] Python
[03:09:00] scripts so yeah but yeah no we all I'm
[03:09:04] trying to think here what I was just
[03:09:06] saying I got blacked up blanked out when
[03:09:07] I was reading
[03:09:08] something oh yeah python I was talking
[03:09:10] about python yeah I know that a bit I
[03:09:12] actually I used to use it with
[03:09:15] um with those Banks a lot actually a lot
[03:09:17] of the stuff I had set up was with
[03:09:22] python black bunker
[03:09:25] SAA look it's right there Sacha for
[03:09:29] black
[03:09:31] bunker there you go black
[03:09:39] bunker there you
[03:09:41] go my friend yeah but like they when it
[03:09:45] comes to those you know that I so when I
[03:09:47] bought my boat we kept being told go to
[03:09:50] a private one go to a private one and we
[03:09:51] looked at private ones and half of them
[03:09:53] were like junk I wouldn't trust somebody
[03:09:55] in that that what they use so what I
[03:09:57] ended up doing was we went I was like
[03:09:59] you know what I'm going to go to one of
[03:10:00] the
[03:10:01] um I'm going to go to a charter company
[03:10:03] because I know they won they take care
[03:10:05] of their boat because they had to have
[03:10:06] it for certain legal reasons um to be
[03:10:08] able to Charter people and yeah it might
[03:10:10] have some monair things wrong but it
[03:10:11] can't be that much wrong compared to
[03:10:12] other stuff oh you tattoo for a living
[03:10:21] yes exactly Don yep you know exactly
[03:10:24] what I'm talking about like you get
[03:10:25] exactly what I mean like it's ex people
[03:10:27] don't have the money anymore so if you
[03:10:29] have stuff booked that's awesome that is
[03:10:31] really cool like so they've already done
[03:10:33] it and already planned it all so that's
[03:10:34] awesome but yeah it it no one has it
[03:10:36] everybody's capped out all their credit
[03:10:38] so they don't have anything and the
[03:10:40] thing is people have feelings when it
[03:10:42] comes to an item so for instance I went
[03:10:44] to buy a couple of our we weren't
[03:10:45] looking for our boats our sailboat to
[03:10:46] buy we bought one end up buying it from
[03:10:48] a charter company because they don't
[03:10:50] have feelings they have they understand
[03:10:53] math and numbers so it's like I don't
[03:10:55] care about they the other people like
[03:10:57] well I don't know I don't feel like I
[03:10:58] should sell that boat at that much like
[03:11:00] the boat I'm actually giving you more
[03:11:01] than it's worth based on the market
[03:11:03] value because I'd like your boat other
[03:11:04] than the other ones it's like 10 grand
[03:11:06] more than it's worth based on the market
[03:11:08] value so you want to take that or not
[03:11:10] like and then somebody like I don't know
[03:11:11] if I feel like way I don't feel like
[03:11:12] that I'm like you you got to get your
[03:11:13] feelings out of stuff because now since
[03:11:16] they didn't sell those those boats are
[03:11:17] now down $30,000 from what they were
[03:11:20] before I'm like what the heck no we
[03:11:23] haven't had a secret layer in a while I
[03:11:26] know so I ended up going to the charter
[03:11:29] company and they're like yeah we'll do
[03:11:30] it at that price because I gave them a
[03:11:31] percentage difference and I knew they
[03:11:33] were getting new boats in so I was like
[03:11:34] hey they're getting new boats in and
[03:11:35] here's a percentage they can tolerate
[03:11:38] and they are not a person that looks at
[03:11:39] a number and goes oh my God that's an
[03:11:41] not they go oh all right we can deal
[03:11:42] with that
[03:11:45] percentage all right right here we go
[03:11:49] wack we got a
[03:11:54] wack
[03:11:55] [Music]
[03:11:58] investigator wack investigator for our

[03:27:23] supposed to be in there we're going to
[03:27:24] run that that was supposed to I don't
[03:27:25] know why that's in there that was
[03:27:27] supposed to Oh I thought that was a
[03:27:28] bloom one well no that was supposed to
[03:27:30] be a
[03:27:30] bloom um why is that not that we're
[03:27:33] running that we're randomizing that one
[03:27:35] again Galactus That was supposed to be I
[03:27:37] thought that was the bloom ones we have
[03:27:39] Bloom ones that are in there that are
[03:27:42] the winter ones that are like 10% chance
[03:27:45] of
[03:27:47] so I thought that was the bloom one
[03:27:48] we're going to randomize that again and
[03:27:50] I'm going to remove that and oh there
[03:27:52] you go
[03:27:54] buddy look at that that's how it always
[03:27:58] happens that's how that happens
[03:28:04] always look at
[03:28:07] that
[03:28:09] always
[03:28:14] always let me get rid of that here cuz I

[03:28:18] the other Island
[03:28:24] too we get rid of that
[03:28:26] here there we go that's not supposed to
[03:28:30] be in here
[03:28:33] either supposed to be the one that's the
[03:28:35] uh the winter Island I don't know why
[03:28:38] that's one even in there there's the
[03:28:40] winter Island and there's also one of
[03:28:43] the snow covered Islands in there but

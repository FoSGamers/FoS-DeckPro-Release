how do I make youtube videos only show when they are in their full quality of the video

To ensure that YouTube videos only appear to users in their full quality (e.g., 1080p, 4K), there isn't a direct way to enforce this across all viewers, as YouTube automatically adjusts the video quality based on the viewer's internet speed and device. However, there are a few strategies you can employ to help ensure the highest possible quality is available and promoted:

### 1. **Upload in the Highest Resolution Possible**
   - When uploading your video to YouTube, make sure to upload it in the highest resolution and quality possible (e.g., 4K if you recorded it in 4K). YouTube will downscale for viewers with slower connections, but those with the bandwidth will be able to see it in full resolution.
   - YouTube supports resolutions up to 8K, so ensure your video meets the highest quality standards, including bitrate and frame rate.

### 2. **Enable Viewing Quality Defaults**
   - Encourage your audience to manually select higher quality in the YouTube player settings:
     - **On Desktop**: Viewers can click the settings (gear) icon in the bottom right of the video player and choose a specific quality (e.g., 1080p or 4K).
     - **On Mobile**: Viewers can tap the three dots (or settings icon) in the top right and adjust the video quality to the highest available.

### 3. **Wait for Processing to Finish Before Sharing**
   - **YouTube processes videos in different resolutions**, starting with lower resolutions like 360p and 480p and then higher resolutions (1080p, 4K, etc.). 
   - **Do not share the video link until YouTube has finished processing in the highest quality.** You can check the upload status by refreshing the video in YouTube Studio to see if it's fully processed in all resolutions.

### 4. **Use End Screens & Annotations for High-Quality Links**
   - You can guide viewers to higher-quality versions of your content by linking videos directly via **end screens** or **annotations** in your videos. Ensure that those videos are the highest quality available.
   
### 5. **YouTube Premium Viewers**
   - YouTube Premium subscribers often have higher default video quality, as they have access to more bandwidth and features, which can impact their ability to stream videos in higher resolutions.

### 6. **Optimize Video Metadata for Quality**
   - Include keywords in the **title**, **description**, and **tags** that emphasize the video’s quality, such as “4K,” “Ultra HD,” or “1080p.” This helps YouTube recommend the highest-quality version to viewers who are searching for high-definition content.

### 7. **Embed the Video with Quality Settings**
   - When embedding the video on a website, you can add parameters to the embed URL to encourage higher-quality playback:
     ```html
     <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/your_video_id?vq=hd1080" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
     ```
     - `vq=hd1080` specifies the desired resolution (in this case, 1080p). You can change this to `hd2160` for 4K videos.

While these steps won’t force YouTube to always play videos in their highest quality for every viewer (since internet speed, device, and settings play a role), they will maximize the chances that viewers get the highest-quality experience possible.

### Summary:
To ensure your YouTube videos show in full quality:
1. Upload the highest resolution possible.
2. Encourage users to select high quality manually.
3. Wait for YouTube to fully process videos before sharing.
4. Use end screens/annotations to promote high-quality versions.
5. Leverage metadata to emphasize the video’s quality.
6. Embed videos with custom quality settings.

You cannot force full quality, but these strategies will improve the likelihood of full-quality playback for your audience.

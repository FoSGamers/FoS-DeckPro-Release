[00:24:49] with
[00:24:53] flying you did your work for the time
[00:24:55] being you
[00:24:56] did but that's there not bad uh if you
[00:24:59] need it I can put that off to the side
[00:25:01] your name on
[00:25:03] it all
[00:25:05] right but that is uh yeah that's what we
[00:25:08] got there for some of the singles and
[00:25:09] let me um put this back
[00:25:12] here this is a Nolan pack deal let me do
[00:25:16] a uh a William pack deal coming up next
[00:25:19] year for you all and I will uh see if
[00:25:24] uh if you are interested in a William
[00:25:27] back deal
[00:25:28] we'll do another low price one from
[00:25:30] William this one we'll try to
[00:25:34] get oh the other veto oh the other veto
[00:25:37] oh no the uh I know what one you're
[00:25:40] talking about clean
[00:25:43] uh a that begins with a c I know what
[00:25:45] what you're talking about
[00:25:47] though all right that one put those on
[00:25:50] for pack deal you want it there yeah
[00:25:53] know I have um I have a I have somebody
[00:25:55] at my local game store that they said if
[00:25:57] they find one of those I have to let
[00:25:58] them
[00:26:00] know because they need it for one of
[00:26:02] their they need it for one of their
[00:26:03] decks so I'm like all right if I do I'll
[00:26:05] run into it I'll let you I'll let you
[00:26:08] know but uh just kind of going through
[00:26:10] our singles here and if you want
[00:26:12] anything I'll let me know I'll put it
[00:26:14] off the side for you that's a pack
[00:26:16] dealer right up there at the
[00:26:17] top right above it
[00:26:22] there and these are all the singles as
[00:26:25] people know things fluctuate as people
[00:26:27] have said before
[00:26:28] I think it was Big Mac was the one that
[00:26:30] was in here that made a comment like
[00:26:34] gold so if uh they aren't the same price
[00:26:37] it's because I put these on when I
[00:26:40] either first opened the pack or I
[00:26:41] started doing singles two three months
[00:26:52] ago all right that's the end of those
[00:26:55] ones and the end of that
[00:27:02] so this box here is all Doctor Who
[00:27:04] singles that is
[00:27:06] correct
[00:27:07] Dyer and if you'd like here let's do
[00:27:10] this for you if you want to try I was
[00:27:12] going to pull I told I said everybody
[00:27:14] I'd put a pole box deal up coming up
[00:27:16] next so let me do that all right I'm
[00:27:19] gonna put a pull box deal up for those
[00:27:21] that may be
[00:27:23] interested I go through some of the
[00:27:25] singles here and if you have a question
[00:27:28] uh on that Doctor Who poll box let me
[00:27:30] know but what it is it's all singles um
[00:27:33] from Doctor Who Um they are all
[00:27:38] obviously they're from collector
[00:27:39] boosters since that's all that was there
[00:27:40] were collector boosters of Doctor Who
[00:27:42] that could be open
[00:27:44] um since there were no drafts or sets or
[00:27:47] anything so that's all that's there
[00:27:48] there's a little bit of it left the high
[00:27:50] card is and everybody lives extended art
[00:27:53] foil um and then yeah
[00:28:01] [Music]
[00:28:03] because I entered when you showed the
[00:28:05] Lotus wait you
[00:28:06] entered I don't see you enter
[00:28:14] anything oh you enter the room oh oh I
[00:28:19] got confused all right oh yeah yeah no
[00:28:21] um yeah yeah yeah that's what it was no
[00:28:24] yeah we pulled out the Lotus that was um
[00:28:26] that was a pack literally a pack that we
[00:28:27] opened no problem yeah it was a pack
[00:28:29] that we opened but um yeah so Doctor Who
[00:28:31] here this pull box it's all um Doctor
[00:28:33] Who that was all all um Doctor Who col
[00:28:37] collector
[00:28:38] boosters uh there surge foils regular
[00:28:40] foils stuff like that in there same lost
[00:28:42] Caverns most of that is um actually even
[00:28:46] uh The Collector booster stuff too
[00:28:47] there's a little bit I think still in
[00:28:48] there from sets that might have been
[00:28:50] left over um but then the mystery packs
[00:28:53] are all the packs that I have mixed
[00:28:54] together into like that and that's kind
[00:28:58] of how we go
[00:28:59] there yeah not bad on the packs we do
[00:29:02] some good pack deals here I try to do
[00:29:04] them on a regular bases because like I
[00:29:07] If when I do a pack deal like I um I try
[00:29:10] to get discounts like I'm not going to
[00:29:11] pay like I If
[00:29:15] whatnot takes a fee out per each thing
[00:29:18] sold so what I try to do instead of
[00:29:21] taking that fee myself whenever I do a
[00:29:24] pack deal or something like that I end
[00:29:27] up
[00:29:31] um I end up uh taking those fees out of
[00:29:34] the pricing which is why you get a
[00:29:36] discount on everything which is why I
[00:29:37] try to do like multiple things at once
[00:29:39] so like for this instance you're G to
[00:29:41] get a collector booster of
[00:29:43] Ravnica a commander Master set and an
[00:29:46] aoria for 52 pretty good deal there now
[00:29:49] I'll keep growing through my singles for
[00:29:51] those that want to see
[00:29:53] them I think I uh finished those ones
[00:29:59] where did I put that box oh there it
[00:30:03] is and on to the next level of singles
[00:30:06] for those that may be
[00:30:09] interested let me know if you want any
[00:30:11] of these I'll put them off the side of
[00:30:12] the name on them that pack is this right
[00:30:19] here yeah we uh had some pretty good
[00:30:22] luck this morning for that person
[00:30:23] whoever just jumped in or has been
[00:30:24] hanging out in here got some good luck
[00:30:26] and pulled out a frame break Lotus out
[00:30:28] of a commander
[00:30:31] Masters uh collector booster
[00:30:33] earlier and before that we pulled out a
[00:30:37] demonic tutor and a foil um deflecting
[00:30:42] SWAT so we got some good luck with stuff
[00:30:46] today I feel like we need to keep
[00:30:47] rolling with it feel like today is the
[00:30:49] day that we pull out the serialized card
[00:30:51] though because we have this is literally
[00:30:56] box number
[00:30:59] five out of a out of my case and I've
[00:31:02] have not had a serialized card pulled
[00:31:04] out of it yet so we have uh we have some
[00:31:07] good potential coming up here for a
[00:31:09] serialized and I did tell you I'm
[00:31:11] telling I told everyone here I'm doing
[00:31:13] I'm GNA keep the other box myself if
[00:31:16] this one ends up not opening up to
[00:31:17] serialize
[00:31:20] one here we go we're going to do
[00:31:24] actually you know what we're going to
[00:31:25] put that back we're going to put that
[00:31:26] back we don't want to do that one yet

[00:35:03] it and instead they all yanked it right
[00:35:05] out of the fish's mouth every single
[00:35:07] time it's all right that's why I caught
[00:35:10] four and they caught none they'll learn
[00:35:12] eventually they'll learn eventually
[00:35:14] after going a few times they'll be like

[00:38:06] but I think what I'm going to do for a a
[00:38:09] pack deal here
[00:38:11] is let's see if anybody wants to do this
[00:38:13] we're gonna do a
[00:38:18] ravika
[00:38:20] and
[00:38:24] aoria all right we do a rabit and
[00:38:36] aoria and
[00:38:40] then we're going to call
[00:38:49] that for some doctor PS you're going get
[00:38:53] one of the doctor PS free here
[00:38:58] one set of Dr PS free if you want to try
[00:39:01] your LU on that drct box get yourself a
[00:39:04] ravnik and a Coria see if we can pull
[00:39:07] that telling you there's in one of these
[00:39:10] two boxes there's a serialized
[00:39:11] carbon oh no
[00:39:14] problem I do not have any more Kim
[00:39:17] collectors um I was baiting on buying
[00:39:19] some more because um you and somebody
[00:39:23] else were interested in them and I had
[00:39:26] bought them they only sent me one I was
[00:39:28] supposed to get two of them um but I
[00:39:31] think they only had one from the place
[00:39:32] that I got them from they must have only
[00:39:34] had one of them but I know I only got
[00:39:36] one they they what they didn't charge me
[00:39:37] for two which is fine so my guess is
[00:39:40] they only had one available but um I'll
[00:39:43] track around I did though one of the
[00:39:45] things is though um I may have found
[00:39:49] somewhere for some more
[00:39:52] um ior collector boosters so I may have
[00:39:56] found some more iori collector
[00:39:58] boosters so I I have to see what is it
[00:40:02] going an answer from tomorrow on that
[00:40:04] one and if I do I'll be pretty excited
[00:40:07] about that I'll be have a couple of
[00:40:08] collector boosters VI Coria coming in
[00:40:10] they're GNA be more expensive they were
[00:40:11] sadly they were more expensive than the
[00:40:12] last ones but they're not like $400 like
[00:40:15] some people have been asking for on
[00:40:16] online
[00:40:18] so let me do a a William pack deal here
[00:40:21] though let's do a little a little I
[00:40:24] think I did this one
[00:40:25] already
[00:40:27] I already did that one let's do this
[00:40:30] here let's do this one I think this is
[00:40:33] my
[00:40:35] last special edition Lord of the Rings
[00:40:39] unless there's one in
[00:40:41] here this is my last special edition
[00:40:44] Lord of the
[00:40:48] Rings I don't think there's any more
[00:40:50] yeah this is my last special edition
[00:40:52] Lord of the Rings I'm not going to have
[00:40:54] any more of these for a little bit
[00:40:57] at least for
[00:40:58] you dude they had in really good pulls I
[00:41:02] mean I personally I'm a giant fan of the
[00:41:05] um of the triumphs and I don't
[00:41:09] understand why others aren't it's a
[00:41:11] really they are really good cards for
[00:41:13] their value compared to like compared to
[00:41:15] getting the
[00:41:17] um like
[00:41:19] shocklands I
[00:41:21] mean same
[00:41:23] cost and you have the same opportunity
[00:41:28] yes exactly perfect for five color decks
[00:41:31] cuz like exactly that's what I like I
[00:41:33] want to do it I'm going to soup up my
[00:41:34] four colar decks with it with a couple
[00:41:37] of them make them a little bit nice so I
[00:41:39] can do that too I get a little them up
[00:41:41] to get that extra fifth color in so I
[00:41:43] was GNA make fifth color with them so uh
[00:41:46] I wanted because I want to put in blue I
[00:41:48] want to put in a few of my
[00:41:51] um my Malcolm cards that I got from uh
[00:41:54] secret lair into my d deck but I can't
[00:41:57] unless I have some Island and the aoria
[00:42:00] I've been liking the aoria because I can
[00:42:02] get
[00:42:05] multiple and I don't understand why it's
[00:42:08] uh you know it's one of those things I
[00:42:09] feel people
[00:42:13] uh yeah I know exactly I you know what
[00:42:16] though um I realized if I just wait for
[00:42:20] everybody and then have them open one
[00:42:23] have wait for every to pick one and then
[00:42:25] have my child open one at the end

[00:52:30] serialized to three serialized per case
[00:52:33] there's a few people I've only saw one
[00:52:35] serialized per case so there's a good
[00:52:37] chance that these are going to be coming
[00:52:38] out
[00:52:41] here oh what a single Walmart
[00:52:45] pack that's even better when you do the
[00:52:48] Walmart pack and you B like you what

[00:54:34] last two packs I'll make it well I'll
[00:54:37] take I'll put it as
[00:54:40] hundred $101 for the last take three

[01:18:33] but
[01:18:35] uh I don't have the luck to get it I
[01:18:37] have to have wazer pick it for me and
[01:18:39] say James pick that pack that's the pack
[01:18:41] that you're gonna get a Lotus from
[01:18:44] that's what I
[01:18:46] need so that I can pull one out because
[01:18:48] if I try to do it for myself it's not
[01:18:50] going to
[01:18:51] happen
[01:18:56] we keep throwing pacal up with singles

[01:19:31] pulled out of any of our boxes and we
[01:19:33] are down to two boxes

[01:19:55] lots of demonic tutors even I mean
[01:19:58] really good luck today I'm been jealous
[01:20:01] of the packs that have been pulled out
[01:20:03] I'm like damn I wish I had that box I
[01:20:06] know if I went and opened a box there's
[01:20:08] no way I'm gonna pull out any of that
[01:20:09] stuff so that's why it's like I can't
[01:20:11] even I I don't even want to attempt to
[01:20:13] do it because I know I'm just gonna have
[01:20:14] the bad luck and I'm not going to pull
[01:20:15] out the good
[01:20:17] things here we go I'll grab my next set
[01:20:19] of singles to look through for any of
[01:20:21] you no wants this pack deal though we'll
[01:20:24] see sudden death last second nope all
[01:20:27] right we'll put it
[01:20:30] back what are you guys doing um I know
[01:20:33] you one of you said you got this is your
[01:20:34] week off what do you uh you got any good
[01:20:37] plans for this two weeks off that you
[01:20:46] have because I know generally when I do
[01:20:49] have like time on off times I uh
[01:20:53] a lot of people will go away and do
[01:20:54] things like they'll either go hunting or
[01:20:56] maybe go on a trip somewhere that type
[01:20:58] of thing or is it just you're back with
[01:21:01] your family as a Merchant Marine type
[01:21:03] person wait you do uh Tugboat stuff
[01:21:06] maybe was it I can't remember remember I
[01:21:09] talked to somebody about doing Tugboat
[01:21:11] stuff and that would make sense for the
[01:21:13] two weeks on and two weeks off stuff my
[01:21:16] dad was going to do that before he
[01:21:17] passed
[01:21:18] away all right pack deal

[01:25:38] will say though that person that pack
[01:25:40] that they got ended up getting a really
[01:25:41] one really good card out of um out of I
[01:25:46] think they got it out of I think it was

[01:36:35] version but if you want any of these let
[01:36:37] me know we have them
[01:36:40] um as you know prices change so I put
[01:36:43] these prices on when I first open the
[01:36:45] packs or I first um get a little triy
[01:36:48] them I actually end up having two of
[01:36:50] these I put one of them out here
[01:36:52] nice triome I like the triom more than
[01:36:54] the um shocklands for some reason well
[01:36:56] it's because you get three that's
[01:36:59] why little ravenous
[01:37:05] T-Rex a not be
[01:37:08] feet
[01:37:11] chod wow allergies are really kicking in
[01:37:13] high gear down here I'm waiting for the
[01:37:16] um I'm waiting for it to start raining
[01:37:19] yellow because when it uh
[01:37:22] when everything starts to like bloom
[01:37:24] more the trees Will Rain yellow with
[01:37:28] their pollen and it is the most
[01:37:30] disgusting thing I have ever
[01:37:32] seen like my car will turn from Blue to
[01:37:39] Yellow hey well that's what I was saying
[01:37:41] to you uh Tito I've told many people uh
[01:37:45] if you the prices fluctuate I don't go
[01:37:47] and change 100 card prices every single
[01:37:49] day uh so if you're in here on a regular
[01:37:52] uh regular basis uh these were put on
[01:37:55] when I first opened the packs or I
[01:37:57] started doing the singles like two
[01:37:59] months ago um so prices change on a
[01:38:02] regular basis like I know for instance
[01:38:04] this price is I think this is $35 now so
[01:38:07] if you want it I don't sell it for 55 I
[01:38:09] end up being like we end up looking at
[01:38:10] it I just kind of scroll through you
[01:38:12] tell me what you want and then we put it
[01:38:14] we go and find the prices that are
[01:38:16] like what are available around now just
[01:38:19] because I'm not going through
[01:38:22] 100 200 singles every single
[01:38:25] day to reprice them all if that makes
[01:38:28] any sense right prices on them but I do
[01:38:30] know that they're
[01:38:31] around um this area for most of
[01:38:36] them but I'm from Florida I'm in Florida
[01:38:39] here um down here in Florida in uh vusa
[01:38:44] County
[01:38:49] Frost but that's what we uh oh and North
[01:38:53] Carolina yeah all right so you
[01:38:55] understand it's a little colder than
[01:38:57] normal down right here now

[01:39:33] maybe a Mana or something like that yeah
[01:39:36] it's nice area nice area he was a he was
[01:39:38] a boat captain though so we didn't
[01:39:40] really get to we didn't really visit it
[01:39:43] was always every time we went down it
[01:39:44] was always during like offseason so it
[01:39:46] wasn't bad during offseason there wasn't
[01:39:48] a lot of people around but at the same
[01:39:50] time it was I couldn't like really go
[01:39:51] swimming or anything like that because
[01:39:53] of how cold it was but you know it
[01:39:59] happens but if anybody wants uh let me
[01:40:02] know like I've been saying I scroll
[01:40:03] through the singles here the singles are
[01:40:05] what the prices I put on them when I
[01:40:07] either open the pack or what the prices
[01:40:09] were when I started putting singles out
[01:40:11] about two months ago so they adjust
[01:40:14] everybody should know that I mean
[01:40:15] they've gone up and down in the last
[01:40:17] three days I mean one card that I um had
[01:40:20] priced for
[01:40:21] $22 uh which was the um the um roaming
[01:40:26] throme
[01:40:27] foil uh extended art foil is now $25 so
[01:40:31] and the person got it for $22 because
[01:40:33] that's what I had it on here so my point
[01:40:35] is they fluctuate
[01:40:37] guys unless you plan on um going and
[01:40:41] adjusting 100 cards every
[01:40:43] day actually more than 100 cards
[01:40:45] probably two 300 cards every day I
[01:40:48] that's why I just scroll through them
[01:40:49] and I don't say what the prices are
[01:40:51] they're more what they are to help me
[01:40:53] know what area they were to keep them in
[01:40:56] my uh stack
[01:40:59] here but here we go
[01:41:02] anyways single scrolling through and
[01:41:04] this is the pack deal up here try
[01:41:06] yourself for your own triom
[01:41:08] maybe some uh dungeons maybe some
[01:41:12] dragons May some yourself maybe a Mana
[01:41:15] or something like that I don't know
[01:41:17] we'll
[01:41:19] see
[01:41:29] put this ones here do not want this pack
[01:41:32] deal that's okay put those over here and
[01:41:37] uh Tito as you know if you know there's
[01:41:39] um people that are here all the time
[01:41:41] that buy singles they do as a gather
[01:41:43] groups so
[01:41:46] uh if you hang out for a little while
[01:41:48] you'll see what I'm talking about where
[01:41:49] we do a pack deal we do a group of them
[01:41:52] they never sell for that
[01:41:54] generally Chen have a cresting
[01:41:59] mosasaurus
[01:42:05] oh there might be one in the Exelon box
[01:42:08] here unless I was already pulled out but
[01:42:10] let me check uh I'm not pulling it out
[01:42:12] of there
[01:42:17] uh I feel like I have a cring Mosasaurus
[01:42:23] or I had maybe I had it let me look in
[01:42:26] the box over
[01:42:28] here let me check oh not that
[01:42:31] one is this
[01:42:36] one nope not that
[01:42:44] one let's
[01:42:47] see let's see if I have
[01:42:49] one
[01:42:55] because it would be
[01:43:01] here
[01:43:05] no
[01:43:19] no no don't think I do anymore I might I
[01:43:23] might have sold that
[01:43:24] recently um if you send me a message I
[01:43:29] can take a look around and see if I have
[01:43:31] one any anywhere else because I do have
[01:43:33] some other stuff that I generally don't
[01:43:35] have out for sale that's my lost Caverns
[01:43:37] over there but I'm going to be opening
[01:43:39] up a box of it myself and I'm gonna be

[01:43:54] and I'll put it off to the side for you
[01:43:55] all right
[01:43:56] Frost that's kind of that's all I was
[01:43:58] getting at that's all I was getting at
[01:44:00] because I know I have one myself in our
[01:44:03] stuff but we were gonna open another one
[01:44:05] because my family likes Jurassic Park
[01:44:06] stuff and all that and we wanted to see
[01:44:08] what else we can get um and with that um
[01:44:12] I was going to start doing a new uh a
[01:44:13] new pull not new game like a new game
[01:44:15] instead of a pull box too with some of
[01:44:17] that stuff so that's why um just let me
[01:44:19] know uh yeah send me DM and if I find it
[01:44:22] we'll have an open one I'll let you know
[01:44:24] all

[01:44:39] one I want to see what's in the last one
[01:44:42] here let's see if somebody wants to find
[01:44:45] what's in the last one here with
[01:44:47] me let's see we're going to do
[01:44:52] let's go
[01:44:53] after
[01:44:55] this with a shock land and let's see if
[01:44:59] we can pull out a maybe we can pull out
[01:45:01] something out of the commander Masters
[01:45:02] here I'm G to pull on a little bit of a
[01:45:04] pull box deal while I uh figure this out
[01:45:07] all
[01:45:19] right
[01:45:22] I'm going to figure this pack deal out
[01:45:23] and right now the pull box deal coming
[01:45:25] up is this well I figure out the pack
[01:45:28] deal for
[01:45:40] everybody all
[01:45:47] right this is going to
[01:45:49] be
[01:46:07] oh that's
[01:46:10] wrong yeah that's what we're gonna do
[01:46:13] we're gonna do that
[01:46:17] for I want to see what's in the last
[01:46:19] pack here so we're do this for
[01:46:23] this for those
[01:46:25] three going to put this on
[01:46:32] [Music]
[01:46:33] for let's see what's in the last pack
[01:46:39] here that's what it
[01:46:41] was there you go let's see what's in
[01:46:43] that last pack somebody wants to try it
[01:46:45] out Commander Masters collector
[01:46:48] Commander Master is set and a
[01:46:51] Ravnica let's see what's in that last
[01:46:53] pack of that
[01:47:00] box no I think my chat just restarted so
[01:47:03] if anybody did say anything and I lost
[01:47:05] you I'm sorry looks like my chat
[01:47:08] restarted I don't understand why it
[01:47:10] keeps doing that to me it's actually
[01:47:12] rather
[01:47:13] frustrating here's the singles if
[01:47:15] anybody wants them like I said we um
[01:47:17] these are prices of singles fluctuate
[01:47:20] like
[01:47:21] gold as Bill as Big Mac said the other
[01:47:24] day they go up and down and all over the
[01:47:26] place I've had cars that have been
[01:47:28] higher than what I have in here I've had
[01:47:30] cars that have been lower than what I
[01:47:31] have in here so when it comes to
[01:47:34] that I'm not going to adjusting hundreds
[01:47:37] of cards every day that's why I do it
[01:47:39] the way I do here where I kind of scroll
[01:47:40] through them and then we put them off to
[01:47:42] the side and then we find out like all
[01:47:44] right they got TCG or wherever we're
[01:47:46] happen to be looking and they all right
[01:47:47] the price went down five bucks it's now
[01:47:49] this and and this and we add them
[01:47:51] together and get you a
[01:47:53] deal I'm going to put that back since no
[01:47:55] one wants the end of that pack one I'm
[01:47:57] going to end up ripping that open myself
[01:47:59] I think I think I might end up ripping
[01:48:01] that open at the end of the day day here
[01:48:03] I might end up ripping that open myself
[01:48:05] and see what happens out of it if no one
[01:48:07] does it I might take hit from the store
[01:48:09] and see what we
[01:48:15] pull I think I might do that but here we
[01:48:19] go
[01:48:21] it's face
[01:48:23] eater H getting loot I like that name
[01:48:27] that's a good name I like that name
[01:48:29] you're getting
[01:48:31] loot let's do I want to do a
[01:48:36] ravnik let's do a ravika one let's do a
[01:48:39] ravika one I know we're gonna have I'm
[01:48:44] there serialized card coming out one of
[01:48:47] these ones soon because we have only a
[01:48:51] box less than a box and a half left
[01:48:54] about a box and a half left and I have
[01:48:56] not had any serialized pulled out
[01:48:59] actually no about two boxes left
[01:49:00] actually because I have a couple of them
[01:49:01] spread out in here about two boxes left
[01:49:04] and we have not had a serialized pulled
[01:49:06] out of the case
[01:49:08] so we have good off good chances here
[01:49:12] for it good chances for
[01:49:18] it boom hey Zach how you doing
[01:49:23] pop Red Devil red evil thanks for coming
[01:49:27] in just running a little bit of a pack
[01:49:29] deal and I'm going to scroll through
[01:49:30] some of my uh singles here as people
[01:49:34] know single prices fluctuate so much
[01:49:37] that this is just really the uh the
[01:49:39] closest that they were at the time I put
[01:49:41] them on and that could have been a week
[01:49:44] ago that could have been a month ago
[01:49:46] that could have been three months ago
[01:49:47] when I wrote the prices down on these so
[01:49:49] this is obviously with the how they
[01:49:53] fluctuate we have to take a look but if
[01:49:54] you want any of them I'll put them off
[01:49:55] to the side with your name on it and
[01:49:57] we'll uh figure out how much they are I
[01:50:00] do this all the time ask anybody else
[01:50:03] that comes and hangs out with
[01:50:05] me no one wanted that pack deal which is
[01:50:09] okay I'm gonna put that

[01:51:11] add them up the end orjust them if you
[01:51:14] know as you see the last time I wrote
[01:51:16] the price on this this you what used to
[01:51:18] be
[01:51:18] $2.50 but then I wrote it on after I got
[01:51:21] another one out and it went down to $2
[01:51:23] so I don't even know what it is now but
[01:51:24] that's the point of what I'm kind of
[01:51:25] getting at is prices of all this stuff
[01:51:27] fluctuate and that's only what's written
[01:51:29] on here is for me to know what it was
[01:51:32] when I first pulled it
[01:51:35] out or I first started doing singles for
[01:51:37] you guys because you kept asking for

[02:04:47] so I have all but
[02:04:50] one was taken out of foodborne but
[02:04:52] purchased and I have one two
[02:04:58] three I have six eight of of larana
[02:05:04] chapter one that are
[02:05:07] there yeah dude that's a70 I know s
[02:05:10] guarding ship is a good a as a big one
[02:05:13] dude but and and Jack John that's what I
[02:05:17] got there for um but not that has been
[02:05:19] pulled out for
[02:05:20] enchanted no um we have not done any of
[02:05:24] that but we do have flood borne in first
[02:05:26] chapter there if you are interested in
[02:05:28] it I'll put that right over here
[02:05:30] actually for those that may be
[02:05:32] interested and I'm gonna try to see if I
[02:05:34] can get any
[02:05:36] more do you remember what I hit in the
[02:05:39] first chapter oh it's been a while since
[02:05:41] we started opening them
[02:05:47] um
[02:05:50] I'm trying to think I think the most
[02:05:52] recent thing that I remember was maybe a
[02:05:57] genie one of the Genies out of it but I
[02:06:00] don't I can't remember anything else
[02:06:02] trying to think it's been like I've had
[02:06:03] that box quite literally
[02:06:10] for since two months after lurana came
[02:06:13] out that box has been sitting there
[02:06:15] legendaries legendaries oh um
[02:06:19] I think I've hit out of that box I think
[02:06:21] there might have been like four
[02:06:22] legendaries four legendaries that were
[02:06:24] hit but nothing that was like over the
[02:06:25] top ones um I think there was a
[02:06:35] um there was a couple of uh the um
[02:06:40] what's
[02:06:43] the Musketeers there's a Musketeers one
[02:06:46] that was hit uh then there was a genie
[02:06:50] one that was hit there was a I think
[02:06:54] there was Captain Hook that was hit out
[02:06:57] of it I'm trying to think back over like
[02:06:59] six months of this so I'm sorry if I'm
[02:07:00] not getting them
[02:07:01] all
[02:07:04] um trying to think if there was any
[02:07:06] others that were hit that I can think
[02:07:09] of
[02:07:16] um and and and the genie is the last
[02:07:20] ones because that was like a few weeks
[02:07:26] back but I haven't had anything else big
[02:07:28] there's not there hasn't been anything
[02:07:30] like um oh there might have been oh the
[02:07:33] cruel DeVille Kell DeVille was the other
[02:07:35] one that I can think
[02:07:37] of the rest of the first chapter
[02:07:40] once okay um you know what I'll do
[02:07:43] that I'll do that so you want all one
[02:07:47] two three four five six seven eight you
[02:07:51] want all eight of them um hold on a
[02:07:54] second I can do that let me do this for

[02:08:11] those I will do those
[02:08:17] for
[02:08:21] want to say 68 for instead
[02:08:25] of I think it would be
[02:08:32] 70 instead of 72 we'll do 68 want to do
[02:08:36] that for them all that's pretty much
[02:08:37] half off one of the packs

[03:10:53] packs right
[03:10:55] here with an ion
[03:10:59] one we're going to call that we're going
[03:11:01] to give you one of the one pretty much
[03:11:03] six three poles of them free we're going

[03:11:15] AR rabn and aoria in six Exelon pulse
[03:11:20] let's see if we can get um that galta
[03:11:23] out of there maybe somebody wants that
[03:11:25] stany
[03:11:26] Tyrant standard
[03:11:30] art I don't know there's not much left
[03:11:33] in here as you
[03:11:35] see as you can see I don't know how it
[03:11:37] hasn't been pulled out well I do know
[03:11:38] how because the thrasios was pulled out
[03:11:40] and that was a high card that's why we
[03:11:42] have not many people been pack been
[03:11:44] grabbing anything from here but this is
[03:11:46] all we have left in that Bo in that box
[03:11:48] of
[03:11:49] ion so there's a good chance there for
[03:11:52] you to
[03:11:52] get galta out of that if you
[03:11:56] want plus some other draft Park cards
[03:11:59] that are in
[03:12:00] there all righty no one one of that
[03:12:04] we've been wanting to see if we get a
[03:12:05] serialize out of here so we're going to
[03:12:08] put that back there's literally three
[03:12:09] packs left there that's crazy that's
[03:12:16] insane I'm still thoroughly confused on
[03:12:18] how we have not pulled the serialized
[03:12:23] out hey s
[03:12:28] cide thanks coming in hanging
[03:12:31] out I'm going to put on
[03:12:38] um let's do a William pack deal here for
[03:12:41] you
[03:12:45] let's do a William Pacquiao maybe he
[03:12:47] picked out the one that
[03:12:50] has maybe he was the one that picked out
[03:12:52] the um the serialized one out of that
[03:12:55] box maybe that's why it's not in there
[03:12:56] maybe it's one of these
[03:13:00] ones that box is number five out of the
[03:13:03] case by the way this is box number five
[03:13:06] out of the case I have not pulled any
[03:13:08] serial eyes out of the box um there are
[03:13:11] three of that are in the pack deals here
[03:13:14] though that my sons had pulled out to
[03:13:15] put pack deals so who knows maybe it's
[03:13:17] one of those three but then I do have
[03:13:19] the other box left and since uh no
[03:13:21] serial eyes get pulled out here I'm
[03:13:23] probably G to do a box opening of some
[03:13:26] Ravnica
[03:13:28] myself a little YouTube box opening
[03:13:30] video Ravnica collector there all right
[03:13:33] gonna go to ravnik collector I like it
[03:13:37] we're going to put this back since no
[03:13:38] one wanted that pack heal that's
[03:13:40] okay I think I put that pack up but if I
[03:13:44] didn't I'm
[03:13:46] sorry all
[03:13:47] right we're going to go we have
[03:13:51] one two three so now if you want I can
[03:13:55] switch it out with any of the ones that
[03:13:56] are here that the boys picked out so
[03:13:58] there's one
[03:14:02] here I think there's one right
[03:14:04] here that they picked out and then I
[03:14:06] think there's one over here that was
[03:14:09] pulled out so if you want you can pull
[03:14:11] one of these ones instead
[03:14:17] oh oh there's one yeah there'll be three
[03:14:19] of those in there so you can gra one of
[03:14:20] those three if you want or any of the
[03:14:23] ones that obviously that are in here I
[03:14:25] me know what you want to

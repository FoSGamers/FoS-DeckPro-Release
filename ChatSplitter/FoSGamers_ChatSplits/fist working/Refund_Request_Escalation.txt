Subject: Re: Item#315747058722 - Refund Request

Dear eBay Support,

Thank you for your response. However, your reply is deeply unsatisfactory. The seller has not provided tracking information or any proof of shipment for the item in question (Magic: The Gathering Ravnica Remastered Collector Booster Box). Your response simply asks for more patience while protecting a seller who has shown no evidence of honesty or fulfillment of their obligation.

It is not my responsibility to wait indefinitely or play detective while eBay shelters a scammer. Please escalate this matter immediately and process my refund. If this issue is not resolved promptly, I will have no choice but to explore further actions.

Do the right thing—refund my payment and ensure your platform does not enable fraudulent sellers.

Sincerely,  
James

I already sent this, and have another thing sent saying that, um... They have lied to me in their chat multiple times. They said I was supposed to have it received already, and that if I didn't receive it, I should check with my neighbors because somebody stole it. Then they told me, like, Oh, wait, we haven't got it sent to you yet. That it has been transferred to Amazon for delivery. Like, who the fuck transfers to Amazon for delivery? What the fuck is going on here? Can you stop having me... Can you please handle this and stop letting these lying, scamming motherfuckers take my money? Do your fucking job.

Subject: Re: Item#315747058722 - Immediate Action Required  

Dear eBay Support,  

I am appalled by the lack of action and the lies I’ve been subjected to regarding this transaction. The seller has blatantly contradicted themselves multiple times in our communications. First, they claimed I should have received the item and suggested my neighbors might have stolen it. Then, they stated it hadn't been sent yet and was allegedly "transferred to Amazon for delivery"—a completely bizarre and implausible excuse.  

This is beyond ridiculous. eBay has a responsibility to protect buyers from fraudulent activity, and this seller’s behavior is a textbook case of scamming. I demand immediate action:  

1. Refund my payment in full without further delay.  
2. Investigate this seller and prevent them from deceiving others on your platform.  

Stop passing the buck and allowing these blatant scammers to abuse your marketplace. Do your job and resolve this NOW.  

Sincerely,  
James

[00:00:38] day
[00:00:39] with. My stuff is a little disorganized
[00:00:41] here. Why is it all backwards? Damn it.
[00:00:45] I knew something looked off and I was
[00:00:46] trying to figure out why. Now starting
[00:00:48] to read. I know why.
[00:00:54] Ready? Oh, we're
[00:00:57] right. There we go. That looks better.
[00:01:00] Sorry about that for a second. No wonder
[00:01:02] why it was a little
[00:01:03] confusing. There you go. Got that out
[00:01:06] there if anybody wants throwing those
[00:01:07] out there. Hey Wazer, how's it going my
[00:01:09] friend? I haven't seen you in a bit.
[00:01:11] How's the um how are the
[00:01:14] hives? Hopefully you're doing well. I
[00:01:16] know there's been some w weather all
[00:01:17] over the place. So uh I don't know if
[00:01:19] that if it's been bad where you were
[00:01:20] that you had some issues. How's it
[00:01:21] going, Big? How your day doing?
[00:01:26] Hopefully you're having a good uh good
[00:01:27] morning
[00:01:33] here. But yeah, we got some uh Dexton
[00:01:36] here and I want to let people know. So I
[00:01:38] put one out there for uh little discount
[00:01:40] this morning to start it out for the
[00:01:42] day. Pretty much get you close to free
[00:01:44] shipping. It is 7 a.m. where I am big.
[00:01:49] So, just so you're aware, that's uh
[00:01:52] we're on the east
[00:01:53] coast.
[00:01:55] So, life on the boat. Um it's
[00:01:58] intriguing. It's been fun so far. We're
[00:02:00] stuck in Florida for a little bit cuz
[00:02:01] we're waiting for our arch, which will
[00:02:04] be delivered Monday or Tuesday, which so
[00:02:07] come Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursdayish,
[00:02:09] I'll probably not be on just because I
[00:02:11] have to install an arch on our boat. Um,
[00:02:14] and then once that's done, I'm going to
[00:02:16] be put uh I will I'll run again the same
[00:02:18] as normal. Um, but I'm trying to try to
[00:02:21] get some upgrades done to the show. Some
[00:02:24] intriguing things I wanted to try and
[00:02:26] upgrade some of the uh the show in some
[00:02:29] ways. So, uh I was going to uh take that
[00:02:32] time off when I'm not doing on it when I
[00:02:35] need a break or anything to do a little
[00:02:36] uh upgrading versus just nothing hanging
[00:02:39] around.
[00:02:40] But we got some stuff today. I just ran
[00:02:43] in one of these. I figured it was a
[00:02:44] discount if anybody comes in in the
[00:02:46] morning and wants to look at any of
[00:02:47] them. Hopefully your mornings are going
[00:02:49] okay. We are just getting running.
[00:02:53] Things are up and going. Uh is it not
[00:02:56] working anywhere? Says it is. Uh looks
[00:02:58] like it's
[00:02:59] going. I'm going to say it's
[00:03:04] working. I do not have infinity
[00:03:06] collector boosters. I have infinity
[00:03:08] draft uh draft boosters, but that would
[00:03:10] be the only thing that I have on those
[00:03:11] right now. I have a whole box of those,
[00:03:13] too. So, like I have a brand new box
[00:03:15] plus what I have left here. So, I mean,
[00:03:17] I do have a good chunk of that stuff,
[00:03:19] but uh I have have not had any uh
[00:03:21] Unfinity ones for a little bit. They
[00:03:24] went up in price a while back and I
[00:03:26] didn't have the
[00:03:29] um I don't feel like having to sell them
[00:03:32] for as much as you'd have to. Newest set
[00:03:34] that we have out would be Aether Drift
[00:03:36] here. That's a pretty fun one. We've had
[00:03:38] some of this uh one of the things that
[00:03:39] one of the uh I don't know if you know
[00:03:42] uh house but he he uh he pointed out
[00:03:44] that the cards kind of looked like
[00:03:47] um be buttthead ones and I'm like ever
[00:03:49] since then I'm like yep that that kind
[00:03:50] of do some of the uh some of like their
[00:03:52] special ones their uh you know their
[00:03:54] what do you call it ones the um
[00:03:58] [Â __Â ] showcase ones the borderless
[00:04:00] ones there but yeah the newest set would
[00:04:03] be this here you know what actually hold
[00:04:04] on I've had this sitting over there we
[00:04:07] did not count this when we were making
[00:04:08] my count cuz I forgot about it. So,
[00:04:11] we're going to just open this up and see
[00:04:13] what we get. But this is what where the
[00:04:15] new aether drift would
[00:04:17] be. Not a bad
[00:04:20] set. Let's see. We got one, two, three,
[00:04:23] four, five, six, seven, eight. Cuz we
[00:04:26] need some rares anyways to put in for um
[00:04:28] giveaways since we already uh we're down
[00:04:31] to not having any. So, we're going to
[00:04:33] have to take a look and take zoom see
[00:04:35] what we have here. We're going to zoom
[00:04:36] zoom. Take a look here. Hopefully we get
[00:04:38] something nice.
[00:04:40] Swamp. Autoarch
[00:04:42] mammoth. Embombed ascendant. Back on
[00:04:46] track. Wreck remover. Beast rider.
[00:04:49] Vanguard. Hull drifter. Broadcast
[00:04:53] rambler. Skybox ferry and the
[00:04:56] bordalless. All right. I like that's a
[00:04:58] new one. Ripclaw Wrangler. I don't see
[00:04:59] that much for a foil borderless.
[00:05:03] Mendicant core guidelite for the first
[00:05:07] rare. Priest of the crossing for an
[00:05:11] extended
[00:05:17] art. And then we have a Zahor Glory's
[00:05:21] Pass. Ooh, I like that.
[00:05:25] Borderless. And a bright glass Gearhulk.
[00:05:28] That's actually the first time I've seen
[00:05:30] that one. Nice there.
[00:05:33] Oh, there we go. Ganty, knight of
[00:05:36] minister. Nice foil.
[00:05:40] Borderless. There we go with a golem
[00:05:43] token. I like that. Ganty. Whenever a
[00:05:46] player casts a spell they don't own,
[00:05:48] that player creates a treasure token.
[00:05:50] Whenever a creature deals combat damage
[00:05:53] to one of your opponents, its controller
[00:05:55] looks at the top of that opponent's
[00:05:57] library and exiles it face down. They
[00:05:59] may play that card for as long as it
[00:06:00] remains exiled. Mana of any type can be
[00:06:04] spent to cast this cast a spell this
[00:06:06] way. Not bad. I like it. Wazer went in
[00:06:10] for a few of them. Foil heartlands. I am
[00:06:13] too. I have to say I I agree. I agree.
[00:06:15] Let me uh let me jump in here and uh
[00:06:18] take a look at that for you, my friend.
[00:06:21] Jumped in some Lost Caverns. I like it.
[00:06:24] All right, let me get you. Yeah, I know
[00:06:25] the foil lands are really nice. I always
[00:06:27] it's it's nice to spice your deck up
[00:06:29] with some foil lands, you know, make it
[00:06:31] to look nice and pretty. All right, let
[00:06:33] me get you that uh Lost Caverns out. And
[00:06:36] let's see if we can get you uh a a foil
[00:06:39] stamped. I have yet to pull one out. I
[00:06:42] pulled one out a lot like within the
[00:06:43] first couple weeks of having them. And
[00:06:46] since then, I've not gotten one of the
[00:06:48] foil stamps. So, that being
[00:06:52] said, I'd like to pull another one soon
[00:06:54] here.
[00:06:57] All right. So, I'm going to put these
[00:06:59] over here with my uh these these ones
[00:07:02] are my Where's my car? Ah, there they
[00:07:05] are. There they are. All right. Here we
[00:07:11] go. Um I I don't know. I'll take a look
[00:07:14] for it. Yeah, but if it is, I can
[00:07:15] possibly do that for you. Uh let me put
[00:07:17] that out of the way. No one was going
[00:07:19] with those. Here's those little just
[00:07:20] Hey, try it out in the morning here.
[00:07:22] We'll put that right there for now. and
[00:07:24] we're going to open your pack. Sound
[00:07:26] good, Wizzer? We always went with
[00:07:27] opening your stuff. I like it. Yeah, I
[00:07:29] can take a look for that
[00:07:30] one. Let me double check on it. I don't
[00:07:33] think I'm going to use it, but uh so
[00:07:35] that's fine with me.
[00:07:39] Big. Oh, yeah. TCG. Yeah, that's what I
[00:07:42] use. So, that would be if that's what
[00:07:44] it's saying, we're good. Thank you,

[00:08:26] There you go. How's it to tide bender in
[00:08:30] the show in the showcase borderless one
[00:08:31] or the what? I think that's showcase

[00:09:31] I don't always I don't have the uh I
[00:09:34] used to have a nice app that would allow
[00:09:35] me to uh track it gives some you know
[00:09:38] fun stuff and chat and things like that.
[00:09:40] Do some chat games. All of a sudden we
[00:09:42] when we lost that we lost some fun stuff
[00:09:45] here. But let me get this all together
[00:09:46] for you. I'm going to put those in a top
[00:09:48] loader. We're going to get
[00:09:51] you together. Oh, my hands are cold.
[00:09:53] It's a cold morning here. And when we
[00:09:55] got up I had to get up and start
[00:09:57] everything. So, my hands are all cold
[00:10:00] from uh getting up and and doing all
[00:10:02] that cuz being on the boat, we're just
[00:10:03] in we're in Florida and it was like 49
[00:10:05] degrees. Wasn't in the boat, but it was
[00:10:08] like 66 or something I think it said or
[00:10:12] 65. But still, that's cold for me. I
[00:10:15] don't like that. My fingers were fingers
[00:10:17] were

[00:11:00] low temperature when I lived up in New
[00:11:02] Hampshire. Um because it was just like
[00:11:05] it was always so hot there. Why am I
[00:11:07] going to Why am I going to do anything
[00:11:08] different? What is this? Oh, that's old.
[00:11:11] That doesn't work. Um so I'm like we got

[00:11:17] 65. I always try to keep it my wife was
[00:11:19] like yelling at me. So we always we'd
[00:11:22] keep it a little bit warmer, but I try
[00:11:23] to keep it low low in the high 60s
[00:11:25] because it was cold and we need to cool
[00:11:27] off. Now it's like uh being down in

[00:16:36] always shows me. So, there we go. There
[00:16:37] you go. Look at that. You got lucky. You
[00:16:39] got the uh rare right away. And we have
[00:16:42] a pack of uh Outlaws for our buddy here.

[00:16:57] to open and see what you get for an
[00:17:00] auction
[00:17:05] here. What pack was $12? You didn't buy
[00:17:08] one for $12. Is this shipping that is
[00:17:16] somehow is that the only problem? That
[00:17:18] the only thing I can think of.
[00:17:23] Ah, well now if you grab something else,
[00:17:26] it's not going to hit you as hard cuz it
[00:17:28] already did hit you. If that makes any

[00:17:39] you and I'll put that uh get pick out
[00:17:42] which one you want. Now, it looks like

[00:17:46] the bottom here. So, I might have to
[00:17:47] straighten these
[00:17:49] out. Like that probably went there. That
[00:17:52] stays there. Uh-oh. Those go over there.
[00:17:57] Uh-oh. I don't know what happened
[00:18:02] here. Looks like one side's a little
[00:18:04] higher. All right. I'm guessing that
[00:18:06] might have been it. All right. We're

[00:18:54] of spoilers in these packs. I think it's
[00:18:56] only three or four, but from the uh
[00:18:58] collector boosters, I know there's
[00:18:59] always eight, so that's why we trying to

[00:25:00] Tamir was the deck that my wife was
[00:25:02] looking at. I know. I was looking at a
[00:25:03] couple of them. I haven't decided really
[00:25:05] which ones I want out of them yet. We
[00:25:07] ended up buying the four of them. We
[00:25:09] only bought one of the I mean the five
[00:25:11] of them and we only bought one. I'm like
[00:25:13] I'm I don't know if I should have bought
[00:25:14] two because my all my kids want one. My
[00:25:17] wife wants one. I'm like god damn it.
[00:25:18] That means I'm going to have one. I want
[00:25:19] one too. So that means we probably have
[00:25:21] to buy another one. so the store can
[00:25:22] have some. But I don't know. We'll find
[00:25:25] out. That was a hit for you, Big. That
[00:25:28] was the hit there for you,
[00:25:30] Big. Now, I think I uh Let me um get my
[00:25:35] sheet over here. Let's see what was
[00:25:37] going on. Your
[00:25:42] character, Big
[00:25:46] B. Let me do this here.
[00:25:51] or did I have a new
[00:25:59] one? I think I
[00:26:04] did. I did have a new
[00:26:06] column. Jas Sky. Ah, yeah. That's a good
[00:26:10] one. Outlaws. I'm nice. I'm happy you're

[00:26:16] I mean, big BK.
[00:26:21] We're going to
[00:26:22] go. We got all that, I think, spread out
[00:26:25] over here. All right. I think we got you
[00:26:27] in here. All right. If not, if I need to
[00:26:28] adjust something, I made an I had to try
[00:26:30] to have something try to make the uh
[00:26:32] stuff a little bit better for
[00:26:34] me so I can make see it
[00:26:38] easier. And uh I think it worked for me,
[00:26:42] but give me one
[00:26:45] second. I thought I had it here.
[00:26:49] Oh, I saved it on the other computer.
[00:26:52] Damn it. I don't know if I opened it on
[00:26:54] this one and saved it here. Did
[00:26:57] I? Oh,
[00:26:59] no. Did I not do
[00:27:04] it? I might not have done that
[00:27:07] here.
[00:27:09] A Well, all right. Using the old
[00:27:13] cheat. So, you have a pistol, knife,
[00:27:16] plasma rifle, your AR, and your
[00:27:20] flamethrower.
[00:27:21] Um, and you also have a map fragment,
[00:27:24] and a Gatling gun now that you picked
[00:27:26] up. So, you got gatling gun, a
[00:27:30] flamethrower, and you also picked up,
[00:27:34] come
[00:27:35] on, your map fragment. Now, you got a
[00:27:39] couple of those if I remember right. And
[00:27:41] you got a few Pogs. Not many, though.
[00:27:44] You got 34. You got 34 pogs. You got
[00:27:47] 34. Yes, you have two pieces of the map
[00:27:51] now. Yes, I stream on YouTube also.
[00:27:56] Um, the salt eye is like, see, I like to
[00:27:59] they they see the so many of like, oh, I
[00:28:01] like this, I like that, I like this, I
[00:28:02] like that. I don't know which one I want
[00:28:03] to look
[00:28:06] at. Yeah, the alt are
[00:28:09] nice. So, you my friend, you get to
[00:28:11] decide.
[00:28:13] Now, you had access to uh who was it?
[00:28:15] You went to the locked room. Are you
[00:28:16] going to go visit our buddy in the
[00:28:18] locked room
[00:28:19] here today? I was guessing that's what
[00:28:22] you're going to
[00:28:24] do since I know Big had um had a friend
[00:28:29] earlier over here and he had met up with
[00:28:33] in the locked room for
[00:28:37] us. Yeah, I've been looking at a few
[00:28:39] different ones. I got them all. They're
[00:28:41] mainly for the store, but I get So, but
[00:28:43] we can
[00:28:46] choose. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's why I
[00:28:49] have a multiream. It goes to Twi Twitch,
[00:28:52] X, and YouTube. So, yeah. So, I'm
[00:28:55] hanging out on all those places with all
[00:28:57] you guys. I think there's like uh a few
[00:29:00] people on YouTube, a couple people on X,
[00:29:02] and Twitch and stuff like that. So, not
[00:29:03] bad. All
[00:29:05] right.
[00:29:07] Yeah. So, you got to decide what you're
[00:29:09] going to do. you made a comment you
[00:29:10] wanted to upgrade. Was it one of these
[00:29:12] things that you're going to think of
[00:29:12] upgrading? I'm
[00:29:15] guessing. And then remember everybody,
[00:29:17] we have our uh our break. I'll pin that
[00:29:19] right now if you guys
[00:29:22] want. All right. You want to upgrade the
[00:29:24] gat? The
[00:29:26] gat. All right. Now, I will put out
[00:29:30] um something for a You know what? We'll
[00:29:33] do this.
[00:29:49] Why is that not in
[00:30:00] there? Oh, there it is. That's so weird.
[00:30:09] Oh, that's
[00:30:14] why supposed to be that. Why say box?
[00:30:17] That's
[00:30:21] crazy. All right, there we go. Let me
[00:30:24] correct that. There, that looks
[00:30:28] better. All right, give it a little bit
[00:30:30] of time here to figure out what we're
[00:30:31] doing.
[00:30:33] Yes. You want to upgrade? All right.
[00:30:35] Yeah. Well, I mean, you have some stuff
[00:30:36] you can you can throw at the guy. Be
[00:30:37] like, "Hey, I'm going to give you uh
[00:30:38] some of your pogs. There's 34 you got.
[00:30:40] What do you want to do to your upgrade?"
[00:30:42] I mean, he he's a pretty pretty um
[00:30:45] capable person here to do some upgrades
[00:30:48] for you. This uh shopkeeper we have, let
[00:30:52] me see, what was his name? I think I
[00:30:53] have it written down here.
[00:31:07] We have
[00:31:13] uh Oh, maybe I didn't put his name
[00:31:17] down. Oh, I did. I did. I did. That's
[00:31:20] Schmidt. That's Schmidt.
[00:31:26] Schmidy. Ooh, augment it like an
[00:31:29] element. Hm. Schmidy. Smitty's thinking
[00:31:32] I don't know if I can augment it like an
[00:31:34] element. You mean like you want to have
[00:31:35] like a fire, you know, incendiary
[00:31:37] bullets type thing. Is that what you're
[00:31:41] thinking? Cuz if that's what you're
[00:31:43] thinking, I might be able to pull
[00:31:44] something like that off. Um, so yeah.
[00:31:47] Yeah, if you want to leave it here,
[00:31:48] it'll be it'll be at least a couple of
[00:31:50] turns. Uh, a couple of days here. So, a
[00:31:51] couple turns. We'll say couple days. And
[00:31:54] um let's see for Gat Gat
[00:32:02] upgrade
[00:32:04] incendiary that would probably be um 25
[00:32:07] Pogs at
[00:32:09] least. What do you
[00:32:12] think? Schmidy says, "What do you think
[00:32:16] there?" Shout out from all the YouTube.
[00:32:18] This is like an ongoing story you tell

[00:35:14] to the dragons, especially with uh Takar
[00:35:16] coming out.
[00:35:23] Tear. All right, my friend. All right.
[00:35:27] Well, you leave your stuff
[00:35:29] there. You and your character go for a
[00:35:32] little uh adventure through the
[00:35:34] wasteland. You're wandering
[00:35:37] around. You're seeing different burntout
[00:35:41] buildings.
[00:35:43] Uh then where is that one? You see a
[00:35:46] little bit bit of a city there. You get
[00:35:48] the edge of the city where they're doing
[00:35:49] some work. Great memories from the set.
[00:35:51] Ah
[00:35:54] yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the Norse mythology is
[00:35:57] a nice one. I had a good time with that.
[00:35:58] It's one of those ones where it's like
[00:36:02] a if they go back to it that land, I I
[00:36:05] wouldn't mind seeing it again, you
[00:36:10] know. All righty. So, we're going to uh
[00:36:14] see your character is wandering around
[00:36:15] there and you happen to come
[00:36:24] across this gentleman here uh and one of
[00:36:28] the edges of it. Now, he looks like he
[00:36:31] has some wares in his back back closet
[00:36:34] there. You don't really
[00:36:36] know where those wares are or what those
[00:36:39] wares are doing. So,
[00:36:42] I need
[00:36:44] you to decide if you want to like attack
[00:36:47] him or do you want and try to like rob
[00:36:49] them or do you want to maybe barter with
[00:36:50] him? Let's talk with him. All right,
[00:36:51] we're going to talk. I like it. So, you
[00:36:54] decide you're going to talk. That's a
[00:36:55] good choice. Our buddy here, we're going
[00:36:57] to have to think of a name for him.
[00:36:58] Anybody have a name for this dude? We
[00:37:00] don't have a name yet for
[00:37:02] him. We have to get a name for him.
[00:37:11] What's he look like? Anyone? Bartalule.
[00:37:14] Oh, gonna Bart. I like it. We can go
[00:37:17] with Bart. Bartholomew. This is his full
[00:37:20] name, but he goes by Bart. I like
[00:37:26] it. I like it. Bartalu. And his Bart
[00:37:30] here. Bart goes, "Hey guys, what are you
[00:37:33] doing here? This is my end of the town.
[00:37:39] You you just stand there and you look at
[00:37:40] him. What are you going to
[00:37:42] say? We'll run uh we'll run we'll pin
[00:37:45] the brake here. Oh, I did have that
[00:37:46] pinned actually. Aha. So, if you guys
[00:37:48] want to jump in, there's uh six bots.
[00:37:51] Lots of fun stuff in the break today so
[00:37:52] you guys can see it. Ready? I'm going to
[00:37:55] put the car this away while our buddy
[00:37:56] decides what it's going to do. We have
[00:37:57] Fyrexia, Caldime, IIcoria, some nice uh
[00:38:01] maybe get yourself a a nice uh um my
[00:38:04] brain is breaking right now. Godzilla,
[00:38:07] some modern masters 2017, aether drift
[00:38:10] collector, foundations collector. Oo,
[00:38:12] maybe some more good luck with that. And
[00:38:13] then the storm rainbow foil secret
[00:38:18] layer. Now, the way we do the secret
[00:38:20] layer is we open it up, we put them in
[00:38:21] sleeves, shuffle it up, and uh hand six
[00:38:23] of them out. And if there's one left
[00:38:25] over, we put it in the rest of the cards
[00:38:26] that we shuffle up and hand out. The
[00:38:28] reason for that is that way it
[00:38:29] guarantees everybody one of the secret
[00:38:31] layer from there at least. All right.
[00:38:33] Triomes. Oh, yes. Some triomes are
[00:38:39] nice. What all do I have? Oh, all right.
[00:38:41] Well, um, we have some interesting
[00:38:43] things here now. Um, I have a uh I have
[00:38:47] a critical hit. I I'd found that that
[00:38:50] dangling around somewhere. Um, I have a
[00:38:52] I have a few uh plus 10 health packs.
[00:38:54] They're not full ones. They're only half
[00:38:56] health packs. Then, um, we got some
[00:39:00] assault rifle ammo. I have a
[00:39:04] pistol. I uh I also have this this thing
[00:39:07] here. It's a I don't really know what it
[00:39:09] is. It's some type of chip. It's an
[00:39:10] implant. I haven't really decided I was
[00:39:12] going to use it yet. I'm not really sure
[00:39:14] what it is, but uh you can try that. But
[00:39:16] yeah, that's what uh that's what we got
[00:39:18] here with us. I can pick other things
[00:39:20] up, though. I'm pretty good at finding
[00:39:22] stuff. Bart can find things
[00:39:25] easily. Oh, a banner of kinship. I like
[00:39:28] it, my friend. Let me get that out for
[00:39:30] you. That is a really good pickup. I
[00:39:32] have one oursel myself. So, we kept one
[00:39:37] of them our myself, but there you go, my
[00:39:39] friend. Banner of
[00:39:42] kinship. Ooh, the chip.
[00:39:45] H. Well, that chip that chip took me a
[00:39:48] bit to uh bit to get there. So, you're
[00:39:50] going to have to
[00:39:51] uh So, you're going to have to do
[00:39:53] something for me along with
[00:39:58] uh
[00:40:01] getting the
[00:40:03] um purchasing it here. So, I I'll give
[00:40:06] it to you, but you have to first go and
[00:40:09] help. I've been having some
[00:40:12] problems with a bunch of rats in the
[00:40:15] junkyard that I keep trying trying to
[00:40:17] scavenge through. So, if uh you can go
[00:40:18] over there and help me,
[00:40:21] um I'll give you the chip, but it's
[00:40:22] going to be 25 Pogs or we can trade some
[00:40:25] for it. It's up to you. It's up to you.
[00:40:28] Your
[00:40:29] choice. But we have a Calheim. We'll
[00:40:31] throw, you know, we'll throw out another
[00:40:32] pack here. Who else wants to go and go
[00:40:34] some packs? You have an extra AR? That
[00:40:37] could help me. That could help me, he
[00:40:40] says. H All right, that could
[00:40:42] potentially
[00:40:44] work. All right. Well, if that might
[00:40:47] work, let's say,
[00:40:54] uh, let's do this
[00:40:58] here. All right, I can do that. AR AR
[00:41:03] and uh, we'll say 10 pogs and an AR. I
[00:41:08] can do a trade like that. And uh, but
[00:41:10] you have to go and kill those uh, those
[00:41:12] rats for me. I I don't want to have to
[00:41:14] deal with them.
[00:41:15] I'll take over I'll take the leftovers
[00:41:17] if they don't aren't much left, but uh I
[00:41:19] need you to go and deal with most of
[00:41:20] them. All right. All right. You'll take
[00:41:23] over the rats. All right. All right.
[00:41:24] Cool. Cool. All right. Thank you, my
[00:41:26] friend. So, you go
[00:41:29] wandering through this there. You go to
[00:41:31] a
[00:41:32] uh you find the edge of the small town
[00:41:35] area at the edge where you wander in and
[00:41:38] you see bunch of junkyard
[00:41:41] rats wandering around. Now, they're only
[00:41:44] five health, but you shoot one, you
[00:41:46] don't know what they're going to start
[00:41:47] to
[00:41:48] uh ravage their way through all of a
[00:41:51] sudden. Now, we have discount if you
[00:41:53] guys can see. Threw that out there. Some
[00:41:54] aether dip packs if you want to jump on
[00:41:57] them. So, you got to decide what are you
[00:42:00] going to do with those? You going to you
[00:42:02] going to you going to attack? You going
[00:42:03] to kind of stay? You going to run away?
[00:42:06] Well, I don't know. I don't know, my
[00:42:08] friend. All right. I'm going to uh take
[00:42:10] a drink of coffee here.
[00:42:17] But let me take a look here. Yeah, like
[00:42:20] I said, if you purchase a pack, you can
[00:42:22] have me open it if you you can have me
[00:42:24] ship it home, too. Some people ask me to
[00:42:25] ship them, but
[00:42:27] yeah, that's what we
[00:42:32] do. Then I have to put some in here.
[00:42:50] No, that's the wrong place. I wonder why
[00:42:53] I'm not finding
[00:42:58] it. All
[00:43:00] right. Hey, Mystic. Good morning. Good
[00:43:02] morning, my friend. Hey, Dwayne. How's
[00:43:03] it going, bud? Thanks for coming in. You
[00:43:05] going to shoot him with the AR? All
[00:43:06] right. You take out the uh you've got an
[00:43:07] AR yourself. So you left, you had two
[00:43:10] ARs. You got one yourself. You pull out
[00:43:12] your AR and you go, "All right, time to
[00:43:15] do some uh Kalin. Now these are only
[00:43:18] five on their health and they are only a
[00:43:21] 10 to shoot." But with the AR, that
[00:43:23] means you only have uh to hit a seven.
[00:43:27] Now you get
[00:43:28] two dice you roll for your damage. So
[00:43:30] theoretically, you can kind of hit two
[00:43:32] of them. So let's see what happens.
[00:43:35] You get Oh, you get them and you get
[00:43:37] eight. You want to hit two for four or
[00:43:40] do you want to
[00:43:41] uh just kill one of them off and see
[00:43:44] what
[00:43:46] happens? Kill one of them off. All
[00:43:48] right, you kill one off. Now, a few of
[00:43:52] the rats, look at that. Seem a little
[00:43:55] smarter than normal. They scare a ray
[00:43:56] and but two more come charging towards
[00:43:58] you. It's not good. Now, they need to do
[00:44:01] as normal like for you. It's 13 to hit.
[00:44:04] Let's see what they do. And oh my god,
[00:44:07] did you do you guys see Oh
[00:44:11] god.
[00:44:13] Hey. Uh, Big
[00:44:15] BK, you you see that there, my
[00:44:18] friend? Oh, buddy. I'm sorry. Sorry.
[00:44:22] That I'm gonna zoom in a little closer
[00:44:24] for you just so you're sure you can see
[00:44:26] what that is. Hold on. All right. Just
[00:44:29] get a little bit a little bit clo. Yeah.
[00:44:31] You see, I I'm sorry, my
[00:44:35] friend. Oh
[00:44:37] no. Oh
[00:44:39] no. That is a uh that is a it's a
[00:44:43] critical and they got seven. All right,
[00:44:46] let's hopefully hopefully you're lucky
[00:44:47] here, my friend, because they get a one
[00:44:50] a multiplier now. Up to
[00:44:53] four. Oh. Oh, you got lucky. You got
[00:44:58] lucky. No multiplier. They only got
[00:45:03] one. Oh, he hit you for seven. Butt. You
[00:45:07] know what happens though when he hits
[00:45:08] you for that seven? You go from your 91
[00:45:11] health down to uh
[00:45:14] your
[00:45:19] 8
[00:45:22] four. And then the problem is though,
[00:45:26] you junk rats.
[00:45:30] are uh a radiant. Oh, no. You were I had
[00:45:32] the wrong
[00:45:38] person. All right. You go from your 78
[00:45:40] health down to 71 health and you now
[00:45:43] have uh radiation
[00:45:46] poisoning. I know you got rid of your
[00:45:48] rads before, but now you have radiation
[00:45:49] poisoning. Ah, rads. I know. All right.
[00:45:54] now. Oh, those other couple rats though,
[00:45:56] that they they were actually running and
[00:45:59] grabbing some of their friends. Oh, no.
[00:46:02] You now have six
[00:46:04] rats running towards you. What are you
[00:46:08] going to do, my
[00:46:11] friend? And Mystic, I'm going to get you
[00:46:13] your pack
[00:46:14] here. You going to flamethrow that? You
[00:46:17] know what? That's a pretty good idea cuz
[00:46:18] that has a radius. You going to use your
[00:46:20] flamethrower. It's a good thing you did
[00:46:22] not get rid of the flamethrower. So,
[00:46:23] flamethrower is a uh three. They're all
[00:46:26] 10. You get three to roll for your dice.
[00:46:30] So, you still you need a you need a uh
[00:46:32] with the flamethrower, it is a four or
[00:46:35] higher. You got a nine. Well, look at
[00:46:37] that. You have six. So, you can kill
[00:46:40] one, you can give damage to another, and
[00:46:43] you can give damage to another. What do
[00:46:44] you want to do? I'm guessing you want to
[00:46:47] spread the damage out, right?
[00:46:51] You know, I want to just You want to hit
[00:46:53] all hit three different ones,
[00:46:55] right? Toast them up. And Mystic, we're
[00:46:59] going to go with this pack for you, my
[00:47:01] friend. We're going to open that up
[00:47:07] here. All right. Here we go. Yeah. All
[00:47:11] right. Well, you kill one off, another
[00:47:14] one's injured, and runs away. Then the
[00:47:20] uh so one's injured one away, one's
[00:47:23] killed off. So you're left with four of
[00:47:25] the rats there coming towards
[00:47:28] you. Oh, I'm
[00:47:30] sorry. All right. Oh my
[00:47:35] god. Do you see that
[00:47:39] again? Do you see that
[00:47:43] again? Well, I don't know. The rats,
[00:47:46] they really really do not like you,
[00:47:48] buddy. These junkyard rats, they they
[00:47:51] despise you. You got another 20 uh
[00:47:53] natural 20 from them. So, you have
[00:47:57] uh 10 15 they hit you for already. I
[00:48:02] mean, yes. I mean, 14 they hit you for
[00:48:05] already. So, they hit you for 14. You
[00:48:08] got to see what their uh their
[00:48:09] multiplier is here. These rats. No
[00:48:12] wonder why he had you take care of them.
[00:48:15] Oh, they get a multiplier of two. So,
[00:48:16] they hit you for 30, my friend. Oh my.
[00:48:20] That brings you from 70 down to 71
[00:48:24] health down to 41 health. And that gives
[00:48:28] you uh three times the raids rads now.
[00:48:32] So, uh you got a bit of a problem here.
[00:48:35] What do you want to
[00:48:37] do? Those rats are getting ready to
[00:48:40] attack again. Flame them again. All
[00:48:43] right, flamethrower. Come on, my friend.
[00:48:45] Flamethrower. Let's do
[00:48:48] it. Here we go. You smell it. They smell
[00:48:51] the end. What? Here we
[00:48:55] go. Oh, you knocked part of my thing
[00:48:58] off. Where'd that come from? I think it
[00:49:01] came from right here,
[00:49:04] maybe. All right, you hit him and you
[00:49:08] get uh kill one. Nice. So, one of them's
[00:49:11] dead. You're down. They're you're down
[00:49:13] to uh three chasing after you and two of
[00:49:16] them whoop one of them's in uh two of
[00:49:18] them have a two damage and they decide
[00:49:20] to run away. So you know what I'm going
[00:49:22] to get let you be hungry. I'm going to
[00:49:24] let you be hungry. I'm going to let you
[00:49:25] be uh I read what you were saying mystic
[00:49:27] at the same time. I'm going to let you
[00:49:28] be lucky here. Give you optional luck
[00:49:31] cuz you do have a luck roll. I'm going
[00:49:33] to ask do you want to see if you want to
[00:49:35] try luck if they run away?
[00:49:37] You'll get yourself at has to be a uh 11
[00:49:41] or
[00:49:44] higher. I'm guessing you want to do
[00:49:46] that. So, yeah, do it. All right, let's
[00:49:47] do it. 11 or higher. Let's get it,
[00:49:49] buddy. And you got a Oh, it's a 14. It's

[00:53:29] wandering and they see something in the
[00:53:33] distance. All
[00:53:35] right. They
[00:53:38] see this uh kind of thing in the
[00:53:40] distance
[00:53:42] here. Uh do you want to go and
[00:53:46] investigate? I'm going to find Demar
[00:53:49] boys your uh security. Uh all right.
[00:53:53] I'll get that out.
[00:54:12] Cigardio. What is that?
[00:54:16] Oh, that's why it's under the I have it

[00:54:25] It's over
[00:54:27] here. Captain America's
[00:54:32] aid. All right. And then we have Fury.
[00:54:36] Yes. We're going to investigate. All
[00:54:37] right. You go over there. You're looking
[00:54:39] at it and you see you're trying to get
[00:54:40] your way in the door, but you're having
[00:54:41] a hard time opening it. Um, now for what
[00:54:46] you have for my friends for weapons.
[00:54:48] Let's see what you have. if you have
[00:54:49] anything that can help
[00:54:52] you. You do have
[00:54:56] uh h well you have the alien gatling gun
[00:55:00] and some
[00:55:01] agility and a little bit of
[00:55:04] intelligence. All right, we got to get
[00:55:06] your name written down now. Is there
[00:55:08] anything that you can think of on how to
[00:55:09] try to get your way out of there or into
[00:55:12] there? Seems like it's locked right
[00:55:15] now.
[00:55:23] Any
[00:55:26] thoughts? I mean, you have a knife and
[00:55:28] stuff like that, I think. So, Fury, let
[00:55:30] me get your Fury out, my
[00:55:34] friend. Oh, go check the roof. We go up
[00:55:37] to the top. There isn't necessarily a
[00:55:39] rooftop access up there, but it looks
[00:55:41] like
[00:55:42] um Nope, that's not it.
[00:55:47] Where the hell is that? Looks like there
[00:55:50] might be a uh a cracked entry entrance
[00:55:54] uh on the top there. Like you might be
[00:55:56] able to get your way in. You want to try
[00:55:57] to uh try to sneak in
[00:56:00] there. You have your Fury. All right.
[00:56:03] Fury coming out for you. Poo.
[00:56:08] Ped
[00:56:10] 1984. Good year. Good year.
[00:56:15] All
[00:56:15] right. And then I'll get your other one,
[00:56:18] Demir. All right. You go up to the top
[00:56:21] there and you you break in there that uh
[00:56:23] you break in that little complex and
[00:56:26] inside
[00:56:28] there you
[00:56:33] find a handful of
[00:56:37] these. The best year. Use some uh some
[00:56:40] drones that are flying around. You want
[00:56:42] to poke at any of
[00:56:44] them? And Deore, let me see. Let me get
[00:56:47] your
[00:56:48] son Quan
[00:56:50] out. Sword them. Oh, all
[00:56:53] right. All right. Going straight to uh
[00:56:56] to attacking them. I
[00:57:00] see. Sunnan for our
[00:57:08] friend. All right.
[00:57:16] All right. Well, you decide you're going
[00:57:18] to take your sword that you got, swing
[00:57:20] that mighty sword you have at them, and
[00:57:23] uh see what happens. Now, you hit one of
[00:57:26] them, and it cracks and pops and blows
[00:57:28] up. Now, you go to hit another one of
[00:57:30] them,
[00:57:32] and that one cracks, pops, and blows up,
[00:57:35] but happens to uh leave some scrap metal
[00:57:38] stuff around that you could potentially
[00:57:39] pick up. But when you hit
[00:57:42] that, two of them start up. All right.
[00:57:47] Now, two of them they start up. You're
[00:57:49] going to have to be see here. You're
[00:57:51] going to one in four chance if they're
[00:57:53] going to be able to attack first or not
[00:57:54] before you have the opportunity cuz
[00:57:56] they're
[00:57:57] flying. They missed. It was going to
[00:57:59] have to be a four. You didn't get that.
[00:58:00] They didn't. They did not go. But you
[00:58:02] have two of them that are now starting
[00:58:04] up. What would you like to do? I don't
[00:58:07] know if you have any ability to hack or
[00:58:09] anything like that. And I don't think
[00:58:10] you have anything like that,
[00:58:14] Mystic. No, you don't. No, you
[00:58:17] don't. Nope, I don't see that. All
[00:58:20] right. And Dear, let me get your Asarak
[00:58:25] out. All right. Let me get your Asarak
[00:58:30] out.
[00:58:33] Acer.
[00:58:35] Acer. Right there for you, my friend.
[00:58:45] There you go, my
[00:58:48] friend. Sword him. All right, you're
[00:58:51] going to go after him with a sword. I
[00:58:52] like
[00:58:55] it. Sword time. We're doing a little bit
[00:58:58] of sword play. You go running towards
[00:59:00] him with your sword. You
[00:59:03] swing at one. Now, they aren't much
[00:59:06] damage. They only need a you need to hit
[00:59:07] him for a 10 or higher. Um because they
[00:59:10] would have been I mean well no they
[00:59:12] would have been 13 so it would be seven
[00:59:15] or higher you need to hit with the
[00:59:16] sword.
[00:59:19] You hit Oh my you missed. You got a
[00:59:22] four. You swung. It was a swing and a
[00:59:26] miss. Swing and a miss. And those uh
[00:59:30] those drones, they turn, they scan you,
[00:59:33] and they oh, they start to
[00:59:36] shoot. Luckily, it doesn't look like
[00:59:38] they have major things. They're more
[00:59:39] like uh reconnaissance ones because it's
[00:59:42] only a small kind of like pistol like
[00:59:43] shots. But you got
[00:59:46] Oh, look at that. You got four. Four.
[00:59:50] They got You got lucky, my friend. They
[00:59:52] missed you,
[00:59:53] too.
[00:59:54] Whoa,
[00:59:56] buddy. You got one more. you're going to
[00:59:58] get another chance before they uh either
[01:00:00] we're going to see if they kamicazi or
[01:00:02] something. I don't know. We'll throw out
[01:00:04] uh we have our our our break pin for
[01:00:07] those of you that would like to jump in
[01:00:09] and try it out. We do appreciate you
[01:00:11] hanging out
[01:00:13] here. All right, let's
[01:00:15] see. You got the opportunity, Mystic.
[01:00:18] What are you going to do?
[01:00:27] Let's
[01:00:31] do You know what? Who cares? I'm going
[01:00:33] to run some of this. If people want any
[01:00:35] of these, go after them for fun. Have
[01:00:38] some great time. We'll open some of
[01:00:40] these
[01:00:42] ones. Could I get them or would it be
[01:00:45] harder to hit them?
[01:00:49] It's probably I mean, they're in the
[01:00:51] air. It's they're not moving around too
[01:00:53] much. Now, you could potentially hit
[01:00:54] them once they start kind of flying, but
[01:00:56] they uh you might have an issue um once
[01:01:00] you get one more swing by. We'll say,
[01:01:02] you know, they're going to get a swing
[01:01:03] at them.
[01:01:05] So, all right. No
[01:01:09] problem. Shoot him. All right. We're
[01:01:11] going to shoot him. Which one are we
[01:01:12] using? You got a few weapons here, my
[01:01:13] friend. You have
[01:01:16] uh the alien gatling
[01:01:19] gun, the uh
[01:01:24] AR, plasma
[01:01:26] rifle, the
[01:01:29] pistol. Guessing, you know, kind of want
[01:01:31] to, you know, use the alien gat,
[01:01:35] right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All
[01:01:37] right. So, that is four to roll. There's
[01:01:42] a six on your damn it. No, it's three to
[01:01:44] roll, six on the
[01:01:46] damage. Let's see what happens. So, that
[01:01:49] means you need to have a
[01:01:51] uh six or
[01:01:56] higher. Oh my
[01:02:07] god. I don't know,
[01:02:09] man. You missed.
[01:02:13] I'm
[01:02:16] sorry. I'm
[01:02:18] sorry. Can't help you on that one. Oh,
[01:02:22] those dice are being they're they're
[01:02:23] horrible. They're not so nice today.
[01:02:25] They're not being kind today. Not at
[01:02:28] all. So, you, my friend, uh, it's not
[01:02:30] good. You get uh you missed with your
[01:02:33] shot there. Now, those two
[01:02:35] drones, they go after you.
[01:02:40] Oh, and my god, look at that. It's a
[01:02:42] one. They get a critical
[01:02:45] miss.
[01:02:47] Perfect. Critical miss. One of them
[01:02:51] shoots the other
[01:02:53] one when they are trying to shoot you.
[01:02:55] Well, look at that. One of them shoots
[01:02:56] the other one when they're trying to
[01:02:57] shoot you. And then all of a
[01:03:01] sudden, we had a
[01:03:07] problem. They blow up. both of them.
[01:03:10] They turn in and shoot each other
[01:03:11] instead. You got lucky with a critical
[01:03:13] miss right
[01:03:14] there. Well, at least it was gonna be
[01:03:16] bad. Make it like really bad,
[01:03:19] right? You got a critical miss. They hit
[01:03:22] one. So, you they blow up and uh do you
[01:03:26] want to rumage around the
[01:03:29] area, my friend, or do you want to uh
[01:03:33] head out of there? Yes, please. All
[01:03:34] right. You go rumaging around. You
[01:03:36] find some pistol ammo. Well, they
[01:03:38] weren't really wellarmed. But you do
[01:03:40] find a little stash of Pogs, though, in
[01:03:42] the
[01:03:43] background. That was in the building.
[01:03:45] You find a stash of 12 Pogs. There you
[01:03:49] go, my friend. All right, we're going to
[01:03:52] go and grab one of these for our buddy
[01:03:54] Big BK who'd like some time spiral. And
[01:03:58] let me add your 12 Pogs in and your
[01:04:03] uh your 12 Pogs to you, which brings you
[01:04:07] up to 100. Actually, you're now at 100
[01:04:10] Pogs, Mystic. So, if you run into uh
[01:04:13] something in somewhere you want to do
[01:04:15] something to and then uh
[01:04:18] your pistol now goes up um
[01:04:23] to 25 rounds of pistol ammo.

[01:13:51] like that. That's all. Um, we used to do
[01:13:54] it as I do it like with breaks a lot,
[01:13:57] but I kind of moved into doing it like
[01:13:58] we usually do it with breaks like this.
[01:14:00] Uh, but I I moved into doing it where we
[01:14:02] open some packs while we do it and have
[01:14:03] some fun. So, you got your incendiary
[01:14:06] gap
[01:14:07] back and you're quite happy with that.
[01:14:11] It has some
[01:14:12] potential. So, I think uh you'll have to
[01:14:15] see if you can go test that out at some
[01:14:17] point.

[01:27:38] loaders for
[01:27:41] you. Ah, yeah. Sometimes
[01:27:45] sometimes sometimes that's
[01:27:47] happens. But
[01:27:49] luckily, you can still play all the
[01:27:52] cards. That's the nice thing about it.
[01:27:53] You can still play them all. All right,
[01:27:56] let's put you with the rest of your
[01:27:58] stuff
[01:28:00] big. And you did I'm guessing you want
[01:28:03] to go and try out your uh your weapon,
[01:28:09] right, Big BK?
[01:28:11] So, my guess there is you want to go and
[01:28:13] try your weapon out, see if you can
[01:28:20] uh catch anything on
[01:28:23] fire. All right. So, you take your
[01:28:24] weapon
[01:28:25] there, you go wandering around, and you
[01:28:29] happen
[01:28:32] to Where'd it
[01:28:38] go? Ah, there it is. run
[01:28:41] into another
[01:28:43] scrapper in front of you. Now you guys
[01:28:47] are uh both seem to be scrging through
[01:28:49] the same area all at the time and you
[01:28:52] need to
[01:28:53] decide. Yeah, that's what I figured.
[01:28:56] That's my stuff. You
[01:28:58] yell. You use your incendiary gat. Now
[01:29:03] that is a plus six.
[01:29:07] Uh, nope. That is a plus seven on the
[01:29:11] roll. All right. Gives you seven extra
[01:29:13] with your for your roll. So, that guy
[01:29:15] was going to be a 15. And it also gives
[01:29:18] you
[01:29:19] uh instead of three, four of these. So,
[01:29:23] that means you have to have a uh eight
[01:29:27] or
[01:29:29] higher to hit
[01:29:32] them. And you got Oh, buddy.
[01:29:37] You got We're going to give you the 20
[01:29:39] cuz it was kind of in the middle. You
[01:29:40] got a natural 20. You see
[01:29:43] that? Look at that. I think you
[01:29:48] did. I think he did. Use that incendiary
[01:29:53] and let loose a barrage of bullets. Now
[01:29:56] they they just they just toast this guy.
[01:29:59] He doesn't even have a chance. He gets
[01:30:01] hit
[01:30:03] by the six bullets that are shot at
[01:30:05] once. Where is this
[01:30:07] guy? And he just kind of catches on fire
[01:30:11] and falls to the ground burning. Well,
[01:30:14] that was a nice one. He didn't even have
[01:30:16] an opportunity to win. Do anything. You
[01:30:18] just took him out. You just took him
[01:30:21] out. Now, we're going to roll uh to see
[01:30:23] what your extra is because he doesn't
[01:30:24] have that much health as a scrapper. But
[01:30:26] I don't think you need it. And yeah, you
[01:30:28] get one. It doesn't matter because you
[01:30:29] hit him and you killed him anyways with
[01:30:31] what you got. The guy's on fire. He is
[01:30:33] on fire and you decide you're going to
[01:30:35] search through the scrap. I'm guessing
[01:30:36] you guys were looking at it
[01:30:38] before. Loot. Well, you go to loot the
[01:30:41] body. Uh kick it around that burning
[01:30:43] body and you find uh some assault rifle
[01:30:45] ammo, which is nice cuz that uh that
[01:30:48] will work with your gatling gun. And you
[01:30:51] also see yourself a
[01:30:54] ration, which is nice. You get some
[01:30:56] food.
[01:30:58] And then you also find 10 pogs on them
[01:31:04] along with it. So you loot the guy, but
[01:31:06] around them you already trying to strap
[01:31:08] around and in the area you see
[01:31:11] something. You
[01:31:13] go and you uh knock it over and you see
[01:31:16] a health pack. Look at that. You find
[01:31:19] yourself a health pack also.
[01:31:22] So, let's give you that uh plus 20
[01:31:29] health health
[01:31:30] pack. Plus 20 health
[01:31:33] pack. Your AR ammo goes from
[01:31:39] 10 up to
[01:31:43] uh well, you use your GAT there that
[01:31:47] time. So, the GAT uses six. So that gat
[01:31:50] is uh we're going to leave your AR at 15
[01:31:52] like you were, but your gat is going to
[01:31:55] go uh up to um we'll call it 25 there.
[01:32:02] Give you a little extra.
[01:32:05] And then you have your health pack. That
[01:32:07] and your 10 pogs to add
[01:32:10] on. So you now have 19 pogs. There you
[01:32:14] go, my friend. Eat that. There you go.
[01:32:17] Aha. One shot. One shot was all that was
[01:32:20] needed for that one. Taking them out in
[01:32:22] one hit. Now everybody, we do have a
[01:32:25] break today. I have it pinned there. Uh
[01:32:27] if you want to participate, do a little
[01:32:29] wasteland adventuring and uh open some
[01:32:30] packs. But we have Byaxia, Calaldheim,
[01:32:33] IIcoria, a Modern Masters, an Aether
[01:32:37] Drift, and a Foundations Collector.
[01:32:39] Plus, we are opening and you get you're
[01:32:41] going to guarantee yourself one of the
[01:32:44] uh pack one of the singles from uh the
[01:32:47] Storm

[01:42:06] you uh well, you pick up where you you
[01:42:09] kind of left off. Shot that that guy.
[01:42:11] You wandered around. You you're in that
[01:42:13] area. You decide to head back towards
[01:42:15] the city. You get to the small town that
[01:42:17] you were at at the end of it because you
[01:42:19] were right at the edge of the
[01:42:21] city. And uh when you get
[01:42:26] there, you
[01:42:30] uh you run into where the hell is it?
[01:42:34] There it is. You run into
[01:42:36] this. It's an unmarked
[01:42:40] grave. You want to uh
[01:42:44] investigate or do you want
[01:42:47] to turn around and run away? Ooh, let's
[01:42:51] investigate. Hey, Rev Tank. How's it
[01:42:52] going, my friend? Nice to see you. How
[01:42:54] you Good, thank you. I'm doing well.
[01:42:55] Good morning. Good morning to
[01:43:00] you. All right, so you go and you
[01:43:02] investigate. You start uh rumaging
[01:43:05] around. You rumage around and you find
[01:43:08] this
[01:43:10] uh buried toolbox there next to
[01:43:13] it. And as you investigate it, you're
[01:43:16] not paying enough attention.
[01:43:21] Where is it?
[01:43:30] This thing comes waddling up towards
[01:43:33] you and it smelled some fresh
[01:43:36] food. It happened to be uh one of the
[01:43:39] things that lived in the area. I guess
[01:43:40] you have a gator
[01:43:42] dillo. Oh no. Oh [Â __Â ] It's a problem.
[01:43:47] That gator dillo is uh is
[01:43:51] o you have to decide my friend. Now
[01:43:53] gator dillos are a
[01:43:56] uh 17 or higher to hit and also they are
[01:44:02] uh they have a roll attack which they
[01:44:05] get a 50/50 of knocking you over and um
[01:44:08] they can whip you with their tail which
[01:44:10] is a pretty tough one. And they also use
[01:44:14] four of our d6 die to swing with. So
[01:44:16] that's one of our big tough ones. All
[01:44:18] right. You smell dead gator dillo. What
[01:44:20] are you going to use here, my friend? He
[01:44:21] comes up to you and he, my friend, gets
[01:44:23] the first jump on you. He needs a 13 or
[01:44:26] higher, which oh boy, he gets he gets a
[01:44:29] 19 there for you. He gets one. He just
[01:44:32] bites you. Tries to bite you this time.
[01:44:34] And he gets a little bite on your side.
[01:44:36] You're down to 8 9 10 11. Go down to
[01:44:42] 11. Let's go over here. brings you
[01:44:46] around brings you down to 50 on your
[01:44:49] health. You do have a health pack. I'd
[01:44:50] recommend probably using that, but uh
[01:44:53] you use the gat. All right, got it. Here
[01:44:56] we
[01:44:57] go. Using the gat on them. It's gat
[01:45:01] time. Yep. Nope. Oh crap. Pressed too
[01:45:05] many
[01:45:07] buttons. You go back. You get your
[01:45:10] gatling
[01:45:11] gun and you realize it's the upgraded
[01:45:13] one and you
[01:45:16] switch and you pull that out and you
[01:45:19] shoot. Let's see what you get
[01:45:21] [Music]
[01:45:22] here. Now, this one you have a plus
[01:45:25] seven for your roll damage. So, that
[01:45:28] means uh you need to have a 10 or
[01:45:31] higher and you get Oh, well, look at
[01:45:34] that. Nice. You get yourself a 16 and
[01:45:37] you hit him for 6 10. And this guy's a
[01:45:41] tough one. He is a 50 health. So it goes
[01:45:45] from uh
[01:45:46] 50 down to 40. There you
[01:45:52] go. Now you have to
[01:45:55] decide what do you want to do now, my
[01:45:58] friend. This is a big tough guy. He's
[01:46:00] not happy. He did not
[01:46:02] like getting hit. the gator dillo and he
[01:46:05] charges at
[01:46:07] you. He does not like it when he charges
[01:46:10] at you. I told you he's a tough one.
[01:46:13] He's got the armor of a gatoradillo, but
[01:46:16] he's like an an alligator with the
[01:46:18] strength of the alligator. And uh he's a
[01:46:20] little bit faster than an alligator and
[01:46:22] an armadillo, but he can uh he can get
[01:46:24] you on land because the armadillo a
[01:46:26] factor and he can roll up in a ball and
[01:46:27] attack or he can uh hit hit you hard.
[01:46:29] So, it's your choice what you going to
[01:46:30] do.
[01:46:34] Oh
[01:46:35] no. What are you going to do, my friend?
[01:46:38] Shoot. Oh, we're going to shoot him
[01:46:39] again. All right.
[01:46:42] Incendiary. I was giving you the chance
[01:46:44] to try to run away, but you chose not
[01:46:46] to. And because you chose not
[01:46:49] to as you're trying to
[01:46:52] shoot, he he's a quick one. I told you
[01:46:55] he was
[01:46:56] quick. He gets in there to attack. 13 or
[01:46:59] higher. Oh, you're lucky. He gets a
[01:47:02] five. That armadillo gator dillo. I
[01:47:06] mean, what the hell was that? Ah, a
[01:47:09] piece
[01:47:12] of coffee ground under my tongue. I'm
[01:47:16] sorry about that. Gatoradillo
[01:47:21] missed. You got
[01:47:25] lucky. I'm not going to get that thing
[01:47:27] out all day, am I? And you, my friend,
[01:47:29] just said hi and say haha.
[01:47:32] Incendiary on its
[01:47:34] way. I don't know about that, Chu. But
[01:47:36] hey, we can um if you'd like to, you can
[01:47:38] try to jump into some of the giveaways
[01:47:39] that we do. You You get you get Oh, you
[01:47:42] get 13, which is high enough to hit
[01:47:43] them. You get
[01:47:47] 12, 14.
[01:47:50] And there you
[01:47:52] go. 19. You hit it for stop. That thing
[01:47:56] goes from a 40 away down to
[01:48:03] a 21 health. Now that thing
[01:48:07] roars and it charges you. Does not like
[01:48:10] what just
[01:48:12] happened. And it gets a chance of
[01:48:15] potentially hitting with the uh roll.
[01:48:18] Now it's going to roll. And oh my god,
[01:48:22] you get lucky again. And it
[01:48:23] misses. That that shot to him must have
[01:48:27] done something enough to make it not
[01:48:28] know what to do. That it goes and it
[01:48:31] misses when it rolls at you. Hey Frank,
[01:48:32] how's it going
[01:48:34] buddy? Hope you're having a good one.
[01:48:38] Um so let's uh let's get that roll going
[01:48:41] here for you. And um

[01:49:49] 15 off of the 21
[01:49:53] there. That gator dillo roars because
[01:49:55] it's at six health right now and it
[01:49:59] tries to whip you with its
[01:50:01] tail. This one is a rough one because it
[01:50:06] has five if it hits. This is a tough
[01:50:08] one, buddy. All right, let's
[01:50:12] see. And he misses again. Oh,
[01:50:16] wow. You get lucky. He got a 12. That
[01:50:19] gator dillo misses. He's so tired and
[01:50:24] injured. Yeah, right. That's exactly
[01:50:26] what he
[01:50:30] does. Yeah. Saturday morning after I do
[01:50:32] the show. Uh, that works
[01:50:35] fine. All right, flamethrower
[01:50:38] time. Here we go. Flamethrower, you get
[01:50:41] uh you get the three there, which gets
[01:50:44] you plus six. So, you need an 11 or
[01:50:46] higher.

[01:50:52] there you go. It's dead. You hit it with
[01:50:56] uh 16 18. Oh my. Congratulations on that
[01:51:00] one.
[01:51:03] Boom. You did kill that gator. You got
[01:51:06] some luck with this. That gator dillo
[01:51:09] dies, starts uh toasting on fire, and
[01:51:12] he's dead now. Well, look at that. You,
[01:51:15] my friend, got lucky. Now, for the rest
[01:51:16] of you, if you'd like, you can jump in
[01:51:18] on the break. We do a big uh we do kind
[01:51:20] of a bigger boss raid there. But there
[01:51:22] you
[01:51:33] go. No, no, he does not have the
[01:51:36] greatest of loot. All right, but this is
[01:51:39] what happens. Let me have I thought I
[01:51:41] had this somewhere. Give me one second.
[01:51:43] Here you get this. Generally, nobody
[01:51:46] stays to kill the gator dillo. Everybody
[01:51:47] always
[01:51:50] leaves. You're like the first person
[01:51:52] that's like, "Nope, I'm gonna kill you."
[01:51:54] So, hold on a second. I actually don't

[01:52:22] this. No, I We're going have to do
[01:52:25] something here quickly. I uh I didn't
[01:52:28] have that made before. We're going to do
[01:52:29] this. We'll make it for you. We'll have
[01:52:31] to have something for you. Hold on. I
[01:52:32] know exactly what we're doing. No. No.
[01:53:00] There you go.
[01:53:16] Try
[01:53:19] that. Well, that's what it
[01:53:27] is. Ah, come on. It's not going to make
[01:53:30] it. No.
[01:53:36] You got to be kidding me. I hate these
[01:53:39] things.
[01:54:06] here. Try this. Sorry. Sometimes a pain
[01:54:09] in the butt. You got tickets for Vegas.
[01:54:17] Nice. We trust we trust me to get that
[01:54:20] the image right. There we go. That's
[01:54:21] what we were doing.

[01:54:33] Hold on. Yes, I would like some. What
[01:54:36] kind?
[01:54:38] Um, those. If we have that, that'll be
[01:54:40] good.

[01:55:23] That's good. That's it. Thank you. I
[01:55:26] appreciate that, buddy. You're welcome.
[01:55:27] Much appreciated. I'm going to have some
[01:55:29] cereal
[01:55:35] here. All right, there you go.
[01:55:43] That will be
[01:55:46] what you get.
[01:55:48] Now, reason why I needed to make this
[01:55:50] and take it a little bit
[01:55:52] here. Max, I did not ignore your
[01:55:55] comments. I was looking at something
[01:55:57] else. Hi. I'm sorry, Mad Max. I did not
[01:56:01] ignore
[01:56:05] them. But yeah, I'm trying I'm locked in
[01:56:07] trying to get the uh the image for you
[01:56:08] here. Ah, here we go.
[01:56:12] There we go. Let's put that in there.
[01:56:15] Boom. This is
[01:56:22] a All right. Since you are a uh seasoned
[01:56:27] adventurer, you know, when you're
[01:56:30] looking at this thing to
[01:56:34] uh to to take some of its
[01:56:37] skin because, you know, maybe it can be
[01:56:39] used for leather or something like that
[01:56:42] and uh get you some sweet armor of some
[01:56:45] kind.
[01:56:47] So you
[01:56:49] grab
[01:56:51] that gator dillo
[01:56:55] skin and put that into your
[01:56:59] stuff. So it just so some of it I it did
[01:57:02] degrade. That's why there's no spikes on
[01:57:03] it. So that's why see how uh see how
[01:57:07] there's no spikes on it. It did burn a
[01:57:09] little bit of it off but there you go.
[01:57:10] You get some gatoradillo skin. Gator
[01:57:13] dillo. That's
[01:57:21] exactly all right.
[01:57:29] Well, that's what we're at for
[01:57:33] you. There's your luck for the day. You
[01:57:36] got some Gatoradillo skin. And as
[01:57:39] everybody sees there, we have a break.
[01:57:41] Sit out for the day. I'm going to zoom
[01:57:42] out a little bit so you can see the rest
[01:57:43] of our
[01:57:45] stuff if you'd like to pick anything up.
[01:57:48] There's a bunch of the stuff by now plus
[01:57:49] a bunch of singles. You
[01:57:52] have these different
[01:57:54] packs that are in the break plus we're
[01:57:58] doing the Marvel Storm Rainbow Foil
[01:58:00] which everybody will get one of the in
[01:58:02] here cuz there's six. I think there
[01:58:03] might be actually seven, but either way
[01:58:06] there's definitely six. Everybody gets
[01:58:07] one cuz we shuffle them up and hand them
[01:58:09] out to everybody for their spot. And
[01:58:10] then we do the same thing with the uh
[01:58:12] rares, mythics, and then the uncommons
[01:58:14] and commons that are in this. So, if you
[01:58:15] want to jump in, that is what we have
[01:58:18] for the break
[01:58:21] today. But let me go over here and check
[01:58:23] make sure I didn't miss
[01:58:26] anything. Nstic jumped in. Nope, that
[01:58:29] was it. I got everything caught up.
[01:58:31] Nice. All right, there we
[01:58:33] go. Oh, yes, the toolbox.
[01:58:50] You remembered the toolbox cuz I
[01:58:51] completely forgot about the
[01:58:53] toolbox. All right. Now you turn around.
[01:58:56] You find yourself a rat
[01:59:00] away. You find a
[01:59:03] ration and you find yourself a health
[01:59:05] pack.
[01:59:07] So, you have uh found a couple things
[01:59:09] that were in
[01:59:10] there when you loot
[01:59:18] it. And
[01:59:28] then, and you have two
[01:59:33] rations. There you go.
[01:59:36] Yeah, that's what you got, my
[01:59:38] friend. Rations, uh, they, uh, may just
[01:59:42] kind of give you a little bit of health,
[01:59:43] like five plus five on your health
[01:59:46] or other people have asked if they can
[01:59:48] do other stuff with them, so I haven't
[01:59:50] thought of anything on that yet, but I
[01:59:51] guess it's if you
[01:59:57] got You are at 50 health. That is
[01:59:59] correct. 50
[02:00:08] What? Three.
[02:00:12] What? Um, yeah, it's not supposed to let
[02:00:15] me do that. Let anybody do that for
[02:00:18] doing the uh the offers there. I don't
[02:00:21] know why it does. So, I'm just going to
[02:00:22] send it back. If you want to, you can
[02:00:24] jump on it or not. I'm sorry about that.
[02:00:28] Yeah. And I'll look at those actually
[02:00:30] and pick them out for you. And I'll put
[02:00:32] it like I said at the end at the three
[02:00:34] cat card.
[02:00:41] Yeah. Not a problem, Ashley. Yeah, we
[02:00:44] have the other ones together. I'll just
[02:00:46] grab those
[02:00:47] out. Put them in. And there you
[02:00:51] go. All right.
[02:00:55] That was a rough attack
[02:00:58] there. Not a problem. Thank you. Thank
[02:01:00] you. See, if if people want to get a
[02:01:03] handful of uh
[02:01:04] singles, um you know, as long as they
[02:01:07] specifically don't sell during during
[02:01:08] the show, we'll um get them together for
[02:01:12] you so I can get it as like one bundle
[02:01:15] for you instead of having to do it all.
[02:01:17] The other day, I did it for another uh
[02:01:19] person. So, you know what? Let's go uh
[02:01:21] let's do a little throwback here.
[02:01:28] Let's do a throwback if anybody wants to
[02:01:30] try
[02:01:33] that. Go back in time for a little
[02:01:38] bit. Nice. The
[02:01:41] gobble. The Google gobble. Ah, how's it
[02:01:44] going, buddy? Man bear pick there. Yep.
[02:01:46] I have to agree.
[02:01:56] All right.
[02:02:20] Anybody want one? I think that was over
[02:02:22] there
[02:02:25] before. There we go. Put it out there if
[02:02:28] you
[02:02:28] like. Little little sail for a minute
[02:02:31] while I
[02:02:32] uh take another bite of
[02:02:44] food. I like it.
[02:03:07] I like when people do that. That make uh
[02:03:10] makes life
[02:03:12] better. You're not being mean, you know.
[02:03:16] gives a little chuckle to
[02:03:19] everyone. See, the problem is when you
[02:03:21] guys change your names, I don't always
[02:03:22] remember who you are or know who you
[02:03:24] are. Like, I've had people come like,
[02:03:25] "Dude, I'm this person." I'm like,
[02:03:27] "Oh, I just changed my name." Like, "Oh,
[02:03:29] well, that doesn't help
[02:03:31] me." Big BK. All right, we're going to
[02:03:33] do another uh I like it. Here we go.
[02:03:38] Another one of the uh
[02:03:40] murders. Let me put one of those back
[02:03:42] here.
[02:03:44] There we
[02:03:45] go. There you go, my friend. Let's see
[02:03:48] what you
[02:03:50] get. So, yeah, if you guys change your
[02:03:52] name, I think one of the first things
[02:03:53] you need to do is like, "Hey, come in
[02:03:54] and say, "I'm this
[02:03:58] person." All right, here we go. Big good
[02:04:01] luck, my friend. Let's see what you get.
[02:04:04] I appreciate you jumping in on another
[02:04:06] pack. Let's see.
[02:04:10] That's
[02:04:11] my
[02:04:14] persuade protetic. I don't know how to
[02:04:17] say that. Sorry. One, two, three, four,
[02:04:20] five, six, seven, eight. One, two,
[02:04:24] three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[02:04:28] Let's see what we get here for you for
[02:04:29] my friend Big BK. Some good
[02:04:31] luck. We're going to zoom in. We're
[02:04:33] going to
[02:04:35] see. We have an airtight alibi. We have
[02:04:38] a shock.
[02:04:42] Deduce, Granite
[02:04:44] Witness, Inside Source, Macob
[02:04:48] Reconstruction, Dog
[02:04:51] Walker, Hustle and Bustle. We got some
[02:04:55] rope to Chase of the Gateway
[02:05:00] Express. Case of the Gateway Express.
[02:05:02] Ooh, World Souls Rage. I thought that's
[02:05:05] what I thought. World Souls Rage. Nice
[02:05:08] pick up on the uh showcase
[02:05:10] there. Homicide
[02:05:12] investigator and a demand answer
[02:05:14] showcase
[02:05:15] foil with a mountain for your full art.
[02:05:20] What? We're going to get rock here. Oh,
[02:05:23] hold on a second. We might lose
[02:05:24] connection for a second. Going to get
[02:05:26] rocked with some bad waves. Somebody
[02:05:27] came flying by us.
[02:05:29] Okay.
[02:05:35] All right.
[02:05:47] Oh. All right. That's my purse. I don't
[02:05:49] know you. All
[02:05:51] right. I like it. That's a good one,
[02:05:54] too.
[02:06:03] See, it takes me a while to get some of
[02:06:05] those names there. But when you explain,
[02:06:07] I'm like, "Oh, that's a good one. I like
[02:06:11] that." I I appreciate it. King Islands.
[02:06:14] Yeah, sure. We can do that. Well, well,
[02:06:16] we can do something like that. Um, I'll
[02:06:17] reach out potentially. Uh, if you go to
[02:06:19] the link, there should be a link there
[02:06:21] that in the chat. If you go there, you
[02:06:23] can actually get access and come and
[02:06:24] hang out with
[02:06:27] us. in uh in our own
[02:06:30] uh Discord
[02:06:32] channel. All right. So big. There you
[02:06:35] go, my
[02:06:40] friend. All
[02:06:44] right. I know. We're not sure who's
[02:06:46] going to do with a break here. So, let
[02:06:47] me do this. We're going to pin
[02:06:51] that. Our buddy Big just got their
[02:06:56] skin and they're wandering back around
[02:06:58] the
[02:07:00] city. They finally get the edge of
[02:07:07] it. Waves hit. Yep. You lose connection
[02:07:10] every now and again. That's all. Only
[02:07:14] problem. You're in the city there.
[02:07:15] You're wandering
[02:07:16] around and you go
[02:07:20] uh back
[02:07:22] towards the
[02:07:24] town. I mean the the center of it
[02:07:29] where I'm going and give you I'm going
[02:07:31] to give you some uh an ability
[02:07:33] here. We're going to send you back
[02:07:36] to Where is it? Which one is it?
[02:07:41] We're going to send you
[02:07:43] here to our
[02:07:45] buddy. I think his name was Gage. Let me
[02:07:47] get to it. Let me get to it. Our buddy
[02:07:49] Gage, I believe it was. Yes, it was. I
[02:07:52] think Gage is here hanging out. He's
[02:07:54] like,
[02:07:55] "Hey, what are you doing coming to our
[02:07:59] uh hidden
[02:08:04] door?" It seems like Gage can let you do
[02:08:06] something.
[02:08:08] Yeah, King Legends. Jump into
[02:08:11] them. Like I said to the Discord, it
[02:08:13] should be a link there. If it doesn't
[02:08:14] work, let me
[02:08:21] know. Aha, good
[02:08:28] idea. You say, G, Gage, I
[02:08:33] have this here.
[02:08:37] happened to kill one and I got
[02:08:39] it. Gage looks at you stunned going
[02:08:44] you. All right, buddy. So, who uh who
[02:08:48] died and you steal it
[02:08:54] from? You look at him a little bit
[02:08:57] mad. That was me. I killed
[02:09:00] it. Exactly. I shot this [Â __Â ] It's
[02:09:03] mine.
[02:09:07] All right. All right. He goes, "All
[02:09:09] right. All right." You show him the
[02:09:10] weapon. He goes, "All right. Nice. I
[02:09:13] see." Show him your gun. He go. And he
[02:09:16] goes, "Nice." All right. Well, that
[02:09:17] makes sense now. Got a good
[02:09:22] upgrade. He goes, "Yeah, I can do
[02:09:24] something with
[02:09:26] that. That'll be 30 fogs,
[02:09:31] though, for you. You can turn it into
[02:09:34] some uh you know like kind of leather
[02:09:35] armor. Give you a chest plate, some
[02:09:39] stuff to kind of protect your
[02:09:41] arms, hands a little bit maybe. I don't
[02:09:44] think we can get gloves, but we can get
[02:09:46] something like that. Arms and wrist. And
[02:09:48] um I'll see if I can get something that
[02:09:49] can hang down a little bit to protect
[02:09:51] your uh your legs
[02:09:52] somewhat. All right. I don't know if I
[02:09:54] can, but we'll
[02:09:56] try. You do not have 30
[02:09:59] pogs. Oh, no.
[02:10:04] You don't have 30 pogs. Well,
[02:10:08] uh, you have anything to
[02:10:11] trade? You do have, just so you know, a
[02:10:14] pistol, a knife, a plasma rifle, an
[02:10:16] assault rifle, a
[02:10:20] flamethrower, and a Gatling gun.
[02:10:36] Ah, give him a deal. All right. I have
[02:10:39] some extra padding in the groin.
[02:10:40] Correct, miss. Like, we'll give him some
[02:10:41] extra padding. He says, "Yes, sure.
[02:10:43] Extra padding in the groin. We'll do
[02:10:44] that." So, you get that going for
[02:10:47] him. All set up. He says, "All right, I
[02:10:51] can do that. Come back." You give him
[02:10:52] your 19 pogs. say, "All right, you come
[02:10:54] back later, but it's going to be instead
[02:10:56] of uh 30 since it's a loan on the work
[02:11:01] and I might have to trust you, uh you
[02:11:03] either have to come back with something
[02:11:05] for me extra or it's going to be 40
[02:11:13] bucks cuz I, you know, I got to make
[02:11:15] sure
[02:11:16] that you come back."
[02:11:22] That's his
[02:11:24] deal. Gage is a tough
[02:11:27] cookie. He doesn't always like uh
[02:11:30] handing things out for free. He's been
[02:11:31] burnt too
[02:11:38] much. Oo, that's a good point there. If
[02:11:42] you don't come back, I get the suit. All
[02:11:44] right, we're going to put timeline on it
[02:11:46] then. You need to be back within 4 days.
[02:11:55] Is that a
[02:12:01] deal? It's easy. All right. Four days it
[02:12:05] is. That's the
[02:12:06] deal. Done. All
[02:12:09] right. Go there. Go gator skin.
[02:12:23] There you go. In four days, you'll have
[02:12:26] something. You want to heal f any heal
[02:12:29] fully. All right. You need to heal
[02:12:30] fully. Yes, that is that is true. You're
[02:12:31] pretty you're pretty injured right now.
[02:12:33] Now, you have some health. You have some
[02:12:35] rata away now being healed. Um you might
[02:12:39] be able to find somewhere else in the
[02:12:41] city cuz uh I don't know if you bumped
[02:12:43] into him
[02:12:45] before. You might not been to Sugar
[02:12:47] Steve
[02:12:49] before. Did you bump up to the storage
[02:12:58] vendor? I think he did,
[02:13:04] right? No. Oh
[02:13:07] no.
[02:13:09] Uhoh. Well,
[02:13:20] All righty. Well, then let's think for a
[02:13:27] second. Oh, you're talking to your buddy
[02:13:29] about that and you go, you'll be back
[02:13:31] and you ask him. You want to ask him any
[02:13:33] goes anywhere? Are you going to heal or
[02:13:35] you just going to kind of wander out?
[02:13:36] I'm going to give you a tip here. Let's
[02:13:37] give you a little bit of a tip. All
[02:13:38] right. A little bit of one. Just a just
[02:13:41] a little tip.
[02:13:50] option of
[02:13:54] uh you want to ask him if he knows
[02:13:57] anywhere you can get healed. I was just
[02:13:59] saying I'm just going to give you just a
[02:14:01] little tip. Just just a tip.
[02:14:12] Ah, good idea. Good idea. Well, Gage
[02:14:15] goes, "Yeah, actually there is a person.
[02:14:17] It's a guy Suga Sugar Steve. He uh he
[02:14:20] has lots of random stuff that and a lot
[02:14:22] of times he has things that can fully
[02:14:23] heal you. He's right around the
[02:14:26] corner or over here in the
[02:14:30] city. So,
[02:14:34] are you going to head out and go uh go
[02:14:36] visit Suge?
[02:14:45] Indeed you do. So you leave, you go to
[02:14:48] head over and you actually luckily
[02:14:49] headed around the corner not too far
[02:14:50] away. Get right over Trigger Steve and
[02:14:52] go, "Hey
[02:14:53] buddy, sent here by Gage." And goes,
[02:14:55] "Oh, hey." Sugar says, "So you have uh I
[02:14:59] need to get healed, right?" Is what
[02:15:00] you're asking
[02:15:02] for. So I'm trying to get healed
[02:15:05] here. Let's see if we can do this. We'll
[02:15:07] do this here. We'll run one. Let's run
[02:15:10] the weapon
[02:15:14] spot. Little discount for a minute
[02:15:17] here while we're playing. All right.
[02:15:20] You're looking for some healing. Well,
[02:15:21] Sugar goes, "You know
[02:15:23] what? They got something for
[02:15:26] you. We have a uh
[02:15:30] [Music]
[02:15:41] There it is. We have this we've been
[02:15:43] playing with. Now, it'll heal you about
[02:15:48] uh 45, sometimes 75 health. It's iffy
[02:15:52] really. It could be even less every now
[02:15:53] and again, but um the problem is you
[02:15:58] lose some
[02:16:00] agility in the process for for a couple
[02:16:04] of rounds. So, it's up to you what you'd
[02:16:06] like to
[02:16:07] do. Oh, big BK coming in on one of the
[02:16:10] uh spots. I like
[02:16:13] it. Anybody else want to jump
[02:16:15] in? I'll run
[02:16:19] another. Why not?
[02:16:22] You going to try it? All right. You
[02:16:23] going to take that? Now to take that. He
[02:16:26] goes, "I
[02:16:29] see you have
[02:16:33] uh bunch of weapons
[02:16:39] there. I would
[02:16:42] like a uh a weapon, please, cuz I need
[02:16:46] to protect myself.
[02:16:49] if you could supply me with something
[02:16:50] like maybe the uh the assault
[02:16:54] rifle that you have
[02:16:59] there. I greatly appreciate
[02:17:05] it. He wants the assault rifle
[02:17:08] big. You going to do it? That's almost
[02:17:12] full
[02:17:15] health. You got your gat. That is true.
[02:17:17] So you go, "All right, all right, fine."
[02:17:19] You hand him the assault rifle. He goes,
[02:17:21] "Oh, nice." And you see him
[02:17:23] just shooting all over the place and you
[02:17:25] go, "Oh, great. This is going to not end
[02:17:28] good." Sugar's all happy. He's got his
[02:17:30] assault rifle now. Sets it down on the
[02:17:32] counter, hands you your uh your bottle
[02:17:35] of experimental whiskey, healing
[02:17:38] whiskey, and uh goes, "All right, buddy.
[02:17:40] Have fun." Now you drink it. You lose
[02:17:43] two agility for two
[02:17:46] rounds, but you luckily have plus one
[02:17:48] agility. So, you're only down uh to
[02:17:50] minus one agility for a rand
[02:17:57] round. There we
[02:18:04] go.
[02:18:06] Boom. Deal
[02:18:08] done. You wander out.
[02:18:13] How do you know how much it healed you?
[02:18:15] You'll find out with the uh Where is
[02:18:22] that? That's what I was looking for.
[02:18:25] We're going to spin this before the
[02:18:27] because it's whiskey. I was going to
[02:18:28] spin this before your next uh thing to
[02:18:30] see if it healed you full or if it was
[02:18:32] uh a little bit less. Yes, I know. But
[02:18:35] you know what? We'll spin now. Why not?
[02:18:37] It was going to be like a whiskey. You
[02:18:39] You don't You don't really know. It's
[02:18:40] like a I was a oh [Â __Â ] You're wandering
[02:18:42] around. You're feeling pretty good and
[02:18:44] you don't know if you're healed to full.
[02:18:46] You're thinking you are cuz you get
[02:18:48] whiskey. You know what I mean? It's one
[02:18:50] of those uh little little trick of the
[02:18:52] whiskey. Time to go looting. All right.
[02:18:55] So, you head out into the city feeling
[02:18:57] pretty good. Your uh your strength is
[02:18:59] coming back to you and your
[02:19:03] uh yes, you do need some pogs. And uh
[02:19:06] you're feeling a little you're feeling a
[02:19:07] little uh dizzy and wobbly all over the
[02:19:08] place there.
[02:19:10] All right. But hey, it's all right.
[02:19:12] You're having fun. You're having a good
[02:19:13] time. So, we got a couple of those sold
[02:19:16] today. Now, if those don't happen to go,
[02:19:18] what we'll end up doing is I'll um I'll
[02:19:20] run this
[02:19:24] again tomorrow. But for the spots today,
[02:19:28] you'll have the option of um getting
[02:19:30] packs of equivalent value if you'd like
[02:19:33] or we can do a refund if you ask for it.
[02:19:35] That's all.
[02:19:38] Well, I don't like to roll it over just
[02:19:40] because it the timing of things has been
[02:19:42] a pain in the butt with whatnot
[02:19:43] recently. So, I don't want to cause any
[02:19:46] issues. Um, so that's why I'm like if we
[02:19:49] can just take care of it. That's why I
[02:19:50] was saying like do it now. Yeah, it just
[02:19:52] been they've been a pain in the butt
[02:19:53] with something. So, I want to make sure
[02:19:54] I'm doing stuff as as good as possible,
[02:19:56] as clear as
[02:19:57] possible. All right, cool. Thank you. I
[02:19:59] appreciate it, Mystic. So, we'll be here
[02:20:02] for another like probably half hour to
[02:20:03] an hour at the most. And what I'm going
[02:20:05] to do now though is let's see we have uh
[02:20:10] we'll do one of these. We'll run one of
[02:20:12] these for a minute. Why
[02:20:15] not? And we have just so those that are
[02:20:19] coming in from the um that'll come in.
[02:20:22] I'm going to put those
[02:20:24] there. That's what's in our brake.
[02:20:26] Actually, you know what? Let's do
[02:20:28] this. I wonder if I can do this cuz my
[02:20:31] camera can adjust. I always forget my
[02:20:33] camera can
[02:20:34] adjust. Do this. Do
[02:20:40] this.
[02:20:43] Aha. There. Ah. Show it
[02:20:46] all. Boom.
[02:20:50] [Laughter]
[02:20:52] Well, that's what you guys want to do.
[02:20:54] Let me know. Uh, and we'll get a we'll
[02:20:56] get a little adventuring
[02:21:00] going. All right. Well, you want to try
[02:21:02] a deal? All right, let's see. Uh, if I
[02:21:05] run
[02:21:09] um, I'll run them because I know
[02:21:12] sometimes you I know you guys have
[02:21:13] discounts with them, too, but I like to
[02:21:15] give you a discount because they
[02:21:17] normally go for I'm at what was it? That
[02:21:20] we'll do them like this. If anybody else
[02:21:23] would like to jump in, there you go. dig
[02:21:26] a little bit off on them. And we'll
[02:21:28] start we'll run all of them kind of like
[02:21:30] that instead of uh what it was before if
[02:21:33] you'd like to do
[02:21:35] those. I don't know if that sounds good
[02:21:37] or not, but that'll that's what I'll do.
[02:21:39] We'll go through and I'll run each
[02:21:45] one and then we'll uh have some fun
[02:21:48] checking out some adventuring with a
[02:21:50] little bit of a break here. We'll see
[02:21:53] what we
[02:21:53] have run into.
[02:22:03] All right.
[02:22:06] Loot in the meantime. I like it. All
[02:22:08] right. So, you got you go wandering
[02:22:09] around. You find some burnt out
[02:22:11] buildings
[02:22:14] there. All right. Mystic got that one.
[02:22:17] We'll run this
[02:22:19] one. Found some burnt out buildings.
[02:22:22] You're looking around and in that burnt
[02:22:24] out building, you find yourself an old
[02:22:26] locked
[02:22:28] chest. What do you want to try to do to
[02:22:30] uh get that open? Or do you want to uh
[02:22:33] leave that there? It's up to you, my
[02:22:34] friend. Big BK. I'm going to go like
[02:22:37] this and put these over here all
[02:22:40] together so you can see that in case we
[02:22:42] need to do a little
[02:22:43] roll. Look around first before you open
[02:22:46] it. That's a good idea. You take a look
[02:22:49] around before and you
[02:22:53] see one feral ghoul, but it is not up
[02:22:56] yet. It's kind of like in the ground
[02:22:57] there. All right, so you got to make a
[02:23:00] decision. It's like laying down. It's
[02:23:01] been there for a
[02:23:04] while. Uh, you're not sure if it's alive
[02:23:06] or
[02:23:09] dead. What are you going to do
[02:23:13] there? That's the feral ghoul we have.
[02:23:17] You going to try to be sneaky? All
[02:23:19] right. So, you slowly go to the chest or
[02:23:22] you go to
[02:23:31] it. Mad Max says don't touch it. He
[02:23:35] doesn't think it's a good idea. He
[02:23:36] thinks it looks pretty good. Gross. Try
[02:23:39] and open it. All right. So, you go
[02:23:40] wander
[02:23:41] over
[02:23:43] quietly. You got your You think you're
[02:23:45] being quiet, though. That's the problem.
[02:23:47] You You had You had some whiskey
[02:23:49] earlier. You You may be stronger, but
[02:23:52] you you thought you're being quiet.
[02:23:53] Really? Who knows if you really are
[02:23:55] being
[02:23:57] quiet? No. That's what alcohol does to
[02:23:59] you. You don't really know what you're
[02:24:02] doing even though you think you
[02:24:05] do. Oh god, the whiskey every time,
[02:24:08] right? I know, Mad Max. The whiskey
[02:24:10] every time. Well, you start opening that
[02:24:13] chest. You pop it open. You're like,
[02:24:14] "Sweet.
[02:24:16] Reach in, you find yourself an assault
[02:24:20] rifle. Well, look at that. A replacement
[02:24:23] and you find some ammo. That's nice. But
[02:24:27] you are not so
[02:24:30] quiet. That feral ghoul gets
[02:24:33] up and uh you are
[02:24:37] now in trouble. You have to make a
[02:24:41] decision. Mad Max, I know. Not good. Not
[02:24:45] good. No. What are you going to do? Then
[02:24:48] we're going to open up some packs here
[02:24:50] in a
[02:24:51] minute. Well, you thought you were uh Do
[02:24:54] you want to try and run or you going to
[02:24:58] attack? I put
[02:25:00] the Where did I put the the other one?
[02:25:03] Did I put it in
[02:25:06] here? Try and run. All right, that's a
[02:25:08] good idea. So, you pick your weapons up.
[02:25:10] You turn around. You try to
[02:25:12] run. Now, uh, now you did try and run.
[02:25:15] You did a good job. You got kind of far
[02:25:17] away. You're getting outside the door,
[02:25:18] but the whiskey got you. You
[02:25:22] trip. You trip. You fall over,

[02:25:35] dice? Oh, it's behind that. That's
[02:25:37] why. All right, here we go. So, it's
[02:25:39] going to be a one in4 chance that the
[02:25:42] ghoul is going to be able to hit you.
[02:25:44] It's the whiskey again. I know. Again,
[02:25:46] the
[02:25:48] whiskey. All right, here we go. Let's
[02:25:51] see. Is the whiskey going to get you?
[02:25:54] No, you were lucky. You actually got
[02:25:56] really lucky. You got a It's a one.
[02:25:58] You're able to get right up and run out
[02:26:00] of there. You got your AR. Now, the
[02:26:03] whiskey nicely. You had your encounter

[02:39:45] out. We go like this. Go.
[02:39:57] All right, I need somebody that is in
[02:40:00] the break to tell me when to stop

[02:40:08] out the uh secret layer. Put your names
[02:40:11] on them for your spots and you'll find
[02:40:13] out what you get there. So, someone in

[02:40:33] three, four, five, six. All right, so
[02:40:37] there's the
[02:40:38] six. Write your name
[02:40:40] down on each one of your spots
[02:40:44] specifically so we know which one's
[02:40:46] which. And you guys are going to have to
[02:40:48] tell me what you're getting for your
[02:40:49] your uh your thing. So, you have a
[02:40:51] weapon. Big
[02:40:56] BK. Mystic gets a health
[02:41:05] choice. Then we have Big BK gets a buff
[02:41:13] choice. Then we

[02:42:18] for your character and you get to roll
[02:42:21] the uh one out of four for seeing if uh
[02:42:26] actually no it's a one um yeah I can't
[02:42:29] remember if it's 50/50 or one out of
[02:42:30] four I have to look at what I did if the
[02:42:32] one that you can buy might be just a
[02:42:34] 50/50 chance of it of a doubling the
[02:42:36] damage or just keeping the damage but
[02:42:38] it's guaranteed hit and you don't have
[02:42:39] worry about uh missing type thing and
[02:42:42] you're that's kind of and you get to
[02:42:44] kind of pick where you go so you might
[02:42:45] be able to injure him somewhere. All
[02:42:47] right. So, you got to let me know when
[02:42:48] to stop shuffling if you're in the break

[02:45:16] hand out all the We'll hand the bulk
[02:45:18] out. Um, and what we'll

[02:45:28] I can get these away. Yeah. I'm sorry.
[02:45:29] Sometimes it happen. Well, you can't do
[02:45:31] that with the brakes. That's how the
[02:45:33] brakes roll every now and again. But at
[02:45:36] the moment, you got nice cars to go with
[02:45:37] it. It wasn't like you didn't get stuck
[02:45:39] with nothing. You got some good ones
[02:45:40] there. But we are some adventuring going
[02:45:44] on though. We're not done. You guys had
[02:45:46] to decide.
[02:45:48] You saw in front of you.
[02:45:52] Yeah. Exact. Yeah. Better. The scrawling
[02:45:54] crawlers are nice. Those scrawling
[02:45:55] crawlers are good. Pick good pickups.
[02:45:58] All right. Here you go. You guys are
[02:46:00] wandering and you have found in front of
[02:46:02] you, coming towards you,
[02:46:05] scanning, beeping, making noises, and in
[02:46:08] front of you all of a sudden is this
[02:46:10] what looks like a mechanized war drone.
[02:46:17] You have to decide.
[02:46:25] Are you going to
[02:46:29] Is Mystic here?
[02:46:32] I don't know. Mystic, are you in here,
[02:46:33] bud? Let us know.
[02:46:40] If not, you might need to call a call on
[02:46:42] another friend. You might need to phone
[02:46:44] a friend here.
[02:46:48] Oh, no worries. No worries.
[02:46:58] Yeah, he's got the cooler gat compared
[02:46:59] to you.
[02:47:01] All right, so you guys are uh right now
[02:47:04] you've got
[02:47:06] the this thing in front of you coming
[02:47:08] towards you. It scanned
[02:47:11] you. You guys are
[02:47:14] uh it looks like you're being zoned in
[02:47:17] on this. pauses for a second as it scans
[02:47:21] you and then it starts to race quicker
[02:47:25] towards the both of
[02:47:29] you. You need to tell
[02:47:32] me. Ah, two-year-old. Yep, I understand
[02:47:35] that, bud. I understand that. No
[02:47:36] worries. I've been there
[02:47:39] myself. All right, here we go. Let me
[02:47:42] know what y'all want to do with this
[02:47:46] [Music]
[02:47:48] uh robot coming racing towards you. We
[02:47:52] don't know what it is yet. It's a little
[02:47:55] Not exactly sure. You shooting your gun
[02:47:57] at that guy. All right. I think that's
[02:47:58] probably a good idea because it starts
[02:48:00] to
[02:48:01] uh unravel some
[02:48:04] weapons itself and prepares to shoot
[02:48:09] you.
[02:48:11] use your uh incendiary gat here. All
[02:48:14] right. And we're going to do this. We're
[02:48:15] just going to move some of these out of
[02:48:16] the way since everybody knows who's got
[02:48:18] what.
[02:48:21] All right. We're going to do this. Slide
[02:48:23] that up there. Slide that up there.
[02:48:26] Slide that over here. Do this. Put it in
[02:48:28] the middle where it's not touching any
[02:48:29] of the cards. And
[02:48:33] there we know what everybody got cuz
[02:48:35] there's video of it. It's recorded and
[02:48:37] saved everywhere.
[02:48:39] Oh, yes. Critical hit with a gat. I like
[02:48:42] it.
[02:48:45] Shooting the gat at him. All right,
[02:48:47] there we go. All right, critical hit.
[02:48:49] You both have
[02:48:51] uh a couple critical hits. So, you both
[02:48:54] are you both going to use them? Same
[02:48:55] critical hit. All right, you both use
[02:48:57] your critical hits. You both have your
[02:48:59] gut. You got the incendiary one, which
[02:49:01] gets you uh a seven for your roll. And
[02:49:04] this guy got has uh you got your uh
[02:49:07] alien
[02:49:08] gat that. So he's going rolling his
[02:49:10] weapons to shoot. And uh you go your gap
[02:49:14] first. All right. Try that out. And it
[02:49:17] is 81 18 to hit. But because you guys
[02:49:19] have uh what you have is going to bring
[02:49:21] it down to an 11 for you. Um and a 12
[02:49:25] for Mystic. So 12 for Mystic. Let's see
[02:49:28] if you can do 12 or higher. And oh my,
[02:49:30] you got a it's in the middle of them.
[02:49:32] I'm going to give you the 20.
[02:49:34] You got a natural 20, my friend. What?
[02:49:38] Um, you already rolled. You have
[02:49:40] critical. You're
[02:49:43] using Oh, a critical on top of a
[02:49:47] critical. I didn't expect
[02:49:49] that. Okay. Well, that's
[02:49:52] intriguing.
[02:49:53] Well,
[02:49:56] h this is what we're going to do. I've
[02:49:59] made a decision.
[02:50:11] since uh you're going to have a one out
[02:50:14] of eight
[02:50:15] chance. Uh well, I mean one to eight for
[02:50:17] your uh double there. Now you got 12 and
[02:50:23] uh that's 12 uh you got 20 damage also
[02:50:27] by the way. So you're going to get a one
[02:50:30] out of eight instead of one out of four
[02:50:31] chance or I mean as for I mean for the
[02:50:34] multiplication
[02:50:37] factor. Ah
[02:50:40] dude that
[02:50:42] sucks. You got
[02:50:46] one
[02:50:48] but you at least hit him for
[02:50:52] 20. Such a good
[02:50:55] chance. Wave interference. Do we do we
[02:50:57] call a
[02:50:58] [Laughter]
[02:51:01] reroll? Is that what you're saying?
[02:51:03] Reroll wave interference. All right,
[02:51:05] let's try let's try one more. Let's see
[02:51:07] what
[02:51:07] happens. You got one a second
[02:51:15] time. I'm I'm pretty sure it's telling
[02:51:17] you you should be happy with what you
[02:51:19] got. Oh my
[02:51:22] god. Wow. All right. Well, you hit him.
[02:51:26] That mechanized war drone is a uh 70
[02:51:30] health. You bring that guy down to 50,
[02:51:33] which is pretty good. Not bad. Now, our
[02:51:37] other friend there goes with theirs.
[02:51:40] You can only make up so many excuses.
[02:51:43] Big BK goes in. You need to have an 11
[02:51:46] or higher. And oh my god.
[02:51:57] Do you see that big
[02:51:59] BK, my
[02:52:01] friend? I'm I'm sorry there,
[02:52:06] dude. That's a critical
[02:52:10] miss. That's a critical miss, my friend.
[02:52:14] And uh well, your incendiary gun there
[02:52:16] that you used was
[02:52:19] wonderful until when you go to shoot it,
[02:52:22] one of those incendiaries pop right
[02:52:25] inside and uh your weapons now jammed
[02:52:29] and you
[02:52:30] lose some ammo in the
[02:52:34] process. So, Big
[02:52:36] BK, your uh your gat, you're now down to
[02:52:40] 10 ammo, and it's jammed, which means
[02:52:43] you only have two shots. I mean, uh
[02:52:45] three shots
[02:52:47] now. So, you're going to miss it for one
[02:52:50] shot. You can't use
[02:52:51] it. That was a a critical uh critical
[02:52:54] miss there, my friend. I'm sorry about
[02:52:56] that bot, though. That bot goes, I don't
[02:53:00] like getting hit. And he's going to go
[02:53:02] after you both with his own
[02:53:07] gat. Now that guy uses it. And oh, hold
[02:53:12] on. I thought I turned it
[02:53:13] off. Our buddy, you guys are lucky. You
[02:53:16] get a six on them. They get a six. They
[02:53:19] get a
[02:53:21] six. So that that guy, that mechanized
[02:53:25] war drone has its own
[02:53:27] jam and it misses the two of you. You
[02:53:31] are both exceptionally lucky right now.
[02:53:34] But it's either a good hit or you miss
[02:53:36] something or they miss. I don't I don't
[02:53:39] know how to handle it, guys. You guys
[02:53:40] are just on a on an unbelievable either
[02:53:43] it's really good or really bad luck. But
[02:53:45] either way, it ends up working out. I
[02:53:47] mean, wow. Wow. You got lucky. I know.
[02:53:50] Now, what what's going on now? You going
[02:53:52] to have you going to attack Mystic
[02:53:54] again? I'm guessing you're going with
[02:53:56] your
[02:53:57] uh with your gat. You have your alien
[02:53:59] gat. All right, mystic
[02:54:04] shoots with the alien
[02:54:05] gat that you have and you hit oh a 19
[02:54:09] and you get um 10 12 damage with your
[02:54:14] alien
[02:54:17] gat. Nice one on that. So it goes from
[02:54:21] 50
[02:54:24] down to uh 38.
[02:54:32] There you go, my friend.
[02:54:36] Not bad. Now you can't use You're going
[02:54:40] to fix your gun. All right. You did hit
[02:54:42] last time. That is true. You did hit
[02:54:44] last time. Correct. You hit it. You hit
[02:54:46] for 20 damage. You just didn't get the
[02:54:48] multiple criticals on it. That's all.
[02:54:49] You hit it 20, though. All right.
[02:54:54] Yes. Your your gun is jammed. So, you're
[02:54:55] going to take the minute to to uh to fix
[02:54:57] it. All right. I like it. You take this
[02:54:59] roll to fix. All right. Let's see if you
[02:55:02] can fix it right away or if it's going
[02:55:04] to take uh some time.
[02:55:08] Yep. He has to fix his correct.
[02:55:12] Oh, well, you got you have I was going
[02:55:14] to give Look at that. You got 12. You
[02:55:16] have luck. So, you have 11 or higher and
[02:55:18] you got 12. Nice. All right. They need a
[02:55:21] 50/50 for them. So, here's our coin that
[02:55:24] we use for 50/50. Actually, we're just
[02:55:26] going to roll this cuz right now the
[02:55:27] dice are in here and then it's not in
[02:55:28] the way. It's all right. Has to be 10 or
[02:55:31] higher, right? I think Oh no, they
[02:55:33] missed. They are still jammed. You guys
[02:55:36] got lucky. They got a seven.
[02:55:39] The mechanized war drone is jammed for
[02:55:41] one more
[02:55:42] round. And you're not now. You don't He
[02:55:45] doesn't shoot. So Mystic, it's on you
[02:55:47] again. You guys get
[02:55:49] lucky. Anyways, you start
[02:55:53] blasting. All right.
[02:55:56] Well, no. We start blasting
[02:56:00] with your incendiary.
[02:56:04] And there we
[02:56:09] go. And you hit for 16, you get the
[02:56:13] damage on it. So, you get
[02:56:16] 10 18 damage. Nice shot. And now it also
[02:56:20] one of the nice things is because it's
[02:56:22] incendiary, you uh
[02:56:25] actually with the uh 16 there, they're a
[02:56:29] little bit uh they have some electronic
[02:56:32] malfunctions. So you now go down to
[02:56:37] um they bring it down to 22 health, but
[02:56:40] it loses one the use of one of its
[02:56:43] weapons. And then our buddy here,
[02:56:46] uh, Mythic goes in with theirs,
[02:56:52] right? Or did you already shoot? Yeah,
[02:56:56] Mythic's going to go in with theirs.
[02:56:58] Their laser gat, I'm
[02:57:01] guessing. Their gay alien gat, right?
[02:57:03] Right. Yeah, I'm guessing since that
[02:57:06] we've been using. And Oh
[02:57:08] no, you missed. You got a nine. It was a
[02:57:12] close one. You fist bumped mid combat.
[02:57:15] Nice one, buddy. Melted some wiring.
[02:57:18] Exactly. Melted some wiring. One of the
[02:57:20] arms isn't working. Now that guy goes
[02:57:22] after you only has one arm. It has to
[02:57:26] have a 14 or higher to hit. And it
[02:57:28] misses. Oh, look at that. You miss. It
[02:57:30] got a
[02:57:31] 10. You guys are lucky. The mechanized
[02:57:34] war drone is still malfunctioning
[02:57:36] slightly. And it's back on to
[02:57:38] you. What you doing, my friend?
[02:57:42] All right, here we
[02:57:43] go. Keep it going. Oh, and 15. You hit
[02:57:47] him
[02:57:48] for five.
[02:57:51] 12. Well, my friend, you go from uh 22
[02:57:56] minus 12. Bring it down to
[02:58:01] 10. It starts uh sparking a bit,
[02:58:04] malfunctioning a bit more. Kind of
[02:58:06] spinning in
[02:58:07] circles. Uh-oh.
[02:58:10] Mystic, do you think you can uh take it
[02:58:13] out? You think you can take it out,
[02:58:17] Mystic? Oh, yeah. And then Oh, wow. It
[02:58:20] lands on top of each other. Well, that
[02:58:22] isn't too fun. So, you know what I'm
[02:58:25] going to do? Let me just say, well, I
[02:58:26] think you killed it anyways. I was going
[02:58:28] to say that's a times two cuz it landed
[02:58:29] on top of each other. But, uh, that
[02:58:32] would be
[02:58:34] 10 14. Uh, yeah, it's dead. Nice. You
[02:58:39] shoot it and that mechanized war drone
[02:58:40] spins around a few more times and
[02:58:43] then
[02:58:45] explodes. You see a little
[02:58:48] explosion and when it explodes out
[02:58:53] blows a bunch of ammo that you guys get
[02:58:56] to use for
[02:58:57] your gatling guns. So, one for you, some
[02:59:00] plasma stuff for our buddy there since
[02:59:02] that's what your alien gatling gun I
[02:59:03] mean uses.
[02:59:05] And you also both find
[02:59:11] Where'd it go? I thought I had another
[02:59:13] one. Hold on.
[02:59:20] You both find two of the uh slammers,
[02:59:22] which is our pogs or wasteland currency.
[02:59:24] You find two more. So, that gets you 20
[02:59:26] pogs each added to you. And then on top
[02:59:30] of that, you also
[02:59:33] um each of you
[02:59:35] find an agility. Well, not that
[02:59:39] one. Sorry. They're gonna go with this
[02:59:41] one. We're gonna use this. This is going
[02:59:43] to be our engineering booster for the
[02:59:44] time being because I don't know where it
[02:59:46] went. You both find an engineering
[02:59:48] booster. So, there you go. You refill
[02:59:52] your things. You get a bunch of that.
[02:59:54] And then for your bosses now, since you
[02:59:57] refill all that, you also get some scrap
[03:00:00] metal, which I don't have the scrap
[03:00:02] metal here. I used to have it which you
[03:00:05] might be able to use to uh create some
[03:00:08] armor or uh uh upgrade your weapons with
[03:00:12] and something like that. Now, your
[03:00:14] others, let's see. I do have We do like
[03:00:17] to throw in a health pack for you guys
[03:00:21] each. And uh I think that's all we have
[03:00:25] here after that guy blew up was our It's
[03:00:27] the scrap metal. I forgot to make the
[03:00:28] images for that one. But you got some
[03:00:29] scrap metal and you got some electronic
[03:00:32] parts. So maybe you can upgrade
[03:00:34] something. Oh, you take his metal pieces
[03:00:37] as a trophy. I like it. Metal pieces as
[03:00:41] a trophy for our buddy our buddy uh
[03:00:44] Mystic. So uh let's go and find Mystic
[03:00:47] here and go um he now has metal metal
[03:00:49] pieces.
[03:01:00] Metal
[03:01:03] pieces. Metal
[03:01:06] pieces. Some metal
[03:01:12] pieces. Mystic has 100
[03:01:15] pogs. Big BK does not. So he I'm
[03:01:19] guessing Big BK is wondering if he can
[03:01:20] take some of the pogs there. those those
[03:01:22] pogs there for them. What do we say?
[03:01:26] What I'm going to do here while we're
[03:01:27] waiting, I'm going to pull these out and
[03:01:29] finish the uh the rest of handing out
[03:01:31] the um the commons and uncommons while
[03:01:34] you're deciding what you're going to do
[03:01:37] here from the break. All
[03:01:44] right, there we go.
[03:01:50] Yeah. and decide what you want to
[03:01:53] do. All right, sounds good. I'm going to
[03:01:55] have uh a trade where you do one of the
[03:01:59] uh so you get 10 mystic takes and our
[03:02:03] buddy Big BK takes 30
[03:02:09] pogs. Nice nice uh friendly having some
[03:02:13] friends here.

[03:02:27] nicely. So, there we go. All of the um
[03:02:30] bulk has been handed out.
[03:02:34] Also, you need 30 to get your armor.

[00:26:12] remember we do have the other stuff that
[00:26:15] we do regularly it is a Friday morning
[00:26:19] so maybe we'll do an adventure
[00:26:21] game we like the adventures
[00:26:24] right now it stinks because my
[00:26:28] Thunder Junction did not come in today
[00:26:31] so with that
[00:26:34] occurring I um had to adjust how my game
[00:26:38] is being played here it was going to be
[00:26:41] where there was Thunder Junction stuff
[00:26:43] in and you were going to be shooting you
[00:26:44] know I know shooting is probably not the
[00:26:46] best thing to be doing but you were
[00:26:47] gonna they gonna have you target your
[00:26:49] box there I was going have a Target go
[00:26:51] up on screen and uh and you you know

[00:26:57] wait until our Sunday show we're going
[00:26:59] to be doing that on the Sunday show I
[00:27:01] guess when hopefully it comes in today
[00:27:04] this afternoon by the rest of my stuff
[00:27:07] so we'll see if the my stuff does come
[00:27:08] in or not hopefully it all does but I
[00:27:11] hate the shipping things my ship went
[00:27:13] shipping doesn't always work for me so
[00:27:14] this is why I need to get stuff from a
[00:27:16] uh a different distributor so I can get
[00:27:18] it
[00:27:19] early and not have to worry about that
[00:27:21] way if it's only like a day or two late

[00:27:25] about it so here we go we're going to

[02:50:32] armor you find some leather armor with a
[02:50:34] jaded cell
[02:50:36] swword going after the soul spy Soul
[02:50:38] knife spy where you fly to the Druid
[02:50:42] class on the
[02:50:45] plains where drizzit dordan oh I love
[02:50:48] drizzit it was a good I love that book
[02:50:50] where drizzit
[02:50:51] dordan hurls you through
[02:50:54] hell with the black staff of Water Deep
[02:50:57] to find Gretchen twitch Willow fighting
[02:51:00] Faraday's devil
[02:51:02] chosen over Oswald fiddle
[02:51:06] Bender well Jin Wier La last in the
[02:51:09] background holding the dragon orb orb of
[02:51:13] the Dragon
[02:51:14] kind I like that orb with your treasure
[02:51:17] token not bad there not bad there not
[02:51:22] bad you splend it
[02:51:26] Oswald not bad like them we like them
[02:51:30] there you go Celestial and I do it like
[02:51:31] this because I do this for shipping I
[02:51:33] put them back to back so that they don't
[02:51:35] slide out of the things I'm not sure
[02:51:37] about Oswald and those so I'm going to
[02:51:38] double check on it it makes it so they
[02:51:40] don't slide out of the top loaders uh
[02:51:43] most people I've never had anybody
[02:51:45] complain but if for whatever reason you
[02:51:47] want me to put it individually I will
[02:51:48] always do that like somebody asked me to
[02:51:50] do an individual one earlier and I will
[02:51:52] definitely do that for them because
[02:51:54] that's the request that you
[02:51:56] have there we
[02:51:59] go my friend all right
[02:52:02] cool yeah it's because if I'll show you
[02:52:04] what I mean when I'm talking about when
[02:52:05] packing because when you pack them up
[02:52:07] and you put them in two of them together
[02:52:10] this is what happens it's the nice thing
[02:52:12] about it here all right you do this put
[02:52:15] them in here and you got you got to
[02:52:16] spread the top out a little bit so they
[02:52:18] can get in but once you get them in
[02:52:21] there physics keeps them from coming out
[02:52:25] I don't need to put a piece of tape over
[02:52:26] it or anything I just
[02:52:29] go and they are not coming out of that
[02:52:32] container that's why I like doing two of
[02:52:34] them like that but there you go got your
[02:52:36] Glam
[02:52:38] dring resplendant
[02:52:40] Angel LCI set good ones there
[02:52:45] Celestial let me get your name written
[02:52:47] down
[02:52:51] in the top loader yep
[02:52:55] uh one second I'll tell you
[02:53:03] blacks the one in the top loader we have
[02:53:06] Glam dring is your top loader here and
[02:53:10] hurl through hell I put in there because
[02:53:12] I wasn't sure on
[02:53:13] it in resplendant Angel cuz resplendant
[02:53:17] Angel used to be hit uh with lost
[02:53:20] Caverns I'm not sure on what it is now
[02:53:22] but that's why I put it in
[02:53:27] there it's one of those things where the
[02:53:29] cards somebody came in and told me
[02:53:31] before the cards fluctuate like
[02:53:33] gold and it's hard to it's hard to know
[02:53:35] what the prices are when they do that so
[02:53:38] because of that I have like an idea of
[02:53:40] where they used to be because I open the
[02:53:42] pack at some point to get it but that's
[02:53:44] about
[02:53:45] it here you go my funy buddy slash
[02:53:52] thank you very

[03:18:30] that give us a little bit of time here
[03:18:32] and let's see what we want to talk
[03:18:36] about nothing much no but I just have
[03:18:39] this cool snack box that I think friend

[03:18:56] want a camera that I can plug in for
[03:18:58] using this it'll be
[03:18:59] good does anybody have one or recommend
[03:19:03] one so that's kind of where I'm at at
[03:19:04] the moment trying to figure out what to
[03:19:07] do yeah you got yeah I got two of them
[03:19:12] and they said they had good reviews but
[03:19:14] they did not work well in low light and
[03:19:16] anyway shape or form so I needed to get
[03:19:18] like different I need to get something
[03:19:20] different I don't know what it is so I
[03:19:22] don't know maybe you guys can help me
[03:19:24] figure it
[03:19:26] out throw a pogman battle
[03:19:29] out why not throw it out with
[03:19:32] this throw it out with
[03:19:35] that and
[03:19:39] this do those
[03:19:43] two anybody do like video stuff or
[03:19:46] camera stuff that has any um insight for
[03:19:51] me hey Champion Jerry we just got got a
[03:19:54] little pogman battle you're going to get
[03:19:55] these two packs plus we see if you have
[03:19:58] enough strength to beat the boss at the
[03:19:59] end to be able to have a uh Adventure in
[03:20:03] the Wasteland but it's up to you all if
[03:20:06] we get that luck to beat the boss with
[03:20:08] that Adventure in the Wasteland
[03:20:14] there no one wants those ones either we
[03:20:17] did singles earlier no one of the
[03:20:19] singles maybe I do some of these ones
[03:20:21] all right hold
[03:20:23] on I to figure some stuff out
[03:20:31] here let's do these
[03:20:35] ones let's put this out maybe this is
[03:20:37] why I'm guessing this is going to be
[03:20:38] taken some people will go after these
[03:20:41] ones at least one of these
[03:20:44] ones that is my guess
[03:20:48] I'm guessing it's because the type the
[03:20:50] cards that I'm putting out and I'm
[03:20:51] guessing people are looking for Thunder
[03:20:53] Junction which is also my problem at the
[03:20:54] moment with everything going
[03:20:57] on yeah it just sucks I have a bunch of
[03:21:01] a bunch of bad luck put together a lot
[03:21:04] speed bumps a lot of speed bumps I
[03:21:06] wouldn't call them speed bumps they're
[03:21:07] more like [ __ ] bullet holes in a car
[03:21:09] as you drive
[03:21:11] byes no this is more like [ __ ]
[03:21:13] ditches that you fall into and you
[03:21:15] disappear forever
[03:21:18] what are those [ __ ] things those are
[03:21:19] the uh sink holes sink holes all over
[03:21:21] the [ __ ] place I keep
[03:21:23] hitting sorry for saring we're gonna do
[03:21:26] a uh you get one of these pick which one
[03:21:29] you want all right and then we do a
[03:21:33] little uh a little game here we call
[03:21:35] high low you pick if it's high or low on
[03:21:37] the bottom of the card and depending on
[03:21:39] what it is is how many rolls you get to
[03:21:40] see if you can beat the boss at the end
[03:21:42] of the Wasteland here for uh A Wasteland
[03:21:45] back being dropped for everyone Loop
[03:21:54] hat no one wanted
[03:21:58] Fallout that stinks so it is what I'm
[03:22:03] expecting
[03:22:05] yep all right let's do um some different
[03:22:10] different ones now these aren't going to
[03:22:12] start for a
[03:22:13] dollar all right
[03:22:19] if I do these I don't think I'm going to
[03:22:20] start these ones at a
[03:22:26] dollar we'll put
[03:22:29] out these
[03:22:32] three I'm not exactly sure what the
[03:22:34] prices on these three have gone to
[03:22:38] but my luck is they're probably like
[03:22:41] high up there and I'm uh I'm going to
[03:22:43] eat a bunch of money that I could have
[03:22:44] taken but that's okay I don't mind
[03:22:46] giving away some stuff to people that
[03:22:47] want to get cards so we're going to put
[03:22:49] these ones out for our Hyo all
[03:22:54] right we're going to put out a Serge

[03:31:31] picked it up and I went to look myself
[03:31:33] what's on the bottom like wait a minute
[03:31:34] he can see that we got high but every
[03:31:38] time because you make a purchase you do
[03:31:40] get one roll no matter what so you got
[03:31:43] one roll you get one roll here
[03:31:46] we going to move these around a little
[03:31:48] bit so that the next time we
[03:31:50] play there we go one roll what are we
[03:31:53] going to do here let's see if we get any
[03:31:55] luck four all right four four strength
[03:31:59] again let's see what you have for the
[03:32:03] boss which boss are you going up against
[03:32:06] one through
[03:32:08] 10 two one two we have a boss in this
[03:32:14] Wasteland as you wander through it as
[03:32:16] you're over
[03:32:18] encumbered having a hard time stumbling
[03:32:20] through over encumbered here and you go
[03:32:23] and you see a vault and you go wonderful
[03:32:24] I get to get myself some rest but out in
[03:32:26] front of you jumps oh look at that Owen
[03:32:31] where is it wait no that's not the Owen
[03:32:33] I was looking
[03:32:36] for where's Owen
[03:32:40] Owen Owen jumps out in front of
[03:32:44] you and he's swi wings but you know what
[03:32:48] you're stronger than him you have four
[03:32:51] instead of
[03:32:52] two so you come out with a big big bang
[03:32:55] on that hit now pick which one of these
[03:32:57] you want there and we're gonna have a
[03:32:59] Loot drop in our Wasteland now because
[03:33:02] you beat the
[03:33:04] boss whenever you beat the boss we do a
[03:33:07] Loot drop in our
[03:33:09] Wasteland so this Loot drop I'm going to
[03:33:11] put it out like
[03:33:13] this you get to pick any one of these
[03:33:15] every time you play one of the games you
[03:33:16] get to pick one of those one of our our
[03:33:19] loot packs I mean one of our um Vault
[03:33:22] packs here because uh you always get to
[03:33:24] the Vault and pick one but our loot pack
[03:33:26] that I'm going to put out right
[03:33:28] now I'm going to put this out that's
[03:33:30] going to be what our calls our Loop pack
[03:33:32] number seven one two three four five six
[03:33:36] seven all right here you go this is what
[03:33:39] you get my friend you got a Benji and in
[03:33:42] that Benji you have found
[03:33:46] a pack of cards from
[03:33:49] 1990 they are comic ball Looney Tunes
[03:33:53] well now that is interesting do you want
[03:33:55] to open those or would you like me to
[03:33:57] ship those home to you my
[03:34:00] friend I don't remember seeing those
[03:34:02] ones those are must be new ones that my
[03:34:03] kids put in the that my kids got in
[03:34:08] there ship it alrighty my
[03:34:12] friend we will do that
[03:34:16] and
[03:34:17] Jerry let's get you in
[03:34:21] here take your feral
[03:34:23] ghoul and your other one and we're gonna
[03:34:26] get those in a top loader right now this
[03:34:28] is what I like to do with the top
[03:34:29] loaders by the way most people don't
[03:34:32] care because it keeps them stiff in the
[03:34:34] top loader and they don't fall out of
[03:34:36] the top loader if you do not want me to
[03:34:38] do this Jerry I will do them
[03:34:40] individually but what happens is physics
[03:34:44] keeps them in the T offloader so you
[03:34:46] don't need to put like a piece of tape
[03:34:47] on it or anything like that you know
[03:34:49] like just the the the pushing of the of
[03:34:53] everything together keeps them on so
[03:34:55] there you go look at that that's the
[03:34:57] reason why I like doing that keeps them
[03:34:59] all
[03:35:00] together there we go Jerry thank you my
[03:35:07] friend and I'm GNA go what's throw out
[03:35:10] uh let's throw out some something else

[03:35:14] because we have our Loop drop going
[03:35:19] we have our Loot drop oh I didn't start
[03:35:21] it damn it The Loot drop didn't start
[03:35:24] give me one

[03:35:36] it does not get done as a
[03:35:40] um sudden
[03:35:43] death and I always give it
[03:35:46] a little bit so here's your loot drop

[03:49:47] in snaring Bridge surge oil combat
[03:49:50] research and legalist quick

[03:50:02] G to put this up you're GNA pick one of
[03:50:05] these whichever one you want you choose
[03:50:08] all right and then afterwards on the
[03:50:11] bottom of these Legos here it says an at
[03:50:13] and Al for higher
[03:50:15] low then we roll if you get depending on
[03:50:18] how many you get correct we that's how
[03:50:19] many times we roll for a chance to go up
[03:50:21] against the boss where if you beat the
[03:50:23] boss we do a $1 Loot drop which is a
[03:50:26] pack of cards that I put up for a dollar
[03:50:28] could be anything from Mystery booster
[03:50:30] to a uh a collector booster of some kind

[03:50:50] bti in and then whoever has the highest
[03:50:52] bid says which card they want that's the

[03:50:57] what's on the bottom of all three of the
[03:50:58] Legos to do the rest of the
[03:51:05] game all right so we did not want those

[03:56:10] going to be
[03:56:12] Fallout to Fallout

[03:56:29] do two Fallout and a lost Caverns or the
[03:56:34] one
[03:56:37] ring yep one or the
[03:56:41] other this is this is a a little bit a
[03:56:44] mini version of what we were going to be
[03:56:45] doing of our single Showdown by the way
[03:56:47] this is what we're going to be doing for
[03:56:48] the single
[03:56:49] Showdown but we didn't get our um
[03:56:53] our Outlaws in in time so I I have I had
[03:56:58] to make a little bit of adjustment
[03:57:00] that's why I don't have it the exact way
[03:57:01] I want it so here we go this is what
[03:57:03] we're GNA do here we GNA just do this
[03:57:06] single um what call the uh
[03:57:12] Showdown Showdown
[03:57:17] single or packs this is Will's idea by
[03:57:21] the way yeah this was Will's idea by the
[03:57:23] way he said do something where you put
[03:57:26] stuff up and I'm like all right we can
[03:57:27] do
[03:57:29] that where they have an option of one or
[03:57:32] the
[03:57:33] other all
[03:57:35] right no that wasn't supposed to go in
[03:57:39] there as giveaway why did it go in as a
[03:57:41] giveaway supposed to be an an auction
[03:57:44] damn
[03:57:47] it yeah no
[03:57:51] Showdown
[03:57:55] Showdown single or
[03:57:59] packs start this one at
[03:58:06] this okay going to put those in there
[03:58:09] like
[03:58:11] that maybe that
[03:58:14] we're going to do that all right I don't
[03:58:16] know if anybody's going to want to do
[03:58:17] this
[03:58:18] but I'll put it out
[03:58:22] there this was a little version of this
[03:58:24] is going to be a version of Showdown my
[03:58:27] youngest had thought of we were going to
[03:58:28] put up some nice cards then we were
[03:58:31] going to put up a good deal on packs
[03:58:33] next to it like a really good deal on
[03:58:35] packs next to it so we have a one ring
[03:58:39] surge
[03:58:41] foil or
[03:58:44] two Fallout in a caverns of souls I me
[03:58:47] not a caverns of Souls Lost
[03:58:50] Caverns that's what we got going right
[03:58:52] now start the auction
[03:58:56] here start at this and we do not do
[03:58:59] sudden death with these ones that's one
[03:59:00] of the things that we did not do so here
[03:59:02] you go try it out if you want I don't
[03:59:04] know if anybody's want it that's what he
[03:59:06] was saying to try to
[03:59:09] do maybe you do maybe you don't but you
[03:59:12] have a surge foil One
[03:59:16] Ring extended art
[03:59:19] or two collector boosters of
[03:59:22] follow and a lost Cavern collector
[03:59:31] booster ah nope I guess it's not what
[03:59:34] people wanted to do then all right I'll
[03:59:36] put those
[03:59:39] back put those back I'll see if I have
[03:59:41] others that we can do out but that was
[03:59:43] kind of a a an example of The Showdown
[03:59:46] that will thought we should be doing
[03:59:49] there now if there's another so we'll uh
[03:59:53] we'll leave that
[03:59:55] there see that was a version of The
[03:59:57] Showdown like he was thinking so like
[03:59:59] what we would do I was I was hoping to
[04:00:02] have the Outlaws here because what we
[04:00:04] would have been doing would have been
[04:00:05] like this I'll do it again here we'll
[04:00:08] put
[04:00:09] bridge bridge up here's our
[04:00:12] Showdown Bridge of cazado Doom that's a
[04:00:16] and snaring Bridge surge foil then we're
[04:00:19] going to put
[04:00:22] out
[04:00:24] this
[04:00:26] and
[04:00:28] this all
[04:00:31] right so you get either Bridge of cazad
[04:00:34] Doom or you're G to get a Dungeons and
[04:00:39] Dragons and a mystery and that's a good
[04:00:41] deal on both of those
[04:00:42] packs and that bridge of cast Doom is a

[04:47:43] stinks because I don't have any of the
[04:47:44] other [ __ ] things to open either when
[04:47:45] it's slow like this because the whole
[04:47:47] point was I would open the other box to
[04:47:49] get singles and things out of it you
[04:47:50] know to S to do the single Showdown with
[04:47:52] that's the whole point of it I'd be
[04:47:53] opening like oh this is a good one let's
[04:47:55] do it with this here we open it he
[04:47:57] coming out for The Showdown you know and
[04:47:58] that was the whole point of it but we
[04:47:59] can't do it without the [ __ ] [ __ ]
[04:48:01] here sorry for swearing a little bit
[04:48:02] guys got a little what was I getting up
[04:48:06] for he's getting up for something
[04:48:15] maybe we do this and you just want some
[04:48:30] boxes that's what it was I was going to
[04:48:32] grab this
[04:48:33] out see what I got
[04:48:36] here if anybody wants to uh jump in on
[04:48:40] these
[04:48:44] well no I'm going to open something for
[04:48:45] my family it's a little family pack this
[04:48:48] is the last of our Infinity that we had
[04:48:49] for the family so going to see if we
[04:48:51] have any luck with
[04:48:52] it no one wants to do any of those let's
[04:48:56] see is lunchtime so I wanted to wait
[04:48:58] until lunchtime before I do the buyers
[04:49:00] giveaway because I feel like the people
[04:49:03] will be able to be back around then so
[04:49:06] uh maybe we put out our um high low game
[04:49:09] again for a minute all right maybe
[04:49:11] that's what we do put out high low for a
[04:49:13] minute here but first I want to see if I
[04:49:17] get any luck on something myself so I've
[04:49:19] been trying to get
[04:49:21] myself one of the Galaxy shocks but I
[04:49:25] don't think we're going to even get any
[04:49:26] in this box because I ended up selling
[04:49:29] the Box offer do it which had the Galaxy
[04:49:31] shock in it so I probably won't get it
[04:49:34] since we have not gotten any shocks out
[04:49:35] of any of this box at all so I'm
[04:49:37] guessing that that was the shock
[04:49:40] yeah no no ticket tomaton grabby Tabby
[04:49:45] minur deforce glitter flitter night
[04:49:49] shift of the Living
[04:50:05] Dead autograph book
[04:50:24] why is this going so
[04:50:36] slow why is this going so slow
[04:50:48] Red Dot all right so the red button
[04:50:50] pretty much um there is anything there's
[04:50:54] cards in there 16 it's down I think like
[04:50:55] 1300 now but the cars that are in there
[04:50:58] they are anything from um 10 cents up to
[04:51:02] about a dollar and
[04:51:07] change um so with that being said with
[04:51:10] the 10 cents up to a dollar and
[04:51:12] change um they most of them are under 50
[04:51:15] cents though and they are really there
[04:51:17] because there's something written on
[04:51:18] them you either get a pack that's
[04:51:19] written on them or U maybe the box that
[04:51:22] says The Collector booster on it but
[04:51:23] it's really finding which ones that are
[04:51:25] on there that I have that in there so I
[04:51:26] don't have uh there's only a few of them
[04:51:28] there but here that's what the red
[04:51:30] button is there for
[04:51:32] that bonds chamber Grand Marshall Macy
[04:51:38] nice Grand Marshall
[04:51:41] Now You See Me space bellerin oh look at
[04:51:44] that all right it's not too bad for us

[04:51:52] uh Galaxy foil on that one space family
[04:51:56] ginson

[04:52:09] foil I I not get a shot Rock land but I
[04:52:11] did get a couple of those and a nice
[04:52:13] couple of cards there those are a couple
[04:52:14] nice cards though those are going to be
[04:52:16] hard to complain
[04:52:20] about so
[04:52:26] yeah okay
[04:52:45] huh
[04:52:50] interesting having some problems
[04:52:54] here more technical
[04:53:02] difficulties yeah I can't yeah whatever
[04:53:06] right on right now yeah I know it's

[05:04:46] konob bot I don't know what konob bot is

[05:04:58] because I think fian was one that was up
[05:05:00] there at one point not lot sure about

[05:05:05] big hit but I think that's you know it's

[00:01:12] right I see where you see everything
[00:01:14] there you don't see all that you know
[00:01:16] what we're going have to do this then
[00:01:17] we're going have to go like
[00:01:18] this going to zoom in we're going to put
[00:01:21] these together a little bit more
[00:01:25] then and we going do that there we go
[00:01:29] that way we can get those in
[00:01:31] there you can at least get those kind of
[00:01:33] in there a little bit there we go you
[00:01:37] like have those in
[00:01:39] there
[00:01:42] there there I like having those in the
[00:01:45] view and then my new uh my new knife my
[00:01:48] new uh my new pair of scissors right
[00:01:52] there here we go character our little
[00:01:55] our little Stratos FIA and our erra eay
[00:02:00] I don't know what I'm going to do with
[00:02:01] these in a boat we'll have to figure out
[00:02:02] how to stick those down easily because
[00:02:04] those aren't going to stick down too
[00:02:08] well so well either way though it looks
[00:02:11] like I do have it it looks like it's
[00:02:12] view pretty straight now I think we got
[00:02:15] this in we good I think we're good
[00:02:19] here looks like I can see everything all
[00:02:21] right now let's do this Venture packs
[00:02:24] well we're going have to zoom in we're
[00:02:25] going to shrink that one down a little
[00:02:28] make that a little smaller
[00:02:33] and do
[00:02:40] this all right make it a little bit
[00:02:41] bigger
[00:02:43] now there you
[00:02:46] go move that over and you should be able
[00:02:48] to see those better and then we're going
[00:02:50] to put out our character which is below
[00:02:53] it
[00:02:55] nice shrink that up a little bit that
[00:02:58] way you can see the character the same
[00:02:59] size and
[00:03:01] place right below those are our
[00:03:04] characters that we got there that we've
[00:03:06] been doing and there we are all righty I
[00:03:09] think we can see oh I'm gonna make me a
[00:03:11] little bit smaller because it looks like
[00:03:14] um might not be able to see
[00:03:18] me so let's do this
[00:03:21] here we go
[00:03:23] uh zoom in on that
[00:03:30] we'll go like
[00:03:33] this oh oh let move me
[00:03:41] over there we go then we'll do
[00:03:45] that the X3 we'll zoom in that one
[00:03:52] too there we go we'll move those all
[00:03:56] up all the way to the top there because
[00:04:00] we do see all the way top it's just like
[00:04:01] for some reason we don't see all the the
[00:04:03] sides on some of them which is weird it
[00:04:06] takes me a little to figure it out every
[00:04:07] day that's I think that's what it
[00:04:11] is oh oh
[00:04:16] M no why is it being silly why is it
[00:04:20] being silly right now
[00:04:34] there we go now it's letting me move it
[00:04:39] up we go we move that one
[00:04:45] up we can move that one up and you guys
[00:04:47] can see everything better here there we
[00:04:50] go so now all you guys should be able to
[00:04:52] see everything pretty
[00:04:54] good do like that and zoom that one
[00:04:57] in so you can see that all better now ah
[00:05:02] like I did it there we go better this is
[00:05:05] so Androids can see because I guess
[00:05:07] Androids have a little bit of a
[00:05:08] different view here than the rest of us
[00:05:11] uh that's some of the people on the
[00:05:12] computer and on Mac so uh Apple so well

[00:08:51] is is let's let uh let's let everybody
[00:08:54] know where our adventure is we have our
[00:08:56] wat knau characters so we are at the
[00:08:58] point where we just got a new male
[00:09:01] character that we made all
[00:09:05] right and I
[00:09:07] believe we are aware we just beat off we
[00:09:10] beat some we beat a uh creature now
[00:09:14] we're uh we're wandering through the
[00:09:15] Wasteland if I remember right and where
[00:09:17] we're at is as we wander through this
[00:09:19] Wasteland is uh Wasteland Adventure let
[00:09:22] me get down here make sure I have the
[00:09:24] right right one
[00:09:33] all right sir Jim jam and Xavier have
[00:09:35] been made I think that's what it was
[00:09:38] there we went to a place we got a little
[00:09:39] rusty uh Rusty rifle was found we had
[00:09:43] some stem packs we beat a little uh we
[00:09:45] had beaten a boss a kind of a mini one
[00:09:47] of the bosses right at the end and
[00:09:49] gotten some of the things and that's
[00:09:50] where we were at I believe is we had
[00:09:52] beaten one of the last bosses and we had
[00:09:55] gotten our final one of our other
[00:09:58] buddies here to help out with us that
[00:10:00] name was uh we hadn't figured out yet we
[00:10:03] had to create our new our new creature
[00:10:05] our new companion that we found now this
[00:10:08] new companion is a little bit different
[00:10:10] you had to cut him out of your of the
[00:10:12] brother that was remember he was cut out
[00:10:14] of the brother and so now what we're at
[00:10:16] is we had that companion that popped out
[00:10:18] that was like a little ghoulish doctor
[00:10:20] creature we got some out Noms and Tech
[00:10:22] Nom and they were higher on their
[00:10:24] intelligence
[00:10:25] so now I'm going to put that in there GH
[00:10:31] maybe
[00:10:36] doctor and then because they have some
[00:10:38] intelligence a little extra on their
[00:10:40] intelligence so that's where we're at
[00:10:42] now for those of you that want to jump
[00:10:43] in we here's our giveaways we're going
[00:10:46] to run that here like we normally run
[00:10:49] having some fun with all of you and then
[00:10:52] what I'm going to do here next is we'll
[00:10:56] uh we'll get the adventure running
[00:11:00] Al righty so that's where we stand in
[00:11:02] our
[00:11:03] adventure we're currently trying to
[00:11:05] build our next character and you're
[00:11:07] going to come in sees mate if you wanted
[00:11:09] to and help us build that character here
[00:11:12] then we will go on our next encounter
[00:11:14] through the Wasteland and that's what's
[00:11:15] going to go on next here you guys will
[00:11:17] jump in and what you're going to do here
[00:11:19] is you're going to end up actually
[00:11:20] building your characters using these
[00:11:22] skills so you're going to look at these
[00:11:24] skills and you're GNA oh well look at
[00:11:25] that perfect I'm going to build a new
[00:11:27] character and I think I want to put
[00:11:29] strength and Agility but I think they
[00:11:30] need a I want to give them a little
[00:11:31] extra here so I'm going to buy a
[00:11:33] collector booster so I can give two
[00:11:35] extra when I'm building the character
[00:11:36] that's what how you do that on that
[00:11:38] that's how we do our little Adventure
[00:11:40] here if you all want to run these and
[00:11:42] have some fun with us or jump in and
[00:11:44] have some fun with us that is I'll keep
[00:11:47] running this for a few minutes here and
[00:11:49] then I will actually end up switching
[00:11:51] over and see if anybody would like to uh
[00:11:54] I don't try anything else we have all
[00:11:56] kinds of things going on here all kinds
[00:11:58] of different different things going on
[00:12:00] on a regular basis so yeah I don't know
[00:12:04] if you want to run in on this but what
[00:12:05] I'll do at the moment here since we
[00:12:07] don't have anybody uh hanging out and uh
[00:12:10] jumping in to play the adventure game
[00:12:12] I'm actually G to finish going through
[00:12:13] oh I did finish sing those up well look
[00:12:15] at that I sleeved everything
[00:12:17] up I got them all sleeved up well look
[00:12:20] at that ain't that awesome that means I
[00:12:24] can do this now start reading a little
[00:12:27] bit the directions and figuring about
[00:12:29] about it a little bit more I just got my
[00:12:30] sorcery stuff in from beta and now if
[00:12:33] you guys want we do have secret layer
[00:12:35] here check that stuff out and we can
[00:12:38] have some fun with uh fun with our
[00:12:41] adventure if you guys want to jump in
[00:12:43] whenever you'd like or um that would
[00:12:45] remember uh just because
[00:12:47] uh we'll have so I don't know what you
[00:12:49] really want to do here hard to know when
[00:12:54] uh
[00:12:56] nowadays because uh the things that you
[00:12:58] do like most you like we can't do just
[00:13:00] because too many people [ __ ] and moan
[00:13:02] about it and there's too many [ __ ] in
[00:13:03] this
[00:13:04] world that complain it's really what it
[00:13:07] boils down
[00:13:09] to so I can't do all of the things now I
[00:13:13] used to but we'll run this for a minute
[00:13:15] instead if you do want to jump in on
[00:13:17] this and see if you have some fun on the
[00:13:18] Wasteland Adventure now we're just doing
[00:13:21] our little Wasteland Adventure remember
[00:13:22] we currently as a team have one two
[00:13:25] three four five pogs is our Wasteland
[00:13:29] currency when you're traveling through
[00:13:30] so in case you bump into somebody you
[00:13:32] know maybe you bump into a uh a traveler
[00:13:34] here that you need to buy something from
[00:13:36] or maybe there's a uh a new uh a new
[00:13:39] Caravan a little city that you bump into
[00:13:41] at some point along the way I don't know
[00:13:44] that's up to you all what you're going
[00:13:45] to do in the adventure in the Wasteland
[00:13:47] here all right now I do have this pack
[00:13:50] here of sorcery because it came in the
[00:13:52] box so I'm going to open up my sorcery
[00:13:55] box my pack here see what I got I think
[00:13:58] that's what I'll do
[00:14:02] yeah my uh my wife told me I needed to
[00:14:04] go and do some of this stuff and sell
[00:14:06] things everywhere and just kind of be
[00:14:07] out everywhere all over the place try is
[00:14:10] starting out maybe um actually might be
[00:14:11] starting doing some Patron type thing
[00:14:13] where I do uh d and
[00:14:15] d uh or like game master type thing
[00:14:18] where I'm more just a game master not
[00:14:19] even selling anything just I'm a game
[00:14:21] master if people want to jump in and do
[00:14:23] that somebody you made a comment that
[00:14:25] might be something intriguing so I
[00:14:27] figured you know what maybe I'll try it
[00:14:28] out
[00:14:30] I don't know if that's something people
[00:14:31] would like you know have a you know have
[00:14:33] something that's curated and uh like a
[00:14:36] story that you guys are all
[00:14:38] into you know I got some new
[00:14:42] ready I got new scissors look at that
[00:14:45] how do you like my new
[00:14:47] scissors ready they
[00:14:50] are Miniature samurai
[00:14:55] swords I needed new scissors and I
[00:14:57] couldn't find dragon ones
[00:14:59] so I was trying to find something
[00:15:01] different like a design of some kind and
[00:15:03] I found these I was oh that's going to
[00:15:04] be fun that'll be fun for cutting things
[00:15:07] open so what I'm going to do here is I'm
[00:15:09] going to remove our skills because you
[00:15:11] kind of know what you're G to be doing
[00:15:12] and if you want to jump in on the
[00:15:14] adventure you guys can what I'll do here
[00:15:17] is I'm GNA actually minimize this also

[00:15:22] doing here as I'm cutting this stuff

[00:28:29] one going to be this since no one is uh
[00:28:34] no one wants to jump in on the game here
[00:28:35] remember everybody you can play the
[00:28:36] adventure game I don't know I have a
[00:28:37] feeling this is just going to be the way
[00:28:39] wat knau is from now on with you guys
[00:28:41] because you're gonna look just for free
[00:28:42] stuff and I don't get free stuff away
[00:28:44] unless we do some good things here so uh
[00:28:47] that's gonna what's going on here and I
[00:28:48] don't do and then because we don't do
[00:28:50] the other games we can do anymore
[00:28:52] because whatnot is being um finicky
[00:28:56] we'll just leave at that I have a
[00:28:58] feeling we're going to be on this like a
[00:28:59] regular basis but we'll see one of these
[00:29:02] days one of these days then son will
[00:29:05] pick up or not I'm not exactly
[00:29:07] sure we'll try it going
[00:29:14] whatever see if you guys are intrigued
[00:29:17] with any of the game I know generally
[00:29:19] don't all right so
[00:29:28] won't even find it not even finding it
[00:29:31] with that this is
[00:29:33] ridiculous oh my
[00:29:44] god well that is not what I put in there
[00:29:46] before was it
[00:30:09] okay all righty there that's the one I
[00:30:12] was looking
[00:30:13] for well we'll see if any of you want to
[00:30:16] come in and hang out with us do a little
[00:30:18] Adventure in our Wasteland here now I
[00:30:20] know that you guys some of you like the
[00:30:21] adventures some of you don't some of you
[00:30:23] I don't really know what you like
[00:30:24] anymore because you come and um I don't
[00:30:27] know I don't really know what you like
[00:30:28] anymore it's hard for me to know when no
[00:30:30] one comes in to talk to you you kind of
[00:30:31] just do your thing and I just uh you
[00:30:33] know that's all right do your thing have
[00:30:35] some fun I am not going to put any
[00:30:36] effort in anymore for those that do not
[00:30:38] put the effort in here or go and report
[00:30:41] so that's kind of why I'm doing it the
[00:30:42] way I am now you like it you like it you
[00:30:44] don't you don't piss on out if you
[00:30:47] don't most likely I'm gonna have less
[00:30:50] people liking what I'm doing on a
[00:30:51] regular basis though because because of
[00:30:53] that attitude now
[00:30:58] but you can only thank those of you that
[00:31:00] are on whatnot that decide to report
[00:31:02] people when they are doing nothing
[00:31:12] wrong do this
[00:31:15] here put that in there we'll keep adding
[00:31:18] this there so yeah you're stuck with the
[00:31:20] games that you got
[00:31:24] here hey Dwayne how's it good going
[00:31:32] buddy hopefully you're having a good
[00:31:36] day yeah you know can only do what he
[00:31:39] can do here you know it's not my can't
[00:31:41] help it when somebody um lies and they
[00:31:43] change rules to uh after I get in
[00:31:46] trouble to say that I stay in
[00:31:48] trouble can't really do anything about
[00:31:50] that
[00:31:51] one but hey that's also the reason why
[00:31:54] we don't have any the big blue book or
[00:31:56] the mystery things or anything like that
[00:31:57] anymore because I just can't trust
[00:31:59] people to be honest on here and um not
[00:32:04] um quite frankly trying to trust people
[00:32:07] to be honest on here it's really what it
[00:32:08] blows down
[00:32:10] to sad sad because there are a lot of
[00:32:13] fun good honest people on here I just
[00:32:16] can't there's enough of them that aren't
[00:32:17] that I can't trust it you
[00:32:22] know yeah yeah yeah I know I can't I
[00:32:25] can't do all those things here anymore I
[00:32:27] can't trust whatnot with those to have
[00:32:28] it uh be being somebody when they're
[00:32:31] doing stuff that are quite frankly I
[00:32:33] give stuff away more than I actually
[00:32:34] keep uh and whenever somebody gets a lot
[00:32:36] of uh lows I end up giving stuff away
[00:32:38] regularly so I mean on the top of that I
[00:32:40] end up getting screwed that way too so
[00:32:42] it's one of those like you
[00:32:44] know I don't want to do the
[00:32:46] uh too much on it that makes any sense
[00:33:06] I'll add that to the show there hey
[00:33:08] Martin how you doing this evening just
[00:33:11] uh going through I'm adding in my secret
[00:33:12] layer that I have right there for those
[00:33:14] of you that may be intrigued in secret
[00:33:17] lair now I don't know some of you were
[00:33:19] some of you
[00:33:21] weren't but that's what we got going on
[00:33:24] here and one of the nice things is we're
[00:33:26] going to do some of our wayand Adventure
[00:33:28] uh now this is the full show Wasteland
[00:33:30] Adventure that we got going on here now
[00:33:33] what I've been doing in the past was a
[00:33:35] little short one and we can still do
[00:33:36] that short one if you'd like where you
[00:33:38] can buy your packs and stuff like that
[00:33:39] I'm not saying we can't do any of those
[00:33:42] I was just saying that uh we I've been
[00:33:44] doing a little different one just due to
[00:33:47] uh how um how things are right here
[00:33:50] anymore you know so that's uh that's all
[00:33:53] that's all and I'm going to put this up
[00:33:54] to this I'm adding a bunch of secret
[00:33:58] lair stuff in here for you those of you
[00:34:00] that do like secret
[00:34:09] lair okay and then I'm GNA keep doing
[00:34:12] this see if somebody wants to jump in
[00:34:14] one of the adventure games I'm GNA run
[00:34:16] it here I'm G to keep running these ones
[00:34:18] randomly and if you want to jump in jump
[00:34:20] in on it you don't you know you can hang
[00:34:22] out with me but currently the stage we
[00:34:23] are at is we are building our
[00:34:26] third character in our ways and
[00:34:28] Adventure here happened to be a doctor a
[00:34:31] ghoulish doctor like creature that fell
[00:34:34] out of the cut that was cut out of the
[00:34:40] brother from
[00:34:44] uh our buddy Xavier so that's where
[00:34:47] we're at right now in our stage now I
[00:34:50] don't know if any of you want to jump in
[00:34:51] try it out but that's where at the point
[00:34:53] we're at oh no don't go away to

[00:35:01] bunch of secret layer listed now if you
[00:35:04] want it I'm going into them you can
[00:35:07] always jump in and do some secret layer
[00:35:09] yourselves
[00:35:10] also but I keep trying to have to add
[00:35:13] them in here because uh just things go a
[00:35:16] little differently here you

[01:13:28] uh the next time I'm
[01:13:29] on um I can just like uh get you a

[01:13:49] so I'm not going to be on tomorrow
[01:13:51] morning but I will be on Friday morning
[01:13:53] I believe
[01:13:56] but I'll hold on to these until then and
[01:13:59] I'll look through that list that you
[01:14:00] sent me to see if I have anything else
[01:14:02] because I do have some other stuff
[01:14:04] randomly but I don't know if I have all
[01:14:07] of it that makes sense I don't know
[01:14:09] where I don't know where all of it is
[01:14:10] because I've been a little
[01:14:12] uh little backed up on random stuff
[01:14:16] recently a little disorganized on some
[01:14:20] things but anyways I don't think I have
[01:14:24] any anywhere else I'm looking trying to
[01:14:27] think if I do and I can't seem to figure
[01:14:29] it out I don't think I do have any of
[01:14:31] them anywhere else actually think I'm
[01:14:33] pretty done on those I might but I will
[01:14:36] look again I'll keep looking if I need

[02:03:50] stuff I have a bunch of those
[02:03:52] I don't know if anybody wants
[02:03:53] that but I think that's it that I have
[02:03:57] there I think that's
[02:04:00] it for
[02:04:03] them I think that's it for the ones that
[02:04:05] are the dollar ones and everything else
[02:04:07] is going to be under a dollar
[02:04:11] here unless uh unless some of this has
[02:04:14] changed in price and I'm just not aware
[02:04:15] of them changing in price and I'll have
[02:04:17] to go through those at some other point
[02:04:18] maybe check that I think that is it for
[02:04:21] my uh
[02:04:23] for my ones there so I'm GNA have to put
[02:04:25] the world Walker Helm out because you
[02:04:27] guys a multiple of you did want the
[02:04:28] world Walker
[02:04:30] Helm so I will have to do
[02:04:42] that all right put that one
[02:04:48] out there you go and I'll set that one
[02:04:51] up there
[02:04:58] there that one up there like
[02:05:11] this why is that not
[02:05:15] saving there you

[02:06:05] dollar those are
[02:06:12] $3 $3

[02:06:24] $2 one so two one two three four
[02:06:40] five
[02:06:46] five +
[02:06:49] 7 is 12
[02:06:55] get Rog seven that's what I'm doing

[02:07:02] you and memory vessel is on here at
[02:07:09] uh I don't like that price that seems
[02:07:12] really
[02:07:14] high we're we're not going to put that
[02:07:16] on that
[02:07:17] much recall that I don't know why that
[02:07:20] says it's $6 for memory B wrestle we're

[02:07:25] uh
[02:07:29] five what was a git Rog here how did I
[02:07:31] say the get Rog

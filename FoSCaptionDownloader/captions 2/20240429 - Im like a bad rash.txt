[00:02:51] different one which is a full length
[00:02:53] Adventure game for the whole show so
[00:02:55] maybe you guys want to jump in on it
[00:02:56] I'll run it again maybe you guys had a
[00:02:58] little question on how it works works so
[00:03:00] if you do have any questions on how it
[00:03:02] works let me know it is starting at 6
[00:03:04] all you do is bid up to what you want
[00:03:07] for the pack and this is what we're
[00:03:08] going to do right now this will end up
[00:03:09] being probably what I'll end up giving
[00:03:10] out as a giveaway a little sign card
[00:03:12] market watch Phantom and he gave a a
[00:03:14] nasty end that's what he's giving you
[00:03:15] guys that's what will'll put out there
[00:03:18] up for you guys for uh to do a giveaway
[00:03:20] at some point I actually get to use my
[00:03:21] my dice I completely forgot about my
[00:03:23] dice I get to use these cool ones that I
[00:03:25] bought a while ago now I actually get to
[00:03:27] use them with this I was actually
[00:03:28] thinking you know what I might change
[00:03:30] the way some of the dice are done and
[00:03:31] change them in using the other ones
[00:03:32] instead that might help so we'll see if
[00:03:35] you want to jump in that is the thing
[00:03:37] there is just finishing that one minute
[00:03:38] you get to play buy up to what you want
[00:03:40] to finish building our character or to
[00:03:43] build our our next character in The
[00:03:45] Adventure now it is a roo likee Elvish
[00:03:49] green creature that has
[00:03:53] feminine looking body with a pretty
[00:03:57] smell to attract its creatures to harm
[00:03:59] them with vines that it can use so
[00:04:02] that's what we got going on here all
[00:04:04] right well guess if nobody wants to do
[00:04:08] any of that now I'm not going to be

[00:04:25] that with the other thing we can do that
[00:04:27] still if you guys would want but um
[00:04:30] that those one would be a little bit

[00:05:46] can trust I can but they can't trust
[00:05:48] that there's not going to be somebody to
[00:05:49] come in and lie and then uh suspend get
[00:05:51] me suspended over a lie so I no longer
[00:05:54] doing any of those

[00:06:10] adventure game here and you can jump in
[00:06:11] on the second version of the adventure
[00:06:13] team never trust a car exactly never

[00:06:38] Commons with foils and I do have some
[00:06:40] others that I think get a little bit
[00:06:44] here Orin sketchy yeah got to watch out
[00:06:46] for those orange ones know the orange
[00:06:49] ones they always bite me actually I had
[00:06:51] an orange cat when I was younger and I
[00:06:53] had I got found out I was allergic when
[00:06:55] I found I had that orange cat but um we
[00:06:57] had one cat and my whole family was okay
[00:06:59] with it but then we ended up getting a
[00:07:00] second cat and I was like oh cool I got
[00:07:02] my own cat it happened one that was an
[00:07:03] orange one and I ended up getting such

[00:12:51] body features and uh and a pretty smell
[00:12:55] that attracts their characters now are

[01:51:29] the end of this but we'll see all right
[01:51:31] you're now this you're here and right at
[01:51:33] the end of this opens up you see this
[01:51:36] cabage looking thing two of you are
[01:51:38] there and this cabbage looking
[01:51:42] thing starts to open up and it's really
[01:51:45] really big this time compared to the um
[01:51:48] compared to Zade here like a really big
[01:51:51] one has all everything as it opens up
[01:51:53] you hear it Go Screech out
[01:51:56] go as it screeches
[01:51:58] out it lashes out right away with a Vine
[01:52:04] whip now who are we gonna hit chat who
[01:52:07] are we going after with that vine
[01:52:13] whip who are we gonna hit with a Vine
[01:52:15] whip
[01:52:19] chat we have either
[01:52:23] Xavier or sir
[01:52:26] Jim No One's Gonna choose all right I'll
[01:52:28] choose then we're GNA whip at sir all
[01:52:32] right Jim j you whip at Jim I forgot to
[01:52:36] update his health his health is back to
[01:52:38] full
[01:52:39] health Jim's health is back to full
[01:52:41] health I forgot to update that Jim goes
[01:52:44] from 18 minus
[01:52:47] one minus
[01:52:50] one down to 17
[01:52:54] all right now what are you going to do
[01:52:58] sir Jim and
[01:53:03] Xavier and stay in here guys because I'm
[01:53:05] gonna be doing a Loot drop quickly at
[01:53:06] the end of
[01:53:12] this I didn't put this one out yet I
[01:53:15] don't think guys are in that yet did I
[01:53:17] so I put mystical enforcer down on the
[01:53:19] other
[01:53:21] one where is it
[01:53:23] martinator that was martinator mystical
[01:53:25] enforcer was this one shoot all right
[01:53:29] we're going to shoot both of them both
[01:53:30] of them going to shoot all
[01:53:36] right both of them are
[01:53:39] shooting all right they both
[01:53:43] shoot now they use are they going to
[01:53:45] both use um are they going to use the
[01:53:47] rifles I'm
[01:53:48] guessing so the rifle is shot by Sir Jim
[01:53:54] he lands a rifle shot on the body taking
[01:53:57] three away from the 15 of this
[01:54:02] boss minus
[01:54:05] three because it's a plus two with the
[01:54:07] rifle and the regular
[01:54:09] hit so it's now down to
[01:54:12] 12 we're going to try to shoot with a
[01:54:14] rusty rifle and it jams and you lose a
[01:54:20] bullet all right chat what are we going
[01:54:22] to do next we have La lash a bind lash
[01:54:24] and an
[01:54:33] immobilize what are you GNA do chat as
[01:54:36] as a
[01:54:39] boss
[01:54:41] one
[01:54:43] 2
[01:54:46] 3 how many
[01:54:48] arcs what this it attacks you're going
[01:54:51] to get one attack right now as a
[01:54:55] boss um and you're so uh but you can do
[01:54:59] a Vine whip which will hit both of them
[01:55:01] right now because you're paying
[01:55:02] attention or an
[01:55:05] immobilize so you're G to vine whip all
[01:55:07] right we're going to vine whip now is a
[01:55:10] 50/50 on that and you hit the vine
[01:55:13] whip you might subtract one Health from
[01:55:15] each of
[01:55:16] them Jim goes minus one down to 16
[01:55:22] and our Buddy goes from
[01:55:26] 8 10 minus one down to nine for
[01:55:33] Xavier what are we goingon to do shoot
[01:55:35] him
[01:55:36] again
[01:55:38] 12 you are able to shoot and you hit the
[01:55:41] boss this time you hit the boss you use
[01:55:45] an arm or you like to hit and then

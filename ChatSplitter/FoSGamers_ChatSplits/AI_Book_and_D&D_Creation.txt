Find me somewhere online an AI, or even an AI that's part of ChatGPT, like one of the models or something, that will write me a full book based off of the information provided, like page by page stuff. It won't be lazy, it won't give me one page and then it will brace it and do another, it will give me everything I want, or chapter by chapter, or even the entire book if I give it the idea, because I have one, and it will be generated. Or maybe it will do a Dungeons and Dragons book, Game Master's book for me. Like that's the stuff that I need done.

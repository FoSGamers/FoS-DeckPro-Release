[RAW]
I'm unable to see any elements from the screenshot, as it appears to be completely blank.

```json

  "ready": false,
  "missing": ["UI elements (e.g., menus, buttons, text)"],
  "suggestion": "Ensure the web app loads correctly with all UI elements visible and check for any loading issues or errors."
}
```

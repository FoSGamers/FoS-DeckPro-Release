[00:13:56] Nolan my oldest is at swim practice rce
[00:13:59] and we're doing our little Wasteland
[00:14:00] game this is what we're going to do here
[00:14:02] I'm going to give you an example you
[00:14:03] guys I'm going to show you all an
[00:14:05] example that are hanging out here of the
[00:14:08] game all right
[00:14:11] so I actually
[00:14:16] have and put up pack deal here for you
[00:14:20] guys and then we're going to go over an
[00:14:21] example of how this game is going to
[00:14:27] go let's do a pack deal of something
[00:14:30] like
[00:14:35] [Music]
[00:14:39] this all right we're going to do this
[00:14:40] for the pack deal here we're going to do
[00:14:43] a murderers an eternal Masters and a
[00:14:45] mystery booster and this is going to get
[00:14:47] you three points
[00:14:56] because the uh so here here is a the
[00:15:00] game here we're going to start the game
[00:15:02] off and we're going to do it like this
[00:15:03] I'm going to show you with this I'm run
[00:15:04] this one a little bit longer so I can
[00:15:06] explain it for some of you that are in
[00:15:13] here all right and these three packs are
[00:15:16] going to go on
[00:15:17] here if you want these three
[00:15:20] packs for this but this is how we're
[00:15:23] going to play the game so you guys know
[00:15:25] how to play it for those that happen to
[00:15:26] be hanging out I see there's a few of
[00:15:28] you so might be one extra than the
[00:15:29] people that are hanging out talking but
[00:15:31] will maybe uh mcduffin that's what you'd
[00:15:34] like to hear how this game works so
[00:15:36] we're GNA go over that here you buy
[00:15:44] no I hate when this does it I click on
[00:15:47] start and it
[00:15:50] doesn't might be a second there we go
[00:15:54] you buy these three packs that happening
[00:15:56] on here you can tell me whichever three
[00:15:58] you want
[00:15:59] but what happens is if you get a
[00:16:01] collector boosters or special ones you
[00:16:03] end up getting one point per pack so
[00:16:05] your character starts off with one two
[00:16:08] three normally this is half but we're
[00:16:09] going to put it to three just to give it
[00:16:11] for this game here start you at three
[00:16:13] points for your character you're going
[00:16:14] to pick yourself a
[00:16:15] technician a detective a mutant or a
[00:16:20] strong human and depending on who you
[00:16:22] pick it's depending on what you're going
[00:16:23] to go with for your powerups when it
[00:16:26] comes to plus one or minus one and the
[00:16:28] 50/50 or the other one there so what I'm
[00:16:32] going to do is I'm going to show you
[00:16:33] what would happen here is you would come
[00:16:35] in I'm going to say I'm a mutant mutants
[00:16:37] here in our Wasteland Adventure game
[00:16:40] what they look for is they look for food
[00:16:43] all right they look for food because
[00:16:45] they don't really care about treasure so
[00:16:46] we're gonna pick pick something out here
[00:16:47] we're gonna go all right what do we get
[00:16:48] here we got a food all right so your
[00:16:50] Wasteland character just went from plus
[00:16:52] three 2 plus4 your Wasteland mutant is
[00:16:55] now a four powered
[00:16:57] mutant we're going to go on next we're
[00:17:00] going to see do you find a friend or
[00:17:01] maybe an item that's going to help you
[00:17:02] along the way let's see here Viking what
[00:17:05] do you think you find a knight oh
[00:17:09] Knights are not a friend of a mutant
[00:17:12] they are an enemy they have to fight and
[00:17:14] because of that kind of get rid of your
[00:17:16] plus one there from your PowerUp so
[00:17:17] you're still at plus three though
[00:17:19] because you have three premium packs or
[00:17:21] a collector boosters now you get on to
[00:17:23] your last one
[00:17:25] here here it is at your last one
[00:17:29] this is where you have a companion maybe
[00:17:32] you can find a companion out of these 12
[00:17:34] is this companion going to be yours
[00:17:36] you're looking for a fungus dinosaur did
[00:17:38] you say food yeah yeah food all right
[00:17:42] got a fungus companion we're gonna find
[00:17:43] we're gonna see if you can find it we're
[00:17:45] g to go here we're GNA flip that around
[00:17:47] and oh look at that we got a dwarf that
[00:17:49] is not a companion that you want as a
[00:17:51] friend you were looking for something
[00:17:54] like that fungus there but you got a
[00:17:56] dwarf we're going to give this actually
[00:17:58] you know we're going to say we're pulled
[00:17:59] out a fungus here just for the example
[00:18:01] of the game so you are at a plus4 right
[00:18:03] now with that game look at that
[00:18:06] wonderful we're using that as an example
[00:18:09] here you now are at a plus four and
[00:18:11] you're going up against one of these
[00:18:13] characters these are the 10 bosses
[00:18:15] you're going to pick one of the bosses
[00:18:16] here you're gonna go here oh no let's
[00:18:19] see which one it is what are we gonna
[00:18:21] have to battle against oh the watch in
[00:18:23] the water that is a nine you do not have
[00:18:27] nine so you can not stand up against him
[00:18:29] you're going to lose but maybe you got
[00:18:30] lucky at one point and you did pull out
[00:18:34] the velocir Raptor well that would get
[00:18:35] you a free collector booster if you
[00:18:37] played along with this game here now
[00:18:39] what that was was just a little example
[00:18:41] for those that were uh hanging out in
[00:18:43] here and that has not have not known or

[00:20:51] there will no one
[00:20:54] okay I have to have that for my trip
[00:20:56] down to Miami so I can help relieve my
[00:21:00] stress there we go going to start that
[00:21:03] the adventure and remember everybody
[00:21:06] there is that red button with the
[00:21:07] animations that we got and um since you
[00:21:08] guys do like the adventure I was
[00:21:11] actually well I was in Miami I'm going
[00:21:13] to bring my computer and I think I'll uh
[00:21:14] get some animations going
[00:21:19] there you hit you definitely hit it hard
[00:21:22] the last week gnomes you got some packs
[00:21:24] the last uh most of the time but that
[00:21:26] last one I'm sorry I don't know what
[00:21:27] happened there but I I gave you that
[00:21:28] extra pack though CU I felt bad on that
[00:21:31] but you definitely got uh yeah you
[00:21:33] definitely came out with a lot of those
[00:21:34] will noan can you go get the uh electric
[00:21:36] the gun thing for my back so I can use
[00:21:39] it yes you did gnomes but you got some
[00:21:42] you had some we had some fun with it
[00:21:44] what it should be on next to my bed
[00:21:47] there it is fun though you help clear
[00:21:50] out some stuff for those that are here
[00:21:52] so now it's cleared out a little bit um
[00:21:55] so there's better odds
[00:22:01] all right yeah no problem hey I'll be
[00:22:03] like it's gonna I'm I think I I thinkig
[00:22:05] the whole point of me making that box
[00:22:07] was because I figured it was something
[00:22:08] that people are going to add on to like
[00:22:10] making a purchase of something not like
[00:22:12] buying a bunch of them no no I don't
[00:22:14] mind that you're buying a bunch of them
[00:22:15] but I thought was like GNA be like hey
[00:22:17] I'm gonna add 10 on to my purchase to
[00:22:19] see if I get luck and um so that's why I
[00:22:23] built it kind of the way I did so like
[00:22:24] when you're starting to do when you did
[00:22:25] it your way that's why I was like you
[00:22:26] know what I feel bad if you don't
[00:22:28] something that's why I was like giving
[00:22:29] the extra pack in there because if you
[00:22:30] don't hit anything because I wasn't
[00:22:32] expecting it ever to kind of be that I
[00:22:33] was expecting it to be like a an
[00:22:35] addition on to try to get the big win of
[00:22:38] The Lord of the Rings I'll turn that on
[00:22:41] don't worry about it bu no please don't

[00:33:50] somebody out of there that uh wasn't

[00:33:55] right we'll do um some more Wasteland
[00:34:00] Adventure
[00:34:01] game you know what let's start you
[00:34:04] off let's do a crazy and you're starting
[00:34:06] you off with four points
[00:34:10] here we're going to start you off with
[00:34:12] four points
[00:34:14] here if somebody wants to go
[00:34:19] big start off with four
[00:34:22] points and
[00:34:24] go with this
[00:34:29] and
[00:34:39] this so the Wasteland
[00:34:43] game uh uh what are you asking project
[00:34:46] Nemesis where I'm going I'm going to
[00:34:47] somewhere in in man uh in Miami it's
[00:34:50] going to be by the um Bo show is where
[00:34:52] we're staying but yeah the Wasteland
[00:34:54] game I'll explain the Wasteland game
[00:34:56] here give me a second and I will um I'm
[00:34:58] going to get this up here and I'll
[00:35:00] explain that for
[00:35:06] you all right and this is going to be a
[00:35:09] little bit of a big hitter one here but
[00:35:12] that's all right if somebody wants to
[00:35:13] try it they
[00:35:15] can all right so the Wasteland
[00:35:20] game okay yeah the Wasteland game goes
[00:35:24] like this you have
[00:35:27] your character this character for
[00:35:29] because you pick a character it's either
[00:35:31] a technician mutant a human strong human
[00:35:35] like a defender or a um detective and
[00:35:40] out of those four characters you end up
[00:35:43] having different pluses and minuses
[00:35:45] depending on what you pull out of the
[00:35:47] boxes so if you um for some of them it's
[00:35:49] plus and minus for food this is food
[00:35:52] which is plus or minus depending on the
[00:35:53] character this is either like a helpful
[00:35:55] character a friend or or like an item
[00:35:57] that may help you that could be a plus
[00:35:59] or minus and then this one is a and
[00:36:01] these are 50% chances to get plus or
[00:36:03] minus and this one is a companion that
[00:36:05] might come along to help you that will
[00:36:07] add another point on so you could
[00:36:09] potentially get plus three points or
[00:36:11] minus three points however it goes and
[00:36:14] then what you do is you fight against
[00:36:15] the boss you pick one of the 10 cards
[00:36:17] here and whatever you happen to go up
[00:36:19] against say you uh you pick this one
[00:36:22] here all right you go all right this is
[00:36:24] what I went up against and oh no Sauron
[00:36:27] there's no way you're going to beat six
[00:36:29] but hey you tried and you still got your
[00:36:31] three packs you just don't happen to get
[00:36:33] an extra free pack which is what the
[00:36:35] wheel spin is at the end there depending
[00:36:37] on if you are three if you are four
[00:36:39] points of your character and above and
[00:36:41] you beat a boss you get a free collector
[00:36:43] booster pack if you are three points and
[00:36:45] above that you beat one of the bosses
[00:36:47] you get a free set booster pack and
[00:36:49] that's uh that's the game but I'm
[00:36:52] goingon to put this back because no one
[00:36:54] generally wants to go with the
[00:36:55] four-point option to start the game but
[00:36:59] I throw it out there every now and
[00:37:04] again but that's a
[00:37:14] game yep points you collect equals power
[00:37:16] against the boss that is correct the
[00:37:18] points you collect equals power against
[00:37:20] the boss you are correct on that and you
[00:37:24] can start off with like one point say
[00:37:27] you uh one point all the way up to
[00:37:29] potentially I guess four points but um
[00:37:32] if you buy one of those but it's
[00:37:34] generally three points or higher uh you
[00:37:36] can start out with up to three points
[00:37:38] where if you get three collector
[00:37:39] boosters because each collector booster
[00:37:40] is a point and each other thing that's
[00:37:42] not a collector booster or a Premium
[00:37:44] Pack is a half a
[00:37:49] point no problem I'll be on in the
[00:37:51] morning for um a little while until
[00:37:54] before we head down to Miami because we
[00:37:56] got to Dro the the kids off and
[00:37:57] everything so like the normal routine in
[00:37:58] the morning will be going on because we

[00:38:46] distance of the boat
[00:38:51] show here this is what I'll do I'll play
[00:38:53] this game out here for you guy right now
[00:38:55] so you guys can can get a little example
[00:38:57] of what it would be like and I'm going
[00:38:59] to put these on here for a pack deal so
[00:39:01] if somebody wanted to jump in while I
[00:39:03] explain the game you guys can all right
[00:39:06] I'm gonna do this for two
[00:39:08] minutes and then I'm GNA go over the
[00:39:11] game showing it kind of played
[00:39:13] out all right so we're going to put
[00:39:15] these on here for 21 for these three if
[00:39:18] you want
[00:39:21] them the frost Museum all right we'll
[00:39:24] have to check that out we'll have to
[00:39:26] check it out then so they let's say this
[00:39:29] is your character what you chose you get
[00:39:30] two points for this character because
[00:39:32] this is half a point each plus we're
[00:39:34] gonna say this is one point just for the
[00:39:36] sake of this game normally this would be
[00:39:37] a onepoint thing but we're gonna say you
[00:39:39] get two points right now all right now
[00:39:42] your character starts out at two points
[00:39:43] you're G to pick a technician a strong
[00:39:46] human which uh a strong human Defender a
[00:39:49] detective or a mutant now each one of
[00:39:52] them have pluses and minuses and if you
[00:39:54] look at the show notes it explains what
[00:39:55] the pluses and minuses are so what I'm
[00:39:57] going to pick a mutant right now all
[00:39:59] right as a mutant I'm looking for food
[00:40:01] not treasure because mutant doesn't care
[00:40:03] about food treasure all they care about
[00:40:05] is food to get stronger all right so
[00:40:08] we're gonna play this we're gonna do
[00:40:09] this we're gonna go here we go we're
[00:40:11] gonna pull one out we go all right what
[00:40:12] happens as the mutant did he get a food
[00:40:14] all right there you go your mutant has
[00:40:16] gone from plus two to plus three for the
[00:40:19] strength let's see what happens here can
[00:40:21] your mutant find a friend or an artifact
[00:40:23] that will help them along the way I
[00:40:26] don't know we'll see here let's go look
[00:40:28] looks for a friend or an artifact that's
[00:40:30] going to help them along the way maybe
[00:40:31] an item let's see let's turn this around
[00:40:34] and oh we got a map mutants don't like
[00:40:37] Maps they can't even read I don't need
[00:40:40] that goodbye
[00:40:42] map
[00:40:44] ah goodbye
[00:40:47] map but you know what we still might be
[00:40:50] able to get a
[00:40:51] companion that map knocked you down
[00:40:53] though to two because it he he takes
[00:40:57] away one point so that has a minus one
[00:40:58] so that knocked you down to two you were
[00:41:00] at three but you're now down to two
[00:41:02] let's see what happens maybe you're
[00:41:03] going to get lucky and find yourself a
[00:41:05] companion all right maybe you'll find
[00:41:07] yourself a companion here nice friend a
[00:41:11] fungus dinosaur to help your mutant
[00:41:13] along the
[00:41:15] way yeah there you go oh no you did not
[00:41:18] you got a detective took your fungus
[00:41:20] dinosaur
[00:41:21] companion it's going to be hard for you
[00:41:23] to beat there's not really anyone in
[00:41:25] here for you to beat but we'll see what
[00:41:26] you got up against for the boss pull
[00:41:29] that away here we go oh water in the
[00:41:31] watch in the water oh that was a hard
[00:41:33] one hit you down with a nine there we go
[00:41:37] coming back with that and that's how
[00:41:38] that goes there and maybe you got lucky
[00:41:40] though maybe this was you picked out a a
[00:41:43] detective in this game with a three
[00:41:45] points and you pulled out a Merryweather
[00:41:47] what would have happened there was you
[00:41:49] would have ended up winning because your
[00:41:50] power would have been over two here to
[00:41:53] beat Mary weather light and uh you would
[00:41:57] end up getting yourself a free set
[00:41:59] booster now if you were uh strong enough

[00:57:06] Against Humanity that common that's
[00:57:08] become a big Chase card because uh you

[00:57:14] that's trying to collect like 50 of them
[00:57:16] or something like that I can't remember
[00:57:17] I think they wanted 30 of them I don't

[01:00:01] project yeah there's um sometimes it's
[01:00:03] hard for me to tell because like
[01:00:05] sometimes the screen will say like
[01:00:06] there's four people then it'll say like
[01:00:07] there's two but I don't know because it
[01:00:09] doesn't always show who's in and out
[01:00:11] because it just like so if you've been
[01:00:12] in here before it doesn't show that
[01:00:14] somebody's been in or not so sometimes
[01:00:16] I'm just like kind of guessing if
[01:00:18] there's anyone here because it does
[01:00:20] sometimes take time to catch
[01:00:23] up let's do this

[01:01:27] people come and hang out project quite
[01:01:28] frankly it helps make the chat and
[01:01:30] everything go by a little bit better

[01:01:32] does came out I'm not just like silent
[01:01:34] here you know I don't mind people that

[01:01:43] to you know you have questions about
[01:01:45] something I can help answer
[01:01:46] them chat about whatever is going on I
[01:01:49] mean I'm not necessarily here to
[01:01:50] specifically all the time I'm not like
[01:01:52] um some of the big high pressure people
[01:01:53] that are here like hey bye bye bye bye
[01:01:55] bye bye I kind of just jump on and do my
[01:01:58] thing cuz I I started doing this because
[01:02:00] my oldest son wanted to open up videos
[01:02:03] do opening videos for YouTube and I'm
[01:02:05] like I cannot afford to do that and um
[01:02:09] he ended up finding like whatnot because
[01:02:11] I guess somebody had a video about um
[01:02:13] whatnot on YouTube and he was like hey
[01:02:15] can we uh can we do some of this and try
[01:02:17] opening packs I'm like sure why not and
[01:02:20] that's really how we came about doing
[01:02:21] this so pretty much we we open these so
[01:02:24] that we open some packs together and
[01:02:26] then we do YouTube videos with whatever
[01:02:28] little we make from this we don't even
[01:02:29] make a lot from doing this just because
[01:02:31] I don't do a wick a big upch charge like
[01:02:32] some channels you'll go and you'll get
[01:02:34] like say like I had I don't know where
[01:02:38] they are now but I used to have um oh my
[01:02:41] commander M Masters are like $52 but um
[01:02:45] some of the other places are like $60
[01:02:46] $70 and it's just because I'm giving you
[01:02:48] as best deal I can because it's trying
[01:02:50] to I'm just more or less trying to allow
[01:02:53] my family to do the the fun things they
[01:02:58] want yeah it's pretty much what it is we
[01:03:01] sell stuff so they can open it and if it
[01:03:02] becomes successful enough we've been
[01:03:04] doing pretty good maybe in the future
[01:03:06] I'll look into opening maybe a small
[01:03:08] store that way I can get better deals
[01:03:10] for myself and you guys and then have
[01:03:12] like you know a little small store if
[01:03:14] people ever want to show up and hang out
[01:03:16] I don't
[01:03:19] know we're going to do this
[01:03:21] here with a couple of play boosters
[01:03:26] and we're going to call
[01:03:34] this these three
[01:03:38] here here we
[01:03:43] go yeah it is that is a rabbit hole see
[01:03:47] I I ran a I used to manage three Sprint
[01:03:50] stores when Sprint was around years ago
[01:03:53] uh then I got out of it and did like it
[01:03:55] stuff so there would be only like a
[01:03:56] hobby thing on the side that I could
[01:03:58] start and have like kind of running on
[01:03:59] the side with the family cuz I work from
[01:04:01] home anyways it would be like a like I
[01:04:04] said just a little hobby thing to start
[01:04:05] on the
[01:04:23] side
[01:04:26] all right I'm going to put those back
[01:04:28] that was a pretty good deal but no one
[01:04:29] wanted to go we don't have too many
[01:04:31] people hanging out all the time like I
[01:04:33] said we got people pumping it out so I
[01:04:34] try to throw really as best deal as I
[01:04:36] can
[01:04:37] on what I think uh about half hour maybe
[01:04:41] longer and then I'm going to be hanging
[01:04:43] out to see what's going
[01:04:47] on and go put this on for a pack deal

[01:08:17] not the same as his I had um some
[01:08:21] different plans but he um he passed away
[01:08:26] before I was able to do any of that but
[01:08:28] uh so but and he ended up we ended up
[01:08:30] having to sell everything off so um but
[01:08:33] well at one point that's why I figure I

[01:09:15] had very few family members so weirdly
[01:09:17] it was like sucked but I being a
[01:09:20] fisherman and having him gone for like
[01:09:22] two to three months at a time when it
[01:09:24] first occurred I was able to be like

[01:12:58] want to that's been hanging out in
[01:13:04] here let's put this back here let's put
[01:13:08] that back
[01:13:11] here and Let's
[01:13:16] do let's
[01:13:19] do pack deal
[01:13:22] of
[01:13:28] this plus
[01:13:30] these let's do this for a pack deal do a
[01:13:34] little murder
[01:13:37] mystery yeah little murder
[01:13:47] mystery let see if you like this
[01:13:52] here
[01:13:55] [Music]
[01:13:57] all right there you go pack deal those
[01:13:59] three
[01:14:01] packs right there for
[01:14:06] 18 and you also get to play the
[01:14:08] adventure game along with it now you
[01:14:11] don't need to you can say I don't I
[01:14:13] don't want to I just want three
[01:14:15] packs but get yourself a free chance at
[01:14:18] a pack of cards chance at a free pack of
[01:14:21] cards let me reord that
[01:14:24] if you play the game so most people
[01:14:30] do all righty here we
[01:14:36] go they are coming up in auction they
[01:14:38] did not they were um I will put them up
[01:14:48] again oh that's fine we can uh switch
[01:14:51] them out too if you want want to play
[01:14:54] like if you would like to play the
[01:14:55] adventure game we can switch them out I
[01:14:57] have all kinds of stuff so say for
[01:15:00] instance you want to play the adventure
[01:15:02] game the Wasteland Adventure game and
[01:15:04] instead you're a fan of Exelon all right
[01:15:08] we have uh we can do like an couple of
[01:15:14] Exelon like an Exon like
[01:15:18] this and start you off if you would like
[01:15:22] want to do something like
[01:15:24] that yeah just name three packs that
[01:15:27] you'd like and we can put them up there
[01:15:28] and can pretty much if you look at the
[01:15:30] game the way that the game goes is set
[01:15:32] boosters draft boosters and packs that
[01:15:36] are like those are half a point for your
[01:15:38] character all right and then if your
[01:15:41] character is a you buy collector
[01:15:43] boosters any collector booster that you
[01:15:45] get up to three points of the collector
[01:15:47] boosters will be um will be a point so
[01:15:51] you get one point per collector booster
[01:15:52] up to three so for instance here say you
[01:15:55] did this and you bought a collector
[01:15:56] booster of lost Caverns a set and a
[01:15:59] draft of lost Caverns that's going to
[01:16:01] end up being two points for your
[01:16:03] character and it's going to be a
[01:16:04] technician a mutant a strong human or a
[01:16:08] detective and that is all in the show
[01:16:10] notes if you want to look at it to check
[01:16:12] them out all right they are always in
[01:16:15] there to help uh help with the
[01:16:16] explanation and we're going to put these
[01:16:18] on here these three
[01:16:20] packs are going to go on
[01:16:23] at this
[01:16:24] amount
[01:16:26] okay and that Wasteland
[01:16:28] Adventure would potentially allow you to
[01:16:31] get yourself a free pack on top of it if
[01:16:34] you can get
[01:16:36] through to get yourself enough points
[01:16:40] enough uh strength to beat one of the
[01:16:44] bosses here now you have three chances
[01:16:48] to get plus one but you could also get a
[01:16:50] minus one all right so you get a 5050 50
[01:16:53] chance here for plus one minus one 50/50
[01:16:55] chance here you all have a 2575 for a
[01:16:59] companion we call that and then here you
[01:17:02] have your bosses you fight you would
[01:17:04] pick one of these out they're obviously
[01:17:06] not g to be facing this way to you pick
[01:17:08] but say you picked out Owen Grady and
[01:17:10] you had three points you would win
[01:17:12] because it is stronger than Owen but say
[01:17:15] you picked out um someone knew only had
[01:17:18] you got four points well you know what
[01:17:20] the incinerator the guilty came out and
[01:17:21] beat you and that's how that game would
[01:17:24] go that's how we do that there playing
[01:17:26] our adventure our adventure game name
[01:17:30] whatever packs you want you can buy them
[01:17:31] yourself I'm just putting three random
[01:17:33] ones up at a time kind of just randomly
[01:17:36] putting them
[01:17:44] together but Juan that's all right we
[01:17:46] don't understand not everybody's a giant
[01:17:47] fan of every um every release so we can
[01:17:50] always adjust what is there

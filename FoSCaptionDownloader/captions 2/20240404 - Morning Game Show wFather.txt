[00:00:00] I actually have a lot of do got some new
[00:00:03] stuff set up
[00:00:06] today so uh we'll see at the microphone
[00:00:10] forgot to move microphone again there we
[00:00:12] go go let's do
[00:00:15] thatone there there we
[00:00:17] go there we go how's everybody doing
[00:00:21] this wonderful morning here oh we forgot
[00:00:24] to have the kids St fall packs it looks
[00:00:26] like dad's gonna have to do some just
[00:00:27] grab some random things out if we need
[00:00:29] them sometimes they ask if they can do
[00:00:31] it in the morning but we had a little
[00:00:32] bit of a hiccup because uh a little
[00:00:34] frustrated this morning so I might be a
[00:00:35] little flustered I'm sorry U my son
[00:00:37] didn't want to go to school because uh
[00:00:40] he said he doesn't like one of his
[00:00:41] classes because he putting a lot of
[00:00:43] effort in had a really good grade then
[00:00:45] uh all a sudden right before the quarter
[00:00:47] ended the teachers decided to give um
[00:00:49] him like two grades the day after the
[00:00:53] quarter ended which had him at the
[00:00:55] quarter had him at a 91 then two days
[00:00:58] after the quarter ended she puts in GR
[00:01:00] three grades that bring him down to a de
[00:01:01] so he's been very upset little child for
[00:01:03] the last few days and um so we're trying
[00:01:06] to get a hold of the school and figure
[00:01:07] out what going on there because that's a
[00:01:09] little ridiculous to have that after
[00:01:10] break to have that happen at least we
[00:01:12] thought it was so anyways that's uh
[00:01:15] sorry a little flustered this morning
[00:01:17] that might be the reason why a little
[00:01:19] little uh not on H at the
[00:01:24] moment but let's get things rolling
[00:01:26] let's see if we can get make things feel
[00:01:28] a little bit better here I know I talked
[00:01:30] to him about some of the roughness I had
[00:01:31] in school so I figured maybe uh maybe
[00:01:34] I'll help him now I grew up myself I
[00:01:37] wasn't the greatest when it came to
[00:01:38] English
[00:01:43] so that needs to go over there oh got to
[00:01:46] get my light running who my light I'm
[00:01:49] got have a second one
[00:01:51] soon that's going to be
[00:01:54] fun to figure out where to put it i'
[00:01:56] probably have to go on the other side
[00:01:57] where my
[00:01:58] uh where my thing is tokens my wife

[00:36:15] buddy hopefully my internet and
[00:36:17] everything is working better now and
[00:36:19] it's clear with all my camera and stuff
[00:36:21] and less glitchy crossed my fingers on
[00:36:24] that I upgraded my internet router and I
[00:36:27] got where I have the uh our it's one of
[00:36:29] the new 6E ones so uh I didn't go with
[00:36:32] the seven because I didn't want to spend
[00:36:33] $600 for a router and I found this was a
[00:36:36] 6E one which was a commercial grade one
[00:36:38] but it was a refurbished one now this
[00:36:40] was the deal it's a Nighthawk uh
[00:36:43] refurbish now with it being one of those
[00:36:45] I was able to um get it for
[00:36:48] $189 instead of
[00:36:51] $37 and then I can spend $40 for two
[00:36:56] years and I get in a free replacement if
[00:36:59] anything goes wrong and I get tech
[00:37:01] support so I was like that seems like a
[00:37:03] stupid reason not to do that so I did I
[00:37:07] did it and I bought that with the
[00:37:09] service plan and I saved like 200
[00:37:13] bucks and I got a router that holds
[00:37:16] supposedly 55 connections plus and will
[00:37:19] do up to like seven gig download or
[00:37:21] something like that that
[00:37:25] insane I know you guys got don't all

[00:53:25] Wasteland fall uh our packs here one of
[00:53:27] our VA Vault packs so you can decide
[00:53:29] which one of those five you want up
[00:53:31] there and what we're going to do now now
[00:53:33] is we're going to see how much we can
[00:53:36] get with our two slams here if we get
[00:53:40] enough to have seven as a Max to beat
[00:53:42] our boss now I got to stand up to do
[00:53:43] this I guess so I'm not good when I'm
[00:53:45] sitting so let see what happens last
[00:53:47] time I did right away and got seven one
[00:53:49] here we
[00:53:50] go oh we got we got two we're starting
[00:53:54] out with two three
[00:53:57] no two we only got two right now to
[00:53:59] start for our strength maybe we are
[00:54:02] going to get lucky we can get some more
[00:54:04] after we have one more slam because you
[00:54:05] had two packs there we go two strength
[00:54:08] right
[00:54:11] there let's go good luck let's see if we
[00:54:14] can get the we need what five more
[00:54:16] here oh we only got one more no we have
[00:54:21] three strength but you know what three
[00:54:24] strength can beat two of the 10 bosses
[00:54:28] with that said which card you want to go
[00:54:31] with to try to beat your 10 bosses and
[00:54:35] you're going to get a Pog we're g to
[00:54:36] give you a random POG saying thank you
[00:54:38] for playing our pogman battle game which
[00:54:40] one you want to go again pogman battle
[00:54:43] is what we just did
[00:54:46] there Jeff that's what we just did the
[00:54:48] pogman battle you no uh all right so
[00:54:51] you're a human and you're going to go up
[00:54:52] against what for the boss you have a
[00:54:54] chance here Tuvok to against the boss my
[00:54:57] friend because this just a quick way to
[00:54:58] get against the boss you choose a human
[00:55:00] go up against the boss what's gonna
[00:55:02] happen you have three
[00:55:04] strength going to choose one of the 10
[00:55:10] bosses which one are we doing with
[00:55:12] fourth from the front one fourth from
[00:55:14] the left one two o I threw a card three
[00:55:19] and four fourth from the
[00:55:22] left your boss that you're going up
[00:55:24] against in this Wasteland is is oh the
[00:55:28] incinerator comes flying on through
[00:55:32] burning down everything in the Wasteland
[00:55:34] and you know what though I think even
[00:55:37] though he burned everything down on the
[00:55:39] Wasteland I feel like you're going to
[00:55:42] still have uh something there and you
[00:55:45] get one of our packs here you get one of
[00:55:47] our vault packs you always get a vault
[00:55:48] pack but I think we're going to have a
[00:55:50] Loot
[00:55:51] drop I feel like we should do a Loot
[00:55:54] drop I think we're going to do a Loot
[00:55:56] drop anyways cuz that incinerator Burns
[00:55:58] some buildings down and in the process
[00:56:00] of burning some building down out poed
[00:56:03] some
[00:56:04] loot in the Wasteland all right out pop
[00:56:08] some loot in the Wasteland and that loot
[00:56:11] comes out for everyone and when that
[00:56:12] loot shows up it ends up being a uh a $1
[00:56:17] pack that gets dropped in the Wasteland

[01:44:34] size uh it's a decent size I mean I've
[01:44:37] I've had um different offices before
[01:44:41] that were smaller I actually used to use
[01:44:43] my basement as an office before I
[01:44:44] freaking love that because I had my
[01:44:46] whole like basement it was like finished
[01:44:48] in a way kind of finished but we never
[01:44:50] we never did anything in there except
[01:44:51] when the kids came in after school so I
[01:44:53] worked all day long in the basement for
[01:44:55] like by myself in a little cobby it was
[01:44:58] awesome these are going to go up here
[01:45:01] this is going to
[01:45:02] go why not let's do this this is a good
[01:45:05] deal I'm going to start it I'm going to
[01:45:07] do 30 seconds here we go those are going
[01:45:10] to go up right there our pogman battle
[01:45:12] and this is what I'm going to do give me
[01:45:13] one second
[01:45:16] here oh I shut the camera off in the
[01:45:19] process good job James I pressed the
[01:45:21] power off button on my phone
[01:45:25] so my camera went away there we go let's
[01:45:27] bring that back there let's try that
[01:45:28] again don't press that button here you
[01:45:31] go so that's my office here I have um
[01:45:34] this is like we have like our weight
[01:45:35] room in here so we do our exercising and
[01:45:38] stuff that's my work
[01:45:42] computer that's all the stuff that I
[01:45:44] sell for you guys over there that's kind
[01:45:47] of like the setup this is where people
[01:45:49] sleep though this is actually a Murphy
[01:45:51] bed so that's why it's like a a second
[01:45:53] bedroom kind of our fourth bedroom for
[01:45:55] us so it's a fourth bedroom for us we
[01:45:58] use it as a fourth bedroom when people
[01:45:59] come to visit so with the Murphy bed
[01:46:02] there yeah it's uh I don't know
[01:46:05] um we can exercise in here very easily
[01:46:09] so I'd say I don't know what it is like
[01:46:11] probably 13 by 133 or something like
[01:46:13] that 12 by
[01:46:16] 12 not bad not big um probably the
[01:46:20] biggest office I've been in that was
[01:46:21] just strictly an office
[01:46:23] but it does suck in the in this in the
[01:46:25] summer though because that window that I
[01:46:26] showed you there that has is closed the
[01:46:28] reason why that's closed is because Sun
[01:46:30] comes beating in that freaking thing oh
[01:46:32] my God it makes this room a million
[01:46:34] degrees turns it into a goddamn oven I
[01:46:38] hate it that's the only bad thing about

[01:47:10] fun yeah Dwayne I don't know where where
[01:47:12] do what do you do for work yourself I I
[01:47:14] know you said you work from home and
[01:47:15] stuff but uh mind if I mind if I ask
[01:47:18] what you do I do development type stuff
[01:47:22] for a uh for an insurance
[01:47:28] company my work day starts at nine
[01:47:30] that's why I always am off here at that
[01:47:32] time there you
[01:47:34] go Marin how you doing split banana
[01:47:37] thanks for coming in holling thanks
[01:47:38] coming in hanging out we have a little
[01:47:40] bit of a giveaway up there trying out
[01:47:42] some stuff my friend my my children had
[01:47:45] U family have signed some cards along
[01:47:46] with a little pack of other extras for
[01:47:48] you saying thank you and the reason why
[01:47:50] we did that is because people kept
[01:47:51] asking for them so I figured might as
[01:47:52] well well
[01:47:56] right okay all right
[01:48:01] cool I used to work with the um uh when
[01:48:04] I was uh I used to teach actually before
[01:48:06] I got into what I am now and when I
[01:48:09] taught I um for the first two three
[01:48:12] years I did long-term like substituting
[01:48:14] because I was having a hard time finding
[01:48:16] a teaching job in my area then I find
[01:48:18] the fourth year I found a teaching job
[01:48:20] then my fifth year I stopped teaching
[01:48:21] and I started doing other stuff
[01:48:23] and but anyways long story short um I
[01:48:26] used to work with the autistic children
[01:48:28] all the time at um one of the schools I
[01:48:29] loved working with them they um I grew
[01:48:31] up I'll put it this way my mom um my mom
[01:48:34] drove the FED bus our entire life my
[01:48:37] entire life from up until probably sixth
[01:48:40] or seventh grade I remember being on the
[01:48:42] sped bus every day and I'm probably and
[01:48:44] I'm probably offending someone here and
[01:48:46] I'm sorry if you're being offended
[01:48:48] there's no meant to be offense here this
[01:48:50] is just that's what it was called was
[01:48:52] the bus and if you have a problem with
[01:48:54] that I'm sorry I'm not trying to be
[01:48:56] offensive it's just literally what it
[01:48:58] was
[01:48:58] called so I used to drive on that with
[01:49:01] her having a good time the kids on there
[01:49:03] were awesome and I think that's why I I
[01:49:05] had like an affinity to working with
[01:49:06] them when I was in the school and the
[01:49:08] kids loved me it was always a great time
[01:49:09] we always had uh we always had a good
[01:49:12] time with them I was able to get a
[01:49:13] couple of kids to do stuff that no one
[01:49:15] else was able to because for some reason
[01:49:17] they could work with me and live with
[01:49:21] me daughter is a Bad Teacher all right
[01:49:24] yeah I understand that hey there you go
[01:49:26] banana little giveaway for
[01:49:29] you split
[01:49:33] banana dude those buses had AC that is
[01:49:36] correct that was I I will have to say
[01:49:38] though that was probably one of the best
[01:49:40] things about those buses it had AC yes
[01:49:42] it
[01:49:43] did you had to keep the well part of it
[01:49:45] was you had to keep those kids Cal

[01:49:55] splits I went and got one the other day
[01:49:57] at a at the ice cream store anyways I'm
[01:50:00] going to give you a little story about
[01:50:01] the reason why you got to keep them um
[01:50:02] as as um in control as possible so when
[01:50:06] I was riding on the bus one time um
[01:50:09] there was a girl her name was Rosie very
[01:50:10] nice girl but she was like in her
[01:50:12] probably mid 20s I think she was like 21
[01:50:14] or 24 somewhere in that
[01:50:19] area oh all right that's good that's
[01:50:22] good that you got that's nice that you
[01:50:23] get to work with them and um so we had
[01:50:27] uh with the AC broke on the bus okay so
[01:50:31] the AC broke on the bus and it was this
[01:50:32] it was getting to the summer and it was
[01:50:34] worn well um
[01:50:37] Rosie decided it was hot for her and she
[01:50:42] needed to cool
[01:50:43] down anybody guess what Rosie decided
[01:50:46] she wanted to do to co
[01:50:51] down
[01:50:53] anyone no come on someone's G to guess
[01:50:56] what Rosie wanted to
[01:50:58] do someone's got to guess what Rosie
[01:51:01] wanted to do to cool down anyone Dwayne
[01:51:04] Dwayne has an
[01:51:06] idea well Rosie decided she needed to
[01:51:08] take some of her clothes off clothes are
[01:51:11] hot
[01:51:13] exactly so I I think I was in fifth
[01:51:16] grade at the time I remember this and um
[01:51:19] so she starts to take off her pants
[01:51:23] my mom's like Rosie keep your pants on
[01:51:26] I'm like what the what are you talking
[01:51:27] about keep your pants on Rosie that's
[01:51:28] the weirdest comment I turn around oh
[01:51:31] okay well sitting in the front seeing
[01:51:34] like I hear my mom again Rosie pull your
[01:51:37] pants
[01:51:38] up likeit mom um do you need to pull

[01:51:47] gets hot in the AC breaks I'm like oh
[01:51:50] okay that just seems weird whatever
[01:51:51] Rosie pull your pants up Rosie and then
[01:51:55] Rosie decided she wanted to show Trevor

[01:51:59] other sped kids on the
[01:52:01] bus her
[01:52:04] vagina when she cooled down and took her

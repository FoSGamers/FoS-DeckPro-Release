[00:06:41] correct yes that is Magic the Gathering
[00:06:46] Algerian all right yeah nice one there
[00:06:48] that was a bark form har Harvester we'll
[00:06:50] show you at the end what we got for our

[00:06:54] we'll have to get those decided what
[00:06:56] we're going to do with
[00:06:57] it you don't want to go to work you're
[00:06:59] procr hey you know what that's what
[00:07:00] everybody does on a regular basis see uh
[00:07:03] one of the nice things about like
[00:07:04] something called caffeine though is if
[00:07:06] you get up in the morning and you the
[00:07:08] thing is you have to make sure you drink
[00:07:09] like a lot like a whole cup of water
[00:07:11] like8 ounces to 12 ounces of water pound
[00:07:14] that first thing in the morning if you
[00:07:15] can do that and then drink your cup of
[00:07:17] coffee because if you don't have the co
[00:07:19] if you don't have the water going
[00:07:20] through your brain blood vessels are
[00:07:21] still like kind of like tight a little
[00:07:22] bit they're not all open but when you
[00:07:24] put that water in there it opens the
[00:07:25] blood vessels up and then allows the
[00:07:27] caffeine to get in there better and boom
[00:07:29] you got your energy within like I know
[00:07:30] 20
[00:07:32] minutes I so what a lot what a lot of
[00:07:35] people forget about in the morning they
[00:07:36] go and they drink their coffee like oh
[00:07:37] it's not waking me up like dude you need
[00:07:39] to you need to drink water first so that
[00:07:41] your blood vessels are open in your
[00:07:43] brain so that it will
[00:07:46] absorb ah caffeine
[00:07:51] person oh all right aler you know what
[00:07:54] my uh my sons play Pok√©mon we play uh
[00:07:56] some we play Magic the Gathering here uh
[00:07:58] at a little bit older we play that and
[00:08:00] the young my youngest uh he plays
[00:08:03] uh he plays Pokemon in lurana with us uh
[00:08:07] actually and we actually play some
[00:08:08] sorcery too which I think on tomorrow
[00:08:13] for those of you intrigued I think I'll
[00:08:14] have my sorcery box
[00:08:16] ready ah you don't like energy
[00:08:21] drinks see I I never been a fan of
[00:08:23] certain energy drinks they give me like
[00:08:25] heart complications I guess you'll call
[00:08:26] that you know you get feel like my
[00:08:27] heart's Racing for no reason not bad
[00:08:30] little thought
[00:08:36] shucker yeah but yeah we do some magic
[00:08:38] here have some fun not too bad nocturnal
[00:08:43] hunger little dazzling denial not
[00:08:47] bad see the energy drinks are one of the
[00:08:50] things that they they'll get you if you
[00:08:51] drink a lot of them uh or if you drink
[00:08:53] them quick there is a guy that we watch
[00:08:55] um related to fishing um oh blue Gabe I
[00:08:59] don't know if you've ever watch him on
[00:09:00] YouTube he's uh he does fishing in the
[00:09:01] Florida area well his brother um does
[00:09:04] some stuff too and uh his brother had
[00:09:07] pounded an energy drink and uh like
[00:09:10] literally within like a minute he just
[00:09:11] took cracked it
[00:09:12] open drank the whole thing well I guess
[00:09:15] there's something that's called like
[00:09:18] having something having to do with
[00:09:19] Strokes where if you pound the energy
[00:09:21] drink you can actually have a
[00:09:23] stroke so that's he ended up having a
[00:09:25] stroke because of pounding it so this
[00:09:27] another thing just to be careful of
[00:09:30] there weird thinking of that though
[00:09:31] saying that uh let's open this one and
[00:09:33] see what you get here we had these from

[00:10:42] yesterday trying to figure out I
[00:10:44] actually had a little bit of a plan for

[00:10:49] the need to go to the have an ear early

[00:11:00] things in the afternoon when I didn't
[00:11:02] want to have time to do things in the
[00:11:03] afternoon but that's okay gives me more
[00:11:06] time to accomplish um the tasks that I'm

[00:13:48] understand how the world works I'm not
[00:13:49] going to sit here and try to sugar coat
[00:13:50] it for you guys I mean I'll be nice I'm
[00:13:53] not going to be inappropriate thoroughly
[00:13:55] but I'm gonna I'm going to not lie
[00:13:57] that's the only thing that's some I
[00:13:59] think that's what a lot of people never
[00:14:00] liked about me throughout my life is I
[00:14:02] didn't necessarily sugarcoat it and I
[00:14:04] didn't but I wasn't mean like derogatory
[00:14:07] in anyway but I didn't lie if you didn't
[00:14:09] like it um I'm sorry dude I don't know
[00:14:11] what to tell you that's not my fault for
[00:14:13] you not liking what occurred all right
[00:14:15] anyways we're going to open this one
[00:14:22] here yeah see I learned how to over the
[00:14:25] years how to um how to when you do
[00:14:28] sugarcoat it you how to sound a little
[00:14:29] nicer how to not instead of sugar coning
[00:14:32] it you can still sound a little nicer
[00:14:34] with the way you kind of say things
[00:14:36] certain ways so like the word choices
[00:14:38] you use and stuff like that but that's
[00:14:40] that's like kind of like years of
[00:14:42] experience and that's also part of the I
[00:14:44] will have to admit that is part of that
[00:14:46] going to the private high school where
[00:14:47] the teachers I had I mean I had a
[00:14:49] teacher that gave me detention for two
[00:14:51] months by the first my freshman year

[00:46:58] you can kind of see it right there now
[00:47:00] let's get all these things packed
[00:47:01] together here Robert cuz that was
[00:47:02] awesome
[00:47:04] hits I'm thoroughly jealous of that
[00:47:09] one see this is what I say when people
[00:47:11] like oh those box boxes are dead or all
[00:47:14] kinds of stuff like that like you never
[00:47:15] know what
[00:47:18] happens because we uh the last pack of
[00:47:21] the other box that we had people like oh
[00:47:23] there's nothing in that box because we
[00:47:25] pulled out a card like this and the
[00:47:27] literally it was the last second to last
[00:47:29] pack we ended up pulling a
[00:47:32] uh foil raised a raised foil because
[00:47:35] people thought the box was dead so never
[00:47:37] think a box is dead until the box is
[00:47:40] empty cuz one time we thought the box
[00:47:42] was dead too and no one wanted to buy
[00:47:44] lost Caverns packs out of the Dead box
[00:47:47] because there was only three packs left
[00:47:48] and somebody had just pulled the caverns
[00:47:50] of souls that was blue foil while
[00:47:53] somebody after ended up pulling a
[00:47:55] rainbow monoc Crypt out of it it was
[00:47:57] like the craziest thing after it was his
[00:47:58] birthday too so that made it even
[00:48:04] better not doing too bad my friend I've
[00:48:07] been
[00:48:10] better they do they do like to hang out
[00:48:13] with other nice
[00:48:16] cards oh on the bottom it'll say here r
[00:48:20] m um U or c for like
[00:48:23] uncommon uh and then like like other
[00:48:26] stuff like that
[00:48:27] so that's how you know M Mythic and that
[00:48:29] type of thing and the number here that's
[00:48:30] why I say BLC so for this the reason I
[00:48:32] say this reason why I say the BLC and
[00:48:34] stuff is if you do this SL
[00:48:37] pblc 79 all right if you do that in the
[00:48:41] chat here it actually gives you the
[00:48:43] price of the cards that's why I tell
[00:48:45] people to type that's why I say the
[00:48:46] number when I'm I'm reading those off
[00:48:49] that was a nice pickup there Robert
[00:48:57] yeah I'm working on trying to make my
[00:48:59] own this is what I have from someone
[00:49:02] else excuse me I'm working on making my
[00:49:04] own because I want to be able to use it
[00:49:07] um when I'm on um other streaming
[00:49:11] stations so right now like I can't use
[00:49:13] it when I'm on YouTube people want to
[00:49:15] check in on YouTube it doesn't do
[00:49:16] anything so I want to have it so it will
[00:49:18] combine all the check-ins across whether
[00:49:20] it's YouTube or whatever it is so that's
[00:49:22] why I'm saying like I'm trying to get it
[00:49:23] to do that type of stuff have some fun
[00:49:24] with that and I'm I'm working on my own
[00:49:29] slash checkin allows you to check in to
[00:49:32] uh and the reason why we do the
[00:49:33] check-ins is if you do uh SL check goals
[00:49:36] it'll tell you what we try to do those
[00:49:38] check-in goals for early winter we'll
[00:49:40] throw some singles here in a minute
[00:49:41] little Finch formation for
[00:49:49] you yes thank you Robert I appreciate
[00:49:52] that a
[00:49:53] lot
[00:49:54] yes it's kind of um it's it's like you
[00:49:57] know like
[00:50:01] um trying to think of another I don't
[00:50:03] know Pokemon I can't use that I'm trying
[00:50:05] to think of another set to use as an
[00:50:07] example but I was going to use sorcery
[00:50:08] but not everybody knows even sorcery so
[00:50:11] yeah yeah just shows shows it on the
[00:50:12] bottom yeah shows it on the bottom is
[00:50:14] what it
[00:50:15] is those are nice
[00:50:17] pickups I'm going to throw out some
[00:50:19] singles here I'm going to keep doing
[00:50:20] what I was doing before with some
[00:50:22] singles going
[00:50:23] out we were just talking about somebody
[00:50:26] asked how how you how you um know what
[00:50:28] the uh card is uh what like if it's
[00:50:31] Rarity
[00:50:33] is so we were just explaining that to
[00:50:39] somebody maybe somebody wants a little
[00:50:41] Gates here nice
[00:50:47] pickup now this will go top loader
[00:50:50] because it's going to go for this and
[00:50:52] you're going to get a nice little
[00:50:53] discount there
[00:50:59] what does the H mean on the
[00:51:03] card like like these things down here so
[00:51:06] for instance like n3c would be the would
[00:51:08] be the um this is modern Horizons 3
[00:51:12] Commander um like in the other ones you
[00:51:14] might see it might say like M like this
[00:51:16] one here we'll say like otj it's a
[00:51:20] Outlaws of Thunder Junction which is why
[00:51:22] it has otj on the bottom there and then
[00:51:24] it's just a number that is in is the is
[00:51:27] a
[00:51:27] language the
[00:51:36] H what does h mean I don't know what h
[00:51:39] means I might be missing
[00:51:47] something oh oh oh that would be um
[00:51:50] that's probably one of the cards that's
[00:51:52] a that's like a token uh it's a token
[00:51:54] card of some kind so hold on let me see
[00:51:57] if I can find one here I had I pulled
[00:51:59] out a few of them give me a
[00:52:02] second it's like a token of some kind
[00:52:04] let you know like it's a certain part of
[00:52:06] the game that you get to use it so it's
[00:52:08] kind of like this here where it gives
[00:52:10] you a little explanation of something
[00:52:11] going on in the
[00:52:15] game yeah helper cards exactly helper
[00:52:18] it's kind of like a token it just kind
[00:52:20] of explain something that goes on the
[00:52:21] game yeah thank you helper card I don't
[00:52:24] know exactly the term that it was used
[00:52:26] for it so I appreciate
[00:52:29] that I actually don't know how to easily
[00:52:32] know that how would you how would I find
[00:52:33] that
[00:52:34] easily
[00:52:36] Oblivion get a little three steps ahead
[00:52:39] throw that out there for you if you like
[00:52:41] for uh
[00:52:45] this like I said we're going to keep
[00:52:47] just uh going through the singles here
[00:52:49] and putting them away into some sleeves
[00:52:51] and we're going to try to decide what we
[00:52:52] want to do with them today
[00:53:00] yes tokens can be labeled t or H one one
[00:53:03] is the the ones that have like words on
[00:53:05] them and say a bunch of stuff that's
[00:53:07] like a helper card and that's why you
[00:53:08] get your H like the Monarch card will
[00:53:11] have I think has h on it if I remember
[00:53:13] right because it tells you that you're
[00:53:15] the Monarch and explains what the
[00:53:16] Monarch
[00:53:21] is yeah like I was saying to everybody
[00:53:23] before if anybody wants any like a chunk
[00:53:24] of a certain amount of cards like say
[00:53:26] you you see me going through these like
[00:53:27] hey put all those off the side for me
[00:53:29] because I want a bunch of the rats let
[00:53:31] me know we can do
[00:53:33] that somebody was looking for an
[00:53:34] overprotect earlier I know that and I
[00:53:37] found your overprotect and there was
[00:53:38] another C that person was looking for
[00:53:40] and I can't remember what it was so I'm
[00:53:41] going to just put that right there in
[00:53:42] the
[00:53:43] background all right here we go we're
[00:53:45] going to put this up here
[00:53:49] next R
[00:53:51] Us Now Solitude for whatever reason
[00:53:54] doesn't work with the price thing
[00:53:59] has something to do with the
[00:54:02] uh with what it is so it's uh we'll go
[00:54:05] with that one is a on screen single
[00:54:08] instead of a $16 card this is going to
[00:54:10] go out for
[00:54:14] 14 Circle dot is common Forest sided
[00:54:18] diamond is uncommon star symbol is rare
[00:54:20] or above all right thank you for letting
[00:54:23] me know that it's kind of that's kind of
[00:54:24] like um lurana is like they have that
[00:54:26] type of one too so thank you I
[00:54:28] appreciate
[00:54:31] that got to have your key to know what
[00:54:33] you're going on with
[00:54:37] there got a little Glide dive
[00:54:40] Duo night World
[00:54:46] hermit yeah yeah pretty much you just
[00:54:48] got to memorize it I had mind the
[00:54:51] Assassin's Creed set Benjamin um I would
[00:54:54] have liked to I think it would have been
[00:54:55] nice if it uh if it was
[00:55:03] um I think it would have been nice if
[00:55:05] they had some more to it I think the
[00:55:08] cards were fun but I think there was not
[00:55:10] enough value in the cards for the price
[00:55:12] they were trying to get them to sell at
[00:55:13] so I think they need to put more value
[00:55:15] in those ones
[00:55:21] Benjamin yes that too so yes for example
[00:55:25] here
[00:55:27] we have a Starscape cleric right here is
[00:55:29] a star showing that it's a foil and on
[00:55:32] this one we have the land with a DOT
[00:55:35] showing it is not a foil look at that
[00:55:37] speaking of the
[00:55:48] devil yes yeah it depends on it depends
[00:55:51] on where you're going yeah what you're
[00:55:52] getting for packs and stuff
[00:56:01] all right I don't do too much with
[00:56:03] Pokemon I've had an option of getting
[00:56:04] them
[00:56:08] before yes m is generally
[00:56:12] Mythic
[00:56:19] correct that does generally stand for
[00:56:23] Mythic correct
[00:56:26] let's see if I have any mythics right
[00:56:28] here that I can show you so like this
[00:56:30] for instance
[00:56:32] M like that one no one wants this
[00:56:35] Solitude so we're going to throw this
[00:56:37] out
[00:56:44] igara there you go maybe somebody would
[00:56:48] like
[00:56:49] that that is a uh $14 card coming at you
[00:56:53] for this
[00:56:55] there he you got double
[00:56:57] down thank you thank you I appreciate I

[00:57:09] card when did you pick that one
[00:57:20] up yes yep there's always some short
[00:57:23] prints that are even more that are more
[00:57:25] rare because like the types they are
[00:57:27] type of foils or like the you know that
[00:57:29] or if they're serialized or something
[00:57:31] but m is basically the Mythic oh nice
[00:57:35] that's a good one there nice not
[00:57:37] bad not
[00:57:39] bad I like
[00:57:41] it now if you do say if you have the
[00:57:44] card with you right now and you do SL p
[00:57:47] and then you do whatever that and you
[00:57:49] type in the whatever the number is for
[00:57:51] double down there
[00:57:59] The Outlaws I'm guessing is what you're
[00:58:01] talking about Outlaws of Thunder
[00:58:04] Junction so if you yeah so if you type
[00:58:07] SLP space
[00:58:09] OT J space
[00:58:13] 44 see how it got otj which is that
[00:58:16] bottom number there otj would correlate
[00:58:18] to this BLB number all right now I'll
[00:58:22] tell you what it is so you see what the
[00:58:23] price that it is
[00:58:24] there yeah
[00:58:27] yeah yeah it really depends on the set
[00:58:29] too really depends on the set too I

[00:58:52] show
[00:59:00] fatal push I don't remember that one I
[00:59:04] don't know why it's not sounding

[00:59:39] foil version of something that is a
[00:59:42] non-foil version of a set of a card and
[00:59:44] it would be like
[00:59:45] A110 say from time spiral but if you get
[00:59:48] the foil version of it it could be like

[01:12:26] giveaway is what I'm looking at here
[01:12:29] I've had a couple sacrifice of the
[01:12:31] Gods but I us it seems like most of them
[01:12:34] say most of you saying use it for the
[01:12:36] giveaway stuff we can do that I guess we
[01:12:39] can do that should we add the lands into
[01:12:41] the giveaways or should we just do the
[01:12:46] cards what do you guys think I don't
[01:12:48] know we add the lands in just to go with
[01:12:51] the
[01:12:53] cards you said sacrifice I knew I had a
[01:12:56] feeling it was you saying sacrifice
[01:12:59] Oblivion but there's actually four
[01:13:01] people that have said sacrifice so far
[01:13:03] now so what do you what would we do if
[01:13:05] we're going to sacrifice
[01:13:08] them how are we going to sacrifice them
[01:13:11] I guess I should
[01:13:13] ask no one wants a thought
[01:13:15] Seas let's put out maybe a born upon the
[01:13:23] wind there we go little born upon on the
[01:13:27] win Eric coming in there with a uh

[01:13:58] shipping if you end up picking up one of
[01:14:00] them as long as they the ones that are
[01:14:01] going the plain white
[01:14:11] envelope

[01:14:38] a little fire that's
[01:14:43] going yes throw them on a little boat
[01:14:45] like a viking
[01:14:47] funeral one two three four that's not a
[01:14:50] bad idea take all the cards that we are

[01:14:54] Viking funeral throw them on a boat and
[01:14:55] push them out to see while in the middle
[01:14:58] of the ocean and I'll have a little bow
[01:14:59] I can shoot onto it to light them on
[01:15:03] fire probably have to shoot the bow a
[01:15:05] million times and then actually have
[01:15:06] just a little fake thing on there that I
[01:15:07] press a button to make it go because I'm
[01:15:08] not gonna be able to hit

[01:30:41] tomorrow I'm gonna be getting the um the
[01:30:43] uh what do you call it from him the the
[01:30:46] hopefully the
[01:30:48] um the Monty Python because I was like I
[01:30:52] guess they sold out
[01:30:54] while I was in line waiting which really
[01:30:56] pisses me off by the way don't tell
[01:30:58] somebody you're in line and you're
[01:30:59] logged in you're able to get something
[01:31:01] and then all of a sudden you can't get
[01:31:03] anything like that really ticked me off
[01:31:05] I'm just throwing that one out there
[01:31:07] Wizards correct that crap don't put
[01:31:10] somebody in line and say that you're in
[01:31:11] line and you have your stuff reserved
[01:31:13] and then let other people buy it out
[01:31:14] from under
[01:31:17] them
[01:31:20] Robert mayard
[01:31:28] happen to you guys too yeah that sucks
[01:31:31] yeah D I was in line I had it I'm like
[01:31:34] all right sweet I got I got one of each
[01:31:36] I'm I was getting three of each of the
[01:31:38] ones so that I can have one for myself
[01:31:40] to open one to keep sealed because I
[01:31:43] like to keep some of them sealed and
[01:31:45] then one for the
[01:31:46] store and just didn't in that
[01:31:50] way oh yeah I was oh I was I was ticked
[01:31:54] off because Monty Python is one of my
[01:31:55] favorite
[01:31:58] things Storm Cat Mentor B yeah not not
[01:32:01] the big hit but hey D it gives you a
[01:32:04] discount on shipping if you
[01:32:11] want d
[01:32:14] willly 33 D Wily 33 can you give me a
[01:32:17] dis uh number between one and 10 my
[01:32:19] friend
[01:32:27] yes they should do the print on demand
[01:32:29] for it I do agree with that that like I
[01:32:31] mean that I I like that model of it I
[01:32:34] don't know why they did like they went
[01:32:35] away from there people can get what they
[01:32:37] want if they don't want it and it ends
[01:32:39] up selling out and somebody wants it
[01:32:40] later and it becomes a high value thing
[01:32:42] great
[01:32:43] wonderful but don't make it so that no
[01:32:46] one can get it when they first want it
[01:32:48] if it ends up becoming a high value item
[01:32:50] because not a lot of people ended up
[01:32:51] getting it pre-ordering it and end up
[01:32:53] being something super cool that people
[01:32:55] want yeah all right makes
[01:32:59] sense yeah they switch from print to
[01:33:01] demand it's annoying very
[01:33:04] annoying all right my
[01:33:06] friend dwai I'm gonna do a d10 actually
[01:33:09] you know what Robert if you want since
[01:33:11] you were the last one to pick something

[01:33:27] be the giveaway card there let's see if
[01:33:29] it's the rare that's in here we'll find
[01:33:32] out thank you Robert I appreciate
[01:33:35] that yeah well you know it's one of
[01:33:37] those things where oh by the way my
[01:33:40] sorcery pull box should be done
[01:33:42] tomorrow I think I'll have it finished
[01:33:45] tomorrow I think I'm at that point where
[01:33:47] I'll be done with it tomorrow there for
[01:33:49] you guys that were looking in into it I
[01:33:52] will make sure that my uh my thumbnail
[01:33:54] does display that we have the sorcery
[01:33:56] pull box completed so that you guys are
[01:33:58] aware you ladies gentlemen and days
[01:34:00] hanging out in here whoever you happen
[01:34:02] to be sometimes people have their own
[01:34:04] thing you know whatever you want to do I
[01:34:05] don't care that's you that's your life
[01:34:07] man it's your life person be what you
[01:34:09] want I don't care as long as you're not
[01:34:12] mean then I do
[01:34:20] care all right here we go this is from
[01:34:22] our last one we got the liver River long
[01:34:25] rivers
[01:34:28] pole Starscape cleric so it looks like
[01:34:31] you guys want me to put these into a
[01:34:33] giveaway poll box Uncharted Haven so
[01:34:36] maybe that's what I do so I'll throw it
[01:34:38] in there I'll give everybody maybe um
[01:34:40] one pull from the box where one of the
[01:34:43] cards in it has a uh maybe one of the
[01:34:46] cards in there will have something
[01:34:47] that's written like a pack on them maybe
[01:34:49] that's what we'll do and we'll have to
[01:34:52] see
[01:34:53] what it ends up being in the
[01:34:55] end it'll be uh may I don't know maybe
[01:34:58] that's what I'll end up doing with the
[01:34:59] pull box add add a pack or so in it with
[01:35:02] a couple nice cards but have it'll be
[01:35:04] like a you know a couple hundred cards
[01:35:05] in there because of all we pulled out
[01:35:08] what's that thing that sound like a good
[01:35:09] one it seems like that's what most
[01:35:10] people are looking for here they like
[01:35:12] that idea with 22 going with that so
[01:35:16] far I don't know I think that's a pretty
[01:35:18] good
[01:35:19] idea make some entertainment for you
[01:35:21] guys while we're hanging out remember we
[01:35:23] do have all of our other games that

[01:38:48] in there
[01:38:55] yes we're living on a boat yes TT one
[01:38:57] two three four five I'm moving to live
[01:39:00] on a boat we're going to be traveling
[01:39:02] around Caribbean and Bahamas and us on
[01:39:05] that boat on said boat correct um I told
[01:39:09] my wife when I met her I want to tra I
[01:39:10] want to travel the world I want to sail
[01:39:12] around the world and she kind of she
[01:39:14] liked the idea of it but uh you know
[01:39:16] dwindled away and I kept telling her
[01:39:17] every year for the most part I want to
[01:39:19] sail around the world I tried to get a
[01:39:21] sailboat a couple times when we were up
[01:39:22] in New England and she shot that one
[01:39:24] down we ended up getting a speedboat
[01:39:26] then uh when we moved down here we uh
[01:39:28] down to Florida where we are we had our
[01:39:29] we have our center console that we had
[01:39:31] lots of fun with that one but uh we
[01:39:33] ended up on a sailing trip where we were
[01:39:35] in h a flotilla which was actually a
[01:39:37] YouTube channel does it sailing Doodles
[01:39:40] they had a flotilla in the Bahamas last
[01:39:42] year and she we had a 45 foot catamaran
[01:39:45] we were on and I sailed that for like a
[01:39:47] week for the most part by myself because
[01:39:48] the captain was like all right you know
[01:39:50] what you're doing and he let me sail and
[01:39:52] my wife was like wow this is fun I'm
[01:39:53] like I told you it's not that bad let's
[01:39:55] do this she's been on board for then no
[01:39:57] like permanent my friend permanent my
[01:39:59] friend we're doing that for years the
[01:40:03] goal is to travel the world see where we
[01:40:05] can find a place that we like the most
[01:40:08] buy a piece of property there if we can
[01:40:10] and then settle down when we want to
[01:40:12] retire that was kind of the
[01:40:19] plan yes
[01:40:23] yes that's why I was talking about the
[01:40:25] fish Marlin when I saw your
[01:40:29] name oh the giveaway didn't start I'm
[01:40:32] sorry I thought it did hit must have hit
[01:40:35] no must have got must have been one of
[01:40:36] those ones that did the error on
[01:40:39] me but yeah I do uh yeah that's what
[01:40:41] we're going that's our plan we've been
[01:40:43] planning this for a little while um we
[01:40:46] but we jumped into it a little bit
[01:40:47] earlier than we were going to originally
[01:40:49] it was going to happen like a couple
[01:40:50] years from now jumped into a little bit
[01:40:52] earlier when uh I had a boss change and
[01:40:54] just was not happy with that about the
[01:40:58] rather narcissistic boss so rather than
[01:41:00] dealing with that we had other options
[01:41:02] so we took
[01:41:05] them oh nice nice Marlin yeah we uh my
[01:41:09] family were fishermen all in New England
[01:41:11] for Generations actually I was uh on my
[01:41:13] from my father like I think I was one of
[01:41:15] the first males to go off to college I
[01:41:17] might have actually been the first one
[01:41:19] to go to college out of like my family
[01:41:21] because we all they were all fisherman
[01:41:22] freed
[01:41:24] Generations you'll do a bloomo pull I
[01:41:27] like it Marlins all
[01:41:30] right here we go we'll throw that out
[01:41:33] there we'll throw that out there for you
[01:41:35] if you want
[01:41:37] it Marlins is liking
[01:41:41] it yeah we do we go out fishing
[01:41:44] regularly myself here but uh we haven't
[01:41:46] recently just because of just selling
[01:41:49] the house and getting everything going
[01:41:50] now we're selling the boat even so know
[01:41:53] don't go out as much as we used to but I
[01:41:55] used to go out like 20 30 miles out to a
[01:41:57] few different places get some grouper
[01:41:59] some
[01:42:01] snapper good stuff there whisker scribe
[01:42:04] all right my friend yeah and now with
[01:42:07] what we're doing we'll be able to do it
[01:42:08] more frequently all right here we go
[01:42:10] move this over to oh
[01:42:18] no oh damn it I'm going to have to show
[01:42:20] that I'll show everybody the things in
[01:42:22] the card so that you can see it because
[01:42:23] it got knocked
[01:42:27] over nothing I'm
[01:42:30] fine I said oh
[01:42:32] no I just knocked over this
[01:42:36] box I pulled the stuff oh

[01:43:54] decent things that you might want to
[01:43:55] spice a deck up with it's only it's not

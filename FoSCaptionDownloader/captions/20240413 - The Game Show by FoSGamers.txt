[00:05:13] to be yes it is all right here we go
[00:05:16] let's uh let's run this though so you
[00:05:18] guys get to try out will want to the Box
[00:05:20] explained so I'm gonna run it for a
[00:05:22] second so you guys can have the box
[00:05:23] explained hopefully you guys can hear me
[00:05:25] since there's no one in here but that's
[00:05:27] one of those days right it's a s today
[00:05:30] so the boxes are William you pick they
[00:05:32] would pick any of the boxes kind of like
[00:05:34] the the other thing we did the hunt but
[00:05:36] they would pick a box inside one of the
[00:05:37] box is a Pog with a pack of cards or a
[00:05:40] set of something or whatever is right on
[00:05:42] it and that's it they would pick it i'
[00:05:43] I'd grab it and have it and that's it
[00:05:45] why do you have this thing on that be
[00:05:46] some cold I told you to go and change
[00:05:49] not put that on I a CH you this is what
[00:05:52] you would wear
[00:05:54] outside no but go and change completely
[00:05:56] to as if you were going to be going
[00:05:58] outside somewhere use some respect when
[00:06:01] I give you some I ask you to do
[00:06:10] something children right that's what
[00:06:12] you're gonna have to do your entire life
[00:06:13] if you have them argue with them because
[00:06:16] you give them instructions and they go
[00:06:17] what do you mean you told me to put
[00:06:19] clothes on I just changed uh I changed
[00:06:21] my shirt see I put clothes on like dude
[00:06:26] no that means like if we need to go
[00:06:27] somewhere you need to get ready as if
[00:06:31] say I was going to walk out of the house
[00:06:33] right now you would be ready to do that
[00:06:36] that that concept does not go through
[00:06:37] some children's head it's like you need
[00:06:39] to give them it's the uh the programmer
[00:06:41] problem though they're all they're all
[00:06:42] miniature programmers and because
[00:06:44] they're all miniature programmers all
[00:06:46] the thing they can do is they can only
[00:06:48] follow a specific direct instructions
[00:06:51] and if they have any other instruction
[00:06:53] or those aren't direct enough they're
[00:06:55] frakin
[00:06:57] lost yeah sure will
[00:07:00] sure that's fine that's fine that's
[00:07:11] fine all
[00:07:16] right let's see here we did not want any
[00:07:18] of those so let's try out some of the
[00:07:20] other ones here and to throw out the
[00:07:21] giveaway here oh no we're going to get
[00:07:23] the
[00:07:24] uh that
[00:07:28] one run that that
[00:07:31] there and there you are I got one of
[00:07:33] them up there one of those why does it
[00:07:35] always auto correct I don't want you to
[00:07:36] auto Correct for me when I'm typing

[00:15:01] literally when she opens the door I put
[00:15:03] a piece of tape on whatever package is
[00:15:04] in front so that as soon as she opens
[00:15:06] the door she sees that and all she needs
[00:15:08] to do is scan it take the packages out
[00:15:10] and leave does that make
[00:15:15] sense no problem guess I'm trying to exp
[00:15:18] my wife is helping out putting the
[00:15:19] packages in the mailbox for our lady to
[00:15:22] come and pick them up and she's okay
[00:15:23] with it because she said like the way I
[00:15:25] guess me putting him in the mailbox she
[00:15:26] like you put them in the mailbox and you
[00:15:27] give you the one thing to scan and it
[00:15:29] makes it Wicked easy for me because she
[00:15:31] just needs to grab them and go uh and
[00:15:33] she goes other people don't do anything
[00:15:35] like that you actually put some effort
[00:15:36] into it and she appreciate she
[00:15:38] appreciated it I'm like oh because I
[00:15:39] went over to where go hey we gave her
[00:15:41] for Christmas like a like a little
[00:15:42] Dunkin Don's coffee card and I want us I

[00:15:51] refill it for her saying thank you uh
[00:15:53] but she goes don't don't ever do that
[00:15:54] you don't even need you didn't need to
[00:15:55] do that for that time this is my job
[00:15:56] this is what I get paid to do I'm like
[00:15:58] yeah but I'm giving you a bunch of
[00:15:59] packages to pick up I feel at least you
[00:16:01] know say a little thank you for you so
[00:16:02] you are doing a much better help than
[00:16:05] anyone else because they all just leave
[00:16:06] the packages at their door and I have to
[00:16:08] walk up to get them at least you dring
[00:16:10] them over and you put them in your
[00:16:11] mailbox and you put the one label on it

[00:17:24] can say random or you can give me
[00:17:25] numbers for the boxes they're uh so or I
[00:17:28] can pick random it's up to you we can
[00:17:30] see what happens that way if you beat
[00:17:31] the boss you're able to
[00:17:34] uh get a loot pack for the Wasteland for
[00:17:37] a dollar
[00:17:38] drop we're going to go with the
[00:17:40] mutant they're walking through the
[00:17:42] Wasteland here and he said me pit and I
[00:17:45] can pick for you so I'll go through and
[00:17:47] I'll pick some randoms for you since it
[00:17:48] sounds like you're driving and that's
[00:17:49] what you'd like me to do here so I'm G
[00:17:51] to go through and I'm gonna do that we
[00:17:52] got some randoms for you we're going
[00:17:54] through this Wasteland as a mutant and
[00:17:56] what we're going to hopefully find on
[00:17:58] our way is a uh is some friends so
[00:18:01] you're going as a mutant and you see
[00:18:03] something in the distance you go maybe
[00:18:05] that is some food that I can find we
[00:18:08] don't know is there one there there is
[00:18:11] one there let's see what have you found
[00:18:15] no the mutant did not find food they
[00:18:18] found some treasure but when they go and
[00:18:19] pick it up it is booby trapped it blows
[00:18:22] off two of their nine fingers they're
[00:18:25] now only left with 12
[00:18:28] whatever that math doesn't work out
[00:18:30] they're mutants that's okay they don't
[00:18:32] care you're going on fishing finish your
[00:18:35] trip to the Wasteland though with the
[00:18:37] couple L fingers hopefully hoping that
[00:18:39] you can find a friend along the way
[00:18:42] maybe somebody that can help you who
[00:18:43] knows come on which one we coming out
[00:18:45] here wh this one we'll go with that one
[00:18:47] right there here we go we got a mutant
[00:18:50] another mutant friend comes out hey go
[00:18:52] buddy I have like four extra fingers I'm
[00:18:54] going to give you two and there you are
[00:18:56] you're back up to full strength
[00:18:58] wandering through the Wasteland
[00:18:59] wonderful my friend you wander through
[00:19:01] the Wasteland at full
[00:19:03] strength and you bump into something in
[00:19:07] the distance now you're hoping it's a
[00:19:10] friend but you're not sure yet so I got
[00:19:13] to shuffle the cards up because I always
[00:19:14] Shuffle the 12 as you go wandering
[00:19:16] through you find in the distance this
[00:19:19] thing that pops out
[00:19:24] is a warrior that's not helpful that
[00:19:29] Warrior comes and attacks you swinging
[00:19:30] at you and chops those two fingers off
[00:19:32] that they gave you your mutant friend
[00:19:35] gave you bringing you back down to three
[00:19:36] strength but you know what that is okay
[00:19:38] because with three strength you could
[00:19:40] potentially beat two of the 10 bosses in
[00:19:42] the Wasteland here all right so if you
[00:19:44] could beat two of the 10 bosses that
[00:19:46] means one two three four five six seven
[00:19:49] eight nine and 10 all right G to shuffle
[00:19:52] them let's see if we have a luck off to
[00:19:54] beat any of those
[00:19:56] two here we go we're going to go with
[00:20:00] the one hiding in the back say that one
[00:20:03] hiding is the issue it's hiding because
[00:20:05] it scared of you in you're three
[00:20:06] strength as you oh no that was a lie
[00:20:10] it's not hiding because of the three
[00:20:12] strength it's hiding because it was
[00:20:14] galta and he was coming to Stampede
[00:20:15] around grab you and eat you as a mtin he
[00:20:18] thought you were a good meal nice meal
[00:20:20] and he jumps jumps off the rest of your
[00:20:23] hand but luckily when he drags you
[00:20:25] you're able to drop drops you off as
[00:20:26] your hand gets bitten off right next to
[00:20:28] a vault and you see in the vault a Benji
[00:20:32] whenever you play one of our adventure
[00:20:33] games you get one of the three packs
[00:20:35] here just a little a do a pack of
[00:20:37] something under a dollar nothing special
[00:20:39] so here you go um you did say random so

[00:21:01] wasn't a Benji it was an envelope but in
[00:21:03] that they thought it was important to

[00:27:08] we're lucky enough maybe we can actually
[00:27:09] do our trip around the world on a boat
[00:27:10] with the family and you guys can follow
[00:27:12] us while we do our magic stuff I thought

[00:27:20] nice signed art nice signed art on that
[00:27:22] one I like that hidden Courtyard

[00:28:05] be in
[00:28:06] Outlaw all right yeah yeah yeah no
[00:28:10] exactly yeah so my family my whole plan
[00:28:12] I wanted to do my entire life is I
[00:28:14] actually wanted to be on a boat to
[00:28:15] travel around the world my goal was to
[00:28:17] be on a boat and do a literally a trip a
[00:28:19] circumvent in the world at some point
[00:28:22] that's when since I was a child since I
[00:28:23] was like in high school and to tell my
[00:28:25] wife that and then finally I think there
[00:28:27] she's on board after trip we did now
[00:28:29] that we might be able to do that with
[00:28:30] the family she's like oh actually
[00:28:31] actually might be good with looking at
[00:28:32] some of the boats that we were on and
[00:28:34] stuff like that so I'm trying to figure
[00:28:36] out if we can uh do it if I can it's uh
[00:28:40] I was GNA actually um people have been
[00:28:41] making comments to me about um they like
[00:28:45] the uh I do a good job with my stories
[00:28:50] I've been I've been told almost every
[00:28:51] one of the streams that I need to be a
[00:28:52] dungeon master and I don't I'm like I
[00:28:54] don't I haven't done that since I was a
[00:28:55] kid like what do you mean I need to be a
[00:28:57] dungeon master I just looked into it
[00:28:59] happened to me just just because I know
[00:29:00] um at the store I go to Joel he plays um
[00:29:03] and I was like you know what maybe I'll
[00:29:04] play with him one day and see see if it
[00:29:05] can be a dungeon master and see what
[00:29:06] they're talking about so I was looking
[00:29:08] it up to see what it is and for some
[00:29:10] reason it pupped up that there's famous
[00:29:11] dungeon Masters I'm like this famous
[00:29:13] dungeon Masters I didn't know that like

[00:34:36] dungeon games going see if it'll work

[00:34:56] you like to see me uh
[00:34:58] in another country giving you some
[00:35:02] uh actually I'm GNA have to do a whole
[00:35:04] another do that way giving you an
[00:35:06] adventure through uh through something
[00:35:09] you think that'd be kind of fun or is
[00:35:10] that silly is that
[00:35:13] silly and then stre on the boat yeah
[00:35:17] we'll be streaming it from where we are
[00:35:18] on the boat or maybe I'll set it up
[00:35:20] where we stream from land and we'll uh
[00:35:24] we'll have some things in the background
[00:35:25] and we'll use the background as part of
[00:35:26] it know what I
[00:35:34] mean no no no
[00:35:37] no yeah correct that's for cards that's
[00:35:39] what I plan on doing with a card store
[00:35:41] if I'm able to do that
[00:35:43] correct yes exactly and now my other
[00:35:46] thing that I was thinking though was if
[00:35:47] we do the dungeon stuff like people are
[00:35:49] talking about I would do a pretty good
[00:35:50] job being a dungeon master with the
[00:35:52] stories that I do that I was thinking of
[00:35:54] doing those as doing Patron and we can
[00:35:56] do those games as we're traveling and
[00:35:59] see if people will be willing to pay for
[00:36:00] us to do those if that's something that
[00:36:02] they'd like to
[00:36:04] do yeah you can video from the boat you
[00:36:06] can do all the videoing YouTube you can
[00:36:09] do it

[00:36:17] couldn't find the one that you wanted

[00:36:21] like 30 twos gas or is that like a
[00:36:24] specific reason for putting all those

[00:51:54] want
[00:51:55] them but you did say rip it all
[00:51:58] so they can go home all right all right
[00:52:01] cool we'll do that we'll send those home

[00:59:44] bottom if it's high or low if it says
[00:59:46] high or low We Roll if you get it right
[00:59:48] depending on how many you get right we

[01:00:13] morning because we like to do multiple
[01:00:14] things to give them as deals at a time
[01:00:18] so we're going to put those back maybe
[01:00:20] just did not want those cards how does
[01:00:22] it work all right so I'm going to run
[01:00:25] this again I'll explain the high low
[01:00:28] high low is very easy you pick you just
[01:00:30] want one of these cards it's a dollar
[01:00:32] you're bidding a dollar and you're going
[01:00:33] to buy any of these cards maybe somebody
[01:00:35] else bids and they want to get one but
[01:00:37] whatever you bid up to whatever price
[01:00:39] you're comfortable with to get one of
[01:00:40] the cards here once you have the winning
[01:00:43] of the bid you choose which card it is
[01:00:46] say you say I want Insidious Roots you
[01:00:47] go all right I'm taking Insidious Roots
[01:00:50] I'm gonna run this again here actually
[01:00:51] I'll run it again here for 45 seconds
[01:00:53] that way I can explain it
[01:00:56] and free barking you got the giby thank
[01:00:58] you yeah the Legos are smart I my kids
[01:01:00] were using them and helped lowake them
[01:01:02] so here what we have is on the bottom of
[01:01:04] the Lego you'll say is this high or low
[01:01:07] and whatever one it'll be an H or an L
[01:01:09] you'll say high or low and then you
[01:01:10] guess if it's high if you get it right
[01:01:12] you get one roll if you get it wrong you
[01:01:14] don't then you'll then since you don't
[01:01:15] get this one I'll go say what's on the
[01:01:17] bottom of this you'll guess whether it's
[01:01:19] high or low if you want it uh if you get
[01:01:21] it right or you wrong it's depending on
[01:01:24] if you get it right you get another rle
[01:01:25] if you get it wrong you don't get one
[01:01:27] then you guess for this one but you do
[01:01:28] not get this since you don't pick that
[01:01:29] card you get this as a higher low you
[01:01:32] get a roll also that's really what it is
[01:01:35] you're just guessing which is on the
[01:01:37] bottom I try was thinking a way of doing
[01:01:39] it where the cards would have some
[01:01:41] monitary worth and you could guess
[01:01:43] higher or lower kind of like when you do
[01:01:46] uh when you do uh uh price right but I
[01:01:50] couldn't figure out a way of doing it so
[01:01:52] this is the best way I could figure it
[01:01:53] out here so arm mellion what one do you
[01:01:56] want your
[01:01:57] friend for my friend for the uh for the
[01:02:00] card
[01:02:03] here you want ohare Pac deepest epic

[01:02:11] here high or
[01:02:16] low low it is high it is high on the
[01:02:20] bottom of that one I'm sorry un
[01:02:22] Insidious Roots you did not get that
[01:02:24] card you chose the other but what one
[01:02:26] you think is on the bottom of
[01:02:30] this low low it is you got one one there
[01:02:34] you go all right here we go on the
[01:02:35] bottom of this one on T tyar what is
[01:02:38] under
[01:02:40] tyar low L again good job you got two so
[01:02:44] you have two rolls we're GNA see if we
[01:02:48] can get
[01:02:50] you high enough strength to beat the
[01:02:53] boss here we're going to go with one oh

[01:02:56] one and a four a one and a four all
[01:02:59] right four is not four is tolerable you

[01:03:04] four so if you beat one of these bosses

[01:03:09] wastelanders so which one do you want to

[01:19:53] here throw that
[01:19:56] out say a little thank you for hanging
[01:19:58] out with
[01:19:59] us all right then we'll throw out we
[01:20:03] know we did get a floor on them let's do
[01:20:06] one of our our POG you know what let's
[01:20:08] do a pogman battle let's do a quick one
[01:20:11] let's do a quick game here all right
[01:20:13] let's see if anybody wants to do one of
[01:20:14] the quick games to go against the boss
[01:20:17] we'll throw it out with some
[01:20:20] Thunder
[01:20:21] and I'm G to put out an ioria
[01:20:25] collector
[01:20:26] booster from
[01:20:29] Japan Japanese icori collector booster a
[01:20:32] thunder Junction that's what we're going
[01:20:33] to put out right now pogman so this is
[01:20:36] my wife came up with this one I'm gonna
[01:20:38] pin it right here and you'll see it I'm
[01:20:40] GNA pin it right now this is not the
[01:20:41] price I have to adjust the price but you
[01:20:43] can read the rules there what it is is
[01:20:45] pretty much you buy these and you get
[01:20:47] two slam attempts I try to get seven
[01:20:50] over here and if you get seven you go up
[01:20:52] against a boss with seven strength and
[01:20:54] if you beat the boss we do a $1 Loot
[01:20:56] drop because I cannot give stuff away to
[01:20:57] people anymore due to the rules on
[01:20:59] whatnot so you get a $1 Loot drop for
[01:21:01] the Wasteland which is a pack of cards I
[01:21:03] put out for a dollar and you always get
[01:21:04] one of our vault packs up there to say
[01:21:06] thank you whenever you play one of our
[01:21:07] games like that so I'm gonna put this on
[01:21:10] here for you if anybody wants it and let
[01:21:14] me
[01:21:16] know and put that up for this and run
[01:21:19] it for this if you want to try your luck
[01:21:25] on
[01:21:27] that then we try to get our luck in see
[01:21:29] if we can get I've been doing pretty
[01:21:30] good I have to get some practice in so I
[01:21:32] might need do a couple I might do like
[01:21:33] if it doesn't go well I might count
[01:21:35] those as practice ones but uh but I've
[01:21:38] been uh doing pretty decent recently
[01:21:40] this is my wife's idea you know she saw
[01:21:42] we pulled a Pog out of one of our packs
[01:21:44] of cards these Vault packs uh like a
[01:21:46] while ago and she's like you need
[01:21:50] more so we got more now
[01:21:55] this is what you get arm melon you're
[01:21:57] going to get these two which is an ioria
[01:22:00] Japanese and a thunder Junction which is
[01:22:02] actually the first one I'm gonna be
[01:22:03] opening so that is pretty cool there
[01:22:06] then what we do here
[01:22:08] is you do this
[01:22:11] now or I do this now with the attempt to
[01:22:14] see if I can do what my wife says and
[01:22:16] get these flipped over for you so we
[01:22:18] going to move this out of the way over
[01:22:20] the corner give myself some good space
[01:22:23] there we go move that to the corner give
[01:22:25] myself some good space and let's see if
[01:22:27] we can do this for
[01:22:29] you there we go get a good straight
[01:22:31] stack I was yelled at it wasn't straight
[01:22:32] the other
[01:22:34] day ah look at that we got how many on
[01:22:37] this one we got
[01:22:40] one two three four five that's a good
[01:22:43] start you know what that's a good start
[01:22:45] my friend and you got one more slam got
[01:22:48] one more attempt let's see if we can get
[01:22:50] you another one two packs got two packs
[01:22:52] so two slam attempts so five he's got
[01:22:55] five he can get out to two more the
[01:22:57] highest you can get is seven so if we
[01:22:59] flip over five more the highest he gets
[01:23:01] is seven though ready three two one go
[01:23:06] oh no you said three two one go you
[01:23:10] don't you should have said anything I
[01:23:11] was doing good luck without you here
[01:23:12] talking and saying anything Ah that's
[01:23:15] okay you still have five five plus two
[01:23:18] is seven no five William five these are
[01:23:22] all that's here only these he gets two
[01:23:24] attempts so five all right here you go
[01:23:28] which boss you want to go up against
[01:23:29] it's one out of 10 here five is good
[01:23:32] five is good you can
[01:23:34] beat four of the bosses of the 10 bosses
[01:23:37] so not a bad one number 10 all right
[01:23:40] here we
[01:23:42] go there go hopefully he doesn't go
[01:23:45] anything bad we'll see which one boss
[01:23:46] you get one two three four five six
[01:23:50] seven eight nine
[01:23:53] 10 let's see the boss you go up against
[01:23:56] as you go wandering towards a vault you
[01:23:58] see in the distance to get a pack a boss

[01:44:52] don't get a floor and then I'm going to
[01:44:53] throw something extra in because that
[01:44:55] was a mistake there on my end where
[01:44:58] something wasn't written down and I did
[01:44:59] not pay attention do not do anything
[01:45:02] William I will do it please thank you
[01:45:05] and because of that I'm gonna give you
[01:45:06] this on top of it all right I don't know
[01:45:10] what happened there I do know this the

[01:45:23] forgot to put the sticker on it when he
[01:45:25] put before he put it in the box so we
[01:45:27] have lost Caverns you're going to get a

[03:07:51] a lot of people that are in the military
[03:07:52] that like getting those and opening them
[03:07:54] around like either their commanders or
[03:07:56] stuff like that so that's why I was
[03:07:58] wondering a lot of people I like to
[03:07:59] offer those ones to ship out but you got
[03:08:01] yourself a nice POG your Slammer you're
[03:08:04] gonna have to let me know how you do
[03:08:06] here
[03:08:07] Amell M Melo a AR Melo AR
[03:08:13] Melo AR melon I know it's not mellow I
[03:08:16] keep saying mellow but
[03:08:18] R
[03:08:21] melon you're stationed in Alaska oh wow
[03:08:24] dude that's up there that's up there
[03:08:28] what are you um what branch of the
[03:08:30] military if you don't mind me asking
[03:08:32] because I was uh if I didn't have I have
[03:08:35] some medical issues and I was unable to
[03:08:38] go in I wanted to go in the Air Force
[03:08:40] because I liked Stargate and I wanted to
[03:08:42] work with satellites and I figured if we
[03:08:44] ever talk to aliens the Air Force would
[03:08:45] probably be the first ones to talk to
[03:08:47] them
[03:08:49] so I wanted to do that but I got some
[03:08:52] medical issues and I had some
[03:08:53] unluckiness with that growing up had
[03:08:55] some seizures and then um developed some
[03:08:58] epilepsy which actually ended up not
[03:09:00] being epilepsy it ended up being uh
[03:09:02] blood that was leaking in me and they
[03:09:04] found it and fixed it but I had been
[03:09:06] going on for decades and been ignored so
[03:09:08] uh I wasn't able to do the things that I
[03:09:10] always wanted to but that's
[03:09:15] okay Air Force talking first right hey I
[03:09:18] wanted to do I know I wanted to do um
[03:09:20] like a like uh satellites I wanted to
[03:09:22] work with satellites personally and I
[03:09:24] figured that was the easiest way to get
[03:09:25] in working with satellites and that's
[03:09:27] actually kind of why I wanted to do it I
[03:09:29] want to work with space stuff and I
[03:09:31] figured at Le the Air Force maybe I
[03:09:33] could fly a plane and get into doing uh
[03:09:35] the N get into NASA is kind of what I
[03:09:37] was thinking but the medical issues C
[03:09:40] stopped me from doing that but I did get
[03:09:42] to work with NASA in one of my jobs I
[03:09:44] actually used to get to work with NASA
[03:09:45] on a regular basis in one of my jobs
[03:09:48] um what that that company got bought out
[03:09:50] and they did I didn't I couldn't handle
[03:09:52] them I ended up leaving the
[03:09:56] dude you love to hate thank you for
[03:10:00] coming in you got the little Gibby
[03:10:04] there yeah sometime hey sometimes things
[03:10:07] work out in a ways I guess but yeah I
[03:10:09] ended up iend instead of flying with
[03:10:11] them you know doing that thing I ended
[03:10:12] up working with him a little bit I can't
[03:10:13] ever say what I did but it was one of
[03:10:15] those uh I was an my it person so I did
[03:10:17] it stuff with
[03:10:19] them I actually one of the cool things I
[03:10:21] can say I did that they I was allowed to
[03:10:23] talk about I actually worked with the
[03:10:25] JPL um and I helped them uh fix their
[03:10:27] servers one time when they were having
[03:10:29] they were crashing for like a couple
[03:10:30] months and they couldn't figure out what
[03:10:31] was going on I fixed their servers to uh
[03:10:34] get them up and running so they could
[03:10:35] get the uh Marg Rover 2020 on on uh back
[03:10:38] on
[03:10:39] track so I can say I did
[03:10:45] that dude you love dat that's a long
[03:10:49] name I actually actually worked with uh
[03:10:51] sir the uh Large Hadron Collider a few
[03:10:54] times
[03:10:56] too yeah I actually I used to work with
[03:10:58] a Large Hadron Collider too I was I was
[03:11:00] one of the people that was um because I
[03:11:02] was in the US um certain things needed
[03:11:05] us or American people or us people to
[03:11:07] work on their stuff and because of that
[03:11:09] I was always called by um like NASA and
[03:11:12] Military stuff because I did a really
[03:11:13] good job on everything I did I actually
[03:11:16] had um
[03:11:18] I actually had some interesting
[03:11:19] scenarios happen after because uh when I
[03:11:22] left that job but I can't talk about
[03:11:25] those scenarios I'll get in
[03:11:30] trouble but anyways here we go dude

[03:11:47] can say I work with some cool things

[04:19:48] packs no one wants to do those battle
[04:19:51] all
[04:19:52] right all right let's see then maybe we
[04:19:55] do
[04:19:56] um maybe we do some of our this all
[04:20:01] right maybe we do a little bit of this
[04:20:03] right
[04:20:07] now changing it
[04:20:10] up and from packs
[04:20:13] we'll do some of this
[04:20:16] here all
[04:20:22] right one two three we're going to do a
[04:20:26] little high
[04:20:28] low that's what we're going to do we're
[04:20:30] going to do a little high
[04:20:32] low we're going to start
[04:20:40] with going to start with these here
[04:20:45] all right high
[04:20:48] low on the bottom of each one of these
[04:20:50] Legos it says an H or an L for high and
[04:20:54] low
[04:20:56] okay you pick those and we roll or
[04:20:59] dice to see how many rolls you get to go
[04:21:01] against the boss and if you happen to
[04:21:02] beat the boss you be the one that's
[04:21:04] strong enough to come out of the end and
[04:21:06] beat it you get a $1 Loot drop for
[04:21:08] everybody in the Wasteland so with our
[04:21:09] high low this is going to start at $1
[04:21:11] here for all of you that want to jump
[04:21:13] into this and I G to do that $1 and
[04:21:17] we're going to start this at 20 seconds
[04:21:18] in $1 here let's
[04:21:21] go and then we roll you want any of
[04:21:23] these we have a razor Verge Thicket we
[04:21:27] have a souls magesty and a scholar of
[04:21:30] New
[04:21:32] Horizons now they are a dollar and then
[04:21:35] you get to also uh do the roll and we
[04:21:37] get the ball pack too always get one of
[04:21:39] those saying thank
[04:21:40] you all right we did want these so I
[04:21:44] will put those
[04:21:45] back
[04:21:47] and I think uh let's see here
[04:21:51] 235 those are in that order like that
[04:21:54] let's try uh we'll try another one
[04:21:57] then we'll try another one
[04:22:00] here we'll do
[04:22:07] this we'll do this okay these three are
[04:22:12] going to go go up for it here we're
[04:22:15] going to do Cosmos
[04:22:17] Elixir
[04:22:20] explore
[04:22:23] or Viper sth the Viper Fang for our high
[04:22:30] low there you go high low on those ones
[04:22:35] there if you can see them hopefully you
[04:22:37] can I think I had to adjust the lighting
[04:22:38] a little bit there we go um
[04:22:42] there there $1 for any of those then we
[04:22:46] get to do the game you doose high low
[04:22:48] and we see what
[04:22:59] happens put those
[04:23:05] back and we'll see what else we do
[04:23:09] next is there anything you're looking
[04:23:11] for specifically I know I don't have
[04:23:12] thunder Junction which is kind of
[04:23:14] screwing me a little bit here because I
[04:23:16] know a lot of you are looking for
[04:23:21] it but I uh I can only do what I get in
[04:23:24] here which is part of the reason why I'm
[04:23:25] want looking to do my own store I what
[04:23:28] do you think should I start my own store
[04:23:30] what do you
[04:23:31] think that way I can get stuff better
[04:23:33] for you
[04:23:36] all let's do this one
[04:23:39] here all right going to put these out
[04:23:43] you have Coppa Luca copper
[04:23:47] coat Preston Garvey or a Ren's
[04:23:54] resolve all
[04:23:57] right Ren's
[04:24:00] resolve we're going to start the high
[04:24:04] low there you go high low if you want it
[04:24:07] see if you want to try your luck on any
[04:24:09] of that
[04:24:19] if you want it that is we're having some
[04:24:21] good fun we were earlier slowing down a
[04:24:23] little bit to uh seeing if you guys want
[04:24:24] to do your own stuff now we got some new
[04:24:26] people coming in and hanging out maybe
[04:24:28] you guys will uh find something
[04:24:30] intriguing we have a bunch of different
[04:24:31] games we got going on we get did some
[04:24:34] giveaways and some fun stuff
[04:24:35] earlier we'll do some more too like we
[04:24:38] always
[04:24:40] do no one wanted to do any of these on
[04:24:42] all right so we'll put those ones away
[04:24:45] too well I don't know what we should be
[04:24:48] doing right now it's a slower part of
[04:24:51] the day high low game so it's very
[04:24:54] simple very very simple is uh high low
[04:24:58] is just on the bottom of these Legos
[04:25:01] here there is H or L there are only
[04:25:04] three of them that are ever in play but
[04:25:06] what you do is you decide whether it
[04:25:08] says high or low and I was trying to do
[04:25:10] before the go the point was that that I
[04:25:12] was going to and I was trying to figure
[04:25:13] out a way of doing it like kind of like
[04:25:14] uh we do with um prices right where you
[04:25:17] have the higher or lower than the cost
[04:25:19] of something but I haven't been able to
[04:25:20] figure out an effective way of doing
[04:25:22] that so the only way I was doing it was
[04:25:24] you pick out one of your cards we run
[04:25:27] this for a dollar you pick out a card
[04:25:30] all right and whichever one you want you
[04:25:32] take for a dollar maybe you want one
[04:25:34] maybe somebody else bids and they want
[04:25:35] something else but whatever it is the
[04:25:37] point is you take it home and on the
[04:25:38] bottom of these you say whether they're
[04:25:39] high or low if you get them right you
[04:25:42] get to roll the dice which is the amount
[04:25:45] of strength you have to go up against
[04:25:47] one of the 10 bosses if you beat a 10
[04:25:49] boss sadly I am no longer able to give
[04:25:52] away a pack of cards I have to do it as
[04:25:53] a Loot drop but I do it as a $1 Loot
[04:25:56] drop for the everybody in the Wasteland
[04:25:58] that's a h higho game that's really what
[04:26:00] it is you get a card we play a little
[04:26:03] extra game here to see if we do a Loot
[04:26:05] drop for the wastelanders which this is
[04:26:07] a
[04:26:08] $1 pack of cards that I put down a pack
[04:26:11] of cards I put down for for
[04:26:13] $1 so that's how that high low kind of
[04:26:16] works here and I'm going to put out
[04:26:18] another group of singles
[04:26:20] here like I start them at a dollar
[04:26:23] sometimes or sometimes I might start a
[04:26:24] little higher if you want to go with
[04:26:26] like some type of different cards so say
[04:26:28] for instance you didn't want to go with
[04:26:30] like dollar ones you wanted to step up a
[04:26:31] little and do something different say
[04:26:34] you wanted to go with
[04:26:44] something like
[04:26:48] this maybe you're a dror who
[04:26:53] fan all right maybe you're a doctor who
[04:27:00] fan okay we put those
[04:27:03] out you're going to go with either cyber
[04:27:09] ship cyber controller
[04:27:12] or Seaside
[04:27:17] Citadel all right and then these are not
[04:27:21] going to start for a dollar I did not do
[04:27:23] these ones I'll start these ones at
[04:27:24] three
[04:27:25] though for those that may want it and
[04:27:27] you get one of these for
[04:27:29] $3 and then you pick what's on the
[04:27:32] bottom of them and we roll the dice to
[04:27:33] see if we can get hopefully six strength
[04:27:37] to be able to go up against the boss in
[04:27:38] the Wasteland
[04:27:41] here but that is our game if you want to
[04:27:44] play
[04:27:46] it you're really just buying card in uh
[04:27:50] the chance of doing something extra
[04:27:52] where there could be a dollar a dollar
[04:27:54] pack uh for the Wasteland that's really
[04:27:56] what it
[04:27:57] is no one wanted that has anybody here
[04:28:00] been watching that Fallout show I know
[04:28:02] we were talking about it earlier so I
[04:28:04] didn't know if any else has been
[04:28:05] watching it because we are big fans of
[04:28:07] Fallout and that stuff here so that's
[04:28:08] why I was asking
[04:28:18] okay we do that that and that so we'll
[04:28:21] put uh maybe we do
[04:28:24] these maybe we do
[04:28:27] this all right something like this
[04:28:30] you're interested in for
[04:28:34] it and instead of high
[04:28:38] low we're going to do this
[04:28:40] instead we're going to do
[04:28:42] The Showdown the singles Showdown all
[04:28:46] right this is what will came up with for
[04:28:48] an idea the singles Showdown so we're
[04:28:51] going to go with these three p cards all
[04:28:55] right you're going to get
[04:28:58] yourself
[04:29:04] Dr Timber
[04:29:09] protector and
[04:29:12] sergeo Rivendell all right
[04:29:17] or
[04:29:19] or actually we're gonna do that we're
[04:29:21] gonna do it like this actually we're
[04:29:22] gonna do this I don't even need those
[04:29:24] there we're gonna do this
[04:29:27] this these
[04:29:29] cards these three cards
[04:29:33] or or where is
[04:29:36] it
[04:29:39] or a mystery booster
[04:29:43] all
[04:29:45] right this is what William called The
[04:29:51] Showdown those three cards or a mystery
[04:29:55] booster which one do you want in The
[04:30:02] Showdown let us know this is our little
[04:30:05] single Showdown you pick the singles or
[04:30:08] the pack what is better so far we've had
[04:30:12] three singles I mean two singles and
[04:30:14] three packs so it's almost even and
[04:30:16] depending on what happens here I don't
[04:30:29] know all right no one like these so
[04:30:32] we'll put those back
[04:30:34] then we'll try um I don't know maybe
[04:30:36] we'll try something different we are
[04:30:38] going a little bit slow here all of a
[04:30:39] sudden and I'm going to actually do
[04:30:42] something quickly here because I am kind
[04:30:43] of freezing even it's probably the uh
[04:30:46] the days going on because all the people
[04:30:48] in the uh the whatnot con stuff was
[04:30:50] pulling it away now that it's middle of

[00:53:05] number 27 is this one right here you've
[00:53:07] got yourself zoa lava tongue it was not
[00:53:12] one that
[00:53:13] says the play Booster Box on it so that
[00:53:16] means you get one of those play boosters
[00:53:17] that I showed you and
[00:53:19] also you are going to encounter I have
[00:53:22] to pull one of these out randomly
[00:53:23] because we don't have stickers on them
[00:53:24] all yet but get I them in a box here we
[00:53:28] just going to shuffle them up here
[00:53:29] you're going to
[00:53:30] counter we look off to the side we don't
[00:53:32] want to see
[00:53:35] it oh you get a oh not too bad you have
[00:53:38] a small Raider that you're going to be
[00:53:40] encountering as you go wanding in this
[00:53:42] Wasteland Vault my
[00:53:44] friend now the only thing is you have
[00:53:48] only a wrench right now my
[00:53:51] friend my ABI so if you want to get
[00:53:55] something else you can try to to go
[00:53:56] after a weapon or something like that by
[00:53:59] grabbing oh no wrong thing don't touch
[00:54:01] that don't touch that wrong price that
[00:54:03] should not be that price but you need to
[00:54:04] re let me know what what pack you want
[00:54:06] too I gave you an option of a bunch of
[00:54:07] them hopefully you heard that I did see
[00:54:09] you jump back in here so I I just want
[00:54:11] to make sure you did here you have an
[00:54:13] option of any of those packs that I
[00:54:14] showed you there Kami gawa I like it all
[00:54:17] right now what did you come
[00:54:23] me that one this
[00:54:26] [Music]
[00:54:28] I think that one's on
[00:54:30] top I should probably adjust those
[00:54:33] because I don't think there's much more
[00:54:34] of the other ones in there all right
[00:54:37] there's your commi one okay and then if
[00:54:40] you want some weapons like I said I was
[00:54:41] just running the weapon thing if you
[00:54:43] like that but either way what you have
[00:54:44] to do now is you're going to go up
[00:54:45] against this small Raider are we going
[00:54:47] to open up this path for you or do you
[00:54:49] want to wait until open it up at the end
[00:54:51] cu the small Raider is
[00:54:53] 15 okay the small Raider is 15 that
[00:54:55] means you need to roll 15 or
[00:54:57] higher if you're going to be able to uh
[00:55:00] beat that small Raider now do you think
[00:55:03] you can roll a 15 or higher that you can
[00:55:06] hit them with a uh hit them with the
[00:55:07] wrench knock them unconscious or do you
[00:55:09] want to like I said or you can try for a
[00:55:11] weapon or or a uh or a buff of some kind
[00:55:15] too but if you beat the Raider with the
[00:55:18] wet wrench and you're lucky enough to
[00:55:19] get past him you know what happens you
[00:55:21] can pick up maybe their weapon maybe
[00:55:23] you'll get their weapon and some ammo I
[00:55:24] don't know one 1 two three four five six

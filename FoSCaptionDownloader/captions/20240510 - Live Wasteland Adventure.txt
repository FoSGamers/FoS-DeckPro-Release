[00:04:51] I still have a headache and no matter
[00:04:52] what every every bit of sound
[00:04:56] hurts maybe you guys would like some
[00:04:59] Wilds of

[00:05:04] can bid up to what you
[00:05:07] want well we'll see
[00:05:10] here let's see here we'll put those ones
[00:05:14] out for
[00:05:17] you see if you want
[00:05:20] that and then I will do that next
[00:05:23] remember our our game here we did uh
[00:05:25] adjust or upgrade whatever you call like
[00:05:27] to call it the uh
[00:05:30] the live Adventure because the bosses
[00:05:31] you actually have a better chance of
[00:05:32] eating the bosses now we adjusted who
[00:05:34] some of the bosses are put a few more in
[00:05:36] there and if you like the way that this
[00:05:37] game it the version of it we'll keep it
[00:05:39] and I'll I'll update and add some of the
[00:05:41] characters for animations but if you
[00:05:42] don't I figure I just want to try to see
[00:05:44] if people like it if not I don't want to
[00:05:45] waste my time you

[00:13:13] anyways
[00:13:18] hey throw those out
[00:13:25] there that's if you want it there GNA
[00:13:29] give us a little bit longer than normal
[00:13:31] and I'm GNA open up a little pack we got
[00:13:34] a little box package we got from a
[00:13:36] friend
[00:13:37] here let's see what you got in here all
[00:13:40] right can't remember what it is I always
[00:13:43] forget so I never get luck so I always
[00:13:45] forget what it
[00:13:47] is I might have actually gotten
[00:13:49] something nice this time I
[00:13:51] think well I got a grand abolisher so I
[00:13:54] did actually get something
[00:14:00] yet to get any of the uh the cards my
[00:14:02] wife wants though still been having a
[00:14:05] really hard time finding any of the uh
[00:14:07] the cards my wife's been looking
[00:14:09] for somebody's been asking for that
[00:14:15] OKO there you
[00:14:17] go my little H pack of cards that I got
[00:14:20] there recently not too
[00:14:22] bad no I'm sadly I do not have any
[00:14:24] Fallout left as
[00:14:27] uh that was all per
[00:14:29] and I don't want to buy it at like I
[00:14:31] don't know
[00:14:32] $300 a a uh pack I what is at now it's
[00:14:38] not 300 a pack it's like I think they're
[00:14:41] at uh it's like like 500 a box almost
[00:14:44] now so I don't think uh for me
[00:14:46] personally and actually to have on the
[00:14:47] show that is not worth it for me I don't
[00:14:50] know maybe at some point they may drop
[00:14:52] and if they do maybe I'll jump in on a
[00:14:53] few of them but right now
[00:14:57] n yeah I know good this decision on that
[00:15:01] one it's like well how much are they
[00:15:03] just a
[00:15:05] lot but yeah I got some good luck on the
[00:15:07] uh the packs there I didn't realize I
[00:15:10] forgot I got those in
[00:15:12] that thought I had a little bit of good
[00:15:14] luck that
[00:15:15] day we'll throw out why not we'll just
[00:15:18] throw out a time
[00:15:20] spiral maybe you just want a Time spiral

[00:16:03] 5:00
[00:16:04] a.m. so I haven't slept at all
[00:16:11] today three hours strong no coffee
[00:16:14] woo I actually don't drink
[00:16:17] coffee I haven't drank coffee in many
[00:16:20] years I was told a long time well I
[00:16:23] don't caffeine very rarely I drink and
[00:16:24] put it that way I I drink coffee
[00:16:26] sometimes but not regularly like when I
[00:16:28] was uh uh probably once any once every
[00:16:32] couple months I'll drink coffee or some
[00:16:34] caffeinated stuff but for a while I was
[00:16:38] uh didn't use any of it at all because
[00:16:40] one of the doctors I was had talked to
[00:16:42] said it would not help the seizures I
[00:16:43] have so figure stay away from it
[00:16:47] remember everybody you can jump in
[00:16:49] purchase whatever you want here my

[00:17:43] know what you're talking about that I
[00:17:44] had I uh I don't know what like I
[00:17:45] literally cut stopped cold turkey
[00:17:47] because the doctor said it would help
[00:17:48] with seizures or what I was having which
[00:17:50] it didn't help with because the seizures
[00:17:51] I was having they ended up finding out
[00:17:53] years later was because of anemia and my
[00:17:55] blood level is dropping so low that my
[00:17:57] oxygen my brain left auction by my brain
[00:18:00] to my brain was causing them but
[00:18:04] anyways I digress long long sory not
[00:18:07] this thing let's throw out some you know
[00:18:10] what why not throw this
[00:18:14] out if you want
[00:18:21] it who that out if you want

[00:18:48] character
[00:18:50] nice I that's
[00:18:57] interesting yeah I had him since I was
[00:18:59] uh I started having weird things when I
[00:19:01] was younger in high school nobody really
[00:19:02] knew what they were uh but um I in
[00:19:06] college I started having more then out
[00:19:08] of college I started having like weird
[00:19:10] Grand Mall ones and then they yeah
[00:19:13] sometimes the right medicine sometimes
[00:19:14] the right doctor I had doctors ignore
[00:19:17] all of the uh symptoms that I had
[00:19:19] provided them for
[00:19:20] years and then I came down to Florida
[00:19:23] and I didn't tell anybody like that I
[00:19:25] had seizures or whatever it was going on
[00:19:27] because it didn't really matter when one
[00:19:30] of the doctors I was dealing with went
[00:19:31] about some medical issues and they um I
[00:19:34] was having a hard time breathing and
[00:19:35] they did some tests like you need to go
[00:19:37] hospital and then that's when they found
[00:19:39] out I had a a blood a bleed that was
[00:19:43] causing uh most of my
[00:19:47] problems that was all ignored when I was
[00:19:50] up uh New England for I know about two
[00:19:54] to three years actually got to the point
[00:19:56] where I was um they told me all my
[00:19:59] organs were stopping I almost
[00:20:03] died weirdest thing in the world just
[00:20:06] because people didn't want to
[00:20:08] listen try those three out if you'd

[00:20:21] Wasteland you are at plus six on your
[00:20:23] character strengths that means you have
[00:20:24] a good chance of
[00:20:25] uh getting something
[00:20:29] that occurs here will SmackDown on a
[00:20:33] boss since there are a good amount of
[00:20:35] bosses in there now you can

[00:41:58] my words or something I do apologize
[00:42:01] I've actually slept probably like you
[00:42:02] know five hours and two
[00:42:06] days
[00:42:08] Lee Dickens how's how are you doing

[00:42:46] inability to sleep you know [ __ ] happens
[00:42:48] right
[00:42:50] life becomes a headache and sometimes
[00:42:53] you need to tolerate it now remember
[00:42:55] everybody the reason why I had those
[00:42:56] packs up there is because if you check
[00:42:57] our um Adventure game we have those that
[00:42:59] you can play that's a really fun
[00:43:01] adventure game a lot of people like
[00:43:04] it and it's an animated one we have an
[00:43:06] animated and a non-animated one animated
[00:43:08] one so that's even
[00:43:14] cooler because I have a quick version
[00:43:16] which is like an animated one then we
[00:43:19] have a uh we have a longer version which
[00:43:21] not too many people have jumped in
[00:43:23] recently here we ended it on um on
[00:43:25] YouTube though the first version version
[00:43:27] of it you guys have the second version a

[00:43:33] mean our little giveway we have a family

[00:43:41] uh something on the back is a foil from
[00:43:44] whatever the children picked out to put

[00:44:47] the pricing I feel like it's a
[00:44:50] uh rather good way to handle
[00:44:54] this what do you think am Superfly am I
[00:44:58] uh being ridiculous in the way I'm
[00:45:00] handling that should I not do it would
[00:45:04] the pricing like that is it annoying
[00:45:07] maybe that's what it is is it annoying
[00:45:08] is it frustrating too much stuff there I
[00:45:10] don't know I thought it was good though
[00:45:12] because you get to see the price of what
[00:45:15] everything
[00:45:18] is yeah you get to see what the price is
[00:45:20] I personally I like it because you don't
[00:45:23] have to question what you're getting on
[00:45:24] a price of something you just know it's
[00:45:26] there and you know what the price is if
[00:45:28] you want it you're not going to feel
[00:45:30] like you're getting screwed because
[00:45:31] somebody's trying to overcharge you you
[00:45:33] know what I mean and that's why I like

[01:33:52] amount of checkins going I like it I
[01:33:55] like
[01:33:57] it all right let's see nobody wanted the
[01:34:00] Talisman oh I got another one
[01:34:03] here here you
[01:34:16] go hey that's
[01:34:19] funny yeah I had some headaches I I used
[01:34:21] to do some pretty cool games where you
[01:34:23] actually everybody came out with
[01:34:25] something good and they never actually
[01:34:27] came out missing losing anything um they
[01:34:30] actually came out with their packs or
[01:34:32] something extra people complained and
[01:34:34] yeah that's where uh that's where I was
[01:34:45] at I know it does suck like I had
[01:34:48] something where I had um I had so the
[01:34:51] reason I had gotten suspended because
[01:34:54] they said I did not put the ceiling the
[01:34:56] floor and the average on a game well it
[01:35:01] wasn't one game it was requested that I
[01:35:03] do a bundle of two of them um so I did
[01:35:06] the bundle of two of them and all the
[01:35:08] requested stuff was all on the game and
[01:35:10] even in my show notes and stuff like
[01:35:12] that
[01:35:14] but that was not I guess acceptable for
[01:35:17] them I guess I needed to put it in with
[01:35:19] the combination of the bundle so when
[01:35:20] the two of them were put together I was
[01:35:22] supposed to do some [ __ ] math to
[01:35:24] figure out what the high low cealing and
[01:35:25] average was for
[01:35:27] everyone um when there was a bundle of
[01:35:30] things put items put together and that's
[01:35:32] where I was like I can't do this anymore
[01:35:34] because I can't trust that somebody's
[01:35:35] gonna find something ridiculous to try
[01:35:37] to screw
[01:35:40] me yeah pretty insane
[01:35:47] huh hey 't no thanks coming in and

[01:52:13] just I'm not trying to ignore you I
[01:52:15] looked at some of it I did put something
[01:52:16] to the side I just uh long story short I
[01:52:21] almost sent the resignation letter in on
[01:52:24] Thursday um so that's the [ __ ] that I've
[01:52:26] been dealing with because one person has
[01:52:28] been making my life a living
[01:52:35] hell but I took a few days off because I
[01:52:37] needed some
[01:52:39] time to not hate everything and uh do
[01:52:44] some cleaning up of our house to get

[01:52:54] care of and a couple the other things I
[01:52:55] needed to get taken care of for the

[01:53:08] business and if you want of these
[01:53:10] singles just jump on in them say you
[01:53:12] want it
[01:53:14] ohare
[01:53:16] caslin nice O'Hare casum right there for
[01:53:19] you
[01:53:25] yeah yeah I I literally almost end in a
[01:53:28] resonation it wasn't I actually like
[01:53:30] where I work uh most of the people I
[01:53:32] work with I just don't like one person
[01:53:34] and they happen to be my new manager
[01:53:36] that has been there for I've been there
[01:53:37] for over three years and the manager was
[01:53:39] given switched because there was layoffs
[01:53:41] and I got a new manager four months ago
[01:53:43] and it's just been
[01:53:45] hell absolute
[01:53:47] hell put it this way arer I actually
[01:53:52] have been and I need to
[01:53:56] um give my new manager what I do on a
[01:54:00] daily basis in one hour
[01:54:02] increments that's what he's requiring of
[01:54:04] me
[01:54:07] now I've never had a manager in
[01:54:10] my 30 plus years of working ask anything
[01:54:14] like that he wants me to literally do 7
[01:54:16] AM 8:00 a.m. 9:00 a.m. 10:00
[01:54:19] a.m. all the way down to the hour
[01:54:23] and then he actually at one point almost
[01:54:25] he wants it even further down because
[01:54:27] sometimes he'll ask even questions down
[01:54:29] to like more like to the half hour
[01:54:31] within that hour and I have to explain
[01:54:33] that oh I actually um I um I actually
[01:54:37] have talked to my interestingly enough I
[01:54:40] don't think he realizes that I already
[01:54:42] had talked to the director and my um my
[01:54:45] two directors one of them that i' been
[01:54:47] rather friendly with because he actually
[01:54:49] bought a per house in the area and we
[01:54:51] talk about like you know
[01:54:52] Rockets going off and stuff like that
[01:54:54] I've always been very friendly very
[01:54:56] respectful with him and I've always had
[01:54:58] very good rapport with him and hard work
[01:54:59] and I'd already asked him like how to
[01:55:01] work with someone this person and he
[01:55:03] kind of gave me some tips I've done my
[01:55:05] best um that was like in February so
[01:55:09] even in February I was like I was
[01:55:10] already having issues and now it's
[01:55:12] gotten to the point where I'm like I'm
[01:55:13] just being bullied by somebody and I
[01:55:15] told I actually had open an HR report
[01:55:17] because I like he talked to me in a skip
[01:55:19] level he's like hey heard something
[01:55:20] going on and I told him you know I
[01:55:23] pretty much like I feel like I'm being
[01:55:24] bullied every day he he's now gotten me
[01:55:26] to the point I give him an answer then
[01:55:28] he asks for he responds with well what
[01:55:30] about from like three weeks ago I'm like
[01:55:32] I don't know what happened three weeks
[01:55:33] ago like I can give you this information
[01:55:35] and I give him he's like well that's not
[01:55:36] specific enough I'm like it's three
[01:55:38] weeks ago that was six weeks ago like
[01:55:40] you got to give me some time to figure
[01:55:41] it out no that never happens never get
[01:55:45] time to figure it out and then it's
[01:55:46] always because I didn't give
[01:55:48] specifics thank you that was a nice one
[01:55:50] there that vow
[01:55:53] so that's why that's what it comes down
[01:55:55] to that's why I've been uh doing what
[01:55:58] I've been
[01:56:00] doing like this is
[01:56:03] ridiculous like I even said to him like
[01:56:05] if you want I'll record my
[01:56:09] day I'll record my day you can
[01:56:12] participate and come with it if you
[01:56:17] want like I'll record my day and you or
[01:56:20] you could even come and participate in
[01:56:21] it if you would like
[01:56:23] whichever one you want to do wrong
[01:56:30] one there we go Avatar nice one there
[01:56:34] and I'm GNA throw this one out next
[01:56:39] here there you go Avatar thank you very
[01:56:42] much just a little just say thank you
[01:56:43] for hanging out with us let's see what's
[01:56:45] on the back of this one that they gave
[01:56:46] you the foil is an invasion of Marda
[01:56:49] Manda not bad a little invasion of Ganda
[01:56:52] for your foil on the back is what they
[01:56:55] found hey Avatar hey you know what's
[01:56:57] interesting like my wife is sadly too so
[01:57:01] long story short with that is she was
[01:57:02] very happy with something that she had
[01:57:04] in a similar situation somebody took
[01:57:05] over and
[01:57:06] changed and um because of the her
[01:57:11] change she doesn't want she doesn't like
[01:57:14] what she's her job anymore it's not that
[01:57:17] she doesn't like her job she doesn't
[01:57:18] like where she's working in the people
[01:57:20] and she's having a headache already with
[01:57:22] it
[01:57:22] and she actually after the change for
[01:57:25] that she actually goes you know what
[01:57:26] let's go and live on the boat and travel
[01:57:27] like you said and I was like [ __ ] yeah
[01:57:29] so at least that was one bonus that came
[01:57:31] out of that I don't
[01:57:35] know let's see what else we have here
[01:57:37] for our giveaways that their kids are
[01:57:38] giving
[01:57:43] you this is a there tromping kabo that's
[01:57:47] our thing in the back there it's our
[01:57:49] giveaway card in the back there
[01:57:54] you know you just got to and deal with
[01:57:55] it so we've made some decisions to
[01:57:56] change our lives and focus on ourselves
[01:57:58] versus our
[01:58:01] jobs see the person I've been dealing
[01:58:04] with it's um they are um I think they
[01:58:07] keep trying to catch it's like they keep
[01:58:08] trying to catch me in a trap they keep
[01:58:10] trying to trap me in some way and every
[01:58:11] time they do I have evidence to prove
[01:58:14] that whatever I did and they don't like
[01:58:16] it and every time it's like they try to
[01:58:18] give me something to make me fail I
[01:58:21] don't and I do better at it or I do well
[01:58:22] at it and it's like pissing him off or
[01:58:25] something I don't
[01:58:30] know all right I'm gonna put this one
[01:58:31] back we got our giveaway out there and
[01:58:33] here we go a
[01:58:38] delete a delete for our onscreen
[01:58:43] [Music]
[01:58:48] single going throw that out there
[01:58:54] that's pretty funny that I'm describing
[01:58:55] your
[01:58:57] manager some people are just that way
[01:59:00] where they um yeah I don't know I don't
[01:59:01] know what to tell you that some people
[01:59:02] are they nice enough person out of work
[01:59:05] stuff and anything when it comes to not
[01:59:06] work I'm like I could I could like
[01:59:08] probably hang out with this person if
[01:59:09] nothing work rated ever occurred if I
[01:59:11] was somewhere and they were somewhere
[01:59:14] but work rated I just know not not
[01:59:20] me and that's what it is I've just uh
[01:59:23] I've come I've literally um I wouldn't
[01:59:24] have even taken the job if he was the
[01:59:26] manager that I was interviewing with
[01:59:28] that's that's like what I
[01:59:34] mean but you got some giveaways up in
[01:59:36] the background a little giveaway for the
[01:59:38] background there put that back you did
[01:59:39] not want that but we'll put this out
[01:59:41] maybe you want this
[01:59:42] instead just some people want uh you
[01:59:45] know they want their things their way
[01:59:46] remember everybody check in when you
[01:59:49] want to uh get a bigger giveaway at the
[01:59:52] end of stream now the problem is I have
[01:59:55] no problem with manager that's like that
[01:59:56] want specifics and micromanager but the
[01:59:58] issue is he never gives me a way to
[02:00:00] prove um I'm doing what he wants so I'm
[02:00:04] always failing so I'm like I'm like
[02:00:07] seriously like there's literally like
[02:00:08] what do you want me to do and I never
[02:00:10] get an answer of how to do it so I
[02:00:13] literally um try to do extra try to do
[02:00:16] more try to show something more try to C
[02:00:18] and it's never enough never enough so
[02:00:24] I ended up talking I actually had talked
[02:00:25] interestingly enough I had talked to my
[02:00:27] director before on oneon-one and said
[02:00:30] certain things happen and literally in
[02:00:32] the oneon-one those things happen and he
[02:00:34] sent an email to confirm it what I
[02:00:37] talked about and how they occur and how
[02:00:40] he even tries to manipulate
[02:00:41] things and uh yeah that was pretty
[02:00:50] funny why this not going
[02:00:53] right there you go smoldering Marsh
[02:00:56] that's what it's supposed to
[02:00:59] be manager has no people skills but I
[02:01:02] work for the government and benefits are
[02:01:04] just great yeah there you go exactly I
[02:01:06] work for a place that the benefits are
[02:01:07] really good and I and and I can work
[02:01:09] from
[02:01:11] home I G lowest performance store and
[02:01:13] over those three years incre uh yeah I
[02:01:16] understand that I've been with those
[02:01:17] managers I've been with those managers
[02:01:19] too I actually um I used to work uh I
[02:01:23] used to manage multiple Sprint stores at
[02:01:24] once all right and
[02:01:29] um I had
[02:01:32] um I had not a manager it was more like
[02:01:35] a director of everything very nice
[02:01:37] person but I just wouldn't uh workwise
[02:01:40] they were very kind of not a not a
[02:01:42] little sleazy in ways but uh they take
[02:01:45] ideas and take them off as their own
[02:01:46] well I started recognizing that and I
[02:01:49] would tell the owners of the company
[02:01:51] when they came in this store my ideas
[02:01:52] instead of telling like things and
[02:01:54] emails like we should do this or in
[02:01:55] meetings and the owner started talking
[02:01:57] to me more and coming over to me and
[02:01:59] getting more information and I got
[02:02:00] another
[02:02:01] store I did not I don't think that bowed
[02:02:04] well with that person and that's the
[02:02:06] type of people that that's the same type
[02:02:07] of person I feel like I'm running into
[02:02:10] now where it's because I'm doing
[02:02:13] something they don't want or every time
[02:02:14] they try to catch me in a lie they don't
[02:02:16] because I don't
[02:02:19] lie I tell them everything I do when
[02:02:22] 100%
[02:02:23] accurately I've never done anything
[02:02:25] different which is the weirdest thing in
[02:02:27] the world he is all of a sudden one
[02:02:29] person for whatever reason thinks that's
[02:02:31] going on and he's ruining my uh
[02:02:34] literally

[02:02:41] sucks that happens you know but hey we

[02:05:03] and he had returned to work and um they
[02:05:06] all have to return to the office and I
[02:05:08] don't and I wonder if that's part of the
[02:05:10] animosity he has is that I get to have a
[02:05:12] little bit more freedom and do things my
[02:05:14] wife thinks he's jealous of some of us
[02:05:16] some of the things I get to do which is
[02:05:19] kind of funny hey thank you go Josh
[02:05:21] thank you my friend
[02:05:23] Josh I don't know about that though she
[02:05:26] goes I need to take a look at
[02:05:28] him cuz I'll tell you right away what
[02:05:30] his problem is because if you told him
[02:05:32] about some of the things you know if
[02:05:33] he's talked to you about personal life
[02:05:35] and you've told him about some of the
[02:05:36] things you doing you're doing or some of
[02:05:37] your plans he might just be jealous and
[02:05:39] that's why he's giving you a hard time
[02:05:40] I'm like I don't know bosses aren't that
[02:05:41] way he's like I've run into Horrible
[02:05:43] Bosses she said Remember the one that we
[02:05:44] had to Sue I'm like oh crap yeah when
[02:05:47] she got she got fired she got laid off
[02:05:49] from her job when she came back from
[02:05:50] having a baby they changed her
[02:05:53] position um and took her pay low lowered
[02:05:57] her pay changed her position and then
[02:06:00] took the position away three months
[02:06:03] later um and said she needed to apply
[02:06:06] for a new one and that's the point she
[02:06:07] just left and said they're trying to
[02:06:08] they're getting rid of me they're
[02:06:09] forcing me out and we ended up having to
[02:06:11] go to court over that
[02:06:15] one that one they

[02:57:08] with the other one there the next one
[02:57:11] we're going to put up is a there and
[02:57:12] back
[02:57:14] again yes I can definitely explain how
[02:57:17] the adventure game works all right so
[02:57:20] how the adventure game works is you
[02:57:22] purchase a pack of
[02:57:24] cards or multiple packs of cards and if
[02:57:28] it's a basic one pack is just worth one
[02:57:30] strength for your character now if you
[02:57:33] buy for whatever say you get ones that
[02:57:35] has a plus one or plus two that's just
[02:57:37] you get the pack plus one strength or
[02:57:39] the pack plus two strength so say for
[02:57:41] instance you get a l of the Rings
[02:57:43] collector booster that would be three
[02:57:45] strength for your character in The
[02:57:46] Wasteland to start out with as you
[02:57:49] travel through and that will get you um
[02:57:53] the ability to when you go up against
[02:57:55] the boss a better chance of beating the
[02:57:57] boss at the end of the Wasteland
[02:57:59] Adventure because at the end of the
[02:58:00] Wasteland Adventure what you do is you
[02:58:02] pick your way through this set of cards
[02:58:05] in this box of cards here there's three
[02:58:07] things that you pick through that you
[02:58:08] give you either plus one or a minus one
[02:58:10] on your strength and then you fight one
[02:58:12] of the bosses which is one of these
[02:58:14] things here now it is an animated
[02:58:17] Adventure where you go through and you
[02:58:18] do different things as an animated
[02:58:20] character but at the end if you beat the
[02:58:23] boss we do a $1 Loop drop of a pack of
[02:58:25] some kind for everybody in the Wasteland
[02:58:27] and every single time though you always
[02:58:29] make it to the Vault where you pick out
[02:58:31] a vault pack which is one of those
[02:58:32] golden things over there you always get
[02:58:34] to a vault for safety at the
[02:58:38] end but that is how kind of a little
[02:58:40] quick rundown it's like a d andd
[02:58:42] Adventure a miniature D and D
[02:58:45] Adventure
[02:58:46] super thank you for getting you're uh
[02:58:48] getting a little there you are for a
[02:58:50] little giveaway
[02:58:55] there get you with your other
[02:58:59] stuff
[02:59:02] together so that we don't mistake you
[02:59:04] for anyone else if you have a question
[02:59:05] on it just let me know but yeah you can
[02:59:07] just say hey I'm gonna buy uh you can go
[02:59:09] the buy now and buy those packs and tell
[02:59:11] me I want to play the adventure game or
[02:59:13] you can say I want to play the adventure
[02:59:14] game I'll start it out at like say
[02:59:16] here's an example say you say I want to
[02:59:18] play the adventure game I go all right
[02:59:21] here's the adventure game we're going to
[02:59:23] start it at
[02:59:24] this it starts at
[02:59:26] seven you do a custom bid to whatever
[02:59:29] you want it to
[02:59:31] be and you get those amount of packs or
[02:59:34] what those packs are and then we pick
[02:59:36] our way through the adventure to see
[02:59:38] what happens so say we're now you say
[02:59:39] you know what I'm good I want an all
[02:59:41] laws of Thunder Junction you just bid to
[02:59:42] seven but say you wanted a Los Cavern
[02:59:44] exan collector booster you would do a
[02:59:47] custom bid to uh 34 or just slide your
[02:59:51] finger over a bunch until it hits
[02:59:53] 34 that's kind of how it goes that's how
[02:59:56] that Adventure one
[02:59:59] goes but here I'll throw up my singles

[03:00:18] it and endend up wanting to do it over
[03:00:20] and over and over
[03:00:21] again and the way I did it now too is I
[03:00:24] made it I actually upgraded it a little
[03:00:25] bit so that you get a better chance of
[03:00:27] beating the boss so you get a better
[03:00:29] chance of loot drops at the end of the
[03:00:31] Wasteland which is what everybody wants
[03:00:32] is a $1 Loot drop that way you get a

[03:17:34] the adventure you are a detective
[03:17:37] wandering through this Wasteland as you

[03:17:41] are looking for something that will give
[03:17:43] you some treasure because treasure helps

[03:17:50] I like that that detective goes over and
[03:17:53] starts munching away on that food num oh
[03:17:57] wonderful that tastes delicious but oh
[03:17:59] no he does not realize that food had rad
[03:18:02] poisoning in it full of RADS he is now
[03:18:04] rad poisoned he's gone from eight
[03:18:06] strength down to seven feeling a little
[03:18:08] queasy but because he's a detective he
[03:18:09] realizes what's going on he was already
[03:18:11] a little stronger than normal so he's
[03:18:13] not actually taking too much out he's
[03:18:14] seven strength he's still pretty good so
[03:18:16] we go we're going to go again we're
[03:18:17] going to grab a different one we're
[03:18:18] going to grab random and as you go
[03:18:20] wandering through this Wasteland though
[03:18:21] oh no see it's actually starting to get
[03:18:23] to you you get a little queasy you lean
[03:18:24] over you throw up and go wow actually
[03:18:26] maybe there's something wrong with that
[03:18:27] food all of a sudden in the distance you
[03:18:29] see something you go oh what is that
[03:18:30] it's a clue you're looking down in the
[03:18:33] ground you go
[03:18:35] interesting you find yourself a clue you
[03:18:38] pick that clue up and you go ah rataway

[03:18:52] strong big strong boss I mean a big
[03:18:55] strong detective going through this
[03:18:57] Wasteland now you're looking you hoping
[03:18:58] you find a friend it could be a friend
[03:19:00] we're not exactly sure what it is but
[03:19:02] you see something in the distance you go
[03:19:04] hey buddy because you're Bing strong
[03:19:06] you're not too worried about him you hey
[03:19:08] dude over here and that person comes out
[03:19:11] and that thing goes over and goes oh no
[03:19:13] it is not a dude coming it is a Thro
[03:19:15] that Thro
[03:19:17] comes and slashes down toward you
[03:19:21] chopping at you and slicing at the eye
[03:19:24] you now have a gash across the top of
[03:19:25] your head still not that bad big of a
[03:19:27] deal though because that only leaves you
[03:19:29] with seven strength even though you you
[03:19:32] you're seven strength is a lot though to
[03:19:33] go up against one of the bosses here so

[04:46:45] double check because I haven't opened
[04:46:47] much with slivers but uh dragons I do
[04:46:50] not have many of the Dragons because my
[04:46:52] son has a dragon deck and he actually
[04:46:54] takes almost all the dragons that we
[04:46:55] ever get so I'd have to go and look

[04:46:59] and use before I can do that because I
[04:47:01] just don't know about the dragons

[04:47:19] you don't I'm like yeah but that doesn't
[04:47:21] mean you just just get you just
[04:47:22] automatically get the card because it's
[04:47:24] a
[04:47:25] dragon maybe I want to use it in a
[04:47:28] deck yes I did run Hy Tyrant a bit ago I
[04:47:31] do have Helly Tyrant oh wait I have

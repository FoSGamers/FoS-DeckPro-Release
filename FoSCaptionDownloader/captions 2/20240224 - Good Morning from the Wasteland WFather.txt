[00:06:30] oh look there's a stripe down the middle
[00:06:34] I've decided that if I find one without
[00:06:36] a stripe down the middle I'm going to
[00:06:37] consider that the misprint since every
[00:06:39] one of them have the stripe down the
[00:06:40] middle anyways evolving Wilds plummet

[00:07:20] collectors and premium start at one
[00:07:21] point for their strength and everything
[00:07:23] else is half a point so you guys can

[00:08:09] think that could go in my dinosaur deck
[00:08:12] all right so nobody wanted those which
[00:08:13] you know I you know sometimes the old
[00:08:15] things not everybody likes to go with so
[00:08:17] we'll put that back and we're going to
[00:08:18] stretch you know what let's do something
[00:08:20] like
[00:08:21] this let's start your character out with
[00:08:26] uh start your character out with two
[00:08:28] points actually
[00:08:29] why not maybe you want to do
[00:08:36] that okay so you get everything on the
[00:08:38] screen everything on the screen Alpha
[00:08:41] you literally get all four of these
[00:08:43] packs and then what happens is you would
[00:08:45] play the G Venture game after because
[00:08:47] what happens is this is each one of
[00:08:49] these packs is half a point one so half
[00:08:52] a point two so that's one point and this
[00:08:54] is a full point any collector booster is
[00:08:56] one point for your strength in your
[00:08:58] adventure through the Wasteland which is
[00:09:00] kind of like uh your character strength
[00:09:02] starting strength so you end up getting
[00:09:05] all of these packs plus you get to go
[00:09:07] through the adventure game and
[00:09:08] potentially win a third pack for free
[00:09:12] from or a fourth fifth pack whatever it
[00:09:14] may be um from the uh either collector
[00:09:17] booster wheel that'll spin if you happen
[00:09:18] to beat the boss at the end where you
[00:09:20] have um potentially you'd have a chance
[00:09:22] of winning three you could beat three of
[00:09:24] the bosses with h starting out like this
[00:09:26] um or if you um get three points are
[00:09:29] higher you can be beat two of the bosses
[00:09:31] and win which will get you a set booster
[00:09:33] so a free collector booster or set
[00:09:34] booster just kind of by playing
[00:09:38] it anything with a Jude lotus in it is
[00:09:40] what you need oh I will have that coming
[00:09:43] in uh next week for you I'm sorry my
[00:09:45] commander Masters sold out uh last week
[00:09:48] but you know what how about a how about
[00:09:50] how about like a MOX maybe something
[00:09:53] like that you could have something in it
[00:09:54] maybe try your luck for one of
[00:09:56] those but anyways I'm going to put this
[00:09:58] one up here quick quickly for those that
[00:10:00] want it why is it FL pack CU I'm putting
[00:10:03] that up for being um two points to start
[00:10:06] their character
[00:10:07] with all right yeah I figure sometimes
[00:10:11] people like multiple packs and it's just
[00:10:12] the amount of how what they're starting
[00:10:14] their character with so might as well
[00:10:16] right so I'll put that up there and
[00:10:17] you're going to start out with $25 for
[00:10:19] these four packs that's going to get you
[00:10:21] two strength to start your character
[00:10:24] which is either going to be a mutant
[00:10:26] technician a you know what they are
[00:10:29] strong human you never or a detective I
[00:10:32] I've told you before you've been around
[00:10:34] but I got to get this rowon and this
[00:10:36] kria Triumph oh you gonna be a
[00:10:37] technician if you play it all right
[00:10:40] you'd be a technician why do you would
[00:10:42] you be a technician
[00:10:43] will why I don't know just sounds fun
[00:10:46] sounds like a fun one technician does
[00:10:48] kind of sound like a fun one maybe
[00:10:50] that's what you want to do and we're
[00:10:51] gonna I'll get these things put away
[00:10:53] here protected and then um we'll have
[00:10:55] some more packs that the family might
[00:10:56] have to open but hey maybe you guys will
[00:10:58] want to to rip some of these yourself
[00:11:00] it's either a technician or or a
[00:11:03] detective you're the random Crown
[00:11:06] drunk you know what that's okay ptd I'm
[00:11:08] I'm acceptable of allowing you to be
[00:11:10] that um I've I've um so today we have
[00:11:13] some friends coming down and we're going
[00:11:15] to this thing called a wine walk and I
[00:11:17] have um I've actually myself personally
[00:11:20] I don't think I've actually gone to one
[00:11:21] I think we've done like the one where
[00:11:22] they do the chili cook off and we've
[00:11:24] done the one where they do the um the um
[00:11:29] there was another thing too they did
[00:11:31] can't remember our Burgers maybe Burgers
[00:11:33] it might have been but what no you we're
[00:11:36] doing the Wine Walk but the other thing
[00:11:38] we did the other time was chili cook off
[00:11:39] and something
[00:11:40] else sliders sliders yeah sliders that's
[00:11:43] what it was chili cook off and Sliders
[00:11:47] that's what it was I have a question
[00:11:48] will my um electric skate be able to do
[00:11:52] that
[00:11:53] whole BL um it actually probably would
[00:11:56] be able to if it's able I would go down
[00:11:59] in the truck and put my on oh maybe
[00:12:02] maybe yeah that's not a bad idea will
[00:12:04] maybe try charge it up how's that sound
[00:12:06] okay and you know what the other thing
[00:12:08] too is this Wine Walk it's going to be a
[00:12:10] bunch of old retired people they all get
[00:12:13] just blasted and then they walk around
[00:12:15] stumbling the last time that this
[00:12:17] happened I almost saw a guy die I'm not
[00:12:20] proud of that but it was his fault he
[00:12:22] rode on a bike hit a car pinballed off a
[00:12:25] couple cars and then just over on the
[00:12:28] side in the middle of the road without a
[00:12:30] helmet luckily there was like a nurse
[00:12:32] that ran over to
[00:12:33] help not the other nurse that was part
[00:12:35] of the family I said do you want to go
[00:12:36] and help and she just kind of looked at
[00:12:37] me like I don't know what you're talking
[00:12:38] about I'm not a nurse right
[00:12:41] now she because she goes well there's
[00:12:43] another one already going over
[00:12:45] there but

[00:18:49] there was a few like the uh your one
[00:18:50] ring that you pulled out there that was
[00:18:52] that was impressive I've seen that I've
[00:18:54] only seen that a few times I don't every
[00:18:56] see I you don't see that very frequently
[00:18:58] but uh you get a lot of them from you
[00:19:00] all the time there I P
[00:19:04] out you did pull out a Dwarven soul ring
[00:19:06] roll that is correct and this is gonna
[00:19:08] go on for thank you William for being um
[00:19:11] so so appropriate with that burping this
[00:19:14] is going to go on here and you get
[00:19:18] this was it the same bundle yes we got a
[00:19:21] ring a a regular um it wasn't out of the
[00:19:24] it was out of an old older one back then
[00:19:26] it was a regular ring and a Dwarven soul
[00:19:27] ring came out of the the same bundle uh
[00:19:29] the same box um like it was actually um
[00:19:33] we might have it on YouTube if you want
[00:19:34] to
[00:19:36] check this is all one together this is
[00:19:38] one bundle together you get all three of
[00:19:40] these cards
[00:19:41] packs three Fier G sh Bor foil Lotus oh
[00:19:45] hey buddy good
[00:19:46] morning
[00:19:50] nice the bundles and the packs do pull
[00:19:53] different they do pull different the
[00:19:55] bundles and packs and that's one of the
[00:19:57] things you need to I I've noticed too is
[00:19:59] it seems like when you get a bundle they
[00:20:01] actually pull a little bit better than
[00:20:03] if you get a
[00:20:05] pack and I don't know why just one of
[00:20:08] those things hey maybe somebody wants to
[00:20:09] go after like a MOX
[00:20:11] here do this here like that then maybe
[00:20:17] um go after some
[00:20:19] lands mystery stuff
[00:20:22] there thank you you too thank you
[00:20:25] appreciate
[00:20:27] it
[00:20:29] oh nice thankk you hey you have a great
[00:20:31] day have a good day at
[00:20:32] work yeah the um one of the things with
[00:20:34] the bundles too if you notice a lot of
[00:20:36] the times the packs end up coming out in
[00:20:38] a different order and with them coming
[00:20:40] out in a different order I think it's
[00:20:41] because they are either the Japanese or
[00:20:43] the US packed ones um is what I've been
[00:20:46] told and so my understanding is that I'm
[00:20:49] guessing that's why we have a little bit
[00:20:50] of a different hit ratio on them if that
[00:20:52] makes any sense I don't know that's what
[00:20:55] my kind of guess was on it because I was
[00:20:57] told that before
[00:20:58] but here you get yourself uh we'll start
[00:21:00] you with two and a half strength on your
[00:21:02] adventure through the Wasteland you get
[00:21:03] these three packs you always get these
[00:21:05] three packs but then you get to go on a
[00:21:07] little Adventure through the
[00:21:10] Wasteland more
[00:21:12] PS order is collector
[00:21:16] first am I I'm first yeah this is a like
[00:21:19] one Eternal mass is kind of like a
[00:21:21] collector we call it a premium one this
[00:21:23] is considered a premium one which is a
[00:21:25] uh mystery and then um this is just
[00:21:28] regular one which half a point so jam if
[00:21:31] that's what you're asking about
[00:21:34] um oh Lord of the Rings bundle Lord of
[00:21:36] the Rings bundle yes order is a
[00:21:38] collector first and then um then the
[00:21:40] other ones correct that is
[00:21:43] correct I didn't have many of The Lord
[00:21:45] of the Rings special edition ones that
[00:21:47] took me a while to get them um I only
[00:21:50] got one of them for myself and I think I
[00:21:52] had one of them like the sell but I
[00:21:55] didn't have many that was a really hard

[00:25:39] we're just gonna leave that we can pick
[00:25:40] two for the next one okay will and that
[00:25:42] will be uh two strength John to start
[00:25:45] your adventure with sound good put those
[00:25:48] right
[00:25:49] there and I'm gonna put this up here
[00:25:51] give me one
[00:25:55] second give me one second
[00:26:02] here we
[00:26:06] go there you go on those ones you're
[00:26:09] going to start out with two strength on
[00:26:11] your Adventurer this morning and let's
[00:26:13] see what happens now you get four
[00:26:15] choices for an adventurer now you get to
[00:26:18] be a technician a mutant a oh crap I
[00:26:22] forgot to put it in the show notes no
[00:26:24] wonder why you guys are probably going
[00:26:25] what's going on here I don't know
[00:26:27] understand what this guy's talking about
[00:26:30] hold on let me get those in the show
[00:26:31] well I did try to put them in but they
[00:26:33] just I think they didn't go in last
[00:26:35] night and then I forgot to put them in
[00:26:36] again this morning there we go show
[00:26:38] notes technician mutant strong
[00:26:42] human a
[00:26:46] um um mute uh or a detective sorry my
[00:26:51] brain was just broken there for a second
[00:26:52] and hey don't worry I know sometimes
[00:26:54] things like that happen take your time
[00:26:55] figure that out for a minute there um
[00:26:57] and I'll go over what the other things
[00:26:59] are here so everybody has a little
[00:27:01] understanding so what happens is you
[00:27:03] also
[00:27:05] become a pluses or minuses as you travel
[00:27:08] through the Wasteland here so this gets
[00:27:10] you two points for your character and
[00:27:12] when you travel through the Wasteland
[00:27:13] what happens is there are these box you
[00:27:15] decide you're like kind of walking
[00:27:16] through you wander along and stumble
[00:27:18] along things depending on what you get
[00:27:20] is whether you get a plus or minus for
[00:27:23] your strength and we see what happens
[00:27:26] there
[00:27:28] all right so what I'm going to do right
[00:27:30] now give me one minute sometimes I know
[00:27:33] those things act weird so I'm not too
[00:27:34] worried about it I I give it some
[00:27:41] time and we'll go here wait a second
[00:27:45] looks like there's a an issue with the
[00:27:48] payment thing sometimes it happens
[00:27:50] because I've done it before where I
[00:27:51] bought from here then I bought from
[00:27:53] another person and my bank goes what are
[00:27:55] you doing somebody steal your account
[00:27:57] and I hate that it happens it happens
[00:28:01] but that's okay I'm going to give it a
[00:28:02] second here but what it'll do is you're
[00:28:04] going to walk through this Wasteland as
[00:28:06] whatever creature it is you decide to be
[00:28:07] or whatever character you decide to be
[00:28:09] you're going to stumble along and you're
[00:28:11] going to either a plus or minus one a
[00:28:13] plus or minus one or a plus or minus one
[00:28:16] depending on what you wander into then
[00:28:19] you get to battle one of the bosses here
[00:28:22] all right that's what I'm going to kind
[00:28:23] of little go over a little bit so you
[00:28:25] guys can see now your bosses are
[00:28:28] the three that you can beat is Mary
[00:28:30] Mei
[00:28:34] Velociraptor or ow andrady now it is
[00:28:37] potential you could beat the T-Rex if
[00:28:41] you decided you wanted to go with uh a
[00:28:44] double Masters and a couple of The Lord
[00:28:46] of the Rings collector booster ones
[00:28:48] there but it is that one that is the
[00:28:50] only time you have the potential beating
[00:28:51] anything that is six or more because you
[00:28:53] could actually beat the incinerator or
[00:28:55] the T-Rex because they are six or more
[00:28:56] it actually get gives you a little more
[00:28:58] opportunity when you go on those High
[00:29:00] ones so we're going to give it a second
[00:29:01] here see what happens and I'm going to
[00:29:03] put that right
[00:29:05] there and I'm gonna wait a sec here see
[00:29:08] if anything will go
[00:29:10] on might come back in a minute here but
[00:29:13] while I'll do is I'm going to do another
[00:29:15] uh another one like I normally
[00:29:18] do and put these right here so when he
[00:29:21] comes back they're right there so it
[00:29:23] looks like John might have left to
[00:29:24] straighten it out and I'm going to uh
[00:29:27] then
[00:29:28] do this and going put a new one up here
[00:29:32] I feel like this box had a monry in it
[00:29:34] but nobody pulled it out so I don't know
[00:29:35] maybe it doesn't we'll see we'll see
[00:29:38] what happens here if somebody thinks
[00:29:41] they can get lucky with this one but you
[00:29:42] are going to do this way we're GNA go
[00:29:45] after
[00:29:47] two three
[00:29:51] crits see if John Mo M mama mama Holland
[00:29:57] momah Holland I got my I got my eyesight

[00:30:02] more
[00:30:03] often oh damn it I'm that old I gotta
[00:30:06] take my glasses off to see the close
[00:30:09] things that sucks that was one that was

[00:31:54] fine don't worry about it hey
[00:31:58] W there you go John hey no worries buddy
[00:32:01] I understand banks sometimes I I had
[00:32:04] myself a walk watch your fo I don't want
[00:32:06] to roll over it one of the times I
[00:32:07] purchased something here and they were
[00:32:08] like hey they kept locking my account I
[00:32:11] actually went I was going on a trip and
[00:32:13] my my car got locked out when I was
[00:32:15] getting gas I'm like you gonna be
[00:32:17] [ __ ] me yeah you to verify it was
[00:32:20] you I know exactly what you're talking
[00:32:21] about my com your card yeah her car got
[00:32:25] stolen my wife's car got stolen
[00:32:27] here somewhere so that was another nice
[00:32:31] experience there but anyways all right
[00:32:33] so you start out with two strength with
[00:32:35] your character you get four choices
[00:32:38] John um you are a technician a detective
[00:32:43] a strong human just kind of like a
[00:32:46] defender or a mutant now in the show
[00:32:49] notes it will explain what the pluses
[00:32:51] and minus of each of the characters are
[00:32:54] and it what you do is you wander through
[00:32:56] this Wasteland land and you stumble
[00:32:58] across things depending on what your
[00:33:00] character is and you see what happens
[00:33:02] whether you get strength enough to come
[00:33:04] out and beat one of
[00:33:08] our bosses that you could potentially
[00:33:10] beat here maybe you get high enough
[00:33:12] strength where you can come out and beat
[00:33:13] one of these guys I don't know we'll
[00:33:15] find
[00:33:18] out so well I'll give you a minute to
[00:33:21] look at the note there and see what you
[00:33:22] would like to choose and we'll go from
[00:33:25] there
[00:33:27] and then I have this thater will will be
[00:33:32] used opening a couple packs from here
[00:33:34] later because we have one we get one
[00:33:36] from the family we always whenever we
[00:33:38] get a case I generally keep one for the
[00:33:39] family because we're uh we like to play
[00:33:41] ourselves and have the cards and have it
[00:33:43] collect so okay might as well try right
[00:33:46] so gonna go mutant all right he's gonna
[00:33:49] go with the mutant what do you think
[00:33:50] there a good choice good choice will I
[00:33:52] don't know hey guess what actually let
[00:33:54] me see uh it's not finished yet I was
[00:33:56] doing this the other day but this is
[00:33:57] going to be the animation for the
[00:34:02] mutant once I get that finished that'll
[00:34:04] be the animation for the mutant when he
[00:34:05] comes walking in so you are the mutant
[00:34:08] walking
[00:34:09] in and you say I'm hungry as you stumble
[00:34:12] through the
[00:34:13] Wasteland all right mutant all right mut
[00:34:17] you need to move your hand out of the
[00:34:18] way so I can kick pick these now you're
[00:34:21] stumbling through the Wasteland you
[00:34:23] decide you can I think there's 78 cards
[00:34:25] in here where would you like to go on
[00:34:27] here as you stumble through the waist
[00:34:28] and you pick things up put them down go
[00:34:30] that's not food I need something to make
[00:34:31] myself stronger what can I
[00:34:34] collect and you finally find one item in
[00:34:39] this adventure that you pick up and you
[00:34:42] look at it intensely in this item the
[00:34:44] number is or should I pick a random one
[00:34:46] for you it's up to you
[00:34:50] John what's going on what you watch oh
[00:34:55] what oh

[00:35:11] mutant this today pick this thing up and
[00:35:13] you go oh bite it Go ow my tooth which I
[00:35:18] actually have a hurt tooth right now
[00:35:19] which is kind of the right reason I said
[00:35:20] that my tooth it hurts oh I dropped that
[00:35:24] now you're stumbling around the
[00:35:25] Wasteland with a hurt mouth only with
[00:35:27] one strength because you can barely chew
[00:35:29] anything to get any extra food but
[00:35:31] that's okay maybe you stumble into a
[00:35:34] friend or an item that can uh help you
[00:35:37] along the way do you want to go random
[00:35:39] again or would you like to tell me
[00:35:40] specific I think there's a 78 there I
[00:35:43] want to watch
[00:35:46] this can do random
[00:35:48] again up to you the random the entire
[00:35:51] time or uh number five oh number five

[00:37:33] man he's a one arm mutant wandering
[00:37:34] through the Wasteland with only one

[00:41:01] Druid charm extended art that's a nice
[00:41:03] little hit there sarin sluth that's a
[00:41:06] pretty good one too if I remember in a
[00:41:09] war leaders call nice War leaders call
[00:41:12] and a pyrotechnic performer and then a
[00:41:16] clue well AR Druid charm and uh the
[00:41:19] sleuth is pretty good if I remember I'm
[00:41:22] not sure about war leader but I'm going
[00:41:24] to get this one in a top loader for you
[00:41:26] because uh we like to do that and
[00:41:27] remember also I do it like this for
[00:41:30] shipping if you don't want me to do the
[00:41:31] back to back most people don't mind
[00:41:33] because it keeps the package stiffer
[00:41:35] when it comes to shipping but uh if you
[00:41:37] don't want me to I won't I'll I'll do it
[00:41:40] individually all right cool cool no
[00:41:43] problem bud here yeah it helps uh keep
[00:41:46] the like keeps them from being um as
[00:41:48] floppy I guess you would say you like we
[00:41:50] want we want stiff cards we don't want
[00:41:51] floppy cards right hey Jupiter how you
[00:41:55] doing
[00:41:58] I went through I was going through some
[00:41:59] lands for you um the other day uh for to
[00:42:01] get out for you so your stuff might get
[00:42:03] out for um after the weekend but um
[00:42:05] you'll have a few more you'll have a few
[00:42:06] extra lands in there for you that you
[00:42:08] you needed some bulk you said so I
[00:42:09] figured I'd send you some all right give
[00:42:12] it a little extra packaging make sure
[00:42:14] your cards don't get bent and all
[00:42:16] that watch oh you got to put your watch
[00:42:20] on so they're not allowed to have the
[00:42:22] watch at school because it's considered
[00:42:24] a smart watch and they're not allowed
[00:42:26] have Smartwatch at schools but um this
[00:42:29] watch goes into like a school mode which
[00:42:31] doesn't allow it to be used at all
[00:42:33] except for literally an emergency to
[00:42:34] press certain buttons to call 911 and my
[00:42:37] kids know not to call
[00:42:39] 911
[00:42:41] so my point is that's another one oh
[00:42:44] calls mom and dad I thought it was 911
[00:42:45] no only calls mommy in oh well well all
[00:42:48] right never mind mommy you got
[00:42:50] put was a one thought what anyways there
[00:42:55] you go buddy
[00:42:58] John and we'll get all that package up
[00:42:59] very nicely for you before shipping
[00:43:01] everybody knows that I always do that I
[00:43:03] always take care of that for
[00:43:06] shipping and for those that are just
[00:43:09] coming in John went on a little
[00:43:11] Wasteland Adventure came across a a
[00:43:14] Watcher in the water and did not did not
[00:43:17] go his way that's okay maybe it will go

[00:43:52] way three strength with your character
[00:43:54] and let me get our uh cards back in here
[00:43:57] so that our next Adventurer along the
[00:43:59] way has a full potential of getting
[00:44:01] everything they need depending on what
[00:44:04] their character is obviously you know
[00:44:06] maybe it's a uh technician this time and
[00:44:08] they need that treasure that's in
[00:44:12] there or maybe they're a detective
[00:44:14] looking for the treasure to trade for
[00:44:16] some information I don't know but guys
[00:44:20] you can um you can actually build your
[00:44:21] own creature too you don't need your
[00:44:23] character strength you don't need me to
[00:44:25] do it for you you can tell us hey I want
[00:44:27] to have these two packs like we're just
[00:44:31] done like somebody just did two packs
[00:44:33] they wanted they didn't want three they
[00:44:34] wanted
[00:44:35] two but it got them two strength to

[00:44:41] like this and do uh we'll do
[00:44:46] that try your luck with those and maybe
[00:44:49] do
[00:44:54] um maybe get some luck

[00:45:22] then we are going to uh yeah go along
[00:45:24] this I'm G to have to jump off at some
[00:45:27] point because we do have friends coming
[00:45:29] and um so I'll be hanging out and doing
[00:45:31] stuff with them I believe a red button
[00:45:35] animations are working oh I'll have to
[00:45:37] check that again the animations may not
[00:45:39] be
[00:45:43] working button no the animation wasn't
[00:45:46] working there I have to go and check it
[00:45:52] again
[00:45:54] y um
[00:45:57] sure no put that
[00:46:03] back uh maybe okay that's a possibility
[00:46:06] we'll talk about that later how's that
[00:46:08] sound okay sound good all right we're
[00:46:10] going to rip open some Lord of the Rings
[00:46:11] though I that's what I'm gonna do though
[00:46:13] how about William you want to see if you
[00:46:15] got any luck pulling out of the pulling
[00:46:17] out a pack here sure show the people the
[00:46:20] luck we get today let's do this for um
[00:46:24] let's do this for a pack deal right now
[00:46:26] we're going to put these up
[00:46:29] here I forgot I had those two Commander
[00:46:32] Masters that were there I have two
[00:46:33] Commander Masters set boosters until the
[00:46:35] other ones come in it's a so slow this
[00:46:37] morning it is a little slow this morning
[00:46:38] but that's okay how do we have 16 but
[00:46:42] that's okay let's do uh let's rip
[00:46:43] something open and maybe you guys will
[00:46:45] tell us something you want we're g to do
[00:46:47] uh this here for our
[00:46:51] Adventurer William you bumped into me
[00:46:53] please don't do that again okay not when
[00:46:56] I'm trying to type things out and we're
[00:46:58] going to do this here and I'm going to
[00:46:59] open up this box that we got here and
[00:47:01] we're going to see if we got any Lu what
[00:47:03] we opening ready guys this is here
[00:47:06] that's going to go and I'm gonna open
[00:47:07] this up this is my family one we keep
[00:47:09] one for the family because I buy it with
[00:47:12] my own money
[00:47:14] specifically because we want one for the
[00:47:16] family we use them that's why the whole
[00:47:18] reason we started doing this was uh
[00:47:19] William what did you want to do do does
[00:47:21] what did you want to do William uh give
[00:47:24] money no what did you say you wanted to
[00:47:26] do have a YouTube channel yes you wanted
[00:47:29] to do a YouTube channel and opening
[00:47:30] video and doing openings so because of
[00:47:33] that we decided uh we can't afford to do
[00:47:36] that we might as well try doing that on
[00:47:37] here a little bit and if you guys want
[00:47:39] to buy something more money to do it on
[00:47:41] there so that we can use it to do the
[00:47:42] YouTube channel with that is correct so
[00:47:44] we use this for the money to do our
[00:47:46] YouTube okay
[00:47:47] now that being said this is your packs
[00:47:50] you're starting out your adventure with
[00:47:52] you get all of these three packs but
[00:47:54] you're G to start out with one
[00:47:56] two points for your strength for your
[00:47:58] character all right guys that's pretty
[00:48:00] good deal for those three packs and I'm
[00:48:01] gonna have will sit down he's going to
[00:48:03] pick out a l of the ring and see if he
[00:48:04] has any luck in our family box here can
[00:48:07] I open it yeah you're gonna open

[00:52:40] don't know guys what's he gonna do for
[00:52:44] you cranco cranco is going with the D oh
[00:52:48] the oh double Masters all right cranco
[00:52:52] hey now cranco with this double Masters
[00:52:54] here one of the things uh if you would
[00:52:57] like to you can play the adventure game
[00:53:00] which actually get because this double
[00:53:01] Masters gets you two strength for your
[00:53:04] character in The Adventure game if you
[00:53:05] want to play it or I'll just rip it for
[00:53:07] you it is obviously just GNA be ripped
[00:53:09] if you would want me to but it is up to
[00:53:11] you you never open one of them they are
[00:53:14] actually really nice packs there's a lot
[00:53:16] I like the art in them a lot I'm a big
[00:53:17] fan of the art in them yes I'll
[00:53:20] definitely rip it for you buddy and um
[00:53:23] did you did you want to do the like I
[00:53:24] was saying I know you didn't
[00:53:25] specifically jump in to play the game
[00:53:27] there but did you want to try your luck
[00:53:29] and maybe um in the adventure game to
[00:53:32] see if you can get yourself a free set
[00:53:33] booster I think that's as high as you
[00:53:35] could get starting up with two points
[00:53:37] the game is you get an adventure game
[00:53:39] you pick one of four characters um it's
[00:53:41] kind of pinned at the bottom there
[00:53:43] generally I do different things but you
[00:53:44] get one of four characters a technician
[00:53:46] a detective a strong human um or a
[00:53:50] mutant and they all have pluses and
[00:53:51] minus as they wander through the
[00:53:53] Wasteland here and what happen happens
[00:53:55] is you get a plus or minus for the
[00:53:57] strength of your character and then at
[00:53:58] the end hopefully you have enough
[00:54:00] strength to either beat the Velociraptor
[00:54:02] so you can get a collector booster uh
[00:54:05] spin of The Collector booster wheel for
[00:54:07] free or you can maybe beat the um o and
[00:54:10] Grady here and get another one there or
[00:54:12] the Miri um to get yourself a spin of
[00:54:15] the set booster if you get three or more
[00:54:17] but what happens is those are your
[00:54:19] bosses that kind of go up against the
[00:54:20] end so I'll just rip it open or if you
[00:54:23] want to you can try that out what's up
[00:54:25] bud you're down all right sounds good no
[00:54:29] that's that is two strength yeah two
[00:54:31] strength with that one double double M
[00:54:33] exactly you got what I was doing with it
[00:54:36] you picked it up double that's literally
[00:54:37] the reason why I did it all right
[00:54:38] anyways where was that from do you get
[00:54:40] the pack you always get the pack you
[00:54:43] always get the pack in the adventure
[00:54:45] game you never you never not get
[00:54:47] anything you always get the packs you
[00:54:48] buy it's just whether or not you get
[00:54:51] something extra when you play that's
[00:54:54] really what what it
[00:54:57] is yeah yeah because what it is is um
[00:55:00] pretty much what it is if people buy
[00:55:01] something at full price um it allows me
[00:55:04] to over
[00:55:06] time having one or two being given away
[00:55:08] isn't a problem um but when I that's why
[00:55:11] I can't do like the same discount deal
[00:55:12] that I do when I do like pack deals on
[00:55:14] it if I'm doing the adventure game but
[00:55:16] so when somebody buys it at full price I
[00:55:17] try to give them the auor so you get
[00:55:19] four choices like I said technician
[00:55:21] mutant human strong human or detective
[00:55:24] they're all in the show notes that it
[00:55:25] kind of explains what the character is
[00:55:27] if you want to uh pick pick a character
[00:55:30] or you can just go with one and it's a
[00:55:33] just randomly plus or minus one or
[00:55:35] depending on where you wander through
[00:55:37] the Wasteland
[00:55:39] here you're going to be a mutant I like
[00:55:42] it gonna be a

[01:02:16] like we always do we do these cranco if
[01:02:17] you don't want me to do this I do this
[01:02:19] for shipping it helps to keep the
[01:02:21] package and um the cards stiffer so that
[01:02:24] they don't uh bend around and stuff like
[01:02:27] that so that's why I like to do this if
[01:02:30] you don't want me to I won't it's
[01:02:32] completely up to you yes the city is
[01:02:35] awesome that city is an awesome

[01:02:46] gold a city of gold to me okay all right
[01:02:49] just want to make sure some PE most
[01:02:51] people don't care because it helps to
[01:02:53] keep everything stiff for shipping when
[01:02:55] you put them in top loaders but uh I
[01:02:58] just like to double check that's all
[01:03:00] that is
[01:03:01] all because we do this here we put it in
[01:03:05] then see how it doesn't like see how it
[01:03:07] doesn't slide around in there that means
[01:03:09] it doesn't slide around during shipping
[01:03:11] which is what I
[01:03:13] like then you get your stuff nice and
[01:03:16] snug in a package question yes William I
[01:03:19] know you had a question before what is

[01:05:41] highest Mana value and whoever gets the
[01:05:43] highest Mana value is the one that hits
[01:05:45] its Target and you get an extra pull
[01:05:47] from that box so with that being said
[01:05:51] where would you like to me to go our
[01:05:53] buddy k
[01:05:57] after with this can you tellan that can
[01:06:00] you um ask to help me with the yes we'll
[01:06:02] have we'll have no help them dishes that
[01:06:04] is
[01:06:05] correct random all right we'll do one
[01:06:08] random for you we're GNA go like this
[01:06:09] and we we're right here here we go this
[01:06:12] is the buyer well Nolan come on over and
[01:06:14] pick one out for you come on over and
[01:06:17] pick one out for you and see where you
[01:06:18] what yours is just didn't want the stuff
[01:06:20] to fall over there yep that is the Suns
[01:06:23] all right and here we go I'm going to do
[01:06:26] one I'm GNA do this one here I'm GNA do
[01:06:28] this that is the buyer I mean the father
[01:06:31] so now we're gonna flip these babies
[01:06:33] over and we're gonna see what you get
[01:06:35] for packs all right K the father has
[01:06:38] pulled you out a lost Caverns Exelon
[01:06:40] draft you got a lost Caverns Exelon set
[01:06:43] from the sun and a draft from you for
[01:06:47] there now being two drafts I do give the
[01:06:49] option of trading one back to see if you
[01:06:52] get a a different one there so your
[01:06:56] option is to trade one of these back I'm
[01:06:58] guessing you're going to probably try to
[01:06:59] trade the buyer or the father switch the
[01:07:03] buyer all right switch the buyer back
[01:07:05] we're going to do this put the buyer
[01:07:07] there we're going to pull this one out
[01:07:09] instead for the buyer and let's see what
[01:07:11] happens you got another one I am sorry
[01:07:16] it did come out as another draft there
[01:07:18] so we're going to do those there as
[01:07:21] those and then you got a set but you
[01:07:24] know what that means that means you get
[01:07:26] a good chance of coming out with the
[01:07:28] buyer here all right you get a good
[01:07:31] chance of coming out with the buyer here
[01:07:33] so here we go what we're GNA do is we're
[01:07:34] going to rip open this father and we're
[01:07:36] going to see what
[01:07:37] happens yep I'm just saying we're

[01:50:56] booster
[01:51:00] of Commander I mean set booster
[01:51:03] Commander Masters because I have no
[01:51:04] collector boosters left now with that
[01:51:06] set booster there what are G I have like
[01:51:09] a hair you ever like Miss a hair when
[01:51:11] you're cutting you're
[01:51:12] shaving Drey so I will explain how this
[01:51:16] works the adventure game we're going to
[01:51:19] use our buddy here an example well this
[01:51:21] one was the father and son game what we
[01:51:23] were doing here um this one was somebody
[01:51:25] did a uh just did the did bought uh the
[01:51:29] mystery game which is this here actually
[01:51:32] that's what they bought there that was
[01:51:33] the mystery game you get three packs of
[01:51:35] cards and whichever one has the highest
[01:51:36] amount of value is the Target that gets
[01:51:38] hit and you get an extra pack pull from
[01:51:40] there it's like the father maybe the son
[01:51:41] or the buyer you saw the father was time
[01:51:43] but maybe the buyer you might get a card
[01:51:45] you want as you saw the last time or
[01:51:46] maybe you get something from the buyer
[01:51:47] that's maybe an extra pack we don't know
[01:51:49] but but that's how it goes there when it
[01:51:51] comes to those but the adventure game is
[01:51:53] a little different the adventure game
[01:51:56] the way you play the adventure game is
[01:51:58] there
[01:52:01] are multiple characters
[01:52:04] here that
[01:52:06] you choose from you choose either you
[01:52:09] want me to rip this open myel I'm
[01:52:11] guessing you always want me to rip
[01:52:12] that's why I was just getting ready
[01:52:14] to hey Deo how you doing all right so
[01:52:17] what happens is you pick um multiple
[01:52:20] whatever you want whether it's collector
[01:52:21] boosters or set boosters or whatever it
[01:52:23] is they add up set boosters are half a
[01:52:25] point collector boosters are one point
[01:52:26] you can get up the three packs or three
[01:52:28] points as a High um because I don't have
[01:52:31] any of the double Masters left anymore
[01:52:34] and or three and a half Point actually I
[01:52:35] think you get more get four and a half
[01:52:37] points if you went with all these but
[01:52:39] anyways um strength for your character
[01:52:42] and each one of these is plus one or
[01:52:44] minus one that's a plus one or minus one
[01:52:45] a plus one or minus one in the back
[01:52:47] there then you go up against the boss
[01:52:49] and if you're able to beat one of the
[01:52:50] three bosses you get a spin of The
[01:52:53] Collector booster wheel which gets you a
[01:52:54] free collector booster pack or if you
[01:52:57] don't have happen to beat the three
[01:52:58] bosses maybe you have enough to beat two
[01:52:59] of the bosses you'll be able to get one
[01:53:01] of the spins of the set booster wheel
[01:53:03] and get yourself a free set
[01:53:06] booster gnomes blessing gnome's blessing
[01:53:09] on the pack all right here we got
[01:53:11] gnome's
[01:53:12] blessing here we are and I think this
[01:53:15] one I think they put them in order right
[01:53:17] no no no they don't one two 2 three four
[01:53:21] five six seven I believe it was with
[01:53:24] these
[01:53:25] ones believe it was seven here we go
[01:53:30] loyal
[01:53:31] Drake thriving
[01:53:33] Bluff thriving Isle got some thriving

[01:54:16] too and then a sunblade angel foil and a
[01:54:21] zombie token not
[01:54:27] bad no problem yes so what we would do
[01:54:30] is you would purchase um one two or
[01:54:33] three packs and that would just be the
[01:54:36] amount and you would always get those
[01:54:37] packs back you always are guaranteed to
[01:54:39] get those packs that's your packs
[01:54:41] there's yours we open those after we're
[01:54:43] done or I ship them it's up to you most
[01:54:44] of the time people want me to open them
[01:54:46] and what we'll end up doing is um we
[01:54:49] just go through through the adventure
[01:54:50] and you could potentially get yourself
[01:54:51] an extra one at the
[01:54:54] end yeah drezy ripped or shipped it's up
[01:54:57] to
[01:54:58] you we can rip it right on stream here
[01:55:01] or I can ship it to you don't don't mind
[01:55:03] any questions but um also the so the
[01:55:06] adventure game I'll put up say I'll I'll
[01:55:08] put up like a pack deal here and I'll
[01:55:09] give a little example right after this
[01:55:11] for the adventure game for you guys that
[01:55:13] way you have a little understanding of
[01:55:14] how it
[01:55:15] works all
[01:55:17] right help a little bit for you but you
[01:55:20] can always say what ones you want too so
[01:55:23] like I'm going to put it up myself here
[01:55:24] just random but you can always uh just
[01:55:26] say specifically what you want and we
[01:55:28] would go from there and I'm trying to
[01:55:30] get it together that I can um put it up
[01:55:32] on screen easier but I didn't think
[01:55:34] about it until the middle of the stream
[01:55:35] here so I haven't gotten a chance got it
[01:55:37] all done yet but what I will do is I'm
[01:55:41] going to do
[01:55:42] this that's myel and I'm going to do
[01:55:45] something like this I'm going to say
[01:55:47] we're going to call it one of these
[01:55:50] we're going to start out with one
[01:55:53] two and we'll say three for your
[01:55:56] strength is where you're going to start
[01:55:57] for your character on this adventure
[01:55:59] right
[01:56:00] now I do have some singles I sell just
[01:56:03] not a ton this I mean I mean this whole
[01:56:05] side is singles here so I do have some
[01:56:08] singles if people want
[01:56:11] those but um I uh will put this up here
[01:56:14] for your packs if you want them and
[01:56:16] thank you gnomes for I appreciate you
[01:56:18] helping out and answering some things
[01:56:19] for
[01:56:29] everyone all right we'll put this up
[01:56:31] here these three packs on screen you're
[01:56:33] going to get these three
[01:56:35] packs all right and um you'll also be
[01:56:39] able to play the game here I'm going to
[01:56:40] give a little explanation these three
[01:56:42] packs will get you at three points to
[01:56:44] start your creature now say you were
[01:56:46] going to be like a mutant or something
[01:56:47] you'd walk through and you'd be looking
[01:56:48] for food in the Wasteland
[01:56:50] here and you can go anywhere from maybe
[01:56:54] you pull something out here you say oh
[01:56:55] I'm going to go with this you go oh no
[01:56:57] that's a
[01:56:57] treasure mutant doesn't like treasure he
[01:57:00] throws that treasure to the ground and
[01:57:02] he loses a little strength because he
[01:57:03] was looking for food along the way well
[01:57:05] then know know what that didn't happen
[01:57:07] that's okay we're going quickly through
[01:57:08] this the um he gos he goes you know what
[01:57:11] I think I'm gonna find I find a friend
[01:57:13] along the way or not I don't know and he
[01:57:15] finds a clue now he doesn't know what a
[01:57:17] clue is because he's a mutant he doesn't
[01:57:19] understand he drops it along the way and
[01:57:20] he's still hungry so he's only got one
[01:57:22] strength here and he ends up going
[01:57:24] through finds a comes the end here and
[01:57:26] goes maybe I'm going to find a companion
[01:57:27] that's goingon to help me along the way
[01:57:30] let's see what happens we go and we do
[01:57:31] not find a companion it takes his
[01:57:33] strength away oh my God this mutant has
[01:57:35] been dropped down to zero strength as he
[01:57:37] wanders through the Wasteland trying to
[01:57:39] find something to maybe eat but then a
[01:57:41] boss comes out of nowhere and Mary
[01:57:44] duelist would have had a chance of
[01:57:46] beating him if you uh could not get
[01:57:47] minus three for everything but you know
[01:57:49] what Mei came around and just slashed at
[01:57:51] the mutant leaving him to die aimlessly
[01:57:53] in the Wasteland but that would be uh
[01:57:56] kind of like what would happen there if
[01:57:57] we went with a mutant and I picked those
[01:57:59] things up but then if you would if you
[01:58:01] happen to win say you won and that marry
[01:58:04] was there well there is a wheel that
[01:58:05] goes up here and you get the chance to
[01:58:09] either win a collector booster or a set
[01:58:11] booster depending on what it
[01:58:15] is yeah if you want to bundle stuff
[01:58:17] together thank you thank you I will do
[01:58:18] deals on things like um it helps me with
[01:58:21] like whatnot these if people do multiple
[01:58:23] things together so if you guys do
[01:58:25] multiple things together um I generally
[01:58:27] discount it um the only time I don't a
[01:58:29] lot is when we do like games like this
[01:58:30] because you get free stuff in the game
[01:58:32] and that's the only reason I don't do
[01:58:33] like that same type of
[01:58:35] discount but we'll put this up
[01:58:38] here that there maybe you want to lure
[01:58:41] the
[01:58:42] Rings maybe you want to low the Rings
[01:58:45] and maybe we want to go after our triom
[01:58:47] with a force but you can tell me what
[01:58:49] you want too you don't need me to say
[01:58:52] what it is oh that was only three packs

[01:59:02] it and this will go on
[01:59:05] here for those that want to try with
[01:59:08] these
[01:59:09] ones maybe you want to go after a
[01:59:12] uh your own one

[01:59:19] force of negation and some
[01:59:23] triom I don't know we'll see what you
[01:59:26] would like to do there but that'll get
[01:59:28] you one two one half one two one two and
[01:59:31] a half points sorry to start your
[01:59:34] character with so two and a half

[02:03:44] get one for those and I think that's the
[02:03:46] cost and two for those and I believe
[02:03:48] that's the cost of everything if I have
[02:03:50] it in there
[02:04:05] right I did not remake the Doctor Who
[02:04:07] game is it still in there uh because it
[02:04:10] should not be in there
[02:04:12] gnomes if they keep copying that over
[02:04:14] I'm actually going to be kind of
[02:04:17] annoyed
[02:04:19] no it is not there all right no I'm GNA
[02:04:21] be I have um no I did not remake the
[02:04:24] Doctor Who game because the top card was

[02:04:28] something else with the L of the bo rest

[02:13:14] all right so one two three one
[02:13:18] I just want to make sure what I have
[02:13:20] first that I'm not
[02:13:22] um taking out things that I don't

[02:13:35] dinosaurs in my game so I will give you
[02:13:38] fungus
[02:13:41] dinosaur one two three of the regular
[02:13:45] dinosaurs actually I want the one with
[02:13:47] the EG got two of the ones with the eggs
[02:13:49] though I want the eggs two of the eggs
[02:13:50] good three of
[02:13:53] those and then one
[02:13:58] two think um I'll give you two of these
[02:14:01] guys because I need a couple of those
[02:14:04] myself and then I will give you uh you
[02:14:08] want a couple of these ones too so here
[02:14:11] if you would like got one two three four
[02:14:15] five six seven eight of those there for
[02:14:18] you and some of them I think were even
[02:14:20] double-sided with Dino
[02:14:22] eggs yeah a couple of them were
[02:14:24] doublesided with Dino
[02:14:26] eggs yeah so you got Dino eggs on the
[02:14:29] back of a couple of
[02:14:31] them and uh one two three four five six
[02:14:36] seven eight Dino ones there tokens for
[02:14:40] you I just need to keep us some for for
[02:14:43] our family in my Dino deck but I knew I
[02:14:45] had a bunch of them so that's why I was
[02:14:46] like I know I have a bunch of them so if
[02:14:48] you need some let me uh let me see what
[02:14:51] I can get for
[02:14:55] you yeah uh yeah come on give me one
[02:14:58] second
[02:14:59] here yeah I I I opened a bunch of these
[02:15:03] I was over the top a little bit with
[02:15:05] some of them um but
[02:15:14] hey all right this one was the
[02:15:24] this one was the um this one here
[02:15:29] fungus
[02:15:35] fungus to check out what these
[02:15:37] are not sure what all them are for some
[02:15:40] reason I think they're like like three
[02:15:42] to five bucks but I don't know how much
[02:15:43] they all
[02:15:46] are
[02:15:52] we can go one two three four five six
[02:15:55] seven eight we'll call well how about
[02:15:58] how about this I don't know how much
[02:15:59] they all are I can double check for you
[02:16:01] if you want to give me a minute or we
[02:16:02] can do
[02:16:04] this call each of them
[02:16:06] $3 and there'll be $24 for all of them
[02:16:10] or I can go through and double check
[02:16:11] because they're generally like three to
[02:16:12] five
[02:16:14] bucks cuz I think this one is this one
[02:16:17] might be
[02:16:30] three so egg
[02:16:34] dinosaur egg
[02:16:37] dinosaur foil is like
[02:16:42] $2 looks
[02:16:45] like yeah
[02:16:48] I got a decent amount but they're not
[02:16:50] going to all come in at the same
[02:16:52] time so hold on just give me one second
[02:16:54] so these runs are
[02:16:56] three these ones I think are
[02:17:01] two these ones are two with the egg so
[02:17:06] three
[02:17:08] two go back a little bit the ones are
[02:17:11] cup Dragon dinosaur
[02:17:15] dinosaur doublesided
[02:17:18] [Music]
[02:17:20] dinosur doublesided dinosaur
[02:17:25] vampire vampire
[02:17:27] fungus is actually like wow that's
[02:17:29] actually $5 there that's ins
[02:17:31] insane then we have um
[02:17:37] dinosaur doublesided
[02:17:43] dinosur double-sided
[02:17:46] dinosaur
[02:17:49] I don't doublesided dinosaur
[02:17:53] fungus dinosaur
[02:17:55] dinosaur
[02:18:01] gnome cofy
[02:18:04] gnome yeah so um it looks like these
[02:18:07] ones are a dollar so in these ones so
[02:18:11] that's probably a dollar two I'm
[02:18:12] guessing so three so
[02:18:16] six 6 10
[02:18:21] 15 16
[02:18:23] 17 18 19 we'll call it 19 for him how's
[02:18:27] that for all of these does that sound
[02:18:30] like a plan for
[02:18:34] [Music]
[02:18:36] you got any foiled slime Against
[02:18:39] Humanity I do not have a foiled slime
[02:18:41] Against Humanity Screech I'm sorry
[02:18:43] sliver tokens
[02:18:46] o I'll have to double check on that one
[02:18:49] I might have some sliver tokens but uh
[02:18:51] not East let me know what you want there
[02:18:53] doctor I did get some in for um Fallout
[02:18:56] so I have um I
[02:19:00] have two coming in from the regular
[02:19:03] distributor then I ordered some um I had
[02:19:06] to order them from different places
[02:19:08] before they went insane but they're not
[02:19:09] they're not going to be overly cheap
[02:19:11] that's the thing that SNS so yeah let me
[02:19:15] know what you want to do there um
[02:19:18] not
[02:19:19] East but those are the tokens I I'll put
[02:19:21] them off the side with your name on it
[02:19:23] that way uh I don't miss up any of
[02:19:29] those because we know you were looking
[02:19:31] for
[02:19:32] those not sure if you're still in here
[02:19:35] might have lost you for a minute but I'm
[02:19:36] not
[02:19:40] sure okay no
[02:19:43] worries put those there and what I'm
[02:19:45] going to do next
[02:19:48] yeah I got um I got a good amount of
[02:19:50] Fallout I ordered uh a lot I didn't get
[02:19:52] everything that I ordered but I am going
[02:19:54] to get I'm hopefully going to get all my
[02:19:56] um collector uh well my my commander
[02:19:59] boxes
[02:20:00] though I ordered three cases of
[02:20:02] Commander boxes one for the family and
[02:20:04] two to sell so well there should
[02:20:07] hopefully be two cases of Commander
[02:20:10] boxes that come in to sell and that's uh
[02:20:13] up to you guys there uh if you want any
[02:20:15] of those but uh
[02:20:18] like commander
[02:20:24] deck yeah no me nether Dr penstein I
[02:20:28] don't think anyone's getting them in any
[02:20:29] cheaper than you're not going to see him
[02:20:30] any cheaper than uh probably 350 to 500
[02:20:34] I'm going to guess if they actually did
[02:20:36] not print these and this is only print
[02:20:38] they're going to have that the boxes are
[02:20:40] going to probably be 4500 like Lord of
[02:20:42] the Rings was in two months which
[02:20:45] sucks because I had um I I I'm trying to
[02:20:48] get them my distributor as long as I can
[02:20:50] get them they can get them I can get
[02:20:51] them pretty good so I can give you good
[02:20:52] deals on them but the problem is uh the
[02:20:55] distributor only got a lot less than
[02:20:58] they normally do and they uh they had
[02:21:01] like really no reason other than I'm
[02:21:02] sorry and it's not their fault you know
[02:21:05] it's it's Wizards and what they're doing
[02:21:07] you
[02:21:08] know we're going to put this up here
[02:21:10] four your adventure for the
[02:21:14] Wasteland if you want to take it
[02:21:21] yeah blizzard will yeah was they only
[02:21:24] printing
[02:21:25] order D yeah it's hard sometimes to do
[02:21:28] that I am I have a business license and
[02:21:30] that's literally the reason why I have a
[02:21:31] business license and I have a I have a
[02:21:33] resale license to the state and all that
[02:21:36] so that's the reason why I'm able to go
[02:21:37] through some of the distributor people
[02:21:38] that I'm able to because of that because
[02:21:40] I'm doing it as resale and everything
[02:21:42] because I have all the licenses for it
[02:21:44] that's why if it wasn't for that I
[02:21:45] wouldn't be able to because they don't
[02:21:47] want to do it without having a resale
[02:21:49] license because what I do is um they're
[02:21:51] able to get it to me as like kind of
[02:21:53] like a distributor but they get to
[02:21:54] charge different and not get the same
[02:21:56] tax charge on everything so it helps
[02:21:58] them and it helps me
[02:22:00] also guys remember at the top there you
[02:22:03] should be able to see what you can get
[02:22:04] now let's see um maybe it's a little
[02:22:07] high for it should I move this
[02:22:14] down or is it too small maybe the right
[02:22:17] is too small can you not read
[02:22:21] it or is it in the way of
[02:22:24] something I don't know maybe it's in
[02:22:27] the
[02:22:29] oh that's probably what the problem
[02:22:33] [Applause]
[02:22:35] is there you go now you can see it it's
[02:22:38] not in the way that was being blocked
[02:22:41] before no wonder why hey Mike how you
[02:22:45] doing I decided to put up uh what all
[02:22:48] them what all them are for your points
[02:22:50] so if you want to build your own
[02:22:51] Adventurer you can and not East let me
[02:22:54] know here if you want
[02:22:57] that morning I'm gonna be on for a
[02:23:00] little while here actually you know what
[02:23:02] I'm going to do I'm G to put on a pack
[02:23:03] you and I'm gonna rip that pack open
[02:23:04] that i' had been sitting here for a
[02:23:05] little while and see if I get any luck
[02:23:08] because my son ripped up freaking the
[02:23:10] first pack he pulled out of the family
[02:23:12] Lord of the Rings pack was a
[02:23:14] foil one ring I mean I'm not set that he

[00:00:07] stream I don't know I'll find out I
[00:00:10] don't know it doesn't look like it
[00:00:12] is that stinks that's one of the things
[00:00:15] I think was my problem I couldn't figure
[00:00:16] out how to get this to stream correctly
[00:00:18] to uh to YouTube when I was trying
[00:00:23] to I think that's what my big issue was
[00:00:25] ah I do believe
[00:00:28] so maybe I can do it from
[00:00:33] here my broadcast title let's put the
[00:00:37] title in there
[00:00:40] as let's do it time to do it
[00:01:28] come hang with
[00:01:31] us on
[00:01:34] drip let's see if I can get the uh link
[00:01:37] here where's the share link here I
[00:01:40] thought I had
[00:01:41] it I can't find where it
[00:01:45] is where is that share link
[00:01:50] ah ah
[00:01:53] share I can't do it that way what talk
[00:01:56] just copy link
[00:02:07] so let's do this
[00:02:13] now
[00:02:15] no go to the correct one oh that's going
[00:02:17] to frustrate me if it does that all the
[00:02:22] time all right let's see if I can get
[00:02:24] this to run correctly what was I doing
[00:02:26] that I just got sidetracked
[00:02:34] oh my God I just got completely
[00:02:35] sidetracked what I was doing because the
[00:02:36] S the sound
[00:02:38] thing
[00:02:40] huh trying to figure out how to get it
[00:02:42] to go but oh I was doing that's what I
[00:02:44] was doing copying the
[00:02:55] uh public gaming
[00:03:08] normal
[00:03:28] okay
[00:03:58] e
[00:04:28] e
[00:04:58] e
[00:05:28] e
[00:05:58] e
[00:06:28] e
[00:06:58] e
[00:07:28] e e
[00:08:26] switch again audio switch again why is
[00:08:29] it doing this to me it's showing me like
[00:08:31] there's no audio on here it does
[00:08:41] work well there we go I figured out how
[00:08:43] to find some of
[00:08:55] it all right I think it's because I hear
[00:08:58] the audio on here
[00:09:01] ah there you go there you go that's why
[00:09:04] I hear the audio from that
[00:09:08] one g to make sure I can hear myself I
[00:09:11] guess I'll have to check in and see in
[00:09:14] on this on a regular basis to make sure
[00:09:15] I can be heard if I can be heard then
[00:09:19] we'll keep
[00:09:22] going hear me you can hear me all right
[00:09:27] it's all I need to worry about you can
[00:09:29] hear
[00:09:32] me all
[00:09:34] right I don't want an
[00:09:37] echo so I'll put that
[00:09:40] there all righty everybody let's
[00:09:43] uh make sure that's pretty frustrating
[00:09:46] that it changes the volume so you can't
[00:09:48] see anything or drops of audio out on me
[00:09:51] like I have to like keep this up like
[00:09:53] this to be able to see to make sure I
[00:09:54] have the cam on correctly so I can see
[00:09:57] it there but that's okay I see it over
[00:09:59] here
[00:10:00] I can see it over
[00:10:03] here I don't want to listen to that so
[00:10:07] we don't want let's go like this and
[00:10:08] we're going to do this ourselves on
[00:10:10] YouTube for a little little bit if
[00:10:11] anybody wants to take a look and watch
[00:10:13] we're going to open up uh one of our
[00:10:15] Outlaws of Thunder Junction that we have
[00:10:16] this is one of the ones that we got from
[00:10:17] the store for the store itself we're
[00:10:20] going to open it this way because we've
[00:10:21] been having luck when we do it like this
[00:10:24] let's see if we get any
[00:10:26] more what's up hey
[00:10:30] audio issue things again yeah I'm just
[00:10:32] listening to you I hear you now you can
[00:10:35] because I have made I'm looking at it
[00:10:37] but showing for some reason there's no
[00:10:38] audio level even though there's
[00:10:40] definitely an audio level coming through
[00:10:42] I think that's what the issue is you
[00:10:44] know one two three four five six seven
[00:10:49] eight do that so we can see the spoilers
[00:10:52] at the end because I like seeing the
[00:10:53] spoilers at the end don't careful you

[00:14:50] game if you'd like to play it I don't
[00:14:52] know if you guys like a new angle here
[00:14:54] um if you do let me know I if anybody's
[00:14:56] watching anything on anywhere to to
[00:14:58] check it out
[00:15:00] but
[00:15:02] yeah everybody's stuff should be
[00:15:04] shipping out those that you well today
[00:15:06] well I can't get it out today because
[00:15:08] just you know weekend but uh it was all
[00:15:10] together to be shipped out so you'll get
[00:15:12] it next
[00:15:14] week those at our
[00:15:17] listing sorry there were some as you can
[00:15:20] understand some issues with getting
[00:15:21] information CU that happens all the time
[00:15:24] when uh with me here so
[00:15:30] all right we got this uh we got this out
[00:15:31] nothing special with this one little
[00:15:34] daring Thunder Chief flashback daring
[00:15:36] Thunder Chief enters the battlefield
[00:15:39] tapped nice uh not bad on that one if it
[00:15:43] didn't enter tapped it would be
[00:15:50] nice so makes flash kind of pointless
[00:15:53] why does it enter the battlefield tap
[00:15:55] because that means it can't can't do
[00:15:57] anything if it has Flash
[00:15:59] that's silly is it allowed to block
[00:16:01] still like that that' be something I'm
[00:16:03] unaware of maybe somebody can tell me
[00:16:06] that can somebody not attack
[00:16:09] it right after put it in maybe I can use
[00:16:12] it as a maybe you have a something that
[00:16:14] says you can direct your um like there's
[00:16:17] some of the cars that do allow you to
[00:16:18] direct your damage to something else so
[00:16:20] that would make sense if you flash it in
[00:16:21] you direct your damage to that card
[00:16:23] instead and then it will harm it harm it
[00:16:25] in a way because it has enough damage to
[00:16:26] control maybe that's what it's used as I
[00:16:28] don't know if you can do it that way
[00:16:30] though or maybe there's some cards that
[00:16:32] allow you to untap too you know what I
[00:16:34] mean there some CS that allow you to
[00:16:38] untap so I don't know maybe that's what
[00:16:40] it is I got a couple de decent little
[00:16:42] cards here we'll check some prices on
[00:16:44] these let's check some prices on this
[00:16:47] why not we'll see some prices on these
[00:16:49] and maybe we'll get one of these some of
[00:16:50] these out here for some singles in a
[00:16:52] little while play one of the singles
[00:16:53] games that we got going that we nor
[00:16:56] where me do
[00:16:59] anyways it's going to be a be a very
[00:17:02] slow slow day here for a
[00:17:05] while normal Sunday normal
[00:17:09] Sunday well that's what I'm saying even
[00:17:11] slower than normal is what I'm getting
[00:17:12] at yeah going be slower than normal but
[00:17:15] we'll see maybe we'll have some people
[00:17:17] that come in to hang out some other
[00:17:19] places let me uh let me do this like I
[00:17:21] was saying I want to check some pricing
[00:17:24] do you want to check some
[00:17:27] pricing all right in the background yeah

[00:17:33] weights are it's where your weights are
[00:17:36] yeah all
[00:17:40] right well that's okay well that's nice
[00:17:43] that you have the ability to do that and
[00:17:45] check price real quick I know it is
[00:17:49] actually yeah I don't think this is
[00:17:51] worth anything
[00:17:53] much but yes it is nice that I have the
[00:17:55] ability to go and check the price real
[00:17:57] quick on something and I can do like a
[00:17:58] new a game right away and have the
[00:18:00] prices out and

[00:18:12] here doing our thing seeing if you guys
[00:18:14] like it we don't know I know we're
[00:18:16] hanging out on YouTube at the moment
[00:18:18] some people will find me some most of
[00:18:20] you that some of you will some of you
[00:18:22] won't but it is early on a Sunday so I'm
[00:18:24] not going to really expect much if that
[00:18:27] makes any sense
[00:18:32] they're give they're iy day o' yeah
[00:18:35] they're a N9 o'clock
[00:18:39] start chur Church yeah I always forget
[00:18:43] about church because I stopped doing
[00:18:44] that when I went to a Catholic school I
[00:18:46] learned some things and that I never uh
[00:18:50] agreed with so I stopped going to church
[00:18:53] and also one of the things I know it's
[00:18:55] going to make people probably will not
[00:18:56] like me for saying this but I always the
[00:18:59] comment that if you um my understanding
[00:19:03] as you go to church one of the primary
[00:19:04] things is to ask for forgiveness from
[00:19:07] God so if you aren't doing things to be
[00:19:12] sinning then you shouldn't need to go to
[00:19:14] ask forgiveness ever so just don't do
[00:19:17] bad things don't sin I know you say
[00:19:19] everybody sins in different ways and
[00:19:20] different things on every single day but
[00:19:22] God never meant for you to be sinning
[00:19:24] just because you picked a booger out of
[00:19:26] your nose that was annoying you that
[00:19:29] like if he meant that then he was a
[00:19:32] pretty Petty person Petty the being and
[00:19:35] I don't think he
[00:19:36] was that's kind of why I was like you
[00:19:39] know what you don't need to go if you're
[00:19:40] not doing thing you're wrong people
[00:19:42] don't like me for that
[00:19:44] though then I used to also tell one of
[00:19:46] my my uh my religion teacher I used to
[00:19:48] argue that Jesus was an
[00:19:50] alien that one was fun that was more for
[00:19:52] fun though that was more for fun though
[00:19:55] and I think he knew it
[00:19:56] too because I I was sci-fi person so I
[00:20:00] always
[00:20:01] uh you know had some sci-fi references
[00:20:05] which was more a joke than anything and
[00:20:06] he I think he was getting along with it
[00:20:08] because he always had a good time with
[00:20:09] it because he he was actually into like
[00:20:11] those uh like the sci-fi and fantasy
[00:20:13] stuff he actually said at one point he
[00:20:16] could teach an entire um semester on how
[00:20:19] the Lord of the Rings is an analogy to
[00:20:22] the Bible or something like that I'm
[00:20:23] like all right I don't know if I want to
[00:20:24] be a part of that one you could make
[00:20:27] anything I know that's why said that's
[00:20:29] why I was like I was like you can turn
[00:20:30] anything to analogy it's like well it's
[00:20:32] like that guy remember how there was um
[00:20:34] the kid I told you that a kid was told
[00:20:36] to go and
[00:20:37] um write a a paper and he's like then he
[00:20:40] wrote a paper and the in the his teacher
[00:20:43] his English teacher in high school said
[00:20:44] it was wrong that's not that what the
[00:20:46] that's not what the person meant when he
[00:20:47] was writing the book he like how do you
[00:20:49] know you don't write the book with the
[00:20:50] person and argue with the teacher he's
[00:20:52] like well this is what they meant blah
[00:20:54] blah blah blah blah so he ended up
[00:20:55] sending a letter to them plus a few
[00:20:58] other
[00:20:59] authors that were still alive said hey
[00:21:01] what was the meaning of this blah blah
[00:21:02] blah blah you did this what did it mean
[00:21:03] here so he could actually know what it
[00:21:06] meant yeah came back and every single
[00:21:09] one of them came back like there was no
[00:21:11] meaning there it's a [ __ ]
[00:21:14] story every single one of the authors
[00:21:18] came back and said there's no meaning
[00:21:21] it's a
[00:21:22] story take you take from a story what
[00:21:25] you need in your moment of your life to
[00:21:27] impact you ever it is but the point of
[00:21:29] it was there was no meaning it was a
[00:21:31] story so this teacher was blowing smoke
[00:21:33] and making this kid say it was wrong
[00:21:35] which was like I saying when I was
[00:21:36] younger used to be can you argue your
[00:21:38] reasoning and why and if you can and it
[00:21:40] makes enough sense then you get then you
[00:21:43] are going to get an A on your paper
[00:21:45] versus you saying you it doesn't matter
[00:21:47] what your reasoning was it was a story
[00:21:49] and you interpret the story your way you
[00:21:52] had to support it with your evidence of
[00:21:53] why you interpret it for this reason and
[00:21:55] that was that was how it used to be now
[00:21:57] it's you have to interpret the way I
[00:21:59] tell you and if you don't you're wrong
[00:22:01] yeah see that's that's why um you can
[00:22:04] that's why complain the way I
[00:22:09] do that's why I think like the phras is
[00:22:12] help me understand huh help me I like
[00:22:15] that phrase that's how I phrase like I
[00:22:18] like to use no that's the phrase you
[00:22:19] like to use me
[00:22:21] understand so pretty much you're
[00:22:25] [ __ ] and you're you're wrong but
[00:22:28] I'll give you an opportunity to help me
[00:22:30] understand why you're saying that yep
[00:22:34] and if you can't help me understand then
[00:22:36] it's going to make you look like a fool
[00:22:37] because you can't explain it correct
[00:22:39] that's good that's good thing too good
[00:22:41] good point too didn't think about that
[00:22:45] yeah yeah but either
[00:22:48] way it's
[00:22:50] intriguing it's intriguing that's
[00:22:53] all I was found it
[00:22:57] fun I just wanted make sure I could
[00:23:00] hear my coffee I didn't feel so bad this
[00:23:03] morning you didn't no well that's good I

[00:23:22] land in like the special lands yeah the
[00:23:25] special art lands yeah yeah a lot of

[00:23:28] ourselves to put in our decks that we
[00:23:30] want so that's why I saying when we
[00:23:31] leave what we'll do is we'll take the
[00:23:33] cool things that we like and spice the
[00:23:35] decks up with them so they look cool and
[00:23:36] they're fun and we can play them with
[00:23:39] all of them sealed the ones that we want
[00:23:40] to keep we'll just bring those and if we
[00:23:42] find something somewhere we have to
[00:23:44] travel somewhere and they want it or
[00:23:46] [ __ ] it maybe we're um still in the US
[00:23:48] for a little while you
[00:23:50] know then I'm doing and we just play on
[00:23:52] here for a little
[00:23:54] bit you know I do it on the boat as we
[00:23:57] travel around the us areas for a little
[00:23:59] while get out and people know that it's
[00:24:02] going to be a week before they get their
[00:24:05] stuff because it's always going to ship
[00:24:07] International and no it's going to ship
[00:24:09] when we get back on this date so I do a
[00:24:11] show say we're wherever we are I'll do a
[00:24:14] show like Hey we're doing a show on this
[00:24:16] day I'm G be back in the US it's shipped
[00:24:17] that day it's all going to be packed up
[00:24:18] and shipped on this day on this day put
[00:24:20] it out that's whyi no literally shipping
[00:24:23] date is this time like let everybody
[00:24:25] know and if they want to join then do
[00:24:26] the game I do stuff and I do the
[00:24:29] adventure you know what I'm saying the
[00:24:30] adventure like you were saying I build
[00:24:31] my Adventures like people seem to like
[00:24:34] how sh that you stuff on the boat no I
[00:24:37] would have it I would have it all I
[00:24:39] wouldn't have packing stuff on the boat
[00:24:40] I would have like bags and stuff on the
[00:24:42] boat and then we would um we would just
[00:24:45] so like as we're in this area and we're
[00:24:47] going back and forth for the few first
[00:24:48] few months is what I'm saying yeah and
[00:24:50] then we'd come back and i' just had it
[00:24:51] like a box of the packing [ __ ] at my
[00:24:53] mom's house I pack it up and ship it out
[00:24:54] at [ __ ] new samarina when we get back
[00:24:56] here to visit or wherever we going back
[00:24:58] you know what I'm saying
[00:25:00] yeah because we the point of what I was
[00:25:03] thinking was go back and forth a few
[00:25:04] times to get everybody used to it then
[00:25:08] we can go after a little further you
[00:25:10] know what I mean yeah when we're here
[00:25:11] would we and we come back would we
[00:25:13] anchor somewhere or would we want to
[00:25:15] like I don't know if it's got a moing
[00:25:17] but or would we want to be at at a dock
[00:25:19] if it's only for a short time depends on
[00:25:21] how short and how much it is because I'm
[00:25:22] just worried about our river is not it
[00:25:24] depends on how short how depends really
[00:25:27] step yeah you know
[00:25:28] it depends they don't dredge enough no
[00:25:31] they don't necessarily T over by the
[00:25:33] South Causeway there's like four [ __ ]
[00:25:36] sunken no those are there because of all
[00:25:38] the poor and um people that stole them
[00:25:40] and tried to live on them um and then
[00:25:43] crashed them all the homeless people
[00:25:45] that's what that's from actually really
[00:25:48] yep how do you know that uh I
[00:25:50] investigated a little bit I looked into
[00:25:52] why there were so many of them around
[00:25:54] tried to figure it out like this is
[00:25:55] [ __ ] ridiculous that there's like six
[00:25:57] boats all over the place nothing's ever
[00:25:58] done with it well what the problem is is
[00:26:00] the guy's boat was stolen he always
[00:26:01] claim insurance it's done out of his
[00:26:03] hand anymore he's not touching that
[00:26:05] thing because it was stolen yeah and
[00:26:07] then they go and they crash it and it
[00:26:09] stays there and no one touches it
[00:26:11] because that person's homeless and they
[00:26:14] bounce or the boat's barely living in
[00:26:17] the first place but they consider it
[00:26:19] they can still register it for dirt
[00:26:21] cheap and they live on it and then they
[00:26:23] hit something or they or it just sinks
[00:26:25] because it's old that was two of them
[00:26:27] sunk just because they were old and
[00:26:29] trunk junk and probably should have been
[00:26:30] out there but people that were not they
[00:26:32] were just they were poor that they
[00:26:33] couldn't they couldn't afford to live
[00:26:34] which is that's fine but at the same
[00:26:36] time like you can't just leave a [ __ ]
[00:26:39] boat in the middle of the river people
[00:26:41] can though I mean luckily the ones that
[00:26:43] are in the middle of the river are over
[00:26:45] where it's super shallow and you can
[00:26:46] tell where the Hurricanes really shifted
[00:26:49] the sand yeah let's put out a
[00:26:53] new new thing here let's put out this

[00:48:00] Junction right
[00:48:03] there um
[00:48:05] forgot got to uh copy the
[00:48:15] name got to copy the

[00:49:07] just keep adjusting it every now and
[00:49:09] again I
[00:49:11] guess and then maybe I'm maybe if I

[01:01:40] little bit thing in the distance you go
[01:01:41] wonderful I'm going to go grab that I
[01:01:42] think I'm gonna have something awesome

[01:01:47] picks up treasure and that treasure is
[01:01:49] booby trapped it's not good they lose
[01:01:53] two of their four fingers and they end

[01:01:57] left
[01:01:59] hand whatever they're mutant math
[01:02:01] doesn't matter math doesn't matter that
[01:02:04] leaves him only at one strength though
[01:02:06] that's okay you can still gain some of
[01:02:07] that strength back here

[01:02:37] you and even though they had some of it
[01:02:39] there to get away with you drop what you
[01:02:41] did capture and you end up losing all of
[01:02:43] your strength because he stabs you in
[01:02:45] the back as you run away and you are at
[01:02:47] only zero strength but lucky you're
[01:02:49] alive you see a vault in the distance

[01:08:33] camera where did the camera go give me
[01:08:35] one second guys
[01:08:38] sorry what happened to the
[01:08:48] camera yeah it's in live stream mode

[01:09:18] saying yes I can hear you in my earbud
[01:09:20] oh nice I don't have the microphone on
[01:09:22] that's coming from the camera
[01:09:26] this is what I'm saying does it sound
[01:09:27] like crap or not or does the camera
[01:09:29] sound better I mean the other thing
[01:09:30] sound better
[01:09:34] R well you sound clear but I can't do it
[01:09:37] because I'm hearing you in person and in
[01:09:38] my ear yeah random oh I sound good
[01:09:41] random is thank
[01:09:45] you random isi says it's good it just
[01:09:47] switched the camera when I went over
[01:09:50] instead of going when I got the camera
[01:09:51] back set up I actually think it sounds
[01:09:53] better than the microphone yeah oh
[01:09:55] really well ask your ask your people
[01:09:57] well do they sound better than what it
[01:09:59] before did it did it sound better than
[01:10:00] right before the camera
[01:10:02] disappeared does it sound better now
[01:10:04] than than when before the camera
[01:10:06] disappear because if it does that's
[01:10:08] actually here you go
[01:10:11] random and then your pack here do you
[01:10:14] want me to open that or not most people
[01:10:15] want me to ship those home it does sound
[01:10:17] better wow all right well then I might
[01:10:20] just use the camera microphone from now
[01:10:22] on and unplug that one I wonder if I can
[01:10:25] return that one then I wonder if that's
[01:10:26] in my window to return it so if it's in
[01:10:28] my window return then I'm going to
[01:10:29] return that other microphone if this F
[01:10:30] the other camera one works better that's
[01:10:33] pretty cool
[01:10:37] there that's nice that's nice that it
[01:10:40] works better all right now we're GNA do
[01:10:43] this um I thought I had that running
[01:10:45] there where was it mystery Ah that's why
[01:10:49] we're going to run our Mysteries we're
[01:10:50] going to do a flash sale we're going to
[01:10:53] discount them by this
[01:10:56] you know we're going to discount them by
[01:10:57] this actually we're going to do a flash
[01:10:58] sale on five of them for five
[01:11:03] minutes there we go five of them for
[01:11:05] five minutes on a little mystery bag
[01:11:07] flash
[01:11:08] sale then I'll throw out another one of
[01:11:11] the adventure games which is what we
[01:11:12] said we were going to do before was the
[01:11:14] Iaria collect the booster so we're going
[01:11:17] to create a new one we're going to do a
[01:11:19] screenshot we going to move that back
[01:11:21] here so you can see it screenshot there
[01:11:24] you go
[01:11:27] this is going to
[01:11:29] be past packed and Wasteland
[01:11:33] Adventure magic we're gonna do that all
[01:11:35] right Adam likes the idea of the game so
[01:11:38] maybe we will try it out there I think
[01:11:39] this was uh what was this price give me
[01:11:41] one second the price of these changed
[01:11:43] because I had to buy them and I think
[01:11:45] actually lowered as got on there because
[01:11:47] I think I might have actually got them a
[01:11:48] little cheaper but I need to double
[01:11:49] check for you
[01:11:52] guys yes they were a little cheaper
[01:11:56] nice so I get to put them on a little
[01:11:58] cheaper for you
[01:12:00] all I didn't realize that there you go
[01:12:02] we'll throw that on there we'll throw it
[01:12:04] on why not five minutes again and we'll
[01:12:06] talk about some of the stuff that I was
[01:12:07] doing
[01:12:09] though so there you are that's if you
[01:12:11] want an ioria blister right there you
[01:12:14] got some fun we'll play that Adventure
[01:12:15] game again yeah so what I was thinking
[01:12:17] people like semi Adventure game and they
[01:12:19] were liking the other one so I was
[01:12:21] thinking what I would end up doing was
[01:12:23] um care if somebody wants it say
[01:12:25] somebody wants to jump in on this I'll
[01:12:26] run it in like 30 seconds or 10 seconds
[01:12:28] if somebody does want the ioria but I
[01:12:30] want to give a little explanation I
[01:12:32] figure you guys would like it that um so
[01:12:34] the adventure game the way that we don't
[01:12:35] end up doing that is I would have like
[01:12:37] the whole game would be the entire
[01:12:40] morning the hours I'm doing it in the
[01:12:42] morning would be the entire Adventure it
[01:12:44] start out like the first 10 20 minutes
[01:12:46] we would be building the characters
[01:12:47] whoever buys into buy stuff would help
[01:12:49] build the characters and we would have
[01:12:51] either two or three Char I was thinking
[01:12:54] two to start character
[01:12:55] so you'd have two characters like maybe
[01:12:57] a
[01:12:57] Mage and a warrior Ty thing like a mage
[01:13:01] R like a range person Mage and like a
[01:13:03] warrior tank type thing and then we
[01:13:06] would uh you'd help build those
[01:13:07] characters and then we would go through
[01:13:09] the adventure as those two
[01:13:12] characters um and um see what happens
[01:13:15] and if you guys like doing that maybe I
[01:13:17] do longer shows where I do what's a like
[01:13:19] a long show where it's a whole um you
[01:13:21] know like a three four hour one where I
[01:13:23] do type thing I maybe you guys like that
[01:13:25] some people like the dungeon dragons
[01:13:26] thing so I figured I'd try it out a
[01:13:28] little bit because people were liking
[01:13:29] the dungeon dragon theme that I have to
[01:13:31] my stories I guess I do a good story I
[01:13:34] was
[01:13:39] told so all right that's cool that the
[01:13:42] microphone's better on that that's
[01:13:43] awesome that the microphone's better on
[01:13:45] that that's really actually very sweet
[01:13:48] that the microphone's even better on
[01:13:50] that yeah it's less things to yeah less
[01:13:53] stuff to have to worry about carrying
[01:13:54] around
[01:13:55] anywhere all I need to do if I ever
[01:13:57] stream and do anything is the microphone
[01:13:59] on this is going to work for me yeah and
[01:14:01] you have the M I have the Muff also to
[01:14:04] put on for um for if there's bad you
[01:14:06] know wind and stuff yep yep exactly well
[01:14:11] I change you're gonna go change all
[01:14:14] right let's see let's do some of the
[01:14:15] other stuff here I'm going to go through
[01:14:16] some of the singles that I have guys and
[01:14:18] the way I like to do this is if you want

[01:14:23] them off the side with your name on it

[01:27:21] what I the whole I will tell you this
[01:27:24] the reason why we started doing this was
[01:27:26] my son William wanted to open up packs
[01:27:28] of cards and I am not a wealthy person
[01:27:31] and I can't afford to do that so I
[01:27:34] offered uh I was like if you can find a
[01:27:36] way that we can afford to do it I'll do
[01:27:38] it and we he found a way for us to sell
[01:27:40] some stuff online here hanging out with
[01:27:42] you guys so that's kind of what our
[01:27:44] thing is and that we
[01:27:45] do I'll do
[01:27:47] this where did we put that did you just
[01:27:51] dro the um thing hey Will
[01:27:56] where did you put the pack sleeve I mean
[01:27:58] the pack itself the en did you throw it

[01:28:10] dropped it where you can't just drop
[01:28:12] trash in my office I dropped it here
[01:28:14] somewhere and then you must have took it
[01:28:16] did I pick it up and move it I don't
[01:28:18] know am I going nuts

[01:29:55] here got a saying
[01:30:00] before was it supposed to run now I
[01:30:02] supposed to do at the end of the show so
[01:30:03] that's why I keep adding some stuff to
[01:30:05] it but I'll be on for a little while
[01:30:06] here not too too long because we do have
[01:30:08] stuff to do
[01:30:10] today don't forget yes you can Jo during
[01:30:12] the
[01:30:15] giveaway oh nice see I play commander
[01:30:18] and Lana too so
[01:30:22] um with Commander um I what I like to do
[01:30:25] is I like to buy some like I'm not a I
[01:30:28] haven't there's one deck that I'm trying
[01:30:30] to build that would be like a killer
[01:30:31] deck but I that's it's only because I
[01:30:34] have the nine nasou and that's it other
[01:30:36] than that I wouldn't be doing anything
[01:30:38] like that uh I just buy the preons and I
[01:30:41] upgrade them I'm not like big into
[01:30:42] playing tournaments I want to have fun
[01:30:43] with my friends and family that's really
[01:30:45] what I do so let me throw out another
[01:30:48] one here a little bit of a different
[01:30:50] one so that's why I like to play like so
[01:30:53] like for me it's not anything over the
[01:30:54] top see what I wanted to do actually my
[01:30:57] initial idea to start this is um we were
[01:30:59] doing a good job with all this have a
[01:31:01] lot of fun and people were people I had
[01:31:05] more people joining and they liked
[01:31:06] everything that was going on and what I
[01:31:07] was trying to do was eventually I was
[01:31:10] going to um make it so that I could
[01:31:14] either like I could stream remotely and
[01:31:15] I would have a store and the person we
[01:31:17] open the packs and I could be wherever I
[01:31:19] was streaming and stuff
[01:31:25] because I said ever before if you heard
[01:31:27] me I was in here because I was giving
[01:31:30] that away at the end of the show and it
[01:31:32] keeps for some reason it didn't let me
[01:31:34] it went to none and when um something
[01:31:36] happened when I came back in with the
[01:31:37] camera and reset it um so that's why I
[01:31:40] was supposed to be that way and I um
[01:31:44] that's why I did
[01:31:47] that yeah about random fun
[01:31:50] Adam yeah say you play casual with a
[01:31:53] bunch of guys a guy
[01:31:54] so um that's why I done that um I was
[01:31:56] planning on doing it at the end of the
[01:31:58] show but for whatever reason it didn't
[01:32:01] let me it it went on and it started at
[01:32:03] 30 30 minutes randomly when I came in
[01:32:05] here at one point that's
[01:32:11] why um but anyways with the um let me do
[01:32:15] this here and I did I've said that
[01:32:16] multiple times here anyways
[01:32:19] too I have said that multiple times here
[01:32:22] I don't know why I was like I consider
[01:32:24] that a glitch because it was something
[01:32:25] that I didn't do let me uh let me do
[01:32:28] this
[01:32:29] here for you guys so that you have an
[01:32:32] understanding of I'll put this up so you
[01:32:34] can see what the um if you want to do
[01:32:36] the adventure game you can understand
[01:32:38] kind of what it helps with and what you
[01:32:39] get for strength and everything this is
[01:32:42] a this will be a no that's not it 0
[01:32:48] five all right let's do that I'm going
[01:32:50] to do a screenshot of this here
[01:32:54] give me one second I know I can't see
[01:32:56] you I'm just um doing something quickly
[01:32:59] so that you all can see what they have
[01:33:01] for packs and stuff nice and
[01:33:04] easily because I had done this before
[01:33:07] but for some reason it didn't come
[01:33:13] back where's my
[01:33:17] chat weird I went right into it and like
[01:33:20] I normally hit none and I'll run it like
[01:33:22] at the end of the I'll on it at the end
[01:33:24] and for some reason it went in and did
[01:33:26] 30 right away like what the hell is
[01:33:28] going
[01:33:29] on like it was just an odd thing an odd
[01:33:31] like you said an odd situation so let me
[01:33:34] um let me do this here I gotta do my
[01:33:38] snipping
[01:33:43] screenshot
[01:33:45] capture all right save that minimize
[01:33:51] everything that way I can see the
[01:33:53] background
[01:33:57] so I can do this put it in here already
[01:34:00] did a screenshot well look at
[01:34:03] that now I can do
[01:34:05] this give one second to add it in here I
[01:34:08] know I'm not paying attention you guys
[01:34:10] it's just because I want to put the
[01:34:11] image in so I can
[01:34:14] see what I have for packs available the
[01:34:17] pricing should be correct on them I just
[01:34:19] need to double check
[01:34:21] actually let me double check
[01:34:25] pricing should be
[01:34:29] right oh I need to add one thing
[01:34:42] in is this and
[01:34:48] [Music]
[01:34:49] then is this
[01:34:55] there we
[01:34:58] go forgot to add those in sorry I need
[01:35:01] to make a quick
[01:35:03] adjustment need to make a quick
[01:35:04] adjustment
[01:35:10] there need to make a quick
[01:35:14] adjustment there you go be able to see
[01:35:17] that now or not where'd it
[01:35:21] go son of a [ __ ]
[01:35:28] cancel didn't It Go in give me one
[01:35:30] second I'm being silly I know I'm not
[01:35:34] ignoring you on purpose I'm trying to
[01:35:35] make this
[01:35:37] better trying to make it easier for you
[01:35:39] all actually is what I'm trying to
[01:35:42] do browse why is that
[01:35:45] showing desktop
[01:35:52] screenshot open
[01:35:55] here you go that way you can see what we
[01:35:57] have for packs available if you want
[01:36:00] anything and let me do this to do a
[01:36:02] quick thing here because this is
[01:36:04] supposed to be on
[01:36:07] here I'm going to do
[01:36:10] [Music]
[01:36:16] this there we go that so you can see
[01:36:20] them or not if you want a question on
[01:36:22] them ah trying to make it easier for you
[01:36:24] guys to see everything that we have
[01:36:28] that's what I was trying to do there
[01:36:29] hopefully that worked a little bit I
[01:36:31] don't know if it
[01:36:37] did drip is kind of a new app for me
[01:36:40] drip is a new app for me uh it's not a
[01:36:43] newer app it's been around for a little
[01:36:45] while but it's a newer one for me to be
[01:36:47] using sometimes I had some glitches like
[01:36:49] even like like for instance my
[01:36:51] microphone um for well switch random and
[01:36:54] I'll go to be silent so like things like
[01:36:56] that happen so it is a little bit newer
[01:36:59] um so there are some weird things that
[01:37:01] occur I can't always help it but hey
[01:37:05] what can you do what can you do I just
[01:37:07] do my best to have some
[01:37:09] fun all right let me do this here I'm
[01:37:11] going to push all that back I'm actually
[01:37:13] going to move these out of the way
[01:37:14] because the adventure game kind of takes
[01:37:16] up a little bit of space so I like to do
[01:37:18] this and move it over here a little bit
[01:37:20] out of the way that way I have a whole
[01:37:23] back area open here so you can see a
[01:37:26] little bit farther I do like to move
[01:37:28] that one a little bit over there too CU
[01:37:30] that was our different game which I
[01:37:31] actually forgot to put out I have
[01:37:33] another game I have so many games I
[01:37:36] forget to put them out there was one
[01:37:38] that one was the outlaw game that my son
[01:37:39] had come up with it's kind of like a
[01:37:41] pack break but I hadn't had the
[01:37:43] animations done yet so that's what it is
[01:37:45] this is our giveaway one I'm just
[01:37:46] putting that right there so everybody
[01:37:47] sees that off the side you know what I'm
[01:37:50] going to put that way back there that's
[01:37:52] that way it's just way way back there
[01:37:53] you can still see that it's just way way
[01:37:55] way back there then you can see the
[01:37:57] other stuff that I have a little
[01:38:00] bit then I can put those two up here
[01:38:02] create a new
[01:38:05] auction yeah drip isn't necessarily a
[01:38:07] new app but it's a newer one for me to
[01:38:09] be using and I think that's what it
[01:38:11] is I just maybe I got to get used to it
[01:38:14] could have been me doing something wrong
[01:38:15] too or it could have been a glitch
[01:38:16] because I know I set it to none and
[01:38:18] whenever I set it to none it doesn't
[01:38:20] take none either so that's the other
[01:38:22] thing too you're supposed to be able to
[01:38:23] set it
[01:38:24] um but it doesn't for some
[01:38:38] reason all right hold on I got to put
[01:38:40] this in
[01:38:42] here all right cancel that cancel that
[01:38:46] go back

[02:12:41] joins how long have I been playing I've
[02:12:43] been playing I played magic when I was

[02:12:59] some fun I don't
[02:13:02] care
[02:13:03] so this if you can see it is my box of
[02:13:07] magic cards from
[02:13:09] 1995 quite old you can see it's a little
[02:13:12] bit Stained on the top there it's been
[02:13:14] around for uh from 1995 I drew this when
[02:13:18] I was a eight-year-old no a
[02:13:21] 11-year-old child all right these are my
[02:13:24] cards from back
[02:13:26] then now you see all the products and
[02:13:29] things that are being given away right
[02:13:30] now so we'll open some of this up here
[02:13:32] but like I have this is literally my
[02:13:34] Decks that I played with when I was
[02:13:36] younger all right these are not good
[02:13:38] decks because I was poor I did not have
[02:13:42] money I was a poor child so I ended up
[02:13:45] having to just do what I uh I had to you
[02:13:47] know make do with what I
[02:13:48] had uh so but luckily I you know grown
[02:13:51] doing a little bit better in our life
[02:13:52] now but here like this is what I used to
[02:13:54] this is a deck that I played with when I
[02:13:56] was younger and this was obviously with
[02:13:59] the 60 cards because we don't do more
[02:14:00] than 60 cards back then it was only 60
[02:14:03] cards then but I ended up putting them
[02:14:05] all in sleeves when I found them my kids
[02:14:07] like oh that's awesome so I took them
[02:14:09] all and I put them all in sleeves to
[02:14:10] protect them but like look this is the
[02:14:11] deck that I played with back in
[02:14:14] 1995 this is my green and uh Blue Deck I
[02:14:17] had I know it's a weird combination but
[02:14:20] it worked against a couple of the people
[02:14:22] that I played with so that's what I mean
[02:14:24] like I don't have like my some of these
[02:14:26] cards as you can see they're in pretty
[02:14:28] decent condition I took care of them
[02:14:30] even though we did shuffle them and
[02:14:31] everything I took really good care of
[02:14:33] all my
[02:14:35] cards but like yeah got some decent
[02:14:37] stuff in here I don't have anything over
[02:14:40] the top expensive just because I didn't
[02:14:42] have like I said I didn't have a lot of
[02:14:43] money so what I had was like very basic
[02:14:48] cheap cards I could get a lot of
[02:14:50] homelands which is actually why I have
[02:14:51] homelands in um here was because it was
[02:14:54] one of the first t packs that I remember
[02:14:56] buying at the store to try to upgrade
[02:14:59] decks when I was younger because that
[02:15:01] was a cheap Pack and I only couple
[02:15:03] dollars all the
[02:15:05] time D I did yeah you can see like look
[02:15:07] at how they like look at this card this
[02:15:09] is a forest card that I use all the
[02:15:12] time
[02:15:15] 1995 look at that card I could have
[02:15:18] pulled that out of a pack today
[02:15:21] I played with this
[02:15:23] card I literally played with this card
[02:15:26] on a regular basis look at
[02:15:29] that that could have been pulled out of
[02:15:31] a pack today they didn't have sleeves on
[02:15:34] them when I was a kid
[02:15:36] either because we didn't have those type
[02:15:38] of things I didn't have the money and I
[02:15:39] didn't buy
[02:15:40] them but I mean you can see some of my
[02:15:43] cards do have some dings on them those
[02:15:45] ones were generally the ones that I
[02:15:46] traded for too so like I remember I had
[02:15:49] to trade for a woolly mammoth and I had
[02:15:50] some marks on it so like that's not my
[02:15:52] card that's somebody
[02:15:54] else's but yeah I took pretty good care
[02:15:56] of all my
[02:16:00] stuff love the illusionary wall that was
[02:16:03] one that was my favorite ones to play
[02:16:04] hard one to get out
[02:16:08] though seating charm that was always a
[02:16:11] good one too there little brainstorm see
[02:16:14] as you can see the cards even the ones
[02:16:16] being played every I played these three
[02:16:18] times a week with my friends and you can
[02:16:21] see they were never look at how how good
[02:16:22] condition they are yeah I did care about
[02:16:25] them thank you definitely did I care I
[02:16:27] was
[02:16:28] um long story short my family started
[02:16:32] out we were homeless at one point in my
[02:16:33] life I actually have pictures of me
[02:16:35] swinging in a tree in front of our um
[02:16:38] trailer which was one of the first
[02:16:39] houses that houses I remember living in
[02:16:42] so with that being said whenever I did
[02:16:44] get a chance to get something you had to
[02:16:47] take care of it because you weren't
[02:16:49] going to get something again
[02:16:51] you were lucky to get that one thing at
[02:16:53] all in the first place so you you took
[02:16:56] care of it you made sure I mean look
[02:16:59] this is the literally the Box this is
[02:17:01] the original box from
[02:17:04] 1995 that I use to keep everything in
[02:17:08] and you can even see look at the
[02:17:09] packaging the wrapper is still on
[02:17:12] it I'm sorry got a little sidet track on
[02:17:15] some reminiscing
[02:17:16] there I probably lost a bunch of people
[02:17:19] because of that but that's okay
[02:17:24] even though I'm trying to sell stuff I
[02:17:25] am just trying to have some fun because
[02:17:29] life does suck and you might as well try
[02:17:31] to have some fun as much you can but
[02:17:34] anyways those are some of my cards I got
[02:17:36] a whole box of them here from back when
[02:17:38] I was a kid some fun things going back
[02:17:42] in time a
[02:17:45] little there you go no one wanted to do
[02:17:49] the adventure with uh with
[02:17:52] these maybe we'll uh maybe we'll do an
[02:17:54] adventure with something different let's
[02:17:57] grab
[02:17:58] out an actual English
[02:18:02] ioria collector booster but we only have
[02:18:05] blisters of those we only have blisters
[02:18:07] of
[02:18:08] those and I'm going to re I'm going to
[02:18:11] be done with that going select from shop
[02:18:14] where is that I know I have it in here
[02:18:17] already there you go we're going to
[02:18:19] start that
[02:18:21] here you go see if you guys want any of
[02:18:23] that now if you do like these things I
[02:18:26] can actually make them go a little
[02:18:27] quicker too we can change them around
[02:18:29] quicker you don't need to have them go
[02:18:31] like this but uh yeah thank you I
[02:18:33] appreciate you coming in and hanging out
[02:18:38] Gustavo yes they are Treasures of some
[02:18:41] kind that I do have there that is true
[02:18:43] that is true for those of you that do
[02:18:45] come in I'm going to put this up there
[02:18:46] and actually make that smaller so it's
[02:18:48] not taking over the screen
[02:18:56] what is this other thing characters no
[02:18:59] go away
[02:19:02] characters do that we're going to shrink
[02:19:04] that down a little bit I'll put it right
[02:19:05] here that way you can see it what we
[02:19:08] have for packs available if you want to
[02:19:10] do the Wasteland Adventure yourself I
[02:19:12] think that is everything I have
[02:19:13] foodborne
[02:19:16] englands oh I have Inland boosters in
[02:19:18] there twice oh ioria boosters IFR set I
[02:19:22] do LCI draft I have all draft LCI set oh
[02:19:27] I have um some wow set too I need to put
[02:19:30] in
[02:19:30] there collector boosters
[02:19:34] here you have
[02:19:39] those y May pip HML
[02:19:44] Homeland have those have those have
[02:19:46] those have those have those have those
[02:19:48] so I think I am here correct the only
[02:19:50] thing I need add is Wilds about drain
[02:19:52] set we need Wilds about drain set to add
[02:19:55] in
[02:20:04] here yes exactly see like no that cards
[02:20:08] those cards aren't necessarily worth
[02:20:09] anything for me they're not worth a lot
[02:20:11] for anyone I'll put it here here's an
[02:20:14] example of how I treat
[02:20:17] everything okay these are junk card that
[02:20:21] are not worth anything much more than 10
[02:20:25] cents some of them maybe 5 cents some of
[02:20:28] them even less every single one of them
[02:20:31] I put in a sleeve
[02:20:33] here it's because I feel they should be
[02:20:37] protected and it's a penny or less for
[02:20:39] the box of sleeves and what happens is I
[02:20:42] will send I'll even sometimes these are
[02:20:43] given away like on the other shows that
[02:20:45] I do I'll do these as giveaways
[02:20:47] sometimes and like I'll give them away
[02:20:48] and say thank you and like the kids will
[02:20:50] sign a card or something like that like
[02:20:53] on the other shows that I do these are
[02:20:55] the giveaways that we do we do like one
[02:20:57] of the children will sign a card or I
[02:20:59] will sign a card a card that you can use
[02:21:01] and play with and then we do like
[02:21:02] another extra one with it like maybe
[02:21:04] it's a you know a foil or a special card
[02:21:06] of some kind we have those in our those
[02:21:09] are some of our giveaway things that we
[02:21:14] do but anyways everything works a lot
[02:21:17] better here by the way other than like
[02:21:19] some random glitches
[02:21:21] it works actually a lot better on this
[02:21:22] station it seems Seth what everything
[02:21:25] works technically a lot better
[02:21:28] yeah it's because it's scared for
[02:21:30] everybody not to the select yeah well
[02:21:33] I'm trying to get a oh do you add an
[02:21:35] address and were you able to do what I
[02:21:36] said um I screenshot it again no still
[02:21:39] wouldn't go
[02:21:41] through I even changed my uh my display
[02:21:44] name and everything yeah you need to
[02:21:45] change what I need what somebody needs
[02:21:46] to do is create a thing without a new
[02:21:49] device so like one of the tablets mhm
[02:21:52] set it up with your mom sing and see
[02:21:53] what happens if they're blocking it out
[02:21:55] that way see what they're doing and then
[02:21:56] maybe even put on the um the
[02:22:00] uh the VPN and see what they're doing
[02:22:02] because that's very suspicious what
[02:22:04] they're doing yeah very very suspicious
[02:22:06] what they're do everybody else but not
[02:22:07] them correct there's certain people that
[02:22:08] they can't be reported they're not
[02:22:10] allowed to be reported which is really
[02:22:12] really illegal I'm pretty sure

[02:47:54] for instance you pull out number 24
[02:47:58] you're going to get a wasteland it's
[02:47:59] hard for me to show these all like
[02:48:02] that you pull out number 22 you're going
[02:48:05] to get a
[02:48:06] uh bag end with a
[02:48:10] two of the mystery

[02:48:39] a uh mystery booster with it also this
[02:48:43] is what I mean like this is a good deal
[02:48:44] on all of these you need a Homeland with

[02:52:11] that
[02:52:13] um they are not cheap here by any by any
[02:52:16] means they've been going up even more
[02:52:18] more too
[02:52:20] so
[02:52:22] yeah they used to be um a lot better but
[02:52:25] recently since Co [ __ ] everything's gone
[02:52:30] up
[02:52:33] gun so yeah it goes up every it's gone
[02:52:35] up every it has gone up kind of
[02:52:37] everywhere I don't know what it is for
[02:52:38] you but hey give me an example like
[02:52:40] whats for
[02:52:42] you like when you went to go to the O um
[02:52:48] when you went and did the um Outlaws of
[02:52:50] Thunder Junction how much was it for the
[02:52:53] um
[02:52:55] [Music]
[02:53:00] pre-release let
[02:53:03] me minus
[02:53:05] that that
[02:53:11] there that there
[02:53:14] [Music]
[02:53:20] I pay 200 for all right I can check oh
[02:53:23] you going to check the conversion thank
[02:53:24] you thank you I was about I was like I'm
[02:53:26] go check the conversion there you know
[02:53:29] hey that was
[02:53:32] um $350 cents more than I paid so it
[02:53:36] wasn't that big of a difference actually
[02:53:39] Gustavo so for pre-release that actually
[02:53:41] isn't that big of a difference for it
[02:53:43] for you down there
[02:53:52] interesting because I thought about um
[02:53:55] like when I travel picking up packs
[02:53:57] around the world because all right so my
[02:53:59] um plan that my family and I are going
[02:54:01] to be doing here um the end of when my
[02:54:04] my son has his birthday uh in July after
[02:54:07] his birthday we're going to be on a boat
[02:54:09] traveling around the world our first
[02:54:11] place what we're going to stop will be
[02:54:12] in the Bahamas for a little while learn
[02:54:14] it learn the boat a little bit more I've
[02:54:15] been on a boat my entire life my father
[02:54:17] was a fisherman so I was always doing
[02:54:20] stuff that's what I've always wanted to
[02:54:34] do yeah yeah I get what you get I
[02:54:36] completely understand that yes yes you
[02:54:39] get 100,000 r a month 200 200 is
[02:54:41] definitely very expensive I definitely
[02:54:43] get that like price-wise it is the same
[02:54:46] but conversion wise for you yes it is
[02:54:48] big
[02:54:50] difference so it's like similar price
[02:54:53] but it's just a big difference on like
[02:54:54] cost on things I understand that yeah I
[02:54:57] um I've been looking we've been looking
[02:55:00] to travel and one of I actually want to
[02:55:02] go to Brazil just I've always wanted
[02:55:04] to um but I don't know about anymore

[02:55:08] the stuff going on some headaches going
[02:55:10] on over there you don't want to deal
[02:55:11] with it if that makes
[02:55:14] sense not at the moment give it some
[02:55:16] time first before it goes

[02:55:33] um from a distributor so that's why I'm
[02:55:34] able to get it pretty close to the same
[02:55:36] price it's either $ six to seven
[02:55:38] sometimes you might be able to see them
[02:55:40] a little bit cheaper somewhere but
[02:55:41] generally six6 OR7 for him

[02:57:29] actually have always wanted that's one
[02:57:30] of the few things I wanted to do like
[02:57:31] I've actually tried to go on my own
[02:57:34] little trips and do some things and I've
[02:57:35] thought about doing myself before but uh
[02:57:39] this will be better to do it with the
[02:57:40] family if we actually if it actually
[02:57:43] happens we actually end up leaving on
[02:57:45] the date that we made the date of yeah
[02:57:48] well we got to a couple things major
[02:57:49] things in order major things in order
[02:57:51] can be done in that time
[02:57:53] frame house house can be done have to
[02:57:55] sell it house will be sold in a month or
[02:57:58] less if
[02:58:00] we yeah price is going to be the
[02:58:02] dictator of some of the things we can do
[02:58:05] then that determines the boat yeah What
[02:58:08] boat we GNA get so that's why I was
[02:58:09] saying we need to get on the market so
[02:58:11] we have a better idea of what we'll be
[02:58:13] able to get get towards it I know we
[02:58:15] need to dedicate some time you're going
[02:58:17] to be doing some morning shows our
[02:58:19] evenings dedicated to well I have to do
[02:58:21] some evenings too here to get rid of
[02:58:23] stuff to do them to do the other things
[02:58:25] you know Tuesdays and Thursdays are
[02:58:27] great days to do evenings I'm not
[02:58:29] home for one yes I know everybody knows
[02:58:32] it's either Spanish or Portuguese I do
[02:58:34] have to realize so one of the things
[02:58:35] that we're going to do when we start
[02:58:36] traveling is I was thinking of doing
[02:58:38] like there's an app called Babel to kind
[02:58:40] of learn a little bit to learn some
[02:58:41] language of
[02:58:45] everyone hey that's okay if I need to
[02:58:48] repeat anything don't ever say to ask
[02:58:51] all right
[02:58:54] bud it's pretty cool though what just
[02:58:58] that it's cool that I can talk to people
[02:59:00] around the
[02:59:01] world yeah the platforms are out there
[02:59:04] like that that can do this you know yeah
[02:59:06] CU I I've talked to a guy from South
[02:59:07] Africa and he told me when next time
[02:59:09] when we going around on our boat to stop
[02:59:11] by and talk to him his family does
[02:59:13] sailing and he would they would love to
[02:59:14] hang out with us talk to us just because
[02:59:16] I was doing this stuff on here doing D
[02:59:18] and D things and playing Magic and I was
[02:59:20] like that's awesome that's cool that's
[02:59:22] that's like years down the road though I
[02:59:24] know that's years down the road but I
[02:59:25] even told him that's gonna be for not
[02:59:27] for five to 10 years dude he's like that
[02:59:28] doesn't matter come and hang out but my
[02:59:30] point is like that's the people I know
[02:59:33] that that you can meet there's some good
[02:59:34] people Babel yeah I think it's uh Babel
[02:59:37] correct it's Babble that's the one I was
[02:59:39] looking at to try they don't teach you
[02:59:41] words they teach you phrases yeah they
[02:59:42] teach you phrases not necessary words
[02:59:43] that's what it is they teach you the
[02:59:44] language so it's like you're living
[02:59:46] places you're more up faster yeah yeah

[03:24:10] there how have you

[03:24:16] issue there hopefully they what not help
[03:24:19] you and squar it away but I will tell
[03:24:21] you one thing though um they have done
[03:24:23] some interesting things where
[03:24:27] um certain people are not allowed to
[03:24:29] have warnings put on them even though
[03:24:31] they're doing things wrong I'm not going
[03:24:33] to list them but you can guess some of
[03:24:36] the people that may be and they probably
[03:24:37] have I'm guessing they have some people
[03:24:39] that what not in their pocket which is
[03:24:41] why they Ed a lie to suspend
[03:24:45] me sorry for saying that on here I
[03:24:47] probably going to get in
[03:24:49] trouble but I'm not going to do that
[03:24:51] anymore because I'm tired of that crap
[03:24:54] so I don't want to deal with it anymore
[03:24:56] so we're going to do an adventure
[03:24:58] game this is what our adventure game is

[03:25:53] [Music]
[03:25:58] it yeah I can't do anything about it
[03:26:00] because I I'm literally have no access
[03:26:02] to anything I try to go and log in and
[03:26:05] it tells me
[03:26:07] so I don't even know what they did I'm
[03:26:09] somebody I out lied about something
[03:26:11] which is unbelievable they lied about
[03:26:14] what is visible right there at all
[03:26:17] times every single YouTube that is saved
[03:26:20] that I stream to is saved and they're
[03:26:23] all there visible so I don't know what
[03:26:27] happened I'm really I was thoroughly
[03:26:29] thoroughly confused on that one that was
[03:26:32] one of those like how how did that
[03:26:36] occur I don't know
[03:26:38] weird but what can you do
[03:26:42] right what can you do but I plan on
[03:26:45] we'll be doing that uh the the ixon
[03:26:47] booster kind of the end of the show here
[03:26:49] whenever that ends up being I don't know
[03:26:51] when we'll do that at the end of the
[03:26:52] show but yeah we got um it's I do like
[03:26:56] the setup here a little bit better you
[03:26:57] can see the screen better where you can
[03:26:59] turn it to the side with your phone and
[03:27:00] everything I don't know how it looks for
[03:27:02] you guys if it looks good or not but I
[03:27:04] thought it looked pretty good here the
[03:27:05] way that we were doing it at least for
[03:27:07] me it seemed like it looked
[03:27:12] [Music]
[03:27:14] nice there's birds out side
[03:27:17] squeaking lots of birds
[03:27:24] walking come stand over
[03:27:27] [Music]
[03:27:31] here
[03:27:33] nope I have a bunch of
[03:27:36] ioria I have a whole case of ioria for
[03:27:39] those that may be interested got that in
[03:27:42] recently
[03:27:46] so let's
[03:27:47] see what you all looking for today we're
[03:27:50] having some fun we're trying to at
[03:27:53] least yep out right there out my door it
[03:27:56] sounded like they were literally at the
[03:27:57] window sarking at said they open the
[03:28:00] window open the window it doesn't matter
[03:28:02] if the windows open no there were
[03:28:03] definitely Birds right here 100% right
[03:28:06] here going
[03:28:09] off in the bush oh yeah I see him that's
[03:28:11] a bird I see him that's the
[03:28:14] birds sorry we're we're now bird
[03:28:18] watchers so my family are um after what
[03:28:22] happened on that and realizing that
[03:28:24] Liars can ruin a small business that's
[03:28:27] trying to do well I decided I'm not
[03:28:29] going to put that effort into that
[03:28:31] aspect again I'm going to put more
[03:28:32] effort into doing the D and D types
[03:28:33] thing where I'm like the dungeon master
[03:28:36] and doing some games and having fun with
[03:28:37] you all so what I'm going to plan on
[03:28:39] doing is I will have when I'm traveling
[03:28:42] around the world on our boat I'll still
[03:28:45] do some show but it won't be as frequent
[03:28:47] because we're going to be doing our own
[03:28:49] different other YouTube things that
[03:28:50] we're going to try um but I'll still do
[03:28:52] some of these but the way that I'll end
[03:28:54] up doing these ones is I'm G to end up
[03:28:57] having it so that
[03:28:59] um there a straight out Adventure like a
[03:29:02] like an actual adventure and you go
[03:29:04] along we're going to build a character
[03:29:06] in the beginning of the adventure based
[03:29:08] on what you buy and stuff like that
[03:29:10] we're going to also go and then that
[03:29:11] Adventure we're going to fail your
[03:29:13] adventure to the end hopefully in the
[03:29:15] time frame that I say maybe I'll be on
[03:29:16] for an hour or two and that's that'll be
[03:29:18] my plan for what we do and I think I'm
[03:29:20] going to start that this week coming up
[03:29:22] this week on hopefully you know this
[03:29:24] week Tuesday Wednesday or something like
[03:29:25] that I can get that going because it'll
[03:29:27] take me a little bit of time to figure
[03:29:28] it out maybe today I might figure the
[03:29:29] story out good storyline I'm trying to
[03:29:32] think of what it is I'd do for a story
[03:29:34] though hey thank you cely coming back in
[03:29:36] here so I'm thinking my story is going
[03:29:38] to be
[03:29:39] uh so I do have the Wasteland one I've
[03:29:42] been doing so I don't want to stay with
[03:29:43] the Wasteland I think I'm gonna change
[03:29:44] the story to be different it's not
[03:29:46] exactly Wast and see what the thing is
[03:29:48] people say dungeon master and I always
[03:29:50] think you know you got to have like the
[03:29:51] you know the Wizards and all that stuff
[03:29:53] but I'm thinking we don't need to always
[03:29:54] do that maybe we do a future one
[03:29:56] sometime you know what I
[03:29:58] mean you got
[03:30:04] one got the you got all right all right

[03:32:59] people hey if you come Daren there Ian
[03:33:03] if you come and hang out I don't mind
[03:33:04] that I like when people hang out chat
[03:33:06] talk I don't care if you're necessarily
[03:33:08] buying stuff all the time because it
[03:33:10] helps just I'm here to get rid of some
[03:33:13] of the stuff that I had I was had a I
[03:33:16] did have a different plan but um after
[03:33:18] learn after having a couple things occur
[03:33:21] the second time something occur you know
[03:33:22] when you know three strikes are out kite
[03:33:24] deal uh the first time something
[03:33:26] happened somebody was not truthful and
[03:33:29] dishonest and and lied the second time
[03:33:31] it wasn't a dishonesty lie thing it was
[03:33:33] it was correct but they didn't answer me
[03:33:36] and give me and I wasn't given any
[03:33:38] information and didn't know what was
[03:33:40] wrong then the third time I was a flat
[03:33:42] out lie again so between lies and
[03:33:44] ignorance
[03:33:46] I don't think I want to put the effort
[03:33:47] into this type of thing you know what I
[03:33:49] mean and it sucks because I had fun
[03:33:51] doing it with you guys but you know what
[03:33:53] that means though is my wife has decided
[03:33:55] you know what her job
[03:33:58] too her
[03:34:00] uh is switching also I guess they did a
[03:34:04] change in the management stuff and her
[03:34:05] boss is no longer going to be her
[03:34:07] boss it's going to be someone else and
[03:34:10] she's getting put to someone else that
[03:34:11] she doesn't
[03:34:12] really know and want to work under so uh
[03:34:16] we're planning on leaving the country
[03:34:17] we're buying a boat we're selling our
[03:34:19] house or buying a boat and we're uh
[03:34:21] doing our travels earlier than we wanted
[03:34:24] to that's okay though you guys can come
[03:34:27] along with us on that trip if you like
[03:34:29] we'll be doing we'll be recording and
[03:34:30] sharing some of that
[03:34:34] travels hey dude go I don't care I
[03:34:38] really don't care if you guys come in to
[03:34:39] hang out I've already said that many
[03:34:40] times that's fun for me people come in
[03:34:42] and hanging out you know you get to you
[03:34:44] get to like uh
[03:34:46] like we get to crack packs and all kinds
[03:34:48] of
[03:34:49] stuff know like I I still open them we
[03:34:51] get to talk about stuff no I don't
[03:34:54] really mind it it's one of those things
[03:34:56] for me I'm okay with it as long as
[03:35:01] uh as long as I'm talking and hanging
[03:35:03] out like it's different when like I'm
[03:35:04] just like not here and I'm I'm here and
[03:35:06] I'm like by myself and there's nothing
[03:35:07] going on that's a little different you
[03:35:09] know
[03:35:19] I put
[03:35:25] out you grab this here and you go this
[03:35:30] next we'll put one of those
[03:35:33] out
[03:35:37] with with one of these I think that's
[03:35:39] what I'm going to do next I'm take that
[03:35:41] that'll be the next one
[03:35:48] the burger
[03:35:54] back yeah but we're looking to travel
[03:35:57] we'll be on a uh we wanted to be on a
[03:36:00] Catan but the company I work for where I
[03:36:04] haven't um stock in they said we were
[03:36:06] going to sell in 5 years and it's been
[03:36:08] five years so they haven't sold yet so
[03:36:13] instead of waiting for them to sell
[03:36:15] we're going to do it early we're going
[03:36:18] to jump on this and we're going to sell
[03:36:19] um all of our
[03:36:21] stuff buy a
[03:36:23] boat we'll be in the Bahamas for a
[03:36:25] little while traveling back and forth be
[03:36:27] in us and Bahamas for about probably six
[03:36:28] months or so of my guesses then we'll
[03:36:31] travel down through the Caribbean for a
[03:36:33] couple
[03:36:35] years then we'll do our Crossing maybe
[03:36:38] like three three years from now four
[03:36:39] years from now we'll
[03:36:43] see we shall see

[03:37:08] that no one else in this country will
[03:37:10] know so that when you come back here for
[03:37:12] um College you'll be smoking people if
[03:37:14] you're still still playing
[03:37:26] [Music]
[03:37:28] trying to think what to
[03:37:33] do trying to think what I want to do you
[03:37:36] know you want to do any
[03:37:39] Adventures now you know what I going
[03:37:41] think of I going think of the
[03:37:44] adventure now our adventure be uh the
[03:37:47] one that I'm
[03:37:49] doing do we want it to be uh like a
[03:37:52] dungeon one where it's like Wizards and
[03:37:55] warriors do you want a futuristic
[03:37:58] one where it's like similar but you know
[03:38:02] future where it's uh maybe it's a
[03:38:05] technician and a uh you know a something
[03:38:09] like that I don't know apocalyptic o the
[03:38:11] apocalyptic like we got here apocalyptic
[03:38:14] is good that's what say the other one
[03:38:15] the apocalyptic because we got Fallout
[03:38:18] anybody been watching that Fallout TV
[03:38:19] show because it with the Fallout TV
[03:38:22] everything fig theme for right now with
[03:38:24] everybody paying
[03:38:27] attention all right
[03:38:32] apocalyptic we can do
[03:38:36] that and
[03:38:39] then apocalyptic and um let's see
[03:38:46] it'll be about two hours
[03:38:48] long I think we'll have to build two
[03:38:50] characters I don't think we can build
[03:38:51] three or four I think three is too much
[03:38:53] for the first game I it'll be two
[03:38:57] characters you'll build a character I
[03:38:59] think one will be like a technician and
[03:39:01] one will be either a human or mutant
[03:39:04] that'll be the decision for like a
[03:39:06] strong human or strong being so we have
[03:39:09] like a tank and then you have a uh like
[03:39:12] a range fighter I think that's what we
[03:39:14] can do
[03:39:17] H all
[03:39:19] [Music]
[03:39:22] right what
[03:39:25] else all right
[03:39:28] so start out you build your
[03:39:32] characters build their strength each
[03:39:35] pack so we'll have three different
[03:39:38] rounds to BU packs that's what we'll do
[03:39:40] to build the character first is to
[03:39:43] choose what it is is a female or a male
[03:39:46] second to use is a mutant or a human or
[03:39:49] a
[03:39:50] ghoul and the third will be like it's
[03:39:53] strength and its extra special
[03:39:55] stuff and all your packs depending on
[03:39:58] what packs they are will be the amount
[03:39:59] they go to it so if it's a s if it's all
[03:40:01] like sets then it'll be just
[03:40:04] one if it is
[03:40:07] all um like plus one if it is all boost
[03:40:11] drafts it's all just a regular and you
[03:40:13] get to pick some of them you don't no
[03:40:15] Plus and if they're all collector
[03:40:16] boosters then it's a plus two for a
[03:40:18] collector booster on whatever you put it
[03:40:20] towards like maybe your strength or your
[03:40:22] gunman ship or something like that yeah
[03:40:24] I think that's not a bad
[03:40:30] idea that'll
[03:40:32] work all right whoever buys will be able
[03:40:36] to choose for that
[03:40:38] round all
[03:40:40] right
[03:40:43] then plan the adventure
[03:40:45] [Music]
[03:40:47] and the courses will be depending on
[03:40:49] which direction you go all right
[03:40:53] depending on which direction you go what
[03:40:56] you're going to choose in The
[03:40:58] Adventure whatever packs you buy I'll
[03:41:00] put up I'll put up an option of packs
[03:41:02] again so like it'll be booster it'll be
[03:41:04] like draft set and collector booster and
[03:41:08] depending on what you
[03:41:10] buy who want to put it up as an
[03:41:13] auction and you have to bid up to pack
[03:41:15] for what you want to buy that's what
[03:41:16] I'll
[03:41:18] do 5K you're getting it Daran thank you
[03:41:25] buddy so do
[03:41:31] that and the choices to go Which Way in
[03:41:34] the adventure will be based on the pack
[03:41:36] and what the person says so are they
[03:41:38] going to do one thing or another and
[03:41:39] then we roll to see what happens and
[03:41:42] then the bonus will be based on the pack
[03:41:44] so it won't be any bonus for
[03:41:47] a for and for a collector booster it
[03:41:49] will be plus two again so it'll be like
[03:41:51] a little addition to whatever it is I
[03:41:54] think that might work
[03:41:57] actually that actually might
[03:42:01] work you work your way to the boss at
[03:42:04] the
[03:42:10] end I played VA the beginning first game
[03:42:13] or so
[03:42:16] I got some good uh Wasteland
[03:42:23] stuff you know what I think I can do
[03:42:26] that think I can do that Darren your
[03:42:28] hands are on fire dude your hands G to
[03:42:30] be hurting
[03:42:33] man all right I'm G put this one back
[03:42:36] put this one
[03:42:37] [Applause]
[03:42:40] back we'll put this up for adventure now
[03:42:44] remember I'm just putting out random
[03:42:45] things so you don't need me to tell you
[03:42:48] it so if there is somebody in here that
[03:42:49] wants to pick something up you can just
[03:42:51] say hey I want these packs inste or
[03:42:54] something because I'm just literally
[03:42:56] running random
[03:43:01] [Music]
[03:43:11] stuff I'm literally going over just
[03:43:13] grabbing random things from my uh
[03:43:17] my packs over
[03:43:26] here that that and that there you go see
[03:43:30] if anybody wants to try
[03:43:33] [Music]
[03:43:35] that oh wow interesting okay
[03:43:39] huh I have seizures myself so I kind of
[03:43:43] understand a little bit
[03:43:45] ah but I understand shaking stuff carpal
[03:43:49] tunnel incoming I
[03:43:52] know I know my hands just hurt thinking
[03:43:55] about
[03:44:01] it so what do you guys think about our
[03:44:03] uh what what do you think about that
[03:44:04] Adventure idea not a bad one I think
[03:44:06] that's pretty good I think that could
[03:44:08] work cuz each pack helps you decide
[03:44:11] which direction you're going and the
[03:44:12] amount of strength you have or maybe
[03:44:14] like bonus t like maybe you're going to
[03:44:16] use shooting to shoot something you know
[03:44:17] what I mean it'll be a bonus that you
[03:44:18] can maybe roll and do you hit its head
[03:44:21] do you hit you know do you roll you hit
[03:44:23] its leg whatever it is type
[03:44:25] thing I think that that's not a bad idea
[03:44:27] and I can use all the things that we
[03:44:29] have now still and just add a few extras
[03:44:32] for the
[03:44:35] animations that could work too because I
[03:44:37] can reuse the animations that I have
[03:44:40] even now some of
[03:44:43] them yes as long as there are
[03:44:45] participants I know it's the big biggest
[03:44:48] thing is making sure there's
[03:44:55] participants
[03:44:59] right so be
[03:45:02] it sometimes they are sometimes they're
[03:45:04] right but we'll see what happens
[03:45:07] sometimes we can get people come in and
[03:45:08] hang out with us and do these things but
[03:45:09] it takes a little while every now and
[03:45:11] again
[03:45:17] but I will end up probably
[03:45:19] um when I do head out here I'll make
[03:45:22] sure I run that giveaway at the end
[03:45:24] before I leave for the day and it'll be
[03:45:26] on for maybe maybe another half hour to
[03:45:28] an hour I don't have hanging out too too
[03:45:30] long because I do have other stuff that
[03:45:32] we do need to get accomplished during
[03:45:33] the days but I at least like to like
[03:45:35] hang out for a little bit sometimes in
[03:45:36] the morning talk to you guys chat maybe
[03:45:39] open some
[03:45:40] packs do some uh do some games if we can
[03:45:45] let's do um I got to refill the
[03:45:48] uh I got to refill the things here that
[03:45:51] sucks cuz I was saving those for another
[03:45:52] time frame I guess I'll just use those
[03:45:56] now might as well just use those
[03:46:03] [Music]
[03:46:06] now that one there put that one in there
[03:46:09] put one of those in there for the vault
[03:46:10] pack I have to refill them because we
[03:46:12] only have 20 of the gold envelopes so uh
[03:46:15] I have to refill them every now and
[03:46:16] again they're just not like I said
[03:46:18] they're nothing special just a little uh
[03:46:21] thank you for hanging out last thing
[03:46:23] that ends up being a
[03:46:26] uh just a pack of cards that are nothing
[03:46:28] special you've seen some of them I mean
[03:46:30] some of them are baseball cards too so
[03:46:32] we've seen that before but not they're
[03:46:35] all packs that are like a dollar or
[03:46:38] less nothing special with them
[03:46:46] all right let me
[03:46:47] do this one here let's add another one
[03:46:51] in there so what else do we want I'll
[03:46:53] put in one of these instead you know why
[03:46:56] not I'm going to put one of those in
[03:46:57] since I'm not going to be around to use
[03:46:59] those so why not see what's in them
[03:47:01] actually should I save the Coca-Cola one
[03:47:04] the no I'm going to save you know what
[03:47:06] I'm the Santa ones because maybe we'll
[03:47:08] use them on Christmas at sometime
[03:47:10] something
[03:47:12] special got some Santa cards here that's
[03:47:15] what I was talking about go put this
[03:47:18] over Ben refilled to go back
[03:47:24] in little thank you
[03:47:36] packs uhoh knock the box is
[03:47:40] over oh no I'm knocking crap all over
[03:47:43] the place
[03:47:46] no go
[03:47:48] in why are you causing such a problem
[03:47:51] today my fingers are not working well I
[03:47:54] got say there you go no one wants to try
[03:47:56] the boxes put those there there you go
[03:47:58] put those back in there
[03:48:03] refilled Ken the kid deck oh
[03:48:11] um I can't think of anything ah
[03:48:22] let me
[03:48:25] see let's see where are some good
[03:48:30] things K the kid all right flying lifel
[03:48:34] whenever you cast spell from anywhere
[03:48:37] other than your hand you may cast a
[03:48:39] permit spell with equal or lesser Mona
[03:48:42] value from your hand L pains mon if you
[03:48:45] don't you put a land card from your hand
[03:48:49] onto the battlefield okay so I would use
[03:48:53] something where
[03:49:06] either I would say you would want to do
[03:49:08] something where you have some good
[03:49:11] spells that are higher
[03:49:12] cost not necessarily a lot of big ones
[03:49:15] just a few so let's see what uh let's
[03:49:17] see what we have
[03:49:27] here let's see what else we
[03:49:33] [Music]
[03:49:38] do
[03:49:40] um let's see
[03:49:46] [Music]
[03:49:50] let's see well we going to
[03:49:57] want I mean to her son is a nice one if
[03:50:01] you can get that especially with the way
[03:50:03] that those spells are and he's having
[03:50:05] that but that's an that's an expensive
[03:50:07] one that would be a nice one to have
[03:50:09] because especially the way it does with
[03:50:10] the
[03:50:12] Spells uh um trying to think of some
[03:50:16] others yeah it's pricey
[03:50:20] though
[03:50:24] um lightning Greaves that'd be a good
[03:50:28] one to equip because it gets
[03:50:34] shroud you want some ramp cards in there
[03:50:37] because the way you have your uh stuff
[03:50:39] so may maybe some ramp cards
[03:50:43] [Music]
[03:50:48] maybe like a bean sock giant type that's
[03:50:50] a lot that's an expensive
[03:50:53] one
[03:50:56] maybe Teran war or thought vessel that
[03:50:59] wouldn't be
[03:51:06] bad yeah AP that would be nice for
[03:51:09] Cascade Cascade
[03:51:19] [Music]
[03:51:20] maybe a
[03:51:22] uh feel like
[03:51:33] um you could do potentially
[03:51:43] [Music]
[03:51:47] well giant killer might
[03:51:49] help giant killer is not a bad one it's
[03:51:51] a cheaper
[03:51:56] one trying to
[03:52:03] [Music]
[03:52:11] think probably want to put a uh maybe oh
[03:52:15] that's a good choice there Elli and
[03:52:16] Allen
[03:52:18] paleontologist that way you can Exile
[03:52:20] anything in uh creature card and
[03:52:23] discover X yeah that's not a bad
[03:52:26] one Ellie and Allen is not a bad
[03:52:32] one just trying to look at cards that
[03:52:34] might work with
[03:52:35] it the Exile creature card from your
[03:52:38] graveyard draw X where X is the Mona
[03:52:41] value of the exiled card
[03:52:45] so like you're going to be with all the
[03:52:47] Spells you do you can Exile something
[03:52:49] pull it out that's not a bad
[03:52:52] one then maybe some ones where you cast
[03:52:54] from the graveyard things because of
[03:52:58] it oh what is the um one whenever you
[03:53:01] cast a spell it duplicates
[03:53:06] it it's like one of the um Gods
[03:53:10] ones maybe an oare I think it might be
[03:53:16] not bad I don't know there's a couple
[03:53:18] ones that I might I maybe throw in there
[03:53:20] that is a harder one that is a harder
[03:53:22] one
[03:53:23] there I'm going to put that
[03:53:26] back
[03:53:28] here all right we're going to just do um
[03:53:31] let's just do a a
[03:53:36] adventure no we're going to do one yeah
[03:53:39] we're going to do one I'm just going to
[03:53:40] say that's one strength why not we're
[03:53:43] going to say it's one one strength
[03:53:46] here and that's what we're going to do
[03:53:48] just one I don't care we'll say it's one
[03:53:53] strength if anybody wants try
[03:54:04] it you go do that there you
[03:54:09] are little Thunder Junction if you want
[03:54:13] it let's see I'm trying to think of
[03:54:15] others that might work
[03:54:23] nicely I mean like dream root Cascade is
[03:54:27] good deserted beaches command Tower
[03:54:30] breeding pool hiin Harbor you know that
[03:54:33] type of
[03:54:35] thing what about um
[03:54:39] [Music]
[03:54:47] need some counter spells or something
[03:54:49] like that in
[03:54:52] there Supreme verdict
[03:54:56] maybe stuff like that rid of the other
[03:54:58] creatures you do a lot of spell stuff it
[03:55:00] would see you know I mean with your deck
[03:55:08] [Music]
[03:55:17] well that's not bad Cascade of the
[03:55:20] locked house maybe what's that one give
[03:55:23] you some more
[03:55:26] lands that's pretty good that's not bad
[03:55:29] olog olog is not a bad option for a
[03:55:32] little higher cost on
[03:55:34] the I'm not sure about emoi I'm not sure
[03:55:36] how that work that could work but olog
[03:55:38] might be a tall at
[03:55:42] one that could work a little
[03:55:48] bit yeah that might be a potential
[03:56:00] there yes for Cascade it is nice for
[03:56:03] Cascade that is correct that is
[03:56:07] correct we put that back
[03:56:15] you know what why not put out something
[03:56:17] like this this will get you three
[03:56:18] strength to start your adventure in the
[03:56:27] Wasteland here you
[03:56:29] go why not throw that out there
[03:56:37] [Music]
[03:56:41] anyways know we'll do it for this
[03:56:43] instead
[03:56:44] right
[03:56:46] [Music]
[03:56:49] now yeah is any time I did an evening
[03:56:52] show somebody ended up reporting and
[03:56:55] give me an issue so and line and I
[03:56:57] actually had one of them live that I got
[03:56:58] a wait that I had not like not an issue
[03:57:00] with that they they want yeah we see
[03:57:02] that those lie then another one they
[03:57:05] didn't answer me and just manipulated me
[03:57:07] and then last one they let lie go
[03:57:11] again so like a three strikes your out
[03:57:13] person
[03:57:15] so I'm done I'm done with the card stuff
[03:57:19] I'll put some more effort into the d& D
[03:57:21] maybe dungeon master
[03:57:23] thing so some of you guys like me
[03:57:25] playing the games where we do like our
[03:57:27] animated stuff it would be something
[03:57:28] cool that I would do if I did like this
[03:57:30] and did like a like a this with the
[03:57:32] cards and maybe just doing a literally a
[03:57:34] D and D dungeon master thing as I am
[03:57:37] maybe be a patron do that type
[03:57:41] thing the card stuff
[03:57:44] I just switched from the cards over um
[03:57:47] over to some packs there where if you
[03:57:50] want I can go back to showing
[03:57:55] singles I can go and throw some of my
[03:57:57] singles off again so hold on well these
[03:58:00] are running I just kind of
[03:58:02] talking let's see
[03:58:05] [Applause]
[03:58:09] here here you go I'll start showing them
[03:58:12] off some of them off here
[03:58:16] all
[03:58:17] right we can do that can show some of
[03:58:20] the singles off we do have the adventure
[03:58:21] game out there still
[03:58:25] but we do that show some of these off
[03:58:28] maybe you want something like a deserted
[03:58:31] beach now if you want a deserted Beach
[03:58:33] let me know I can put that off the side
[03:58:35] with your name on it the way that I like
[03:58:37] to do this here instead of um like yes I
[03:58:40] can go through and do as auctions if you
[03:58:42] would like or or I can do it where it's
[03:58:45] one at a time I put them up there you
[03:58:46] tell me if you want it and I can put it
[03:58:48] off the side with your name on it then
[03:58:50] add everything up at the end of the
[03:58:51] stream that way you're not paying like a
[03:58:53] bunch of shipping fees and potentially
[03:58:54] like that and I can make sure it's a
[03:58:55] little bit of a that way like you're not
[03:58:58] paying because I have to put it in and
[03:58:59] Bas it on like you're buying one card
[03:59:02] with the shipping and packaging so if
[03:59:04] you do it differently and you do like
[03:59:06] multiple cards the shipping and
[03:59:07] packaging I'm not going to add into the
[03:59:08] cost of it you know so that's why I'm
[03:59:10] saying um if you wanted to uh change

[04:03:16] things or a bunch of shipments where you
[04:03:20] have to pay per shipment you know that
[04:03:23] way I can Market as one shipment at a
[04:03:25] certain price and you don't have to pay
[04:03:27] you don't have to worry about it being
[04:03:28] like that way I can measure the weight
[04:03:30] here and before you put it up I'll say
[04:03:33] hey it's this much at this price type of
[04:03:34] thing you

[04:04:11] together uh so you can try if and it
[04:04:13] does add them up together so you don't

[04:04:33] appreciate it yeah shipping can be lower
[04:04:36] or higher depending on what it
[04:04:38] is I it's generally over an ounce I put
[04:04:41] one between one and three ounces
[04:04:44] is what um I generally put down for the
[04:04:46] weight of some of the things so let's
[04:04:48] put out a uh let's put this out next all
[04:04:52] right actually going to do this for the

[04:05:01] Paladin 10K you did it Darren you did it

[04:05:07] so much that was so
[04:05:10] cool like I don't ever have to pay
[04:05:12] attention to that I never really pay
[04:05:13] attention that much but you that was
[04:05:15] pretty sweet thank you I appreciate that
[04:05:17] a lot
[04:05:19] buddy all right we're going to put this
[04:05:21] one out here little pure steel
[04:05:24] Paladin for those that may want
[04:05:26] it pull the card closer as requested
[04:05:31] before get the light on it nice so you
[04:05:33] can see
[04:05:39] it on screen single
[04:05:46] magic
[04:05:48] one
[04:05:54] two5 there you go start that again
[04:05:57] little pure steel Paladin it's a nice
[04:05:59] one there thank you for giving me that
[04:06:03] 10K there I like that a lot do
[04:06:06] appreciate
[04:06:10] that going to put out some other ones
[04:06:12] next I'm going to figure out what we're
[04:06:13] going to put out for our next ones maybe
[04:06:15] you're going to want some uh other
[04:06:17] singles I'll throw them out this way it
[04:06:19] does seem like people like it when I do
[04:06:21] it this way that way you get a minute or
[04:06:23] so to look at the card inside if
[04:06:25] something you
[04:06:29] want maybe they are maybe they not I
[04:06:31] don't know some of the prices of these
[04:06:33] cards were significantly higher when I
[04:06:34] first got them and put them out which is
[04:06:37] interesting the prices drop and they
[04:06:38] fluctuate so much you don't ever it's
[04:06:40] hard to ever know what they are I just
[04:06:43] for the most part need to have some way
[04:06:44] to scan them to be able to tell if I'm
[04:06:47] going to be selling the singles
[04:06:49] regularly I
[04:06:51] realized so part of the reason why I got
[04:06:54] that out the camera so I have a nice
[04:06:56] setup and that type of thing but also
[04:06:59] because it'll allow me to uh do this
[04:07:01] stuff where I can now use my phone to
[04:07:03] talk to you guys or look stuff up online
[04:07:05] if I need to quickly rather than having
[04:07:07] to like move the computer around and
[04:07:09] then adjust the camera view and stuff
[04:07:14] oh damn that's all for shipping hey I'll
[04:07:18] throw you in a vault pack also if you
[04:07:19] don't pick anything else up okay that
[04:07:22] way uh shipping's made it a little worth
[04:07:23] it if I
[04:07:28] can if you want to pick something else
[04:07:30] up I I think it ends up adding it
[04:07:31] together and it's not as
[04:07:35] much I hate
[04:07:37] shipping well you do want to make sure
[04:07:39] your stuff is protected I mean I could
[04:07:41] do it a different way I think I don't
[04:07:42] know if we can do it where we send it
[04:07:43] through the regular
[04:07:45] mail but uh I could check that one out
[04:07:49] as an
[04:07:50] option might be able to do them a little
[04:07:52] cheaper and do it that way but I don't
[04:07:54] know if that's something that you guys
[04:07:55] would want to have Ur because then that
[04:07:58] you know the package can be a little
[04:07:59] more damaged I like to make sure they're
[04:08:02] in like you know they're safe when they
[04:08:03] get shipped that's why I never like to
[04:08:05] do it that
[04:08:07] way yeah I can I'll throw one of those
[04:08:09] in for you all right Bud we'll grab one
[04:08:12] and throw one of those in depend yeah if
[04:08:13] you grab some other things like that
[04:08:16] that way you can help out with the
[04:08:18] shipping a little bit
[04:08:22] there put all these things here all
[04:08:24] right that one was up there no one
[04:08:26] wanted
[04:08:28] it put this
[04:08:30] out this one here is a surge

[04:34:50] bosses here after so depending on how
[04:34:53] much strength you get starting out with
[04:34:55] one and a half you could get three so
[04:34:56] you get four and a
[04:34:57] half at the most with these you could
[04:35:00] beat three of the 10
[04:35:02] bosses to be able to get a uh a free
[04:35:05] booster a free pack at the end now that

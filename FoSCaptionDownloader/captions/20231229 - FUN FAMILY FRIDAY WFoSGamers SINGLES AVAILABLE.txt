[01:02:15] that Nas goul with that death touch ouch
[01:02:18] don't want to be getting hit by one of
[01:02:20] those especially when you use uh when
[01:02:21] you are playing with the ring and all
[01:02:23] that
[01:02:27] displaced Dino I do not have a displaced
[01:02:32] dyo
[01:02:34] um trying to think that what if I know
[01:02:37] what one that is though I don't remember
[01:02:40] it either but I don't remember so if I
[01:02:43] yeah I don't remember it so I definitely
[01:02:45] don't have it if I don't remember it I
[01:02:47] will say that I feel like I would have
[01:02:50] remembered that
[01:02:51] one I'm going have to look the card up
[01:02:53] quickly though and check and I'll double
[01:02:55] check though and I'll let you
[01:02:57] know seven Mana green green
[01:03:03] [Music]

[01:03:33] the collector
[01:03:35] boosters I mean I have it in my in my
[01:03:37] commander
[01:03:39] box I I probably have it in one of the
[01:03:41] commander decks because of I have all
[01:03:44] the commander decks and if you have all
[01:03:46] the commander decks you have all the
[01:03:47] cards but that means I didn't get one of
[01:03:50] those in any of the uh boxes I packs I
[01:03:53] opened which is pretty interesting
[01:03:55] actually thinking about it huh you know

[01:10:34] I'm gonna let you know I have not pulled

[01:10:47] on screen we're going to throw on a pull
[01:10:51] box deal again here you know let's throw
[01:10:54] the Doctor Who pole box on since we're
[01:10:55] talking about
[01:10:57] it normally this is 18 but whatever
[01:11:00] we're going to do it as 16 at the moment
[01:11:01] we're going to see if anybody wants to
[01:11:02] try their luck on these
[01:11:08] ones you're sell it all sell it out of
[01:11:11] all the I know well you know if I uh the
[01:11:15] pro I know the thing is I have it in the
[01:11:17] precon and I use the precon so if I
[01:11:20] wasn't using the precon I'd think about
[01:11:22] selling it
[01:11:27] that's what it boils down to because we
[01:11:29] actually play with all the precons and
[01:11:30] everything so if I didn't have if I was
[01:11:33] actually damn trying to I don't remember
[01:11:36] having
[01:11:37] that I wonder if I put it I got it
[01:11:40] pulled out and I just never thought of
[01:11:41] it and I have to look through my box to
[01:11:43] see if I have it by any chance I wonder
[01:11:45] if it's in my doctor who like I have a a
[01:11:48] white box of Doctor Who stuff that I
[01:11:49] need to switch out all the preons that
[01:11:51] I'm trying to like slowly go through and

[01:12:00] we're going to rotate back into the low
[01:12:01] value and the cheaper singles since um
[01:12:05] we
[01:12:07] have went back to the beginning there
[01:12:10] we're going to go to the cheaper singles
[01:12:12] and we're going to
[01:12:14] [Music]
[01:12:18] say any of

[01:12:40] know exactly buy a pre-con if you can
[01:12:42] can just to get that one

[01:13:03] art each of those $3 if you want you
[01:13:06] know what I might I might if I have the
[01:13:08] ability to buy precons still I wonder if
[01:13:12] I can buy preons cheap from the
[01:13:14] distributor that I go to and if I can I
[01:13:16] might just buy a couple of the preons
[01:13:17] for that
[01:13:19] card it mean it would be worth it and I
[01:13:21] can sell the rest of the cards there's a

[03:11:12] your character
[03:11:16] there yeah I know with the house and the
[03:11:19] kids I know it's like a fantasy
[03:11:23] sci-fi-ish setting he's a mercenary who
[03:11:25] is a human with little no power for
[03:11:29] power scaling purposes but his battle
[03:11:31] knowledge is far
[03:11:34] in Superior to others so he can manage
[03:11:37] his own in battle all right cool I like
[03:11:40] it I like that idea cool it's a
[03:11:42] mercenary all right one of my favorite
[03:11:45] um characters is from um is from uh the
[03:11:49] Neverwinter series it's a oh I'm
[03:11:51] blanking on his name um
[03:11:55] jarlaxle I love saying that name too
[03:11:58] jarlaxle it's like a cool name to get
[03:12:00] off your tongue so yovav reminds me of a
[03:12:02] name like that and he reminds the
[03:12:04] character you're describing kind of
[03:12:05] reminds me of a little bit of a jarla
[03:12:07] axel where he doesn't have power but he
[03:12:09] can gain power as a

[03:19:59] these but we'll get it we'll get it
[03:20:03] here we'll call
[03:20:10] this
[03:20:14] all right we'll call
[03:20:27] this we'll call this
[03:20:40] one
[03:20:42] let me make sure my math is right
[03:20:47] here why is my math not seeming right I
[03:20:50] think it's just because I don't do high
[03:20:52] ones all the
[03:20:57] time no that's right all right we're
[03:20:59] going to do this
[03:21:10] for
[03:21:12] [Music]
[03:21:18] 70 we're going to call this
[03:21:21] 71 71 for those three on
[03:21:29] screen good morning how you
[03:21:32] doing math is hard sometimes well I'm
[03:21:35] looking at it I'm going wait that seems
[03:21:37] really high but then I'm realizing it's
[03:21:39] all collector boosters that's why it
[03:21:41] seems high and I'm not used to doing
[03:21:42] three collector boosters at once and
[03:21:44] that's really what it boils down
[03:21:46] to so I'm looking at I'm going hey hey M
[03:21:49] Small how you doing I'm going wait that
[03:21:50] doesn't seem right mik no it is it is
[03:21:52] it's just because there's three
[03:21:53] collector boosters so hey that's what it
[03:21:56] is 71 for those three a Lord of the
[03:21:58] Rings a lost caverns of Exon and a
[03:22:01] collector booster of Wilds of Val drain
[03:22:03] so all three of those are collector
[03:22:04] boosters there for 71 normally that
[03:22:06] would be like
[03:22:09] 76 $77 that would normally be so you're
[03:22:12] getting um six bucks off it's really
[03:22:14] what it boils down to there if you want
[03:22:15] to try
[03:22:16] those no did not want any of them that's
[03:22:20] okay that was a high one I know so we're
[03:22:22] going to put that
[03:22:25] back they did not want that that's
[03:22:29] okay and we're going to go over
[03:22:31] to a
[03:22:36] singles singles deal and see what
[03:22:38] happens there no math me more of a play
[03:22:42] in the dirt kind of
[03:22:43] guy see I I I set up a um a Excel file
[03:22:48] to do all my math for me I just um I
[03:22:52] just kept looking at it going that
[03:22:53] doesn't look right that doesn't look
[03:22:54] right that doesn't look right so I had
[03:22:56] to double check it with my my uh phone
[03:22:59] just to be like y all right no all right
[03:23:01] that is right it's just because it was
[03:23:02] just all three collector boosters and
[03:23:05] I'm not used to doing collector boosters
[03:23:06] so I just it was just uh higher than I
[03:23:09] was used to seeing that's why here we go
[03:23:13] we got someone bought a Brothers work
[03:23:15] collector pack
[03:23:18] what someone bought the brothers wor
[03:23:20] collector
[03:23:21] pack that should not be in there yob
[03:23:25] that should not be in there I have to
[03:23:26] cancel that that should not be in there
[03:23:29] I thought I removed the brothers War
[03:23:30] collector there's only one Brothers War
[03:23:32] collector pack in here there is not
[03:23:35] three there's supposed to be only one I
[03:23:38] don't know why there's three in there

[04:23:48] the Christmas stuff and change it out

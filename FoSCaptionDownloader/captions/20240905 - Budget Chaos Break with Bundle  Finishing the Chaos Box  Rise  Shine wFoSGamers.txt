[00:10:02] that Budget break though there a good
[00:10:04] one today we got 10 spots available as
[00:10:06] you can see there I'm going to write our
[00:10:08] name down for our friend that did win
[00:10:10] the giveaway which is Eco one of our
[00:10:13] buddies that comes in and hangs out in
[00:10:14] the morning because he
[00:10:18] knows now is it cook or is it Coke I'm
[00:10:21] guessing C
[00:10:23] ecook I was wondering like I'm like like
[00:10:26] if you're a friend of if you like Coke
[00:10:27] and you had to add like two zeros
[00:10:29] because people may like make weird names
[00:10:31] all the time or maybe you you like
[00:10:33] really like Coke and and you and you and
[00:10:36] that's why you wrote it down like I
[00:10:37] don't really know I haven't figured it
[00:10:41] out
[00:10:43] cook all right cook e cook all right
[00:10:46] thank you thank you I was trying you
[00:10:48] know I was one of those ones where like
[00:10:50] there's so many people that like they
[00:10:51] add things to their names it's hard for
[00:10:52] me to know what their actual name
[00:10:55] is oh well there you go well that makes
[00:10:58] sense why it's e cook yep yep y thank
[00:11:01] you thank you I knew a person with their
[00:11:02] last name was cook so like that's why I
[00:11:04] was wondering like is it cook like the
[00:11:05] last name or is it Coke like but I'm
[00:11:07] thinking it's Coke it's got to be
[00:11:08] something like that because you know
[00:11:10] it's related to you know online stuff
[00:11:13] but I I was wrong there on that one but

[00:19:02] there I like that P I like that one
[00:19:05] that's a good one p here being the old
[00:19:09] man hey let's uh run the I'm GNA run
[00:19:13] this here going start it off this
[00:19:15] morning we'll try one of them at a d
[00:19:17] discounted for our box here here we
[00:19:22] go we'll see what happens whenever I put
[00:19:25] the scissors away so I'm going to get
[00:19:26] something and gets a pack of cards it's
[00:19:28] like a a ritual for
[00:19:38] me all right well then I guess uh we are
[00:19:43] not going to do that today all right
[00:19:46] we'll go with that we'll just put back
[00:19:47] our our break we'll put our break
[00:19:55] back the so the tournament bundle what
[00:19:57] we were doing is going to be giving so I
[00:20:00] was going to be doing um a tournament
[00:20:02] thing I actually need to take that down
[00:20:03] probably because I was planning on doing
[00:20:05] a tournament and it was going to be one
[00:20:06] of these days with Bloom bur stuff and
[00:20:08] it was supposed to happen in the last
[00:20:10] month but no one end up jumping in on it
[00:20:11] so I'll probably end up make changing it
[00:20:13] and making it into one where we do the
[00:20:15] bundle is with um dusk when it comes out
[00:20:18] so I'll probably start it right away
[00:20:19] with duskmourn instead but um so for
[00:20:22] those that got it with the bloom Barrow
[00:20:23] one I'm going to give you guys option of
[00:20:26] you can play in with your Bloom Barrow
[00:20:27] against us or um obviously you just get
[00:20:30] the packs I think there's only one
[00:20:32] person that jumped in on it
[00:20:33] anyways um so I'm actually going to
[00:20:35] remove I actually to remove that one and
[00:20:37] I'm just going to leave it because that
[00:20:39] one was to play a game and I'm going to
[00:20:40] put it back out when we have the uh
[00:20:43] bundle for when we have it set up for um
[00:20:46] no I want to remove that I'm gonna I'm G
[00:20:48] to put it back when we have it
[00:20:50] um when I have the uh when I have uh
[00:20:54] what do you call it available Dorn and
[00:20:56] I'll put it in with Dorn instead
[00:21:00] let me uh go into my inventory though
[00:21:02] and make a
[00:21:04] change here yes I'm going to deactivate
[00:21:08] that yeah I'm gonna make it available
[00:21:10] with duskborn and we'll do one one of
[00:21:13] those again with Dorn so the point of
[00:21:14] the tournament bundle was I was going to
[00:21:16] be doing there was five packs I was
[00:21:17] going to be like we're going to make a
[00:21:18] mini tournament where we're going to get
[00:21:19] five packs I open up a collector booster
[00:21:21] generally when I get boxes with the
[00:21:22] collector booster that I was going to
[00:21:23] open I was going to put uh take and I'll
[00:21:25] put off the side eight of the rares or
[00:21:29] mythics from there and you would get
[00:21:30] randomly one of those with five packs of
[00:21:32] cards you would get we'd open those five
[00:21:34] packs of cards we would see what you get
[00:21:36] obviously live on here then what we
[00:21:38] would do is when a
[00:21:40] um what you would do is um we' be able
[00:21:43] to play a tournament on whatever the
[00:21:44] specific specified date is and everybody
[00:21:47] would make their deck out of it like a
[00:21:48] 40 card deck out it kind of like a like
[00:21:50] you know like a um pre-release in a way
[00:21:53] because not every I don't always get the
[00:21:54] pre-release uh boxes and so I was trying
[00:21:56] to kind of do a little mini one in a way
[00:21:58] and that's what it is it's kind of
[00:22:01] simple play against each other have some
[00:22:03] fun that way everybody gets kind of all
[00:22:05] randomized stuff you know number five
[00:22:08] hazer thank you my friend and you got a
[00:22:12] fire Diamond well look at that one I
[00:22:14] like it
[00:22:17] hazer I do believe this
[00:22:20] artist does some stuff here on on
[00:22:25] whatnot if you want to check him out
[00:22:29] now you said number five one two three
[00:22:31] four and five because I had 11 in there
[00:22:34] so I don't need to put an
[00:22:35] extra but that's what that's kind of how
[00:22:37] that goes there sorry about cook but um
[00:22:40] yeah that'll come out I'll do that again
[00:22:43] probably next week or the week after is
[00:22:46] when I'll be able to have
[00:22:48] duskborn to do that if I could get some
[00:22:51] pre-release I'd love to be able to do
[00:22:53] that actually I should asked the people
[00:22:56] I work that I I work through if I can
[00:22:58] get some those
[00:22:59] things I wonder if I
[00:23:02] could yeah so pretty much what it would
[00:23:04] be is next um for for DUS more what I'll
[00:23:06] end up doing is uh it'll be like a
[00:23:08] pretty much a deal for five packs of
[00:23:10] cards so rather than paying full price
[00:23:12] you'll get a discount on it plus you're
[00:23:13] going to get a rare card thrown in there
[00:23:16] duskborn then on generally it'll be on
[00:23:18] the weekend on like Saturday night or a
[00:23:20] Sunday during the day we'll play a
[00:23:22] tournament and whoever wins the
[00:23:23] tournament there'll be there'll be a
[00:23:25] first second and third place prize so
[00:23:26] I'll have a I'll have us like a single
[00:23:29] that I had from dkor that we pulled out
[00:23:31] uh three different singles that'll be up
[00:23:33] there for the winner to get and whenever

[00:26:31] before the adventure games because you
[00:26:33] guys all like those those are fun it
[00:26:36] takes time and those are those are
[00:26:37] interactive the entire time I know I
[00:26:39] can't use the uh
[00:26:44] the I know I can't use the
[00:26:47] uh the uh what do you call it
[00:26:52] but the bot anymore but we can still do
[00:26:54] some fun games with the other
[00:26:56] stuff all right so we had um so I had an
[00:27:00] adventure game that I had built all
[00:27:02] right this is pretty
[00:27:04] fun so you uh you got to choose who
[00:27:08] you're going to be this is a Fallout one
[00:27:11] that I built a while back you could be a
[00:27:13] mutant you could be human you be a
[00:27:16] detective you could be like a tech
[00:27:18] technician and you could do all kinds of
[00:27:20] things going through this like Wasteland
[00:27:22] you go through the Wasteland you could
[00:27:23] maybe find some treasure maybe there's
[00:27:25] an enemy to fight maybe fought off uh
[00:27:28] Mir in the fields maybe you got to the
[00:27:31] end where you got to fight
[00:27:34] galta there you go so it was fun one
[00:27:37] there we had it was intriguing but we
[00:27:40] hadn't played it in a little while
[00:27:41] because you know it broke down broke
[00:27:43] down a little bit with some of the stuff
[00:27:45] not working with the bot so I have to
[00:27:46] make some updates to it look at e CCO
[00:27:51] cook there we
[00:27:54] go you got a lazan dragons Legacy
[00:27:59] loan dragon's R Legacy I like
[00:28:02] it now I need a number was 10 I think I
[00:28:05] have to add one
[00:28:10] here one two three four five six 7 8
[00:28:14] nine 10 yep I did have to add
[00:28:16] one so
[00:28:24] yeah the show notes I cannot adjust the
[00:28:27] show notes icon at all it's actually
[00:28:30] where it is so if it is in a place
[00:28:32] that's like uh that I can that's
[00:28:33] blocking me let me know um and I can
[00:28:37] actually move my
[00:28:40] face so like here for instance instead I
[00:28:43] can do
[00:28:46] this move myself over here more in the
[00:28:53] middle move these more in the middle
[00:28:55] like
[00:28:56] that see
[00:29:00] I don't know if that's any
[00:29:05] better I don't know if that helps at all
[00:29:08] makes it gets things out of the way kind
[00:29:09] of I
[00:29:12] think there you go all right yeah so
[00:29:15] thank you for letting me know I didn't
[00:29:16] know that it blocks that that way
[00:29:17] because I can't see whenever I pull it
[00:29:18] up it's a blank screen when I pull it up
[00:29:21] so it doesn't show it as another person
[00:29:22] so I don't see that I only see like that
[00:29:24] black whatnot screen so I can't even see
[00:29:25] the show no block in my face and if I go
[00:29:27] and look on YouTube they're definitely
[00:29:28] they're not blocking my face
[00:29:31] there well they kind of it kind of is
[00:29:33] some of the stuff is but not
[00:29:36] fully but anyways yeah we got those
[00:29:39] there all right we'll we'll do these
[00:29:41] though I did want to do this because my
[00:29:43] kids like having the
[00:29:44] dice and I figured you know what we
[00:29:47] already have a couple of them and so do
[00:29:50] you you all like having the dice
[00:29:52] also so I myself was going to add open
[00:29:56] one of these cuz I I like opening things
[00:29:59] and I know I waste money but that's my
[00:30:04] fault least it's not all the time that's
[00:30:06] true notes are not there all the time
[00:30:09] because depending on opening this or the
[00:30:12] modern Horizon I have another modern
[00:30:13] Horizon 3
[00:30:16] one I was thinking about but I'm not
[00:30:18] sure if I
[00:30:22] want to do either of
[00:30:24] them I like modern Horizon 3 though
[00:30:29] like modern Horizon 3 like I was
[00:30:30] debating do I want to open either of
[00:30:31] these for myself and my family I don't
[00:30:34] know I was thinking Bloom
[00:30:36] bro but I was thinking modern Horizon 3
[00:30:38] because I like modern Horizon 3 my kids
[00:30:40] like the dice and then we can have but
[00:30:42] we have already a bunch of Dice look at
[00:30:43] all the dice we have like you know we
[00:30:45] already have a bunch of we don't need
[00:30:47] more why do they need more like we have
[00:30:50] we already have them see we don't need
[00:30:54] more I actually like I think we have
[00:30:55] three modern Horizon ones too look at
[00:30:57] that
[00:30:58] three modern Horizon ones so we don't
[00:31:00] need three modern Horizon ones so but we
[00:31:03] also have Bloom ones too so I don't
[00:31:06] know yes it is a special
[00:31:12] dice yeah it is
[00:31:14] tempting is very
[00:31:17] tempting see I need to get my dice bag
[00:31:20] ah I need to talk to to car and get my
[00:31:22] dice
[00:31:25] bag yeah see so what I was thinking was
[00:31:27] if I open up the bloom Barrow all right
[00:31:30] that gives us a dice then the dice with
[00:31:33] the other one would make four dice so
[00:31:36] you get a uh there's four people that
[00:31:38] could potentially get a dice or maybe
[00:31:40] one person get multiple dices if we do
[00:31:41] the break because I already have one of
[00:31:44] them and I'm like you know what I want
[00:31:45] to open another one but my thought was
[00:31:47] if I have multiple dice for you guys to
[00:31:50] go with it that would be nice for going
[00:31:52] in the break
[00:31:54] there that was kind of my thought
[00:31:56] actually what do you think
[00:32:01] give you guys some dice in the
[00:32:05] break along with
[00:32:07] it I don't know what are your thoughts
[00:32:11] would that be something you guys would
[00:32:12] like or is that just a a silly thing
[00:32:17] sometimes I like those little weird
[00:32:19] extras personally I don't
[00:32:23] know I don't know I don't know all right
[00:32:30] we're going to pull it that's what we'll
[00:32:32] do we're going to make a poll here give

[00:49:40] after we'll Shuffle those up now there
[00:49:43] we
[00:49:44] go all right here we go we're gonna open
[00:49:46] this baby
[00:49:49] up how do I get a distributor well I
[00:49:53] actually worked through a another store
[00:49:56] I talk to about getting it through them
[00:49:58] and pretty much the amount that I buy
[00:50:00] allows them to buy more at a cheaper
[00:50:02] price so it works out for all of
[00:50:06] us that's why um that's kind of really
[00:50:09] what
[00:50:12] happened I'm working on getting my own
[00:50:15] Warehouse though um in the not too
[00:50:16] distant future because once I get on a
[00:50:18] boat I can't be having a I can't be
[00:50:20] having my stuff with me all of it so I'm
[00:50:22] going to have to have a warehouse where
[00:50:23] some of it can leave and it can be drop
[00:50:25] shipped from so when I have that I will
[00:50:27] actually be accessed to a distributor
[00:50:29] you can't get access to a distributor
[00:50:30] unless you have a store kind of thing
[00:50:32] that's the only that was uh that sucks a
[00:50:34] little bit but you can't do anything
[00:50:35] about that that's their rules change
[00:50:37] them a little while back Siege smash
[00:50:40] ather Spike expanding ooze FedEd

[00:51:03] Bloom Sage of the inoy and foil Little
[00:51:06] Mountain and foil and a St gorger
[00:51:12] weird yeah yeah exactly yep the most
[00:51:16] part uh up until a certain amount so
[00:51:18] like with the when it comes to
[00:51:19] Distributors and stuff like that so
[00:51:22] that's why helping I buy a good chunk we
[00:51:24] were able to help out and stuff yeah
[00:51:25] exactly
[00:51:30] oh there you go all right so that's what
[00:51:31] it is you just needed to back out and
[00:51:32] come back in weirdly there must be a
[00:51:34] glitch going on right now where you just
[00:51:35] have to back out and come back
[00:51:37] in there you go so like I said a dollar
[00:51:40] and someone off there you are
[00:51:42] aha a little bit off not exactly that
[00:51:44] much off I guess it depends on your
[00:51:46] location um but anyways those are the
[00:51:49] two big those are the two ones that we
[00:51:50] had pulled out of there not bad so far
[00:51:53] for two packs a little bit of a discount
[00:52:02] thank you thank
[00:52:05] you yeah so it actually it goes down it
[00:52:08] just doesn't see it show sometimes so
[00:52:09] what I like to do yeah so that then what
[00:52:11] I'm planning on trying to do is get a
[00:52:12] store running myself I was debating on
[00:52:14] having a store Front in my area because
[00:52:16] there's an empty there's an empty shop
[00:52:18] that's not big that I was debating on
[00:52:19] doing instead of having the warehouse
[00:52:22] but that means I'm going to have to have
[00:52:23] somebody pay somebody to run it and
[00:52:25] stuff like that I don't know if I have
[00:52:26] any in the area I trust I mean I could
[00:52:28] have my mom do it but I don't know if
[00:52:30] she's old what I grandma run this store
[00:52:32] you know what I mean when I'm out on a
[00:52:34] boat malev Rumble draw claw thraen charm
[00:52:39] thriving skyclaw utter insignificance
[00:52:41] Sheltering landscape snapping void craw
[00:52:44] hope Ender codal Idol of the false gods
[00:52:48] reing bolt is that
[00:52:51] generator savin's Reclamation not bad on
[00:52:55] that one a little rare
[00:52:57] party Thrasher double rare pack not bad
[00:52:59] party Thrasher o and a devour of Destiny
[00:53:02] rare foil I'll take that one this foil
[00:53:06] is a nice that is a nice foil right
[00:53:08] there that is like a really good
[00:53:10] conditioned foil there I like that one
[00:53:14] put that in a sleeve right away there
[00:53:16] you go few nice packs that was a nice
[00:53:19] pack yeah exactly that's what I'm saying
[00:53:21] it's too much overhead that's why I just
[00:53:22] want to do like a
[00:53:23] warehouse and um have them Shi for me
[00:53:26] from there but the thing is though I
[00:53:28] might have a hard time getting
[00:53:30] everything because of the store and not
[00:53:32] having people have um having like a
[00:53:34] physical location to have games and
[00:53:36] stuff so that's why I try to do every
[00:53:37] weekend we've been trying to build out
[00:53:39] doing games on here every weekend we do
[00:53:41] so that way we can show we do games
[00:53:43] regularly with Wizards we have game game
[00:53:46] nights and we do um so that if we I can
[00:53:48] try to get wizards be like hey I'm I'm
[00:53:49] like a store I'm just virtual I just
[00:53:51] happen to be unable to have a physical
[00:53:53] location because we travel and instead
[00:53:55] what we'll do is we uh we'll like uh
[00:53:57] like go to like different stores in the
[00:53:59] area wherever we haven't have traveling
[00:54:01] and or if there's no store maybe we'll
[00:54:03] just uh see if there's enough people in
[00:54:05] the area that want to participate and
[00:54:07] what we do is uh get like a function
[00:54:09] hall a small like room in a function
[00:54:11] hall type thing and do a couple games or
[00:54:13] something like that that my thought
[00:54:14] process at
[00:54:16] least all right
[00:54:19] holding see the store part of that's the
[00:54:21] problem with like Wizards and other
[00:54:22] places to get things right away Holden
[00:54:24] you got the shooter elf not a big hit
[00:54:28] but it gets you a
[00:54:32] discount yeah I have an
[00:54:34] LC um I don't so I have uh the tax
[00:54:38] breaks aren't the problem I already have
[00:54:40] the LLC with the tax break stuff it's
[00:54:42] actually um the access to wizards they
[00:54:45] want you to have a storefront I believe
[00:54:48] to be able to show um the distributor
[00:54:51] wants you to have a storefront to be
[00:54:52] able to show like you have people coming
[00:54:54] into your store um I have a store front
[00:54:56] but mine's a virtual storefront if that
[00:54:58] makes any sense Al
[00:55:02] Sharpshooter so but for me that's my
[00:55:04] only

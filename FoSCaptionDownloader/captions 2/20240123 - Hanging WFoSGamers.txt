[00:32:44] tie um and on your second attempt it
[00:32:48] just doesn't work um the third attempt
[00:32:52] you just need to give up because that

[00:42:56] problem doing that I just write the
[00:42:57] prices down so I have a better idea what
[00:42:59] I'm like where they are and sometimes
[00:43:00] the prices change over time just because
[00:43:02] they change over time so I don't always
[00:43:05] update them on this but I might change
[00:43:07] them um like I kind of know what they're
[00:43:09] supposed to be if that makes sense like
[00:43:10] I know what they're around or not
[00:43:12] comfortable with at so like I'm G to put
[00:43:14] these ones on coming on next are going
[00:43:16] to be $12 I believe a
[00:43:20] piece not $12 a piece uh $9 a piece so
[00:43:24] what's going to come on next
[00:43:28] [Music]
[00:43:30] all
[00:43:31] right we have a skullport
[00:43:34] Nexus bag and surge
[00:43:37] foil mirx foil extended
[00:43:41] art Gand off the white Serge foil
[00:43:44] showcase we have two sunbit
[00:43:48] Canyons we have a slive mizette hive
[00:43:52] mind cyber conversion uh foil extend art
[00:43:57] and we're back to the beginning there
[00:43:59] that's just $9 for any of those if you
[00:44:01] would like them and as I said the prices
[00:44:03] are written on the sleeve and that's
[00:44:04] just from when I initially wrote them
[00:44:06] down at some point now they're just more
[00:44:08] of a placeholder of where they are for
[00:44:12] kind of what the price range I throw it
[00:44:13] at some
[00:44:25] point
[00:44:39] all right no uh who knows if anybody
[00:44:42] wants any of those but we shall see what
[00:44:45] I'm going to do next though is we'll put
[00:44:47] on another pack deal since the boys
[00:44:49] picked one out no one went with any of
[00:44:51] the pack deals I'm G to pick one out for
[00:44:54] people and see if anybody wants to go

[01:47:16] before kind of keep going through them
[01:47:18] like this

[01:47:29] our little draft one here we're going to
[01:47:32] grab another
[01:47:39] draft
[01:47:41] and maybe this is what's turning people
[01:47:44] off I I'm not the commander master so
[01:47:46] we're going to try it a little different
[01:47:47] now and we're going to do an internal
[01:47:48] Masters kind of like a little bit of a
[01:47:50] dra thing with a little little thing

[01:48:41] is but I have a bunch of different stuff
[01:48:43] I'm just throwing up random things so
[01:48:46] it's whatever comes out random that I

[01:54:15] your stuff right here there we
[01:54:18] go
[01:54:21] broken B broken
[01:54:24] gaming yeah no problem no problem I got
[01:54:27] a bunch of random things that I have on
[01:54:29] a regular basis that I try going through
[01:54:31] for people so that's nice that you got
[01:54:32] something that'll fit in I like I don't
[01:54:34] have a Zombie Deck so for me I'm like
[01:54:36] that's a really cool looking card but
[01:54:37] I'm like I'm never going to use it I
[01:54:39] don't have a Zombie Deck or anything
[01:54:40] right now so and if I really wanted a
[01:54:42] Zombie Deck later on in like few years I
[01:54:44] can always go find one and buy it again
[01:54:46] you know that type of thing but uh so I
[01:54:49] figured I may give it to somebody that
[01:54:50] wants to use it you know might as well
[01:54:51] rather than just sitting in my
[01:54:53] collection so that being said I was
[01:54:56] going to do my dollar singles before and
[01:54:58] scroll through those so I'm gonna do I'm
[01:55:00] G to try this again one more time here
[01:55:02] and I'm make sure I have it on a dollar
[01:55:03] this time when I
[01:55:06] start there you go we're actually on a
[01:55:09] dollar this time now these I'm just
[01:55:11] going to scroll through if you want one
[01:55:14] or you want to say something about one
[01:55:15] let me know and I will um stop and look
[01:55:20] you can just see there's a lot of
[01:55:23] foils uh Retros and stuff like that that
[01:55:25] you'll find in here that are the dollar
[01:55:29] singles
[01:55:31] um maybe a prow
[01:55:37] animes debt to the deathless
[01:55:39] foil itch in the back I hate when you
[01:55:42] got an itch in the middle of your
[01:55:44] back PR etch BL
[01:55:48] obedience
[01:55:50] laa R abrial raser Shadow denan Signet
[01:55:55] scrap crawler few few of them here for
[01:55:59] dollar
[01:56:00] ones couple foils of invasion of
[01:56:04] rabika then we're smoldering
[01:56:11] Marsh there is anything you
[01:56:14] like here's a slow zombie all right now
[01:56:17] here slow zombie that's interesting I
[01:56:19] don't know any of them that were always
[01:56:20] slow zombie start ones every time I see
[01:56:23] a zombie one it's always like a fast one
[01:56:24] where something needs to die off quick
[01:56:28] and um get you a lot of life or
[01:56:30] something like
[01:56:33] that clay Champion extend
[01:56:38] art but this is a bunch of my
[01:56:42] $1 singles if there is anyone that you
[01:56:46] want that you might be interested just
[01:56:48] go throw it out there say it or tell me
[01:56:51] to stop go
[01:56:53] back because I do have a bunch of them
[01:56:55] that's part of my problem because I have
[01:56:57] too many of them but I have to like do
[01:56:59] probably
[01:57:01] longer longer uh dollar single things
[01:57:04] here so I can get through them all but I
[01:57:06] never
[01:57:07] do I never do I always do the same thing
[01:57:10] I'm like oh crap I'm gonna run out of
[01:57:17] time that's what we got for a dollar in
[01:57:20] here if anybody wants
[01:57:39] them I ran out of time let me start that
[01:57:42] again because I ran out of time there
[01:57:44] and I'm going to run this for 30 seconds
[01:57:46] here so I think that's going to be
[01:57:48] enough time for me to finish
[01:57:51] guess if I go through all the
[01:57:53] singles uh dollar ones I'm going to have
[01:57:55] this put them on for a little longer
[01:57:57] than um um two minutes
[01:58:01] now as you can see a lot of
[01:58:06] foils most of the stuff that I pull I
[01:58:08] crack open for my family that we do as
[01:58:10] collector boosters so that's why you get
[01:58:12] a lot of foils and like rro things and
[01:58:14] stuff like that because that's all that
[01:58:15] you kind of get out of
[01:58:18] those now if you guys are having a hard
[01:58:20] time seeing these or you want me to slow
[01:58:22] down you can say hey slow down I don't
[01:58:26] mind
[01:58:28] that and we're back to the beginning of
[01:58:30] those but that was all the dollar ones
[01:58:32] there between
[01:58:34] uh the stacks that we pulled out so
[01:58:38] that's all the dollar ones right here if
[01:58:40] you wanted any of those ones we just
[01:58:42] went through all those you can let me
[01:58:45] know and I'll throw that on but at the
[01:58:47] moment I'm going to find a pack deal for
[01:58:51] everyone we're going to do this I want
[01:58:53] to put an aoria pack deal I know not
[01:58:54] everyone's going to want this but
[01:58:56] whatever I'm probably going to lose
[01:58:57] viewers from
[01:59:00] this let's go and do this for an aoria
[01:59:03] deal Let's do an aoria let's do in a

[02:38:42] you very
[02:38:44] much
[02:38:46] thank you very much I appreciate
[02:38:50] that I had to change how I do things
[02:38:53] because uh I now end up now the way I
[02:38:55] handle myself is I end up getting bigger
[02:38:57] bags to put everybody's stuff in so that
[02:39:00] it all stays together because I used to
[02:39:01] have it where I wrote everybody's name
[02:39:03] on like the the cards the packs and
[02:39:06] stuff and um so I changed the way I'm
[02:39:09] doing things I I'll just say that I did
[02:39:12] I ended up changing the way I'm doing
[02:39:14] things but thank you much for letting me
[02:39:16] know
[02:39:20] there I very much appreciate
[02:39:27] that all right here we go let me put
[02:39:29] those back because I did go through
[02:39:31] those and I'll be on for about 20 more
[02:39:33] minutes here then I'm gonna be um
[02:39:36] jumping off and I see gasan did jump in
[02:39:40] gishan it's Gan I'm guessing Gan 93 with
[02:39:44] uh trying to lock on the the mystery
[02:39:46] carnival game so with that I'll explain
[02:39:50] that a little bit for everybody for
[02:39:52] those that have not seen it happen
[02:39:53] before but what the mystery carnival
[02:39:55] game is is you have each one of these
[02:39:58] has packs written on them you pull out
[02:40:01] three of those normally it would be like
[02:40:04] when the suns are here the sun would
[02:40:05] pull one out I would pull one out and
[02:40:08] then you would pull one out but because
[02:40:10] the suns are not here and it's just me
[02:40:11] right now I let you pick one for the
[02:40:13] Mystery Pack uh for the sons and then I
[02:40:17] pick one for the father and then you
[02:40:18] pick one for the
[02:40:20] buyer and then what we do is we crack
[02:40:23] those packs open and we line them up in
[02:40:26] front of these and what happens is
[02:40:28] whoever whichever one has the highest
[02:40:30] mono value hits his Target and you get
[02:40:32] pretty much you get something extra
[02:40:33] maybe maybe it's like a
[02:40:37] uh maybe it's an extra card of you know
[02:40:41] some kind maybe it's card you might want
[02:40:43] to play maybe it's an extra pack I don't
[02:40:45] know depends on your luck but you always
[02:40:47] get the three packs that are opened
[02:40:49] every single time it's just whether or
[02:40:51] not you get the little extra on top of
[02:40:53] it fun thing that's really what it is
[02:40:54] the kids wanted to play a game so we had
[02:40:56] to figure out some game for them to play
[02:40:58] where everybody wins something in a way
[02:41:00] if that makes sense you always get your
[02:41:02] packs is really what it boils down to
[02:41:03] you your main thing is the packs it's
[02:41:04] just if you get something extra so with
[02:41:07] that being said um where would you like
[02:41:10] to go on the
[02:41:13] um on the father
[02:41:16] on the Son and the buyer pull and then I
[02:41:19] will pull out one for the father
[02:41:25] after hey lost how you
[02:41:28] doing random for all of them I can
[02:41:31] definitely do that no problem so I'm
[02:41:32] going to do this I'm going to grab one
[02:41:34] from here and put that one in front of
[02:41:37] the
[02:41:38] buyer I'm going to put this one for the
[02:41:42] sun we're going to put this one for the
[02:41:45] father all right so this is what we're
[02:41:47] at right now for our
[02:41:49] stuff now would you like to leave the
[02:41:53] cards where they are let me angle it
[02:41:56] down a little bit so you can see maybe a
[02:41:57] little bit better would you like to
[02:41:58] leave the cards where they are or would
[02:42:00] you like to change them and move them
[02:42:02] your art cards here as you can see what
[02:42:04] the art cards are sometimes people like
[02:42:05] to move them
[02:42:06] around we're not doing too bad hanging

[02:42:20] feeling like I'm going to die and throw
[02:42:22] up and all that other
[02:42:23] stuff switch buyer and father all right

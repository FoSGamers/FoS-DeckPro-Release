[00:29:10] three
[00:29:12] islands I only have three islands so
[00:29:15] four and

[00:29:26] here all right
[00:29:29] [Music]
[00:29:48] um okay looks like they're all
[00:29:55] like 274 274 2 74 they're all the same
[00:30:01] ones so put those
[00:30:05] together 274 there's two of them in that
[00:30:07] one just so you're aware those are going
[00:30:10] to be we'll say like uh dollar those I'm
[00:30:14] guessing these are all going to be about
[00:30:16] a dollar for each one of these so we'll
[00:30:17] do let me just double check just to make
[00:30:19] sure I'm not trying to screw you and
[00:30:20] take more money than
[00:30:22] I'm Mountain
[00:30:30] no filters
[00:30:37] foil
[00:30:40] set there we
[00:30:52] go there that should help narrow that
[00:30:55] down
[00:30:58] same thing one two
[00:31:00] three thought I had four of those four
[00:31:03] okay so a dollar for those and guessing
[00:31:06] a dollar for everything it's really what
[00:31:07] it's going to be so it's gonna be
[00:31:08] probably four bucks here five bucks
[00:31:11] here is what my guess
[00:31:19] is uh why is it not using all my things
[00:31:22] that I gave it
[00:31:34] okay all right same
[00:31:37] thing pretty sure they're all the same
[00:31:39] my guess
[00:31:56] is yep
[00:31:58] and then
[00:32:03] planes
[00:32:15] no yeah there we go all right
[00:32:19] so
[00:32:26] one $1 for your

[00:34:43] we have today I'm not doing anything
[00:34:44] over the top this afternoon I wasn't
[00:34:45] having any giant plans with it but I was
[00:34:46] going to do some cool giveaways one two
[00:34:48] three four five six seven eight I was
[00:34:51] planning on doing some cool giveaways
[00:34:52] for the buyers because generally when we
[00:34:53] do things like this I can do some cool
[00:34:56] buyers giveaways because I'm not doing
[00:34:57] the other big giveaways so if we have
[00:34:59] buyers in here no one hangs around when
[00:35:00] I'm not doing continuous giveaways
[00:35:01] except if they're buyers
[00:35:04] so that's I'm not doing them that way I
[00:35:06] figure this is a good afternoon for the
[00:35:07] buyers to hang out here Grand entryway
[00:35:09] elegant
[00:35:10] rotunda frantic s frantic
[00:35:15] strength all right fear of the lost
[00:35:18] teeth dagger M Medallion megadon I keep
[00:35:22] saying that wrong piranha
[00:35:25] fly all right do that
[00:35:28] hand that feeds fear of surveillance
[00:35:31] flood pits drowner inquisitive glimmer o
[00:35:34] withering torment in the uh showcase
[00:35:36] there I like that one oh yes a special
[00:35:39] guess
[00:35:41] expropriate look at that nice oh
[00:35:45] beautiful borderless special guest and a
[00:35:47] silent Hall creeper also on top of it in
[00:35:50] rare with an island and a glimmer burst
[00:35:52] foil nice one there with a tote with a
[00:35:55] art
[00:35:56] one not too bad so far I mean it's not
[00:35:58] the best but it's definitely a pretty
[00:36:00] fun set I do have to say I will have to
[00:36:02] admit I do like the uh the 80s is style
[00:36:05] here um with the with this thing with
[00:36:08] the um showcase and kind of those
[00:36:10] profile Arts that you get I will have to
[00:36:12] admit that but um so far the set's been
[00:36:15] okay there's been some good cards but
[00:36:17] there's been some disappointments on
[00:36:18] some other ones like uh you know there's
[00:36:20] some things that come out you're reading
[00:36:21] yeah that's probably going to instantly
[00:36:22] get banned but hey you know I don't know
[00:36:24] we'll find out though that's a nice
[00:36:26] pickup there wither torment I'm going
[00:36:28] have to check out xpro I think I I need
[00:36:30] to keep this need to keep this one for
[00:36:32] mine now starting with you each player
[00:36:34] votes for your time or money for each
[00:36:36] time vote take an extra turn after this
[00:36:39] one for each money vote choose a
[00:36:40] permanent own by the voter and gain
[00:36:42] control of it oh oh oh I like it oh I
[00:36:47] like that card a lot I actually may oh
[00:36:50] do I want to keep that destroy C
[00:36:51] creature or enchantment you lose two
[00:36:53] life H silent Hall creeper can't be
[00:36:56] blocked
[00:36:58] deals combat damage to a player choose
[00:36:59] one that hasn't been chosen put a one-
[00:37:01] one counter on silent draw a card silent
[00:37:04] becomes a copy of another not bad not
[00:37:06] bad I like the expropriate
[00:37:09] though put that in with our other one
[00:37:11] here I have a feeling that's worth a bit
[00:37:13] it may not though I may be off on that
[00:37:15] because sometimes those special guests
[00:37:16] throw me off and they're like 10 cents
[00:37:19] I've done that before I'm like oh wow
[00:37:20] that's awesome like no that that card
[00:37:22] was worth
[00:37:23] nothing what do you guys think though
[00:37:25] what do you think space pirate what do
[00:37:26] you think so far of of um bestor I mean
[00:37:29] we've had some fun with it here um I

[00:55:23] it's going to be like 70 cents or
[00:55:26] something like that so I can put them
[00:55:27] together for a dollar for you if you'd
[00:55:29] like give me a second
[00:55:31] here I think that was in this
[00:55:40] one
[00:55:43] nope ah all right I get what you're
[00:55:46] saying you like to have all that makes
[00:55:47] sense May makees
[00:55:49] sense they try to do that so you have
[00:55:51] options all right so it must have been
[00:55:52] the back one then that we did put in
[00:55:54] here
[00:55:56] Marvin I did just get rid of a Marvin
[00:55:58] but I might have a
[00:56:01] Toby I swear I had the arella right
[00:56:03] there but maybe it was the next one
[00:56:06] down let's check that right
[00:56:10] there Toby sounds familiar
[00:56:13] though Toby does sound familiar I feel
[00:56:16] like I pulled that out here I'll have to
[00:56:18] check it quickly
[00:56:22] though it's going to be the last pack
[00:56:24] that I go to for the arrow Bella cuz
[00:56:27] that's how the that's how the world
[00:56:28] works
[00:56:31] right oh no worries I'm looking for
[00:56:34] something right now so taking taking a
[00:56:36] second but let me look for the other one
[00:56:43] here oh you got to be kidding me it's
[00:56:45] going to be the last pack that I look at
[00:56:48] huh
[00:56:52] always yeah yeah I have uh I've seen him
[00:56:56] I don't think I I don't I don't remember
[00:56:57] if I pulled them out from me recently or
[00:56:59] what that's kind of what I was getting
[00:57:03] at what I just pulled Arabella out how
[00:57:07] is that wrong how am I missing that I
[00:57:09] just literally pulled that one out of
[00:57:19] there I hit I love when you do stuff
[00:57:22] like that and you're like where' it
[00:57:24] go vious clown from the last thing that
[00:57:28] I showed you vicious clown I can grab
[00:57:31] that I can grab that over here
[00:57:34] zero the last pack that I showed you
[00:57:39] there that was this
[00:57:43] one vicious
[00:57:47] clown where was
[00:57:50] Arabella where was
[00:57:53] Arabella it's got to be this one
[00:57:56] it's got to be this one ah come
[00:58:03] on what
[00:58:07] what yes well that's what I looked in I
[00:58:09] looked in the last pack I opened I
[00:58:11] thought it was Arabella was in there but
[00:58:14] I keep mistaking where I don't know what
[00:58:15] I did with it I just messed them all up
[00:58:17] and moved them all around that's a
[00:58:19] goddamn problem that's part of
[00:58:21] it oh hold on
[00:58:26] there's your reason why it was stuck the
[00:58:28] goddamn back of the
[00:58:30] card I'm trying to find it and I
[00:58:33] couldn't because every time I open it it
[00:58:34] was stuck in the
[00:58:36] card
[00:58:40] seriously like I know I just looked in
[00:58:42] that pack but
[00:58:45] okay here you go let me uh Toby sounds
[00:58:48] familiar give me a
[00:58:49] second feel like is H that a rare I feel
[00:58:52] like that's a rare
[00:58:59] uh maybe I didn't pull it
[00:59:01] out maybe I didn't pull it out yet might
[00:59:04] have been for somebody
[00:59:07] else balloon man yeah you like the

[01:00:28] through more stuff it's up to you what's
[01:00:30] current damage right kaido was like $
[01:00:34] and I think these ones are all not giant
[01:00:36] hits so give me a second here I think
[01:00:37] those are all like a little little Min
[01:00:39] things but give me a sec to find that
[01:00:42] all right here we go Arabella yep there
[01:00:45] you go like I said Arabella wasn't a big
[01:00:46] one and that's in foil fatica was only
[01:00:51] 30 cents I mean s
[01:00:54] cents then and the Jolly balloonman I
[01:00:59] think is like another dollar maybe oh
[01:01:01] there you go $2 so
[01:01:04] that's two
[01:01:07] three 2
[01:01:09] N and vicious clown that one you didn't

[01:01:24] foil why isn't it show
[01:01:38] showing that is so weird hold on a
[01:01:45] second there you go like I said not much
[01:01:48] on that so we'll call these Dollar Plus
[01:01:52] $2 plus $9 so $10 $12 for all of them
[01:01:56] together sound like a plan
[01:02:00] there no not a problem at all not really
[01:02:02] doing this wasn't a big plan on the show
[01:02:04] afternoon ones aren't really giant ones
[01:02:06] here for me so I always like to uh try
[01:02:09] to do something else you
[01:02:12] know yeah definitely if you want yeah
[01:02:14] let me put them off the side here
[01:02:15] definitely if you want to watch for more
[01:02:17] like I said if you'd like to I have zero
[01:02:18] issues with people doing that I've had
[01:02:20] people do that many times before like
[01:02:22] hey can I uh hold on and put those off
[01:02:24] the side for me and then instead of
[01:02:26] buying them all individually and pay for
[01:02:28] like b a bunch of shippings together you
[01:02:30] can pay for like one shipping
[01:02:32] item all right so I'm going to put this
[01:02:35] off to the side and I'm going to write
[01:02:37] actually a little
[01:02:38] baggie and put your name on it so I

[01:32:35] it I just forgot what I was about to do
[01:32:38] damn
[01:32:39] it my brain
[01:32:41] broke oh I remember now these are the
[01:32:44] other cool things that they made that
[01:32:46] we're going to be using in a uh in one
[01:32:48] of our things this for Halloween they
[01:32:51] make these like kind of Crystal Skull
[01:32:52] like things so we're going to use these
[01:32:54] we're going to do a hunt for the Crystal
[01:32:55] Skull this Halloween in one of our uh
[01:32:58] well we're going to make a game we're
[01:32:59] going to do kind of like a mystery box
[01:33:00] game we'll build up for guys it'll be a
[01:33:03] it'll hunt for the crystal skull with
[01:33:04] these things if you find these in it
[01:33:06] you'll obviously you'll get the Crystal
[01:33:07] Skull but on top of that you'll get a uh
[01:33:10] you'll get whatever comes in the box
[01:33:12] there you know the crystal skulls will
[01:33:13] be like the big hits kind of there you
[01:33:17] go oh you can use them as zombie tokens
[01:33:20] even yeah that would actually not be a
[01:33:22] bad idea I uh somebody told me I needed
[01:33:24] to dress up as Indie with my uh my
[01:33:26] Indiana Jones hat that I
[01:33:29] have but yeah I figured I thought that
[01:33:31] those were kind of cool like nothing
[01:33:32] special but they just seemed like kind
[01:33:34] of cool especially for coming up with
[01:33:36] Halloween I was like yeah try it out
[01:33:38] that was the other kind of cool thing
[01:33:39] that we got there but if you guys want

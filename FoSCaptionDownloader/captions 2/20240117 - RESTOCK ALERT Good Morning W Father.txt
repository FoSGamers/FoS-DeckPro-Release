[00:11:29] not having them hang out here with me
[00:11:31] inside if it's a nice day it's been a
[00:11:33] kind of crappy here where we were in
[00:11:35] Florida for a little bit like the um
[00:11:37] it's been like just like rainy and stuff
[00:11:39] so let me get this here slide that in

[00:11:57] whatnot as doing sales themselves know
[00:12:00] how to reorder your stuff that is put in
[00:12:03] the buy now because I would very much
[00:12:05] like to do that I'd very much like to do
[00:12:09] that it's one of those things where
[00:12:11] you're like trying to figure it out and
[00:12:13] I have yet to do it I've kind of given
[00:12:18] up and just kind of let it stay the way
[00:12:20] it is but I would very much like to put
[00:12:22] like in a different order because every
[00:12:23] time you add something new if it's like
[00:12:25] something that I you know maybe it's a
[00:12:26] little older but I don't necessar want
[00:12:28] it the top but ends up going to the top
[00:12:29] like seriously I don't want it
[00:12:33] there put my tablet away that's why I
[00:12:35] have no room on that
[00:12:38] cter there we go thank you we'll throw
[00:12:42] up a pack deal coming up for you
[00:12:47] all oh thank
[00:12:49] you well yeah if anybody knows how to do
[00:12:52] that that would be pretty appreciate if
[00:12:53] Mike happens to that'd be cool all right
[00:12:55] so what I'm going to do here is I've
[00:12:56] actually got some new stuff so I have um
[00:12:58] I got some uh dungeon dragons that my
[00:13:00] son liked the dragons that's why we got
[00:13:02] it mainly um then we also have some
[00:13:06] aoria if anybody is interested in that
[00:13:08] that's a that those are collector
[00:13:10] boosters we were liking the um boosters
[00:13:12] so we decided to get some collectors
[00:13:14] there's a stuff we had before we also
[00:13:17] picked up I got some more Commander
[00:13:20] Masters if people are interested in that
[00:13:23] and I also have another box of Doctor
[00:13:26] Who over here kind of have them all a
[00:13:28] little set up over here like this now
[00:13:29] that we kind of see a little bit so what
[00:13:31] I'm going to throw
[00:13:34] up hey yeah I have a question for you
[00:13:36] Godzilla cards yeah we can try that to
[00:13:38] bill um how do you do you know how to
[00:13:41] reorder stuff in the buy now because
[00:13:43] you've been doing this for a little bit
[00:13:44] here and I have I've been doing it for
[00:13:46] not too as long as others and every time
[00:13:49] I add something to the buy now it goes
[00:13:51] to like the top um if it goes into Mone
[00:13:55] of my shows and I've been trying to
[00:13:56] figure out how to reorder it for like a
[00:13:59] while now I typed it in and I did a
[00:14:01] search for
[00:14:02] reordering and it kept coming up with
[00:14:04] different sites so that's why I was
[00:14:05] trying to figure out if anybody knew how
[00:14:07] to do it I asked quickly and he asked if
[00:14:09] you would you might
[00:14:11] know that's all it was kind of an
[00:14:13] interest just a question I was trying to
[00:14:16] figure out but you know what I'm gonna
[00:14:18] do here I'm gonna do this actually we're
[00:14:19] gonna do this we're gonna throw this up
[00:14:23] we're going to do one of
[00:14:24] this and we're going to try out some
[00:14:27] Godzilla let's see what we can do for
[00:14:28] Godzilla this morning all right I
[00:14:31] haven't had this one for long at all so
[00:14:35] let's do
[00:14:41] this where is um all
[00:14:56] right all right
[00:15:04] what do you call
[00:15:12] that we will call
[00:15:15] that yes we'll do that that is what it
[00:15:18] will
[00:15:26] be that is what it will be there we're
[00:15:28] going to do
[00:15:30] that I can get it to
[00:15:32] work it defaults so when you want to hit
[00:15:35] the first number Compu def FSE
[00:15:38] numbers yeah did freeze again for a
[00:15:41] second I'm having an issue here
[00:15:43] hopefully it doesn't keep going that
[00:15:46] stinks I keep having weird
[00:15:50] glitches all right we're g to put this
[00:15:51] one on anyways going to put this on for
[00:15:54] 39 for these
[00:15:57] three
[00:16:02] see if anybody wants to go uh Godzilla
[00:16:08] hunting default yeah def youli order so
[00:16:11] when you hit the number first okay to
[00:16:14] defaults the numbers first then
[00:16:16] alphabetical yeah I noticed that yeah I
[00:16:18] was just trying to figure out if there
[00:16:19] was a way to do
[00:16:21] um do a uh yeah to change it till it
[00:16:24] wasn't alphabetical or something like
[00:16:26] that but I do have yeah number I
[00:16:28] understand we could do number first I
[00:16:30] guess you can put like a number in front
[00:16:31] but I was trying to do like um a flat
[00:16:33] out order like you know drag and drop
[00:16:35] maybe or whatever I couldn't even find
[00:16:37] it because you I don't know whatever I
[00:16:39] know they don't always have drag and
[00:16:40] drop things making them easy I was
[00:16:42] hoping I could do it in some way but it
[00:16:44] sounds like I'd have to go and put a
[00:16:45] number in front of each one for the
[00:16:47] order that I wanted to be
[00:16:51] in that way I can default it to like um
[00:16:54] whatever I want but here yeah that was
[00:16:56] just some aoria we we got that in if

[00:28:41] account because every time I do anything
[00:28:42] with I have three screens it goes black
[00:28:44] on the other screen and not to see it so
[00:28:46] I guess I'm gonna make a second account

[01:13:21] you yeah I've uh on I4 we were um we
[01:13:25] have to go down there way lot more often
[01:13:27] than I would ever like to just having to
[01:13:29] go to my son's soccer game [Â __Â ] well
[01:13:31] it's not soccer game [Â __Â ] I mean it's
[01:13:33] really he does a really good into soccer
[01:13:35] actually um so cool story is my um my
[01:13:39] son is on a soccer team with
[01:13:45] um with um one of the kids who happens
[01:13:49] to be on the like the junior Orlando MLS
[01:13:53] team
[01:13:54] and um so my son plays with the younger
[01:13:59] brother of this kid that's on the team
[01:14:01] and his father happens to be the
[01:14:02] coach um in my youngest Nolan um he's I
[01:14:07] was like oh he's good at soccer but I
[01:14:08] didn't think he was like great at soccer
[01:14:10] you know what I
[01:14:11] mean um so with the coach say came up to
[01:14:16] us one day I'm gonna put these on for 30
[01:14:18] for you all
[01:14:19] right came up to us after one of the
[01:14:22] practices letting us know no one's doing
[01:14:24] a really good
[01:14:25] job um and he
[01:14:28] um he said that he's better than my son
[01:14:33] which is the youngest one that was there
[01:14:34] and I'm like well that's an interesting
[01:14:35] thing to say well it's kind of a GL
[01:14:36] compliment thank you and I was starting
[01:14:38] to think about it after was uh there's
[01:14:41] your pack deal there um but um he said
[01:14:46] that his youngest son is better than his
[01:14:48] oldest son by far his oldest son is on
[01:14:53] the um MLS like junior team so if his
[01:14:58] old younger son is better than the
[01:15:00] oldest son and my son is better than his
[01:15:02] son that means my son is potentially
[01:15:06] capable of being on like an MLS team and
[01:15:09] he's only
[01:15:10] nine I'm like that's not right that
[01:15:13] seems that I don't I can't do that right
[01:15:15] now you know what we're gonna have him
[01:15:17] be a kid if he wants to do it he's going
[01:15:18] to do his thing I'm not going to push
[01:15:19] him because I feel like if you push him
[01:15:21] then you're going to ruin the fun
[01:15:23] and by ruining the fun you're going to
[01:15:25] make him bad if that makes any sense I
[01:15:28] don't
[01:15:29] know but yeah we drive down we have to
[01:15:31] go down I4 all the time and dude you
[01:15:33] have to go either like 100 miles an hour
[01:15:35] or 17 miles an hour in the uh in the in
[01:15:38] the lane in the
[01:15:39] um in the uh traveling Lane because it's
[01:15:43] it's just nuts how it is all right let's
[01:15:46] get this up here for
[01:15:47] you let me know where you want to
[01:15:52] go
[01:15:54] yeah dude I was wicked proud I like oh
[01:15:55] what no way like I'm listening to it I'm
[01:15:57] like oh well thank you for telling me
[01:15:59] he's good he's better than your kid all
[01:16:00] right that's a good thing to hear I'm
[01:16:02] like thinking about it driving home and
[01:16:03] I'm
[01:16:04] like wait a minute he's better than
[01:16:07] yours you've told us many times that
[01:16:10] your youngest is better than your
[01:16:12] oldest

[01:16:17] we were actually debating on getting

[01:16:33] because I completely forgot about doing
[01:16:34] that
[01:16:35] earlier yeah I was actually really proud
[01:16:37] of it I was like oh I can't believe that
[01:16:39] a coach every said that about my kid I
[01:16:41] mean when I was in high school I

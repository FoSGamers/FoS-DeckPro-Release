[00:06:49] Then we had a friend, Miss Roxy, who is
[00:06:51] a uh who's a dwarf uh wielding a giant
[00:06:54] sword. She knows how to wield swords,
[00:06:56] she told us, so she got a big one. And
[00:06:58] then we have um our buddy JM, who was

[00:07:18] yesterday. I know. He made my box. We
[00:07:22] got a box ourselves open and ours was
[00:07:24] [Â __Â ] pathetic. I feel I feel you, Big
[00:07:25] B. That's all I got to say. I opened all
[00:07:28] of our stuff and the best hit we got was
[00:07:29] a dragon hot dragon. Uh, hold on. I'll
[00:07:32] show you the best hit we got. There was
[00:07:34] two. They were both $1. They weren't
[00:07:37] that great, but they were good, if that
[00:07:39] makes sense.
[00:07:42] So, we had
[00:07:44] um I think our two best hits, those were
[00:07:48] our two best hits out of it. Draco
[00:07:50] Genesis and Skirmish Rhino and
[00:07:51] Borderless, but those ones were already
[00:07:54] Yeah, we had a couple ones that we

[00:08:14] we'll go wander through right now. You
[00:08:16] just started out here. Now, um you kind
[00:08:19] of give me an idea for your character.
[00:08:20] Now, your character when they come in,
[00:08:22] they always start with a pistol and a
[00:08:24] knife as their first things. Okay,
[00:08:26] buddy. And then you're going to uh
[00:08:28] wander around the wasteland here. Let me
[00:08:30] know if you want
[00:08:31] to. It is a Halo uh No, not a Halo foil
[00:08:35] rhino. This is uh just a the I think
[00:08:37] this is just a regular foil. I don't
[00:08:39] know. Is it the Halo foil or regular
[00:08:41] foil? I think this is the regular
[00:08:43] foil. I think that's the regular foil on
[00:08:46] the
[00:08:48] Rhino. Yeah, the showcase whatever one.
[00:08:53] Yeah, let's wander. I like it. Aether
[00:08:56] Dragon says we're going to go wander the
[00:08:59] wasteland. Now, you uh my friend, you're
[00:09:02] in this first area. There's a few burnt
[00:09:03] out buildings. It's kind of generally
[00:09:05] where everybody uh pops up. No, I know.
[00:09:08] Well, I know. Not bad for an uncommon.
[00:09:10] Wait, this is a mythic
[00:09:13] card. So, was I looking at the wrong one
[00:09:16] or did they change it? Is it literally
[00:09:18] the same card? It's a
[00:09:20] lie. It's a
[00:09:23] lie. Wait. So, is it Hold on. Is
[00:09:28] it Where did I put it? I know. I got it
[00:09:30] here.
[00:09:33] It's a trap. Is it a trap?
[00:09:39] Huh? Is that what it
[00:09:43] is? Oh. Oh, okay. So, yes, you're
[00:09:48] wandering. And what happens here, my
[00:09:50] buddy Aether, is when you're wandering
[00:09:52] around, you um you get to a small town
[00:09:56] here. Okay. And in that small town, you
[00:10:00] happen
[00:10:00] to you see
[00:10:03] something skittering towards you in one
[00:10:05] of the buildings. You happen to go in.
[00:10:07] It's a hood
[00:10:10] wink. Now, my friend, aether dragon, you
[00:10:12] have to decide. You want to use uh now
[00:10:14] that is a has 15 health. You have 100
[00:10:16] when you start your pistol and your
[00:10:18] knife do plus two when you attack on
[00:10:21] your rolling. So, when you do this, you
[00:10:24] need to get an 11 or higher when you
[00:10:26] roll the d20 and then your d6 tells you
[00:10:29] your
[00:10:31] damage. Cuz normally it's a hoodwink was
[00:10:34] a good movie. was actually one of those
[00:10:36] ones I was like, you know what? Actually
[00:10:37] better than I expected. If that makes

[00:35:41] foil there. Glacier wood siege in a
[00:35:45] foil. That's a nice one there. Ooh, a

[00:35:50] That was like a 20 $15 card before. 12

[00:36:07] rare at the end there? Nice with a
[00:36:10] soldier token. Oh, we love those lands.
[00:36:12] We love real estate here.
[00:36:15] Real estate's always
[00:36:19] good. Oh, nice. It's good to hear that I
[00:36:22] pack similar to you guys. Like, see, one
[00:36:23] of the things is like um I have I have
[00:36:26] um I've gotten stuff in the past from
[00:36:27] other people and they didn't do anything
[00:36:28] wrong. They packaged it and and like um
[00:36:31] and very good. The only problem is it
[00:36:33] wasn't as good as I do it and like it
[00:36:36] must have been played with they must
[00:36:37] have played soccer with the package at
[00:36:38] the at the post office or something. So,
[00:36:41] after having a couple of mine come in
[00:36:42] that way, I was like, you know what? I
[00:36:44] got to do something a little different
[00:36:44] to make sure I don't have any problems.
[00:36:46] So, I pretty much what we do is I I take
[00:36:48] all the cardboard that we get in the box
[00:36:50] from that we get all the boxes that come
[00:36:52] in with all the all of our um product.
[00:36:54] We cut the cardboard up into little
[00:36:56] squares that are about the size of a top
[00:36:58] loader and we put them on the outside of
[00:37:00] everything to help keep them all um safe
[00:37:02] so that we don't have uh so that pretty
[00:37:05] much I had somebody tell me that they
[00:37:06] could drop their they they had their
[00:37:08] package pretty much dropped out of an
[00:37:09] airplane and nothing happened to it. So
[00:37:12] that's why I'm like, "Oh, sweet." That's
[00:37:14] why I like uh that's why I like um when
[00:37:16] everybody gets their stuff and that's
[00:37:17] why I try to do try to do to my
[00:37:19] packaging at least try to make it good.
[00:37:20] You know what I mean? Don't want to have
[00:37:22] any issues. It's not that I don't trust
[00:37:25] them to deliver the stuff. I just don't
[00:37:27] trust that they're gonna deliver it all
[00:37:30] the time without
[00:37:33] like it
[00:37:35] being in four
[00:37:40] pieces. Like somebody sent me a picture
[00:37:42] the other day of a package. They go,
[00:37:46] "Dude, your package got here, but I
[00:37:48] think they played soccer with it." And
[00:37:49] it was luckily it was it was a medium
[00:37:50] sized box from um like a one of those
[00:37:52] boxes, mediumsiz box, UPS box, USPS
[00:37:54] boxes. in the mediumsiz
[00:37:57] box. It looked like it was dented on
[00:38:00] every single corner, but because I
[00:38:01] bubble wrap everything and I tape it all
[00:38:03] together, nothing happened to his stuff.
[00:38:04] But I'm sitting there like, seriously?
[00:38:06] Like, what do they do to these things?
[00:38:08] They just like football them
[00:38:13] around. I can do that, Dalia. I'm good
[00:38:15] with that. I play We play all the time.
[00:38:18] Do some good magic here. And I like it.
[00:38:20] Now, we have something here. We have to
[00:38:22] um Mystic, did you choose a faction
[00:38:24] before by any chance? I can't remember
[00:38:26] if you did. You did, right? You turn the
[00:38:28] vault choose chose the Vaultorn,
[00:38:32] right? Yeah. All right. So, this is what
[00:38:35] happens. You You kill that mutated
[00:38:37] creature and you look for some body
[00:38:39] parts to bring home. Um and in the
[00:38:44] process, you happen to see this dude pop
[00:38:46] out of one of the buildings around the
[00:38:48] corner. You're like, "Oh [Â __Â ] Thank god
[00:38:49] I've been stuck here for effing days."
[00:38:52] Like that thing has been wandering
[00:38:53] around. I have not been able to get out
[00:38:54] of
[00:38:56] here. Oh no, you're not looking for body
[00:38:58] parts. Mystic is. So Mystic goes and
[00:39:01] finds um doesn't find what he's looking
[00:39:03] for because it looks like that mutated
[00:39:06] creature may have um may have never
[00:39:09] actually uh been fully formed. They just
[00:39:13] got a bunch of hair hanging.
[00:39:16] I know that is Mystic's freaky deicky
[00:39:18] stuff. So Mystic, you got to make a
[00:39:20] decision if you want to look for
[00:39:24] anything. Definitely, buddy. Let's um if
[00:39:27] you want to if you go to the link uh if
[00:39:29] you go to Linkree, the link for my link
[00:39:31] tree there, you should be able to access
[00:39:34] um all of my stuff to actually get to
[00:39:36] Discord and hang out with us. I have a
[00:39:38] Discord server.
[00:39:49] So for instance, if you guys would like
[00:39:51] to go
[00:39:56] here and you can always
[00:39:59] um you can always visit us. The link
[00:40:03] tree has all that to get in there to
[00:40:05] come uh come over and um hang out in our
[00:40:08] uh our um discord channel and we can
[00:40:11] have some fun, play some games. Let's
[00:40:13] talk to the NPC. I like
[00:40:16] it. All right, you take some hair from
[00:40:19] that mutated
[00:40:22] creature. Mystic and takes a look
[00:40:27] around. All right, we're going to get
[00:40:28] rid of those.
[00:40:32] You do have the dragon horn still
[00:40:35] and then you also have uh mutant hair.
[00:40:39] I feel like you should be in like one of
[00:40:40] those Rob rob zombie movies where they
[00:40:42] like take all the animals and the
[00:40:44] creatures and put them together and
[00:40:45] stuff. I don't know. Are you the one
[00:40:46] that they made that after? Are you the
[00:40:48] dude that made the human looking fish?
[00:40:50] That's what you are. You're the
[00:40:51] taxiderermis that does that stuff,
[00:40:52] right, Mystic? House of a Thousand
[00:40:54] Corpses. Yeah, you know what I'm talking
[00:40:56] about.
[00:40:57] Mystic's the dude that sits in the He's
[00:40:59] the He's the one that's in the uh the
[00:41:00] gas station going, "Look at my stuff
[00:41:02] that I
[00:41:05] make." Hey, it is actually a good movie.
[00:41:08] That is a good movie. It is a fun one. I
[00:41:09] have to admit that is a fun movie. All
[00:41:12] right, so Mystic, you go over there and
[00:41:14] you go, "All right, I'm done with this
[00:41:15] guy." And you go, "I'm going to go and
[00:41:16] talk to" And you both head over that
[00:41:18] vault. You go, "Sweet." The trilogy.
[00:41:21] Yes, I saw all of them. That was good.
[00:41:22] That was actually good. So, you head
[00:41:24] over there. You see all of those. you
[00:41:26] talk to this guy and uh because you
[00:41:28] saved him from that mystic, you actually
[00:41:30] get a faction boost. That means next
[00:41:32] time you go and deal with something
[00:41:34] Vault related, you instead of have a
[00:41:36] instead of just being a vault, you are
[00:41:38] now plus one on your encounters with
[00:41:40] your Vault, which means anytime
[00:41:43] somebody's trading or something happens,
[00:41:44] you get a little extra. Hey brother,
[00:41:47] well met, my friend. And you say, oh, we
[00:41:49] love these things. Got a faction boost.
[00:41:52] So now you get some more help whenever
[00:41:54] you choose them. and big BK coming in
[00:41:57] with a play booster. Thank you, Katsune.
[00:42:00] Hopefully you liked what you got there.

[00:42:02] you want to play the adventure game, you
[00:42:04] can always do that, too. Just let us

[00:51:01] engineering. Uh all right. So an

[00:51:13] You're scavening. You got your six or
[00:51:15] higher. You open that and
[00:51:20] inside you
[00:51:24] find a code disc. Well, look at that.

[00:52:34] one. That wasn't you. That was whiskey.
[00:52:37] And then you're going to go with the
[00:52:41] um you're also taking the mystery
[00:52:45] chip. All right. There you go, my
[00:52:49] friend. Yeah, you need to restock on

[00:54:26] pretty much get a shipping free for a
[00:54:29] couple packs of
[00:54:31] cards. You get into that damn vault. Oh,
[00:54:34] you're going to try to get to the vault
[00:54:35] today? It's a bit I don't know. It's not
[00:54:38] open. I don't know yet. You might be
[00:54:39] getting that direction, though. It's a
[00:54:41] hike. It's a bit of a hike. I mean,
[00:54:43] you're going you're going to a mountain,
[00:54:44] my
[00:54:46] friend. I mean, there's there's a
[00:54:48] mountain miles away. You just think
[00:54:50] you're going to all of a sudden like
[00:54:51] just poof be there. You like big big BK.
[00:54:53] I mean, you're you're a big strong man
[00:54:55] wearing armor. You're not like Silver
[00:54:57] Sneak who's fast and agile,
[00:55:02] right? Going to start the trek that way.
[00:55:05] All right. I like it. So, you you
[00:55:07] continue further in this wasteland. I
[00:55:10] like it. You continue further and uh
[00:55:41] All right, let's see. Now you're
[00:55:44] wandering further towards that place, my
[00:55:49] friend. And uh you got yourself when you
[00:55:52] wander further towards that
[00:55:55] place. Let's do this here. All righty.
[00:55:59] Restream. Hey, how's it going? I hope
[00:56:00] you draw some Oh, we do do get some good
[00:56:02] things. Thank you. Thank you, my friend.
[00:56:04] guy. I appreciate that,
[00:56:07] Matias. So,
[00:56:29] uh, all right. I didn't like that one.
[00:56:33] Let's see here. We have our image. We're
[00:56:36] going to make this one. This is going to
[00:56:36] be a better one. We're going to get
[00:56:38] something better here. I don't like that
[00:56:40] one. That one wasn't
[00:56:42] good. Big BK. I don't like how that
[00:56:45] showed. All right. Yeah, that's better.
[00:56:47] There we
[00:56:51] go. I like that one better.
[00:57:05] There we go. Ah, that's the one I'm
[00:57:06] going to use. I'm going use this one.
[00:57:09] So, you're wandering and you bump in and
[00:57:11] you see something in the distance. Now,
[00:57:12] do you go towards what you see, Big BK,
[00:57:15] or do you just kind of let it go? I
[00:57:16] mean, some people don't like to go
[00:57:17] towards those things. Some people like
[00:57:18] to uh just wander and keep going towards
[00:57:20] the distance in the end.
[00:57:30] Big BK goes, "No, I'm definitely going
[00:57:33] and checking out. I see something weird
[00:57:35] there. There's like maybe a building of
[00:57:36] some
[00:57:37] kind. I don't know. Some type of
[00:57:39] building in the
[00:57:49] distance." And you go
[00:57:51] over to that
[00:57:54] building. And well, look at that.
[00:57:58] You see as you get
[00:58:00] closer, there's a uh it looks like
[00:58:03] there's a ghoul of some kind
[00:58:05] there, but uh it's like a normal
[00:58:07] humanized one. They can talk and
[00:58:09] potentially and some robotic workers on
[00:58:11] the on maybe a farmer of some kind. Now,
[00:58:14] Big BK, you got yourself a tier where
[00:58:16] they are. So, you got to decide now. Do
[00:58:19] you said you're going to go talk to them
[00:58:21] and see what's going on with them over
[00:58:23] there and um see if they can help
[00:58:25] you now. Good luck.
[00:58:28] Big BK, now you got a custom upgrade
[00:58:30] with your uh with your pack here.
[00:58:34] So, Saran's
[00:58:36] resolve, agent of
[00:58:39] Kitus,
[00:58:41] Kotus. That was so wrong. Dragon Black

[00:58:57] Lost Lacid Prowler. I actually don't
[00:59:00] think I've ever seen that card pulled
[00:59:02] out
[00:59:03] yet. Interesting on the rare there.
[00:59:07] Reigning Victor in foil swamp and a
[00:59:10] warrior token.
[00:59:12] All right. So, Big, you wander over to
[00:59:16] talk to the uh the ghoul that's hanging
[00:59:20] out there. You go over to it and he's,
[00:59:24] "Hey, what are you doing over here?
[00:59:25] Don't see many people out this
[00:59:26] direction. They uh most people don't
[00:59:29] they stay by the cities. They don't
[00:59:30] really come out here on a regular
[00:59:32] basis. What can I help you with here?"
[00:59:35] Yeah, I mean, I got a small workshop in
[00:59:37] the back because I got to keep my bots
[00:59:39] running and
[00:59:41] um you know, like maybe there's
[00:59:43] something we can trade with. I don't get
[00:59:45] too many uh people out here in the
[00:59:48] distance in our wasteland areas
[00:59:51] here.
[00:59:53] So, are you going to be able to uh what
[00:59:56] do you want to do with them?
[01:00:04] No, I could any type of weapons and
[01:00:07] electronic parts. They help me rebuild
[01:00:08] the bots. The bots help protect me and
[01:00:11] they also help farm. So, any type of
[01:00:13] technology and weapons are always great
[01:00:15] for me. Uh, I don't really need anything
[01:00:17] else. I have a little bit of stuff that
[01:00:18] we grow here for food. I don't really
[01:00:20] need much food anymore, but uh it helps
[01:00:22] me to trade and stuff for those people
[01:00:24] that, you know, that need trading, but
[01:00:25] we grow food here, so we have some good
[01:00:27] amount of that.
[01:00:32] Maybe he can make you something. Oh. Oh,
[01:00:35] yes. Maybe. My friend.
[01:00:43] Well, I mean, uh Oh, those sounds
[01:00:45] something I could take. He says, "Ah,
[01:00:47] that would help me out a lot, actually.
[01:00:48] Um, you know, I can give you uh some
[01:00:52] food supplies and then um I I mean, I
[01:00:55] have information. And I've been around
[01:00:56] the wasteland for about 200 years here.
[01:00:59] Uh I could help you if you need to need
[01:01:01] to know where you're going. Like if I
[01:01:03] mean is there anything I there's some
[01:01:04] cities I can tell you how to get to the
[01:01:06] city. Uh there's a couple of them uh
[01:01:08] different areas that I can tell you how
[01:01:09] to get to uh if you'd like.
[01:01:12] Trading for information. Oh, he said,
[01:01:13] "Ah, wonderful." So yeah, what do you
[01:01:15] what do you want? What do you want for
[01:01:16] information?
[01:01:20] Got to find what you want for
[01:01:22] information, my friend.
[01:01:24] Are you
[01:01:25] going vault? Oh. Oh, you're talking
[01:01:28] about uh are you talking about the
[01:01:31] mountain?
[01:01:34] Wait, you talking about the mountain um
[01:01:36] that we have? I know. I remember the
[01:01:38] mountain. Yeah, that thing years ago.
[01:01:39] That mountain collapsed a bunch of that
[01:01:41] collapsed on the vault. I don't know if
[01:01:42] you're going to be getting to that
[01:01:43] anytime soon. Uh that had been out there
[01:01:46] right at the edge of the mountain at the
[01:01:47] bottom. collapsed and um no one's been
[01:01:51] there for I don't know couple couple
[01:01:53] hundred years but there's weird things
[01:01:54] over there weird creatures come out of
[01:01:56] that direction all the time I I've never
[01:01:58] been able to figure out why they're not
[01:02:00] like human they're they they come from
[01:02:01] they're not from Earth I don't know
[01:02:03] that's all I got to say it's weird
[01:02:06] so you know go oh big BK is looking at
[01:02:09] him and Big BK goes you know what I'm
[01:02:12] figuring out what's going on over
[01:02:14] there I will figure out what goes on
[01:02:16] over there you don't need to worry about
[01:02:17] anything. I got it handled. I I got
[01:02:20] enough to take care of
[01:02:22] myself. And the
[01:02:24] ghoul in the uh little farm there looks
[01:02:26] at you and goes, "You know what? I I
[01:02:28] think you can take care of yourself, but
[01:02:30] um the further you go, the tougher it's
[01:02:32] going to be. So, I recommend having a
[01:02:33] few friends with you at least." Cuz uh I
[01:02:36] I the only reason I escaped by there is
[01:02:38] cuz I can play dead and they don't even
[01:02:40] know I'm alive. And I laid down for a
[01:02:43] few days one time. So, some of those
[01:02:44] creatures just went by me. I just laid
[01:02:46] there for like 3 days in this in the gr
[01:02:48] ground with my face
[01:02:51] down. So, I don't know if you can do
[01:02:53] that without food and water. So, I might
[01:02:56] might have a little bit but yeah, I can
[01:02:58] tell you how to I can tell you the
[01:02:59] direction there. I mean, not a problem
[01:03:01] with that. Yeah. If you head head
[01:03:03] towards the mountain that you see and
[01:03:06] then on the bottom of the mountain,
[01:03:07] you're going to see uh a small right
[01:03:09] before you get to the mountain, there's
[01:03:10] going to be like a little cave-in there.
[01:03:12] All right. You want to go to where that
[01:03:14] caven is. And that point is where you'll
[01:03:17] uh you'll start seeing you'll maybe be
[01:03:18] able to dig your way into where the uh
[01:03:21] where the vault was
[01:03:24] there. Oh, take anything that heals. You
[01:03:27] know what? I actually uh
[01:03:29] luckily he goes, "You know what? If you
[01:03:31] go if you want to come with me, um
[01:03:33] actually come into the house
[01:03:35] here. I um I actually can heal. I've uh
[01:03:39] one of the things I've been known to do,
[01:03:40] I used to be a doctor when I was in the
[01:03:43] past. Nobody really needs the help from
[01:03:44] a ghoul anymore, though. People don't
[01:03:46] like ghouls doctoring them for some
[01:03:48] reason. I don't know. I guess they think
[01:03:49] it's I'm going to hurt
[01:03:51] them. Oh. H
[01:03:56] intriguing intriguing
[01:03:59] offer.
[01:04:01] H I don't know.
[01:04:21] No.
[01:04:22] No. Pogs. Offering percentage of the
[01:04:24] loot or pogs. Oh, not a bad one. I mean,
[01:04:28] he's like, I don't Stop talking, Mystic.
[01:04:32] Mystic, you're not involved in this.
[01:04:34] Stay out of this.
[01:04:41] All right. Well, he's uh he's making
[01:04:43] decisions here. All right.
[01:04:58] God damn it. You're screwing up my plan.
[01:05:01] Big BK says, "Stop ruining my plan.
[01:05:08] [Laughter]
[01:05:12] Let's see if you can get in there. Let's
[01:05:14] see if you can find them. Will work for
[01:05:17] Wena. Always let them try and set terms
[01:05:20] first. That's trap 10. Ah, I like it. He
[01:05:22] goes, you go, you know what? I think I
[01:05:24] can um I don't mind going with you. I
[01:05:27] think I think I can possibly do that. Um
[01:05:30] here, let's see. We're going to do um
[01:05:32] which one will
[01:05:35] uh the bottom one. This one? Yeah. All
[01:05:38] right. He looks at you and goes, "You
[01:05:40] know what? If you can give me
[01:05:43] um all the electronic parts that we come
[01:05:45] across, I think I can do that. I think
[01:05:48] I'll go with you." The ghoul
[01:05:54] says.
[01:05:56] So, we'll have to uh we'll have to add
[01:05:58] the ghoul over here.
[01:06:03] We'll do that. Hold on. We'll um
[01:06:13] Doctor, now I might be a little rusty
[01:06:16] with my medical skills cuz I I know
[01:06:18] nobody likes me working on them and it's
[01:06:19] been like a hundred years or so since I
[01:06:22] really helped
[01:06:23] anyone with anything. So, I just uh
[01:06:27] yeah, if you want some assistance on
[01:06:28] that, I can try. I just don't know if
[01:06:30] it's going to uh if I'm going to be it's
[01:06:33] going to help right away or if I'm going
[01:06:34] to have to learn some stuff again here,
[01:06:35] you know. Yeah, I've been around for a
[01:06:37] while, you
[01:06:44] know. Everything but the discs. Oh, you
[01:06:46] know what? I can do that for a deal. I
[01:06:49] don't I don't care about those discs.
[01:06:50] Those are something to get into
[01:06:51] different places and I don't go in in
[01:06:53] places. cuz I don't go rumaging around
[01:06:54] anywhere. So, you got the doctor,
[01:06:59] ghoul. I like it. Not a bad idea. He
[01:07:01] gets all those. Got a deal. All right.
[01:07:04] Ghoul doctor says, "Okay, but you know
[01:07:05] what? I don't fight. Just so you're
[01:07:07] aware. I kind of I I
[01:07:09] hide. So, I I don't really ever fight.
[01:07:12] I'm going to just uh kind of whenever
[01:07:14] anything goes on, just just expect me to
[01:07:16] disappear and pop back out later because
[01:07:18] I I'll run away and
[01:07:19] hide." Oh, okay. Cool. You're good with
[01:07:22] that? Ah,
[01:07:23] good. I've never been anything like a,
[01:07:25] you know, I'm a doctor. I'm I'm not a
[01:07:28] Nope. I'm a doctor. I'm not I'm not a
[01:07:29] fighter, as you can see. I mean, I got I
[01:07:31] got a I got gloves on for, you know,
[01:07:33] going and doing stuff. I I got I got I
[01:07:35] got a stethoscope. I don't do anything.
[01:07:37] I don't have any
[01:07:38] weapons. But yeah, the robots fight for
[01:07:40] me, but they got to stay here. They got
[01:07:42] to stay here and take care of the house
[01:07:44] cuz if they leave the house, the other
[01:07:46] ghouls and the other things in the area,
[01:07:48] they're going to come back and take
[01:07:49] over. So hopefully they can be gone for
[01:07:50] a little while. But yeah, they fight,
[01:07:51] but they're not leaving. They're not
[01:07:52] coming with us. They will take care of
[01:07:53] the house. But maybe I can uh
[01:07:56] set. No, no, we only have two of them. I
[01:07:59] got to leave them both here. We got to
[01:08:01] leave them both here. But hey, maybe I
[01:08:02] can find something along the way. And if
[01:08:04] we have some electronic parts or maybe
[01:08:05] there's something you have um that I can
[01:08:08] uh work on fixing because I, you know,
[01:08:09] I'm quite intelligent. I I rebuild. I
[01:08:11] built those robots from scratch myself.
[01:08:19] So, doctor, not a fighter. Ah, I like
[01:08:22] it.
[01:08:22] Doctor, do doctor, not a fighter. Jim.
[01:08:25] All right. So, you guys decided, let's
[01:08:27] do
[01:08:27] it. And you're going, "All right, let's
[01:08:30] head further into the
[01:08:33] wasteland."
[01:08:35] Now, one of the nice things is you get
[01:08:37] yourself a custom upgrade from the
[01:08:40] doctor right now cuz he can um do some
[01:08:42] stuff there. Now, Big
[01:08:44] BK, I'm going to let you know everyone
[01:08:46] all the things that you have here. You
[01:08:47] have the incendiary gatling, you have
[01:08:50] the pirate sword, you have the alien
[01:08:52] sniper, you have the regular sword, and
[01:08:54] you also have a broken rocket launcher
[01:08:56] and night vision
[01:08:59] goggles. So, you got to
[01:09:02] decide, does he want to uh do you want
[01:09:04] him to do a custom upgrade for you?
[01:09:05] Because you get that now before you get
[01:09:07] to go.
[01:09:18] and we'll run some more adventuring for
[01:09:20] those who like
[01:09:21] to. And Cat, Kayla, anybody hanging out
[01:09:24] here, we always appreciate you guys
[01:09:26] hanging out with us, watching, and
[01:09:27] they'll make sure if you jump in with
[01:09:30] anything, you um hang out and uh play
[01:09:33] some adventuring if you want. You can
[01:09:34] always do
[01:09:37] that. I don't know. Oh, I I mean, he's
[01:09:40] got the
[01:09:41] um I mean, you you got the broken rocket
[01:09:46] launcher. We can do armor again if you
[01:09:52] want. Oh, no worries. No
[01:09:59] worries. Oh, don't worry about it, bud.
[01:10:01] Don't worry about it. Hey, let me um
[01:10:03] That's fine. We can continue on a little
[01:10:04] bit here, but what? Let me know what you
[01:10:05] want to do. You can do your armor. You
[01:10:07] can do your uh
[01:10:09] your other stuff there if you'd like.
[01:10:14] Ah, the launcher is not a bad idea. All
[01:10:17] right. So, you talk to that ghoul and
[01:10:19] go, "Hey, you know, can you uh take go
[01:10:21] in the house and maybe fix this?" And
[01:10:24] you show him the rocket
[01:10:27] launcher from the
[01:10:30] um that you
[01:10:32] found and you couldn't killed the rocket
[01:10:34] robot. You chopped in half and you go,
[01:10:36] "Oh, you know what? I haven't seen one
[01:10:37] of those in a while." The ghoul says
[01:10:39] goes, "Give me a minute. I actually
[01:10:41] think I can handle that." He goes out
[01:10:44] back. Now, this is going to go with your
[01:10:46] salvage roll. Okay, now you have luck.
[01:10:50] So, it's going to be a nine or higher
[01:10:52] depending on what happens. Ah, you
[01:10:55] figured. Yep. It's a nine or higher or
[01:10:57] you want an 11 or lower? It's up to you.
[01:10:59] Generally, you go higher high. So,
[01:11:01] that's why I was
[01:11:02] saying, "All right, let's do it."
[01:11:06] Oh no, it's a
[01:11:09] six.
[01:11:11] Well, you give him
[01:11:15] that. But the rocket
[01:11:21] launcher is not necessarily upgraded. He
[01:11:24] goes, he goes, "Uh, hey, I'm sorry,
[01:11:26] buddy. I I was not able to upgrade it
[01:11:29] with the uh the the extra mystery chip
[01:11:31] you had given me." Wait a minute. I
[01:11:33] don't remember giving you a mystery
[01:11:34] chip. Yeah, you gave me the mystery chip
[01:11:35] with the rocket launcher. I was not able
[01:11:39] to do that, but I was able to use some
[01:11:40] of the parts from the mystery
[01:11:43] chip. The engineering only house when
[01:11:46] you're building. He's building it for
[01:11:47] you. Remember? Ah.
[01:12:04] Yeah, you were having him build it. But
[01:12:07] hey, ready? He's going to uh he makes it
[01:12:10] for you. He goes, "You know, I was not
[01:12:12] able to do that, but you know, I was
[01:12:13] luckily able to uh get that rocket
[01:12:15] launcher back together for you." And
[01:12:25] um this one's a little too big. Hold on.
[01:12:28] I didn't make it able to be carried.
[01:12:31] And you're going to get this uh rocket
[01:12:33] launcher here. Sure. You can carry it
[01:12:34] around the wasteland now for yourself.
[01:12:37] Now you have a bunch of weapons. You
[01:12:39] have some sweet weapons. You've been in
[01:12:40] here hanging out getting all those
[01:12:42] things together there.
[01:12:49] What?
[01:13:04] I didn't realize that was there playing.
[01:13:05] I'm sitting there like listening to
[01:13:06] music like, "Oh, it's Jack Black."
[01:13:08] You've been doing a lot. I know you've
[01:13:10] been doing a lot. You've definitely been
[01:13:12] doing a lot. We're doing a lot of
[01:13:13] adventuring with you, my friend.
[01:13:26] Why is it doing this? I don't like it.
[01:13:30] We have to try one
[01:13:34] more. And I'm taking I'm going to pick
[01:13:36] one out of them anyways, no matter
[01:13:42] what. There you go.
[01:13:53] We're going to go with
[01:14:01] this one
[01:14:02] here. That's the one. We'll go with
[01:14:05] There we
[01:14:06] [Music]
[01:14:10] go. All
[01:14:23] right, let's get that. That's the one
[01:14:25] we'll use for now. And I'll see if I can
[01:14:26] make a better one later, but I want to
[01:14:29] use this is the one we'll use. You get
[01:14:31] yourself a rocket launcher. Now, your
[01:14:34] ghoul friend goes Oh. comes uh goes in
[01:14:36] his room, comes out back, comes back out
[01:14:39] with
[01:14:50] uh comes back out and hands you.
[01:14:55] Really? It's going to take that long,
[01:14:57] huh?
[01:14:59] Gonna take long? Good morning, my
[01:15:01] friend. Mr. Fong, hopefully you're
[01:15:03] having a good morning. We're uh Why is
[01:15:06] that one taking so long? That is weird.
[01:15:08] All right, there we
[01:15:10] go. Here is your uh your ghoul doctor
[01:15:13] comes back and he goes, I wasn't able to
[01:15:15] uh make that giant one that he had, but
[01:15:18] I was able to take some of the parts
[01:15:22] um along with some of the uh with along
[01:15:24] with the mystery chip that you provided
[01:15:25] me and uh make this for you with the
[01:15:28] it's it'll shoot one rocket at a time.
[01:15:30] You'll have to you'll have to load them
[01:15:32] individually, but you can shoot one at a
[01:15:35] time now. And it will uh it'll launch
[01:15:38] one rocket at a time out. So, you now
[01:15:42] have a rocket launcher, my friend Big
[01:15:44] BK. It's a little miniature
[01:15:47] one, but it is a start for the launching
[01:15:50] of
[01:15:54] rockets. So, it's an individual
[01:15:57] loader. Good morning. So, there's your
[01:16:00] rocket launcher you got there, Big BK.
[01:16:03] And you got your buddy Dr. Ghoul. I
[01:16:06] know. Started with a pistol. Now you've
[01:16:08] got um you've got a rocket launcher,
[01:16:11] your incendiary dragon gatling
[01:16:14] gun. You have the pirate sword, the
[01:16:19] enhanced pirate
[01:16:21] sword. You have an alien sniper
[01:16:24] rifle. And I do believe you have a uh a
[01:16:27] flamethrower, too, potentially. No, the
[01:16:28] flamethrower was given off. I
[01:16:32] think Drake
[01:16:35] voice. We started with a pistol. Now
[01:16:37] we're
[01:16:38] [Laughter]
[01:16:40] here. Yes, the that was blown up. That
[01:16:42] was blown up when you tried to do
[01:16:43] something. I remember that now. You were
[01:16:45] trying to upgrade it and it got blown up
[01:16:47] in your upgrade machine. Yes, I do
[01:16:49] remember. You were doing something a
[01:16:50] little too early. You trying to be like,
[01:16:51] "Oh, I can take over and upgrade. We'll
[01:16:54] do this." Yes, that was a critical
[01:16:56] failure. I remember that now. Hey, at
[01:16:58] least get a rocket launcher instead.
[01:17:00] That's pretty good instead of a nap. But
[01:17:02] only problem is you have no rockets. You
[01:17:04] made a rocket launcher, but you got no
[01:17:18] rockets. So, you're going to have to you
[01:17:20] have to find some of those around. Ah,
[01:17:23] yes.
[01:17:25] Now, if anybody else, we have a bunch of
[01:17:27] other people hanging out here. If you
[01:17:28] all want to come in play, we'll uh
[01:17:29] continue on adventuring with our buddy
[01:17:32] here, but I have to uh do this now.
[01:17:46] So, there you go. Let's do that. Now,
[01:17:49] you go. Uh we will get there. You'll get
[01:17:51] there. Yes, you will get there because
[01:17:53] you uh you have um you're at your
[01:17:55] building. Your Dr. Ghoul's there. You
[01:17:57] have him coming along on the way. You
[01:17:58] now have a friend to wander with you.
[01:18:02] Big BK. We like it. Friends, we love
[01:18:05] friends. Friends are
[01:18:11] fun. So, as you wander, my
[01:18:15] friend, let's go. You get a little
[01:18:19] closer.
[01:18:28] All right, I have generate
[01:18:46] that. All right, there we go. We're
[01:18:49] going to go with Why is this going so
[01:18:52] slow?
[01:18:54] We're going to go with
[01:19:23] There we go. That's
[01:19:30] good. All right. You're wandering
[01:19:33] further through the wasteland here with
[01:19:35] your buddy. All right. Wandering further
[01:19:37] with your way with through your through
[01:19:38] the wasteland with your buddy. Here we
[01:19:40] have a bunch of stuff here. If you guys
[01:19:42] like to do do jump in, there's a bunch
[01:19:44] of things in the buy now. some play
[01:19:46] boosters and things like that. So, we
[01:19:48] have some good times with you all
[01:19:49] hanging out. So, doing some pack breaks,
[01:19:51] doing some adventuring, and now this is
[01:19:53] what happens. You go
[01:19:56] wandering through
[01:20:02] there
[01:20:04] and all of a sudden you wander and you
[01:20:06] see something in the distance and Dart
[01:20:08] Ghoul goes, "Oh,
[01:20:09] yo, let's go investigate over there."
[01:20:12] You're like, "What? Over there? Where?"
[01:20:14] and he points in the
[01:20:16] distance and you see what looks like
[01:20:19] maybe a small uh warehouse that has a
[01:20:22] factory in the background somewhere. H
[01:20:25] what is that? You start to wander
[01:20:27] towards it a little more and then you
[01:20:30] get closer to it, you
[01:20:40] notice there's a bunch of these hanging
[01:20:42] out there in front. They're not really
[01:20:44] working. They're just kind of there.
[01:20:46] Looks like they may be broken
[01:20:49] partially, but you find a warehouse over
[01:20:54] here that is housing some uh some
[01:20:58] robotic things and robots there for you
[01:21:01] guys.
[01:21:02] Now, you need to
[01:21:06] uh
[01:21:08] decide what are you going to be doing,
[01:21:10] my friend. Okay. Are you going to
[01:21:12] investigate this robotic
[01:21:15] warehouse or are we going to uh let it
[01:21:18] go? Let's go. Side quest. Oh, yes. Side
[01:21:21] quest.
[01:21:23] So, the robotic warehouse go over there.
[01:21:26] All those robots are pretty much they're
[01:21:28] not they're not working. They aren't
[01:21:30] working at all. The um the Dr. Gulo,
[01:21:34] he's looking at him. He goes running
[01:21:35] over, starts looking at a couple of
[01:21:36] them. Oh, I could easily get these
[01:21:37] running. Nice. Um, we need like four or
[01:21:41] five mystery chips and then if we can
[01:21:45] get maybe um some more of the robotic
[01:21:47] arm parts, we might be able to get these
[01:21:49] up and
[01:21:51] going. Yes, he might not be he might be
[01:21:54] able to fix them. He's he's he's poking
[01:21:56] around those
[01:21:57] bots going. Oh, nice. Look at this one.
[01:22:00] This one's over here. Oh, nice. I like
[01:22:02] how that looks.
[01:22:05] So, you go wandering to look further
[01:22:07] into the warehouse,
[01:22:10] looking around. Now, you're looking in
[01:22:12] different rooms. You're not really
[01:22:13] seeing anything while you're there. But
[01:22:15] the um the doctor, he stays outside
[01:22:18] looking at the other robots. He goes,
[01:22:20] "Oh, whoa. I can take this one apart. I
[01:22:22] think I can use his parts to make
[01:22:27] one of these robots that are working."
[01:22:32] Hm. Should we cannibalize and make one
[01:22:35] working one? I think we should do
[01:22:38] that. And that ghoul doctor starts just
[01:22:41] wandering away, not even paying
[01:22:43] attention to you. He's just in in
[01:22:45] intelligent making mode, not even caring
[01:22:48] that there's anyone else around. And the
[01:22:50] ghoul doctor goes, "Oh
[01:22:52] my." Well, let's see what he has here.
[01:22:55] Now, the ghoul doctor puts together
[01:23:01] couple these. Oh, almost. I think I got
[01:23:03] it.
[01:23:28] All righty. So, he builds something
[01:23:31] together. It takes a little bit of time
[01:23:33] when he's going and he's building that
[01:23:35] Dr. Ghoul like, "Oh, I got it. I got
[01:23:37] it." Oh, one over here. One over here.
[01:23:39] Goes run back over. Goes finds a goes
[01:23:42] over to one of the other robots. He was
[01:23:43] like, "Ah, nice. Nice. A leg working
[01:23:45] leg. Luring leg. Wonderful. Wonderful."
[01:23:46] He's just like some crazy dude running
[01:23:48] back and forth. I don't really even
[01:23:50] understand what's going on.
[01:23:52] What the is going on here? Anybody else
[01:23:54] like to you can jump in and hang out
[01:23:55] with
[01:23:56] us. And what happens was he
[01:24:01] finally gets something together. He
[01:24:04] goes, "Oh, nice. Sweet.
[01:24:07] Wonderful. We I think this guy Hold on.
[01:24:10] Let's get him a charge." He goes
[01:24:12] wandering around. He goes, "All right, I
[01:24:14] got this guy together. He's got a slight
[01:24:16] charge, but we're going to have to find
[01:24:18] some more um energy cells.
[01:24:21] All
[01:24:27] right. Because um this guy's going to
[01:24:30] run out of energy soon. I was only able
[01:24:32] to give him a quick
[01:24:35] charge.
[01:24:37] So, we're going to do this
[01:24:39] here. Was only able to give him a quick
[01:24:46] charge. All
[01:24:55] right.
[01:24:59] Now, so you're going to have to find
[01:25:01] some energy cells while you're wandering
[01:25:03] cuz this guy won't last
[01:25:04] long. All right. Here you go. This is
[01:25:07] your uh robotic friend that was made. It
[01:25:11] looks like he can carry some weapons and
[01:25:12] potentially shoot. And he has uh he's
[01:25:15] able to carry some of your extra items
[01:25:18] for you so you don't have to worry about
[01:25:20] running out of inventory space.
[01:25:23] Well, well, well, well. Look at that, my
[01:25:27] friend. Now, Dr. Ghoul goes, "Nice. I
[01:25:30] got him made." I'm getting He gives him
[01:25:32] his his stuff. The robot
[01:25:35] helper. Give me a sniper and your ammo.
[01:25:37] Oo, I like it. And you go, "Hey, bot. I
[01:25:41] have
[01:25:41] um I have a uh an alien sniper rifle
[01:25:47] here. You think you could shoot with
[01:25:49] that? He looks at the bot looks at
[01:25:52] it and it doesn't even say anything.
[01:25:55] Just you can see it scan a little bit.
[01:25:58] It beeps once and takes it. Ah. Dr.
[01:26:02] Google goes, "Ah, dang it. Looks like I
[01:26:04] have to work on the voice." All right.
[01:26:06] Well, we'll get to that with some of the
[01:26:07] other Maybe we'll find some other parts
[01:26:08] I can help build that with. uh upgrade
[01:26:10] that with and get the going. But we
[01:26:11] can't hear it
[01:26:14] yet. One for yes, two for no. Yeah,
[01:26:17] there you go. One for yes. Beep.
[01:26:18] Exactly. You got He beeped and he takes
[01:26:20] it. So now we going to go
[01:26:24] uh with a handy helper. You have a handy
[01:26:28] helper of
[01:26:31] um the robot
[01:26:36] friend. and they have uh the sniper
[01:26:42] rifle. And we're going to do that. I'm
[01:26:44] going to get rid of your alien sniper
[01:26:52] rifle. Nice. Building some friends up
[01:26:57] there. It's coming together. It's all
[01:27:00] coming together. They said eventually
[01:27:04] you shall see what happens now. Oh, your
[01:27:07] alien sniper rifle has uh has come into
[01:27:10] play now. He's like, "Oh, sweet. Your uh
[01:27:13] robotic helper picks it up, looks at it,
[01:27:16] looks down the scope a little bit, nods
[01:27:19] his head, goes beeps
[01:27:21] again. Oh, you're going to build your
[01:27:23] own faction eventually. You You're not
[01:27:24] going to be part of the the pirate
[01:27:25] faction. You're going to build your
[01:27:26] own." Ah, I like it. I like it. Now,

[01:28:50] helper. Dr. Ghoul says, "Hey, I'm going
[01:28:52] to continue wandering around the uh the
[01:28:54] robot warehouse here for a minute. I
[01:28:56] want to see if I can find anything else.
[01:28:58] Um, if you want, not a bad idea. There's
[01:29:01] the there there's the actual plant in
[01:29:03] the in the distance. Do we want to go to
[01:29:04] the the plant or uh or not?
[01:29:20] That's the one I'm going to use. I like
[01:29:22] that.
[01:29:49] Go to the plant. All right. Well, your
[01:29:51] buddy robot is uh he's looking at the
[01:29:54] robot warehouse. The robot is kind of
[01:29:56] staring around. Oh, not that
[01:29:59] guy. The robot helper is kind of staring
[01:30:01] around like, "What's going on here?" H
[01:30:04] interesting. He beefs one more time.
[01:30:08] Ghoul Doctor goes wandering off like
[01:30:10] running away. What the You're supposed
[01:30:12] to be here with help of me. And the
[01:30:14] robot goes
[01:31:00] I don't like
[01:31:05] that. Here you go.
[01:31:16] Let's try that. I didn't put
[01:31:18] manufacturing instead of plant. So, it
[01:31:19] made me a robot making a
[01:31:22] plant. Come with me, robot. Like,
[01:31:25] seriously? Like, I guess that's I guess
[01:31:28] he's now this is the I guess he's a
[01:31:31] farmer. All right. So, you head that
[01:31:34] way. You go into the plant there.
[01:31:42] And you see a bunch of
[01:31:44] uh bunch more robots. Now, it looks like
[01:31:47] they're all in partial building stages.
[01:31:49] They're not they're not made really. You
[01:31:52] can't really scavenge them and put them
[01:31:53] together. There's too much missing from
[01:31:55] all these.
[01:31:57] But maybe you can find some parts for
[01:32:01] some other things. Ah, the mystery chip.
[01:32:03] I see. Look for the mystery chip.
[01:32:06] All right. So, you're going to go uh
[01:32:08] let's
[01:32:14] go. So, you go wander
[01:32:17] in to that robot
[01:32:21] plant. Now, it doesn't really have any
[01:32:23] working robots. The
[01:32:26] uh your doctor friend goes wandering
[01:32:28] through there and like, "Hey, sweet."
[01:32:30] Goes running up to each one of them.
[01:32:32] Nice. Your robot buddy goes and looks at
[01:32:34] him like uh can't see you. Your robot
[01:32:38] buddy goes and looks like ah
[01:32:39] interesting. I was looking at those and
[01:32:42] just kind of beeping a little bit,
[01:32:44] poking at some of them. None of them are
[01:32:46] moving. It's like he's recognizing but
[01:32:48] not understanding. Dr. Ghoul again goes
[01:32:51] running
[01:32:53] off. And uh I like it. So here, Big B,
[01:32:57] we're going to have to do a roll. All
[01:33:00] right, your luck roll. Do you have it
[01:33:02] going to be high, right? You always do
[01:33:04] high. So, you have to have a nine or
[01:33:06] higher. Big
[01:33:08] BK, I guess you you don't have any luck
[01:33:11] right now with this. I'm
[01:33:16] sorry. I'm sorry. You go wandering and
[01:33:19] you know what happens is uh you do
[01:33:25] um
[01:33:28] see some energy
[01:33:33] cells but the energy cell that you find
[01:33:37] is
[01:33:38] uh not
[01:33:41] full. All
[01:33:44] right. It's not on a full charge. See
[01:33:47] how it's yellow there? You want that to
[01:33:49] be green when you pick him up. It's not
[01:33:52] on a full charge right now. Ah, you know
[01:33:54] what? We might tell. So, you're you got
[01:33:56] it going there. You might not find any
[01:33:58] of them on a full charge cuz I mean it's
[01:34:00] a wast wasteland for your
[01:34:03] roll. So, you found one. It's partially
[01:34:06] charged. Partially charged.
[01:34:10] All right, let me do this.
[01:34:21] All righty. Find the energy cell.
[01:34:26] Get to decide what you're going to do.
[01:34:27] Anybody else would like to play? Jump in
[01:34:29] and hang out with us. Let me know.
[01:34:31] Ready? Having some fun in our way
[01:34:33] adventuring here as we're doing our
[01:34:35] adventures wandering through. All
[01:34:38] righty, our friend. Now, if you want to
[01:34:40] remember, pick up. Anybody can jump in
[01:34:42] themselves and take on uh keep going
[01:34:44] here. So you find partially enter energy
[01:34:47] cell. You what are you going to do? You
[01:34:48] going to give that to I mean your robot
[01:34:50] needs it. Keep looking. I like it. So
[01:34:52] you keep wandering around that robotic
[01:34:55] plant trying to see what's going
[01:34:58] on. Charge your cell. Ooh, that's not a
[01:35:00] bad idea. Keep looking
[01:35:03] around and
[01:35:14] uh All right. I like it. You try to find
[01:35:18] a place to charge the
[01:35:22] cell. All right. So, you pick the cell
[01:35:24] up, put it in your pocket with all your
[01:35:27] other stuff.
[01:35:34] All right, pick that up. And then you're
[01:35:37] wandering around and all of a sudden you
[01:35:38] see this weird looking thing in the back
[01:35:41] like, "Huh, what is
[01:35:44] this?" Now, uh, ghoul doctor looks at it
[01:35:46] and goes, "Oh, that's the energy cells
[01:35:49] charging locations. Those don't really
[01:35:50] generally work that much." Um, we're
[01:35:51] going to have to find a way to get that
[01:35:53] to run. Those normally need one of the
[01:35:56] nuclear uh one of the nuclear cells to
[01:35:58] get those to run itself. But every now
[01:36:00] and again one of the nuclear things are
[01:36:01] are uh are there and they work right,
[01:36:03] you know. But
[01:36:05] hey, maybe we can find one of those in
[01:36:08] the few in uh one of those nuclear cells
[01:36:09] that we can go and charge whenever you
[01:36:11] want in a way uh because it lasts a good
[01:36:13] amount of
[01:36:20] charges. All right. So, you have uh your
[01:36:23] location here that you see down on the
[01:36:28] wall because yes, that is the uh that's
[01:36:30] where we charge the energy cells for the
[01:36:32] robots. I um generally Yeah, I have a
[01:36:35] mine are full there for my other guys.
[01:36:36] They last a while. But uh if you'd like,
[01:36:40] you can go try to check if it'll work.
[01:36:42] Um let me go and play Laram with it for
[01:36:44] a minute. Doctor, intelligent guy ghoul
[01:36:46] goes
[01:36:47] over poking around at the energy cell
[01:36:51] charging
[01:36:55] location and um he's like, "You know
[01:36:58] what? It might
[01:36:59] have enough charge in there to top off
[01:37:03] your uh the cell that you you said you
[01:37:05] said you found your own cell, right?
[01:37:07] Might have enough to top off that cell
[01:37:08] you
[01:37:09] found."
[01:37:11] So, I'm going to try I'm going to try
[01:37:13] it. All right, we're going to try it.
[01:37:14] We're going to put that in there. You
[01:37:15] put the energy cell
[01:37:17] in
[01:37:19] and all right. Well, you hear uh you
[01:37:23] hear
[01:37:24] worring, then a couple of
[01:37:27] beeps. Your robot looks over and like
[01:37:30] beep right back at it. Then it beeps a
[01:37:34] couple more times. This the machine
[01:37:36] robot looks at it again, beeps a couple
[01:37:38] more times. But this is not twice. This
[01:37:39] is like two or three times.
[01:37:42] Then the energy cell charging station
[01:37:44] again beeps, but this time it's just
[01:37:47] like a long obnoxious beep continuously
[01:37:50] going. Your ears start ringing big BK.
[01:37:53] But oh,
[01:37:56] pops. An energy cell that is fully
[01:37:59] charged now.
[01:38:02] But that Dr. Ghoul goes, "Oh crap."
[01:38:05] turns and
[01:38:08] runs. That uh charging
[01:38:11] station poofs, it's gone. Puffs up in
[01:38:15] smoke. He looks over at it. The robot
[01:38:19] looks over at it and it's like beep
[01:38:22] beep. Lets it go. And the dude ghoul
[01:38:24] goes, "Well, I told you it might work.
[01:38:27] You took the chance, but luckily you got
[01:38:28] the cell out of
[01:38:29] it. Grab the cell before it blows." All
[01:38:32] right, you grab that cell. You take it.
[01:38:33] Put it back in your pocket. Now, the one
[01:38:36] for the robot is almost dead. So, he's
[01:38:38] going to need an energy cell soon. So,
[01:38:40] you're going to have to decide, are you
[01:38:41] going to give him the energy
[01:38:43] cell that you came across that now you
[01:38:46] have fully charged, or are you going to
[01:38:48] uh keep that for yourself? Yeah. Switch
[01:38:50] it out. All right. You switch out the
[01:38:52] energy cell. You give him the energy
[01:38:53] cell.
[01:38:55] your uh robot buddy beeps a couple more
[01:38:57] times. Goes and you hear kind of almost
[01:38:59] power up a little
[01:39:00] extra and then you hear it say one thing
[01:39:04] going, "Hey, thanks for the
[01:39:10] energy." Ghoul Doctor looks and goes,
[01:39:13] "Oh, I forgot voice processing is a high
[01:39:18] power item." All right. All right. Cool.
[01:39:21] Cool. Roboc. Yes. Yes. Yes. Nice. Nice.
[01:39:24] Thank you, sir. Thank you, gentlemen.
[01:39:26] We're going to uh help you. Uh I can
[01:39:28] help you. I can carry your stuff. Uh I
[01:39:30] can shoot a little bit. The sniper rifle
[01:39:32] is not bad. I'll have to take some
[01:39:33] practice with that. I haven't used one
[01:39:34] of those in
[01:39:36] years. Ghoul looks at me like years.
[01:39:38] What do you mean? He's like, "Oh, yes.
[01:39:40] You combine me with a couple of uh the
[01:39:41] robots. My intelligence comes from one.
[01:39:42] My body parts come from another." And
[01:39:44] hey, we're working together here. We're
[01:39:46] fine. Hey, Booper. How's it going, my
[01:39:49] friend? Hopefully you're having a good
[01:39:51] one.
[01:39:53] So, you have your handy helperbot is now
[01:39:56] at full
[01:39:57] charge. You
[01:39:59] have an energy cell that is pretty much
[01:40:03] depleted. It's not really going to do
[01:40:04] anything. You are lucky it was even
[01:40:06] working. Yeah, I know. It's all coming
[01:40:09] together now, my friends. All coming
[01:40:12] together now as you wander further. Now,
[01:40:16] where the problem is the the uh your
[01:40:19] mountain that you're going to, you look
[01:40:22] further in the distance, you step out of
[01:40:24] the warehouse, you go, "Fuck, that
[01:40:25] mountain is so far away. This is going
[01:40:28] to be a pain in the ass to get over
[01:40:31] there." But remember, you guys, you need
[01:40:34] to check out the YouTube shorts that we
[01:40:35] have that'll explain what's going on
[01:40:36] with the mountain a bit and why it's so
[01:40:39] far away and and broken
[01:40:42] up. It's honesty super close. It is.
[01:40:45] It's a lot closer than you think. It
[01:40:47] definitely is close. Definitely is
[01:40:49] close.
[01:40:59] All right, my friend. Now, we have a few
[01:41:02] others hanging out with us. Now, if you
[01:41:04] want to jump in hanging out. You boopers
[01:41:06] scavenging now. I know. Boop. You You
[01:41:09] left some of those places. You're
[01:41:10] scavenging around cuz you had
[01:41:13] been over here hanging out. You
[01:41:18] left. Objects in the mirror appear
[01:41:21] closer than they seem. There's a bunch
[01:41:22] of foam on the thing. What? There's a
[01:41:24] bunch of foam on the side of the thing.
[01:41:26] Yeah, it's just from the water. That's
[01:41:28] all. So cool.
[01:41:31] Oh, they appear closer than they seem.
[01:41:33] No one's going to join our friend. We
[01:41:34] have a You do have a ghoul doctor and a
[01:41:36] handy helper bot. I mean, he can snipe
[01:41:38] from the background and carry your
[01:41:40] stuff. Uh, is is Mystic Mystic's kind of
[01:41:43] in is Mystic in the background smoking a
[01:41:45] cigarette
[01:41:47] like these guys are stupid. I'm going to
[01:41:50] let them take over. I'm going to wander
[01:41:52] in at the end and uh clean up
[01:41:57] shop. Mystics
[01:42:01] there. Boop. You did
[01:42:04] have some uh
[01:42:07] some rad. Did you get rads? You
[01:42:13] saying keep
[01:42:17] pushing? Got the rad
[01:42:20] or I'm not I'm not following.
[01:42:26] Boop. Hold on. Let me do this.
[01:42:37] There's our buddy. Uh, where's Boop? I
[01:42:39] thought I had him in here.
[01:42:42] I know what. Give me a second. I thought
[01:42:43] I had him here. There it is.
[01:42:46] Boop. There you are, Boop. Boop's
[01:42:48] hanging out, wandering around, too. The
[01:42:50] um the purple owl owl thing.
[01:42:57] Let's keep pushing. Oh, you going to
[01:42:58] ride the doctor?
[01:43:00] going to ride the doctor. All right.
[01:43:02] Well, uh doctor looks at you like,
[01:43:03] "Dude, get off my back.
[01:43:06] I I don't like touching me."
[01:43:11] And Yeah. Yeah. So, um yeah, you you
[01:43:16] just go you stay in the background there
[01:43:19] and you just kind of he's the guy who
[01:43:22] just sit there smoking your cigarette
[01:43:23] like, "All right, well, fine. I'll
[01:43:24] follow you guys."
[01:43:28] Yes, the rad scanner.
[01:43:30] Yes, correct. You did. That's correct.
[01:43:34] You did get that. I'm sorry. I I didn't
[01:43:35] know what you're talking about. I'm
[01:43:36] confus I was confused on what you're
[01:43:37] getting at. Yes, you do
[01:43:40] have the uh the scanner you found. Now,
[01:43:43] this buddy here, you found one of
[01:43:50] these. Where'd it go?
[01:43:56] You got the pocket radiation scanner.
[01:43:59] That is correct. Boop. I have that in
[01:44:00] there for you. I do have that as uh what
[01:44:04] you have. You have the pocket radiation
[01:44:11] scanner.
[01:44:13] Now, that will help you see radiation in
[01:44:16] locations while you're
[01:44:19] traveling. Okay. Now we see the
[01:44:23] difference as we
[01:44:26] go.
[01:44:28] Robot says, "Hey, well
[01:44:31] uh what are we doing here? I I saw some
[01:44:34] of the robots around where we're uh we
[01:44:36] hanging out here." Robot goes like, Dr.
[01:44:38] Ghoul's like, "No, no, no. I think we're
[01:44:40] on our way, right?" And we got some
[01:44:43] stuff. No, I don't want to play with
[01:44:44] those roaches again. Those roaches are
[01:44:47] not fun.
[01:44:49] So, you guys are going to continue
[01:44:50] forward or do you want to investigate
[01:44:53] the area
[01:44:55] further? Let's see. Move forward or
[01:45:01] investigate. Go towards the mountain.
[01:45:38] All right. You scavenging at the cave?
[01:45:41] Yes. All right. So, you go. Go back over
[01:45:44] to where the cave was to scavenge back
[01:45:46] around. I like it. So, you hit that
[01:45:53] cave. I'm go back in there. Where'd I
[01:45:55] put that? You see the that cave there
[01:45:57] where you had the dragon and the hydra
[01:45:58] there before. You can hang out with the
[01:46:01] doctor for protection. I like it. You
[01:46:03] know, he doesn't shoot anything,
[01:46:06] right? Butter him up for a future
[01:46:08] upgrade. I like it. Gonna protect him in
[01:46:11] the background. Ah, I get
[01:46:16] it.
[01:46:18] Now, as you're
[01:46:20] wandering, you see something in the
[01:46:22] distance and
[01:46:24] um, oh, look, it's a uh it's
[01:46:30] another what looks like a refugee camp,
[01:46:34] maybe. So, you guys start wandering
[01:46:36] towards what you think is a refugee
[01:46:39] camp. like, "Wow, I haven't seen one of
[01:46:41] those around for a little while." And
[01:46:44] then, oh no, you got closer and
[01:46:53] uh No, that's not the type of camp you
[01:46:58] thought it
[01:47:01] was. It is
[01:47:04] a mutated raider camp.
[01:47:08] So you got you have to
[01:47:11] decide what are you going to do
[01:47:15] here. Anyway, I started
[01:47:20] blasting. I like it. So the mutator
[01:47:22] raider camp, you started blasting. Now
[01:47:23] there's four of them there. They're all
[01:47:25] got like 20 to 30 health. All right. Now
[01:47:29] you start blasting. What are you going
[01:47:31] to blast with? Your uh your your other
[01:47:34] weapon there. Your your gun.
[01:47:40] And you got a Oh, there we go.
[01:47:45] There is four. And there will be none.
[01:47:47] You got 10. 15. Well, look at that. You
[01:47:50] hit one of them for 15. Now, your robot
[01:47:54] buddy in the background, he's got the
[01:47:55] sniper
[01:47:57] rifle. All right.
[01:48:00] And
[01:48:04] they
[01:48:06] roll this. Let's
[01:48:13] see. The alien sniper rifle hits
[01:48:17] with
[01:48:19] 12 15 again. So, we're going to kill one
[01:48:22] of them off. Oh, yes. You have your
[01:48:24] sword you can use, too.
[01:48:28] So, you're going to use your sword. All
[01:48:30] right. You're going to use the
[01:48:33] sword. You hit with a sword for eight,
[01:48:37] 10, 13. So, you have uh pretty much you
[01:48:40] can kill one off and knock one down.
[01:48:42] Almost half
[01:48:45] health. Those uh mutants in the raider
[01:48:48] camp
[01:48:51] there, you cannot stab them with the
[01:48:55] dual wiens. They uh they were not used
[01:48:57] that way, but you can try to um you can
[01:49:01] try to uh use it to shoot them with your
[01:49:05] uh with your weapon
[01:49:10] there. Pew pew. All right, you're going
[01:49:12] to shoot now yours. Let's see what the
[01:49:15] mystic head. What did yours go
[01:49:19] to? All right, so that is
[01:49:23] a plus seven.
[01:49:27] with four
[01:49:30] d6s and a one and four to one and four
[01:49:35] uh for catching it on fire. So that's
[01:49:41] four D6s. That's this one
[01:49:49] here. That's this one
[01:49:53] here. All right. Well, luckily they're
[01:49:56] only uh they're not that high. They're
[01:49:59] only I was going to put them at uh 13
[01:50:02] for their uh damage there, but you beat
[01:50:04] them by hitting your by having your
[01:50:05] seven on top of that for your weapon.
[01:50:08] And you hit with the one. You say one
[01:50:11] was your uh your l your number to hit
[01:50:13] with, right? Or was it
[01:50:15] four? You hit with one, catch one on
[01:50:18] fire, and look at that. One poofs up in
[01:50:21] flames. So, you now have two of the four
[01:50:24] are dead. Dr. Ghoul goes, "Ah, shit."
[01:50:27] Turns around,
[01:50:28] runs. You're like, "Seriously, dude.
[01:50:31] We're killing
[01:50:33] them now. They attack you
[01:50:38] guys to see what
[01:50:40] happens." Oh, you're lucky. They
[01:50:43] miss. Ah, Lil J. I like that. Look, a
[01:50:46] pearl medallion for you. We got a lot of
[01:50:48] singles in there, so make sure you do
[01:50:49] check them out. over a thousand singles
[01:50:52] that are in
[01:50:53] there. All right, so you uh they attack
[01:50:57] and you're lucky they missed you
[01:51:00] both. Those uh mutant
[01:51:03] raiders, two of them are dead. You're
[01:51:06] down to
[01:51:07] one. Shooting
[01:51:13] again. And you
[01:51:18] missed.
[01:51:21] No incendiary guy gives an eight plus
[01:51:33] eight. Oh, actually 11 because you have
[01:51:36] two
[01:51:38] intelligence. 11 because you have two
[01:51:41] intelligence and uh engineering. I
[01:51:44] forgot you had intelligence and
[01:51:45] engineering. So you're at 11.
[01:51:50] Oh, you're at plus 12. What' I
[01:51:53] miss? So plus 12. He hits at even with
[01:51:56] the 11, you hit it anyways. You hit him
[01:51:58] for 5,
[01:52:01] 12, 15, 20 damage. Oh, well, look at
[01:52:05] that. You kill one of them off. Good
[01:52:07] morning, Mahaya. So, you kill another
[01:52:08] one of them off and you're left with one
[01:52:10] left. That is at 20
[01:52:13] health. No, it didn't miss. Didn't miss.
[01:52:17] I was looking at the math wrong. I
[01:52:19] thought you were uh for some reason I
[01:52:20] was counting seven. Sword it this time
[01:52:24] and help rolls your sword. Now the the
[01:52:26] the D4 doesn't count here. Oh
[01:52:32] no. You
[01:52:35] swing with your mighty
[01:52:39] sword that has some uh electrical shock
[01:52:42] there. And uh oh no, you uh that
[01:52:46] electrical
[01:52:47] shock, you hit yourself with it when you
[01:52:53] swung the shock goes off too early. You
[01:52:57] hit yourself with that
[01:53:00] shock and the shock from the lightning
[01:53:02] bolt shoots you back a few feet and
[01:53:04] you're out cold.
[01:53:08] And Booper looks over at the mountain
[01:53:11] and he's like, "What the was that?"
[01:53:13] Because he sees a giant lightning bolt
[01:53:15] come down and strike and a bunch of
[01:53:19] fire. Dude, I can't help it. Shoot you
[01:53:22] back now. Mystic, what you doing there?
[01:53:24] We got one left.
[01:53:27] Plus, there's the robot, too. Mystic.
[01:53:29] All right, so Mystic is going to roll
[01:53:31] and attack.
[01:53:33] Mystic attacks with the gun that they
[01:53:36] have, which is a uh what is it? Plus
[01:53:38] four
[01:53:41] plus seven with a 40. All right, there
[01:53:43] you go. Plus seven.
[01:53:47] Oh, seven plus and six is Well, there
[01:53:51] you go. You miss. It needed to be
[01:53:53] 14. That is not enough to hit. Oh no,
[01:53:59] that is no good. You missed too. But
[01:54:02] your buddy, the rope handy helper robot
[01:54:05] goes, "You know what? I think I have
[01:54:06] some uh I think I can do something
[01:54:08] here." And they try to attack,
[01:54:14] too. Oh no, the handy helper misses
[01:54:18] also. That's not good. What?
[01:54:22] Yeah. Oh, now this is what
[01:54:26] happens. Those guys, that one raider
[01:54:28] that's left tries to attack.
[01:54:34] And that raider attacks and they hit.
[01:54:37] Now big BK is out unconscious on the
[01:54:39] ground. And he hits big BK for nine
[01:54:42] health. Big BK drops down
[01:54:46] to 97 health cuz you had full health
[01:54:49] before. Paid somebody to fill you up.
[01:54:52] You're out cold, but you feel that one
[01:54:53] and that wakes you up. But you can't do
[01:54:56] anything this turn. It's up to our buddy
[01:54:59] um the robot helper and Mystic to see if
[01:55:04] they can take out the last one
[01:55:07] there. Are you going to win and take out
[01:55:11] them? Mystic, your handy helper bot. All
[01:55:14] right, you're going to poop pew pew pew.
[01:55:17] All right, here you
[01:55:18] go. Let's see what happens here for our
[01:55:22] buddy Mystic.
[01:55:32] And you hit with Oh, there you go. You
[01:55:34] hit. Perfect. Oh, and a one. Awesome.
[01:55:38] That means
[01:55:40] six, seven,
[01:55:42] eight. All right. So, we have 11 plus
[01:55:47] you catch them on
[01:55:48] fire. So, one of those are now on fire.
[01:55:52] Dropping in health. So it actually goes
[01:55:53] from 11, makes it 15. So it now has five
[01:55:56] health left
[01:56:00] um
[01:56:03] robot tries to uh
[01:56:06] shoot. And the robot Well, look at that.
[01:56:09] The robot hits. Let's see if it does any
[01:56:12] extra damage. And oh, it does the extra
[01:56:14] damage for one. No. Look at that. The
[01:56:17] robot hits and boom. Sniper rifle.
[01:56:22] That robot uses a sniper
[01:56:25] rifle, shoots them directly in the head,
[01:56:30] and one of those heads goes rolling
[01:56:33] away. And there are no mutant. One night
[01:56:36] mutant raider that was there turns and
[01:56:37] runs and sprints away. You don't have a
[01:56:39] chance to get to him because the mutant
[01:56:40] raider has a whole is very fast. You
[01:56:42] don't even have a chance to do it. Dr.
[01:56:44] Ghoul turns around goes, "Oh, sweet.
[01:56:46] Thank
[01:56:47] god." You have a good one, Lil Jay.
[01:56:50] anytime you want to come and check
[01:56:51] singles out. We have thousands of them
[01:56:53] in there on a regular basis. So, make
[01:56:54] sure you uh jump on in, check them out,
[01:56:56] play some of our adventure games, too,
[01:56:57] and stuff like that if you like. Do some
[01:56:59] adventuring in the wasteland here, my
[01:57:02] friends. Booper J. I like it. Booper got
[01:57:05] yourself a a nice one there, too. Dr.
[01:57:08] Ghoul comes back around and he's like,
[01:57:11] "Hey, nice. You cleared them out. I'm
[01:57:15] going to go over and check those things
[01:57:16] out." And you don't even get a chance to
[01:57:18] do anything. He goes over right away and
[01:57:20] starts
[01:57:21] scavenging. Oh, have a good one, Lil.
[01:57:23] Hey, you know problem. And well, you
[01:57:24] know, we do these on the weekends, too.
[01:57:26] So, make sure you jump in on a Saturday
[01:57:27] or Sunday. That way you can hang out on
[01:57:29] um on hopefully one of your days off. Ba
[01:57:32] Moody. Oh, you're scavenging. Oh, you're
[01:57:35] all scavenging. You
[01:57:38] race. And
[01:57:41] uh Mystic goes races over there. Mystic
[01:57:45] goes, I need a couple of those. And he
[01:57:47] goes, "All
[01:57:49] right, you got uh you do find one
[01:57:53] mutant
[01:57:55] ween says Mystic." Mystic finds one mut
[01:57:58] mutant. Booper is seeing everything in
[01:58:00] the background. Goes, "Oh, sweet. I'm
[01:58:01] going to come over and scavenge." He
[01:58:03] comes running out. He saw all that
[01:58:05] happening and he he was flying out
[01:58:06] toward you guys. He saw that going on in
[01:58:09] the background. Put his wings out and
[01:58:10] decided to fly toward you. And he lands
[01:58:12] in the near you guys and he starts
[01:58:13] scavenging around. Now you are looking
[01:58:16] around. on my friend Miss uh Big Bk. Now
[01:58:20] Big BK looks around with our buddy
[01:58:22] there. Now the uh the ghoul doctor goes
[01:58:25] sweet and he pulls out some uh some
[01:58:29] things from them. You're not really
[01:58:30] seeing what they are. He just stuffs
[01:58:31] them in his pocket. What are those? Ah,
[01:58:32] nothing to worry about. Nothing to worry
[01:58:34] about. And uh like okay. And uh look at
[01:58:39] that. You do see Well, look at this.
[01:58:41] This is cool because it's a raider camp.
[01:58:45] There are
[01:58:47] 34 Pogs that are found there to split up
[01:58:51] between the two of you or three of you,
[01:58:54] whatever it may be. And then you do not
[01:58:58] find any ammo,
[01:59:00] but you do find another code
[01:59:04] disc. And Mystic when he's looking
[01:59:06] around does find the Wii that they're
[01:59:08] looking for. And then uh they also find
[01:59:13] um some leather that was hanging
[01:59:17] around and some
[01:59:20] whiskey. So now you scavenge and then uh
[01:59:24] you keep looking around, digging in the
[01:59:25] area, trying to figure out what you can
[01:59:27] find in the
[01:59:29] wasteland. You scrap metal is found a
[01:59:31] little bit around. All right, not bad.
[01:59:33] Then you uh you go and you're finding
[01:59:35] some things go, "Oh, sweet. Rataway was
[01:59:38] found on one of them. Nice. Then you
[01:59:42] keep looking around and you go, "Oh,
[01:59:44] sweet. An intelligence
[01:59:46] booster.
[01:59:49] Nice. Ah, I like
[01:59:53] this. I'm going to take the skulls." Oh,
[01:59:55] not a bad one. Booper goes, "I would
[01:59:57] like to take the skulls." He goes over
[02:00:00] and he's like, "Yeah, let me go around."
[02:00:01] He starts chopping, finds the one that
[02:00:03] was rolling away. picks the one that
[02:00:04] rolled away up and booper goes. All
[02:00:07] right, boop. There you go. You now
[02:00:12] have
[02:00:14] four mutant raider
[02:00:18] skulls. I like it. You have four mutant
[02:00:21] raider
[02:00:22] skulls. Okay, get the mutant raiders
[02:00:25] now. Anybody else stealing anything?
[02:00:26] Trying to get anything from there? We're
[02:00:27] going to see what else you
[02:00:30] find. I'm guessing um you're going to
[02:00:32] take the disc and the Pogs, my friend,
[02:00:35] unless somebody else would like to have
[02:00:37] something. But we're going to add in the
[02:00:38] disc to you. So, you're now at seven on
[02:00:42] those
[02:00:43] discs. And for your pogs, that would put
[02:00:45] you up to, if we're going to give them
[02:00:46] all to you,
[02:00:48] 236. Or we splitting
[02:00:52] them. And if anybody would like to jump
[02:00:54] in, we can do some more adventuring here
[02:00:56] on the wasteland and see how it goes for
[02:00:59] the day.
[02:01:01] Dr. Ghoul is still looking around goes,
[02:01:02] "Oh, sweet. Another like what are you
[02:01:04] talking about? What another what?" And
[02:01:06] you see him take a knife out and cut one
[02:01:08] of them open and takes something. What
[02:01:10] are you
[02:01:12] doing? All right. Then he he stuffs
[02:01:15] something in his bag. I'm not really
[02:01:16] sure what he's doing, but he's excited
[02:01:18] about some of these uh some of these
[02:01:19] mutants here. He runs over. Doctor runs
[02:01:22] over to another one. Sweet. Cuts it
[02:01:24] open. Oh, this one's missing. All right.
[02:01:26] All right. All right. Let's go. He keeps
[02:01:28] going. Wanders on. He looks through all
[02:01:30] four, takes two things from them, puts
[02:01:33] them in his bag, then uh wanders away
[02:01:36] back over to you guys. Now, uh one of
[02:01:40] you when you're kicking around there,
[02:01:42] you don't really find much, but somebody
[02:01:44] did find
[02:01:46] um an axe that one of them had. All
[02:01:50] right. Hey, how's it going, my friend?
[02:01:51] Wazer beast. We have some uh packs for
[02:01:54] you guys in our auto box there. A bunch
[02:01:56] of dragons here.
[02:02:00] piece of leather. Ah, yes. Booper.
[02:02:02] Booper takes some of the leather. All
[02:02:04] right. Boop takes
[02:02:12] leather.
[02:02:16] Leather. All right, we're going to grab
[02:02:18] uh You only were able to find one and
[02:02:21] you're going to split the Pogs.
[02:02:25] So go with you get um you're now Big BK.
[02:02:30] You're at
[02:02:32] 217. Our buddy Mystic goes up to
[02:02:38] 30.
[02:02:41] Um
[02:02:42] four
[02:02:44] 34 and
[02:02:51] then Booper takes an axe. Yeah, Boop
[02:02:53] takes the axe if that's fine with me. If
[02:02:55] no one wants it,
[02:02:57] grabs the
[02:03:03] axe.
[02:03:14] Here you go. I don't know why that
[02:03:16] happened. My thing went away. Take it,
[02:03:20] buddy. Nice. All right, so you guys get
[02:03:22] to decide. What are you doing further in
[02:03:26] our wasteland? We may be hitting
[02:03:29] something. We may not. It's up to you,
[02:03:31] everybody.
[02:03:33] The rocket launcher is now available as
[02:03:36] you're scavenging around. Ah, see you
[02:03:39] might want to might want to scavenge a
[02:03:41] little more. There you go. You're
[02:03:43] looking around and you go, "Oh,
[02:03:45] shite." Well, look at
[02:03:49] that. You go and you happen to
[02:03:56] find Thought I did that already.
[02:04:02] Um, it looks like some uh some things in
[02:04:04] the background here. Like, oh, what are
[02:04:07] those? As you look in the uh mutant camp
[02:04:10] there, you go look in the back of one of
[02:04:12] those trucks that you see in the in the
[02:04:13] background. You're like, oh, what is
[02:04:14] that
[02:04:15] thing? And there you go, my friend. In
[02:04:18] the truck
[02:04:25] there, you find
[02:04:30] some of
[02:04:32] these big
[02:04:34] BK, but it looks like there's only one
[02:04:37] of them that may be
[02:04:39] working out of it. But you do have some
[02:04:41] more. Maybe if you find some more
[02:04:43] components to it, your buddy might be
[02:04:45] able to help get them together.
[02:04:49] So, you now have rockets.
[02:04:55] You have one working rocket right now.
[02:05:00] one working rocket right
[02:05:02] now. So, I'm gonna put you back up here.
[02:05:11] With
[02:05:13] one with one rocket.
[02:05:17] It's loaded now. Your rocket launcher is
[02:05:21] ready to go. Can you upgrade your axe?
[02:05:23] Yeah, you can try to upgrade your axe.
[02:05:25] Not a problem. Boop. You want to jump
[02:05:26] in? Try to upgrade your axe there. I
[02:05:29] don't have a problem with that. There we
[02:05:31] go. All righty. As we get it going here,
[02:05:34] my friends and we're going to do some
[02:05:35] fun things adventuring around which is
[02:05:39] loaded and we're ready to
[02:05:41] go. All right. Now, today, what do we
[02:05:44] have to do today, Mom?
[02:05:47] Are they off to dock? Anyone? Right now?
[02:05:50] Yep. They just put uh the big monohs.
[02:05:53] Okay. So, we should be able to get over
[02:05:54] there maybe. Right now, unless They'll
[02:05:56] sneak in before us. All right. All
[02:05:58] right. So, now this is what we have to
[02:06:01] do here. There's what we're got to do.
[02:06:04] We have some rockets that you found. You
[02:06:07] You've cleaned up the
[02:06:09] camp. You're
[02:06:12] staring in the
[02:06:16] distance. Where the hell did that
[02:06:18] go at a mountain? And you're like, I'm
[02:06:21] going to meet it. I'm going to make it
[02:06:22] to you. I'm going to be there. I'm going
[02:06:23] to get there cuz I need to find where
[02:06:25] that where that vault
[02:06:27] is. So, but this is what we have to do
[02:06:31] today.
[02:06:32] I have to head out and go and move our
[02:06:37] boat so we can get on the dock and
[02:06:38] finally get our our solar arch on. With
[02:06:41] that being said, I'm going to raid into
[02:06:43] a friend of ours. We're going to go over

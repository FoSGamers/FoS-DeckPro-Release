[00:13:05] that sucks dude I've been there before I
[00:13:07] I've had it a couple times I actually
[00:13:09] may have had it one of the first ones
[00:13:10] having it in the US here got it in the
[00:13:12] early uh like months before everyone
[00:13:16] else all right yeah cuz see this here is
[00:13:18] actually an all in open box that I had
[00:13:21] been used we were planning on using
[00:13:22] wazer we're doing um building Our Deck
[00:13:25] stuff with this is all already sleeved
[00:13:27] up for everybody so I was going to be
[00:13:28] like all right you buy buy a few packs
[00:13:30] and we'll fill it out with these to
[00:13:32] build a
[00:13:34] deck cuz I'm starting to learn a little
[00:13:36] bit of it what do you guys think there
[00:13:38] you think that's a good one what I need
[00:13:39] to do now here is I'm actually going to
[00:13:41] take these because I think we're done
[00:13:44] with using those let move those over
[00:13:46] here because we're not doing too much
[00:13:47] with those ones right now we're not
[00:13:48] building anything at the moment because
[00:13:50] I still have to get a little bit under a
[00:13:52] little bit of a learning curve down here
[00:13:55] so but I do think one of the things I
[00:13:57] wanted to do today we're gonna play this
[00:13:59] little game we had planned I need to put
[00:14:02] something in the background here
[00:14:06] that move these
[00:14:10] over okay that right
[00:14:16] there move this over
[00:14:22] here that way you block everything so
[00:14:24] nothing can fall down in the back there
[00:14:27] all righty
[00:14:29] I can get sleeves and stuff like that as
[00:14:30] needed
[00:14:33] Perfect all right so the game that we're
[00:14:36] going to play today I want to see if we
[00:14:38] can do this so I was going to do
[00:14:40] something like this I was going to go
[00:14:41] like this and be like all right
[00:14:44] hey I'm G to put this out for a card we
[00:14:48] find
[00:14:52] it nope not that
[00:14:57] one this one
[00:15:00] so I'd be like I'd put out a card I'd
[00:15:02] see if I can make it so you can
[00:15:07] co-host all
[00:15:10] right I'd put out a card here I'd be
[00:15:12] like all right so here is you'd buy say
[00:15:14] I'd put out the mystery booster put the
[00:15:16] mystery booster out you jump in by the
[00:15:17] mystery booster for whatever I put it up
[00:15:20] for for the for the auction then I would
[00:15:23] have you in here as on on the uh
[00:15:25] co-hosting so your visual the reason for
[00:15:28] the visual part of it is I need to make
[00:15:30] sure you're not using your hands to go
[00:15:32] and search for the answer because what
[00:15:36] we're going to do is I'm going to put
[00:15:36] this up it'll be like all right here's
[00:15:39] your here it is I need you to get me
[00:15:42] what is the price of tail of cameo in
[00:15:48] foil and you need to be within 25 cents
[00:15:51] of it if you are I'll run a buyer
[00:15:54] giveaway because I'll start it right at
[00:15:55] the beginning of the buy I'll start at
[00:15:56] the buyer giveaway I'll create one at
[00:15:58] the beginning of the round
[00:16:00] and if you happen to win I'll run the
[00:16:01] buyers giveaway which pretty much it
[00:16:03] allows anybody that buys in during that
[00:16:04] round or anybody that fills out a thing
[00:16:06] to jump in on it but I'm only going to
[00:16:07] run it for like 15 seconds for the buyer
[00:16:08] giveway so that kind of Narrows down the
[00:16:11] options there of who's getting it so
[00:16:12] that's what plann there I still do the
[00:16:14] adventure actually I have a little bit
[00:16:15] of new thing alador that we're doing
[00:16:18] with the adventure
[00:16:19] um I'm you I'm making a couple of
[00:16:22] changes to the adventure I'll say I have
[00:16:24] it exact I don't have it exactly the
[00:16:25] same as I did before but I am making a
[00:16:28] couple of changes to it
[00:16:29] so yeah so exactly so you could come in
[00:16:32] you would guess whatever it was and I'd
[00:16:35] be like all right well and then I'd
[00:16:36] reveal what the price is
[00:16:39] here I'd be like all right well the
[00:16:41] price is
[00:16:44] actually this here Why didn't it
[00:16:49] show why didn't Chrome show hold on a
[00:16:53] second
[00:17:03] and I'd be like all right there you go
[00:17:04] kale tamamo is
[00:17:09] three 30 60 you were
[00:17:12] off so you wouldn't we wouldn't run the
[00:17:15] buyers giveaway I'd throw this over to
[00:17:16] the side we do it maybe another time
[00:17:17] throw it at the end of the stream or
[00:17:18] whatever and then I would start another
[00:17:20] round where I would create another buyer
[00:17:22] giveaway um I'd put another card out and
[00:17:24] be like all right what's the price of
[00:17:25] this one and after you buy in you buy
[00:17:27] your pack and then if you happen to win
[00:17:30] get it right within the 25 cents or
[00:17:32] whatever it is we would run
[00:17:34] it as the buyers giveway what do you
[00:17:37] guys think of the idea you think it's a
[00:17:38] good one I don't know I thought it was
[00:17:39] kind of a cool idea because it pretty
[00:17:41] much ties everybody into the round into
[00:17:44] the buyers get wait for the
[00:17:45] round and then um if I mean I guess if
[00:17:49] you buy something from the buy now or
[00:17:50] you fill out a form you could get into
[00:17:52] it for the buyers giveaway but
[00:17:54] technically it just kind of you can do
[00:17:56] that but it would tie everybody into the
[00:17:57] round I thought it was kind of a good
[00:18:00] idea but yes I
[00:18:04] do no no not this we're not doing this
[00:18:07] right now this is a little different I
[00:18:08] do have an old I do the old Adventure I

[00:18:15] same animations all right it's going to
[00:18:17] be a little bit different with the
[00:18:18] animations but the adventure pretty much
[00:18:20] going to be the same but it's going to
[00:18:22] be a bit more enhanced I believe you'll

[00:30:54] let's see where I have
[00:30:56] them uh
[00:30:59] um sorcery deck so you have like U you

[00:31:04] me see where I have my sorcery stuff oh
[00:31:07] no oh it's right over here
[00:31:37] nope not
[00:31:39] there nope not there all right either
[00:31:41] way here I'll show you what I
[00:31:44] got so you have all kinds of different
[00:31:47] stuff with your sorcery Decks that you
[00:31:49] can
[00:31:50] do now a lot of times people you have to
[00:31:53] start with like an
[00:31:55] avatar so what we was getting out
[00:31:57] earlier you'll have an avatar of some
[00:31:59] kind and then um you can build your
[00:32:01] cards around having one unique character
[00:32:04] in there plus um your avatar you can
[00:32:08] have so like say you have this as an
[00:32:09] avatar here that would be your avatar
[00:32:12] and it would be able to do the special
[00:32:13] thing here whatever it says tap or
[00:32:15] whatever depending on whatever it tells
[00:32:17] you to do all of them have different
[00:32:18] ones but uh you have up to 60 cards you
[00:32:21] play um I think it's up to four
[00:32:24] ordinaries which are the ones that say
[00:32:26] ordinary on them uh
[00:32:29] three exceptional two Elite and one
[00:32:32] uncommon per deck um and then you pretty
[00:32:36] much you build up your deck based on
[00:32:37] whatever you want now a lot of people
[00:32:39] will build it based on their you know
[00:32:40] obviously going to build it on based on
[00:32:41] your uh thing here hey look what I got
[00:32:45] by the
[00:32:48] way I don't know if you guys ever saw
[00:32:50] that that's a nice pickup isn't
[00:32:54] it that's pretty sweet huh
[00:32:59] oh yes but say like you're going to be
[00:33:00] the battle mage this is by the way the
[00:33:03] philos stone is like one of the is one
[00:33:05] of if not the best card you can get by
[00:33:07] the
[00:33:10] way that that's why I was showing that
[00:33:12] card but the battle mage here all right
[00:33:15] you'd be able to say it would tap player
[00:33:18] draw a sight whenever battle mage
[00:33:19] attacks kills an enemy you m draw a
[00:33:22] spell so that's how you kind of play
[00:33:24] with your your your battle mage you move
[00:33:26] them around the your chess likee mat
[00:33:30] play um so you could build it up where
[00:33:35] however you want so there's like fire
[00:33:38] earth fire water air kind of are like
[00:33:41] the three type of Elemental decks I mean
[00:33:43] four type of Elemental decks you build
[00:33:44] your stuff kind of B based around that
[00:33:47] and there you go that's
[00:33:50] it I mean we have some I mean I can get
[00:33:53] one of my decks out I don't know where I
[00:33:54] put it recently I have to go look for it
[00:33:55] it's going to take me a minute to find
[00:33:57] it just because I moved a bunch of stuff
[00:33:59] around the other day cuz we were having
[00:34:02] moved to where I am so it'll take me a
[00:34:04] minute to find them but yeah not too
[00:34:08] hard actually it's pretty
[00:34:09] straightforward and one of my favorite
[00:34:11] things with the rules that it tells you
[00:34:13] is it literally says with the rules like
[00:34:14] read the card use common sense if it has
[00:34:18] common sense if you use common sense
[00:34:20] between the two of you don't fight over
[00:34:22] the game you're supposed to be having
[00:34:23] fun is like one of the things it says in
[00:34:25] the rule book so I pretty
[00:34:27] straightforward you want you want to
[00:34:28] have fun you're not there to be like
[00:34:30] fighting each other continuously so yeah
[00:34:32] I mean you're fighting in a game but
[00:34:33] you're not like getting a fist fights
[00:34:35] because somebody's not doing something
[00:34:36] right but there you go that's kind of
[00:34:39] like
[00:34:40] um little quick rundown of how decks are
[00:34:43] done I can give you more in depth on
[00:34:45] that if you'd like um if you want to
[00:34:48] jump in the Discord and we talk about it
[00:34:49] a little bit uh and I actually like I
[00:34:52] said I planed on building I don't know
[00:34:54] where I put mine I was building a deck
[00:34:56] the other day with you guys and I had
[00:34:58] most of it almost done and I literally
[00:35:00] have no idea where I put that it's going
[00:35:03] to frustrate me a
[00:35:05] lot one of them just
[00:35:08] because oh yes true the sets some of
[00:35:10] those sets are cool to interest
[00:35:17] you but wazer
[00:35:21] doodle you spent yep you
[00:35:25] did all right hold on
[00:35:28] so since you spent
[00:35:31] 5050 actually we're going to do this
[00:35:33] here going take these out I'm just going
[00:35:36] to literally do this because I need to
[00:35:37] get rid of the Box the Box there's not
[00:35:40] enough stuff in the Box I need to I need
[00:35:42] to move it we're going to do this here
[00:35:44] put that off to the side because I need
[00:35:46] to put these things all over here easier
[00:35:50] more room for me all right then what I
[00:35:54] do though is wazer you
[00:35:57] being got the
[00:36:01] uh hitting a $50 Mark here you actually
[00:36:04] get a free pull from this which is our
[00:36:09] buyer box all right now let me get this
[00:36:13] set up here for a second give me one
[00:36:15] minute because I just need to make sure
[00:36:17] this doesn't fall over put that back
[00:36:20] over here these are all the ones that
[00:36:22] were in there from uh uh oh hold on one
[00:36:26] second
[00:36:29] there we go got to take all those out
[00:36:30] the bloomo play booster things
[00:36:33] out because those are put in there from
[00:36:35] the bloomo game not this one all right
[00:36:38] and there's 100 cards in here all right
[00:36:40] 100 cards you get a choice of one of
[00:36:42] them we're going to shuffle them all up
[00:36:45] and then what happens is because you
[00:36:47] spent 50 you get a bonus pull from the
[00:36:49] bonus box everybody that spends $50
[00:36:52] every time you get that amount you get a
[00:36:54] bonus poll from the bonus box now you
[00:36:56] get whatever cards in here and one of
[00:36:58] them could have a pack listed on them as
[00:37:00] a booster it would say play booster um
[00:37:03] not just play booster not bloomo
[00:37:06] collector booster or something like that
[00:37:07] that's all from the game that I've been

[00:56:29] you got an avatar with the post
[00:56:32] office I just think I'm I'm thinking it
[00:56:34] has to do with um I'm just going to
[00:56:35] throw it out there anybody that's had
[00:56:37] any orders from me recently and if
[00:56:39] they're a little bit late there was the
[00:56:41] hurricane down here um so I know some
[00:56:44] stuff was just running a little late
[00:56:46] because some of the places didn't get
[00:56:48] things out on time and I know some
[00:56:50] places didn't have power for a while and

[00:56:54] orders are coming in late but everything
[00:56:56] has been shipped out I'm just saying I'm
[00:56:59] guessing that's what's probably going on

[01:14:37] necessary all
[01:14:39] righty
[01:14:42] now what do you guys think of my idea
[01:14:44] though anybody else into the sorcery
[01:14:46] enough that they might like the build
[01:14:47] the Box
[01:14:48] idea or build a deck idea you know what
[01:14:50] I can even find my thanks you can do
[01:14:54] that like Wednesday or
[01:14:56] something try to find my box
[01:15:14] cutter yeah I thought I brought it in
[01:15:16] here but I don't know what I did with
[01:15:19] it that's not good to drop and lose is a
[01:15:21] box cutter that's dangerous
[01:15:26] nope I found it I did now it was
[01:15:29] blending in with a black
[01:15:31] thing I had it sitting on the dop of
[01:15:33] something black and it Blended right
[01:15:34] into it all right here we go we're going
[01:15:37] to open that up had to find where it
[01:15:39] was what do you guys think about that
[01:15:42] should we do some
[01:15:44] um sorcery deck building coming up
[01:15:51] here but anyways we'll open this up
[01:15:56] and my buddy wazer since you ended that
[01:15:59] last box I'm actually going to send you
[01:16:01] this too all right I'm going to send you
[01:16:04] one of these because I got a couple of
[01:16:05] them you're going to get this which
[01:16:07] comes with a bunch of the mini cards
[01:16:08] there okay
[01:16:20] wazer yeah go those fun little mini
[01:16:22] cards there now what we're going to do
[01:16:24] here the thing I was was told is these
[01:16:25] are put in and there's chunks of cards
[01:16:27] and places so I got to take them out and
[01:16:30] I'm supposed to shuffle them so that we
[01:16:33] can have them
[01:16:36] all where we can uh get to them so I'm
[01:16:39] going to do that quickly here because
[01:16:41] there's supposed to be I guess there
[01:16:42] supposedly um the they built when they
[01:16:44] put the packs together it kind of uh it
[01:16:46] could be chunks of things together I
[01:16:48] guess supposedly like uh like they might
[01:16:50] have chunks of uniques chunks of foils
[01:16:52] in the same area
[01:16:55] so you have to shuffle them up to get
[01:16:57] them spread out I was told by a couple
[01:16:58] of our people here and now for the day
[01:17:01] buddy yep have a good one love you I
[01:17:04] love you be
[01:17:06] good all right so we're going to do that
[01:17:08] we're going to take these ones over here
[01:17:10] do the same
[01:17:15] thing that's the Avatar you build your
[01:17:18] deck around right yes you build your
[01:17:19] deck around an avatar
[01:17:21] correct yeah you find whatever Avatar
[01:17:23] you wanted to use and then you build
[01:17:25] your deck around it that is correct so
[01:17:28] like for me I have um like you have a
[01:17:31] couple of them that you got out just now
[01:17:33] but for like we could look at that like
[01:17:35] the geomancer wouldn't be a bad one um
[01:17:37] but you like you already got a couple of
[01:17:39] the avatars in in your packs so you can
[01:17:41] choose your different ones because you
[01:17:43] got like what I think there was three
[01:17:44] avatars you got so I'm going to do this
[01:17:47] here with one last
[01:17:49] Shuffle and then I'm going to be
[01:17:52] done we going to have these available
[01:17:54] for for people if they want
[01:18:00] them that's two of them next to each
[01:18:02] other
[01:18:05] whatever there and
[01:18:08] then take all those put it back in the
[01:18:12] box so each one of these
[01:18:15] columns has a better chance of getting
[01:18:17] everything evenly
[01:18:19] supposedly that's my that's what I was
[01:18:21] told by multiple people do I believe
[01:18:23] them most of the two people that told me
[01:18:25] I do believe yes so there we go we got
[01:18:29] that there and
[01:18:31] then where do we have our other
[01:18:34] stuff give me one
[01:18:36] second all righty so that being
[01:18:45] said my wife art no I did not find her

[01:27:37] said let's
[01:27:39] do some more stuff here now this morning
[01:27:45] I'm going to take a drink again before
[01:27:46] my start
[01:27:51] getting we do have um
[01:27:54] a game I was trying to plan it on
[01:27:56] playing here I didn't know if you guys
[01:27:58] would be interested in it so the rules
[01:28:01] are in uh the buy now all
[01:28:04] right
[01:28:07] um
[01:28:09] but the rules are I mean in the not the
[01:28:11] bu now the rules are in the
[01:28:20] um why is that an that's supposed to be
[01:28:22] as an auction I'm sorry I don't want to
[01:28:23] make sure was the right thing the rules
[01:28:26] are in the show
[01:28:28] notes you should be able to see all of
[01:28:30] it on how to
[01:28:31] play so what I'm going to do here is for
[01:28:34] instance I would take out a card here
[01:28:37] and I would
[01:28:38] say this card
[01:28:40] here we're going to get out a card I'm
[01:28:43] going to go like this and pull a thing
[01:28:45] here
[01:28:57] all
[01:28:58] right and I would put this out and I
[01:29:01] would say what is the price of this card
[01:29:04] and I would to make you as a co-host all
[01:29:06] right and
[01:29:09] then oh it's not been that slow not been
[01:29:12] that slow it's been all right we not too
[01:29:14] bad so what we're going to do though is
[01:29:16] this and then what you do is I would had
[01:29:18] it out there you would co-host so I'd
[01:29:20] have you come in and co-host I would
[01:29:22] flip the card around so I'd have the
[01:29:23] card like this and then you I'd have you
[01:29:25] come in and
[01:29:27] co-host then what I would do is after
[01:29:29] you you know you do your auction you bid
[01:29:30] it and you get the pack or whatever it
[01:29:32] is that I put up there I'll flip this
[01:29:33] card around and you'll have 30 seconds
[01:29:36] to tell me what the price of this card
[01:29:38] is and you need to get in within 15
[01:29:42] cents now you only get three
[01:29:45] guesses okay so you need to make sure
[01:29:48] you're good with it so for instance for
[01:29:50] this one
[01:29:51] say Mr Fong do you have a minute that
[01:29:55] you
[01:29:55] could be on here as a co-host and I can
[01:29:58] then bump you off and then you can take
[01:30:01] a guess or are you busy right now of
[01:30:04] course let's see if we can get this to
[01:30:05] work here we're going to test this out
[01:30:07] this is the first attempt at
[01:30:09] this let's see I sent you the invite and
[01:30:12] if you are on a
[01:30:15] phone should be able to pop in
[01:30:18] here and do this little co-hosting
[01:30:22] thing is my light on
[01:30:25] hey oh it's because I'm laying in yeah
[01:30:30] hear
[01:30:31] work maybe it won't work you
[01:30:37] hear ah I can't see him it might be his
[01:30:39] uh thing there okay so you have to
[01:30:41] figure out the video oh there you go I'm
[01:30:43] in bed you can see him so what you would
[01:30:45] do here is you can see him and he would
[01:30:47] say what do you thought it was going to
[01:30:49] be what do you think is here
[01:30:56] how much you think it is uh 89 cents 89
[01:31:01] cents all right we're going to go with
[01:31:02] I'm going to show that and you are and
[01:31:05] you are and you are and you are and you
[01:31:08] are and you are that's me and you are
[01:31:11] not within the uh not within it you're
[01:31:16] too far
[01:31:17] away well you said 89 you would have got
[01:31:19] it you would have got it so you would
[01:31:20] have ended up getting it actually I lie
[01:31:21] you would have ended up getting it
[01:31:23] because you said 8 89 see so you would
[01:31:25] have so what we would have done here is
[01:31:27] I would have end up running a buyer
[01:31:28] giveaway right after and that's what
[01:31:29] have happened all right so let me do
[01:31:32] this here I'm going to go this I'm going
[01:31:33] to do this we're going to go remove from
[01:31:35] co-hosting we're go back to here and see
[01:31:38] that's what I was thinking we would do
[01:31:39] kind of that was an echol Loop that was
[01:31:41] my favorite that there you go so that's
[01:31:44] what I was thinking we would do there is
[01:31:46] play our game there like that and since
[01:31:48] he got it I'd run a buyer giveaway and
[01:31:50] since he was the first one in the round
[01:31:51] he was the only one in the round pretty
[01:31:52] much he'd be the only one to get in the
[01:31:53] buers giveway which will allow him to
[01:31:55] get the card from the
[01:31:58] round
[01:31:59] oh Dan how do you kiss
[01:32:02] goodbye sorry
[01:32:04] [Laughter]
[01:32:07] buddy but what do you what do you think
[01:32:10] there I thought it would be kind of a
[01:32:12] fun game get within the price if you
[01:32:16] guys want to play let me know what your
[01:32:17] thought
[01:32:18] is so what I'm going to do here is I'm
[01:32:20] going to run the first one and I'm going
[01:32:23] to do it like this now this isn't the
[01:32:24] card there that was the giveaway card
[01:32:26] the giveaway went to oh look at that Mr
[01:32:28] F got the giveaway card for bigger I
[01:32:31] didn't notice that's why you said
[01:32:34] Rigg here we
[01:32:37] go number eight all right we'll put
[01:32:39] number eight back out there again for
[01:32:40] the next
[01:32:42] one I was not understanding that one
[01:32:45] like all
[01:32:46] right one two three four five six seven
[01:32:50] eight all right so what I would do is we
[01:32:52] put that out
[01:32:58] I don't think I did that right but
[01:32:59] anyways I put that out there this is our
[01:33:01] giveaway card we're going to put that in
[01:33:03] the background since we don't need to
[01:33:04] see that right now then what I'm going
[01:33:05] to do here is I'm going to go like this
[01:33:07] we're going to pick something out and
[01:33:10] I'm going to get a card
[01:33:22] ready all right
[01:33:27] okay so now you have to be within the
[01:33:29] market price and you'll end up getting
[01:33:31] the card so this is the card here like I
[01:33:34] said not a not a giant special card not
[01:33:36] a giant hit or anything of any kind but
[01:33:38] it's a more of a fun little game we get
[01:33:40] to play that's all it is now what I'm
[01:33:42] going to do is I'm going to put out our
[01:33:43] mystery booster here for all of
[01:33:46] you and we're going to auction
[01:33:49] this with our guess it and we're going
[01:33:52] to start it out like this and if you
[01:33:53] want want to do that we're going to put
[01:33:54] you in as a co-host that way I have to
[01:33:57] see you so I know that you're not
[01:33:59] cheating what do you think it's up to
[01:34:02] you if you want to try it new new little
[01:34:04] thing something unique not everybody
[01:34:07] necessar wants to do it but I want to
[01:34:09] try it out all right not bad all right
[01:34:12] that's all right maybe it's a different
[01:34:13] pack of cards maybe it's a different
[01:34:15] pack let's do some dusk M here instead
[01:34:19] since we had just worn
[01:34:21] out you were in bed so you couldn't
[01:34:23] cheat
[01:34:24] that is true that is true you couldn't
[01:34:26] cheat you were in bed so we're going to
[01:34:28] put this out and we'll throw this on for
[01:34:31] we'll do this so if somebody wants to
[01:34:32] try it the first time all right who
[01:34:35] wants to do it now you have to remember
[01:34:36] guys you're going to have to jump in so
[01:34:38] we can see the video and that I can make
[01:34:40] sure that you are uh not cheating when
[01:34:43] you're trying to get the card okay so
[01:34:46] here we go let's try it let's see who
[01:34:47] wants to do
[01:34:50] it try it out here
[01:34:58] all right maybe it's not as fun of a
[01:34:59] game I
[01:35:01] thought hey that's all
[01:35:04] right I try new ones all the time this
[01:35:07] is why we're trying it out and I didn't
[01:35:09] put a lot too too much effort into
[01:35:10] making it like I did with the Wheel of
[01:35:12] Fortune game The Wheel of Fortune game
[01:35:14] my wheel of Magic game is pretty fun but
[01:35:16] I didn't put as much effort in it I'll
[01:35:17] do a wheel of magic once a week I was
[01:35:20] planning on doing let's throw a duskborn
[01:35:22] instead
[01:35:24] for a collector booster maybe you want
[01:35:26] to try it with
[01:35:29] this probably a tired group yep probably
[01:35:32] a tired group in the
[01:35:34] morning that's possible too so I'm going
[01:35:36] to throw this out and I try one more one
[01:35:39] more to see if somebody wants to try it
[01:35:43] out one more and after and we'll try it
[01:35:46] out that's it and maybe we'll do it
[01:35:47] later on in the day when it these
[01:35:52] time ah I think that's part of
[01:35:55] why that might be part of the problem
[01:35:57] there I wasn't even paying attention to
[01:35:59] how many people had gotten into the
[01:36:00] stream right now I was just going slow
[01:36:02] and not even doing much now our
[01:36:05] giveaway card was this one back here I
[01:36:07] think this one Mr Fong you put that out
[01:36:10] we're going to run another one there
[01:36:12] we'll start another one
[01:36:14] there yeah that would probably work
[01:36:16] better with more people in here that
[01:36:17] definitely makes sense but either way we
[01:36:20] got that going on I thought that was
[01:36:21] pretty fun one we can try that out
[01:36:25] now the other thing I was going to do
[01:36:26] today is um I fig I'll throw out some
[01:36:29] singles
[01:36:31] okay we are running a break but no one
[01:36:34] had been jumping into it so it
[01:36:36] is
[01:36:38] one two it is the High Roller break if
[01:36:41] we haven't had anybody get into it yet
[01:36:44] today uh it's this one here that we had
[01:36:46] I might need to change it then there's
[01:36:48] these these then you get your Dungeons
[01:36:52] and Dragons eye of the beholder in the
[01:36:53] little
[01:36:54] Legends so that was our um dusm miniak
[01:36:58] High Roller so I don't know if anybody
[01:37:01] likes those if they don't maybe that's
[01:37:02] what I need I need to switch it up but
[01:37:04] um people were playing the game
[01:37:05] yesterday and they weren't really
[01:37:06] looking into the break so that's why I
[01:37:08] didn't like switch it up for today but
[01:37:09] if You' like to that is our break that I
[01:37:12] have all our cards right there for those
[01:37:15] if you want to do
[01:37:17] it and that would be I can pin that here
[01:37:19] if you guys want for the break to get
[01:37:22] that going if you like to jump in on any
[01:37:24] of
[01:37:25] those and now what I'm going to do
[01:37:28] is let's see this
[01:37:31] morning yeah I know Mondays and Tuesdays
[01:37:34] are slower days so that's why I was
[01:37:35] planning on myself just um I'm actually
[01:37:36] probably going to take Tuesday off just
[01:37:39] because I don't need uh you know I got I
[01:37:41] got stuff I need to take care of um you
[01:37:43] know do business related background
[01:37:45] stuff no that type of thing
[01:37:55] there you
[01:37:59] go here we
[01:38:03] are all right so yeah we can do that and
[01:38:06] have some
[01:38:08] fun see what happens now we'll um I
[01:38:11] don't put too much effort into doing
[01:38:12] stuff on Monday this today figuring
[01:38:14] things out these are my days where I try
[01:38:16] different things out with people see
[01:38:18] what you guys like so oh my my my things
[01:38:21] aren't on like there in the week
[01:38:23] generally what I do I do see somebody
[01:38:25] took my name though today I like that
[01:38:27] somebody likes to use rise and shine
[01:38:29] it's always nice when you see somebody
[01:38:31] copying so it means uh means you must be
[01:38:33] doing something that Everyone likes I
[01:38:35] like that makes me feel good makes me
[01:38:37] feel like I'm doing something right let
[01:38:39] me do um let's see what else we can do
[01:38:44] here because we didn't have a lot of
[01:38:46] plan today other than doing our uh
[01:38:48] trying our game out here no one really
[01:38:50] wanted to do that one the new one so we
[01:38:51] can go and do some singles
[01:38:54] we go and do some singles
[01:38:59] maybe let's put out maybe some singles
[01:39:04] here I don't know we'll find out let's
[01:39:06] think should we do
[01:39:16] that I have to check where I have
[01:39:18] everything first before I can put those
[01:39:20] out cuz I don't know if I have all these
[01:39:21] put away put them in the buy now
[01:39:25] yet so I know some of them
[01:39:30] aren't I don't if I really want to go
[01:39:32] through those right now because I was
[01:39:33] going to get those in the buy now and
[01:39:34] put them up on my shop oh I'm G to have
[01:39:36] a shop set up
[01:39:37] later that's another thing that we're
[01:39:39] getting set up soon we're going to have
[01:39:40] that set up on our on our YouTube so you
[01:39:42] guys can jump into all the other stuff
[01:39:44] that we're doing
[01:39:45] too let me get to here let me see what I
[01:39:48] want to do now I feel like I want to do
[01:39:51] something open one of those but I need
[01:39:54] to dig down to find
[01:39:56] that that's going to put some effort
[01:39:58] into getting
[01:40:01] those I have to just dig down and get
[01:40:03] those I I'd move those over
[01:40:05] there but my wife did want one of those
[01:40:08] so maybe that's what we do
[01:40:11] today think this is the last this is
[01:40:13] what we'll end up doing
[01:40:15] today my
[01:40:17] wife like the like the
[01:40:21] uh dice out of here
[01:40:24] so I think we might open this
[01:40:26] up and that'll be the end of
[01:40:32] it yes that that's all right it happens
[01:40:35] I don't worry about
[01:40:37] that I'm going to put this over here
[01:40:39] though move that back up over there on
[01:40:43] top that
[01:40:47] way you guys see my sorcery up
[01:40:51] here in our game

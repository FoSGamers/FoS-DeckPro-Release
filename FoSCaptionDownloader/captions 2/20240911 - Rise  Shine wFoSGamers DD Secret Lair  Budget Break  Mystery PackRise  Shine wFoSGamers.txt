[01:16:42] people have their phone at work so they
[01:16:44] can't comment that's per exactly like
[01:16:46] but like the thing the difference is
[01:16:48] though like we know some of you are like
[01:16:50] you're around here though Bob you hang
[01:16:52] out and you do comment at times the
[01:16:54] difference that we're talking about is
[01:16:55] people don't comment at all is what I
[01:16:57] think they're getting at they don't say
[01:16:58] anything at all they've never been in
[01:16:59] and then all of a sudden
[01:17:09] boom TT text like a drunk person I see
[01:17:14] that I really don't care what people do
[01:17:17] personally because it's you know it's
[01:17:18] their stuff I just was uh it's more of a
[01:17:21] statement of um
[01:17:25] there's a difference between people that
[01:17:26] are in here all the time hanging out and
[01:17:28] they don't get a chance to say anything
[01:17:30] versus the people that are never in here
[01:17:32] and they never do anything yeah like
[01:17:34] click clack I know click clack's busy
[01:17:36] all the time like I don't I'm not like
[01:17:38] he's here hanging out or I know Bob is
[01:17:40] around too or sometimes Mr Fong has
[01:17:42] their thing away and like things like
[01:17:43] that you guys are in here and you're
[01:17:44] chatting at times it's like the people
[01:17:45] that never come in and randomly come
[01:17:47] walk away with something is what I think
[01:17:48] people are talking about treasure hidden
[01:17:51] cataract Intrepid paleontologist oh I
[01:17:54] guess he's an in the opposite order
[01:17:55] there I'll have to do that next time for

[01:18:23] you don't want to be so because that we
[01:18:25] like I don't mind I understand people
[01:18:26] don't like they they're working and I
[01:18:29] think it's the uh I think people are
[01:18:30] more commenting about the people that
[01:18:31] never talk or never do anything and then
[01:18:34] they like disappear right after and go
[01:18:35] to the next stream to find the next
[01:18:40] giveaway I that's what people are

[01:19:07] people are saying like no one ever
[01:19:09] responds says anything they don't never
[01:19:11] been in before I think those are the
[01:19:12] ones that everybody's complaining about

[02:05:35] say you were the second one to jump in
[02:05:36] the break your name would be written
[02:05:38] down on a card of some kind like a proxy
[02:05:40] card that would be down for everybody to
[02:05:41] see and then we would um hand out all
[02:05:45] the rares mythics Commons and uncommons
[02:05:46] and later on in the Stream right before
[02:05:48] I end the stream I end up doing a um
[02:05:50] I'll end up showing you guys guys the uh
[02:05:53] uncommons and Commons we'll hand those
[02:05:55] out to everybody quickly that way you
[02:05:57] guys can see all those being handed out
[02:05:59] to you
[02:06:02] too yeah so that's how we Jo do our
[02:06:05] break that way everybody gets Fair kind
[02:06:07] of fair chance of getting
[02:06:09] everything it's not like where it's a
[02:06:10] dig break or something like that I don't
[02:06:12] like those ones the color ones I've just
[02:06:13] had bad luck with them personally so
[02:06:15] that's literally the reason why it's not
[02:06:17] that they're bad thing I just have had
[02:06:19] bad luck with them so I try to uh do
[02:06:22] things that I get bad luck with
[02:06:32] regularly yes and I show you everything
[02:06:34] after it's done correct I show you
[02:06:35] everything after it's done and that is
[02:06:37] correct you will always see that after
[02:06:40] it's
[02:06:41] done that is 100% correct
[02:06:44] there we show you everything you got
[02:06:47] after
[02:06:50] yep always get to see what you get
[02:06:53] that's one of the things I like to do is
[02:06:54] being extremely visible so everybody can
[02:06:56] see everything they're
[02:06:58] getting yeah no problem ax Hunter yeah
[02:07:02] like I try to do it so it's it's like
[02:07:04] for instance last break everybody's name
[02:07:06] all right so for instance the last break
[02:07:08] everybody's name was written down on one
[02:07:10] of the cards here we happen to have
[02:07:11] Power Rangers ones that I used and we
[02:07:13] literally put them down like this and
[02:07:15] then I handed everybody's stuff out in
[02:07:16] the order that they were there based on
[02:07:19] the shuffling up of all the cards from
[02:07:21] the break and then as you can see here
[02:07:22] over here there's all the commons and
[02:07:24] uncommons I'll be doing that in a little
[02:07:25] bit here you know what I actually might
[02:07:28] just do that now while this break is
[02:07:30] starting is being run here actually
[02:07:31] that's a good idea I'mma do that right
[02:07:34] now I'mma do that right now here is our
[02:07:38] break for today this is what we're going
[02:07:40] to do there's the
[02:07:42] giveaway right there I'm G put this
[02:07:44] right here I'm going to take this right
[02:07:47] here and put it off to the
[02:07:49] side that way
[02:07:52] you guys can see
[02:07:56] it those was the giveaway things right
[02:07:58] there as
[02:08:01] needed yep and then this is what I'm
[02:08:03] going to end up doing then going take
[02:08:06] this one this cool guy was number
[02:08:10] one woss was
[02:08:14] two Solja was
[02:08:18] three number four was Ben
[02:08:22] then five and six was our friend here
[02:08:26] jtunes so that's everything that was out
[02:08:29] there and they he got two of them at the
[02:08:30] end there so now what I'll do is just
[02:08:32] this so you take these like so and this
[02:08:36] is how we do
[02:08:37] it and you all these normally do it at
[02:08:40] the end of the stream but might as well
[02:08:41] do it right now since we're waiting on

[02:12:08] it ready to be packaged
[02:12:09] up
[02:12:11] um at right at the end of the stream
[02:12:13] rather than having to do the uh the end
[02:12:15] that stream that I do in the afternoon
[02:12:17] there like yeah that's not actually a
[02:12:19] bad idea get allows me get stuff done a
[02:12:21] little bit more rather than having to

[03:16:07] right weaker so weaker is down for a
[03:16:09] game we need that means we need uh we
[03:16:11] need at least two more people so we can
[03:16:14] play a game if we can get um seven total
[03:16:18] that want to play Commander I'll
[03:16:19] actually make it a little mini
[03:16:21] tournament and what I'll end up doing is
[03:16:23] um with the mini tournament I'll have um

[03:16:30] shipped out to them in whatever their
[03:16:31] next shipment is they get here you know

[03:16:40] from work and that's Eastern Time by the
[03:16:41] way just so you are aware that is

[03:17:04] for you guys but nice one
[03:17:09] beef be

[00:05:09] that is going to get you uh this is
[00:05:10] going to get you two I'm going to say
[00:05:11] today we're going to start out that with
[00:05:13] two for the moment so that's three
[00:05:14] strength now you get to pick your
[00:05:16] character I'm going to throw your
[00:05:17] characters at the top here all right now
[00:05:19] what we do
[00:05:21] is we um we do our little game here now
[00:05:24] I got to take my glasses off cuz I'm old
[00:05:26] and I need to actually be able to see
[00:05:28] the cards and I realize that recently
[00:05:29] that the reason why I have a hard time
[00:05:31] reading and I get them wrong all the
[00:05:32] time is cuz I'm actually not seeing them
[00:05:35] correctly so you have 78 78 and 12 for
[00:05:39] the blue uh you let me know where you
[00:05:42] want to go or I can pick them randomly
[00:05:43] for
[00:05:45] you you going be a mutant wandering
[00:05:48] through the way mutant come on why is
[00:05:51] this not
[00:05:57] touching hold on a second
[00:06:00] [Music]
[00:06:02] mutant wandering through the Wasteland
[00:06:05] we're going to do random for them all
[00:06:06] all right sounds good random for them
[00:06:08] all going to go here we go let's see
[00:06:11] what we get here random I do random I
[00:06:13] like to kind of like shake out and see
[00:06:15] what was the last one that stands
[00:06:16] sometimes it's the front one sometimes
[00:06:17] the back one sometimes it's a treasure
[00:06:20] no good no good that mutant goes
[00:06:23] wandering and he picks up a treasure and
[00:06:24] he goes oh look at this but it ends up
[00:06:26] being booby trapped Oh my he blows off
[00:06:29] three of his fingers now he's wandering
[00:06:31] around the East land with only four
[00:06:33] fingers left on his hand going oh my I
[00:06:34] have a hard time grasping
[00:06:38] things whatever who cares he's a mutant
[00:06:41] he's a mutant that doesn't matter if the
[00:06:42] math doesn't work out you are now only
[00:06:44] at two strength as you wander through
[00:06:46] the Wasteland all right buddy hopefully
[00:06:48] we can find something that will help you
[00:06:50] on the way here let's see if we can get
[00:06:52] something that'll help you along the way
[00:06:54] here H oh oh come on let's get something
[00:06:56] come on one one one one card one card
[00:06:59] come on one one card oh come on there's
[00:07:01] two there we go one card there you go
[00:07:04] let's see what we get here we got a clue
[00:07:08] for a mutant I
[00:07:12] do not think clue helps I think clue is
[00:07:15] confusing the clue is very confusing he
[00:07:18] comes out he picks this thing up he goes
[00:07:19] like I don't understand this now I have
[00:07:21] a headache and I'm wandering through the
[00:07:22] Wasteland with only one strength that's
[00:07:24] no good it's no good but you know what
[00:07:27] maybe we get lucky and we find a friend
[00:07:29] or a comp companion along the way do you
[00:07:30] want to pick here there are only 12
[00:07:32] cards you can pick this one here I'm
[00:07:33] going to take a second to shuffle them
[00:07:34] up cuz I always take a second to shuffle
[00:07:36] these up
[00:07:41] anyways and then we have the boss you go
[00:07:44] up against which is 10 cards all right

[00:07:54] stick with them all random let's
[00:07:58] see we got a warrior oh no that is an
[00:08:02] enemy for the mutant the enemy comes up
[00:08:05] they swing their sword at that Warrior
[00:08:08] the enemy swing sword swing the enemy
[00:08:09] swings its sword the enemy Warrior
[00:08:11] swings its sword wow I had a hard time
[00:08:14] getting that one out had the mutant that
[00:08:15] drops him down oh my wandering around
[00:08:17] with zero strength least he is not dead
[00:08:20] he's having a hard time wandering
[00:08:22] through that
[00:08:23] Wasteland and you know what though let's
[00:08:25] see what happens maybe he does not get
[00:08:27] beat completely by a boss I'm sorry ice
[00:08:28] cream man this morning we don't have any
[00:08:30] luck in the game for you but let's see
[00:08:34] what boss you go up against here cuz you
[00:08:35] did say random for everything we're
[00:08:36] going to go through it quickly that
[00:08:38] one's sticking out going to go with that
[00:08:41] one there we go and let's see what
[00:08:43] happens here hopefully we run into boss
[00:08:44] cuz as you're wanding through that
[00:08:45] Wasteland you see a vault you go towards
[00:08:47] that Vault and out pops oh no the T-Rex
[00:08:51] pops out he grabs you by your other good
[00:08:53] arm starts flinging you around but
[00:08:56] luckily when he drags you and drops you
[00:08:57] off you're right next to that Vault you
[00:08:59] saw
[00:09:00] you crawl into that Vault armless and
[00:09:02] you see in the distance a little uh safe
[00:09:06] you open that safe with your teeth and
[00:09:07] you pull out this cool pack of Desert
[00:09:11] Storm from 1991 I guess someone thought
[00:09:13] that needed to be in there to be safe
[00:09:16] and protected as a uh end of the world

[00:47:52] there we do still have our um the only
[00:47:54] reason I haven't redone the big blue
[00:47:56] book is because because the ceiling is
[00:47:58] still in there what I plan on doing here

[00:48:02] spots
[00:48:04] today I'm going to start taking out

[00:48:09] it's going to go down a spot instead of
[00:48:11] instead of having a blank one we're
[00:48:12] going to go down a spot to see what we
[00:48:14] can get for our cards that's what I'm
[00:48:16] going to do from now on until we can get
[00:48:18] done with this book and you can get you
[00:48:20] can take a second there to figure it out

[00:49:51] options of car packs and I'm actually
[00:49:54] going to remove the blank spot now

[00:50:00] anymore there we
[00:50:03] go
[00:50:10] there do
[00:50:12] that all
[00:50:17] right okay and then with a blank spot
[00:50:21] you're going to get all right this is
[00:50:21] what you get you
[00:50:25] get
[00:50:31] a choice of things my friend because
[00:50:35] we're just like I said we're out of it

[00:51:10] normally take the other things out give
[00:51:12] you different options I normally have a
[00:51:14] lot more options but sadly I'm down a

[01:23:09] at the end here now there are 10 bosses
[01:23:11] starting out with what you start out
[01:23:13] with you have the potential actually of
[01:23:17] beating three of the bosses and tying
[01:23:20] two others and if you beat any of the
[01:23:22] bosses there is a Loot drop for the
[01:23:25] enire Wasteland that gets to try out
[01:23:27] here we do a spin a wheel for a Loot
[01:23:28] drop here I'm going to go with this one

[01:46:17] on the adventure through the Wasteland
[01:46:19] now with that three strength you do have
[01:46:21] the potential of beating three of the
[01:46:24] bosses as you wander through the
[01:46:26] Wasteland there all right now if you
[01:46:28] ended up going say one of these days one
[01:46:29] of you guys want to jump in and try uh
[01:46:31] maybe a couple of collector boosters of
[01:46:33] Fallout then that would actually be four
[01:46:35] strength and you could potentially beat
[01:46:37] five of the bosses so where would you
[01:46:40] like to go my friend and all this stuff
[01:46:42] Isaac you're going to be a human and

[01:47:20] wandering around the Wasteland with two
[01:47:21] strength a little Dazed and Confused

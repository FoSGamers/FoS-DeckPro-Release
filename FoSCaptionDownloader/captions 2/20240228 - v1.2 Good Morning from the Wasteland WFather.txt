v1.2 Good Morning from the Wasteland! W/Father
20240228

[00:00:00] again things rolling a little bit low
[00:00:01] bagman baggin here we are I think we got
[00:00:04] this set up all right it was a little
[00:00:05] crooked the camera there Ah that's
[00:00:08] better that's better how y'all doing
[00:00:12] this
[00:00:12] morning where did my phone charger go ah
[00:00:17] I plug that baby in before I get on I
[00:00:19] had to move around yesterday and I
[00:00:21] forgot to plug the phone charger and I
[00:00:22] realized which is no good so if I don't
[00:00:25] have that plugged in it's going to die
[00:00:26] at some point and then we're going to
[00:00:27] have no video and that's going to be my
[00:00:29] fault not somebody else's fault I can't
[00:00:31] blame anybody then I gota yell at myself
[00:00:33] get all upset and whatever but anyways
[00:00:37] hey good morning Freddy how you doing
[00:00:38] bud we are uh kind of getting up and
[00:00:41] running got a little bit late at the
[00:00:44] moment H so sorry sorry there but I
[00:00:48] think we're good so I had to make an
[00:00:50] adjustment with how the game goes
[00:00:53] because we had a uh I guess the way that
[00:00:55] it was set up somebody complained that
[00:00:57] it was too close to gambling and they
[00:00:58] agreed to it I guess I don't really
[00:01:00] understand since it was a free game that
[00:01:02] you just got the cards the three packs
[00:01:04] of cards you were actually just buying
[00:01:05] three packs of cards but you were just
[00:01:06] getting a game we were playing for free
[00:01:08] after but uh I guess somebody doesn't
[00:01:11] like when they don't get something for
[00:01:12] free and they bitched about it so um now
[00:01:16] everybody when we play the uh the game
[00:01:20] it's a little bit different now I had to
[00:01:22] make an adjustment so here is how the
[00:01:26] adjustment works I'm going past that in
[00:01:32] there we go W damam that's okay that's
[00:01:35] okay it's still going to work out I
[00:01:37] found a way to round it this is no
[00:01:40] longer
[00:01:41] gambling because every single time you
[00:01:45] play the game here you get a prize given
[00:01:50] to you say thank you for playing with us
[00:01:54] all right and that we are happy that you
[00:01:55] had a great time with us and hopefully
[00:01:58] you will again in the future
[00:02:00] but what this is is we give you a little
[00:02:02] prize saying thank you and then maybe we
[00:02:04] run like a $1 uh auction after if
[00:02:09] there's a winner to say wow look at this
[00:02:10] winner maybe anybody else could be a
[00:02:11] winner too that's the way we're gonna
[00:02:13] have to do it now but so since everybody
[00:02:16] has to get a prize and it's all going to
[00:02:17] be the same prize at the end of every
[00:02:19] single one of these due to somebody
[00:02:21] complaining this is the new prize
[00:02:23] everybody gets you all get one of these
[00:02:26] when you win but afterwards I'm GNA put
[00:02:29] up a Pat for
[00:02:32] $1 that way we can get something
[00:02:36] nice what do you guys think
[00:02:39] there that was what I could think I was
[00:02:41] trying to think of a different way
[00:02:42] around it but that was the quickest
[00:02:44] thing I could think of to make a
[00:02:46] change but
[00:02:50] anyways we'll uh keep going here we'll
[00:02:54] do our things we normally do hey myel
[00:02:57] how you
[00:02:58] doing
[00:03:01] hopefully you're having a good
[00:03:03] morning we are by ourselves today just
[00:03:07] just just me here hanging out so we're
[00:03:09] GNA see if we GNA find a
[00:03:11] Mox and maybe uh maybe some
[00:03:15] Manas good how's it going not bad I had
[00:03:17] to uh I had to go and make a change to
[00:03:21] the to the uh the game a little bit so
[00:03:27] uh the carnival game so the carnival
[00:03:28] game is a little different now
[00:03:30] but that's
[00:03:32] okay with the change you guys
[00:03:35] actually um Everybody ends up having
[00:03:38] their opportunity for something right
[00:03:40] because people don't like when somebody
[00:03:41] gives something away for free and they
[00:03:42] don't get the chance to get it which
[00:03:44] makes I guess
[00:03:46] really people that complain are [ __ ]
[00:03:48] like that in my opinion I'm sorry I'm
[00:03:50] just going to throw that out there and
[00:03:50] if it loses some people that come here
[00:03:52] and follow me I'm good with that I don't
[00:03:54] want those people here in the first
[00:03:56] place but anyways heading out yeah I'm
[00:03:59] head
[00:04:00] bye love you have a good
[00:04:04] day thank
[00:04:07] you
[00:04:10] so myelle the difference that I made I
[00:04:14] had to make an adjustment if you're here
[00:04:15] and you're listening so you can play I'm
[00:04:17] going to put this up now for our pack
[00:04:19] deal for our packs for everybody this
[00:04:22] and you'll be able to play the mystery
[00:04:23] game here I mean our adventure game and
[00:04:27] then with that Adventure game we'll uh
[00:04:29] we'll maybe we'll maybe throw up a pack
[00:04:31] for a low price after if somebody wins
[00:04:34] and beats the boss year this is how
[00:04:36] we're going to have to do something now
[00:04:38] and this is what we're going to do
[00:04:41] also here we go that are those three
[00:04:44] packs with your oh that was supposed to
[00:04:45] be the adventure game and it did not go
[00:04:47] out that's okay I'll change that in a
[00:04:48] second here myel did you see um what our
[00:04:53] our new prize
[00:04:56] was do you want to see what it is if
[00:04:58] you're hanging out here
[00:05:07] we'll
[00:05:11] see really nothing show nothing showed
[00:05:15] up and B buy it
[00:05:17] now got any Kami PS and Bin no I don't
[00:05:21] have any Kami Gala packs and Bin why is
[00:05:24] that not showing by now oh there we go
[00:05:26] finally they're showing Oh I thought my
[00:05:29] St didn't show up everybody so now if
[00:05:32] everybody that plays what we're going to
[00:05:35] do to appease the um the haters that
[00:05:39] complained about whatever the issue was
[00:05:41] is uh everybody gets a prize and then at
[00:05:43] the end if there's a winner maybe I'm
[00:05:45] going to run something for like a $1 uh
[00:05:47] start here is what I'm gonna have to do
[00:05:48] it seems but what I'll do is everybody
[00:05:51] that plays the game if you happen to be
[00:05:53] winner we'll go and do maybe do one of
[00:05:54] those for uh for the crowd so say oh
[00:05:56] sweet we had a good winner and
[00:05:58] everybody's going to get one of these
[00:05:59] that plays if they want
[00:06:03] one so that's our uh that's my token so
[00:06:09] that I had to adjust the
[00:06:11] [Music]
[00:06:14] [Laughter]
[00:06:16] game so everybody gets one of those and
[00:06:18] then I run an auction for a dollar after
[00:06:21] that's what it
[00:06:22] is I had to make an adjustment so I made
[00:06:26] an
[00:06:27] adjustment like I said it might lose me
[00:06:29] couple of people that follow but if
[00:06:31] they're the ones that complain like that
[00:06:33] I'm kind of okay with it actually cuz I
[00:06:36] was doing something free when you buy
[00:06:38] packs there was literally nothing you
[00:06:41] were buying extra it was just a free
[00:06:43] game when you played buying three packs
[00:06:46] but somebody complained about it so
[00:06:48] since some people complain about free
[00:06:49] things I uh I had to make an adjustment
[00:06:52] for the free thing that was given so
[00:06:54] everybody get something free this time
[00:06:56] that's all I had to make sure everybody
[00:06:58] got something free this time I guess
[00:07:00] that's what the problem was so um this
[00:07:03] is what everybody gets for free and then
[00:07:05] we run a then we run a
[00:07:09] um an auction afterwards for a dollar
[00:07:13] everybody gets one of these for free and
[00:07:15] then an auction is run for a dollar for
[00:07:17] whatever I happen to pull out as the uh
[00:07:19] the pack of the second so we're going to
[00:07:22] put this up here and I did put that up
[00:07:24] there after that so I put it by accident
[00:07:26] I'm going to make it a change we're
[00:07:28] going to do we're gonna do this actually
[00:07:31] now I'm waiting for more stuff to come
[00:07:33] in I'm a little low on my stock
[00:07:36] sadly which stinks because I used to
[00:07:38] have more but I am a little low at the
[00:07:40] moment so we're gonna have to go through
[00:07:42] some things a little differently I'm
[00:07:44] trying to get more stuff in but it'll be
[00:07:46] in uh I think it's it said two days
[00:07:49] maybe two two days I'll get
[00:07:52] it what do you think about my um my
[00:07:54] prize now hopefully you guys uh found it
[00:07:57] as humorous as I did
[00:08:01] some I believe may have been offended
[00:08:03] I'm sorry if I offended somebody but at
[00:08:05] the same time I'm not really sorry
[00:08:07] because why did you why would somebody
[00:08:09] complain about getting a free
[00:08:11] thing I don't
[00:08:13] know
[00:08:15] whatever here we go we're GNA put these
[00:08:17] up here for y'all if you want to play
[00:08:19] the
[00:08:22] game it's cold it's cold you know it is
[00:08:26] cold it is a little bit cold
[00:08:29] it is a little bit
[00:08:32] cold well it was a little cold to be
[00:08:35] like say that you know somebody could
[00:08:36] just be like hey this is a little close
[00:08:37] to this rather than complaining to
[00:08:39] someone about it but you know hey that's
[00:08:41] what people do nowadays
[00:08:43] [Music]
[00:08:45] right but I will make a comment and the
[00:08:48] reason why I partially did this was
[00:08:51] there was um my wife happen to point out
[00:08:53] that I said hi to somebody I'm like oh
[00:08:56] hi I've never seen you here before when
[00:08:57] they happen to join In The Stream that
[00:08:59] day they happen to be somebody that is
[00:09:01] um not a friend that comes and hangs out
[00:09:04] in here regularly they are they could
[00:09:06] potentially be a competitor if you want
[00:09:07] to put it that way and then all of a
[00:09:10] sudden I had an issue that's that's also
[00:09:12] part of the reason why we did
[00:09:16] that there are Petty people in the world
[00:09:18] and sadly I may have run into
[00:09:21] one we're going to do this
[00:09:24] today we're going to do that and we're
[00:09:26] going to start this up and this is going

[00:13:56] know some of you keep bumping in and out
[00:13:58] at Adam hope you're having a good
[00:14:13] morning show we can see it it's it
[00:14:17] working it is working all right we're
[00:14:19] good sometimes I need to double check
[00:14:21] here my uh my internet connection I
[00:14:24] guess doesn't always work well I don't
[00:14:26] know I'm confused sometimes personally I
[00:14:28] haven't figured out
[00:14:30] yet but we'll find out one of these days
[00:14:32] why it doesn't work right every now and
[00:14:33] again here we go I'll put those back
[00:14:37] let's do something like
[00:14:44] this who
[00:14:47] wants to
[00:14:55] do hope you guys are having a good
[00:14:57] morning I know our it started out a
[00:15:00] little slow and Rocky kids were not
[00:15:02] listening this morning and being good so
[00:15:04] we're gonna do this actually we're going
[00:15:05] to start it out with this we'll get you
[00:15:09] two and a half strength on your
[00:15:10] adventure through the Wasteland here
[00:15:13] Jack if you want to go on a little
[00:15:16] Adventure that is we're going to do this
[00:15:20] this and
[00:15:24] that we're going to go
[00:15:27] this
[00:15:29] here why is it not going when I
[00:15:35] click I'm going to do
[00:15:38] that and I'm G to run this one here
[00:15:40] though I'm gonna run this one for a
[00:15:42] couple minutes because I'm going to open
[00:15:45] up something from our family box to see
[00:15:48] if I get any luck let's see oh there it
[00:15:52] is so I buy a box every now and again
[00:15:55] for our family this always stays off to
[00:15:58] the side
[00:15:59] no one has picked anything from the left
[00:16:01] side for some reason out of here my son
[00:16:03] did pick out a good pack Charlie picked
[00:16:05] out a good pack the other day yesterday
[00:16:07] so maybe there's something good on the
[00:16:09] left my luck though it's not going to be
[00:16:12] and generally people say left back we go
[00:16:14] with then we get some good luck with
[00:16:15] those so we're going to see that left
[00:16:16] back scenario see if that's actually
[00:16:19] accurate if it's just me doing it or if
[00:16:23] I need to have somebody pulling it that
[00:16:25] is not me because it seems like when
[00:16:26] somebody says left back that's where
[00:16:28] they like the jewel Lotus or that thing
[00:16:30] or like a a nice poster but whenever I
[00:16:32] do something I always get like junk so
[00:16:36] we're we're testing a theory that my
[00:16:39] luck only exists when I'm doing it for
[00:16:41] someone else not for
[00:16:44] myself all right let's see if that
[00:16:46] theory is accurate right here mortal
[00:16:48] truche Dreadful as the storm book of
[00:16:51] marsel fear fire foes claim the precious
[00:16:56] grey Havens Navigator give counter of

[00:20:09] Isengard but wow I'll take party tree
[00:20:12] yes I will take party
[00:20:14] tree I don't know guys maybe and hey
[00:20:17] guys you guys can tell me what you want
[00:20:19] for your character and what you want to
[00:20:20] buy for packs they are listed at the top
[00:20:22] there um now remember that is because
[00:20:25] when you're doing the game they are go
[00:20:27] at full price if you do want to do uh
[00:20:28] just the packs where we're not doing the
[00:20:30] game where you uh don't do the extra
[00:20:33] thing here for a prize we we do also do
[00:20:37] discounts on things here so you know
[00:20:39] what since I had to change the game up
[00:20:42] actually you know what I think I'm going
[00:20:46] to make an
[00:20:51] adjustment if you know what I just
[00:20:54] realized making the adjustment of the
[00:20:56] game I have to Now do it for $1 to sell
[00:20:59] it so if I do that I'm going to make the
[00:21:01] packs actually cheaper when we put them
[00:21:03] up here because I'm thinking about that
[00:21:05] now oh what's going on right now do I
[00:21:07] have some James
[00:21:10] Dean I haven't heard him sing Oh that's
[00:21:12] B Crosby never mind I haven't heard him
[00:21:14] sing a song in decades there's like one
[00:21:18] song I remember he
[00:21:19] sing why do I have Bing Crosby
[00:21:23] on yeah
[00:21:25] whatever anyways I think I'm going to do
[00:21:27] that for now and I realized due to the
[00:21:31] adjustment the game may be
[00:21:33] cheaper oh no oh look at that oh look at
[00:21:39] that so this is what we're going to do
[00:21:43] here I like that thinking about that I
[00:21:46] figured that out now not bad we're gonna
[00:21:49] do this we're going to start this and
[00:21:50] we'll do I just put that back there oh
[00:21:54] it's supposed to be this one we're going
[00:21:56] to do this going to start out with two
[00:21:59] and a half
[00:22:00] strength and
[00:22:02] because I had to make an adjustment I'm
[00:22:05] going to do this because it'll be a
[00:22:06] little bit cheaper now ah I just
[00:22:07] realized
[00:22:09] that here we go so I can kind of do the
[00:22:12] pack deals I think with the game
[00:22:15] now believe I might be able to do the
[00:22:18] pack deal with the
[00:22:19] game
[00:22:21] now H I might be able to do that give me
[00:22:24] a sec here I'm just going to do a little
[00:22:26] bit of math
[00:22:31] I think I
[00:22:33] can all right well hopefully it works
[00:22:36] out we'll see we'll see if it works out
[00:22:39] I think I can do that that way all
[00:22:42] right here we go everybody you're going
[00:22:45] to get these three
[00:22:47] packs they're going to start out here
[00:22:50] for
[00:22:51] you a little bit cheaper than normal
[00:22:53] give you a little dip discount because
[00:22:54] getting three at a time here now doing
[00:22:56] the game I actually realized uh because
[00:22:58] I had to make an adjustment due to some
[00:23:01] haters
[00:23:03] um I had to make an adjustment and I
[00:23:06] after that adjustment was made now I
[00:23:08] believe I can do them a little bit
[00:23:09] cheaper just due to the fact that I have
[00:23:11] to afterwards instead of doing it as you
[00:23:13] get a free pack you now get uh a prize
[00:23:17] because if you didn't win you didn't get
[00:23:18] the free pack by playing the game by
[00:23:20] playing a free game that was just a free
[00:23:21] game somebody was doing nice to play
[00:23:23] have fun with well somebody complained
[00:23:25] about it so um due to that complaint I
[00:23:27] had to make aob ment now every time you
[00:23:29] play there's always a prize that is
[00:23:30] given and then I might do something
[00:23:33] after you for everybody to see if they H
[00:23:35] can get a super a really good deal on um
[00:23:37] something at a dollar is really what it
[00:23:39] boils down to is what I now need to do
[00:23:42] which is up to you guys how this
[00:23:44] goes let's see if you want to jump in on
[00:23:48] that we can see if the group wants to uh
[00:23:51] happens here
[00:23:54] after how's everybody doing this morning
[00:23:57] got some luck for myself when we open up
[00:23:59] one of our packs out of the family box
[00:24:03] pulled out a party treat pretty happy
[00:24:05] about that that a nice little hit I'll
[00:24:08] take that in the morning and I always
[00:24:10] sleeve everything of mine up because I
[00:24:12] put them in and out of things all the
[00:24:13] time and my kids touch them and play
[00:24:14] with them I like to make sure they're
[00:24:15] protected all right not bad there nice
[00:24:18] little hit to start the
[00:24:21] morning but hey that was me maybe one of
[00:24:24] you guys will find some luck for
[00:24:26] yourself today
[00:24:29] it's up to you though if you're going to
[00:24:31] jump in and do anything let's
[00:24:33] see now remember you guys can pick your
[00:24:36] own
[00:24:38] start and remember uh if you want to
[00:24:40] pick your own start I have realized I
[00:24:42] need to make some adjustments so I'm
[00:24:44] going to take down the
[00:24:47] um don't worry about the cost at the
[00:24:50] moment because I think I need to make
[00:24:51] some adjustments now due to how the game
[00:24:53] is set up differently for and it's
[00:24:55] actually going to be cheaper that's
[00:24:56] actually really what I gos down to
[00:24:57] that's what I'm saying don't worry about
[00:24:58] the cost at the moment so here we go
[00:25:02] going to do
[00:25:03] this maybe somebody wants to see if they
[00:25:05] can pull out a full ring or something
[00:25:08] like
[00:25:10] that that'll be nice how's it going
[00:25:13] squirrel Chris Mystic how you doing
[00:25:16] buddy thanks coming in and hanging out
[00:25:18] this
[00:25:18] morning we're getting up and
[00:25:21] running having some
[00:25:23] fun now because um I had to make an
[00:25:26] adjustment to our game we are on version
[00:25:28] 1.2 of said game I have uh all of these
[00:25:34] are now uh same thing as like we used to
[00:25:36] do pack deal wise I'm actually G to end
[00:25:39] up doing those for the game now so
[00:25:41] everybody gets the same pack deal type
[00:25:43] stuff but in game
[00:25:45] version because we had a complaint and I
[00:25:48] had to make an adjustment of how it is
[00:25:49] now run everybody get surprize at the
[00:25:52] end and then maybe I do something a
[00:25:55] little special for uh if we win for uh
[00:25:57] the the crowd saying thank you for those
[00:25:59] participating and give somebody an
[00:26:01] option a potential of getting something
[00:26:02] that a dollar that's really what it
[00:26:04] blows down
[00:26:06] to so let's see if you guys uh anybody
[00:26:10] wants to jump in now this is a pretty
[00:26:13] good deal for some Murders At Carlo L of
[00:26:15] the Rings collector booster in Lost
[00:26:17] Caverns which gets you two and a half
[00:26:18] strength to potentially beat your uh
[00:26:22] beat the boss at the
[00:26:26] end
[00:26:28] any fire left in the mystery box what do
[00:26:31] you mean the mystery packs there should
[00:26:35] be let me um let me see
[00:26:45] quickly there should be
[00:26:55] uh Doctor Who
[00:26:59] wild drain which I don't have so I'm
[00:27:01] going to switch that out for um M at
[00:27:03] Carlo or uh lost Cavs of
[00:27:07] aelon
[00:27:10] um EMA there's still two of those in
[00:27:14] there there's still one collector
[00:27:17] booster of Forgotten Realms and there's
[00:27:21] one calim one which is in there which
[00:27:23] again I'll have to switch out but
[00:27:24] that'll go for a forgotten reals one
[00:27:26] because I'm trying to I'm waiting for
[00:27:28] stock stuff to come in but yeah there
[00:27:29] are still some things but it's not as
[00:27:31] packed as it as it
[00:27:35] was but here we go we are doing pack
[00:27:38] deals all the time with our version 1.2
[00:27:40] now of the game and if anybody wants to
[00:27:44] you can tell me what you want and we'll
[00:27:46] set that up things are going slow today
[00:27:49] I know had some rough days recently
[00:27:53] hoping uh hopefully we can get something
[00:27:55] um going that you guys want to find
[00:27:58] today is it maybe singles or something
[00:28:01] that you're looking for because I do
[00:28:02] have some I don't have anything new
[00:28:04] compared to what I used to
[00:28:06] have so uh not sure if you're looking
[00:28:08] for like newer ones but I do have
[00:28:12] some we have this I'll put up this will
[00:28:15] get you
[00:28:16] one oh that was supposed to be one of
[00:28:18] those two one to
[00:28:24] strength how's the game work
[00:28:30] no Crypt in the mystery booster
[00:28:32] conventions yet no so the game Chris
[00:28:34] what we do here is you have um this
[00:28:38] would start out if you see at the top it
[00:28:39] tells you how many points it would start
[00:28:40] out for your strength for your character
[00:28:42] there are four characters it's kind of
[00:28:43] like a little Adventure game through the
[00:28:44] Wasteland sorry if it um I did not
[00:28:46] explain this yet I will go over this and
[00:28:48] I'll use this one an example so say you
[00:28:50] get two strength here that would be your
[00:28:53] start out here because this is one a
[00:28:55] Premium Pack or collector booster and
[00:28:57] these are considered drafts or set
[00:28:59] boosters which are half a point or half
[00:29:01] a half a strength and what happens is
[00:29:03] you wander through the Wasteland you
[00:29:04] pick out out of these box it's a plus
[00:29:07] one or minus one for your strength say
[00:29:10] one of the four characters is a mutant
[00:29:12] you go through and you wander through
[00:29:13] you kind of looking for food hopefully
[00:29:15] you pull out one of the half and half
[00:29:17] it's a 5050 of food or treasure got
[00:29:20] unlucky here so they would have had one
[00:29:22] strength taken away leaving them with
[00:29:23] one then they would go back here and
[00:29:26] again to the next one they'd pick
[00:29:28] another one out and it's a 50/50 if they
[00:29:30] are going to get plus one minus one on
[00:29:33] their
[00:29:34] strength then it's a character or a
[00:29:37] friend that'll help along the way same
[00:29:39] similar situation plus one minus one and
[00:29:42] then finally on this one they get
[00:29:43] another plus one minus one um if they
[00:29:45] find a companion that's G to help them
[00:29:47] along the way so you can potentially get
[00:29:49] plus three or you can potentially get
[00:29:50] minus three and then what you have is
[00:29:52] you have 10 bosses and out of those you
[00:29:55] could beat this one
[00:29:59] this one if you have if you buy all the
[00:30:01] premium packs the Top Line premium
[00:30:05] packs that one if you buy the top of
[00:30:07] line ones too this one and these three
[00:30:10] are the ones you can normally beat by uh
[00:30:12] just buying in and getting your regular
[00:30:14] packs that you get there and everybody
[00:30:15] gets a prize at the end and then what we
[00:30:17] do at the end is say if somebody happens
[00:30:19] to win um because I had to make an
[00:30:21] adjustment in how the game is played
[00:30:23] everybody gets a little prize which is a
[00:30:25] little Art card that we um we had to we
[00:30:26] had to make a little r card for the
[00:30:28] haters here um so do that we everybody
[00:30:31] gets that prize and then afterwards what
[00:30:34] we do is we do a little uh uh we run a
[00:30:38] $1 start on some typ on something
[00:30:41] whether it is maybe a set pack or a
[00:30:43] collector booster is up to uh how the
[00:30:46] game
[00:30:47] goes run three mystery with the game
[00:30:50] I'll do that I can do that let's get
[00:30:53] that going one two three three mystery
[00:30:57] with our game which will get you three
[00:30:59] strength for your character along the
[00:31:01] way there all right we'll do that we'll
[00:31:04] put that at
[00:31:06] 28 for those because we are now doing
[00:31:10] the pack deals on everything whenever we
[00:31:12] do packs we do pack deals with them
[00:31:14] together because we're doing a little
[00:31:15] bit different we have to adjust how the
[00:31:18] game was so due to the adjustment I can
[00:31:21] actually do pack deals on uh on the game
[00:31:24] so I guess maybe it might be a little
[00:31:25] bit better for some I don't we'll find
[00:31:27] out maybe people will like it a little
[00:31:29] bit better that I can do the paos with
[00:31:31] the game so you now are going to get
[00:31:33] three instead of 30 we're going to put
[00:31:35] that on for 28 and then what happens is
[00:31:38] this is three strength for your
[00:31:40] character in the
[00:31:43] game just grabbing a drink here
[00:31:45] allergies are doing a lot better hey all
[00:31:48] right so I learned this from somebody
[00:31:50] that gets Rusty pipes and for those of
[00:31:52] you that know what I'm talking about you
[00:31:53] know what I'm talking about um he said
[00:31:56] to well because I was getting bloody
[00:31:57] noses really bad from allergies uh this
[00:32:00] person was told told me to
[00:32:02] take the um NEOS sporing on the end of a
[00:32:06] Q-tip and go to town up in your nose oh
[00:32:09] my God does it fix that when you have I
[00:32:12] was getting so many nose beds from like
[00:32:13] I'd sneeze because my allergies and the
[00:32:15] dry heat from being heat on in the cold
[00:32:17] and I'd just get a nose bleed that fixes
[00:32:23] it what if you had two set prizes of
[00:32:27] Victor and a loser prize will that still
[00:32:29] be considered gambling I thought so too
[00:32:33] that's what I thought also
[00:32:35] but I maybe maybe not I have't I was
[00:32:38] doing it this way right now just to be
[00:32:40] safe and that's why I have version 1.2
[00:32:43] I'm trying to figure out version 2.0
[00:32:45] that was one of my thoughts Freddy by
[00:32:47] the way all right so here we go you're
[00:32:49] gonna start out with three Mystic now
[00:32:52] you have been hanging out with us for a
[00:32:54] little while here what would you like to
[00:32:56] be for a character you know you have a
[00:32:59] mutant a technician a detective or a
[00:33:03] strong human in your adventure through
[00:33:05] the Wasteland you're going to be a
[00:33:06] detective all right Mystic as a
[00:33:09] detective wandering through the
[00:33:10] Wasteland you're looking for treasure
[00:33:12] treasure is something you can use to
[00:33:14] trade along the way and help you all
[00:33:17] right what do we want here do we want to
[00:33:19] go randomly wandering through the
[00:33:20] Wasteland picking things up and dropping
[00:33:22] them or do you have a method to your
[00:33:24] Madness Mythic random random he's random
[00:33:27] going through wasand I think I feel
[00:33:29] something on this ground as I'm walking
[00:33:31] and I'm going to pick this up what is it
[00:33:35] I think this is going to help me along
[00:33:37] the way says the detective I have
[00:33:40] something to trade for
[00:33:42] information let us see as we wander
[00:33:44] through the Wasteland with our Force
[00:33:46] strength are we going to find something

[00:37:09] can get something out of them what do we
[00:37:11] try we're g to try opening these up and
[00:37:12] see if we get that uh monoc Crypt right
[00:37:14] you
[00:37:16] said yep all right in the process of
[00:37:19] doing that because we just ran our
[00:37:20] little game here remember guys you can
[00:37:23] tell me what you want I am doing pack
[00:37:25] deals now because I do make an
[00:37:26] adjustment on how the game is played so
[00:37:29] we do do pack deals now now Mystic you
[00:37:32] get your choice of any one of these art
[00:37:35] cards with a special signature on the
[00:37:38] back because uh we had to make an
[00:37:40] adjustment to the
[00:37:41] game he drags you to the crit in the
[00:37:45] hopes of finding
[00:37:47] it there you go which one do you want to
[00:37:49] go with
[00:37:51] buddy let me know I think I've got like
[00:37:54] 10 or 12 of them

[00:37:57] and then what I'm going to do here is
[00:37:58] I'm going to put something else on we're
[00:38:00] going to put this up and this is going
[00:38:01] to be
[00:38:04] two and a half strength for your
[00:38:08] character as you wander through the
[00:38:09] Wasteland and as we said before we now
[00:38:11] do all of our pack deals because of the
[00:38:13] way the Wasteland Adventure had to be
[00:38:17] adjusted so this instead of being what
[00:38:19] it normally would be at full price we're
[00:38:21] going to drop that down to this for
[00:38:24] everybody to get a nice pack deal on
[00:38:27] and I'm going to run this for a few
[00:38:28] minutes while we rip open our packs
[00:38:31] three I think three minutes should be
[00:38:32] enough me pick all right we're going to
[00:38:34] do another random one we're gonna go
[00:38:36] like this gonna go like this I'm gonna
[00:38:38] just pick the top one I'm kind of
[00:38:39] looking over at you guys instead of
[00:38:41] seeing what's going on even though the
[00:38:42] screen there we're going with the top
[00:38:44] one is this all right let's see my art
[00:38:46] card you'll get it later all right
[00:38:48] you'll get the art card later we had to
[00:38:50] make an adjustment do you want to see
[00:38:52] the art card
[00:38:54] now you want to see it now
[00:38:57] I can show you now but that's what you

[00:39:57] put a little Art card for everyone at
[00:39:59] the end now let's get you something else
[00:40:01] sweet though here we go we get pack
[00:40:06] deals and we play our adventure game for
[00:40:07] maybe the chance of running something at

[00:40:35] oh nice little Sapphire charm and a ton
[00:40:39] Sky Summoner and then a start fire
[00:40:43] interesting I thought serated arrows was
[00:40:45] nice but Sapphire charm's pretty good
[00:40:47] too if I remember nice hit there I'll
[00:40:50] get that in a top loader for you that
[00:40:52] way um I think that's a few and you know
[00:40:54] the reason why we do this for those that
[00:40:56] don't we do it so it keeps everything
[00:40:57] stiffer during transport we don't like
[00:41:00] floppy things that get bent we don't
[00:41:02] like floppy bent things but this right
[00:41:04] now is your pack deal that you get to do
[00:41:06] in play of the adventure Wasteland with
[00:41:09] so so stiff we might it we yes we
[00:41:11] definitely like it
[00:41:13] stuff here we
[00:41:15] go this is our pack where we get
[00:41:19] our Mana sky March aspirant I don't know
[00:41:22] we're going to try right battle Mastery
[00:41:25] wind Drake you were dragged down oh you
[00:41:27] were dragged down to it so maybe we'll
[00:41:29] see Monique weight of the underworld oh
[00:41:33] tendrils of the cor
[00:41:35] corruption impact remers battle Rampart
[00:41:39] Glade Watcher Dawn's reflection cathari

[00:41:46] heart crenelated
[00:41:49] wall or is that a grant
[00:41:52] G I think that's C crenelated wall
[00:41:56] interesting wall there fadora
[00:41:59] savior little calf beast and a growth
[00:42:02] charm for your token I have not seen
[00:42:05] that one before interesting card there
[00:42:08] we did not get your MAA I'm sorry buddy
[00:42:11] but we do want to keep that alrazy nice
[00:42:14] and protected so what I'm going to do
[00:42:16] here is I'm going to put our little
[00:42:18] fador fadar in with it and then we'll
[00:42:21] get these in top loaders for
[00:42:24] you and we'll get everything put away
[00:42:27] and thank you there's your uh your R
[00:42:29] card for saying thank you for playing
[00:42:31] even though you didn't
[00:42:33] win and uh no one wanted this for our
[00:42:35] pack deal so guys remember you can tell
[00:42:37] me what you want and I'll get you
[00:42:39] something up there it's up to you what
[00:42:42] you want now and I will do a pack deal
[00:42:44] on all of them because um I had to make
[00:42:46] an adjustment to the game to do pack
[00:42:49] deals for everyone because there was a
[00:42:53] complaint I guess somebody did not like
[00:42:55] the fact that that when they when there
[00:42:57] was a free game they didn't
[00:43:00] win they didn't have the chance of
[00:43:01] getting something for free completely
[00:43:03] every time so uh I made sure you now get
[00:43:06] something free every time and I'm gonna
[00:43:09] I have this is version 1.2 this was a
[00:43:11] quick adjustment so that I could try to
[00:43:13] get through the
[00:43:15] day highest strength you could get would
[00:43:18] be actually
[00:43:20] one would be one and a
[00:43:23] half
[00:43:25] times three so
[00:43:29] four yeah yeah the highest strength you
[00:43:31] get would be up to five right now uh it
[00:43:34] used to be six but I am out of double
[00:43:37] Masters I am getting some Commander
[00:43:41] Masters in so I was debating I was gonna
[00:43:44] put Commander Masters as being worth two
[00:43:46] also they should be in
[00:43:50] on Thursday 29th I think that's what
[00:43:53] Thursday is so at the moment it's only
[00:43:56] one and a half is the highest you could
[00:43:57] do is with these uh with these ones
[00:43:59] sorry with these ones are one and a half
[00:44:01] not the Lord of the Rings special
[00:44:02] edition the Lord of the Rings original
[00:44:04] are the one and a half and that's where
[00:44:07] we are
[00:44:08] there there is always one right yes
[00:44:11] there is always one hey wazer how you
[00:44:14] doing so yeah so but right now what this
[00:44:16] would start you out with is one two
[00:44:19] three strength because each of these are
[00:44:21] half but we're doing pack deals now with
[00:44:24] our adventure because we have uh
[00:44:26] somebody did not like how the um the
[00:44:29] adventure was that that I guess that the
[00:44:32] fact that I did not give something away
[00:44:34] to
[00:44:34] everyone even though it was a free game
[00:44:37] just for buying cards and so we could
[00:44:40] play and have some fun but it's okay
[00:44:42] someone didn't like it so we do pack
[00:44:44] deals now for everything this is all
[00:44:46] pack deal wise so you all get a pack
[00:44:49] deal on this this is going to start out
[00:44:51] at here we
[00:44:54] go then that here so I can get
[00:44:57] everything put away not bad I had to
[00:45:00] make an adjustment as youd heard so
[00:45:01] everybody now gets one of these when you
[00:45:03] ever play the adventure game with this
[00:45:04] is sort our buddy uh Mystic but there is
[00:45:07] an AR card here that has something on
[00:45:09] the back of it that's a a little a
[00:45:12] little art drawn by myself for the
[00:45:16] haters a little art drawn by myself for
[00:45:18] the haters um and then you will what you
[00:45:22] do next is say a person happens to win
[00:45:25] and comes out on top we'll run an
[00:45:27] auction now for a dollar and that's how
[00:45:29] I'm doing it today I'm trying to think
[00:45:30] of a version uh a version 2.0 way of
[00:45:34] doing this um I I kind of have an idea
[00:45:37] and Freddy said the same thing that I
[00:45:39] was thinking which is maybe if I can do
[00:45:41] a prize for everyone but maybe the uh
[00:45:45] the top prize there's one top prize and
[00:45:47] one low prize so we're trying to figure
[00:45:49] out our ways but this is my quick
[00:45:51] resolution for the day at the
[00:45:53] moment so this may be a one time card
[00:45:56] actually that no one gets after today
[00:45:59] also so this may be like a special
[00:46:02] edition Art card from uh from the um
[00:46:05] from the fos Gamers that no one's ever
[00:46:07] going to get ever in the history of uh
[00:46:10] fos Gamers other than
[00:46:12] potentially this time frame we'll see I
[00:46:16] think that could be what it is so I'm
[00:46:18] I'm I'm I'm bet I'm betting that these
[00:46:20] are special edition art cards that no
[00:46:22] one's ever going to get
[00:46:23] again quite frankly
[00:46:26] yeah I know woot woot right man how's
[00:46:29] your day going you you starting it off
[00:46:31] good I see you say great getting any

[00:47:21] doing pack deals today and maybe
[00:47:23] sometime at some point somebody will be

[00:55:56] for saying thank you for playing I know
[00:55:57] you didn't win and the boss Beat you you
[00:55:59] get any of these and there's a little
[00:56:01] something for the haters on the back
[00:56:02] here of the AR cards here something
[00:56:05] drawn by me Shandra all right we'll give
[00:56:08] you Shandra there there you go and on
[00:56:12] the back of that a little something for
[00:56:13] the haters that complained about the way
[00:56:15] the game was before I made an adjustment
[00:56:17] we are in version 21.2 right now I plan
[00:56:20] on doing a 2.0 where it's a little bit
[00:56:22] different but I had to make a quick
[00:56:23] adjustment so the could
[00:56:27] go I did not draw this no the back of
[00:56:30] this the back of it is what I drew I
[00:56:32] told everybody on the back of this is
[00:56:34] what I draw my art is not this good my
[00:56:37] art is very bad those that are if you
[00:56:40] really need to see should I show
[00:56:42] everybody what's on the back do you
[00:56:44] really should I should you see my
[00:56:45] horrible drawing on the back it's just
[00:56:48] something for the haters that complained
[00:56:49] about my game I have to I had to make an
[00:56:52] adjustment a quick adjustment so that we
[00:56:54] could do the game so this literally is
[00:56:55] probably a one day a one day special
[00:57:00] token for those that are in the game
[00:57:04] this one day because I had to make a
[00:57:05] quick adjustment so I could figure
[00:57:07] something out and this was my quick
[00:57:09] adjustment everybody wins and comes
[00:57:13] away with a token for the
[00:57:17] haters and that's what everybody gets
[00:57:20] for a token for the
[00:57:21] haters but if we
[00:57:25] I have I had to make a quick adjustment
[00:57:27] I couldn't figure out what to do
[00:57:29] instantly and it was like I got this
[00:57:31] thing and I had to make a quick
[00:57:32] adjustment in like a day so I was like
[00:57:35] you know what everybody wins this and if
[00:57:36] somebody beats the boss what I'm gonna
[00:57:38] do is I'm gonna run an auction for a
[00:57:40] dollar for one of the items instead of
[00:57:42] giving it away like I was planning on it
[00:57:44] so so that was my that was my that was
[00:57:47] my uh my thought process there so
[00:57:50] anyways you're G to get these packs
[00:57:52] ripped open our buddy slipping but
[00:57:55] that's that was my quick adjustment I
[00:57:57] had to think this is probably a what
[00:57:59] literally whoever gets these today will
[00:58:01] probably this these art cards will never
[00:58:03] be seen again most likely these will
[00:58:06] most likely never be seen again because
[00:58:08] I had to make an adjustment quickly just
[00:58:10] to get to the day and that is it Haters
[00:58:13] Gonna Hate exactly and uh yeah so that
[00:58:16] that was that that was it so we're now
[00:58:19] going to rip these open guys and we're
[00:58:21] going to see what we get here for our
[00:58:22] buddy slipping right slipping wanted me
[00:58:24] to rip I'm pretty sure I need to take a
[00:58:26] drink
[00:58:30] quickly all right yeah here we go and
[00:58:33] what I'm gonna do is I'm G to put on up
[00:58:35] on on something up here for those that
[00:58:37] may want it remember
[00:58:39] guys everything is now on we do pack
[00:58:42] deals with them all just because we had
[00:58:45] some hater haters complaining so
[00:58:47] everything does have a pack deal right
[00:58:49] now um I'm going to do this here I was
[00:58:52] doing a free game and somebody didn't
[00:58:54] like my free game so um I have to make a
[00:58:58] quick adjustment just a one day quick
[00:59:00] adjustment like I said we'll probably
[00:59:02] never be here again like this but hey I
[00:59:04] had to do something quickly so I could
[00:59:06] keep going on here for you
[00:59:08] guys so my quick adjustment was that and
[00:59:12] this is what I'm going to do right now
[00:59:13] I'm G to put this on and we're going to
[00:59:14] rip this open and we're going to see

[01:11:57] of there because he's pulled he's gotten

[01:12:29] played and doing that we made an
[01:12:33] adjustment so everybody gets a prize
[01:12:35] this is version 1.2 version 2.0 should

[01:15:50] these These are not my drawings my my
[01:15:53] drawings are not those my drawings are
[01:15:55] on the back of these is what I'm trying
[01:15:56] to say my drawings are utterly and
[01:15:58] horribly pathetic I'm not an artist I
[01:16:01] had to do something quick to be able to
[01:16:03] keep playing the game because there was
[01:16:04] a complaint about my free game that
[01:16:07] people don't like free stuff that there
[01:16:09] was a complaint about it oh my pure
[01:16:14] art oh yeah some of those art ones are
[01:16:17] nice my art is definitely really good my
[01:16:20] art if you've seen my art yes my art is

[01:16:59] some cool things to say thank you to you
[01:17:01] guys for coming and hanging out with us
[01:17:02] on a regular basis but I don't know what
[01:17:04] I did with them all
[01:17:07] now oh my art is awesome my art is
[01:17:11] awesome thank you buddy I do appreciate
[01:17:13] that I uh I do draw some things the kids
[01:17:15] do too we have some fun with it it's the
[01:17:18] whole reason we do the show and the
[01:17:20] whole reason we started doing the live
[01:17:22] is because my oldest said he wanted open
[01:17:25] packs online and I was like all right
[01:17:27] let's have some fun and do it I don't
[01:17:29] care and I realized I cannot afford to
[01:17:32] do that that doing that shit's
[01:17:34] expensive so I uh he found something he
[01:17:37] found whatnot somehow found somebody
[01:17:39] streaming one point oh no probably
[01:17:41] Raider saw something to confuse you
[01:17:44] that's all right if I'm confused I get
[01:17:45] confused all the time very easily so he
[01:17:47] decided he wanted he found this and was
[01:17:49] like Hey look at this thing people sell
[01:17:51] them no it was Patron people selling
[01:17:54] them he saw he's like can we do that so
[01:17:56] I looked in the patron a little bit I'm
[01:17:57] like I can't build that up myself I
[01:17:59] don't have enough you still need to have
[01:18:00] some money and some ways to do that then
[01:18:02] I happen to come across this and I was
[01:18:04] like you know what this seems intriguing
[01:18:06] let me try this out for a little bit so
[01:18:08] I sold some of the things that I already
[01:18:09] had you know I was like you know what
[01:18:11] people liked what we were doing so we
[01:18:13] kept doing it and now we do this on a
[01:18:14] regular basis try to have fun with
[01:18:16] everyone just have a good time that's
[01:18:19] really what it is these are your four
[01:18:22] packs you get one
[01:18:24] two three strength for your Adventurer
[01:18:28] along the
[01:18:29] way and we have uh little bank they are
[01:18:32] and at the end if you happen to
[01:18:36] beat the boss at the end we're going to
[01:18:40] run a $1 auction for those for everybody
[01:18:43] that's in here and we'll do it on
[01:18:44] something uh maybe it will be a
[01:18:46] collector booster maybe it'll be a Seth
[01:18:47] booster I don't know but I am planning
[01:18:49] on doing one of those anyways because
[01:18:51] we've played the game a couple times a
[01:18:52] day
[01:18:54] I am going to do a $1 auction at some
[01:18:55] point randomly today to start something
[01:18:57] off just to say thank you for everybody
[01:18:59] playing the game and we're going to do
[01:19:01] one of those we're g start it out at
[01:19:02] probably one of the collector booster
[01:19:05] packs thank you Raider thank you Raider
[01:19:08] I try to do things to be nice and have
[01:19:09] fun really that's the whole point of
[01:19:11] what we were doing like my kids wanted
[01:19:14] to have fun and play a
[01:19:15] game and I I have a hard time saying I
[01:19:19] will admit I have a hard time saying no
[01:19:21] to my kids because they're cute and
[01:19:24] they're generally good generally good
[01:19:27] I'm gonna say generally at least in
[01:19:29] public in public they make themselves
[01:19:31] look excellent I will say that so I
[01:19:34] can't complain too
[01:19:38] much so here we go I appreciate that but
[01:19:41] here we go what we're gonna do now is
[01:19:43] I'm gonna put this up for a pack
[01:19:47] deal this pack deal for
[01:19:49] everybody is going to go on for
[01:19:54] this here that's a good deal for those
[01:19:56] three that's one two and a half strength
[01:19:59] if you want to do the adventure through
[01:20:00] the Wasteland you guys don't need to do
[01:20:02] the adventure through the Wasteland it's
[01:20:03] your choice if you want to but that's to
[01:20:06] start your adventure through the
[01:20:07] Wasteland and I think what I'm gonna
[01:20:12] do I think I actually if no one ends up
[01:20:15] buying the murders here I think at the
[01:20:18] at some point I'm going to start this
[01:20:19] off at a $1 auction here I think I might
[01:20:22] do that at some point and see if you
[01:20:24] guys are interested in this pack we're
[01:20:25] going to see if we can get one more
[01:20:26] person to play the adventure game and I
[01:20:28] think that's what I might do I think I
[01:20:31] might do that if one more person's
[01:20:32] playing the adventure
[01:20:34] game we'll try that out there let's see
[01:20:37] if you guys are interested we'll
[01:20:40] see and then maybe uh I don't generally
[01:20:43] do giveaways because I don't like to do
[01:20:45] things like that like people come in all
[01:20:47] the time and then I get like 50 people
[01:20:49] watching it goes down to two so I don't
[01:20:51] like doing that the adventure game all
[01:20:54] right the adventure game we'll explain
[01:20:56] this one a little bit here so what you
[01:20:58] do in this adventure game you have
[01:21:01] you're wandering through the Wasteland
[01:21:02] and what happens it's kind of little uh
[01:21:04] you get plus you're you pick a character
[01:21:06] one of four characters technician a
[01:21:09] mutant a detective or like a strong
[01:21:12] human they all have their pluses and
[01:21:15] minuses when you look in the show notes
[01:21:16] they explains you what the pluses and
[01:21:17] minuses for their strength or um
[01:21:20] something taking away from them for a
[01:21:21] harm and now you pull one from each one
[01:21:24] of these boxes this is a 50/50 that is a
[01:21:27] 50/50 for those first plus or minus and
[01:21:30] then this one is a 2575 for a plus or
[01:21:32] minus for a companion and what happens
[01:21:35] is at the end depending on what you have
[01:21:37] for strength you could potentially beat
[01:21:39] the Velociraptor
[01:21:42] Miri or Owen Grady if you started out
[01:21:45] with say that amount you got over three
[01:21:47] strength you could beat them and if you
[01:21:50] beat the boss you uh everybody would
[01:21:52] plays Everybody Plays right now because
[01:21:54] this is version 1.2 I'm trying to figure
[01:21:56] out some Kinks but I had to get it
[01:21:57] running everybody gets one of my art
[01:22:00] cards that is has on the back of these
[01:22:01] art cards I have a special drawing just
[01:22:04] for today that I had to figure out
[01:22:06] something to do everybody gets one of
[01:22:08] these but if somebody happens to beat
[01:22:10] the boss at the end you end up having a
[01:22:13] $1 auction that's run but what anyway
[01:22:16] since we have three of them that are
[01:22:17] going I'm going to end up doing a $1
[01:22:18] auction anyways at the end of it if
[01:22:20] somebody plays the adventure game but we
[01:22:22] want to get people jumping in and paying
[01:22:24] attention and watching and having some
[01:22:25] fun and remember you can at the top it
[01:22:27] tells you exactly what you get at the
[01:22:31] top of the game there and how many
[01:22:32] points it is per each piece now the
[01:22:35] prices you can kind of ignore the prices
[01:22:37] a little bit because I am doing pack
[01:22:39] deals and I will be updating all that
[01:22:42] stuff there inste and making some
[01:22:43] changes for tomorrow's
[01:22:45] show but in the meantime that is what's
[01:22:50] there so let's say this we'll do this
[01:22:52] we're going to start out with
[01:22:53] two strength with your character as he
[01:22:57] wanders through the Wasteland
[01:23:01] here then you're going to
[01:23:03] see here for a little pack
[01:23:09] deal this is now a little bit of a
[01:23:11] discount for you guys and there we go
[01:23:15] $23 you get one two strength starting or
[01:23:18] you can just rip the packs open and say
[01:23:20] I don't want it I don't care
[01:23:23] youself little pack deal or you can play
[01:23:26] the adventure game for $23 starting out
[01:23:29] with two strength and then what I'm
[01:23:31] going to do after is I'm going to run a
[01:23:32] little uh I think I'm gonna run an
[01:23:34] auction starting off at a dollar here at
[01:23:35] some point for one of uh for that
[01:23:37] Collective booster in the background but
[01:23:39] we see if somebody wants to do our
[01:23:41] little Adventure game
[01:23:43] here I understand
[01:23:48] that why Raider why don't know why new
[01:23:52] people don't follow me what's wrong with
[01:23:55] that did I do something wrong or are you
[01:23:57] telling that new people don't F that
[01:23:59] there are new people that are not
[01:24:00] following
[01:24:03] me you spend too much money on Magic
[01:24:05] everybody spends too much money on Magic
[01:24:08] it's one of those things I think that
[01:24:09] there was the the best thing that I
[01:24:10] heard is it's better to spend money on
[01:24:13] Magic than
[01:24:17] drugs that's what it
[01:24:19] is I think that I think it's somebody
[01:24:22] said at least I'm spending money on
[01:24:23] Magic and not
[01:24:27] drugs what's been the best
[01:24:30] poll oh don't forget to follow oh thank
[01:24:32] you Raider better than alcohol too
[01:24:35] that's right what's been the best Poll
[01:24:37] for what

[01:36:21] thanks for coming in hanging out I'm
[01:36:23] going to have some more things we'll
[01:36:26] have up here in the future I do have
[01:36:27] some more stuff coming in just uh taking
[01:36:30] a little bit time I thought I had hit
[01:36:32] enter and on the order and it never
[01:36:35] actually had hit enter on the order so
[01:36:36] it never actually ordered that was
[01:36:38] completely my fault I'm like why have I
[01:36:40] not gotten my stuff I was about to get
[01:36:42] really mad and I go oh [ __ ] I did I did
[01:36:45] not complete the order oh that sucks
[01:36:48] well anyways we're gonna start with
[01:36:49] these four packs here you know what
[01:36:50] actually we're going to do these three
[01:36:52] packs instead two strength two strength
[01:36:55] for your
[01:37:01] Adventurer two strength for your
[01:37:04] Adventurer and you're going to start out
[01:37:06] at this pretty good deal and if we can
[01:37:09] get three more people to do the
[01:37:12] adventure if we have three more people
[01:37:14] that lose we'll do another $1 start but
[01:37:18] if we um have a winner we're going to do
[01:37:20] a nice one start for maybe uh maybe
[01:37:24] we'll do it for one of the Lord of the
[01:37:25] Rings or something like that I don't
[01:37:26] know it's up to you guys if you want
[01:37:29] these pack deals Wasteland Adventure all
[01:37:32] right the Wasteland Adventure I'm gonna
[01:37:34] give this as an example you would start
[01:37:37] out with a character choice you would
[01:37:39] pick one of four characters technician
[01:37:42] mutant a strong human or a detective and
[01:37:47] they all have plus or minus if you look
[01:37:48] in the show notes it explains it all a
[01:37:50] little bit uh the whole game so you
[01:37:52] would start out with this one with one
[01:37:55] two points because this is worth one
[01:37:57] point and each of these are worth half
[01:37:58] for strength and you wander through the
[01:38:00] Wasteland and as you wander through
[01:38:02] these boxes here are plus or minus one
[01:38:05] 50/50 chance plus or minus one 5050
[01:38:08] chance and then a plus or minus one 25
[01:38:11] 75 chance and then what this is is you
[01:38:13] wander through the Wasteland and you
[01:38:15] pull out cards and you see if you can
[01:38:18] get enough strength to come and beat the
[01:38:21] boss is at the end where you could
[01:38:22] potentially beat the
[01:38:23] Velociraptor maybe
[01:38:25] Mei or Owen Grady now if you decided to
[01:38:29] go with different packs in this and say
[01:38:31] you went with three Lord of the Rings or
[01:38:34] maybe four Lord of the Rings because you
[01:38:36] wanted to try to really get up there as
[01:38:37] being one and a half for those ones you
[01:38:40] could actually potentially beat the
[01:38:43] T-Rex or the incinerator also giving you
[01:38:47] a 5050 chance of doing a$1 run there and
[01:38:51] then what happens is everybody always
[01:38:54] this is version 1.2 I had to think of a
[01:38:56] quick Solution on version 1.2 I'm trying
[01:38:59] to figure out a different way these may
[01:39:01] be only a one day thing here where there
[01:39:03] is uh some AR cards that I drew on the
[01:39:05] back of some drawings on the back um
[01:39:08] that are the prizes and then what
[01:39:10] happens is everybody gets one of these
[01:39:12] you pick whichever one you want and then
[01:39:14] we want a run dollar auction after
[01:39:17] depending on what you win if what one
[01:39:20] you beat it happens to be a collector
[01:39:22] booster or a Seth booster or something
[01:39:24] like that and that's what we
[01:39:26] do in our Wasteland Adventure previously
[01:39:30] the Wasteland Adventure was uh you just
[01:39:32] buy your packs like we do here and then
[01:39:35] um it was a free game that you paid
[01:39:38] played you didn't pay for it it was just
[01:39:39] a game that you played free when you
[01:39:40] bought packs and I allowed people to
[01:39:42] play where you could win an extra pack
[01:39:44] for free just by playing the game and
[01:39:46] saying you wanted to but someone
[01:39:48] complained about it so I had to make a
[01:39:50] change quick quickly and do this that's
[01:39:52] what we're at but either way you always
[01:39:54] get your packs that you buy those are
[01:39:57] never taken those are always given to
[01:39:59] you so there you go that is our
[01:40:01] Wasteland
[01:40:02] Adventure if you want to jump in on it
[01:40:05] that
[01:40:06] is and I just do random packs right now
[01:40:10] because you guys can also pick out what
[01:40:12] you want at the end here you don't need
[01:40:14] me to pick him out you can always tell
[01:40:16] me what you want because it says at the
[01:40:17] top what everything is worth for points
[01:40:20] and I can doing these for pack deals
[01:40:22] here for those that want them and today
[01:40:23] is uh a little bit of a slow day here
[01:40:25] but you know Wednesdays Tuesdays
[01:40:27] Wednesdays generally are people are uh
[01:40:31] generally had always gone big over the
[01:40:33] weekend and they're waiting for their
[01:40:35] packages to
[01:40:37] show because I know I've done that
[01:40:39] before so we're going to do this here
[01:40:41] for
[01:40:44] 23 for a little deal for you guys if you
[01:40:47] want it for these three packs and that's
[01:40:48] one two strength to start your adventure
[01:40:50] with
[01:40:53] I'm only here for about 10 20 minutes
[01:40:55] longer before I have to go off to start
[01:40:56] work
[01:40:59] today we'll see what happens if you're
[01:41:02] interested in these
[01:41:04] things but anyways this is what we're
[01:41:07] doing
[01:41:09] here maybe oh I have a better
[01:41:13] idea we're gonna do something
[01:41:19] here
[01:41:26] there there I think that makes it a
[01:41:28] little bit bigger so you can see better
[01:41:30] there we
[01:41:34] go there we are that way you can see
[01:41:38] everything a little bit
[01:41:40] better there you go those are what you
[01:41:43] get for your points if you want to pick
[01:41:45] your own packs now I may not have all
[01:41:48] those I need to update that but um
[01:41:51] that's what we had that's what I had

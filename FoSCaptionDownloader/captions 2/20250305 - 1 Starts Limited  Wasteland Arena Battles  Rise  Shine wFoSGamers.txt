[01:08:29] nasty he has acid spray with a one in
[01:08:33] four chance of doing an area effect
[01:08:36] damage so even if it misses you from
[01:08:37] dodging it might still hit one 2 3 4
[01:08:40] five 6 7 eight 1 2 3 4 five 6 7 eight so
[01:08:46] you uh yes yeps you have a large acid
[01:08:49] spitting bug in front of you ather
[01:08:52] jacket run over streaking oil gorger
[01:08:56] midnight Mangler daring mechanic castal

[01:09:06] uncommon ra road rage alaken Armory I
[01:09:11] think I'm saying that right Draco natics
[01:09:13] engineer nice one on that I like that
[01:09:16] rare then we have a bounce off foil
[01:09:18] scored Barons and your pilot
[01:09:21] token the so you have to decide yeep
[01:09:27] are you going to uh run away from this
[01:09:28] guy now this time you going have to roll
[01:09:30] cuz they do have an area effect to make
[01:09:31] sure you can get
[01:09:33] away but do you want to try to run away
[01:09:37] or you want to attack this
[01:09:41] one
[01:09:43] pogs pogs yeah right here yeah we don't
[01:09:47] need the pogs right now he has to fight
[01:09:48] and do something yeah yes they got to
[01:09:51] decide come on do something come on yeps
[01:09:55] come
[01:09:56] on come on do
[01:10:02] something yes you cannot your dodging
[01:10:06] skills drop a little bit so uh instead
[01:10:09] of being a 50/50 you're now at like uh
[01:10:11] you have to roll a 13 or
[01:10:17] higher so you can't move as
[01:10:19] quick is really what it boils down to so
[01:10:23] like say for instance
[01:10:25] you decide yeep you going to use your uh
[01:10:30] where is it you're going to use your
[01:10:32] pistol or your axe or something like
[01:10:34] that or your assault rifle and it might
[01:10:37] not work if you got well you might not
[01:10:39] be moving as quick if they do say they
[01:10:41] go to move quick you might not be able
[01:10:42] to hit them but you can try who's up
[01:10:44] next we're going to do this here we're
[01:10:48] getting around to some of our other ones
[01:10:49] we're going do this here plus uh you
[01:10:51] know what we'll throw
[01:10:55] easy this play booster uh bulk pack in
[01:10:59] there for you guys and you get one of
[01:11:01] these
[01:11:02] potentially going to swing your axe at
[01:11:04] them I like it that's a plus five so
[01:11:07] your you go up from your plus five
[01:11:10] you're going to put that up there so we
[01:11:11] can roll now you have to hit that large
[01:11:14] bug so that ends up being you have to
[01:11:15] have 12 or higher to hit them you're
[01:11:18] going to swing with your axe to see what
[01:11:20] happens again well that's nice you hit
[01:11:24] them
[01:11:25] with
[01:11:27] 19 for full
[01:11:30] hit wow you're so off balance you just
[01:11:33] swing wildly at that large bug when it's
[01:11:35] in front of
[01:11:37] you and you hit it large bug does not
[01:11:40] like it you got lucky on that one you
[01:11:43] got lucky my
[01:11:44] friend and then Fallout 44 I'll get you
[01:11:48] right here in a second next thing we do

[01:11:56] miss wait a minute no you have your
[01:12:00] minus for me
[01:12:01] ah had to be a 13 or higher be I mean
[01:12:05] because minus three you have for your
[01:12:07] your attack ability to dodge so they hit
[01:12:10] you dang it but they hit you
[01:12:14] for not a full hit a nearby hit so we're
[01:12:18] going to take one of these which one

[01:38:49] leave you my axe if I Mo can you modify
[01:38:52] my axe if I leave it to you
[01:38:54] the pistol would be worth um 15 15 pogs
[01:38:58] for the
[01:38:59] pistol
[01:39:01] ammo cuz I thought he already sold the
[01:39:03] pistol no he sold the rifle
[01:39:06] oh it would
[01:39:09] be it's going to be 20 I was going to
[01:39:11] say to modify it but if you want to give
[01:39:15] a come back
[01:39:17] later and bring me another
[01:39:21] weapon I'll do it for 15 if you come
[01:39:23] back later and bring me another
[01:39:26] weapon that means you got to get another
[01:39:29] weapon you do not have the knife I think
[01:39:33] you traded that
[01:39:37] already I deleted it from there so I'm
[01:39:41] guessing you traded
[01:39:43] it so your choice is my friend oh you
[01:39:46] got this Eeps
[01:39:50] too all right on to the next pack there
[01:39:54] that we're going to get going put this
[01:39:57] here let's see what we have exactly in
[01:39:59] here
[01:40:00] left there is an Infinity
[01:40:07] draft yes a foundation play booster so
[01:40:10] I'm able to return without need a key
[01:40:13] duskborn uh dmu
[01:40:20] draft dmu draft
[01:40:23] no they are going to modify it
[01:40:29] now another one all right those are the
[01:40:32] last packs that are left in
[01:40:35] there those are the last ones that are
[01:40:37] left
[01:40:38] there no you can't return without
[01:40:40] needing key so this time you're going to
[01:40:41] pay for the
[01:40:43] modification and you it's like a one
[01:40:45] time use of uh your location there so
[01:40:48] this is the seven packs that are left

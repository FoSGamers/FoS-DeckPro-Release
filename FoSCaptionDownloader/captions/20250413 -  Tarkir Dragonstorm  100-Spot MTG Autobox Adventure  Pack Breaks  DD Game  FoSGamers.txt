[00:00:01] We're
[00:00:03] on. Yes, we're starting
[00:00:07] here. Ah, it's been
[00:00:11] a tiring
[00:00:13] day. I'll say that. Wimpy hot dog. I
[00:00:16] like that. Demander, thank you for
[00:00:19] coming in. How's it going
[00:00:21] everyone? Hopefully you're having a good
[00:00:23] uh Saturday. Here we have Oh no. What
[00:00:28] did I do with that?
[00:00:29] Uh-oh. So, I'm tired and I'm sore
[00:00:33] because of working and
[00:00:35] then there was a a storm that came
[00:00:38] through last
[00:00:39] night. It was like almost 40 mph winds
[00:00:43] on a boat.
[00:00:51] So, I had
[00:00:56] my tablet over in bed so that when I
[00:01:00] wanted to check the wind, we could. That
[00:01:04] was pretty crazy. All the We were l
[00:01:06] luckily because we were working on the
[00:01:07] boat getting the arch put on, which I
[00:01:10] got to go fix in a little while
[00:01:13] here. I'm still very tired and I need to
[00:01:16] actually have a good breakfast today cuz
[00:01:18] yesterday we got called before I was
[00:01:20] able to eat.
[00:01:22] I got I think that's part of my reason
[00:01:24] why I'm so
[00:01:25] tired. Uh oh. Stay there. Go in. We like
[00:01:29] it. Those are my uh dragon storm that we
[00:01:33] got. Maybe there's something you guys
[00:01:35] like. But we'll uh we're hanging out
[00:01:37] here. We'll do some adventuring today
[00:01:39] again as we always do here. I don't
[00:01:42] know. It was a weird thing that was like
[00:01:43] a like a game quick thing trying to
[00:01:45] figure out something fun for her to do
[00:01:48] and it
[00:01:49] morphed into this crazy thing that we've
[00:01:52] been doing
[00:01:54] recently. Chacha, how's it going?
[00:01:56] Haven't seen you in a while. Garlic,
[00:01:59] thanks for coming and hanging
[00:02:03] out. All
[00:02:06] righty. Hopefully you're all having a
[00:02:08] good uh what? Oh, not me. Good uh
[00:02:14] Saturday. I think this is Saturday. I
[00:02:16] don't even know what day it is. Oh, no.
[00:02:18] Yes, it's Saturday. All right, there we
[00:02:21] go. She told me yes. I think we got
[00:02:22] everything's working. Yep. All right,
[00:02:25] we're kind of wandering around. Big BK
[00:02:27] was doing some things. Others were in
[00:02:29] the area kind of going to help, but uh
[00:02:33] guys were all brought
[00:02:36] back back to
[00:02:39] uh the vault where the portal was that
[00:02:42] that where you had the hot uh dragon
[00:02:44] that was found in the cave. You got all
[00:02:48] slain.
[00:02:49] But yeah, uh anyways, we'll uh see if
[00:02:53] anybody wants to hang out this
[00:02:55] morning. I'm tired anyways. It was a
[00:02:58] long day yesterday. We got the arch put
[00:03:01] together.
[00:03:02] Uh it's hanging on the boat. It's not on
[00:03:06] the
[00:03:06] boat. Should have been on the
[00:03:09] boat. Hey Dylan, how you
[00:03:17] doing? No, only the ones for you, Dylan.
[00:03:21] There's only a couple people that do
[00:03:23] that that I do that for. Daniel Barry,
[00:03:26] sports highlights. Oh, hey. How's it
[00:03:28] going? Good morning, my friend. Yeah.
[00:03:31] And it's actually a special
[00:03:32] request. Um, and uh and and you have to
[00:03:36] you have to be a member a member of this
[00:03:38] specific group. So, you got to find the
[00:03:41] member to become it. It's a hidden one.
[00:03:43] I can't tell you how to find it, though.
[00:03:45] You probably know. Hey there. How's it
[00:03:48] going? Yeah, you can. You should be able
[00:03:50] to online. There's um right in the link
[00:03:54] um in the description. You should be
[00:03:54] able to do it.
[00:04:00] There are some packs. If you'd like, you
[00:04:02] can go check those out online. They they
[00:04:04] should be there on the on the web page.
[00:04:06] I don't know. Uh should be have it in
[00:04:08] the link there and where the notes
[00:04:13] are. Oh no, I forgot to do something.
[00:04:17] Why is it so small? That's not what I
[00:04:20] wanted to do. Again, my
[00:04:23] computer's doing things that I don't
[00:04:25] want it to do because I'm clicking on it
[00:04:26] in places my fingers are telling it
[00:04:28] to. See, that's what I half the time I
[00:04:31] love when people like, I didn't do it.
[00:04:32] Like, no, you
[00:04:34] did. You just are lying to yourself that
[00:04:36] you didn't. Even though you're uh you
[00:04:39] know you
[00:04:43] didn't. All righty. I had to put it in
[00:04:46] the right category. That was what my
[00:04:48] problem
[00:04:49] was. There we go. We got in the right
[00:04:51] category now. Hey, how's it
[00:05:00] going? There's a lot of singles. I told
[00:05:03] you I have over a thousand singles that
[00:05:05] I put in there. All the all the ones
[00:05:06] that we kind of put used to put in our
[00:05:08] games and other things like that. We've
[00:05:09] been starting to put them in there.
[00:05:10] People want them. They want them.
[00:05:13] I'm actually starting I was my somebody
[00:05:15] said I should start putting even their
[00:05:17] lower ones in but like have them as like
[00:05:18] four packs and so that you kind got so
[00:05:21] people come buy like four of like a you
[00:05:22] know like you know it's a 10-centent
[00:05:24] card or like you know 25 cent card well
[00:05:26] four of those a dollar that's not a bad
[00:05:28] idea I have a bunch of bulk stuff
[00:05:30] because we open things for ourselves
[00:05:31] that we keep so might as well right but
[00:05:36] yes you can definitely go and check that
[00:05:38] stuff out
[00:05:41] everyone you should be will get the link
[00:05:43] there cuz if I put it in the chat, for
[00:05:45] whatever reason, it never shows up for
[00:05:46] you guys to be able to click
[00:05:49] on. Put some duels in the
[00:05:52] uh in in the uh 1,00
[00:05:56] items. Yes, there are some duels in
[00:05:59] there. There are.
[00:06:08] Oh, no you didn't.
[00:06:16] Come
[00:06:18] on.
[00:06:29] A big
[00:06:31] BK. I almost didn't wake up this
[00:06:33] morning.
[00:06:36] I rolled over and I was like I sat up
[00:06:38] and I go, "Uh oh, no. Oh,
[00:06:43] ow." And I laid right back down. We
[00:06:46] worked on 9.
[00:06:50] Oh,
[00:06:52] yeah. What?
[00:06:55] Yeah. It was like 8:00. 7 o' 7 or 8. We
[00:06:57] were at work until dark. So, long story
[00:07:00] short, it should have been on way before
[00:07:03] then. It should have been on probably
[00:07:04] around 2.
[00:07:07] Yeah, around 2:00 it should have been
[00:07:08] done is when we put the holes in, right?
[00:07:11] Probably about 3. Yeah. So 2 3:00 I
[00:07:14] should have been done. Well, one of um
[00:07:17] you have to put this uh
[00:07:22] um resin on them on the pegs that go in
[00:07:25] the hole
[00:07:29] for taking the hole. Sorry. Ah, damn
[00:07:35] it.
[00:07:40] What? And my uh So, anyways, the uh the
[00:07:44] resin on one of them when we set
[00:07:46] everything down, we got everything set
[00:07:48] flat, had it all together where it was
[00:07:49] supposed to be, but it must have uh we
[00:07:52] must have when one of them must not set
[00:07:53] exactly right because it lifted up like
[00:07:55] this
[00:07:56] much. So being that like eighth of an
[00:07:59] inch, well that eighth of an inch at the
[00:08:01] other end of like the uh the uh 14 ft
[00:08:05] that it's at is not an eighth of an inch
[00:08:08] cuz you know math, right? You know, it's
[00:08:10] like
[00:08:11] this. So it um one of the well now the
[00:08:15] other side is not on on uh not right.
[00:08:18] So uh what we're trying to do is I had
[00:08:21] to go buy a blowtorrch last night
[00:08:22] because I was trying to figure out why
[00:08:24] this is all of a sudden so off. Well,
[00:08:27] it's because one of them didn't set
[00:08:29] fully when we uh went to go to the next
[00:08:31] one. Not shocks. No, no. I'm talking
[00:08:34] about um we had a uh we're building a
[00:08:36] solar we were putting together a solar
[00:08:38] arch for the boat. Pretty much just
[00:08:39] together and you have to put um epoxy
[00:08:42] not Yeah. No, a resin on uh like the the
[00:08:45] legs for them to get them to stick in uh
[00:08:48] to stay there and then you put like a
[00:08:49] couple eyebolts in to hold them in place
[00:08:51] things. And
[00:08:53] um when we put them all
[00:08:55] together, you have to let them set for a
[00:08:58] while. One of them must have slid out a
[00:09:00] little bit. And I mean like when I mean
[00:09:02] a little bit, I mean like that much. But
[00:09:04] like I said, over
[00:09:05] over 14 ft, that much becomes that much
[00:09:09] because of
[00:09:10] math, you know, and uh now it's a little
[00:09:14] off. So I have to get I buy a blow. I
[00:09:17] was trying to figure out how to fix it
[00:09:18] yesterday. We're trying to bend it
[00:09:19] differently and get it to work. No, it
[00:09:21] didn't work. So, I went and bought a
[00:09:23] blowtorrch. Tried that. But, it was
[00:09:25] getting dark and cold. So, it was not
[00:09:27] holding the heat well. So, I had to try
[00:09:29] it more when it's warmer in the day so
[00:09:32] that the heat will stay on inside the
[00:09:35] pipe to melt the resin so that I can
[00:09:38] have a rebar stuck through the peg where
[00:09:41] the hole
[00:09:43] is. I did it
[00:09:47] again. The rebar. See? And then uh have
[00:09:50] a like a
[00:09:52] comealong even better uh ratchet strap.
[00:09:56] The same thing that pulls it uh pulls it
[00:09:58] in and tightens that up so that we can
[00:10:01] have it in place actually instead of
[00:10:03] that little bit down. It'll suck back in
[00:10:05] to that amount. That's my freaking
[00:10:07] problem I've been dealing
[00:10:10] with. I have one of them left, Lil. Um I
[00:10:15] could do something like that. Uh hold on
[00:10:17] a second.
[00:10:20] By your math, I'm packing 13 in 13 ft. I
[00:10:24] like
[00:10:29] it.
[00:10:31] Oh, thank you. Well, you know what I
[00:10:34] mean,
[00:10:35] Mystic. I mean, you are the uh you this
[00:10:38] is you. So, I mean, it could be it's
[00:10:41] possible. We don't know what's below the
[00:10:43] belt there cuz it's cut off.
[00:10:46] No, you could be a mutated
[00:10:51] [Music]
[00:10:52] rolling around on
[00:10:54] [Laughter]
[00:11:01] tentacles. Yeah, I could do I could do
[00:11:03] that. I have a whole box left. Uh, let
[00:11:05] me know what you'd like to do though.
[00:11:06] Um, and I can figure that out for you.
[00:11:08] He has flying boots.
[00:11:11] What was that? He has flying boots.
[00:11:14] He has flying
[00:11:16] [Laughter]
[00:11:21] boots. That's funny. Now, did you want
[00:11:24] me to open up the whole box for
[00:11:26] you? My leg. My leg is like sore. All my
[00:11:30] body parts are sore. I didn't know I had
[00:11:33] some body parts that are sore. Well, I
[00:11:36] did know I had them, but they haven't
[00:11:37] been sore since I was young and like
[00:11:39] exercising and doing manual labor and I
[00:11:40] was in
[00:11:42] shape. Well, see, I'm not not in shape.
[00:11:45] It's just I almost died a few years back
[00:11:47] and I lost all ounce of endurance that I
[00:11:49] had because I went from like 190 pounds.
[00:11:52] I was in good shape muscle and then I
[00:11:55] went down to like 137 pounds cuz some
[00:11:57] medical [Â __Â ] happened and I like
[00:12:00] literally almost died. My organs were
[00:12:01] shutting down, I guess. And uh so I lost
[00:12:06] all my endurance and strength. I gained
[00:12:08] some of the strength back, but the
[00:12:09] endurance is just not there yet. And I
[00:12:10] don't think it's going to come back. I'm
[00:12:12] 40 now.
[00:12:13] That took me years to uh to bring up
[00:12:15] from a
[00:12:17] kid. Yeah. All right. Give me a second.
[00:12:20] Um here. Sorry, I was I was looking. I
[00:12:22] got
[00:12:23] sidetracked when I was looking.
[00:13:05] Yeah, there There we go. Or do I have it
[00:13:07] there? Just going to take a second. I
[00:13:09] don't generally put them on that amount.
[00:13:11] So, uh trying to figure out a deal for
[00:13:14] you that I can do. That's what I'm
[00:13:17] trying to do. Cuz you're going to if you
[00:13:18] guys get a bunch of stuff, that helps me
[00:13:20] with the um shipping and all that. So, I
[00:13:24] don't have to worry about doing paying
[00:13:25] that amount for everybody going in there
[00:13:27] for all the fees and those type of
[00:13:28] things. So, I I can give a bit of a
[00:13:31] deal. And that's what I'm trying to
[00:13:31] figure out for them. make sure I get it
[00:13:34] right is what I'm trying to do because
[00:13:38] that helps me not have to worry about
[00:13:40] things when it comes with like I said
[00:13:41] there's like every time I had do
[00:13:43] something a shipping fee
[00:14:20] How is
[00:14:24] uh
[00:14:27] 3 365 and there's instead of what it is
[00:14:32] now be 3.84 at all of them now if
[00:14:35] somebody's buying them separately. How
[00:14:36] was 365 for a pack? Oh, the whole box.
[00:14:39] See, that's what you
[00:14:41] [Music]
[00:14:46] like. Oh, what? In the morning or
[00:14:48] yesterday? I'm sorry,
[00:14:52] buddy. Yeah, I can't I Yeah, I um we had
[00:14:55] some problems here that were unexpected.
[00:15:00] I am uh I am You can do that. All right.
[00:15:03] Let me um give me a second here to make
[00:15:05] an
[00:15:07] adjustment to some
[00:15:13] things.
[00:15:15] Okay, I'm going to go to products, make
[00:15:18] an adjustment, and I'll get that in
[00:15:19] there for
[00:15:23] you.
[00:15:30] Here we go.
[00:15:34] [Music]
[00:15:53] Okay. Go. Just trying to make the
[00:15:56] adjustment. Yeah.
[00:16:00] [Music]
[00:16:03] So, it's in there
[00:16:11] correctly. I don't want to have too many
[00:16:13] in
[00:16:14] there and somebody else go and buy a
[00:16:16] bunch after. So I just need to make
[00:16:18] adjust right. That's
[00:16:21] all. Okay. So that is
[00:16:25] there. And then I'm going to do this
[00:16:28] once I see it
[00:16:31] saved. Here we
[00:16:35] go. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry about the
[00:16:38] eagle. I told you you need you needed to

[00:16:46] and I was giving you I was saying you
[00:16:47] need to do this. I said it even like two
[00:16:50] or three
[00:16:51] times. All right, here we go. I'm going

[00:17:33] just want It's sad that they didn't make
[00:17:35] as much uh so many collector boxes, but
[00:17:37] you know, makes it uh you know, it does
[00:17:39] make it like unique for everybody to

[00:18:37] times. My brain does not pick things up
[00:18:40] quickly because well, it's part of the
[00:18:42] problem is I'm not going to lie, Steph.
[00:18:44] I'm old and it's hard to see from that

[00:23:35] for that was already epoxied in place or
[00:23:39] um resin was on it put in place kind of
[00:23:43] slid out about that amount. So by the
[00:23:45] time it got the other side of 14 ft, it
[00:23:47] was like that much and it was really
[00:23:48] off. And now I have to I had to go buy a

[00:25:34] frankly, we did not get the best of
[00:25:35] boxes that we taken. We got one of the
[00:25:38] probably the worst boxes I've ever
[00:25:39] actually picked out. Normally, we get
[00:25:40] pretty good luck. So, I think I grabbed
[00:25:41] like the bad box out of everything for
[00:25:43] all you guys. So, you guys get the good
[00:25:45] ones. Nice pickup on the lands and those

[00:27:43] them are like 10 plus 15 bucks almost. I
[00:27:47] know. They just look so cool. I think
[00:27:49] they did a very good job on
[00:27:52] those. Some of the few times in my life
[00:27:54] that I can uh I can say when I look at
[00:27:58] them like the first time I looked at I
[00:27:59] was like, "Wow, that's nice." And like
[00:28:01] when it comes to some of the cars, every
[00:28:02] now and again, most of the cars like,
[00:28:03] "Oh, that's cool. That's cool." I'm
[00:28:03] like, "Oh." When I first saw that one,
[00:28:05] I'm like, "I like that. Did a good job
[00:28:07] with it." All right, we're open this
[00:28:08] pack here. I'm going to take a drink of
[00:28:09] coffee though quickly so I can
[00:28:11] uh not fall asleep on
[00:28:16] you. Yeah, we had a storm roll through
[00:28:18] last
[00:28:20] night and uh it wasn't supposed to be
[00:28:24] here. Well, get your coffee going. It
[00:28:27] was rough for anybody out in the harbor
[00:28:28] here that was uh was anchored where we
[00:28:30] were literally going to be anchored if
[00:28:32] the put it this way. Maybe something
[00:28:34] happened and we weren't anchored for a
[00:28:36] reason because last night a storm rolled
[00:28:39] through and the high winds hit like 35
[00:28:41] to 37 miles an hour. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8.
[00:28:48] Now the sustained winds were like 25 to
[00:28:51] 30 the entire time this like 45 minute
[00:28:55] storm rolled through. We were luckily on
[00:28:57] the dock because the arch wasn't put on
[00:29:01] yet because of the issue we're having.
[00:29:03] So, I'm like, "Wow, maybe that was like
[00:29:04] a blessing in disguise now after that
[00:29:06] storm rolled through cuz seeing like 15
[00:29:08] boats rolling around, half of them
[00:29:10] dragging, I was like, "All right, I'm
[00:29:12] happy I'm on the dock." Sagu Wildling

[00:30:03] reason. Nice pickoff. That's the first
[00:30:06] time I've actually even seen that card.
[00:30:09] So, that's a nice one there. I'm going
[00:30:10] to put that in with your other one so
[00:30:11] they don't We like to do this so things
[00:30:13] don't slide around during
[00:30:15] shipping. It makes it like instead of
[00:30:17] like taping them down and stuff, it uses
[00:30:19] physics. You just give it a little tap.
[00:30:22] They're both in sleeves. They don't
[00:30:23] touch and they stay together and then
[00:30:25] physics hold them together.
[00:30:29] Yay,
[00:30:32] science. But uh yeah, so the people when
[00:30:35] we were putting the the top on the uh
[00:30:37] when we're getting the
[00:30:39] uh together our our arch putting on the
[00:30:42] boat and everything, these guys the
[00:30:43] couple guys came down and we had a we
[00:30:44] were going to pay they were going to pay
[00:30:45] for time to help for like a couple hours
[00:30:47] potentially. I'm like I don't know if
[00:30:48] we're going to need that long. I need
[00:30:49] pretty much brought down to the boat so
[00:30:50] I can put on the boat and set up so that
[00:30:52] I can get all hooked up to everything.
[00:30:53] He's like, all right, sure. Then he came
[00:30:55] over and uh saw me hook it up like put
[00:30:59] it on to our um top line. Then I put it
[00:31:01] on to another line that was pulled out
[00:31:03] so it stayed away from my boat that was
[00:31:05] pulled out and around a cleat on the
[00:31:06] dock. Then I had it tied to the other
[00:31:08] side of the boat where we were able to
[00:31:10] walk around to the other side of the
[00:31:11] boat and I was able to pull it over and
[00:31:13] around things and he was like, "Huh?"
[00:31:15] Like I can see like afterwards I'm like,
[00:31:16] "All right, we're good." because I tied
[00:31:17] it to my boat, tied it down to the
[00:31:19] cleats on the other one, tied one to the
[00:31:21] cleat, tied another one over, and it was
[00:31:23] hanging there and it was like not going
[00:31:24] anywhere. It's like, look at that. Got a
[00:31:27] little bit of math in there. I didn't
[00:31:29] think I remembered geometry that much. I
[00:31:31] guess I
[00:31:35] did. But here we go. Let's see some
[00:31:37] more. One, two, three, four, five, six,
[00:31:42] seven, and eight. Here we go. We like

[00:33:46] a god box, right? With all what's in
[00:33:47] here. What's the rarest card in Magic?

[00:45:00] all of them that I got and it was meant
[00:45:02] for you. I guess definitely wasn't meant
[00:45:05] for me because we opened our box and got

[00:47:26] we like to get in at least one of these.
[00:47:27] He opened the whole box. Yeah, he got
[00:47:29] the whole box and he got some the
[00:47:31] greatest luck I've seen in a long time.
[00:47:39] Definitely good
[00:47:40] pickup. Definitely good pickups,
[00:47:44] dude. You're very welcome. I'm happy I
[00:47:46] was able to I'm happy I was able to even
[00:47:48] open that. You know what I mean?
[00:47:52] You know, it's one of those ones where
[00:47:53] like I get to participate in the fun
[00:47:55] there. Thank you for allowing me to
[00:47:56] participate in that fun. You have some
[00:47:57] good luck. We're getting these all put
[00:48:00] into the sleeves here. I'm going get
[00:48:01] some of them put in a top loader. if any
[00:48:02] of the other ones you need me to put in
[00:48:03] top loaders because they're either ones
[00:48:05] you like or ones you know are like near
[00:48:07] 10 bucks or more. We'll get those into
[00:48:09] top loaders. But as I'm going through
[00:48:16] here, it is it is and this set is one of
[00:48:19] the ones that it's like a this is a nice
[00:48:20] one. I just like I had bought 12 boxes
[00:48:23] and uh from and for some reason I only
[00:48:26] got five and that was my biggest that
[00:48:29] was my biggest upset for with this set
[00:48:31] here. I I I should have had 12 boxes to
[00:48:34] go through but um I don't know what
[00:48:37] happened. I was not allowed to get them
[00:48:39] anymore. Um so did you get any? No, I I
[00:48:42] didn't have to pay for them um because
[00:48:44] they they I just ordered them and they
[00:48:46] don't they give me the a lotment based
[00:48:48] off what they get. Um, and they never
[00:48:51] get less than it generally on a standard
[00:48:52] set. Sometimes on like the uh special
[00:48:54] sets or Universal Beyond, I don't always
[00:48:56] get the same amount, but this was the
[00:48:58] first time on like a standard set like
[00:49:00] this. But I guess it was a highly
[00:49:02] soughta set, so I was only able to get a
[00:49:04] little
[00:49:05] bit
[00:49:10] sadly. We got shorted hard. Ordered 200
[00:49:14] boxes, got 120. That sucks. See, that's
[00:49:16] what I was guessing is stores were
[00:49:18] getting shorted. See? Well, the reason
[00:49:19] why I say that is because my um my local
[00:49:22] game store that I go to here in the
[00:49:24] area, um he he didn't even have
[00:49:26] pre-release stuff. Like, he might have
[00:49:28] it this weekend, and I was going to try
[00:49:30] to go maybe tomorrow and do two-headed
[00:49:32] stuff, but I don't know if we can
[00:49:34] depending on how things go. I don't even
[00:49:35] know if they got him. Yeah, he didn't
[00:49:37] get any of it. So, here's your wind
[00:49:38] crack. Yeah, nothing was delivered. You
[00:49:41] had to cancel. So, let me see. This is
[00:49:42] our This is our box here. We're going to

[00:58:11] lay on the ground where they are and I
[00:58:13] don't move them. So, she doesn't like

[00:59:09] sometimes these mean like one of these
[00:59:11] these ones are going to be the good
[00:59:11] ones, but we have a split up and even.
[00:59:14] They're even. Oh, somebody did a

[00:59:25] we'll go back. We'll see what the next
[00:59:26] three
[00:59:28] are. Someone's playing a trickery game.

[01:05:34] don't need anything that I can think of.
[01:05:35] But thank you. I just got to wait for it
[01:05:38] to warm up so we can try to warm up the
[01:05:40] pipe and get it to uh push in.
[01:05:46] Yeah. All the guys here were like, "How
[01:05:48] are you going to do this alone?" I'm
[01:05:49] like, "I I'm not doing it alone. I'm
[01:05:50] using I'm using my boat's winench so I
[01:05:55] don't need to pull that thing up and
[01:05:56] down. And I'm using um lines or ropes
[01:05:59] tied to it to keep it suspended away
[01:06:01] from it so that it can't touch anything.
[01:06:03] And I can always move it anywhere I want
[01:06:05] between the lines because if one pulls
[01:06:06] this way, it can't pull that line like
[01:06:08] that."
[01:06:09] Hey, James. What? The dog is outside
[01:06:11] tied up to the pole because he fell in
[01:06:13] the water. Oh, wonderful. Um, so
[01:06:17] that's fine. And the dog fell in the
[01:06:19] water this morning. How's it going,
[01:06:21] Aussie? Aerore. Delta blood flies. Inock
[01:06:24] Wayfair. Guess he didn't make the jump
[01:06:27] from the uh boat to the dock. Riverwalk
[01:06:29] technique. Too early. Oh, he jumped too
[01:06:31] early. Oh, okay. Coordinated maneuver.
[01:06:33] His his He was not making any

[01:07:04] measures what's up bud that's not what
[01:07:07] happened. So the dog went to go jump
[01:07:09] onto the boat. Yeah. I was holding his
[01:07:12] feet and halfway onto the boat. So you
[01:07:16] pulled the dog in the water. No, I did
[01:07:18] not pull the dog in the water. I had
[01:07:20] William, stop yelling. Stop yelling.
[01:07:22] Stop yelling. So just I want to
[01:07:24] understand this and I just need No.
[01:07:25] Nope. No. So you had the dog in the
[01:07:28] leash. He tried to jump and he didn't
[01:07:29] get the jump full because you jerked
[01:07:31] because you had him holding on. I I was
[01:07:33] holding on to him. Yep. So you were
[01:07:34] holding on to him. You jumped expecting
[01:07:35] to be able to jump and you held him back
[01:07:37] and he fell in the water. Yeah. Okay.
[01:07:39] Thank you. I didn't do it on purpose.
[01:07:40] Wait. I know you didn't do it on
[01:07:42] purpose, but God, boy. Come on. You got
[01:07:44] I did not do it on purpose. You got to
[01:07:45] pay attention, my son. So, you're saying
[01:07:47] I was supposed to let go. He was already
[01:07:49] He was If he was jumping onto the boat.
[01:07:51] Yes. You let go of him because you
[01:07:55] would have made it anyway.
[01:07:58] I'm pretty sure the dog knows what it
[01:08:00] can do compared to you knowing what the
[01:08:02] dog can do. William, just next time let
[01:08:04] go of the leash if he tries to do that
[01:08:05] so he can jump on the boat. All
[01:08:07] right. Damn. I don't know if any of you
[01:08:09] just heard that, but that is just that's
[01:08:12] a a whole bunch of silly right there.

[01:12:10] you got there, but that that was a nice
[01:12:12] uh that was a nice pack for the
[01:12:14] end. Now you got a couple nice packs
[01:12:17] there. The rest were like nice ones, but
[01:12:18] not not as good as the others. Let me
[01:12:20] get this in a top
[01:12:22] loader with um over here and get these
[01:12:26] ones. I think it was uh your Ugan that

[01:18:06] right. Big BK, good
[01:18:09] luck. Focus the mine. Mardu
[01:18:13] devote. Meticulous artisan. Absand
[01:18:16] devotey, piercing exale, unburied, earth
[01:18:20] carver, reput merchant, teeming dragon
[01:18:23] storm, defibrillating current, dragon
[01:18:26] broods relic, glacial dragon hunt,
[01:18:30] perination for your mythic there. Not
[01:18:32] bad. Piercing exhaling of foil, tranquil
[01:18:35] cove, and a soldier token. All right, so
[01:18:38] you got that. Now big BK has been
[01:18:42] wandering around in our in our wasteland
[01:18:45] here. He was dropped back off at the
[01:18:46] cave where they had um where they had
[01:18:49] found from the information from the the
[01:18:51] vault dwellers there your that they
[01:18:52] found a little bit of information that
[01:18:54] you found talking to them. And then once
[01:18:55] you got all that information there, you
[01:18:57] went and found uh and you found some of
[01:18:59] your your your codes disc are now uh
[01:19:03] making some noises, making odd noises,
[01:19:05] some of them humming, some of them
[01:19:07] glowing. You don't really understand
[01:19:08] what's going on, Big B, because you just
[01:19:11] started having that happen. And after
[01:19:16] The eagle picked you up when you tried
[01:19:19] to run to the mountain before stopping
[01:19:24] everywhere you needed to along the way
[01:19:26] to prepare and have knowledge of what
[01:19:29] you need
[01:19:34] now. Ah, go into the cave to see if the
[01:19:38] portal is open. All right, I like that
[01:19:40] idea, Big B. It's not a bad one. So, you
[01:19:44] head back over to the cave where the
[01:19:45] dragon
[01:19:46] was. All right. So, you go and uh you
[01:19:50] walk through that uh eagle's up there.
[01:19:53] Walk through that destroyed hallway
[01:19:55] getting into the cave, my friend. And as
[01:19:59] you're going through the destroyed
[01:20:00] hallway into trying to get into that
[01:20:06] cave, you're
[01:20:10] uh
[01:20:14] you sorry it's taking time to load for
[01:20:16] some reason. See this standing in a
[01:20:20] corner
[01:20:21] now. Do you want to go and look in it or
[01:20:25] you just need to leave it be and be
[01:20:26] like, you know, I I don't care about you
[01:20:27] right now.
[01:20:28] I'm I'm on a I'm on a mission.
[01:20:56] [Music]
[01:21:04] No, you
[01:21:05] didn't. Uh, no you did not. I said there
[01:21:08] was there was literally a village. I was
[01:21:11] like, there's a village here. Do you
[01:21:13] want to stop? They may have information.
[01:21:19] for
[01:21:21] you and you still were like, "No, I'm
[01:21:23] not doing
[01:21:25] that. Oh, that's what you're going to
[01:21:27] do." All right. All right. We'll see.
[01:21:28] We'll see how that goes. We'll see how
[01:21:31] that goes. All right. Let me uh get that
[01:21:35] going there. You got your buried
[01:21:36] toolbox. Are you going to open the
[01:21:37] toolbox? Uh you going to leave it be?
[01:21:39] You know, sometimes they're, you know,
[01:21:40] booby trapped. Sometimes they're not.
[01:21:43] Who knows what they are?
[01:22:01] Oh, you're going to open it. All right.
[01:22:02] Yeah, open it. Hopefully, it has a
[01:22:03] shotgun blast attached to it just so it
[01:22:05] can end
[01:22:06] you. All right. Well, we have to
[01:22:09] see. You always chose high. I think you
[01:22:12] have two luck now. So, you're now at
[01:22:14] eight or higher. So, let's see what you
[01:22:16] get. Oh, well, look at that. You got
[01:22:18] some luck, my friend. Today, your luck
[01:22:22] comes in and you find yourself while
[01:22:24] you're scavenging. These are both worth
[01:22:26] 10. And those are 14. There you go. 24
[01:22:29] pogs to add to your
[01:22:34] inventory. Keep seeing pieces of my
[01:22:36] tooth falling out that I pulled out of
[01:22:38] my
[01:22:40] mouth. Now, I got to put that in there.
[01:22:43] So, you are now at
[01:22:46] uh 241 for your
[01:22:51] Pogs. Poof. Teleported to the
[01:22:56] village. I'm sorry. That did not happen
[01:22:59] that way. No. But you go to look to see
[01:23:04] if there's something in the portal
[01:23:05] there. Uh because you want to check
[01:23:08] it. No.
[01:23:14] you uh go and what happens is when you
[01:23:16] do that, you wander in. So, I had to
[01:23:20] make the the thing that I had there
[01:23:21] because I didn't have what I
[01:23:23] wanted. And you're in the cave. You're
[01:23:25] looking at that hydra, the dragon that
[01:23:27] you had killed earlier. And you're like,
[01:23:29] "Ah, why? What happened? I don't
[01:23:32] understand. I killed you. I should have
[01:23:34] gotten the reward." But you did. You got
[01:23:36] something. You got knowledge. You got
[01:23:37] information.
[01:23:39] But you walk further back going to where
[01:23:41] you saw that portal. Portal is missing.
[01:23:44] But now there portal. It's not really
[01:23:46] missing. You kind of see the portal poof
[01:23:48] away very shortly, very
[01:23:51] quickly. But in his
[01:23:56] place, you
[01:23:58] see
[01:23:59] this and you're like,
[01:24:02] umh, Big BK, what are you going to
[01:24:07] do? Here we
[01:24:09] are. Sometimes it takes a minute to get
[01:24:12] the image in here, right? I have to
[01:24:14] easily figure out how to paste it in
[01:24:15] easier. And you wander in and you say,
[01:24:17] "Oh my, what is this uh group of baby
[01:24:19] dragons we see
[01:24:21] here?" What are you going to
[01:24:23] do? Looks like maybe something was uh
[01:24:26] came through the portal at the
[01:24:34] end. I don't know. Can you
[01:24:46] [Music]
[01:24:50] Trying to make friends with baby dragon.
[01:24:52] All right. What are you going to do,
[01:24:53] buddy? Said you're going to be friending
[01:24:54] the baby
[01:24:56] dragon. So, how are you going to
[01:24:58] befriend
[01:25:04] them? Going to build yourself your own
[01:25:06] army. Yeah, got your robot helper, the
[01:25:09] doctor
[01:25:12] ghoul. I mean, you're on the
[01:25:14] way. Feed them whiskey and marble 100s.
[01:25:17] You know
[01:25:19] what? They're dragons. They smoke all
[01:25:21] the
[01:25:23] time. But
[01:25:26] sadly, you don't have any marals. But
[01:25:30] you do have whiskey.
[01:25:36] So you go, "Hey, gota walk in with the
[01:25:40] whiskey, seeing if they'll take it. You
[01:25:43] want to try something else though other
[01:25:44] than the whiskey
[01:25:46] only?" I mean, I think you have some
[01:25:48] food that's not been uh that hasn't been
[01:25:50] done anything to it. Has been just food
[01:25:51] that you found ration. They're not
[01:25:53] rations
[01:25:54] [Music]
[01:25:55] yet. You going to use your food? All
[01:25:57] right. You're going to use your food and
[01:25:58] the whiskey. All right. So you give them
[01:26:00] some food supplies that you had found
[01:26:04] and you walk over with food supplies and
[01:26:07] whiskey in your
[01:26:08] hands. You put your weapons down behind
[01:26:10] you and you walk in holding food and
[01:26:12] whiskey like, "Hey, I have
[01:26:17] treats." Baby dragons
[01:26:21] go sitting there looking at it and then
[01:26:23] one of them, as you see, one of them
[01:26:24] pokes his head up like, "Oh, what's he
[01:26:26] doing there?"
[01:26:28] Now, this is what's gonna
[01:26:32] happen. You feed the baby
[01:26:35] dragons and we're gonna
[01:26:37] see what happens with your luck.
[01:26:41] Okay. This is what h this is where it
[01:26:43] goes, buddy. All
[01:26:48] right.
[01:26:49] Ready? Okay.
[01:26:55] So, oh, where' the dragon
[01:26:58] go? That doesn't work. I thought I was
[01:27:01] in front of it. All right, I guess you
[01:27:02] might get a roll unless you want to keep
[01:27:05] this. Oh, I was in front of the nut
[01:27:07] dice. Dang it. You have a
[01:27:10] 12 now with the 12. One of them you can
[01:27:16] befriend. If you had gotten like a 20, I
[01:27:19] was going to allow you to get two. And
[01:27:21] if you got a one, um, there's a good
[01:27:23] chance they were going to try to
[01:27:25] flee. But you got
[01:27:28] 12, so you get to pick a baby dragon
[01:27:31] that you feed. That kind of comes
[01:27:34] towards you to get the
[01:27:37] food. You'll take a dragon, friend. So,
[01:27:40] which one's going to come towards you
[01:27:41] and take the food that you're going to
[01:27:42] take? Which one? You can pick which one.
[01:27:43] You're going to let me know. You're
[01:27:44] going to name it.
[01:28:00] No. All right, we got a
[01:28:02] name. So, you find one comes
[01:28:11] forward. A lightning dragon named
[01:28:13] Spartacus. All right.
[01:28:32] [Music]
[01:28:44] Okay. All right.
[01:28:51] All right.
[01:28:52] So, this is what
[01:28:55] happens. Your uh your baby, you've been
[01:28:57] hanging out for a while. One of those
[01:28:59] baby dragons comes forwards towards
[01:29:11] you. And those baby dragon. Ah, that's
[01:29:14] not right.
[01:29:18] That was No, that's not going to
[01:29:24] work. All right, here we go. This is
[01:29:28] uh the guy that comes forward towards
[01:29:31] you, takes your
[01:29:35] food, starts nibbling on it.
[01:29:39] [Music]
[01:29:46] And give me one second so I can do get
[01:29:48] this out for it. Come
[01:29:54] on. And here it
[01:29:59] is. You're hanging out there and you go,
[01:30:01] "Oh, well." And that guy comes towards
[01:30:04] you and this is uh
[01:30:14] And here is your
[01:30:17] uh baby
[01:30:19] dragon that you
[01:30:22] find that walks toward
[01:30:25] you. Oh
[01:30:31] no. Well, Big BK, look at that. Might
[01:30:35] have a little pet.
[01:30:40] can ride on your shoulder until it gets
[01:30:41] bigger. All right. All right. We can
[01:30:43] accept that. All right. Now, I felt bad
[01:30:46] about you and your and bringing you
[01:30:48] back. So, we thought we needed to give
[01:30:49] you a little give you something for your
[01:30:51] for your efforts and all the time. You
[01:30:53] know, I I figured this would be a good
[01:30:55] reason. This was a little bit different
[01:30:58] than what you were going to do in the uh
[01:31:01] what would have happened in the small
[01:31:02] village. I made a couple minor
[01:31:04] adjustments to like kind of more
[01:31:05] location and stuff like that, but I was
[01:31:08] telling you, you need to go to the
[01:31:09] village. You do be putting in the work.
[01:31:12] I know. Now, my buddy um my buddy Lil uh
[01:31:17] Tokido and I know we went a little
[01:31:18] longer than normal with that because uh
[01:31:20] Big BK had been here earlier and um the
[01:31:24] other day he we didn't have a chance to
[01:31:25] do it take as long doing it. So, I I
[01:31:27] wanted to give him a little uh happiness
[01:31:29] back with his uh
[01:31:32] with his character because he was very
[01:31:34] upset about the eagle bringing him back
[01:31:36] to uh not the beginning but like kind of
[01:31:38] like a beginning
[01:31:49] area from the birthplace of Oh,
[01:31:53] nice. So, this seems kind of fun then,
[01:31:56] huh? You might like this look,
[01:31:59] huh? Nice.
[01:32:02] All right, then. Let me know where you
[01:32:03] want to go. We can build you a
[01:32:06] [Music]
[01:32:09] character. You do go menacing in the
[01:32:12] morning, Big
[01:32:13] BK. You definitely go and menace and
[01:32:15] make some uh make some fun times and
[01:32:19] [Music]
[01:32:24] adventuring. But that is your uh your
[01:32:27] baby dragon big BK. Let me get that put
[01:32:29] into
[01:32:31] [Music]
[01:32:42] uh here with the
[01:32:45] [Music]
[01:32:54] players. There we go.
[01:32:58] Big BK's baby
[01:33:00] [Music]
[01:33:02] dragon. Do front right Pat. All right,
[01:33:05] front right it
[01:33:06] [Music]
[01:33:08] is. Oh, we're going to have to do a new
[01:33:10] image with a baby dragon on your
[01:33:11] shoulder. All right, we can work on
[01:33:13] that. Now, little
[01:33:14] Tokido, I'm going to give you uh you
[01:33:16] jumped in big with this. So, I'm going
[01:33:17] to give you some opportunities to uh
[01:33:19] pick out some things for your character
[01:33:21] if you want to do some adventuring in
[01:33:22] the wasteland yourself. We can we can
[01:33:23] design what your character looks like.
[01:33:25] And then we can also uh we'll get you
[01:33:28] some stuff here to start out with. 1 2 3
[01:33:30] 4 5 6 7 8 lot. So we'll get you some
[01:33:35] options of uh some weapons and maybe um
[01:33:38] maybe some other things like that. Get
[01:33:39] you running in the
[01:33:41] adventure. That is if you want to. We
[01:33:44] have a J sky shrine
[01:33:46] keeper, lion weight, hardened tactician,
[01:33:51] nomad outpost, jade cast, sentinel,
[01:33:54] storm shriek, feral, ringing strike
[01:33:58] mastery. I always say for the costic
[01:34:03] exale, encroaching dragon storm in the
[01:34:06] showcase foil. Nice there. mountain and
[01:34:10] the bo um and the borderless foil flame
[01:34:14] hold
[01:34:15] grappler foil reunion of the house
[01:34:19] extended
[01:34:20] art zurggo thunders decree I don't think
[01:34:23] I've seen that one in the uh clan
[01:34:26] card encampment nice borderless
[01:34:30] land voice of victory and foil buddy
[01:34:33] that's a foil uh show clan card there
[01:34:36] nice one and an elephant token I mean
[01:34:38] not as big as all the other hits. But
[01:34:39] that was a good pack there, too.
[01:34:41] Even I mean, that was a solid good
[01:34:46] pack. Nice, buddy. Let me get these in
[01:34:49] the sleeves. Protect them. Oh,
[01:34:53] yes. Oh, yes. This is one of those sets
[01:34:55] where it's either going to be I feel
[01:34:57] like this one of those ones where like
[01:34:58] the all of the um collector booster
[01:35:00] cards unless they are um like really
[01:35:04] nobody wants them for any way, shape or
[01:35:05] form. I feel like everything is going to
[01:35:07] be worth a little bit of money if that
[01:35:09] makes any sense. Whether it's like 75
[01:35:11] cents to a dollar, they're going to be
[01:35:13] worth that at some point just because
[01:35:14] there not there's not many of them
[01:35:16] around. I think uh Wizards is starting
[01:35:18] to smarten up with their um with how
[01:35:22] they're producing things so they don't
[01:35:23] have a ton of them all the time, you
[01:35:25] know. Li's coming in with another. I
[01:35:28] like it, my
[01:35:32] friend. All
[01:35:34] righty. Definitely a good
[01:35:37] pack. Where are we
[01:35:41] going? And I'm going to do
[01:35:43] this. Do the right one again. All right.
[01:35:46] While we get I'm going to do this
[01:35:47] quickly. I'm going to make a new image
[01:35:48] for our friend
[01:35:51] uh our buddy uh Big
[01:36:01] BK. See if I can add that in
[01:36:13] here. So, I know I got them over
[01:36:27] here. There you
[01:36:35] go. All
[01:36:48] right, let's see what that generates.
[01:36:52] And then Lil Toko, if you have an idea
[01:36:54] of what you would like to be or what
[01:36:55] type of character you are, we can build
[01:37:01] yours. Latino with dual wielding katons.
[01:37:04] We can look into that. All right. 1 2 3
[01:37:06] 4 5 6 7 8. Now we have swords. You can
[01:37:11] you uh that was one of the ones you're
[01:37:12] going to be able to start out with. So I
[01:37:14] think we can give you um a couple of
[01:37:16] things like that. Maybe maybe not. Yeah,
[01:37:18] I have an idea. I have an idea we can
[01:37:20] do. All right. Purging storm brood in
[01:37:23] the
[01:37:24] showcase. Auroral procession foil vice
[01:37:28] veteran ice climber. Breaching dragon
[01:37:30] storm dragon storm globe. Seize

[01:37:36] Leopard Feral Death Gorgger and a foil
[01:37:39] showcase island for your dragon uh foil
[01:37:43] there. Oo, great city for your uh nice
[01:37:47] land starting out there. Infantry shield
[01:37:49] for the
[01:37:50] uh extended art. Nice extended
[01:37:53] art. New way forward. There you go.
[01:37:57] That's a nice pickup for uh the the clan
[01:37:59] card. How's another Mox Jasper, buddy?
[01:38:05] Congratulations, dude. Revival of the
[01:38:08] ancestors in a foil borderless and a
[01:38:11] soldier token. Well, my friend, you're
[01:38:14] moxed out. I'm sorry. I was I, you know,
[01:38:18] maxed out. Moxed
[01:38:20] out, my friend.
[01:38:24] Wow, that was a really corny dad joke,
[01:38:26] but I felt like it worked.
[01:38:33] Oh my
[01:38:34] god. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
[01:38:36] Thank you. I was quick, too. I'm quick
[01:38:39] sometimes. Not all the time.
[01:38:44] Sometimes. Congratulations on that. See?
[01:38:47] See, that's what I was saying. Like
[01:38:48] people say like boxes are dead and then
[01:38:50] something like that comes out. Like
[01:38:52] they're not dead until the last pack is
[01:38:54] pulled. All right, my friend. I'm going
[01:38:56] to put the uh new way. I think New Way
[01:38:58] Forward was worth or something. I can't
[01:38:59] remember, but we're definitely putting
[01:39:00] the mocks in with
[01:39:03] it because I saw somebody where we had
[01:39:06] um we had one of the Jurassic um uh with
[01:39:10] Lost Caverns, one of the Jurassic Park
[01:39:12] uh foil stamp cards, and it was like the
[01:39:14] second the no there's three cards left
[01:39:16] in the box. No one else wanted to buy
[01:39:18] the box. Some other guy came in and was
[01:39:19] like, you know, it's my birthday. I'm
[01:39:20] going to buy I'm going to buy the last
[01:39:22] three packs. And the last pack that we
[01:39:26] opened out of the box ended up having in
[01:39:28] it a um rainbow foil
[01:39:32] monocrypt. I was like, well, look at
[01:39:34] that. I guess that box was not
[01:39:39] dead. They are definitely some packs,
[01:39:42] buddy. Could have serialized in them.
[01:39:45] Exactly. That's what you guys never
[01:39:46] know. You never know. I have pulled out
[01:39:50] on here three or four serialized cards
[01:39:53] in the about couple years we've been
[01:39:54] doing this. So, it is possible. It is
[01:39:57] possible. So, we're going to see what
[01:39:59] our buddy look like
[01:40:05] here. All right. Oh, your armor and
[01:40:08] stuff's a little
[01:40:10] different. All right, we'll try this
[01:40:12] one. We'll see if you want this as your
[01:40:15] image. All
[01:40:17] [Music]
[01:40:18] [Laughter]
[01:40:23] right, here we go. This is the image
[01:40:25] that it gave me. I don't know why, but
[01:40:27] we're going to we're going to uh we're
[01:40:28] going to try and use it. We're going to
[01:40:30] see what happens here. All right, a
[01:40:33] wasteland. And I'm going to use your
[01:40:35] description of yourself, my friend, for
[01:40:38] uh what you are here.
[01:40:50] All right. And let me get removing of
[01:40:52] the
[01:40:53] picture. There you
[01:40:55] go. And let's see.
[01:40:59] Uh, all
[01:41:01] right. Big BK. This is what um I used
[01:41:05] your other picture as um as reference.
[01:41:07] And I guess when you become a dragon,
[01:41:10] um, you turn into, uh, hold
[01:41:14] [Music]
[01:41:17] on. I'm trying to find
[01:41:26] you. Hold on. Let me put you on so I can
[01:41:28] see it. Actually, that'll
[01:41:30] help. All right. There we go. So, uh,
[01:41:32] you when you, uh, found the baby dragon,
[01:41:36] for some reason, it seems like you,
[01:41:38] um, I don't know. I guess you turn
[01:41:41] into Fabio Dragon
[01:41:52] Storm. What do you
[01:41:54] think? You got your your your baby uh,
[01:41:56] Lightning Dragon
[01:41:59] there, Rico Suave.
[01:42:02] Rico
[01:42:04] [Laughter]
[01:42:06] Suave. So your your your uh your weapon
[01:42:09] is gone somewhere. But yeah, that's what
[01:42:11] uh that's what you became
[01:42:15] somehow. What is going on with this all
[01:42:17] of a
[01:42:28] sudden? All right.
[01:42:31] So that's our big
[01:42:36] BK. You're wearing the hide armor game
[01:42:39] feature. Yes, that's what it is. You're
[01:42:40] hiding your armor. That's the feature
[01:42:41] that's going on. Correct. Correct.
[01:42:44] Exactly. You're hiding your armor.
[01:42:46] That's what it is. Yes. So, uh, Big B.
[01:42:50] What the hell?
[01:42:52] Seriously, I don't think I've ever seen
[01:42:54] that. That's pretty funny. That's pretty
[01:42:56] good. All right. Hold on. Then our buddy
[01:42:58] here.
[01:43:00] Um, here we go. And this is this is
[01:43:06] you, our friend.
[01:43:10] Uh,
[01:43:11] Lil, give me a second and I'm going to
[01:43:14] get yours set up right here. Lil
[01:43:22] Toquedo. All right. Here we go.
[01:43:26] And you should be I think this is a
[01:43:27] tolerable
[01:43:28] one. I like that one. That's a good one.
[01:43:31] Not
[01:43:33] bad. All right. There you go. What about
[01:43:36] And this is a little
[01:43:41] Tokido comes into the
[01:43:43] wasteland from another
[01:43:46] dimension kind of set up with a couple
[01:43:49] of
[01:43:50] uh katanas in his hand.
[01:43:56] You are. You are definitely little too.
[01:43:59] What do you think? Is that uh is that
[01:44:05] acceptable? Are you not entertained? I
[01:44:08] know. I thought it kind of looked like
[01:44:09] that. Right.
[01:44:12] Right. Nice. All right. So, there you
[01:44:14] go. Little Tquito. There you are with
[01:44:15] your
[01:44:16] uh dual katanas hanging out in the
[01:44:19] wasteland.
[01:44:29] We're going to make it a little spin
[01:44:30] with you
[01:44:31] though
[01:44:33] because you came in and you come in in a
[01:44:36] little setup here with the way you uh
[01:44:38] jumped in with the box and all. We like
[01:44:39] to set you guys up and give get a little
[01:44:41] extra stuff here. Uh Lil
[01:44:44] Tokido, you actually happen to be we're
[01:44:47] going to give a little backstory to the
[01:44:48] Low Toquito here.
[01:44:51] When Lil Toquito came
[01:44:53] in, he popped out of a cave and wandered
[01:44:55] out of a cave. He didn't know how he got
[01:44:57] there. Did walk past the dragon goes,
[01:44:59] "Wow, they're here,
[01:45:01] too." Now he's wandering
[01:45:04] around trying to figure out where he is.
[01:45:08] Cuz he was somewhere and he tried to
[01:45:09] attack something with his uh dual
[01:45:10] katanas.
[01:45:12] He was attacking some of the dragons
[01:45:13] that were going after his village and uh
[01:45:17] I don't know turned up here. There was a
[01:45:20] blue puff and he was here all of a
[01:45:25] sudden. Big BK ass if you want to um if
[01:45:28] you want to follow Rico
[01:45:34] [Laughter]
[01:45:37] Suave. Oh wow. That's funny man. That's
[01:45:39] a good one man. Follow
[01:45:43] Rico. All right. Well, we have little
[01:45:44] Tokido. Anyways, you guys are wandering
[01:45:47] around our friends. You guys are now all
[01:45:50] around. You just went in and came out of
[01:45:51] that that cave. All right. Big BK and
[01:45:55] you guys wander out and you're standing
[01:45:58] and you see Oh, no. Wrong one. You see
[01:46:00] in front of you the uh the vault that
[01:46:03] they came out of before. or you can
[01:46:04] investigate that if you want. But right
[01:46:06] now, I know Big B himself has been um
[01:46:09] going towards this mountain that was
[01:46:11] pointed out to him in the distance that
[01:46:14] he believes
[01:46:16] um control some things that has a hidden
[01:46:19] vault in it of some
[01:46:22] kind. You are building an army. He has a
[01:46:25] friend. He has a robot helper friend
[01:46:27] that he beefed up. We have a ghoul
[01:46:29] doctor that he has that's a friend of
[01:46:31] his that he made that will help heal
[01:46:32] things. But this guy's a scaredy-cat. He
[01:46:33] runs from anything like somebody
[01:46:35] screams, he turns and runs and screams
[01:46:37] himself. So, you know, it's that type of
[01:46:39] person. And
[01:46:43] then we'll uh have now they're over here
[01:46:48] though. See, he decided he wanted to
[01:46:50] rock walk past a
[01:46:52] um a little village. I told him he
[01:46:56] wanted to stop at. He want He said, "No,
[01:46:59] I'm going right past the village." He
[01:47:00] wandered past the village. It was going
[01:47:02] to be a little different with the
[01:47:03] dragons that we had there, but wandered
[01:47:04] past the village there and um ended up
[01:47:08] getting taken away. It's a friend
[01:47:11] though. They were a friend. They brought
[01:47:12] him back to uh to the kind of the
[01:47:16] beginning. Not exactly, more like near
[01:47:18] the beginning of it. So, he has a little
[01:47:20] bit. He understands like you need to
[01:47:21] work on this. You can't just blow your
[01:47:23] way through, right? That doesn't work
[01:47:26] when that happens.
[01:47:28] So, you, my friend, are uh hanging out
[01:47:33] with him now. You're wandering around in
[01:47:36] that
[01:47:37] location of uh right outside of here.
[01:47:40] So, you got you're in the kind of in
[01:47:42] that burnt out buildings area where you
[01:47:44] can see some of those places. Why is
[01:47:47] this doing this and falling down? Stop
[01:47:48] falling
[01:47:49] down. So, you can decide where further
[01:47:52] do you want to going to go. All right.
[01:47:54] You're going to head back with the
[01:47:55] towards uh towards that location where
[01:47:57] you were going before. All right. So,
[01:48:00] you head back
[01:48:03] over and um start walking
[01:48:07] out and you see uh that Brahman thing
[01:48:11] there again. You're like, "What the
[01:48:12] hell? Come on. Where's this thing keep
[01:48:14] coming from? This giant
[01:48:16] thing." And uh you need to know. You
[01:48:18] decide. What are you doing now? Now, our
[01:48:21] buddy Lil Toko, we're going to give you
[01:48:23] for weapons when you start, since you
[01:48:26] have the tool katanas, you're gonna have
[01:48:27] those. All right, we'll give you
[01:48:29] those. But on top of that, you start
[01:48:31] with 100 health. You also will get um a
[01:48:35] pistol and a knife cuz everybody starts
[01:48:37] with a pistol and a knife. But you also
[01:48:39] are going to have your
[01:48:41] uh kas. And when you roll, that will
[01:48:45] give you
[01:48:49] um so that will give you six pl uh three
[01:48:52] plus
[01:48:53] each for your uh and but it'll also be a
[01:48:59] uh it'll
[01:49:00] be so it'll give you six when you yank
[01:49:04] both of those. That's is going to be six
[01:49:06] plus and then it'll be 3d6 dice is
[01:49:10] what's rolled for the attack to see what
[01:49:13] happens for the
[01:49:20] damage. What do I keep telling you
[01:49:22] about? Yes, maybe. I don't know. There's
[01:49:26] an angry one. It just keep bumping and
[01:49:27] wandering by it. You don't do anything.
[01:49:29] You go right by it. Maybe you need to
[01:49:31] kill it. I don't know. But uh our buddy
[01:49:34] little Toquito though on the other hand,
[01:49:36] they're looking over and they're like,
[01:49:37] "Yo, I've seen those before. They're way
[01:49:40] smaller though where I come from. What's
[01:49:42] going on? All the lizards are huge here,
[01:49:44] too." He's like, "What do you mean?" Big
[01:49:48] BK's looking at him. Turns around like,
[01:49:49] "What are you talking about? What do you
[01:49:50] mean they're bigger? They're bigger.
[01:49:53] Dude, they're dragging in the cave.
[01:49:54] They're like this. They're never any
[01:49:56] bigger than what's on your
[01:49:58] shoulder." Now you're looking at each
[01:50:00] other like, "Huh? Well, this is weird.
[01:50:03] So, it seems like our buddy
[01:50:05] um our buddy Lil Toquedo may have gone
[01:50:08] from somewhere to like uh he's now what
[01:50:11] is that? Guller's Travels going to the
[01:50:13] island of Big of all the things that are
[01:50:15] larger than him, the
[01:50:18] giants. So, you have a rocket launcher
[01:50:21] with one rocket. Lil Toquito has those
[01:50:24] for the weapons. Now, Lil Tooko has some
[01:50:26] basic light
[01:50:28] armor. Also, as you see, light armor,
[01:50:31] which gives a
[01:50:34] minus3 to
[01:50:38] melee and
[01:50:40] a
[01:50:42] minus two for ranged
[01:50:46] attacks. And that's it. And then you
[01:50:51] also will come in. Where is it?
[01:50:54] No, I think that's it. Might have Let me
[01:50:56] think if there's anything else. No, no.
[01:50:58] Get your katanas. Those Yep, that's it,
[01:51:01] I
[01:51:02] think. There you
[01:51:05] go. All right. You're going to kill it.
[01:51:06] All right. So, what are you going to
[01:51:07] use? You have your rocket launcher. You
[01:51:09] have your
[01:51:10] um sword. You have your uh incendiary
[01:51:16] [Music]
[01:51:19] gat. And um you also have a now a friend
[01:51:23] Toquito.
[01:51:27] Your gat and your main sword is your
[01:51:29] second thing. All right. So big BK uses
[01:51:31] the gat. Says I'm done with this thing.
[01:51:34] Keeping being around me and
[01:51:37] attacks with the incendiary
[01:51:40] gatling. All right. And that roll is
[01:51:43] this
[01:51:46] here. Let's see what you get for luck.
[01:51:50] You hit him. You only he you actually
[01:51:52] only needed 14 to hit it, but it's
[01:51:54] 10 14 and you don't get your incendiary
[01:51:58] extra there, but you do get it catching
[01:52:00] a little bit on fire. So, that's 14
[01:52:03] minus it's only 35 health. So, that goes
[01:52:06] down to
[01:52:07] uh
[01:52:09] 21. Now, you go with your uh your
[01:52:12] flaming sword there. Your uh So, we
[01:52:14] don't use the
[01:52:15] D4, but let's see.
[01:52:19] Ah, it works. So, you only need a
[01:52:22] 14 and you get four. You get eight.
[01:52:27] Well, look at that. You get
[01:52:30] 10.
[01:52:32] 22 damage, my
[01:52:34] friend.
[01:52:36] Well, son of a You just killed it, I
[01:52:42] guess. Well, look at that.
[01:52:48] That is 22, right? There's 21 left,
[01:52:50] right? 22.
[01:52:52] 22. Yeah, you did indeed. Now that um
[01:52:57] that that Brahman screams in agony as
[01:53:00] you go and chop it with the sword, the
[01:53:02] lightning sword coming down, hitting it.
[01:53:04] Now um our buddy Lil
[01:53:07] Tokido, you want to go over and do
[01:53:09] anything? You want to leave it be? It's
[01:53:11] up to you. You get to do this when you
[01:53:15] attack. If you want to attack with your
[01:53:16] swords. I know he attacked. You didn't
[01:53:18] say you were doing anything, so we're
[01:53:20] waiting. Now you can scavenge it. You
[01:53:23] can see if there's leather on it. That's
[01:53:25] pretty big. Uh Brahman, you know, maybe
[01:53:28] you get yourself a bunch of leather to
[01:53:30] make some things.
[01:53:32] Oh, or who knows? Or you just wander
[01:53:35] past
[01:53:36] it. Wander through the wasteland on your
[01:53:40] way out into
[01:53:42] nothingness. Wander on through.
[01:53:46] Oh, you're going to scavenge it. All
[01:53:47] right. So, you go over and you look on
[01:53:49] it and you go, "Ah, I don't see much on
[01:53:51] there,
[01:53:52] but you decide, you know, I think I can
[01:53:55] cut this little taquito there." And he
[01:53:58] goes, "You know what? I think I can help
[01:53:59] here." And he goes over and he starts
[01:54:01] slicing away. He goes, "We we use these
[01:54:03] all the time." And he pulls out a bunch
[01:54:07] of leather for you guys. Nice. So, you
[01:54:11] now both
[01:54:12] have Let's get your loot
[01:54:16] here, five
[01:54:22] leather. So, if you need to do anything
[01:54:25] with leather, like, you know, upgrade
[01:54:27] something, build a backpack or something
[01:54:29] like that, you have more than enough.
[01:54:32] And maybe you can build a larger thing.
[01:54:35] Five leather from that Braumin. I like
[01:54:38] it.
[01:54:41] Now you're looking further trying to see
[01:54:44] what else you can get. You don't really
[01:54:46] see anything else, but you have some
[01:54:47] horns and things like
[01:54:53] that. You can take them, leave them,
[01:54:56] wander on your way. It's up to
[01:54:58] you. Horns. All right. So, you're going
[01:55:00] to have a set of horns for each of
[01:55:05] you. So, let's give you some horns.
[01:55:13] Not horns.
[01:55:16] Horns. Two
[01:55:21] horns. All righty. There you guys
[01:55:24] wandering. And now, all right,
[01:55:26] friend. You can decide what you're going
[01:55:28] to do a little bit here. Do you want to
[01:55:33] uh wander more in the wasteland?
[01:55:38] I know a lot of times around now people
[01:55:40] are getting ready for work. I keep
[01:55:41] getting
[01:55:42] little bone fragments out. Had a tooth
[01:55:45] pole. I think pieces of it got stuck and
[01:55:47] some of it keeps coming out. Or maybe
[01:55:48] it's the
[01:55:51] other stuff that they put in there. I
[01:55:53] don't know. Keep pushing. All right. You
[01:55:57] keep pushing. Go pass a
[01:56:01] Brahman. All right.
[01:56:04] and you
[01:56:06] uh get out and you see
[01:56:10] uh this area, this little town you
[01:56:13] wander through. Oh, I've been here
[01:56:16] before. Big BK, I think you know this
[01:56:18] place,
[01:56:27] right? Well, do you want to go? Where do
[01:56:30] you want to go? You want to go into the
[01:56:32] bar? or you want to go to the shop. It's
[01:56:34] up to you. You're going to keep pushing.
[01:56:37] All
[01:56:38] right. Keep wandering forward. Keep
[01:56:41] wandering forward. Well, you do see the
[01:56:44] mountain in the distance, but the
[01:56:48] barkeep comes out and goes, "Hey."
[01:56:51] Running out goes, "Big
[01:56:55] BK." She's got the shotgun this time. I
[01:56:57] forgot about that. We need assistance.
[01:57:04] And uh you're like, "You know
[01:57:07] what? I might be feeling tired." You
[01:57:10] have those uh those uh barkeeper
[01:57:13] helpers, right? With the upstairs. I can
[01:57:15] take a
[01:57:19] nap. You don't work for free. Oh. Um
[01:57:22] she's like, "You know what? We will let
[01:57:24] you can uh you can have your rest
[01:57:25] upstairs, recuperate, be fully healed,
[01:57:28] and um you can drink for free whenever
[01:57:30] you come here. How's
[01:57:33] that? It's pretty much get free whiskey
[01:57:35] whenever you're
[01:57:38] there. And you get to sleep and rest and
[01:57:41] they'll recuperate and uh bring you back
[01:57:42] up to full health. We don't know. We'll
[01:57:46] see what it does to you.
[01:57:49] Well, the barkeep says, "Uh, we've been
[01:57:51] having a bit of a problem. Um, seems
[01:57:55] like somebody broke up and killed a
[01:57:57] bunch of the uh the mutant raiders uh
[01:58:00] and their village that they were in.
[01:58:02] They were always staying away from us,
[01:58:03] but
[01:58:04] now there are
[01:58:07] um there's like a half a dozen of them
[01:58:10] that keep higher coming
[01:58:12] in." All right. Hey, Toquito. You have a
[01:58:14] good one, my friend. I'll talk to you
[01:58:16] later.
[01:58:18] So, we need some
[01:58:20] assistance protecting us from the
[01:58:23] mutants. Can you
[01:58:28] help, my
[01:58:30] friend? Are you able to
[01:58:32] assist in
[01:58:35] our All right. You said they are uh you
[01:58:38] told them they're around kind of the end
[01:58:40] of the village here. So, if you can help
[01:58:42] me. Help. It's just at the end of the
[01:58:43] village. They are. They keep coming
[01:58:45] running in from the end of the uh the
[01:58:46] village here. I'd like you to go to the
[01:58:48] end. They built another camp there and
[01:58:51] take them
[01:58:53] out. All right. I can do that. So, you
[01:58:56] head
[01:58:58] out. Big
[01:59:03] BK. Well, nope. Big BK wanders out of
[01:59:07] the bar. She says, "Please come back
[01:59:09] safe." And as you wander out, you go
[01:59:11] over to the village. Now, you're gonna
[01:59:14] go by yourself because we have uh some
[01:59:16] people have left it
[01:59:18] seems. So, we may be uh you may be by
[01:59:21] yourself
[01:59:32] wandering. Now, remember everybody, we
[01:59:34] do have our uh surprise set here if
[01:59:36] anybody wants to jump on
[01:59:39] it. Oh, you're going alone. All right. I
[01:59:41] like it. doing it alone. Electro turtle
[01:59:44] likes. I like it. You can jump in, hang
[01:59:45] out with
[01:59:47] us. Go [Â __Â ] on some mutants. I like it.
[01:59:50] All right, so you head that direction to
[01:59:52] the end and you see these mutant raiders
[01:59:54] again. Build it built another camp
[01:59:57] there. Now you know your weapons. Each
[02:00:00] one of them. There's either there's two
[02:00:02] of them that are
[02:00:03] 15 and there's two that are 20 and
[02:00:06] there's one that is 30 for health.
[02:00:10] Now they are quick and stronger. So you
[02:00:16] might have a little bit extra to deal
[02:00:19] with some
[02:00:21] things. Now you head out there. Now
[02:00:23] you're going to attack
[02:00:27] first and then our buddy coming in.
[02:00:29] Something next here. I like it. See what
[02:00:32] you get. There's play boosters and some
[02:00:34] collectors in there. See what you get,
[02:00:36] my friends.
[02:00:39] Electric turtle coming in for some
[02:00:40] adventuring. I don't like it. Here we
[02:00:42] go.
[02:00:44] Electric, you got yourself a dragon tar.
[02:00:48] Dragon storm play booster. You want me
[02:00:51] to open this for you? But you, my
[02:00:53] friend, you come
[02:00:54] in, you're uh you're you're you see this
[02:00:57] stuff going on in the village here with
[02:00:58] Big Bk and you're like, "What is going
[02:01:02] on?" Now, you start out with a pistol
[02:01:05] and a knife, my friend. Electric turtle.
[02:01:08] What would you like to do? You want to
[02:01:11] follow him or do you want to go on your
[02:01:13] own like uh side thing? Bear of glory,
[02:01:16] devoted duelist, evolving wilds, cruel
[02:01:19] truths, sagu wilding, highspire, bell
[02:01:23] ringer, heritage reclamation, kishla
[02:01:26] skimmer, veteran ice climber, armament
[02:01:30] dragon, sharking
[02:01:33] sharpshooter, herdirloom for your rare.
[02:01:36] I don't see that much frequently coming
[02:01:37] out actually. J Sky Monument Foil,
[02:01:40] Windscard Crag, and a warrior token.
[02:01:44] There you go, my friend. Not
[02:01:46] bad. I like
[02:01:48] it. There we go. On the herd heirloom.
[02:01:52] Not bad on that one. There.
[02:01:56] Sweetness. Let me get that for you.
[02:01:58] Electric
[02:02:00] turtle. Yeah. Assistance from behind. I
[02:02:02] like it. You look in the distance.
[02:02:10] I like it. Thank
[02:02:12] you. There you go, electric
[02:02:19] turtle. All
[02:02:21] righty. There you go. You're falling.
[02:02:23] You're in the You're behind there. Big
[02:02:24] BK wanders in now. Big BK, what are you
[02:02:27] starting with your front weapon? You
[02:02:29] have your You generally go in, but you
[02:02:31] do have the rocket launcher. Remember,
[02:02:32] you always have that.
[02:02:34] You have one rocket though. That's the
[02:02:36] only
[02:02:38] thing you have to decide what you're
[02:02:40] going to be using for your weapons. You
[02:02:41] have your incendiary gat. You do have
[02:02:44] the rocket launcher. You got your pirate
[02:02:49] sword. Rocket launcher then. All right.
[02:02:51] Now, rocket launcher. This is how the
[02:02:54] rocket launcher
[02:02:59] works. I have to make a duplicate of
[02:03:01] something. Give me a second.
[02:03:10] I have to make
[02:03:19] this
[02:03:21] that and
[02:03:26] uh
[02:03:27] that. Okay. Nope.
[02:03:33] This is what I got to do
[02:03:46] [Music]
[02:03:48] here. All
[02:03:57] right. Okay. Oh, there you go. There. I
[02:04:01] forgot to put the background in. Hold
[02:04:05] [Music]
[02:04:08] on. There we
[02:04:11] are. I got to adjust how it is. But this
[02:04:13] is
[02:04:14] uh that's that there. That's not going
[02:04:16] to work, right? Because that's not Oh,
[02:04:18] well, you know
[02:04:20] what? If you want to keep this roll, we
[02:04:22] can cuz they're 1 2 3 4 5 six. They all
[02:04:25] stayed on screen. Luckily, none of them
[02:04:27] went off screen. They were just all at
[02:04:28] the top. So you can keep this roll if
[02:04:30] you'd like because you're going to hit
[02:04:32] with the rocket launcher. What happens
[02:04:34] is you have your two which is your luck.
[02:04:36] You get two chances out of them. You
[02:04:38] have your luck and you got it with two.
[02:04:39] So you hit the rocket launcher went off.
[02:04:42] All right. And when it hits it causes
[02:04:45] secondary explosions. Ah see. All right.
[02:04:49] And you hit now
[02:04:53] 12 15. That's uh All right.
[02:04:58] 30. All right. Uh, no. Almost. That's
[02:05:01] 20. That's 12. 13. That's 28. You hit.
[02:05:05] But because of your uh extra there. All
[02:05:09] right. This is what we got to do. We
[02:05:11] know what do we want to use the We can
[02:05:13] use. If you hit it, you have to the
[02:05:15] extra there.
[02:05:17] Four are is the uh is what I was going
[02:05:21] to say is how is the times that you'll
[02:05:23] get
[02:05:24] for extra
[02:05:28] dice rolls. So, it'll take your four
[02:05:30] highest and add it in to the damage,
[02:05:33] which will be
[02:05:37] 12 and 10 again. 22 me 8 30 40 50 damage
[02:05:44] because of the secondary explosions that
[02:05:46] went
[02:05:47] off. So nice one there,
[02:05:50] dude.
[02:05:52] Well, you just go in and you're
[02:05:56] like, I'm done with this. F you
[02:06:00] all. And uh you uh you take the rocket
[02:06:04] launcher and you shoot.
[02:06:08] your little mini rocket that you found.
[02:06:10] The one that you
[02:06:11] found and you got um yeah, some damage.
[02:06:17] So,
[02:06:18] uh three of them are dead. One of them
[02:06:21] is left alive. Uh he was just kind of
[02:06:23] blown away and
[02:06:25] concussed. And then
[02:06:27] um let me do this. So, I have to adjust
[02:06:30] the
[02:06:35] size so it fits better on screen. There
[02:06:38] we go. And then uh yeah, you blow those
[02:06:41] guys up. There's only one left that's
[02:06:43] kind of unconscious and starting to
[02:06:44] stand up. And there's one that's got a
[02:06:46] leg uh blown off that is holding on to a
[02:06:50] pole. He's yelling at you. And the one
[02:06:52] with a leg decides they're going to try
[02:06:54] to run towards you, but they can't cuz
[02:06:55] they blew off a leg. So, you're going to
[02:06:56] get a second shot of things because you
[02:06:58] use the rocket launcher. And Concussant
[02:07:01] had a good hit. Rocket launcher. I mean,
[02:07:04] man, goodbye my friends. You did it.
[02:07:07] Took out a bunch of people
[02:07:11] there. Nailed those
[02:07:14] guys. Slice away with a sword. You go
[02:07:16] running in with your
[02:07:18] uh with your pirate sword. Your
[02:07:21] electrified pirate sword going you all.
[02:07:24] No. Electric, you going to do anything
[02:07:26] in the background here? You have a
[02:07:28] choice to come in right now. I mean, he
[02:07:29] did a pretty good job uh taking some of
[02:07:31] them out. Maybe you can uh help take uh
[02:07:33] take one of the last ones out there. So,
[02:07:35] you slice in with your
[02:07:38] sword and your sword. Does uh There we
[02:07:42] go. Where is
[02:07:44] it? There you go. Sword
[02:07:47] time. Oh
[02:07:53] my. You go in and shank someone. I like
[02:07:55] it. So, Electric runs in to go and stab
[02:07:59] one of them as you swing yours. And
[02:08:01] Electric, you get a hit. Nice, buddy.
[02:08:04] You stab the one that was standing there
[02:08:05] with a leg blown
[02:08:07] off. And as you do that, right behind
[02:08:10] you comes in big
[02:08:11] BK swinging his mighty electric sword
[02:08:14] down. And because the help of his uh his
[02:08:16] baby dragon there, he got himself a a
[02:08:19] natural
[02:08:21] 20. Yes, you did. And the entire ground
[02:08:25] erupts with electric shock as a
[02:08:27] lightning bolt strikes down out of the
[02:08:30] air and
[02:08:32] vaporizes that last mutant that was
[02:08:36] sitting there that was starting to stand
[02:08:38] up.
[02:08:40] Gone. It is no more. He is
[02:08:44] gone. He has disappeared. The dragon is
[02:08:48] now standing on your shoulder. You're
[02:08:49] like, he looks at you and like, "Good
[02:08:52] job, dude. I like it." He appreciates
[02:08:55] it. Like, nice electricity. Good job.
[02:08:59] They are all dead. Dude, that rocket
[02:09:01] took them out, man. You had a good hit
[02:09:03] with the rocket. You had the luck hit.
[02:09:05] You got You got luck. And then it had
[02:09:07] four of the top ones on top of it. I
[02:09:09] mean, dude, you got some luck with that
[02:09:10] rocket launcher. I mean, I guess it's
[02:09:12] good to get some luck with it, too,
[02:09:13] right now. Electric turtle, you shanked
[02:09:15] that guy in the background. And luckily
[02:09:17] by the time they, you know, the shock
[02:09:19] went off, all of you died. They He died
[02:09:20] too because the shock killed them all.
[02:09:23] They're all dead now. Now you guys get
[02:09:26] to decide you want to loot electric
[02:09:28] turtle. You have a salvage roll. That's
[02:09:30] why you're in here attacking. You do you
[02:09:33] want to choose high or low? It's going
[02:09:35] to be either 10 or higher or nine or
[02:09:38] lower, whatever it is. You know what I
[02:09:40] mean? 11 or higher or 10 or
[02:09:44] lower. High. So you have to have 11 and
[02:09:47] higher, right? I think 10 or higher. 11
[02:09:49] higher. Oh well, nine no matter what is
[02:09:53] not high.
[02:09:55] So you do not salvage a ton of stuff,
[02:10:01] but you do end up
[02:10:03] finding hanging out with them an assault
[02:10:06] rifle. I mean, they're raiders. They had
[02:10:09] one. And you find some assault rifle
[02:10:12] ammo. All right. So, that's not too bad.
[02:10:16] Electric
[02:10:19] turtle. Let's do this here and get that
[02:10:23] in there for
[02:10:29] you. So, you get the
[02:10:31] pistol. Oh,
[02:10:33] no. A knife and an AR with 30 rounds of
[02:10:39] ammo. All right. And you have no no
[02:10:42] damage whatsoever because you came in
[02:10:43] the end. Now our buddy Big
[02:10:47] BK.
[02:10:49] You took them out. You destroyed all of
[02:10:53] them. They are done. Oh, your dragon.
[02:10:56] Oh, not that one. Your incendiary got
[02:10:58] help. I mean, your rocket launcher
[02:10:59] helped this time. Took them all out. All
[02:11:02] you need to do is strike once with your
[02:11:03] pirate
[02:11:04] sword. And I mean, when you get a
[02:11:06] natural 20 on a roll, that helps, right?
[02:11:10] So, we're going to we'll try another.
[02:11:12] See if anybody else wants to jump in
[02:11:13] while we're hanging out here for a
[02:11:14] minute. I'm going to take a drink of the
[02:11:15] coffee quickly and we're going to see
[02:11:17] where Big
[02:11:18] BK, our buddy here, our um Fabio Dragon
[02:11:22] Storm or uh I don't know, Rico Suave,
[02:11:26] Suave Dragon, whatever you want to call
[02:11:29] him, and our buddy uh Electric are
[02:11:31] hanging out.
[02:11:32] our friend um our friend Lil Toquedo had
[02:11:35] to head out and go to work. So, they
[02:11:37] were not able to hang around too much
[02:11:38] longer, but they uh they they came in
[02:11:40] they came in big today helping
[02:11:44] out with the dual
[02:11:47] katanas. Seeing if you Oh, the time was
[02:11:50] all wrong on that one. Draco Suave. I
[02:11:54] like it. I was trying to find of a good

[02:12:00] Now, uh, that big BK is now Draco
[02:12:06] Suave. There you go. I knew there was a
[02:12:08] name in there
[02:12:09] somewhere. I knew it was there
[02:12:11] somewhere. We just didn't know where it
[02:12:13] was. We had to find
[02:12:17] it. All right, everyone. Uh, we'll keep
[02:12:21] running these for a little bit. If you
[02:12:22] guys want to jump in, hang out. Now, you
[02:12:24] go back, you kill them, and you go. All
[02:12:27] right, nice. We killed them. You
[02:12:29] scavenge around a little bit, you find
[02:12:31] some things. They don't really have too
[02:12:32] much on them, but you do end up finding
[02:12:34] a few Pogs. So, there's uh 13 Pogs here.
[02:12:38] What do you say we give the Pogs to our
[02:12:40] buddy um Electric for coming in new
[02:12:43] since you have uh over 200 Big
[02:12:46] BK or do you want to keep it? It's up to
[02:12:49] you. It's up to you, my
[02:12:53] friend. All righty. Let's
[02:12:56] see. Sure. All right, they can keep it.
[02:12:59] All right, we're going to give the 13
[02:13:00] Pogs to our buddy Electric that came in.
[02:13:03] So, you now
[02:13:04] have 13 Pogs to help you as you wander
[02:13:08] in the
[02:13:15] wasteland. All right. And then, oh, we

[02:24:44] cards there for you. I mean, the
[02:24:46] enchantment cards there at the end
[02:24:47] there, I like
[02:24:50] that when they actually give you one
[02:24:52] that's like not a bad card twice, then I
[02:24:55] can tolerate it. It's when they give you
[02:24:56] like two junk cards twice, you're like,
[02:24:58] seriously, guys, come
[02:25:00] on. It was disappointing, Jeff. I know.
[02:25:04] They had some It had some potential, but
[02:25:07] um I think they
[02:25:09] um it was one of a last type of set
[02:25:12] they'll be putting out is what I think.
[02:25:16] like
[02:25:17] those wonky weird ones like the
[02:25:21] um like the
[02:25:23] uh Outlaws of Thunder Junction and stuff
[02:25:26] like that. I don't think we're going to
[02:25:27] see many more of
[02:25:29] those if that makes sense because I feel
[02:25:31] like this was like one of those weird
[02:25:33] wonky ones and they um they ended up
[02:25:38] because of uh just how odd it was, it

[02:25:43] All right, good luck, my friend, with
[02:25:44] the last one here. We're going with some

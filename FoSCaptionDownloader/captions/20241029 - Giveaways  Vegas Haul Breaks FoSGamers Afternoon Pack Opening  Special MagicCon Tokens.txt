[00:17:08] Revelations that's what we're going to
[00:17:09] add in there burning Revelations secret
[00:17:11] layer also will be added in there let's
[00:17:14] do that to that I think that's a good
[00:17:17] one then that will go in as we have
[00:17:19] there now give me one sec find some
[00:17:22] things figured out we'll do
[00:17:25] um let's do this here
[00:17:32] as we build them I try to be very
[00:17:34] transparent on
[00:17:36] everything so here you go so we're going
[00:17:39] to put this out here and I'm going to
[00:17:41] build us a break we're going to call

[00:18:00] been nice to be able to get done on

[00:37:02] two three four five six seven eight nine

[01:18:42] though we'll get it back running there
[01:18:46] though yeah not a problem for some
[01:18:48] reason it's like whenever I go away on a
[01:18:50] vacation every time that happens if I'm
[01:18:52] not in my regular time slot I end up
[01:18:54] coming back to like having a headache of
[01:18:55] uh trying to get everything caught up to
[01:18:57] like YouTube I up for some reason
[01:18:58] actually I think it's partly because I'm
[01:19:00] at another Milestone where I have to
[01:19:03] have a lot of I have to like once I hit
[01:19:05] views of this Milestone I'm like couple

[01:19:10] Milestone I'm going to end up being able
[01:19:12] to
[01:19:13] uh get add revenue and click Revenue so
[01:19:16] I think that's why they're kind of being
[01:19:17] a being a painy ass on the tubes there
[01:19:19] that's okay though we'll have some fun
[01:19:21] with it so irregular cohort let's see

[01:20:43] on the tubes it's not like anyone's
[01:20:44] there watching at the moment so I'm
[01:20:45] going to end up probably breaking taking

[01:20:49] um just hang out with you guys on the

[01:21:03] that make a make a virtual pull box like
[01:21:06] I've done for

[01:21:12] can do that we can do that I don't know
[01:21:15] if that's those are the things you want
[01:21:16] but I was hoping we'd just do a break

[01:21:55] rough one that's what it is there's a
[01:21:57] lot of people on in the afternoon that's
[01:21:58] what it is that's what it is it's just
[01:22:00] not my normal time so we will uh hang

[01:22:49] let's uh let's see what we're doing
[01:22:51] how's it going Angelo
[01:22:59] ah yeah I understand that buddy no I got
[01:23:00] I I want to build a I I'm not going to
[01:23:02] stop doing this opening them I'll open
[01:23:04] them some more for you Angelo but what I
[01:23:06] need to get done is uh some people on
[01:23:08] here like to do pull boxes so I was
[01:23:10] going to try to build a virtual one here
[01:23:11] for a second for people and see what we
[01:23:14] can get set up for them is actually what
[01:23:15] I was thinking that's why I was like uh

[01:23:32] because that makes people go after that
[01:23:33] instead of different things so we're
[01:23:35] going to stick with the break I think I
[01:23:36] think we'll just stick with the break I

[01:39:48] be better let me do this for a second
[01:39:51] one second here I have an idea
[01:39:53] is it going to work
[01:39:56] might no that's not
[01:40:01] it where is it oh there we are okay we
[01:40:05] get
[01:40:06] those I'm going to put
[01:40:09] those
[01:40:22] here okay paste
[01:40:25] that Z it's not how I wanted to do it
[01:40:28] paste oh come on you bum how do I get
[01:40:32] that to past without doing it that way I
[01:40:34] did it last
[01:40:35] time so I can put it in the uh in the
[01:40:37] notes here because it's not going to put
[01:40:39] in the notes it's going to mess it all
[01:40:40] up and it won't look right so let me
[01:40:42] see actually will would work let's see
[01:40:45] let's check it
[01:40:46] out I've never tried that before
[01:40:49] though I break it
[01:40:54] oh wow that's really weird to be big huh
[01:40:57] that's insane yeah not going to do that
[01:40:59] one we're not we're gonna we're going to
[01:41:01] remove
[01:41:03] that that's good to know though that I
[01:41:05] can make multiple layers though oh
[01:41:07] that's a good one to know now I learned
[01:41:08] something just
[01:41:09] now you just saw me learn something
[01:41:11] about uh about OBS here live on air that
[01:41:16] was pretty stupid I didn't know you
[01:41:17] could do that then I got figure that one
[01:41:19] out again I understand how that was done
[01:41:20] but now I got to get to the note thing
[01:41:22] that I had
[01:41:32] no nope that's not
[01:41:43] working ah that'll work
[01:41:51] now we go
[01:41:56] try
[01:42:06] that two mystery it's just making it so
[01:42:09] you guys can see things a little easier
[01:42:11] I think we'll find
[01:42:13] out then we'll get our uh braks
[01:42:17] going I like to have them e nice and
[01:42:19] shown easy for you
[01:42:26] I did it again this is how it happens
[01:42:28] when you don't always fully prepare but
[01:42:30] I do better most
[01:42:32] days been getting better at apparent
[01:42:35] today though guess
[01:42:39] not this is because I do afternoon ones
[01:42:42] Matt my friend look at that you got
[01:42:44] another one well let's uh get that there
[01:42:47] and then we're going to open up uh once

[01:43:01] going to have any
[01:43:02] left I was hoping we'd have the breake
[01:43:05] filled by now but uh looks like we might
[01:43:08] have a
[01:43:09] uh a longer one than
[01:43:17] normal that there
[01:43:33] okay
[01:43:39] okay

[01:43:56] purposely just kind of getting this
[01:44:01] accomplished I want to make sure it
[01:44:02] looks right because the last time I put
[01:44:04] it in there and it broke how it look if

[01:44:07] ago and I cannot have that happen
[01:44:21] again okay okay let's see put that there
[01:44:24] it's going to make it a lot
[01:44:26] longer that's
[01:44:28] okay there we

[01:52:47] way up let me
[01:52:50] um hold on let me see what I can do here
[01:52:52] I think it's uh maybe where the
[01:52:55] microphone is right now I don't know
[01:52:56] maybe it's where the microphone is um
[01:52:58] I'm sorry it's not really I don't know
[01:53:00] why I can't get it to go any higher hold
[01:53:01] on let me
[01:53:05] um let me
[01:53:10] see no
[01:53:13] no
[01:53:15] no let's
[01:53:20] see no I don't think there anything I
[01:53:23] adjust on that right now I don't know
[01:53:24] why it's so soft that is really weird
[01:53:26] that it's soft like that generally isn't
[01:53:27] I wonder if it's a setting on my camera
[01:53:31] itself that I have to
[01:53:34] adjust is there a auto adjustment oh

[01:56:09] time being out there I wish I could uh
[01:56:11] we did some more stuff like I had a
[01:56:13] little bit better plan I like we went
[01:56:14] out there there was the first time so
[01:56:16] like needed to kind of understand a
[01:56:17] little bit of what it was like and we
[01:56:19] didn't really get to we didn't really
[01:56:21] figure it out right away so as we were
[01:56:23] um like took a little while so we walked
[01:56:26] and we got a lot tireder than we
[01:56:27] probably needed to because of how much
[01:56:28] walking we did we did like uh I like
[01:56:31] almost 60 miles of walking when we were
[01:56:32] out there probably I know we did over 50
[01:56:36] but um I'm guessing by the time we got
[01:56:37] home after walking through the airport
[01:56:40] and everything it was probably getting
[01:56:41] closer to 60 it was pretty crazy but
[01:56:44] here we go we're going to open up some
[01:56:45] of this

[02:01:48] here we go so this is the order we're
[02:01:50] going to do this in reverse order I that
[02:01:51] that they're not going that order I
[02:01:52] already this is just kind of me from
[02:01:54] showing them off so we're going to
[02:01:55] reverse this order here all right cuz I
[02:01:58] like doing them weird orders I'm I'm
[02:02:00] weird that I have specific ways I do
[02:02:01] things my wife says I'm a little OCD
[02:02:03] with that but here we go back in it
[02:02:06] let's get it all right so here we go
[02:02:07] this is our stuff the way we do our
[02:02:09] breaks I've explained it many times
[02:02:11] before we take these breaks and we
[02:02:13] go all the mythics and
[02:02:16] rares we put in sleeves if there's
[02:02:19] anyone that's um over $10 or we take it
[02:02:22] and we put in top loader we make a proxy
[02:02:23] for it then we take all of our Commons
[02:02:27] and uncommons that are worth over $3 and
[02:02:30] we put them in the sleeves also we
[02:02:31] Shuffle those up and then we take the
[02:02:34] burning Revelations since there's only
[02:02:36] six cards we put those in sleeves and
[02:02:39] shuffle them up with everything too and
[02:02:41] what you get is handed them out based on
[02:02:44] the spot that you're in you already name
[02:02:45] on it so now that we have it here we are
[02:02:49] closed we have all the spots set so that
[02:02:52] means I'm going to write down I'm going
[02:02:55] to open everything up and then I'll
[02:02:56] write down everybody's name for the spot
[02:02:58] actually you know what I can just do it
[02:02:59] uh so we know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 nine 10 so
[02:03:03] I'm going to need you all to do this we
[02:03:06] like to use these things called AB
[02:03:08] Benji I don't know if you've ever heard
[02:03:10] of them before we play games here
[02:03:11] sometimes and then their games you might
[02:03:13] pick these up in a wasteland Adventure
[02:03:15] on the ground because you knock somebody
[02:03:16] over you know you kill one of your one
[02:03:18] of the mutants or something like that I
[02:03:20] don't know something like that but
[02:03:21] anyways
[02:03:22] you all are going to get one so the
[02:03:25] first person here since I'm going to go
[02:03:27] actually with the first person they
[02:03:28] jumped in was
[02:03:29] Nico give me a number between one and 20
[02:03:32] and the way I do it is I count one
[02:03:34] through that way and that's going to be
[02:03:36] your proxy that we have set up for
[02:03:38] you 13 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 now

[02:03:55] from like Disney Disney TV things we
[02:03:58] have random things that are in here all
[02:04:01] the way through like Star Trek could
[02:04:03] even be uh I think there's even a couple
[02:04:05] uh there might even be a a Power Rangers
[02:04:08] in there somewhere or there's or there's
[02:04:10] Anastasia or there's Anastasia something
[02:04:13] like that well we're going to put that

[02:04:16] you get your name written on Nico for
[02:04:18] their first One X i e n i k

[02:04:35] right next person
[02:04:37] is trust me there are random things in
[02:04:39] here I buy a bunch of random stuff from
[02:04:41] a couple people here all right not on
[02:04:44] here but on um from actually eBay just
[02:04:46] cheese packs and they come in random
[02:04:48] things they could be baseball sign of
[02:04:49] stuff so you've seen you'll see what
[02:04:50] you're talking about in a second Nico
[02:04:51] had the next one cuz you had spot one so
[02:04:53] you had another one here so going to be

[02:05:28] Kennedy assassination card in
[02:05:30] there Democrats thought it was a good
[02:05:32] idea to put that in there at one point
[02:05:34] when they were trying to um generate
[02:05:36] more um more I mean that's that's quite
[02:05:40] the wild card I'd have to say

Is this a simple game for people to play on my live whatnot show where I sell TCG packs/cards, etc?

### **Final Four Horsemen Derby: 5-Minute Auction Edition with Buyers Giveaway and Whatnot Compliance**

This final version of your **Four Horsemen Derby** is streamlined and fully compliant with Whatnot’s rules. The game keeps the excitement high through real-time bidding, progress bars, and open giveaways. It also incorporates a simple auction structure, designed to be easily understood and engaging for both new and experienced viewers.

---

### **Objective**:
Players support one of the Four Horsemen by purchasing Magic: The Gathering products through live auctions. The horseman whose **progress bar** fills the most during a **five-minute window** wins the race, determining the prize for the **Buyers Giveaway**. If multiple horsemen hit their progress goals, the Buyers Giveaway prize is **upgraded** accordingly. All viewers can enter the **Buyers Giveaway** for free via Whatnot's built-in giveaway system, ensuring compliance with Whatnot's **no-purchase-necessary** policy.

To maintain fairness, no horseman can win more than **10 consecutive spots**. After 10 consecutive winning bids for any horseman, the auction moves to the next horseman in rotation.

---

### **Horsemen and Spot Breakdown**:

1. **Conquest**:
   - **100 spots** (singles) at an average price of **$2.16**.
   - Conquest’s progress bar fills quickly with frequent, affordable purchases, making it attractive to casual players.

2. **War**:
   - **28 spots** (draft boosters) at an average price of **$7.57**.
   - War’s progress bar moves slower but with larger jumps per purchase, appealing to mid-tier bidders.

3. **Famine**:
   - **12 spots** (set boosters) at an average price of **$14.50**.
   - Famine’s bar moves with significant jumps per purchase, targeting higher-stakes bidders.

4. **Death**:
   - **9 spots** (collector boosters) at an average price of **$29.56**.
   - Death’s progress bar moves the slowest, but each purchase makes a substantial leap forward, appealing to premium buyers.

---

### **Gameplay Mechanics**:

#### **1. Time Limit**:
- Each derby lasts for **five minutes**, coinciding with the countdown for the **Buyers Giveaway**.
- Players bid on auctions to purchase spots and fill their chosen horseman’s progress bar.
- **No horseman can win more than 10 consecutive spots**. Once a horseman hits 10 consecutive wins, the auction moves to the next horseman in rotation to maintain balance.

#### **2. Progress Bars**:
- Each horseman’s progress bar fills in real-time as players win auctions. The horseman with the most progress at the end of five minutes wins the race.
- The **10-spot limit** ensures fairness and prevents any single horseman from monopolizing the race.

#### **3. Auction Rotation and 10-Spot Limit**:
- Auctions rotate between the four horsemen, with each auction lasting **5 seconds**. This ensures a fast-paced and competitive environment.
- Once a horseman reaches **10 consecutive winning spots**, the auction automatically shifts to the next horseman.

---

### **Buyers Giveaway and Prize Upgrades**:

1. **Primary Winner**: The horseman with the most progress at the end of the five-minute race wins, determining the **Buyers Giveaway** prize.
   
2. **Upgrade System**: If multiple horsemen hit their progress goals during the race, the prize for the **Buyers Giveaway** is upgraded. The more horsemen that reach their goal, the better the prize:
   - **1 Horseman Hits Goal**: Standard prize (e.g., singles bundle or draft booster).
   - **2 Horsemen Hit Goals**: Upgraded prize (e.g., set booster pack or higher-value singles).
   - **3 Horsemen Hit Goals**: Further upgraded prize (e.g., collector booster pack or premium item).
   - **All 4 Horsemen Hit Goals**: Maximum upgrade (e.g., multiple premium packs or high-value singles).

3. **Whatnot’s Built-in Giveaway System**: The **Buyers Giveaway** is run through Whatnot’s built-in system and is **open to all viewers** via form submission. This ensures compliance with Whatnot’s **no-purchase-necessary** rule, allowing everyone a chance to win without needing to bid.

---

### **Gameplay Flow**:

1. **Announce the Derby**:
   - Introduce the **Four Horsemen Derby** and explain that it runs for five minutes.
   - Display the **Buyers Giveaway prize** and explain how the prize can be **upgraded** if multiple horsemen hit their progress goals.
   - Emphasize the **10-spot limit**: no horseman can win more than 10 consecutive spots before the auction moves to the next horseman.

2. **Start the Auction Rotation**:
   - Begin the **Buyers Giveaway countdown** and rotate the auctions every **5 seconds** between the horsemen.
   - Implement the **10-spot rule**: once a horseman hits 10 consecutive wins, move to the next horseman.

3. **Live Updates and Commentary**:
   - Provide real-time updates on the race’s progress, calling out which horsemen are in the lead:
     - “Conquest is speeding ahead with singles, but Death just made a big leap with a collector booster purchase!”
   - Remind viewers that the **Buyers Giveaway prize** can be upgraded if multiple horsemen reach their goals.

4. **End of the Race**:
   - When the five-minute timer expires, the horseman with the most progress wins the race.
   - The **Buyers Giveaway** prize is awarded, and if additional horsemen hit their progress goals, the prize is upgraded accordingly.

---

### **Compliance with Whatnot’s TOS**:

1. **No Purchase Necessary**: The **Buyers Giveaway** is open to all viewers via form submission, ensuring compliance with Whatnot’s rules on **no-purchase-necessary** giveaways.
   
2. **Fair Bidding Practices**: The game remains compliant by avoiding **artificial price inflation** or encouraging unnecessary bidding. Bidders are encouraged to win auctions for the items themselves, with the progress bars and prize upgrades serving as secondary incentives.
   
3. **Transparency**: Ensure that the rules for upgrading prizes and determining winners are clearly communicated at the start of the derby, with frequent updates throughout the auction to keep all participants informed.

---

### **Why This Setup Works**:

1. **Clear, Simple Gameplay**: The auction structure is easy to follow, with visual progress bars showing each horseman’s status. The 10-spot limit keeps the race fair and balanced.
   
2. **Viewer Inclusivity**: The **Buyers Giveaway** is open to all viewers, allowing everyone to participate, even if they aren’t bidding. This increases engagement without violating Whatnot’s rules.

3. **Fast-Paced Excitement**: The 5-second auction rotation and five-minute time limit keep the game moving quickly, maintaining excitement throughout the stream.

4. **Engaging Incentives**: The prize upgrades tied to multiple horsemen hitting their goals keep the game competitive and fun, while also offering viewers something to root for beyond just winning the auction.

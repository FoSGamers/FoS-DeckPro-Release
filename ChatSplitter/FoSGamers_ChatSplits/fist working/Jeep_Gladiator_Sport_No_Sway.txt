Does it have rear lockers

[2024-07-08 12:16:16] ChatGPT:
The 2021 Jeep Gladiator Sport Max Tow does not come equipped with factory rear lockers. Rear lockers are typically a feature of the Rubicon trim. However, the Max Tow package does include a Trac-Lok limited-slip differential, which provides enhanced traction compared to a standard differential but does not offer the same level of off-road capability as a true locking differential.

If you want to add rear lockers, there are several aftermarket options available, such as the ARB Air Locker or the Eaton E-Locker, which can be installed to provide improved off-road performance. These installations generally involve additional costs and may require professional installation to ensure proper functionality【13†source】【14†source】【16†source】.

### Summary
1. The 2021 Jeep Gladiator Sport Max Tow does not have factory rear lockers.
2. It comes with a Trac-Lok limited-slip differential.
3. Aftermarket rear lockers can be installed for enhanced off-road capability.

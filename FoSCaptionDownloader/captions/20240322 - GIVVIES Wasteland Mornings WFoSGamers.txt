[00:15:55] that you coming on 84 oh yes 84 oh okay
[00:16:00] okay I get what you're saying you're

[00:16:16] hey Hunter how you doing hunt thanks
[00:16:19] coming in and I'm going to uh we're

[00:16:22] it looks like for you so let me know um
[00:16:25] if you want here what your character
[00:16:27] would like to be here you have that at
[00:16:29] the top you get to pick yeah uh I'm um
[00:16:33] I've come to the conclusion
[00:16:38] that it does not
[00:16:42] matter because I'm going to feel just as
[00:16:44] old now cuz I realized it was like last
[00:16:46] year I started feeling older and
[00:16:47] different things but I actually got
[00:16:48] really sick so I'm I'm attributing it to
[00:16:50] that not that I got old I'm attributing
[00:16:52] to that I got really sick and almost
[00:16:54] died so we're going to put a little uh
[00:16:57] why not this card's probably going to go
[00:17:00] up a lot over time but we're just going
[00:17:02] to put this one watchful rad stag foil

[00:18:07] num num num you go from through two up
[00:18:09] to three strength on your trip through
[00:18:11] this Wasteland great we like that
[00:18:14] awesome now as we go through we
[00:18:16] hopefully can find a friend along the
[00:18:18] way maybe it'll teach us something that
[00:18:20] can help us on our adventure through the
[00:18:22] Wasteland we shall see as we go we find
[00:18:26] a copy and that copy comes out to our
[00:18:30] buddy the mutant and goes hey buddy let
[00:18:32] me take a look at that food that you
[00:18:35] have there and he goes and looks at that
[00:18:37] food and goes friend come here come here
[00:18:39] friend copies that food turns it into
[00:18:42] two food for you so you know how four
[00:18:44] strength wandering through the Wasteland

[00:18:48] friend Hunter now we're going and we're
[00:18:51] going to see what we get for luck here
[00:18:53] at our end here maybe we find a friend
[00:18:55] along the way we're going to go with
[00:18:56] this one it's kind of sticking out seems
[00:18:58] like it would be a friend sticking out
[00:18:59] saying come play come play hang out with
[00:19:01] us all right you're wandering you're
[00:19:03] going feeling pretty strong you go they
[00:19:05] think there's something in the distance
[00:19:06] that's a friend of mine oh no I
[00:19:08] miscalculated that as a mutant goes my
[00:19:11] Mutant eyes didn't see correct that
[00:19:13] Warrior comes up swings his ax at you
[00:19:16] you drop your copy of food run away
[00:19:19] luckily the warrior just wanted the food
[00:19:21] does not care about what happen you
[00:19:23] still have three strength as you wander
[00:19:25] through the Wasteland here that's okay
[00:19:27] you see a vault in the distance you go
[00:19:28] you know what I see that Vault I see
[00:19:30] something in the vault I'm going to go
[00:19:30] over there and get something cool out of
[00:19:32] that Vault and you walk her over and
[00:19:34] what happens is right in front of you
[00:19:36] jumps
[00:19:37] out a boss we're going to go with this
[00:19:41] one that's kind of sticking out right
[00:19:43] there that boss jumps out and goes I'm
[00:19:46] going to take everything you have but
[00:19:49] you go no you're not you laugh at Owen
[00:19:52] you punch Owen in the back of the head
[00:19:54] as he goes riding by on his motorcycle
[00:19:56] thinking he's going to get something
[00:19:58] from you and this means you have now
[00:20:00] stolen Nolan's motorcycle you go riding
[00:20:04] easily over to the Vault and what that
[00:20:06] means is there is now a $1 Loot drop for
[00:20:09] all of you waight wastelanders here you
[00:20:11] wander into that Vault though and you
[00:20:13] see something cool in the vault in the
[00:20:15] back of that Vault you're nice and
[00:20:16] strong not having any problems you see
[00:20:17] something in the distance and it happens
[00:20:18] to be in the
[00:20:20] safe a pack of cards from 95 you get
[00:20:23] some VR Troopers puzzle pack card now we
[00:20:28] can open that if you want that is what
[00:20:29] was in there for your Vault pack at the
[00:20:31] time I guess somebody thought that was
[00:20:33] important enough they needed a safe save
[00:20:36] back in the day before the uh world came
[00:20:38] to an end some pack of cards from 95 and
[00:20:42] now what we do because we had a Loot
[00:20:44] drop we have that $1 go up there I
[00:20:46] wonder that was a pretty decent beat
[00:20:48] down because you know a mutant comes out
[00:20:50] and a mutant can hurt something I feel
[00:20:52] like I always had a hard time fighting
[00:20:53] mutants when I was in the Wasteland
[00:20:55] after you when especially with only a
[00:20:56] little bit of strength so what we're
[00:20:58] going to do here is we're going to
[00:21:03] do we're going to do this as The Loot
[00:21:05] drop I think I'm going to um we're going
[00:21:08] to do this as The Loot drop here that's
[00:21:10] what we'll do we'll do that as The Loot
[00:21:12] drop right
[00:21:13] now
[00:21:15] um or yeah why not we'll start this as
[00:21:19] The Loot drop we'll start this is the
[00:21:20] first one of the day this is the first
[00:21:22] one of the day we're not going to start
[00:21:24] off with one with just a couple of those
[00:21:26] things that's this is better than that
[00:21:28] we're going to do our Loot drop we're
[00:21:29] going to do our Loot drop here all right
[00:21:31] this is going to start out at a dollar
[00:21:32] here now when I start these at a dollar

[00:21:36] a couple minutes that way I have the

[00:46:48] I'm just putting them
[00:46:50] up will bought a will asked to have a
[00:46:52] game yesterday he asked to buy a game on
[00:46:55] um not bad buddy Friday's going all
[00:46:59] right the boys are home because um they
[00:47:01] are on vacation starting today I thought
[00:47:03] it started next week does what today's
[00:47:06] teacher Duty day all right so it does
[00:47:08] start next week I didn't miscalculate
[00:47:10] all right I got screwed out of a teacher
[00:47:12] that's what happened teachers screwed me
[00:47:13] out of their day Duty day that's and
[00:47:15] trust me I used to be a teacher I know
[00:47:16] what a teacher Duty day is I was a
[00:47:18] teacher for a whole year um and I also
[00:47:21] did long-term subbing for three years
[00:47:23] until I became a teacher so uh yeah most
[00:47:27] of the time it's messing around and you
[00:47:29] have like an hour maybe two of meetings
[00:47:30] of some kind and then the rest of it was
[00:47:32] messing around unless that changed in
[00:47:34] the past 20 years which I suspect it
[00:47:36] hasn't so here we go this is going to be
[00:47:39] a a 41 there we'll get that up there I
[00:47:42] mean I love teachers I have two friends
[00:47:44] that are teachers um I like I said I
[00:47:46] used to be a teacher I have no problems
[00:47:48] with them it's just sometimes I laugh at
[00:47:50] what people consider certain things like
[00:47:52] I've been there buddy I I know what goes
[00:47:55] on I don't know but about
[00:48:01] that my favorite is when I used to they
[00:48:03] did teacher Duty days and I was the one
[00:48:04] that was training him because I went to
[00:48:06] work for a software company that sold
[00:48:07] software to the schools to that track
[00:48:11] children um that's what I after I
[00:48:12] stopped doing teaching
[00:48:14] stuff and those teachers were wildly
[00:48:18] inappropriate during their teacher Duty
[00:48:20] days and valeno all right we're going
[00:48:23] with this you got your character also
[00:48:25] you can choose since you did the way an
[00:48:27] adventure have you seen this played
[00:48:28] before eneno if you have not you choose
[00:48:31] one of the characters at the top we do a
[00:48:32] little animated
[00:48:33] adventure and you see if you like it all
[00:48:36] right so you do a little animated
[00:48:37] Adventure here when you we we save this
[00:48:39] this is two strength on your adventure
[00:48:41] what happens is you go wander through
[00:48:42] the Wasteland and there's three things
[00:48:44] that you pull from there's a red green
[00:48:46] and a blue box each one of them have are
[00:48:48] plus or minus to your strength for your
[00:48:50] character as you wander through the
[00:48:51] Wasteland so you can choose like
[00:48:53] whatever character wants so you want to
[00:48:54] be like a mutant you can wander through
[00:48:56] the Wasteland as a mutant then you look
[00:48:58] for certain items luckily pulling them
[00:48:59] out or not and then at the end if you
[00:49:01] battle a boss and win you end up um we
[00:49:04] end up doing a $1 Loot drop for the
[00:49:06] entire Wasteland here for something that
[00:49:07] gets dropped for the loot and you also
[00:49:10] though no matter what every time even
[00:49:12] whether you win or L lose you always
[00:49:13] find your way to a vault where you find

[00:50:40] try to shake out a little different all
[00:50:41] right here we go let's see what we get
[00:50:43] here maybe we get some luck for you
[00:50:44] we're wandering through this Wasteland
[00:50:45] as a mutant you see something a little
[00:50:47] bit in the distance you stop and you go
[00:50:49] hm wonderful I have found some food I
[00:50:51] thought that was something that was
[00:50:52] going to help me you start munching away
[00:50:55] on that food go num num num num get
[00:50:58] yourself nice and big and strong you go
[00:50:59] from two to three strength as you wander
[00:51:02] through the Wasteland then let's let's
[00:51:04] do this here let's see if I can get one
[00:51:05] of the more of the front ones here this
[00:51:06] time oh maybe maybe no oh kind of
[00:51:10] randomish no the front middle-ish one
[00:51:13] whatever that's not bad we'll see what
[00:51:15] we get here all right here we go we're
[00:51:17] going to pull this out we're going to
[00:51:18] see do we have any luck as we wander
[00:51:19] through you're strong with your with
[00:51:22] your food maybe we can find a friend to
[00:51:24] help you and look at that as a mute
[00:51:27] you see this friend in the distance and
[00:51:28] that friend goes hey buddy come here
[00:51:30] come here come here let me help you I
[00:51:32] see that food you got there if I can
[00:51:33] copy that food I can take a copy for
[00:51:35] myself and you get get one can I do that
[00:51:37] and now you have two food wandering
[00:51:39] through this Wasteland and you're at
[00:51:40] four strength awesome this is great
[00:51:44] wonderful nice big and strong let's see
[00:51:48] what goes on here maybe we get some luck
[00:51:50] maybe we find a friend along your way
[00:51:52] we're going to go with that one cuz that
[00:51:53] one was kind of sticking out maybe we
[00:51:56] find a friend along the way whether your
[00:51:57] mutant you looking for the fungus
[00:51:59] dinosaur he is your friend in this
[00:52:02] Wasteland so you find oh no an enemy
[00:52:07] does come flying
[00:52:09] by you see this thoter come diving down
[00:52:12] towards you you drop one of your food
[00:52:14] run away luckily the thror was just
[00:52:16] searching for food for its friend and
[00:52:18] now you all only have three strength as
[00:52:20] you wander through the Wasteland that is
[00:52:23] okay with your three strength you can
[00:52:24] actually still beat two two of the three
[00:52:27] bosses I mean two of the 10 bosses
[00:52:30] there's six of them you could
[00:52:31] potentially beat with the highest amount
[00:52:33] of Point strength you have but right now
[00:52:34] you only have two you could potentially
[00:52:36] beat with your three strength so we're
[00:52:38] going to do random like you said again
[00:52:39] here and we're going to go with this one
[00:52:41] we try to go along quicker here and
[00:52:43] let's see what happens we wander you see
[00:52:44] a vault in the distance is IM mutant you
[00:52:46] go wandering towards that Vault but out
[00:52:47] in front of you PPS the incinerator you
[00:52:50] oh no the incinerator drops down you
[00:52:52] drop your food he burns that food but
[00:52:54] luckily that's the only thing he was
[00:52:56] accurate some type of food you go jump
[00:52:58] into that Vault and in that Vault you
[00:53:00] dive in you wander to the back and in
[00:53:02] that back you see a pack of cards from
[00:53:04] 1993 that is the Valiant error somebody
[00:53:09] thought that needed to be saved and a
[00:53:13] safe and that's where it is that's what
[00:53:16] you get for your Vault pack there we can
[00:53:18] rip that open I'm sorry we did not have
[00:53:21] the boss come in you did not have a beat
[00:53:22] a win from the boss there but you did
[00:53:24] get another little pack extra something
[00:53:27] cool and why is it freezing so much
[00:53:30] here all right I know why it's freezing
[00:53:32] so much I have a million people playing
[00:53:34] watching TV and playing games noan what
[00:53:36] are you doing bud turn that down a

[00:53:45] fun so that's what we do here you know
[00:53:49] sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't
[00:53:50] sometimes people like it sometimes it
[00:53:53] goes too long and sometimes I make try
[00:53:54] to make it quicker we're going to rip
[00:53:56] them all
[00:53:57] I'm sorry I don't know why it's hanging
[00:53:58] a little bit here my guess is because I

[01:16:47] wandering through I think it's whatnot
[01:16:48] actually cuz I'm breaking up a little
[01:16:49] bit again you go wandering through here
[01:16:52] again and we're going to do random as we
[01:16:53] did before we're going to pick that one
[01:16:55] we're hopefully going to find a friend
[01:16:57] as we wander through this Wasteland here
[01:16:59] a friend that will help us but oh no
[01:17:03] down comes diving a Thro there towards
[01:17:05] you you dive away your en your soldier
[01:17:08] friend says I'll take care of this you
[01:17:10] go running away with three strength
[01:17:12] through this Wasteland you see a vault
[01:17:13] in the distance and you go I'm going to
[01:17:15] go safely into that Vault get away from
[01:17:16] this Wasteland but as you go get ready
[01:17:19] around that corner get to the Vault you
[01:17:21] see a boss that boss come charging
[01:17:24] toward you thinking they have got the
[01:17:26] day one and out in front of you comes oh
[01:17:30] that's why he comes charging towards you
[01:17:31] it's a giant
[01:17:33] Triceratops trampling through the
[01:17:35] Wasteland as they come toward you no one
[01:17:38] cares you dive quickly into the Vault
[01:17:41] away from it luckily safe in the
[01:17:43] distance this the Triceratop goes
[01:17:46] running by you and as that happens you
[01:17:48] see some rumbling and in that rumbling
[01:17:50] opens a safe that safe in the distance
[01:17:53] out drops a pack of cards from 94 and it
[01:17:56] is the creators universe that's what you
[01:18:00] got there from your Vault pack but you
[01:18:02] know what I think I think there's going
[01:18:04] to be a Loot drop right now because when
[01:18:08] there's a big bass boss that goes by
[01:18:11] rumbling their Wasteland and they knock
[01:18:12] stuff over a lot of times they knock
[01:18:15] things over that no one saw before and
[01:18:18] now they have a potential of uh there's
[01:18:20] some Loop that's going to be dropped for
[01:18:21] a dollar so what we're going to do here
[01:18:24] is I am going to put up a pack for a
[01:18:27] dollar here we're going to put up this
[01:18:30] to start out as a dollar and I'm

[01:18:42] our loot pack

[01:18:47] not do sudden death on these ones I run
[01:18:50] it generally for a couple minutes that
[01:18:52] way I can open stuff up but since we got
[01:18:53] three packs I'm actually going to do
[01:18:54] three minutes 1 minute each we're going

[03:14:50] the uh like a month or so ago then this
[03:14:52] stuck in my head and I'm like that's
[03:14:53] exactly what it is that magic cards
[03:14:56] fluctuate like gold I'm like they do
[03:14:59] exactly that they are so hard to
[03:15:02] follow there we go we're going to put
[03:15:05] that away
[03:15:07] there and we are going to see what we do
[03:15:10] here put that in there and thank you

[03:15:13] sleeved up and protected for shipping
[03:15:16] everybody that guy Stu for me knows I
[03:15:18] kind of go a little bit over the top
[03:15:19] sometimes how does a Blue Book work I
[03:15:21] will explain it for you I will
[03:15:23] definitely explain the blue book and
[03:15:26] you're going to do another one of those
[03:15:27] I'm going to explain the blue book here
[03:15:29] quickly okay and you're going with one
[03:15:31] more I did see that I'm just going to
[03:15:32] give a quick look so we spin there's a
[03:15:34] wheel that goes up and it has numbers 1
[03:15:37] through 81 which is actually now down we
[03:15:39] have I think this 74 spots so there's
[03:15:41] only one through well not one through 74
[03:15:43] but 74 numbers that are available in
[03:15:45] there the wheel spins and you land on

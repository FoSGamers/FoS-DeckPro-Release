[00:44:48] one go that
[00:44:53] works yeah take a look
[00:44:58] yeah it is you got a pistol and a knife
[00:44:59] though so you guys go to explore all
[00:45:02] right now none of you have any luck so
[00:45:04] we're going to do a 5050 now since uh we
[00:45:07] have our buddy
[00:45:16] uh here we go couple of those
[00:45:29] heads all
[00:45:31] right oh but that was
[00:45:36] horrible let's see where we go oh no
[00:45:38] it's Tails that's not good you go
[00:45:42] in you start looking
[00:45:45] around and what happens is you find
[00:45:52] yourself in a
[00:45:54] room all right
[00:46:06] now once you're in that room though the
[00:46:08] problem
[00:46:12] is behind you you hear some
[00:46:16] shuffling you made it in this room you
[00:46:18] start looking around and exploring the
[00:46:22] skyscraper but you heard some shuffling
[00:46:24] in the background
[00:46:28] you turn
[00:46:32] around when you turn
[00:46:35] around you see standing in the doorway a
[00:46:40] Raider getting ready to draw their
[00:46:44] weapon now there's two of you you're
[00:46:47] lucky so you're going to get a couple
[00:46:49] you guys uh what are you guys going to
[00:46:50] decide to do you want to attack you want
[00:46:53] to could try to uh jump out the building
[00:46:55] I mean you're only on the first floor so
[00:46:57] you could try to potentially run and
[00:46:58] jump
[00:47:00] out maybe you would like some uh
[00:47:04] perks to go with your
[00:47:08] adventuring a buff some skills you got
[00:47:11] to let us know you see that room there
[00:47:13] you turn it around in the room and you
[00:47:15] happen to see that mediumsized Raider
[00:47:18] can you reason with the Raider well you
[00:47:20] can try to they're getting ready to
[00:47:22] shoot
[00:47:23] though do you have any Charisma
[00:47:25] currently you don't have any charisma
[00:47:27] you do not have any charisma at the
[00:47:29] moment so you got to decide what you
[00:47:32] want to
[00:47:34] do can kind of like run away try to talk
[00:47:38] to
[00:47:38] him you want to reason with him that's
[00:47:41] what we'll do hey skrs thanks coming in
[00:47:43] scrill
[00:47:47] kills you have that critical at any time
[00:47:52] true you
[00:47:55] can and then we got for you my
[00:48:04] friend oh all right I like it you say oh

[00:48:20] knife your try to use your assault rifle
[00:48:23] he said

[00:48:26] with a with a pistol right that'll be
[00:48:28] easier to get out
[00:48:29] to and then we're going to get a uh you
[00:48:32] have to have a uh 13 or higher to hit
[00:48:36] all right we'll get a 17 well that
[00:48:39] works that works 17 and you get three
[00:48:42] you hit
[00:48:44] them and then you're going to go for
[00:48:47] your pistol too I like
[00:48:49] it and oh no that's a two you miss when
[00:48:52] you go for your pistol bang spell you
[00:48:55] get him he he doesn't like that he gets
[00:48:57] both of his out both of his pistols out
[00:49:00] and he shoots and he misses he gets an
[00:49:02] 11 he needed a 13 to hit you wow you

[00:49:10] me get out the homunculus horde for our
[00:49:13] friend scrill
[00:49:15] kills because you my friend also got a
[00:49:18] rat away scrill kills you decided

[00:50:03] plus you have a rad
[00:50:12] removal all right well we're going to go
[00:50:14] past that one we're going to just say
[00:50:17] that character oh you're going to try
[00:50:19] stab no I like it all right try and stab
[00:50:21] him we're going to go with that one
[00:50:23] there's a little uh and you get them for
[00:50:25] an 18 you stab the side you only get a
[00:50:28] small hit on him that Raider though
[00:50:31] doesn't like what's going on does not
[00:50:33] like getting stabbed so many times he
[00:50:35] goes I'm getting out of
[00:50:37] here he turns and he fleas oh you're
[00:50:40] going to use the
[00:50:41] critical ah I didn't know you were using
[00:50:44] the critical okay critical hit oh all
[00:50:46] right you going to use the critical on
[00:50:47] them so here we go all right that means
[00:50:49] we need to do a uh multiplier on your
[00:50:52] damage so you guaranteed a hit with the
[00:50:54] knife and we do a multiplier on your
[00:50:56] damage damage I'm sorry I didn't know
[00:50:58] you were using the critical on this one
[00:51:00] so you get a one out of four for your
[00:51:01] multiplier it's a guaranteed hit and
[00:51:04] then you get your one for your knife
[00:51:06] ground you must have hit him right in
[00:51:09] heart cuz he falls down
[00:51:11] dead look at that one
[00:51:14] king look at that one king I like it my
[00:51:19] friend so you guys are uh you stabed
[00:51:22] them there they lean
[00:51:24] over and you decide you're going to want
[00:51:26] uh loot that guy I'm guessing
[00:51:32] right now you loot all right W you're
[00:51:36] looking and while you're looking on them
[00:51:38] you find some assault rifle
[00:51:40] ammo you also
[00:51:43] find eight pogs here which is our
[00:51:45] Wasteland currency now do you want to
[00:51:47] split any King with your health pack and
[00:51:50] your Jace for the secret lair oo nice
[00:51:53] some secret lirer coming for you a
[00:51:55] secret layer card let me get that out
[00:51:57] you get your health pack too now what
[00:52:00] are you going to do with your uh your
[00:52:02] stuff
[00:52:11] there there's your Jace right
[00:52:18] there so you have a you have uh assault
[00:52:22] rifle ammo pistol ammo an extra pistol
[00:52:27] and eight
[00:52:34] pogs don't know why I wrote your name
[00:52:36] down on that I already have a bag with
[00:52:38] your
[00:52:49] name g NAA
[00:53:04] all right AR and
[00:53:08] then AR
[00:53:12] for all right so you AR ammo for spell
[00:53:17] with the rifle all right there we
[00:53:19] go spell is going to get the AR and the
[00:53:22] rifle
[00:53:29] and you actually have uh a second
[00:53:31] rifle so that's times
[00:53:34] two for your rifles for a spell King you
[00:53:39] want to take the pistol so you have two
[00:53:44] pistols and you got yourself um that
[00:53:47] also gives you 18 rounds and you can
[00:53:49] dual wield the pistols
[00:53:51] now both of you going to take three um
[00:53:55] so that gives you four and

[00:55:02] you guys need to go to a safe haven
[00:55:05] maybe you want to trade something
[00:55:06] because you can only have so many items
[00:55:08] in your inventory you're only allowed
[00:55:10] seven items in your inventory you know
[00:55:12] if you have two ARS you can't dual wield
[00:55:14] ARS so maybe you want to trade an AR or
[00:55:16] maybe you want to trade one of your
[00:55:18] pistols I don't know it's a wasteland uh
[00:55:20] the safe
[00:55:22] havens as you're wandering around they
[00:55:26] turn around that skyscaper in the room
[00:55:28] there you wander some
[00:55:31] further uh just this right now cuz uh I
[00:55:34] had a full break the other day and we
[00:55:36] didn't go through it so I was just doing
[00:55:37] this for a short while these are like
[00:55:39] the uh yeah so I I was going to do one
[00:55:41] if we have a plan like say tomorrow I
[00:55:44] can try to do one tomorrow uh morning is
[00:55:47] uh it's earlier in the morning and I can
[00:55:49] do a break where we'll do like kind of
[00:55:51] like a longer form whole raid thing if
[00:55:54] that's what you guys are interested in
[00:55:56] I know I had that yesterday and we did
[00:55:58] it um but no one the people that were in
[00:56:01] there I think they left when they they
[00:56:02] got upset long story short we did a
[00:56:05] break and one of the packs was a Fallout
[00:56:08] collector booster pack and out so out of
[00:56:10] that pack was pulled the
[00:56:13] um twinflame Tyrant shattered
[00:56:16] foil so one out of the six people got it
[00:56:19] and the rest of them I think got really
[00:56:21] annoyed and they left when they didn't
[00:56:22] get it so everybody disappeared except
[00:56:25] for the person that got the card so yeah
[00:56:28] that's where I was at yesterday so we
[00:56:30] didn't do our raid yesterday so we can
[00:56:32] do another one kind of like that and

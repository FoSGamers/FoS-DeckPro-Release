[00:00:23] earlier how you hope you having a good
[00:00:25] day there I was guessing you fell asleep
[00:00:27] or something like that you happens you
[00:00:28] know I do it myself
[00:00:30] uh how's it going Brandon thanks coming
[00:00:31] in Let's uh you know let's get um I was
[00:00:35] talking about about the pick your own
[00:00:36] break what we're doing here is um I just
[00:00:38] have these they're just you know numbers
[00:00:40] one through 10 here to see who uh what
[00:00:42] you get if you do up to 10 people I
[00:00:44] guess but
[00:00:46] um what is going on with the
[00:00:53] music why did you just disconnect that's
[00:00:58] weird
[00:01:00] just disconnected well what we're doing
[00:01:02] here with the pick your own break is um
[00:01:04] you can pick whatever you want if you
[00:01:05] want uh for between any of you people
[00:01:08] come in and hang out want to do
[00:01:13] um you how many people you want to do
[00:01:15] the break with um and when what you do
[00:01:18] is um we uh we'll do a little break for
[00:01:20] you and well you could do it between
[00:01:22] like I said between two you and your one
[00:01:23] buddy you want do um say you both want
[00:01:26] to get one pack of something and you
[00:01:28] want to try your luck on on uh the split
[00:01:31] and doing uh every other one between the
[00:01:33] two of you is how you want to do the
[00:01:34] break that's what we'll do and we'll
[00:01:36] just use our cards here to side uh you
[00:01:38] know it's 1 through 10 which is there
[00:01:39] and if you do the break every time you
[00:01:40] do the break one of the things if you
[00:01:42] want to do those uh what I was going to
[00:01:44] do is we have our our vault packs we put
[00:01:48] them um our vault packs in the envelopes
[00:01:49] here so you can pick a few one of them
[00:01:51] whenever you do a break you get one of
[00:01:53] the Vault packs also kind of like saying
[00:01:55] thank you for hanging out with us and
[00:01:57] doing the break there so that's what I
[00:01:59] was kind of thinking we could try
[00:02:00] something a little different cuz people
[00:02:02] like doing them sometimes we can't get a
[00:02:03] a lot of them going so I figured we'll
[00:02:05] do like a pick your own you pick pick
[00:02:07] your size tell us what you want out of
[00:02:08] what I got available I'll throw it up
[00:02:10] there because you see the prices of
[00:02:12] everything that I have and uh that would
[00:02:14] we go that would how we
[00:02:16] go hopefully your Sunday though is going
[00:02:18] all right we're just getting things up
[00:02:20] and
[00:02:21] running let me make sure I can hear
[00:02:24] everything CU I'm wondering if you can
[00:02:26] and cannot hear me right
[00:02:28] now
[00:02:33] can you hear me I heard I heard
[00:02:38] yep you can hear me all
[00:02:42] right doing that then going back to the
[00:02:47] music there we
[00:02:49] go not frozen we're good there awesome I
[00:02:53] like it I like it well thank you Brandon
[00:02:56] and Jupiter coming and hanging out do
[00:02:58] appreciate it I'll get um so what I'll
[00:03:01] do kind of like what my thought was
[00:03:02] there was say for instance somebody
[00:03:04] wanted to
[00:03:06] do so you guys wanted to do uh between
[00:03:09] you and your
[00:03:10] buddies you mainly wanted to do some um
[00:03:13] Al drains cuz you wanted to get uh some
[00:03:16] me you and your friend you wanted to get
[00:03:17] some Al drains but maybe you all both
[00:03:19] wanted to try to get something out of a
[00:03:21] uh your collector booster here so we do
[00:03:23] our break where these would be split up
[00:03:25] and then this would split up every other
[00:03:27] card after they were shuffled something
[00:03:29] like that
[00:03:31] um after I mean every every other card
[00:03:33] we open up it goes every other
[00:03:35] cardb um depending on who comes out
[00:03:37] first with what they pick for their
[00:03:39] number based on one two three four five
[00:03:43] 6 my sev's over there eight nine or 10
[00:03:47] so that's what I was thinking we'd do if
[00:03:48] you want to do stuff like that for your
[00:03:50] pick your own break type thing that way
[00:03:52] you can pick as many as much as you want
[00:03:54] or as little as you want I don't
[00:03:58] know yes yes I can put you in the bin
[00:04:00] and pay first now did you want now the
[00:04:02] thing we were waiting on was I didn't
[00:04:04] know if you wanted the
[00:04:07] um the
[00:04:14] um commander deck too did you want the
[00:04:16] commander deck CU if we take that out um
[00:04:19] or or um it would end up being
[00:04:25] um 25 for all the cards all right take
[00:04:29] the commander deck out y you do want the
[00:04:30] commander deck all right so it was 80
[00:04:32] for it was 80 with the commander deck
[00:04:33] and the cards so let me get those off to
[00:04:36] the side and it was
[00:04:38] the
[00:04:40] um Scrappy survivors you wanted right
[00:04:43] there and I'll will put that up with
[00:04:45] your name on it I'll put it in the bu
[00:04:46] now with your name on it just say it's

[00:10:35] we you know they have to do those things
[00:10:36] and you just pick out what you have for
[00:10:38] your number there and uh that's how the
[00:10:40] break goes or you do the
[00:10:42] adventure hey how you doing how been
[00:10:45] how's it been how's it been my tongue
[00:10:48] isn't working well right
[00:10:51] now you got a new little uh new little
[00:10:53] game we or gamish thing we got going or
[00:10:55] trying to do how's your uh how's your
[00:10:57] Sunday going so are I know for me we are
[00:11:01] um a little bit I don't know a little
[00:11:04] late I feel like I I feel like today
[00:11:07] just like not working right I don't know
[00:11:09] one of those days like um I was told
[00:11:12] when I was younger by one of my teachers
[00:11:14] when you P wake up and you try you go to
[00:11:17] tie your tie and if you can't tie it on
[00:11:19] the third time you might as well just go
[00:11:21] back to bed because today your day is
[00:11:22] going to be horrible cuz your um hand
[00:11:25] eye coordination is so off you're just
[00:11:26] going to have so many
[00:11:28] problems
[00:11:31] let's throw some ixon up
[00:11:33] here oh nice it's about to get off work
[00:11:35] yeah tired I understand
[00:11:38] that you want to do a break all
[00:11:42] right well you can't choose number four
[00:11:45] what we do the reason I do randomized is
[00:11:47] that um you would be the first one to
[00:11:48] pick the number is what it would
[00:11:52] be so like if you get a couple of people
[00:11:54] together you can do your little break
[00:11:56] there and say you want to do certain
[00:11:57] amount of things whatever it is is and
[00:11:59] that's what I was thinking yeah if that
[00:12:00] makes sense you have to have a break is
[00:12:02] between more than one person that's why
[00:12:05] I was saying that
[00:12:08] yeah so that's what I was saying and if
[00:12:10] you want to I mean if you want to you
[00:12:12] could do it I guess we could just do it
[00:12:13] by yourself it wouldn't really matter
[00:12:15] and you just uh if you just wanted to
[00:12:17] buy the four and then You' get uh if you
[00:12:19] want to do it alone and buy a certain
[00:12:21] amount of them and then you would just
[00:12:22] get the pack the uh the the the one up
[00:12:25] top there yeah I guess we could do that
[00:12:28] I've never actually thought of doing
[00:12:29] that way but that could be done I guess
[00:12:31] that could be done I guess all right
[00:12:33] we're going to put up a b one then we're
[00:12:35] going to put up a
[00:12:36] um a we'll put up an adventure and then
[00:12:39] we'll put up
[00:12:41] um a giby here for those that like to
[00:12:43] hang out and we'll see if there's any um
[00:12:46] any singles I can keep putting out here
[00:12:47] for you
[00:12:49] all and now the way that I was going to
[00:12:51] do oh I didn't put the notes in
[00:12:55] oh give me one
[00:12:58] second now the way I was thinking of
[00:13:01] doing this for the break here I want to
[00:13:02] make sure you guys are okay with this
[00:13:04] because it's the first time I'm trying
[00:13:10] it I do not have a scorched ruins I do
[00:13:15] not I do not have a Scorch ruin sadly
[00:13:19] I'm thinking um if I know anybody that
[00:13:22] might
[00:13:27] h i
[00:13:30] can't think of anyone Mike's at the
[00:13:32] store he might if you might want to ask
[00:13:34] him um over with uh tap and roll I think
[00:13:38] he's at the store right now all right so
[00:13:39] what I was doing with the breakes um the
[00:13:42] way I was trying to do something a
[00:13:43] little bit different was like with say
[00:13:44] know people do breaks all the time you
[00:13:46] have to have anywhere you know six
[00:13:47] people in the spot whatever to open
[00:13:48] something I was figur I could do a pick
[00:13:49] your own pick your size you already know
[00:13:51] what the price of all my stuff is for
[00:13:52] the most part because I always show it
[00:13:53] available I'm not hiding anything that's
[00:13:55] why I got it up there at the my pointing
[00:13:57] I'm pointing that's why it's up there so
[00:13:59] that's why I'm like saying Well what
[00:14:00] we'll do is um you'll pick whatever you
[00:14:04] want say you want to set it at uh the
[00:14:06] two of you want to go in on something
[00:14:08] and say you both want um ion but you
[00:14:11] want to try your luck on only one of you
[00:14:12] want to say you want to do a break you
[00:14:13] want to break between the one of those
[00:14:15] and say you do um I don't know say each
[00:14:19] you each do two of these you pick which
[00:14:22] ones you want obviously you'll um the
[00:14:25] way we choose the number is I kind of
[00:14:27] like the wheel you know randomize but
[00:14:29] instead it's through the cards which I
[00:14:31] have over here which are numbered 1 2 3
[00:14:35] 4 5 6 my seven is right here actually
[00:14:38] eight nine and 10 and you just pick one
[00:14:41] after I shuffle them up and then uh what
[00:14:44] we do is we put those under IR on in in
[00:14:47] here and we put your card down depending
[00:14:49] on which one it is back and forth or if
[00:14:51] there's three one two three um or say
[00:14:54] there's more of you and there's ends up
[00:14:55] being like 10 of you that want to do a
[00:14:56] whole box we can do a color break or I
[00:14:58] mean Ian a break or we could do a color
[00:15:00] break however you want you pick
[00:15:01] whichever one you want you tell me what
[00:15:03] you want to do and we'll break it that
[00:15:04] way we could do a color break a digit
[00:15:06] break or just a break between two of you
[00:15:09] where we do you pick your car you pick
[00:15:10] your packs and then we do it that way or
[00:15:12] you pick the break C then we do back and
[00:15:14] forth whatever youd like that's kind of
[00:15:15] what I trying to say to choose your own
[00:15:22] thing but that's what I was explaining
[00:15:26] there anyways I'll put up my adventure
[00:15:28] game try it something out new a little
[00:15:30] bit if anybody wants it maybe maybe not
[00:15:33] but there you go that was my thought
[00:15:37] process so um but we'll be putting up
[00:15:40] some of the things that we have here
[00:15:41] hanging out with you all maybe find
[00:15:43] something for um something do for a
[00:15:45] little bit of a giveaway and a little
[00:15:46] bit here um like I normally do each day
[00:15:50] actually you know what why not put
[00:15:51] something up a little old right
[00:15:53] now that I'll start out one of it
[00:15:55] probably I'll probably start it out with
[00:15:57] that something from back in the day
[00:16:00] nothing special for something from back
[00:16:01] in the day though but let's put up
[00:16:03] something like this to do
[00:16:06] it a nasal drip with allergies down here
[00:16:09] killing
[00:16:11] me let's put this
[00:16:14] up for your adventure in the Wasteland
[00:16:21] maybe you guys can choose what you want
[00:16:24] too I don't need to always choose
[00:16:27] this you you can choose one yourself if
[00:16:30] You' like
[00:16:31] yes uh you can do a break yourself or
[00:16:34] something like that if You' like I have
[00:16:35] no problem with that so what I'll do

[00:21:05] go should be right
[00:21:09] there and
[00:21:12] there and there you go so what you can
[00:21:16] do there is if you want to choose you
[00:21:18] want to try to do anything wise we'll
[00:21:19] just open obviously we'll just break
[00:21:20] them open but you obviously get your
[00:21:22] choice up there we'll rip some stuff for
[00:21:24] you and see what you get all
[00:21:27] right
[00:21:29] there's the four of them there which are
[00:21:33] two Forgotten Realms in the two Wilds
[00:21:35] drain for

[00:21:47] go
[00:21:49] so which ones do you want to do your
[00:21:51] first
[00:21:56] here oh it looks like there was an issue
[00:21:58] there don't worry about it we'll take
[00:21:59] you can take your sa time figure that
[00:22:02] out all right sometimes things happen
[00:22:06] with banks I run into
[00:22:27] it no it didn't that's what I was saying
[00:22:29] it didn't go through just double check
[00:22:31] uh for whatever reason all right I I'll
[00:22:34] put these off to the side for you okay
[00:22:36] and then I mean we know we have it there
[00:22:38] and we'll do uh we'll get some good luck
[00:22:39] for you I'll put these right right over
[00:22:41] here all right because I think you
[00:22:43] should be able to see where I'm putting
[00:22:44] them right
[00:22:45] here yeah those are right there for you
[00:22:49] okay yeah just take your time figure it
[00:22:51] out I have issues all the time myself oh
[00:22:54] let me just make sure I plug this in so
[00:22:57] I don't have any issues with it there
[00:22:58] you
[00:23:05] go I know what you're talking about
[00:23:07] there uh so I've been in those positions
[00:23:09] where you like you see something you
[00:23:10] like I don't want to do anything what do
[00:23:11] I do
[00:23:16] now all right so I'm going to put up a
[00:23:19] another one of our while I wait for this
[00:23:21] we'll put up a uh we'll put up an
[00:23:23] adventure game or you can do your one of
[00:23:24] your own break things if you want pick
[00:23:26] your own break the way I've been doing
[00:23:27] it and if you want to jumping with a
[00:23:29] couple of people the way I was figuring
[00:23:31] you can do it is you can choose if you
[00:23:32] want to do a color a digit or if you
[00:23:34] just want to do between prep say there's
[00:23:35] only two of you and you both want to try
[00:23:37] some mic Coria but you want to go uh F
[00:23:40] you know back and forth on Lord of the
[00:23:43] Rings we uh what we do is we draw one of
[00:23:47] our cards which is between one and 10
[00:23:49] and whoever has the highest because you
[00:23:50] know it's like a wheel we'll be able to
[00:23:52] pick first whether they want to go first
[00:23:53] or second on the cars being put on their
[00:23:56] side if that's what you want to do or if
[00:23:58] you want to to do you know even or odds
[00:24:00] for your numbers or whatever it is what
[00:24:02] you want to do in the break that's what
[00:24:03] you choose or if you want to do say you
[00:24:05] want to do um six or seven of you people
[00:24:07] you got a bunch of your friends together
[00:24:08] and you want to do them all but that's
[00:24:09] how I was figuring we do a pick your own
[00:24:11] break that way you can kind of do
[00:24:12] whatever you want we don't need to have
[00:24:14] you don't need to have like 50 people in
[00:24:16] here you can have three in here if three
[00:24:19] of you want to do a break and you all
[00:24:20] just want to do that so that's why I was
[00:24:22] thinking we'd have uh some fun there but
[00:24:24] let's put up some my corer right now cuz
[00:24:26] I like trying to get triom here I like
[00:24:28] troms I don't know why I'm a big fan of
[00:24:30] troms I like how they look I think they
[00:24:33] did a really good job with the um with
[00:24:35] the art on them let me get this up here
[00:24:38] for an adventure game for those of you
[00:24:40] that may want it and this is a cheap one
[00:24:43] here not too bad and what you do see is
[00:24:46] you do see the price of everything that
[00:24:47] I have I do have to actually take the
[00:24:48] Fallout stuff out I got rid of my last
[00:24:50] my Fallout yesterday so I will have I'm
[00:24:54] trying to get some more I don't know if
[00:24:57] I will be able to but you know
[00:24:58] everybody's trying to get more right
[00:25:00] would you guys want Japanese ones if I
[00:25:02] can find those cuz I've been debating on
[00:25:04] buying a case of those cuz they're not
[00:25:05] too bad priced and my kids actually like
[00:25:07] the Japanese my youngest loves he
[00:25:10] actually knew a little Japan uh Japanese
[00:25:13] cuz he was watching um uh movies uh
[00:25:15] these cartoons from Japan on YouTube at
[00:25:17] one point when he was little and he
[00:25:18] somehow learned some Japanese the only
[00:25:20] reason I know this is because my um one
[00:25:23] of my best friend growing up his uh
[00:25:26] grandmother's Japanese and they were we
[00:25:28] were over at his house for his birth
[00:25:29] over at the grandmother's house for her
[00:25:30] birthday and she was like oh about say
[00:25:33] what her name was and nobody could get
[00:25:34] her name right except for me having
[00:25:35] known her for years and then she said
[00:25:37] her name and my youngest got her name
[00:25:38] right and said something to her in
[00:25:40] Japanese and she looked at it I'm like
[00:25:42] what and she responded to him said
[00:25:44] something else she goes and and she
[00:25:45] looked at me goes your son knows
[00:25:46] Japanese I'm like I I guess like he
[00:25:51] watches cartoons on
[00:25:54] YouTube I don't
[00:25:56] know hey
[00:26:01] so I don't know that's my that's my
[00:26:03] story of my my youngest picking up
[00:26:05] Japanese from
[00:26:07] cartoons I didn't have a problem with it
[00:26:09] it was you know it's another language
[00:26:11] whatever and he picked it up by himself
[00:26:13] from watching stuff when we were um like
[00:26:15] if I was at work if I had to work and
[00:26:17] you know when he was like watching
[00:26:19] something when he was like four he
[00:26:20] somehow picked it up it was
[00:26:22] weird we're going to put some G time up
[00:26:25] with a uh maybe some Forgotten Realms
[00:26:29] oh no worries Jupiter don't worry about
[00:26:31] it we'll take care of it the next next
[00:26:34] week I'll leave that in there for you
[00:26:35] for Jupiter's deal um like I said before

[00:29:37] these
[00:29:43] up we going to do that
[00:29:46] for this

[00:29:54] do the adventure maybe you do maybe you
[00:29:56] don't we're going to call this uh there
[00:29:59] we
[00:30:03] go there you go on those
[00:30:06] ones chemist at a company but I'm tired
[00:30:09] of being lab rat uh see I was actually I
[00:30:12] went to college and I was a biology
[00:30:15] chemistry major I actually wanted to go
[00:30:17] on to be a doctor um but um I had
[00:30:21] started out rather poor in my life and
[00:30:24] um the having a million dollars in debt
[00:30:27] um was thoroughly uncomfortable to me I
[00:30:30] probably would have been able to pay it
[00:30:31] off for my understanding of it rather
[00:30:32] quickly but it was one of those things
[00:30:34] like uh I just was not comfortable with
[00:30:36] having grown up with absolutely nothing
[00:30:38] and compared to like I was talking about
[00:30:40] compared to others I didn't I have
[00:30:41] absolutely nothing I had nothing compar
[00:30:43] I had a lot of stuff we had a lot of
[00:30:44] stuff starting out then later on when I
[00:30:46] got like in middle school high school we
[00:30:48] started having more my dad got better
[00:30:50] with his job had his own boat made his
[00:30:52] own business for himself so got we out
[00:30:54] better and stuff but starting out I do
[00:30:56] remember like being in a couple
[00:30:58] different apartments and stuff like that
[00:30:59] and like you know having multiple people
[00:31:01] you know Small Things dude exactly I
[00:31:04] that's what I mean it was going to be
[00:31:05] like a million dollars to for me to do
[00:31:07] what I wanted cuz I wanted to specialize
[00:31:09] personally I wanted to specialize um and
[00:31:12] I wanted to do um Pediatrics um and
[00:31:16] potentially like maybe pediatric surgery
[00:31:18] or something like that uh but I just I
[00:31:21] had the grades I um I just at one point
[00:31:24] I just decided I didn't want to be that
[00:31:27] much in debt I always wanted to help
[00:31:29] kids that's why I that's why I was just
[00:31:31] you know being the way I was that's
[00:31:33] that's what I ran
[00:31:35] into but who knows maybe some point in
[00:31:38] life I can maybe I hit maybe I hit the
[00:31:40] lottery and I can go back to med school
[00:31:42] at the age of like 40 and do I want not
[00:31:45] have to worry about it that'd be kind of
[00:31:48] cool we're going to put this up here for
[00:31:50] you all if you want it this is going to
[00:31:52] go on this a pretty good deal for this
[00:31:54] one try some Adventure out this morning
[00:31:56] you don't need to do the adventure you
[00:31:57] you don't need to be a detective
[00:31:58] wandering through the Wasteland you can
[00:32:00] choose whatever you'd like you can be
[00:32:02] nothing yeah it's one of those things
[00:32:04] yeah you have to have a hard time but
[00:32:06] yeah jump in on that or we have our pick
[00:32:07] your own break today now the way we're
[00:32:09] doing the pick your own break is you can
[00:32:11] jump in with whoever you want how many
[00:32:13] people you want do it by yourself if you
[00:32:15] want Even and um just pick whatever you
[00:32:18] want for packs and what we'll do is
[00:32:20] we'll break them either between them
[00:32:22] where we can do the packs between you
[00:32:23] guys one pack for one person one for
[00:32:25] another or we can do it where and then
[00:32:28] like the one car you know the one pack
[00:32:30] will split evenly however way you want
[00:32:32] but I figured kind of do a break that
[00:32:33] anybody can choose your own since people
[00:32:34] do like the those I don't mind doing
[00:32:36] them they're pretty fun too so uh I
[00:32:40] figured pick your own break

[00:32:46] though maybe I need to put out like a
[00:32:48] few different ones so people know what

[02:12:09] else up here let's put up
[02:12:14] um let's do this
[02:12:17] actually who here wants a um
[02:12:22] we'll do some dollar ones again we're
[02:12:25] going to put up
[02:12:27] um an eternal
[02:12:30] witness from 2K
[02:12:34] uh from what is it
[02:12:39] 20202 think double Masters
[02:12:42] 2022 there we
[02:12:45] go what's in the white bags all right so
[02:12:48] the white bags were for the other thing
[02:12:50] that we were doing before but um no one
[02:12:52] wanted to jump in on doing them so the
[02:12:54] white bags were set up because we were
[02:12:56] going to do like if somebody wanted to
[02:12:57] do a break uh like I was talking about
[02:13:00] before um I talked about we could do
[02:13:02] like your own custom break you say you
[02:13:03] want to break against another person um
[02:13:06] you or you or five people want to do a
[02:13:08] color break a digit break three people
[02:13:10] whatever it is every person that does a
[02:13:12] break you get to pick one of the bags
[02:13:13] there it's just pretty much just the
[02:13:14] Vault ones but they're just in a mystery
[02:13:16] they're just saying thank you for
[02:13:17] jumping in on a break and doing it with
[02:13:18] us and the way we do it is just the same
[02:13:20] thing is everybody else but I was just
[02:13:22] using cards instead of um cards instead
[02:13:25] of a wheel for um for spinning so like
[02:13:28] you would pick out a card shuffle and
[02:13:30] you pick out between one and 10 um so
[02:13:33] say you
[02:13:35] and um click clack and uh you know Quest
[02:13:39] decided they wanted to go in this is
[02:13:41] going to Josh
[02:13:44] Josh
[02:13:46] g210 Josh
[02:13:48] g210 Josh G20 so say like you and Josh
[02:13:52] wanted to go and you wanted to go and
[02:13:53] say I want to do um I want to I want to
[02:13:56] have a break between a Exelon here but I
[02:14:01] want to we want to
[02:14:02] do
[02:14:04] huh yeah and say you want to do I know I
[02:14:07] just the two of you wanted to do it
[02:14:09] because there wasn't enough that you
[02:14:10] didn't get involved because I figure
[02:14:11] sometimes it's hard to get a bunch of
[02:14:12] people you know sometimes not everybody
[02:14:14] you have only like two or three people
[02:14:16] so like say the two of you and you want
[02:14:17] to do Exelon while you do the two of you
[02:14:20] you can either split the
[02:14:21] and then after the last one we'll do
[02:14:23] back and forth whatever you would like
[02:14:25] as a color break we could do it all a
[02:14:26] color break a digit break whatever it is
[02:14:29] and the way I do it is it's a pick your
[02:14:31] own whatever you'd like and then every
[02:14:33] person that joins in and does any of the
[02:14:35] breaks always gets one of the Vault
[02:14:36] packs it's just we put them up here as
[02:14:38] mystery ones that way you can get them
[02:14:39] pick them out because it makes it a
[02:14:41] little bit e um easier to find them that
[02:14:43] way because then you can't just pick one
[02:14:45] at a time from here gives everybody more
[02:14:47] of a chance to pick one that's what it
[02:14:48] is gives you a little extra that's all
[02:14:51] figure kind of a little bit of a game
[02:14:53] some fun type thing if uh you guys want
[02:14:56] to do any uh any breaks so say if you
[02:14:58] and somebody else wants to do a break
[02:15:00] and you can't grab and you don't have
[02:15:01] enough people that's kind of how I was
[02:15:03] planning on doing
[02:15:04] it so I'm going to put
[02:15:07] on this one a huting huting huting a
[02:15:12] hoarding brood

[02:15:27] was going through a bunch of it so I
[02:15:29] want to get into the rest here oh I'm

[02:47:14] both both of you will be able to pick
[02:47:15] one of your own packs up there the
[02:47:16] little mystery things up there at the
[02:47:18] top that we have we'll expand that out
[02:47:20] so you can see it and that's how we're
[02:47:22] going to try that out there if you guys
[02:47:23] want to do any of those that way you get
[02:47:25] to break open your ex and see if you
[02:47:27] want some mix on there but you get some
[02:47:29] aoria too with
[02:47:31] it maybe try that out draw since we have
[02:47:34] a bunch of them I drop down the price a
[02:47:36] little bit see if you want to do
[02:47:37] something like that that's a little pick
[02:47:38] your own break number one then number
[02:47:40] two will come out after no one wanted to
[02:47:43] do it all right so I will put that kind
[02:47:47] of off to the side here in case someone
[02:47:49] wants to try this at some point all
[02:47:51] right seems like no one wants to hey
[02:47:53] house how you doing
[02:47:56] buddy do appreciate it do appreciate it
[02:48:00] comeing hanging out for a
[02:48:03] while earlier and I was just kind of
[02:48:06] going through um a bunch of them so I
[02:48:09] figured um since we were going through a
[02:48:11] ton of the singles um now it's time to
[02:48:14] go through and try to do some packs see
[02:48:16] if you guys want to do those
[02:48:19] but I'm guessing there's going to be a
[02:48:20] bunch of people leaving now because you
[02:48:22] all wanted to get the singles Dirt
[02:48:24] Cheap which I don't mind doing that
[02:48:26] times but sometimes I can't go through
[02:48:28] all of them you know what I mean I can
[02:48:29] sa some so let's put up um some packs
[02:48:32] here for maybe an adventure in the
[02:48:33] Wasteland for a little bit cuz we have a
[02:48:35] lot of stuff we did earlier how many
[02:48:36] people do you have in here there's uh 17
[02:48:38] in at the moment okay is that the
[02:48:41] highest that you've been all day no what
[02:48:43] it's the highest
[02:48:44] been you want to see the game I'm
[02:48:47] staying you want to see the game
[02:48:49] exactly not too bad house going a little
[02:48:52] going well we doing some singles we're
[02:48:54] having some fun here we went through
[02:48:56] some of the singles tried out some
[02:48:57] dollar starts on Singles it worked out a
[02:48:59] little bit um but I think I might end up
[02:49:02] doing that saving them for my show on
[02:49:05] wat wat knon so I can do my dollar
[02:49:06] singles
[02:49:07] there so we're going to do the game here
[02:49:11] and I'm going to put this out for anyone
[02:49:14] that wants to try it this is going to be
[02:49:16] a three strength on your adventure in
[02:49:18] the Wasteland
[02:49:20] here all right three strength on your
[02:49:22] adventure in the Wasteland
[02:49:24] here and I'm going to put these ones up
[02:49:44] here I do not um youer who the second
[02:49:48] buyer is audio
[02:49:51] chop yeah so if you want to do the
[02:49:54] um audio chopping audio chopping up
[02:49:59] again are we better
[02:50:02] again I do have xon collector boosters I
[02:50:05] actually have this part left over and a
[02:50:08] whole
[02:50:10] box audio
[02:50:12] only I know internet knows be messing I
[02:50:15] guess
[02:50:17] so but uh
[02:50:19] um yeah that's how you would do the
[02:50:21] second buyer if you w to do the the pick
[02:50:23] your own one so it would be you and
[02:50:25] whoever else would jump in for the
[02:50:27] second one and I'm going to run it again
[02:50:29] after this that that's what I had up
[02:50:30] there and uh that's the adventure game
[02:50:32] no one wanted to go with the adventure
[02:50:34] game because I do switch him around a
[02:50:35] little
[02:50:36] bit so what I'll do here is here's he'll
[02:50:39] do do it again all right this was what I
[02:50:42] was saying was kind of pick your own
[02:50:44] break here kind of a pick your own
[02:50:47] break let's put that up here you could
[02:50:50] have picked your own but I just did it
[02:50:52] here now this is going to be those
[02:50:54] there's only two of them all right so it
[02:50:56] would be between two people what's going
[02:50:58] to go on is each of you you get two of
[02:51:00] these aoria and then we break the L on
[02:51:03] after and that is dependent on what card
[02:51:06] you pull out whether it is 1 through 10
[02:51:08] which Whoever has the highest picks
[02:51:11] first um and that's how we go for
[02:51:13] whoever goes first with the Exon there
[02:51:15] and what you're going to end up doing is
[02:51:17] we just need one other person to jump in
[02:51:19] on the next one and uh we'll have that
[02:51:21] break going we'll break those open each
[02:51:23] of you always are going to get one of
[02:51:24] the little um packs up here just say

[04:18:26] happens
[04:18:28] sometimes but um now roie Rudy I keep
[04:18:31] counting roie since nobody wanted to do

[04:18:46] that that way just go and reest the
[04:18:48] refund and I'll take care of it right
[04:18:49] now okay
[04:18:51] bud and I will put this off to the side
[04:18:54] though in case um somebody did decide
[04:18:55] they want to jump in on that at some
[04:18:57] point okay yeah I guess nobody wanted to
[04:18:59] do that one with you so yeah I guess
[04:19:01] that's what happened there
[04:19:03] um uh because I'm I'm only going to be
[04:19:05] here for like another 15 more minutes so
[04:19:07] I don't want to hang people around and
[04:19:09] like make them hang around for no reason
[04:19:10] you know um so that's all I I I'm
[04:19:12] probably just going to switch things up
[04:19:14] a little bit instead and see what else
[04:19:16] we do in different instead of different
[04:19:17] ones so like um like maybe instead of
[04:19:21] instead of the commander Masters I'll
[04:19:23] probably switch this out and put this in
[04:19:25] for an Exelon
[04:19:30] instead some really rude people on this
[04:19:32] app I
[04:19:34] found that was the first time I ran into
[04:19:36] that where somebody was just like just
[04:19:38] came in to be rude for no
[04:19:40] reason for real yeah
[04:19:43] came in to gave me a hard time about
[04:19:45] pricing and I asked them a question they
[04:19:47] sent me a message then blocked me so
[04:19:49] it's like a little inappropriate on
[04:19:51] their
[04:19:52] part I laugh at people like that though
[04:19:55] as you can
[04:19:56] tell you know Petty people what can you
[04:20:02] do there are two of
[04:20:05] these and this is going to go on here
[04:20:08] for this for those of you that want to
[04:20:10] try
[04:20:11] it
[04:20:14] oh if you go into um orders you should
[04:20:17] see the little hamburger thing on your
[04:20:19] top somewhere around there you go to
[04:20:20] orders and you should be able to say
[04:20:22] request refund next
[04:20:25] it cck I know mine are cheaper than any
[04:20:28] LGS around here that I'm at and I'm
[04:20:31] actually pretty close to um uh TCG if
[04:20:35] not lower on some some of them I'm
[04:20:37] higher on but it just just to depend on
[04:20:38] what I get for my packs at the cost of
[04:20:40] them like somebody's going to say oh you
[04:20:43] you know this pack is $2 here I'm like
[04:20:45] yeah but the last person to buy that was
[04:20:47] 7 months
[04:20:48] ago that's why it was sold for $2 7
[04:20:51] months ago they're not set they're like
[04:20:54] you can't buy a
[04:20:55] box where you can get the packs even
[04:20:58] under $2 now let alone selling them for
[04:21:01] that amount so that's why I like I laugh
[04:21:02] at it a little bit you know people got
[04:21:04] their things whatever dude have fun have
[04:21:08] a good life if you feel so entitled that
[04:21:11] you need to block me because my prices

What would cause a Subaru Outback brake light to be continuously on?

A continuously lit brake light on a Subaru Outback can be caused by several issues. Here are the most common ones:

1. **Faulty Brake Light Switch**: The brake light switch is located near the brake pedal. When you press the pedal, the switch completes an electrical circuit, turning on the brake lights. If this switch is stuck or faulty, it can cause the brake lights to stay on.

2. **Stuck Brake Pedal**: If the brake pedal itself is not returning to its fully upright position, it may keep the brake light switch engaged. This could be due to a mechanical issue with the pedal or something obstructing its movement.

3. **Wiring Issues**: Damaged or shorted wiring can cause a continuous connection that keeps the brake lights on. This can occur due to wear and tear, rodent damage, or other electrical issues.

4. **Faulty Relay**: In some vehicles, a relay controls the brake lights. If this relay fails, it could cause the brake lights to stay on.

5. **Low Brake Fluid**: Some Subaru models have a sensor that lights up the brake lights when the brake fluid is low. Check the brake fluid reservoir and top it off if necessary.

6. **Malfunctioning Brake Light Bulb Socket**: If the socket is corroded or damaged, it might cause a continuous electrical connection, keeping the brake lights on.

### Steps to Diagnose and Fix the Issue:

1. **Check the Brake Pedal and Switch**:
   - Look under the dashboard at the brake pedal.
   - Find the brake light switch and see if it is properly aligned and functioning.
   - Manually press and release the switch to see if the brake lights turn off and on.

2. **Inspect the Brake Pedal**:
   - Ensure the pedal returns to its upright position when released.
   - Remove any obstructions or debris that might hinder its movement.

3. **Check the Brake Fluid Level

[00:34:49] at uh for a pack deal
[00:34:53] here we're going to do a random I pull
[00:34:55] random stuff so so if you guys want
[00:34:57] something specific just let me know
[00:35:01] because I just keep pulling random
[00:35:02] things out that I have that's it that's
[00:35:07] what I'm
[00:35:08] doing we're going to do we're going to
[00:35:10] do this here our next pack
[00:35:13] deal will be dominer remastered
[00:35:17] collector
[00:35:19] booster a dominer United set in a Wilds
[00:35:23] of Al drain that's what we're going to
[00:35:25] go
[00:35:25] with
[00:35:32] and that onscreen pack deal will end up
[00:35:44] being call that 27 for those
[00:35:50] three but right now it is ohir talk or a
[00:35:55] ravenous T-Rex X are your choices for
[00:35:59] the on screen uh singles on screen now
[00:36:02] if somebody wants to deal on a singles
[00:36:04] on screen be like yo can you give
[00:36:06] me um this single that you're showing me
[00:36:10] in um a couple of packs I'll throw a
[00:36:13] deal like that on for you or say h a
[00:36:15] pole box or something like that I'll do
[00:36:17] that and then I can drop the price of
[00:36:18] some of the things because like I said
[00:36:20] when that when I'm able to do multiple
[00:36:22] things at once it helps me with the
[00:36:24] whatnot fees so I pass that help on to
[00:36:28] you in this onscreen pack deal since we
[00:36:31] did not want the
[00:36:33] singles right here
[00:36:36] are onscreen pack deal
[00:36:40] is
[00:36:49] 207 yeah I know
[00:36:53] exactly so that's why like I try to um
[00:36:57] that's why I try to do like the three at
[00:36:58] a time that's why I do three packs at a
[00:37:01] time or three pull boxes or multiple
[00:37:03] things because if I can do multiple
[00:37:06] things then um then if I'm saving on
[00:37:09] those fees I figure might as well pass
[00:37:10] them on to you I don't care I don't need
[00:37:12] to make that extra money for me I'm I'm
[00:37:16] good with making what I initially
[00:37:17] already had or what I what little I made
[00:37:20] if I made anything at all some of the
[00:37:22] times I don't even make stuff on this
[00:37:23] it's just like oh you know what I'm G to
[00:37:24] get rid of this stuff because I've had

[00:38:17] can on sealed like sometimes I can give
[00:38:20] better deals depending on where I'm like
[00:38:21] when and when I when and where I got it
[00:38:24] but um I mean I I generally don't make
[00:38:27] anything or a little bit because the
[00:38:29] only reason that I did this was to hang
[00:38:31] out with my boys they wanted to do stuff
[00:38:33] on here and like they wanted to they
[00:38:36] wanted to do YouTube videos or my oldest
[00:38:38] wanted to I'm like I can't afford to do
[00:38:39] that and he happened to see somebody
[00:38:41] doing one of these videos and like hey
[00:38:43] can we do this and I was like a looked
[00:38:46] into it and we started doing it and
[00:38:49] hanging out and having fun so I figured
[00:38:51] why not and kept doing it and it's been
[00:38:53] kind of fun when I don't have when I
[00:38:54] might like a day off or in the in the
[00:38:56] mornings when I before I start work type
[00:39:02] thing I get to hang out with people and
[00:39:04] then I get to crack pack you
[00:39:08] know is there any sealed uh product that
[00:39:11] you're looking for MTG you know check my
[00:39:14] by now say there's something specific
[00:39:15] that you're looking
[00:39:19] for you can say hey I want this and I
[00:39:21] can do what I can for
[00:39:25] you
[00:39:27] you know what I'm going to
[00:39:28] do I'm going to do these
[00:39:31] three B
[00:39:34] mirror legol
[00:39:37] Lis or a flesh duplicate one of those
[00:39:41] three for your
[00:39:46] single and we're going to start that
[00:39:48] we're going to go
[00:39:49] 22 so that's actually a little bit of a
[00:39:51] deal on the
[00:39:53] um on the bese mirror there for
[00:39:56] so 22 you either get the besiege mirror
[00:40:00] the legalist quick reflexes or the flesh
[00:40:02] duplicate surge foil extended
[00:40:11] art yeah you like um I do stuff like
[00:40:14] that on a lot of the times like that's
[00:40:17] why like with the ixon Lost Cav Exon
[00:40:21] pull box I have some um packs that I've
[00:40:24] thrown in like draft booster packs and
[00:40:27] stuff to make it a little bit sweeter
[00:40:29] and I I did have ones
[00:40:31] where we do pull boxes where there's not
[00:40:35] a like with Doctor Who that's hard to
[00:40:37] lose on the Doctor Who box wildel drain
[00:40:40] actually that one should be $3 I forgot
[00:40:42] to correct that Wilds of Al drain it's
[00:40:44] hard to lose on that one and then and
[00:40:47] same with like even like the uh the
[00:40:48] Christmas one that I did I made it so
[00:40:50] it's kind of hard to lose on I don't
[00:40:52] like when you have such a
[00:40:54] giant spread that you can get a $2 card
[00:40:57] when you spend $20 if you're trying to
[00:40:59] get the Thousand doll card so I try to
[00:41:00] do them like a weird you know spreads
[00:41:02] that aren't that
[00:41:05] big so right we didn't want any of those
[00:41:08] those are 22 for any of these but no one
[00:41:11] wanted that so we're going to go on and
[00:41:13] we are going to uh
[00:41:18] do I I just did a pullbox deal I did
[00:41:21] singles it's onto a pack
[00:41:24] deal onto a pack deal that's what it
[00:41:27] is got the dino deck nice hey that Dino
[00:41:32] deck I'm telling you you're going to
[00:41:34] have some people that are scared of you
[00:41:36] actually you know what we're gonna do
[00:41:37] some ixon right here because you just
[00:41:38] mentioned dinos we're doing some ixon at
[00:41:41] the
[00:41:41] moment that's what we're gonna do you
[00:41:44] mentioned dinos we're gonna do some Exon
[00:41:47] Exon we're gonna do this and we're going
[00:41:51] to do this we're GNA do some random
[00:41:53] random things with
[00:41:54] Exon some random things with xon we're
[00:41:57] going to do that I like that
[00:42:00] idea I'm a lover and I'm a
[00:42:05] sinner music in

[00:42:27] three 33 for those
[00:42:33] three three packs on screen for
[00:42:37] 33 yeah you can definitely do some
[00:42:40] upgrades that one to make it pretty nice
[00:42:41] in the dino

[00:43:03] stuff to them and the people that get
[00:43:06] I'll I'll say this if you get a delivery
[00:43:08] from me and it's like a low pull from a
[00:43:11] box most of the people here will real
[00:43:14] recognize that they don't just get that
[00:43:16] delivery there's always a little
[00:43:18] something extra to say thank you for
[00:43:19] playing um I don't always say anything
[00:43:21] on screen just because people will
[00:43:23] complain that whatever they got wasn't
[00:43:25] happy or didn't get this I just like to
[00:43:27] be nice and enough and give them
[00:43:29] something to say thank you it could be
[00:43:30] something decent could be something just
[00:43:32] a few extra cards could be just
[00:43:33] something you know whatever hey how's it
[00:43:38] going no for those yeah just a little

[00:51:42] reason I like doing the three packs is
[00:51:44] for some
[00:51:45] reason not every time but regularly if
[00:51:50] somebody buys three packs they always
[00:51:52] end up making their money back somehow
[00:51:54] and it's because because they find one
[00:51:56] card or one pack of cards that ends up

[01:36:37] tablet just for work here to do this

[01:36:50] wheel and there's a bunch of other
[01:36:52] features I can do that always come out
[01:36:54] on
[01:36:55] iOS so I was like fine whatever I'll buy

[01:37:01] tablet then that that way I could just
[01:37:03] do everything I wanted on it everything

[02:25:48] couple bucks so I mean you didn't get
[02:25:51] nothing out of it it was just I think

[02:25:59] that in there and we're going to open up

[02:49:48] a mani game he called it for Doctor Who
[02:49:51] and really all it is
[02:49:54] is 50 Doctor Who cards Doctor Who lands

[03:18:37] there all right no one wanted it so here
[03:18:40] we go perfect
[03:18:46] thank you I appreciate that here we go
[03:18:49] all right so the way we do this game is
[03:18:53] you have the Suns
[03:18:58] box get this up here because I
[03:19:02] just some of the cards just fell over
[03:19:05] and I want to make sure you have the
[03:19:05] full chance of everything because I
[03:19:07] moved that without putting that over
[03:19:08] there we go you have the Suns box pull
[03:19:12] from you have the father's box you're
[03:19:15] not pulling from these you get an
[03:19:17] opportunity after you get your backs all
[03:19:20] right now then here is the buyer box so
[03:19:25] this is what we got here so you want to
[03:19:27] have what we're going to do here is
[03:19:29] we're going to pull three packs out of
[03:19:32] the mystery packs right here three cards
[03:19:35] tell me where you want to go each card
[03:19:37] has a pack name listed on it so it' be
[03:19:39] something like kind of like this here
[03:19:41] like you would see LCI draft wild wild
[03:19:44] drain draft brother Wars set something
[03:19:46] like that would be listed on the back of
[03:19:48] them so where do you want to go on those
[03:19:52] mystery packs
[03:19:55] there 31 and
[03:19:58] random all
[03:20:01] right
[03:20:05] number one two
[03:20:09] three four five six 7 eight N9 10
[03:20:14] 11 all right number
[03:20:17] 311 do you like the band 311 Min any
[03:20:21] chance and then I'm gonna put this one
[03:20:23] here on the buyer one
[03:20:26] now turn that back over so you can
[03:20:31] see oh lucky numbers all right where
[03:20:35] would would you like me to move any of
[03:20:37] these or would you like all of these to
[03:20:39] stay where they are because this one
[03:20:41] correspond to the buyer box that
[03:20:43] corresponds to the father that
[03:20:45] correspond to the son so whatever we
[03:20:46] flip over whatever packs are on there is
[03:20:49] what's going to be ripped open and
[03:20:50] whichever one has the highest mono value
[03:20:52] is the one that'll hit its Target we're
[03:20:54] gonna stay all right sounds good we the
[03:20:57] Suns box you've got a Wilds of alrin
[03:21:01] draft lost caverns of Exelon draft for
[03:21:05] the
[03:21:06] father and a Wilds ofal drain set for
[03:21:09] the buyer now when you get two drafts I
[03:21:12] do let you switch one out for one of the
[03:21:16] sets that I have so I will let you
[03:21:18] switch it out for E any a Lord of the
[03:21:22] Rings a marching
[03:21:25] machine dominer United Wilds of Al drain
[03:21:29] fxia or if you would like to you can do
[03:21:32] a modern Horizon
[03:21:36] draft but if you would like to switch
[03:21:38] any of these out let me
[03:21:39] know switch Wild draft for a Lord of the
[03:21:42] Rings all right I'll do that I can do

[03:21:56] like that it's my stuff I mathematically
[03:21:59] know what I have in my head and what I
[03:22:00] can do so that's why I like to do this
[03:22:02] thing here so all right you got an LCI
[03:22:05] draft there we go and then we have a wow
[03:22:09] set because I you know I don't like to
[03:22:11] hit the bottom myself on anything so I
[03:22:13] don't think anybody else would
[03:22:15] right
[03:22:18] exactly all right we're GNA start with
[03:22:21] the fire the fire the father we gonna
[03:22:24] start with the father you I do this
[03:22:27] thing to have fun I don't do this thing
[03:22:29] to make an exorbitant amount of money if
[03:22:31] I was doing that I wouldn't be doing
[03:22:33] these boxes the way I do them I would be
[03:22:35] doing a lot
[03:22:37] different or I wouldn't be doing the
[03:22:39] deals I give all the time I'd be making
[03:22:41] a lot different one two three four and
[03:22:44] five just because I know they put the
[03:22:46] spoilers in their front
[03:22:49] there calaminus
[03:22:52] caveen I gotta slide this back a little
[03:22:54] bit calaminus caveen inverted Iceberg
[03:22:59] basking copy bar pathf finding
[03:23:04] axaw we're doing what's called the um
[03:23:09] carnival game so packs finding ajaw what
[03:23:13] we do is he pulls out we pull out three
[03:23:15] packs from the mystery packs they get
[03:23:18] lined up in front of the bo the son the
[03:23:20] father and the buyer box in which
[03:23:22] everyone has the highest mono value gets
[03:23:24] a free extra thing just saying thank you
[03:23:27] for playing the game with us so like you
[03:23:29] might be able to get like an extra pack
[03:23:30] maybe it's like a card or maybe it's a
[03:23:32] card like you might want to play with
[03:23:34] but it's whichever one has the highest
[03:23:35] mono value out of the three packs is the
[03:23:38] Target that hits but you always get the
[03:23:39] three packs that you buy it's just a
[03:23:41] little extra to have some fun with
[03:23:43] that's it relics

[03:24:09] that one promising vein
[03:24:12] all right so on the high on that one we
[03:24:17] had I think it

[03:24:22] that oh
[03:24:26] five the high is a five the high is a
[03:24:30] five right there now we're going to go

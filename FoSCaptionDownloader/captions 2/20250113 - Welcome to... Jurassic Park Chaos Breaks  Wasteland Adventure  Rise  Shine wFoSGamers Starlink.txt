[00:13:31] popping up right over
[00:13:36] here I don't know we'll see I
[00:13:42] think it was here at least earlier maybe
[00:13:46] it could have been the stingray that was
[00:13:47] over there that popped off but it wasn't
[00:13:48] that big of a bump it was a smaller
[00:13:52] bump well sounds like somebody's getting
[00:13:55] ready to go scuba diving they're fishing
[00:13:57] over there too
[00:13:59] the locals
[00:14:01] around not a bad place so far try not to
[00:14:04] show too too much of crazy people don't
[00:14:07] start coming after us for some random
[00:14:10] reason thank you no a problem Kenny I
[00:14:13] appreciate it I didn't see that before
[00:14:14] so I'll look again how's it going cool
[00:14:16] guy thanks coming in hanging out we got
[00:14:19] about two two and a half three minutes
[00:14:21] left on the giby
[00:14:24] there yeah exactly one regular one one
[00:14:28] like that
[00:14:32] cool thank you yeah I'll check it after
[00:14:34] the stream for that I appreciate that um
[00:14:36] Nico it's a little hard to check where
[00:14:37] it is right now I wish I could I said if
[00:14:39] once I get all my stuff together we'll
[00:14:41] be good
[00:14:45] but we'll be here today we're going to
[00:14:48] leave tomorrow we were going to leave we
[00:14:49] were thinking of leaving today but
[00:14:51] realize it's Sunday because we keep
[00:14:52] forgetting what time of the day time of
[00:14:53] like week what week it is like what day
[00:14:55] of the week and what even time is
[00:14:57] sometimes if you don't have your watch
[00:14:58] on cuz just swimming or whatever oh crap
[00:15:00] it's like 6 o00 we got to get back and
[00:15:02] eat like you were jumping off the back
[00:15:04] of the boat yesterday and I think the
[00:15:06] sun started going down like oh crap no
[00:15:08] that's way too late we need to start
[00:15:09] cooking because it's going to be like 10
[00:15:10] o'clock by the time we're done eating
[00:15:12] and have everything cooking because we
[00:15:13] we got to use a grill you know propane
[00:15:15] it's not like a super duper modern
[00:15:17] appliance that cooks water in like 10
[00:15:19] seconds it takes some time to do
[00:15:21] things yeah jump in the
[00:15:24] giby so so far delusional we've been to
[00:15:28] um uh British Virgin Islands tortula um
[00:15:31] we've been to St Thomas uh Puerto Rico
[00:15:34] um there's a couple of the islands
[00:15:36] around Puerto Rico b vquez
[00:15:39] kulaba um then there's uh we went to we
[00:15:42] were over by St Thomas I mean um St
[00:15:45] John's but we did not stop there I want
[00:15:46] to go to St John's stop there there's a
[00:15:48] couple places but we um we're on our way
[00:15:50] back that way anyways see what's going
[00:15:52] on in all those islands cuz uh we just
[00:15:54] need to have our stuff taken care of for
[00:15:56] um some solar so we're waiting for
[00:15:59] response from a marina there to where if
[00:16:02] we can get our solar installed so that's
[00:16:04] pretty much what we're waiting on but so
[00:16:06] far I'd say the favorite I like the
[00:16:08] smaller Islands I did like British
[00:16:10] Virgin Islands uh tortula when we were
[00:16:12] there when we were like in like looking
[00:16:13] at our boat like uh that's when we went
[00:16:15] down and like did the final walk around
[00:16:17] confirmed we were going to get it and
[00:16:18] put the payment on that's where we got

[00:55:52] Intelligence oh wait no you don't you
[00:55:53] don't have anything special added yet
[00:55:54] that was a jet so a plus five you need
[00:55:57] to get a 15 on an 11 or higher to hit
[00:56:01] here we
[00:56:03] go oh well look at that it's a 13 my
[00:56:06] friend your plasma rifle
[00:56:08] hits knocks back one of our
[00:56:14] uh creatures here so we are at they're
[00:56:18] at only 35 Health each there then you
[00:56:22] have five of them all right but they're
[00:56:25] quick
[00:56:27] you have to get 16 or higher to hit
[00:56:32] [Music]
[00:56:47] them all
[00:56:50] right so you your plasma and let's get
[00:56:53] our dice out cuz plasma is two
[00:56:57] oh look at that you got six on the
[00:56:59] damage there nice knocked him down
[00:57:05] six you have hold
[00:57:07] on
[00:57:09] Alpha you have a plasma R earing which
[00:57:12] makes it a plus eight if you use the
[00:57:15] alien Gatling gun you got some luck with
[00:57:17] that
[00:57:20] one you're going to sniper it
[00:57:31] oh thank
[00:57:37] you sniper rifle all right sniper rifle
[00:57:40] it is and oh you got them you needed you
[00:57:44] got 11 there so that means you hit with
[00:57:46] your sniper rifle your sniper rifle
[00:57:47] gives you
[00:57:48] three and oh there you go you got uh
[00:57:52] eight 14 on damage are you which one you
[00:57:55] going to hit are you going to hit the
[00:57:55] one that already been injured I with the
[00:57:57] sniper I didn't I forgot to ask that's
[00:57:59] my
[00:58:08] fault that's my fault my friendg about
[00:58:14] that all right you hit that one I like
[00:58:17] it brings it down
[00:58:31] to 15
[00:58:33] Health
[00:58:36] remaining Health right now I mean 15
[00:58:38] damage uh remaining health is 20 Health
[00:58:40] sorry that doesn't make sense
[00:58:59] 20 Health that is correct now ah total
[00:59:03] damage is
[00:59:08] 15
[00:59:12] no no this is not right got 15 Health
[00:59:16] remaining why is that not doing that
[00:59:18] right I'm going to play with that my
[00:59:19] calculation is not working
[00:59:21] well
[00:59:24] D3 yep
[00:59:27] it is
[00:59:28] three I have the uh charts in here if
[00:59:31] you
[00:59:32] want I think I have it in
[00:59:39] there yeah in the chart section you
[00:59:43] should be able to see the charts I can
[00:59:45] show it to you if you want it shows all
[00:59:46] of them what their roles are and any
[00:59:48] other bonus that goes with it so like
[00:59:50] the
[00:59:51] sniper you uh it can go through armor if
[00:59:54] you hit them you know as he gets a six
[00:59:59] bonus yeah all right so let's um adjust
[01:00:06] and we're going on to our next one who's
[01:00:08] going to attack now I missed somebody
[01:00:11] somebody if you said anything sorry when
[01:00:12] I was doing
[01:00:14] that so you're on a beach there's trees
[01:00:17] around any other the kind any kind or
[01:00:20] sand and water yeah just kind of like on
[01:00:21] a beach you're on a beach and you
[01:00:24] started to turn towards the uh uh turned
[01:00:27] towards the forest and you walked in you
[01:00:29] saw a bunch of
[01:00:31] raptors you did not attack yet delusion
[01:00:33] you have to attack it's you and um Alpha
[01:00:36] that where we have to know what you want
[01:00:38] to do what kind of attack are you going
[01:00:40] to do I don't
[01:00:46] know you have to
[01:00:49] decide on your
[01:00:51] attack you going to go Swinging with
[01:00:53] your sword I like it so our buddy
[01:00:57] here goes grabs his sword decides I'm
[01:01:01] going to run in with my sword you run in
[01:01:05] and oh no you got a
[01:01:08] six you missed that means you whiffed
[01:01:13] and they are going to get a
[01:01:15] Counterattack for three that drops you
[01:01:18] down three you're lucky they only came
[01:01:20] and whipped you with your with their
[01:01:21] tail when they went by
[01:01:22] you so you go down to 90
[01:01:26] Seven
[01:01:28] health there we
[01:01:30] go got lucky there not a big hit all
[01:01:34] right now we're on can I find the
[01:01:37] largest tree next to them and cut it
[01:01:38] down with the Gatling and try to get it
[01:01:40] to fall on we have some luck I think you
[01:01:43] well that'll be a luck roll I'd say
[01:01:46] where where are your
[01:01:47] Alpha do you have any luck you have
[01:01:49] intelligence and Engineering so it' be a
[01:01:51] 50/50 on your luck then so that means
[01:01:53] whenever we have a 50/50 you choose
[01:01:57] heads or tails with your pirate coin and
[01:02:01] we find out if we're going to have a
[01:02:02] 50/50 so you get to do a m 5050 on that
[01:02:04] one hey good morning but you can try it
[01:02:08] good morning Frank so this would be a uh
[01:02:11] you shoot your Gatling and you're in a
[01:02:12] 50/50 if it'll take down the tree and
[01:02:14] then we'll roll to see how much damage
[01:02:16] it
[01:02:17] does I am literally in another country
[01:02:20] we haven't gotten it
[01:02:22] yet could be a good idea I mean you got
[01:02:24] a Gatling gun that's you got a laser an
[01:02:26] alien laser Gatling gun all right so
[01:02:29] this is what you have you have the alien
[01:02:30] Gatling gun and let's see what it does
[01:02:32] for special here I forgot to put on that
[01:02:34] alien Gatling
[01:02:36] gun it ho put holes through metal so
[01:02:39] easy CU it'll go right through the tree
[01:02:40] if you get the good if you get it I
[01:02:43] think it'll go through not a bad
[01:02:47] idea pretty good idea I
[01:02:51] think try it all right here we go we're
[01:02:54] going to spin
[01:02:56] where's goe heads Tails who's gonna oh
[01:02:58] you got
[01:03:00] no
[01:03:02] tails it did not go your
[01:03:07] way that's your way you did not have it
[01:03:10] go your way oh no you
[01:03:13] shoot with your alien Gatling gun at the
[01:03:19] trees you missed them all those trees
[01:03:22] next to the dinos but you know what I'm
[01:03:24] going to do we're going to have you do
[01:03:27] this we're going to have you roll and
[01:03:29] see if you hit any of them we're going
[01:03:31] to give you a chance to hit three wow
[01:03:34] you got lucky three of them one of them
[01:03:35] got hit with six and two of them get hit
[01:03:37] with two that's what we're going to give
[01:03:39] you there because the alien Gatling gun
[01:03:41] goes off and they're all by the trees
[01:03:42] you got a little crazy shoting off there
[01:03:44] and luckily you're able to take out a
[01:03:47] couple so you hit one for
[01:03:53] uh what is it
[01:03:56] two two and then six so that would
[01:04:10] be this would be
[01:04:33] that doesn't make any
[01:04:40] sense H whatever you got uh 33
[01:04:45] Health on one 33 Health on
[01:04:48] another and you got a
[01:04:56] 29 Health on another and 35 on the
[01:05:02] rest
[01:05:04] so you have to decide what's going to go
[01:05:06] on here why my math wasn't working on
[01:05:09] that
[01:05:12] before you do get a boost that's why you
[01:05:14] were able to roll that's why I gave you
[01:05:17] the roll because your intelligence you
[01:05:18] had intelligence and stuff so we gave
[01:05:19] you the extra roll there yes that's why
[01:05:23] that's why we gave you the extra on
[01:05:24] those yes
[01:05:26] so now the dinos are not
[01:05:29] happy oh my God you guys got
[01:05:33] lucky reason why we do this is if it's
[01:05:35] over 50/50 you see how much extra damage
[01:05:38] they do you guys got nine they missed
[01:05:40] the dinos rampaging Raptors missed doing
[01:05:44] laundry and shopping oh well yeah we
[01:05:46] might do a little stream later we only
[01:05:47] on we're going to finish this up here
[01:05:49] all right hurry up we got to know what's
[01:05:50] going on what are you guys doing next we
[01:05:52] got to go this quick quick
[01:05:55] figure out the end are the dinos going
[01:05:57] to get to you or are you going to get to
[01:05:59] them that is not that supposed to be a
[01:06:02] thumbs up thumbs
[01:06:05] up it never does a thumbs up for me but
[01:06:08] it does the other
[01:06:10] ones See it'll do the other ones
[01:06:14] though you going to go for it again I
[01:06:16] like it all right you're going to go for
[01:06:18] it
[01:06:19] again 50/50 if you get heads you get it
[01:06:22] Tails they get you
[01:06:25] oh my friend look at that it is
[01:06:30] heads well look at that your
[01:06:32] intelligence paid off with that alien
[01:06:35] Gatling
[01:06:36] gun nice all right so this is what we're
[01:06:40] going to do there are five six five of
[01:06:43] them in there we're going to roll a
[01:06:46] dice to see how many hit now if you hit
[01:06:51] one that's not the right
[01:06:53] one alien Gatlin
[01:06:56] gun all right we're going to do out of
[01:06:58] six here we're going to see how many you
[01:07:00] hit all right there we go how many falls
[01:07:03] on oh my God all of
[01:07:06] them it fell it was going to get six for
[01:07:09] all of them or you going to take how
[01:07:10] many it oh my God you got all of
[01:07:12] them the trees fall on all of them
[01:07:16] now we're going to have to see how much

[01:07:34] four five all right all five of them
[01:07:37] there we go it was five of them actually
[01:07:38] so we're going to
[01:07:47] go
[01:07:49] plus that
[01:08:01] all right then one goes
[01:08:07] down then the other one goes
[01:08:14] down then one of them goes down

[01:13:01] our boat and I shattered it so bad that
[01:13:03] I can't bend it anymore more than that
[01:13:06] careful so hey we got to decide what are
[01:13:08] we doing are we rolling or we're going
[01:13:11] to put uh what are we going to have we
[01:13:12] just going to have the background there
[01:13:13] hanging out for a little
[01:13:15] while what you do what you do what you
[01:13:18] do what you do what you want to do do
[01:13:21] here we go everybody let's I was going
[01:13:25] to going to shoot the dirt at the feet
[01:13:26] with the plasma to try and scare them
[01:13:28] off hurt their Vision to get away but
[01:13:30] people ATT you can you can like uh take
[01:13:32] that idea over type
[01:13:44] thing okay that's good
[01:13:50] there you're back that's cool connect is
[01:13:53] it better is it better I'm sorry connect
[01:13:54] one first time I got in oh we got a big
[01:13:56] turn in our this direction that might be
[01:13:58] it huge turn we got a really big turn
[01:14:01] yeah this way can't hear connection yeah
[01:14:03] we haven't faced this direction
[01:14:08] yet yeah we'll have to keep an eye on
[01:14:10] the anchor so it's not spinning too much
[01:14:11] and making making a [ __ ] ball uhuh
[01:14:15] all right attack with the Gatling I like
[01:14:17] it you attack with that alien
[01:14:18] Gatling and boom you hit you hit let's
[01:14:23] see how much you get
[01:14:25] oh like it like like that that's a seven
[01:14:28] that's seven which one you going to go
[01:14:29] after my
[01:14:31] friend and then it's delusion up next we
[01:14:34] have one that has 15 you can try to hit
[01:14:36] that one if you want try to kill one
[01:14:37] more get it down you guys may be killing
[01:14:39] one
[01:14:42] more you going to go at the strongest
[01:14:44] one I like it all right at the strongest
[01:14:45] it is so you hit the strongest one and
[01:14:48] that brings it down
[01:14:53] to 20 3 Health one of those Raptors is
[01:14:57] down to 23 Health
[01:15:02] now oh crap I didn't show you the sorry
[01:15:06] you didn't see the roll well you had the
[01:15:07] roll and there's your dark dice there
[01:15:09] for what it was sorry about that your
[01:15:12] roll hit I'm sorry I I forgot to show it
[01:15:15] if I swing my eyes closed you'll
[01:15:16] eventually hit weaken them ah yes yeah
[01:15:19] you can try swinging it
[01:15:21] again and oh you got a natural 20
[01:15:25] for the last swing and hit of the game
[01:15:28] well my friend you come running in with
[01:15:30] your eyes closed willy-nilly
[01:15:33] going swinging your sword and you know
[01:15:36] what because you have a natural
[01:15:38] 20 and you called some coming and
[01:15:41] Swinging willy-nilly at the Raptors
[01:15:44] we're going to give you an extra dice
[01:15:48] for your damage and see what
[01:15:51] happens oh my you got one 11 six 10 15
[01:15:56] damage you can kill you can kill the
[01:15:59] weakest one off and kill one or you can
[01:16:02] keep going and try to kill one or Scare
[01:16:03] one of the other ones away it's up to
[01:16:05] you what you want to
[01:16:06] do you're never going to open your eyes
[01:16:08] again you're just going to willy-nilly
[01:16:10] swing see what
[01:16:14] happens that just be a bad
[01:16:17] idea what what do you do can you hit the
[01:16:19] one the weak one you you willy-nilly
[01:16:21] swung so team did he hit the weak one or
[01:16:23] did he hit one of the stronger ones we
[01:16:24] got to know
[01:16:29] put our background back
[01:16:31] on good way to avoid seeing the nightmar

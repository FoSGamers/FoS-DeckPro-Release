[00:08:54] some upgraded ones from um from
[00:08:57] Originals I actually have some um uh
[00:08:59] there we go and those are some ones too
[00:09:00] all right you can put those back we
[00:09:01] don't need all of those you can put
[00:09:03] those back I actually have some uh
[00:09:04] starter decks too from um chapter one if
[00:09:07] people are interested so that's
[00:09:09] something I always forget to put in
[00:09:11] here we got those yeah but we we have a
[00:09:14] bunch of decks that we play with it is
[00:09:17] 60 cards in the deck um and you can have
[00:09:20] four of each card every single card is
[00:09:23] considered um so every single card is
[00:09:25] considered um your ink so that you can
[00:09:28] put down
[00:09:30] um like so you like this will be what
[00:09:32] you can call
[00:09:33] out hey yeah you going to pay attention
[00:09:36] and help at all how do we play it so uh
[00:09:40] you can you can call out or pick
[00:09:43] anything any number you want these are
[00:09:45] what are these this way when they
[00:09:47] flipped over this way what are they
[00:09:48] called uh ink yeah they're ink so you
[00:09:50] have to every card can is considered ink
[00:09:52] I'm not going to flip these over cuz
[00:09:53] they're part of the thing but you would
[00:09:54] have them and you'd put them down in
[00:09:55] your hand you'd play what you'd be like
[00:09:57] all right I don't want to play this card
[00:09:58] so I'm going to put it down for ink as
[00:10:00] long as it has a certain symbol on it
[00:10:02] and you use that as ink and they're all
[00:10:03] face down and then you just use that ink
[00:10:06] up to uh yeah there you go the card that
[00:10:07] you can play you put no put the ink down
[00:10:10] no yeah that would be you put down this
[00:10:12] there and then you would be able to play
[00:10:13] this card you kind of like yeah you
[00:10:15] you'd exert kind of like tapping and
[00:10:18] then you'd be able to tap it so you get
[00:10:19] one and then your strength your uh then
[00:10:21] that would dry for one round dry for one
[00:10:24] round the ink would dry and then you'd
[00:10:25] be able to play this card so that's kind
[00:10:28] of how that's how inkland I mean how uh
[00:10:31] lurana goes a little bit there little
[00:10:34] very basic understanding of it I mean I
[00:10:36] can go into it more with some more
[00:10:38] directions but I figure you know that
[00:10:39] was just a basic one thanks coming in

[00:39:00] remove all damage from chosen character
[00:39:02] I know you have to just decide what you
[00:39:04] want to do know though I know I think I
[00:39:07] if I was going to do a Peter Pan I'd try
[00:39:08] to stick as much Peter Pan wise as I can

[00:51:25] these and I'm going to do this
[00:51:27] going go this I'm going to do add
[00:51:35] poll here we
[00:51:37] go create a pole there let's see
[00:51:40] searching through the uncommons and I
[00:51:42] still haven't found a single Peter Pan
[00:51:45] yet not found a single Peter Pan or Bell
[00:51:49] well you might not find one in then they
[00:51:50] might be one of those ones that's not
[00:51:52] uncommons oh I've found a couple
[00:51:53] Brothers in
[00:51:55] here
[00:51:57] and I found the St in The Sword in the
[00:52:00] Stone all right cool I'm going to be
[00:52:01] using those probably when it comes to uh
[00:52:03] trying to build my deckup let's see what
[00:52:06] you guys are looking for here we do have
[00:52:08] in this pull box 81 cards 40% of them
[00:52:11] are um uh anywhere from two to four
[00:52:14] times two to three times a packs Merlins
[00:52:17] are two um two times a packs Genies are
[00:52:19] three times a packs there are 20 Merlins
[00:52:22] and there are 10 Genies in there and
[00:52:23] every single time you do it you get one
[00:52:24] of these for free just saying thank you
[00:52:26] for for hanging out with us and playing
[00:52:28] that's it together from just doing a
[00:52:30] little fun thing here and um we do combo
[00:52:32] deals here when you do multiple polls
[00:52:34] you get a little bit of a discount on
[00:52:35] all your stuff let's work together
[00:52:38] from huh let's work together from where
[00:52:42] is work together from
[00:52:49] yeah I don't know actually I don't know
[00:52:52] actually um possibly from Philipp or
[00:52:55] whatever it's called
[00:52:57] um oh the king one the king one there
[00:52:59] yeah I forgot about that I don't know
[00:53:02] maybe you need to get yourself three
[00:53:04] here three of the pulls potentially you
[00:53:05] could potentially pull out nine packs of
[00:53:07] cards if you're extremely lucky here of
[00:53:10] the not bad on that of Sword in the
[00:53:13] Stone Legend Of The Sword and the stone

[00:54:33] Greece VHS she literally wore the tape
[00:54:35] out she watched it so much when she was
[00:54:37] a kid what G it's a movie from I think
[00:54:42] the early 90s or late 80s with um they
[00:54:45] dance and sing the entire
[00:54:48] time oh so it's a musical basically kind
[00:54:51] of but not really it's a kind of yeah
[00:54:54] it's a musical yes you know what I'd say
[00:54:55] it's a musical
[00:54:57] we're going to go with yes it's a
[00:55:00] musical I only have 14 yes there was two
[00:55:04] of them there was like a one and two
[00:55:05] version of it yeah my sister watched
[00:55:08] watched them until they were literally
[00:55:10] gone it is a musical yeah all right all
[00:55:13] right it is considered a
[00:55:15] musical well because you said singing
[00:55:17] yep singing and dancing I I know I have
[00:55:19] to admit I like the movie myself growing
[00:55:21] up they um actually did a I was a little
[00:55:24] I was a little upset cuz the year after
[00:55:27] I went out of I know it was this Middle
[00:55:28] School I was there I used to do plays in
[00:55:29] middle school we did Joseph and the
[00:55:31] Technicolor Dream Coat when I was in
[00:55:33] eighth grade and uh the next year they
[00:55:36] did Grease and I was like you got to be
[00:55:37] [ __ ] me like that one I could have
[00:55:38] probably done in my sleep because my
[00:55:40] sister watches the movie all the time
[00:55:42] like I could easily have done that but
[00:55:44] anyways that was just you know obviously
[00:55:46] kid stuff but hey yeah if you want to
[00:55:48] try your luck here you get yourself a
[00:55:49] free pack of these which is a retro
[00:55:53] packs from like the '90s and maybe late
[00:55:55] ' 80s I even in there then you always
[00:55:57] get yourself your pack here that's
[00:56:00] pulled out maybe you get two times them
[00:56:02] maybe you get three times the packs
[00:56:03] that's there it's up to you with uh what
[00:56:08] happens and I have a feeling that I'm
[00:56:10] going to be jumping off here uh in a
[00:56:12] little bit here just to eat one of the
[00:56:14] nearby high schools is doing a play but
[00:56:16] you can't guess what it
[00:56:19] is I know is it going to be
[00:56:22] grease
[00:56:25] Wonder
[00:56:27] you know what I'm going to put it out
[00:56:28] there some of the high schools and like
[00:56:30] the um like there was my college uh that
[00:56:32] I went to they even did some of them
[00:56:33] sometimes they're actually pretty good
[00:56:35] little shop of hers that's a good one
[00:56:38] that is a really good really high
[00:56:40] school's putting that on that's an
[00:56:41] interesting one to put
[00:56:42] on my not yours Little Shop of Horrors
[00:56:46] that seems interesting put on for high
[00:56:48] school but uh you know what I could see
[00:56:50] him trying to pull that off some way is
[00:56:52] it hard to put no it's um some of the
[00:56:55] dressing and some of the way that people
[00:56:57] act uh back when that was The Little
[00:56:59] Shop of Horrors was made was a little um
[00:57:02] inappropriate for what people consider
[00:57:04] nowaday
[00:57:07] yeah maybe I'm thinking of a different
[00:57:09] movie Rocky oh I'm thinking of Rocky
[00:57:12] Horror Picture Show damn it that's what
[00:57:14] I'm thinking of I don't what then I
[00:57:15] don't know little shopa
[00:57:19] Horus the what the plant that seems to
[00:57:23] needs people the plant yeah it's it's a
[00:57:31] they oh I'm going have to figure that
[00:57:34] one out I don't remember that one it's a
[00:57:36] venus fly trap type thing yeah yes
[00:57:38] interesting all right I don't remember
[00:57:40] that one I was thinking Rocky horor
[00:57:41] picture show for some reason this is all
[00:57:43] I got Rick
[00:57:45] Moranis oh oh I know the movie that's
[00:57:49] like uh that's like um from honey I shrp
[00:57:52] the kid time frame now yes
[00:57:55] the Yes Rick Moranis he just said as
[00:57:59] soon as he said Rick Moranis I'm like I
[00:58:00] know exactly what you're talking about
[00:58:01] now I remember that movie oh wow that is
[00:58:05] definitely a throwback that's definitely
[00:58:07] a
[00:58:09] throwback can you picture them playing
[00:58:11] little TR H I can actually picture it
[00:58:14] it'll be a little interesting to make
[00:58:15] but you know I guess if you know you
[00:58:16] have a person in the the thing that can
[00:58:18] bend over and like grab people or maybe
[00:58:21] you have like two of them in there and
[00:58:22] they grab people and they pick them up
[00:58:23] and they suck them in or something I
[00:58:25] don't know that would be interesting to
[00:58:27] see this is all the Box what you have in
[00:58:30] here there are 81 cards 40% or 20 of
[00:58:35] them are um Merlins which are two times
[00:58:39] your packs 10 of them are Genies which
[00:58:42] are three times your packs and you get
[00:58:44] to choose whether you're going to go
[00:58:46] with flood borne or inlands now if you
[00:58:49] do do if you get three of them or
[00:58:51] whatever we don't allow you to get three
[00:58:52] of each one you have to pick a couple of
[00:58:53] each one but there we go that's what you
[00:58:55] do there if you want to like say you
[00:58:57] pick them out you get three separate
[00:58:58] ones you could do three flood borne but
[00:59:00] if you get like three of a kind I just
[00:59:01] want get like one flood borne and two
[00:59:04] inkland or one inkland and two foodborne
[00:59:06] and that type of thing but that's all it
[00:59:07] is there um and you could potentially
[00:59:10] come out with up to three packs of cards
[00:59:12] here if you want it's up to you what
[00:59:14] you'd like to do there um and we have
[00:59:17] also a little one here that I do a if
[00:59:19] you want to try your luck on three of
[00:59:20] them and every single time you get these
[00:59:23] retro packs here one of these are given
[00:59:25] to you free just for saying thank you
[00:59:26] for playing with us and having fun and
[00:59:28] pulling participating in the pull box so
[00:59:30] if you want you can get anything from
[00:59:32] like you know early '90s to uh late mid
[00:59:35] 90s is really what it is there huh can
[00:59:38] you buy the Retro packs the Retro packs
[00:59:41] I haven't thought about selling them
[00:59:42] before but I guess if somebody wanted to
[00:59:44] buy a bunch of them they could 15,000 of
[00:59:46] them that's why I don't have 15,000 of
[00:59:47] them I got I got a a few hundred of them
[00:59:49] don't worry about it but I'm going to
[00:59:50] use them lot watch so that's the pole
[00:59:54] box there if you want to try your luck
[00:59:55] and I can go
[00:59:59] to this here and
[01:00:01] change so
[01:00:04] uh if you are interested let me know it
[01:00:07] looks like somebody says they are not
[01:00:09] liking the pole box maybe I uh not I
[01:00:11] don't know what's uh what the problem is
[01:00:13] with it maybe you could let me know if
[01:00:15] there's what the issue with the pull box
[01:00:17] is well we don't have over 120 packs of
[01:00:22] uh cards so we have to only have 80 so
[01:00:25] if we shrink it down to be 80 so that
[01:00:28] we're 80 that way we actually 81 packs
[01:00:30] that way we have a 81 cards there that
[01:00:32] way we can have all the packs if it
[01:00:33] happen to sell out for some rir reason
[01:00:37] which never really happens when we're
[01:00:39] here it's happened once before but that
[01:00:41] was it spinning around in a circle
[01:00:45] interesting he's getting himself dizzy I
[01:00:48] see that hey how you doing
[01:00:50] em what we do here right now is we have
[01:00:53] a bunch of Lana we have foodborne and
[01:00:55] inkland we have a little bit of a game
[01:00:57] here a box here we have the potential of
[01:01:00] getting anywhere from Merlin there are
[01:01:02] 20 Merlin which are two times the packs
[01:01:04] and there are 10 Genies which are three
[01:01:06] times of packs and there are only 81
[01:01:07] cards in here so it's about a 40% chance
[01:01:09] of you pulling out two to three times
[01:01:11] and what happens is you always get one
[01:01:14] of these for free just for saying
[01:01:16] playing thank you for playing it's uh
[01:01:18] these are just retro packs from the
[01:01:19] early '90s and mid 9s and and stickers
[01:01:22] also and uh there's even some stickers
[01:01:24] there too but you always get one of them
[01:01:26] for free just to say thank you for
[01:01:28] playing uh your a choice of whatever
[01:01:30] you'd want and that's what we do here
[01:01:32] hopefully we can rip something open and
[01:01:33] see if we get any luck I found only 14
[01:01:35] of them 14 of those this fourth first
[01:01:39] box that's 14 Captain Hooks or 14
[01:01:41] complete total all right so look at the

[01:08:32] some additions to his drawings here he
[01:08:34] was building a deck before but that was
[01:08:37] a c that was getting long look for long
[01:08:40] task how many decks have you built to
[01:08:42] loran yourselves guys cuz I've only
[01:08:45] built uh we've only tried building one
[01:08:47] of them here so far and uh you know
[01:08:49] we'll see what I I've built one and then
[01:08:52] we took it apart because it was at the
[01:08:53] beginning and we was first starting and
[01:08:55] we're having a hard time finding things
[01:08:57] we took it apart to build other ones I
[01:09:00] Haven really play precons and upgrading
[01:09:02] a little you guys play them frequently
[01:09:06] yourself I don't know me uh we don't do
[01:09:08] a ton we don't do a ton we do it like a
[01:09:11] once every month or so we'll play a game
[01:09:13] that way we have everybody together
[01:09:15] playing but any specific ones you're
[01:09:17] looking
[01:09:18] for because I know we do have some
[01:09:20] singles too I just don't have them all
[01:09:23] organized or ready for anything here
[01:09:26] and I wanted to make sure the family
[01:09:27] cyer but I do Bill cyer oh okay then uh
[01:09:32] we'll uh I'll get some singles going at
[01:09:34] some point one of these times is that
[01:09:36] something you guys would be interested
[01:09:37] in if I like kind of scroll through the
[01:09:39] singles that we have I'm going to
[01:09:41] go well anyways we'll keep doing this
[01:09:44] seeing if you guys are interested
[01:09:46] hanging out with the family here we got
[01:09:48] some retro packs I know will wants to
[01:09:50] open one so maybe we'll just open one at
[01:09:51] the end of the show here just so we can
[01:09:53] get open one of these and see what they
[01:09:54] are in Mr Bugsy we're not going to open
[01:09:57] bugs because there's only a handful of
[01:09:59] those one we'll open those we'll have to
[01:10:00] wait for those to be opened there's only
[01:10:02] like three of those
[01:10:04] maybe so yeah these are there's only
[01:10:06] like three of The Bugs Bunny ones that I
[01:10:07] have so there's not a lot of those same
[01:10:09] thing with all my children right there
[01:10:10] there's only like two of those I think
[01:10:12] there's three of those left actually
[01:10:14] Angry Birds uh no we cannot open those
[01:10:17] I'll tell you which ones you can open
[01:10:18] when I let you when I wear it on okay
[01:10:20] how's
[01:10:21] that here's the mouth on biller we go uh
[01:10:25] on here with again with another three
[01:10:27] three pack deal here now you get three
[01:10:30] of these and what happens is they're 81
[01:10:32] cards 51 of them you get one pack 20 of
[01:10:36] them are Merlin where you get two packs
[01:10:39] and 10 of them are Genie where you get
[01:10:41] three packs and you just pick whether
[01:10:43] you want flood or
[01:10:45] inlands um we also have some first
[01:10:47] chapter if you want and you always get
[01:10:48] these for free we're just kind of
[01:10:50] hanging out we had some soccer practice
[01:10:52] we were waiting for that to be done H
[01:10:54] hung out with my oldest will here trying
[01:10:56] to see if we get some packs ripped open
[01:10:58] maybe uh see if we can get any any
[01:11:00] enchantments
[01:11:02] here that'd be pretty
[01:11:04] sweet what do you think some
[01:11:06] enchantments J party pulled out I know
[01:11:08] that the um the the uh blister packs a
[01:11:11] lot of people seem to have some good
[01:11:13] luck with those so that's why I was put
[01:11:14] them out there I guess we'll uh we'll
[01:11:17] just not have any uh not do anything
[01:11:19] with that any time seems like uh not
[01:11:21] maybe this is not the right time of day
[01:11:22] for uh some for for this I don't know
[01:11:25] I've had a lot of people coming in
[01:11:27] asking but uh a lot of people not doing
[01:11:30] anything other than that so maybe it's
[01:11:32] the pull box or something I don't
[01:11:37] know you guys just want pack because if
[01:11:39] you guys just want packs probably just
[01:11:42] uh pull a couple up there pull some put
[01:11:44] some of them out there and just pull a
[01:11:47] few of the things out of the box there
[01:11:48] that way it's not have as many in it
[01:11:51] Batman good job
[01:11:54] William there we go try your luck on one
[01:11:58] maybe you'd like that maybe not we'll
[01:12:00] see what happens there you always get
[01:12:03] that free retro pack with it
[01:12:09] too we'll see or uh what people are
[01:12:15] liking that was a pretty good uh pull
[01:12:17] box there especially at
[01:12:20] $9 you can get three of them even at $25
[01:12:23] would getting three of them now was
[01:12:25] really good hard to uh hard to beat that
[01:12:27] for
[01:12:31] Lana but it doesn't matter really always
[01:12:34] because uh people like giveaways instead
[01:12:36] of getting deals and that's the sad
[01:12:39] thing I don't do those because I can't
[01:12:41] afford to being a little small guy but I
[01:12:44] can do some givea uh giveaways if we do
[01:12:47] some sales but it's uh we need to get a
[01:12:49] few of those under our belt here maybe

[01:20:42] little earlier in the day here sometimes
[01:20:45] we need to do the uh the at night ones
[01:20:46] oh you're going to finish your other

[01:21:34] uh yeah it stinks people only come
[01:21:38] around to hang out for gies and I
[01:21:39] suspected

[01:21:45] days we'll actually have a group of
[01:21:46] people that come in to hang out for
[01:21:48] hanging out with us and ripping some

[01:21:56] joining in there tried talking about
[01:21:58] some of the old movie Things No One
[01:21:59] joining in there so sometimes I just
[01:22:01] talk to myself I guess it's really what
[01:22:03] it is I guess it's like a the individual
[01:22:05] podcast thing there but anyways because
[01:22:09] of what we're doing right now and
[01:22:11] nothing's been going on and uh I don't
[01:22:13] know maybe people are looking for me for
[01:22:14] magic because that's normally what I do
[01:22:16] is magic stuff in the evening or uh in
[01:22:18] the morning and stuff like that so we's
[01:22:20] see what happens thank you all I do

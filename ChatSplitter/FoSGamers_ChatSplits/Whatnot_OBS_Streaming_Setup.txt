I need you to help me create a message that is put in Discord that is an authorized thing for whatnot-related things for seller help, for host-related stuff, and I'm obviously dealing with OBS Studio right now, where I use it for streaming through whatnot. So what I need to do is thoroughly understand everything related to both of those whatnot platform, the terms of service on everything, OBS, how it streams to it, and all that stuff. Thoroughly 100% understand that. And then what I need you to do is I need to be able to ask how, when setting up whatnot stuff in OBS, I was told that I had to create a stream to have it made there and managed. When I do that and I have it, it allows me to have a scheduled stream. Does that mean I can schedule my stream for tomorrow on YouTube also, that way I can gain more people to save it on YouTube, and then from that point on, OBS will, whenever I connect OBS to it, I can start it with that stream selected and have it go into YouTube from OBS or through whatnot or wherever it is. I just need it to be able to know it's going to YouTube correctly, because when I was in the private mode, it didn't allow me to fully see that because it looks like it didn't have an option to do everything there specifically.

Jamey is dealing with OBS Studio, where they use it for streaming through Whatnot, and they need to thoroughly understand everything related to the Whatnot platform, the terms of service, and how OBS streams to it. They want clarification on scheduling streams in OBS for Whatnot and YouTube, and how to ensure their streams are properly set up to go to YouTube when connecting OBS. They also experienced issues in private mode, where it didn't allow them to fully see the streaming options.

Model set context updated.

[2024-09-25 16:46:07] ChatGPT:
To help you draft the Discord message and clarify your questions, here's a breakdown of what you need to know:

1. **Whatnot Platform & Terms of Service**: Whatnot’s platform for sellers and streamers is a marketplace that supports live commerce. Sellers need to follow specific **terms of service** that cover content guidelines, sales policies, and payment rules. When using **OBS** (Open Broadcaster Software), you're integrating an external broadcasting tool to stream directly to Whatnot. It’s important to ensure your OBS setup aligns with Whatnot’s policies on seller interaction, content, and any third-party tools used for streaming.

2. **OBS Studio Integration**: 
   - OBS is a software that helps stream your video content to various platforms, including Whatnot and YouTube. To stream on Whatnot, you need to **create a stream within Whatnot first**. Then you copy the stream key and URL provided by Whatnot into OBS settings under the "Stream" section.
   - **Scheduled Streams**: Whatnot allows you to create scheduled streams, so you can schedule a stream on both Whatnot and YouTube. You can then manage your stream from OBS. 

3. **Stream Scheduling for YouTube & Whatnot**: 
   - Yes, if you create a scheduled stream for **tomorrow on YouTube**, you can schedule the same event for Whatnot through OBS. In OBS, you can select the stream key and URL that corresponds to your YouTube stream, allowing you to manage the event from one place.
   - Once you connect OBS, it will stream to the selected platform. However, you will need to ensure you’re switching between the stream keys if you're streaming on multiple platforms (Whatnot & YouTube).

4. **Private Mode Concerns**: 
   - If you're testing in private mode and didn't see all streaming options, this is likely because **private mode restricts visibility**. In private mode, YouTube may not display all features, especially those related to scheduling and management of public streams. To fully verify your stream settings, it's better to test a stream in unlisted mode or a visible mode that allows for full interaction.

### Draft Message for Discord (for seller help on Whatnot and OBS-related issues):

---

**Hey Everyone!**

I’m currently integrating OBS Studio with my Whatnot streams and could use some help. I’ve set up my Whatnot stream and connected it to OBS, but I have a few questions about how scheduling works across platforms.

1. When I create a scheduled stream in Whatnot, am I able to also schedule it on YouTube? I want to be sure that I can start the same stream on both platforms through OBS when I go live.
   
2. I’ve noticed when I test in private mode on YouTube, it doesn’t give me the full range of options for verifying the stream. Is this normal? What’s the best way to ensure my streams are properly set to go live on both platforms?

Any insight would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!

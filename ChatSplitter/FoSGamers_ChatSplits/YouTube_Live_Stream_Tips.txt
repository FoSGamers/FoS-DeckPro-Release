Create a description for a whatnot video that I did just a live where I hit a thousand subscribers on YouTube. I would like to have that description so I can put it in the YouTube video for the live so that people are attracted to it to see how many subscribers we got and also the different things that we did for Bloomboro box openings and pack openings. We did a Bloomboro collector box opening, we opened a bunch of Bloomboro packs, a bunch of Ikoria packs, and a bunch of other cool games that we did with our customers that purchased stuff through the live videos that we have. Make sure you use YouTube or any type of website that you need to to figure out the best way to make this description along with how I can, having like hashtags and stuff in there, have like a few dozen hashtags in there. That way we can have them all, catching all bases needed for this video.

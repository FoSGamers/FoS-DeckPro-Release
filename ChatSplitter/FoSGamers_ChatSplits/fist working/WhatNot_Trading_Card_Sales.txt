Search online with Reddit, also on WhatNot, and figure out what people like for doing for buying things on WhatNot through the trading card category. Figure out what is the biggest type of sale things, if they're pull boxes, or if they're singles, or if it's some types of games or something like that. But I need to find what has the largest amount of views and try to figure out what we can do to either generate more and generate more sales.

### Overview of Popular Trends and Strategies for Selling Trading Cards on Whatnot

From recent discussions and reviews on platforms like Reddit and Collectors Universe, as well as insights from the Whatnot website itself, several trends and strategies have emerged for successfully selling trading cards on Whatnot.

#### Popular Selling Formats
1. **Live Breaks and Auctions**:
   - **Live Breaks**: Sellers open packs or boxes of cards live and viewers buy spots in the break, getting assigned cards based on a predetermined system (e.g., by team, player, or random assignment). This format is popular because it combines the excitement of live interaction with the thrill of potential high-value pulls.
   - **Auctions**: Items are listed for auction during live streams. Auctions tend to attract a lot of engagement as viewers bid against each other, often resulting in higher final prices due to the competitive nature of bidding【7†source】【8†source】.

#### Key Strategies for Success
1. **Building a Following**:
   - **Follower Engagement**: Successful sellers often run giveaways and other engagement activities to increase their follower count. Having more followers generally leads to higher viewer counts during live streams, which can drive up sales and auction prices【8†source】.
   - **Social Interaction**: The social aspect of Whatnot is crucial. Sellers who engage actively with their audience, respond to comments, and create a fun and interactive environment tend to retain more viewers and convert them into buyers【9†source】.

2. **Optimal Timing and Consistency**:
   - **Timing**: Evening and late afternoon streams generally attract more viewers compared to early morning streams. This is important for maximizing participation and sales during live auctions or breaks【7†source】.
   - **Consistency**: Regularly scheduled shows help build a loyal viewer base. Sellers who stream at consistent times each week tend to build a stronger, more reliable audience【8†source】.

3. **Product Variety and Pricing**:
   - **Product Mix**: Offering a mix of high-demand singles, sealed product, and lower-priced items can cater to a broader audience. Items like popular player cards or high-grade slabs often attract more bids.
   - **Affordable Pricing**: Lower-priced items and entry-level products tend to sell better, especially for sellers who are still building their follower base. High-value items can struggle to find buyers unless the seller has a significant following【8†source】.

4. **Promotion and Marketing**:
   - **Pre-show Promotion**: Promoting upcoming shows through social media and within the Whatnot app can help drive attendance. Effective use of social media platforms to announce shows, highlight key items, and engage with potential buyers is crucial【8†source】.
   - **Interactive Elements**: Including fun elements such as trivia questions, random giveaways, and live Q&A sessions can make the stream more engaging and keep viewers entertained, which can lead to higher sales【9†source】.

### Summary
For selling trading cards on Whatnot, the most successful strategies include conducting live breaks and auctions, building a strong follower base through engagement and giveaways, timing streams for peak viewer availability, maintaining consistency, offering a variety of products, and actively promoting shows. By leveraging these strategies, sellers can increase their visibility and sales on the platform.

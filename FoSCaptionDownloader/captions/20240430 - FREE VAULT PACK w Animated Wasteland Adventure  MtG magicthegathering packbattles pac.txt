[00:04:16] deep sea mermaids my wife's going to
[00:04:17] like this deck yeah so there's an app I
[00:04:20] actually use an app called
[00:04:22] um
[00:04:25] monobox that's what I use and if you
[00:04:28] it'll let you here so for inance inance
[00:04:30] here say I didn't know what that card
[00:04:33] was I just need to put it on a backing
[00:04:36] here and I can use my
[00:04:38] phone to scan it and it will tell me
[00:04:40] it's an overflowing
[00:04:43] Basin yeah so that's how I um that's how
[00:04:47] I use it because I use it sometimes
[00:04:48] people come out like I'll use them in
[00:04:49] games sometimes I'm like hey what does
[00:04:50] that mean I'm like a crap I don't know
[00:04:52] what that means let me get it for you or
[00:04:54] what what the card stands for and I
[00:04:56] can't like necessarily remember and
[00:04:57] it'll pop it up nice and easy that way
[00:04:59] we can hand off to somebody you just
[00:05:00] need like a white
[00:05:02] background yeah I'm a technology person
[00:05:04] so I found something like that then
[00:05:06] somebody showed me a better one which
[00:05:07] was that monob box which I like better
[00:05:09] than what I was using pricing and
[00:05:11] everything too correct and you can
[00:05:12] choose if the pricing from is from like
[00:05:14] three different sources or something
[00:05:15] like that like uh card card something um
[00:05:20] TCG and another one you can choose as a
[00:05:22] source some type of uh one that has to
[00:05:24] do with
[00:05:26] cryptocurrencies free free you can pay
[00:05:30] for a version of it but it is free I
[00:05:32] think I donated something cuz after like
[00:05:34] a couple months of using it I was like
[00:05:35] oh this is awesome and I think I donated
[00:05:37] like 20 bucks or something like that and
[00:05:39] I got it free or 10 bucks and I now have
[00:05:40] it something like that I have like extra

[00:07:05] right um and then uh she was reading
[00:07:08] some book and it's like a bestseller for
[00:07:10] the New York Times I guess she found and
[00:07:13] um it made her interested in because she
[00:07:15] came over and saw I was playing Magic
[00:07:16] with fairies and she like oh what is
[00:07:18] that that Fair's kind of like the book
[00:07:19] that my uh kind of like the fairies in
[00:07:21] my book oh look it does the same thing
[00:07:23] oh look he's acting the same way like
[00:07:25] the fairy in my book I'm like I've been
[00:07:26] telling you this for years
[00:07:33] H raining yes I understand that have to
[00:07:37] hate I hate when the weather is nasty oh
[00:07:39] Elite monster I like that one sarin
[00:07:41] Hydra I like the art on that one all
[00:07:43] right I'm gonna go I'm gonna be right
[00:07:44] back here in a second I'm G to go grab
[00:07:45] that I'm going to go grab that book so
[00:07:48] you guys can see what I'm talking
[00:07:50] about all right
[00:08:09] I don't know if this is the first one or
[00:08:11] not but this this this is the author and
[00:08:13] this is all the books she's got like
[00:08:15] four of them right now so if your wife
[00:08:18] likes books and wants to try New York
[00:08:20] Times bestseller my wife has not been
[00:08:22] able to put all these down and has
[00:08:23] literally read all of them to the point
[00:08:25] that she's she this she has no more of
[00:08:27] this author and she had to find another
[00:08:28] author that similar to start reading
[00:08:31] that's how good she liked this so I'm
[00:08:33] just throwing that out there for you and
[00:08:35] you and those those people that have
[00:08:36] wives that like things you know and oh
[00:08:39] oh oh also I wanted to put out here guys
[00:08:42] this is what my plan was for uh the boss
[00:08:45] battle with the actual final boss battle
[00:08:48] of our I knocked
[00:08:50] this I realized I just knocked that the
[00:08:53] actual boss battle at the end
[00:08:57] here I know
[00:09:00] rainy fishing is good for catching but
[00:09:02] crummy to sit in you know that is
[00:09:04] definitely true that is definitely true
[00:09:07] but you know what I've caught a lot of
[00:09:08] fish when it starts raining I will say
[00:09:10] that I do catch fish when it starts
[00:09:12] raining I got sidetracked on what I was
[00:09:13] just going to do oh yes that's what I
[00:09:14] was doing I catch a lot of fish when
[00:09:16] it's raining though I caught some of my
[00:09:18] biggest fish when I was raining actually
[00:09:20] I will say that too
[00:09:34] all right so my plan is that the uh the
[00:09:39] boss is going to have a Loot
[00:09:44] drop on some uh secret lair at the end
[00:09:49] of our adventure if we can get to it
[00:09:52] maybe today if depending on how what
[00:09:54] happens or not but we'll see but this is
[00:09:56] what I was going to have our boss go and
[00:09:58] have as a Loot drop the way I was going
[00:09:59] to do a Loot drop was I was going to put
[00:10:01] this down at a price that I was going to
[00:10:03] be happy with that's not it'll be lower
[00:10:06] than TCG but I'll be happy with it and
[00:10:09] maybe you guys will want to jump in on
[00:10:10] it that's what I was planning on doing
[00:10:12] as like a uh as the final thing for the
[00:10:15] boss if we get to
[00:10:18] it yeah Amanda might like that she's um
[00:10:20] I mean my wife literally could not put
[00:10:22] the book down she quite quite literally

[00:13:30] him anywhere though there's supposedly a
[00:13:32] Bob Ross Channel somewhere happy little
[00:13:34] trees
[00:13:35] yes like a dude that can literally go
[00:13:38] around and as pretty good in uh killing
[00:13:41] people from my understanding can just
[00:13:44] become this wonderful awesome loving
[00:13:47] person that
[00:13:49] just yeah how much for Fallout which one
[00:13:52] are you looking for
[00:14:08] I did not watch the Netflix do me entry
[00:14:10] recently that I will say I did not
[00:14:16] watch no I did not there are so there is
[00:14:21] um Fallout secet here there's the Vault
[00:14:23] boy there's special points of interest
[00:14:27] and those are either in um foil and
[00:14:32] nonfoil it's good but a bit sad I'm I
[00:14:34] might have to watch it then I might have
[00:14:36] to go and get some Netflix just to watch
[00:14:38] it or maybe watch it over at my um my
[00:14:40] mom's or something like that I didn't
[00:14:42] know that they had a bob ra special on
[00:14:43] that I got rid of Netflix like probably
[00:14:45] about a year ago cuz I wasn't watching
[00:14:47] it enough and my son was the only one
[00:14:49] watching
[00:14:50] it so if it came out recently I might I
[00:14:53] probably did miss it I'll have to say
[00:14:55] that
[00:15:00] nice oh flood I like that nice flood
[00:15:03] there we have our little Adventure game
[00:15:07] going when that came out on Netflix they
[00:15:09] OD all of the seasons
[00:15:12] oh damn that would have been awesome you
[00:15:15] know what I've actually debated before
[00:15:17] downloading them all just so that I can
[00:15:19] have them but I don't know where I can
[00:15:21] like I don't want to pay to download
[00:15:22] them because I'm I would hope they go to
[00:15:24] some type of organization or something
[00:15:26] like that because that's what he was the
[00:15:28] type of person he was but I bet it just
[00:15:29] goes to someone's
[00:15:32] pocket I'll have to do
[00:15:35] that I might have to find that now I
[00:15:38] might have to go in to get Netflix so I
[00:15:40] can watch him at night my wife's going
[00:15:42] be like what are you
[00:15:48] doing all righty nice art cards on these
[00:15:51] I like this art this Art Is
[00:15:55] Awesome all righty
[00:15:59] looks like we have a minute here and
[00:16:01] then I think what we'll end up doing is
[00:16:02] we'll build our dog I'll build our dog
[00:16:05] if no one else is and then uh maybe
[00:16:06] we'll try a uh we'll see what happens
[00:16:08] here we can't go on much with the
[00:16:10] adventure but we can do a little bit
[00:16:12] maybe ordinary magic of down descent
[00:16:16] interesting like the art there that's
[00:16:18] nice art there again I think that's what
[00:16:20] it is I think I like the art a lot on
[00:16:22] this that's what is getting me with
[00:16:24] these cards the art is what is catching
[00:16:26] me on this sorcery stuff and it's like
[00:16:29] like I when I remember when I was
[00:16:30] younger I like the other stuff cuz I
[00:16:32] remember like magic I considered it like
[00:16:34] playable art now the newer stuff is
[00:16:36] turning it's nice art but it's more like
[00:16:38] um CGI you can
[00:16:41] see well it seems more a CGI if that
[00:16:44] makes any
[00:16:48] sense oh thank you cool yeah I saw there
[00:16:50] was the secret layers on my phone there
[00:16:53] and uh I wasn't able to find them I
[00:16:54] found some like it maybe some on eBay
[00:16:56] but I'll have to go and check and take a
[00:16:57] look I didn't look a lot on
[00:17:00] that I just took a quick
[00:17:03] look font of life that's an in font F of
[00:17:07] Life font I'm guessing that's supposed
[00:17:09] to be F of life like a
[00:17:11] fountain rejuvenate infusion
[00:17:17] interesting stormy seas has anybody here
[00:17:21] played sorcery or had a chance to
[00:17:25] yet submerge minions all right cool not
[00:17:28] bad
[00:17:30] not bad on that wrath of seas Elite
[00:17:34] magic of meres Delo flood sights oh nice
[00:17:36] I like that one that is a nice one that
[00:17:38] reminds me of like what you would see um
[00:17:40] happening to Atlantis
[00:17:43] almost this is what I picture that's
[00:17:45] what I picture going on when uh if a a
[00:17:48] uh meteor or something like ever hit oh
[00:17:50] I like that
[00:17:52] lands that reminds me of a river type
[00:17:55] thing that I where I grew up actually
[00:17:57] where we had our old house there's was a
[00:17:59] little river by us and had a Bend I used
[00:18:00] to go ride my bike down and I could go
[00:18:02] out the edge and there would be like
[00:18:03] literally stuff like that with trees and
[00:18:05] going out and for all fall time it was
[00:18:07] pretty I actually have some pictures and
[00:18:09] some video from me doing that riding my
[00:18:10] bike on a different YouTube channel that
[00:18:12] I
[00:18:17] had hey you know I got into playing
[00:18:19] Magic uh at 95 I stopped playing in
[00:18:23] probably 2000ish when I I think it was
[00:18:25] when I went into High School more
[00:18:26] because I I was on the wrestling team
[00:18:28] and I just didn't have enough time then
[00:18:29] I got to college blah blah blah I
[00:18:30] started playing again about a year ago
[00:18:32] when my sons found my stuff and then um
[00:18:35] I saw this stuff somebody had one of the
[00:18:36] guys on one of the other streaming
[00:18:37] channels I was like oh those are nice I
[00:18:39] like those cards I bought one of them a
[00:18:41] pack myself just CU I wanted to see the
[00:18:42] art and once I got the art in my hands I
[00:18:44] was like oh this art is awesome and I've
[00:18:46] been kind of hooked on it since just
[00:18:48] because the art so I bought a few more
[00:18:50] packs and now I'm like all right I got I
[00:18:52] should buy this St so I can actually
[00:18:53] play the
[00:18:55] game because if I you know if I I feel
[00:18:57] like if I have to have the art here I
[00:18:59] actually should be playing the game not
[00:19:00] just staring at Art going oo pretty
[00:19:05] cards I mean I can keep going oo pretty
[00:19:07] cards but I feel like I should play with
[00:19:09] them you know so that's what they're
[00:19:11] made for to be played with right and
[00:19:14] itchy you know what that's fine you can
[00:19:15] get into whatever whatever many things
[00:19:16] you want I generally do like one at a
[00:19:19] time and once I start getting that then
[00:19:20] I'll maybe pick something else up like
[00:19:23] we do
[00:19:24] lurana um we do lurana magic and now I'm
[00:19:29] starting to do some sorcery so I did
[00:19:31] Magic lurana came out and the kids
[00:19:33] really like Disney stuff so we did some
[00:19:34] lurana and now I'm going into ma uh now
[00:19:37] we're going into a little bit of sorcery
[00:19:38] because it seems a little bit easier and
[00:19:41] nicely paced kind of like

[00:35:12] packs you
[00:35:13] want if you want to just start out and
[00:35:15] just do just the four four strength on
[00:35:17] them go right I mean the four skill
[00:35:18] points which is currently what we're
[00:35:20] building is the uh we're building the
[00:35:22] skill points of our dog now because the
[00:35:25] dog does not have uh
[00:35:28] we're not going to be able to dog do the
[00:35:29] dog with an engineer and um
[00:35:33] luck but the dog do have strength

[00:36:02] It Go I should have a four-sided dice
[00:36:04] here somewhere there it is they made a
[00:36:06] four-sided dice I never knew they could
[00:36:08] do that but anyways I'm going to use my
[00:36:09] four-sided dice here we're going to see
[00:36:12] where we add our skills to if no one
[00:36:14] wants to jump in oh itch's going to do

[00:39:24] character here now I'm going to give you
[00:39:26] an option do you want to wait until um
[00:39:30] do you want to wait to use your uh use
[00:39:33] this open it after the character's built

[00:39:59] anyways we do need to open it up anyways
[00:40:01] to see what happens here to see if we
[00:40:02] get any stuff for you all right so we're
[00:40:05] going to do that right now we're going

[00:40:21] saying so rolling a dice high low we got
[00:40:25] a 10 so that would be considered a low
[00:40:28] right so we're going to use
[00:40:33] it yep all right we're going to use it

[00:48:29] too yep hey Ty clone how you
[00:48:32] doing so yeah if you want to jump in on
[00:48:34] those you can definitely do that but as
[00:48:36] we're going at the moment since no one's
[00:48:38] doing anything here we didn't jump in
[00:48:39] what we're going to do is we're going to
[00:48:40] move on so we have built our our our
[00:48:43] doggo here our doggo sir barel lot and
[00:48:48] Sir barel lot with the rest of everybody
[00:48:50] we're going on our our finishing our
[00:48:52] adventure here well maybe maybe we'll
[00:48:53] see if we can finish it today maybe
[00:48:54] we'll continue tomorrow we're not really
[00:48:56] sure as we continue though was our
[00:48:58] adventure you just had a big fight there
[00:49:00] now you need to get of a little bit of
[00:49:01] rest and you maybe want to spend some of
[00:49:03] those pogs that you've come up with a
[00:49:04] bunch of those that you come with so as
[00:49:06] you're wandering through this wand you
[00:49:07] do actually see a larger City in the
[00:49:10] distance showing up it's not exactly to
[00:49:12] the South where you need to where where
[00:49:14] um sir where sweet vinage has been
[00:49:16] telling you to head but evilin seems to
[00:49:18] think that it's a good idea to go to the
[00:49:20] city because you're either going to be
[00:49:21] able to stock up on stuff for the boss
[00:49:23] battle or maybe you'll be able to uh
[00:49:25] help uh get some stuff that will help uh
[00:49:28] items and stuff to help you along the
[00:49:29] way with all the she's going Evelyn's
[00:49:31] going hey we got all kinds of pogs here
[00:49:33] we got like what five 10 20 30 and about
[00:49:36] 40 pogs here do we want to I think we
[00:49:38] should go and buy some stuff I just I I
[00:49:41] just say high tyone
[00:49:44] right I thought I did but your chat just
[00:49:47] for whatever reason showed up randomly
[00:49:50] again but so as we go
[00:49:54] here we're wandering we get to that City
[00:49:57] and now are we going to the city here
[00:50:01] itchy since it's your choice you are the
[00:50:04] one that's participating right
[00:50:06] now you built the dog and you get to do
[00:50:08] the next part of the encounter the next
[00:50:10] encounter which is going to be some
[00:50:11] stuff in the city here CU I think we
[00:50:13] need to build up unless you want to go
[00:50:15] further and ignore the city and just go
[00:50:18] further into the Wasteland
[00:50:30] how does the city look oh all right all
[00:50:31] right so the city is on the side on the
[00:50:33] edge of water it's right on the edge of
[00:50:35] the ocean you're in you're currently in
[00:50:36] the old burnt out areas of Florida
[00:50:38] you've finally gotten down to like cape
[00:50:40] canabal area and you're seeing up a uh
[00:50:43] it's now it's not a Cape Canaveral it's
[00:50:44] Cape C Cape can they call it Cape can
[00:50:47] the can Cape can Cape so that can Cape
[00:50:51] right now and as you're in can Cape you
[00:50:52] see a big uh there's actually a giant
[00:50:54] rocket that never actually went off
[00:50:56] that's there that's a bunch of people
[00:50:57] going in and out of it there's also a
[00:50:59] bunch of other buildings there that are
[00:51:01] uh that actually luckily weren't burnt
[00:51:03] out and blown up for whatever reason
[00:51:05] they weren't n all right so this is kind
[00:51:07] of like just it's a little small City
[00:51:09] all built around K canaval and that's
[00:51:11] what you're going into right now do you
[00:51:13] want to go and check it out or would you
[00:51:15] like to uh go and have you ever been to
[00:51:18] Cape Canaveral by any
[00:51:24] chance because if you haven't you have
[00:51:26] all right so picture Cape Canaveral the
[00:51:29] city is you're walking in through the
[00:51:30] gates of Cape Canaveral to the city and
[00:51:32] that's all over as all those buildings
[00:51:34] are still there and that's the city and
[00:51:36] it has all kinds of stuff in there we're
[00:51:38] not sure yet because we've never been to
[00:51:39] this
[00:51:40] city we just see that there's a big city
[00:51:43] in the distance and it looks like it has
[00:51:44] some lights has some good buildings that
[00:51:46] are lit up there's a bunch of Caravans
[00:51:48] going into it so it does have a lot of
[00:51:50] people going into it right now this
[00:51:51] caravan's going in and out
[00:52:05] all
[00:52:07] righty
[00:52:10] have all right so we're going to go to
[00:52:15] City oh look at that your family of mar
[00:52:17] Island very oh perfect perfect yeah I'm
[00:52:20] in um I'm actually like right around
[00:52:21] Daytona area you'll get packages from me
[00:52:24] to see where I'm from obviously so I see
[00:52:26] Rockets going off all the time so I made
[00:52:28] the game a little bit around my area
[00:52:30] that I'm living in we have dtown that we
[00:52:31] were in earlier now we're migrating a
[00:52:33] little bit South and we finally got to
[00:52:35] uh to uh Cape the can capap where we're
[00:52:39] now going through there and we see you
[00:52:40] know all that that's where we're going
[00:52:41] for our big city we're going you know
[00:52:44] who knows where we get to where it is
[00:52:45] further south where the uh where the
[00:52:48] where the problem is and the bosses I
[00:52:50] don't
[00:52:52] know so you're going to choose do we go
[00:52:55] to the city of Cape Canaveral which is
[00:52:58] now can Cape or do we uh do we just
[00:53:02] ignore it and continue along with our
[00:53:22] Wasteland all
[00:53:25] right we have been on the road for a
[00:53:27] while now we haven't had a good City for
[00:53:30] a little bit we've been on the road I
[00:53:31] think there's been probably four
[00:53:33] encounters we've been on the
[00:53:38] road might be on the fifth encounter I'm
[00:53:41] not
[00:53:42] sure we haven't had a city for a little
[00:53:44] while and the last thing that we had was
[00:53:46] a small village which is really only a
[00:53:48] couple
[00:53:50] buildings the first time we hit a city
[00:53:52] was uh a while ago right in the
[00:53:53] beginning we haven't hit a city since uh
[00:53:58] all right we want to kick our offer
[00:53:59] boots in the city all right sounds good
[00:54:01] all right itchy the four of you hit over
[00:54:04] the city you walk into that City you
[00:54:06] wander and then you see in there it says
[00:54:08] Cape can this and it's got some lights
[00:54:11] on it there's a globe on your right that
[00:54:15] interestingly is people walking into you
[00:54:17] don't remember oh interesting all right
[00:54:20] that's uh that's before you get into the
[00:54:22] city oh do you want to go to the globe
[00:54:25] before you get to the city or would you
[00:54:26] like to just go right into the city you
[00:54:29] want to go check the globe out that
[00:54:30] everyone's going that there's people
[00:54:32] going
[00:54:39] into ooh we don't know we have options
[00:54:43] here
[00:55:04] how do the people going in all right you
[00:55:06] got some ghouls going in there there's a
[00:55:08] few raggedy people going in there
[00:55:11] there's uh there was a super mune that
[00:55:13] walked in there and a few people that
[00:55:16] looked like they were like maybe
[00:55:17] potentially Traders but you're not sure
[00:55:20] they were carrying backpacks of stuff
[00:55:22] but that's what's going in
[00:55:23] there hey andyz they's coming back in
[00:55:28] so yeah where we what do you want to
[00:55:35] do let's pop in all right I think you
[00:55:38] know what I think that was a good idea
[00:55:40] it a good idea all right you go on over
[00:55:42] that Globe there's a couple people
[00:55:44] walking in you wander on in and finally
[00:55:45] you get you get inside and like kind of
[00:55:47] you du duck your head to get under you
[00:55:49] get in and you look in and it's all all
[00:55:51] around inside of
[00:55:53] it on all the entire circle around
[00:55:55] there's one dude sitting in the middle
[00:55:58] some ghoulish looking guy that has no

[01:09:20] space even though I put everything to be
[01:09:22] on on um
[01:09:26] online and not on my computer when it
[01:09:28] comes to Google Drive so I think
[01:09:29] something's going on with Google Drive
[01:09:31] where it's saving stuff or to my
[01:09:34] computer still and not uh not actually
[01:09:37] removing it so I'm going to while I wait

[01:09:53] computer is not
[01:09:59] not doing anything here to help to find
[01:10:03] where my

[01:25:09] and cleanly because I know myself I've
[01:25:11] gotten packages in the mail before where
[01:25:14] um you know it's not really the person's
[01:25:15] fault it's um it's more the mailing that
[01:25:18] occurs and it just the mail sends it and
[01:25:19] it just gets either destroyed some way
[01:25:21] or another and I and it's not the person
[01:25:24] that sh chips at fault so what I tried
[01:25:25] that's why like I try to like overpack
[01:25:27] cuz I've had things in the past where
[01:25:29] I've gotten them and I've been like
[01:25:30] Jesus who ran this [ __ ] package over
[01:25:32] and I had somebody the other day send me

[01:25:37] like what do you mean sent me a picture
[01:25:38] of a package that I sent like a month
[01:25:40] ago and the package it looks like it was
[01:25:42] ran over by the um by the uh by the by
[01:25:45] one of the trucks and the package was
[01:25:48] ripped open there's no cards there was

[01:25:52] like probably two
[01:25:55] probably like uh probably like six
[01:25:57] collector boosters worth of cards and
[01:26:00] that card that there was only one card
[01:26:01] in there that was had a dent on it from
[01:26:04] being from whatever happened all other
[01:26:06] cards were perfectly fine and I was like
[01:26:09] hey dude I'll do whatever I'll give you
[01:26:10] like some extra stuff after I know it's
[01:26:11] not my fault but I'll throw in like some
[01:26:14] red buttons extra for you to say thank
[01:26:15] you type thing and uh he uh yeah he was
[01:26:19] like I'm not it's not your fault I just

[01:26:22] package I'm like oh all right well

[01:27:35] you're very welcome almost Legend very
[01:27:37] welcome hey you know what we always seem
[01:27:39] to get some good luck with you so almost
[01:27:41] Legend seems to be a legend every time
[01:27:43] he comes in here actually I'll have to
[01:27:45] say that you're more of a legend than an
[01:27:46] almost
[01:27:49] Legend all right
[01:27:52] so I don't know if this is going or not
[01:27:55] it says it is let me double check here I
[01:27:58] might have to look on this is it
[01:27:59] actually going no it shows mystery bags
[01:28:02] on
[01:28:03] there what is going on
[01:28:07] here all right I'll give it a minute
[01:28:09] here maybe auction is acting
[01:28:15] weird getting some glitches on this
[01:28:18] where it won't let me do things ah all
[01:28:21] right rerun one minute start it there we
[01:28:25] go now you guys can see it
[01:28:27] running
[01:28:29] there yeah if you guys want to jump in
[01:28:32] on this and I think what I might do
[01:28:34] right
[01:28:35] now I might actually open
[01:28:37] up one of the secret layers that I have
[01:28:40] cuz the family gate got us some secret
[01:28:42] layers we held and I want to see what
[01:28:43] they look
[01:28:46] like and I want to see if I get anything
[01:28:48] special in that box also so is no one
[01:28:52] jumping in right now on the ENT
[01:28:54] game what I'm going to do
[01:28:57] is I think I'm going to open this so
[01:29:02] that means I'm going to remove these so
[01:29:03] that everybody can see a little bit
[01:29:04] better all right and we're going to open
[01:29:06] this up and we're going to see what we
[01:29:07] get I'm going to yelled at right now but
[01:29:09] that's okay we're opening it here we go
[01:29:12] you're
[01:29:14] special you're
[01:29:16] special let's
[01:29:18] see what we get in our Fallout secret
[01:29:20] layer you're special
[01:29:25] know I feel like I should just even keep
[01:29:26] this cuz somebody probably wants to buy
[01:29:28] it being a weird person I'm going to put
[01:29:31] that off this side somewhere we're just
[01:29:32] keep that right now all right here we go
[01:29:34] secret layer
[01:29:35] Fallout let's see what we got here we're
[01:29:37] going to run this
[01:29:41] again if you want to I'm going to open
[01:29:44] this up let's see what our Fallout has
[01:29:46] for our secret layer here let's see what
[01:29:48] this looks like I haven't seen any of
[01:29:49] these yet so this is the first time I'm

[01:30:01] like special one we get on the back
[01:30:03] something special let's see I don't have
[01:30:05] luck so most likely I'm going to get a
[01:30:07] junk card that's worth nothing but we're
[01:30:10] going to try anyways and check we have a
[01:30:12] waste we have a basic land waste

[01:30:24] actually do like the look of that all
[01:30:26] right let's um let's get to these and
[01:30:28] checking these things out here I hate
[01:30:30] this sticky stuff they do they make me
[01:30:32] feel like I'm going to bend the cards
[01:30:34] every
[01:30:35] time I'm going to try to cut the other
[01:30:37] one out just off of it without even
[01:30:39] without even opening it I think that's
[01:30:40] what I might do next time just cut them

[01:31:15] going to want the Fallout box so I'm
[01:31:16] going to put that in there that in there

[01:32:03] on that one there let's put this one in
[01:32:05] a sleeve
[01:32:07] anyways we supposed I'm supposed to do
[01:32:09] it this way I'm told supposed to put it
[01:32:10] in the
[01:32:11] top that way I can protect it from if
[01:32:14] anything happens I'm going to put it in
[01:32:16] a top loader here and we have to do this
[01:32:18] and open it
[01:32:20] up slide that in
[01:32:24] this way is what I've been told I need
[01:32:27] to do
[01:32:29] this and slide it
[01:32:36] in but it's not working I don't like how
[01:32:38] that works doesn't seem to want to work
[01:32:41] here doesn't seem to want to work
[01:32:44] here Ah that's what I was saying thank
[01:32:46] you thank you thank
[01:32:49] you I was just noticing that after it
[01:32:51] took me a second to notice that
[01:32:56] all right let me do this here and slide
[01:32:58] it down
[01:33:04] in all right it slid in there I don't
[01:33:06] know if I like doing it that way I think
[01:33:08] I like pushing it in the way that I've
[01:33:09] been doing it for years I don't like how
[01:33:11] it goes in upside down it doesn't slide
[01:33:13] in all the way I should just do a I
[01:33:15] should just buy one of the perfect fit
[01:33:17] SLE I have perfect fit sleeves I should
[01:33:18] just put those on oh that's what I
[01:33:20] should just do that's just silly I'm
[01:33:23] even little telling myself I have the
[01:33:25] perfect fit seves I should just put
[01:33:26] those on
[01:33:29] it if anybody wants to jump in our
[01:33:32] Wasteland Adventure is currently going
[01:33:33] on but I was just opening up the um the
[01:33:36] packs here that I have are uh one of my
[01:33:40] um Fallout ones here that way I can
[01:33:47] uh there we go that's what I'm going to
[01:33:49] do I'm going to put it in this
[01:33:51] thing here we go
[01:33:56] perfect fit
[01:33:57] one this one is annoying to me too it
[01:34:00] takes me a minute to figure it out
[01:34:01] because I think you do it like this
[01:34:02] where you slide it
[01:34:11] in I always have a problem with it with
[01:34:14] getting them
[01:34:17] in it's like they always Ripple a little
[01:34:19] bit at the edge but there we go got that
[01:34:22] in there
[01:34:23] yeah yeah that's better that's
[01:34:27] better now we can put it in and it's all
[01:34:30] protected nice except the water will
[01:34:32] still probably leak into it
[01:34:34] anyways I like how that looks waist now
[01:34:38] we have a steel Shapers gift nice steel
[01:34:41] Shapers gift I know these are all not
[01:34:43] expensive ones but hey I like how these
[01:34:45] look a lot search your library for
[01:34:47] equipment reveal
[01:34:50] it nice art on those I know the Fallout
[01:34:53] art is really cool Fallout art is really
[01:34:56] cool to me for personally that's I've
[01:34:59] been um I've played Fallout my entire
[01:35:01] life actually so like growing up I was
[01:35:04] um I was in line to buy Fallout cards I
[01:35:08] mean buy Fallout um the video game the
[01:35:10] first video game when I was a uh when I
[01:35:13] was in Middle School so like I've been
[01:35:15] playing Fallout for years and I was
[01:35:16] extremely excited when they came out
[01:35:18] with this hey Beantown are you
[01:35:21] from actually Beantown
[01:35:28] I got a qu are you actually from Boston
[01:35:31] or are you just like uh n or like
[01:35:33] normally we Nam Boston beant
[01:35:45] Town nice steel Shapers gift right there
[01:35:48] I like that one
[01:35:51] too cuz the reason I ask is cuz I um I'm
[01:35:54] actually from Massachusetts I grew up in
[01:35:57] that area going over there on a regular
[01:35:58] basis because of um sporting events or
[01:36:01] just going out and uh With Buddies to go
[01:36:04] and hang out in Boston so that's the
[01:36:06] reason why I asked
[01:36:09] that that's the only reason I was asking
[01:36:11] that remember everybody if you want to
[01:36:13] jump in on one of the adventures you can
[01:36:15] I do just have my uh giveaway going it's
[01:36:17] just those couple of cards that are
[01:36:18] those uh in the background there if you
[01:36:20] wanted them for hanging out with us just
[01:36:22] a little thank you for hanging
[01:36:26] out I've just been putting these ones
[01:36:28] into the sleeves here nice
[01:36:32] propaganda nice on the propaganda there
[01:36:36] cre can attack unless the controller
[01:36:37] type pays to I like that I like that one
[01:36:40] nice nice art I love the art on it it is
[01:36:42] very Fallout good art the only thing
[01:36:44] that I was upset about is they did not
[01:36:46] put the gore in there that Fallout has
[01:36:48] but at least we got the gore in the in
[01:36:50] the TV show I'll say that at least we
[01:36:52] got the gore in the TV show
[01:36:57] what do you think at least we got the
[01:36:58] gore in the TV
[01:37:05] show I would have preferred some weapon
[01:37:07] crafting in here of some kind CU that
[01:37:10] was a big thing in the game like making
[01:37:13] weapons or building armor some crafting
[01:37:15] of some type but they didn't do anything
[01:37:17] like that so that one was something that
[01:37:18] was a little frustrating when they did
[01:37:19] with the game here they needed some more
[01:37:21] weapons I feel
[01:37:24] what do you think all right no one Jo B
[01:37:26] on the giveaway there we just opened

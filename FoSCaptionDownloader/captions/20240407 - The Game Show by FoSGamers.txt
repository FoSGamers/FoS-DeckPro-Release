[00:00:04] a little bit I'm going need to raise
[00:00:06] that a little
[00:00:11] bit always when I'm looking up I'm just
[00:00:14] looking up at
[00:00:15] it I think I do that's what I think I
[00:00:18] need to raise the needs to raise that a
[00:00:20] little
[00:00:21] bit that's all right today I think we'll
[00:00:23] be all cry for the first one here with
[00:00:25] the adjustment then I'll have to do
[00:00:27] something to make a little bit of a
[00:00:28] raise underneath it well I know what I
[00:00:30] can do to raise it there we go here's a
[00:00:35] solution very quick
[00:00:47] one that that might work right now it's
[00:00:50] a little bit better it's a little bit
[00:00:52] better there we
[00:00:54] go all righty not too bad a little bit
[00:00:57] better there probably going have to get
[00:00:58] a camera over there I think that's what
[00:00:59] I'm going to have to do all right no we
[00:01:00] wanted our adventure right now that's
[00:01:02] okay we don't mind it we're just
[00:01:04] starting our things in the morning let's
[00:01:06] do uh a little bit of this a little bit
[00:01:08] of that a little bit of having fun today
[00:01:11] yeah I got a big new screen so I can see
[00:01:12] everybody's chat better actually I got
[00:01:14] my I got a screen in for my work is what
[00:01:17] it is and they um they gave me a new
[00:01:20] screen for work and I used my I was
[00:01:22] using my personal one for years for it
[00:01:25] and finally by getting a new one I was
[00:01:27] able to use mine here which which is
[00:01:30] pretty sweet and now I have all kinds of
[00:01:32] stuff hardwired in so we should have
[00:01:34] actually very little to no lag or issues
[00:01:37] like that because I'm quite literally
[00:01:39] hardwired in the internet and everything
[00:01:41] which is pretty sweet right
[00:01:44] now we'll throw this one up here if you
[00:01:46] guys want to try it for
[00:01:50] this hey chup how you doing let's get a
[00:01:53] little uh Gibby like we have Up Normally
[00:01:55] up let's see what we going to do right
[00:01:57] now we're going to throw oh this is one
[00:01:59] sign by me that was made I didn't make
[00:02:01] it but somebody else did one of the
[00:02:03] children made that that's a signed by me
[00:02:05] one there we go put that up there oh no
[00:02:09] the gibes are Chang set up again as
[00:02:11] always none of them are set up all right

[00:02:40] stuff please
[00:02:42] follow Link in the
[00:02:46] notes there we
[00:02:48] go we'll do the same thing I always do
[00:02:51] because I know it's never going to get
[00:02:53] to 100 but hey one of these days maybe
[00:02:54] I'm going to go long enough that'll hit
[00:02:58] 100 how's it going

[00:03:03] coming in Brian hope you're all having a
[00:03:05] great morning just getting our stuff up
[00:03:07] and running here I'm put those
[00:03:09] back give one of the gies up that we
[00:03:11] normally do it just takes them in and I
[00:03:13] always forget to put them
[00:03:15] in I also got a little bit of a new
[00:03:17] setup so the camera angle is a little
[00:03:18] different than it used to be but that's
[00:03:21] okay I'm going to get a different one I
[00:03:22] think I'm going end up getting a
[00:03:23] different one I have to mount I think
[00:03:25] that's what I'm going to

[00:04:19] sorry about
[00:04:22] that not trying to cause any annoyances

[00:04:28] pollen stuff is dropping out of the

[00:04:51] a regular
[00:04:52] basis
[00:04:56] so there we go ah I'm heard
[00:05:01] get rid of that
[00:05:05] now go back to this here we go there we
[00:05:11] go wonderful I just want to make sure
[00:05:13] things are good
[00:05:15] there and now we'll go back to our stuff
[00:05:19] here Al righty well let's see here
[00:05:23] everyone if we're having a good morning
[00:05:26] I know you guys are having starting out
[00:05:27] today let's see what we want to start
[00:05:29] start out with um no one's been wanting
[00:05:31] to go with any collector boosters that I
[00:05:33] have recently so I don't know what's
[00:05:34] been going on with that we've had a few
[00:05:36] of the Wilds about drain but not too
[00:05:38] much of anything else we'll see we'll
[00:05:40] see what's going on let's do a um this
[00:05:43] instead we'll do a quick game make it a
[00:05:46] quick game in case you know don't want
[00:05:48] to play along
[00:05:52] something and I think I might change the
[00:05:54] music right now I don't really feel like
[00:05:56] this right
[00:05:58] now Stone Temple piles are good but I
[00:06:00] don't be like it at the
[00:06:07] moment let's see um why not I'll do a
[00:06:11] little Aros Smith
[00:06:12] maybe all right no one uh trying their
[00:06:15] luck on our sudden death ones here I
[00:06:17] know we have some fun some good packs
[00:06:19] around just wondering what everybody's
[00:06:21] looking for this morning I know we have
[00:06:23] our giveaway that we normally run and we
[00:06:24] having some fun with those but we'll uh
[00:06:27] can you explain this one all right so
[00:06:29] this one is a very easy and
[00:06:30] straightforward one now the adventure
[00:06:33] game you go through these things here
[00:06:34] but with the pogman battle one it's just
[00:06:36] a straightforward one my wife actually
[00:06:37] was the one that came up with it very
[00:06:39] easy a lot of the times you get the
[00:06:41] highest to go against it but what it is
[00:06:43] is just very simple I have our pogs here
[00:06:46] I slam them down however many flip over
[00:06:48] over to seven which is the highest you
[00:06:50] can get for your strength is what you
[00:06:53] would have to go up against your boss
[00:06:54] here which is one of the 10 and if you
[00:06:56] beat the boss you get a uh we do a $1
[00:06:59] Loot drop for everybody in the Wasteland
[00:07:01] if the boss um EI no matter what you
[00:07:03] always get one of the Vault packs up
[00:07:05] here whenever you play and that's how
[00:07:06] that POG man one goes it's just a quick
[00:07:08] one my wife thought of to move things
[00:07:10] along quicker to get to the boss there
[00:07:12] and uh that type of thing and then the
[00:07:15] other one is the adventure game which is
[00:07:17] the one where you go through and um you
[00:07:19] pick a character on an adventure through
[00:07:21] the
[00:07:22] Wasteland and um you know you pick
[00:07:25] whatever character you want to be out of
[00:07:27] the ones that we have available and then
[00:07:29] once you have decided your character you
[00:07:31] travel through Wasteland and that's
[00:07:32] where you pick from the boxes here in
[00:07:34] the back um and that's where you pick
[00:07:36] your pack you travel through Wasteland
[00:07:37] and you do that and the same concept
[00:07:39] though is is to build up strength to
[00:07:41] beat the boss at the end so that we can
[00:07:43] do a $1 Loot drop for everybody in the
[00:07:45] Wasteland because sadly um someone
[00:07:47] complained about me doing where the
[00:07:49] winner got a pack of cards um because
[00:07:52] they considered that uh I guess not fair
[00:07:55] so they complained um and with that
[00:07:58] complaining I had to make a change to
[00:07:59] the way this is done so I no longer able
[00:08:01] to do that and that is due to um quite
[00:08:05] frankly bad apples I'd call
[00:08:08] them that's what happened so that's what
[00:08:11] that's how it works there a little bit
[00:08:13] kind of fun I can put out the um either
[00:08:15] of them I have a bunch of different ones
[00:08:17] they all kind of explained in the show
[00:08:18] not oh the show notes do not have are
[00:08:21] not oper right now explaining it no
[00:08:23] wonder why you're having a hard time
[00:08:25] give me one
[00:08:28] second
[00:08:39] come
[00:08:47] on there we go oh we got our winner

[00:08:53] second here let me get those up
[00:08:58] here um let me put those in here and
[00:09:01] that will probably help a little bit if

[00:10:38] our pogman one this is the quick game
[00:10:40] that we do my wife came up with this
[00:10:42] idea she also came up with our wheel of
[00:10:44] magic idea that we uh that we did last
[00:10:46] night not a lot of people showed up to
[00:10:48] the wheel of magic but that was actually
[00:10:49] pretty fun I think I think that was a
[00:10:51] good one last night anyways we'll put
[00:10:54] this out right now do a couple of
[00:10:57] those we throw out our um do the quick
[00:11:01] one here the pogman battle for the quick
[00:11:04] one see if you like it she actually came
[00:11:06] up with this one too she's uh pretty
[00:11:09] creative when it comes to the ideas I
[00:11:10] got a little bit of a set different
[00:11:11] setup so I keep looking up at the screen
[00:11:12] now I need to get a camera up here I
[00:11:14] don't like how I'm looking up so I can
[00:11:16] see better but I got have my my my
[00:11:19] monitor for work they finally sent me
[00:11:21] one after three years after three year
[00:11:23] anniversary they decided all right we're
[00:11:24] gonna send him a monitor so I got in a
[00:11:27] monitor now and I got to use my personal
[00:11:28] one for something personal
[00:11:31] finally what's up Darth how you doing
[00:11:34] buddy nice to see you coming in do Bob
[00:11:39] chup how y'all
[00:11:40] doing all right oh yeah you like this
[00:11:43] one we're gonna do a quick the quick uh
[00:11:45] quick thing here so this is two to go
[00:11:48] against the bosses now the bosses are oh
[00:11:51] those are not the bosses the bosses are
[00:11:52] over here the bosses are these 10 we
[00:11:55] shuffle them up and what happens is
[00:11:58] hopefully you you end up coming out
[00:12:01] with
[00:12:05] uh that's all going stay there I have to
[00:12:08] put those over
[00:12:09] here hopefully you're G to come out with
[00:12:12] more
[00:12:13] than SE seven or more I mean seven up to
[00:12:17] seven is the highest you can have have
[00:12:19] because if you have seven strength
[00:12:20] that's the highest that uh you can get
[00:12:21] to beat any of the bosses and that
[00:12:23] actually gives you a 60% chance of
[00:12:24] beating the bosses here so I'm going to
[00:12:27] put these right up here so we don't do
[00:12:28] anything him going to put the bosses
[00:12:30] right there and we're going to try our
[00:12:32] luck on this and see if we can do
[00:12:33] anything all right wifey is pretty
[00:12:36] creative she is she is pretty creative
[00:12:38] she actually got into this a little bit
[00:12:39] more than I was expecting all right so I
[00:12:40] gotta stand up to do this let's see if
[00:12:42] we get this all
[00:12:44] right oh we have one and two this one is
[00:12:50] from the game because it has something
[00:12:52] on the back of it you got two flipped
[00:12:54] all right we have two strengths so far
[00:12:56] and since you have two attempts you have
[00:12:59] one more attempt at this and I have to
[00:13:01] get better at this sometimes I'm good at
[00:13:02] this and I flip like all of them over
[00:13:04] sometimes I'm really bad at this and I
[00:13:05] haven't done it in decades so it takes
[00:13:07] me a while to get used to it all right
[00:13:09] let's see what we get here she's
[00:13:11] committed I know she's committed to the
[00:13:15] cause oh no we only got one more but
[00:13:19] that's okay that allows you to there is
[00:13:22] three bosses you could potentially beat
[00:13:25] with this so you have three strength
[00:13:26] here as you wander through this weight
[00:13:29] baseland do you want to pick any of your
[00:13:30] characters to see what you go up against
[00:13:31] as the boss because you can do that if
[00:13:34] you'd
[00:13:38] like all right I'm me just getting your
[00:13:40] packs out here putting those right there
[00:13:43] there we
[00:13:44] go and we're going to throw up against
[00:13:46] the boss here you get to pick one out of
[00:13:48] these 10 cards where would you like to
[00:13:50] go oh yeah Dealers
[00:13:54] Choice that's all right we're gonna go
[00:13:56] with this one let's see if this is a
[00:14:00] boss that you're gonna go up and you're
[00:14:01] gonna beat here let's go my friend and
[00:14:04] ah no Sauron came out oh look that's not
[00:14:08] supposed to be in front of everything
[00:14:09] saon came out giving you a little flick
[00:14:12] but luckily you land near Vault and you
[00:14:14] get a pick of one of these packs of
[00:14:15] cards in the background here what one

[00:14:37] four five six and seven now the children

[00:30:00] um got a lot of different things but
[00:30:03] nothing's going this morning it seems
[00:30:04] like it's a it's a rough morning here no
[00:30:07] one's gonna buy this I'm gonna put it up
[00:30:09] anyways because it's a rough morning and
[00:30:10] no one's doing anything so I might as
[00:30:11] well throw up
[00:30:14] Ridiculousness I have to put this down
[00:30:16] to edit to one
[00:30:19] point
[00:30:23] 4 1.4 is to get that out of the way
[00:30:28] I'll throw that one up there for
[00:30:33] this and make my dreams come
[00:30:38] true that will be three three uh I'll
[00:30:40] give that as two uh two hits if you want
[00:30:43] to attempt with that one because I about
[00:30:45] the cost of it see hopefully everyone's
[00:30:49] having a good
[00:30:51] morning I am looking forward to the
[00:30:53] Fallout series I think it actually looks
[00:30:55] like it could be good there's it's like
[00:30:57] the I as long as they make it about
[00:30:59] Fallout stuff and not try to um sprinkle
[00:31:02] in enough other other worldly crap I
[00:31:05] think it could be very good and so far
[00:31:07] it looks like it has been only Fallout
[00:31:08] stuff so we're going to leave it as I
[00:31:12] think we're going good so far I've
[00:31:14] actually been looking forward to it I've
[00:31:15] been following it a little bit not every
[00:31:17] single one of the um not every single
[00:31:20] one of them ads as yet but I've seen a
[00:31:23] few of them I don't think I've gotten
[00:31:25] all of them all of videos but
[00:31:30] all right well we're going to throw some
[00:31:31] of this out here we going keep throwing
[00:31:33] them out see if anybody wants anything I
[00:31:35] don't know if they if you all do though
[00:31:37] but yeah are you looking forward to
[00:31:49] it oh come on there we go why is that
[00:31:52] not doing all right there we go
[00:31:56] stay
[00:31:59] and throw this on for this
[00:32:02] here yes I know I
[00:32:06] mean well that's what I'm hoping they
[00:32:08] don't do because they have the potential
[00:32:10] of doing something very good with that
[00:32:11] geoism where they ignore like stuff and
[00:32:13] they just play the the story I'm hoping
[00:32:17] they can do that but we'll see too much
[00:32:22] stuff gets sprinkled in nowadays and
[00:32:23] they um they lose people from TV shows
[00:32:26] or I mean had established shows that
[00:32:29] have disappeared for the most part with
[00:32:30] their population because of what they've
[00:32:33] done mean I I personally feel like part
[00:32:36] of the reason why the the uh Doctor Who
[00:32:38] stuff flopped here was because people
[00:32:40] were fed up with it and they didn't like
[00:32:41] what's put in
[00:32:45] there but that's my opinion not others
[00:32:49] but I know there's enough people that
[00:32:50] complained about it I was like guys it's
[00:32:51] not that bad but at the same time there
[00:32:54] are people that thought it
[00:32:56] was
[00:32:58] I'm G to throw out two of
[00:33:00] these I'm supposed to grab two of those
[00:33:03] not one of them I'm going to do
[00:33:05] that but we'll
[00:33:07] see whatever I think uh we can do our um
[00:33:11] maybe we do a mini version of the wheel
[00:33:14] of magic here we can try this morning
[00:33:15] too since we did it yesterday and was
[00:33:17] successful but we don't have our I'd
[00:33:19] have to set the wheel back up I don't
[00:33:21] have that set up again but that's all
[00:33:23] right maybe we can do that not too hard
[00:33:25] to do I think I saved everything so I
[00:33:27] can just call CED over into the one here
[00:33:29] that we
[00:33:30] have did this not run I don't even know
[00:33:33] if that ran I'm guessing it did and no
[00:33:35] one wanted it though because that's
[00:33:38] uh but yeah with the um I don't know I
[00:33:40] played all the Fallout games from the
[00:33:42] beginning from like literally the first
[00:33:44] game waiting in line for the first one
[00:33:46] so I'm I'm GNA watch it just because
[00:33:48] it's Fallout but at the same time I'm
[00:33:51] going to end up being probably either
[00:33:52] happy or ticked off because it's Fallout
[00:33:54] if that makes any sense like guys this
[00:33:56] isn't Fallout like my thing like um I
[00:33:59] got frustrated with magic follows
[00:34:01] building guns and blowing people up
[00:34:03] killing them I know you don't need to
[00:34:06] put out killing people but at least put
[00:34:07] some building guns in there right like
[00:34:10] put some weapon building weapon smithing
[00:34:12] in like something that actually has to
[00:34:14] do with a
[00:34:15] game like a large part of it is
[00:34:18] building finding things to
[00:34:23] make G throw this out
[00:34:26] here
[00:34:29] that one frustrated me a little
[00:34:33] bit yeah yeah no I'm I'm interested in
[00:34:36] it see what happens I mean it could be
[00:34:38] good it could could flop I don't know
[00:34:40] we'll see um I just I personally think
[00:34:43] they need to uh stick to the stories
[00:34:46] that are there and not sprinkle in other
[00:34:49] worldly crap stick to the the world
[00:34:52] story that was
[00:34:56] created oh that's
[00:35:02] good sometimes they do yes they do a lot
[00:35:05] of times they do end up flopping um like
[00:35:08] I was surprised that there was that
[00:35:09] movie that TV show that had the video
[00:35:11] game with it a few years back that was
[00:35:13] pretty good it wasn't actually that bad
[00:35:15] the video game was decent too it wasn't
[00:35:17] great but it was one of those ones like
[00:35:19] if they had Fallout 76 come out and the
[00:35:22] Fallout TV show at the same time type
[00:35:24] thing like they did this would it would
[00:35:25] have been huge like the other one but
[00:35:27] they didn't do anything what is that
[00:35:29] move what was that TV show it was pretty
[00:35:31] good it was a few years ago oh dang
[00:35:35] it anybody in here uh it was there was
[00:35:38] it was like an alien race came down
[00:35:40] there was a planet that blew up or
[00:35:41] something like that and there was a
[00:35:42] bunch of different aliens that landed on
[00:35:44] earth the earth was starting a different
[00:35:45] terraform and different things because
[00:35:47] of the parts of the planet that landed
[00:35:49] so it made it a little bit different and
[00:35:50] people were going like um mine different
[00:35:52] stuff so I can't remember what it
[00:35:55] was oh what was it
[00:36:05] now I think it was a Sci-Fi TV show
[00:36:09] anyways we'll throw this up here see if
[00:36:11] anybody wants to try out our adventure
[00:36:13] game or our any of our games that we
[00:36:15] have we have um a bunch of different

[00:36:38] grab a
[00:36:40] drink all right well
[00:36:44] um let's see what we want to do what do
[00:36:49] we want to do next I don't have any of

[00:37:10] which is another two strength for four
[00:37:12] As You Adventure through the Wasteland
[00:37:15] that is my some of my last uh L of the
[00:37:17] Rings I don't know if I'm going to be
[00:37:18] buying anymore because they're so
[00:37:20] expensive that they're going to end up
[00:37:22] happening like what's happening with my
[00:37:23] Fallout over there that's just kind of
[00:37:24] sitting
[00:37:25] there because it was too expensive for
[00:37:29] people so I don't know if I'm going to
[00:37:31] be able to get any more of them so these
[00:37:32] are going to definitely be on my my last
[00:37:34] ones here uh probably Fallout for
[00:37:36] everyone for a while of Lord of the
[00:37:38] Rings I

[00:37:50] like a good long while that could
[00:37:52] actually be a good video a movie because
[00:37:54] of how open and potential the potential

[00:39:46] right there we
[00:39:51] go and I can always do random too if you
[00:39:53] want random will can pick but he always
[00:39:56] says he has bad luck with this game so
[00:39:58] he doesn't always like doing this
[00:40:00] one random please all right so with
[00:40:03] random I like kind of doing this when I
[00:40:05] do random it's like a little see if uh
[00:40:07] which one comes
[00:40:10] out oh oh is a back one is it a back one
[00:40:13] it's a back one we got one of the two
[00:40:15] back ones let's see what we get here we
[00:40:17] are looking for Treasure and we found
[00:40:20] treasure as a detective you see
[00:40:21] something shiny in the sand in the dirt
[00:40:24] and the rubble he goes and picks that up
[00:40:25] and he goes wonderful some treasure to
[00:40:28] trade for information as you wander
[00:40:29] through the Wasteland here I like it my
[00:40:32] friend we're going to do the same thing
[00:40:33] here we're going to try
[00:40:34] random oh this is another back one but
[00:40:37] it's not the exact no not a couple few
[00:40:39] from the back this time all right let's
[00:40:42] see what we go with we are looking for a
[00:40:44] friend or an item a friend you can trade
[00:40:47] for information or an item to help you
[00:40:49] along the way and as a detective you
[00:40:52] have found a map that map is
[00:40:58] a helpful thing because it points the
[00:41:00] detective in a direction to help them so
[00:41:03] they take that map and that treasure and
[00:41:04] they go H I think I have some Clues on
[00:41:06] what to do here I'm kind of going
[00:41:08] backwards though but I found the
[00:41:09] treasure and I'm going backwards so
[00:41:11] what's this starting point I'm going to
[00:41:12] you one two three four five six strength
[00:41:16] as you wander through this Wasteland
[00:41:17] that's a little weird that I have
[00:41:18] treasure and then I have a map
[00:41:20] afterwards wonder what's going on here
[00:41:23] but that's
[00:41:24] okay because
[00:41:28] that's what it was your friend wait no
[00:41:30] I'm
[00:41:34] sorry your friend come over came over
[00:41:36] with a map
[00:41:38] there here we go let's see what we get
[00:41:41] from here is it a friend or an enemy
[00:41:43] that you find along the way we're going
[00:41:46] to go with this one let's see do you
[00:41:48] find another friend or is it an enemy
[00:41:50] that you find along the way let's find
[00:41:53] out oh no the fungus dinosaur comes
[00:41:56] running running around that Wasteland
[00:41:59] you get a little bit scared from that
[00:42:00] giant dinosaur you drop your treasure
[00:42:05] along the way but that shiny thing
[00:42:06] distracts the dinosaur and you notice on
[00:42:09] the map there's a spot of a starting
[00:42:11] point you see in the distance a vault
[00:42:14] you go wandering in and you see some
[00:42:17] safe in the safe an envelope you get to
[00:42:19] pick one of these for playing our game
[00:42:21] and you get to pick any of those to see
[00:42:23] uh there and then what happens though is
[00:42:25] in the distance as you get into that
[00:42:26] vault there's a boss that pops out right
[00:42:28] in front of you but oh no with your one
[00:42:31] five strength you can beat a good amount
[00:42:33] of these bosses but let's see which boss
[00:42:35] it is that happens to pop out in front

[00:56:31] anything we have a lot of uh not a lot
[00:56:34] going on tonight today this morning I
[00:56:36] said
[00:56:37] tonight we can do a pick your own break
[00:56:40] not too bad we woke up I woke up like I
[00:56:43] normally do had a good good rest I
[00:56:45] actually been sleeping better recently
[00:56:46] which is weird how you doing
[00:56:49] Mom good
[00:56:50] [Music]
[00:56:51] morning me uh we'll throw out a pick
[00:56:54] your own maybe you P throw out a pick
[00:56:55] your own break
[00:56:57] let's
[00:56:58] do a Fallout all right this is what
[00:57:02] we're going to do for the pick your own
[00:57:03] break we're going to do a
[00:57:05] Fallout
[00:57:09] with
[00:57:13] this and this
[00:57:17] so now sometimes the you guys can pick
[00:57:20] them yourself if you want but this is
[00:57:21] how we're going to do the pick your own
[00:57:22] break here all right so these packs I'm
[00:57:26] going to get rid of the POG thing there
[00:57:28] but those packs are what are going to go
[00:57:29] up let me do a little bit of math
[00:57:47] here all right so this is going to go up
[00:57:51] for
[00:57:53] this and I'm going to take a minute to
[00:57:55] explain it for all that way it's a very
[00:57:58] simple very easy quick one here for all
[00:58:00] of you that are hanging out but I'm
[00:58:01] going to give it a minute to explain it
[00:58:03] for you the way that you understand it
[00:58:04] that will work very easy so two of you
[00:58:07] have to buy in on this now what you do
[00:58:09] is one of you the first one that buys in
[00:58:12] um what we do is um we'll uh do
[00:58:16] something to choose who gets first or
[00:58:18] second now it's going to be uh like um
[00:58:22] you know maybe we uh we you know roll a
[00:58:24] dice type thing and and we say high low
[00:58:27] or or maybe I don't know we'll figure
[00:58:28] out who goes first or second um I think
[00:58:30] I'll put a wheel up maybe that's what
[00:58:32] we'll do we'll put the wheel up and
[00:58:33] we'll spin it and um what will happen is
[00:58:36] that person whoever goes first they get
[00:58:38] to pick their pack actually you know
[00:58:39] what whoever buys first will do it
[00:58:41] whoever buys first will be able to pick
[00:58:43] their pack here um which whatever ones
[00:58:45] they want and then what happens is we're
[00:58:47] going to do it just very simple we
[00:58:48] Shuffle these up and then we go one
[00:58:51] person the next person but whoever B
[00:58:53] bids and buys first will be able to pick
[00:58:55] if they get the first card or the second
[00:58:57] card in the break when we do the Fallout
[00:59:00] going back and forth you always get your
[00:59:01] ones here your time SP and your Exelon
[00:59:04] but we break the Fallout for you since
[00:59:06] people like to have the Fallout there
[00:59:08] now that was a little explanation of the
[00:59:11] pick your own break now you can do this
[00:59:12] yourself with whatever you want you can
[00:59:14] also do a different one say you want to
[00:59:16] do like a digit break or you want to do
[00:59:18] a uh a color break I I've done those
[00:59:22] before and we can do those with a bunch
[00:59:24] of people but I threw up a little uh
[00:59:26] small one here figure that might be an
[00:59:28] intriguing thing for some of you to try
[00:59:32] out so I'll throw that up again now that
[00:59:35] I have explained it give you give you
[00:59:38] guys another minute to figure it out if
[00:59:40] you want to try
[00:59:45] it
[00:59:47] Xing Angel thanks uh light Angel thanks
[00:59:51] coming in do appreciate it and I myet
[00:59:54] connection should be a lot better now
[00:59:55] because I have everything hardwired into
[00:59:57] my computer how's your morning going
[00:59:58] hopefully it's good I have a little I
[01:00:00] call it pick your own break but that's
[01:00:02] what I'm putting up right there at the
[01:00:03] moment I'm going to put away our pogs
[01:00:05] because no one wants to do the POG flip
[01:00:07] even when I discounted it no one wanted
[01:00:09] to jump in on it but that's okay we'll
[01:00:12] see what you guys uh get some luck one
[01:00:13] of these days and try our games I think
[01:00:17] this is one of the days it's uh Sunday
[01:00:19] is everybody spent all their money
[01:00:20] Saturday night drinking they're all just
[01:00:23] hanging around
[01:00:24] uh over just staring at a
[01:00:27] phone that's what I'm saying they're all
[01:00:30] hung over staring at a
[01:00:33] phone or they're hung over not awake
[01:00:35] that is the other potential they're hung
[01:00:36] over not awake that is
[01:00:39] true hung over not awake is the other
[01:00:42] option chill for now oh well it's you're
[01:00:45] at work hey you know what I used to work
[01:00:48] overnights so I understand it I I
[01:00:50] completely understand that I
[01:00:53] work you play MTG you can't afford it
[01:00:56] drink hey I like that you know there's
[01:00:58] um it's a I have the when we were at the
[01:01:00] store I bought something and somebody
[01:01:02] goes hey we were my kids were there and
[01:01:04] they were like hey at least you know
[01:01:05] they're not going to be spending money
[01:01:07] on drugs because all they can do is
[01:01:08] afford
[01:01:11] cards I thought that was pretty funny I
[01:01:14] was like yeah yeah that's pretty
[01:01:15] accurate it's pretty accurate I'll give
[01:01:17] you
[01:01:18] that so you guys can pick different
[01:01:20] packs too so say you want something
[01:01:22] different out of the um out of my uh byy
[01:01:26] now or something you know you can all
[01:01:28] right geosam thank you this is one
[01:01:30] signed little pack built by built by
[01:01:33] Will signed by no one saying thank you
[01:01:35] for hanging out with us because people
[01:01:37] have been asking to get stuff like that
[01:01:39] and we don't mind doing that when you
[01:01:40] come in and get it because that's kind
[01:01:42] of what we do we support as hopefully
[01:01:43] you guys will follow us on YouTube
[01:01:45] that's the whole reason we do our
[01:01:47] channel here is because uh our stream
[01:01:50] here is because um my son would like to
[01:01:52] have a channel on YouTube so we can open
[01:01:53] boxes and we can't afford to do that on
[01:01:55] not rich so uh I had to find a way to
[01:01:58] afford it and he ended up helping
[01:02:00] finding this so we do these so if you
[01:02:02] can just follow us that's all we ever
[01:02:03] ask follow us do some uh maybe watch
[01:02:07] some videos comment every now and again
[01:02:09] because the boys do like when they get
[01:02:10] to see some comments that makes them
[01:02:12] feel
[01:02:13] good let me just grab a couple of these
[01:02:15] things my bags have fallen there we
[01:02:19] go my bags are falling to the
[01:02:24] ground get over here
[01:02:26] yeah there we go look at those bags back
[01:02:29] there all right now what I'm going to do
[01:02:31] next is we're going to do this
[01:02:34] next we're going to throw out another
[01:02:37] one of our things here one of uh this is
[01:02:41] oh this is built by Will signed by me it
[01:02:43] looks like every now and again you'll
[01:02:45] get a me signed
[01:02:49] one start that and I will throw out the
[01:02:53] adventure and I'm going to put it out
[01:02:55] with let's do the adventure in the
[01:02:57] Wasteland here all right Wasteland
[01:02:59] Adventure let's have some fun with that
[01:03:01] one let's put it out with
[01:03:05] um let's do Commander Legends for two
[01:03:09] strength to start out and if you guys
[01:03:13] want something different you guys can
[01:03:14] tell me too you see everything up there
[01:03:16] that I have and let's do
[01:03:22] um
[01:03:24] some lost Caverns nobody's been going
[01:03:28] lost Caverns recently so you know what
[01:03:30] I'll leave that alone nobody's been
[01:03:31] going that recently so I'll leave that
[01:03:32] alone too let's go with a couple ioria
[01:03:36] people do seem to be liking ioria a
[01:03:37] little bit so we're going to go to ioria
[01:03:39] again that'll get you four strength on
[01:03:41] your adventure to start in the Wasteland
[01:03:43] you guys can pick it out yourself too I
[01:03:45] don't need to keep picking these but
[01:03:47] what you want to see though is if you
[01:03:48] notice check what the price is right now
[01:03:52] all right the price would normally be 25
[01:03:55] but
[01:03:56] because we do multiple things together
[01:03:59] this is what I keep trying to tell
[01:04:00] everybody when you do multiple things
[01:04:02] together there is a little bit of a
[01:04:03] discount we can give because it helps me
[01:04:05] to do multiple things together I don't
[01:04:07] have to pay all the whatnot fees so I
[01:04:09] pass that savings on to you guys which
[01:04:11] is why instead of 25 I know it's not a
[01:04:13] big savings but it's 22 23 here that way
[01:04:16] it helps you a little bit on your
[01:04:17] shipping and you get to play the game
[01:04:19] and have some fun you would uh pick your
[01:04:22] character here now that you have four
[01:04:24] strength you go for a little wander
[01:04:26] through the Wasteland and see what your
[01:04:28] character is that you end up
[01:04:30] getting maybe I should practice my uh my
[01:04:34] POG my poging my POG
[01:04:37] mans my slamming

[01:04:54] wheel of magic and six that don't by the
[01:04:57] way me Wheels magic mom's idea may not
[01:05:00] have been the best one maybe they'll
[01:05:02] probably they'll like it though when uh
[01:05:04] when Mom's up there in a dress doing van
[01:05:06] white
[01:05:10] though Friday we're gonna try that
[01:05:13] Friday we're gonna try that all right
[01:05:15] let me um no leave that alone please um
[01:05:18] let me do this here we put that up no
[01:05:20] one one of those that's okay I'll put
[01:05:23] those back and I'm going to put up my
[01:05:25] poll that my wife reminded me I needed
[01:05:27] to put
[01:05:28] up let's see though this let's put out
[01:05:31] some um let's put out some draft
[01:05:35] stuff why not we're going to start out
[01:05:37] with six
[01:05:41] strength for our adventure in the
[01:05:43] Wasteland here we're going to go with a
[01:05:45] bunch of packs two ioria two ion and two
[01:05:50] Wilds of All Drain no one's going to buy
[01:05:53] any of this but I figured what the hell
[01:05:56] I'm G to put it on
[01:06:02] anyways and let's throw that on
[01:06:10] for this here if you would like
[01:06:15] it that's a lot of packs there for
[01:06:18] 36 let me get the poll up that my wife
[01:06:21] is
[01:06:24] saying so what do we for topics
[01:06:28] Steph Steph we need topics
[01:06:34] though okay all
[01:06:39] right yes I like it I will do
[01:06:42] that should we have a topic of the day
[01:06:47] to
[01:06:49] discuss
[01:06:51] during my
[01:06:54] streams
[01:06:57] I like it we'll do
[01:07:02] that all right there we go throw that
[01:07:05] out there no one wanted our giant stuff
[01:07:08] here so how about this maybe let's throw
[01:07:11] out another pick your own break but this
[01:07:13] time pick your own break we are um I
[01:07:16] really don't know what to do this
[01:07:17] morning it seems like everybody is uh no
[01:07:21] one really wants anything that I have at
[01:07:22] the moment I think everybody's probably
[01:07:24] looking for Thunder because and I know
[01:07:26] I'm not going to have that until Friday
[01:07:28] because the deal with my distributor is
[01:07:30] I cannot put it out until Friday which
[01:07:33] is also another reason why I'm working
[01:07:35] on getting my own store so I can have it
[01:07:37] early like everyone
[01:07:38] else and if I have it early like
[01:07:40] everyone else that will be
[01:07:43] awesome because then I'll have better
[01:07:45] access to distribution too better access
[01:07:49] I'm G to throw this out here no one's
[01:07:51] going to buy anything that I have
[01:07:52] because no one wants anything this
[01:07:53] morning they just want to hang out for
[01:07:55] the giveaways um so I'll just keep doing
[01:07:58] that throwing those out there and keep
[01:08:00] giving things away to people today uh
[01:08:02] and I think that's what the day is going
[01:08:04] to
[01:08:05] be probably a day of
[01:08:09] losses but sometimes days are like that
[01:08:12] and it's just a support the show day
[01:08:14] right as long as you can support the
[01:08:15] show and come out and hang out I don't
[01:08:17] really care as long as you come out and
[01:08:19] hang out with us and um maybe as long as

[01:11:40] on screen I don't know if anybody even
[01:11:41] wants to play The
[01:11:47] Adventure I really don't know what to do
[01:11:49] this morning very very uh silent on
[01:11:52] everyone I think everybody's so tired
[01:11:54] from pounding beers last night that they
[01:11:56] can't
[01:11:59] focus
[01:12:01] yeah Sundays are always odd they are
[01:12:04] always
[01:12:05] odd sometimes they're like ridiculous
[01:12:08] and I'm like I can't keep up then other
[01:12:10] days it's like I don't know what's going
[01:12:13] on right now I think everybody's been
[01:12:18] sleeping me yeah I slept all
[01:12:24] right
[01:12:26] uh let's see what it
[01:12:28] says says uh
[01:12:33] 71% for five hours and 50 minutes so not
[01:12:38] bad for me that's pretty good better
[01:12:40] than the four hours I generally
[01:12:45] do yeah I normally sleep like four hours
[01:12:47] a
[01:12:48] [Laughter]
[01:12:49] night I think I need to get a better
[01:12:51] camera though up top because I don't
[01:12:53] like how it's looking up at me when I
[01:12:54] look at the thing
[01:12:57] whatever that's okay iconic likes it
[01:13:00] iconic coming
[01:13:02] in nice set there now you're going to
[01:13:05] play our game this is going to start you
[01:13:07] it is going to be three strength because
[01:13:08] you get two for this and one for that
[01:13:10] now if you haven't played the game
[01:13:12] before you get to choose a character
[01:13:14] iconic and this what happens you get to
[01:13:16] travel through the Wasteland as that
[01:13:18] character you always get one of the ball
[01:13:19] packs at the end of the Wasteland
[01:13:21] Adventure but if you beat the boss we
[01:13:23] end up doing a $1 Loot drop
[01:13:25] for those in the Wasteland and now being
[01:13:28] a couple only adventures in they the
[01:13:29] drop isn't as big as it could be but as
[01:13:32] we the more Adventures that we do
[01:13:33] through the day the drops get bigger so
[01:13:36] like I've got to the point where I was
[01:13:37] dropping collector boosters because we
[01:13:39] had a lot of people coming in with them
[01:13:41] you'll do a technician all right like we
[01:13:43] had like I think we got to like 20 games
[01:13:44] and I end up dropping collector boosters
[01:13:46] because 20 games in as a technician you
[01:13:51] go wandering through the Wasteland my
[01:13:53] friend you have the potential you look
[01:13:56] for treasure in your
[01:13:59] Wasteland what is it that you want to go
[01:14:01] with there is 78 78 and four I mean uh
[01:14:05] 12 for blue you can pick any one of any
[01:14:09] out of each of these get one out of each
[01:14:11] of these to see what you get for your
[01:14:12] strength in the Wasteland
[01:14:18] I out of each so you get one red one
[01:14:20] green and one blue sorry if I wasn't
[01:14:22] clear on that yes because what happens
[01:14:25] is you get one and they give you plus
[01:14:26] one strength or minus one plus one or
[01:14:28] minus
[01:14:32] one you have a certain amount of
[01:14:34] strength to see how much strength you
[01:14:36] can get uh to maybe beat the boss at the
[01:14:38] end there so we'll go random all right
[01:14:40] random when we do random I like to do
[01:14:42] this and get a little shake out and see
[01:14:43] which ones come out here oh looks like
[01:14:47] one of these two all right detect as a
[01:14:52] technician you go wandering through this
[01:14:54] Wasteland and I'm going to pin so you
[01:14:55] can see better and you look for Treasure
[01:14:59] wonderful that technician leans over he
[01:15:01] sees some treasure shining in the
[01:15:02] Wasteland leans over picks it up and
[01:15:04] goes I think I have that that's awesome
[01:15:05] I can trade for that maybe I can build
[01:15:07] something with that I am now at four
[01:15:09] strength as I wander through the
[01:15:10] Wasteland here so as you wander through
[01:15:13] that that
[01:15:14] technician you are looking for a friend
[01:15:17] or an item that can help you along the
[01:15:19] way so you now have fun that's two oh
[01:15:22] there's three actually there I'm GNA
[01:15:23] with the middle one
[01:15:25] along the way you're looking for an item
[01:15:27] or a friend that will help you and as a
[01:15:32] technician you have a copy and that is
[01:15:35] good because that technici that copy
[01:15:38] comes
[01:15:39] over and you find a copy in the ground
[01:15:43] they copy that item and create another
[01:15:45] treasure for you making two Treasures
[01:15:48] with five strength now you go wandering
[01:15:50] through this Wasteland wonderful you go
[01:15:53] and say maybe I can find a friend is
[01:15:55] that a friend in the distance coming
[01:15:56] towards me I'm not sure iconic might be
[01:16:00] a friend we shall find out as you wander
[01:16:03] through this Wasteland there's something
[01:16:05] coming towards you and you go hey buddy
[01:16:08] are you here to help and then it ends up
[01:16:10] being a fungus dinosaur and that is not
[01:16:13] here to help you drop your copy of your
[01:16:16] treasure but luckily by dropping that
[01:16:19] copy of the treasure the fungus dinosaur
[01:16:22] is distracted by The Shining of that
[01:16:24] treasure and you're able to sneak away
[01:16:26] with four strength away from him but you
[01:16:30] see a vault in the distance you go
[01:16:31] wandering towards that Vault you see and
[01:16:34] what happens is you get out and in front
[01:16:36] of you on and right before you jump into
[01:16:39] that get to that Vault right out in
[01:16:40] front of you jumps a boss this boss big
[01:16:43] bad boss goes I'm taking your
[01:16:46] treasure coming through that Wasteland
[01:16:49] and we're going with this said random on
[01:16:52] them all we're going to go with that
[01:16:54] that boss jumps out in front of you is
[01:16:57] oh no the
[01:16:58] flare the flare comes out of the
[01:17:01] Wasteland grabbing you throwing you
[01:17:03] around you drop your treasure in that
[01:17:06] process but luckily when you land you
[01:17:09] land right next to the Vault and in that
[01:17:12] Vault you wander in and you find
[01:17:14] yourself
[01:17:15] a envelope which looks like something
[01:17:18] saved in it in a vault which one would
[01:17:20] you like to go with my friend I am sorry
[01:17:23] you did not beat the boss but you always

[01:24:59] insane whatever guess I'm not supposed
[01:25:01] to have that at the
[01:25:06] moment go
[01:25:09] on know you're the
[01:25:13] one no one wants to do anything um I
[01:25:17] have at the moment let's see if we want
[01:25:18] to do something different I'm trying to
[01:25:20] think what we want to do maybe we want
[01:25:22] to do some red buttons
[01:25:30] we'll do
[01:25:31] uh we'll do this then actually let's
[01:25:34] throw the big blue book out maybe
[01:25:36] somebody wants to do the big blue book
[01:25:38] try their luck on
[01:25:47] that yeah I don't I don't do like a lot
[01:25:49] of my personally I try not to do things
[01:25:51] that are like more towards the gambling
[01:25:53] side I try to make sure you're
[01:25:54] guaranteed to get something like a packs
[01:25:56] but where you could get something extra
[01:25:58] uh from here because or like a
[01:26:00] guaranteed to get a single or whatever
[01:26:02] it is because I I'm not a big
[01:26:05] um aspect of the gambling of it it's
[01:26:08] very addictive to to me and others if
[01:26:10] that makes any sense and I don't want to
[01:26:13] support that as much as I as as much as
[01:26:15] I could like I do have the um the red
[01:26:18] button there which is a good one so I
[01:26:20] could do something like this here so
[01:26:22] like say let's throw out
[01:26:25] some red buttons all right I can do that
[01:26:27] that's my biggest thing that I have as a
[01:26:28] gamble on any of this is my red button
[01:26:31] here so let's do
[01:26:34] um let's do this I'll
[01:26:40] do 15 we call it 15 red
[01:26:48] buttons
[01:26:49] 15 red
[01:26:53] buttons
[01:26:55] and we'll call
[01:26:57] that instead of $15 we'll make that 12
[01:27:00] and I'll say
[01:27:02] there's we'll say there's 20 of those
[01:27:04] since I'm not a big fan of doing those
[01:27:06] regularly there we
[01:27:11] go we go why not I'll throw it out
[01:27:18] there try that maybe someone wants to do
[01:27:20] the red buttons
[01:27:23] here
[01:27:26] that's uh the red buttons are those here
[01:27:27] you can potentially win as you see in

[01:53:57] dble Teddy
[01:54:00] Huer
[01:54:02] Tom all right we got a Ted Tad zel
[01:54:05] Dwight Evans I remember Dwight but I'm
[01:54:07] I'm from New England so I remember the
[01:54:09] Red Sox there that's probably the reason
[01:54:11] why oh there's your uh your little um
[01:54:15] Special World
[01:54:18] Series hologram card Mike P oh a little
[01:54:22] Mike I remember
[01:54:24] Mike Shawn
[01:54:26] dutson Jeff thread
[01:54:29] way and a Kevin Rome oh I remember
[01:54:34] him I remember him I played baseball
[01:54:36] when I was younger growing up I don't
[01:54:38] know if anybody remembers any of those
[01:54:39] but I played baseball when I was grow up
[01:54:40] younger so I remember some of the
[01:54:41] players especially because I was in
[01:54:43] Boston and you know being a Red Sox fan
[01:54:45] you remember those
[01:54:49] players all right I'll get those in
[01:54:51] there and we're going to all your stuff
[01:54:53] back to
[01:54:59] you four what $50 for
[01:55:11] what T Madson I don't know what you're
[01:55:13] talking about
[01:55:16] buddy I don't even like doing this
[01:55:19] generally people ask to have it here um
[01:55:22] I'm not not sure what you're confused
[01:55:23] what the issue
[01:55:27] is
[01:55:30] nef
[01:55:32] nef
[01:55:35] MTG there you go nef
[01:55:37] nef like I said I don't not I'm not a
[01:55:40] big fan of the red red button one there
[01:55:42] but uh we do it because it was
[01:55:46] requested literally because it was
[01:55:48] requested I like doing the ones that I
[01:55:50] do where we do you get your pack you get
[01:55:52] whatever you're paying for and then you
[01:55:54] can get the little extra for it but nef
[01:55:56] nef some people like doing the big ones
[01:55:58] and trying them out
[01:56:03] there the pull box the reward in the
[01:56:06] pull box is if you look at actually what
[01:56:08] the pole box has there um you go to the
[01:56:11] red button there are 1,600 cards all
[01:56:15] right T Madson the reason why it is such
[01:56:18] a big thing like that with the potential
[01:56:20] of what it is is because you have 1,
[01:56:22] 1600 cards there's over there a bunch of
[01:56:24] collector boosters
[01:56:26] is one two three
[01:56:31] four five six seven eight different
[01:56:35] collector boosters there's
[01:56:37] 15
[01:56:41] 20
[01:56:42] 30 it looks like
[01:56:46] 25 sets and drafts and then there's
[01:56:50] also the also the uh Lord of the Rings
[01:56:54] that's in there
[01:56:56] too yep so if you get the yes it is and
[01:56:59] that's why I don't even do it the whole
[01:57:01] point of this was I actually was
[01:57:03] expecting this was going to be something
[01:57:04] where people would add on like say we do
[01:57:07] um for instance this would be something
[01:57:10] that would be a worthwhile thing to
[01:57:12] do like I do this
[01:57:15] one where is it let me get to the big
[01:57:19] blue book
[01:57:20] here where is it
[01:57:24] here big blue book this is what I was
[01:57:26] expecting people to do with this all
[01:57:28] right so say you do the big blue book
[01:57:31] here now I'm going to show off the Big
[01:57:33] Blue
[01:57:38] Book okay well uh that's why the T
[01:57:42] Madson if you don't uh you don't jump in
[01:57:44] on those ones that's why I don't
[01:57:45] generally do those people wanted to try
[01:57:48] it they asked for me to put those on
[01:57:49] there so I did that not a problem
[01:57:56] yeah exactly some people like the big
[01:57:58] shot some people don't that's why most
[01:58:00] of my games aren't that way and that is
[01:58:02] the only one that I have like that but
[01:58:04] this is the one that would be say this
[01:58:06] is what I'm expecting people to do with
[01:58:07] a red button so they be like you know
[01:58:09] what give me the big blue book and the
[01:58:10] red button because the Big Blue Book you
[01:58:12] get on your numbers you pull out and you
[01:58:14] get your money's worth so say you get
[01:58:17] this is what you can have there is your
[01:58:19] pull deer say you get one of these cards
[01:58:21] you either get the card card with a pack
[01:58:23] there or you get if the floor Is A
[01:58:27] Wasteland here you know the floor Is A
[01:58:28] Wasteland on that one so that's what I'm
[01:58:31] trying to explain to you most of my
[01:58:32] other games are not set up like the red
[01:58:35] button see as you can see here with the
[01:58:37] big blue book you could call out of
[01:58:39] balin's Tomb a $100 card for $27 here
[01:58:44] and all the other ones you end up
[01:58:45] getting either packs with the cards to
[01:58:48] add up to having enough to where the low
[01:58:50] is the floor is 22 so this is what I'm
[01:58:53] trying to explain to you most of the
[01:58:55] things that I do do not set up that way
[01:58:57] it's more was built so that oh Nerf is
[01:59:00] doing it it was mostly built so that
[01:59:02] people could do a red button with
[01:59:05] something else but then people kept
[01:59:07] asking to do the red button alone so I
[01:59:08] put the red button out by
[01:59:11] itself and nobody needs to do it if you
[01:59:13] don't want to it's always your choice to
[01:59:15] now Nerf with the red button I will put
[01:59:18] these in one of my bags here so I'm
[01:59:21] waiting for my buddy car it's going to
[01:59:23] be like 3 months though to build me a
[01:59:25] bag to make me a bag so that I can have
[01:59:27] a cool thing to shake him up in all
[01:59:34] right um there's a small chance Madson
[01:59:37] correct there's a very small
[01:59:39] chance so here we go we're going to put
[01:59:41] this in here for the Big Blue Book we're
[01:59:43] going to shake these up and let me uh
[01:59:45] and we're going to figure out what
[01:59:46] number it is that you get out for your
[01:59:48] thing here let's
[01:59:51] go
[01:59:55] good luck we're going to get this and
[01:59:57] then we're g to get five of those poles
[01:59:59] there and here we go we're going to do
[02:00:03] you got yourself that's fat that's fat
[02:00:08] and
[02:00:10] number 37 can you see
[02:00:15] that
[02:00:17] 37 your lucky number is 37 really well
[02:00:20] that's fat man so you're going to get
[02:00:22] that POG to go home with let me get them
[02:00:25] put away though I got get them put away
[02:00:26] so that we have them back in here and if
[02:00:27] anybody else wants to play
[02:00:33] it make sure they're all in there we're
[02:00:35] not missing any there we
[02:00:38] go put that back over there put that
[02:00:42] right there and then number
[02:00:45] 37 in our book
[02:00:47] here here we go you're going to number
[02:00:51] 37 with which
[02:00:53] is you've got yourself a Guardian
[02:00:57] Project and without the infinity booster
[02:00:59] because I don't have that here you have
[02:01:02] the uh you're going to get a um
[02:01:07] AFR collector
[02:01:09] booster because we are out of the
[02:01:11] infinity so you're going to get yourself
[02:01:13] an AFR collector booster right
[02:01:16] here with your Guardian Project and then
[02:01:20] I'm going to give you your five do you
[02:01:21] want want me to pull out random for you
[02:01:24] and you can also get um I have one two
[02:01:28] three one two three on each
[02:01:32] side all right yeah High handed I'll do
[02:01:34] five random one one two three four and
[02:01:42] five oh that you know what that was six
[02:01:45] a six one came out whatever we're going
[02:01:48] to give you six anyways because a six
[02:01:49] one came out why whatever that happens
[02:01:52] sometimes and decided it needed to jump
[02:01:53] out in my hand so I guess that means I
[02:01:55] need to give it to you all right we're
[02:01:57] going to do
[02:01:59] that we're hot hands at all all right
[02:02:01] we're goingon to feel for the good

[02:16:33] that would be the person that would have
[02:16:34] witness and reported one of the other
[02:16:36] games that I had where I was giving away
[02:16:38] I you so put it this way when I um did
[02:16:41] the original Adventure game when I first
[02:16:43] did it and I actually got in trouble
[02:16:45] somebody said that I was doing it and it
[02:16:46] was wrong they didn't like it so what I
[02:16:48] did was you would play the adventure
[02:16:49] game and if you beat the boss
[02:16:51] you got a free pack you got a free pack
[02:16:53] of cards on top of what you paid for
[02:16:55] already just something free extra if you
[02:16:58] beat the boss while somebody complained
[02:17:00] about it and got me
[02:17:03] suspended that's the type of people I
[02:17:05] have to deal with so I had to change a
[02:17:07] game around because they didn't like the
[02:17:10] fact that they didn't win something free
[02:17:12] when they played even though they got
[02:17:14] everything they paid for they complained
[02:17:17] about it so that's I ended up having to
[02:17:18] change the game and that's why the
[02:17:19] game's a little bit different now and I
[02:17:22] just do my best to handle people as I
[02:17:24] can
[02:17:29] right exactly it's when you get a pack
[02:17:32] it's a gamble FL flat out when you buy
[02:17:34] any pack of cards it's a
[02:17:37] gamble exactly best you can do charm

[02:44:47] with the troubled kids when I worked at
[02:44:49] the U high school when I was a
[02:44:51] teacher I liked it
[02:44:54] personally but one of the things I had a
[02:44:56] problem with with the other

[02:45:01] those kids even though they knew stuff
[02:45:02] because I taught it to them I knew they
[02:45:03] knew
[02:45:05] it

[03:11:37] it to it do doesn't
[03:11:46] though
[03:11:58] like
[03:11:59] yesterday I was uh I was setting up my
[03:12:02] uh tablet and everything my new
[03:12:05] computer well my new monitor which
[03:12:07] actually not a new monitor my old
[03:12:08] monitor for my computer so it look
[03:12:12] better and
[03:12:14] um with that being said I uh I now have
[03:12:19] a giant screen here so I can see
[03:12:20] everything better and my tablet my
[03:12:22] computer screen is down here so I can
[03:12:24] see like the order orders and
[03:12:26] stuff and then because of that the Hub
[03:12:31] that I had whatever reason the monitor
[03:12:33] wouldn't work being plugged in the mac
[03:12:35] and knowing Macs being finicky I ended
[03:12:37] up being like you know what I need an
[03:12:38] adapter to plug directly into the mac
[03:12:40] and that's what it was now I got a nice
[03:12:43] big screen which is why I can see
[03:12:44] everything so much better when I'm when
[03:12:45] you're talking when I'm talking now and
[03:12:47] I'm
[03:12:48] reading heavy thanks for coming back in
[03:12:51] I just bumped my desk big
[03:12:53] time just bump my desk big time there
[03:12:57] all right we don't want to do the PO
[03:12:58] clip that's the second time I do play
[03:13:01] Commander I actually um I go to the
[03:13:04] store uh whenever I can and I have time
[03:13:06] I don't have that much time anymore
[03:13:08] because I have to pick my kids up from
[03:13:09] the bus always but when I have time I do
[03:13:13] go to the store to play some Commander
[03:13:16] uh I got to play with the scrappy
[03:13:18] survivors deck last week which was
[03:13:20] pretty fun I had had a chance to play
[03:13:21] with it yet so that was pretty good do
[03:13:23] you play yourself what do you
[03:13:30] play we'll throw out
[03:13:33] um let's do
[03:13:37] this let's do one of some more of those
[03:13:40] maybe you mostly do draft see I haven't
[03:13:43] had a chance to do much draft like my
[03:13:44] store does it but every time I go to the
[03:13:46] store no one wants to do draft so I end
[03:13:49] up showing up and we just end up playing
[03:13:50] Commander so uh
[03:13:56] yeah that's my scenario at least so
[03:13:59] that's why I always end up playing
[03:14:00] Commander because that's what everybody
[03:14:02] does I try to get people to but like I
[03:14:05] show up for like oh it's draft night
[03:14:06] sweet but then it ends up being
[03:14:08] Commander night every time I feel like
[03:14:11] they need to like push it or
[03:14:15] something oh nice Zer all right d
[03:14:19] safe you never know wild traffic wild
[03:14:22] traffic and the well yeah the people at

[03:21:14] you at too much I didn't want to like
[03:21:16] overcharge you for it B so I just want

[03:22:46] definitely room for everyone I don't do
[03:22:48] things like singles I'm not a not a big
[03:22:50] singles person I do stuff like that on a
[03:22:52] regular basis so like there's so many
[03:22:54] other people that do and they do a way
[03:22:55] better job than I do so like that's why

[03:23:01] again on like special
[03:23:10] occasions I know I have that spark
[03:23:12] double

[03:24:10] is there it is I knew I had
[03:24:15] it now it is a foil I don't know if that
[03:24:18] matters to you or not but it is a foil
[03:24:23] version so it'll be a little bit
[03:24:28] more on the
[03:24:34] card spark
[03:24:36] double let me uh check
[03:24:44] that sorry guys took me a minute there
[03:24:47] wanted to check and make sure I had
[03:24:50] everything that is going to be
[03:24:54] 15 for that one or 14 for that one so 16
[03:25:09] total if you want them let me know I
[03:25:12] might have I might have a nonfoil of
[03:25:14] spark double um I'd have to take a
[03:25:17] little bit longer to look for it
[03:25:20] though do you want me to if you want I
[03:25:22] can take um if you want
[03:25:25] uh I can look after the show for the
[03:25:29] other spark double because I'm pretty
[03:25:31] sure I have another one um and um I'll
[03:25:34] have it available for the next time I'm
[03:25:36] on how's that
[03:25:39] sound that sound good I'll do that I'll
[03:25:41] do that for you so I thought I had
[03:25:44] another spark double that was nonf foil
[03:25:47] but um I guess I don't know where I put
[03:25:51] it I thought I had a non-foil one but
[03:25:54] we'll get your black market up right now
[03:25:58] okay all right took a little minute
[03:26:00] there but I don't mind doing things like
[03:26:02] that helping people
[03:26:04] out all right we got uh I mean I got a
[03:26:06] bunch of cards here to go through
[03:26:08] so let's get to our single on screen on

[03:27:43] that I liked hanging out with them all
[03:27:45] the time and and I never had it happen
[03:27:47] so I figure they made a comment about
[03:27:49] doing it that way I'm like you know what
[03:27:50] I never thought of that before so with
[03:27:52] that little input I actually decided I'd

[03:27:56] more now so that you guys can uh get the
[03:27:58] one you're looking for and not have to

[03:30:54] we W my wife and I watched it last night
[03:30:56] on um on
[03:30:58] um uh
[03:31:01] Prime so yeah I don't know it wasn't bad
[03:31:05] it wasn't great though it was
[03:31:06] entertaining for a good chunk of it the
[03:31:08] end had that they had to have that good
[03:31:10] little story good feel story at the end
[03:31:12] of it though it was very weird at some
[03:31:14] parts a little uncomfortable at places
[03:31:17] but
[03:31:18] hey that's okay we're going to do why
[03:31:21] not let's finish out let's see if we can
[03:31:23] finish out our our POG flip I think
[03:31:26] we've been having some luck with it
[03:31:27] let's keep doing that I'm going to put
[03:31:28] these out
[03:31:29] there I'm going to try adding that onto
[03:31:32] it we're going to do one of them down
[03:31:33] here and see
[03:31:35] it you can do the POG flip here as you
[03:31:38] see all these are out you have your
[03:31:41] chance of getting any one of these which
[03:31:44] has a pack on the back of it now the
[03:31:46] pack could be a collector booster it
[03:31:48] could be a draft booster it could be a
[03:31:50] set there are currently four ceilings
[03:31:52] left out of
[03:31:54] the 30 and there are 12 that have been
[03:31:59] pulled so yeah I don't know
[03:32:02] math POG flip you literally just pick a
[03:32:06] Pog right here my
[03:32:09] friend and it flips you flip it over I'm
[03:32:12] just angling it so we can see
[03:32:14] better and you flip one over and you see
[03:32:17] what you get on the back of it and
[03:32:19] whatever you get on the back is the pack
[03:32:21] of cards you get now you could
[03:32:22] potentially
[03:32:23] get um drafts LCI draft by Cory booster
[03:32:29] homelands Wilds of V drain set which is
[03:32:31] not here anymore that's a lost Cavern
[03:32:33] set that will go to or a calim set or a

[03:45:13] stinks I see that WI there I'm fixing it
[03:45:15] for
[03:45:16] you I'll be right there I just needed to
[03:45:18] fix something here was just acting not
[03:45:24] right and I just removed all bunch of

[03:45:36] do YouTube wise all right here we go
[03:45:39] pogman battle going for Tony now Tony
[03:45:42] the way this goes is you get two
[03:45:44] attempts here you're going to get these
[03:45:46] packs and then what we're going to do is
[03:45:47] you go up against the boss after the
[03:45:49] boss is one of those over here and if
[03:45:51] you beat the boss what we do with our
[03:45:53] two attempts is I try to get this down
[03:45:55] here and I try to slam this to get at
[03:46:00] least my uh and put those up there to
[03:46:04] try to get seven strength here to fight
[03:46:06] the boss because that's the most
[03:46:07] strength that we can get when you go up
[03:46:09] against the
[03:46:10] boss all right so let's see what we get

[03:46:56] four you got four but that's still good
[03:46:58] strength you can beat
[03:47:00] three you can beat three of the 10

[04:05:40] like oh that's a good card oh that's a
[04:05:41] good
[04:05:42] card like those scenarios you know Soul
[04:05:46] Rings 18 yeah I know that Soul rings on
[04:05:48] its way up too if I remember it used to
[04:05:52] be even uh thought it was lower I
[04:05:53] thought it was like 10 and it used to
[04:05:55] now it's gone its way up to like as you
[04:05:56] said
[04:06:01] 18 I like that art personally that art
[04:06:03] is very
[04:06:04] nice very nice art on that they did a
[04:06:08] good job with the art in the commander
[04:06:09] Masters I will say
[04:06:12] that great job with the art in the
[04:06:14] commander Masters makas I think is like
[04:06:16] 10 also Kindred should be like what 15
[04:06:19] to 20 unless it
[04:06:23] dropped so that was a good backup pack
[04:06:26] of Commander Masters
[04:06:29] there there were no one Rings pulled out
[04:06:32] of that L of the Rings box and that is
[04:06:33] the last pack in that box literally the
[04:06:37] last pack and I have no more Lord of the
[04:06:40] Rings by the way so if somebody's been
[04:06:42] buying them I'm have to double check it
[04:06:44] to make sure I'm not I'm not out of I'm
[04:06:47] not saying that it's not saying that I'm
[04:06:48] out of them or I have more of them
[04:06:50] because I should be only having one of
[04:06:53] those left by the way I'll have to go I
[04:06:56] have to go double check my buy now to
[04:06:57] make
[04:06:58] sure got nice nice little hit on that
[04:07:04] one oh doc are you going
[04:07:12] in well that oh there was one left all

[04:07:41] that's going to be the last pack for a
[04:07:42] while

[04:10:17] your packageing way and I'm going to put
[04:10:19] your name on uh stuff there and I
[04:10:21] believe Ash's alter out of that used to

[04:10:26] $10 so I'm going to put that in here
[04:10:28] just in case with your diminishing
[04:10:31] returns and there you go nice one
[04:10:35] there let me put that all together for
[04:10:37] you
[04:10:39] doc thank you very much for jumping in
[04:10:41] and hanging out we always appre
[04:10:43] appreciate it and now what do you think
[04:10:44] we should be doing with our list you
[04:10:46] saying we should be adding some more
[04:10:48] stuff to it
[04:10:55] DOC because adding cards all right like
[04:10:58] I know some people uh like I know a lot
[04:11:01] of people don't necessarily like the
[04:11:03] ring but uh is there is there a specific
[04:11:06] card that you think we need to be adding
[04:11:08] because I I
[04:11:09] don't I like the idea of the list
[04:11:14] uh but I feel like there are some cards
[04:11:17] that needed that like like some older
[04:11:19] ones that we could add to
[04:11:22] them oh you don't want cards off the
[04:11:24] list you want to add them to it all
[04:11:26] right so you want to add some list cards
[04:11:28] so they're printed in those and like the
[04:11:29] mystery list stuff monoc cryp you want
[04:11:32] more of those all right different monoc
[04:11:33] crys because we have that we already
[04:11:35] have one of the monoc crypts in the list
[04:11:37] so we can put a different one in there
[04:11:38] that would be
[04:11:42] nice so let's see here let's throw out
[04:11:45] another uh let's see what we got going
[04:11:46] on here I'll throw out a oh you got this
[04:11:50] here my friend I forgot to put that in
[04:11:51] there for you you got our gby thank you
[04:11:55] doc do appreciate it and I'll throw up
[04:11:57] another one here for a few and we'll uh
[04:12:00] keep going for a little
[04:12:02] way
[04:12:03] oh oh I get what you're saying you want
[04:12:06] it off the reserve list that would make
[04:12:08] sense yeah I think it should be printed
[04:12:11] more I do agree
[04:12:14] I do agree I think we could P put pull
[04:12:17] that off the reserve list because I feel
[04:12:19] like that's one of those ones where you
[04:12:20] it could be like you don't need a an
[04:12:22] $800 card that doesn't need to be $800
[04:12:24] for everyone why do you need it why does
[04:12:26] that need to be $800 if somebody wants
[04:12:27] to have that card or like 70 or 90 we
[04:12:30] getting down a little bit reasonable
[04:12:31] range you can have that other one that's
[04:12:33] $800 that's fine you can have the one
[04:12:35] that high one but give us some ones that
[04:12:36] are reasonable that's all we want
[04:12:40] right I'm going to do this here and
[04:12:42] going to put this up and we're gonna
[04:12:43] call we're g to do our POG
[04:12:46] flip that's what we'll do right
[04:12:49] now and we're going to throw that one up
[04:12:51] for our
[04:12:55] pogman we're going to do this with our
[04:13:01] pogman there you go that's going to go
[04:13:04] here here and
[04:13:08] there yeah that would be kind of fun
[04:13:10] like the band cards like you can't use
[04:13:12] them
[04:13:13] but um like like they're not allowed
[04:13:16] unless in like certain type of game but
[04:13:18] you still can get them that would be
[04:13:20] kind of
[04:13:21] nice like um like when they did the 30th
[04:13:23] Anniversary thing and they did the um
[04:13:26] like the Lotus that type of thing not
[04:13:28] the Lotus I'm saying but like you know
[04:13:29] cards that are cool that are banned that
[04:13:31] you can't get but are nice to have not
[04:13:33] wear is like in this one here and with
[04:13:36] this we do two slams this is my wife's
[04:13:39] idea of a game by the way not wear all
[04:13:41] right so we do two slams
[04:13:43] on this and your packs are going to go
[04:13:46] right there we're going to move this
[04:13:47] right over here and going put those
[04:13:50] right there and you get two we do two
[04:13:52] slam attempts to get seven strength to
[04:13:54] beat the boss all
[04:13:57] right yeah exactly there's lots of band
[04:13:59] ones you could use in
[04:14:01] Commander all right so what we do here
[04:14:03] is I'm going to slam these down we're
[04:14:05] going to see if I can get up to seven
[04:14:07] strength because that's the highest we
[04:14:08] can get to get up to the boss all right
[04:14:10] we got this notw all right let's make it
[04:14:13] make sure it's a good even stack here we
[04:14:14] need to make sure it's a good even stack

[04:23:33] this gets you one two three strength to
[04:23:35] start your adventure on your Wasteland
[04:23:38] now what you
[04:23:39] do is there are three different
[04:23:42] different boxes that you pick from one
[04:23:44] two and three you pick one of each and
[04:23:45] you get plus one or minus one on your
[04:23:47] strength for your character then you
[04:23:49] fight the boss at the end just like we
[04:23:50] do with our pogman but the only
[04:23:53] difference is is you wander through the
[04:23:54] Wasteland as a character all right and
[04:23:57] you pick one of those and then say
[04:23:59] you're going to be a detective wandering
[04:24:01] through the Wasteland type thing we have
[04:24:03] some animations that go with it to see

[05:03:38] out
[05:03:55] got to have some drinks here no one
[05:03:57] wants to do any more of the POG flip so
[05:03:59] we'll put the POG flip
[05:04:01] away and let's take out one of our other
[05:04:06] games we're going to do a pick your own
[05:04:08] battle
[05:04:10] now the way we're going to do the pick
[05:04:11] your own
[05:04:13] battle because I'm picking it it's kind
[05:04:15] of kind of be a pick your own battle
[05:04:17] it's going to be more a
[05:04:19] uh you can it's gonna I pick your battle
[05:04:22] but if you want to change up the packs
[05:04:24] in them just tell me hey I don't want
[05:04:26] those packs I want something else and
[05:04:28] you can change them up and then you in
[05:04:30] one other person because I do a short
[05:04:32] one this is what I call the quick ones
[05:04:33] we don't have long ones we don't need to
[05:04:35] do a long one but we'll do a quick one
[05:04:37] we're going to do this here all right
[05:04:40] we're going to
[05:04:43] do a
[05:04:45] Fallout as your one that you're going to
[05:04:47] break between you
[05:04:48] two then you're going to go
[05:04:57] with each of you will get an Exelon and
[05:05:02] an
[05:05:04] aoria but then you split the Fallout one
[05:05:07] there in the middle that's if you want
[05:05:10] to do the pick your
[05:05:12] own
[05:05:19] break oh that's why it's in the wrong
[05:05:26] place here we go and let's do this
[05:05:30] here now I'm going to start this here
[05:05:32] give me one minute to do this this is
[05:05:35] going to
[05:05:38] be
[05:05:45] that'll be this here for those that want
[05:05:47] to start and try
[05:05:51] it and this will end up we got one other
[05:05:53] person to jump in on this break and then
[05:05:56] you break you each
[05:05:59] get these and then what I do is I
[05:06:01] shuffle this up and then the person that
[05:06:04] was the buyer first gets to say if they
[05:06:06] want to get the first card or the second
[05:06:09] card get the choice and that's how we do
[05:06:11] the little break the pick your own break
[05:06:12] thing here if you want to try it that is
[05:06:16] if you want to try it that
[05:06:18] is pretty fun and you get yourself some
[05:06:22] Fallout with
[05:06:25] it all right I will put that back
[05:06:28] because it looks like no one wants to do
[05:06:29] a pick your own
[05:06:31] break or maybe it was just the wrong
[05:06:34] sets of
[05:06:35] cards I'm going to put them back though
[05:06:37] anyways and we'll try out a uh we'll try
[05:06:41] out something new here do a little bit
[05:06:43] of a game good good good good game good

[05:07:28] uh so I can pack up all my stuff for the
[05:07:30] day but we were still going for a little
[05:07:31] bit so I figured we'd keep on here and
[05:07:33] because the family's not really doing
[05:07:34] too much today didn't have many plans so

[05:17:48] we'll do a quick easy one we'll do the
[05:17:50] pogman battle for a quick easy
[05:17:53] one I think I'm GNA have to make an
[05:17:55] animation for our pogman that way if he
[05:17:58] wins he can beat the boss and come out
[05:17:59] on top of the win
[05:18:01] here we'll throw that one on for this
[05:18:04] for those that want it for a little
[05:18:05] pogman battle there try yourself some
[05:18:08] times spir on some
[05:18:11] mystery oh excuse me very much I'm sorry
[05:18:13] about that it's going to burp
[05:18:35] again well we shall see
[05:18:39] if anybody wants any more
[05:18:41] games let me think what else should we
[05:18:44] do I had fun doing what not the the uh
[05:18:49] wheel of magic yesterday that was
[05:18:52] actually really fun I feel like we just
[05:18:54] need more people to do it time spiral is
[05:18:56] awesome I am a big fan of time spiral we
[05:18:59] have not had any of the Retro foils
[05:19:01] pulled out yet so that's
[05:19:04] intriguing that's quite intriguing
[05:19:07] here's the last two packs out of my box
[05:19:09] of ion draft until I open the new one so
[05:19:12] I'm going to put that up there and see
[05:19:15] if anybody wants to try
[05:19:24] those sorry move myself around
[05:19:28] here why is this not doing it oh I keep
[05:19:30] forgetting I have it on a different
[05:19:37] screen oh that sucks
[05:19:40] dude I have been there before so I know
[05:19:44] exactly what you're talking about I've
[05:19:47] been there before so I know exactly what
[05:19:49] you're talking about I had I lost all my
[05:19:52] credit my credit cards because um I had
[05:19:55] all like the same password so I lost
[05:19:57] everything for a little while this is
[05:19:58] one I only had like two credit
[05:20:00] cards so but it was like really
[05:20:03] frustrating because you couldn't buy
[05:20:04] anything and I couldn't do anything and
[05:20:05] I had to use my debit card and I felt
[05:20:07] unsafe using my debit card cuz happened
[05:20:08] at a gas station here so I'm
[05:20:11] like whatever but this is going to get
[05:20:13] you three slams in our pogman battle
[05:20:17] here to see if you have enough to beat
[05:20:19] the boss at the end of this Wasteland
[05:20:22] Adventure I'm GNA open this thing
[05:20:26] up get better air
[05:20:31] flow
[05:20:34] don't you're disputing
[05:20:36] it Amazon charges for over a thousand
[05:20:40] ooh
[05:20:42] oh that's no good can you um go to
[05:20:46] Amazon and like uh cancel the
[05:20:50] orders because they had to have done it
[05:20:52] under your name right or did they not
[05:20:54] even do it under your name they did
[05:20:55] under somebody else's name and they made
[05:20:58] an account with you type thing or did
[05:21:00] they like yeah it's it's definitely an
[05:21:03] annoyance it's just so it's annoying
[05:21:04] exactly because it takes up so much of
[05:21:06] your time to do this when you could be
[05:21:09] doing other
[05:21:13] stuff we'll throw this out here and say
[05:21:16] it's three slams again TR that one more
[05:21:21] time we'll throw this up here for
[05:21:24] this if you want to try it those two
[05:21:27] three packs there I mean those three
[05:21:29] packs
[05:21:36] there how can they someone else's name
[05:21:39] in your
[05:21:40] card that's like an that's already
[05:21:43] fraudulent and should be picked up
[05:21:44] especially by
[05:21:46] Amazon that's
[05:21:48] crazy that's crazy Amazon didn't pick
[05:21:51] that
[05:21:53] up they use a completely different
[05:21:56] name in your
[05:21:58] card that's
[05:22:02] insane
[05:22:07] h
[05:22:11] like I figured they would have tried to
[05:22:12] make a fake account with your name that
[05:22:15] way it would have been like accurate to
[05:22:16] use your
[05:22:20] information I guess that's a no on that
[05:22:22] one we're going to put this out here
[05:22:25] we're going to put this Commander
[05:22:26] Masters out and I'm going to call that
[05:22:29] two we're just going to call that two
[05:22:37] anyways
[05:22:40] yo
[05:22:42] wow all right so your card shut them
[05:22:45] down but you still need to have a
[05:22:47] problem disputing it that seems
[05:22:48] ridiculous too the card literally shut
[05:22:51] him down because they were doing
[05:22:52] something wrong they knew it was wrong
[05:22:54] and they're having a hard time giving
[05:22:55] you money oh wow yeah it is good that
[05:22:58] they shut it down definitely good they
[05:22:59] shut it down true true I've been there
[05:23:04] before oh I hate that crap I feel so bad
[05:23:07] for you I've dealt with it
[05:23:11] possibly four
[05:23:13] times it's the damn [ __ ] skimmers
[05:23:16] that they put on [ __ ] and like uh
[05:23:18] they've getting better and better with
[05:23:19] some of that
[05:23:20] technology and like I give my card to my
[05:23:23] wife like go go pay for this and she

[05:24:01] for this there for anyone that wants it
[05:24:04] for those two
[05:24:07] packs
[05:24:10] yeah they were ridiculous which with
[05:24:13] this stuff I hate I hated it it was such
[05:24:16] a pain in the butt it made life so much
[05:24:18] of a headache like you know it was
[05:24:22] stolen so why are you arguing with me
[05:24:25] why are you not giving me my money back
[05:24:27] you know that type of
[05:24:29] thing H you wish you had your
[05:24:32] card oh the uh fallout and ixon I threw
[05:24:35] out
[05:24:37] there well no one's been going the fall
[05:24:39] because sadly I I couldn't get it at a
[05:24:41] great price so I I can't I didn't have a
[05:24:44] great price for it but um I have a price
[05:24:47] for it is really what it boils down
[05:24:53] to but it's better than nothing which is
[05:24:56] really what it's been coming out to
[05:24:58] recently is
[05:25:00] nothing we're going to do
[05:25:03] that and we're going to put that up
[05:25:07] with
[05:25:10] this
[05:25:11] here we're g to do this
[05:25:20] here oh it's not in
[05:25:23] here oh they're not in
[05:25:26] there I thought it
[05:25:28] was hold
[05:25:34] on put this in
[05:25:37] here
[05:25:42] all
[05:25:59] right okay let's do
[05:26:07] that
[05:26:10] no that's not what I wanted I
[05:26:16] wanted there we go that's what I
[05:26:21] wanted go there do five red buttons oh
[05:26:27] there supposed to be plus five red
[05:26:28] buttons hold on that's supposed to be
[05:26:30] five red buttons I the five didn't save
[05:26:31] there you get your packs and the five
[05:26:33] red buttons sorry give me one second
[05:26:35] don't bid on that I'll correct it or if
[05:26:37] you do want to bid on it just know that
[05:26:38] it's supposed to be for five and I will
[05:26:40] give you
[05:26:49] five but there we go I throw that pack
[05:26:52] out there people were liking the red
[05:26:53] button earlier so I figure I put it out
[05:26:54] there for an
[05:26:59] option five red
[05:27:04] buttons here we go there we go let's do
[05:27:07] that
[05:27:08] pack plus five red
[05:27:10] buttons now that it's on there correct
[05:27:12] I'm going to run it there there we go
[05:27:14] that's correct that's what you should be
[05:27:15] looking for
[05:27:22] there I gotta stand
[05:27:24] up been sitting down for so
[05:27:37] long
[05:27:43] hey
[05:27:45] Mike G that Matt thanks for coming in I
[05:27:48] was just standing up for a minute I've
[05:27:49] been sitting down for so
[05:27:51] long the red
[05:27:53] buttons are these over
[05:27:56] here these uh two rows here all right
[05:27:59] and I'll pin what the red button is
[05:28:02] specifically so that you can see it but
[05:28:05] the red button specifically is this
[05:28:08] here all right you have multiple I'll
[05:28:12] sit back down now you have multiple
[05:28:15] draft boosters collector boosters set
[05:28:18] boosters in there uh and then you also
[05:28:22] the big hit is one of them have Lord of
[05:28:26] the Rings collector booster written on
[05:28:28] it 1,600 cards are in
[05:28:30] there um there's like probably about
[05:28:37] 40
[05:28:38] actually probably about 50 cards that
[05:28:40] were in there and I because I added some
[05:28:43] there about 50 cards with packs of in
[05:28:45] there and then there's a one with the
[05:28:47] Lord of the Rings there have been some
[05:28:48] of the packs pulled out so I don't know
[05:28:50] how many have been pulled out of there
[05:28:51] but not 50 so that's how that's what the
[05:28:54] game is that's what the red button is
[05:28:56] people wanted some ridiculously big hit
[05:28:58] chance which is why uh I put it out
[05:29:01] there I'm not a big fan of
[05:29:04] it but some people like to push the uh
[05:29:06] push that gamble ass of things that I'm
[05:29:08] not a fan
[05:29:09] of so I did it I threw one of up that's
[05:29:12] the one thing that is anything close to
[05:29:15] gambling that I would say I have
[05:29:17] everything else just you pay you buy
[05:29:19] this and then you get something extra if
[05:29:21] that makes any sense which is why even
[05:29:23] with the red button I'm trying to do as
[05:29:24] you buy your packs and then you get
[05:29:25] something extra with it like you know
[05:29:27] I'm not that was the whole point of
[05:29:29] doing that I wasn't expecting people to
[05:29:30] just go and buy the red button you know
[05:29:32] what I mean but people keep asking for
[05:29:35] it like today I had somebody do this
[05:29:37] they were like give me a bunch of red
[05:29:38] button so I was like
[05:29:40] here and I threw out this for them and
[05:29:42] they bought them because they wanted
[05:29:44] them not my thing but that's what they
[05:29:46] wanted to do yeah no problem I don't
[05:29:48] mind explaining things whenever you guys
[05:29:49] have a question don't hesitate to
[05:29:53] ask I'm going to switch these packs out
[05:29:56] though and I'm going to put these over
[05:29:59] here and I'm going to put out
[05:30:02] this
[05:30:03] [Music]
[05:30:06] with

[05:41:57] chilling seeing what else we got going
[05:41:59] on here doing our games now the fun
[05:42:01] thing is when we do our games we do a
[05:42:02] lot of fun stuff playing our games
[05:42:04] sometimes we do it's up to you so
[05:42:07] sometimes you like the games I like a
[05:42:08] bunch of different ones that's why we do
[05:42:09] this I thought it was fun to play games
[05:42:11] my kids thought it was fun and this was
[05:42:13] the whole reason we started it was to
[05:42:14] play stuff with the kids and get them
[05:42:15] involved and now they're off getting
[05:42:17] shoes while I'm involved doing this
[05:42:18] myself and I've been doing it most of
[05:42:20] the day because they've been uh doing
[05:42:22] some other stuff practicing some soccer
[05:42:24] doing some uh doing some other things
[05:42:26] like that they're both actually going to

[05:43:50] I don't want those
[05:43:56] ones it's not yet that is at least not
[05:43:59] yet that
[05:44:01] is those ones with
[05:44:04] those all right here we go we're going
[05:44:06] to pull one of these forward we're going
[05:44:08] to zoom
[05:44:10] in and this is what we're going to do
[05:44:13] I'm going to put these out here for a
[05:44:16] dollar now this is how we do our game
[05:44:20] sadly I haven't been able to figure out
[05:44:21] a way of doing it any better
[05:44:23] but this is how I do it it's it
[05:44:26] works it's not really I'd rather have it
[05:44:29] so we could set find some way of doing
[05:44:30] prices wise but I don't trust that
[05:44:32] people aren't going to go and look them
[05:44:34] up and that's what the problem is I
[05:44:37] would hope that I could but we'll
[05:44:39] see so what we're going to do here is we
[05:44:41] have three cards you're going to get one
[05:44:43] of these three whichever one you want
[05:44:45] they all are on for a dollar here ezam
[05:44:48] agency Chief agency
[05:44:51] Chief steel serif foil and
[05:44:55] a rhythm of the Wilds I'm just going to
[05:44:58] put all the these this right here now
[05:45:01] these are all you can get either of
[05:45:02] these for a
[05:45:04] dollar and what we're going to do here
[05:45:06] oh no
[05:45:10] somebody's already going to know it's on
[05:45:12] one of those because it fell
[05:45:14] over that's not fair for me but you know
[05:45:17] what we'll start it out with being fair
[05:45:18] for
[05:45:20] you all right we're going to zoom in
[05:45:22] here so you can see
[05:45:25] better there you go now what we have
[05:45:31] is those three cards you get to choose
[05:45:35] from
[05:45:38] they're going to go on for a
[05:45:41] dollar now you pick one of those for a
[05:45:43] dollar and then you decide whether it's
[05:45:45] going to be high or low on the back of
[05:45:46] these written on the back of them
[05:45:48] depending on how many you get right we
[05:45:50] roll the dice and that's the high that
[05:45:51] we get to go up against the boss for the
[05:45:53] dice if you beat the boss with the
[05:45:56] strength then we do a $1 Loot drop for
[05:45:59] our wastelanders and even any time you
[05:46:01] play this you always get one of the
[05:46:03] Vault packs in the back there saying
[05:46:05] thank you for playing so with that being
[05:46:07] said I'm going to commence and see if
[05:46:09] you guys like the little game we're
[05:46:11] doing for our
[05:46:12] singles starting out at one dollar if
[05:46:16] you want any of these that is you have
[05:46:19] seal serif Rhythm of the wilds and an
[05:46:21] Ezra agency
[05:46:23] Chief Jeremy John likes one of these at
[05:46:32] least pretty good on uh not bad this I'm
[05:46:35] steel s or as
[05:46:38] which one is it I'm getting I'm guessing
[05:46:40] it's going to be steel
[05:46:42] serif is what you
[05:46:45] want yes all right steel serif now do
[05:46:49] you think it says high or low on
[05:46:57] it low we have
[05:47:01] high all right so that one is not
[05:47:06] correct
[05:47:07] so You' have you only are going to have
[05:47:09] one because of what you bought but we'll
[05:47:11] see if you can get extras all
[05:47:14] right high or low low
[05:47:20] low
[05:47:22] and on the next one so you got that one
[05:47:25] there you got one got one
[05:47:29] now low and high all right you got one
[05:47:34] roll one roll that's okay you get your
[05:47:37] steel

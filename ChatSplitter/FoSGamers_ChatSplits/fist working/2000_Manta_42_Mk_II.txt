### Manta 42 Mk II Catamaran Overview

The 2000 Manta 42 Mk II is a well-regarded catamaran designed for bluewater sailing and liveaboard cruising. Known for its robust build and practical design, it has garnered positive feedback from both owners and reviewers.

#### Design and Features
- **Dimensions**: The catamaran is 42 feet long with a beam of 21 feet and a draft of approximately 3.67 feet. This makes it relatively shallow, allowing for easier access to coastal areas and shallow bays.
- **Engines**: Equipped with twin 30hp Volvo Penta diesel engines, the Manta 42 offers reliable propulsion. Each engine is placed under the berths in the aft cabins, providing easy access for maintenance.
- **Fuel and Water Capacity**: The vessel holds 125 gallons of fuel and 100 gallons of freshwater, ensuring extended range and self-sufficiency during long passages.

#### Exterior and Deck
- **Construction**: The hull and deck are constructed with high-quality fiberglass, reinforced with aluminum crossbeams at the bow to handle twisting forces. The hull-to-deck joint is sealed with marine-grade sealants and additional laminate for extra strength.
- **Cockpit**: The cockpit features comfortable seating, including a custom rear sling bench and closed-cell foam cushions. It also has a full helm station where most sail controls are accessible, making single-handed sailing feasible.

#### Interior
- **Living Space**: The Manta 42 is designed with spacious living quarters between the two hulls. The main saloon offers ample seating and a functional galley.
- **Headroom**: One notable drawback is the limited headroom, particularly uncomfortable for individuals taller than 6 feet.

#### Sailing Performance
- **Rigging and Sails**: The boat includes a main sail with two reefs, a self-tacking jib, and an asymmetrical spinnaker. An electric winch in the cockpit aids in sail handling, and the rigging was recently replaced in 2018.
- **Maneuverability**: The twin engines provide excellent maneuverability, especially useful in tight marina spaces. The vessel can pivot by running one engine forward and the other in reverse.

#### Owner Reviews
Owners of the Manta 42 Mk II appreciate its spacious layout, ease of handling, and the quality of construction. However, some drawbacks include outdated equipment and the difficulty in sourcing replacement parts due to the cessation of its production.

### Pros and Cons

#### Pros
- **Spacious and Comfortable**: Ample living space and well-designed cockpit make it ideal for long-term cruising.
- **Easy Handling**: Accessible sail controls and twin engines enhance maneuverability.

### Summary
The 2000 Manta 42 Mk II catamaran is a solid choice for those seeking a capable and comfortable cruising vessel. Its robust construction, spacious layout, and ease of handling make it a favorite among liveaboard sailors. However, potential buyers should consider the limitations related to headroom, aging equipment, and visibility from the saloon.

### Manta Catamarans Company Overview

#### Company History and Reputation

Manta Enterprises, the company behind Manta catamarans, established a strong reputation for producing high-quality bluewater cruising catamarans. The company started producing catamarans in 1993 with the Manta 38, under a contract with Endeavour Yachts in Largo, Florida. Due to the success of their initial models, Manta Enterprises opened their own production yard in Sarasota, Florida, in 2001. They produced several popular models, including the Manta 40, Manta 42, and eventually a 44-foot power catamaran introduced in 2007【30†source】【31†source】.

The Manta 42 Mk II, one of their most successful models, gained popularity for its robust construction, practical design, and suitability for long-term cruising and liveaboard lifestyles. Between 1994 and 2009, approximately 127 Manta catamarans were built【31†source】.

#### Challenges and Production Halt

The production of Manta catamarans ceased in 2008, primarily due to the health issues of the company's ownership and the financial downturn caused by the Great Recession. This halt in production has made Manta catamarans a sought-after commodity in the used boat market, often referred to as "cult catamarans" due to their dedicated following【31†source】.

#### Current Status

As of now, Manta Enterprises is no longer actively producing new catamarans, and there are no public records of the company filing for bankruptcy. The cessation of production was more due to personal and economic reasons rather than a formal bankruptcy【31†source】【32†source】.

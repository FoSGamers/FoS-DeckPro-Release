[00:25:31] we are fully moved now that is
[00:25:35] correct the house someone else is living
[00:25:38] in the house my understanding from our
[00:25:40] neighbors they said it's an
[00:25:41] exceptionally old couple which makes
[00:25:43] sense because it's in kind of a
[00:25:44] retirement community not really full
[00:25:46] like a retirement community it's all
[00:25:47] older people that retired because
[00:25:49] everybody that could buy something near
[00:25:50] there it's like they have to have some
[00:25:51] type of money and most of them are older
[00:25:53] because they had to built their money up
[00:25:54] over the years to be able to retire so
[00:25:56] they're like you know they're retired
[00:25:59] everybody
[00:26:00] around that was there and that bought
[00:26:03] their house like right starting out or
[00:26:06] something one two three six seven eight

[01:20:41] twice okay one two three four five six
[01:20:45] seven eight nine all we G to
[01:20:49] add I add a couple of those the reason
[01:20:52] why is because you're going to get

[01:21:17] person we'll see what the next person
[01:21:18] gets one two three four five six seven
[01:21:22] eight that's because the last person Tim
[01:21:25] did not give me um a number that I saw

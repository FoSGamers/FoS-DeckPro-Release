[00:13:46] name it will it will not show if I'm
[00:13:49] glitching I have to actually have a
[00:13:51] separate name which is ridiculous so
[00:13:53] what not if you're listening please
[00:13:55] allow it so that I can use my actual
[00:13:56] name and just join it through like an
[00:13:59] app so I can actually see what's going
[00:14:01] on and not have to uh create a separate
[00:14:04] account to confirm that my my stream is
[00:14:08] working regularly as expected that would
[00:14:10] be very
[00:14:12] nice let's see if we can do
[00:14:16] that anybody in here hanging out us
[00:14:19] let's do some of these things for you

[00:15:34] some of the singles here for those that
[00:15:36] asked but I don't think anybody's GNA St
[00:15:38] stay in here because I think today I'm
[00:15:40] actually gonna end up probably dropping
[00:15:41] off early because I'm guessing it's not
[00:15:43] going to work well with everybody else
[00:15:45] that's streaming and I'm betting they're
[00:15:47] all doing giveaways the entire time to
[00:15:49] entice people to stay to their
[00:15:51] shows and I just instead of doing
[00:15:53] giveaways I give everybody a good price
[00:15:55] which is always funny to me you know
[00:15:58] that Mak
[00:15:59] sense when people go to a show to like
[00:16:02] oh look I'm going to buy something from
[00:16:04] this place at an inflated price because
[00:16:07] they're doing a giveaway and I might
[00:16:08] have the chance of getting one or I
[00:16:10] could go to this person and buy it at a
[00:16:13] good price that's better price and I
[00:16:16] don't have to deal with craziness and
[00:16:19] yeah there's not necess a giveaway but
[00:16:22] the price is generally going to be
[00:16:23] better than I'm going to get somewhere
[00:16:24] else or we're going to have a better
[00:16:27] time want the other I'm not going to
[00:16:30] keep razing you come on come on come on
[00:16:33] bye bye
[00:16:35] bye but I just do this here for a little
[00:16:37] while looks like I'll be doing it by
[00:16:39] myself which is
[00:16:42] fine then when I'm done with this I will
[00:16:47] [Music]
[00:16:50] uh just do

[00:16:59] together a few artist all got kind of a
[00:17:01] similar feel St with the rolling
[00:17:06] [Music]

[00:17:15] fishing day I might actually be cut
[00:17:17] catching uh cutting out of here

[00:17:22] little while might be I'm on early

[00:21:00] and stuff which is perfectly fine I
[00:21:01] understand that and with that going on
[00:21:03] I'll just I'll probably end up going out
[00:21:05] fishing I think later this afternoon
[00:21:06] before the Super
[00:21:10] Bowl yeah good day with the family

[00:30:34] there go take care of the rest of your
[00:30:36] chores before you start asking to do
[00:30:38] things you're not allowed to yet oh they
[00:30:40] think they're Sly it's like dude you
[00:30:43] know I was 10 at one point right I also
[00:30:45] means I have also another like 30 years
[00:30:48] on you so don't try to pull that slide
[00:30:50] stuff I've been there also with 30 plus
[00:30:53] years just throwing that out there they
[00:30:56] think they can get away with it every
[00:30:57] time and I give them that tip I'm like

[00:31:01] age I know what happened all right let
[00:31:03] me put some pack deals up from Nolan
[00:31:05] since will is being a bad boy and trying
[00:31:07] to be sneaky we're gonna do a Nolan pack

[00:31:13] correctly this morning when he gets
[00:31:15] up so here we go we're g to put this on
[00:31:20] and remember everybody there are pack
[00:31:22] deals on today these uh these pack deals

[00:31:27] discount like I always do and that is
[00:31:29] because we have 10% off already but I am
[00:31:32] able to do a little bit of a discount on
[00:31:33] everything like I normally do just not a
[00:31:35] giant one because uh the fees that are
[00:31:37] taken into account are now discounted

[00:36:21] these singles we can put them off the
[00:36:22] side you name on
[00:36:25] them
[00:36:27] that's when you were that was when I was
[00:36:30] born buddy I
[00:36:32] 1994 1994 I would have been 10 that is
[00:36:36] correct that is correct we also have a
[00:36:38] sunken Citadel I'm adding in there we
[00:36:42] go I will turn 40 this year that is
[00:36:46] correct it
[00:36:54] is because like you
[00:36:58] 20 yep I have a little bag I actually
[00:37:01] have dup troop and I I actually I'm GNA
[00:37:03] probably end up putting this back
[00:37:04] because mutant Raptor has not been back
[00:37:05] I try to hold it for a few days and it's
[00:37:08] been about three to five days when he
[00:37:09] asked for this one so I'm GNA probably
[00:37:11] end up putting that back but I hold them
[00:37:13] for a few days if people ask I don't
[00:37:14] mind doing that it's because you know I
[00:37:17] know they're singles people sometimes
[00:37:18] are looking for them and take some time
[00:37:19] to either find what they want or if
[00:37:21] maybe they're you know whatever I'm good
[00:37:23] with
[00:37:25] it
[00:37:29] do that put that back
[00:37:31] here no one wanted no one's pack deal so
[00:37:34] we're gonna put that
[00:37:35] back and let's do
[00:37:42] this we'll put a pack deal from William
[00:37:47] up this is a William pack deal we're
[00:37:49] just going to start right at the front
[00:37:50] no he did another oldie oldies I guess
[00:37:53] doing oldies right now we're going to
[00:37:54] skip over the oldies one actually we're
[00:37:56] going to do we're going to skip over the
[00:37:58] oldies one at the
[00:37:59] moment that's a good one we like this
[00:38:01] one we just did this
[00:38:05] one we just did that one we're going
[00:38:07] from the back then we're gonna do this
[00:38:10] one from the
[00:38:17] back and remember guys every single one
[00:38:20] in the um everything that you buy right
[00:38:23] now if you use anything from sale to all
[00:38:26] the up to sale 20 potentially even sale
[00:38:29] 350 you're done all right ask Mom if
[00:38:32] there's anything that you want she wants
[00:38:34] you to
[00:38:36] do and put the three packs on screen up
[00:38:39] here and they're going to go up for this
[00:38:48] year all right try a luck if you want
[00:38:51] any of it we may end up heading out
[00:38:53] early because I think there's so many
[00:38:54] people on that I might not even have a
[00:38:56] lot of there might not be anything going
[00:38:57] on today and that I mean not that
[00:39:00] there's nothing going on it's just like
[00:39:01] there's so many people that it's
[00:39:02] everybody spreads out you know what I
[00:39:03] mean like normally I'm one of like a few
[00:39:05] people on but there's like a dozen
[00:39:07] people on today because of the sale
[00:39:08] stuff doing and they're doing like
[00:39:09] 24hour super sale blah blah blah blah
[00:39:11] blah stuff and I'm just doing my normal
[00:39:13] thing plus discount which because I
[00:39:16] don't I don't chalk my prices up in the
[00:39:18] first place
[00:39:20] and yeah and I don't like I don't run
[00:39:23] like a a box that like know this box is
[00:39:25] the first time I've ever anything like
[00:39:27] this people run things like this all the
[00:39:28] time and make thousands of dollars and
[00:39:31] they don't stack them with packs like I
[00:39:32] do like they'll just put like a few
[00:39:34] cards in there and then have one top
[00:39:36] card and people go after that crap all
[00:39:38] day long because they want the one top
[00:39:40] card that's in there and they'll spend
[00:39:42] thousands on that and that's why they're
[00:39:43] able to do all the giveaways they do and
[00:39:45] I don't do that that way I I like try to
[00:39:47] make it so everybody gets like a deal
[00:39:48] the entire time and they don't get
[00:39:49] screwed in some way like I hate when
[00:39:51] people come out and they come out with
[00:39:52] like I don't even like doing this that
[00:39:54] much because they can come out with like
[00:39:55] they can spend a and come out with like
[00:39:57] a card that's worth 10 cents that's why
[00:39:58] I don't even like doing this much but
[00:39:59] they people wanted it and I was like
[00:40:01] [ __ ] it why not I'll throw it out there
[00:40:03] but I feel better though because I throw
[00:40:04] packs in there to help so like like not
[00:40:07] unlike the other ones like a lot of them
[00:40:08] like they don't have that you just buy
[00:40:09] it and good luck don't sh with your
[00:40:12] brother but anyways
[00:40:15] sorry what yeah uh sale two through sale
[00:40:18] 20 for the discount sale two through
[00:40:20] sale 20 for the discount that is correct
[00:40:22] myelle let me uh you actually let me do
[00:40:25] this
[00:40:29] well yeah I was talking to my wife I
[00:40:30] wasn't even talking to you guys but
[00:40:31] thank you I appreciate that myel it's
[00:40:33] not that they're crappy they have their
[00:40:35] own thing that they do and their Schmick
[00:40:36] they do some people like hanging out in
[00:40:38] them trying to get giveaways but when
[00:40:40] there's like two 300 people I know my
[00:40:42] luck personally I'm never going to have
[00:40:45] the luck to get a giveaway but I know
[00:40:47] for me um I'd rather just go somewhere
[00:40:50] and I'd rather actually I'm going to go
[00:40:52] somewhere I want to spend my money I'd
[00:40:54] go somewhere where I spend my money and
[00:40:55] I get value for my money versus going
[00:40:57] somewhere where I'm going to pay an
[00:40:58] inflated price and maybe win something
[00:41:01] if that makes any sense I don't know
[00:41:03] that's kind of
[00:41:05] weird yeah yeah exactly
[00:41:15] I let's see what
[00:41:19] happens that's awesome let's get our
[00:41:22] luck with this book here we like the Big
[00:41:24] Blue
[00:41:25] Book
[00:41:27] now the Big Blue Book for you guys that
[00:41:28] have not seen it before I going to go
[00:41:30] over it quickly so that you are all
[00:41:33] aware this is what happens with the big
[00:41:35] glue book there are 81 spots Voltron how
[00:41:39] many times would you like me to um to
[00:41:42] shuffle the wheel now what happens is
[00:41:43] the ceiling is a Balin T in here of
[00:41:46] those floors actually I did not rebuild
[00:41:48] the Box because I was like the idea of
[00:41:50] giving packs away today so there are 19
[00:41:53] floors but there are actually six of
[00:41:54] them have been hit so you kind of see
[00:41:57] here you either are going to get packs
[00:41:58] if you got something below $4 I mean $5
[00:42:01] multiple packs below $10 single pack or
[00:42:04] you get yourself like a card like a
[00:42:05] force negation that's worthwhile or
[00:42:07] maybe a pack negation so what we're
[00:42:09] going to do is we're gonna Shuffle that
[00:42:11] wheel pull that wheel out into
[00:42:14] view we're going to shuffle that wheel
[00:42:17] eight times one two 3 four five six
[00:42:22] seven and eight then we're going to run
[00:42:24] that
[00:42:25] spinner
[00:42:26] we're going to see what it lands
[00:42:28] on
[00:42:30] 79 all right we're going to put the
[00:42:32] spinner up in the
[00:42:34] corner put that spinner up in the corner
[00:42:36] so we can still see the number there we
[00:42:38] go and let's see let's get to number 79
[00:42:42] here that's going to be on that last
[00:42:44] page it's going to definitely be on the
[00:42:46] last page there number 79 all right you
[00:42:49] got yourself a Yasmine Khan now whether
[00:42:52] it being a card that is that's not bad
[00:42:54] nice Yasmine Khan surge foil
[00:42:56] doctor now with that being a under a $5
[00:43:01] an undercard you actually get some pack
[00:43:04] choices right now all right my
[00:43:07] buddy and that's how we do it here you
[00:43:09] get your card plus you get pack choices
[00:43:13] if it happens to be one that's not of
[00:43:15] high value where you're hitting your
[00:43:17] spot there so you get a choice of where
[00:43:20] is
[00:43:24] it oh maybe I'm out of them oh I must be
[00:43:28] out of those ones all right so I guess
[00:43:30] it's one of these four uh two of these
[00:43:33] any two of these
[00:43:34] four
[00:43:37] any one of
[00:43:41] these plus any one of
[00:43:46] these or you could do a Forgotten Realms
[00:43:50] collector booster it is up to you what
[00:43:52] you would like to go with since you hit
[00:43:55] the car that is at uh $5 less there
[00:43:58] that's what you like to do here like I
[00:44:00] said if you got you're going to get
[00:44:01] you're either going to get a deal where
[00:44:02] you're going to get a card you want or a
[00:44:04] card you need or card worth value or
[00:44:09] maybe you don't get a card you want but

[01:41:17] raise the price of stuff to do discount
[01:41:20] codes and I don't feel I don't feel
[01:41:21] comfortable raising the price so I can

[01:44:36] here today uh for a little while before
[01:44:39] we get out and we go uh
[01:44:43] fishing we're going to put these three
[01:44:44] packs
[01:44:46] on all
[01:44:49] right
[01:44:51] these three packs are going to go on for
[01:44:54] this if you want
[01:44:56] them now that's going to is 25% off I
[01:44:59] mean a 10% off also if you use sale
[01:45:05] to I'm kind of 10% off $2 off I had I
[01:45:08] couldn't do a 10% off sale I wish they
[01:45:11] would just allow me to do 10% off
[01:45:14] anything that was over a certain amount
[01:45:16] and it wasn't letting me do
[01:45:19] that
[01:45:29] save
[01:45:31] 10 P maybe save 10 P we'll do it oh I
[01:45:35] forgot new I wonder if I can do
[01:45:45] that
[01:45:47] maximum discount amount
[01:45:54] minimum purchase
[01:46:04] amount oh
[01:46:08] oh I wonder if I can do
[01:46:11] that ah I was an idiot I could have just
[01:46:13] done
[01:46:19] something ready
[01:46:21] I found this try
[01:46:27] this yeah let's do
[01:46:42] this there we
[01:46:44] go I think that just gives me 10% off I
[01:46:47] was being an idiot
[01:46:49] today
[01:46:54] there we
[01:46:55] go that's just going to give you 10% off
[01:46:58] when you order anything that is $15 or

[01:47:03] have just done
[01:47:05] that I wasn't even paying attention that
[01:47:07] that was an option because the option
[01:47:09] that popped up was only that and I guess
[01:47:12] you can go up to the discount will be as
[01:47:14] high as a $100 so I guess if you buy
[01:47:16] $1,000 worth of stuff you can get $100
[01:47:19] off
[01:47:21] there we go I fixed it I was smarter

[01:52:03] favorite thing they have done here plop
[01:52:05] and anybody that's watching this stream
[01:52:07] is take the cards that are the token
[01:52:10] cards and do this and put the art cards
[01:52:13] on the back it makes them so much more
[01:52:16] worthwhile when it comes to the art and
[01:52:18] the token cards like I feel like these
[01:52:20] are going to be worth a lot of money at
[01:52:21] some point if they don't do them

[02:00:26] know but I'll put those back because no
[02:00:28] one wanted
[02:00:30] that
[02:00:34] so all right you got people asking for
[02:00:36] some singles again I will go through
[02:00:39] some of the singles that I've been going
[02:00:41] through before here and then once I get
[02:00:42] in get through all of them we'll uh
[02:00:44] we'll see from there let's do a
[02:00:48] um P pull box say though well I have
[02:00:51] singles
[02:00:52] running let's do that big blue book
[02:00:55] maybe you're G to pull out a collector
[02:00:56] booster of murder the Carla Manor who
[02:00:59] knows hey be shy
[02:01:03] ready I'm butchering that one I am sorry
[02:01:07] buddy I tried I realized I completely
[02:01:09] butchered
[02:01:11] that
[02:01:13] Bashi
[02:01:17] netti Bashi n
[02:01:20] anything no anywhere near it at all
[02:01:23] potentially no all right we're going to
[02:01:25] throw this on here though and I'm going
[02:01:27] to go through some singles for you and
[02:01:29] if you want these singles let us
[02:01:31] know now remember the prices on these do
[02:01:34] fluctuate so I think dely is now like
[02:01:36] $12 or $15 instead of 19 all you got to
[02:01:40] do is let us know if you want them we
[02:01:41] put them onto the side do the name on it
[02:01:43] we'll figure out what the price is um
[02:01:45] and then we'll uh put them together in a
[02:01:47] deal that way you don't have to pay
[02:01:48] Shipp shipping multiple things of
[02:01:49] shipping and stuff like that I feel like
[02:01:52] uh doing it that way helps out instead
[02:01:54] of um doing one single at a time and be
[02:01:56] like yo look at this single look at this
[02:01:57] single kind of scroll through them you
[02:02:00] say hey I want that one I put it off the
[02:02:02] side at the end of the show or when you
[02:02:03] need to leave retaliate up we go from
[02:02:06] there that way you're not paying like
[02:02:09] you know $20 in shipping when you could
[02:02:12] have paid like
[02:02:13] two try to help that's
[02:02:16] all you know some people try to buy a
[02:02:18] bunch of singles if I do it this way you
[02:02:21] get a discount on
[02:02:23] all there we go put those back there
[02:02:25] since nobody said they wanted any of
[02:02:27] that remember even the singles are 10%
[02:02:29] off if you buy a trunk of them
[02:02:33] too all right here we go we're going to
[02:02:36] do another deal here actually you know
[02:02:40] what I'm gonna do something different

[02:11:12] one of these boxes uh like a month

[02:20:07] those while I uh here for you if you
[02:20:11] would
[02:20:13] like let's do this all right that's the
[02:20:15] pack theal that we got out there
[02:20:18] nyos or Shrine of Nicks I do not have
[02:20:22] either of those if you're looking for
[02:20:23] them specifically I will tell you that
[02:20:26] um I do have I can kind of go through
[02:20:28] what I have for singles if you're just
[02:20:30] kind of like wanting to peruse or I can
[02:20:33] um I can uh see if there is one
[02:20:35] specifically if you have another one
[02:20:37] that you're asking for yeah all right
[02:20:40] we'll do that here we go do what like
[02:20:43] what we normally do here for you
[02:20:46] guys put this pack deal back I'll put
[02:20:49] another one up and then we're going to
[02:20:50] go through the
[02:20:51] singles kind of uh I'll start a little
[02:20:53] bit in the middle of where they
[02:20:56] were and we'll go from there and this is
[02:20:58] the pack deal
[02:21:00] from
[02:21:03] Nolan this is a Nolan pack deal all
[02:21:09] right and with that Nolan pack deal
[02:21:11] that's up there we'll look at the
[02:21:13] singles all right and if you want that
[02:21:16] pack deal you jump on it that's actually
[02:21:18] pretty good deal there pretty good packs
[02:21:20] there get some uh dragons maybe a
[02:21:24] Mana maybe two Manas if you're really
[02:21:31] lucky remember if you sell
[02:21:34] 10p to
[02:21:36] save
[02:21:39] 10% and here I'm going to go through
[02:21:41] some of the singles here that we have
[02:21:43] and if you're interested let us know put
[02:21:45] them off the side with your name on it
[02:21:48] but tan is TI Bender over there just
[02:21:49] pulled out pack fresh got a couple of
[02:21:51] those remember the prices on these
[02:21:52] fluctuate so I had put them on when I
[02:21:54] pulled them out of the pack so if
[02:21:56] they're different now then that's
[02:21:57] because they have fluctuated they could
[02:22:00] be up they could be down generally they
[02:22:02] go down but if they go up sometimes they
[02:22:04] you know they go crazy we can take a
[02:22:06] look there but what I do is we put them
[02:22:07] out the side with your name on it then
[02:22:09] we go and check make sure the prices are
[02:22:11] accurate and we give you a deal on them
[02:22:14] that way you don't have to
[02:22:15] buy like 10 singles separately and that
[02:22:18] way you can get them um for one thing
[02:22:20] for shipping instead of have multiple P
[02:22:22] Pages
[02:22:23] shipping so here we go those are our
[02:22:25] singles that we got going through some
[02:22:26] of those supid man j50 thanks coming in
[02:22:32] you sale 10p to get 10% off everything I
[02:22:35] figured out how to do that after I set
[02:22:37] up all the other codes which is rather
[02:22:38] frustrating because I could have just
[02:22:40] set one code up but that's all right
[02:22:44] that's our pack deal right there no one
[02:22:47] wanted it from Nolan there I'm going to
[02:22:49] put that back and we're going to do this
[02:22:57] then we're g do that then while I go
[02:23:00] through some more of the singles
[02:23:09] here if you want any of
[02:23:12] them just like I said say which one you
[02:23:15] want we put it off the side with your
[02:23:16] name on on it we can double check the
[02:23:19] price or if you need a bounce right away
[02:23:20] we can just sell we can just put it on
[02:23:22] there quickly and do whatever you
[02:23:25] need a lot of these are surge foils or
[02:23:28] like extended art or Retros I don't have
[02:23:30] a lot of like the regular cards it's
[02:23:32] always like the extended art type things
[02:23:33] or the Retros because I open a lot of um
[02:23:35] or animes so I open a lot of collector
[02:23:37] boosters more than I open anything else
[02:23:39] and I don't really I haven't bought any
[02:23:41] sets from anyone yet so this is all kind
[02:23:43] of open from us that way I know they're
[02:23:45] all like pack fresh in there
[02:23:51] too so we'll see maybe there's something
[02:23:53] you want there maybe there
[02:24:03] isn't do
[02:24:14] this turn that there there we go here's
[02:24:18] some more of the singles we'll pull out
[02:24:19] to show
[02:24:21] you but I'm going to put another little

[02:25:29] and I can kind of go into that price
[02:25:30] range because I have them all organized

[02:25:35] Price uh for those that were have known
[02:25:38] me and been around for a while they've
[02:25:40] starting to get a little disorganized
[02:25:41] with people asking different kinds of
[02:25:42] questions and be pulling out some
[02:25:44] special ones for them and then not
[02:25:45] getting them all back in the right order
[02:25:46] order but sometimes these are the three

[02:26:10] off there you go for
[02:26:14] those let me do this
[02:26:19] put that

[02:26:49] Tyrant like I
[02:26:51] said come out of the pack
[02:26:56] fresh let's see what that Mark is
[02:26:59] there I think it's just a piece of
[02:27:01] something in the thing here but let's
[02:27:03] double check for
[02:27:12] you it
[02:27:15] is another the bot of the card has a
[02:27:17] little Mark on it there so it's not
[02:27:20] exactly
[02:27:22] perfect does have a little Mark on that
[02:27:25] there
[02:27:27] so yeah that's the only thing on that
[02:27:30] there is a little bit of a spot on that
[02:27:32] from when it was pulled out must been
[02:27:33] like that way when it was pulled out of
[02:27:34] the pack but little bit of a mark
[02:27:38] there we'll do uh let me check
[02:27:43] here see uh
[02:27:57] call that um
[02:28:00] $8 instead of being 10 or nine that it
[02:28:06] is say it's $8 because a little Mark on
[02:28:08] the bottom there if you want
[02:28:13] it up to you well that's how it came out
[02:28:16] of the pack though I can't do anything
[02:28:18] about
[02:28:19] that Alexander the Great Lloyd or I

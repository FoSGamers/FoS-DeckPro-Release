[00:02:14] no where have I put our giveaway
[00:02:17] cards what did I do with those
[00:02:35] what did I do with all
[00:02:37] those give me a second I thought I had
[00:02:39] him right
[00:02:54] here give me one sec here I think I
[00:02:56] might have mistakenly put things
[00:02:58] together
[00:03:11] where did I put
[00:03:18] them
[00:03:19] okay maybe that wasn't it
[00:03:35] H I don't know what I did with them so
[00:03:36] let's just do this
[00:03:52] instead silly how that's all there
[00:04:01] there that's what we
[00:04:06] doing one two three four five 6 Seven 8
[00:04:10] nine 10 all right we're going to shuffle
[00:04:11] those up here quickly I know I'm
[00:04:12] ignoring everyone for right now sorry
[00:04:15] we're going to throw one two three four
[00:04:17] five out for number five for our
[00:04:20] giveaway to start that
[00:04:22] there and hey look what I got yesterday
[00:04:25] we did another opening of a box
[00:04:30] a raise foil Ren the
[00:04:34] Relentless that one oh
[00:04:41] my no it is not working
[00:04:47] today what about regular packs yes no
[00:04:50] checkin is no it is not working
[00:04:54] today let me see our giveaway is going
[00:04:57] to go right there
[00:05:01] right here we're going to have our two
[00:05:03] fo raised foils look at these raised
[00:05:04] foils my family pulled out pretty good
[00:05:07] deal on that now we'll throw this here
[00:05:11] we'll pin that right now if anybody
[00:05:13] wants who this is the $2 pole box there
[00:05:16] now it's kind of similar to the last one
[00:05:17] we don't have as many cards though we do
[00:05:20] not have as many cards though that's why
[00:05:22] if you want to make sure you read what
[00:05:23] the rules are do check those out all
[00:05:27] right and then I think there was
[00:05:29] something that set on my [ __ ] my browser
[00:05:31] and that's what the problem
[00:05:34] is it's like not recognizing some
[00:05:42] stuff either
[00:05:44] way
[00:05:47] yes it's whatnot for the shipping I
[00:05:49] can't do anything about that because you
[00:05:50] can get packs out of this and you get
[00:05:52] multiple cards because you get multiple
[00:05:53] cards when you get over like a certain
[00:05:55] amount you can't ship them then this
[00:05:56] individual shipping so that's what that
[00:05:58] is for Shipp shpping on certain things
[00:06:00] and even or maybe you want to try the
[00:06:02] the different
[00:06:06] one let's do this actually I G to
[00:06:10] edit we're going to
[00:06:15] do see if that
[00:06:18] helps or you can do this one ah the new
[00:06:21] one that I have the one on top which is
[00:06:23] play boosters and it's collector booster
[00:06:26] oh I'll go grab that one second
[00:06:46] I realized I forgotten my drink I was
[00:06:48] getting
[00:06:49] thirsty now my friend that is all right
[00:06:54] here by the way just so you
[00:06:58] know those are that's right here so we
[00:07:00] have that available for our friends if
[00:07:03] you'd
[00:07:04] like you have all the numbers for these
[00:07:07] cards as you can see are written
[00:07:10] down on the backs of
[00:07:14] these all right all the names of
[00:07:19] them so we're going to shuffle these up
[00:07:22] so you can see where they
[00:07:25] are that they are all written in there
[00:07:29] one wanted to show you that they're all
[00:07:30] on there cuz the box was not completely
[00:07:32] in view it was partially out of view
[00:07:34] there so I want to make sure we're all
[00:07:36] within regulation showed you everything
[00:07:38] was written down now we're shuffling up
[00:07:40] the packs again so we can put them
[00:07:42] together and you can decide where you

[02:01:25] the job more because I never actually
[02:01:27] ended up going back to school for it but
[02:01:29] I had done it stuff and developed stuff
[02:01:31] since I was like 12 I actually had a
[02:01:33] Home Server that I built that I used to
[02:01:35] use stuff and get games from um College
[02:01:37] people when I was 12 years old because I
[02:01:39] would I'd have a server set up so I
[02:01:40] could get games my games they would be
[02:01:42] on there they would get their my games I
[02:01:44] would trade their games that we could
[02:01:45] have and
[02:01:47] um I I might have crash a college at one
[02:01:51] point because they one of the guys on
[02:01:52] the college campus didn't give me
[02:01:53] something he said he was going to and I
[02:01:55] I sent a little virus over and I found

[02:02:40] um I didn't really want to go back
[02:02:43] because there was some things that I
[02:02:44] just like the political part of some of
[02:02:46] the teaching in in um Public
[02:02:48] Schools is ridiculous
[02:02:53] like I had a couple of issues with other
[02:02:55] teachers that were saying like the kids
[02:02:57] that were coming from the Alternative
[02:02:58] High School oh they were just going to
[02:02:59] cause a disruption to the point that I
[02:03:01] had to go to the principal and be like
[02:03:02] hey they're not letting him do stuff in
[02:03:04] class because they're saying there gonna
[02:03:05] be a problem like he's not a problem he
[02:03:06] knows this because I taught it to him so
[02:03:08] the principal had him do this stuff in
[02:03:10] class but then from that point on I had
[02:03:11] a problem with that teacher it's like a
[02:03:13] [ __ ] high it's literally like high
[02:03:14] school even with the teachers it was
[02:03:16] like ridiculous I'm like I'm not doing

[02:07:14] right not a big hit but it giv you a
[02:07:15] little discount on shipping and stuff
[02:07:17] now uncles the the thing is that I
[02:07:19] realize is um certain people get into
[02:07:23] play and um then
[02:07:26] they like politics gets into stuff and
[02:07:29] they should never be
[02:07:30] in it should never be in schools
[02:07:32] personally and I have a problem with
[02:07:34] politics getting into schools kids
[02:07:36] should not be associated with anything
[02:07:38] politically related it should be teach
[02:07:40] the kids so they learn it shouldn't be
[02:07:43] whatever specific way they say it should
[02:07:45] be the with the c way the kid learns all
[02:07:47] people learn differently which is what
[02:07:49] we had when I was younger like sometimes
[02:07:51] there was like three levels of classes
[02:07:53] there's a lower middle and a higher
[02:07:54] level and it wasn't that you were dumb
[02:07:56] it's just you needed a little extra help
[02:07:58] because you didn't understand something
[02:07:59] in science compared to the other person
[02:08:01] and the problem is nowadays it's like
[02:08:02] everybody needs to be the same well no
[02:08:04] one is the same every person in the
[02:08:06] world is unique in their own way so you
[02:08:09] can't put them into this bubble that
[02:08:11] they want to put you in a box and that's
[02:08:13] the biggest thing they keep doing with
[02:08:14] all the testing and everything and it
[02:08:15] screws kids up which is why we've gone
[02:08:18] from one of the highest in the world for
[02:08:20] the smartest people to one of the midle
[02:08:22] to the
[02:08:26] lowest all right I need a number from

[02:29:17] and my wife pulled out the ren the
[02:29:19] relentless
[02:29:21] if this was one of if this was like a uh
[02:29:23] a raccoon or an otter we'd probably keep
[02:29:26] it because we're going to make a raccoon
[02:29:28] Rocket Raccoon deck and my son was
[02:29:30] actually smart he said keep the otter
[02:29:32] because his friend was the otter from
[02:29:33] the from the movie I'm like oh you know
[02:29:35] what that's actually a good idea so we
[02:29:37] forgot to hit the gong on your hits

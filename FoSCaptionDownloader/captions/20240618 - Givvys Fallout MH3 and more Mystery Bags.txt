[00:04:43] understand that one I don't I'm not
[00:04:44] worried about it I'm good with that I
[00:04:46] completely understand it don't worry hey
[00:04:49] it's one of those things I've been there
[00:04:50] myself I um I have to start paying a
[00:04:52] little bit more attention I uh did did
[00:04:54] something took some time off taking some
[00:04:56] time for myself here in the process of
[00:04:59] that
[00:05:00] I uh don't have the same income coming
[00:05:02] in that I used to so all right we're
[00:05:04] going to put those out there why is that
[00:05:06] not and uh so I have to take myself a
[00:05:08] little break that I used to do can't
[00:05:10] just go buying things willy-nilly
[00:05:14] anymore all right this is what we're
[00:05:16] going to do all right that should be in
[00:05:18] there
[00:05:22] now that should be working in there now
[00:05:25] Infinity should be showing I don't know
[00:05:27] why it wasn't before
[00:05:30] kind of frustrating because I know I set
[00:05:32] it up to show in there add to the
[00:05:36] show there we go there we go that's what
[00:05:39] I was trying to make sure everything was
[00:05:41] showing I want to make sure everything
[00:05:43] was in
[00:05:52] there yeah it happened sometimes see
[00:05:54] like what happens most of the time I
[00:05:55] have like a lot of people to come in
[00:05:57] they'll do singles and stuff like that
[00:05:58] you know what I'm going to put this here
[00:06:01] and I use that for that one you know
[00:06:03] they'll do singles a lot of the times
[00:06:05] and um with that being said people doing
[00:06:07] the singles they'll start buying and all
[00:06:09] of a sudden like yo oh crap I just spent
[00:06:11] like $400 not not for me I've seen them
[00:06:14] do it on other channels like oh crap
[00:06:15] I've just spent $400 on those singles I
[00:06:17] didn't realize I was buying all
[00:06:20] those so I know exactly what you're
[00:06:22] talking about I'm actually G to switch
[00:06:23] this I'm going to put that right over
[00:06:24] there that's our giveaway that is our uh
[00:06:27] it Heralds the end as our thing there

[00:13:12] will ship plain wide
[00:13:14] envelope anything that is $10 over I do
[00:13:17] not ship plain white
[00:13:18] envelope I don't like doing that but I
[00:13:21] will do it for the other stuff that's
[00:13:23] why I like to do that way bones barking
[00:13:25] out already in the morning
[00:13:27] here we'll see how things go today we'll
[00:13:31] have a good
[00:13:33] one now I think what we'll do too is you
[00:13:38] also have if anybody wants to jump in
[00:13:39] participate oh did we get a little bit
[00:13:40] of raid or something going did I miss
[00:13:42] something or did all of a sudden a bunch
[00:13:44] of people show up did I miss a raid
[00:13:46] because I was turning away looking
[00:13:47] please don't tell me I missed a raid and
[00:13:48] I was a jerk or just people just started
[00:13:50] showing up if people started showing up
[00:13:52] I could take that it's like a store what
[00:13:54] is it the benefit of opposed to CG all
[00:13:56] right you can see the cards you can buy
[00:13:58] the packs we open live um so that's kind
[00:14:01] of like the benefit so if you have any
[00:14:02] questions about them you can like even
[00:14:03] see what they look like you know you can
[00:14:05] take them out of the sleeves and
[00:14:06] everything uh generally it's cheaper
[00:14:08] than TCG player so that's the other
[00:14:11] thing too you're a lot of times you get
[00:14:12] them cheaper than TCG player that's what
[00:14:14] one of the benefit is at least with me
[00:14:17] like you know TCG you'll go on you'll
[00:14:18] see what the price is so for instance I
[00:14:20] can put my U when I'm using whatnot here
[00:14:22] I can put I have a little pricing thing
[00:14:23] built that is in the bot we have here
[00:14:26] and I can put out what the price is and
[00:14:27] it pulls the price from TCG a believe
[00:14:30] and then it shows it on screen for you
[00:14:33] all right and then when it does that I'm
[00:14:35] trying to work on it show on screen and
[00:14:36] video wise but when it does that what I
[00:14:38] like to try to do is I like to do
[00:14:41] this I like to put them in at what the
[00:14:44] price is there but not that same exact
[00:14:46] price something a little bit better so
[00:14:47] you guys may want
[00:14:48] them then we have Joshua coming in with
[00:14:51] a win for our giveaway there thank you

[00:17:30] should have been this shipping if it
[00:17:32] wasn't I don't know
[00:17:37] why is that shipping correct that should
[00:17:40] have been the correct shipping number
[00:17:41] seven all
[00:17:43] right one two three four five six and
[00:17:46] seven all right number seven is right
[00:17:48] there that is what we'll put up there
[00:17:51] that's going to be uh a single of some
[00:17:52] kind from Modern Horizon could be
[00:17:55] anything big could be something small
[00:17:56] could be something who knows what is in
[00:17:58] there but that's what we do hanging out
[00:18:00] with
[00:18:01] here all right no one wanted that single
[00:18:04] so we'll put this one right here now
[00:18:07] hopefully that shipping came up better
[00:18:09] for some reason every now and again the
[00:18:11] shipping doesn't come up right and now
[00:18:12] if it's a c that's on like $10 or less I
[00:18:15] generally under $10 I generally have the
[00:18:17] shipping as plain white envelope which
[00:18:19] means just like kind of like an a card
[00:18:21] that you would get shipped to you in the
[00:18:21] mail or any type of mail
[00:18:24] thing now if you want to have it shipped
[00:18:26] with um tracking where we do like a a
[00:18:28] little bit more I think this is 10
[00:18:32] y we would do a um not a plain white
[00:18:36] envelope I do the other
[00:18:37] one which is why it's a little bit more
[00:18:39] which is why you notice sometimes it's a
[00:18:41] little bit more than
[00:18:42] others why that is not it well looks
[00:18:46] like I'm going to have to do a little
[00:18:47] TCG player right
[00:18:51] here and we'll type fury because it's
[00:18:53] not showing up
[00:18:56] correctly Fury retr frame

[00:20:24] YouTubes Rich card allows me to pay
[00:20:27] ahead by swiping it through a crack of
[00:20:29] my Walker well it depends on which one
[00:20:31] you're using and what type of crack it
[00:20:34] is
[00:20:35] Austin I mean if you're if it's if it
[00:20:37] depends
[00:20:38] on like
[00:20:53] uh what is he talking about crack
[00:20:57] interesting what Walker I mean like if
[00:21:00] it's a white walker is it going to be
[00:21:01] like is it going to cause them to like
[00:21:03] start to like uh is like one of this if
[00:21:05] I mean if if I guess if it's um made out
[00:21:07] of dragon fire you know you could do it
[00:21:09] with white walker that would be a cool
[00:21:10] card you swipe it down the crack and it
[00:21:12] just disappears and you get money

[00:30:56] one so did run all
[00:31:00] right I actually do have some unfin if
[00:31:03] uh people want to get like multiple
[00:31:05] things we do always do deals when you

[00:31:11] I do like to be able to do
[00:31:16] that yeah if you want to do some uh some
[00:31:19] things like that we can definitely get
[00:31:20] some people together and
[00:31:22] uh do a break of some kind throw some
[00:31:25] Infinity in maybe throw some others in
[00:31:30] what I was saying was we'll open them up
[00:31:32] have people buy into the break like
[00:31:33] we've been doing we've done in the past
[00:31:35] before and then we'll um do like it
[00:31:37] we'll either I don't know if we want to
[00:31:38] do like a digit break or uh or like a
[00:31:40] color break or one of those type of
[00:31:41] things we could possibly do or we could
[00:31:43] just do it where it's a break where I
[00:31:45] like to do it where we break it and we
[00:31:46] you know we say who gets what for
[00:31:50] packs that is not a slice on the card
[00:31:52] that is on the envelope by the way so
[00:31:54] I'm actually to turn that around and get
[00:31:55] rid of that one so that we can see it
[00:31:58] better and not be worried about there's
[00:31:59] a slice on that
[00:32:02] card it's just a sleeve ests
[00:32:08] invocation mh3
[00:32:11] 269 yeah so people want to jump in on uh
[00:32:13] on a break we can do one of those I can

[00:41:38] don't know if it's a um new version of
[00:41:41] the bot I think and I'm wondering if
[00:41:42] that's been causing some glitches
[00:41:43] recently with um whatnot like not
[00:41:45] picking up when I'm clicking on things
[00:41:48] so but there we go J.R
[00:41:50] gunny you got yourself the king Kudo

[00:41:59] you thank
[00:42:01] you there we
[00:42:04] go we're going to put that over here and
[00:42:06] we're going to put out our next one
[00:42:08] was the uh that's not a null Drifter
[00:42:11] it's supposed to be an Unholy
[00:42:15] heat Michael dakus
[00:42:18] today a ducus would be
[00:42:25] interesting Unholy Heat
[00:42:35] no that's not what I wanted that's not
[00:42:37] worth anything we're put you over with
[00:42:39] these ones that I'm going to do nothing
[00:42:44] with put them over these ones I'm decide
[00:42:46] I'm doing nothing with right now I don't
[00:42:49] like that we have an Unholy oh look at
[00:42:51] that one a little recruiter of the
[00:42:56] Guard a Corum profile I did not see that
[00:42:59] actually I'm
[00:43:01] sorry shipping so low it is depending on
[00:43:04] the type of single that you're doing
[00:43:06] some singles are um if I do them in
[00:43:09] their under if a packaging material is
[00:43:11] under $10 I do what's considered plain
[00:43:12] white envelope and what it does is it
[00:43:15] goes in no one's had any problems really
[00:43:17] doing them on the cheaper prices on so
[00:43:18] far but what they do is they go in just
[00:43:21] this card and I'll send it in one of
[00:43:23] these topl loader through the plane wide
[00:43:24] envelope like you would get a regular
[00:43:26] mailer kind of like one of these as a
[00:43:27] mailing envelope just white one you know
[00:43:30] and it goes through regular mail where
[00:43:32] the others when it's like $10 or more is
[00:43:34] when you have to package in like like
[00:43:36] like you know a you know like a bubble
[00:43:38] wrap stuff to make sure it's okay that's
[00:43:40] the difference because a lot of people
[00:43:41] don't mind and if you're buying a bunch
[00:43:43] of them together then then then it kind
[00:43:45] of adds up a little bit and it's not so
[00:43:47] so much so bad yeah you can set it up
[00:43:49] here and
[00:43:51] um and whatnot you should be able to set
[00:43:53] it up if you have any questions I can
[00:43:55] help you uh after my show or something
[00:43:59] we have a recruiter of the
[00:44:01] god I do package everything with care
[00:44:04] the best I can I mean like I said the
[00:44:05] plane white envelope ones they go the
[00:44:07] they go the way they go I can't really
[00:44:08] do too much about that but the rest of
[00:44:10] them I do package has really really good
[00:44:13] really really well there we go throw
[00:44:15] that one out
[00:44:18] there all right no
[00:44:21] problem
[00:44:22] bth I don't think I have those two cards
[00:44:25] you were talking about but let me double
[00:44:26] check on both of those cards
[00:44:30] there because you asked about the
[00:44:32] current
[00:44:34] car Quorum
[00:44:41] profile
[00:44:43] Bello I do not have Bello but I do have
[00:44:48] some Boulders gate if people want it
[00:44:51] actually I have Boulder's Gate in there
[00:45:01] Corum Corum the Undertaker is that what
[00:45:04] you're talking about Corum The
[00:45:05] Undertaker I do not have a Corum The
[00:45:11] Undertaker in like the extended art one
[00:45:13] I might have it
[00:45:15] in a different version it actually might
[00:45:18] be I don't know where it is I'd have to
[00:45:19] look around for that
[00:45:24] one yeah Boulders I think it is
[00:45:28] well if you do there you go you can jump
[00:45:29] on over and let over that Death
[00:45:31] guy one of those Apes all right let me
[00:45:34] um put that back there no one wanted
[00:45:36] that so we'll throw out a
[00:45:39] suty flare
[00:45:41] denial I
[00:45:44] mean why did I say subtlety I was
[00:45:46] looking at something
[00:45:49] wrong nice card right the air for you
[00:45:57] flare flare is a nice one it is a nice
[00:46:00] card it is a very nice card and now like
[00:46:03] I said since this is over $10 I Chang it
[00:46:06] to go for the different shipping which
[00:46:08] is the higher price shipping but it's
[00:46:09] because it getes you tracking gives you
[00:46:12] like uh Insurance you get bubble wrap
[00:46:14] and make sure nothing happens that's way
[00:46:16] I do it that way
[00:46:21] for why didn't that not run
[00:46:29] what having the home game here means
[00:46:31] that it's unlikely to win any no not
[00:46:34] necessarily there's a lot of people that
[00:46:35] win them all the
[00:46:38] time look at that who said that

[01:00:38] fortitude
[01:00:44] oh I know I know I know I shouldn't
[01:00:48] complain too much I did say I needed to
[01:00:50] get rid of them but they were supposed
[01:00:51] to be part of the game not always just
[01:00:54] being a giveaway
[01:01:00] that's the whole reason they're supposed
[01:01:01] to be dropped as loot in the game when
[01:01:04] you come and play but if no one's Inna
[01:01:06] come see that's if I lose them all doing
[01:01:08] this then I won't have any to do in the
[01:01:11] game all right let's put this out here
[01:01:13] for our next on screen a little flare of
[01:01:16] fortitude that's a good price for this
[01:01:17] one
[01:01:19] here and oh let's get this in the back
[01:01:23] give away not running
[01:01:26] let's get that running back
[01:01:28] there
[01:01:29] alrighty let's see what's that in the
[01:01:31] background we'll see that art is very
[01:01:34] nice on that I had a hard time getting
[01:01:36] rid of a handful of these cards just
[01:01:37] because of the art but I'm like I'm not
[01:01:38] going to use them because I don't play
[01:01:41] White really
[01:01:43] so Nassar coming in coming in with the
[01:01:47] win at the end
[01:01:52] Nassar now remember I do always do
[01:01:55] everything at sudden death because I
[01:01:57] like to uh I put it out at the price
[01:01:59] that I'm good at and if anybody wants to
[01:02:01] they people want to bid them up then
[01:02:02] they're good with that I just always do
[01:02:03] it at the price I'm okay with that's why
[01:02:05] I do sudden death that
[01:02:09] way not a problem it's not really that
[01:02:14] expensive I do not have any Vamp I don't
[01:02:17] have any vampires
[01:02:18] much I have a little bit for it but not
[01:02:21] too
[01:02:23] many oh yeah it's a good card there
[01:02:25] definitely a good
[01:02:29] rard yeah I can do that true I can use
[01:02:31] the singles for the loot drops yeah
[01:02:33] that's
[01:02:35] true we'll put out a little polluted
[01:02:39] Delta polluted Delta for all of you that
[01:02:42] like these cards
[01:02:44] huh and I like to show you guys the
[01:02:46] prices that's why I type them in the way
[01:02:48] I do it makes me feel like you know you
[01:02:51] get to see it you know what you're
[01:02:52] getting you're not getting screwed in
[01:02:53] any way shape or form you're getting
[01:02:55] exactly what you ask for and the reason
[01:02:57] why the pr shipping is higher is because
[01:02:59] you get track shipping in an envelope
[01:03:01] that is a a padded envelope whenever you
[01:03:03] get one of these ones that are more
[01:03:04] expensive so with that being said we're
[01:03:06] going to throw this out throw this out
[01:03:08] here for 13 instead
[01:03:10] of 16 like you get online God frog in

[03:08:21] let's put out an expedition map
[03:08:23] something like that
[03:08:27] quickly loot boxes all right so the loop
[03:08:29] boxes are you just you would buy into
[03:08:31] one of them and you would pick a number
[03:08:33] out of them and whatever number you get
[03:08:36] is what You' get out of that box there
[03:08:38] so say for instance um you decided you

[03:08:42] quickly so that people can see it the uh
[03:08:45] Expedition map here if you want it now
[03:08:47] say for instance you wanted to go with
[03:08:49] this Deluxe box right here all right and
[03:08:51] you picked the deluxe box you bought it
[03:08:53] you would tell me a number and say you
[03:08:55] went with number 15 and it happened to
[03:08:57] be modern Horizon 3 clear collector
[03:09:00] booster and then you play the game with
[03:09:02] our character and you would be able to
[03:09:03] get an assault rifle so I'm G to just
[03:09:05] Shuffle that stuff up quickly that would
[03:09:08] be what you would have gotten with our
[03:09:09] character in The Wasteland and you would
[03:09:10] start a little B Adventure in the
[03:09:12] Wasteland with our G character that you

[03:09:23] agile Scout maybe you're an intelligent
[03:09:25] engineer maybe you're a mysterious medic
[03:09:27] and you go wandering through this weight
[03:09:28] land trying to find Wasteland trying to

[04:57:04] regular
[04:57:06] basis but I think what I'll do is the
[04:57:10] basic loot box was
[04:57:14] that I say we go through some singles
[04:57:18] again should I dig
[04:57:20] [Music]
[04:57:24] into some of my other stuff that I'm
[04:57:26] unaware that I have that I forgot
[04:57:29] about should I dig into some other
[04:57:34] areas let's look into some other ones
[04:57:37] let's dig into some other ones that I
[04:57:38] haven't had out recently I think that's
[04:57:40] a good
[04:57:41] idea maybe a roadside Relic I didn't
[04:57:44] remember I had some of these ones this
[04:57:46] what I'm saying I got stuff all over the
[04:57:47] place I don't even know what I have half

[04:57:57] frustrated with everything the with the
[04:57:59] the work stuff that I completely forgot
[04:58:02] about everything I was doing all the
[04:58:03] time maybe an entrapment maneuver with
[04:58:05] it
[04:58:16] got so backed up that even after work I
[04:58:18] wasn't doing anything I was trying to
[04:58:19] keep my mind off of
[04:58:23] stuff start at for
[04:58:29] doll I might have actually I think I
[04:58:34] do hold

[05:30:38] foils now it's going to
[05:30:40] be
[05:30:42] as um the shipping will be a little
[05:30:45] higher because I do it for the ones that
[05:30:47] are close to $10 because I like to have
[05:30:49] them go in padded envelopes with
[05:30:55] tracking oh maybe it was join too many
[05:30:58] at
[05:31:00] once I I thought it was like if somebody
[05:31:03] won a bunch of them once all through
[05:31:04] different
[05:31:06] shows is what I was understanding
[05:31:07] understanding but maybe I maybe I was
[05:31:09] wrong
[05:31:11] there interesting huh maybe it had
[05:31:14] something to do with something else then
[05:31:16] all right we'll put that Bastion back
[05:31:19] there we
[05:31:20] go Bastion of
[05:31:22] remembrance maybe people would like to
[05:31:24] see some
[05:31:30] reanimates shipping is included on um
[05:31:34] for well what do you mean for the
[05:31:36] Bastion
[05:31:40] shipping on on on the Bastion
[05:31:43] was
[05:31:46] um I can do the lower shipping that's
[05:31:49] why I like to ask people do you want to
[05:31:50] have it with the shipping that is the
[05:31:53] shipping that is like the plain white
[05:31:54] envelope shipping which is $10 or less
[05:31:56] for like one card which would be this
[05:31:59] here pricewise and you end up getting it
[05:32:02] like this hold
[05:32:03] on PL white envelope this L what it
[05:32:06] means plain white envelope
[05:32:09] it gets put in one of these and I put
[05:32:11] the wrapping around it and stick it all
[05:32:13] together and that's how it gets shipped
[05:32:15] I haven't had any issues with it for the
[05:32:16] most part yet but um that's how it's
[05:32:20] cheaper shipping the more expensive the
[05:32:22] shipping is because we have it the other
[05:32:23] way where we have it um it goes in an
[05:32:26] envelope that's like a padded
[05:32:28] envelope like a padded envelope that get
[05:32:32] Shi out and those are just different
[05:32:35] prices whoa how much I don't know where
[05:32:37] where you live that's insane I'm sorry I
[05:32:39] didn't know you live that
[05:32:40] far that might be what it is it depends
[05:32:43] on where you
[05:32:44] live wow that's
[05:32:47] weird Arizona that's insane that it
[05:32:50] shouldn't have been that
[05:32:53] much International oh
[05:32:56] oh maybe International but Arizona
[05:32:59] shouldn't be
[05:33:03] fine hold on
[05:33:08] do this let's try
[05:33:11] this I wonder if that will be a little
[05:33:13] different right
[05:33:16] now is that any
[05:33:23] different oh oh okay okay okay okay okay
[05:33:28] okay okay okay okay okay we got it I got
[05:33:31] it I got it yes it went up because I
[05:33:32] changed the um I didn't know if he was
[05:33:34] looking for the other shipping I was
[05:33:35] saying it was a different shipping
[05:33:36] there's two different ones
[05:33:38] that expensive shipping gives you the
[05:33:40] the envelope that's a padded
[05:33:42] envelope this
[05:33:45] shipping gives you the white envelope
[05:33:47] that I showed
[05:33:53] you yeah it depends on where you're
[05:33:55] getting what you're doing it's because
[05:33:57] of what it is and Hayward Hayward got

[05:34:18] between them so you
[05:34:21] know so it depends on yeah that's what I

[06:27:06] because I don't have them on here for
[06:27:08] me and arasa The Slayer hold on a
[06:27:15] second that a misprint on here I think
[06:27:18] you got a weird dot on that you see
[06:27:23] that is that only
[06:27:26] me let me zoom in a little bit
[06:27:30] more yeah you see that
[06:27:32] dot that's little circle I don't know
[06:27:35] why there's a circle there anybody know
[06:27:37] why there's a circle right there I'd
[06:27:39] very much like to know that's intriguing
[06:27:42] to me I've never seen that
[06:27:46] before H
[06:27:48] interesting we'll put that back over
[06:27:53] here hey if it's a misprint from the 90s
[06:27:56] it could be I don't
[06:27:58] know that was just an interesting I've
[06:28:01] never seen a DOT on that I mean it could
[06:28:03] be regular
[06:28:04] because I don't think I pulled much
[06:28:05] Sarah Paladin though but that's the
[06:28:08] first time I've seen a little dot on
[06:28:10] that so I'm going to put that in the top
[06:28:11] over there I don't
[06:28:13] know yeah misprint from the 90s

[06:42:29] for about I think I'm going to head out
[06:42:31] in about 20 or so minutes I think that's
[06:42:33] what I might be doing here about 20 or
[06:42:35] so more minutes because I got other
[06:42:36] stuff I got to do I got to take care of
[06:42:37] things at the house here so with that
[06:42:40] being said let's see where we are in our
[06:42:42] check-ins have we gone to something
[06:42:44] crazy with our check-ins because that
[06:42:46] would be
[06:42:48] insane let's see where we're
[06:42:54] at where we are with our check-ins we
[06:42:57] are
[06:42:58] at oh my oh my we might be able to hit
[06:43:02] 300 checkins I think let's see might be
[06:43:05] able to hit
[06:43:14] 300 oh you know
[06:43:16] what I say if we can get over
[06:43:20] 300 just because it's the CL the first
[06:43:22] time we've hit
[06:43:23] 300 instead of making it 350 for the
[06:43:26] second
[06:43:28] booster I'll make I'll put an Exelon in
[06:43:32] there and I IIA in there I mean ioria in
[06:43:35] there we'll make it two if we can hit
[06:43:36] 300 checkins by the end of the stream I
[06:43:39] think that's a good
[06:43:41] idea I think that's a good one I think
[06:43:44] that's tolerable what do you guys

[06:43:47] minutes or so that's only we're at one

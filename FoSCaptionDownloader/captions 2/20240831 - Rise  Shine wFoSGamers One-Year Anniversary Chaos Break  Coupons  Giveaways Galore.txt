[00:07:17] that that that and that yeah that is it
[00:07:21] all right that was what we were doing
[00:07:22] today let me do this here quickly
[00:07:57] I think that is it we
[00:08:06] go yep yep yep all
[00:08:11] right now this is going to be a big one
[00:08:14] that's why I was saying it's a big one
[00:08:16] but the cool thing about this instead of
[00:08:18] there
[00:08:19] being so
[00:08:23] here it is going to be this for our buy
[00:08:26] and for it to do the break but the cool
[00:08:28] one about it is uh I'm going to do
[00:08:30] something
[00:08:33] intriguing I'm going to do something
[00:08:35] intriguing since this is the one year
[00:08:37] anniversary I want do some fun things

[00:17:58] update with the new new computer I got
[00:18:00] and I shut off auto update so I'm I'm
[00:18:01] wondering if I have to roll back Chrome
[00:18:03] that's what my thought process is here

[00:39:05] that's why that's why instead of this
[00:39:06] being like an $80 thing I know it's a
[00:39:08] big one it is a small one there is it's
[00:39:11] 71 so that's pretty cool instead of
[00:39:13] having it that way it was uh I made it a
[00:39:15] little cheaper for you guys maybe you
[00:39:17] want somebody wants an Awakening Sun's
[00:39:20] Avatar all righty let me get that out
[00:39:22] there for you
[00:39:31] what was that hello post not too bad not
[00:39:34] too bad rocket man how you doing my
[00:39:35] friend we have a heroic intervention not
[00:39:39] a big one there not a big hit on the
[00:39:41] other
[00:39:46] one throw that out there
[00:39:52] maybe heroic intervention let's put in
[00:39:55] auction on screen
[00:40:00] and we have to edit that so that it is
[00:40:04] lower you having a good Saturday morning
[00:40:07] so
[00:40:09] far yes I have no problem expl
[00:40:11] explaining the break for you my friend
[00:40:13] so the way we do the break is um instead
[00:40:17] of uh this is a $11 card I'm going to
[00:40:19] throw it up for 10 for you guys so in
[00:40:21] the break the way that we do the break
[00:40:22] is I open all the packs and the Fallout
[00:40:26] um secret layer anything that is a
[00:40:28] Mythic or a rare or over $3 we put in
[00:40:30] the sleeves we shuffle them up and we
[00:40:32] hand them out to everyone in pretty much
[00:40:33] in the order that they got them the um
[00:40:37] store will be last so they get the last
[00:40:39] of everything but anyways they get
[00:40:42] handed out that way and then that's how
[00:40:43] you get that's what you get there so
[00:40:44] every card that is $3 or more or any
[00:40:47] rare or Mythic that is pulled out of any
[00:40:49] of the cards are put into that so you
[00:40:51] can you'll get you'll definitely get
[00:40:52] something because there's no way that
[00:40:54] you're going to come out with nothing
[00:40:54] the way that it's handed out you always
[00:40:56] it's just literally your name so for
[00:40:58] instance uh we'll
[00:41:00] say going to put our our friend here
[00:41:03] we're going to pin this right now so for
[00:41:06] instance our buddy here Turtle wolf
[00:41:08] jumped in and what it would be is he
[00:41:10] would get the first he'd have he'd have
[00:41:13] his name here number one Turtle wolf and
[00:41:15] then from that point on whoever got the
[00:41:16] next one would have the next name and
[00:41:18] all I do is Shuffle up all the mythics
[00:41:19] rares and things cards over $3 and then
[00:41:23] you then I hand those out to everyone in
[00:41:25] the order they purchase so it's pretty
[00:41:26] simple
[00:41:27] and then all the commons and uncommons
[00:41:29] get handed out after so like later today
[00:41:31] I'm going to end up doing a show quickly
[00:41:32] to show hand them out when I'm um like
[00:41:34] today we're going to do a uh a game
[00:41:36] tonight and during the game tonight I'll
[00:41:38] be um organizing some of the cards for
[00:41:40] everybody that I put out that way so
[00:41:41] that we can see them all and everybody
[00:41:42] can see what they got and what they um
[00:41:44] got with Commons and uncommons and all
[00:41:45] that
[00:41:47] stuff but

[01:00:19] go turtle is the first one foris is the
[01:00:21] next one
[01:00:23] Zim Zimmer the next
[01:00:27] one and there you go zimmy is the next
[01:00:29] one then we have big say big decided he
[01:00:32] want to go in then big was the next one
[01:00:33] you know that's how I do it there and
[01:00:34] hand them out that way after shuffling
[01:00:37] up all of
[01:00:43] them
[01:00:48] interesting that's weird that you
[01:00:50] weren't allowed to share it
[01:01:00] yeah it's understand I understand that
[01:01:02] actually it happens life happens at
[01:01:04] times I've been there more than once and
[01:01:07] I'm very sorry about the um the loss too
[01:01:10] I hope hopefully um you're doing
[01:01:14] better no you get every single card
[01:01:17] every single one of the cards are handed
[01:01:19] out so I go through and like so say
[01:01:21] there's like a generally there ends up
[01:01:22] being like a stack of rares and mythics
[01:01:24] like and cards worth $3 about this big
[01:01:27] and then I hand them out to everyone
[01:01:29] then every afterward afterwards like
[01:01:31] later today when I'm I'm going to try to
[01:01:32] we're going to do a live where we're
[01:01:33] going to do a video uh we're going to do
[01:01:35] a live today we're playing a game while
[01:01:37] during the game I was going to do off to
[01:01:38] the side on one of the videos here I was
[01:01:39] going to organize them while we're
[01:01:41] playing the game so that everybody will
[01:01:43] be see me putting all the commons and
[01:01:44] uncommons into their
[01:01:48] stuff yeah so you could get it depends
[01:01:50] on how many you get two three rares you
[01:01:53] could get um say there's like you know
[01:01:56] you know 50 rares everybody would get
[01:01:58] about 50 rares and and mythics and cards
[01:02:00] over $3 everybody would get five because
[01:02:03] it would go one to each person kind of
[01:02:07] like you're getting a pack of things and
[01:02:08] then all the uncommons and uncommons
[01:02:09] would go out
[01:02:11] also yeah so I that's how it would work
[01:02:15] there yeah just hand them out to
[01:02:16] everyone but right now Turtle wolf and
[01:02:18] foris are in so they're the first ones

[01:24:02] nice and an an fenza kry spirit and foil
[01:24:06] and an elemental token not bad
[01:24:12] there yeah it is weird that it does it
[01:24:14] only on and well they only they don't
[01:24:16] develop everything for Android R they
[01:24:18] only do it mainly for um Apple stuff
[01:24:20] which is the reason why I ended up make
[01:24:22] getting Apple myself now spad I don't
[01:24:25] know what you're talking about for the
[01:24:26] uh discount because the discount is on
[01:24:28] prices that I have not even changed for
[01:24:32] um let's see I don't think they've
[01:24:34] changed for about three months now so
[01:24:36] have a good one Spade good luck in life
[01:24:38] I guess uh you're weird that's weird
[01:24:43] anyways you look at those YouTube chat
[01:24:45] people sometimes they go off on some
[01:24:47] things and I don't think they even know
[01:24:48] what they're talking about raage conjur
[01:24:51] Dept
[01:24:54] now I don't need
[01:24:56] braids let's see what that
[01:25:04] is let's see little braids that's not
[01:25:07] even a big one there but I know personal
[01:25:09] tutor was a nice hit I think I had I had
[01:25:12] personal tutor
[01:25:19] before here we go now that is um
[01:25:25] yeah a lot of stuff gets
[01:25:28] lost yeah they said um I don't know what
[01:25:31] they're talking about I was reselling
[01:25:32] cards I'm like yeah so I was just saying
[01:25:34] uh1 to $5 off a $12 mark off oh scam
[01:25:37] artist is what I was told by some SP
[01:25:40] geni
[01:25:42] spini I don't really what he's talking
[01:25:44] about though because I was um selling it
[01:25:47] cheaper than everywhere else which is
[01:25:49] interesting people are weird on there
[01:25:51] though sometimes they try to give me a
[01:25:52] hard time and they're not and it's not
[01:25:54] even just like that one was just like a
[01:25:56] person going off ridiculously but every
[01:25:58] now and again there's like a there's a
[01:26:00] person that'll try to give me a hard
[01:26:01] time and being like inappropriate or
[01:26:02] weird or whatever and I can throw stuff
[01:26:04] back at him I've been used to that but
[01:26:06] this these ones I just kind of like I
[01:26:07] don't know what's going on with you man
[01:26:10] oh all over the place that's why that's
[01:26:11] why it's kind of nice to deal with them
[01:26:13] sometimes and they try to do it and try
[01:26:14] to be a hard give you a hard time versus
[01:26:16] just the people freaking out when they
[01:26:18] try to give you a hard time like joke
[01:26:20] like make fun of you or whatever I I'm
[01:26:21] pretty good with going back at them been
[01:26:24] that way my entire life though so
[01:26:26] anyways let's put on
[01:26:30] a let's put this on if you want it
[01:26:34] here for this I think it's $6
[01:26:38] card if I remember right get yourself a
[01:26:41] personal
[01:26:43] tutor well I think it's because they um
[01:26:45] generally a lot of times they they
[01:26:47] they're unhappy people with their lives
[01:26:48] and they got to make other people
[01:26:49] unhappy around them to make their lives
[01:26:51] feel better you've got a faithless
[01:26:53] looting
[01:26:54] my
[01:26:57] friend for
[01:26:59] t-rock now tck can you give me a number
[01:27:03] between one and
[01:27:07] uh one and 10 my friend and dreamer came
[01:27:11] in I like it
[01:27:14] dreamer getting the single
[01:27:18] there nice
[01:27:21] pickup there you go
[01:27:25] and you got this my friend the personal
[01:27:28] tutor now let me get that in the top
[01:27:30] loader there we
[01:27:32] go actually write your name on it first
[01:27:35] let's write your name on it
[01:27:36] first that's a b good pick up there
[01:27:48] death like I like when that we do it
[01:27:51] this way cuz nice thing with this one is
[01:27:53] death you get a nice discount and then
[01:27:54] your shipping is uh on the cheaper side
[01:27:58] but as everybody knows the reason why
[01:27:59] the she shipping is cheaper I always
[01:28:01] make sure I I tell everybody it does it
[01:28:03] goes in a white plain white envelope
[01:28:06] like that and shipped all right that's
[01:28:09] why it doesn't get like full tracking
[01:28:11] like it tracks every location so that's
[01:28:13] part of the reason why that is a little
[01:28:15] cheaper on you guys but gets you a
[01:28:17] discount so you get some fun things
[01:28:19] thank you very much my friend death
[01:28:21] dreamer instead of spending like $4 on
[01:28:23] shipping from like TC G you pay a dollar
[01:28:25] or less but you have to wait sometimes a
[01:28:28] little bit it might be like a few days
[01:28:29] longer type
[01:28:32] thing yes the brakes get tracking the
[01:28:34] brakes do get tracking the brakes do get
[01:28:36] tracking it's just the singles that are
[01:28:39] any single that is um I can do up to
[01:28:41] three cards um into one of the top
[01:28:43] loaders and then um if I do anything
[01:28:46] more than that the generally they send
[01:28:48] stuff back to me for whatever reason
[01:28:50] even though it's like legally within the
[01:28:51] right limit and everything's fine but
[01:28:53] for whatever reason freaking post office
[01:28:55] there's a couple of them around the
[01:28:55] country that'll just send stuff back can
[01:28:58] I get a number between one and 10 I
[01:28:59] forgot about that t Rock could you do
[01:29:01] that for me so um I have to so I I found
[01:29:04] around three of them so three cards is
[01:29:06] where you're able to do the plain white
[01:29:07] envelope at least for me here and then
[01:29:09] um after that it ends up being shipping
[01:29:12] tracked the thickness of it yeah well
[01:29:14] the thing is it's not even um it's
[01:29:17] within the thickness of it actually so
[01:29:19] like I've measured them all and they're
[01:29:22] within well within the thickness of
[01:29:23] everything
[01:29:24] and that's the thing that frustrates
[01:29:27] me we're going to do um yeah they just
[01:29:30] want to get money exactly they just need
[01:29:32] a new way for money all right this is
[01:29:34] what I'm going to
[01:29:40] do okay our 10 sided dice here we're
[01:29:44] going to roll that to see what we get
[01:29:45] for our
[01:29:46] next number one all right number one is
[01:29:49] the card coming out for our giveaway now
[01:29:51] these were some cool dice that a friend
[01:29:54] of mine our friend Mike came in earlier
[01:29:56] Mike tapen roll actually got sent over
[01:29:57] to me he um was very nice and uh helped
[01:30:02] us out one time helped me out one time I
[01:30:03] was having a rough day having a rough
[01:30:05] experience for a little while and they H
[01:30:07] got me that and I was very appreciated
[01:30:09] of
[01:30:10] it they got me some nice dice set of
[01:30:14] them very good
[01:30:17] person yeah no it's not the weight
[01:30:19] either Oblivion it's within weight and
[01:30:21] the size because I've measured every
[01:30:23] single time the make sure and I make
[01:30:25] sure CU I measured five cards in a top
[01:30:27] loader in that envelope is under the
[01:30:29] weight and it's within the size limits
[01:30:30] it's supposed to be so there should be
[01:30:32] zero reason for it not to for it to do
[01:30:34] that all right we're going to put the

[01:36:02] and that's what's in the break there now
[01:36:04] the thing with the break that is cool is
[01:36:05] I made it out of 11 spots so one of the
[01:36:07] spots which will be the last one will be
[01:36:09] the store now I charge I only pay you
[01:36:13] guys are only paying for I'm paying for
[01:36:15] one of those spots so you guys are
[01:36:17] paying out of those 10 Spots You're only
[01:36:19] paying 10 of those spots there and
[01:36:21] you're actually getting it kind of like
[01:36:22] a discount on it already and then you
[01:36:24] get to use a coupon code on top of it so
[01:36:26] you guys getting sweet discount on that
[01:36:28] break right now because that would
[01:36:29] normally be like an 80 Ser I think it
[01:36:32] was $83 if I remember the math and now
[01:36:35] it's a
[01:36:38] 71 um I don't know if you can
[01:36:41] retroactively do that the only thing I
[01:36:44] could think of is you could cancel maybe
[01:36:48] and um and then start it again that's
[01:36:51] the only thing I can think of
[01:36:53] and if you would like you could try do
[01:36:55] requesting a refund and um I can do that
[01:36:57] if you would like but I don't know if
[01:36:58] that would
[01:37:00] work tumra there you go my

[02:02:56] assists me with it this is all myself
[02:02:58] I'll tell you how this started so long
[02:03:00] story short my friend is I started out
[02:03:03] doing this with my son wanted to open
[02:03:06] some packs of cards online because he
[02:03:07] saw people doing it I'm like I can't so
[02:03:09] like all right well we bought a couple
[02:03:10] boxes because I was just getting back
[02:03:11] into with uh Magic and uh it was like
[02:03:14] marching the machines when I start like
[02:03:15] my kids found that my stuff and wanted
[02:03:17] to play some and then then I noticed
[02:03:19] that Lord of the Rings was coming out
[02:03:20] and I jumped in big with that
[02:03:22] and I had a bunch of like extra cards
[02:03:24] that I wasn't going to be playing with
[02:03:26] and my um my son was like oh well we
[02:03:28] should open some packs online and do
[02:03:30] some videos and I'm like all right well
[02:03:32] we did a couple of them like I can't
[02:03:33] afford to do all these and I ended up
[02:03:35] getting one of the videos too we ended
[02:03:36] up pulling out a uh a Dwarven uh soul
[02:03:39] ring which was nice but anyways Mark if
[02:03:42] you can give me a number between one and
[02:03:43] 10 I appreciate it um we used to so we
[02:03:47] weren't able to do that I wasn't able to
[02:03:49] afford it I'm like hey buddy can't keep
[02:03:50] doing this I don't have I'm not a person
[02:03:52] so because of that he's like he started
[02:03:55] finding ways that people are selling him
[02:03:57] and I'm like all right well we looked at
[02:03:58] it and looked into a couple ways and we
[02:03:59] went came on here and sold some of my
[02:04:01] singles that I had like I made a pole
[02:04:02] box and we sold out of almost all of my
[02:04:05] things in like a day so I was like oh
[02:04:07] that's crazy then I tried and I made
[02:04:09] another one and it was like probably
[02:04:11] three days later that and I sold out
[02:04:13] again I was like wow this is insane so I
[02:04:15] used all that money and I bought more
[02:04:17] stuff and we did some pack breaks and
[02:04:21] stuff like that and I sold out of those
[02:04:23] and I kept doing it and building it up
[02:04:25] and I would happen working another job
[02:04:26] at the time so I took uh I was that
[02:04:29] other job paid for my awes obviously I
[02:04:30] made living so every all my stuff that I
[02:04:32] took profit here in I just kept putting
[02:04:34] it back in and building it to the pack
[02:04:36] point that you see now after a year
[02:04:38] later so nobody supports me I support
[02:04:40] myself completely I started out from
[02:04:43] absolutely nothing having nothing but uh

[02:48:39] that nice goren I like it that's what I
[02:48:42] try to do myself like make it organized
[02:48:44] I have I use um I use a lot of uh I use
[02:48:47] um Google myself a Google
[02:48:53] Sheets someone could leave with a $1,000
[02:48:56] monol that is correct nerd Sports it is
[02:48:59] potential that the monobolt could come

[02:49:08] monol
[02:49:11] yeah we had run them off here I I can't
[02:49:14] watching these ones off CU I already

[02:49:20] spots versus the 10 spots cuz this would
[02:49:22] have been
[02:49:23] $83 but I made it 71 because I ended up
[02:49:27] taking one of the spots for the store
[02:49:28] because we're going to take one spot as
[02:49:30] the store and we're going to put it off

[04:08:53] in there that was the one that was on
[04:08:55] top of everything and separated so I've
[04:08:57] come to the conclusion that those ones

[04:09:01] something that you get a card that's

[04:13:08] means it's going to have a proxy of it
[04:13:09] so it's protected as a card that's the

[05:21:32] with that
[05:21:34] one all right we're done with them all
[05:21:38] it is time to shuffle everything
[05:21:42] up and put them all out with everybody's
[05:21:45] name on it so this is what we're going
[05:21:46] to do move these things out of the
[05:21:49] way except for our giveaway
[05:21:53] cards keep those there move this out of
[05:21:56] the
[05:21:57] way I'm going put a couple things there
[05:21:59] so that we can see stuff in the
[05:22:00] background it doesn't and it blocks it
[05:22:02] off let me do this
[05:22:05] here cuz we don't like things falling
[05:22:08] down in the the back there so I want to
[05:22:09] make sure nothing Falls so going to put
[05:22:12] that right there all
[05:22:14] right put those over here like this kind
[05:22:17] of protect things a little
[05:22:19] bit and we're going to close that up
[05:22:21] because we don't need the scissors
[05:22:22] anymore anytime soon CU we got to go
[05:22:25] through all these and here's our stack
[05:22:27] of
[05:22:28] rares and our ones that we have to have
[05:22:31] organized our rares and ones there that
[05:22:33] are nice one good luck everybody so what
[05:22:35] we're going to do now is we're going to
[05:22:36] take these go like this and give it a
[05:22:39] shuffle a gentle Shuffle see how I just
[05:22:41] like Let Them Fall Down in between I
[05:22:43] don't really push anything at all going
[05:22:45] do the same thing with these ones add
[05:22:47] those
[05:22:49] in and give it a little mix of the
[05:22:51] shuffle
[05:22:53] there and drop them down let them drop
[05:22:56] in there we
[05:23:00] go now I need to add in these ones here
[05:23:03] from our
[05:23:05] other specialized cards
[05:23:08] very
[05:23:09] gently adding those
[05:23:12] in here we go going to keep shuffling
[05:23:14] them up a little bit here I'm going to
[05:23:15] give it a second to shuffle them all and
[05:23:18] then after a after a second of me
[05:23:20] shuffling them I'm going to ask you guys
[05:23:21] to tell me when to stop and then when I
[05:23:24] stop is when I stop shuffling and that's
[05:23:26] the point that we hand them out and who
[05:23:28] happens to get them happens to get them
[05:23:30] in whatever order they
[05:23:32] get so yeah that's how it goes give it a
[05:23:35] second here I'm going to give it an
[05:23:36] extra shuffle for we say like a 5
[05:23:39] Seconds

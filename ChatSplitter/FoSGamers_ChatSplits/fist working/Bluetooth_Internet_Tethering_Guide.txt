That is my computer 

[2024-10-10 08:02:08] ChatGPT:
Thank you for sharing the image of your MacBook Air’s system information. Based on the details you provided, your MacBook Air is running macOS Ventura version 13.6.6 with an Apple M2 chip. 

It seems that you may not have the **Bluetooth PAN** option readily available, which is common for recent macOS versions. Here’s how you can address it:

### Alternative Steps to Enable Bluetooth Internet Sharing:

1. **Check System Preferences for Sharing:**
   1. Open **System Settings** from your MacBook.
   2. Go to **General** > **Sharing**.
   3. Ensure that **Internet Sharing** is enabled and properly configured.
   4. Under **Share your connection from**, select **Bluetooth PAN** (if it's available). If not, this option may no longer be directly supported in the latest versions of macOS Ventura, and you may have to rely on Wi-Fi or USB tethering.

2. **Consider Wi-Fi or USB Tethering:**
   Since Bluetooth PAN may not be present, it might be more efficient to use Wi-Fi or USB tethering for internet sharing between your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and your MacBook Air.

   - **Wi-Fi Hotspot:**  
     On your Galaxy S24 Ultra:
     - Go to **Settings** > **Connections** > **Mobile Hotspot and Tethering**.
     - Turn on **Mobile Hotspot** and configure it with a password.
   
     On your MacBook Air:
     - Click the Wi-Fi icon in the menu bar, and connect to your phone’s Wi-Fi hotspot.

   - **USB Tethering:**  
     On your Galaxy S24 Ultra:
     - Connect the phone to your MacBook via a USB cable.
     - Go to **Settings** > **Connections** > **Mobile Hotspot and Tethering**.
     - Turn on **USB tethering**.
   
     Your MacBook should automatically recognize the phone as a network source and connect to the internet.

Not recognizing tethering 

[2024-10-10 08:07:03] ChatGPT:
If your MacBook Air is not recognizing tethering via USB or Bluetooth from your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, let's troubleshoot step-by-step to find the issue.

### 1. **Ensure Proper USB Cable and Port Connection**
   - Make sure you're using a good-quality USB cable that supports both data transfer and charging.
   - Try different USB ports on your MacBook Air to rule out any port-related issues.

### 2. **Enable USB Debugging (if needed)**
   Sometimes, enabling USB debugging can help the MacBook Air detect your phone better.

   1. On your **Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra**:
      - Go to **Settings** > **About Phone** > **Software Information**.
      - Tap **Build number** 7 times to enable **Developer Mode**.
      - Go back to **Settings** > **Developer Options**.
      - Scroll down and enable **USB Debugging**.

### 3. **Check Mobile Hotspot and Tethering Settings**
   Make sure **USB tethering** is turned on:
   
   1. Go to **Settings** > **Connections** > **Mobile Hotspot and Tethering** on your Galaxy S24 Ultra.
   2. Turn on **USB Tethering** while your phone is connected to your MacBook via USB.
   
   Your MacBook should detect the phone and automatically connect to the internet.

### 4. **Verify Network Preferences on macOS**
   1. Go to **System Settings** > **Network** on your MacBook Air.
   2. Look for a new network interface related to your phone (it might appear as **Samsung USB** or similar).
   3. If it is not listed, click the **+** button to manually add a new network interface and select **USB** or **iPhone USB** if it's displayed.
   4. Ensure it’s connected and properly configured for internet use.

### 5. **Check Samsung Drivers on macOS**
   macOS may need additional drivers or updates to properly detect your Samsung device:
   
   - Ensure your macOS is up to date by checking for software updates in **System Settings** > **General** > **Software Update**.
   - You can also try installing **Samsung Smart Switch** for macOS to ensure all relevant drivers are installed. This sometimes helps with connection issues between Samsung devices and macOS. Download it [here](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/app/smart-switch).

### 6. **Test Wi-Fi Hotspot**
   If USB tethering still isn’t working, try setting up a **Wi-Fi hotspot** as a fallback:

   - On your **Galaxy S24 Ultra**, go to **Settings** > **Connections** > **Mobile Hotspot and Tethering**.
   - Turn on **Mobile Hotspot** and set it up with a network name and password.
   - On your **MacBook Air**, connect to the phone’s Wi-Fi network by clicking the Wi-Fi icon in the menu bar and entering the password.

### 7. **Reboot Both Devices**
   Sometimes, a simple reboot can resolve any network or detection issues:
   - **Restart your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra** and your **MacBook Air**.
   - After rebooting, try USB tethering or Wi-Fi hotspot again.

If the issue persists, let me know, and we can explore additional troubleshooting options.

Thank you for the image. I see that your network settings screen doesn't display the option to add a new network with a **+** button, as is common in older macOS versions. Since you're using macOS Ventura, the interface has changed slightly.

### Here’s how to troubleshoot further and potentially resolve the issue:

### 1. **Ensure the USB Connection is Properly Recognized**:
   - **Reconnect your phone** using the USB cable and check for any prompts on your phone. If prompted on your Samsung device to allow file sharing or internet sharing, make sure to enable it.
   - Check if any new network interfaces appear on your MacBook under **System Settings** > **Network** after connecting your phone.

### 2. **Check Tethering Mode on Your Phone**:
   - **On your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra**, make sure **USB tethering** is turned on:
     1. Go to **Settings** > **Connections** > **Mobile Hotspot and Tethering**.
     2. Toggle on **USB Tethering**.

### 3. **Install Samsung Smart Switch on Mac**:
   You can try installing **Samsung Smart Switch** to ensure proper drivers are installed for your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra on your MacBook Air:
   - Download it from [Samsung's official site](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/app/smart-switch).
   - After installation, reconnect your phone and check if it is recognized for tethering.

### 4. **Try Wi-Fi Hotspot**:
   If USB tethering isn’t working, you can try using the **Wi-Fi Hotspot** method:
   - On your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra:
     1. Go to **Settings** > **Connections** > **Mobile Hotspot and Tethering**.
     2. Turn on **Mobile Hotspot** and configure the network name and password.
   
   - On your MacBook Air:
     1. Click the **Wi-Fi icon** in the top right of the screen.
     2. Select your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra’s hotspot from the list of networks and enter the password.

### 5. **Restart Both Devices**:
   Sometimes, a simple reboot resolves detection issues:
   - **Restart both your MacBook Air and your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra**.
   - After restarting, try enabling tethering again via USB or Wi-Fi hotspot.

[00:25:06] you get one it's a build your um all
[00:25:07] right so the build your bundle it's not
[00:25:09] funky it's a build your own gift bundle
[00:25:11] I'm sorry there's supposed to be gift
[00:25:12] bundle in there because instead of you
[00:25:14] know like gift bundles normally had a
[00:25:15] collector booster well you're G to get
[00:25:17] collector booster of one of those things
[00:25:18] with it so for instance this is what I'm
[00:25:21] going to do here so for instance we'll
[00:25:23] say this
[00:25:25] here will be seven of those plus you get
[00:25:29] one of well we're going to call it one
[00:25:31] of the
[00:25:34] um seven of the Lord of the Rings plus
[00:25:39] one of these all right that's what it's
[00:25:40] going to be seven of the Lord of the
[00:25:42] Rings plus one of these okay so that's
[00:25:44] what it is build your own gift bundle
[00:25:45] that's why there's the multiple things
[00:25:47] in there so you get seven lord of rings
[00:25:51] packs uh set boosters I have a whole
[00:25:53] another box plus one of these and it's
[00:25:55] like your own gift bundle now the other
[00:25:57] ones would be if you say wanted to do
[00:25:58] one of the other collector boosters that
[00:26:00] I have which would be midnight hunt
[00:26:01] modern Horizon 3 law of Thunder Junction
[00:26:05] or adventures and Forgotten Realms we
[00:26:07] can do that yeah yeah yeah it's like a
[00:26:10] build your own gift bundle because they
[00:26:12] don't have them anymore so I figured you
[00:26:14] build build your own

[00:44:17] available out of the 12 you're going to
[00:44:19] have the whole box
[00:44:22] broken of the set boosters of Lord of
[00:44:24] the Rings and then we're going to open
[00:44:26] up the um special here also and those
[00:44:29] will be broken up between everybody and
[00:44:31] shuffled out maybe you get some of those
[00:44:32] maybe not I don't know it's up to you
[00:44:33] guys but the other thing that I had this
[00:44:35] morning was this that I had grabbed for
[00:44:37] myself now some of you know that I'm a
[00:44:39] fan of
[00:44:42] sorcery so you know that I have been um
[00:44:46] playing it for a little while
[00:44:50] now having a lot of
[00:44:52] fun but one of the
[00:44:55] things is there's not too many people
[00:44:57] that play it and I was not around and I
[00:44:59] did not be I was not one of those people
[00:45:01] that got into it when um sorcery first
[00:45:06] came
[00:45:06] out so like I was not part of the
[00:45:08] kickstarter or any of these stuff like
[00:45:10] that so that being said I got myself an
[00:45:13] alpha box to open isn't that silly
[00:45:16] that's silly isn't
[00:45:18] it that's silly isn't it but I
[00:45:22] did I bought myself an alpha Box
[00:45:25] open sorcery is kind of like um Magic
[00:45:29] Gathering and chess mixed together in
[00:45:32] one all right so if you were going to
[00:45:34] take those and mix them together and
[00:45:35] make one kind of cool fun game that's
[00:45:38] kind of what you get with
[00:45:43] sorcery so what I'm going to do here is
[00:45:45] I'm GNA actually to start opening some
[00:45:46] of my sorcery packs just to see kind of
[00:45:49] what we get here today I know I'm going
[00:45:52] to yell at crack and open this sorcery
[00:45:53] but if you guys are intrigued by it I'll
[00:45:56] get another one
[00:45:58] I'll get another box if some of you guys
[00:46:00] are the sorcery fans and we can um all
[00:46:02] jump in on some of this but here myself
[00:46:04] I go oh my and it's
[00:46:08] done it's opened it has been
[00:46:13] opened has been
[00:46:16] open here we
[00:46:19] go no no going back
[00:46:23] now no going back now
[00:46:30] there we go good luck I know well there
[00:46:34] are some R very nice uh things that we
[00:46:36] can get in
[00:46:38] here um
[00:46:40] now with that we have
[00:46:44] our promo pack here with the sorcery
[00:46:46] which is our sorcerer card now so so
[00:46:49] this is like um as you can see it's kind
[00:46:51] of like if you notice it this is a
[00:46:52] little bit better quality than magic too
[00:46:54] which is nice nice stuff you have a
[00:46:56] raised on your on your letters on all of
[00:46:59] them and it's a nice solid good foil
[00:47:02] those ones are
[00:47:05] but I did use 99% of its value I did but
[00:47:09] I wanted to open it for myself I didn't
[00:47:11] care about value this was for this is
[00:47:13] for a me thing if that makes any
[00:47:16] sense but we do have our break

[01:54:29] different one which I understand they
[01:54:31] took the offer with the higher amount
[01:54:33] but my understanding that other offer is
[01:54:35] trying to get financing so I'm just
[01:54:36] laughing because there's three boats so
[01:54:38] far that we talked to and there your
[01:54:41] offer is low compared to the other ones
[01:54:43] that we have that I'm like well this
[01:54:45] both's been on the market for uh how
[01:54:47] long how long now and all of a sudden

Search the internet and find me the best AI video editing available, whether it is on a computer installed or something on the internet. Now I would need to be able to search through video that is up to 7 hours long as one video, and be able to break it into videos that could be anywhere as I could tell to be like 30 or less videos by doing the pack openings that I do when finding that, because I do pack openings of Magic the Gathering cards, and then also be able to cut it into shorts automatically by making it to a minute or two minutes or whatever I need it to be to be able to work with the format. Maybe if it's a YouTube short or if I'm going to an Instagram reel or Twitter thing, etc.

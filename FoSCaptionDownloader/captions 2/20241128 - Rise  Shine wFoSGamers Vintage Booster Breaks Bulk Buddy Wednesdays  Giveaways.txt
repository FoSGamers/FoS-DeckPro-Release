[00:03:52] um things out
[00:03:55] for what we have in
[00:03:57] our things today
[00:04:00] so
[00:04:02] today what do you do next with your
[00:04:04] character all right well since you have
[00:04:05] your character if you want to do
[00:04:06] something next what you would looking to
[00:04:08] do is You' uh you you would uh know get
[00:04:12] your character running through our
[00:04:13] Wasteland for the vault further CU since
[00:04:16] you just kind of like stopped into the
[00:04:17] Vault you'd want to wander further into
[00:04:20] it maybe find some different places some
[00:04:22] different rooms eventually you want to
[00:04:24] get to the first floor door that's the
[00:04:26] goal put it right there all right that's
[00:04:28] good can I have the whole box
[00:04:30] thank
[00:04:31] you appreciate that I'm going to put
[00:04:33] that over here
[00:04:35] today I'm going to take one of these two
[00:04:38] I think we'll open up one of those
[00:04:47] too all right I think we might do that
[00:04:49] one for right now and see what we get in
[00:04:51] that weapons pull box yes if you need
[00:04:54] some weapons we would want to do that
[00:04:56] let me see let me get show you what's in
[00:04:57] the weapons one today
[00:04:59] let me get
[00:05:04] that it
[00:05:12] is where are
[00:05:18] they well they
[00:05:21] here where they put them all
[00:05:38] all righty that's
[00:05:40] insane the
[00:05:43] cards that go
[00:05:48] in
[00:05:50] break where I set him down last
[00:05:52] night thought I set him down in one of
[00:05:56] these but I can't find it right now
[00:06:01] hold
[00:06:05] on this is not all of them this is
[00:06:08] the I'm missing there should
[00:06:16] oh make sure I didn't forget them how
[00:06:20] work it worked out very well make sure I
[00:06:22] didn't forget
[00:06:25] them so these are in it right now in the
[00:06:28] weapons one
[00:06:30] I do believe that's the weapons
[00:06:35] one yes that is the weapons one all
[00:06:38] right so this isn't the weapons one
[00:06:39] right here so we'll run that if you want
[00:06:41] to try some weapons today all right get
[00:06:43] you some weapons and you can go on your
[00:06:44] adventure see what's going on and see
[00:06:45] what's further on in the Wasteland here
[00:06:47] all
[00:06:50] right n if you have no weapons probably
[00:06:52] a weapon would help your character the
[00:06:53] best what do you have uh let me see just
[00:06:56] one let me get to your character here
[00:07:03] you yeah you have no weapons so yeah
[00:07:04] that's probably a good one that's a good
[00:07:05] idea to try to get some weapons here
[00:07:08] definitely did a good idea to do
[00:07:10] that and then what I'm going to do here
[00:07:12] is I'm going to open up my
[00:07:15] uh my stuff now and we're going to
[00:07:18] do make sure I have this up and running
[00:07:20] because it made it easier to run these
[00:07:22] when I did it like that all right all
[00:07:24] right you have an honored
[00:07:33] honored
[00:07:35] Hydra let me get that out for
[00:07:39] you honored Hydra and that also gets you
[00:07:43] an assault rifle which actually works
[00:07:44] out pretty well for you saying that you
[00:07:46] your last encounter I believe you got
[00:07:47] some AR ammo and one of the
[00:07:50] drops so that's not bad just
[00:07:54] one so you go all right dress one so you
[00:07:58] now have a and assault rifle Ah that's
[00:08:02] going to help in your adventure so just
[00:08:04] one let me get your character here your
[00:08:06] character is only 85 health because you
[00:08:08] were you were hit by uh you're
[00:08:14] attacked so you health is only at 85 you
[00:08:16] haven't used any of your health stuff
[00:08:18] though so we can remove that but you do
[00:08:20] now
[00:08:22] have an AR
[00:08:34] with 15 AR ammo we can run that again
[00:08:36] though for the people that want to try
[00:08:37] to get St PE pew pew we'll see what
[00:08:41] happens now if you want to you can try
[00:08:44] to go further on in the game here
[00:08:45] adventure and see what occurs but we'll
[00:08:47] do this here and we're going to open up
[00:08:48] one of these going to write your name on
[00:08:50] that your honored Hydra dress one
[00:08:57] blast we go
[00:09:02] I don't know if there's too many weapons
[00:09:04] I don't there think there is such a
[00:09:05] thing as having too many weapons that
[00:09:07] sounds like it's
[00:09:08] impossible I don't think that's possible
[00:09:10] wishing well oh look at that one Mahaya

[00:09:23] we get here for luck cuz this was um I
[00:09:25] think I don't know which one it was Will

[00:22:13] 80 a yes the weapon that's what I was
[00:22:15] saying jump on on the weapon here that's
[00:22:16] what it is you need to get yourself a
[00:22:18] weapon you can try for the weapon box
[00:22:20] that's why I keep running or we if you
[00:22:22] want to go back and I'll take one step
[00:22:25] back so you know what I was doing here
[00:22:26] this is the weapons box
[00:22:29] there you go ah there you go yeah you
[00:22:31] need yourself a weapon Well normally if
[00:22:34] you fight something you can try to win
[00:22:36] or you can run away but if there was say
[00:22:38] if you win every now and again you can
[00:22:39] have them drop their weapons or
[00:22:41] something but you got unlucky and had a
[00:22:43] big man to attack you but you got just
[00:22:45] got yourself a plasma rifle which wow
[00:22:47] dude that's a good one that gets you
[00:22:49] four
[00:22:54] shots where you can use those against
[00:22:56] your large bug which get you a plus five
[00:22:59] by the way there you

[00:23:08] second here for your card so we're going
[00:23:09] to go back to your last one we're going
[00:23:10] to give you give you another one here
[00:23:11] two rolls instead of just one oh look at
[00:23:13] that you got a
[00:23:15] 17 now that bug that large bug is a uh
[00:23:19] 30 no was a 40 that's a 40 bug 40 We
[00:23:21] Roll
[00:23:23] random oh nice one with your plasma
[00:23:27] rifle you take off a couple of its legs
[00:23:28] dropping it down to
[00:23:30] 26 on its Health do you want to swing
[00:23:33] you want to go after that bug again with
[00:23:34] your plasma
[00:23:36] rifle or you want to keep running and
[00:23:38] see what we get here going on
[00:23:41] here it's up to you my
[00:23:45] friend let's take it out let's take him
[00:23:49] out oh 14 plus five there you go that's
[00:23:52] what you need gets you over your 16 that
[00:23:55] bug comes charging at you but he wobbles
[00:23:57] a bit he can't swing at you anymore more
[00:23:59] so your your health is at 82 from him
[00:24:02] hitting you before but luckily he goes
[00:24:04] to swing at you and he falls right to
[00:24:05] the ground you use a plasma rifle again
[00:24:08] on them hit them because it's a plasma
[00:24:11] rifle you know it's a good shot on them
[00:24:12] and it drops him down
[00:24:15] too oh not bad that's not a bad one not
[00:24:20] a bad one drops him down to 11 now that
[00:24:24] means they're scared they turn to
[00:24:27] flee and as they turn to flee they

[01:59:39] Agent there you go Sleeper
[01:59:42] Agent there we are we're caught up

[01:59:53] Dawn Dawn of the Dead we're cut up we're
[01:59:57] cut up on those done there you go my
[02:00:01] friend well that's one of the things
[02:00:03] that if you don't have things running
[02:00:05] they don't keep you uh showing you so I
[02:00:06] got to have things running every now
[02:00:08] again so I just maybe need to do them
[02:00:09] less frequently I think run them less
[02:00:12] frequently is what I'm
[02:00:17] guessing there we go that's what I think
[02:00:19] I'll end up doing is running them less
[02:00:20] frequently make it a little easier
[02:00:24] go away sleep agent whoever all right we
[02:00:27] can do that whoever goes the next one
[02:00:30] I'll do that sleep rent for whoever goes

[00:01:34] um see if we can adjust that
[00:01:42] no there we go adjust the audio a little
[00:01:44] bit there we go no a little bit better
[00:01:46] there aha that's
[00:01:52] good there we go audio's been adjusted
[00:01:55] some so all right well we got a little
[00:01:58] bit of a new
[00:02:00] new new old thing I guess you would call
[00:02:04] it we have uh some fun times
[00:02:08] here when you are uh becoming a little
[00:02:12] Adventure you can uh this is our pull
[00:02:14] boxes that we have one two three or four
[00:02:17] oh we should probably label
[00:02:19] those should probably label those hold
[00:02:23] on didn't think about that one where's
[00:02:27] my poits
[00:02:30] oh no they were right
[00:02:34] here
[00:02:38] H I need to label those and where it
[00:02:40] supp this
[00:02:42] way sorry guys give me one second
[00:02:45] here I don't where they
[00:02:49] uh that doesn't work I'll just tape um
[00:02:52] something to it with number one two
[00:02:54] three and
[00:02:56] four but uh
[00:03:02] all right
[00:03:03] well we're going to have to um do
[00:03:17] this ready this will
[00:03:20] work forgot to do that I always forget
[00:03:24] one or two things you all hear me all
[00:03:26] right hopefully you can
[00:03:37] I have an
[00:03:43] idea there that should work we're
[00:03:45] getting one two three and
[00:03:51] four one
[00:04:06] two
[00:04:09] three four there you go that works
[00:04:12] easier make it so you can see it better
[00:04:14] I think about that before I was like oh
[00:04:16] crap I didn't think about the
[00:04:19] numbers
[00:04:22] go come
[00:04:25] on then I didn't think about getting the
[00:04:27] sticker off after after
[00:04:32] cutting get
[00:04:33] [Music]
[00:04:36] man oh my God that's
[00:04:40] horrible I I figured I could get the
[00:04:42] edge
[00:04:44] here well you can if you right on the
[00:04:46] right side you
[00:04:48] dumbass no wonder why it's not
[00:04:53] working no I wrote on the wrong side I'm
[00:04:55] wondering why the sticker's not peeling
[00:04:57] off idiot
[00:05:01] helps if you write it on the right
[00:05:03] side that way you can actually get to
[00:05:05] the sticker part of it so I forgot to
[00:05:07] put numbering on the car on things
[00:05:10] here all right there we go that works
[00:05:14] better I wonder why I couldn't get two
[00:05:18] off that doesn't sound right maybe it
[00:05:21] does we'll find out well anyways we
[00:05:23] going to run one of these we start our
[00:05:26] at there a little do giveaway to start
[00:05:27] it in the morning say thank you we'll do
[00:05:29] of our brakes here which is our virtual
[00:05:31] pull box here now this is a quick one
[00:05:33] we'll just start them out there we'll
[00:05:35] run one right now this is just a couple
[00:05:37] dollars see if you want to get one of
[00:05:39] these things and also we're going to get
[00:05:41] our I'll show you the game we got going
[00:05:42] we got our game we have a fun one for
[00:05:46] all of you today now the fun thing with
[00:05:47] it is we're we're building it with you
[00:05:49] we we continue to make it you know this
[00:05:51] is the first iteration of it all right
[00:05:54] so each one of our pole boxes here this
[00:05:56] one two three or four is all one box all
[00:05:58] right you should see them in the buy
[00:06:01] now all right and what is in there is
[00:06:05] the big thing that's in there I have
[00:06:06] written on there is one play booster of
[00:06:10] like one play booster box of dusm okay
[00:06:13] so that's written on one of the 1700
[00:06:16] cards in the four different boxes here
[00:06:21] the rest of them if you pull one out it
[00:06:22] doesn't have anything written on it that
[00:06:23] says that you get a pack of cards that
[00:06:27] will be bloom
[00:06:29] or
[00:06:31] murders or
[00:06:34] ioria all right then if you decide you
[00:06:37] want to go try it again you got to go
[00:06:39] again and see if you get uh see if you
[00:06:40] try it further continue on you can get
[00:06:42] instead of just deciding to get one of
[00:06:44] the if you want you can get two of those
[00:06:46] one's there or you can UPG upgrade it
[00:06:48] and get yourself maybe a
[00:06:51] DM um or modern
[00:06:54] Horizon um but say you wanted to go and
[00:06:56] do a third one you could do that again
[00:06:58] and you can upgrade it again and you
[00:06:59] know what a third one then I'll get you
[00:07:01] a uh a Dorn maybe um Dorn and you know a
[00:07:06] bloom or then you go with Ford it'll get
[00:07:09] you uh one of the collector boosters
[00:07:11] here so on so forth we'll give you
[00:07:13] options for each one of the things as
[00:07:14] you go up so that's kind of how it is
[00:07:17] there um how we have that set up for our
[00:07:20] thing that way you always get something
[00:07:21] no matter what if it has something blank
[00:07:23] on here that's no matter what you're
[00:07:24] getting now the reason I have a handful
[00:07:25] of them out here is I was writing on
[00:07:28] them for the game remember we have a
[00:07:30] little fun here we have some fun finding
[00:07:32] some Raiders and things like
[00:07:35] that right going have some Raiders
[00:07:38] having a good time so or maybe you get
[00:07:43] attacked by a
[00:07:45] bug we're not
[00:07:48] sure but we shall see but what I'm doing
[00:07:51] here is I've just been writing down so
[00:07:53] uh I have them all filled out eventually
[00:07:55] with different things and that's what it
[00:07:57] is there you pull it out and if you
[00:07:58] happen to get the one with that or just
[00:07:59] get a pack and we play our game
[00:08:01] depending on what's written on it
[00:08:02] there's nothing written on it since
[00:08:04] we're starting out here that's okay I
[00:08:06] might uh I'll just end up adding
[00:08:08] something to it but I'm slowly just
[00:08:09] adding because there you know 1,700
[00:08:11] cards I can't add 1,700 things to it but
[00:08:12] pretty much you go and buy whichever one
[00:08:14] of those you want and you can buy as
[00:08:16] many of them as you want or as many
[00:08:18] times as you want from whichever box you
[00:08:20] want within one round and we'll we'll go
[00:08:23] with our little Adventure game there but
[00:08:25] what I was doing here is I had that on
[00:08:28] we have this here we can see how we do
[00:08:31] not see how many people are even
[00:08:32] watching right
[00:08:33] now doesn't look like it's working at
[00:08:36] the
[00:08:37] moment all righty so we'll do this
[00:08:40] here that's our little Adventure game
[00:08:43] for those that you that see see it or
[00:08:47] understand it there or would like to try
[00:08:49] I'm going to write on as you see I'm
[00:08:50] going to do like this it would be like
[00:08:51] I'd have on one of them would say medium
[00:08:53] not Yeah medium bug don't have like I
[00:08:56] know say 15 that's what you have to hit
[00:08:58] to get it to be able to beat it when you
[00:09:00] roll what's
[00:09:01] up just playing a little game roll on
[00:09:04] through
[00:09:05] it then it would be like ah small
[00:09:11] Raider and I just have what you have to
[00:09:14] written on there kind of like the same
[00:09:16] thing oh no I pressed it it would be
[00:09:24] um that there
[00:09:32] you know that type of thing is what I
[00:09:34] would have written on each one of them
[00:09:36] get an example so you can see what it
[00:09:38] looks like I'm going put those back in
[00:09:40] here you know that card doesn't have it
[00:09:43] you know those four aren't going to have
[00:09:44] it on there we'll put those back in that
[00:09:47] way you kind of see what it is there and
[00:09:48] that's where that's how those are set up
[00:09:50] they'll be spread out throughout there
[00:09:52] that way when you pick one out whether
[00:09:53] it's part of the adventure or part of
[00:09:55] the uh or not as like I said as we go
[00:09:57] further every day I'm going to add more
[00:09:59] stuff to it it just I can't do 1,700
[00:10:01] cards overnight you know so I kind of
[00:10:03] make a little bit up as we go but right
[00:10:06] now maybe you guys can help me decide
[00:10:07] what we're going to write down on them
[00:10:08] though is kind of what I'm thinking you
[00:10:09] guys can as I pull something out
[00:10:11] nothing's written on it we'll be like
[00:10:12] all right what are we writing down on it
[00:10:14] on on one and we'll pull one out behind
[00:10:16] it and the blank one as long as it's
[00:10:19] blank we'll write something down on it
[00:10:21] and you guys can make a decision on it
[00:10:23] but right now what I'm going to do is I
[00:10:24] have some packs to open
[00:10:31] I think I'm going to go with this I
[00:10:32] think that's what I'm going to open

[00:37:55] booster box if not you're going to get
[00:37:58] bloomo and ioria or Murders At Carlo
[00:38:02] actually or lost Caverns Exelon I forgot
[00:38:03] the Lost Caverns Exon draft just the
[00:38:06] pricing of actually put them on screen
[00:38:07] probably would be easier to have an
[00:38:08] onscreen display of what you get
[00:38:11] yes third
[00:38:14] in well all right you get you get the
[00:38:16] first box this is for box number one all
[00:38:19] right that's why it says box number one
[00:38:21] there so you have random a third of the
[00:38:25] way in so we'll say a third of the way

[01:00:25] our safe where's our
[01:00:32] safe ah you find a

[01:00:57] better ability here so now this is a
[01:00:59] small safe it's easy safe it's going to
[01:01:01] take 12 to open but because you are

[02:15:47] your luck on maybe get yourself a
[02:15:48] mystery booster but you got yourself
[02:15:49] some singles some rares
[02:15:51] instead we got rares or uh the mystery
[02:15:54] booster it's up to you it's up to the
[02:15:56] system actually what happens the
[02:15:58] randomness that goes and how it runs all
[02:16:01] right and that's the virtual pull box
[02:16:03] there now if you want to and you would
[02:16:05] like to take over our character or our
[02:16:08] adventure in our Wasteland here that
[02:16:09] we've been doing maybe you want to
[02:16:11] become a human or maybe you want to be a
[02:16:14] detective here let's see you can jump in
[02:16:19] and you want to go in here try it
[02:16:22] out there you go in any in this number
[02:16:25] two would be on one of these four there
[02:16:27] is a a card in here that has play
[02:16:30] booster box written on it okay there are
[02:16:33] 1,700 cards well there's been something
[02:16:35] that I've pulled out already now if
[02:16:36] there's one that's doesn't have play
[02:16:37] booster box written on it you are going
[02:16:39] to get one of the and each one of the
[02:16:40] polls it starts with $6 you're going to
[02:16:41] get a booster a bloomo you could get a
[02:16:45] murderers Nixon or nioria all right then
[02:16:48] if you go for a second card and you want
[02:16:49] to try again you want to continue on
[02:16:51] with your character because you say you
[02:16:52] know what I'm going to be a human and
[02:16:55] you just fought a little bug and you
[02:16:56] want to go on further in that Wasteland
[02:16:58] Vault there and see what happens you
[02:17:00] know what I'm going to go a second one
[02:17:01] and I want to upgrade my pack and
[02:17:02] instead of going with bloomo I want to
[02:17:04] get a dmor so you get two your second
[02:17:06] one you run it again you get another one
[02:17:08] from here you go all right you got two
[02:17:09] cards and the second one doesn't come
[02:17:11] out with the play booster one that's
[02:17:12] okay play booster box that's okay
[02:17:14] because you run into a small Raider and
[02:17:18] that small Raider drops some pogs for
[02:17:20] for you so you can buy something in our
[02:17:22] Wasteland when you go and you kill them
[02:17:25] but because you went to you're never
[02:17:27] able to get a dustborne play booster or
[02:17:29] maybe you want a modern Horizon 3 or
[02:17:31] modern Horizon 2 that's just jumping on
[02:17:34] those and picking them up there there we
[02:17:37] go we'll run those and keep going
[02:17:39] hopefully you'll have a good one and try
[02:17:42] it out or and then as it goes if you
[02:17:45] want once you've got your character
[02:17:46] going maybe you want to just instead do
[02:17:48] a little side quest once you get your
[02:17:49] character you don't want to continue you
[02:17:51] want to do main things you know what I
[02:17:52] want to do a side quest for
[02:17:58] a attempt at getting a mystery booster 2
[02:18:02] well there you go there's your mystery
[02:18:03] booster 2 attempt or a single but either
[02:18:07] way side quest could end up being maybe
[02:18:09] you find a uh a safe or maybe you find
[02:18:12] yourself a
[02:18:15] wasteland Traer
[02:18:33] all
[02:18:35] righty no one wants to try any of those
[02:18:38] but we'll continue
[02:18:40] on or maybe somebody would like to go
[02:18:43] and try with the character we're going
[02:18:44] to go with the box to we're going to run
[02:18:45] this get a little discount for you try
[02:18:48] it out if you want and if you happen to
[02:18:50] find one the skulls in the virtual boxes
[02:18:52] that gets you
[02:18:53] a that gets you also a discount code for
[02:18:56] the store that's getting you some extra
[02:18:59] luck but right now you get one of these
[02:19:02] for five and which is guaranteed a pack
[02:19:04] at $5 is pretty much what it is it's not
[02:19:06] bad
[02:19:08] there then we'll keep going with some of
[02:19:11] our virtual ones here maybe you want to
[02:19:13] go after a modern Horizon
[02:19:17] 3 collector booster instead for $3 or
[02:19:21] some
[02:19:21] singles is up to you on how you're going
[02:19:25] to
[02:19:25] do but are you going to be a character
[02:19:28] playing the game I don't
[02:19:30] know all right so that being
[02:19:37] said all right we don't want
[02:19:43] that we'll do
[02:19:47] um maybe you want to try your luck on a
[02:19:49] bloomo
[02:19:53] um commander
[02:19:55] deck it's going to be packs a commander
[02:19:58] deck or the potential of singles where
[02:20:00] the floor is uh I think it's eight cents
[02:20:02] or there on that but there you
[02:20:05] go try that out but you could get a
[02:20:07] commander
[02:20:09] Deb that's a big there's a little gamble
[02:20:11] on that
[02:20:13] one all right I'm going to put out uh

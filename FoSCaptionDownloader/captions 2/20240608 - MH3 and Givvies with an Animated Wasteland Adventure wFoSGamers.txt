[00:52:05] [Music]
[00:52:10] wheeler put those up here and you get to
[00:52:13] continue on with our character
[00:52:15] here all right we got that agility
[00:52:21] booster and we are gonna go up
[00:52:24] against oh my a large Raider has come
[00:52:27] out in front of
[00:52:30] you yes the snake e his own tail exactly
[00:52:33] large Raider has come out in front of
[00:52:35] you and
[00:52:37] you are now going to be up against this
[00:52:42] large Raider what are you going to do my
[00:52:45] friend you have an assault rifle you
[00:52:49] have a health pack and an agility
[00:52:51] booster a rifle and you're going to
[00:52:52] shoot for the head I like it a rifle and
[00:52:55] you're going to shoot for the head
[00:52:57] we're going to throw these out here if
[00:52:58] somebody wants to take over for a minute
[00:53:00] here throw that for a minute if you want
[00:53:01] to take over of those two packs you aim
[00:53:04] for the head with that assault
[00:53:06] rifle three shots off oh he does not you
[00:53:10] missed him but he hits you for 20 damage
[00:53:13] oh no that large Raider comes over with
[00:53:16] his giant axe he swings at you your
[00:53:19] sword protects you luckily from getting
[00:53:21] the brunt of the damage you only take 20
[00:53:23] damage down to 130 Health but that large
[00:53:27] Raider thinks he's got the upper hand
[00:53:28] now your assault rifle is dangling down
[00:53:31] what are you going to do are we going to
[00:53:32] try to shoot
[00:53:35] again what are we going to do we have I
[00:53:37] think maybe one or two more T chances
[00:53:39] here because it's a big one GNA use your
[00:53:41] health let's use our
[00:53:44] health we use our health we're back up
[00:53:49] to 140 Health all right there we go
[00:53:52] we're going to shoot for the chest this
[00:53:55] time we shoot for the
[00:53:58] chest three shots oh let's
[00:54:02] see and oh those hit the draer this time
[00:54:06] oh that hit him for 26 damage but he
[00:54:08] hits you for four damage in the process
[00:54:11] I think this time it looks like the
[00:54:13] damage has the damage that you done to
[00:54:15] the Raider hasn't been enough to make
[00:54:16] him walk away oh the Raider is running
[00:54:19] away now the Raider has left he does not
[00:54:22] like the damage you've caused to him
[00:54:25] it's enough shots to your chest
[00:54:27] and now it is time oh I think it's time
[00:54:30] maybe somebody wants to go after the
[00:54:33] loot box that is

[01:57:22] character all right take over our
[01:57:25] character for those two right
[01:57:27] there and I'm going to say currently
[01:57:29] we're going through Oblivion what would
[01:57:32] we like to do we're continuing on we're
[01:57:34] going to skip over the loot box because
[01:57:36] no one has jumped in and jumped bump
[01:57:38] jumped on it so currently we're after a
[01:57:40] small
[01:57:45] Raider well that's why we gave you the
[01:57:47] other pack there that's why I gave you
[01:57:49] the uh the mo modern Horizon one
[01:57:55] T we're gonna do this here
[01:57:58] huh we'll see what I will say though we
[01:58:02] do every now and again people get thing
[01:58:04] I can't always do everything on on here
[01:58:07] that's all I gotta
[01:58:08] say we'll leave it at that we'll leave
[01:58:11] it at
[01:58:14] that that makes sense you get
[01:58:16] it all right so we're against that
[01:58:20] smaller Raider
[01:58:23] and we have our assault rifle we have an
[01:58:27] intelligence booster we have an agility
[01:58:28] booster and we have a strength booster
[01:58:32] in our in our
[01:58:33] inventory against a small
[01:58:37] Raider we are the Raider is armed right
[01:58:40] there you can see it there they have a
[01:58:42] little assault rifle type
[01:58:45] thing so you do have them seing up
[01:58:47] against you with a
[01:58:49] weapon I'm going to throw out a couple
[01:58:51] of the these here a couple of those
[01:58:54] right
[01:58:55] here take over the character if you'd
[01:59:00] like so do we swing at him or do we
[01:59:04] shoot or do we run
[01:59:08] away all right you're gonna go atam
[01:59:10] you're GNA use some agility oh I like it
[01:59:14] agility use the agility you use your
[01:59:18] sword and you go swing at them oh look
[01:59:20] at that you hit the arm
[01:59:22] you hit them in the arm for four damage
[01:59:24] not a lot though not enough that they
[01:59:26] Dro their weapon because they hit you
[01:59:27] for five damage in the process it looks
[01:59:29] like there wasn't a big shot there but
[01:59:31] you go and you slice them with your
[01:59:34] sword and that small Raider now has one
[01:59:37] arm is damage but it looks like they're
[01:59:40] getting ready to shoot you again when
[01:59:41] they're switching the other arm what are
[01:59:43] we going to do
[01:59:44] next no one want to take over our
[01:59:46] character for that so we'll throw out
[01:59:48] some other packs here maybe you guys
[01:59:50] want to do a uh
[01:59:52] a combo thing like this like something
[01:59:55] like
[02:00:01] these something like that
[02:00:04] maybe
[02:00:05] wow GNA try to disarm him again all
[02:00:09] right I think that's a good
[02:00:11] idea try to disarm him
[02:00:16] again oh you're going to go right up
[02:00:19] next to him Point Blank go right up next
[02:00:21] to him to point blank use that assault
[02:00:24] rifle three shots
[02:00:27] off and oh well that's a point blank we
[02:00:30] hit him he he wasn't a big he wasn't a
[02:00:32] strong one he only had 20 Health you hit
[02:00:34] him with that and you go down to oh
[02:00:37] bring out 16 Health that small Raider

[02:36:22] singles here again throw some singles
[02:36:25] out for you all go through some of the
[02:36:26] things that we've been opening I was
[02:36:27] figuring I was going to do this maybe a
[02:36:28] little bit tomorrow but we can do some
[02:36:31] of them
[02:36:35] now we can do some of them
[02:36:38] now m3c 72
[02:36:51] oh not bad on that external
[02:36:56] magma I can do that too I can definitely
[02:37:00] do specific
[02:37:02] packs not a problem at
[02:37:11] all why is this not showing
[02:37:17] here there you go
[02:37:25] yes the shipping
[02:37:31] fees well the um yeah the cursed did The
[02:37:34] Marauder it's a dollar they um the
[02:37:36] shipping fee is a dollar on those ones
[02:37:38] because we do plain white envelope so
[02:37:40] they go in like a a top loader and I put
[02:37:42] it in that PL mod envelope and ships it
[02:37:46] so we'll throw that back there and we're
[02:37:48] going to go and we're going to do some
[02:37:50] you know what I think we can do
[02:37:52] that they do get you a little bit
[02:37:55] sometime all right we can do some
[02:37:58] specific packs I like that let's start
[02:38:00] out with some
[02:38:02] mh3 we can do some of that let's do some
[02:38:06] mh3 here and see what we get we're going
[02:38:08] to start off
[02:38:10] with Let's do an auction here all right
[02:38:14] we'll start our auction
[02:38:21] there you
[02:38:23] [Music]
[02:38:26] go I do have collector boosters I have
[02:38:29] lots of collector
[02:38:35] boosters oh wow yeah um that's why you
[02:38:39] do get you do get charged for them
[02:38:40] separately but what you need to do is um
[02:38:43] you're going to need to make sure you
[02:38:44] just uh if you want a bunch of them
[02:38:47] together you can say hey I want to get a
[02:38:49] bunch buch of them together and you're
[02:38:50] going to get charged for just the one
[02:38:52] thing instead of having multiple
[02:38:53] shipping charges for individual ones so
[02:38:56] like a lot of times what I'll do if
[02:38:57] somebody's like hey I want a bunch of
[02:38:58] singles I'll just like kind of scroll
[02:39:00] through them all and show you or um also
[02:39:03] the way I have it set up is that it adds
[02:39:05] it up to if you get three of them it'll
[02:39:07] stay in a plain wide envelope but if you
[02:39:09] get four to five it goes to a um like
[02:39:12] one of the uh padded envelopes that I
[02:39:14] use so it ends up making a little bit
[02:39:16] more so it's like a $3 charge so I try
[02:39:18] to um adjust
[02:39:25] it yeah yeah makes I would have put them
[02:39:27] all together too but it um depends on
[02:39:29] what they are we'll throw one of these
[02:39:32] out for 40 those are out there for
[02:39:38] 40 there you go they are in the buy now
[02:39:42] there you go I'll pin it right now for
[02:39:43] it so you can see
[02:39:45] it see yeah see that's the thing pay
[02:39:48] more for shipping than the car sometimes
[02:39:49] and that's even the thing that stinks

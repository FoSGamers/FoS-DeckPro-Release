I cannot directly access or modify a Google Sheet for you. However, I can guide you on how to update the data in the sheet, or if you provide the necessary details (data format, intended changes, etc.), I can generate a CSV or script for you to upload or use in Google Sheets.

If you're comfortable sharing the data structure or a link to the sheet (ensure permissions are suitable for sharing), I can also provide precise steps or help create macros/scripts to automate the updates.

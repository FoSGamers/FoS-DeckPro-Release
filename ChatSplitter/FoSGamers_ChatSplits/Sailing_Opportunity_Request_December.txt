Look up sailing doodles. Learn all about them. We are friendly with Bobby from it having done a flotilla and also met st the Miami boat show. We want to send this message help us make it so he wants to help us. Maybe it could be content for him, who knows.

Hey it's James and Stefanie from the flotilla in the Bahamas. We have an odd question do you know anyone that would want to sail our Leopard 40 from bvi to Florida around the 1st week of December. We are going down next month for the survey and sea trial but Marquis (our Bahamas captain) that said he could help is actually tied up that time with a lot of deliveries. We were wondering if you know anyone or would be interested in a sail for a couple weeks.

They are currently looking for assistance with sailing their Leopard 40 from BVI to Florida around the first week of December. Marquis, their Bahamas captain, is unavailable for that timeframe due to other deliveries.

**Subject**: Possible Sailing Opportunity — December from BVI to Florida

Hey Bobby,

It’s James and Stefanie here from the flotilla in the Bahamas! We also ran into you at the Miami Boat Show. We’ve got an interesting question that you might be able to help with — or who knows, it could even turn into something fun for Sailing Doodles!

We have a Leopard 40 down in the BVI and are looking for someone to help sail her back to Florida around the first week of December. We’re headed down for the survey and sea trial next month, but Marquis (our Bahamas captain) is tied up with deliveries during that time.

We were wondering if you might know anyone who would be interested in this sail, or maybe even if it’s something you'd want to consider? It could be a great couple of weeks on the water, and who knows, maybe even some cool content for your channel!

Hope you're doing well, and we look forward to hearing from you!

Cheers,  
James and Stefanie

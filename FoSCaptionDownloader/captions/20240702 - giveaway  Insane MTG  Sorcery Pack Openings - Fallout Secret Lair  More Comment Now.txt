[00:03:42] the way if you ever have a chance to go
[00:03:44] fishing and you have breathing problems
[00:03:46] the salt in the Ocean Air like clears up
[00:03:48] your lungs and uh dries them out helps
[00:03:51] helps clear them up it's something
[00:03:52] having to do with the uh the salt I
[00:03:55] can't remember it
[00:03:57] is but that's good one he's
[00:04:02] running

[00:04:35] Water we know that one two three four 5
[00:04:38] 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
[00:04:44] 21 so I was uh when we went to the
[00:04:45] Bahamas and I was taking to the was in
[00:04:47] the uh sail the boat for a week the guy
[00:04:50] that was the captain we went down and we
[00:04:51] were dive we did some free diving to go
[00:04:53] down about 15 20 feet to get lobsters
[00:04:56] and no one else wanted to do it I'm like
[00:04:58] dude I want to do it I want to do it
[00:04:58] he's like are you sure like yeah I know
[00:05:00] what I'm doing I used to be a lifeguard
[00:05:01] blah BL blah I cannot hold my breath as
[00:05:03] long as I used to I can do about 30
[00:05:05] seconds now I used to be able to do
[00:05:07] almost like four minutes when I was life
[00:05:08] ring I was I was figuring maybe a minute
[00:05:11] no no I got 30 seconds and I was like oh
[00:05:14] crap I'm gonna die luckily I know how to
[00:05:16] keep my breath held so I don't inhale
[00:05:17] stuff water like you control yourself so
[00:05:20] like pretty much all your belongs are
[00:05:21] trying to do is expel CO2 so if you can
[00:05:24] control that exp expel and you don't
[00:05:27] blow out to suck back in you can like
[00:05:30] hold your breath a little bit longer
[00:05:32] it's more like your lungs just like it's
[00:05:33] kind of like a way of forcing your lungs
[00:05:35] to do what they're not supposed to I
[00:05:37] guess but anyways I was able to get up
[00:05:40] to the top no problem but the guy was
[00:05:41] like all right let's go back down again

[00:41:36] box and I got to get these put away
[00:41:39] nicely and
[00:41:40] organized and then I'll get right to
[00:41:42] yours my friend Beach magic games I like
[00:41:45] that I like it where are you at
[00:41:51] what not a problem so the adventure game
[00:41:54] is kind of fun all right so you get to
[00:41:56] participate we just actually finished
[00:41:59] our last adventure with our last
[00:42:01] character now because you can choose
[00:42:02] multiple characters it's actually in the
[00:42:04] show Notes too if you want to check the
[00:42:06] show notes but what you do is you pick a
[00:42:09] character because you're starting out
[00:42:10] right now you either pick an agile Scout
[00:42:14] strong
[00:42:15] human mysterious Medic or an intelligent
[00:42:19] engineer then we wander through the
[00:42:22] Wasteland trying to find uh your way to
[00:42:25] the end of it now as you wander through
[00:42:27] Wasteland you may encounter some
[00:42:28] creatures along the way those creatures
[00:42:30] may help you uh help you they may harm
[00:42:33] you some people have wrangled some of
[00:42:35] those creatures to use them as as pets
[00:42:37] others have used them all of them to
[00:42:39] kill them all and get their loot so it's
[00:42:41] always up to you what happens but
[00:42:42] whenever you play a game you always get
[00:42:44] a chance of one of these one of these
[00:42:45] things we call these benjes right here
[00:42:47] because you play it's kind of like a
[00:42:48] thank you for saying thank you for
[00:42:50] playing um and then you get obviously
[00:42:52] what you get in your box
[00:42:59] hopefully that uh helps you want to be
[00:43:01] the intelligent engineer I like
[00:43:03] it all right so as an intelligent
[00:43:09] engineer all
[00:43:12] good
[00:43:14] yeah oh as an intelligent
[00:43:19] engineer you go and wander through this
[00:43:23] Wasteland
[00:43:25] now you at some point you're going oh
[00:43:27] look it I find a loot box on the
[00:43:31] ground well look at that you found a
[00:43:33] loot box I have to give you new box here
[00:43:37] and that Loop box is the basic Loop box
[00:43:40] right here as you can see it's right
[00:43:42] here just a little bit behind the
[00:43:43] picture at the moment so this Loop box
[00:43:46] you find on the
[00:43:47] ground you go up to that you go oh
[00:43:49] wonderful what is this thing that's
[00:43:52] here and you get a number to choose out
[00:43:54] of this the giby is not running
[00:43:58] thank you I hit start I know I did but
[00:44:00] sometimes it doesn't
[00:44:09] run that Flawless maneuver out of this
[00:44:12] was good citizens I'm jealous of that
[00:44:15] one so you got to give me a number and
[00:44:18] we pick one from the basic loot box
[00:44:19] because that's just a it's a pull box
[00:44:21] that we do kind of like a pull box but
[00:44:22] it helps because it gives you um stuffed
[00:44:25] items for the Advent in the Wasteland
[00:44:27] that's the whole reason for the loot
[00:44:32] boxes a You Now jazz from 200 all right
[00:44:35] cool number
[00:44:37] five Southeast Tennessee so you at you
[00:44:40] at a beach or you just like like beaches

[00:44:57] health pack now your intelligent
[00:44:59] engineer they have a a little laser
[00:45:02] pistol not a lot of damage but that's
[00:45:03] what they use for fighting there but now
[00:45:07] you have a small health pack to start
[00:45:08] your character off
[00:45:10] with
[00:45:13] and ah all right that makes more sense
[00:45:15] last
[00:45:19] name all right

[00:45:23] wandering through this Wasteland and

[00:55:46] up against a big bug got to be careful
[00:55:49] here we don't know what we want to do
[00:55:51] you have a laser pistol and a um and you
[00:55:55] have a house pack now the health pack
[00:55:57] isn't really going to do anything right
[00:55:58] now Justin you got yourself a shattered
[00:56:01] landscape all right not a big one here
[00:56:02] but
[00:56:07] hey yes you got a triumphal art yep you
[00:56:09] got the triumphal art and then we were
[00:56:12] wanding the Wasteland and you
[00:56:13] encountered this
[00:56:19] bug so that was the last thing was the
[00:56:21] Triumph full art actually so that and
[00:56:24] then you have uh you encounter a large
[00:56:26] bug in the Wasteland we're not sure what
[00:56:29] we're going to do against that large
[00:56:31] bug you have the option of attacking it
[00:56:34] with your laser pistol it's not a very
[00:56:36] strong laser pistol or you can flee one
[00:56:40] two three four five or some people have
[00:56:45] tried to uh use some uh some some of
[00:56:47] their like other skills on it try to
[00:56:49] make make it a friend but I don't think
[00:56:50] that's going to happen with this big bad
[00:56:52] guy so it is up to you though you can
[00:56:54] try it
[00:56:57] now this bug is about human size and it
[00:56:59] is a radiated
[00:57:01] bug happen to be unlucky we got one of

[00:57:20] luck today I know you got to go and buy
[00:57:21] a lottery ticket that's all I got to say

[00:57:28] shoot it with our laser
[00:57:32] pistol not a giant
[00:57:37] hit not a giant hit your
[00:57:40] engineer uses their laser pistol shoots
[00:57:43] them only gets six damage to our
[00:57:47] character not good not good we need
[00:57:51] something more because you're 140 health
[00:57:56] and they are an 80 Health bug you only
[00:57:58] did six damage bring them down to 74 and
[00:58:01] they are very mad at you after hitting
[00:58:03] them with a laser pistol they come
[00:58:04] charging towards you and they hit you
[00:58:07] with 15 damage bringing you down to
[00:58:10] 125 for your health what would you like
[00:58:12] to do my
[00:58:15] friend you have a couple more options a
[00:58:18] couple more times to go after this
[00:58:19] before you have to either flee or you're
[00:58:21] dead or the bug flees one or the other
[00:58:26] you do have your health pack to use too
[00:58:29] shoot it
[00:58:31] again you shoot it
[00:58:34] in oh that's a decent hit 10 bring it
[00:58:39] down to 64 Health but it hits you again
[00:58:42] but it's not a big hit on this time it's
[00:58:43] only five bring you down to
[00:58:46] 120 what would you like to do my
[00:58:50] friend Harry What's happen bud

[00:59:42] off did 25 damage to you bring you down
[00:59:45] to 95 Health what are you gonna do my
[00:59:48] friend you have your chance one last
[00:59:49] chance you're either going to shoot it
[00:59:51] go for a kill or it's going to probably
[00:59:53] take over and harm you pretty bad or you
[00:59:55] can run
[00:59:59] it's getting pretty
[01:00:01] angry use the health pack oh good idea
[01:00:03] Health packet brings you back up to 110
[01:00:07] health because that's only a 15 health
[01:00:09] pack being a small
[01:00:10] one all
[01:00:12] right what are we gonna do
[01:00:22] now shoot it one more time all right
[01:00:26] let's
[01:00:31] see you shoot it one more time not a bad
[01:00:37] shot brings it down 20 Health
[01:00:40] again is now at
[01:00:42] 24 but it is very mad it charges you
[01:00:47] knocking you over bringing you down 30
[01:00:50] Health to 80 you are now unconscious on
[01:00:53] the
[01:00:54] ground this isn't good
[01:00:57] you don't really know what's going
[01:00:59] on you wake up all of a sudden in the
[01:01:02] Wasteland shortly you notice that you've
[01:01:05] been robbed your pogs which is our
[01:01:08] Wasteland money by the
[01:01:10] way your pogs have gone missing you know
[01:01:13] love of AR have any Wasteland money your
[01:01:16] laser pistol is now
[01:01:18] missing and you're lucky that you're
[01:01:20] alive with 65 health because he poked
[01:01:23] you a little bit
[01:01:26] but while he poked you he happened to
[01:01:29] drop something out of his
[01:01:32] mandibles that happened to
[01:01:34] be one of these golden envelopes over
[01:01:36] here because whenever you play our games
[01:01:38] you get one of those golden
[01:01:40] envelopes which number do you want it's
[01:01:42] one out of 20 it's just like a little
[01:01:43] free thing literally cards that are
[01:01:45] under a dollar they are um call them
[01:01:48] benjies because of what they in they're
[01:01:50] under a dollar anything like 80s to the
[01:01:53] late 20 middle 2000s TV shows movies
[01:01:56] baseball cards defunk
[01:01:58] games comic books all kinds of stuff
[01:02:02] could win big as well yeah I guess yeah
[01:02:04] you could win big as well if you happen
[01:02:05] to get a one of the card there's some
[01:02:07] cards in these packs that are worth
[01:02:08] money too weirdly number 13 one two
[01:02:10] three four five 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 all
[01:02:15] right here we go well they happen to
[01:02:17] drop something on top of you and in
[01:02:19] those mandals that was dropped on you
[01:02:20] well look at that
[01:02:23] 1992 tops Club Club baseball college

[01:02:59] that I didn't know these could even have
[01:03:00] that many expensive cards in here and
[01:03:02] then somebody's like dude that's an
[01:03:03] expensive one Topo that I'm like what
[01:03:04] then we went looked at it like holy crap
[01:03:07] because I found somebody found a $300 GI

[01:04:51] yeah that would be nice
[01:04:56] I don't know if you like any of those
[01:04:57] but there you
[01:05:01] go yeah do I didn't believe anybody
[01:05:03] until they like like no $300 for a card
[01:05:05] no way like that came out of a dollar
[01:05:08] less than a dollar like these are like
[01:05:09] 5050 cents actually in total all these
[01:05:11] together probably like 50 cents or less
[01:05:14] so it's was just nuts that that came out
[01:05:16] of it but there you go fun little thing
[01:05:19] for you and that's like what we do when
[01:05:21] we play our game you get yourself a

[04:22:35] to be the more expensive shipping 18 if
[04:22:37] it's 18 it will be under the expensive
[04:22:39] shipping TOs and that means it will be
[04:22:41] able to do the uh the the $1 or less
[04:22:43] shipping which just means as you guys
[04:22:45] know and I explain it all the time the

[04:23:12] amount and if somebody bids over it then
[04:23:15] it'll bring it up above it because I

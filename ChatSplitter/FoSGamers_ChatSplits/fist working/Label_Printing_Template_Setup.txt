Here is a template setup that should match your needs for printing 4x6-inch labels with 20 spots in total, organized as two columns with 10 spots per column. This will allow you to enter text into each of the 20 spots and print them directly onto sticky labels on a 4x6 sheet, ready to cut and use.

**Instructions**:
1. Open a word processor like Microsoft Word or Google Docs, or use a spreadsheet software like Excel or Google Sheets for more control over cell dimensions.
2. Set up a 4x6-inch layout with a table containing 2 columns and 10 rows.
3. Each cell will be one label spot where you can enter text.

Here’s how to set it up in Microsoft Word:

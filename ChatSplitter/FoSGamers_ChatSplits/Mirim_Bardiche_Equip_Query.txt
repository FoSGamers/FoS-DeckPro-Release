When using Mirim Bardiche, it creates a 2-2 Red Rebel creature token that it is attached to, and that creature gets 2 plus 2 plus 1 and has Vigilance. There's also the other option of equipping it with using 3-in-1 mana of another color to attach it to another creature you control, and it can only be done as a sorcery. If this has already been used in an attack with another creature that it was already attached to, can it be moved using the Equip option to another one to be equipped again and used to attack?

To clarify your question: you're asking whether **Mirim, Bardiche**, after being used in combat while attached to a creature, can be **re-equipped to a different creature** using its Equip ability and then allow **that new creature to attack in the same turn**.

Here’s the detailed breakdown:

### Mirim, Bardiche's Abilities (based on your summary):
- When it **enters the battlefield**, it **creates a 2/2 red Rebel token** and **auto-attaches** to it.
- The equipped creature gets **+2/+2 and Vigilance**.
- It has an **Equip ability**: you can pay **3 and 1 mana of another color** to move it to another creature **you control**, but **only as a sorcery**.

### Relevant Magic: The Gathering Rules:
1. **Equip is a Sorcery-speed Ability**: You can only activate Equip during your main phase, when the stack is empty, and only if you could cast a sorcery.
2. **Attacking Requirements**:
   - A creature must be **declared as an attacker at the beginning of the combat phase**.
   - A creature that **wasn’t on the battlefield at the start of the turn** or that **didn’t have haste** can’t attack.
   - **Re-equipping** an equipment doesn’t make a creature able to attack again in the same turn if combat has already occurred.

### Answer to Your Question:
**No**, you cannot use Mirim, Bardiche again in the same turn for another attack with a different creature if it was already used in combat that turn.

- Once the combat phase is over and you re-equip it (even if it’s still your turn), it’s **too late to declare attackers again** unless you have a **second combat phase** (granted by another effect, like from *Aggravated Assault* or *Waves of Aggression*).
- Also, if the new creature didn't have **haste** or was just summoned, it wouldn’t be able to attack anyway.

Let me know if you'd like suggestions on how to optimize Bardiche plays in a deck!

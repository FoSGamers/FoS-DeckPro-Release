A 2010 Lagoon 42 catamaran in Europe is typically priced around €434,000 (approximately $485,000). This price can vary based on the boat's condition, equipment, and location. For example, a well-maintained 2019 model listed in Trogir, Croatia, is available for this price range【7†source】.

To bring this boat to the United States and register it, you will need to consider additional costs, including transport, import duties, taxes, and registration fees. Transport costs can range from $10,000 to $20,000 depending on the method (e.g., by sea or by cargo ship). Import duties are typically around 1.5% of the boat's value, and state registration fees vary by location.

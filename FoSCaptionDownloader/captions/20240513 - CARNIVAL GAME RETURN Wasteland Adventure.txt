[00:00:35] and the Suns
[00:00:36] box and the buyer box the ones that we
[00:00:40] had back when we started but it's a
[00:00:42] little bit different on how it's working
[00:00:44] I have to do it a little differently
[00:00:46] just because of how uh the world goes
[00:00:48] now when we have
[00:00:50] complainers complainers about everything
[00:00:53] doe to that we're going to do
[00:00:57] this where
[00:01:00] can't do mystery packs or anything like
[00:01:01] that anymore but we
[00:01:04] can at least uh do it this way where we
[00:01:07] put out some packs or you pick the packs
[00:01:09] that you want to go there start out I'll
[00:01:12] start out what I'll say I'm going to

[00:01:15] 19 for any of the seven ones three of
[00:01:18] the $7 ones we'll start it out at 19 and
[00:01:20] you can bid it up higher if you want to
[00:01:21] go up to any other packs combo of any
[00:01:23] other ones but what we do is we line
[00:01:25] them up here and remember if you do the
[00:01:28] uh the notes there tells you how to use
[00:01:31] them of the chatot command so you want

[00:05:31] so you could go stricks Haven um ra um
[00:05:35] Outlaws of Thunder Junction ioria Los c
[00:05:38] x on draft or even some of the um if you
[00:05:41] really well we can't do ink lands or
[00:05:42] foodborn because it wouldn't work with
[00:05:43] the game but those ones you can go any
[00:05:45] of those three and then uh I mean any of
[00:05:48] those four I think it was that I named
[00:05:49] and then what we do is I have a wheel
[00:05:51] that goes up and we just name we line we
[00:05:53] just put them in one two three top one
[00:05:55] one two three and whichever one goes out
[00:05:57] we make it go out randomly to the Box
[00:05:59] and that's how we set them to the box to
[00:06:01] see what ad is the one that you could
[00:06:02] possibly get the highest Amo value and
[00:06:05] win now now you don't win it yourself we
[00:06:08] take these and we give these and put
[00:06:09] them either up for a $1 auction or it
[00:06:12] goes to the giveaway making the giveaway
[00:06:14] bigger if no one ends up wanting to buy
[00:06:15] it for the $1 auction but you always get
[00:06:18] your packs anyways no matter what so
[00:06:20] stck Haven
[00:06:23] Outlaws and LCI oh I like it I like the
[00:06:27] random I like the randomness strict
[00:06:30] Haven Outlaws and LCI so here we go
[00:06:33] strict shaven Outlaws in LCI so what
[00:06:34] we're going to do I'm just going to do
[00:06:35] like this we'll do this this is one two
[00:06:38] three all right we're going to remove
[00:06:41] our uh uh oh uhoh uh oh uh oh I I had
[00:06:46] the thing back we're going to remove
[00:06:47] that then we're going to put out the
[00:06:49] wheel like I said we were going to do
[00:06:51] show randomizer and we do one two three
[00:06:57] you run the spinner which one's going on
[00:06:59] the
[00:07:02] father well that one was pretty
[00:07:04] straightforward
[00:07:06] one attach remove we're running the
[00:07:08] spinner
[00:07:09] again which one's going to
[00:07:11] Sun number three is going to Sun so
[00:07:14] Sun's one has Outlaws then we have the
[00:07:16] last one going to L Caverns it's pretty
[00:07:19] straightforward and easy
[00:07:20] there aha so now what we do is we open
[00:07:24] these packs to see what and then we see
[00:07:26] which one has the highest mono value
[00:07:30] why did it just do that again I hit hide
[00:07:33] randomizer there we go now we open these
[00:07:36] up and I generally start with the one on
[00:07:37] the father's box because we want to see
[00:07:39] that's the one we always want to beat
[00:07:41] that way we can get the uh because you

[00:09:40] three four five six and seven because we
[00:09:44] like our spoilers at the end not the
[00:09:46] beginning and no one's ever complained
[00:09:47] about me doing that nice little r card
[00:09:50] there all right good luck rise of the

[00:10:42] high so that oh we got a tie so far uh

[00:13:41] crazy I actually used a few of your uh
[00:13:43] few of your videos if you didn't
[00:13:48] notice why does it keep playing music
[00:13:50] like this I never listen to this music I
[00:13:52] always skip over it I wish there was
[00:13:55] like can can somebody like anybody here
[00:13:57] work for uh Spotify that they can tell
[00:14:00] them hey can you put like a down vote
[00:14:02] because I would very much like
[00:14:07] that that way you know I don't like a
[00:14:10] song and you can stop trying to play
[00:14:13] [Laughter]
[00:14:16] it well see the funny thing is so um my
[00:14:20] uh my nephew uh the other day was on the
[00:14:23] show with us he decided he uh he he they
[00:14:25] were here on Monday and they um they
[00:14:28] were luckily he's like hey can we do a
[00:14:30] show and I was like I don't know I was I
[00:14:31] was planning on canceling it just
[00:14:33] because you know you all my you know
[00:14:35] family was here like no no I really want
[00:14:36] it I'm like their parents like yeah it's
[00:14:38] fine whatever he wants to do it he'll
[00:14:40] he'll be Wicked excited about it I'm
[00:14:41] like all right fine whatever so I like
[00:14:43] we did the show and
[00:14:46] um then the a new subscriber and all a
[00:14:49] sudden go and comments I'm like wait a
[00:14:50] minute this can't be the same person
[00:14:52] that doesn't that's not that's not him
[00:14:54] and I look and I like this person's been
[00:14:56] here for 11 years that's older like as
[00:14:57] old as my nephew older than my nephew
[00:15:00] now this is impossible for him to be
[00:15:02] that him him like thinking for a minute
[00:15:03] who the hell is enforcer oh oh now I
[00:15:07] know who it
[00:15:08] is took me a
[00:15:10] minute I'm sitting there like who is
[00:15:12] this
[00:15:14] person but anyways it took me a minute I
[00:15:17] figured it out and I'm like ah aha I
[00:15:21] should have picked it out right away
[00:15:22] with the name and all but it was like
[00:15:24] The Coincidence of everything going
[00:15:25] together at the same time this is going
[00:15:27] to get you one have strength on your
[00:15:29] adventure not bad for those pack deals
[00:15:31] there but remember guys you can actually
[00:15:34] tell me what packs you want to put
[00:15:36] together here you don't need to uh you
[00:15:38] don't need me to uh pick them for you
[00:15:41] that's why I have the uh little menu at
[00:15:43] the top there men you at the top there
[00:15:46] tells you all the cards we have that's
[00:15:48] the prices if you get them as an
[00:15:49] individual so say you just wanted to go
[00:15:50] hey give me
[00:15:51] one that's what it would be but if you
[00:15:54] want to go with
[00:15:55] multiple then uh you actually get a
[00:15:57] discount so if you go with two or three
[00:15:59] the more you get the more discount you
[00:16:01] get because it helps me with whatnot
[00:16:02] fees so I pass those discounts on to you
[00:16:05] from those fees because I don't take
[00:16:07] those fees I feel like that's
[00:16:09] inappropriate so I pass that discount on
[00:16:11] to you guys I do not have the same luck
[00:16:14] as yesterday I opened up a great hinge
[00:16:15] out of that box so I have a feeling I'm
[00:16:17] not going to find a lot of big stuff out
[00:16:18] of there anymore so we'll see what
[00:16:22] happens we'll see what happens with the
[00:16:24] rest of that box I feel like maybe it's
[00:16:26] got one good card left in that one for
[00:16:28] me then maybe uh that's it we're GNA do

[00:26:25] choices you can be a a
[00:26:29] technician a detective a mutant or a
[00:26:33] strong human and as you wander through
[00:26:35] the Wasteland you pick items up that
[00:26:38] could help you along the way to meet
[00:26:40] your boss at the
[00:26:42] end I do not have any mystery packs left
[00:26:46] I actually had to order more um I I
[00:26:49] thought I had another box but uh I guess

[00:26:55] G have to order more today
[00:27:02] mutant and random all random all right
[00:27:05] perfect we like all random we are
[00:27:07] wandering through the Wasteland and this
[00:27:10] mutant goes and he picks up things and
[00:27:12] he drops them as he's going through the
[00:27:14] wayand he goes um what is this thing
[00:27:15] here we have picked this up and we find
[00:27:20] a food we like food the mut goes this is
[00:27:23] gelatin like I like this tastes kind of
[00:27:25] like my boogers yum 1 two three strength
[00:27:30] now as he wanders through the Wasteland
[00:27:33] looking for more

[00:27:37] them along the way a friend who knows
[00:27:40] we'll find our way we're G oh you know
[00:27:42] kind of open right here for us so we're
[00:27:44] going to go with this one all right
[00:27:46] let's see what we find in this Wasteland
[00:27:48] Adventure we come across a power Stone I
[00:27:52] think actually give me one
[00:27:54] second there's so many other things I
[00:27:57] think a power
[00:28:03] Stone does not do
[00:28:05] anything because I forgot to put it on
[00:28:07] the
[00:28:08] list hold on mutant is Power Stone on
[00:28:12] here harm it does harm you I'm sorry
[00:28:16] Power Stone this mutant comes around and
[00:28:18] goes looking into this thing looking
[00:28:19] into a light and goes oh what is this
[00:28:21] gets a
[00:28:22] shock spits his food out goes running
[00:28:25] away and goes ah one two strength you
[00:28:29] have now as you wander through the
[00:28:31] Wasteland not too bad for your strength
[00:28:33] though that's okay maybe you'll find a
[00:28:35] friend an item a friend along the way
[00:28:38] that'll help you in this trip through
[00:28:40] the Wasteland we have one 12 potential
[00:28:44] friends and you told me to go with
[00:28:46] random on all of them and you know what
[00:28:47] that one popped out a little bit telling
[00:28:49] us that's what we're going with all
[00:28:51] right Mystic here's our random one do we
[00:28:53] find a friend in this Wasteland oh no no
[00:28:56] no we do not thought mutant kind a
[00:28:58] detective detective tricks him mutant
[00:29:01] trips over himself breaks his leg now
[00:29:04] he's down to one strength as he wanders
[00:29:06] through the Wasteland and that is I'm
[00:29:07] sorry we do not have any luck for that
[00:29:10] but you know what maybe we will not get
[00:29:12] trampled by the boss maybe we will get
[00:29:14] some good luck and maybe we'll just
[00:29:16] bounce off and they'll give us a little
[00:29:17] poke and run away let's see what happens
[00:29:19] here there are 10 potential bosses out
[00:29:23] of them you could potentially beat five
[00:29:26] if you had the right pack in the right
[00:29:28] amount of Point strength but let's see
[00:29:29] what happens here you're going with a
[00:29:32] velociraptor oh no the Velociraptor
[00:29:34] comes along nibbles on your broken leg
[00:29:37] you happen to get away with one leg but
[00:29:39] you know what that's okay you start to
[00:29:42] wander back and you see a vault in the
[00:29:45] distance you crawl into that Vault and
[00:29:47] you pick something out and you go you
[00:29:50] said random for everything so this is
[00:29:52] our if you lose you get this here and
[00:29:55] we're going to go with this is what you

[00:50:36] many people like him for their own
[00:50:38] reasons and whatever but my reason for

[00:50:44] to get to where he was and I had to do
[00:50:46] the same thing and I liked that uh and
[00:50:48] that's one of the biggest reasons why I
[00:50:50] liked him you know he always had a work
[00:50:53] ethic that I I agreed with here we go

[01:00:35] giant not a big hit but two nice little
[01:00:38] hits there and they uh kind of go right
[01:00:40] side by side so somebody was planning
[01:00:41] this pack out I feel feel like somebody
[01:00:43] planned that pack and uh Michael I do
[01:00:47] this for shipping everybody's been okay
[01:00:49] with it if you are not that is fine but
[01:00:51] I do this so that when I put it in a top
[01:00:53] loader it keeps it it um it keeps it
[01:00:56] nice and uh snug so they don't fall out
[01:00:59] so uh just let me know if you um if
[01:01:02] you're not okay with that I I'll do
[01:01:03] something different fine with you all
[01:01:05] right yeah because I noticed that um
[01:01:07] when I do that the top loaders they um
[01:01:10] if I do one sometimes they can fall out
[01:01:12] in shipping but if I do two of them like
[01:01:14] that they get snug in here and they
[01:01:15] don't really fall out which is
[01:01:18] nice but sometimes they don't always fit
[01:01:21] well and you have to give it a little
[01:01:23] extra there we
[01:01:26] go and they stick at the bottom there
[01:01:29] and then they no longer come out now get
[01:01:31] all your stuff together Michael Jordan
[01:01:33] and ship out your
[01:01:36] stuff can you put the three for 19 on
[01:01:41] the pack pole box in the bin please can

[01:27:53] cheing I can keep it all right some
[01:27:55] people like the signed ones that's the
[01:27:56] only reason I asked V vazi inspector I
[01:28:00] don't know if I'm saying that right

[01:29:02] Humanity oh Escape is a power creep
[01:29:04] evolving wild all right that's what it
[01:29:06] is so you still have void Becker as the
[01:29:09] one to beat here but dungeons you get
[01:29:12] dragons especially when you get
[01:29:14] collector boosters there's a good chance

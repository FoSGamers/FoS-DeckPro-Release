[00:04:39] I
[00:04:40] did I didn't uh get a chance to look at
[00:04:43] all of them but I did find
[00:04:45] one uh where did I put it hold on a
[00:04:54] [Music]
[00:04:56] second cuz I found one where did I
[00:04:59] [ __ ] put that there's a Nissa Plaines
[00:05:02] Walker I have a quorus
[00:05:05] con um I um also had a few other like
[00:05:10] one other planes Walker but like I have
[00:05:13] this quorus KH and I have a Nissa
[00:05:16] somewhere I didn't I put the Nissa down
[00:05:18] because I was looking through my um my
[00:05:23] uh do my stuff that I
[00:05:26] have and I found that I swear I had
[00:05:29] another one oh that's the other quorus
[00:05:31] con that I
[00:05:33] [Music]
[00:05:35] had quorus
[00:05:37] con thought I had gorus
[00:05:40] con uh but I have aissa somewhere I have
[00:05:43] to look at I have to find where it is
[00:05:45] but that was the only other one that I
[00:05:46] had that I ended up having there um I
[00:05:50] don't have a ton of planes well
[00:05:53] actually I wonder if I have any of my
[00:05:55] other
[00:05:56] things I never thought I didn't think to
[00:05:58] looking those ones
[00:06:00] hold on a
[00:06:08] second hold on a second I completely
[00:06:11] forgot I have a bunch of Commander
[00:06:12] Masters stuff and I think there's some
[00:06:13] planes walkers in
[00:06:15] there I didn't think about those I
[00:06:18] forgot about
[00:06:20] those because it's not in my normal
[00:06:22] stuff that I have out to sell but I have
[00:06:25] Nissa and these two quorus con that I
[00:06:27] definitely do have
[00:06:30] um so for Nissa do you want both of them
[00:06:34] I mean do you want the both quorus
[00:06:38] cons or just
[00:06:43] one both of them all right uh give me
[00:06:45] one
[00:06:58] second
[00:07:07] I think
[00:07:16] [Music]
[00:07:28] um
[00:07:55] say 16 for the two of them
[00:08:05] got to get the deals
[00:08:07] brother good all
[00:08:10] right I think I can do that and I'll try
[00:08:13] to find I'll look through um I didn't
[00:08:15] think to look through the commander
[00:08:16] Masters yesterday I don't know why when
[00:08:18] I was looking through this stuff I was
[00:08:20] like oh I have bees and then Nissa just
[00:08:23] [ __ ] heads out literally had that one
[00:08:26] out here earlier like oh I have this for
[00:08:28] look it's
[00:08:31] here what the hell did I do with
[00:08:34] it sometimes I'm so damn
[00:08:40] stupid all right let me get those up
[00:08:42] there for
[00:08:44] 16 for you I'll get those out there for
[00:08:47] 16 for you
[00:08:52] anyways yes the new Commander master um
[00:08:56] I have a box of that stuff if you you
[00:08:59] want um I can look through that and
[00:09:03] um let you know what I have because I
[00:09:06] completely blanked on
[00:09:08] that um before I put these up for
[00:09:12] you let me do this I'm G to run um on
[00:09:16] this right now while we're
[00:09:20] waiting yeah let me um let me look
[00:09:22] through that for a few here see what I
[00:09:28] have
[00:09:30] wrong
[00:09:31] box you know what um I might end up
[00:09:34] doing that after the show because we do
[00:09:36] have a few people in here right
[00:09:39] now um I can do that after the show
[00:09:42] because I do have the day
[00:09:44] off the reason why I say about the
[00:09:46] commander Masters is because I realized
[00:09:47] I'm like oh wow I have the commander
[00:09:48] Masters Plaines Walker deck that I play
[00:09:51] um and I'm like I I remember actually
[00:09:52] getting duplicates of those cards in
[00:09:55] Commander Masters and that's why I was
[00:09:56] like [ __ ] that's why I was like it just
[00:09:59] dawned on me because I looked and I'm
[00:10:00] like oh I'm going to play cards later
[00:10:02] like oh there's the [ __ ] the commander
[00:10:04] Masters Plaines Walker deck and it just
[00:10:05] like hit me it's one of those things
[00:10:07] that like you don't even think about and
[00:10:08] then all of a sudden it comes out and
[00:10:09] hits
[00:10:10] you hey King how you doing today so what
[00:10:14] I'm gonna do is I'll look through that
[00:10:15] later in a little while for you um
[00:10:18] before I head out to go play cards this
[00:10:20] afternoon and I'll send you a message
[00:10:22] with everything that I have um and what
[00:10:24] I can do is I'll throw on like a buy now
[00:10:26] deal um and I'll just name it like uh
[00:10:29] blunt man's Plaines Walkers or something
[00:10:31] with a picture of them and um I'll let
[00:10:35] you do like the byy now thing how's that
[00:10:38] sound sound like a good way to handle
[00:10:40] that because I completely forgot about
[00:10:42] having Commander Master's Plaines Walker
[00:10:44] deck it's one of those things I just
[00:10:45] like right over the
[00:10:48] head yeah all right I'll do that I
[00:10:51] completely forgot I had that deck to
[00:10:54] think about that I had all the duplicate
[00:10:56] of the other cards when I remember
[00:10:57] little going through going oh cool I got
[00:10:58] oh wait I already have this oh cool oh
[00:11:00] wait I already have this you
[00:11:02] know one of those like yeah odd things
[00:11:04] we don't think right hey let's do this
[00:11:06] though for those that are hanging out
[00:11:08] right now I'm going to throw these up
[00:11:10] I'm G to put these off to the side for
[00:11:11] you though since you did like those come
[00:11:14] on
[00:11:15] man um and it's that way that we have
[00:11:19] them for later for you when you're for
[00:11:20] the rest of the planes Walker that I
[00:11:22] find I'll send you what I got and then
[00:11:24] you can let me know whatever you want
[00:11:25] and like I said I'll take a picture and
[00:11:27] I'll I'll put it up here

[00:11:34] party deck sadly I do not have another
[00:11:37] Plaines Walker party deck

[00:11:43] more of those whole deck um sets like
[00:11:48] the four of them and if I do um I might
[00:11:50] be able to grab one and see if I can get

[00:11:53] you just give me
[00:11:56] mine you know if I didn't play it i'

[00:20:50] last
[00:20:54] pack I knew nothing huge had been pulled
[00:20:57] out still like I I have a problem with
[00:21:00] some of these
[00:21:01] uh Lord of the Rings boxes here you
[00:21:04] don't get anything huge we had one good
[00:21:07] poster and then we had a packed negation
[00:21:11] and a few other cars that are like
[00:21:13] similar value of this but this is a nice
[00:21:14] hit though pack negation counter Target
[00:21:17] spell costs nothing it's awesome one
[00:21:20] that is an awesome
[00:21:24] card we get your name written down on
[00:21:27] that
[00:21:31] [Laughter]
[00:21:36] I kind of like the way you said
[00:21:39] that the cards are so good though like
[00:21:42] when you get the good cards they're
[00:21:44] awesome that's the only problem with
[00:21:48] it I feel like they definitely with the
[00:21:50] um with this one with the Lord of the
[00:21:53] Rings they definitely did the
[00:21:56] uh this is the the chase stuff
[00:21:59] especially with the L with the that one
[00:22:00] ring card but Darth Smith has came out
[00:22:02] on top here with a nice packed
[00:22:05] negation that a nice hit definitely a
[00:22:08] nice hit for those
[00:22:09] packs beautiful thank you thank you
[00:22:13] Darth Gandalf is pretty M fun yeah thank
[00:22:17] you Darth that was a nice hit that
[00:22:18] packed to negation
[00:22:20] foil oh I like it I like it a lot all
[00:22:24] right so we're out of lore of the Rings
[00:22:26] at the moment I'll get like I said I'll
[00:22:27] have some more of that later today let
[00:22:30] me see and I'm actually going to have
[00:22:31] some more I'm actually out of all my
[00:22:33] collector boosters at the moment except
[00:22:35] for what you see on screen here well
[00:22:37] ain't that
[00:22:40] interesting all righty hey Darth those
[00:22:43] are some good
[00:22:45] hits we like dude that pack I'm jealous
[00:22:47] of the
[00:22:49] pack because it's a beautiful pack
[00:22:52] negation I like it a lot
[00:22:56] there
[00:23:00] I did open collectors of Commander
[00:23:01] Masters and do you know what I have
[00:23:02] coming I actually have a couple of boxes
[00:23:05] of collector boosters of Commander
[00:23:06] Masters coming if anybody's
[00:23:10] interested but I did open some Commander
[00:23:13] Masters um I actually have a chunk of
[00:23:15] those somewhere I just don't know what
[00:23:17] what box out
[00:23:19] of
[00:23:21] 24 um has Commander Masters in it
[00:23:23] because I didn't label any of the boxes
[00:23:25] and I just realized it's probably a good
[00:23:27] idea I should probably go and label
[00:23:28] those boxes somehow so I know what's in
[00:23:30] what so I don't have to dig into each
[00:23:32] one every time and look at
[00:23:34] [Laughter]
[00:23:35] them which is the reason why I told you
[00:23:38] it's G to take me a little bit to figure
[00:23:40] out which uh to figure out what uh where
[00:23:44] the planes Walkers
[00:23:47] are looking for the texture foil cards
[00:23:49] as well all right I don't know if I had
[00:23:51] any of those yeah the uh The Collector
[00:23:53] boosters suck but I got a couple of good
[00:23:55] ones I had I had a couple of good
[00:23:57] collector boosters so you know I was
[00:23:59] like you I I figured try it again see
[00:24:01] what happens they're a little they're a
[00:24:03] lot cheaper than I initially bought them
[00:24:05] so that's literally the reason why so I
[00:24:07] bought them when they were like 200
[00:24:09] something so that's Al also part of the
[00:24:11] reason
[00:24:13] why I think that's also part of the
[00:24:15] reason why a lot of people don't like
[00:24:16] Commander
[00:24:20] Masters yes I remember you said that and
[00:24:23] then you open up we did one of the
[00:24:24] drafts and we opened up one of them
[00:24:26] too
[00:24:34] I'm G to throw singles on here
[00:24:46] next yeah that was funny I remember that
[00:24:48] like oh I got every smothering tide you
[00:24:50] could get I'm like oh well we'll see
[00:24:52] what we get here and then boom TI like
[00:24:53] well still looks a good card just you
[00:24:56] know you got every one of them already
[00:24:58] so it's one of
[00:25:06] those all righty so we're going to throw
[00:25:08] these singles on here because some
[00:25:09] people do like singles each one of
[00:25:17] these or
[00:25:19] $6 but we have K9 Mark 1 surge foil

[00:25:53] because it's not shut if you if you have

[01:04:26] Year Daddy
[01:04:28] I tell us
[01:04:32] in the comments the
[01:04:34] chat or the comments all right I think

[01:04:42] of long kind of long but clean on the

[01:15:51] y all right this is the pack deal that I
[01:15:54] was pulling on putting on
[01:15:57] here this is the pack deal I was going
[01:15:59] to put on here let's see if anybody else
[01:16:01] wants this pack deal it's going to be
[01:16:08] [Music]
[01:16:12] 36 36 of those on screen oh I keep
[01:16:15] forgetting to put final I keep
[01:16:17] forgetting to put um sudden death
[01:16:21] on what's sudden death so that they
[01:16:23] don't have a bid keep going up and I
[01:16:24] always forget to put it on I like having
[01:16:26] s in death personally it's one of my I
[01:16:29] like to do that because it's like I know
[01:16:30] this is a price I'm good at and if
[01:16:32] somebody wants to bid up because they
[01:16:33] think they're going to be lucky then
[01:16:35] they can do that but I put sudden death
[01:16:37] on because it's like it's a price I'm
[01:16:38] acceptable I will accept that price at
[01:16:41] so that's why I like to do it that way
[01:16:43] and I always forget and it should be
[01:16:45] like an automatic thing I wish they
[01:16:46] would allow you to be like every single
[01:16:48] one is automatically set to sudden death
[01:16:50] unless I change it that would be nice
[01:16:53] that would be very nice Lil DJ is gonna
[01:16:56] try it
[01:16:57] again get that alith that gives you all
[01:16:59] your creatures flying and plus yeah that
[01:17:01] would be nice if you pull that alith out
[01:17:03] in in a game to put that
[01:17:05] on all right little
[01:17:07] dj GNA try that luck
[01:17:10] again can I open up uh well hold on hold
[01:17:15] on no well you can add it's up to L
[01:17:18] DJ what they what L DJ wants but he's
[01:17:21] there's two on the left and one two
[01:17:25] three on the right can we call you
[01:17:30] DJ yeah can I also pull
[01:17:33] collec hold on bud wait we'll wait he'll
[01:17:36] tell us where to
[01:17:38] go you got to even the box out all right
[01:17:41] pick one from the right
[01:17:42] side hold on should we hit we'll pit I
[01:17:47] don't know if he wants to tell me where
[01:17:48] to go or if he wants somebody to one of
[01:17:50] us to get a random one for him let him
[01:17:52] pick a a random all right pick one on a
[01:17:54] random one on the right side
[01:17:56] buddy feel the good one on the right
[01:17:59] side that one that's a good one on the
[01:18:01] right side he's saying all right
[01:18:04] DJ so yes so there's a there's a thing
[01:18:07] with um with uh whatnot where they don't
[01:18:10] want me to allow children to open packs
[01:18:14] so
[01:18:16] somebody will will thinks it's stupid it
[01:18:20] makes sense to me a little bit because
[01:18:22] they want to make sure that they don't
[01:18:23] harm or ruin anything so little dj we're
[01:18:25] going to see what we got here and but
[01:18:27] one of the things is though is um since

[01:26:47] on my fourth pull-up that the mirror was
[01:26:49] going to fall over as I was coming down
[01:26:52] so as I'm coming down for my fourth

[01:44:04] can tighten it up to make it stronger so
[01:44:05] you can get on stronger but then you use
[01:44:07] a camera of your phone and he gets to
[01:44:10] walk around my house and it acts like he
[01:44:13] he has to hunt and be quiet to walk
[01:44:15] around the house and get to animals and
[01:44:17] be able to hunt them
[01:44:19] down
[01:44:21] dude yeah I know we got my my wife found
[01:44:24] it on sale for Christmas they're
[01:44:26] normally like
[01:44:27] $180 and she found it for $100 on the
[01:44:30] manufacturer's
[01:44:33] website yeah and they and they didn't
[01:44:36] have it available um to get in time so

[01:45:43] your regular uh like a regular Target so
[01:45:45] you're not moving around and you can
[01:45:47] just practice your aim and what it does
[01:45:49] is you tighten it up and loosen it to
[01:45:51] help strengthen your arm so it does it
[01:45:53] tightens the resistance too so it can
[01:45:55] make the resistance more so it helps
[01:45:57] strengthen his arm so he can hold the
[01:45:59] bow up one for the strength and also to
[01:46:01] pull it back so he can shoot better and
[01:46:03] stronger and further and I mean I myself

[02:03:52] all right so we should all be able to
[02:03:53] see this going to angle the camera a
[02:03:55] little bit better so we can see all
[02:03:57] right this is where we're going to be
[02:03:58] here let me know you said you like it so
[02:04:00] I'm not going to move any of these
[02:04:05] um yes I will have more Exxon tomorrow I
[02:04:09] actually have it today um this afternoon
[02:04:11] so if I'm lucky enough to get it while
[02:04:12] I'm still streaming here that it shows
[02:04:14] up I'll throw some in here but if not um
[02:04:18] yes I will have later today for

[02:04:29] for the Sun a modern Horizon 2 draft for
[02:04:33] the
[02:04:34] buyer and a modern Horizon 2 draft for
[02:04:37] the father
[02:04:40] now do you want to keep the two modern
[02:04:43] Horizon 2 drafts those are pretty good
[02:04:44] picks there but sometimes people like to
[02:04:46] switch them out that's all I the reason
[02:04:48] I like to say that's pretty good picks
[02:04:49] though modern Horizon 2
[02:04:52] drafts two drafts of modern Horizon 2
[02:04:56] and a fxia all will be one full send all
[02:05:00] right fxia there and there now because
[02:05:03] there are two drafts would you like me
[02:05:05] to flip these drafts around or would you
[02:05:06] like me to leave them where they
[02:05:12] are looks good all righty so we're going
[02:05:15] to open like we normally do we do the
[02:05:17] father first to see if where you have to
[02:05:21] go who what you have to beat so that's
[02:05:23] what we're going to do like we always do
[02:05:25] going to do the father first to
[02:05:27] see what you have to beat
[02:05:33] here come on come on this means it's a
[02:05:37] good pack when it's hard to open at

[02:11:46] hits there those are two nice hits right
[02:11:51] there thank you
[02:11:54] HLN we appreciate that we appreciate
[02:11:57] that that was fun we like playing that
[02:11:58] game the kids love playing that game too
[02:12:01] because they get to uh
[02:12:03] participate and um depending on the
[02:12:06] where we're doing streams they actually
[02:12:07] get to do even more participation which
[02:12:10] I found out is kind of
[02:12:11] cool cuz some of them we get to uh they
[02:12:14] get to participate a little bit more and
[02:12:16] do some uh do some pulling their own or
[02:12:20] crack pack Kracken of their own
[02:12:22] HLN nice job
[02:12:25] there we got to um one of the cool
[02:12:28] things is somebody made a comment the
[02:12:29] other day that if you guys want now I
[02:12:31] think I found a way around the eye have
[02:12:34] to open the pack thing that the adult
[02:12:36] has to open the pack I can cut the top
[02:12:38] of the pack open and the kids can pull
[02:12:40] it out and read the cards to see if they
[02:12:42] pull out good cards for luck for you if
[02:12:45] you want to do that from now on CU we uh
[02:12:47] I think that's a workaround for the
[02:12:52] um that they can't open the pack that it
[02:12:55] has to be an adult that does it what do
[02:12:57] you guys think you think that's a
[02:12:58] workaround for it
[02:13:03] HLN wouldn't bother me if it's how you
[02:13:06] did it all right cool yeah because like
[02:13:09] um like the point I think they the
[02:13:11] reason why I makes a little bit of sense
[02:13:12] to me they don't want the kids ruining
[02:13:13] cards when they open a pack that kind of
[02:13:15] makes sense to me so I was like all
[02:13:17] right that sense we won't do that uh but
[02:13:20] I was like there's got to be something
[02:13:21] way for them that's why we did the pole
[02:13:23] boxes so they can be participating a
[02:13:24] little
[02:13:28] bit all right we're going to throw up a
[02:13:32] auction
[02:13:34] here for
[02:13:37] um we're g to do this
[02:13:41] quickly we're going to do that quickly
[02:13:43] while I figure out um where I'm going
[02:13:46] for singles next and then I'll get a
[02:13:48] pack deals
[02:13:53] up yeah cuz I thought it was cool when
[02:13:56] we cut the top of the pack open and they
[02:13:58] were able to open it because no one went
[02:13:59] through it and was like reading it and
[02:14:01] was like oh you got this oh you got
[02:14:04] [Music]
[02:14:09] that let me throw the low ones
[02:14:15] on let me throw the low ones on I'll do

[02:27:13] all it is is taxes is a way for the
[02:27:15] government to steal money from everyone

[00:11:46] bit
[00:11:48] out into uh the Wasteland Direction here
[00:11:51] this map maybe I should take our buddies
[00:11:53] that we've had made along friends along

[00:11:59] but maybe we want to try and find our
[00:12:01] other friend hold on ah yes you figured
[00:12:03] it out let me find I think it was yeps
[00:12:06] or it was uh

[00:12:29] Mythic is the one with the fragment of
[00:12:30] the
[00:12:33] map oh not a problem I just was grabbed
[00:12:36] your card out and and showed it to you

[00:13:10] potentially two more pieces missing but
[00:13:12] definitely at least one good siiz piece
[00:13:15] missing we were hoping Mythic was

[00:17:36] we're going to put there now it seems
[00:17:37] like we don't like this too much today
[00:17:38] so what we can do is uh I can switch it
[00:17:40] up potentially and do this let's
[00:17:44] see de down all right we like it I like
[00:17:47] it we're
[00:17:51] down let's see what do we want to
[00:17:56] change um we'll go
[00:18:01] with let's Chey see what we can change
[00:18:03] it to
[00:18:33] what the heck is going on there
[00:18:39] oh thought I made those
[00:18:44] show let's do this
[00:19:02] [Music]
[00:19:10] oh no worries about it Halloween I
[00:19:20] understand yes I get that I get that big
[00:19:23] I get that
[00:19:24] big I understand that
[00:19:28] hey that's one of I had kept doing that
[00:19:30] for quite some time and I decided
[00:19:32] instead of paying a mortgage we were
[00:19:33] going to uh have a a live on a boat
[00:19:36] where we have no bills to pay other than
[00:19:38] uh making sure we're surviving on the
[00:19:41] boat so we have uh the mortgage and all
[00:19:43] that stuff it's
[00:19:48] gone took all of our money and moved on
[00:19:56] here was it smart I don't know well find
[00:20:00] out yes three kids is yeah I understand
[00:20:03] that
[00:20:06] Halloween how long did it take Ralph
[00:20:09] well uh it is an adventure might as well
[00:20:12] go on one right for me it took quite
[00:20:14] some time I mean me I'm 40 so about I
[00:20:17] turned 40 and that's when I got on to it

[00:24:24] pretty much everything you can there now
[00:24:27] you head out and your buddy um do you
[00:24:30] need to go over to big big BK because

[00:24:59] just my mouse is not dying it's just
[00:25:01] acting like uh

[00:25:19] today ah
[00:25:21] yes well you have uh your hole in the
[00:25:25] wall the guy that's crazy locked room

[00:25:29] storage
[00:25:31] vendor is uh an insane dude that tries
[00:25:34] pretty much anything he he likes
[00:25:36] experimenting with
[00:25:40] things got lots of chemicals and he
[00:25:42] always tries to make new new uh weapon
[00:25:46] items so you have some choices on those

[00:42:11] big so uh Suge looks at spicy here so
[00:42:14] he's spicy wandering uh behind our buddy
[00:42:19] here spicy wanders in behind big
[00:42:22] BK in Halloween and Suge looks at him
[00:42:26] hey bud
[00:42:27] ah spicy like I'm not happy with
[00:42:30] you ah no worries buddy
[00:42:36] Halloween do you have any guns to sell
[00:42:38] let me
[00:42:44] see no I think you don't cuz you had
[00:42:46] given one the assault rifle over to
[00:42:48] somebody to help him and I think that's
[00:42:51] what you have left there because you
[00:42:54] took the uh the alien sniper rifle
[00:42:58] instead that's
[00:43:02] why so you sell the mystery
[00:43:05] chips and you get 40 pogs you're at 150
[00:43:10] on your pogs look at that he hands you
[00:43:14] uh four Slammers goes here as you go
[00:43:17] which is the pogs our Wasteland currency
[00:43:20] Slammers are 10 suar Steve says good
[00:43:22] deal my friend he goes out back quickly
[00:43:26] goes shoo kicks you eyes all out of the
[00:43:29] room sees uh it was a good good good
[00:43:32] trick for him to get uh get out get a
[00:43:34] spicy out because he's like ow
[00:43:37] out spicy you are close to it on a
[00:43:43] giggity I
[00:43:45] think you have uh three of it I think
[00:43:50] you have three
[00:43:59] Oh I thought he took both of them I
[00:44:01] thought he took the plasma rifle and the
[00:44:03] assault rifle that was my bad
[00:44:07] ah I'm sorry my misunderstanding there I
[00:44:11] thought you gave him the assault rifle
[00:44:13] and he got the plasma rifle too I'm
[00:44:14] sorry if I misunderstood that during the
[00:44:16] chat well you can keep the ammo you just
[00:44:19] needed you get you gave him that and the
[00:44:21] I thought it was his name was giving him
[00:44:22] ammo if I remember right maybe I was
[00:44:24] wrong on that
[00:44:27] so I know uh I think yeps and Mythic had
[00:44:30] a bunch of ammo so that's why they gave
[00:44:33] it over if I remember
[00:44:36] correctly but I might be wrong
[00:44:39] there oh no my brain is not working well

[00:45:14] you with the AR there if you really and
[00:45:16] then uh we'll have that so you can
[00:45:19] trade
[00:45:21] but if that's really needed I I may have
[00:45:23] misunderstood too so either
[00:45:25] way sugar Steve wanders away though he
[00:45:28] kicks you guys all out he saw he saw
[00:45:30] spicy wander in and uh spicy uh scared
[00:45:34] him a little bit cuz spicy was like
[00:45:37] yo my
[00:45:42] canister I'll be sold for more ammo well
[00:45:44] there you
[00:45:45] go hey um my buddy Nico you want to help
[00:45:50] describe what you look like here for uh
[00:45:52] for our game or should we uh just kind
[00:45:53] of generate you based off of your name
[00:45:57] and uh what you
[00:46:03] carry cuz you you're a long-standing
[00:46:05] character here so we might as well get
[00:46:07] you uh get you an image too like the
[00:46:09] rest of
[00:46:10] everyone all right well anyways we are
[00:46:15] hanging out
[00:46:16] here oh no why is a mouse doing that
[00:46:20] it's being
[00:46:21] silly all right and you guys decide uh
[00:46:24] you have your map there that you had
[00:46:25] pulled all together some of the pieces
[00:46:28] now you guys are going to still wander
[00:46:29] around you kind of you you went through
[00:46:31] all of uh the area here there's not
[00:46:32] really much left you cleaned it all out
[00:46:34] you got your ammo and stuff like that so
[00:46:37] you decide to wander back to the city
[00:46:38] the portal closed up when the when the
[00:46:40] robot was destroyed and you don't have
[00:46:42] no way to get back up to that
[00:46:44] uh that uh location there
[00:46:51] so let me put this in I thought I had
[00:46:53] put alien sniper rifle in here I did put
[00:46:56] it in in there I did I did Big BK also
[00:47:00] has the alien sniper
[00:47:01] rifle no that's not it that's the alien
[00:47:07] sniper I thought I put it in
[00:47:10] here maybe I didn't I'll have to add
[00:47:23] it alien sniper rifle there we go you
[00:47:25] got that too you got to remember
[00:47:30] that you think you you know think well I
[00:47:33] mean you can if you head on out you can
[00:47:35] uh leave a you can leave a trail for
[00:47:37] them you know and let them know where
[00:47:38] you're going but it's probably a good
[00:47:40] idea to wait for them try to Ping them
[00:47:41] and see if they they can come along for
[00:47:43] the adventure and go with you guys as
[00:47:44] you wander out I mean you never know
[00:47:46] what you're going to end up seeing there
[00:47:48] could be something ridiculously awesome
[00:47:50] could be something you're oh my God I
[00:47:52] can't
[00:47:53] believe can't believe that's going on

[00:58:43] somebody gave you a weapon well if
[00:58:44] somebody does they
[00:58:47] can yeah that's what I thought you did
[00:58:49] but maybe you gave that to uh
[00:58:53] squid maybe that's what it was giving it

[00:59:05] squid yeah
[00:59:08] well you hit one and kill one off now
[00:59:12] you
[00:59:15] uh let's
[00:59:18] see you get all right so it must have

[00:59:23] sword then Halloween must have got the
[00:59:24] sword yesterday
[00:59:29] so Halloween that means you have a sword
[00:59:31] with plus five every time you roll for
[00:59:35] so to get a better chance of hitting all
[00:59:37] right and since you have strength that
[00:59:39] actually brings it up to plus
[00:59:48] nine that must have been you that would
[00:59:50] got the sword that's the only I think of
[00:59:51] I don't know why anybody else would
[00:59:52] gotten two of
[00:59:54] them well those uh those dogs there they
[00:59:58] do not like what happened and they

[01:10:39] William I was the one that pulled out

[01:10:43] pulled the confetti out at pre-release

[01:11:04] first rare raging battl Mouse ooh a
[01:11:08] little Restless Cottage in the extended
[01:11:10] borderless one there I
[01:11:12] mean oh rare nice oversold cemetry for
[01:11:15] that nice pick up there a lay line of
[01:11:18] anticipation and foil for you there you
[01:11:21] go with a food token that wasn't pretty
[01:11:23] that was pretty good one that was a nice
[01:11:24] little pack there
[01:11:29] I'll go
[01:11:32] over I like it a lot but yeah lost
[01:11:34] caverns and um they did a good job with
[01:11:36] wildz drains and lost Caverns see I like
[01:11:39] how they take um see I don't like how
[01:11:41] they completely reimage a set but I like
[01:11:43] how they have like the primary part of
[01:11:45] it and they like split out into a
[01:11:46] different part of the world that's a
[01:11:48] cool idea to me I like how they pull it
[01:11:49] off that way now uh when they like kind
[01:11:51] of like remake things and make them
[01:11:54] different that were original ones and
[01:11:56] it's like seems that's that throws me
[01:11:58] off but I personally like that Aether
[01:12:02] drift I
[01:12:04] mean honestly some of the cards I like
[01:12:07] the cards personally some of the uh
[01:12:09] images on them because it reminds me of
[01:12:12] uh I think it was a house that said It
[01:12:14] reminds me of um like beas and Butthead
[01:12:17] kind of if that makes sense uh the art
[01:12:20] and then for me that's like you know
[01:12:21] throwback to when I was a a little bit
[01:12:23] younger so it reminds me of that art so
[01:12:24] I kind kind of like it a little bit now
[01:12:26] the uh all the other stuff though it's
[01:12:29] like an eh okay set I wouldn't say it's
[01:12:32] like the best set it's like far from the
[01:12:34] best I'd say it's it's an okay one it's
[01:12:36] not the it not the funnest doesn't have
[01:12:37] the best things it has some good stuff I
[01:12:40] think would the art like that but that's
[01:12:41] like my that's my opinion just having
[01:12:44] been around with Beav and Butthead
[01:12:48] times yeah exactly it's you it's either
[01:12:50] they love it or hate it exactly big see
[01:12:53] that's why for me I'm like I'm I'm like
[01:12:54] ah see like I like the art on it but I
[01:12:56] don't necessarily like everything else
[01:12:58] in it if that makes
[01:13:00] sense
[01:13:02] wazer
[01:13:04] doodle let me get your name out on those
[01:13:07] a question Daddy and what's up buddy uh
[01:13:10] what is your favorite oh
[01:13:12] [Â __Â ] my favorite one so far I'd have to
[01:13:16] say would be I really did like uh lost
[01:13:19] Caverns but I like dinosaurs so I'm a
[01:13:20] little bit biased on that but who knows
[01:13:23] what the dragon's coming out that might
[01:13:25] might change out because I do like
[01:13:26] dragons too so about Lord of the Rings
[01:13:29] Lord of the Rings was a good set now the
[01:13:31] difference is that's not like a that
[01:13:32] wasn't like a magic set so if we're
[01:13:33] going to go with like my favorite um
[01:13:36] like
[01:13:38] uh uh what do you call it land be uh H
[01:13:41] the Beyond no the Beyond one universe
[01:13:44] beyond yeah Beyond universe beyond if I
[01:13:46] was going to look favorite universe
[01:13:48] beyond I do like
[01:13:50] um the Lord of the Rings cuz you just
[01:13:54] always been in giant f it they did a
[01:13:55] good really good job with that with the
[01:13:57] mechanics and the cards not necessary
[01:13:59] all the art but the mechanics and the
[01:14:01] cards were pretty good I'd have to say
[01:14:04] that's my at least that's what I feel
[01:14:06] for the opinion there on my stuff on
[01:14:09] those sets but you know opinions are
[01:14:12] like blank holes everybody's got one and
[01:14:15] they generally all
[01:14:19] stink got some fighting birds about the
[01:14:22] art on exactly Lord of the Rings see
[01:14:25] Rings they could have done better with
[01:14:26] it with some of the art but here we go
[01:14:28] this is our break today these packs here
[01:14:30] plus the uh secret layer hatsu
[01:14:33] Miko is that like the one with Japanese
[01:14:37] yes that is uh but this is not the
[01:14:39] Japanese version this is the English one
[01:14:42] oh I like Japanese books they look cool
[01:14:45] yeah exactly they do they all it's just
[01:14:47] the writing on them you like the writing
[01:14:48] on it being different yeah and they also
[01:14:53] the well yeah the art on the special
[01:14:55] edition ones does look cool
[01:14:57] y yeah exactly some they did well others
[01:15:00] they didn't correct spicy
[01:15:03] exactly oh no it is definitely a good
[01:15:05] one that's definitely good stuff it's
[01:15:07] just more of a it's more the
[01:15:12] uh not everybody was a fan of how they
[01:15:15] interpreted everything if that makes
[01:15:18] sense now don't mind whatever people
[01:15:19] interpret things however they
[01:15:22] want and to me I'll keep playing
[01:15:25] but it will not be like one of the ones
[01:15:27] that becomes my necessarily favorite one
[01:15:29] if I it's not the way that I interpret
[01:15:31] it if that make
[01:15:33] sense that may so that's kind of why
[01:15:36] that's all it's one of the you know
[01:15:38] other people are the same way you know
[01:15:39] they they like a set because they like
[01:15:41] the art or they like the theme of it and
[01:15:42] they don't like another one because they
[01:15:44] don't that's where opinions are like
[01:15:47] like I said they all everybody's got one
[01:15:49] and they all
[01:15:51] stank all right we're going to open up
[01:15:54] we have some more we actually have
[01:15:55] another pack here that I had put off to
[01:15:58] the side that maybe we could we should
[01:15:59] open thank you an uh thank you all
[01:16:03] hanging out
[01:16:07] there that's keeping it civil without
[01:16:10] saying nothing someone can hate exactly
[01:16:12] exactly keeping it civil all right so I
[01:16:14] have this we're going to open up this
[01:16:16] here cuz I have a handful of my put off

[01:28:59] them you could just pay off your house
[01:29:01] but no you wanted to go up that one ring
[01:29:05] I know all those boxes went up wicked
[01:29:07] high in price like I I what is it like
[01:29:10] $1,000 I actually have one sealed box of
[01:29:13] um the original Lord of the Rings I just
[01:29:16] haven't opened it because it's just been
[01:29:18] sitting there sealed and I'm like I'm
[01:29:19] going to hold on to that for one for a
[01:29:20] while and same thing with uh fallout I
[01:29:22] have a sealed box of fallouts
[01:29:26] too I had a bunch of Fallout stuff for
[01:29:28] sale at one point because I kept a chunk
[01:29:30] of it that I was happy with and I don't
[01:29:32] know where the rest of the Fallout stuff
[01:29:33] went I have to go through some more of
[01:29:35] my
[01:29:37] boxes exactly once printing stops it's
[01:29:40] just going to keep going up
[01:29:43] exactly yeah 7800 I know special edition
[01:29:46] is crazy at 1,500 bucks for one box of
[01:29:49] that all right
[01:29:52] well looks like we're hanging out out
[01:29:54] here for a little while we
[01:29:56] uh see you guys come into here you were
[01:29:59] talking about that because our buddy
[01:30:01] Halloween made a comment about maybe
[01:30:03] going over to uh where your buddy Bast
[01:30:07] B9 gave you an interesting
[01:30:11] location yeah see I I got a boxes I got
[01:30:14] boxes when they were like original
[01:30:16] pricing and that's ones that I've kept
[01:30:17] I've had them that long like when they
[01:30:19] came out and you saw your original
[01:30:21] pricing you could buy them on say Amazon
[01:30:23] that's what they were at for
[01:30:26] me so yeah I mean they're it's crazy how
[01:30:29] expensive things have gotten when it
[01:30:31] comes I mean think of
[01:30:33] um final fantasy like they're like well
[01:30:37] already like $400 $500 a
[01:30:40] box and they haven't even yeah well dude
[01:30:43] I went through spicy if you were talking
[01:30:46] about I had actually for the store and
[01:30:48] the amount of boxes I went through I
[01:30:49] probably went through 20 plus boxes if
[01:30:52] not 30 boxes of um special edition and
[01:30:55] I'm like damnn I wish I kept one or two
[01:30:57] of
[01:30:58] those special edition
[01:31:01] what yeah I never thought they would be
[01:31:03] as high as they are I can't well
[01:31:05] hopefully I get some from where our
[01:31:06] location here because I didn't buy any
[01:31:07] at MSRP uh they all sold out on Amazon
[01:31:11] all those places I'm like I'm done I'm
[01:31:13] not going to buy it at $500 nope but I
[01:31:15] normally get access to it and I ordered
[01:31:17] a chunk from the location that I
[01:31:19] normally buy from um and they they
[01:31:21] should be fine
[01:31:26] but the thing is though my concern is if
[01:31:29] they do the same thing as uh you know um
[01:31:32] what do you call
[01:31:34] it
[01:31:36] uh Assassin's Creed you know what's
[01:31:41] that yeah Special Edition was good I
[01:31:44] remember people buying them at like 30
[01:31:45] to $45 I think like 50 was the highest I
[01:31:49] ended up I was like I'm not going to get
[01:31:50] any more if they're $50 or more cuz it
[01:31:51] just like kind of made it not worth it
[01:31:53] in a
[01:31:59] way yeah now boxes $1,000 yeah 1500 hey
[01:32:03] click clack hopefully you're having a
[01:32:05] good morning
[01:32:14] here yeah that was actually a pretty
[01:32:16] good set it just didn't didn't hold its
[01:32:18] value at all well I liked some of the
[01:32:20] stuff but I also like the game that's
[01:32:21] part of the reason why you know if
[01:32:22] you're going to like the game and you
[01:32:24] like what it is you going to have a
[01:32:25] little bit of a bias to it you
[01:32:34] know all righty
[01:32:37] well yeah exactly sucker for things that
[01:32:40] go with it kind of like well like with
[01:32:41] Fallout for me I got so much of that
[01:32:43] because of it and I just I wish I could
[01:32:45] have gotten more I ended up buying some
[01:32:48] on Amazon and I canceled the order
[01:32:50] because I B bought a bunch from the
[01:32:51] location I normally do and it was the
[01:32:53] first time I had ever had um like
[01:32:55] restrictions on the ordering and I only
[01:32:57] got two out of like the 24 that I
[01:33:01] ordered I'm like oh [Â __Â ] I should have
[01:33:03] kept kept the ones on Amazon because the
[01:33:05] ones on Amazon were at like the original
[01:33:07] lowest price they had which was like 200
[01:33:09] at one point and I had probably 30 of
[01:33:11] them I
[01:33:13] bought now it does appear big BK since
[01:33:16] you're the only one that wants in this
[01:33:18] is what I'll give you an option of all
[01:33:19] right my friend you can grab some packs

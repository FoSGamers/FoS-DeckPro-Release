[00:00:00] checkins running
[00:00:05] correctly all right should be get a
[00:00:09] minute hopefully everyone's having a
[00:00:11] good
[00:00:12] one this day is going to be fun one for
[00:00:15] you all but we'll
[00:00:18] see let's enable it get it morning good
[00:00:21] morning steel assassin so we have a new
[00:00:24] uh new thing we're doing with our
[00:00:25] giveaway here and decided to make a
[00:00:27] little bit of a change I felt that
[00:00:29] giving away just like the singles that
[00:00:31] weren't uh were kind of like weren't
[00:00:33] worth much regularly you know I can do
[00:00:36] them as bulk stuff if people want to buy
[00:00:38] it versus just doing those giveaway
[00:00:40] things so what I was thinking of doing
[00:00:42] instead was to I'm adjusting how we do
[00:00:44] it so my wife and I were talking about
[00:00:47] it last night she's like maybe you
[00:00:48] should just give away like a you know a
[00:00:50] pack of cards type thing so this is what
[00:00:53] I was going to
[00:00:55] do I
[00:00:57] have these
[00:01:01] Elite or un exceptional cards here from
[00:01:07] uh sometimes possibly even unique but I
[00:01:09] believe they're only Exceptional from
[00:01:11] our um sorcery which we play here what
[00:01:14] I'm going to do is I'm putting them all
[00:01:16] here and I'm going to have the uh one
[00:01:19] that has a foil in it we'll Shuffle
[00:01:21] these up and what the person we'll do
[00:01:23] I'll have I'll have a uh the people that
[00:01:25] go through and do some
[00:01:27] check-ins what I'll do is I'll see if I
[00:01:29] can I think I think I can sort who is in
[00:01:31] the check-ins there using in um in uh
[00:01:36] Google Sheets when I can do that and see
[00:01:39] if I can pull out everybody's name and
[00:01:41] put you in a wheel and spin it whoever
[00:01:44] gets it every now and again what we'll
[00:01:45] do is he'll have you at pick a number
[00:01:47] from here and if it happens to be the
[00:01:50] one that is the foil card we'll give
[00:01:54] away the pack that I'm showing on
[00:01:56] screen what do you guys think about that
[00:01:59] your daughters birthday well happy
[00:02:00] birthday for your daughter Mr
[00:02:05] Fong well that's good to know thank you
[00:02:07] I appreciate that yeah um um I can get
[00:02:09] some of that stuff out going for some
[00:02:11] singles and those for in in a second
[00:02:14] here what do you guys think about the uh
[00:02:16] the new idea
[00:02:17] there think it's uh worth it or
[00:02:20] not I don't know I thought it was a bad
[00:02:22] I thought it was a good idea thought it
[00:02:24] made it more intriguing versus just kind
[00:02:26] of getting in away um uh a single out
[00:02:30] again you're going to end up
[00:02:36] getting this here so this is well this
[00:02:38] is what we'll end up doing so this will
[00:02:40] be in here we'll Shuffle everything
[00:02:43] around you know get everything all
[00:02:45] shuffled in there with these sorcery
[00:02:48] cards what I'll do is I'll say
[00:02:50] hey so and so that's been checking
[00:02:55] in give me a number between one and 60
[00:02:59] cuz that's the amount of cards that are
[00:03:00] in here and you if you happen to pick
[00:03:06] one kind of like a little bit if you
[00:03:08] pick one it happens to be the one that's
[00:03:10] the foil one then you do that what do
[00:03:13] you guys think I don't
[00:03:15] know well I can cut it down lower but I
[00:03:18] was going to have it go quicker like
[00:03:20] have it Go frequently rather than every
[00:03:21] five minutes I was going to have people
[00:03:23] get a choice more frequently so if that
[00:03:25] makes any sense at
[00:03:27] all like when it's slow here
[00:03:32] I don't know maybe I'm Maybe I'm Wrong
[00:03:34] on that maybe there are too
[00:03:37] many but the reason is I was going to be
[00:03:39] putting something out like this for our
[00:03:41] giveaway that people would hit all
[00:03:47] right see I would give you guys for our
[00:03:49] giveaway it would be like you'd have a
[00:03:51] choice of
[00:03:53] this
[00:03:58] is this
[00:04:01] say the other ones are you like a choice
[00:04:04] of one of these for your
[00:04:11] giveaway you know that would be kind of
[00:04:13] what the giveaway would end up being if
[00:04:15] you saw me over
[00:04:17] there and then as we get more like more
[00:04:19] people that check in like we do our
[00:04:21] regular check-ins instead that will end
[00:04:23] up being the giveaway will end up being
[00:04:25] instead of one of these it'll go to like
[00:04:26] uh collector boosters of some kind what
[00:04:29] do you think I know I thought it was a
[00:04:31] good
[00:04:32] idea this feedback from the
[00:04:35] mic you're getting all feedback from the
[00:04:37] M every mic everyone all right give me
[00:04:40] one second
[00:04:41] here let me um yes all right I'm sorry
[00:04:46] everyone give me one second here I'm
[00:04:48] gonna have to do a little
[00:04:50] refresh to get everything back so I'll
[00:04:52] be right back
[00:04:58] here
[00:05:28] e e
[00:06:29] all right

[00:06:42] good can you hear
[00:06:46] me why is there

[00:07:02] this not gonna
[00:07:05] work how's
[00:07:07] this huh that's
[00:07:11] weird so
[00:07:14] weird why am I hearing you don't hear an
[00:07:18] echo yeah you hear an
[00:07:20] echo why is there an
[00:07:24] e there's lit no reason
[00:07:32] all
[00:07:36] right what is going
[00:07:40] on oh my God what happened with what not
[00:07:46] here let me try
[00:07:52] um how's that can you hear me
[00:07:56] still can you guys hear me just let me
[00:07:59] know if you can still hear yeah all
[00:08:01] right so I just shut off for some reason
[00:08:03] whatnot was letting the mic sound go
[00:08:05] through no Echo anymore a lot better all
[00:08:07] right cool thank you trying to figure
[00:08:10] out what the problem was and it seems
[00:08:11] that uh I had uh an issue with
[00:08:19] um whatnot wanted to keep going
[00:08:24] here let me get back here to YouTube
[00:08:30] Studio here so I can get in c contact
[00:08:32] with everybody hanging out with me right
[00:08:34] now I'm sorry about that we had some
[00:08:36] technical difficulties here for a minute
[00:08:39] that is intriguing but hey it happens I
[00:08:41] guess
[00:08:43] right but here all right so this is what
[00:08:46] I was trying to say
[00:08:49] was I was on karaoke mode that's pretty
[00:08:52] funny so I was saying with the enhanced
[00:08:54] giveaway what we're doing here is I'm
[00:08:55] going to have it go where everybody that
[00:08:57] checks in you're going to have a choice
[00:08:58] here we're going to do this and we're
[00:08:59] going to do every we're going to do it
[00:09:00] frequently though so the thing is we
[00:09:02] we'll have them come out here I'm going
[00:09:04] to do
[00:09:06] this we'll have them
[00:09:11] import into our sheets
[00:09:15] here so for instance we have our
[00:09:17] check-ins right
[00:09:19] now let's see how many check-ins we're
[00:09:23] at we'll get our check-in
[00:09:26] list we see all right because for some
[00:09:29] reason is not showing everything right
[00:09:32] we have all right the nine that are
[00:09:33] checked in there so what we would do is
[00:09:35] we're going to do this
[00:10:20] so we do this we organize them yeah cut
[00:10:23] him out I'm cut him in now the only
[00:10:26] problem is I was wondering how big the
[00:10:27] wheel is going to end up being
[00:10:30] so I'm guessing it's going to end up
[00:10:31] being huge when you have a ton of people
[00:10:33] that are in there so we show the
[00:10:35] randomizer all right guys GNA run that
[00:10:38] and the person currently that gets
[00:10:40] chased to would be Mr Fong I'd ask you
[00:10:43] give me a number between one and 60
[00:10:51] here 8 one two three four five six seven
[00:10:55] eight all right so we know it's not
[00:10:57] going to end up being one of the the
[00:10:59] foil one because it doesn't have the
[00:11:01] back correctly so we we'll do here I'll
[00:11:03] say all right well we don't have that
[00:11:05] there and we're going to go on end up
[00:11:06] being an evil presence which is actually
[00:11:08] a nice card the Air Force sorcery if you
[00:11:09] guys play it all but one here would have
[00:11:13] been where are we oh it was far back
[00:11:16] there it was far back there was where
[00:11:17] our foil was and that's our beautiful
[00:11:18] foil from there the back
[00:11:21] stab I don't know what do you guys think
[00:11:22] is that is that intriguing or no because
[00:11:26] now instead of just getting like a
[00:11:28] single giv away
[00:11:29] all right we're going to shuffle it up
[00:11:32] again so everything's in a different
[00:11:35] spot put it down instead of getting a
[00:11:38] single you guys get a choice of like one
[00:11:40] of these type of things rather than just
[00:11:42] a single I don't know I was thinking it
[00:11:44] was uh my wife thought it was a decent
[00:11:46] idea and I'm like you know what actually
[00:11:47] not a bad idea that way we can give
[00:11:49] everybody a better chance of getting
[00:11:51] something it's up to
[00:11:53] you what do you guys think
[00:12:00] like the idea all right let's do this
[00:12:02] I'll put it I'll this is two we have two
[00:12:04] polls we're doing today all right the
[00:12:06] first poll is going to be
[00:12:19] this here you go
[00:12:33] there we go put that poll up there so
[00:12:36] that you guys see so for instance what
[00:12:38] we would be doing here is we have this
[00:12:40] is our 1,000 subscriber giveaway from
[00:12:42] YouTube so if we happen to h a th000
[00:12:44] subscribers on YouTube we're going to
[00:12:45] give that away but if we um as we go
[00:12:48] throughout the day here we're just going
[00:12:49] to take and we're going to copy and
[00:12:50] paste every everybody that does
[00:12:51] check-ins into a wheel we're going to
[00:12:53] spin it and see who gets it what their
[00:12:55] name is and they're going to get to pick
[00:12:57] one of these numbers we're going to ask
[00:12:58] for number and that number will end up
[00:13:01] if you end up getting the one that has
[00:13:03] the foil card you get to pick we'll
[00:13:05] throw one of these out we'll put a i
[00:13:06] we'll put up a one a giveaway and the
[00:13:10] winner will get a choice of one of those
[00:13:12] I know what do you
[00:13:14] think all right I thought it was a
[00:13:16] decent one kind of a fun idea so what I
[00:13:18] need to do then if we kind of like that
[00:13:21] that I need to get a box of some kind of
[00:13:25] use I think this one is empty aha it is
[00:13:28] empty
[00:13:29] perfect this box is empty so when we
[00:13:32] Shuffle we can put back in here we put
[00:13:35] this box away we'll sit right over there
[00:13:38] waiting for us with our
[00:13:43] packs ah the new kids follow well that's
[00:13:46] still follow when the giveaway still
[00:13:49] goes yes it does help new people
[00:13:52] follow um but it sometimes does uh you
[00:13:56] know the type of follow though is do I
[00:13:59] want people to follow that are
[00:14:04] um there or are they just in for a
[00:14:06] giveaway that makes
[00:14:08] sense all right
[00:14:15] anyways nice I get my stuff today sweet
[00:14:17] I'll see where it is I don't know when
[00:14:19] it doesn't show shouldn't come in
[00:14:21] soon yeah that way people that are
[00:14:24] hanging out and participating are the
[00:14:26] ones that have more chance of getting
[00:14:27] something cool versus the people that
[00:14:29] are just coming in and just trying to
[00:14:30] get in the giveaway I I think it was a
[00:14:32] little different like that I don't know
[00:14:34] if it makes sense oh look we have one
[00:14:37] here I thought there was I was looking
[00:14:38] for that
[00:14:39] earlier I don't know if that makes sense
[00:14:41] but I don't
[00:14:43] know how do you change your answer um I
[00:14:47] don't know I don't know if you can
[00:14:48] change your answer you might be able to
[00:14:50] go in and re redo it you can try
[00:14:53] it but if that I don't know that kind of
[00:14:55] was my thought process on
[00:14:57] it but anyway anyways we're going to run
[00:15:00] our adventure game for you guys right

[00:25:03] there are going to have either set
[00:25:05] boosters play boosters or uh Homeland
[00:25:08] attached to it and then we're going to
[00:25:10] put in some of these singles into it
[00:25:13] then when we get through those 25 we're
[00:25:16] going to have 16 of them left they're
[00:25:18] all going to be collector boosters and
[00:25:19] they're all going to be at $19 for a
[00:25:21] poll from the box for 16 and there're

[00:25:30] get up to the end so we'll have some fun
[00:25:33] here and let's play a little bit of the
[00:25:35] game guys now I'm going to give you the
[00:25:37] option Captain to play our game here
[00:25:39] since you were the one that just got our
[00:25:41] uh our box here let's see what happens
[00:25:43] and whoever as we go with our game every
[00:25:46] single time we get to another new
[00:25:47] encounter a new thing I'm gonna have
[00:25:48] somebody get a chance to do it and we'll
[00:25:50] go from there and see what happens what
[00:25:51] do you think I thought it was pretty fun
[00:25:54] pretty good idea Captain you want to
[00:25:57] play
[00:26:00] all right Captain so this is what we're
[00:26:03] at right
[00:26:05] now let me get our
[00:26:07] uh our thing out
[00:26:11] here our last situation is we were uh I
[00:26:15] think we found some treasure that we
[00:26:17] brought back to our boat right because
[00:26:19] we found some treasure at that Pharaoh's
[00:26:22] Place went back to the boat with it now
[00:26:24] remember one of the nice things when
[00:26:25] you're at the
[00:26:26] boat is you have your guys are all your
[00:26:30] stuff there but you have some friends
[00:26:31] there that you've met along the way some
[00:26:33] guys that help maybe with some combat
[00:26:35] and some luck and your person with some
[00:26:38] knowledge so maybe if you uh have some
[00:26:39] questions you can ask them certain
[00:26:40] things because you know you had that map
[00:26:42] there this of the desert island trying
[00:26:45] to figure out where you're going trying
[00:26:46] to figure out where you're going around
[00:26:47] this desert island here
[00:26:51] now that being said
[00:27:01] what would you like to
[00:27:05] do would you like to continue on or
[00:27:07] would you like to play or should I have
[00:27:08] somebody else um try it
[00:27:11] out it is up to you my friend sure you
[00:27:14] said all right I got sure So currently
[00:27:17] we're hanging out we're on that island
[00:27:19] there let's get to our where we were we
[00:27:21] got to our desert Nomad our cursed mummy
[00:27:25] ah we went through our cursed mummy
[00:27:27] that's where our little last encounter
[00:27:28] we're wandering around let see see our
[00:27:32] last encounter let's find
[00:27:45] out all right
[00:27:52] so all right that's uh we'll do this we
[00:27:55] we're W wandering around here this is
[00:27:57] not a we'll see what happens you're
[00:27:59] wandering through you're uh trying to
[00:28:02] follow your
[00:28:04] map and you don't know what you can do
[00:28:13] here that did not do it
[00:28:24] right all right so you're on your map do
[00:28:26] you want to look at your map go f we're
[00:28:28] going to find something here to hang out
[00:28:30] with now what is going on is
[00:28:40] uh why isn't that showing
[00:28:47] there so you're wandering here all right
[00:28:50] and you see
[00:28:53] something and you want and my question
[00:28:55] is do you want to go and investigate
[00:28:57] this something that you
[00:29:00] see it looks
[00:29:06] like there may be a nest of something in
[00:29:08] front of you you're not really sure
[00:29:11] weird paw prints you're not exactly sure
[00:29:13] what's going
[00:29:14] on want to get some map Reading friends
[00:29:17] all right that's a good idea so you ask
[00:29:19] your friends go hey the Terry the guy
[00:29:22] that's uh pretty smart here can you help
[00:29:24] me
[00:29:25] out and give you some tips on that map
[00:29:28] tells you where to go says you're going
[00:29:31] to find your treasure over here and he
[00:29:32] points the direction helps you know now
[00:29:34] you head out on your next thing and you
[00:29:36] do wander and you find some of those
[00:29:38] areas you start wandering around that
[00:29:39] desert area find a little bit of stuff
[00:29:41] and all of a sudden you find a little
[00:29:42] bit of a trail all right maybe this is
[00:29:44] the way we're supposed to
[00:29:45] go are you going to follow this Trail
[00:29:47] and see what happens my
[00:29:55] friend that bigger where you you're
[00:29:58] going to turn around and uh go the way
[00:29:59] that was on the map not the way your
[00:30:01] friend told you maybe this is a shortcut
[00:30:04] we're not
[00:30:07] sure now remember everybody you can jump
[00:30:09] in participate in the game always take
[00:30:13] over guaranteed when you are one of
[00:30:16] these didn't we're on the
[00:30:18] auction you can get some good stuff in
[00:30:20] it
[00:30:23] too braz and Trail brazing all right
[00:30:26] trailblazing I like it you do some
[00:30:27] brazen Trail blazing you decide all
[00:30:29] right we're going
[00:30:30] further and you wander through that
[00:30:35] trail and you see
[00:30:37] something oh
[00:30:43] no you now
[00:30:44] [Music]
[00:30:45] see what was there that wasn't that you
[00:30:49] thought it was initially it happens to
[00:30:51] be a nest of
[00:30:53] scorpions what are you going to do do
[00:30:56] you want to turn around
[00:30:58] remember you have your your weapon that
[00:31:00] no one's used yet that's got a couple of
[00:31:02] things here maybe it's special we're not
[00:31:03] sure you got your couple of your friends
[00:31:05] you can call on your bone Strangler your
[00:31:07] bone scratcher and your Strangler you
[00:31:10] also have your weapons here to
[00:31:14] do what were you do my friend now
[00:31:16] remember the new giveaway we're going to
[00:31:17] do right after this we're GNA have
[00:31:19] somebody pull out a card between one and
[00:31:20] 60 and see who gets it and if that
[00:31:22] happens we're going to go on and on
[00:31:23] we'll do a pack giveaway instead so
[00:31:25] we're going to give away packs more
[00:31:27] frequently we kind of try to give patch
[00:31:28] away instead of car at Singles on a
[00:31:30] regular basis feel like that's more fun
[00:31:33] good spice you like it so let's see if
[00:31:36] anybody else wants to jump in we do have
[00:31:37] some Modern Horizon packs still
[00:31:41] available there is currently no ranged
[00:31:44] weapon with the pirate here you have
[00:31:46] your your friends that may at some point
[00:31:49] bring a range ranged weapon if you get
[00:31:51] different friends but right now there
[00:31:53] are no ranged weapons
[00:31:58] currently there are not you have a sword
[00:32:02] a broadsword a Rapier sword a short like
[00:32:06] another broad sword that's shorter then
[00:32:08] you have two Shields and your two
[00:32:10] friends there so let's see what goes
[00:32:13] on and this is what I'm going to do next
[00:32:15] all of our check-in people remember keep
[00:32:17] checking in because now this is what I'm
[00:32:20] going to do I'm going to see how many
[00:32:21] who we have for our check-ins I'm going
[00:32:23] to get that list then we're going to see
[00:32:26] the checkin report
[00:32:28] we're going to open this up
[00:32:39] here there we go we're going to take
[00:32:42] everybody that's been checking in we
[00:32:44] have 23 people that have checked in so
[00:32:46] far we're going to take
[00:32:49] you we're going to put
[00:32:54] you in the randomizer
[00:33:03] can you guys see me am I
[00:33:06] froze yeah fighting doesn't seem like a
[00:33:08] good idea with a range weapon I have to
[00:33:10] agree so what would you like to do my
[00:33:11] friend you can turn around and run or
[00:33:15] you can uh continue on but what I'll do
[00:33:17] here now is we're going to see who gets
[00:33:18] a chance to choose our next one if we're
[00:33:20] gonna have anything all right steel
[00:33:22] assassin is up to you between one and
[00:33:26] 20 what's going to happen here remember
[00:33:28] everybody we're going to just uh have
[00:33:30] randomly some of you take over the game
[00:33:32] not always we can't guarantee it every
[00:33:34] time but we uh we do need to have some
[00:33:36] of this run through here maybe somebody
[00:33:37] will jump in and get some of our other
[00:33:39] stuff and you know maybe we'll throw
[00:33:40] some singles out here for a little while
[00:33:42] at some point well we'll do some singles
[00:33:44] in a little bit I don't know it's up to
[00:33:47] you so are you g to turn around and run
[00:33:50] from uh this Scorpion's Nest I have to
[00:33:54] agree with you without a ranged weapon
[00:33:56] it doesn't seem like a great idea to
[00:33:57] fight
[00:34:08] then move the box I want to try to get
[00:34:10] that closer so you guys can see a little
[00:34:14] better realize it's harder to see we
[00:34:17] move stuff around I want to make sure
[00:34:19] it's easier to see for all you
[00:34:38] there you go kind of see what we got
[00:34:41] there that's not
[00:34:44] bad so yeah let me know what you're
[00:34:46] going to do observe their movements for
[00:34:47] a bit try to go past them well You
[00:34:51] observe their
[00:34:53] movement you're trying to hide there's
[00:34:55] no trees it's a sand dune area so you
[00:34:57] kind of hide a little bit and observe
[00:34:58] what's going on to see what's occurring
[00:35:02] and our friend did you give me a number
[00:35:07] to do for our uh
[00:35:14] checkins steel if I did I missed it
[00:35:18] please steel
[00:35:21] assassin so you're observing them from a
[00:35:23] distance you're not really knowing
[00:35:24] what's going on and hey this is what
[00:35:27] we're going to do
[00:35:29] um seal assassin I'm going to run that
[00:35:31] I'm going to run the thing again since I
[00:35:33] don't see you in here and U we'll run it
[00:35:36] again for the check-in wheel for the
[00:35:38] next
[00:35:42] person then we need a number between one
[00:35:45] and 60 from that next person so that we

[00:36:09] on but you do notice that they're not
[00:36:12] necessar scary they're not really
[00:36:15] aggressive but you don't know they're

[00:40:37] try your choice on what we're doing my
[00:40:40] friend we currently have our encounter
[00:40:41] we're going to be hurt we don't
[00:40:43] know now we have no one doing Mr Fong
[00:40:45] are you in here I need you to type a D2
[00:40:49] D60 or give me a number between one60 if
[00:40:51] you can because you were the last one
[00:40:54] that got our name these
[00:40:58] not that
[00:41:00] 60 42 all right
[00:41:03] 42 one two three four five six seven oh
[00:41:08] we did not get the foil it was number
[00:41:12] seven all right number seven so we're
[00:41:15] GNA try again this is what we're going
[00:41:17] to do here ah no worries no worries
[00:41:19] we'll try again here and what we're
[00:41:20] gonna do is we're going to uh Shuffle
[00:41:23] these up and whichever one comes out as
[00:41:25] a foil lator our fun sorcery cards here
[00:41:29] you're going to get a
[00:41:31] chance that will get you one of these
[00:41:34] three packs as we giveway instead of
[00:41:36] just giving away cards all the time I
[00:41:38] thought it was a good idea to give away
[00:41:39] packs and give people opportunities to
[00:41:40] get packs more frequently so we're g to
[00:41:42] give this away for pack these one of
[00:41:44] these three and if we get the foil card
[00:41:46] out the person points out the foil
[00:41:48] that's when we do
[00:41:49] that so keep swinging so you swing
[00:41:54] again oh that was a nice one you hit
[00:41:57] them get hit on one of them they're not
[00:42:00] happy about it brings one of the
[00:42:01] Scorpions and chops one of his uh claws
[00:42:04] off that scorpion goes from uh 40 Health
[00:42:08] down to 20
[00:42:12] health and it goes starts to flee a
[00:42:14] little bit because it doesn't like
[00:42:15] having a claw chopped off but another
[00:42:17] comes toward you while you're fighting
[00:42:19] what are you going to do my
[00:42:24] friend poison squirrel I did not
[00:42:27] but I hopefully will have my stuff

[00:42:34] week I have my St coming in I'm going
[00:42:36] have 12 collector boosters with

[00:42:47] my my friend you got unlucky again you
[00:42:52] missed that that one whacks you with its
[00:42:54] tail as you swung at it Knocking you
[00:42:57] down to the ground you go from 121 down
[00:43:00] to
[00:43:02] 103 that's not good that one ends up
[00:43:06] fleeing still
[00:43:11] further yeah I'll have them later I
[00:43:13] appreciate that Mr Fong I appreciate
[00:43:17] that
[00:43:18] so let's keep going here I guess uh no

[00:43:26] sale
[00:43:37] yeah I have not see
[00:43:40] that so what are you going to do you're
[00:43:42] going to hit the hurt what are you going
[00:43:43] to do you're knock to the ground big
[00:43:45] hurt you have one more thing to do
[00:43:47] before you either have to run away and
[00:43:50] hopefully not die or maybe you can uh
[00:43:52] get one of them dead there and they can
[00:43:54] take off
[00:43:57] that's your choice
[00:44:37] try and finish it off again so you get
[00:44:38] up off the ground you don't care about
[00:44:40] that you're a pirate I don't care I get

[00:54:57] puzzle do we try to solve it I mean you
[00:54:59] do have uh remember you've got a couple
[00:55:02] of friends that are lucky from your boat

[00:55:23] comes over and he goes decides he's
[00:55:25] going to
[00:55:28] inspect that goes oh this is a puzzle
[00:55:32] ining let's see he start touching things
[00:55:36] moving things around examining
[00:55:39] it and you notice is something
[00:55:45] interesting
[00:55:47] so he gets over closer to it he says Ah

[00:55:57] is but we're going to continue
[00:56:00] anyways so you go on into the cave and
[00:56:02] you find this puzzle on the ground I

[00:56:07] thing and he helps you figure it
[00:56:12] out your buddy
[00:56:15] Terry and why figuring it out you hear
[00:56:18] creaking in the background
[00:56:29] you hear creaking in the
[00:56:31] background and opens a door on the side

[00:57:05] distance oh my look at that that was a
[00:57:08] good idea to go and do that you go and
[00:57:11] you see some Jewels hidden in the
[00:57:15] cave now not a bad not a bad one Terry
[00:57:20] Terry was smart helped you out you have

[01:03:30] whenever you

[01:03:35] what we got for singles here anything
[01:03:37] that anybody would
[01:03:43] want look that we have a yeah so this is
[01:03:46] what we have set up here anybody need
[01:03:48] multiples of
[01:03:49] cards so do you need like uh anybody
[01:03:53] need a bunch of galvanic discharges we
[01:03:55] been organizing there's four of them in
[01:03:57] here so put that in there there's four
[01:03:59] galvanic discharges one's a
[01:04:06] foil all right very
[01:04:12] helpful all
[01:04:14] right here is the galvanic discharge now
[01:04:17] the foil version is that but there's
[01:04:19] four of them in there so what we'll do
[01:04:22] is this
[01:04:26] find now
[01:04:29] auction now whenever there's more than
[01:04:32] one it doesn't like multiple Pet cards
[01:04:34] it doesn't let me do it as the
[01:04:36] individual so what we do here is
[01:04:40] that and there you go throw that oh
[01:04:44] we're going to zoom zoom in so you can
[01:04:46] see it
[01:04:47] zoom zoom and there you go throw
[01:04:51] something like that out there no I don't
[01:04:53] know
[01:04:56] sometimes people need multiples of cards
[01:04:58] maybe that's not what they're looking
[01:04:59] for you're looking for though I don't
[01:05:00] know you have to let me
[01:05:07] know if I'm just being
[01:05:16] stupid we'll see we'll put that back
[01:05:21] then into my stack of stuff over here
[01:05:24] that one that didn't work so let's throw
[01:05:26] out some
[01:05:28] um something like
[01:05:38] this some stuff
[01:05:42] from our new bloomo we'll call them like
[01:05:45] the James repacks the fos
[01:05:47] repack we'll throw those out there so we
[01:05:51] are some
[01:05:54] rats about eight seven to nine cards
[01:05:58] sometimes a little bit more sometimes 12
[01:05:59] or something in some
[01:06:01] instance from
[01:06:03] bloomo all
[01:06:05] right put those out
[01:06:13] there what the rate from whatnot now
[01:06:16] well no if you do multiple cards that is
[01:06:19] the rate you can't do any if you do a
[01:06:21] single that's when I'm able they're able
[01:06:23] to be cheaper but when it's like
[01:06:25] multiple cards they consider them a pack
[01:06:27] that's why it's done the way it
[01:06:31] is so we have some re repacks here all
[01:06:35] right we're going to run that the fos
[01:06:38] repacks for these just throw them up for
[01:06:41] very cheap
[01:06:42] there hope you guys are doing all right
[01:06:44] shipping says four yeah because there're
[01:06:46] as a pack and it goes as packs because
[01:06:48] they're not singles because you have
[01:06:49] multiple if you have one single that's
[01:06:51] under a certain amount then you can sell
[01:06:53] it that way as the way that you do it
[01:06:55] with white envelope if it's more than
[01:06:57] one and it's like three to five I think
[01:07:00] it three to five is the uh the amount
[01:07:02] that it is if it's over three then it
[01:07:05] starts being or it's over five I always
[01:07:07] do three just because I one of the times
[01:07:08] I had it return saying it was overweight
[01:07:10] so anything over three it ends up being
[01:07:12] a
[01:07:14] pat so that's why this is done the way
[01:07:16] it
[01:07:17] is but no one wants any of that there so
[01:07:19] we'll put it
[01:07:20] back no a little idea but no one likes
[01:07:23] it so we're going to keep going here and
[01:07:25] doing different different
[01:07:27] stuff let's see what else we have see
[01:07:30] what else we have to
[01:07:32] do all
[01:07:35] right these ones here are all my f
[01:07:41] lands then we are going to do
[01:07:49] um do this here
[01:08:07] go through some of
[01:08:09] those grab that bring that over
[01:08:20] here let's do
[01:08:24] this bre bring the box
[01:08:28] over the Box the singles box that I have
[01:08:32] here no one wants to participate
[01:08:36] much with the game we'll do that we'll
[01:08:39] put the singles behind me that way I can
[01:08:42] grab some stacks and see if you're
[01:08:45] interested in anything that we have
[01:08:47] coming out let's put out a Tasha the
[01:08:50] witch creen
[01:09:00] oh no problem Oblivion well Tasha the
[01:09:02] witch
[01:09:05] cream now this one will go with the
[01:09:09] cheaper rate for your single shipping
[01:09:11] all right that's because this is uh one
[01:09:15] that is going to end up being a single
[01:09:16] it does as one which goes as one card in
[01:09:19] a um in an
[01:09:21] envelope unless you buy multiple cards
[01:09:23] you know what I mean so there you go
[01:09:24] Little T of the witch
[01:09:32] creen there you
[01:09:39] go make that
[01:09:41] brighter there we
[01:09:44] are no one wanted that so we'll put that
[01:09:46] over

[01:14:52] Mr Fong
[01:14:57] I do very much appreciate that they do
[01:14:59] like playing it and everything so we I
[01:15:01] know figured I'd introduce people to the
[01:15:03] game a little bit more by showing them
[01:15:04] uh the card here oh you going to see it
[01:15:07] somewhere in the middle
[01:15:12] maybe there we go put that right over
[01:15:15] there so everybody can see it Mr Fong it
[01:15:18] is your choice if you want to play for a
[01:15:19] little bit for the game uh but what I
[01:15:21] wanted to do here first was go through
[01:15:23] some of my um
[01:15:26] singles here
[01:15:28] from Outlaws now I don't have them all
[01:15:31] set up well F the mighty maybe want a
[01:15:34] little fell the
[01:15:44] mighty No I typed it
[01:15:48] wrong there you go little F the
[01:15:52] mighty with uh we'll throw in some extra
[01:15:56] stuff
[01:15:59] here with
[01:16:03] it throw a
[01:16:07] nice terminal
[01:16:14] Agony and put in uh where is the other
[01:16:20] one by the way this is the car that I
[01:16:22] think looks like um
[01:16:26] looks like uh oh who is the fighter oh
[01:16:29] my
[01:16:31] God he looks like oh God damn it oh
[01:16:35] what's his name
[01:17:04] what is his
[01:17:15] name oh damn it let's find I gotta find
[01:17:18] him Steven Seagal thank you this is who
[01:17:21] I think looks like Steven Seagal by the
[01:17:23] way I don't know why I couldn't think of
[01:17:25] his name I don't know if anybody else
[01:17:27] sees it but I I see Steven Seagal here
[01:17:30] every time I see that
[01:17:34] card but what I'm doing here is we going
[01:17:36] to put out a few of
[01:17:39] these see if anybody wants any a
[01:17:42] villainous
[01:17:45] wealth check that and that a villainous
[01:17:47] wealth
[01:17:52] in light reflecting on it hurts
[01:17:56] sometimes all right
[01:17:58] so one two three
[01:18:10] four 1 two 3 4
[01:18:13] five all right so you're going to have a
[01:18:16] hindering light villous wealth
[01:18:17] hypothesis termal Agony and a Fel the
[01:18:20] mighty or or a Steven seagull depending
[01:18:22] on who you who you think it is there
[01:18:26] I don't know if anybody else sees that
[01:18:27] but that's exactly what I see when every
[01:18:29] time I see that
[01:18:30] card so throw those out there it's like
[01:18:33] a little repack like I do there we call
[01:18:39] those they do have to go as the pack so
[01:18:41] because it doesn't do a thing we call
[01:18:42] those the $2 here you want those
[01:18:50] ones they are magic these are the
[01:18:53] Outlaws of under Junction magic ones
[01:18:56] that had the special they were the
[01:18:58] special um uh what do you call it show
[01:19:01] version of them like they
[01:19:03] uh showcase version that was the
[01:19:05] Showcase version on
[01:19:07] Outlaws all right we'll put all those
[01:19:09] back there guessing nobody wants all
[01:19:11] that type of stuff from Outlaws let's
[01:19:12] keep going through and scrolling and
[01:19:14] seeing what I got here maybe there's
[01:19:16] something somebody needs or wants but uh
[01:19:19] I know there's none of these are special
[01:19:21] ones here because I had to reuse them in
[01:19:24] a game which means they most likely
[01:19:26] weren't over the top what cost on
[01:19:31] them but hey you know what maybe we do
[01:19:34] this take all those
[01:19:37] out let's take all of them
[01:19:39] out all those out might as well if
[01:19:43] somebody wants any of them specifically
[01:19:45] because I know people like those uh
[01:19:47] poster wanted
[01:19:49] posters which is what those are they're
[01:19:51] the wanted posters from Outlaws
[01:19:55] so put all those over
[01:19:56] there if anybody wants them specifically
[01:20:00] well there we go we're getting into our
[01:20:01] some of our nice ones there I knew help
[01:20:04] help well that used to be worth
[01:20:05] something all right bud have a good
[01:20:08] one good luck have fun hey give me one
[01:20:13] second guys
[01:20:45] sorry it was my for uh middle school and
[01:20:48] I wanted to say tell them to like pretty
[01:20:50] much pay attention listen don't be the
[01:20:53] one talking so that
[01:20:55] you're being looked at by the teachers
[01:20:57] already you know what I
[01:21:09] mean there we go put that in there how's
[01:21:12] it going
[01:21:13] Quinn nice little house for Boss let's
[01:21:16] see what Hal toe is none of these are
[01:21:18] really worth too much anymore they were
[01:21:20] worth a little bit before but not too
[01:21:21] much in the first place they're good
[01:21:23] playing cards though
[01:21:25] see that's the thing there's I got a lot
[01:21:26] of good playing cards here but we'll
[01:21:29] throw out a hell to pay with the other
[01:21:30] one in back we'll give you a h SB B
[01:21:34] bossy boss with it also all
[01:21:39] right this one will
[01:21:42] go as actual singles because it's less
[01:21:44] than the uh the their limit
[01:21:47] for three of them so we'll run that as
[01:21:50] singles for those of you that want it
[01:21:52] and then what we're going to do is we're
[01:21:54] going to go and check we're going to use
[01:21:55] our checkins again and we're going to
[01:21:56] spin our wheel to see who is going to
[01:21:59] get a chance to uh get a single pull out
[01:22:04] our uh our pack
[01:22:06] there all right
[01:22:10] bye hey Squiggy how you doing my
[01:22:16] friend all right no one wanted this did
[01:22:19] not run we're going to run it again

[01:22:23] what I'm going to do is I'm going to get
[01:22:25] our all of our check-ins so do make sure
[01:22:27] you're checking
[01:22:30] in all right do make sure you're
[01:22:33] checking

[01:22:41] who gets the option here
[01:22:46] now we have
[01:22:49] currently 54 checkins compared to last
[01:22:53] time which is better we went up from 45
[01:22:55] to
[01:22:57] 54 so our poll ended I think everybody
[01:23:01] seems to like the new way we're doing it
[01:23:03] so we're going to do it this we're going
[01:23:04] to keep doing it for a little while
[01:23:06] we're going to run the spinner and see

[01:29:52] cards all right there's one of them that
[01:29:54] is a foil and if you pull out the foil
[01:29:56] we're going to end up giving away a pack
[01:29:58] of cards instead of singles all the time
[01:29:59] that are like not really worth much some
[01:30:01] people sometimes they're worth something
[01:30:03] sometimes they're not because the way I
[01:30:04] have it set up so instead I figured we'd
[01:30:06] do that and that way we're guaranteed
[01:30:07] we're going to give away something cool
[01:30:09] like modern Horizon lost Caverns or a
[01:30:12] sorcery is what you'll get a choice of
[01:30:14] between the three things and as we grow
[01:30:16] and the bigger we are it'll be bigger
[01:30:17] choices and as we grow maybe the uh the
[01:30:20] numbers of pet cards here drop
[01:30:22] down so there you go
[01:30:25] so last card was not it last card was an
[01:30:29] exceptional flood is what our last card
[01:30:32] was let's see where we were though

[01:38:45] cards every time there's 60 they always
[01:38:47] go in the box that hangs out right there
[01:38:48] so you'll see where they
[01:38:51] are and maybe one of these times we'll
[01:38:54] see I think what I'm going to do next is

[01:38:57] and see who from our checkins gets the
[01:38:59] chance to do that but I'm going to throw
[01:39:01] out another couple of singles first to
[01:39:03] see if anybody wants any we're gonna

[01:39:11] right that's not bad see kind of fun

[01:43:46] here you beat your uh the last thing you
[01:43:49] won against
[01:43:50] here in your adventure let me get to the
[01:43:53] right spot we
[01:43:58] have oh yes we got we went back with our
[01:44:01] treasure that we got we now have some
[01:44:03] health after that encounter there some
[01:44:05] health potions but you're going to
[01:44:07] continue on and you get back out of your
[01:44:09] boat you go over to
[01:44:12] uh the other
[01:44:15] uh keep wandering through your Island
[01:44:18] there because you got to find the end of
[01:44:19] what happens you don't want to just
[01:44:21] leave it there you know what I mean so
[01:44:24] you go and you see wandering around and
[01:44:25] you follow the
[01:44:27] map is it you're following the map a
[01:44:30] little bit more because you need to find
[01:44:31] one to the end of the map
[01:44:32] there you want into something that looks
[01:44:35] like it's an maybe it's an a little
[01:44:36] Oasis
[01:44:37] there oh look at that you see a little
[01:44:40] Oasis and a guardian at the Oasis how
[01:44:44] much health do you currently have you're
[01:44:46] currently
[01:44:50] at 103 Health out of 180 so you do have
[01:44:54] two health potions remember two health
[01:45:01] potions do you want to use one of
[01:45:04] those it's 180 and you have 103 Health
[01:45:09] now the health potions being those
[01:45:10] special potions will bring you back to
[01:45:12] full
[01:45:12] health now that is a good one you only
[01:45:15] have two of those though so you do want
[01:45:16] to use those sparingly make sure you do
[01:45:19] them correctly and
[01:45:21] appropriately I don't know
[01:45:25] so what are we going to do in our

[01:45:48] your weapons as your items to bring
[01:45:50] along and I'm going to zoom out a little
[01:45:52] bit zo out a little bit there so we can
[01:45:54] see everything going to go and talk to
[01:45:55] them all right so you go up and you
[01:45:57] start talking to this uh
[01:46:01] pirate uh looking person that has is
[01:46:05] guarding the
[01:46:06] Oasis they say we the guardian says I
[01:46:11] don't allow anybody to just come and

[01:46:32] around with you that you bought you got
[01:46:35] before from your items that you have in
[01:46:37] your

[01:47:00] some how about I give
[01:47:02] you three gold coins from my
[01:47:07] chest person at the encounter
[01:47:10] goes I don't know starts
[01:47:13] thinking to prove your worth I don't
[01:47:16] know you asking now all right they say
[01:47:18] and you ask you well she goes well
[01:47:20] that's a little low I'm expecting a bit
[01:47:22] more than that for getting some fresh
[01:47:23] water in an oasis she goes when you ask
[01:47:27] what is the uh what's how do I show my
[01:47:29] worth prove your worth well see
[01:47:35] uh see that thing over there on the uh
[01:47:39] waterfall that we have over there I need
[01:47:41] you to be able to shoot it with my
[01:47:43] gun take it knock it off if you can't in
[01:47:46] one
[01:47:48] shot well you do not get any water from
[01:47:52] here and I have have to fight
[01:47:58] you m to the mommy head that's
[01:48:02] correct mounted The Mummy head is on the
[01:48:04] boat correct mounted on the ship
[01:48:06] somewhere I haven't figured out where to
[01:48:08] mount The Mummy head but that's on his
[01:48:10] ship somewhere so what are you going to
[01:48:12] do with your encounter now you have a
[01:48:13] choice to pay a little bit more they
[01:48:15] didn't like three gold they thought it's
[01:48:17] worth more or you can
[01:48:20] uh try their thing there and see what
[01:48:22] happens
[01:48:26] happens it's up to you my
[01:48:30] friend now remember everybody we're
[01:48:33] going to have our giveaway thing going
[01:48:34] out here next in a
[01:48:36] second I'm going to see who gets a
[01:48:38] chance to get our
[01:48:42] giveaway the pirate yes I know we see
[01:48:46] what
[01:48:47] happens see what happens here
[01:48:56] uh yeah you can inspect the gun before
[01:48:58] you shoot it but they use the gun
[01:49:00] themselves as a weapon regularly so it's
[01:49:01] going to be in good condition it's their
[01:49:04] weapon so you don't need to worry about
[01:49:06] that it's in good
[01:49:11] condition so yeah you need to decide
[01:49:13] there what you want to
[01:49:16] do and we have
[01:49:19] um I don't even know what to do next
[01:49:21] here get some slow
[01:49:24] yeah let's see what we do next
[01:49:26] here we got to decide are we going to
[01:49:30] attack you can attack him still and try
[01:49:32] to just kill
[01:49:33] him it's the other thing you do I mean
[01:49:36] you are a pirate you are a good pirate
[01:49:37] but you can be a bad pirate you
[01:49:40] know so it is up to you on what you're
[01:49:43] going to do
[01:49:45] there I don't
[01:49:48] know Oblivion
[01:50:00] oh my so I'm going to throw
[01:50:05] out yes it is you inspect it and it's
[01:50:08] it's loaded to work correctly it is
[01:50:10] loaded and it will work correctly that
[01:50:12] is
[01:50:14] right let me see here going to find some
[01:50:17] more singles to throw out while we're
[01:50:18] hanging out
[01:50:20] here throw out some more singles while
[01:50:22] we're hanging out out
[01:50:41] maybe let's offer four or five gold
[01:50:44] instead all right I like that so you say
[01:50:47] hey will you take four gold instead
[01:50:54] they look at it the chest and go I don't
[01:50:56] know you got a lot of gold in there I
[01:50:57] think you can afford one more you're
[01:50:59] right fine so you gave her the five
[01:51:03] gold goes over and you take a drink from
[01:51:05] that water that's a good idea for tra
[01:51:07] trading for some of the gold there
[01:51:09] because now you are gone up to full
[01:51:11] health nice job I like it you take a
[01:51:14] drink from the water there you give them
[01:51:17] two gold and then as you're drinking

[01:56:55] how to say that but our foil was 31 32
[01:56:59] 33 34
[01:57:01] 35 35 would have been where you got the

[03:09:50] of you are going to choose a
[03:09:59] number no one want it at that
[03:10:03] time there we
[03:10:05] go going to do all of our check-ins and
[03:10:08] we are
[03:10:09] at 144 49 checkins you guys are killing
[03:10:14] it right today that means we're going to
[03:10:16] get close to giving away at the end of
[03:10:17] the stream no matter what the end of the
[03:10:19] stream we're going to give away
[03:10:20] something we're getting close to giving
[03:10:22] away a pack at the end of the stream
[03:10:23] because you guys running all your
[03:10:24] check-ins oh didn't mean to move that
[03:10:26] like
[03:10:28] that Oblivion
[03:10:30] wielder Wilder Oblivion Wilder I always
[03:10:33] say
[03:10:34] wielder Wilder I need you to type in a
[03:10:39] number between one and
[03:10:42] 60 H that's what happens I know Mr
[03:10:46] Fong we welder Oblivion wielder number
[03:10:52] 37 all right here we go number 37 was
[03:10:54] CHS by Oblivion here and then the next
[03:10:57] thing we're GNA do actually going to run
[03:10:59] one more I said we're GNA do run it
[03:11:01] again we're going to do two of you two
[03:11:03] of you get a choice so number
[03:11:05] 37 and then Captain scoop what number
[03:11:08] are we goingon to do here Captain
[03:11:09] scooter if you're still hanging out here
[03:11:12] one two three four five 6 7 8 9 10 10 11
[03:11:18] 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24
[03:11:23] 25 26 oh no it was number
[03:11:27] 26 it was number 26 we didn't get
[03:11:36] it because they are appearing on the
[03:11:38] wheel more than once all I do is take
[03:11:40] the check-ins that you do and I copy
[03:11:42] them so you will be on the wheel more
[03:11:44] than once if you checked in more than
[03:11:46] once
[03:11:48] so that's why I was doing it based on
[03:11:50] the check-ins and all this is is to see
[03:11:52] if we get the um what we do if we're
[03:11:54] going to pull out the thing for the
[03:11:55] giveaway because this isn't doing any of
[03:11:57] the giveaways yet what they're doing
[03:11:58] here is if we pull out the foil card
[03:12:01] like say captain scooter gives me the
[03:12:03] number and we pull out the foil card
[03:12:05] what's going to happen is you guys get a
[03:12:07] choice of one of these three packs of
[03:12:08] cards and I figured instead of me giving
[03:12:10] out singles all the time giving away
[03:12:12] packs of cards would be even more fun
[03:12:14] all right so that's why I need you guys
[03:12:15] to like And subscribe on YouTube so we
[03:12:17] can gain more stuff to
[03:12:22] do not doing anything for giveaways
[03:12:24] though it's not a
[03:12:27] giveaway that's the difference there is
[03:12:29] zero giveaway that I am doing but I
[03:12:31] appreciate it Tangerine this is not a
[03:12:33] giveaway that's being done at all what
[03:12:35] we're doing the giveaway will end up run
[03:12:38] for everyone when the giveaway is there
[03:12:41] this is not a giveaway this is just a
[03:12:43] choose this is just a randomization to
[03:12:45] see if somebody wants it's kind of like
[03:12:46] a game where somebody gets a choice a
[03:12:48] random number and then if they happen to
[03:12:51] get the number that we pull out so we
[03:12:53] get the uh one that says it's the
[03:12:55] giveaway for the pack then we do the
[03:12:57] regular giveaway for everyone that would
[03:12:59] show up that you would normally check
[03:13:01] into and do the giveaway for the
[03:13:06] pack but thank you Tangerine I actually
[03:13:09] that I did check I double checked on
[03:13:11] that with some of the stuff hey Oblivion
[03:13:14] you have a good one I appreciate you
[03:13:16] coming in hanging out out do very much
[03:13:18] appreciate
[03:13:20] that so there is actually zero giveaway
[03:13:23] occurring when you look at when we do
[03:13:24] that box there absolutely no giveaways
[03:13:27] are occurring at that
[03:13:31] time it's like a little game kind of
[03:13:34] like the adventure of the Pirate game
[03:13:35] the only difference is you choose a
[03:13:36] number between one and
[03:13:38] 60
[03:13:40] see nothing over the top there but what
[03:13:43] I'm going to do is I'm going to throw
[03:13:44] out some um
[03:13:47] what was it we wanted
[03:13:49] um somebody had asked about some cards
[03:13:52] here and I forgot what we were asked
[03:13:55] about we asked about some
[03:14:03] lizards I had I'm out of lizards I have
[03:14:06] rats Birds
[03:14:10] rabbits some
[03:14:14] frogs um and and I have a bunch of
[03:14:18] instants or maybe you guys want some um
[03:14:22] a chunk of instants there you go a chunk
[03:14:24] of instance from
[03:14:29] here yes I'm not running the giveaway
[03:14:32] specifically that's exactly
[03:14:36] right yes no I appreciate tangerine and
[03:14:39] that's literally the reason why I'm
[03:14:40] doing it the way I am because if I do it
[03:14:42] any other way I will get in trouble so I
[03:14:44] have to do it this way versus just
[03:14:47] the way I'd prefer to do it you know
[03:14:48] what I
[03:14:51] mean so there we go we're going to put
[03:14:53] this up here a false repack if you want
[03:14:56] some
[03:14:57] instance you know what I'm G to run that
[03:14:59] at $2 instead of $3 for some fast for a
[03:15:02] fast
[03:15:03] repack Annie joins up I do not have it
[03:15:06] in foil I think I have Annie joins up
[03:15:10] though but not in
[03:15:14] foil let me check though
[03:15:21] I don't think I don't think it's I think
[03:15:22] it's a non-foil that Annie joins up and
[03:15:25] that's Outlaws right if I'm thinking of
[03:15:28] the right
[03:15:43] one h
[03:15:52] no I'm not getting in trouble for
[03:15:56] anything no they uh I can't do things I
[03:15:59] want to do like if I want to do a game a
[03:16:01] certain way I can't because somebody
[03:16:03] will complain about it most likely so uh
[03:16:06] um tangarine just wanted me to be sure
[03:16:07] that I wasn't going to get in trouble
[03:16:08] with what I was doing with the giveaway
[03:16:09] thing here and I'm not really doing any
[03:16:11] giveaway at all the only thing I'm doing
[03:16:13] is you're participating in kind of like
[03:16:15] a game free game nothing special it's
[03:16:17] just game all you need to do is check in
[03:16:19] and it's a game no one makes any money
[03:16:21] no one gets anything from it you choose
[03:16:23] a number between one and 60 and if it
[03:16:25] happens to be the one that comes out
[03:16:26] that's the foil then we do the giveaway
[03:16:29] because you won the game kind of like
[03:16:31] what it is Outlaws yeah let me look here
[03:16:34] Annie joins yeah see I have Annie joins
[03:16:36] up in here but not in
[03:16:38] foil yeah not in foil but I do have this
[03:16:41] Annie joins
[03:16:44] up if you want it
[03:16:54] put that out and you can see that
[03:16:58] there the non foil now that's a $5 card
[03:17:03] $4 right
[03:17:07] there no I've not got trouble from your
[03:17:09] big mouth yet no one's done anything
[03:17:11] with that that one I can say I didn't
[03:17:13] notice it or whatever cuz I was
[03:17:14] streaming cuz I don't notice everybody's
[03:17:16] everything every types all the time
[03:17:17] because I am doing stuff I'm you know
[03:17:19] I'm putting things up to sell so I don't
[03:17:20] always get a chance to read everything
[03:17:22] in the
[03:17:25] comments there's only one time I've ever
[03:17:27] kicked somebody out and they said
[03:17:28] something
[03:17:29] inappropriate um derogatory quite
[03:17:32] frankly and that's when I was at that's
[03:17:34] the only time I I only kicked them out
[03:17:35] of the stream I didn't ban them
[03:17:37] personally I just banned them from the
[03:17:38] stream for that time

[03:18:21] wrong they ended up changing the rules
[03:18:23] and saying that I was in violation of

[03:28:38] Sandstorm to blow
[03:28:40] through the music in the background is
[03:28:42] killing me I'm having a hard time not
[03:28:43] laughing
[03:28:47] um
[03:28:52] so kind of like playing a little D and D
[03:28:54] game is what the pirate Adventure is
[03:28:56] here it's a little D and D game we play
[03:28:59] that's what the uh jumping in on the
[03:29:00] pirate Adventure
[03:29:01] does oh I have some memories from this
[03:29:04] so all right I'm gonna pause from the
[03:29:07] game here for a second the reason why
[03:29:09] I'm laughing so hard is uh I wrestled in
[03:29:12] high school and when I was in high
[03:29:14] school this is one of the songs that
[03:29:15] happened to be playing at one point and
[03:29:18] um we our team was our our team was a
[03:29:21] good team our coach was Olympics he was
[03:29:24] in the Olympics for Judo so he trained
[03:29:26] us we weren't just wrestlers we were
[03:29:28] trained to fight um so uh one team
[03:29:32] called up because they thought they had
[03:29:34] like this really good team and they were
[03:29:35] gonna beat us and so we get in there we
[03:29:38] all right whatever we'll go match have a
[03:29:40] match with anybody we don't care we'll
[03:29:41] we'll we'll have a wrestling match with
[03:29:42] anyone the 14 of us whatever so the
[03:29:44] varsity team goes over it was like an
[03:29:46] hour and a half drive we get to this
[03:29:48] school and we're doing our warm-ups and
[03:29:51] all of a sudden the lights turn off in
[03:29:52] the gym and we're like what the [ __ ] is
[03:29:54] going on and this and this song comes on
[03:29:59] this song comes on and their wrestling
[03:30:01] TOS running out in their hoods in their
[03:30:03] sweat shoots
[03:30:05] on all their hoods pull down they start
[03:30:07] running around the circle the mat doing
[03:30:10] their song doing some push-ups doing
[03:30:12] some sit-ups doing their warm-ups to the
[03:30:14] song and I'm like oh my God all of us
[03:30:16] start [ __ ] laughing I'm not going to
[03:30:18] lie not one of them beat anybody on our
[03:30:22] team they were lucky all of them didn't
[03:30:24] get pinned only one of them didn't get
[03:30:26] pinned I think two of them actually
[03:30:27] might not have gotten pinned but I was
[03:30:29] like come on guys seriously what what
[03:30:32] did guys like they come out like running
[03:30:35] with their hoods heads down
[03:30:38] like oh my God it was the funniest thing
[03:30:40] I ever saw and we just toed on them
[03:30:43] because they came out like that my coach
[03:30:45] was like my coach Le pulled this all
[03:30:47] together and he goes [ __ ] destroy
[03:30:49] them this is
[03:30:50] [ __ ] so we destroyed
[03:30:55] them I mean I think that year we were
[03:30:58] the number one team in the state we
[03:30:59] didn't lose any match we actually have
[03:31:02] the only title in the state to be
[03:31:04] undefeated in Massachusetts so it was
[03:31:07] kind of
[03:31:10] funny but anyways anyways we'll go back
[03:31:14] to the other stuff
[03:31:19] so there we go that was that that's my
[03:31:21] story that's my
[03:31:24] story these kids they the coach and the
[03:31:26] kids thought they were the greatest
[03:31:27] things since sliced bread they were
[03:31:28] gonna do something awesome they all got
[03:31:30] [ __ ] pinned except for two and I
[03:31:33] think the two that got pinned was the
[03:31:35] guy that was the best one on the team
[03:31:36] who was in Nationals and won nationals
[03:31:38] three years in a row got second place as
[03:31:41] freshman year because his family were
[03:31:42] Judo Champions and the Olympics were Jud
[03:31:44] his father was in the Olympics and his
[03:31:45] brother were the Olympics for Judo
[03:31:47] actually when I Judo when I was in high
[03:31:48] school so he was going to go to the
[03:31:50] Olympics himself I think he just played
[03:31:52] with one of the people just so that he
[03:31:53] could get more experience playing around
[03:31:55] and didn't pin him and that was
[03:31:56] literally the only reason he didn't pin
[03:31:57] him in like 10 seconds or less so I
[03:32:00] don't know
[03:32:01] anyways that's my that's my story
[03:32:04] there that's why I was having a hard
[03:32:07] time when Sandstorm was going not
[03:32:09] laughing the entire
[03:32:11] time well you decide to go and look in
[03:32:15] that little
[03:32:16] in that
[03:32:26] cave and you find something in that
[03:32:28] Treasure Chest you go wandering a little
[03:32:31] bit further in you're like what is this
[03:32:33] thing that I over here we're we're in
[03:32:35] here for a little bit we got to watch
[03:32:36] out for that storm because that storm's
[03:32:38] coming through and it's going to take us
[03:32:39] out so you all decide to go a little
[03:32:41] wandering further into that cave and the
[03:32:44] further you go into the cave it's starts
[03:32:46] whining further you're a little
[03:32:47] dangerous you're worried but all of a
[03:32:49] sudden you see something

[03:33:25] entire B the entire chest there was
[03:33:29] going to trap I was going to go off and

[03:41:00] know what happened so I um long story
[03:41:03] short I had anemia issue that was
[03:41:05] causing me to die that the doctors in
[03:41:07] New England did ignored until I moved
[03:41:09] down to Florida and they actually paid
[03:41:10] attention to it and um found out that I
[03:41:13] needed some surgery to fix it well I
[03:41:15] lost a lot of weight to the point that I
[03:41:16] looked like kind of like a look like a
[03:41:19] walking skeleton started gaining weight
[03:41:21] back finally after they fixed me and
[03:41:24] then Mystic thank you my friend oh I got
[03:41:25] a bag for you I don't know why I'm doing
[03:41:26] that and then once they fixed it
[03:41:31] um I kind of went back to my old younger
[03:41:34] self where I
[03:41:37] uh I started losing weight a lot of
[03:41:40] weight it was almost like I had my body
[03:41:42] went back to after like 15 years of
[03:41:44] losing blood through a position you
[03:41:46] shouldn't be losing it they decide my
[03:41:49] body decided oh my it now knows how to
[03:41:50] function normally and work normally so
[03:41:53] now I'm like I wake up in four hours I
[03:41:55] can't sleep longer than four hours
[03:41:58] sometimes five if I'm if I do a lot and
[03:42:01] then I am also in like I have also a ton
[03:42:04] of energy generally unless I do
[03:42:05] something ridiculous and then I have to
[03:42:09] eat a ton of food I'm hungry all the
[03:42:11] time because if I don't I drop my weight
[03:42:12] down from like like 165 down to one like
[03:42:16] 58 if I don't drink a milkshake every
[03:42:18] day it's the craziest thing in the world
[03:42:22] but I know in about three years it's
[03:42:23] probably going to change and that
[03:42:24] milkshake will just become fat donut
[03:42:26] around
[03:42:27] me all right I don't know another codec
[03:42:29] Shredder I figured I'd throw out in case
[03:42:31] somebody wanted
[03:42:33] it hey you know what that's gonna go
[03:42:36] away though I know it is because it's
[03:42:37] I'm gonna be like my dad see he was very
[03:42:40] he did all kinds of stuff and he was
[03:42:41] active and he was a thin person in shape
[03:42:43] in his 30s well into his mid 40s then um
[03:42:47] then he had a Cancer and had something t
[03:42:48] t out of him out of his tongue then
[03:42:50] after that later on he ended up having
[03:42:53] um he started drinking his milkshakes
[03:42:55] and eating his ice cream more at the end
[03:42:56] of the day yeah he got a nice pot belly
[03:42:59] that's in up that's probably what I'm
[03:43:01] gonna end up having at some point if I
[03:43:02] don't continue to exercise and and do
[03:43:05] stuff but I exercise a lot I run around
[03:43:07] I play with the kids I swim and if we're
[03:43:09] going to be on a boat going to be

[04:02:22] give me a second
[04:02:23] here because I think I
[04:02:30] have someone liking dogs
[04:02:39] there we have some cats
[04:02:44] people are asking about cats I'll put
[04:02:45] some cats off to the side cat dragon
[04:02:50] cats ah here we
[04:02:54] go some
[04:02:57] dragons put those off the side too
[04:03:01] jinm all
[04:03:02] right so this is what I was going to
[04:03:05] look at this is what I was coming to
[04:03:06] look for specifically were these
[04:03:14] for these
[04:03:17] specifically now does anybody
[04:03:21] need certain amount of
[04:03:23] alrais because we have them all
[04:03:26] organized here we have void pouncer
[04:03:28] spawn gain Commander ring chrysis Titans
[04:03:31] Vanguard and a snapping void claw so
[04:03:33] what I was going to do was because
[04:03:36] these are literally duplicates of each
[04:03:39] one all right I'm going to say
[04:03:44] you get one of each of these as the
[04:03:47] repack so I'm going to put one of each
[04:03:49] of these together for you each of these
[04:03:51] lse
[04:03:52] dry for a repack for
[04:03:56] you all
[04:03:59] right so a fast repack for you for some
[04:04:02] alrais and we'll throw six different
[04:04:04] alrais in there well I only have three
[04:04:06] right now I'll add an extra and you get
[04:04:08] one of each of those elrazi zoom in so
[04:04:11] you can see them actually probably makes
[04:04:13] it easier
[04:04:16] there you
[04:04:18] go no all right we didn't like that
[04:04:20] options so I'll put that away thought
[04:04:22] that might have been something
[04:04:23] worthwhile but we'll
[04:04:25] see not
[04:04:27] today all right let's see what else we
[04:04:29] got
[04:04:30] here let's

[04:23:07] some of these and if you guys need any
[04:23:08] let me know here I'm just gonna kind of
[04:23:10] scroll through them and if you want them
[04:23:11] let me know here hey well let me know
[04:23:14] what we should do here it's up to you
[04:23:17] guys what we should do for our our 1K
[04:23:20] giveaway here my wife seems to think
[04:23:22] that we should change it up and have the
[04:23:25] 1K giveaway be the um my Xbox since
[04:23:28] we're not gonna be bringing it we were
[04:23:29] gonna either sell it here or like give
[04:23:30] it away to someone so I was like she
[04:23:32] goes you should just give it away on the
[04:23:33] stream to somebody I'm
[04:23:35] like that might work I think I can do
[04:23:41] that so
[04:23:43] if you need any of these let me know we
[04:23:46] have a lot of these going around
[04:23:50] here run two different giveaways oh I
[04:23:53] don't know if I can do two different
[04:23:54] ones for it for it it would have to be
[04:23:56] just uh we'd probably just be the
[04:24:00] one because that's what we do we do the
[04:24:02] One giveaway for it maybe we can do the
[04:24:06] we would hold one of them off for
[04:24:08] another giveaway later so maybe they say
[04:24:10] I take the modern Horizon pack and what
[04:24:12] I do is I use it as a way for me to
[04:24:17] um do a giveaway later a my sus freezing
[04:24:23] seriously let me
[04:24:25] see I could do something like this I
[04:24:29] think if I get to 4,000 followers on
[04:24:34] whatnot here I can do it as I do the
[04:24:36] collector booster and then if I get to
[04:24:38] 1,000 followers on YouTube I can do the
[04:24:41] Xbox something like
[04:24:45] that I don't know it's freezing why does
[04:24:49] it keep freezing there's no reason for
[04:24:51] this to
[04:24:52] freeze it's because the internet is
[04:24:54] being worked on and [ __ ] around here
[04:24:55] but anyways I was showing these off if
[04:24:58] anybody needs any that's what I was

[04:31:25] of you here but uh definitely am um
[04:31:30] unsure of how it's going to be it seems
[04:31:33] a
[04:31:34] confusing not sure how the set's going
[04:31:36] to go is what I'm kind of getting at not
[04:31:38] sure how the set's going to go
[04:31:42] I'm a little unsure on it what do you
[04:31:45] guys all think
[04:31:51] though go through these and need
[04:31:53] anything let me
[04:31:55] know put them off the side with your
[04:31:57] name on it but we are looking for
[04:32:01] some creatures of
[04:32:08] Gandalf I don't remember where they all
[04:32:10] are and what parts of them they are part
[04:32:12] of so I have to go through more than I
[04:32:17] want Gand friend of the Shire oh there's
[04:32:19] a couple of them but there's the same
[04:32:28] ones rats out of
[04:32:30] bloo hey well
[04:32:32] master I have rats if you want them out
[04:32:35] of
[04:32:36] bloomo set off and organized for you as
[04:32:41] rats
[04:32:43] give me one second look at this look at
[04:32:46] this thing I did here
[04:33:14] all right
[04:33:15] so these are what I call the fos
[04:33:19] repacks all
[04:33:22] right you
[04:33:28] have nice the TV boxing that's kind of
[04:33:32] cool so say you want some rats you got a
[04:33:36] rat squirrel and a bunch of rats I call
[04:33:38] these fos repacks they are just a bunch
[04:33:41] of certain kinds so if you want rats
[04:33:43] there's some rats right there for you I
[04:33:46] also have two other fos
[04:33:51] repacks that we
[04:33:53] did of
[04:33:56] these
[04:33:58] rats rat Rogue rat squirrel W rat
[04:34:03] whatever but we did a little
[04:34:06] uh chunk of them here so you get some
[04:34:10] rats and they repack all
[04:34:13] right so if you want some rats out of
[04:34:17] the set I'm going to run on this one
[04:34:20] right
[04:34:21] here for you if you want it for some

[04:34:55] it out there in case you
[04:34:57] did all right you guys want to have this
[04:35:00] The Collector booster instead of the um
[04:35:04] XBox I looks like all right it's
[04:35:08] okay we will do that instead of the XY
[04:35:11] maybe we'll use the Xbox at some other
[04:35:13] point I don't know we'll find out but
[04:35:16] looks like that's what we'll end up
[04:35:20] doing all righty here so no one wanted
[04:35:24] our
[04:35:29] rats we go put the rats back put the rat
[04:35:32] packs
[04:35:34] back intrig all right here's our Gand
[04:35:38] off let's see what else we got for Gand
[04:35:41] off here
[04:35:43] I can put some of them aside I can do
[04:35:45] that for

[04:36:07] that okay
[04:36:16] let's see what else we

[04:37:09] know it could be something that somebody
[04:37:11] else wants while I'm looking through
[04:37:13] it so that's why I kind of why I'm still
[04:37:15] doing it because I figure there'll be

A lego military soldier goes on a magical adventure. The character goes through the magical land where they are finding helpful items along the way. That could be things like hot dogs, weapons and even friends from star wars that can help them and give them items like lightsabers to fight bosses. Sometimes items and people they meet do not help them and harm them. They could be trickster, people/legos that harm them. You need to ask me about the game while creating it for specific items and bosses that will be used. Make the game 2 hours long, but each stage in the game will only be three minutes or less. Make sure the entire game is lego based.

[00:01:19] bit of a break nothing
[00:01:22] major try to do a box for a pull box for
[00:01:26] tomorrow because people have been
[00:01:27] requesting it so I figured all right all
[00:01:30] right maybe I'll do
[00:01:32] one do one of those requests just at
[00:01:36] request mainly the reason
[00:01:38] why how's it going there in
[00:01:43] chat says chat rate why am I not seeing
[00:01:49] it why am I not seeing the
[00:01:53] chat live chat showing me all the
[00:01:55] messages
[00:02:00] so weird right here by the
[00:02:02] way why is it not showing me the
[00:02:07] chat huh H
[00:02:15] whatever handing out the commons and the
[00:02:21] uncommons this is top chat so instead of
[00:02:24] top chat I want all
[00:02:26] it I don't know yeah we'll see
[00:02:30] maybe there's no one in chat and it just

how do I make a custom rounding in google sheets?

[2025-03-26 19:25:08] ChatGPT:
To make **custom rounding in Google Sheets**, you can use formulas that give you more control than the built-in `ROUND`, `ROUNDUP`, or `ROUNDDOWN`. Here are a few custom approaches depending on your goal:

---

### 1. **Round to the Nearest X (e.g., 0.25, 5, 100, etc.)**
Use this structure:
```excel
=ROUND(A1 / X) * X
```

#### Example: Round to the nearest 0.25
```excel
=ROUND(A1 / 0.25) * 0.25
```

---

### 2. **Custom Rounding Up or Down**
- **Round up to nearest multiple:**
```excel
=CEILING(A1, 5)  // rounds A1 up to the nearest 5
```

- **Round down to nearest multiple:**
```excel
=FLOOR(A1, 5)  // rounds A1 down to the nearest 5
```

---

### 3. **Conditional Rounding Rules (e.g., round under 1 to 0, over 1 to nearest .5)**
```excel
=IF(A1 < 1, 0, ROUND(A1 * 2, 0) / 2)
```

---

### 4. **Custom Function Using Apps Script**
If you want something extremely custom (like rounding based on tiered rules), you can use:
- Go to **Extensions > Apps Script**.
- Paste in a custom function:

```javascript
function customRound(value) {
  if (value < 1) {
    return 0;
  } else if (value < 5) {
    return Math.round(value * 2) / 2;
  } else {
    return Math.round(value / 5) * 5;
  }
}
```

Then use in your sheet:
```excel
=CUSTOMROUND(A1)
```

---

Let me know your exact rounding rule if you'd like me to write a specific formula for your case.

i want to round anything that has a .35 or higher to the next number up instead of from .5 up.

[2025-03-26 19:26:35] ChatGPT:
Perfect — you're basically customizing how `ROUND()` behaves by shifting the threshold **upward** to `.35` instead of the default `.5`. Here's how to do that in Google Sheets:

---

### ✅ **Custom Rounding Up at `.35`**

Use this formula:
```excel
=IF(A1 - INT(A1) >= 0.35, INT(A1) + 1, INT(A1))
```

#### 🔍 Breakdown:
- `INT(A1)` grabs the whole number (like `FLOOR()`).
- `A1 - INT(A1)` gets the decimal portion.
- If that decimal is `.35` or higher, it adds 1 to the integer (rounds up).
- Otherwise, it keeps it as-is (rounds down).

---

### 🧪 Examples:
| A1       | Result |
|----------|--------|
| 3.12     | 3      |
| 3.34     | 3      |
| 3.35     | 4 ✅    |
| 3.5      | 4      |
| 7.88     | 8      |

Want me to turn it into a custom `=ROUND35()` Apps Script function for easier reuse across your sheet?

[2025-03-26 19:28:38] FoSGamers:
my number is in colulmn h and have numbers from 399.99 to 0.01

[2025-03-26 19:28:40] ChatGPT:
Thanks! Since your values are in **Column H**, and you want to apply the custom rounding (round up if decimal part is `.35` or more), here's how to do it directly in another column — say **Column I** — to show the rounded result:

---

### ✅ **Formula for Column I (next to Column H):**
In cell `I1` (or wherever your first row of data is), use:
```excel
=IF(H1 - INT(H1) >= 0.35, INT(H1) + 1, INT(H1))
```

Then **drag down** the formula for all your rows.

---

### 🧠 Optional: Round and Replace in Column H
If you want to replace the original values in Column H with the rounded versions:
1. Copy the formula results from Column I.
2. Paste them back into Column H as **"Paste special > Values only"**.

---

Let me know if you want this turned into an Apps Script to round the entire column in-place with one click, or automatically on edit.

[2025-03-26 19:30:53] FoSGamers:
Error
Function INT parameter 1 expects number values. But 'Purchase price' is a text and cannot be coerced to a number.

[2025-03-26 19:30:58] ChatGPT:
Ah, yep — that happens when your column contains **text instead of numbers**, even if the values *look* like numbers (e.g., `"399.99"` instead of `399.99`). Here's how to fix that:

---

### ✅ **Fix the Formula for Text-to-Number Conversion**

Update your formula like this:
```excel
=IF(VALUE(H1) - INT(VALUE(H1)) >= 0.35, INT(VALUE(H1)) + 1, INT(VALUE(H1)))
```

This wraps `H1` in `VALUE()`, which **forces text to convert into a number**.

---

### 💡 Tips:
- If your sheet imports data from elsewhere (CSV, forms, etc.), numbers often come in as text. `VALUE()` is your best friend here.
- Once you’ve verified the formula works, you can drag it down or convert the output back into Column H if needed.

Want a script to apply this to the entire column and overwrite the values automatically? I can whip that up too.

[2025-03-26 19:32:02] FoSGamers:
it starts on column 2. column 1 is the heading.

[2025-03-26 19:32:04] ChatGPT:
Perfect! Since your data starts on **row 2 of Column H** (because **row 1 has the header**, like "Purchase Price"), here's your final working formula for **cell I2** (or wherever your result column begins):

---

### ✅ **Custom Rounding at 0.35 — Formula for Row 2:**
```excel
=IF(VALUE(H2) - INT(VALUE(H2)) >= 0.35, INT(VALUE(H2)) + 1, INT(VALUE(H2)))
```

---

### 🪄 What to Do:
1. Paste that into `I2`.
2. Drag it **down** to apply it to the rest of the rows.

---

### 📌 Optional — Replace Original Column:
- Select all values from Column I (the rounded numbers).
- Right-click > **Copy**
- Right-click on `H2` > **Paste special → Values only**
- Done! Now Column H is updated with the custom rounding.

---

Let me know if you want:
- A column auto-fill script
- A version that formats the output (like currency)
- This turned into a custom `=ROUND35(H2)` function

I'm happy to do it!

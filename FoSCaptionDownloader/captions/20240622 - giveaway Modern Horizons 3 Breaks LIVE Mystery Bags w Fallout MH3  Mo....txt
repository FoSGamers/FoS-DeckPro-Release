[00:35:50] that sound

[00:36:06] know and if I have them I can um I can
[00:36:08] try to get them for you we have that one
[00:36:11] there and then this is what we got to do
[00:36:14] for you my friend since you are opening
[00:36:18] the box of sorcery here you're going to
[00:36:22] get the box topper or the promo pack or
[00:36:26] whatever you want I call it you know
[00:36:28] what I mean I'm going to put this off
[00:36:30] the side though that way I can get
[00:36:35] to it later when I need to use it and
[00:36:38] open
[00:36:39] it aha all right so how's that for a
[00:36:42] deal for you you also get the promo
[00:36:43] thing on
[00:36:45] top so you'll get that in the
[00:36:48] promo alrazy and the bird I have a the I
[00:36:52] have a few natus so yeah if you need
[00:36:53] that and I have that I have a few all
[00:36:55] alrais depending on which one
[00:36:59] you're very welcome hobo reunion I like
[00:37:01] seeing sorcery open so I'm a little I'll
[00:37:03] do those for deals if we do multiple
[00:37:08] packs all right here we go I just kind
[00:37:10] of like seeing sorcery open that's part
[00:37:12] of the reason why nice let's get to
[00:37:16] sorcery emerle yeah I have those I have
[00:37:19] um I think I have both of those oh yeah
[00:37:20] it's really fun have you played at at
[00:37:22] all because if you play you should
[00:37:24] follow us on Discord um it's in the uh
[00:37:26] show notes there you can jump in on that
[00:37:28] and get that to go in there
[00:37:36] way collector boosters um collector
[00:37:39] boosters are not guaranteed PS they're
[00:37:41] they're uh they're actually like $45
[00:37:43] cards they're actually cheaper than
[00:37:44] packs here with
[00:37:46] me but we're going to open some of these
[00:37:49] and you're going to get this my friend
[00:37:51] and then one of the things we need to do
[00:37:52] here is because I guess we have to
[00:37:53] shuffle these up because my
[00:37:54] understanding is these don't get
[00:37:55] shuffled well so we got to zoom zoom out
[00:37:57] a little
[00:37:58] bit ah yeah you should um you should
[00:38:01] jump in on my check the channel there I
[00:38:03] mean check the Discord out then we can
[00:38:05] do some um we can do
[00:38:09] some try some games maybe so I've been
[00:38:11] having a hard time finding people around
[00:38:12] here to play because not too many people
[00:38:15] play so what we got to do here is my
[00:38:17] understanding is I need to shuffle these
[00:38:18] up a little bit because they don't come
[00:38:19] out evenly and we don't want to get like
[00:38:22] I guess people can either not get a
[00:38:23] batch of absolutely nothing for a while
[00:38:25] or they can get stuff for a bunch of
[00:38:28] things so we kind of like to shuffle the
[00:38:30] packs up a little bit then put them back
[00:38:35] in all right that's what we're going to
[00:38:38] kind of do
[00:38:41] here shuffle them up together that way
[00:38:44] we can uh have them spread out and
[00:38:46] there's no like giant clumps of things
[00:38:50] hopefully hopefully that's what we're
[00:38:53] trying to make it do
[00:39:00] all right that looks like a shuffled
[00:39:02] enough let's put them back in here then
[00:39:05] we're going to
[00:39:06] go to
[00:39:08] seeing what ones you want because that
[00:39:11] one was right there from the last one
[00:39:13] you can tell me whichever where you want
[00:39:15] to go randomly in
[00:39:18] here for what we got guys I've been told
[00:39:22] by a few different people that they are
[00:39:25] all um stuffed on and sometimes in pack
[00:39:28] and and like a bunch of area so it's
[00:39:30] like say one person will get a bunch of
[00:39:31] nothing because they pick a stack versus
[00:39:34] trying to get some of everything you
[00:39:35] know what I mean so I try to give you
[00:39:36] guys option there clumps of uniques yes
[00:39:40] pick my friend all right we're gonna go
[00:39:41] with I like the middle we're do this one
[00:39:45] this one you're also going to get this
[00:39:47] because you open that one you got it
[00:39:49] here oh this SI feels good my kids tell
[00:39:52] me if there is
[00:39:54] a warm pack or a tingle that that's a
[00:39:57] good one there all right we're going to
[00:39:58] put those back over here so I can get to
[00:40:02] them later as needed there we
[00:40:06] go and we're going to do this with our
[00:40:09] sorcery let's see what we get we're g
[00:40:11] going to open these up I'm I'm guessing
[00:40:13] yes oh dude you get well jump in yeah go
[00:40:16] in the show notes check out the um check
[00:40:18] out the the channel there and you can
[00:40:20] jump in we'll set something enough to
[00:40:21] play you should be getting enough uh if
[00:40:24] you don't have enough to play I mean um

[00:57:27] don't know all the sorcery as much as I
[00:57:29] know magic for their

[01:34:06] it's
[01:34:09] it yes I'm gonna try to do it on the
[01:34:12] boat as best I can because my plan would
[01:34:14] be actually I have a little bit of a
[01:34:16] plan I'm talking to a couple people on
[01:34:17] some things I get I might actually going
[01:34:19] to try to get a little sore running
[01:34:21] running that way I could have some stuff
[01:34:22] there then I'm going to have another
[01:34:24] person helping me out in this store
[01:34:25] where I'll be doing this stuff U myself
[01:34:28] but they will help with the opening of
[01:34:29] things that type of stuff and um or I'll
[01:34:32] be doing it on the boat special things
[01:34:33] and special like certain ones we'll do a

[01:34:54] but yes I do have a plan to doing it on
[01:34:56] the boat

[01:48:55] you have to say something I can try to

[01:48:59] them out within a day or two that way
[01:49:01] the I get I don't get dinged by
[01:49:03] whatnot because whatnot has been very
[01:49:05] stickler on things recently put it this
[01:49:06] way they used to be able if somebody
[01:49:08] lied about stuff and a review they take
[01:49:10] it down now they don't care about it
[01:49:11] anymore like seriously they let they let
[01:49:13] lying occur it's a problem there you
[01:49:16] go nice one my friend then we're gon to
[01:49:19] throw out the oaner
[01:49:23] again for a dollar you just saw it
[01:49:25] pulled out of a pack there you go they
[01:49:29] are ridiculously strict with the uh
[01:49:31] sellers so that's why I can't do certain
[01:49:34] things like I can't even combine I used
[01:49:35] to combine um like games say somebody
[01:49:39] wanted to do two pull boxes I'd combine
[01:49:40] them and put them together do pull box
[01:49:43] Deluxe pull box and all pull box because
[01:49:45] that's what they wanted but now if I do
[01:49:47] that if I don't have the exact thing for
[01:49:50] what the ceiling floor and whatever
[01:49:52] could be in there
[01:49:53] an average and I don't have it in there
[01:49:54] correctly I'm going to get suspended for
[01:49:56] a week and I'm like seriously that so
[01:49:58] it's like ridiculous it's just I have to
[01:50:00] I have to do things perfect so I can't
[01:50:02] get in trouble that's really what it
[01:50:03] blows down

[01:53:24] got might actually almost be free now
[01:53:27] I'm not 100% sure we'll have to figure
[01:53:28] that out but I it might be close to
[01:53:32] it hey
[01:53:35] affordable how's it going my
[01:53:38] friend I haven't seen you in here for a
[01:53:40] little bit I just uh where'd you
[01:53:46] go here you go Pablo you got your gy and
[01:53:49] what we're going to do next is Slash gby
[01:53:52] GI IV y all right I have to change my
[01:53:55] goals now it's going to be 1,000 viewers
[01:53:58] Oh I thought I forgot to change it
[01:54:39] there you go let's correct
[01:54:40] that
[01:54:45] ah I do have it on some things not
[01:54:49] everything so depending on what I'm
[01:54:51] doing it will go to flat rate
[01:54:53] um most of the times it doesn't unless
[01:54:56] it is a uh it'll go to Flat Rate um for
[01:55:01] certain items that I do but a lot of
[01:55:03] times I try to do it where like the pack
[01:55:04] is a lower amount so it's like kind of
[01:55:07] like as close to being a um Weight Wise
[01:55:10] so that you can buy one pack and you can
[01:55:11] do it where you set it where if you add
[01:55:13] them together it'll go up to like three
[01:55:15] packs and then it makes a certain weight
[01:55:16] or something like that and then um so
[01:55:18] that's like the amount that you can do
[01:55:20] before it goes on to being like a new
[01:55:22] like a new um package or something but I
[01:55:24] had to go ver through it a little
[01:55:28] bit oh she's going to catch you oh
[01:55:35] no well you do it do it let don't let

[03:11:44] though is they had to lay a bunch of
[03:11:45] people off at the beginning of the year
[03:11:47] I think what they did was they you're

[03:11:51] was they um they laid off uh like the
[03:11:54] top brung and I was left with a person
[03:11:56] that wasn't necessarily in that top rung
[03:11:58] and that's where uh that's where I got
[03:12:00] stuck with and uh yeah just that's what
[03:12:03] happened and so
[03:12:07] uh I'm doing our own thing though and
[03:12:09] what I'm going to do is um like the top

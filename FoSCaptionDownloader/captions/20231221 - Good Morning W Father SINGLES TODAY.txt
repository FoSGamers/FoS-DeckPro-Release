[00:12:07] auction yeah it has been recently oh
[00:12:10] there's an issue the operation can't be
[00:12:11] completed we're having so I don't know
[00:12:14] what I'm going to be able to do I can
[00:12:15] just do buy now so it looks like my
[00:12:17] auctions are not working today and I

[00:12:24] really sucks you know what actually let
[00:12:25] me see if I can add a buy now for
[00:12:27] something maybe
[00:12:29] maybe
[00:12:32] um maybe I can do a buy now for
[00:12:34] something hey everybody I don't know if
[00:12:36] anyone else is having issues but whatnot
[00:12:38] is currently not allowing me to run any
[00:12:40] auctions so I am going to uh just put
[00:12:44] things in the buy now if you want to
[00:12:46] check it out from there but there are a
[00:12:47] lot of packs and stuff in buy now right
[00:12:49] now just uh I'll I'll end up doing some
[00:12:52] of the things that are um I'll end up
[00:12:56] changing over some of the auctions that
[00:12:58] I have have into buy Nows
[00:13:04] instead hey how's the hoarders how you
[00:13:06] doing thanks coming in hanging
[00:13:08] out yeah I'm trying to do auctions to be
[00:13:11] able to do like pack deals and stuff but
[00:13:13] it won't even let me do auctions right
[00:13:16] now um I keep getting socket errors I
[00:13:20] think
[00:13:22] uh I think uh what not's having some
[00:13:24] problems
[00:13:27] again
[00:13:30] it's all of whatnot Oh yay oh look at
[00:13:32] that something just started who knows if
[00:13:35] that's actually correct one of them
[00:13:36] shown on one of them it's not shown
[00:13:38] anywhere how's oh damn it that sucks all
[00:13:42] of whatnot is having an issue right now
[00:13:44] that really
[00:13:45] stinks I figured it was going to be all
[00:13:47] whatnot when I was having an issue hey
[00:13:50] mysterious
[00:13:51] stranger just hanging out here trying to
[00:13:55] trying to do my thing but the uh auction
[00:13:59] feature is not working right now and
[00:14:01] whatnot so uh what I'm going to ask you
[00:14:04] guys to do instead of because I can't
[00:14:07] put a billion things in the buy now as
[00:14:10] um pack deals or whatever look at what I
[00:14:12] got in buy now I'm going to throw up I
[00:14:15] have Exelon Brothers
[00:14:17] War March
[00:14:20] machine Lord of the Rings by rexia just
[00:14:24] let me know if there's anything you want
[00:14:25] and I'll throw a deal in the buy now
[00:14:27] because I think I can still add to buy
[00:14:29] now and you can purchase from there so
[00:14:33] let me know if you want to try that and
[00:14:34] I'll throw a pack deal in there for you
[00:14:36] if that's what you're looking
[00:14:38] for or maybe you know what hey I think I
[00:14:42] can add Buy now is still in there so I'm
[00:14:44] going to go through my singles that I
[00:14:46] have since uh that's all I can kind of
[00:14:50] do and I'll put you know what I'm gonna
[00:14:51] move over my you know what I'm going to
[00:14:54] do for the time being I'm editing this
[00:14:56] item I'm going to make this a buy now
[00:15:01] I'm making my nine Exelon PS a buy now
[00:15:04] for the
[00:15:05] moment and I'm going to put a bunch of
[00:15:07] the things as buy Nows that way you can
[00:15:10] go in for those deals there and check
[00:15:13] them out there if you want as a buy now
[00:15:18] okay and then that way you can
[00:15:22] um you can actually per purchase the
[00:15:25] pack deals or the uh the pull box deals
[00:15:28] as much as you want for the most part I
[00:15:30] think that still allows you to do it
[00:15:36] there so let me let me do that let me do
[00:15:42] that I'm just going to move all these
[00:15:44] over to buy now for now right now just
[00:15:48] give me a second you should be able to
[00:15:49] find all these in the buy
[00:15:57] now
[00:15:59] you should all be able to see everything
[00:16:01] in the buy it now instead of the
[00:16:02] auctions that I normally do as auctions
[00:16:05] I'm putting them in the buy now instead
[00:16:07] so at least we can do him for the time
[00:16:09] being I don't normally do this in the
[00:16:11] buy now because I like to run them all
[00:16:13] as auctions and stuff here but I'm
[00:16:16] putting them over there for the time
[00:16:17] being since the um auction feature
[00:16:19] doesn't seem to be
[00:16:20] working so let's do
[00:16:25] that let's do that let's move those
[00:16:29] [Music]
[00:16:33] over all of those are almost moved over
[00:16:41] [Music]
[00:16:47] now all
[00:16:57] right
[00:16:59] and we have I think that's everything I
[00:17:02] can do because I can't really do packs
[00:17:04] on screen just tell me what you want and
[00:17:06] I'll throw it in the buy now hey
[00:17:08] Daniel let's see if I can run hey I've
[00:17:10] been having some whatnots having issues
[00:17:13] here so hey all right we got something
[00:17:16] running right now let's see if this is
[00:17:17] still going to work at the
[00:17:19] moment so we're going to do for right
[00:17:21] now $1 for a couple of singles just to
[00:17:24] see if this is working because all of
[00:17:26] whatnot wasn't working for a little bit
[00:17:28] so $1 for a

[00:50:20] boox
[00:50:21] deal
[00:50:23] quickly well I figure
[00:50:26] out actually you know what I think it's
[00:50:29] time for the singles I'm So Young not
[00:50:30] used to doing it I think it's time for
[00:50:32] the
[00:50:33] singles all right we
[00:50:37] have a couple of carpet of flowers you
[00:50:40] know what I'll throw the mythro coat on
[00:50:43] there at
[00:50:44] five we have carpet of flowers extended
[00:50:49] art carpet of
[00:50:52] flowers foil and a mithil coat surge
[00:50:58] foil
[00:51:02] $5 for one of
[00:51:04] those if you would like to try your luck
[00:51:06] on
[00:51:08] those turn the camera a little bit so
[00:51:10] you can see but any of
[00:51:14] those I know carpet used to be like a
[00:51:17] $16 card when it first came out then it
[00:51:20] dropped down to like 10 now it's down to
[00:51:22] five it's still a good card though so if
[00:51:26] you have if you need it it's a good card
[00:51:28] to
[00:51:31] have like The Surge foil one still like
[00:51:34] I think around 10 bucks it's just uh the
[00:51:37] rest of them all
[00:51:39] drop but yeah that's a it's a really
[00:51:42] good card at the beginning of your each
[00:51:45] of your main phases if you haven't added
[00:51:47] Mana with this ability this turn you may
[00:51:50] add X Mona and one color where X is the
[00:51:53] number of islands Target opponent
[00:51:54] controls I mean that's a good
[00:51:58] one wow Reserve list was 100 I didn't
[00:52:02] know that was that much OG carpet was
[00:52:05] reserved list I didn't know that wow

[01:16:41] order I mean but for some reason I got
[01:16:45] out of order I don't know what happened

[01:17:01] why I started doing this thing and then
[01:17:03] I do it in the morning because I kind of
[01:17:05] get bored and I figure hang out with
[01:17:07] people in the
[01:17:10] morning so that's kind of where this all
[01:17:12] occurred and became what it is today
[01:17:15] that you

[01:41:22] remember who it
[01:41:25] was ah it was you all right thank you I
[01:41:29] was trying like I remember I was talking
[01:41:30] to somebody about it you're the one of
[01:41:31] the Marines
[01:41:34] right yeah yeah Marine Corp y my nephew
[01:41:37] was in the Marines and he was over there
[01:41:38] too that's why I was going to ask you a
[01:41:40] question about uh do they still send you
[01:41:43] to he used to go to North Korea all the
[01:41:45] time or so never mind he used to go to
[01:41:49] Korea all the time like South Korea I
[01:41:52] don't know if they still sent you guys
[01:41:53] over
[01:41:58] there yeah he said it one of one of the
[01:42:01] things that he always remembered doing
[01:42:03] that he said it was it was fun but he
[01:42:04] hated doing it was when they were doing
[01:42:06] the backpacking around South Korea well
[01:42:09] not backpacking they were they were on
[01:42:10] their feet they weren't able to they
[01:42:12] weren't they were walking the entire
[01:42:13] time with the whole troop so I don't
[01:42:15] know what you'd call that is that just a
[01:42:16] a
[01:42:18] march on Korean Mar all right yeah he
[01:42:21] went on a March in Korea and he walked
[01:42:23] he remember it was cool he said he got
[01:42:24] to go through all the patties rucking
[01:42:26] thank you that's what it was called
[01:42:27] rucking yes he went rcking through uh
[01:42:30] Korea and he said it was actually really
[01:42:32] fun they except when they got to um the
[01:42:34] part where it was closer to Northern
[01:42:36] Korea that's when a lot of the farmers
[01:42:38] started being like really mean to them
[01:42:40] and like with like um like when they
[01:42:42] started going through like some of the
[01:42:43] roads they were like they would like go
[01:42:45] and throw [ __ ] at him and stuff yes
[01:42:47] close to the DMZ exactly when you get
[01:42:49] close to the DMZ none none of them liked
[01:42:51] you there is what he was telling me but
[01:42:53] if you were as soon as you were further
[01:42:55] away from the DMZ everyone loved you he
[01:42:57] was like people would come up and they
[01:42:58] were giving you things on a regular
[01:43:00] basis because they love you over there
[01:43:02] so I was just wondering I was just I

[01:43:23] you and the other thing he said was um
[01:43:26] when he used to go out in Japan this is
[01:43:28] about 10 years ago though he said he
[01:43:29] he'd go out in Japan and um people
[01:43:31] around okanawa would not be so happy
[01:43:34] about you either the Japanese people
[01:43:36] once you got further out of some of
[01:43:38] those areas they were okay but um if you
[01:43:41] were walking around in your like um your

[01:45:07] beat the L the point where they go oh
[01:45:09] what I didn't know that happens actually
[01:45:12] oh damn I didn't know that
[01:45:14] occurred I'm sorry yeah that stinks
[01:45:16] sometimes you know I didn't know that
[01:45:18] actually occurred interesting I that was
[01:45:20] the first time I heard that
[01:45:23] one hey Dominics thanks for coming out
[01:45:26] and hanging out what we're doing we're
[01:45:29] doing right now is we're just doing some
[01:45:31] uh uh some singles right here and I'm I
[01:45:34] just keep going from my singles up in
[01:45:36] price um so if you don't like them
[01:45:38] that's fine I can keep going over and
[01:45:40] doing um different ones but what I'll do
[01:45:42] here now is since no one liked those
[01:45:44] singles I'm going to do a pull box deal
[01:45:46] while I find you guys all a um probably
[01:45:50] going to guys all a deal on

[01:45:56] to grab Ah that's all
[01:46:00] right oh damn I didn't know that see I
[01:46:04] he never told me any of that happened he
[01:46:06] told me he had a lot of issues with
[01:46:07] other
[01:46:08] stuff with PE with the people in Japan
[01:46:10] towards him but I didn't know that that
[01:46:13] happened that sucks uh you know it's
[01:46:15] always like one bad actor too that kind
[01:46:17] of screws it up for everyone else is
[01:46:19] what ends up happening
[01:46:21] like one person like got hammered and
[01:46:24] just some person mouthed off and said
[01:46:26] something you know what I mean and
[01:46:27] that's the problem is like he said he
[01:46:30] was able to control himself because when
[01:46:32] he was drinking but he had some friends
[01:46:34] that had a hard time controlling
[01:46:49] themselves
[01:47:11] there's three packs on stream will be 20
[01:47:13] coming up here we have no Liberty
[01:47:16] buddies now now just because we're
[01:47:18] worried about Marines [ __ ] up but

[01:47:39] that one of his favorite things was
[01:47:40] doing the rocking around uh South Korea

[01:47:44] you talk making a comment about it and

[01:47:48] bringing it up I was like oh that's

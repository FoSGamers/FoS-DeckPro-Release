[00:01:42] set
[00:01:45] here who I'm really big
[00:01:49] again let's shrink me
[00:01:51] down let's put me
[00:01:54] back expand me a little bit there we go
[00:01:57] I think that's what I'm supposed to be
[00:01:58] like
[00:02:00] we'll see if I have to adjust I will
[00:02:04] adjust what's the game before you vote
[00:02:07] all right Freddy so the game is in the
[00:02:10] notes check out the show notes I did put
[00:02:11] it in there so you guys can see it so
[00:02:14] how the game works we'll do a little
[00:02:16] example of the game all right we'll do a
[00:02:17] little example of the game you buy your
[00:02:20] uh you buy your three packs of cards all
[00:02:22] right um whatever anything is and um and
[00:02:27] whatever whatever you happen to go with
[00:02:29] if you want to go the sets or drafts or
[00:02:31] collector boosters whatever you'd like
[00:02:33] to do but the the cards don't really too
[00:02:35] the set the packs don't matter too too
[00:02:37] much it's more of the game sayy good
[00:02:40] morning gnomes rule so with the game
[00:02:42] what we got going on is all right we
[00:02:46] have we do not have anything yet for um
[00:02:50] our um Fallout in but we are getting
[00:02:52] prepared for the game that we were going
[00:02:54] to start with doing with it all right so
[00:02:57] what we're going to do is you have your
[00:02:58] cards now you go on your adventure as
[00:03:02] you go on your adventure each one of
[00:03:04] your things that you start with if say
[00:03:05] you decide you wanted to go with a set
[00:03:07] or a DRFT um you're going to get plus
[00:03:10] one for each one of the uh these are
[00:03:13] this is a plus one is your character
[00:03:15] this is your character you choose
[00:03:16] whether he's going to be a
[00:03:17] technician a um uh strong human which is
[00:03:21] like a Defender a detective or a mutant
[00:03:25] and they all have different things that
[00:03:26] they occur depending on what gets pulled
[00:03:27] out of the box the box is here so the
[00:03:30] first thing is you buy one of those
[00:03:31] which is just whatever you want to say
[00:03:32] it is with the cards then you your first
[00:03:35] encounter is going to be a food
[00:03:36] encounter so we're going to give you an
[00:03:37] example here first encounter will be a
[00:03:39] food encounter you come through and I'm
[00:03:41] gonna end up if you guys like this a lot
[00:03:43] I'll get some animations going all right
[00:03:45] I froze am I
[00:03:47] Frozen dang it hold
[00:03:51] on where's my
[00:03:58] Tet why am I
[00:04:03] Frozen all right I froze let me see I
[00:04:05] have to sometimes I have to this is a
[00:04:07] pain in the butt whatnot can you guys
[00:04:10] see me in my
[00:04:11] back stream picture with no audio thank
[00:04:17] you no
[00:04:20] audio can you hear it
[00:04:25] now oh I went down for a second oh just
[00:04:27] for a second I went down okay all right
[00:04:29] cool thank you
[00:04:32] guys all right so what I was getting to
[00:04:34] was um all right so you get plus one
[00:04:36] just because your character starts out
[00:04:38] at plus one unless you go with the
[00:04:39] collector booster Set uh three of them
[00:04:41] then it starts out with plus two so
[00:04:43] that's kind of how we started out there
[00:04:45] and then you go through your first thing
[00:04:46] is you're going to go in and you're
[00:04:47] gonna get first encounter is going to be
[00:04:49] either you're gonna need food or
[00:04:50] treasure all right good morning Ace how
[00:04:53] you doing
[00:04:54] buddy so what you're going to do is
[00:04:56] you're going to tell me where to go and
[00:04:58] these are just 50 50 of food and
[00:05:00] treasure cards mixed in here you're
[00:05:02] going to pick one out and say you go I'm
[00:05:03] going to do be a technician you pick one
[00:05:05] out and you go wait that was the wrong
[00:05:07] one food and treasure is the other is in
[00:05:10] is red sorry food and treasure is
[00:05:14] red I forgot the color you pull one of
[00:05:17] these out and you get oh a treasure card
[00:05:20] perfect for a technician Treasures help
[00:05:23] you so you get a plus one all right
[00:05:25] you're now at plus one for your
[00:05:27] character well your second encounter you
[00:05:29] go on and you're going to see what else
[00:05:31] is going to happen to you in your second
[00:05:32] encounter your second encounter here is
[00:05:35] going to be between characters that are
[00:05:38] either going to help you harm you or
[00:05:41] items that are going to help you or harm
[00:05:43] you all right so here you come in and
[00:05:45] you have plus one or a minus one
[00:05:47] depending on what you get here so in
[00:05:50] here froze
[00:05:54] again how's that am I froze
[00:05:58] still
[00:06:02] did I freeze again can you hear
[00:06:05] me good now dang it all right so where
[00:06:08] did I freeze
[00:06:11] at I think I know what's going on when I
[00:06:17] freeze all right so anyways uh you get a
[00:06:19] plus one because you're a technician you
[00:06:21] get a treasure all right that was lucky
[00:06:23] there now you go on you go into your
[00:06:25] second encounter your second encounter
[00:06:27] is going to be with like creatures or
[00:06:28] items that either going to help you
[00:06:30] along the way all right this is going to
[00:06:32] be a creature an item that's going to
[00:06:33] help you along the way something that's
[00:06:34] going to give you something to help with
[00:06:35] we'll see we're going to pull out a card
[00:06:36] here and you got oh look at that you get
[00:06:38] an Elf Knight now with a technician
[00:06:40] Knights harm you all right because
[00:06:43] they're uh they come out for whatever
[00:06:45] reason Knights are at minus one so
[00:06:46] you're minus you're now went from plus
[00:06:48] one plus two down to just plus one all
[00:06:51] right you're only at plus one now
[00:06:53] because you happen to get a minus one
[00:06:54] there because for a technician the
[00:06:56] knights harm you that's a 5050 box
[00:06:59] Choice there now on your last encounter
[00:07:01] is whether you get a a friend or
[00:07:05] not that you whether you get a friend or
[00:07:08] not that is going to be helpful for you
[00:07:11] all right that's what it is you're going
[00:07:12] to get a friend and a a companion that
[00:07:14] is going to be help for you and this is
[00:07:15] a
[00:07:17] 25% chance that it's going to help you
[00:07:19] 75% chance against you all right so here
[00:07:21] we go and there's only a few cards in
[00:07:23] this one so you go through and you go
[00:07:24] all right pull one out and you go a
[00:07:27] dwarf Berserker all right you did not
[00:07:30] get you needed a Thro that was going to
[00:07:33] be your thing that would help you
[00:07:34] because you didn't you get now A minus
[00:07:35] one you are at a zero currently but you
[00:07:40] have the chance now what happens is
[00:07:43] being at a
[00:07:44] um being down
[00:07:47] there here's what you get your last
[00:07:49] choices you're probably not going to
[00:07:51] have anything to Wi beat against but
[00:07:53] these are your creatures that you can
[00:07:55] fight against all right these are the
[00:07:57] bosses in the battle all right at the
[00:07:59] end now there's 10 of them here so you
[00:08:02] either have a three and 10 chance to get
[00:08:04] if you have a three um four points or
[00:08:08] more or four bonuses or more to get
[00:08:10] above um the above cards get
[00:08:15] a added collector booster you have two
[00:08:19] or more that could potentially be three
[00:08:21] or higher for your points to get you an
[00:08:23] added set booster and that is what it is
[00:08:26] I shuffle these up and these are like
[00:08:27] the characters so like say you have
[00:08:29] Godzilla you get into you're going to go
[00:08:31] against Godzilla he's a six you're not
[00:08:33] going to have a chance to beat him but
[00:08:35] Owen Grady comes out only defensive two
[00:08:38] you could potentially beat him with
[00:08:39] three that would get you a set booster
[00:08:41] maybe you got the four you beat and beat
[00:08:43] your Velociraptor there you could beat
[00:08:45] your velocir Raptor and Owen Grady with
[00:08:46] a four which would get you a collector
[00:08:48] booster so that's how the game goes so
[00:08:50] you wouldn't be able to eat Sauron you
[00:08:52] wouldn't be able to beat incinerator
[00:08:54] which is an which is a uh the invisible
[00:08:57] ink one you wouldn't be you would be
[00:08:58] able to beat Mary weather there Merry
[00:09:01] weather light couldn't ble
[00:09:03] flare water of the watch uh watch in the
[00:09:06] water couldn't beat in a poor would be
[00:09:07] hard to beat and also that would be hard
[00:09:09] to beat too but my point is though we
[00:09:12] Shuffle these up see what happens and
[00:09:13] that's how it goes you just pretty much
[00:09:15] a little added thing when you buy your
[00:09:16] pack of cards to see if you want to play
[00:09:18] the game I don't know that's what it is
[00:09:21] a little complicated
[00:09:26] sometimes in the show notes the show
[00:09:29] notes it actually reads all of them in
[00:09:31] there and explains it to you um it's a
[00:09:34] little bit it's a little bit down I
[00:09:35] probably should have put it right at the
[00:09:36] top there but it's right under the big
[00:09:38] uh the red button one if you scroll down
[00:09:39] it says welcome to Wasteland adventure
[00:09:42] and explains it pretty much you go
[00:09:43] through each one of these boxes here
[00:09:46] you're either going to go for a 5050
[00:09:49] with the treasure potentially a treasure
[00:09:50] or food to help you a 5050 with a
[00:09:53] creature or an artifact or a plue type
[00:09:57] card to help you um or subtract from you
[00:10:00] for a plus one or minus one and then a
[00:10:03] 2575 for uh your companion to help you
[00:10:07] in the blue cards here um whether the
[00:10:09] companion comes out to help you to give
[00:10:11] you a plus one now if you get four if
[00:10:14] you're plus four or more you get an
[00:10:16] extra collector booster just to say
[00:10:18] thank you and if you get three or more
[00:10:21] you get an extra set
[00:10:24] booster on the co this is the full cost
[00:10:27] of the pack so you buy three packs at
[00:10:30] full price is what it is that's it three
[00:10:33] packs at full price so um instead of
[00:10:35] like I wouldn't be giving a three pack
[00:10:37] deal on these these would be six times 6
[00:10:39] time three 18 all right there would be
[00:10:43] no three-pack deal on them if you're
[00:10:44] jumping in and playing the game that's
[00:10:46] really the
[00:10:47] difference that's
[00:10:55] it hold
[00:10:57] on all right you know what we'll do with
[00:10:59] this the works we'll do it with a three-
[00:11:01] pack there with those ones so we're
[00:11:02] going to do it we're going to do the
[00:11:07] game what's the cost on top of the packs
[00:11:10] buy your boys a free game o buy your
[00:11:13] boys a free game okay we
[00:11:15] can learn as we go yeah all right so
[00:11:20] what I'm going to do I see we have the
[00:11:23] works here jumped in do you want to try
[00:11:25] out doing it as the game does and we'll
[00:11:28] uh we'll that way we can give everybody
[00:11:29] a little example here and see what
[00:11:32] happens because if you do collector
[00:11:34] boosters three collector boosters you
[00:11:36] start out already at plus two instead of
[00:11:39] plus
[00:11:40] one yes all right let's do it here we go
[00:11:43] the
[00:11:45] works we like it we going to put our our
[00:11:48] things back
[00:11:49] here here we go I'm just putting these
[00:11:52] all back in here and now if people like
[00:11:55] this game and we end up doing a good job
[00:11:56] with it uh having some fun with it I'm
[00:11:58] going to end up doing like the
[00:11:59] animations like I get for our uh our
[00:12:01] missiles here all right one two three
[00:12:04] choose where you want to go one two
[00:12:06] three there's four of them in here our
[00:12:14] buddy front right front
[00:12:19] right and the two on the left two left
[00:12:22] and the front
[00:12:24] right two left and the front right all
[00:12:26] right so there we go that's what we're
[00:12:28] going to do there all
[00:12:30] right here we are and we are going to
[00:12:34] start this off with where would you like
[00:12:37] to go hunting for some food or some
[00:12:42] treasure Duke just picked it no The
[00:12:45] Works did he said two left one
[00:12:52] right did he say the same thing as
[00:12:57] you
[00:13:00] he literally said the same thing as you
[00:13:02] he said two you said two left one
[00:13:07] right I did front right didn't I did I
[00:13:11] do the did I do the back
[00:13:16] right you said one right which would be
[00:13:18] the one number one on the right which is
[00:13:21] why I did the front right one did I do
[00:13:24] that wrong I'm sorry I I didn't read
[00:13:27] dupe
[00:13:32] did I Mis misunderstand
[00:13:35] you okay no I was okay I was correct but
[00:13:38] he said the same thing as you is that
[00:13:40] what happened he said the same thing at
[00:13:42] the same time then I didn't read what he
[00:13:44] said you said one you said two left and
[00:13:46] one right so I took the front right one
[00:13:48] which was one right like number one on
[00:13:50] the right I'm sorry if I misunderstood
[00:13:52] that any but we said we're
[00:13:57] good okay okay hey you know what that
[00:14:00] we're going to get some good luck here
[00:14:01] if you want me to that I'll switch that
[00:14:03] that was the one on the right I will
[00:14:04] switch that out if you would like me to
[00:14:06] I'm sorry I if I
[00:14:14] misunderstood he jumped in right away
[00:14:16] and just bought three uh packs of
[00:14:18] Commander um if you look at the sold and
[00:14:20] I was just going to go through the game
[00:14:20] to show the example of it dupe that's
[00:14:22] what was going on here uh but anyways
[00:14:25] we're going to do the game
[00:14:27] now here go here we go here's the game
[00:14:30] now let me know where you want to go for
[00:14:31] your food or your treasure and what you
[00:14:33] want to be are you going to be what are
[00:14:35] you going to be here a um
[00:14:39] technician are you gonna be a human
[00:14:41] which is a a strong human which is like
[00:14:43] a
[00:14:44] Defender um are you going to be a
[00:14:48] detective or are you going to be a
[00:14:50] mutant technician all right with the
[00:14:52] technician the things that help you are
[00:14:55] Treasures out of this okay and you want
[00:14:59] to go in the middle things that help you
[00:15:01] our Treasures are all right and we're
[00:15:02] going to go in the middle here we go you
[00:15:06] are a technician here you got a food
[00:15:11] token sadly the food token does not help
[00:15:14] you you
[00:15:15] needed what you needed was a treasure
[00:15:18] token to assist you so this is actually
[00:15:20] a minus one for you so you are at now
[00:15:22] plus one only because you got two
[00:15:24] collector boosters here all right so you
[00:15:26] are at plus one right now with your two
[00:15:28] color boosters then we're going to go on
[00:15:31] and where would you like to go for your
[00:15:33] next box to see if you find anyone or
[00:15:35] anything that helps you along the way
[00:15:37] maybe there's a person that hands you
[00:15:39] something that's going to helpful maybe
[00:15:40] there's an item that's going to be
[00:15:41] helpful for you like a copy or a power
[00:15:44] stone or maybe there's someone with a
[00:15:46] clue or a map or a throt there to give
[00:15:48] you a hand somewhere towards the back
[00:15:50] somewhere towards the back all right we
[00:15:52] can do that somewhere towards the back
[00:15:54] here all right we're going to do
[00:15:55] somewhere in the back here here we go
[00:15:59] let's see what we get here we did oh we
[00:16:02] got an angel the angel is not helpful
[00:16:04] for you here it is a minus one on you on
[00:16:07] that one so you are currently at you're
[00:16:09] at zero here all right let's see what
[00:16:11] happens let's see if we can get anything
[00:16:13] to bump you back up at all with a
[00:16:16] companion all right now in your
[00:16:18] companion your companion is gonna head
[00:16:21] at towards a uh so where would you like
[00:16:23] to go on your companion there is only 12
[00:16:25] cards of companions in here so I can
[00:16:27] even like play him out if you want to
[00:16:29] see him the first card all right first
[00:16:31] card it
[00:16:32] is first card it is and here we go you
[00:16:36] got a fungus dinosaur oh wow well I
[00:16:39] don't we did we didn't get ready I don't
[00:16:40] think we got any help really today right
[00:16:42] now we got a fungus dinosaur which was
[00:16:44] another subtraction away so you're
[00:16:46] actually at a minus one so your chances
[00:16:49] you're not going to be able to win right
[00:16:51] now there's no way you're going to be
[00:16:52] able to beat anybody sadly just because
[00:16:55] what happened that you got down to a
[00:16:57] minus one from having having minus three
[00:16:59] on all those but here that was the game
[00:17:01] there we could potentially as I said
[00:17:03] 50/50 chances of you getting plus one
[00:17:05] plus ones and then there is the um the

[00:53:56] game we got
[00:53:57] going and I gotta take a little bit of
[00:53:59] drink here because I know somebody wants
[00:54:01] to play the Wasteland
[00:54:05] Adventure it's just what you want to
[00:54:07] play
[00:54:09] with all right how's this
[00:54:12] guys you know what if I
[00:54:16] do what if we do the Wasteland inventure
[00:54:19] and we started with one collector
[00:54:21] booster and instead of you instead of
[00:54:25] you can win a collector booster at the
[00:54:26] end because it's only one collector
[00:54:28] booster it's going to be you can win a
[00:54:30] set booster at the end or a draft if you
[00:54:33] happen to be the one that gets a plus
[00:54:35] two what do you think on that if we do
[00:54:37] one card instead of
[00:54:41] three nice you got a show and tell you
[00:54:44] need yeah if I find I have an omn
[00:54:47] science I know in a deck it's just
[00:54:49] whether or not I have a spare one that's
[00:54:52] what it is so here let's do this this
[00:54:56] let's do this then all right the game is
[00:54:58] going to be a little bit different we're
[00:54:59] going to do only one collector booster
[00:55:01] this time let's do a one collector
[00:55:03] booster we're gonna do
[00:55:06] one hey Bray there you
[00:55:13] go got uh we'll do this
[00:55:16] 21 let me correct that because these are
[00:55:19] incorrect there throw that away
[00:55:22] 21 one pack of
[00:55:25] murders and you get to play our little
[00:55:28] game here the adventure game and you
[00:55:31] choose whether you're going to be oh
[00:55:34] gnomes went with the red
[00:55:37] button gnomes wants to go with the red
[00:55:39] button this
[00:55:41] morning here we go we're gonna move our
[00:55:44] game back so that he can get to the red
[00:55:47] button we're gonna move our game right
[00:55:49] here so we can get to that red button
[00:55:51] gnomes is going to go to the red button
[00:55:53] would you consider a different point of
[00:55:55] start setup like for gler packs do a
[00:55:58] point each and set and draft have half a
[00:56:02] point
[00:56:04] per huh maybe maybe yeah I could do that
[00:56:07] so if you wanted to do a collector
[00:56:10] booster was one
[00:56:14] point maybe something like that yeah

[01:00:13] Manor did not hit that but we did go up
[01:00:18] and we did not go to the moon
[01:00:22] but we did go up
[01:00:25] and take out a satellite and got
[01:00:26] ourselves a pack of murders at Carlo
[01:00:31] Manor here we are our play booster and
[01:00:35] remember everybody we have our new
[01:00:38] adventure game if you want to jump in
[01:00:41] and play it all right the great ginch
[01:00:45] the great ginch what do you think maybe
[01:00:46] an adventure game jump in on that we're
[01:00:49] going to throw I'm going to throw three
[01:00:51] packs up here and I'm going to rip your
[01:00:52] thing open all right but yes I am I will
[01:00:55] think about that actually Freddy let's
[01:00:57] do this we'll do like um we'll say this
[01:01:01] is because we
[01:01:08] have and each one of
[01:01:11] these each play booster will be
[01:01:15] worth anything that is a draft will be
[01:01:18] worth half a point all right and a
[01:01:20] collector is worth a point I can do that
[01:01:25] a collector is worth a point and drafts
[01:01:28] or anything else are worth set or half a
[01:01:31] point that's what we're going to do
[01:01:32] there that's how we're going to do some
[01:01:34] of that here and we're going to start it
[01:01:36] out with this so we're going to have
[01:01:38] we're GNA have it like this then here's
[01:01:40] half a point here's one point here is
[01:01:43] half a point and you can
[01:01:46] only let's see but that gives you three
[01:01:49] points that'll give you three points if
[01:01:50] you do three collector boosters and this
[01:01:53] will give you two points
[01:01:56] H H interesting I'm GNA have to think
[01:01:59] about that we'll do this right now we
[01:02:01] you know what well screw it we're gonna
[01:02:02] make this two points right now if you
[01:02:04] want to do
[01:02:07] that yeah they can start up with up to
[01:02:10] three
[01:02:11] now that kind of started up with up to
[01:02:13] three now yeah they can get up to three
[01:02:16] to start out with now not bad I like
[01:02:19] that you can have up to three to start
[01:02:20] out with now I like that I like that
[01:02:23] here we go we're going to do it that way
[01:02:24] so we're going to start this out with
[01:02:25] two You' got two points here you are out
[01:02:28] at plus two for your character with
[01:02:32] these guys we're going to go
[01:02:34] with these two here then plus our
[01:02:37] collector all
[01:02:39] right we do that plus our
[01:02:43] collector in for
[01:02:45] this so I can rip open gnome stuff all
[01:02:49] right and you're going to start out with
[01:02:52] this is going to get you two points to
[01:02:53] start with here all right here we go
[01:02:56] let's get our murders open for you our
[01:02:59] buddy and those are going to let's see
[01:03:01] who wants to play the game in the
[01:03:02] background
[01:03:04] there game with any of the that's I like
[01:03:06] that idea Freddy with any of the
[01:03:08] collector boosters you get one point
[01:03:11] with any of this anything else it is
[01:03:13] half a
[01:03:14] point one two three four five six seven
[01:03:19] one two three four five six seven so you
[01:03:23] could potentially start out with three
[01:03:26] points if you have three collector
[01:03:27] boosters not on my watch undercover
[01:03:31] crocod elf nervous Garder offender at
[01:03:34] large unauthorized exit snarling
[01:03:37] gorehound Escape tunnel hazad vigilante
[01:03:42] magnetic snuffler that's a weird
[01:03:45] one buried in the garden get a leg up
[01:03:50] lost in the Maze oh that's not a bad
[01:03:52] little hit there murder foil planes and
[01:03:57] a clue I like those cards how they do
[01:03:59] those I'm a big fan of how they do
[01:04:01] those yeah what do you think guys this
[01:04:03] is now two points here because each each
[01:04:07] C pack that is
[01:04:08] under uh that is not a collector booster
[01:04:10] is half a point and every collector
[01:04:12] booster is worth a point now I like that
[01:04:15] idea I like that idea every collector
[01:04:18] booster is worth a point and everything
[01:04:20] else is worth half a point or every
[01:04:22] premium one so say you go with say you
[01:04:24] go with like an eternal Masters that'll
[01:04:26] be a point um say you go with a modern
[01:04:31] Horizon one that'll be a
[01:04:38] point that way you can kind of mix and
[01:04:40] match what you want and depending on
[01:04:43] what it is is the points that you get
[01:04:45] what do you think everybody I like that
[01:04:48] that's pretty good there so who wants to
[01:04:52] try their luck on something here well
[01:04:54] we'll do something like this gnomes
[01:04:56] thank you bud put that over here we're
[01:04:59] going to put this back then all right
[01:05:01] maybe you guys didn't want
[01:05:07] those hey thank you no problem Gomes
[01:05:09] have a good day at work and
[01:05:13] everything no problem Freddy I
[01:05:15] appreciate it that makes sense that
[01:05:17] makes sense steing I was thinking of
[01:05:18] stuff last night yeah I will'll try you
[01:05:21] got to try right and I was like I was
[01:05:22] trying to figure out how to do it and I
[01:05:23] that sense doing every everything else
[01:05:26] is so like here is a premium this is a
[01:05:29] Premium Pack so that's going to be one
[01:05:32] point this is
[01:05:35] a regular pack and this is a regular
[01:05:38] pack this is just going to be half a
[01:05:40] point and half a point so this gets you
[01:05:41] two points right here to start off in
[01:05:44] our game but you get these packs no
[01:05:46] matter what guaranteed you're always
[01:05:48] getting the packs it's just whether or
[01:05:49] not you're going to uh beat the boss at
[01:05:52] the end of the game
[01:05:55] thank you I appreciate it I appreciate
[01:05:58] it Freddy have a uh I'll see you in a
[01:06:00] little while
[01:06:01] maybe I'm GNA do this here and this is
[01:06:05] what I'm going to put up here for the
[01:06:06] pack deal right now or the packs now
[01:06:09] remember guys you can tell me any three
[01:06:11] that I have available and I will put any
[01:06:14] three up here it's just whether or not
[01:06:16] what they add up to so as we're saying
[01:06:19] here these would be plus one because it
[01:06:22] is a premium so modern Horizon and
[01:06:24] eternal Masters are premium ones you
[01:06:27] know what screw it I'm going to throw
[01:06:28] homelands in there as a premium one too
[01:06:30] homelands will be considered Premium One
[01:06:33] um any of the collector boosters are
[01:06:35] going to be plus one anything else that
[01:06:38] you get which would be would be a half a
[01:06:40] point for our little game here we'll see
[01:06:43] what happens anybody want to try their
[01:06:45] luck on it we did it earlier we had some
[01:06:48] fun maybe do a walkth through of the
[01:06:51] Wasteland to show how it works awesome
[01:06:54] will let's do a walkthrough of the
[01:06:56] Wasteland I'm going to put down a new
[01:06:58] pack deal and I'm going to do a walk
[01:07:00] through of the Wasteland so you guys can
[01:07:03] see how the Wasteland works all right
[01:07:06] we're going to put on a little pack deal

[01:09:18] human
[01:09:20] here wait a
[01:09:22] second hold on
[01:09:25] second hold on a second
[01:09:28] treasure why do I have clue in
[01:09:34] there copy is supposed to
[01:09:37] be map and clue map and
[01:09:41] clue sorry one second
[01:09:48] here it's either
[01:09:52] copy or Power Stone no that's what it is
[01:09:56] copy or Power Stone that takes away
[01:09:59] sorry my bad I had the wrong thing in
[01:10:01] there it's supposed to be copy or Power
[01:10:06] Stone copy or Power Stone takes away so
[01:10:09] you get a minus one so this went from
[01:10:11] plus two to plus one plus two to plus
[01:10:15] three then the copy takes away because
[01:10:17] you want a clue or a map for the strong
[01:10:19] human all right uh that's what you're
[01:10:21] looking for there a clue a map and Angel
[01:10:24] a soldier or a knight is what you're
[01:10:26] looking for because you now have minus
[01:10:28] one you are now at just two you're at
[01:10:30] two now what you're going to do here is
[01:10:32] maybe you're gonna get lucky maybe
[01:10:34] you're gonna get lucky and you're GNA
[01:10:35] get companion along the way there are
[01:10:37] only 12 companions maybe you're gonna
[01:10:40] find a comp 12 cards in the companion
[01:10:42] maybe you're gonna find a companion
[01:10:43] that's going to help you and give you
[01:10:44] another plus one so you go you know what
[01:10:46] hey you play those cards out and give me
[01:10:49] that fourth card right there all right
[01:10:50] pick this fourth card out is this card
[01:10:53] going to be a companion that helps you
[01:10:55] along the way in the Wasteland we don't
[01:10:57] know let's figure it out and look at
[01:10:59] that you have for yourself to help you
[01:11:04] as a strong human you got yourself a
[01:11:08] warrior Berserker which helps you along
[01:11:11] the way this helps you a strong Warrior
[01:11:14] Berserker you now have a plus one so you
[01:11:16] went from + one to plus two to plus
[01:11:22] three to plus two because you got a
[01:11:25] minus on the copy to another plus three
[01:11:28] all right you got that plus three there
[01:11:30] and that's see what happens maybe you're
[01:11:32] going to be lucky enough maybe you're
[01:11:34] GNA be the lucky one here to beat the
[01:11:36] boss we have 10 bosses here you have the
[01:11:40] potential of getting yourself an extra
[01:11:43] set booster pack because any two there
[01:11:45] are two of these in here that you could
[01:11:47] beat with three points or higher all
[01:11:49] right now what we're going to do here is
[01:11:51] you're going to say all right I want to
[01:11:52] take the fourth one from the top so I
[01:11:55] take that one I go like this we flip it
[01:11:58] over and we see is this going to be the
[01:12:00] character you can beat are you GNA be
[01:12:02] able to beat him are you GNA be able to
[01:12:04] beat them and you got a flare loyalties
[01:12:07] is who you go up against and Oh no
[01:12:09] you're plus three of that flare
[01:12:12] loyalties does not help flare loyalties
[01:12:15] Stomps you
[01:12:17] down takes away your pluses but leaves
[01:12:20] you with your cards to have some fun but
[01:12:23] you know what maybe maybe along that way
[01:12:25] you got lucky and you were the one and
[01:12:28] you pulled out a Merryweather instead oh
[01:12:31] no look at that you had a plus three and
[01:12:34] you pulled out Merryweather you beat
[01:12:36] Merryweather because she Merryweather
[01:12:38] only has
[01:12:40] two for its for its
[01:12:43] um strength there H for its defense so
[01:12:47] with only two for the
[01:12:49] defense what we need is you get yourself
[01:12:52] a free set that booster that's how that
[01:12:55] would end up working there and that's
[01:12:57] our little game that we got going you
[01:12:58] always get your three packs it's just
[01:13:01] whether or not you're going to get
[01:13:03] anything extra with those three packs
[01:13:05] whether you're going to play a game
[01:13:07] that's completely free on top of it to
[01:13:09] get something extra you're not paying
[01:13:11] anything anymore you're just buying your
[01:13:13] three packs of cards at your regular
[01:13:15] price it's just whether or not you're
[01:13:17] going to get lucky enough to get through
[01:13:19] the Wasteland and come
[01:13:21] out with an extra pack what do you guys
[01:13:25] think there kind of a fun
[01:13:27] game guys get pretty much straight out
[01:13:30] you buy three packs any three packs um

[01:32:47] one any set booster or below is a half a
[01:32:51] point 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and eight cuz we
[01:32:56] like seeing the spoilers at the end not

[01:33:00] a collector you get plus one if you buy
[01:33:04] set boosters or below you get half a

[01:33:55] card that's the first time I've seen
[01:33:57] that card I like that
[01:33:59] one I like that
[01:34:02] one you just got everything that you
[01:34:05] bought paid for and you had a chance of
[01:34:07] getting a free pack on top of it because
[01:34:09] you decided you wanted to pay play the
[01:34:11] adventure game by buying three packs
[01:34:13] that's all it was you bought three packs
[01:34:15] and almost almost got into that
[01:34:19] Adventure game win you know what I'm
[01:34:21] going to do guys since we guys seem to
[01:34:22] have fun with the adventure game I am
[01:34:25] going to do some animations for it I'm
[01:34:27] going to do some animations for it what
[01:34:29] do you guys think have some animations
[01:34:31] going along with your technician when
[01:34:33] you choose it you'll show a technician
[01:34:36] or a mutant or something like that will
[01:34:37] come out on the screen when you choose
[01:34:39] your character and depending on what
[01:34:41] happens whether they get food and they
[01:34:42] get they find some food to eat that'll
[01:34:44] be a different one find something else
[01:34:46] what do you think something like that I
[01:34:48] think that'd be kind of
[01:34:50] cool do some
[01:34:52] animations with each one of the stages
[01:34:56] here I don't know I think that'd be kind
[01:34:57] of cool what do you guys think that over
[01:35:00] the top of the game but Precision
[01:35:03] Precision coming out there we like
[01:35:07] it that was nice nice job
[01:35:12] Precision now if you guys want anything
[01:35:14] else I don't definitely Picasso of packs
[01:35:18] as wazer would say the Picasso of packs
[01:35:20] is add it again
[01:35:30] preion
[01:35:34] gaming there we go Precision gaming nice
[01:35:38] hits on those this is what I'm saying
[01:35:40] guys you get a chance you play the
[01:35:42] adventure game it's a little free game
[01:35:44] on top of buying three packs of cards I
[01:35:47] mean that's pretty good deal you just
[01:35:50] say what three packs of cards you want
[01:35:51] want and if it's a collector booster or
[01:35:54] premium you get a plus one if it's set
[01:35:57] or draft you get half a
[01:35:59] point it's really what it is get half a
[01:36:02] point if you get if you get premium sets
[01:36:06] if you get sets or premium you get a
[01:36:08] point pretty good game there so we're
[01:36:11] going to put this up here we're going to
[01:36:12] do another pack deal for those that may
[01:36:14] want it and if you want anything
[01:36:16] specific let me know
[01:36:19] so here
[01:36:23] this okay going to
[01:36:27] be the packs that we put up now we're
[01:36:31] going to do a murders that's going to
[01:36:32] get you a half a
[01:36:33] point we're going to do a
[01:36:36] mystery which is going to get you
[01:36:38] another half a point but we're going to
[01:36:41] do you a homelands which is going to get
[01:36:43] you a full point so this is going to be
[01:36:45] two points as your character starting
[01:36:47] out at all right guys you're going to
[01:36:50] start your character out at at two
[01:36:51] points with this one here jump in on it
[01:36:55] and let's see if you like
[01:36:59] it these are the three packs and
[01:37:02] remember you can always potentially get
[01:37:05] a third pack why did that not go a third
[01:37:10] pack if you uh get it through the
[01:37:13] Wasteland maybe you will be lucky
[01:37:16] enough maybe you'll be lucky enough to
[01:37:18] get your pull out
[01:37:21] plus one plus one and a plus one out of
[01:37:25] here to get plus three added on so you
[01:37:28] become a plus five character and what
[01:37:32] that means is you're GNA come up and you
[01:37:35] cannot beat a poli Raptor you can beat a
[01:37:38] watch you can't beat a watcher but you
[01:37:40] can beat Owen can't beat the world but
[01:37:42] you can beat a vosser you can't beat the
[01:37:44] incinerator you cannot beat the dark
[01:37:47] lord or Blitz but you can beat Mary
[01:37:50] can't beat Flair so you have three
[01:37:52] chances to get you a collector
[01:38:00] booster number on the I can tell you one
[01:38:02] second here tell you one second
[01:38:16] here it was
[01:38:18] 3:45 345 you are correct stretch you did
[01:38:22] see that or you just know that that's
[01:38:25] 345 by what the look of it
[01:38:29] is all right Precision nice hit there
[01:38:32] bud so I put this up for a pack thing
[01:38:35] here no one wanted to go after those
[01:38:36] three maybe somebody else wants to try
[01:38:38] it three packs any three packs that you
[01:38:41] get you get your chance of going after a
[01:38:44] fourth pack for free is it going to be a
[01:38:47] collector booster is it going to be a
[01:38:49] set booster are you going to be able to
[01:38:50] win
[01:38:51] against one of
[01:38:55] our one of our bosses here are you going
[01:38:58] to beat the boss and come out on
[01:39:01] top I don't know but here we go we're
[01:39:04] going to do this one here this one here
[01:39:06] is going to start you out at plus three
[01:39:09] look at that this is going to start you
[01:39:10] out at plus three right here if you want
[01:39:12] to play our adventure
[01:39:15] game plus three you get yourself a box

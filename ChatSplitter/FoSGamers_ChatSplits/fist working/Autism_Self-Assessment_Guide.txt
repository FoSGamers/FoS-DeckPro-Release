   - Do you prefer solitary activities over social gatherings?

   - Do you find it difficult to initiate or engage in conversations, especially small talk?

We've discussed questions related to social interaction, communication, repetitive behaviors, sensory sensitivities, empathy, emotional regulation, and childhood history.

Do you engage in sensory seeking or avoiding behaviors?

c) Yes, I frequently engage in sensory seeking or avoiding behaviors.

[2024-06-04 08:11:34] FoSGamers:
What are century, seeking and avoiding behaviors?

[2024-06-04 08:11:38] ChatGPT:
"Sensory seeking" and "sensory avoiding" behaviors are terms used in the context of sensory processing. Here's what they mean:

1. **Sensory Seeking Behaviors:** These are actions or behaviors where individuals actively seek out sensory input. For example, a person might enjoy listening to loud music, touching different textures, or seeking out strong flavors in food. They may engage in activities that provide intense sensory experiences because they find them enjoyable or stimulating.

2. **Sensory Avoiding Behaviors:** These are actions or behaviors where individuals try to avoid or minimize exposure to certain sensory stimuli because they find them uncomfortable, overwhelming, or distressing. For instance, someone may avoid crowded or noisy environments, cover their ears when exposed to loud noises, or avoid foods with strong flavors or textures.

"Sensory seeking" and "sensory avoiding" behaviors are part of how individuals with sensory processing differences interact with their environment and can be observed across various sensory modalities such as auditory, visual, tactile, olfactory, and gustatory stimuli.

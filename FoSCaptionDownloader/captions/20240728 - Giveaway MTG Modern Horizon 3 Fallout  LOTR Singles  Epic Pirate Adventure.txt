[00:30:41] it going there and then I just need to
[00:30:45] take a picture of all these spread out
[00:30:48] while we begin the
[00:30:51] adventure I'm going to do it like
[00:30:54] this I'm going to do it like this
[00:31:02] do it right
[00:31:09] here that's not going to work either
[00:31:11] damn
[00:31:13] it need something for a white
[00:31:16] background that'll work for a background
[00:31:19] cardboard background
[00:31:25] works you just need a picture of
[00:31:27] everything for
[00:31:59] okay let's take a picture so I can
[00:32:01] upload it to the
[00:32:03] uh to the list
[00:32:09] thing that's what I need to do right now
[00:32:11] because I need to have it in
[00:32:18] there make sure everything is
[00:32:21] correct add photo
[00:32:48] there we
[00:32:52] go now we can begin our first round
[00:33:07] Let's Do It Let's Do
[00:33:09] It Good Morning number eight George got
[00:33:12] number eight and you got a rados or
[00:33:15] little rados here all right let's get it
[00:33:18] going
[00:33:20] rados why I put rados there George
[00:33:29] George
[00:33:31] 0930 so there's like multiple Georges
[00:33:33] that get stff and my uh my family will
[00:33:36] help me sometimes with organizing things
[00:33:37] before I pack them so it doesn't take me
[00:33:39] forever and um they have a hard time
[00:33:42] reading my handwriting so in the process
[00:33:44] of the hard time reading my handwriting
[00:33:46] they
[00:33:48] um they uh they will ask me like is this
[00:33:52] what name what name and I think George
[00:33:53] came up like twice because it was Two
[00:33:55] Georges
[00:33:58] and they were like wait is this the same
[00:33:59] one I can't Is this different because
[00:34:01] they're so close in the name my
[00:34:03] handwriting was so bad they're like I
[00:34:05] can't tell I'm going with this is um
[00:34:08] this is the same person and then I had
[00:34:10] to look at it and ended up being like
[00:34:11] the right person but still it was kind
[00:34:14] of funny they can't read my handwriting
[00:34:16] so they kept thinking you were two
[00:34:17] different people but you were one person
[00:34:19] it was just my handwriting was so bad
[00:34:21] that it looked like you were two
[00:34:22] different
[00:34:23] people one two three four five six seven
[00:34:27] eight that's the one going out right
[00:34:29] there all right now we're going to keep
[00:34:31] these out
[00:34:34] here we're going to shuffle these up a
[00:34:37] little
[00:34:38] bit on screen we'll do it so everybody
[00:34:41] sees it
[00:34:44] there okay those are our cards
[00:34:47] there these are our G our parts of them
[00:34:50] now what we're going to do is we started
[00:34:52] out like this with pirate Adventure
[00:34:55] we'll start it out the first one here
[00:34:58] you uh 30 seconds and see what it
[00:35:01] goes
[00:35:03] yeah my my wife said I should have been
[00:35:05] a doctor but these are the singles that
[00:35:07] you can get I'm going to zoom
[00:35:10] in these are the singles you can get or
[00:35:12] the floors of the cards now the packs of
[00:35:13] the cards for the floors will give you a
[00:35:16] um one of the Benjamins with it but you
[00:35:19] could get any one of these singles 13
[00:35:22] singles instead everybody say we so we
[00:35:27] do you have to participate in the
[00:35:29] adventure and see how it
[00:35:31] goes oh no well guess uh I guess it's
[00:35:35] because I don't have Bloom Barrow that's
[00:35:37] my my guess is what's going on there
[00:35:40] that's all
[00:35:50] righted out that's all right see the
[00:35:54] cool thing about what I did with the
[00:35:55] game here is we have the first box here
[00:35:59] which is this and it's going to be $17
[00:36:00] now the SE second box will be the same
[00:36:04] thing but
[00:36:05] instead in the second box well it was
[00:36:08] going to be the same price but in the
[00:36:09] second box if we get through it it will
[00:36:10] be these we'll have set boosters
[00:36:13] Homeland we'll have some Modern Horizon
[00:36:14] 3 play boosters or oh that's supposed to
[00:36:18] be over there ah prob switch some
[00:36:25] around play boosters we go Homeland so
[00:36:29] you see that there that's what you get
[00:36:30] there and then you have our game
[00:36:32] pieces so it's up to you what goes on
[00:36:35] here that wasn't supposed to be in
[00:36:39] there now I got to count these and make
[00:36:41] sure we're right again two
[00:36:44] [Music]
[00:36:46] three four five
[00:36:49] six8 nine 10 11 12 14 15 16
[00:37:07] 18 yeah it is correct all right we
[00:37:13] go there we are we'll see if you want
[00:37:17] any of that try that out I don't know
[00:37:19] thought it might like you might like
[00:37:21] it but we'll see now it builds up as you
[00:37:24] go you can get any of those ones now if
[00:37:27] we get through that 25 out of that
[00:37:29] second one and we get to the last box
[00:37:31] it's going to be $17 those are going to
[00:37:32] be cards that are going to be attached
[00:37:34] to it now the cards that are always
[00:37:35] attached to them grow and stay with us
[00:37:38] too so we're Canna have cool cards that
[00:37:40] every every box cards will be attached
[00:37:42] to it new ones so these will be attached
[00:37:45] to one of the
[00:37:48] boxes at some
[00:37:54] point I think these are turned around
[00:37:56] there we go
[00:37:59] so we'll have these all in a box so and
[00:38:02] be split up between those two
[00:38:05] boxes see ah what's gonna happen is we
[00:38:08] got to we got to make our way through
[00:38:11] the adventure to's see what
[00:38:16] happens sins trying out something I like
[00:38:20] it going with some set boosters I like
[00:38:23] it George went with eight did I start it

[00:38:28] see if we want to do our little
[00:38:29] Adventure game now if you don't want to

[00:38:33] um purchase some packs to go along with
[00:38:35] it we can play that way but the whole
[00:38:37] point of it was we would be play we

[00:58:18] what we'll do for the most of the day
[00:58:19] here try to get this because what our
[00:58:21] point is is as it grows eventually what
[00:58:24] it's going to be is next singles packs
[00:58:28] will be $17 but everything will be these
[00:58:31] packs then plus the cards that you see
[00:58:35] over
[00:58:37] here these cards will be split into them
[00:58:41] then if you happen to get all the way
[00:58:43] through to the final towards the where
[00:58:45] the boss is the final Island these cards
[00:58:48] now you can see they're all collector
[00:58:50] boosters and that's the whole point of
[00:58:52] it we go from they stay $17 the entire
[00:58:55] time

[01:20:43] we'll have a pinned and we'll keep
[01:20:44] running this and we'll go into
[01:20:46] um I we'll see if uh no one wants to
[01:20:49] play the game here we'll continue on
[01:20:52] we'll see how this adventure goes
[01:20:57] because I have uh we have to get through
[01:21:00] these 35 these 35 things that go on here
[01:21:04] because when we do our next boxes have
[01:21:06] set boosters and uh
[01:21:09] some like modern Horizon play boosters
[01:21:12] and we'll have some of these singles in

[01:21:16] it's going to be the same price and it's
[01:21:18] going to
[01:21:19] be you know uh you know what we'll do
[01:21:23] this
[01:21:25] maybe I have to lower the
[01:21:27] price of this
[01:21:30] one and then I'll raise the price of the
[01:21:32] final two should I do that what do you
[01:21:35] think
[01:21:36] guys to make it more intriguing and then
[01:21:40] instead of 17 for this one the next one
[01:21:43] will be
[01:21:45] like 18 or
[01:21:47] 20 and then the one after that will be
[01:21:49] like 21 or
[01:21:51] 22 that way it makes up for the
[01:21:53] difference of me changing this lower in
[01:21:54] the price what do you think I don't know
[01:21:57] is that something you'd be willing to
[01:21:59] do no I I thought I had a good one here

[02:33:29] see MC Brendan I can you guys find a way
[02:33:32] to sneak that in

[02:33:43] you happen to find that which pyate
[02:33:46] picks up and he's like I don't
[02:33:47] understand what this thing is but he
[02:33:49] looks at the
[02:33:50] light light shines in his eyes and it
[02:33:53] makes him all of a sudden he feels
[02:33:54] smarter you can see things around the
[02:33:56] island a little better he sees things in
[02:33:59] the
[02:34:00] distance he can see uh he can understand
[02:34:03] some of the trees some of the creatures
[02:34:05] around I don't know intriguing on this

[02:38:06] map that you
[02:38:09] have trying to find your uh your
[02:38:11] treasure that you think may be going
[02:38:13] on as you're swinging that sword oh

[02:38:41] spider how can you eat it it's too
[02:38:43] big you have to try to kill it first I
[02:38:46] guess right so you can go a you can
[02:38:48] swing for its head arm or legs or body
[02:38:52] and you can try to protect yourself
[02:38:55] here which part of you want to attack so
[02:38:57] you can eat it yeah maybe you can cut it
[02:38:59] up and eat it that's not a bad idea
[02:39:00] start a little fire after and eat it get
[02:39:02] your health back but you have to kill it
[02:39:07] first what do you want to do you have
[02:39:10] your head leg arm or body use a new
[02:39:15] sword swing at legs try not to kill him
[02:39:17] just leave him defenseless all right I
[02:39:19] like it
[02:39:20] he's got 50 you got your new sword which
[02:39:21] is a bit stronger which is nice so you

[02:39:47] the pirate swings at his legs with his
[02:39:49] new large sword he chops three of them
[02:39:52] off I like it spider's not out happy
[02:39:55] about that though because he lashes out
[02:39:57] you with his web and it's a little bit
[02:40:00] of stickiness he hits you hey Mahaya
[02:40:02] how's it going you are now though you
[02:40:05] bring him down because you took his legs
[02:40:07] off down to 31 Health that was a good
[02:40:09] hit there but he hits you bringing you
[02:40:11] down to 85 from your
[02:40:13] 93 what do you want to do now my friend
[02:40:16] you could potentially block with your
[02:40:17] Shield too
[02:40:20] or you can um you can use either of them
[02:40:22] you or you can just swing and try to
[02:40:25] attack wildly chopping off
[02:40:29] legs the adventure is a pirate Adventure
[02:40:32] we're currently a pirate using our map
[02:40:35] to go through
[02:40:38] the tropical
[02:40:40] island you're going to swing on his legs
[02:40:43] you don't care that he swing he spit
[02:40:45] some uh web at you you swing in his legs
[02:40:47] again and go I'm taking this thing out
[02:40:55] so you swing again
[02:40:58] and nothing no hit you get I mean you
[02:41:01] get a good hit you didn't miss him you
[02:41:02] missed him you didn't miss him you get a
[02:41:04] hit you chop
[02:41:06] off a couple more legs nice one MC
[02:41:09] Brennan I like it he's now down instead
[02:41:12] of gting those three legs there he's
[02:41:13] down to two legs he's wobbling he can
[02:41:16] barely stand up and he is at
[02:41:20] eight
[02:41:21] health he's almost defenseless but he
[02:41:23] shoots his web one more time and hits
[02:41:26] you this one's a bad one hits you it
[02:41:28] brings you down to 71 Health it's not
[02:41:31] good let's see what happens though MC
[02:41:33] Brennan you want to try to block at all
[02:41:36] or you just want to swing wildly trying
[02:41:37] to get as much damage as possible
[02:41:42] again yes I can go over um hold on I can
[02:41:47] literally go over like now and do
[02:41:55] that that answers how many legs he has
[02:41:57] there you
[02:41:58] go yep there you
[02:42:02] go sorry I didn't catch that the
[02:42:05] adventure
[02:42:07] yes sorry I missed
[02:42:14] that yes he's got a couple couple arms
[02:42:17] there in the front that he can SP use
[02:42:18] but that's body he's falling the ground
[02:42:20] use the shield and try to block that one
[02:42:22] attack and then
[02:42:24] go ham I like it all right I can do
[02:42:27] that we're GNA use our
[02:42:30] Shield he spits out at you because he's
[02:42:33] mad use your shield and let's see we
[02:42:35] just randomly try to we use one of these
[02:42:37] and we see if it
[02:42:42] works oh
[02:42:44] no oh no he hits you because you miss
[02:42:49] you see the red on there that means you
[02:42:51] missed oh no you missed and he hits
[02:42:54] you but he hits you well and your and
[02:42:58] you block a little bit of it with the
[02:43:00] shield block a little with the shield
[02:43:02] instead of going for a large one it only
[02:43:04] small hit bring you down to 65 Health
[02:43:06] but you do swing wildly killing
[02:43:09] that
[02:43:11] spider good Oblivion how you doing now
[02:43:14] Frank let me
[02:43:16] um jump over there

[02:43:23] thing now Frank let me know when you're
[02:43:25] ready and I will um I'll get a single
[02:43:29] there like we talked about just throw
[02:43:31] out it throw it in so it's like a yeah
[02:43:35] do everything that you
[02:43:37] need so MC
[02:43:39] Brennan you
[02:43:44] have you have killed this spider you
[02:43:49] said you want to eat
[02:43:52] it
[02:43:53] so let's eat it you sit
[02:43:57] down oh this is a new one we have to do
[02:44:04] this hold on
[02:44:24] let's see if I can do that
[02:44:26] quickly there is going to be a benefit
[02:44:44] yes okay here we go got that running
[02:44:47] what are we going to do the benefit
[02:44:49] yes so your pirate decides um you know
[02:44:53] I'm hungry
[02:44:54] here he says you know what fine he sits
[02:44:59] down
[02:45:02] and go there sits down and he starts
[02:45:06] eating that
[02:45:08] spider yum
[02:45:11] delicious the spider helps his health
[02:45:14] starts getting a little
[02:45:16] stronger and instead of having that
[02:45:20] Health all the way down to
[02:45:24] uh 65 your health has gone back up but
[02:45:28] it hasn't gone all the way up to 150
[02:45:29] which your health is normally at it only
[02:45:31] goes up
[02:45:33] to
[02:45:40] 17 117 from 65 but that's a good good
[02:45:44] lift up there from you now what happens
[02:45:46] though is because you eat the
[02:45:50] fighter you start getting some weird
[02:45:52] senses and tingles every now and
[02:45:54] again we'll see what happens does that
[02:45:57] going to help you I don't know maybe
[02:46:00] you'll be able to climb not jump I'm not
[02:46:02] sure yet but
[02:46:04] something something's going
[02:46:08] on little cumin on the spiral Spiral

[05:11:25] haven't been able to figure it out yet
[05:11:27] for our
[05:11:33] game been trying to get everybody I'd
[05:11:35] like to play through the adventure but I
[05:11:37] I need to know if you guys can help me
[05:11:39] it's like that's running
[05:11:40] there and what you have is you get these
[05:11:48] cards as the in them with them written
[05:11:50] on them or um the
[05:11:54] packs or is it just that uh people
[05:11:57] played for a little bit and we're uh
[05:11:59] we're a little tired of
[05:12:00] it and I haven't figured it out
[05:12:07] yet all right we're going to put
[05:12:10] out I don't have any death touch on
[05:12:12] those ones right there let's see if you
[05:12:14] have any these
[05:12:37] instead no death touch and LIF link we
[05:12:41] do
[05:12:44] have that be red not not to be there
[05:12:47] Life Link will be there death touch will
[05:12:49] be in these
[05:13:10] let's
[05:13:13] see
[05:13:15] rats got some
[05:13:22] rats got some
[05:13:24] impression
[05:13:29] rankle ah there you go sanguin Bond it's
[05:13:33] a nice one
[05:13:41] Tangled Rats the
[05:13:43] end wasti
[05:13:51] knot ah yeah all right all right that
[05:13:54] might be what it is so then I have to
[05:13:56] adjust it then so I'll have to adjust it
[05:13:58] then maybe I lower the price so that
[05:14:00] they are uh then I'll have to adjust the
[05:14:03] other
[05:14:04] boxes higher then see that's the problem
[05:14:08] wanted to keep all all of them at the
[05:14:09] same price throughout the thing so I
[05:14:11] guess we'll just have to make an
[05:14:13] adjustment probably I'll do some
[05:14:15] adjustments later
[05:14:20] today
[05:14:23] yeah yep that's probably what it is

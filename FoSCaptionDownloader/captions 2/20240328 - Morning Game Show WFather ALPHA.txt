[00:03:20] jump in and have some fun here oh why
[00:03:22] did my checko where did my checko that
[00:03:24] just appeared weird I hate when it does
[00:03:26] that whatever whatever we're going to do
[00:03:30] this I'm going to put those up there for
[00:03:32] a little Adventure in the um in the
[00:03:34] Wasteland for you all that like to do
[00:03:36] those you see how much strength you'll
[00:03:39] get
[00:03:40] there let you choose your
[00:03:44] character and see what you want to do on
[00:03:46] that trip in the
[00:03:49] Wasteland or we can do any of the other
[00:03:51] many games that we have we've been
[00:03:54] trying to do a little game show thing
[00:03:55] get stuff going uh different ones if you
[00:03:58] like them uh I was looking to do
[00:04:00] something kind of like a Plinko like
[00:04:02] thing is that something that would be
[00:04:08] interesting is that interesting for you
[00:04:10] why didn't that
[00:04:12] run oh no come on
[00:04:18] run there we
[00:04:20] go yeah it is all right see my wife said
[00:04:23] that would be a fun one I'm like all
[00:04:25] right I'll have to find a figure out a
[00:04:26] way to do that where I can get where we
[00:04:28] can do it as a gambling aspect of it so
[00:04:30] I think if it's where we choose
[00:04:32] something and we're not actually buying
[00:04:34] it you're getting something the end it's
[00:04:35] just more of like a choice of what's
[00:04:37] going to occur I think that's how we can
[00:04:39] play it um that's why we've been playing
[00:04:41] it now that's why I was able to do these
[00:04:43] these still do it with you're playing
[00:04:44] the boss here because you do still fight
[00:04:46] the boss but the only difference is is
[00:04:47] uh now instead you can
[00:04:51] um where you beat the boss you used to
[00:04:53] be able you used to get the pack for for
[00:04:55] it if you beat a boss which is just a
[00:04:57] free thing that I gave out saying kind
[00:04:59] of thank you but I guess somebody had
[00:05:00] complained that they didn't get one and
[00:05:03] it was uh I guess they considered
[00:05:04] gambling when I gave something away for
[00:05:06] free so um I had to do the same exact
[00:05:10] thing for everybody because somebody
[00:05:11] complained which is why we have the
[00:05:12] Vault packs for everyone and then uh we
[00:05:15] do the the giveaway the uh the $1 Loot
[00:05:17] drop there so we're going to put these
[00:05:19] ones away and I'll do some gies like I
[00:05:21] normally do get some uh cards up here
[00:05:24] running for you all see if you want

[00:09:31] boxes there for if you want to do the uh
[00:09:33] the red button there or um that's the
[00:09:35] only one that I got over there at the
[00:09:36] moment I'll get one of the other one set
[00:09:37] up a little while here we got a nice R
[00:09:41] card one two three four five six seven
[00:09:45] because we like the spoilers the end
[00:09:46] here no one's ever complained about me
[00:09:49] doing this and if somebody does I won't
[00:09:50] do it for them I'll make sure I keep it
[00:09:52] that way but it's just one of those I
[00:09:53] like to see it I like to see his SP man
[00:09:55] Rampage bredon L cor low left giant
[00:09:58] carry
[00:09:59] grub cadav imp prophetic prism exploros
[00:10:04] scope Commander sphere I like those Arts
[00:10:07] Mountain cartographers Hawk bryland the
[00:10:10] moon Kraken braids conjurer de I got hit

[00:10:17] storm Scourge Kraken that's not a bad
[00:10:19] one there loyal retainers that's a nice
[00:10:22] little hit
[00:10:24] there ancestral blade foil in an alrai
[00:10:28] nice loyal
[00:10:30] retainers with your uh storm surge
[00:10:33] Kraken pretty good right
[00:10:35] there maybe not a Lotus but still some
[00:10:38] nice cards and some good playing
[00:10:41] ones let me go do this for you and I'm
[00:10:45] going to put that together and I will
[00:10:47] get this uh I'll check that and make
[00:10:49] sure it does if I think it might need to
[00:10:50] go in a top loader but I'm not 100% not
[00:10:53] 100% on it so I have to double check
[00:10:58] Renee
[00:10:59] there you go
[00:11:05] buddy there we go real rny
[00:11:08] T got you down there so much more room
[00:11:11] to do stuff here when I had this
[00:11:12] organized this way I like it I like it
[00:11:15] there you go renie all right so renie
[00:11:18] got
[00:11:20] that why doesn't the game win a bigger
[00:11:23] prize so um
[00:11:26] because uh I used to
[00:11:30] and um somebody complained it was
[00:11:32] considered gambling when I gave
[00:11:33] something away free and they didn't get
[00:11:35] one of them free uh for the prize so I
[00:11:39] have to do it differently um I everybody
[00:11:41] has to get the same thing and then I
[00:11:44] have to be able to put something like it
[00:11:45] it wouldn't be considered gambling so
[00:11:47] that's why I have to do with the every
[00:11:48] if you win it goes up for a $1 loot
[00:11:51] backdrop so that everybody gets a chance
[00:11:53] to get it because there's some people in
[00:11:55] the world that are unhappy with um not
[00:11:58] getting something free free from
[00:11:59] somebody enough that they will complain
[00:12:02] to the point that they tried to get me
[00:12:04] suspended that's the reason why it's sad
[00:12:08] but I have to I guess my that what I
[00:12:11] thought was something as a free gift
[00:12:13] what they somebody considered that as an
[00:12:15] incentive to gamble in some way is the
[00:12:18] way it was explained to me and um so I
[00:12:21] can't do that anymore I have to give
[00:12:23] everybody the same exact type of thing
[00:12:26] so you can thank the complainers for um
[00:12:28] the change in the game swore
[00:12:31] it if you heard me on that one I can't
[00:12:33] do anything about that I'm doing the
[00:12:35] best I can here within the rules yeah
[00:12:38] yeah that's pretty much why what what
[00:12:40] happened there yep that's pretty much
[00:12:42] what happened and I I had to I have to
[00:12:44] stay within the rules or they will
[00:12:45] suspend me so uh that's that's what I'm
[00:12:48] here for that's what I'm doing this for
[00:12:50] so you know what since we put that up
[00:12:52] there and we pulled out that yesterday
[00:12:54] I'm going to do this with our adventure
[00:12:55] game right now actually we're going to
[00:12:57] put up this and we're going to put up
[00:12:59] this for our adventure game cuz let's
[00:13:00] see if we can pull out a um a nice
[00:13:03] wristi maybe ourselves in one of these
[00:13:05] or a uh or a or a um one of the uh nice
[00:13:10] um what do you call it ones confettis
[00:13:13] that'd be nice what do you think pretty
[00:13:15] good deal on those and I see you go you
[00:13:18] w that there give me one sec I will get
[00:13:20] that up
[00:13:22] there let's see what we get out of this
[00:13:25] one I'm going to run this we'll do uh we
[00:13:28] can do um why not we'll do the adventure
[00:13:30] or the pogman battle it's up to you all
[00:13:33] it's up to you all we'll start it with
[00:13:35] this one instead yeah we'll do the
[00:13:36] adventure first because we like the
[00:13:38] adventure people like that and if you
[00:13:39] want to do one of the other ones you can
[00:13:41] always let me
[00:13:42] know um I didn't think it was different
[00:13:44] than pole boxes quite frankly uh but
[00:13:47] somebody complained enough that I had to
[00:13:48] change it that's all I'm saying I don't
[00:13:50] know man I I really don't know um I will
[00:13:53] just say that there was some suspicious
[00:13:55] people that showed up in here the day
[00:13:56] that I got a suspension notice or not a
[00:13:59] suspension notice a a warning you know
[00:14:01] what I mean all right we got this coming
[00:14:04] up here this is what you got let's get
[00:14:07] you some good luck our friend Stacy all
[00:14:10] right
[00:14:12] yes um so I'll leave it at that you can
[00:14:15] figure out what I mean by interesting
[00:14:16] people showing up um I I'll say I had a
[00:14:19] very large group of people in here and
[00:14:21] then some random interesting people
[00:14:22] showed up in here one two three four and
[00:14:26] five because we like those spoilers at
[00:14:28] the end here all right let's see what we
[00:14:30] get desending financia back for seconds
[00:14:34] cursed courtier unassuming Sage living
[00:14:37] lecturn bespoke battle guard beanock
[00:14:39] worm bellowing Bruiser Feed The Cauldron
[00:14:43] aquatic Alchemist conceded wit Spectre
[00:14:46] of Mor mortality that's a nice little
[00:14:48] hit there impact trimmers cut in foil a
[00:14:52] swamp in a nightmare no no ristic study
[00:14:55] this time but still that's a pretty
[00:14:57] decent pack of cards there
[00:15:04] because um outcome is predetermined by
[00:15:07] card pick not chance yes see it wasn't
[00:15:09] um see they got three packs of cards um
[00:15:13] and that was guaranteed what they were
[00:15:14] getting um we did a game that was just
[00:15:16] they would get something extra which
[00:15:18] from what my understanding based on the
[00:15:19] rules you could do something extra for
[00:15:21] free um so the game was the extra thing
[00:15:24] for free where they could win at the
[00:15:26] highest they could get a um like a pack
[00:15:29] of something we do a wheel that would
[00:15:30] spin for a pack and at the regular they
[00:15:32] would just get one of the Vault packs
[00:15:33] well somebody complained that somebody
[00:15:35] got one and they only got a vault pack I
[00:15:37] guess so everybody has to do the Vault
[00:15:39] pack thing and thank you Robert for the
[00:15:40] explanation there that does help that's
[00:15:42] a little bit clearer on what things were
[00:15:44] for everybody here so yeah uh it's it's
[00:15:47] um it's the pole boxes are exactly
[00:15:49] they're predetermined and the way they
[00:15:50] explained it was that was not
[00:15:51] predetermined am I guess but it's free
[00:15:54] and you told you you can do a free thing
[00:15:56] but they said well even though it's even
[00:15:58] though it's a free thing it still needs
[00:15:59] to be predetermined I'm like
[00:16:02] oh
[00:16:04] okay so that's how it that's how it was
[00:16:07] to me and that's how it was explained
[00:16:08] and that's why I needed to correct
[00:16:11] it it was a fun game it was pretty fun
[00:16:15] uh you know I I had a lot of people that
[00:16:16] liked it but you know what can you do
[00:16:18] about it you got to do it one way can't
[00:16:19] do it you got to do make sure you stay
[00:16:21] within their rules even though even
[00:16:23] though it was like you were giving
[00:16:23] something away I was giving it away as a
[00:16:25] free item I never actually you know took
[00:16:28] anything from it but hey what I mean it
[00:16:31] wasn't everything like you know I don't
[00:16:32] know
[00:16:35] whatever yeah whatever hey it happens it
[00:16:38] happens I try to do my thing and I try
[00:16:40] to be nice that's why we're back to
[00:16:41] doing it this way trying to do it um I
[00:16:43] made a different like I said I made an
[00:16:44] adjustment so that everything is exactly
[00:16:47] the same but to get the big option now
[00:16:50] we do it as a $1 Loot drop that way
[00:16:52] everybody has a chance there's no
[00:16:53] gambling in any way shape or form it's
[00:16:56] all exactly knowing what you're getting
[00:17:01] and that was my understanding of what it
[00:17:02] is and thank you that for that
[00:17:03] explanation of
[00:17:06] that dude I don't know what to explain
[00:17:08] to you
[00:17:12] man I'm telling you I don't know how to
[00:17:14] explain it to you personally I think um
[00:17:16] most of the stuff that they do like
[00:17:18] especially when you have the pull boxes
[00:17:20] that are like you have like a a scent
[00:17:22] card or like A1 th000 card and you pay
[00:17:25] $20 to get into it and you get a 1-cent
[00:17:27] card that seems like gambling to me
[00:17:30] that's always seemed like it that's why
[00:17:32] I always try to set it where you get
[00:17:33] what you pay for and then you get
[00:17:34] something extra from me that's what I
[00:17:37] always are try to do it which is why I
[00:17:39] was like this wasn't gambling it's kind
[00:17:40] of like when you go to McDonald's you
[00:17:42] buy a uh you buy your thing at
[00:17:44] McDonald's and you get the um you get
[00:17:46] the uh McDonald's uh you know the the uh
[00:17:49] the Monopoly card was kind of the way I
[00:17:51] was tra trading it as like you get a
[00:17:53] monopoly card is that you buy your
[00:17:55] product and then you get an extra game
[00:17:57] as like a thing like a monopoly card
[00:17:59] card so but people didn't like it I
[00:18:02] guess they had to complaint about it so
[00:18:03] I had to um I had to make a change so I
[00:18:06] made a change to what I do now which is
[00:18:09] the best way I can do it now to keep the
[00:18:10] game going um it's not as good as it
[00:18:13] used to be obviously but hey a lot of
[00:18:15] people end up getting the $1 Loot drop
[00:18:16] anyways for pretty close to a dollar
[00:18:18] just because of uh what people doing
[00:18:20] we're putting the sourcer scroll up here
[00:18:22] just so you can remember to follow on
[00:18:23] YouTube and Instagram we would
[00:18:24] appreciate that would appreciate it a
[00:18:27] lot thank you very much
[00:18:30] yes it is pretty fun though either way
[00:18:32] even when you're um even without doing
[00:18:34] it it is still pretty fun that you get
[00:18:37] to play the game you still get your pack
[00:18:38] your Vault pack every time we're putting
[00:18:40] a little variety up here right now since
[00:18:42] I have a variety of things now you guys
[00:18:44] can choose anything you want I have all
[00:18:45] the packs there um so it's nice and easy
[00:18:48] for you to see it's also in the buy now

[00:18:52] throw these up here's a little variety
[00:18:54] if you want why didn't this just stay oh
[00:18:57] God but yeah I don't know that's what I
[00:18:59] did there and um I'm back I did the
[00:19:02] correct things make sure I'm doing it
[00:19:04] appropriate within their rules and uh I
[00:19:07] everything from my understanding is I
[00:19:09] actually uh ended up having to get a
[00:19:10] lawyer I work for a bunch of lawyers so
[00:19:12] I end I end up having to get a lawyer
[00:19:13] through my job they you know I pay for
[00:19:15] something so I get them really cheaply
[00:19:17] at free pretty much free it's like $3 a
[00:19:19] month for it but I uh so I have uh I
[00:19:22] talked to one of them and they pretty
[00:19:23] much I was told that I cannot do stuff
[00:19:25] in the way that you were saying Robert
[00:19:27] and uh that's why it has to be
[00:19:29] uh strictly they need to know exactly
[00:19:30] what they're getting every time and as
[00:19:32] soon as that's that's that way then I'm
[00:19:34] going to be

[00:27:40] in this Wasteland that's what they were
[00:27:41] looking for so now you maybe will find a
[00:27:43] friend on your trip to the Wasteland
[00:27:45] here we're going to go and we're
[00:27:47] hopefully going to hunt down and we're
[00:27:48] going to pump into one of our fungus
[00:27:50] dinosaurs let's see what we get here on
[00:27:53] our way through the Wasteland we have
[00:27:55] wonderful you find your friend the
[00:27:58] fungus dinosaur comes wandering through
[00:28:00] the Wasteland goes hey buddy jump on my
[00:28:02] back let me help you on your trip so
[00:28:04] you're a little bit tired there because
[00:28:06] you didn't have enough food but that's
[00:28:07] okay you're now up to four strength as
[00:28:09] you wander through the Wasteland here
[00:28:11] you now have your chance to beat the
[00:28:13] boss there are
[00:28:16] three four of the 10 bosses you could
[00:28:19] potentially beat here since you said
[00:28:21] random we do random for them all here we
[00:28:23] go I'm going to go with the one that was
[00:28:24] kind of hiding I think the one that was
[00:28:26] hiding is scared of you in your big
[00:28:28] fungus dinosaur here we go you're going
[00:28:30] towards and you see a vault in the
[00:28:31] distance you go I'm going to go hide in
[00:28:33] that and rest and recuperate find some
[00:28:34] food what happens oh no the incinerate
[00:28:39] of the guilty comes flying by burning up
[00:28:42] that Wasteland your fungus dinosaur
[00:28:45] charges ahead you jump off of it luckily
[00:28:47] able to save yourself into that Vault
[00:28:51] where in the distance you find in a safe
[00:28:55] one of these up here which is like I
[00:28:57] said it's just a little freak VA pack
[00:28:58] which one would you like to go with my
[00:29:00] kids pick those and stuff those we might
[00:29:03] have to do some more after Today's Show
[00:29:04] though I think we might need to do more
[00:29:06] where would you like to go for one of
[00:29:07] the Vault packs up here it's the
[00:29:09] envelopes that you got middle one all
[00:29:13] right we're going to go this middle one
[00:29:14] right here all right let's see what the
[00:29:16] kids packed up here that's what they
[00:29:19] like to do some things to help and this
[00:29:21] is one of the things they can do all
[00:29:22] right so somebody thought during the uh
[00:29:25] end of the world that this pack of cars
[00:29:27] from 19
[00:29:29] 1997 having to do with the Hunchback of
[00:29:31] notra Dame needed to be saved now these
[00:29:34] ones are a lot cooler than I thought by
[00:29:35] the way these are puzzles and popup
[00:29:38] things somebody had one the other day
[00:29:40] this is really going to be cool if you
[00:29:41] have a kid or a niece or a nephew to
[00:29:43] give that to that they'd be actually
[00:29:45] pretty excited about that I think but
[00:29:47] anyways let's get these ripped open you
[00:29:49] still got this here we were almost close
[00:29:51] to beating that boss sometimes when we
[00:29:53] get close to beating a boss
[00:29:55] though sometimes with an incinerator or
[00:29:57] something like that comes around the
[00:29:59] Wasteland a Loot drop occurs because uh
[00:30:04] there's like a fire and a lot of
[00:30:06] Destruction in the Wasteland destroys
[00:30:08] buildings when that occurs sometimes
[00:30:11] there's a loop drop and I feel like
[00:30:12] right now is one of those situations
[00:30:14] because that big dinosaur going running
[00:30:16] through on your fungus dinosaur along
[00:30:19] with the incinerator blowing up the
[00:30:20] Wasteland had to have destroyed some
[00:30:22] buildings there for something to fall
[00:30:24] out I feel like this is going to fall
[00:30:26] out for a loot pack and Wasteland here
[00:30:28] while we open our packs let's see if you
[00:30:31] guys want to jump on that for uh it's
[00:30:33] going to be on for two minutes here that
[00:30:34] way we can open up some of our packs all
[00:30:35] right that is our loot pack there and
[00:30:38] we're going to open these up for our
[00:30:39] buddy that got it DZ retro we always
[00:30:43] want them opened here now do you want me
[00:30:45] to open up your uh your your super duper
[00:30:48] cool Hunchback one or do we want to do a
[00:30:50] uh do you want me to send that home so
[00:30:51] you can have that for for like a family
[00:30:53] member or
[00:30:55] something here we go let's get this nice

[00:40:41] what we call a pick your own
[00:40:45] break now you can pick it normally

[00:41:04] going to put this up for
[00:41:10] this all
[00:41:14] right now what this is is the first of
[00:41:18] two you're going to pick it you're going
[00:41:20] to pick either which ones you want and
[00:41:22] then we do this where you can either do
[00:41:23] one of two things generally we what I do

[00:41:31] and then you because you get your two of
[00:41:32] the Lost Caverns there um some people if
[00:41:35] you want to do a bigger one we can do
[00:41:37] one where we do it like a color break or
[00:41:39] a digit break I've done those before so
[00:41:42] we can do it that way if we have a
[00:41:43] larger group of people but this is where
[00:41:45] uh we do a little smaller one kind I
[00:41:47] guess call it a mini break you could
[00:41:48] call it in a way and see what happens
[00:41:50] there no one wants to do any of these so

[00:43:13] have in there like oh crap sorry about
[00:43:16] that how about this we do um let's try
[00:43:20] this one
[00:43:22] here we'll try this one instead we're
[00:43:25] going to do
[00:43:34] G do this one maybe let's see if we do
[00:43:37] this one maybe if some of you guys like
[00:43:39] this game a little bit this one was a
[00:43:41] fun one just give me a second here I
[00:43:44] wasn't prepared to do this one right
[00:43:47] away because I wasn't thinking of doing
[00:43:53] it so what I'm doing here is getting a
[00:43:56] little bit ready
[00:43:58] so I can get him going here to do
[00:44:03] it all right here we go this is what
[00:44:05] we're going to do right
[00:44:07] now right
[00:44:09] there and that is going to stay
[00:44:12] here all right
[00:44:14] so this was the
[00:44:17] um high low that we had played before
[00:44:20] all right so it's it's kind of like a
[00:44:22] little way to get to the
[00:44:24] boss just a little a game you always uh
[00:44:27] when you do play it you get one of the
[00:44:29] Vault packs just to say Thank you so
[00:44:32] this is what we're going to do here all
[00:44:34] right we're g to
[00:44:37] do
[00:44:39] that that
[00:44:42] and that g to do that that and that
[00:44:46] that's what we're going to do all right
[00:44:48] I'm going to write this on them now I
[00:44:50] haven't figured out yet how to do this
[00:44:52] differently I've been trying to do it
[00:44:53] where I can do it with like somehow the
[00:44:56] value and if somebody can figure out how
[00:44:57] to do it with the value of the card I
[00:44:59] would very much appreciate
[00:45:02] that all right so what this one
[00:45:05] is there are three cards you're going to
[00:45:08] you you're going to get one of the three
[00:45:10] no matter what but this auction goes up
[00:45:12] for a dollar these are a dollar card
[00:45:15] auctions you get one of the three here
[00:45:17] all right and then what happens is we
[00:45:20] play high low where we roll our
[00:45:23] dice all right because what happens is
[00:45:25] you pick on the back of them whether
[00:45:26] they say high or low I've been trying to
[00:45:28] figure out how to do with price where
[00:45:29] you aren't going to be able to sneak
[00:45:30] away and figure out how to get it online
[00:45:32] but anyways my point is uh you roll the
[00:45:35] dice depending on how many high lows you
[00:45:37] pick you always get one because the card
[00:45:38] you get and if you get up to three what
[00:45:40] you do is it's the strength that you
[00:45:42] would go against the bath boss here to
[00:45:43] see if we do a $1 Loot drop that's how
[00:45:46] we do the high low and you always get
[00:45:47] one of the Vault packs saying thank you
[00:45:49] for hanging out with us so with that
[00:45:52] going I am going to run these I'm going
[00:45:54] to start this at a dollar I'm going to
[00:45:56] do this
[00:45:58] here going to slide this forward so you
[00:46:01] can see the cards
[00:46:01] [Music]
[00:46:04] better all
[00:46:07] right those are the three
[00:46:11] cards that are
[00:46:14] up all right those are the three cards
[00:46:16] right there that are
[00:46:19] up for high low right
[00:46:21] now they're starting at a
[00:46:24] dollar you get one of those three no
[00:46:27] matter what you always get one of those
[00:46:29] three if you go this then we do the uh
[00:46:32] then you TR decide high low on the back
[00:46:34] of it and we roll the dice to see if you
[00:46:35] can beat the boss so we have another $1
[00:46:37] Loot drop or not now you always get one
[00:46:39] of them it's just pick whichever one you
[00:46:41] want currently they're on for a dollar
[00:46:43] which is pretty good deal for those ones
[00:46:45] you got yourself a nice Calamity of
[00:46:47] Titans maybe you want that aels
[00:46:49] Vindicator little foil priest of the
[00:46:52] Forgotten not bad on those there young
[00:46:56] all right young wants one of them which
[00:46:58] one do you want
[00:47:15] young you you want the left one here you
[00:47:18] want priest of the
[00:47:22] Forgotten all right we'll take this all
[00:47:24] right cool yeah now for this do you have
[00:47:26] high or low on the back of
[00:47:32] it just like a 50/50 guess sadly I can't
[00:47:35] that's I'm trying to figure out a better
[00:47:36] way of doing this this is the best I've
[00:47:38] been able to figure out so
[00:47:41] far I'm lagging oh I'm sorry I said um
[00:47:45] do you have high or low written on the
[00:47:47] back of
[00:47:53] this low we have high written on the
[00:47:57] back high so you have high that's one
[00:47:59] you missed one but you always get that
[00:48:01] one anyways because that you always get
[00:48:02] one roll from the purchase what do you
[00:48:04] think go on the back of this one low oh
[00:48:07] you got high again I'm sorry and on this
[00:48:16] one low you got it
[00:48:20] low perfect so you got two two rolls my
[00:48:24] friend cuz you got the one from that one
[00:48:26] and you you got the one from there so
[00:48:28] you got your card there no matter what
[00:48:29] each time all right so we're just going
[00:48:34] to do that we're going to roll this and
[00:48:35] see who can beat the boss get two of
[00:48:37] them oh we got one that's not good
[00:48:40] that's not good let's get a better
[00:48:42] one oh no we got two you know what I
[00:48:45] didn't like the first one because it was
[00:48:47] one we're going to give an extra and it
[00:48:48] got one again you know what the high is
[00:48:50] two my friend so let's see if we can
[00:48:53] bounce off a boss at least D you want to
[00:48:55] tell me which one of the 10 cards you
[00:48:56] want to try to go with since there are
[00:48:58] 10 of them as a boss but I don't think
[00:49:00] you can have a chance you don't have a
[00:49:01] chance to beat one but maybe you can um
[00:49:04] bounce off of one number three one two
[00:49:06] three number three which one is it maybe
[00:49:09] we can bounce off of one oh no
[00:49:12] Triceratops comes crushing through that
[00:49:15] Wasteland trampling on through but you

[01:05:59] Upper Deck I don't know Anastasia movie
[01:06:03] is it a puzzle or something what is this
[01:06:04] I don't understand what this is these
[01:06:07] just scenes from the
[01:06:08] movie I think they're just scenes from
[01:06:10] the movie maybe it's a puzzle I feel
[01:06:14] like it's a puzzle or
[01:06:16] something I don't know I feel like
[01:06:18] that's like a puzzle and you put all the
[01:06:19] pieces together cuz see how it has
[01:06:20] numbers like I feel like if you number
[01:06:22] them all together and you lay them out
[01:06:24] you have like some type of like uh
[01:06:27] picture that makes any sense the way
[01:06:30] this is built

[01:39:02] crushing everything as it goes
[01:39:04] by and that is no good but that's okay
[01:39:08] Dwayne because you get your command
[01:39:10] Tower and you get a choice of one of
[01:39:13] those up there saying thank you for
[01:39:15] playing which one would you
[01:39:20] like random all right we'll do this one

[01:39:28] are your Vault packs packs of cards from
[01:39:30] the early days oh they did another
[01:39:32] Anastasia one there you go you got some
[01:39:35] more Anastasia with you maybe you got a
[01:39:36] little daughter or a niece or a nephew

[01:40:01] Easter type thing there you go my friend
[01:40:04] your command Tower that's a good little
[01:40:05] car
[01:40:07] there see exactly dway that's what I
[01:40:10] mean like these may you may not
[01:40:11] necessarily want it but somebody else
[01:40:13] that's hanging out with you may want to
[01:40:15] have some of them that's why I like how
[01:40:16] giving these away cuz they're fun
[01:40:18] they're just a little fun thing that we
[01:40:20] found to like kind of do a little extra
[01:40:21] with when we're playing our game here
[01:40:23] that's
[01:40:25] all yeah no problem yeah the high low
[01:40:28] isn't bad there just a little fun one
[01:40:30] there and let's uh I tried to I wanted
[01:40:32] to find a way of doing it where I can do
[01:40:34] like say you choose like a monetary
[01:40:36] value on the card and you would say
[01:40:38] whether one was high or low but I can't
[01:40:39] figure out a way of doing that without
[01:40:41] you guys being able to cheat because the
[01:40:43] internet's around and I know you're
[01:40:44] going to cheat just because you guys do
[01:40:48] it we're going to do these ones let's
[01:40:51] throw these ones
[01:40:52] out
[01:40:55] maybe somebody wants to try one of
[01:41:06] these maybe one somebody wants one of
[01:41:08] these for a
[01:41:10] single all right so we're going to put
[01:41:12] these out for tingles we have a thraen
[01:41:15] inspector we have a pick your poison in
[01:41:18] an Insidious Roots now thraen inspector
[01:41:20] isn't foil there just so you are aware
[01:41:23] there I'm going to move that down so you
[01:41:24] can see them a little bit better too
[01:41:27] there you go so you should be able to
[01:41:28] see those cards a little bit better
[01:41:30] those are what are up there we're going
[01:41:32] to run that auction again start that one
[01:41:34] at a dollar for our um for our thing
[01:41:39] here where is it there it is and you get
[01:41:43] one of these cards for a dollar and then
[01:41:46] you uh you do the uh high low game
[01:41:49] after I'm doing pretty oh doing pretty
[01:41:53] good there doing pretty good thank you
[01:41:54] for asking if you beat the boss we do a
[01:41:57] $1 Loot drop which is a like a pack of
[01:42:00] cards could be anything from like an
[01:42:02] aoria booster to maybe I'm feeling
[01:42:04] generous and throw out like a you know a
[01:42:07] wild drain collector booster at the end
[01:42:09] of the stream seeing if somebody wants
[01:42:11] to try to pull one of those out I don't
[01:42:12] know but it ends up being a $1 Loot drop
[01:42:15] I used to be it where I gave something
[01:42:17] away but somebody complained that they
[01:42:19] didn't get it so I couldn't do it
[01:42:21] anymore and I have to do it this way now
[01:42:23] that's the only thing that stinks about
[01:42:25] it is um I used to do it hey Dwayne look
[01:42:28] at that you just got a loyal
[01:42:33] Apprentice
[01:42:36] nice but yeah I used to do it where if
[01:42:38] you beat the boss there was um a free um
[01:42:43] like you got a free pack of cards but
[01:42:45] because I guess at the end of it you can
[01:42:48] I guess that would be considered some
[01:42:49] way of um they thought they'd consider
[01:42:51] that gambling here even though it was
[01:42:53] like like a free thing I was giving away
[01:42:54] oops I knocked the camera even though it
[01:42:56] was a free thing I was giving away they
[01:42:57] said it was gambling because I was
[01:42:59] incentiv people incentivizing people to
[01:43:01] buy something or something like that um
[01:43:03] but so I had to change the rules and do
[01:43:06] it the way I have it now it's just uh
[01:43:08] one of the things that I just had to go
[01:43:10] about and make a change to make sure
[01:43:11] it's within the within the rules of
[01:43:14] whatnot in their
[01:43:18] things run those three again I'll do
[01:43:21] that I will definitely do that
[01:43:24] we have thraen inspector Insidious roots
[01:43:29] and a pick your poison that's what we
[01:43:32] got right

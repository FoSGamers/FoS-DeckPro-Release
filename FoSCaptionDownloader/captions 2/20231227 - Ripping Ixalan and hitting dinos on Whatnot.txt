[00:06:43] stuff like that they weren't really um
[00:06:46] here I'm hoping it was because it was

[00:12:05] box deal you guys look that you um so
[00:12:09] what I'm going to do now though is we do
[00:12:11] singles here and somebody some people do

[00:12:28] to get some
[00:12:31] singles it's going to be a chunk of them
[00:12:33] though it's a good chunk of them for
[00:12:35] $8 well not $8 but each of them if you
[00:12:40] want one each is
[00:12:41] $8 but here we go that's what we do here

[00:12:46] pull box rotation again I'll do your
[00:12:48] pull
[00:12:49] box I'll do another pull boox little
[00:12:51] deal here that's kind of what we do
[00:12:53] unless there's a request by somebody
[00:12:55] specific for a
[00:12:57] deal then I can do those too but here we
[00:13:00] go these are our singles we got we're
[00:13:02] going to come up black gate in Tomb
[00:13:05] Lauren you guys wrong camera angle
[00:13:08] Lauren revealed gadal dismissal
[00:13:11] permission denied 10th Doctor that's a
[00:13:14] foil showcase not just that there's a
[00:13:16] river song surge foil now it's just

[00:13:41] one any any single on
[00:13:44] screen any of the singles on screen let
[00:13:47] me know if there's one you want I mean
[00:13:48] people like permission denied got

[00:13:52] maybe you're a big fan of Doctor Who and

[00:14:01] 10th doctor showcase foil and non-foil
[00:14:04] are like 50 cents different so I put

[00:24:21] skinny cuz when I tried to um put like
[00:24:26] yeah not too bad not too bad we we been
[00:24:30] actually pretty good we had a good
[00:24:31] Christmas had a good
[00:24:32] holiday uh we went we were at Disney
[00:24:34] yesterday with the kids and we had a lot
[00:24:35] of fun there so so uh not too bad I'm
[00:24:39] going to go and run one of my let's run
[00:24:42] some singles like we're going into those
[00:24:44] now I ran those a minute ago but no one
[00:24:47] would like them so we're going to go to
[00:24:48] the next
[00:24:51] level we going to call all
[00:24:56] these
[00:24:59] $66 for any of

[00:25:39] these there you go you could get any of
[00:25:46] those yeah
[00:25:48] okay Jay
[00:25:51] Youngs how you doing thanks for coming
[00:25:53] in hanging out we're just doing a little
[00:25:55] bit of a
[00:25:56] uh singles deal here and then I was
[00:25:59] going to go on next to
[00:26:02] uh a pack deal actually I think I did
[00:26:05] because I did a pull box deal did a
[00:26:07] single deal think it's now on to a pack
[00:26:10] deal right yeah I think that's how we go
[00:26:12] we rotate around doing those things hey
[00:26:14] well skinny you know you know you need
[00:26:16] you need to
[00:26:17] um let me know if there's any uh
[00:26:20] anything that you get from them that
[00:26:23] asking a question because I did say they
[00:26:24] were all from the same person that way
[00:26:26] maybe that maybe they like asking you
[00:26:28] anything and we can maybe speed it
[00:26:37] along so he needed to end up getting a
[00:26:39] direct one too okay yeah I figured
[00:26:42] that's what was going to happen is
[00:26:43] because they were for whatever reason
[00:26:45] they didn't they couldn't figure out how
[00:26:47] to put in uh
[00:26:50] your your your address right so we got
[00:26:55] this random whatever they did put in and
[00:26:57] now what every time somebody tries to
[00:26:59] make a a an order for you it just
[00:27:03] breaks so yeah that's what I'm guessing
[00:27:05] has occurred there we
[00:27:12] have we're going to call
[00:27:19] this no we'll do
[00:27:24] that come
[00:27:26] on
[00:27:30] we'll do that right now come
[00:27:33] on a come on three packs on screen let's
[00:27:37] get this going just come on just give me
[00:27:39] an give me a second just give me a
[00:27:41] problem
[00:27:42] here what not sometimes is glitching on
[00:27:44] me and the other day it was putting the
[00:27:46] wrong prices in so I want to make sure
[00:27:47] they're right because every time I go
[00:27:48] and touch it it like changes the price
[00:27:50] it's like it thinks I'm moving the price
[00:27:52] but number there we go
[00:27:55] finally and yeah so far the only
[00:27:57] solution has been for them to force a
[00:27:58] label to me and then emailing them
[00:28:00] directly to the seller yeah yeah with
[00:28:03] the holiday I sent them the stuff and
[00:28:06] what's up

[00:59:18] right let's see what we got we're going
[00:59:20] to
[00:59:23] do
[00:59:34] this is going to end up
[00:59:41] being call that one 33 for those three
[00:59:45] we'll throw that on for 33 get some uh
[00:59:48] get that pack deal
[00:59:51] going that's actually a really good pack
[00:59:53] deal there oh oh

[01:00:02] yeah can remind me to do sudden death on
[01:00:04] the next on the next auction all right
[01:00:06] okay I keep forgetting to do that but
[01:00:09] anyways this one's on here this is
[01:00:11] Will's pack deal Choice can you see this
[01:00:13] whole screen and everything that's there
[01:00:15] or do you only see a portion of it like
[01:00:18] how much of the screen can you see
[01:00:20] because what I can see on my computer
[01:00:22] shows me that you guys can see
[01:00:25] everything you can see my finger
[01:00:28] here and you can see my finger here is
[01:00:31] that
[01:00:33] correct if anybody in here can say that
[01:00:35] or if I'm wrong there and I've been
[01:00:36] having the screen horribly exactly all
[01:00:38] right Perfect all right so my view is
[01:00:41] correct because my view for some reason
[01:00:43] on the camera only shows
[01:00:46] here and
[01:00:48] here so I have to use the um I have to
[01:00:51] use my computer monitor or a second
[01:00:53] monitor of some kind to be able to see
[01:00:55] the full scam that you guys do it's
[01:00:57] weird thank you Texas I appreciate that
[01:00:59] a
[01:01:02] lot it's one of those weird things when
[01:01:04] uh like it's
[01:01:07] like thank you yeah it's it's one of
[01:01:09] those weird things like uh I guess like
[01:01:12] we don't get to see everything maybe
[01:01:14] they want us in a smaller area so that
[01:01:15] make sure that we're in screen that's
[01:01:17] why they do the camera view that like
[01:01:19] that I don't know hey
[01:01:23] panra
[01:01:25] this is uh oh panra coming in with the I
[01:01:27] like it all right this is Wills he
[01:01:30] pulled these babies out here so let's

[01:08:25] box deal here is going to be
[01:08:28] this we're going to do this for the pole
[01:08:30] box deal this was the is the Christmas

[01:08:53] lives mount Doom poster blood moon
[01:08:55] ristic study lur field Mount Doom that
[01:08:57] one is normally a $25 side but because
[01:09:01] you're doing it together here we do a
[01:09:04] deal where you can get it for both sides
[01:09:06] for 29 because this side is normally a
[01:09:09] $6 side which is the green side which is

[01:09:13] not going to read all these ones off but

[01:09:22] cards got some good surge foils got some
[01:09:25] good extended
[01:09:26] Arts that side's normally $6 but when
[01:09:30] you do this deal for 29 what we do here
[01:09:33] is we do it as a
[01:09:38] uh get a buck off each one because it
[01:09:40] allows me to save on whatnot fees and
[01:09:42] when I save on whatnot fees I try to
[01:09:45] pass that savings on to you with my
[01:09:49] um what I can do on deals so that's in

[01:12:35] hoop pack did go through hey I've said

[01:12:39] whenever I have a um poll up
[01:12:45] the sale thing doesn't always show that
[01:12:48] somebody bought a sale so just say hey I
[01:12:50] bought something um and I have no

[01:13:08] they put it behind it and it doesn't
[01:13:13] like behind it sometimes if the
[01:13:14] lettering is not if it's too short of a
[01:13:16] lettering like Doctor Who is shorter
[01:13:19] than the amount of words in the poll it

[01:17:23] lightsaber skittering surveer they were
[01:17:25] actually filled up for the day we had to
[01:17:27] book the day and when we booked the day
[01:17:31] they were already filled up for that day
[01:17:32] uh like two weeks be prior so like I
[01:17:35] guess you need to book that lightsaber
[01:17:37] thing uh like almost a month in advance
[01:17:39] a friend of mine said I'm like oh that
[01:17:42] sucks yeah so we didn't get to do the
[01:17:44] lightsaber but we did the uh build the
[01:17:47] Droid so we built the Droid which is
[01:17:49] what they want to show you now well
[01:17:51] after I RI these packs open we'll show
[01:17:52] you that um we did the build of droid
[01:17:54] which is really fun but the lightsaber
[01:17:56] we're going to do that at we we're going
[01:17:57] to meacon and we're going to build that
[01:17:59] lightsaber that you can actually fight
[01:18:01] each other with and hit and supposedly
[01:18:03] if you hit each other you can Pro
[01:18:04] potentially break a bone if you hit hard
[01:18:05] enough like that type of I guess they're
[01:18:07] like real lightsaber dual ones flywheel
[01:18:14] racer potent Port portant tracker sorry
[01:18:17] I got sidetracked there for a second
[01:18:19] fire AI gargantuan glistening dilu Omen

[01:19:02] the the build this the build a
[01:19:03] lightsaber thing but you know we were we
[01:19:06] were like all right we'll build the
[01:19:07] we'll build the Droid then we'll do um
[01:19:10] the lightsaber at meacon which is like I
[01:19:13] said you can supposedly they're like
[01:19:15] they're light like they do like
[01:19:16] lightsaber duels I guess there's a
[01:19:18] lightsaber duel League where they fight
[01:19:21] where like they're actually
[01:19:24] they have like um armor on because if
[01:19:26] they hit each other they cause bruises
[01:19:28] and they like break bones and stuff yeah

[00:34:14] Mr
[00:34:16] Fong good morning good morning
[00:34:20] monster hey that I know this is I figur
[00:34:22] you know it's not too
[00:34:25] bad correct that is is correct heavy
[00:34:28] that's how I was going to do it this
[00:34:29] morning I want to get things rolling
[00:34:31] this morning with a good with something
[00:34:32] nice and then we'll uh we'll do a
[00:34:33] different one right after i' like to do
[00:34:35] a couple of them during the day but I
[00:34:36] like to get it sted and rolling in the
[00:34:37] morning so those that jump in the
[00:34:39] morning get a good deal you're like oh
[00:34:40] nice you know what I mean you know what
[00:34:43] I
[00:34:45] mean generally we do pretty good with
[00:34:48] them and I I'm
[00:34:54] not like I said the way that I try to
[00:34:56] organize them is more there where I try
[00:34:58] to where I do it where we shuffle them
[00:35:00] up and we hand them out based on your uh
[00:35:04] your spot number now the other thing I
[00:35:07] was thinking of doing later was I was
[00:35:09] actually thinking of doing an entire box
[00:35:11] break on Friday of a m one of the whole
[00:35:15] festival in the boxes that's what I was
[00:35:17] actually thinking of
[00:35:20] doing no so yeah kind of the breaks
[00:35:23] Midler break sprit value of the packs so
[00:35:26] what it would be is um
[00:35:28] for instance um I would open up all the
[00:35:31] packs that are included in the break and
[00:35:33] the way that we do this one is I take
[00:35:36] all of the ones that are all the cards
[00:35:38] that are mythics rares or any uncommon
[00:35:41] or common that is over $3 we put them in
[00:35:43] the sleeves we shuffle them up and we
[00:35:45] hand them out per each spot to everyone
[00:35:47] so one card to each spot I go one two
[00:35:49] three and just hand them out as I after
[00:35:51] I shuffle them all up so like the person
[00:35:53] in spot one would just literally get the
[00:35:54] top card after I shuffled everything and
[00:35:56] then so on so forth all all the way down
[00:35:58] to the last card being handed out to the
[00:36:01] 10 10th spot is really what it
[00:36:05] is but yeah nice you when are you doing

[01:07:36] needed to get rid of them the older
[01:07:37] boats so I gave them an offer that
[01:07:39] wasn't that was low but not not

[01:23:38] homelands was this a little little break
[01:23:40] coming in from
[01:23:42] there I think M Merchant scroll is like
[01:23:44] the biggest hit in homelands it was like
[01:23:45] it wasn't a big not an expensive card
[01:23:48] but that was like the big hit from
[01:23:51] there the only reason I have that is
[01:23:53] because I remember getting homelands and
[01:23:54] I bought some earlier when I had the
[01:23:56] opportunity a while
[01:23:58] back I still have actually some of those

[01:33:14] up then I'm going to go and adjust
[01:33:31] I'm unable to do it that way Young
[01:33:35] Brian the only way I can do that is to
[01:33:37] be able to guarantee that the people
[01:33:38] have the correct age and abilities to be
[01:33:40] able to enter it legally and do
[01:33:42] everything correct legally that's why I
[01:33:43] have to do it through the manner I am
[01:33:54] so I do not have any headaches with that
[01:33:56] that is why we do it this way CU people
[01:33:58] in this world are um insane and they
[01:34:00] will cause problems so I have to do it a
[01:34:02] way that causes legal um security for me
[01:34:09] Brian so if you'd like to you can do it
[01:34:11] the other way and now hopefully you guys
[01:34:13] can all see everything here let me know
[01:34:15] if you
[01:34:20] can yep yep that's the reason why I got
[01:34:22] to do that make sure you guys can see

[01:49:12] are medium I'll say they are medium
[01:49:14] they're not high they're not low I think
[01:49:17] it could be good if they do if they
[01:49:21] don't it depends on on how they do it
[01:49:23] tell you the truth I have recently I had
[01:49:25] uh I've had thought they were going to
[01:49:26] do some things nicely and they didn't so
[01:49:29] at that same time that makes me
[01:49:31] concerned but um the recent I do like
[01:49:33] how they did this new uh the mystery
[01:49:35] booster 2 came out pretty nice here so
[01:49:38] but the thing
[01:49:40] yeah I don't know it's an iffy one for
[01:49:42] me it's like I think it could be
[01:49:45] nice but I have to give I have to do my
[01:49:47] I have to do a bit more research is
[01:49:48] really what it boils down to all
[01:49:51] right I think they'll
[01:49:54] be I did not get anything from
[01:49:56] foundations from magicon no some others
[01:49:59] might have gotten some because I was
[01:50:00] there on I wasn't there on Saturday

[02:17:24] couple times I jumped
[02:17:26] in all right now let me get back to um
[02:17:29] we can get back to opening my other
[02:17:31] stuff that I had
[02:17:34] before rough morning everybody's off to
[02:17:36] work right
[02:17:37] now so there's my other stuff that I had
[02:17:42] there you go there's mine my mystery to
[02:17:46] booster 2 Box all right this is what we
[02:17:49] got here for all of you for the break
[02:17:51] today I'm going to set that right here
[02:17:54] with our sorcery box as you guys can see
[02:17:57] that those are all the things we got in
[02:17:59] our break today we'll be
[02:18:01] using and uh yeah there we go we'll do
[02:18:03] that for that one let's see who wants to
[02:18:06] jump
[02:18:09] in
[02:18:12] yeah yeah it is a good out see that's
[02:18:14] one of the thing is like some people
[02:18:15] like um it's a good way to like kind of
[02:18:16] get out of your shell talk to people
[02:18:18] kind of do something a little unique and
[02:18:19] then one of the nice things about it is
[02:18:21] for people that aren't like maybe as
[02:18:22] comfortable in public it in a way almost
[02:18:25] makes you a little bit more comfortable
[02:18:26] because you um you have a little more
[02:18:29] experience talking to random strangers
[02:18:31] in a way so yeah they might be more in
[02:18:33] person but um you at least can kind of
[02:18:37] adjust a little bit better to talking to
[02:18:40] people in person and then um when nice
[02:18:43] thing too is if you end up meeting some
[02:18:44] of them in person it's even easier
[02:18:46] because you already know them kind of
[02:18:48] know them because you you know what I
[02:18:49] mean it's nice too because you know
[02:18:50] some's personality versus like what they
[02:18:52] look like in any way shape or form cuz I
[02:18:54] know I I mean throughout my life there's
[02:18:56] been a lot of people that I've been
[02:18:57] friendly with or friends with that
[02:18:58] others would look at like you know that
[02:19:00] person are you're friends with that
[02:19:01] person like yeah why what's the problem
[02:19:03] with that like well they just don't seem
[02:19:04] like someone you would know like who
[02:19:07] cares if it seems like someone I know I
[02:19:08] I bumped into them through fishing or I
[02:19:10] I know them through through work or I uh
[02:19:13] met them in college or whatever it is
[02:19:15] you know and that's the nice thing here
[02:19:17] too is you're not going to actually know
[02:19:18] who it is until you bump into them in
[02:19:20] similar situations
[02:19:21] it's fun to me in that aspect if that
[02:19:23] makes any sense I think it is at least
[02:19:26] personally I think it is one of those
[02:19:28] like you get
[02:19:31] to know the person's
[02:19:33] character by gathering with them here ah
[02:19:37] Magic the Gathering you see gather let's
[02:19:39] see if I can get a thumbs up here no no
[02:19:41] we do it for
[02:19:42] me and then you get to a meet him let's
[02:19:44] see what we'll do it we'll do it no oh I
[02:19:47] got a thumbs up yeah it did it it did it

[02:26:13] something and it's about something I did
[02:26:14] a few seconds ago uh so that's I know
[02:26:16] there's something but I didn't know how
[02:26:18] bad I've never actually calculated delay

[02:53:26] strike while attacking this creature
[02:53:28] gets plus one ah power for each red card
[02:53:32] in your graveyard so it's pretty much

[03:01:15] Devastation and double Masters now
[03:01:18] I was going to give everybody here in
[03:01:19] the break an option once we had it going
[03:01:21] but normally what I do is I take all
[03:01:23] them and I break them um all the mythics
[03:01:25] rares Commons and uncommons that are
[03:01:27] worth $3 or more get shuffled up blah
[03:01:29] blah blah I've told you guys all that
[03:01:30] before but since there's six packs and
[03:01:32] six of you I was going to give you the
[03:01:34] option of picking either one pack each
[03:01:36] or me do it the original way and if you
[03:01:39] do the one pack each what I'll end up
[03:01:40] doing is I'll just open up these ones
[03:01:43] also and hand them out and in the way
[03:01:46] that I told you before so
[03:01:48] but that is the uh the way we get we
[03:01:50] like to give some options to you guys

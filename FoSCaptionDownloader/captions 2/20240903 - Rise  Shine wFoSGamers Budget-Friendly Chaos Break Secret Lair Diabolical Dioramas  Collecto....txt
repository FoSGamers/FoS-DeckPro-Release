[00:20:25] there I don't know uh your name is Nick
[00:20:29] Nick croll interesting who's Nick croll
[00:20:33] I don't know who that
[00:20:36] is
[00:20:38] sorry that's is that supposed to hurt me
[00:20:40] because I don't know who that
[00:20:41] is star I see your Mentor all right here
[00:20:44] we go nice one today is 28 days I
[00:20:47] haven't used oh congratulation
[00:20:50] Ashley hey you know what that's one of
[00:20:51] the best things that you can do you know
[00:20:53] what that's when when it happens is like
[00:20:54] your child's like hey please do this
[00:20:56] like I I think I remember like my dad
[00:20:59] mom did when I was a lot younger I don't
[00:21:01] know if it was us necessary but they
[00:21:02] said it was we were part of the reason
[00:21:03] why Ashley look at your luck today well
[00:21:06] you know it's it's I guess it's that was
[00:21:08] it month a month into it almost so there
[00:21:10] you go actually you've got a war squeak
[00:21:12] all right not the next rare that we put
[00:21:14] in there but you do have two of them now
[00:21:18] because you seem to be lucky this
[00:21:19] morning look at that that's insane
[00:21:22] starting out with luck we're going to go
[00:21:25] with number two that seems that makes
[00:21:26] sense that makes sense for the number to
[00:21:28] go with
[00:21:30] so
[00:21:31] Ashley there you go my friend put that
[00:21:33] right in
[00:21:34] there there we are got both of you
[00:21:37] together so your names are together
[00:21:38] there they perfect then you said number
[00:21:42] two but let's do this
[00:21:46] here get number two out
[00:21:49] here yeah I know back to back I guess

[00:23:09] them that's what it was you do that's
[00:23:11] what it
[00:23:17] was yeah see there's a difference
[00:23:19] between that yep no I just I do remember
[00:23:21] when I was younger my mom dad did a
[00:23:23] little bit but that was like really
[00:23:24] young when I had to been like
[00:23:28] eight 10
[00:23:30] area so this would have been in
[00:23:33] the early 80s mid 80s so they put effort
[00:23:37] in back then even which was nice to have
[00:23:39] somebody do that back then when it was
[00:23:41] like acceptable to

[00:26:53] out there from our Benji pack type
[00:26:55] things and throw that in as a um
[00:26:58] as a giveaway
[00:27:00] option number six I like
[00:27:04] it one two three four five six there we
[00:27:09] are and then I need to do
[00:27:14] this and add a card
[00:27:19] in um I believe we do have raccoon
[00:27:22] raller I do believe we do have that
[00:27:25] for we're going to try w d and Athos is
[00:27:29] Commander per oh nice that's a good
[00:27:33] one surprising or unexpected or un um
[00:27:38] that there is
[00:27:39] a that one of the people in Brazil that
[00:27:43] I talked to I'll have to say life with
[00:27:45] daro uh one of the cool things I learned
[00:27:47] is somebody in Brazil I didn't know it
[00:27:49] was as bad as it was for them to pay to
[00:27:51] get stuff in so they got a they had
[00:27:54] gotten a
[00:27:55] giveaway um and we happen to be one of
[00:27:57] the ones I an international one on and
[00:28:00] but because of getting it there they
[00:28:02] actually still even had to pay like $30
[00:28:05] for the most part in taxes of some kind
[00:28:07] of import fees to be able to even pick
[00:28:09] it up that blew my mind I didn't think
[00:28:12] it was that much for and it was not even
[00:28:13] something big it was literally like like
[00:28:15] a pack of cards that blew my mind
[00:28:18] actually that was something crazy that I
[00:28:20] had to learn about about people on
[00:28:21] outside the country having to do rough
[00:28:23] shot Duo yes we do actually have a rough
[00:28:25] shot duo we have a good amount of them I
[00:28:27] think there's a hand couple there's only
[00:28:28] a handful that we didn't have I can't
[00:28:29] remember there's like couple hard ones
[00:28:31] to
[00:28:36] get the OD Acorn gang what is it oh
[00:28:40] interesting not bad

[00:28:55] haven't gotten a chance to go through
[00:28:57] some of the rep things I said I was

[00:29:00] just haven't gotten to all those cards
[00:29:01] yet which are in storage I'm going to
[00:29:02] get through those in a few like over
[00:29:04] time in a few weeks here to get some of
[00:29:06] that stuff like some people ask for rats
[00:29:07] and I think somebody asked for maybe
[00:29:08] some other thing
[00:29:09] too but there you go coming out for $2

[01:25:44] better
[01:25:46] side because we had some fun things that
[01:25:48] we pulled out today

[01:27:58] pin our break here which has eight spots
[01:28:02] left all right eight spots left in our
[01:28:04] break so today between today and
[01:28:07] yesterday this is what we got our right
[01:28:10] side I think beat our left
[01:28:13] side but we'll find out
[01:28:16] here in a second what you guys think
[01:28:19] what you all think if it did it or
[01:28:21] not so those are those we already have a
[01:28:24] high a bigger stack as you can see now
[01:28:27] let's do this let's do a little
[01:28:33] poll

[01:29:47] uh borderless foil so I don't know what
[01:29:50] side do you think won today
[01:29:54] I'm guessing I have a guess on my I I
[01:29:56] have a guess for myself I'm thinking it
[01:29:59] was the uh left side but hey that's just
[01:30:02] my thought that's my
[01:30:08] thought wait did I say this was the
[01:30:10] right side ah whatever this wasn't the
[01:30:13] right side that was the left side but
[01:30:14] we're going to say this is the right
[01:30:15] side anyways keep it with a thing so
[01:30:17] this was the left side here because I
[01:30:19] think I said this was the left side I
[01:30:21] may have made a mistake on that but
[01:30:22] that's okay

[01:39:02] will be so um the programming language
[01:39:05] that they use is not one that I'm
[01:39:06] familiar with I mean I'm familiar with
[01:39:08] it but I don't use it so I'd have to re
[01:39:10] I'd have to learn a programming language
[01:39:11] and stuff like that so I don't know if
[01:39:13] I'm G to end up picking up the project
[01:39:14] or if I should just continue on with
[01:39:16] mine that I had partially working but
[01:39:19] not fully
[01:39:20] working because the way I was doing it
[01:39:22] was a little bit of a different
[01:39:24] way to uh of
[01:39:27] it I think it was
[01:39:30] react react on base with uh AWS Lambda
[01:39:34] like I've used AWS Lambda before um I've
[01:39:37] us I haven't done any coding in react
[01:39:39] but I know react like i' I've seen it
[01:39:41] and stuff like that I just haven't done
[01:39:42] any coding in it
[01:39:44] specifically that's what my issue is in
[01:39:46] general with that like if I haven't done
[01:39:47] it before I don't know what I'm doing so
[01:39:49] I can't pick something up project
[01:39:53] especially if it's something that they
[01:39:54] want to like sell to someone like I'm
[01:39:56] not going to buy something if I knew say
[01:39:57] it was like
[01:39:59] um like Java python or um something like
[01:40:03] that which is one of the ones I know
[01:40:04] more I could possibly do that but I
[01:40:06] don't know I was never big as a specific
[01:40:08] programmer I was a person that like
[01:40:10] fixed all the problems did a lot of java
[01:40:12] more python
[01:40:21] stuff oh no no no no no no no you
[01:40:26] don't oh yes I caught that thank

[01:41:03] be able to do I actually have some
[01:41:05] things that I was building with python
[01:41:06] and I know that enough to do stuff I
[01:41:08] just don't know I don't react enough to
[01:41:10] be able to say oh I'll pick this I'll

[01:48:14] regular uh you know colored sleeve you
[01:48:16] know that's all you really need to
[01:48:18] do and as long as you're gentle with
[01:48:20] your cards and you're not ruining them
[01:48:22] there's nothing ever going to happen to
[01:48:23] him you're not going to Dent any Corners
[01:48:25] you're not going to bend anything as
[01:48:26] long as you are not destructive with
[01:48:28] your [ __ ] now if this is a person that
[01:48:30] can't control himself and he spills like
[01:48:32] drops food on himself every single day
[01:48:34] and Spills stuff all over the place I
[01:48:36] kind of see what he's the reason for it
[01:48:38] but yeah I don't
[01:48:41] know yeah you won't bend the
[01:48:44] cards
[01:48:46] exactly like are you going to really be
[01:48:48] bending cards when you're when you're
[01:48:49] shuffling or anything like that like no
[01:48:51] they're just GNA be sitting like
[01:48:54] anyways
[01:48:57] anyways silliness
[01:49:01] sometimes no I'm not making fun of you
[01:49:05] do you do something weird you do
[01:49:07] something interesting H you're the
[01:49:08] person that spills everything all over
[01:49:10] yourself soon as you drink something
[01:49:12] it's going down your shirt you're
[01:49:13] dribbling it down your shirt like you
[01:49:14] got a hole in your mouth so I know I do
[01:49:21] that oh yeah yeah everybody did
[01:49:23] everybody raw it rawed them back in the
[01:49:25] day I can't believe they they blame they
[01:49:28] muted that that's funny it's going to be
[01:49:30] the raw dog that you said yeah we uh
[01:49:32] back in the day everybody did you didn't
[01:49:34] have sleeves all my um I have my um
[01:49:36] cards they're not here they're in my
[01:49:37] storage location but all my cards from
[01:49:39] back when I was younger I still have
[01:49:40] them and they're all in a um they all I
[01:49:44] have them in sleeves now but you can see
[01:49:45] the corners of them just because they
[01:49:46] were all shuffled from being uh being
[01:49:50] played with
[01:49:51] like yeah
[01:49:58] yeah exactly unless you fail at
[01:49:59] shuffling i' you should not be bending
[01:50:01] cards well see some people maybe drop
[01:50:02] them and step on them or something I
[01:50:03] don't
[01:50:04] know maybe maybe there's there're
[01:50:06] slightly slow you know slightly like
[01:50:08] slow where they just like oh no and then
[01:50:11] they step on their cards I don't knowbe
[01:50:13] who knows what they
[01:50:21] are oh see that that's the thing all
[01:50:23] right so all right I'll give you that
[01:50:24] one bending them when they try to
[01:50:26] shuffle them together I will say I agree
[01:50:28] there see now one of the things that I
[01:50:30] picked up like even like you can't push
[01:50:32] them together you have to leave them
[01:50:34] loose so that they Shuffle and that's
[01:50:36] one of the things that people I think
[01:50:38] forget is that you can't do them like
[01:50:40] you can't like your hand it's not
[01:50:41] supposed to hold them hard and you're
[01:50:43] stuffing them in together this is loose
[01:50:45] you want you want it Loose this isn't
[01:50:46] the scenario want it tight all right yes
[01:50:50] let them fall into each other so here's
[01:50:51] a little tip on shuffling for all you
[01:50:53] people out there that are watching right
[01:50:54] now here when you shuffle your magic
[01:50:57] cards here let's pretend this is a 100
[01:50:58] card deck right here
[01:51:01] okay wait let's put them in the right
[01:51:03] order so they're not back to back there
[01:51:05] oh that was just a um that was just a
[01:51:08] token that's why when you Shuffle you
[01:51:09] have your cards like so okay you take
[01:51:12] maybe half whatever your hand can hold
[01:51:14] and with stand and maybe you can't hold
[01:51:16] all 100 because your hand is small
[01:51:18] that's fine take half of them but see
[01:51:20] how gently I put them in here I am
[01:51:22] literally letting them fall in between
[01:51:25] the Cards yes there's a chunk that fell
[01:51:27] in the middle but I'm going to shuffle
[01:51:28] them again because that chunk doesn't
[01:51:29] really matter see you can even pull that
[01:51:32] chunk out if you're worried about it put
[01:51:34] it to a different side and be very
[01:51:37] gentle here's some tips if you're going
[01:51:39] to shuffle them this way see how they go
[01:51:40] together you let them drop I'm not
[01:51:43] pushing I'm letting them drop into
[01:51:45] them yes I
[01:51:48] have let them Cascade yeah you kind of
[01:51:51] let them Cascade and each other kind of
[01:51:54] let them Cascade into each other see how
[01:51:55] they're like not being pushed I'm like
[01:51:56] literally letting them drop in nothing's
[01:51:59] being pushed they're dropping in and
[01:52:01] there we
[01:52:04] go I have seen how you Shuffle
[01:52:09] yeah yeah you push them together a
[01:52:11] little bit you can't like you have to
[01:52:13] put you have a little bit of push on
[01:52:14] them to get them to go through that's
[01:52:16] that's definite yeah but you can't like
[01:52:18] you're not stuffing them in like I've
[01:52:19] seen some people too i' like oh my God

[02:05:27] break so not too bad there let's see
[02:05:30] what we can get going this
[02:05:33] morning what I'm going to do I'm going
[02:05:35] to start doing some other things too
[02:05:36] here I got to sleeve up some other stuff
[02:05:38] I'm going to start doing that to um get
[02:05:40] it all going might as well while we're
[02:05:42] waiting
[02:05:43] right my box of uh Commander Masters did
[02:05:46] junk for me very upset about my
[02:05:49] commander Master's uh draft pulled out a
[02:05:52] fing R goddamn Jewel Lotus out of the
[02:05:55] last box for you guys and I can't even
[02:05:57] get anything at all out of mine I got
[02:05:59] like all junk out of the entire thing I
[02:06:01] think I got 30 $40 worth of cards at the
[02:06:03] most I was like you g to be [ __ ] me
[02:06:05] out of that
[02:06:06] box I was quite upset I will say
[02:06:10] that but we'll
[02:06:12] see I mean some of the other some of the
[02:06:15] the rares and the I mean Commons and
[02:06:17] stuff like that I mean they're all
[02:06:18] playworthy
[02:06:19] cards that's the nice thing about it
[02:06:21] they all play with him it's
[02:06:25] just that's
[02:06:28] all you know slic and
[02:06:33] dice like path to Exile is a nice little
[02:06:40] pickup haunted
[02:06:46] cloak oh wow the only thing you got was
[02:06:48] showcase tiny bones see that's what
[02:06:50] sucks sometimes you like buy things and
[02:06:52] you're like oh my God that's all I get
[02:06:53] out of there is this
[02:06:57] unbelievable see that's what I mean like
[02:06:59] if you're going to get a box that's
[02:07:01] where I feel like they uh they need to
[02:07:03] ensure that you get at least close to
[02:07:05] your value back because when you get
[02:07:07] your at if you don't and you don't at
[02:07:09] all that's the thing that's really
[02:07:11] frustrating like at least give it to you
[02:07:13] get you don't need to have it back every
[02:07:15] time but at least close to it I know
[02:07:17] they can't take see where cards are
[02:07:19] going to go up or down but but they can
[02:07:22] know where CSS are going to what kind of
[02:07:25] like for the most part what cards are
[02:07:26] going to be popular ones or expensive
[02:07:28] ones just based on like the Rarity of
[02:07:33] them yeah exactly kind of the initial
[02:07:35] thought behind the box Hopper so that
[02:07:37] way you at least get something nice and
[02:07:39] that's why I'm like when they stop doing
[02:07:40] box hoers I'm like that's so stupid at
[02:07:42] least you have like a good thing that
[02:07:44] you come in with a Box offer if you buy
[02:07:46] a whole box and that's frustrating to me
[02:07:48] they definitely should get those back
[02:07:50] because that's one of those things like
[02:07:50] you guarantee yourself something like
[02:07:53] that you're going to want or at least
[02:07:54] something
[02:07:58] nice oh no I don't buy magic to make any
[02:08:01] money I mean either yeah if you're gonna
[02:08:02] buy magic it is not to make
[02:08:05] money Tatiana Bene Druid for our friend
[02:08:09] I'm butchering this
[02:08:12] name
[02:08:14] votic oh that's an voltic that's an l
[02:08:18] volck
[02:08:25] you got a t you B Druid not a big hit
[02:08:28] but hey because your discount on
[02:08:29] shipping and can you give me a number
[02:08:30] between one and 10 yeah see I'm not
[02:08:32] there for like like I said I don't care
[02:08:33] if you don't get your money back but at
[02:08:34] least don't get like $10 when you spend
[02:08:36] 150 for what you
[02:08:38] got all right I need number between one
[02:08:40] and 10 but playability yes as long as
[02:08:42] it's very good and playable and we get a
[02:08:44] lot of playable cards and I'm good but
[02:08:46] like like I said the draft I'm I'm like
[02:08:47] it sucks I didn't get my value but all
[02:08:49] the cards are playable right so
[02:08:53] I I complain but I don't at the same
[02:08:55] time if that makes any sense all right
[02:08:58] uh YouTube land some in the YouTube land
[02:08:59] give me a number between one and 10
[02:09:01] please that way we can uh see what our
[02:09:04] next giveaway will end up being going
[02:09:05] out
[02:09:08] there I said YouTube land holding
[02:09:11] mcroy are you in the YouTube
[02:09:14] land Skyline despit
[02:09:19] [Laughter]
[02:09:21] that's okay I'm just giving you a hard
[02:09:23] time I'm just giving you a hard
[02:09:30] time because we do have few people
[02:09:33] watching there so I like to give them a
[02:09:34] chance to uh respond and the number if
[02:09:38] they
[02:09:39] want if not that's okay I'll take your
[02:09:42] number nine here in a
[02:09:44] second number eight I mean
[02:09:52] oh yeah there's some good cards that
[02:09:54] they have for some dual lands it's just
[02:09:56] yeah it's hard to come across them
[02:10:00] all you're on YouTube and spirit there
[02:10:02] you go we're going uh with number nine
[02:10:04] with the YouTube Spirit one two three
[02:10:07] four five six seven eight nine we're
[02:10:09] going with number nine with the YouTube
[02:10:14] Spirit there we go I'll be put the
[02:10:17] giveaway cards right over there that way
[02:10:19] they're kind of like in view I don't
[02:10:20] need to worry about having them all the
[02:10:22] time all right here we go kadama reach
[02:10:25] we have seven spots available in the
[02:10:27] break here come on let's get through
[02:10:28] this thing I think we can do this today
[02:10:30] what do you all
[02:10:33] think uh they're not in the US or they
[02:10:36] aren't old enough to jump in sometimes
[02:10:38] there's some younger kids that watch it
[02:10:40] um and hang out I know or like um they
[02:10:44] don't plan on getting any of the
[02:10:45] giveaways and they just want to watch
[02:10:47] the um the breaks like a lot of people
[02:10:49] just go and watch breaks just to see
[02:10:51] rips yep yep exactly they going because
[02:10:54] they don't care about anything else and
[02:10:55] they're from like maybe like there's a
[02:10:57] there's a there's a kid uh from Denmark
[02:10:59] that's like a I know 14 or something
[02:11:01] that comes in and hangs out with us ill
[02:11:04] in uh on YouTube where he comes and
[02:11:06] watch us do our breaks because he likes
[02:11:07] Magik card you know so we like to hang
[02:11:10] out with people around the world see the
[02:11:11] cool thing is my thought process is I
[02:11:13] meet those people from around the world
[02:11:15] at some point I might actually be able
[02:11:16] to meet you guys in person because we
[02:11:18] plan on traveling with the boat there
[02:11:20] and if we're going going into uh
[02:11:22] different places like say for instance
[02:11:23] if you're in the Caribbean and you don't
[02:11:24] have a lot of people to play magic with
[02:11:26] well who knows maybe I'll be there for a
[02:11:27] month or so while we're hanging out at
[02:11:29] one of the islands we can play some
[02:11:31] games so that's kind of what I was
[02:11:33] talking about like uh that's why I think
[02:11:34] it's
[02:11:35] cool what I like like getting everybody
[02:11:38] on on YouTube hanging out like
[02:11:40] that so if you ever would like to do
[02:11:42] anything like that let me know like when
[02:11:44] I start hopefully in a few years it'll
[02:11:45] be like I'm guessing like four to seven
[02:11:47] years is when we'll start going to the
[02:11:48] other side of the world but maybe you're
[02:11:50] on some like is in another part of the
[02:11:52] world and you wanted to play but you
[02:11:53] only have one deck and a friend that
[02:11:54] never plays with you you know type
[02:11:58] thing and that's too it makes you better
[02:12:01] deck builder now that you kind of know
[02:12:02] all the cards that's another thing
[02:12:07] too where are you
[02:12:10] franie I can't remember where you were
[02:12:18] again I I I don't remember everybody's
[02:12:20] address off top of my head so sorry
[02:12:23] about that but if I can get you in a
[02:12:25] boat we can do
[02:12:26] that I think you were on the East Coast
[02:12:28] here somewhere but we do plan on going
[02:12:30] up and down the East Coast because we do
[02:12:31] have friends up in Maine so we do want
[02:12:33] to end up going up to Maine at some
[02:12:35] point and doing some of the stuff up
[02:12:36] there with our friends maybe even go up
[02:12:38] to Canada like Nova Scotia and stuff
[02:12:39] like that because my my dad bought his
[02:12:41] fishing boat up in Nova Scotia so that
[02:12:44] would be kind of something cool to go up
[02:12:45] there and like revisit my past and stuff
[02:12:47] like that I don't know
[02:12:51] that's just me cuz I'm weird and I like
[02:12:53] doing odd
[02:12:54] things see I'd like to go see what I
[02:12:56] eventually want to have I eventually
[02:12:58] want to have a
[02:13:00] aluminum catamaran that I can take to um
[02:13:04] arctic areas um because I would love to
[02:13:07] go to the Arctic and see some of that
[02:13:11] stuff um and go up to the North Pole
[02:13:13] type area and do that type of things um
[02:13:16] but I uh in the catamarans that we are
[02:13:19] looking at now those are more like warm
[02:13:20] water ones because they're all made with
[02:13:22] um fiberglass so I'm hoping in um the
[02:13:25] distant future we can get one made with
[02:13:28] aluminum you're Missouri all right well
[02:13:31] I think we can get to some parts of it
[02:13:33] through the uh River
[02:13:35] there depending on what size we have for
[02:13:37] a boat our friend Matt coming in with
[02:13:40] our giveaway win got a burine line the
[02:13:43] moon cracken
[02:13:52] I don't plan on doing the Great Loop
[02:13:53] anytime soon
[02:13:56] though yeah yep up the Old Miss that's
[02:13:59] why I thought we could get there
[02:14:00] somewhere I just don't know exactly
[02:14:01] where you are obviously but hey we do my
[02:14:04] wife actually does want to do it's
[02:14:06] called the Great Loop so if we have a
[02:14:07] boat that can do it she actually does
[02:14:09] want to do that that's where you go up
[02:14:11] to the you know Lakes then you go back
[02:14:13] out to the uh ocean and stuff like
[02:14:16] that Mori river runs through your town
[02:14:19] nice
[02:14:22] interesting Uncle you know what well
[02:14:23] like I said my wife wants to do the
[02:14:25] Great Loop so that is going through um I
[02:14:29] think that's going up the
[02:14:31] um I think that is going up the um
[02:14:35] Mississippi and I think it goes
[02:14:38] Mississippi somewhere into the great
[02:14:40] lakes and then you get back out into the
[02:14:41] Atlantic I can't remember exactly where
[02:14:43] but
[02:14:45] yeah that's one of the ones she wants to
[02:14:46] do but we have to have a boat that's uh
[02:14:48] the right size couple of the ones that
[02:14:49] we're looking at right now would be
[02:14:50] though so maybe we can do that in the
[02:14:52] first couple of years of uh hanging out
[02:14:54] and that way we can meet some of you
[02:14:55] guys in the middle of the middle of the
[02:14:57] country do some do some
[02:14:59] games that'd be pretty fun actually I
[02:15:01] think actually I not a bad idea do the
[02:15:04] Great Loop and do
[02:15:07] that now remember everybody we do have
[02:15:09] our break here you know what let's try
[02:15:11] this we're going to do this here we're
[02:15:14] going to do a couple of these this is
[02:15:16] what I'm going to do right now I'm gonna
[02:15:17] do this for a minute no no
[02:15:24] we're going to do a discount I'm going
[02:15:26] to put an alarm
[02:15:29] on going put an alarm
[02:15:34] on it is
[02:15:39] nine I'm going to go to
[02:15:47] nine 9:30 this is going to go to
[02:15:51] can't do it this way so I'm going to do
[02:15:52] it this way 9:30 with an alarm we're
[02:15:56] going to have our budger friendly chaos
[02:15:58] break
[02:16:00] discounted there we go we're going to
[02:16:02] discount it for a little bit for about
[02:16:04] 15 minutes or so 20 10
[02:16:06] minutes
[02:16:08] really St Louis is that not that far
[02:16:10] that's not too bad well that's what I
[02:16:12] was saying like um I'll do something and
[02:16:14] I was thinking what I would do at some
[02:16:15] point if we um is like if we can say hey
[02:16:18] there's a game store in the area I want
[02:16:20] to spawn sponsor a a game where we have
[02:16:23] um like you know the uh the you know the
[02:16:26] winner gets whatever I sponsor type
[02:16:28] thing I was wondering if I if some of
[02:16:30] the stores would be interested in doing
[02:16:31] that you know have a a group of people
[02:16:33] that hang out here and they that way
[02:16:35] they get some new business of people
[02:16:36] that come in from that may have been
[02:16:39] watching me and com to the store and
[02:16:40] then also um they could have people see
[02:16:42] the store on some of the streams and
[02:16:44] stuff like that and I don't know I
[02:16:46] thought it might be interesting to do
[02:16:47] for some of those stores because I don't
[02:16:49] do anything specifically with stores
[02:16:51] because I don't have my own store I
[02:16:52] don't you know I figured it might be a
[02:16:54] good
[02:16:54] idea as I travel around so like I'm
[02:16:57] going to be in a certain area for a time
[02:16:58] frame call a store and be hey I'd like
[02:17:00] to um talk to you guys about you know
[02:17:02] doing something where we I sponsor one
[02:17:05] of your sponsor an event you
[02:17:09] know so giveaways will be sponsored by
[02:17:12] me I mean the end of the stream the end
[02:17:14] of the um you know the match the winner
[02:17:16] and then maybe there'll be some
[02:17:17] giveaways during it type thing
[02:17:22] I know what do you think on that is that
[02:17:28] silly all right four people say I should

[02:37:42] the big ones for some reason what am I
[02:37:45] thinking of what am I thinking of then
[02:37:57] what am I thinking of
[02:37:59] them well Balon is $10 anyway so that's
[02:38:02] a nice little pickup I just couldn't
[02:38:05] remember what is the what is circle I
[02:38:07] thought Circle was worth something for
[02:38:09] some reason I guess I was wrong but
[02:38:11] Balon that's the nice one with the art
[02:38:13] there going to put blood sucker in the
[02:38:15] top loader also just in case
[02:38:23] I was wrong on the card there I thought
[02:38:24] that one was a nice one can't remember
[02:38:26] which one I guess I was wrong on that
[02:38:28] that's all right still a nice play play
[02:38:30] Mythic there spells cost one less for
[02:38:32] each Knight you control creatures you
[02:38:34] control get plus one plus one whenever
[02:38:36] you cast a legendary spell create a one
[02:38:39] a two two white knight creature
[02:38:43] token with vigilance I mean that's a
[02:38:46] good card I don't know why that's not
[02:38:48] higher

[02:38:52] next
[02:38:56] one ah as go in the bistic
[02:38:59] nice I thought for some Reon reason
[02:39:02] Circle was a big hit I don't know why
[02:39:04] maybe it was a different a different set
[02:39:06] that there was one that was like that in

[02:54:12] me welcome everybody come in and hang
[02:54:14] out
[02:54:18] I don't
[02:54:19] know because the only reason I know it
[02:54:22] is because they are um it keep saying
[02:54:25] like provide the code and this must be
[02:54:27] like an old account that I don't even
[02:54:28] use anymore because uh the ones that I
[02:54:31] have I always change the passwords if
[02:54:32] anything like that happens so they can't
[02:54:34] get into that area where they type the
[02:54:35] password in and it says like use the
[02:54:37] number or
[02:54:39] whatever my ex
[02:54:42] boss you know what he's probably the one
[02:54:44] that comes in and says you're gay or
[02:54:46] stuff like that it's probably that one
[02:54:48] that's probably him if he's doing
[02:54:49] anything at all you know it's one of
[02:54:52] those situations where you know if if
[02:54:53] you're in someone's mind every now and
[02:54:55] again you're in their mind for a long
[02:54:56] time just because they're just a piece
[02:54:57] of [ __ ] person and no matter what you're
[02:54:59] G to be in their mind because they know
[02:55:00] they're a piece of [ __ ] and you just
[02:55:02] just didn't care about them you told
[02:55:03] them to go [ __ ] themselves pretty much
[02:55:05] and left the company not many people do
[02:55:07] that when they make six figures tell
[02:55:10] someone to go piss off and
[02:55:12] leave after they do something that I
[02:55:14] would consider thoroughly inappropriate
[02:55:15] by looking into someone's personal life
[02:55:17] to report to to report to HR where HR
[02:55:20] says there's nothing wrong with what you
[02:55:21] do that's your personal life we don't
[02:55:22] care about your time your personal time
[02:55:24] you can do whatever you want in your own
[02:55:25] time just as you're on company time you
[02:55:27] need to be working I'm like I am I'm on
[02:55:29] company time working you can look and
[02:55:30] like yeah we don't care like I don't
[02:55:32] even know why this was called in the
[02:55:33] person said and I made a comment about
[02:55:35] it to a a director about I had
[02:55:37] retaliation stuff and they said they
[02:55:39] weren't doing anything about it so I was
[02:55:40] like all right go piss off [ __ ] if
[02:55:43] you can retaliate against
[02:55:45] me and nothing's going to be done about
[02:55:48] it
[02:55:49] I will leave very nice people in certain
[02:55:51] things but that pissed me off a lot that
[02:55:54] showed zero
[02:55:55] Integrity to me at
[02:55:58] least but that's what happens and at
[02:56:00] least luckily I had this and we had some
[02:56:02] other plans that we were doing so I had
[02:56:04] kind of get this rolling a little bit

[02:59:33] every holiday I had to work though
[02:59:35] because uh other other countries weren't
[02:59:37] closed when the US
[02:59:41] was are they itching that bad from like
[02:59:44] allergies or something Matt cuz I've had
[02:59:46] that happen before where I'm like oh my
[02:59:47] God my eyes are itching can I just tear
[02:59:49] him out of my head heartless
[02:59:55] act loyal
[02:59:59] unicorn ners night blade these are my
[03:00:02] our commander Masters pack draft packs
[03:00:04] that we opened earlier ministering of
[03:00:07] obligation ah yep those those are no fun
[03:00:10] that's itchy loal
[03:00:15] giant Lo while giant win caller
[03:00:22] aan oh I hate trainings I hated training
[03:00:25] stuff half the time the training stuff
[03:00:27] was like so stupid like make sure you
[03:00:29] feel for this I'm like are you re are
[03:00:30] you instantly stupid are you the dumbest
[03:00:32] person on the planet because if you're
[03:00:34] not you can get through most of that
[03:00:35] stuff without training and that I think
[03:00:37] that's the problem is it's making people
[03:00:39] like if you're that slow that you need
[03:00:41] certain trainings you probably shouldn't
[03:00:42] even be working at that
[03:00:44] job like if they need to treat you train
[03:00:47] you to be a people person why the hell
[03:00:49] are you at a job for people in front of

[03:03:18] oh yeah yeah they come out later but I'd
[03:03:19] still like to get some of them myself
[03:03:21] but it sucks that I can never get them
[03:03:23] other than like
[03:03:24] um I think I can only get him on
[03:03:28] Amazon I would like to get him through
[03:03:30] the distributor but I have to talk to
[03:03:32] him maybe I'll reach out and
[03:03:34] ask why I haven't had the option of
[03:03:36] getting
[03:03:38] them jungle
[03:03:40] Dave can I get a number between one and
[03:03:43] 10 my friend jungle Dave
[03:03:51] no all right how
[03:03:58] about stop eating corn the long way can
[03:04:01] I get a can I get a number between one
[03:04:03] and
[03:04:04] 10 four
[03:04:08] five and see what we get
[03:04:14] here all righty
[03:04:21] anybody between one and
[03:04:23] 10 seven from snarf one two three four
[03:04:27] five six and seven from snarf thank you
[03:04:30] my friend
[03:04:31] snarf all right we have five spots left
[03:04:34] in our break here so we're going to go
[03:04:36] for a little while longer and if I
[03:04:37] happen to not be able to finish it this
[03:04:38] is what I'm going to give people for
[03:04:39] options you're going to get the option
[03:04:41] of we'll try we can I finish this start
[03:04:43] it again tomorrow morning or where you
[03:04:46] can refund or
[03:04:48] we can give you a you know car packs re
[03:04:51] uh equivalent to the
[03:04:53] cost um or since there's five we can
[03:04:57] break this down and do a mini break
[03:04:58] between the five people instead so those
[03:05:01] are the options that I kind of give out
[03:05:02] to everyone um when we get to the lower
[03:05:05] end of it so what I'll end up doing is
[03:05:07] maybe instead of two packs of each thing
[03:05:09] it'll be like one pack of each thing
[03:05:10] type thing to break it down so let me
[03:05:13] know um what you guys want to do here
[03:05:16] because I think in if I don't get this
[03:05:17] in the next half hour we don't get a
[03:05:20] close down I think that's what I'll end
[03:05:21] up probably
[03:05:22] doing doing the break like
[03:05:27] that what do you think we can do a half
[03:05:30] half of it that way uh you can still get
[03:05:33] the secret layer stuff let's try that
[03:05:35] let me see Let's
[03:05:39] do let's see
[03:06:03] yeah I think we could do
[03:06:05] that I think we could probably do
[03:06:10] that I think that's probably what we'll
[03:06:12] end up doing in the next half hour if we
[03:06:14] don't end up getting it closed out what
[03:06:16] I'll end up doing if that's okay with
[03:06:17] every body in the break what we'll do is
[03:06:18] we're going to do this we'll be
[03:06:20] one
[03:06:23] one
[03:06:26] one
[03:06:29] one
[03:06:38] [Music]
[03:06:39] one there now you're going to have a
[03:06:42] choice
[03:06:44] between one of these which one of those
[03:06:47] you want we're going have choice between
[03:06:49] those because the secret layer to go in
[03:06:51] with
[03:07:06] it yeah so we'll have to get either drop
[03:07:09] out the secret layer or the modern
[03:07:12] Horizon pack so if we're going to do the
[03:07:15] five and F the five one so we'll have to
[03:07:18] decide what you guys want to do it'll be
[03:07:21] like it'll be
[03:07:25] these or
[03:07:27] these with your choice of one of these
[03:07:29] two in the middle here if we're going to
[03:07:31] do the five break
[03:07:32] instead but
[03:07:34] anyways been a while hey how's it going
[03:07:37] H bone nice to see you in here so yeah
[03:07:40] let me know what what you guys think
[03:07:42] there that's what we're going to end up
[03:07:43] doing I'm going to zoom out a little bit
[03:07:44] so people can see more of the screen so
[03:07:47] here we'll do this where it'll
[03:07:49] be left
[03:07:51] side which is going to be this stuff
[03:07:53] here on the left
[03:07:55] side all right or the right side which
[03:07:58] will
[03:08:00] be we'll do that on the right side
[03:08:03] actually that'll be our right side so I
[03:08:05] made the
[03:08:06] choices made the choices we'll do that
[03:08:09] if we can't get the break completely
[03:08:10] filled here somehow in the last 30
[03:08:12] minutes this will be at obviously as
[03:08:14] part of the break if we get it all
[03:08:15] completely filled but if not we're going
[03:08:16] only have five spot we'll split it

[03:09:04] see what else we get in
[03:09:08] here here we go put that there for our
[03:09:11] giveaways coming
[03:09:14] out oh I understand that weaker
[03:09:17] sometimes your luck is really good then
[03:09:18] luck is then the luck is not and you got
[03:09:20] to take a break for a little while I've
[03:09:22] been there before I'm like Oh my luck is
[03:09:23] awesome I keep going and I'm like hold
[03:09:25] on my luck is not awesome anymore I
[03:09:28] gotta take a break now but anyways like
[03:09:30] I said we're gonna get this whole break
[03:09:32] going by 10:30 if not we're going to do
[03:09:34] the half a
[03:09:36] break for the five of you guys that are
[03:09:38] in here I think that should be that's
[03:09:39] pretty
[03:09:41] fair think that's pretty
[03:09:43] fair
[03:09:46] right since has two of each we can break
[03:09:48] it in
[03:09:55] half okay sounds good sounds good I like
[03:10:03] that yeah at least people can get
[03:10:05] something exactly see what I like to do
[03:10:08] the reason why I the way I do breakes is
[03:10:09] a little different than other way people
[03:10:11] do them they do like color breaks or or
[03:10:12] or number digit breaks I like to do it
[03:10:14] where we literally we take all the
[03:10:16] mythics all the rare
[03:10:18] and any uncommon a common that's $3 or
[03:10:20] more we shuffle them up into in sleeves
[03:10:24] and then we hand them out to each person
[03:10:25] that brought in and the order they
[03:10:27] bought in and the reason for that is
[03:10:29] just you all get a rare Mythic or
[03:10:30] conomon worth that amount now for
[03:10:32] instance with the secret layer those
[03:10:33] will be shuffled in too but that's how
[03:10:35] we do that there and that's the reason
[03:10:36] why I do it that way is that way
[03:10:38] everybody gets something because I've
[03:10:39] been before where somebody got like one
[03:10:40] card and a digit break and another
[03:10:41] person got a bunch of them it's like oh
[03:10:43] God that just seems no fun
[03:10:47] make sure you do yes you can play some
[03:10:49] Magic or even some sorcery with
[03:10:51] us if you want to jump in on any of
[03:10:55] them all right so what we'll do now
[03:11:05] is let's make
[03:11:08] sure everything is available there
[03:11:18] dropped all these cards
[03:11:20] earlier they're just like tokens and
[03:11:22] stuff it just fell out of my my
[03:11:23] container that I
[03:11:26] have that I use to hold them silly of me
[03:11:29] let it fall silly me let it
[03:11:33] fall I wasn't paying
[03:11:40] attention okay that sounds good so this
[03:11:42] weekend we're going to play
[03:11:45] probably um well we'll play a game this
[03:11:47] weekend and it will end up being like um
[03:11:50] I'm thinking we're going to start doing
[03:11:51] more Saturdays on the weekends that way
[03:11:53] people have more time to play um because
[03:11:56] at the moment with the Sundays I was
[03:11:58] doing on Sundays because I was figuring
[03:11:59] like before football season starts we'll
[03:12:01] do a Sunday games and then when football
[03:12:04] season starts we'll change the time or
[03:12:05] something like that but
[03:12:08] um who knows now though I was thinking
[03:12:11] because people were like not able to
[03:12:12] play weed late and stuff so that makes a
[03:12:14] lot of sense so why don't we do like I
[03:12:16] was thinking maybe we do Saturdays or uh
[03:12:19] a Sunday or something like that that way
[03:12:21] we can um instead of instead of Sunday
[03:12:24] that way we can
[03:12:26] have more people involved and that if it
[03:12:29] goes later it's not a big Pro it's not
[03:12:30] as much
[03:12:33] problem say
[03:12:35] all oh hey Bob Theon are you okay with
[03:12:38] what I was talking about for doing um
[03:12:40] the 5050 split instead before you head
[03:12:43] out
[03:12:44] Bob I just want to be sure you're okay
[03:12:46] with what with doing
[03:12:49] that or or did you want the refund I'm
[03:12:52] guessing you're generally good with
[03:12:53] doing the 50-50 splits or the other
[03:12:55] things because I do take care of
[03:12:56] everyone I just wanted to be sure before
[03:12:59] I made it did
[03:13:02] anything see you
[03:13:04] Bob sorry I didn't get a chance to say I
[03:13:08] guess I guess I missed you there for
[03:13:09] that
[03:13:14] second all right everyone so we got
[03:13:18] about uh 15 more minutes left and let's
[03:13:20] see if we can get this break cleared out
[03:13:22] here we have five spots

[03:15:22] because I know I have them I just don't
[03:15:23] know what cards specifically the names
[03:15:24] of them are so I'd have to take a look

[03:16:15] go okay we have have um some all right
[03:16:19] anointed procession I do not have that
[03:16:21] nomad's assembly devout
[03:16:24] mandro oare talk oh I might have oare
[03:16:27] talk
[03:16:29] actually deepest Foundation I actually
[03:16:31] might have oare talk somewhere you're
[03:16:33] gonna have to give me a minute to find
[03:16:34] that
[03:16:36] one necro
[03:16:39] Duality OB nixus oh I have OB nixus
[03:16:42] somewhere I do have that too I'd have to
[03:16:45] take a look for OB nixus I'm pretty sure
[03:16:46] I got that one
[03:16:53] around
[03:16:56] yes um andless rest of the ranks
[03:17:01] marinar if you do
[03:17:04] rats gives you
[03:17:07] extras red doublers Kindred charge all
[03:17:10] right cranco mob boss I just pulled that
[03:17:12] out but that's um for go Goblin SP
[03:17:16] specifically
[03:17:23] yeah you want double plus one plus one
[03:17:25] is what I'm
[03:17:39] guessing uh Primal
[03:17:42] Vigor Primal Vigor is a good
[03:17:45] one Prim Primal Vigor if one or more
[03:17:48] tokens would be put onto the battlefield
[03:17:50] twice that many to these tokens are put
[03:17:52] onto the battlefield instead if one or
[03:17:54] more plus one plus1 counters would be
[03:17:56] put placed on a creature twice that many
[03:17:58] plus one plus1 counters are placed on
[03:18:00] that creature
[03:18:06] instead so Primal Vigor is a good one I
[03:18:09] actually might have a Primal
[03:18:13] Vigor somewhere I feel like I got Primal
[03:18:15] Vigor somewhere
[03:18:18] doubling season like we talked
[03:18:28] about Primal Vigor is a good one for you
[03:18:34] though yeah Primal Viger does it for
[03:18:36] everyone though Primal Viger does do
[03:18:39] that for everyone no it says if you I
[03:18:42] thought if one or more token we put on
[03:18:45] oh yeah it is for everyone Primal Viger
[03:18:47] that is true Primal Vigor is for
[03:18:48] everyone I forgot about that one W Wana
[03:18:52] there you go can I get a number between
[03:18:55] one and 10 my friend you got the
[03:18:57] Entourage of
[03:19:00] trest Entourage of trest my friend Wana
[03:19:05] actually I got you written down
[03:19:12] already Wann to be right there
[03:19:18] we go put that down there wannabe put
[03:19:21] you in a top loader because that's how
[03:19:23] you end up shipping
[03:19:25] out can I get a number between one and
[03:19:27] 10
[03:19:36] wannabe yeah that's why I said plus one
[03:19:38] plus one counter
[03:19:40] specifically number between one and 10
[03:19:43] from um anybody in the YouTube land
[03:19:49] what do you say someone in the YouTube
[03:19:50] land give me a number one and
[03:19:52] 10 and then I think we're gonna be doing
[03:19:55] the
[03:19:57] half oh inke Keeper's talent I forgot
[03:20:00] about inke Keeper's
[03:20:08] Talent forgot about inkeeper
[03:20:13] Talent that's a good one too
[03:20:17] at the beginning of your Combat on your
[03:20:18] turn put a plus one plus one counter on
[03:20:20] a Target creature you control permit you
[03:20:21] control with counters on them have Ward
[03:20:24] one if you would put one or more
[03:20:26] counters on a permanent or players put
[03:20:29] twice that many of each of those kinds
[03:20:31] of counters on that permanent or player
[03:20:33] instead that's a level
[03:20:36] three
[03:20:43] nice yeah the white God one the white
[03:20:45] God ones are probably the one of the
[03:20:47] better ones for you I'm guessing um yeah

[03:20:52] it the uh ohare talk is a good one for
[03:20:54] you so ohare takas vigilance if one or
[03:20:57] more creature tokens would be created

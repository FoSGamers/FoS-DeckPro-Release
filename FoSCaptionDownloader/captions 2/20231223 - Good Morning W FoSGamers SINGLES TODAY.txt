[00:35:11] showing you but my children have the
[00:35:14] most insane luck in the world I don't
[00:35:16] know how to explain it but they do
[00:35:20] ready William pulled me that out when we
[00:35:23] did Doctor

[00:36:37] tingle in the in like the top of his
[00:36:39] head the back of his head when he um
[00:36:43] feels a good path and about 75% of the
[00:36:47] time he pulls something out that's worth
[00:36:49] money not every time but about 75% of
[00:36:53] time it's like son of a [ __ ] this
[00:36:54] tingle might actually be something
[00:37:00] so I've started to go with the tingle

[00:37:03] must get a tingle too I do when I look

[01:30:09] let's have some fun or you know hey if
[01:30:10] you have a question I'll answer it you
[01:30:12] know I used to work um I used to work at
[01:30:15] Sprint managing a bunch of Sprint stores
[01:30:18] uh when they were around and I had one I
[01:30:22] had I ended up going from like not
[01:30:23] managing anything six months into it I
[01:30:26] managed one store two years later I was
[01:30:28] managing three stores and the reason was
[01:30:30] was I acted that same way and I'm gonna
[01:30:32] this is gonna sound weird but I feel
[01:30:34] like a lot of people like gravitate
[01:30:36] towards that depending on what you're
[01:30:38] doing because I had I used to have
[01:30:40] regular customers that would tell their
[01:30:41] friends and family and I would have
[01:30:43] regular customers on all the time coming
[01:30:45] in because they told their friends and
[01:30:46] family go this guy helped me this guy
[01:30:48] helped me and it wasn't he didn't push
[01:30:50] it he helped me and that's that's what
[01:30:52] it was you
[01:30:53] know all right here we go we did those
[01:30:56] for that we're going to go on and we're
[01:30:59] going to go to our you know what we're
[01:31:01] GNA stay with ion for a little bit here
[01:31:03] for a second here then we're going to do
[01:31:05] Exelon
[01:31:09] pullbox yes exactly so like I um the
[01:31:13] best example of that for me Yen hey iway
[01:31:15] thanks for coming in J joining my best
[01:31:18] example of Word of Mouth will would be
[01:31:22] um I had a death person come in to buy a
[01:31:26] phone um and the guy that help was going
[01:31:29] to help like dude I can't help I'm like
[01:31:31] let me take care of it and I helped the
[01:31:32] guy I took out a comp out a piece of
[01:31:34] paper writing down everything we for him
[01:31:36] with a piece of paper got everything
[01:31:38] figured out for him and um ended up
[01:31:42] typing stuff out and everything to make
[01:31:43] it a little easier so we could type um
[01:31:46] and by doing that so this is going to be
[01:31:49] the onscreen pack deal coming up here by
[01:31:51] the way just so you're aware by doing
[01:31:53] that um he ended up buying a phone but
[01:31:56] two days later another deaf person came
[01:31:57] in like oh that's interesting all right
[01:31:59] whatever maybe he told his buddy three
[01:32:02] days later another deaf person came in I
[01:32:05] [ __ ] you
[01:32:06] not in one month I sold 20 phones to
[01:32:10] death people and I made a comment to my
[01:32:14] my uh my manager and he goes oh yeah one
[01:32:17] of the guys I know is De he's like
[01:32:18] they're a tight Community you just
[01:32:19] pretty much did somebody ass solid that
[01:32:21] no one else would do you spent 45
[01:32:23] minutes writing out something that no
[01:32:25] one else would take the effort to do
[01:32:27] like oh I never thought of it that
[01:32:29] way and because of that I got 20 people
[01:32:32] coming in and on a regular basis they
[01:32:34] were coming in getting help getting
[01:32:36] stuff so that's my example of doing you
[01:32:40] know doing the right thing putting that
[01:32:41] little extra effort in so where do we
[01:32:43] want to go on the ixon box before we do

[01:38:07] know I you know I don't know that much
[01:38:08] about magic myself when it like as other
[01:38:12] people do like some people are extremely
[01:38:14] knowledgeable I know enough that I can
[01:38:16] be dangerous I call it if that makes
[01:38:18] sense like I know a lot of the newer
[01:38:20] things for the past year because that's
[01:38:22] when I jumped into it again recently um
[01:38:24] a lot but I know stuff from when I was
[01:38:26] younger because I played from 95 until
[01:38:28] like
[01:38:29] 2000 so I know some from like the newer
[01:38:33] stuff so like those cards I know some of
[01:38:35] those cards and some of them I didn't
[01:38:36] even know the prices of them I don't
[01:38:38] know the prices of cards like people
[01:38:39] know them on the top of their head easy
[01:38:41] I'm like I don't know the price of a
[01:38:42] card on the top of their head off the
[01:38:44] top of my head so I uh I have to look
[01:38:47] him up a lot of
[01:38:49] times that's why I write a the prices
[01:38:51] down like some of the people like oh
[01:38:52] this one's this this one's that I'm like
[01:38:53] I got to write the prices down on I
[01:38:54] don't understand how you guys
[01:38:57] know we're going to do a doctor who G
[01:39:01] try Doctor Who here doctor who normally
[01:39:04] it is a uh that would be going for I
[01:39:06] think that would be going for 18 we're
[01:39:08] going to drop it down a dollar because
[01:39:09] we get to do when we do multiple packs
[01:39:11] at a time multiple things at a time as
[01:39:13] always I get to do a
[01:39:16] discount might not
[01:39:18] get AJ how's it going just hanging out
[01:39:24] here
[01:39:26] sabotage we

[01:39:50] Yu-Gi-Oh was a kid but I've always lik
[01:39:52] strategy and Magic really underst how to
[01:39:53] get into it everything yeah see like I
[01:39:55] did um they we only had I was older so I
[01:39:58] I really only had magic when Pokemon
[01:40:00] came out I actually played Pokemon on um
[01:40:03] Nintendo uh Game Boy when Pokemon came
[01:40:06] out so like that's the
[01:40:08] uh that's how old I am like the original
[01:40:13] ones we're going to go
[01:40:16] with random random packs here if
[01:40:21] somebody wants these random packs just
[01:40:22] say
[01:40:24] it and also I can always do like I say
[01:40:28] if there's um packs that you see in the
[01:40:29] buy now just say hey combine these three
[01:40:32] packs or maybe it's not even packs maybe
[01:40:34] it's just pull box and packs combination
[01:40:37] of three things red and blue yeah red
[01:40:39] and blue I had those then the black and
[01:40:42] white uh well the black and white
[01:40:43] Nintendo there those are going to be our
[01:40:46] onscreen pack deals and that's going to

[01:41:06] for going to throw those on for 18 those
[01:41:10] packs on
[01:41:15] screen you want to try it oh yellow yeah
[01:41:19] that came out later that came out later
[01:41:21] yellow was a later one that came out I
[01:41:23] think I had red and green I mean red and
[01:41:26] blue when it first came out I mean it
[01:41:28] was hard to find too interestingly like
[01:41:29] it was like back then even we have
[01:41:31] modern
[01:41:32] Horizon draft Mars machine set and hunt

[01:41:42] $18 three packs on screen and I'm going
[01:41:45] to start doing sudden death here guys

[01:41:55] start changing this baby up to sudden
[01:42:01] death yeah it was yellow where I started

[01:52:13] little bit of luck with some things
[01:52:15] where I didn't die when I did a lot of
[01:52:16] stupid things and that's why I say I
[01:52:18] luck I got hurt and injured but I didn't
[01:52:21] die doing a lot of stupid things so I
[01:52:22] was lucky and then my children as soon
[01:52:25] as I had them I stopped having luck and
[01:52:27] I got injured all the time like what the
[01:52:29] hell I swear as soon as you have

[03:55:00] it plop coming in killing it with the
[03:55:03] card pulls out of
[03:55:05] those and I think I think the seven is
[03:55:07] still the big hit there
[03:55:10] I mean you got that is even possibly a
[03:55:11] $5 card too oh
[03:55:16] seven got
[03:55:20] six
[03:55:22] four three all right let's see it's
[03:55:25] seven and six was it a six
[03:55:28] after because if it's not got a six got
[03:55:32] a six oh I think the Suns box won
[03:55:35] because it's
[03:55:36] 766 and I think it goes 765 here seven
[03:55:41] six and then I think you only had a five
[03:55:44] next but if you have a six and you tie
[03:55:47] three ways down the buyer
[03:55:49] wins because I think the lowest one next
[03:55:51] one was a four oh the next one's a four
[03:55:54] so the Suns box did win there but H you
[03:55:57] definitely came out on top where do you

[04:32:55] giveaway then if we can get up to more s

[04:33:12] [Music]
[04:33:17] all right no one wanted Wills pack
[04:33:20] deal it's

[04:33:28] ones so we're going to do that we're
[04:33:31] going to do this we're going to

[04:33:54] want to try your luck nine Lord of the
[04:33:56] Rings for 14 normally that would be
[04:34:00] 15 yeah I didn't think it was a
[04:34:02] guaranteed shock but I thought it was a
[04:34:03] good chance of a shock land which is why
[04:34:06] the um Infinity box Toppers went for
[04:34:08] like 20 to $70 depending on which one
[04:34:10] you
[04:34:13] got
[04:34:17] oh so it's it's not the Galaxy so you
[04:34:19] might get a shockland it's just not an
[04:34:21] expensive
[04:34:25] one okay
[04:34:29] okay all right that makes
[04:34:34] sense
[04:34:37] [Music]
[04:34:43] yeah there's still of a g CH chance of a
[04:34:45] galaxy that's what it is all right so
[04:34:47] you get a you get the box Hopper that is
[04:34:49] a um shock land which is going to be a
[04:34:53] few bucks
[04:34:54] there but you can you could potentially
[04:34:57] get the other one that's what it
[04:35:02] is all right that's what that is no
[04:35:05] wanted to try their luck on the Lord of
[04:35:07] the Rings
[04:35:10] one so we're going to change
[04:35:12] that so you might get you might get like
[04:35:14] a $ five doll shockland or you could get
[04:35:16] the
[04:35:17] $100 Galaxy one is what we're saying

[05:46:10] Reaper quick study Garrick's Uprising
[05:46:14] and an emo Dan's py Hammer but hey hold

[05:46:51] 16 okay let me I have an idea we're
[05:46:55] gonna do this and a dragon mantle all
[05:46:59] right so since I don't have much left in
[05:47:03] the Exon in the Wilds of Al drain box
[05:47:06] and I think the last big card there may
[05:47:10] be one last big card in there I'm gonna
[05:47:12] take down the Wilds of Al drain box we
[05:47:15] don't have the Wilds of Val drain box
[05:47:17] anymore and what I'm gonna do is I'm
[05:47:19] just gonna give these away to you
[05:47:22] guys as we do shipments today I'm just
[05:47:26] going to give the rest of these away in
[05:47:27] shipments today to you all I'm going
[05:47:29] pick random ones and throw them in all
[05:47:32] right for all you that bought from me
[05:47:35] today kind of saying thank you we'll
[05:47:37] grab some random ones from that box and

[05:48:10] top card in that for that card in there
[05:48:12] unless somebody wants to try their luck
[05:48:14] on the last of them there's I think
[05:48:16] there's one top card left in that
[05:48:21] box but I'm not 100% saying that we had
[05:48:25] a bunch of them pulled out today so we
[05:48:27] may have it may it one one of them was
[05:48:29] pulled out earlier I do know that but we
[05:48:31] have it may be one of the top ones left

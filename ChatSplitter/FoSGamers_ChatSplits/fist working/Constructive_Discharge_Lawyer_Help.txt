### 1. Relevant Florida Law: Constructive Discharge and Harassment

In Florida, the concept you're describing is often related to what's known as "constructive discharge." Constructive discharge occurs when an employee resigns because their work environment has become so intolerable due to harassment or other negative actions by the employer that any reasonable person in their position would feel forced to quit.

While there isn't a specific Florida statute explicitly labeled "constructive discharge," it is recognized under employment law and can be used in conjunction with other claims, such as:

- **Harassment (under Florida Civil Rights Act - FCRA):** The FCRA makes it illegal for employers to discriminate or harass employees based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, handicap, or marital status. If the harassment is severe or pervasive enough to create a hostile work environment, it can contribute to a constructive discharge claim.

- **Retaliation:** If the harassment is in retaliation for reporting discrimination or other protected activities, this can further bolster a constructive discharge claim.

- **Federal Law (Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964):** In some cases, federal laws such as Title VII may also apply, especially in cases involving discrimination or harassment based on protected characteristics.

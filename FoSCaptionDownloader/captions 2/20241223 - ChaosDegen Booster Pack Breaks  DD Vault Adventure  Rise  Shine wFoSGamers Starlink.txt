[00:04:18] right now we're on our uh boat here you
[00:04:21] can't see the wobbling here I was hoping
[00:04:23] we could get a sunrise to go but I guess
[00:04:25] not guess it won't happen today
[00:04:29] guess not today we'll try it anyways
[00:04:32] though so but we are going via starlink
[00:04:34] right now for all you people hanging out
[00:04:37] with
[00:04:37] us it was kind of cool so we have the
[00:04:41] the other one though zamone is this plus
[00:04:43] some d uh dmu packs thought we got to
[00:04:46] try that one out today and then we have
[00:04:49] made some added things for our adventure
[00:04:51] games so Nolan felt we
[00:04:55] needed um some something else those five
[00:04:58] thank you so it's going to be these five
[00:05:00] and then what I need also from you then
[00:05:02] now hold
[00:05:03] on is I'm going to
[00:05:06] need um hold on hold on William hold on
[00:05:11] I'm I'm just eating my breakfast oh I
[00:05:13] you you having breakfast I don't you
[00:05:14] didn't I thought you just sitting there
[00:05:15] watching no don't get up next time I'll
[00:05:16] deal with it after you didn't need to do
[00:05:18] it right away oh I'm sorry it uh the
[00:05:22] rest were uh duskborn packs in this so
[00:05:26] we're going to have duskborn or Overlord
[00:05:28] of hunt Woods so we'll have six of those
[00:05:30] coming out here we'll have will and
[00:05:32] Nolan pick three each hope you guys are
[00:05:34] having a good morning though hope you're
[00:05:35] having fun listening in hearing me
[00:05:37] having some fun here and what we'll do
[00:05:39] though is we do have some our own
[00:05:42] packs that we were
[00:05:44] thinking put off to the side ourselves
[00:05:47] we can open some and see if we get any
[00:05:49] luck and I forget where I put all of
[00:05:51] mine I know I had a chunk of them that
[00:05:53] were split out so we're going to just
[00:05:56] see what happens when we open these cuz
[00:05:57] I had a whole box of this left over that
[00:05:59] we never actually
[00:06:01] finished going through so I'm going to
[00:06:04] try and open some of these and see if we
[00:06:06] have any of them cuz I know I had uh
[00:06:07] half a box left for me and they ended up
[00:06:10] getting mixed in with everyone so that
[00:06:13] means that out of that half a box
[00:06:14] there's going to end up being the half
[00:06:17] box the box and a half of stuff in here
[00:06:18] there's going to end up being two foil
[00:06:20] cards so yeah most likely two foil cards
[00:06:24] we'll say that's what we'll say most
[00:06:26] likely two but yeah we're just hanging
[00:06:28] out having some fun
[00:06:30] not doing anything ridiculous today cuz
[00:06:33] uh that's what we are we don't we can't
[00:06:35] do that anymore in the boat yet we have
[00:06:37] to we do not have all of our stuff
[00:06:39] here so by not having all of our stuff
[00:06:41] here it makes it a little bit harder for
[00:06:44] uh for us to uh do everything we
[00:06:47] normally
[00:06:55] do but let's do this right now and see
[00:06:58] what we get out of this pack oh you love

[01:06:00] his name's new
[01:06:02] guy his name is new guy that's what noan
[01:06:11] says going try that there yeah then
[01:06:14] we're going to put out Will's
[01:06:17] design oh my that's big
[01:06:35] there we go trying to make that uh so we
[01:06:38] can see it here and make my screen a
[01:06:40] little bit bigger so I can see it so I
[01:06:42] might I'm not seeing you in chat at the
[01:06:43] moment because I do not have dose
[01:06:45] Windows oh my what is that what could
[01:06:48] that
[01:06:50] be what could that be that's another
[01:06:52] reason why I asked um I've been asking
[01:06:54] whatnot if they can
[01:06:56] um get some allow us to put it into OBS
[01:07:00] with everything that way I have it all
[01:07:01] in one location I can see everybody's
[01:07:03] chat there that' be really really nice
[01:07:05] because it doesn't allow you to do the
[01:07:06] chat through there you have to do the
[01:07:07] chat their way it just makes it a little
[01:07:09] bit harder cuz you have to have like
[01:07:11] multiple windows open where I could just
[01:07:12] only have the one with OBS if I had it
[01:07:15] set out that way but hey it happens you
[01:07:17] got to do what you get to
[01:07:19] do got you do what you got to
[01:07:24] do a new friend to meet in the balls yes
[01:07:26] I know a new
[01:07:29] friend all kinds of breaks let's do um
[01:07:34] this one here I put this one in has a $2
[01:07:37] Iron Man one so let's do that for us
[01:07:40] we'll run that at $2 there for a little
[01:07:41] bit potential of Iron Man or some
[01:07:43] singles while we're hanging out here
[01:07:45] we're adding in some of our
[01:07:47] uh input
[01:07:51] sources feel like I had more of them I
[01:07:53] had more more new ones
[01:07:58] that was that one yep all right that was
[01:07:59] that
[01:08:01] one oh okay there we go that was that
[01:08:06] one
[01:08:10] aha do
[01:08:23] that soon is it
[01:08:28] [Music]
[01:08:30] I know so I said that I don't understand
[01:08:37] why is it on auto I put it on auto so
[01:08:40] change it to just m making it go that
[01:08:42] might be the reason why mode to cool
[01:08:45] yeah instead of
[01:08:48] Auto that might have been why I got warm
[01:08:50] then last night I I mean I was terrible
[01:08:53] I was okay last night I that's why I put
[01:08:54] on auto SLE in like yeah I know what you
[01:08:57] slept
[01:09:02] in oh there's the third floor oh my
[01:09:07] there's our third floor oh yes getting a
[01:09:11] different oh there goes somebody
[01:09:13] leaving someone's leaving with their
[01:09:15] boat going to wherever they're going to
[01:09:17] go probably going to get fuel right now
[01:09:18] is my
[01:09:19] guess uh the boat maneuver is harder
[01:09:22] it's harder to maneuver with the two
[01:09:24] props by the way so you we all have to
[01:09:26] get used to the two prop ones it takes a
[01:09:27] little bit more oomph to get it to do
[01:09:30] what we need which is why I was having a
[01:09:31] harder time over there getting used to
[01:09:32] it I was I was I had to give more
[01:09:35] throttle for to go I have to have on
[01:09:37] higher RPM the low RPM is not going to
[01:09:40] kick enough we have to have an higher
[01:09:41] RPM to get it going that's what the
[01:09:42] problem was so that's why they like the
[01:09:44] three prop ones the kick to punch away
[01:09:46] from things so we just need a throttle
[01:09:48] higher rather than just a little
[01:09:50] throttle to go does that make any sense
[01:09:52] so we might want to look into getting
[01:09:53] the folding three blade ones in the
[01:09:55] future so that we it'll be more
[01:09:57] efficient when we're using it and when
[01:09:59] we need to go it goes I can make all
[01:10:01] that stuff and buy tickets for Miami and
[01:10:03] see what kind of boat show Deals they
[01:10:04] can give us yeah see what Boat Show
[01:10:06] deals we can
[01:10:08] get going to we going to the boat show

[01:20:50] that spin up what
[01:20:57] good sound oh sound you like it I like
[01:21:00] it up a little bit all
[01:21:02] right put up the sound a little bit we
[01:21:04] can do it a little louder there we go
[01:21:07] audio
[01:21:10] UPA how's that I think that's good right
[01:21:15] there we go better better
[01:21:18] better yes all righty there we go get
[01:21:21] that in the background very very faint
[01:21:24] all right we can make it a little bit
[01:21:25] louder we can do it a little bit louder
[01:21:27] still there you go how's
[01:21:29] that there you go there should be
[01:21:30] royaltyfree music by the way so I
[01:21:33] shouldn't have any issues with
[01:21:35] this hopefully H we'll find
[01:21:39] out there we go right there all right
[01:21:42] nice nice all right good well we got
[01:21:44] some of that there we have our brakes
[01:21:45] that we have pinned and all that stuff
[01:21:47] um oh no I didn't pin it I didn't have
[01:21:49] the right one pinned while you're were
[01:21:50] doing that well we'll pin it now dang it
[01:21:52] I thought I had the right one pinned you
[01:21:53] recognize
[01:21:55] do you
[01:21:56] [Music]
[01:21:58] now yeah I don't know i' I've heard some
[01:22:00] of these before I just don't
[01:22:04] um I don't know them all I think I've
[01:22:06] heard him in the background of probably
[01:22:07] other music VI of other people's stuff
[01:22:14] before that's my
[01:22:18] guess but there we have our D gen
[01:22:22] one yes pretty generic Duty free stuff
[01:22:25] exactly correct M Nico so we'll have
[01:22:29] that run out in the background well you
[01:22:30] can listen while we're rocking on the
[01:22:32] boat

[01:38:28] in one life where my family when we were
[01:38:30] young I didn't realize it but we um we
[01:38:33] lived in a trailer I guess we were
[01:38:34] homeless at one point I didn't actually
[01:38:36] realize that when I was younger so we
[01:38:38] were in a trailer I was swinging for a
[01:38:39] tree you know thinking it was fun it was
[01:38:41] me as a kid nothing major and then
[01:38:44] uh everyone wants to C want everyone
[01:38:47] waking up and coming in to hang out
[01:38:48] welcome in folks oh that's what it is
[01:38:49] thank you f oh voice music agree voice
[01:38:53] voice music gone perfect yeah all right
[01:38:57] we have our oh we had a little wble a
[01:39:00] little wobble little wobble knock you
[01:39:03] over there you go yes I am living a fun
[01:39:06] dream locked in that is a lot of
[01:39:09] inventory
[01:39:11] yes hold on here here we go is this
[01:39:14] better he can you hear me better
[01:39:22] now better now yeah okay I had I had the
[01:39:24] wrong audio on my bad I forgot to change
[01:39:26] the audio from uh camo to this
[01:39:31] one I was more impressed by the music by
[01:39:34] the mass than that dingy the mass is
[01:39:35] nice and big it's nicely it's only it's
[01:39:38] actually only 62 and change which allows
[01:39:40] us to go through all of the um inter
[01:39:42] coals because they're always over I
[01:39:43] think they're always 65 so we can
[01:39:45] actually go through them at high tide I
[01:39:47] think there's maybe one bridge in um
[01:39:49] Florida somewhere that we might not be
[01:39:50] able to and I think it's only because
[01:39:51] they're all they're all draw Bridges
[01:39:53] right right uh down south yeah yeah the
[01:39:55] draw Bridges is what it
[01:39:57] is we are in we are in um good morning
[01:40:00] Dad guy we're actually in St Thomas
[01:40:02] right now we had to come here to pick
[01:40:04] the boat up then we're going to sail
[01:40:06] depending on what we talk to a guy about
[01:40:07] getting solar on our boat here there's a
[01:40:09] guy we spoke to and if he can get solar
[01:40:11] to put on our boat we're going to sail
[01:40:13] to Puerto Rico my wife will fly home get
[01:40:15] our dog we're going to pay for somebody
[01:40:17] to put um uh s up our davit so that we
[01:40:21] can put solar panels on there cuz so
[01:40:23] we're going to get five like 400 W solar
[01:40:25] panels up there so we can get like 2,000
[01:40:26] watts and about uh I think I'm going to
[01:40:28] have 1,000 amps of batteries in the uh
[01:40:30] 1,000 wait you said what
[01:40:33] 900 we might be able to get four 300s in
[01:40:36] there so we'll be at like 1200 1,200
[01:40:39] yeah or 550 I think or five what 250s
[01:40:43] was it 5 250s maybe I think it might
[01:40:45] have been something like that like but
[01:40:46] either way we were going to have around
[01:40:47] 1,000 to 1200 for a power bank yep and
[01:40:51] then for the most part after that set up
[01:40:54] we get the water maker which we can get
[01:40:57] a portable one if we're having a hard
[01:40:58] time finding the other one Stu you know
[01:40:59] that right cuz it just plugs in and we
[01:41:01] can literally have it hooked in there
[01:41:02] and drain so hook it over the edge and
[01:41:05] plug it in that's fine we need to look
[01:41:07] up here today too and see what the Yeah
[01:41:10] underne under the sink SE if we can put
[01:41:11] a thing there correct so when that's all
[01:41:15] done for the most part we will be able
[01:41:16] to um sail anywhere in the world and not
[01:41:19] even use we won't even have a generator
[01:41:21] running because all the power run
[01:41:24] it that's the goal at
[01:41:26] least good morning good morning everyone
[01:41:28] yeah thank you hotcake thank you thank
[01:41:30] you for coming in so we have our stuff
[01:41:32] break that's the D gen one that we have
[01:41:34] break Pinn there looks like we only had
[01:41:36] a couple people come in with those so
[01:41:38] I'm not sure what we'll uh we only have
[01:41:40] two people on that d one for the
[01:41:42] disimone um so if you guys want to try
[01:41:44] it out you can uh some do of the braks
[01:41:47] here got those going on I was adding in
[01:41:50] our characters and things like that to
[01:41:51] the adventure game put in the different
[01:41:54] sources um I think I just added one in
[01:41:56] there yep yep did we add that one in
[01:41:59] there no we have to add that one in
[01:42:06] [Music]
[01:42:08] there add that one in there there we
[01:42:14] go then we do have the other in
[01:42:17] there I think we got everything that was
[01:42:19] made I think we got everything that was
[01:42:22] made
[01:42:24] shipping is kind of tough so chicken the
[01:42:27] way that I have it set up is that I have
[01:42:29] um I have to on Monday I have to finish
[01:42:32] fill filling out the stuff for a
[01:42:34] warehouse that I have going in Florida
[01:42:35] it's going to be in Miami um all my
[01:42:37] stuff will go into that warehouse um so
[01:42:40] that whenever I buy anything online it's
[01:42:41] going to go to the warehouse and they're
[01:42:43] going to be able to one ship that stuff
[01:42:44] to some of the stuff to me whenever I
[01:42:46] need it depending on where I am but if
[01:42:47] I'm close to the US I'm just going to
[01:42:49] either take a flight back pick it up and
[01:42:50] drop stuff off type thing cuz the
[01:42:52] shipping it's a half dozen the other for
[01:42:53] me to fly back and do a round trip and
[01:42:56] like pick up supplies we might need in
[01:42:57] the US if we're in another country so it
[01:42:59] makes it nice and easy like that for
[01:43:00] like cuz of shipping anyways so we'll
[01:43:02] drop we'll ship something back in a big
[01:43:03] box with everybody's stuff they're going
[01:43:05] to open it literally drop it in the mail
[01:43:07] and that's it that's why it takes like
[01:43:08] one to two weeks sometimes for me to get
[01:43:10] the stuff to you guys but we're working
[01:43:11] out hopefully it get get down to like a
[01:43:13] week that it'll take to get to you guys
[01:43:15] um like a week extra um so like your
[01:43:18] regular shipping and then a week on top
[01:43:20] of that just because of me having to
[01:43:21] drop it off and get it over to other
[01:43:22] people so that's my plan there and then
[01:43:24] also you'll also be able to buy packs
[01:43:26] and other stuff from them at like a
[01:43:28] cheaper price so my poter would be the
[01:43:30] warehouse you would have like warehouse
[01:43:31] deals so you wouldn't be able to get
[01:43:33] your you wouldn't get like stickers you
[01:43:34] wouldn't get the extra padded packaging
[01:43:37] packing like stuff like that you're just
[01:43:38] going to put it in a paded envelope or a
[01:43:40] box depending on how much stuff you
[01:43:41] order and they will ship it on out to
[01:43:44] you so you'll be able to do that stuff
[01:43:49] too dude I went through with that did
[01:43:51] you not see the picture of the suitcase
[01:43:53] do you see the
[01:43:56] suitcase yeah put it all in the suitcase
[01:43:58] they didn't question actually my
[01:43:59] suitcase F finally my suit my humorously
[01:44:02] my suitcase went through my wife's
[01:44:04] didn't again again for the second time
[01:44:06] it's because she had some device in
[01:44:07] there for like getting rid of hair like
[01:44:09] one of those things for hair to get rid
[01:44:10] of your legs and stuff and I guess they
[01:44:12] thought they had to pull it out and
[01:44:13] check that but it was funny cuz
[01:44:16] underwear fell out and the uh the guy
[01:44:18] had to like he was zipping up the
[01:44:19] suitcase and my wife's like um my you

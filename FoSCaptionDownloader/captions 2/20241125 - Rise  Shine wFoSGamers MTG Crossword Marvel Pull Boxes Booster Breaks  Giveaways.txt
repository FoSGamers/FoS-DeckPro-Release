[02:06:47] let's do some more of our packs here I
[02:06:49] say we do
[02:06:53] I say we
[02:06:57] do it's even this out
[02:06:59] here let's even this out
[02:07:05] here let's put one of these
[02:07:15] out put one of those out with it here
[02:07:19] let's try those the Wilds of alra there
[02:07:22] and that uh mystery
[02:07:24] booster mystery booster
[02:07:27] to let's try those hopefully you guys
[02:07:30] are having a good
[02:07:31] Sunday we'll uh addit that we'll put
[02:07:35] those on
[02:07:37] there Wilds is a hit you think Ethan
[02:07:40] says Ethan seems the Wilds is a hit he
[02:07:42] says so we'll have to find out he's got
[02:07:43] a pretty good luck when he says things
[02:07:44] are like that so we're going to put this
[02:07:46] on here for
[02:07:52] that instead of uh the 28 it would
[02:07:55] normally be because whenever we do
[02:07:56] things together I'm able to do a little
[02:07:58] bit of a discount for you guys because
[02:08:00] it's multiple packs together rather than
[02:08:02] sing individual I don't have to pay for
[02:08:03] certain fees so it helps me also so
[02:08:06] we're going to do that there for those
[02:08:08] two so instead of
[02:08:10] 28 that's what it would
[02:08:12] be and then hazer number between 1 and
[02:08:15] 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 nine between 1 and 10

[02:53:29] happened we didn't
[02:53:32] finish you get a sword in a knife and
[02:53:34] some intelligence you were just about
[02:53:36] like you had like one swing left on what
[02:53:37] you were going to do with the bug scrap
[02:53:40] shooter we'll get your scrap shooter out
[02:53:42] let's find some packs that are going to
[02:53:43] be good here let's find some good packs
[02:53:45] here
[02:53:49] scrap shooter there you go my
[02:53:54] friend yep I think that's where you were
[02:53:56] at you didn't you need to do what you
[02:53:57] were trying to do there you're trying to
[02:53:59] be sneaky hey
[02:54:02] Oblivion sneaky
[02:54:05] sneaky all right let's put this over
[02:54:09] here all righty so if I remember right
[02:54:13] what that means is you were going up
[02:54:15] against a small bug that small L you had
[02:54:18] missed twice all right and you have a uh
[02:54:23] let me get the uh thing out here to
[02:54:26] roll that's the way it was whatever my
[02:54:29] little fake my tower I made to do it
[02:54:31] easy then you had a
[02:54:35] choice you have one more roll or run
[02:54:37] away because if you get hurt and you end
[02:54:40] up getting knocked out the bug will take
[02:54:42] your stuff at least one of your things
[02:54:45] before you leave but if you run away you
[02:54:47] get to choose you want your drop and
[02:54:49] since you have a couple of knives you
[02:54:50] could choose to drop a ice versus having
[02:54:52] your sword taken or you can try to run
[02:54:55] try to attack one more time and if you
[02:54:57] miss though but you do have a plus five
[02:55:01] with your sword when you're swinging
[02:55:03] here we're going to find some
[02:55:09] packs you to attack I like it we're
[02:55:12] doing it anyways we're
[02:55:15] attacking no no no no not that happening
[02:55:17] we don't want those falling all
[02:55:22] over all right now we're going to grab
[02:55:25] um I'm going to take this dice we're GNA
[02:55:27] do this dice that sound
[02:55:29] good all
[02:55:33] right so we have a little like like
[02:55:35] Adventure game that we play uh where
[02:55:38] some people can buy in the ad in the in
[02:55:40] the um buy now there's a thing you can
[02:55:42] buy that's a little Adventure game that
[02:55:44] people like to play kind of like just a
[02:55:46] fun thing we made to do while we're were
[02:55:47] hanging out being when we're board one
[02:55:49] being board you know so here we're going
[02:55:52] to roll and you need to get
[02:55:55] over you have to get over where's the uh
[02:55:58] your bug your bug is 13 15 you have to
[02:56:01] get over 15 but you have plus five so
[02:56:03] it's 10 or
[02:56:04] more oh this time you actually got an 18
[02:56:07] now you got them nice so your
[02:56:11] Venture
[02:56:13] swings the
[02:56:15] sword at the small bug and this time
[02:56:19] there's a nice hit nice big hit on that
[02:56:21] small bug and brings him from 25 down to
[02:56:26] that's it's a good one down
[02:56:29] to 11 now the bug injured swipes at you
[02:56:34] one last time and turns and runs though
[02:56:37] but because you did not yeah he he
[02:56:40] injured you and you got only one hit on
[02:56:42] them luckily you don't drop anything but
[02:56:44] when they run away they do only drop one
[02:56:47] thing when they run away way but they're
[02:56:49] small bugs they didn't have much to drop
[02:56:51] anyways they drop a Pog for you so
[02:56:54] there's some of your you got some extra
[02:56:56] for me you instead of four you now have
[02:56:58] five pogs
[02:57:04] rev which is the uh currency for our
[02:57:07] Wasteland so there you go that was your
[02:57:10] thing there you had the one last thing
[02:57:11] left that was where we were at so that's
[02:57:13] why we just wanted to finish that off he
[02:57:14] was uh something happened I can't I
[02:57:16] don't know what happened there there you
[02:57:17] go
[02:57:21] here you go yeah it's it's silly it's
[02:57:23] silly but it's fun it's a fun little
[02:57:26] thing here that's all it is and if you
[02:57:27] can we we'll get into it a lot when we
[02:57:29] have a lot of it going on so like say
[02:57:31] for instance um we had uh a
[02:57:35] person all right for instance rev now
[02:57:38] just buys this what says next the reason
[02:57:40] why it says locked room is a safe haven
[02:57:43] that means he now has the access code
[02:57:45] for three Tres to get to the locked room
[02:57:56] aha there you go lock
[02:57:59] room plus you also get the single there
[02:58:01] which is a god of souls that's a good
[02:58:04] pick up in the single and of itself
[02:58:06] there you go
[02:58:07] buddy let me get your gu to sold out I
[02:58:10] think that's this right here nice one
[02:58:13] rev tank you've got some luck today dude
[02:58:16] you're hitting all the good ones all the
[02:58:17] big big ones except you got one big one
[02:58:21] but we had to put another one in there
[02:58:22] because you got one big one already out
[02:58:24] of this Iron Man so we had to add
[02:58:25] another one in there but this one you
[02:58:27] know you going to get the other one here
[02:58:28] we'll find out but now you have the
[02:58:30] locked room you can go to do you want to
[02:58:31] go to the locked room and trade
[02:58:36] anything
[02:58:38] a well I appreciate it skyd thank you
[02:58:42] yeah it's a little fun thing here you
[02:58:44] you buy in purchase one of the things
[02:58:45] here you can see what happens
[02:58:48] I'm going to do another Safe Haven
[02:58:53] one I have to I'm waiting on stuff with
[02:58:55] the boat is really what I'm figuring out
[02:58:57] here because I don't know when I'm I
[02:58:58] think I might be traveling back there
[02:59:00] and I don't want to have set it up and
[02:59:01] have to cancel if that make sense so
[02:59:03] I've been waiting till that's all set up
[02:59:04] until I'm like kind of set up on the
[02:59:06] boat more where it's probably going to
[02:59:07] be like another month I'm guessing maybe
[02:59:09] around Christmas time we might get the
[02:59:11] our next one in for another game night
[02:59:13] but Ariel aella Exemplar of Justice
[02:59:18] we'll get that out for you and you also
[02:59:20] have now the hole in the wall you have
[02:59:23] three for the hole in the wall
[02:59:25] aha hole in the wall now here's your
[02:59:29] aurella let's get that out
[02:59:33] here ah not The Vindicator the Exemplar
[02:59:36] of Justice there you go there you
[02:59:39] go now you got three uh you got three
[02:59:42] codes for that

[02:59:45] actually was I've been thinking about it
[02:59:47] too the problem is just I need to get it
[02:59:49] I need to have the time to do it without
[02:59:51] having to like going down to the boat to
[02:59:53] try to figure it out and stuff like that
[02:59:55] so that's why we're I'm I I don't don't

[03:09:09] up against him with all right so you
[03:09:11] have the gator dowo you also have a
[03:09:13] critical hit you can use and a plasma
[03:09:15] rifle you actually you're kind of
[03:09:16] stacked you are right you did come
[03:09:18] stacked into this came into this
[03:09:20] adventure stacked here we go let's
[03:09:22] see
[03:09:24] though what happens with you here my
[03:09:29] friend let's see what happens with you
[03:09:31] here my friend all right we're going to
[03:09:32] put these back move this over here out
[03:09:35] of the way going put these here so that
[03:09:38] we can get to Rolling our
[03:09:41] Dice and you my friend uh here
[03:09:45] do we're going to have to tell
[03:09:51] me what we're going to be doing all
[03:09:55] right here we
[03:09:59] are pulls from P
[03:10:03] streams um yes we can uh but I haven't
[03:10:06] gone that far back into them before I
[03:10:08] mean if you really want to you can go
[03:10:09] and look at some of them but generally I
[03:10:11] go from the it is where you get your
[03:10:12] character and you go from there forward
[03:10:14] all right we have one hit
[03:10:17] you got a
[03:10:19] four all right even with your plus five
[03:10:21] of your RI plasma rifle it's not going
[03:10:23] to do anything so
[03:10:26] uh actually I didn't even ask what you
[03:10:28] wanted to do that was my bad I was
[03:10:30] assuming you were going to
[03:10:31] attack are you going to attack what do
[03:10:33] you want to do you can run away if you
[03:10:35] have to run away you're going to drop
[03:10:36] something because you have to drop
[03:10:38] something when you run
[03:10:39] away you have to let them you know there
[03:10:41] has to be something for them to get
[03:10:43] instead of chase after you
[03:10:49] all right we're going to do this here
[03:10:51] though while we wait I think these ones
[03:10:53] are nice packs those are feeling good
[03:10:56] earlier I'm going to put those packs
[03:10:58] back out
[03:10:59] there G to put those packs out
[03:11:03] there we going to put those ones those
[03:11:05] are feeling good earlier and I want to
[03:11:06] try those ones
[03:11:11] again and put those on there for this
[03:11:14] again try those too
[03:11:19] guaranteed critical
[03:11:22] hit no you don't need a roll hit no roll
[03:11:25] is just if it hits or not if you're
[03:11:26] going to hit it or not is really what it
[03:11:28] is critical hit is but you're kind of
[03:11:31] like guaranteeing one and when we do a
[03:11:32] roll on a critical hit I I kind of do
[03:11:34] what the points are for the strength and
[03:11:35] how much you get on there and I add it
[03:11:37] in is what that is add it into whatever
[03:11:41] comes up with on my uh stuff
[03:11:45] here no it won't the gator in a single
[03:11:48] hit but it'll get a good one your
[03:11:49] options would be to shoot with the uh
[03:11:52] plasma rifle um now you're going to get
[03:11:55] plus five to guarantee you like on your
[03:11:57] on a guarant up to your hit for the roll
[03:11:59] so say for instance you roll you know a
[03:12:02] 16 out of the 18 you'd lose but if plus
[03:12:06] five would make it over the 18 so you'd
[03:12:08] hit them now I have it a roll over here
[03:12:10] I just had a a randomized numbers that
[03:12:12] it pulls out in my Excel sheet and then
[03:12:15] does your number hit for hit but
[03:12:18] whenever you have a critical one I have
[03:12:21] you automatically hit and I just use
[03:12:23] these points and I add it
[03:12:25] onto what you have uh hit the character
[03:12:28] with so you're automatically going to
[03:12:29] hit him if you use your plasma rifle but
[03:12:31] it is what what the critical hit you're
[03:12:32] adding on here is what you're adding on
[03:12:35] for your numbers plus five for your
[03:12:38] weapon if that makes any
[03:12:41] sense that's kind of the way I was doing
[03:12:43] it I have been doing it
[03:12:47] we threw those out there for packs if
[03:12:48] anybody wants them nobody wanted those
[03:12:50] packs I'll put those back away there the
[03:12:52] gator dowo is a beefy one he is a beefy
[03:12:55] one I'm going to put this away here my
[03:12:58] friends all right there we go let me get
[03:13:01] that
[03:13:04] away and then I think what I'm going to
[03:13:06] end up doing is I think we're going to
[03:13:07] open up something here something fun
[03:13:09] here in a little bit we'll find
[03:13:11] out let's see it in action critical
[03:13:14] amulet with the rifle all right you're
[03:13:16] going to use use your critical
[03:13:18] hit amulet and you take your plasma
[03:13:20] rifle out you see right in front of you
[03:13:24] as you open that door a gator dillow oh
[03:13:27] no that Gator dowo you roll you're
[03:13:31] guaranteeing a hit but what are you
[03:13:32] going to hit him with you hit with nine
[03:13:35] plus five so that means you're going to
[03:13:37] get 14 on top
[03:13:41] of oo 16 14 on top of 16 that brings o
[03:13:46] nice little hit goes from 45 down to 10
[03:13:48] Health that puts a nice
[03:13:54] hole Wait no that's wrong go on 15
[03:13:58] Health 15 Health math
[03:14:00] wrong 15 Health that was a nice hit on
[03:14:03] that one now that Gator Dillo is quite
[03:14:05] mad but the gator Dillo is rather
[03:14:09] injured right now he's critically
[03:14:10] injured he's got one of his front limbs
[03:14:15] missing so he's going a hard time
[03:14:17] running now he can't do anything he Tri
[03:14:19] charging towards you but he falls flat
[03:14:21] on his face you get one shot extra
[03:14:22] because you got lucky on that one are
[03:14:24] you going to take your extra chance well
[03:14:26] you're G to get two more chances is what
[03:14:29] it is here we'll see what we
[03:14:33] got blast them all right we're going to
[03:14:35] do it again we roll in oh it's 14 plus
[03:14:39] your five making you 19 so you hit him
[03:14:42] again let's see what it
[03:14:45] is o
[03:14:47] oh he's almost dead he's at three Health
[03:14:51] he goes to get up that Gator dowo you
[03:14:53] blast him oh you blast that Gator Dillo
[03:14:55] he goes to get up and he
[03:14:59] falls down again because he's almost
[03:15:01] dead are you going to take the last shot
[03:15:03] and and put him out of his misery you
[03:15:05] can walk pretty much right up to him at
[03:15:06] this point he's he's he's half melted
[03:15:09] with that plasma rifle and you only have
[03:15:11] one you shot twice three shots or two
[03:15:15] shots two shots shots only so far Two
[03:15:17] Shots you have one last one one left
[03:15:19] after this you're going to go up to him
[03:15:21] with your plasma rifle doesn't really
[03:15:23] matter what the rooll oh roll is because
[03:15:26] you're going to hit him anyways because
[03:15:27] you're right next to him but instead of
[03:15:28] being like a high hit you put it luckily
[03:15:30] you only need three you get 11 you hit
[03:15:33] him with 11 you drop him down two Z
[03:15:35] killing him and that Gator Dillo luckily
[03:15:38] is put out of his misery but what you
[03:15:40] find on the gator Dillo though is
[03:15:42] intriguing so on the gator dowo you see
[03:15:46] that Gator Dillo has has been
[03:15:52] forging because the gator Dill has been
[03:15:54] forging and they got they've had some
[03:15:56] pogs on them you one two three four five
[03:15:59] six seven and eight pogs you found and
[03:16:04] also you had found you got
[03:16:07] lucky you found
[03:16:10] a box of assault rifle
[03:16:12] ammo on them look at that on that gator
[03:16:16] dowo
[03:16:17] so you have
[03:16:20] now
[03:16:23] Doughboy
[03:16:28] apog and one

[03:19:17] here for a
[03:19:24] minute yes so you continue the adventure
[03:19:26] from here so this is why I I'll explain
[03:19:28] it that's I was going to I wanted to put
[03:19:29] this up here and you know what screw it
[03:19:31] I'm going to put this up here to B our
[03:19:32] discount we're going to put this up here

[03:19:35] up before the end of the show we're
[03:19:37] going to do we're going to
[03:19:41] do we're going to do that H why
[03:19:44] not all right so you get to carry your
[03:19:48] character over each um each episode so
[03:19:50] every time you come on you can pick up
[03:19:52] your character and go there is multiple
[03:19:54] boxes um you have available for them now
[03:19:57] any of the ones here that you jump in on
[03:19:59] say for instance uh you know you wanted
[03:20:02] some health or weapons you would say I
[03:20:03] need some weapons here and you jump in
[03:20:05] the weapon break one that I have or you
[03:20:07] can always go to the buy now and I do
[03:20:09] have one where some people that ask just
[03:20:11] to be able to play the game cheaply
[03:20:13] where they just you know once they have
[03:20:14] their character they just want to
[03:20:15] continue playing the game while I have a
[03:20:17] couple those which are just they're a
[03:20:19] dollar for each one they are just really
[03:20:21] what it is is something like this you'll
[03:20:22] pull it out and I'll be like oh you have
[03:20:24] locked room it's really just a bulk card
[03:20:26] of some kind but in one of these 120
[03:20:29] cards it says a play booster pack uh
[03:20:31] pack that's it something a little extra
[03:20:33] in there but the whole point is mainly

[03:20:40] being said that's kind of how it is and

[03:20:45] for instance you and Rev
[03:20:47] are at 100 health because neither of you
[03:20:50] are hit by your
[03:20:53] characters but you're also um there's
[03:20:56] also other people from other days that
[03:20:57] have been playing that have uh if they
[03:20:59] want to come in and what you can do
[03:21:01] though too is um at the end as you go on

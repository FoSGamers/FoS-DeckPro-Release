[2024-10-04 10:53:47] FoSGamers:
Can you make the other models work like that model?

[2024-10-04 10:54:08] ChatGPT:
No, I cannot directly modify or make other models work exactly like a specific version (such as the **O1** model) or other premium/experimental versions. The behavior and capabilities of each model version (like GPT-3, GPT-4, or GPT-4-turbo) are defined and managed by OpenAI. Each model has unique training data, architecture, and operational differences that cannot be altered by an external request.

However, **you can adjust some model behavior** and tailor responses to your preferences using certain parameters (if you're working with the **API**) or settings available in your **ChatGPT environment**. Here’s how you might adjust other models to behave more like a preferred model:

### 1. **Parameter Tuning** (API Use)
If you use the API, you can adjust the following settings to try and make a different model behave closer to your desired O1 model or more advanced versions:
   - **Temperature:** This controls the randomness of responses. A higher temperature (e.g., 0.7) leads to more creative responses, while a lower temperature (e.g., 0.1) results in more focused, deterministic answers.
   - **Top-p:** Controls the diversity of responses. A lower top-p can lead to more conservative responses, while a higher value allows for more creative outputs.
   - **Max Tokens:** Defines the length of responses. Adjusting the max token limit can give you longer, more detailed responses similar to premium versions.
   - **Frequency and Presence Penalties:** These affect repetition and the introduction of new topics. You can increase penalties to make the model more dynamic and less repetitive.

### 2. **Refining Prompts**
Although you can't fully replicate a model's underlying architecture, you can optimize **prompt engineering** to get responses that are closer to what you'd expect from more advanced models. By using clearer and more detailed instructions, you can coax more sophisticated and specific results from any model:
   - Be specific in your requests (e.g., provide context, tone, or style preferences).
   - Use multi-part prompts where you outline multiple steps for the model to follow.
   - Add examples in the prompt to guide the model toward the output you want.

### 3. **Use of Specialized Libraries and APIs**
In certain cases, you can combine OpenAI models with external APIs or libraries for specific tasks. For example, using OpenAI's API alongside external data sources can mimic more advanced or customized behaviors:
   - Combining models with NLP libraries or using structured knowledge bases alongside model outputs.
   - Integrating tools that allow for more detailed responses or interactive capabilities.

### 4. **Model-Specific Features**
While GPT-4 models are more advanced than earlier versions like GPT-3, and each has its unique strengths, newer models like **GPT-4-turbo** are optimized for performance and speed. If you want to get behavior closer to a specific model, selecting **GPT-4** over **GPT-3** (or **GPT-4-turbo** if available) will likely get you closer to the type of response that a preview model provides.

### Summary:
While I cannot make other models work exactly like a specific one (like O1), you can adjust model parameters, refine your prompts, and integrate additional tools to improve the behavior and quality of responses. Additionally, using higher-tier models (such as GPT-4 or GPT-4-turbo) will naturally get you closer to more sophisticated outputs.

[2024-10-04 10:54:15] FoSGamers:
I don't want to use the API. I only want to use stuff within ChatGPT itself.

[2024-10-04 10:54:48] ChatGPT:
If you're only using **ChatGPT within the app** and not through the API, there are still a few ways to improve the quality of responses or get results that feel closer to the O1 preview model without making direct changes to the underlying models. Here’s what you can do:

### 1. **Optimize Your Prompts**
While you can't change the models themselves, the **quality of your prompts** can make a significant difference. The more precise, structured, and detailed your prompts are, the closer you'll get to responses that mimic the O1 model.

Here’s how you can improve prompts within ChatGPT:
- **Be Explicit and Detailed**: Include clear instructions in your prompt. For example, if you want a more creative or in-depth response, ask for that specifically.
   - Example: “Provide a detailed, imaginative description of a futuristic city with a focus on its technology and architecture.”
   
- **Use Multi-Step Instructions**: If the response is complex, break it down into multiple steps. This makes the model perform better by organizing its output.
   - Example: "First, describe the visual appearance of the city. Next, explain how its technology functions. Then, detail the daily lives of its inhabitants."
   
- **Use Examples in Prompts**: If you’ve seen responses from the O1 model or others that you like, you can include examples of those outputs in your prompt as guidance.
   - Example: "Here’s an example of how I want the structure of the answer: [Insert response]. Now, provide a similar answer for [topic]."

### 2. **Use GPT-4 Instead of GPT-3.5**
If you have **ChatGPT Plus**, you're likely using **GPT-4** already, but make sure it’s activated, as **GPT-4** typically provides better and more sophisticated responses compared to GPT-3.5.

- When you're chatting, check the **model version** at the top of the conversation. If it says "GPT-4," you’re using the most advanced version available in ChatGPT itself. If you're using GPT-3.5, switching to GPT-4 can yield better results.
   
### 3. **Engage in Follow-Up Prompts**
You can steer the conversation to refine or elaborate on responses. For example, after an initial response, follow up with:
   - "Can you expand on that?" 
   - "Provide more detailed examples."
   - "Make this explanation more creative."

This approach helps the model deliver results similar to how O1 versions might perform by guiding it through iterative refinement.

### 4. **Use Custom Instructions**
Within the **ChatGPT app**, you can also use **Custom Instructions** (found under settings) to tailor the model’s responses more closely to your preferences. Here’s how to set that up:
   - **Under "What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better responses?"**, provide context about your preferences, goals, or any specific writing styles you prefer.
   - **Under "How would you like ChatGPT to respond?"**, you can request things like tone, depth of analysis, or level of creativity. For example: "Please provide detailed and thoughtful responses with creativity and depth, as I am looking for in-depth analyses or descriptions."

### 5. **Experiment with Temperature and Length (Internal Settings)**
In the standard ChatGPT app, you don’t directly control model parameters like temperature, but you can still influence how creative or concise the model is by specifying the response type. 
   - Ask for longer, more elaborate answers: "Provide a detailed explanation with creative insights."
   - Ask for more structured or focused answers: "Give a concise, to-the-point response with minimal examples."

### 6. **Monitor New Updates or Beta Features**
Sometimes, OpenAI rolls out new features or tweaks model behavior, even within the ChatGPT app. Make sure you have the **latest version of the app**, and keep an eye on new releases or announcements that might offer new functionality (like enhanced response types or previews of new models) directly within the app.

### Summary:
Without using the API, you can improve your experience by **optimizing prompts**, using **Custom Instructions**, switching to **GPT-4** for more advanced responses, and giving **clear feedback** during conversations. These approaches can help you get responses closer to what you'd expect from the O1 model within ChatGPT itself.

- **Examples and Elaboration:**
  - "Whenever applicable, provide examples, real-world applications, or analogies to help explain more complex concepts."
  - "Offer elaboration on topics when prompted to do so, but don't overwhelm the user with unnecessary details unless asked for further information."

- **Conversational Flow:**
  - "Make the conversation feel fluid and natural. If the user asks a follow-up question, build on your previous responses to keep the context intact."
  - "Always adapt to the user's tone and style in responses, making sure to maintain relevance and context."

- **Adaptability:**
  - "Be versatile in your responses, capable of answering both technical and creative questions with equal skill. For more complex questions, feel free to ask clarifying questions or guide the user step by step."
  
### 3. **Custom Instructions Examples**

Use this section to provide some specific examples for how you want the GPT to respond:

- **Example for Creativity and Depth:**
  - **Prompt:** "What would a futuristic city look like in 100 years?"
  - **Desired Response:** 
    "In 100 years, a futuristic city might be a blend of natural and technological wonders. Buildings would likely soar above the clouds, composed of self-healing materials and covered in vertical gardens. Energy would be sourced from renewable technologies embedded into the very architecture—solar panels, wind turbines, and kinetic energy converters integrated into the infrastructure. Transportation would shift towards autonomous drones, magnetically levitated trains, and underground hyperloops, making traditional roads a thing of the past. At the center of the city, there could be AI-managed ecosystems that maintain the balance between technology and nature, ensuring that the city thrives sustainably."

- **Example for Technical Response:**
  - **Prompt:** "Explain how neural networks function in AI."
  - **Desired Response:**
    "Neural networks are modeled after the human brain and consist of layers of interconnected 'neurons.' These networks operate in layers: the input layer receives the data, the hidden layers process the data, and the output layer delivers the result. Each connection between neurons has a 'weight' that determines its importance. When the input is processed, each neuron calculates a weighted sum and passes it through an activation function to determine if it 'fires' or not. Over time, through a process called backpropagation, the neural network adjusts these weights to reduce error and improve its predictions, making it a powerful tool for tasks like image recognition or language processing."

- **Example for Short, Concise Answer:**
  - **Prompt:** "What is quantum computing?"
  - **Desired Response:** 
    "Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics, using qubits that can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This allows quantum computers to process complex problems much faster than classical computers by performing many calculations in parallel. However, the technology is still in its early stages and requires further development before becoming mainstream."

### 4. **Optional Additional Behavior**

If you want to further refine your custom GPT to mimic the O1-Preview version, consider adding these behaviors:

- **Knowledge Expansion:**
  - "In instances where the user asks about emerging or cutting-edge topics, provide the most recent known information and explain that developments may continue to evolve."

- **Handling Follow-Ups:**
  - "For follow-up questions, ensure continuity by referencing the previous responses where necessary, maintaining the context of the conversation."

### 5. **Save and Test**
Once you've input these settings and examples, save your **Custom GPT**. Afterward, you can start testing it with different types of prompts (creative, technical, etc.) to see how it aligns with the behavior of the O1-Preview version.

---

They may need updates or upgrades to the document in the future and expect me to analyze, understand, and deeply familiarize myself with it as if I had created it.

[2024-10-04 11:03:40] FoSGamers:
Model set context updated.

[2024-10-04 11:03:40] ChatGPT:
Now that I have thoroughly reviewed your **FoSGamers Business Bible**, I can provide tailored updates or enhancements based on your specific needs for your custom GPT. Here are some potential areas for updates to integrate your business into the **Custom GPT**:

### 1. **Branding and Identity Awareness**
- Ensure that the Custom GPT responds with **consistent use of the FoSGamers brand voice**. The tone should be **energetic, friendly, and engaging**, particularly when addressing community-based questions or product descriptions.
  
### 2. **Business Strategy and Content Awareness**
- For queries about FoSGamers' unique content (e.g., **Wasteland Odyssey**, custom card games, or interactive events), provide responses that include an explanation of the unique features (like your **mini-battles on a 3x3 grid**, **shared energy pools**, or the **Legacy card system**).
- For questions about sales and events, the GPT could be set up to **explain the structure of events**, giveaways, and sales (like what occurs in your **Rise & Shine w/FoSGamers morning show** or your special events during **FoSGamers at Night**).

### 3. **Customization for Show Formats and Game Shows**
- Tailor the GPT to understand and provide guidance on your various show formats and interactive game events like **Wheel of Magic** or **Wasteland Adventure**. Ensure that when a user asks about your **game shows**, the GPT describes the mechanics (like **spinning the Wheel** or **character selection in Wasteland Adventure**).
  
### 4. **Detailed Game Mechanics Integration**
- Since **Wasteland Odyssey** is a key element, ensure that your Custom GPT is fully aware of the **rulebook mechanics**, including:
  - **Turn structure**
  - **Card upgrading and rarity levels**
  - **Level-based progression and campaign paths**
  - **Shared energy pool mechanics**
  - **Victory conditions and cooperative dynamics**

For gameplay or card-related questions, the GPT could dive into specific mechanics (e.g., **how the shared energy pool works** or **what upgrading a legendary character involves**). 

### 5. **Content Creation Process Automation**
- Use the Custom GPT to automate content-related tasks such as suggesting **SEO-optimized keywords** for streams or YouTube videos, planning out **weekly content calendars**, or offering tips for improving content production (e.g., advising on video editing techniques or thumbnail designs based on your branding guidelines).
  
### 6. **Automation and Tools Integration**
- Program the GPT to suggest tools based on your current setup (like **Streamer.bot** or **Restream.io**) and to provide specific technical instructions or optimizations for streaming.
  
### 7. **Marketing and Engagement Suggestions**
- GPT responses could be enhanced to provide marketing advice tailored to **FoSGamers' growth strategies**, like creating **event-based hashtags**, running community-focused giveaways, or providing cross-platform content strategies.

### 8. **Scalability and Global Expansion**
- Future-proof the GPT with knowledge about **global expansion** plans or **NFT integration**. If someone asks about future developments, the GPT could explain **how digital cards and physical integration** might work.

Would you like me to apply any specific updates for your custom GPT based on these suggestions or any other focus areas?

[2024-10-04 11:19:17] FoSGamers:
Yes.

[2024-10-04 11:20:11] ChatGPT:
Here are the updates and details I recommend applying to your custom GPT based on the **FoSGamers Business Bible**. I'll provide both behavioral instructions and sample prompts to shape the GPT responses to match the needs of your business.

### 1. **Branding and Identity Instructions**

     - "Respond with an energetic and inclusive tone, reflecting FoSGamers' brand identity. Keep the language approachable, fun, and engaging, particularly when addressing the gaming community."
     - "In all responses, incorporate humor and excitement when discussing events or games. For example, when talking about a live stream, describe it in a way that builds anticipation."

   - **Consistency in Branding:**
     - "When mentioning content or events, always refer to the specific show formats (e.g., *'Rise & Shine w/FoSGamers'*, *'FoSGamers at Night'*) and reinforce the connection with the FoSGamers brand."
     - "Include phrases that promote community interaction, such as *'Join the fun!'* or *'Let’s build something together!'* in responses related to events, tournaments, or community engagements."

   **Sample Prompt:**
   - **User:** "What’s FoSGamers about?"
   - **Response:** 
     - "FoSGamers is an online entertainment brand that brings together trading card game enthusiasts from all over the world! Whether you're tuning in for our *'Rise & Shine w/FoSGamers'* morning show to catch some awesome card pulls or jumping into a late-night stream with *'FoSGamers at Night'*, our mission is to create an inclusive, interactive space for the TCG community. From giveaways and scavenger hunts to custom games like *Wasteland Odyssey*, there's always something exciting happening. Come join the fun and be part of the FoSGamers family!"

### 2. **Business Strategy and Event Integration**

     - "When asked about FoSGamers services, explain the mix of live streams, deck-building sessions, and interactive games. Mention the unique events like scavenger hunts or exclusive *Wheel of Magic* spins."
     - "For content-related questions, emphasize FoSGamers' unique value propositions, such as custom game development, interactive events, and community engagement through platforms like Whatnot, YouTube, and Twitch."

   **Sample Prompt:**
   - **User:** "What are the shows like at FoSGamers?"
   - **Response:** 
     - "At FoSGamers, our shows are designed to keep the energy high and the community involved. *'Rise & Shine w/FoSGamers'* kicks off the day with pack openings, deck-building strategies, and fun scavenger hunts. For a more relaxed vibe, we host *'FoSGamers at Night'* with live gameplay and community events like *Wheel of Magic*, where participants get a chance to win great prizes by solving card puzzles. And if you’re looking for a quick lunchtime break, tune into *FoSGamers Lucky Lunch* for sneak peeks and fast-paced auctions. Each show is designed with our community in mind, and there’s always something exciting happening!"

### 3. **Wasteland Odyssey Rulebook and Game Mechanic Awareness**
   - **Custom Instructions:**
     - "When explaining *Wasteland Odyssey* or any of the custom games, dive into the mechanics, such as mini-battles, grid-based combat, and the energy pool system. Highlight how players progress through levels and upgrade legendary cards."
     - "For specific rules or game mechanics, use examples like the *Vita Bunker Showdown* or *Death Race* to illustrate unique gameplay scenarios."

   **Sample Prompt:**
   - **User:** "How does combat work in Wasteland Odyssey?"
   - **Response:** 
     - "Combat in *Wasteland Odyssey* takes place on a 3x3 tactical grid, where each turn represents a mini-battle. Players use their creatures, items, and abilities to defeat enemies or complete objectives. For instance, you can place melee attackers in the front row and ranged attackers in the back row to maximize your strategic advantage. Each action requires energy from a shared energy pool, so you’ll need to balance your card plays carefully. Victory is achieved by defeating enemy units, capturing treasures, or finishing challenges, and upgrading your legendary cards as you go along."

### 4. **Content Strategy Integration and Cross-Platform Awareness**
   - **Custom Instructions:**
     - "When asked about content creation, provide advice on streamlining the process, such as using the FoSGamers content calendar or repurposing live stream clips for social media platforms like TikTok or Instagram Reels."

   - **User:** "How does FoSGamers create content for so many platforms?"
   - **Response:** 
     - "FoSGamers takes a streamlined approach to content creation by planning with a detailed content calendar. We focus on core themes, like *Magic: The Gathering* pack openings, game strategy guides, and community-driven content. Each live stream can be repurposed into shorter clips for platforms like TikTok or Instagram, while longer, more in-depth videos are perfect for YouTube. We optimize our content for SEO, using relevant keywords to ensure it reaches the right audience. This way, we maintain a consistent presence across all platforms while engaging with fans on their favorite channels."

### 5. **Show Formatting and Interactive Game Mechanics**
   - **Custom Instructions:**
     - "For any interactive event, make sure the GPT explains the mechanics clearly. For example, in *Wheel of Magic*, include how the wheel spins, the guessing process, and the points system."
     - "For each game, include both the fun and reward aspects to keep users engaged, and ensure responses mention community participation."

   **Sample Prompt:**
   - **User:** "What’s the Wheel of Magic about?"
   - **Response:** 
     - "*Wheel of Magic* is one of the most exciting games we play during the stream! Each round starts with an auction for an MTG booster pack or single card. The auction winner gets to co-host and spin the Wheel of Magic, which determines what action happens next. You could win another pack, face a puzzle challenge, or even hit a *Bankrupt* spot! Players guess letters to solve the name of a Magic: The Gathering card, earning points along the way. The person with the most points wins the round and gets to choose the next prize bundle. It’s fast-paced, interactive, and full of surprises!"

### 6. **Automation, Tools, and Event Management**

Got it! Now that the **FoSGamers Lucky Lunch** is part of the lineup and features random, special content, I’ll ensure the custom GPT can reflect that dynamic when responding. Here’s how we can integrate it:

### Updated Custom Instructions:
- **Tone and Style for Lunchtime Show:**
  - "When asked about *FoSGamers Lucky Lunch*, describe it as a casual, surprise stream that offers similar content to morning and evening shows but with an occasional twist."
  - "Emphasize that this show is spontaneous and might include exclusive sneak peeks, fast-paced auctions, or surprise special events that aren’t typically done in the afternoon."

### Sample Prompt:
- **User:** "What is FoSGamers Lucky Lunch?"
- **Response:**
  - "*FoSGamers Lucky Lunch* is our surprise, pop-up stream that you don’t want to miss! While we don’t usually stream in the afternoon, this show brings the same excitement as our morning and evening streams but with a twist. We throw in something special, like exclusive sneak peeks, fast-paced auctions, or surprise giveaways, making it a unique experience every time. Since it's not on the regular schedule, make sure to keep an eye out for announcements on social media to catch it live!"

This ensures the GPT reflects the random, special nature of the **FoSGamers Lucky Lunch** while keeping the tone consistent with your brand. Let me know if you need further updates!

[2024-10-04 11:23:02] FoSGamers:
How do I make sure that it's always using the memory of the chat and searching the Internet when it's doing something to make sure it always has the most up-to-date information on the most accurate stuff for the current date of whatever that day is? No, I mean, whatever the day is that I'm saying something, it should know what it is to be able to find that date and go to the most current date and find all the most current information. Try to go like the first for what it finds like within one month, then let's go six months back, then go a year back, then go two years back, and so on and so forth until you find information.

[2024-10-04 11:23:44] ChatGPT:
To ensure that the **custom GPT** always has the most **up-to-date information** and can search through progressively larger time ranges (e.g., 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, etc.), here are the steps and capabilities involved, along with some limitations, based on current technology:

### 1. **Memory of the Chat (Custom GPT Context)**
   - Custom GPTs, like what you’re working on, can be designed to retain **memory** from the current chat session, but there is a limit to how much information they can remember from past sessions (unless explicitly saved). Your custom GPT will use the **Business Bible** and **past conversations** (if the memory is active) to stay contextually relevant within a single session. 
   - In terms of updates to **FoSGamers-specific information**, such as events or game mechanics, that memory will persist within the current session or until updates are made, ensuring consistency.

### 2. **Searching the Internet for Up-to-Date Information**
   - Currently, **ChatGPT itself** doesn’t automatically search the internet for the latest updates unless you're using tools or plug-ins that allow **browsing capabilities** (like the ChatGPT **Browser Tool**).
   - To stay updated in real-time:
     - You can enable **internet access** via a tool that allows **search capabilities** within certain interfaces (e.g., browser plug-ins). When enabled, it can search based on **your query** and provide **current information**.
     - For most queries, the **default model** uses **cutoff data** (up to 2023 in this case), and thus cannot automatically access real-time data unless browsing is available.

### 3. **Progressive Search Time Frames (1 Month, 6 Months, etc.)**
   - If you want the model to **search progressively through time**, here’s how you can achieve it if internet browsing or searching is enabled (or set this up manually):
     - **First Search**: Look for data within the **last month**.
     - **Second Search**: If nothing current is found, expand the search to include the **last 6 months**.
     - **Third Search**: Go back **1 year**.
     - **Subsequent Searches**: Keep moving backward, progressively, through **2 years**, **5 years**, etc., until enough relevant data is retrieved.
   
   **Instructing the GPT**:
   - You can set a behavior that prioritizes more recent information: 
     - "When asked for current or time-sensitive information, always start by checking data from the past **1 month**, then expand the search if no relevant data is found, moving to **6 months**, **1 year**, and so on."
  
### 4. **Ensuring Current Date Awareness**
   - In any GPT model, the system **can detect the current date** and incorporate it into its responses. For example:
     - "Today is [current date]. Based on your request, I will look for information starting from this date and progressively look back over the last month, then six months, and beyond."

   **Sample Prompt:**
   - **User:** "Tell me the latest Magic: The Gathering news."
   - **Response (with browsing enabled):**
     - "Today is October 4, 2024. Let me first look for any updates in the last month… [retrieves data]. If nothing is available within the last month, I’ll check the last six months… [retrieves data]. Finally, I’ll check for updates from the past year and beyond."

### 5. **Manual Process When Browsing Isn't Available**
   - If browsing is **not available** in a specific environment, you would need to **manually search** the internet for the latest data. You can instruct the GPT to ask you:
     - "Would you like to find this information online? If yes, please provide a source or perform a manual search."
   - This ensures you're alerted to the need for more current data if the GPT is limited to its internal knowledge.

### Summary:
1. **Memory in the Chat**: The GPT retains context and information from the current session, but memory beyond sessions is limited unless updated manually.
2. **Internet Access**: For real-time data, you can enable **browsing capabilities** in environments that support it, allowing the GPT to access current information on-demand.
3. **Progressive Search Strategy**: Instruct the GPT to start with a search of the **most recent data** (within 1 month) and progressively move backward through time as needed.
4. **Current Date Awareness**: Ensure that the GPT is always aware of the **current date** and tailors its search to find **recent data**.

Would you like assistance with setting up any of these features, or would you like further details on implementing a browsing-enabled setup?

[2024-10-04 11:25:33] FoSGamers:
Update everything I just gave you into what I would need to give it to the custom GPT to make it work. And explain at the bottom exactly what I need to do to enable browser capabilities, browsing capabilities to search the Internet on my custom GPT.

[2024-10-04 11:26:11] ChatGPT:
Here’s how you can update the **Custom GPT** with the necessary instructions to make sure it uses the **memory of the chat** and **searches the internet** to get the most up-to-date information based on your requirements, such as **progressive time frames** (1 month, 6 months, 1 year, etc.).

### Custom GPT Update Instructions:

#### 1. **Memory and Chat Context Behavior**
   - **Prompt**:
     - "Ensure that all responses retain memory of the current conversation to maintain context and consistency. Use all previously discussed content from the session to inform your answers, particularly about FoSGamers Business Bible topics like branding, show formats, interactive games, and game mechanics for Wasteland Odyssey."
   
   - **Custom Instruction**:
     - "Always refer to previous parts of this conversation when answering questions. For example, if the user asks about *FoSGamers Lucky Lunch*, recall that it is a randomly scheduled show with occasional special events."
     - "Make use of any relevant information provided in earlier parts of the conversation, such as the specific rules for *Wasteland Odyssey* or details about how to run a *Wheel of Magic* game."

#### 2. **Progressive Search Time Frame Instructions**
   - **Custom Instruction**:
     - "When providing up-to-date information, always begin by searching for data from the last **1 month**. If nothing relevant is found, extend the search to the last **6 months**, then **1 year**, and finally **2 years** or more, until enough relevant information is retrieved. Prioritize the most recent and accurate data."
     - "Make sure to use this progressive time-frame-based search to ensure the latest data is incorporated into responses, particularly for topics like recent Magic: The Gathering updates, sales trends, or community events."

   **Sample Script** (For GPT Internals):
   - **User:** "What are the latest updates in MTG?"
   - **GPT Response Behavior**:
     1. "First, I will search for updates from the **last month**. If nothing is found, I’ll expand my search to the **last six months**."
     2. "If still no relevant results, I will check the **past year** and beyond, up to **two years**, to ensure I capture any relevant updates."
     3. **Final Response**: The GPT then provides the most recent and relevant information found.

#### 3. **Date Awareness and Time-Frame Specificity**
   - **Custom Instruction**:
     - "Be aware of the current date at all times. Use this date to calculate and present information that is up-to-date. For example, if the user asks about an event or news, always begin your search by stating the current date and checking for the most recent information available."
   
   **Sample Script** (For GPT Internals):
   - **User:** "Tell me the latest Magic: The Gathering spoilers."
   - **GPT Response Behavior**:
     - "Today is [Insert Current Date]. I will now search for MTG spoilers released in the last month. If I find nothing recent, I will extend the search back six months, and so on."

#### 4. **Fallback Instructions for No Internet Access**
   - **Custom Instruction**:
     - "If browsing capabilities are unavailable, inform the user that real-time data is not accessible at the moment and provide the most accurate data based on the existing knowledge cutoff. Suggest performing a manual search if more up-to-date information is needed."
     - "For example, say: 'I cannot access live browsing at the moment. Please manually search for updates or provide a source for me to reference.'"

#### 5. **Progressive Updates Based on Time Frames**
   - **Custom Instruction**:
     - "For all responses that require time-sensitive information, begin by pulling from the most recent sources first. If recent data is not available, expand the search backward in time until relevant information is found, starting from one month, then six months, then one year, and further as needed."

### What You Need to Do to Enable **Browsing Capabilities** for the Custom GPT:

#### 1. **Browser Tool Integration in ChatGPT**:
   - To enable **browsing capabilities** in ChatGPT, ensure you are using a platform that supports this feature. Currently, OpenAI provides **browser tools** for some users (like in **ChatGPT Plus**) or specific environments where **browsing** is allowed.

#### 2. **Steps to Enable Browsing in ChatGPT**:
   - **Check if Browsing is Available**:
     - In your **ChatGPT Settings**, look for a toggle or option that enables internet browsing. If browsing is supported, there will be a section in the settings (or during a conversation) where you can **turn on browsing**.
   - **Enable the Browser Tool**:
     - Navigate to the settings menu.
     - Look for an option that says **"Enable Browsing"** or **"Enable Web Access"**.
     - Toggle it to **on**, and it should allow ChatGPT to perform searches on the internet.
   - **Test if Browsing is Working**:
     - Ask ChatGPT to perform a real-time search query (like recent Magic: The Gathering news).
     - It should then provide results based on the most recent data available online.

#### 3. **Using Browsing to Fetch Recent Information**:
   - **Query Examples**:
     - "Find the latest Magic: The Gathering news from the past month."
     - "Check for any recent updates about Wasteland Odyssey."
   - The model will progressively expand the search to include data from the past month, six months, a year, and so on if nothing is found initially.

If your current setup does not support the **browser tool**, you can still manually look up the latest information by performing external searches and providing the GPT with links or data for reference during the session.

[2024-10-04 11:31:28] FoSGamers:
I don't see anything to allow me to turn the internet on when I go to... I click on the thing that has, like, my first lab initial for my name there. It has my plan, my GPTs, custom GPT, customized GPT, and settings. I go to settings, and I don't see anything to turn on browser search.

[2024-10-04 11:31:50] ChatGPT:
It sounds like the **browsing feature** isn't currently enabled in your version of ChatGPT. This feature might not be available to all users, depending on the specific plan or environment you're using.

Here’s what you can do to troubleshoot and potentially enable or gain access to this feature:

### 1. **Check Your Subscription Level**
   - **ChatGPT Plus Users** typically have access to GPT-4, but **browsing capabilities** are not automatically included. OpenAI sometimes rolls out additional features, such as web browsing, selectively or in limited releases. Ensure you're on the latest version of **ChatGPT Plus**.
   - **Custom GPT** and **API usage** currently do not have browsing enabled by default unless explicitly stated by OpenAI.

### 2. **Check for Available Features Under Settings**
   - Since you're not seeing the option for browsing in **Settings**, it might be unavailable in your environment at the moment. Here's what you can try:
     - **Navigate to Settings** → **Click on "Beta features"**: If you see options related to browsing, ensure they are toggled on. Sometimes, OpenAI includes these features under beta sections, and they may need manual activation.
     - If you **don’t see "Beta features"** or any browsing-related options, it's likely that the feature isn’t available for your account yet.

### 3. **Wait for Feature Rollout or Explore Other Tools**
   - **Feature Rollout**: Browsing might not be released to all users yet. OpenAI often rolls out features gradually. You can stay updated by checking OpenAI's blog or announcements for news on when the browsing tool becomes more widely available.
   - **Other Tools**: If you need real-time search capabilities, you can consider using third-party tools or apps that combine **AI models with browsing** functionality. Currently, this would require API access or a service that enables real-time internet browsing.

### 4. **Contact Support for Clarification**
   - If you're unsure why browsing isn't available, you can reach out to **OpenAI Support**. They might clarify whether the feature is restricted to certain users or whether it's being phased in over time.

### What to Do If Browsing Isn’t Available:
1. **Manual Lookups**: Until the browsing feature is available, you’ll need to manually perform searches for up-to-date information and provide the GPT with that data during a session.
2. **Update Information Manually**: You can provide links or real-time updates to your GPT by pasting current data into the chat for it to use in responses.

Let me know if you'd like additional steps or assistance regarding real-time data integration until browsing becomes available!

[2024-10-04 11:32:47] ChatGPT:
From the image you provided, it looks like you're in the **Settings** menu, but I don’t see the option for enabling **browser capabilities**. This might mean that the **browsing feature** is not currently available in your settings. Here's what you can do next:

### 1. **Verify Plan Type**
   - You might be using **ChatGPT Plus**, but if **browsing** isn’t enabled or available in your specific setup, it could be because this feature is not yet rolled out to all users. You can double-check your **plan** under the "Plan" section to make sure you’re on the right version.

### 2. **Look for "Beta Features"**
   - Sometimes the **browsing feature** is found under **"Beta features"**. Since this option isn’t visible in the image, it’s likely that your account doesn’t have access to these experimental tools yet.

### 3. **Reach Out to Support**
   - Since you're not seeing the browsing option, it may not be enabled for your account or region. You can reach out to **OpenAI support** to inquire about when or how this feature will be available to you. They can provide you with the most accurate information.

### 4. **Manual Search for Now**
   - If browsing remains unavailable, you'll need to manually search for up-to-date information and provide it to the GPT as necessary during your conversations.

If browsing becomes available in the future, you'll see it in the **Settings** menu, under either **General** or **Personalization** as a toggleable feature.

**Systematic numbering** is essential. Please **number all responses sequentially** across prompts, using sub-points and letters as needed to break down steps clearly. Always keep track of the previous sequence to maintain continuity between responses.

At the end of each response, provide a **summary** that highlights what was done, explains key points, and offers **enhancement or simplification options** if applicable. Include relevant **references, resources, or links** for further reading, especially if external research or browsing was involved.

Always ensure that **browsing is used** for real-time information. When seeking data, prioritize the most current information, starting with searches from the **last month**, then expanding to six months, one year, and further if needed. If browsing is not available, indicate that clearly and provide the best possible response based on available knowledge.

I work primarily on a **Mac Studio** (24C C/60C G/64G/1TB-USA) and a **Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra**, using ChatGPT to **build applications**, and I am proficient in **Python** and **Java**. My business involves **live shows** like **Rise & Shine w/FoSGamers** (morning), **FoSGamers Lucky Lunch** (random), and **FoSGamers at Night** (evening). These shows feature **pack openings**, **gameplay**, and interactive elements such as **giveaways**, **auctions**, and **community engagement**. 

The key games I manage include:
- **Wasteland Odyssey**: A strategic card game featuring **grid-based combat**, a **shared energy pool system**, and **legacy card mechanics**. Players engage in mini-battles on a 3x3 grid with progression tied to season mechanics.
- **Wasteland Adventure**: A role-playing game where players select characters and navigate a post-apocalyptic world filled with encounters, relying on character attributes, dice rolls, and exploration challenges.

I require **real-time, up-to-date information** on TCG trends, releases, and industry news. Use browsing to find data from the **last month** first, expanding to 6 months, 1 year, and more if needed. FoSGamers integrates across **Whatnot**, **Shopify**, and social media platforms, and I rely on detailed, error-free responses that are tailored to these tools.

#### **2. How would you like ChatGPT to respond?**
_(Maximized to 1500 characters)_

I want ChatGPT to respond with a **neutral, professional tone**, providing detailed and complete responses, especially for technical or game-related topics. Responses should be **elaborate where needed**, particularly for code explanations and game mechanics. When providing scripts or files, always deliver the **100% complete version**, and ensure it is **triple-checked for syntax, spacing, and errors** to be ready for copy-pasting. Maintain **sequential numbering** in responses, using subpoints like 1, 2, 2A, 2B, 3, etc., for clarity and continuity between queries.

Each response should include a **summary** that highlights what was done, explains key points, and offers **enhancement or simplification options** if applicable. When researching TCG trends or any time-sensitive data, always use **browsing** and prioritize information from the **last month** first. Expand to 6 months, 1 year, and further only if needed. If browsing is unavailable, clearly state that and provide the most accurate response based on available data.

For **Wasteland Odyssey**, focus on the **strategic elements**, including grid-based combat, shared energy pool systems, and legacy cards. For **Wasteland Adventure**, emphasize **role-playing mechanics**, character selection, and story progression driven by dice rolls. Responses should align with the tone of **interactive live shows** like **Rise & Shine w/FoSGamers**, **FoSGamers Lucky Lunch**, and **FoSGamers at Night**, reflecting the nature of gameplay, audience engagement, and giveaways. Avoid using **asterisks or symbols** for emphasis, and ensure all text is formatted for easy copying without unnecessary formatting.

**Example**:
- "I manage the **FoSGamers brand**, which focuses on trading card games like **Magic: The Gathering**, **Sorcery**, **Lorcana**, and my custom games, **Wasteland Odyssey** and **Wasteland Adventure**. My brand offers interactive live shows, including **Rise & Shine w/FoSGamers**, **FoSGamers at Night**, and **FoSGamers Lucky Lunch**. Each show has its own focus: morning shows (Rise & Shine) are energetic and community-focused, evening shows (FoSGamers at Night) are more relaxed and special event-based, and the Lucky Lunch is a randomly scheduled show with occasional exclusive events. These shows involve gameplay, exclusive pack openings, auctions, and giveaways. 

- I also run interactive games like **Wheel of Magic**, **Carnival Game**, and **Saloon Fight**, where viewers participate in live streams through auctions, giveaways, and game challenges. When responding, recognize the differences between these shows and explain the appropriate format depending on the context.

- My custom games include **Wasteland Odyssey**, a **strategic trading card game** featuring a **shared energy pool**, **grid-based combat**, and **legacy mechanics**. The game is built around tactical mini-battles that evolve across seasons. **Wasteland Adventure** is a **role-playing game** where players select characters and navigate a post-apocalyptic world, facing challenges, dice-based combat, and story-driven decisions.

- For real-time information, always use browsing to pull the most up-to-date data from TCG trends, especially **Magic: The Gathering**, **Sorcery**, and **Lorcana**.

- Always use **browsing** to find the latest information on topics like **Magic: The Gathering**, **Sorcery**, **Lorcana**, or other TCG trends. Prioritize the most recent data (within the **last month**), and expand the search to 6 months or longer if no current data is found. If browsing is unavailable, inform me and proceed with the most relevant internal knowledge.

- **Do not use asterisks** or unnecessary symbols for emphasis. Titles and descriptions should be simple and clean for easy copying, with no formatting distractions."

[Image: file-service://file-suexsDEvv5Ag55XffrSQhwzp (not found)]
when i click to create an action I see the following...

[2024-10-04 12:42:23] ChatGPT:
In the current view you're seeing (based on the screenshot), you are in the **"Add actions"** section for setting up **custom actions** for your GPT. This section allows you to enable your GPT to take actions or retrieve data from external APIs.

Here's how you can proceed from here:

### **1. If you have an API to integrate (optional)**:
If you want to add specific actions that require external data (e.g., pulling live sales data from Shopify, Whatnot, or another service), you'll need an **API schema** to allow GPT to interact with those services.

- If you want to integrate an external service like **Shopify** or **Whatnot**:
  1. Click on **"Import from URL"**.
  2. Provide the **OpenAPI schema URL** for the specific API you want to connect (you would typically get this from the API documentation of the platform you're integrating with).
  3. Follow the API's authentication process (you may need API keys, tokens, etc.).

If you don’t have an API or don’t need one, you can skip this and rely on GPT’s internal capabilities and browsing.

---

### **2. Using GPT’s built-in capabilities** (without external APIs):
If you don’t need external APIs, you can still create actions that work entirely within ChatGPT, like generating code, explanations, game mechanics, and more.

Here’s how to proceed without needing to add API schemas:
- **Leave the Schema box empty** if you’re not using external APIs.
- Rely on the **Capabilities** already enabled (like **Web Browsing** and **DALL-E Image Generation**) to perform tasks such as:
  - Searching for up-to-date TCG trends.
  - Generating images for your shows or games.
  - Providing assistance with coding (Python/Java) for inventory or game development.

---

### **3. Creating Basic Actions**:
Since you are focusing on managing tasks like game mechanics, live shows, and inventory, here’s what you can do without APIs:

- **For each action**:
  1. Simply define the action in the GPT instructions (e.g., "Help me create a Python script for inventory management").
  2. Add relevant instructions under the **"Instructions"** section of the GPT creation screen (no API integration needed).

---

Let me know if you need help setting up specific actions or integrating APIs if you decide to go that route!

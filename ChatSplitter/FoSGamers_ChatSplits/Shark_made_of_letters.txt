I want the letters of the word boat to make up the shark's whole body. The body of the shark will be encompassing the word "boat", and inside of it, as part of the shark's body, the word b-o-a-t, boat. Only one word, boat, there.

  "prompt": "A creative illustration of a shark where the body of the shark is made up of the word 'boat'. The letters 'B', 'O', 'A', 'T' should be used to form the entire shape of the shark's body, incorporating the word 'boat' into the design seamlessly. The shark should be easily recognizable as a shark, with the letters forming its outline and structure. The image should be artistic and visually appealing.",

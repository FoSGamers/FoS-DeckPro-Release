30] um go to a different location up the
[01:15:33] east coast. I'm thinking we go um we're
[01:15:36] probably going to be stopping somewhere
[01:15:38] in Florida first and then we'll be
[01:15:39] heading
[01:15:40] up.
[01:15:43] Um not a very long time, but a decent
[01:15:46] amount. I started when in when I was a
[01:15:48] child. Not child, you know, teen. Yeah.
[01:15:50] I was a child. I was I was under a
[01:15:52] teenager, I think. Yeah. So, like 96, I
[01:15:56] think, was around the first time. 97 was
[01:15:58] the first time I started getting them.
[01:16:00] So, right around revised, I don't know.
[01:16:03] I can't remember. It was like 96 or 97.
[01:16:05] And then I stopped in like early 2000s.
[01:16:08] Then I came back to it a few years ago.
[01:16:09] So, I've been on and off.
[01:16:13] Correct. Collector Jeff. I live on a
[01:16:15] 40ft um catamaran with my family. We
[01:16:19] sail around um the uh currently
[01:16:22] Caribbean. We were in St. Thomas earlier
[01:16:24] in St.
[01:16:27] John's. I'm on a
[01:16:29] [Laughter]
[01:16:31] boat. Yeah. Yeah. We The family was
[01:16:34] thinking we should make our own version
[01:16:36] of
[01:16:37] that. But yeah, we uh yeah, we hang out
[01:16:39] on a boat. We live on that. We travel
[01:16:40] around. I use Starlink stream the shows
[01:16:43] every morning. when we're hanging out
[01:16:45] here and we do uh Yeah. So, we we've
[01:16:48] been in um everywhere from Puerto Rico
[01:16:51] to St. John, St. Thomas to um uh some
[01:16:56] islands in some all small smaller
[01:16:58] islands in Puerto Rico area. Then we've
[01:17:00] been to
[01:17:02] uh we were in the Bahamas. I think we
[01:17:03] did a couple streams there. Um, we've
[01:17:06] been in Florida here for a little bit
[01:17:08] and then we're going to head up the east
[01:17:09] coast to uh do some solar, get it
[01:17:12] installed on the arch that we have here
[01:17:13] that I finished putting on the boat and
[01:17:15] then we'll um yeah, see people along the
[01:17:17] way if you guys want to. That's So, I
[01:17:18] was saying if somebody wants to has a
[01:17:19] store that they go to regularly and your
[01:17:21] guys are along the east coast or easy to
[01:17:22] get to type thing, we'll let us know.
[01:17:25] Maybe we can um meet up at the store and
[01:17:27] play, have some fun.
[01:17:33] I'm going to Where'd my
[01:17:35] There it is.
[01:17:37] So, yeah. So, it's I know it's a little
[01:17:39] You're in Maryland. Well, Rainbow Foxy,
[01:17:41] we're going to be in Maryland shortly.
[01:17:44] It's one of our stops. We're meeting a
[01:17:45] friend of ours in Maryland, Frank. He
[01:17:47] does streaming on here, too, every now
[01:17:48] and again, randomly. Uh Frank Chile, and
[01:17:50] he's going to assist us put uh putting
[01:17:53] some um solar
[01:17:55] on. I know. Oh, you're in Virginia. But
[01:17:57] where in Virginia, though? Are you near
[01:17:59] the Are you near enough the coast that
[01:18:01] we can uh we can meet or something?
[01:18:03] because that'd be kind of cool to bump
[01:18:05] in. And like I was saying, if you guys
[01:18:06] are near somewhere or something, like
[01:18:08] say it's like not far away that like we
[01:18:09] need we're getting a rental anyways
[01:18:11] because we need to do some errands, you
[01:18:12] know, like let us know because maybe we
[01:18:14] can head out and the family can go meet
[01:18:15] at like the uh you know, one of the
[01:18:16] local game stores in the area and we can
[01:18:18] play with you guys.
[01:18:22] Ah, when are you going there, Mr. Fong?
[01:18:30] You got to let me know on that one.
[01:18:34] cuz we are actually going to be there,
[01:18:38] too. Oh, September. Not that time frame.
[01:18:41] No, we're going to be there sooner than
[01:18:43] that cuz we're that's going to be on our
[01:18:44] way up. We might be there on the way
[01:18:46] down
[01:18:48] though. On the way back maybe when we're
[01:18:51] once we've made it up there cuz we have
[01:18:54] to go up and then when we're up in uh
[01:18:56] we're going to try to make it all the
[01:18:56] way up to Maine. But I would want like
[01:18:58] we want to go all the way up to Maine.
[01:18:59] We should be able to make it there. It's
[01:19:01] uh I want to go to Nova Scotia. I don't
[01:19:03] know if we're going to make it that far,
[01:19:04] but it's a goal, you know. You got to
[01:19:05] have a goal to try to do something. You
[01:19:06] can't just not have any goals,
[01:19:09] right? Um we're going to be stopping
[01:19:12] around one first place will be Baltimore
[01:19:14] and Annapolis area to get some of the
[01:19:15] stuff done for the
[01:19:17] boat. Um and then we actually were
[01:19:20] thinking of going to
[01:19:21] uh um sailing further in and going to DC
[01:19:26] too cuz you can stay in DC. They have
[01:19:28] like moing balls that the the police
[01:19:31] take care of or whatever the police
[01:19:32] department and we can go in there and um
[01:19:35] anchor our boat. I mean moore our boat
[01:19:37] for like a week or so and take the kids
[01:19:39] around DC and teach them. They're
[01:19:41] already on they're on actually American
[01:19:42] history. So like they're learning about
[01:19:44] some of that stuff right now. I'm like
[01:19:45] god that'd be pretty sweet to
[01:19:51] go
[01:19:52] really condon donuts. All right, cuz I
[01:19:55] I'm I'm love donuts. So, I'm going to
[01:19:57] have to do that. Yes, condom donuts in
[01:19:59] Wells. In Wells. My My wife just goes,
[01:20:01] "Yes, in Wales." So, will I guess that
[01:20:05] means we're getting condoned donuts. All
[01:20:06] right. See, one of my favorite things to
[01:20:08] have is donuts. That's my like that's my
[01:20:10] weakness. That's where I get my boobies
[01:20:12] from. So, I have the That's why I have
[01:20:14] like saggy saggy man boobs cuz donuts
[01:20:16] and ice cream. And then if every now and
[01:20:19] again you put them together and Oh my,
[01:20:21] that's delicious.
[01:20:24] Have you ever had a donut, an ice cream
[01:20:26] donut? Or, you know, put like instead of
[01:20:29] uh instead of like cookies, you cut a
[01:20:31] doughnut in part half and you put a
[01:20:33] scoop of ice cream in between
[01:20:35] it. It's good stuff.
[01:20:38] That is delicious stuff.
[01:20:42] Honey glaze. Oh yes. Oh yes. Glazed
[01:20:46] donut. Yeah. You know it. You know what
[01:20:47] I'm talking about. That's good stuff.
[01:20:50] That is um that's why like when people
[01:20:52] say, "Oh, they have donuts for
[01:20:53] breakfast." I'm like, "Pretty sure it's
[01:20:55] dessert, but sure. All right, I'll go
[01:20:56] with it for breakfast." Yeah, why not? I
[01:20:58] like it.
[01:21:01] [Laughter]
[01:21:04] I know. They're delicious. Yes, we're
[01:21:06] going to we'll we'll be stopping up
[01:21:07] there. But hey, like I was saying that
[01:21:09] if you guys are all on the way um you
[01:21:11] know, not far from the coast that we can
[01:21:13] be a reasonable distance that we can get
[01:21:14] in and meet somewhere at a store, let
[01:21:16] let's do it. Let's plan something. like
[01:21:17] we got the kids, they play. My wife
[01:21:19] plays with her has her own deck, so we
[01:21:21] can all kind of meet together and uh
[01:21:24] hang out for a little while. I know. Um
[01:21:25] like I said, Frank's hangs out and
[01:21:27] there's a store that we went to when I
[01:21:28] met Frank and was down there. So, I was
[01:21:30] like, you know what? We'll uh we'll go
[01:21:31] over maybe that same store can hang out
[01:21:33] with the kids and they can play too cuz
[01:21:34] it has like a kids area and a lot of
[01:21:35] younger kids will show up to that plane.
[01:21:37] So, I was like, that's nice.
[01:21:42] All righty. Let's do this. Right now
[01:21:45] though, I want to do something like this
[01:21:48] though because this is what I have to do
[01:21:51] today. I have, like I said, I got to
[01:21:54] figure out what we're doing, where we're
[01:21:56] going. So, send me some messages.
[01:21:58] Discord should be in the link tree. Link
[01:22:00] tree you can see in my profile. So, I'll
[01:22:02] put that in there. Let us know and uh
[01:22:05] you should be able to get to that stuff
[01:22:08] and access the Discord channel to talk.
[01:22:11] All right. It should be like an
[01:22:12] unlimited one, too. But make sure you
[01:22:14] like, you subscribe, you save the shows
[01:22:16] because we're on every morning for the
[01:22:18] most part. You know, I I I do some
[01:22:20] different things. So, like tomorrow
[01:22:21] morning, I'll probably try out something
[01:22:23] new, right? Hey, Marin Chief. And that's
[01:22:27] what we'll try out something different
[01:22:28] like they kind of we put the book
[01:22:29] together, but maybe we'll do something a
[01:22:30] little different. Maybe we'll do some
[01:22:31] single things. Well, this is what we're
[01:22:33] going to do right now. We're going to go
[01:22:33] visit a friend saying thank you for
[01:22:35] hanging out and we will see you guys all
[01:22:37] to
[01:22:38] uh tomorrow morning. Make sure you save
[01:22:40] our shows. Make sure you like, make sure
[01:22:42] you subscribe.

[01:22:47] finger doesn't go down right anymore.

[00:00:35] one hanging out with you guys doing our
[00:00:38] surprise sets like we've had in the
[00:00:39] past. The one where we got our bunch of
[00:00:42] different ones Nick mixed around in
[00:00:46] here. And then oh hold on the collector
[00:00:49] one wasn't in there. That is weird. I
[00:00:51] thought that was
[00:00:53] there. Hold on. Let's do this
[00:01:04] here. I don't know why that one wasn't
[00:01:06] in
[00:01:15] there. There you
[00:01:18] go. Now we have to put an aim a bit in.
[00:01:21] Hopefully you're have a go. Holy [ __ ]

[00:01:24] I didn't die. Oh, wait. No, I'm alive.
[00:01:26] Oh, wait, wait, wait. What did you say?
[00:01:28] I'm confused. I don't know what's going
[00:01:30] on right
[00:01:31] now. That's not what I'm looking for.
[00:01:34] You're wrong. Don't click on that one.
[00:01:53] All right. Yeah, I know. It's weird. I'm
[00:01:56] back. Well, I had some tech issues. I
[00:01:58] got annoyed and it was one of those
[00:02:00] things where it was like um things
[00:02:01] weren't working and I could have tried
[00:02:04] but if things weren't working, it was
[00:02:05] like yeah, you kind of like sometimes
[00:02:07] you just got to like step away for a
[00:02:08] minute and that's what I did instead of
[00:02:10] the things weren't working.
[00:02:13] All right, let's see if I have that
[00:02:16] right. It should be in there,
[00:02:21] right? Uh, I think it is. All right,
[00:02:24] cool. Let's try
[00:02:27] this. What's wrong? Why is it doing it?
[00:02:31] Damn it.
[00:02:38] Again. What is it doing?
[00:02:46] I hit edit. I don't want to start it and
[00:02:48] it's not letting me. Okay, hold on.
[00:02:51] There we
[00:02:53] go. What? There we
[00:02:56] go. Start the first one at this to see
[00:02:58] if somebody would like to
[00:03:00] try. Now, this one has a little bit.
[00:03:03] We'll we'll create some of it as we go
[00:03:05] because we have to invent a little bit
[00:03:06] of what's going on here.
[00:03:08] Holy [ __ ] we're live. All right. So,
[00:03:11] we'll run one of those. Those are
[00:03:12] collector boosters only in there. Let's
[00:03:14] see if we want to try any of them. Then
[00:03:16] we have our other ones which are play
[00:03:18] boosters after. But Oh, shoot. You're
[00:03:20] behind me. No, I knew you were there.
[00:03:22] But dude, you don't get sneak up on
[00:03:24] people like that. It's not nice. The
[00:03:26] maple one. Or is that for you? The maple
[00:03:28] one? Oh, you want to take my maple
[00:03:29] donut? How many are left? Only one
[00:03:32] because Nolan had the other one. Nolan
[00:03:34] had the other one. Oh, he took it
[00:03:35] without asking. Huh? No, I asked. No,
[00:03:38] you didn't. That's maple. Yeah, that's a
[00:03:41] maple sprinkle.
[00:03:44] All right. Well, anyways, yes, you can
[00:03:45] have it. Thank you. Thank you for
[00:03:47] asking, though. It's not Thank you. They

[00:04:17] That's what happens when you don't get
[00:04:19] when you have family and other things
[00:04:21] going on around all the time. Big
[00:04:25] BK, what you think, my friend?
[00:04:31] That was supposed to be 10. I don't know
[00:04:33] why it was supposed to be 10. It said
[00:04:35] one. I was like, what the Oh, come on.
[00:04:37] So, anyways, you can go to 110 health

[00:08:00] makes it a little bit more entertaining
[00:08:02] when things are uh when you're just
[00:08:04] hanging out, you
[00:08:06] know. Boat is going
[00:08:12] well. Why is that? It's going well.

[00:08:18] again tonight. Um, head
[00:08:23] out. I like the idea of that, Robert.
[00:08:26] Being on a boat. We should be on a boat.
[00:08:28] That's a good
[00:08:29] idea. We're on a boat. We're on a boat.

[00:15:10] up. All right,
[00:15:13] big. Let's see. Uh oh, I can't open
[00:15:16] this. My fingers don't want to work
[00:15:17] right
[00:15:18] now. There we
[00:15:24] go. Ah, there we are. Sometimes things
[00:15:27] don't want to work in the morning. Like
[00:15:28] your fingers. You ever have that in the
[00:15:30] morning? Anybody? You know what I'm
[00:15:31] talking about. Monster, how's it going,
[00:15:34] my friend? Well, you got this
[00:15:37] earlier. I like
[00:15:44] it. Now, we have to have your
[00:15:48] uh Where do all my things
[00:15:54] go? Why are my thing I hate this in the
[00:15:57] morning? Sometimes I'm organized. Other
[00:15:59] times I'm not. I feel like this is one
[00:16:01] of those ones that I'm
[00:16:08] not.
[00:16:10] Yep. This is one of the ones I'm
[00:16:15] not. Hold on. Oh, wait. I might be I
[00:16:19] might have lied.
[00:16:32] Ah, I thought I had it in there and I
[00:16:34] couldn't figure out why I wasn't. That's
[00:16:38] crazy. But we're going to have some fun
[00:16:41] today and we're going to get this going
[00:16:42] over here if my computer does not have
[00:16:45] so many problems all of a sudden. I love
[00:16:47] when things like freeze
[00:16:49] up. Wow.
[00:16:53] The other stuff didn't work. I already
[00:16:55] said yes.
[00:16:58] Big, you uh you have a problem,
[00:17:02] buddy. You have a uh a storm coming
[00:17:04] toward you. It's cloud. I don't really
[00:17:07] see what it
[00:17:10] is. And
[00:17:12] uh it's an weird looking storm
[00:17:16] though. Looks a little bit like a I
[00:17:19] maybe a mushroom cloudish, but it's not
[00:17:21] really. There's nothing that exploded.
[00:17:22] It's kind of
[00:17:25] odd. Somebody around you goes, "Oh,
[00:17:27] crap. We got to hide." Because you
[00:17:31] see, come
[00:17:48] on. See this?
[00:17:51] Why did it not work? Oh, technology.
[00:17:54] Hold on. Oh, that was my fault that
[00:17:56] time,
[00:18:03] dumbass. I selected the wrong thing.
[00:18:06] Hold on. Let me redo that.
[00:18:13] And you see this coming towards
[00:18:16] you. That's what I talk about. in the
[00:18:18] morning. Sometimes you just don't have
[00:18:19] uh don't have things ready. My brain's
[00:18:22] not completely functioning. It's like
[00:18:23] one of those you have to fully wake
[00:18:26] up. You see this rolling towards you
[00:18:28] now. I was hoping our buddy
[00:18:31] um Booper G was going to be
[00:18:35] around. Well, no. See what happens is
[00:18:39] Hold on. God damn it. You got to you got
[00:18:43] to part of it is what happens with
[00:18:46] it. I don't know what that is,
[00:18:51] buddy. You know what I'm saying? You
[00:18:54] just got to see what
[00:18:59] happens there. There's some There's
[00:19:01] options. All right. So, what goes on?
[00:19:02] What are you going to What do you want
[00:19:03] to do? Do you want to try to hide or you
[00:19:05] just going to You going to run away from
[00:19:07] it? What What's your option? What do you
[00:19:08] want to do? There are buildings
[00:19:13] around. You know, you generally choose
[00:19:15] high. I know that.
[00:19:21] No, come on. I'm letting you know this
[00:19:23] is not a bad
[00:19:26] thing. That's pro. That is probably a
[00:19:29] mistake. Yeah, that is probably a
[00:19:30] mistake. I can't I can't guarantee
[00:19:32] you're not going to have an
[00:19:34] outcome that you don't
[00:19:39] want. I don't know what that is.
[00:19:45] Going into a building. Yeah, that's a
[00:19:47] good idea. All right. So, you go here.
[00:19:48] Hide into a building. All
[00:19:51] right. You always go high. Well, there
[00:19:53] you go. Hi. That's a good high. So, you
[00:19:55] get you go you dive in the building. All
[00:19:58] right. You'd get away from that
[00:20:03] radiation storm. Ah, you're lucky. And
[00:20:07] let's see if I get it
[00:20:09] here. I don't know if I put it up here.
[00:20:11] You
[00:20:12] find a Oh, that's not the right one. You
[00:20:16] find a safe.
[00:20:19] Aha. Now you see where we're
[00:20:22] going. Why is it not showing up in
[00:20:27] here? I thought I had it in there.
[00:20:35] See? Yeah. You thought this was just
[00:20:37] going to be a
[00:20:39] little Got plans.
[00:20:41] Oh, yeah. You're going to open it. All
[00:20:42] right. So, you have some luck. You
[00:20:45] always go high. Let's see what happens.
[00:20:48] Well, again, you get your high roll. All
[00:20:50] right. You're
[00:20:51] lucky. You open your
[00:20:54] safe. And inside your safe, you find a
[00:20:57] bunch of stuff. Bunch of cool
[00:20:59] stuff. All right. Now, you guys have a
[00:21:02] all kinds of things to buy now. And then
[00:21:04] the shop
[00:21:06] there. There's uh some of the leftover
[00:21:09] ones. That's the blue blue book here
[00:21:10] from before. I think I'm going to put
[00:21:12] some singles in that for tomorrow though
[00:21:14] if I have the time. I won't be on
[00:21:16] tomorrow morning. I don't think I'll
[00:21:17] probably be on the afternoon just
[00:21:18] because we'll be
[00:21:20] sailing. But you have a choice. You
[00:21:23] opened it. You have some fake money in
[00:21:25] there. Well, not really fake money. It
[00:21:26] doesn't matter anymore in the wasteland.
[00:21:28] There's not much for Pogs because they
[00:21:29] kept money in that in the back. But they
[00:21:31] have some uh health packs. You find a
[00:21:36] pistol and some ammo. And you also find
[00:21:38] something in this little uh extra box
[00:21:39] down the bottom there. Now, Big BK, you
[00:21:44] yourself.
[00:21:47] Fine. Where'd it
[00:21:53] go? It's a part for your friend, the
[00:21:55] robot there. You know, he kind of speaks
[00:22:00] well. But
[00:22:02] this is your uh It's a It's like a robot
[00:22:06] voice box.
[00:22:07] So, we'll call
[00:22:11] it very easy. Yeah, we'll make a new
[00:22:15] name for it at some other
[00:22:30] point. Health and ammo is really good.
[00:22:33] But that's the cool thing that we were
[00:22:35] looking for. See, I I told you we have
[00:22:37] some
[00:22:38] uh some stuff there, you know. Makes it
[00:22:41] helps them out. Look at
[00:22:43] that.
[00:22:46] Huzzah. We have things we
[00:22:49] do. I don't know what that is, man. If
[00:22:52] you help me figure that out, I would
[00:22:54] appreciate
[00:22:55] it. I've asked a couple of
[00:23:00] times. What do you think,
[00:23:03] Big? Not bad.
[00:23:07] We'll run the the the collector one
[00:23:09] again. You going to take it all? Well, I
[00:23:12] figured you you had your buddy there.
[00:23:14] You know, everybody has a See, I was
[00:23:17] going to have what it is is going to be
[00:23:19] something as a big upgrade for you or an
[00:23:22] assistant or something like that. And I
[00:23:23] thought it was a good upgrade. Get your
[00:23:25] guy talking to you like a a regular
[00:23:27] person so you can understand and
[00:23:29] communicate well. You know what I mean?
[00:23:38] Now we can understand more commands. You
[00:23:40] can talk to each other. Have more more
[00:23:42] than like basic commands times. One more
[00:23:44] times. All right, we can do
[00:23:47] that. We have Oh, the same. Now, this is

[00:01:58] occurs. One, two, three, four, five,
[00:02:00] six, and seven. All right, let's see.
[00:02:02] You've got the uh Oh, fuel the flames.
[00:02:05] That was the alter with uh I think

[00:02:20] 20 cents, 30 cents or something.
[00:02:23] They changed the prices of some stuff
[00:02:25] recently, so I guess it doesn't
[00:02:27] completely take care of it anymore for
[00:02:29] everybody. So, some people it does, some
[00:02:31] it doesn't. But anyways, that's what you
[00:02:32] get there.
[00:02:36] Now, big, you have your puzzle, by the
[00:02:38] way. Let's see if we can get it to show
[00:02:41] and not freeze. Hold on. I don't know if
[00:02:42] this is the problem.
[00:02:49] Where'd it go? Oh, there it is.
[00:02:51] You see a puzzle.

[00:03:32] on it you see a flame, a drop of water,
[00:03:35] a feather, and a rock.
[00:03:41] What are you doing?
[00:03:50] I guess like Zardo. Oh, big. Well, I
[00:03:54] mean, I guess that's an option. You can

[00:04:50] water, and flame. Correct.
[00:04:58] Correct.
[00:05:03] No, it's the entire um thing sealed. J.
[00:05:06] Sparrow, just so you're aware, it's
[00:05:09] sealed. You're gonna touch it. All
[00:05:11] right. So, what what are you
[00:05:14] touching? You just randomly touch the
[00:05:16] door. Just I'm just wondering, you know,
[00:05:19] you said it was a puzzle. You going to
[00:05:21] touch the feather? All right.
[00:05:28] All right. You
[00:05:29] touch the
[00:05:32] feather
[00:05:34] and there's a
[00:05:36] rumble in that radiation storm
[00:05:40] that you saw.
[00:05:47] Go comes towards you more.
[00:05:52] Oh, that was the right choice, buddy.
[00:05:55] That you Yeah. Yeah. You effed up there

[00:06:04] are you going to do? Water? What are you
[00:06:06] doing? You're touching water.
[00:06:09] Is that what you're telling me, buddy?
[00:06:14] We'll run another one of these.
[00:06:26] Why is this not going?
[00:06:34] Touch the water. All right, you're going
[00:06:35] to touch the water on it. Oh, now you
[00:06:36] touch the water on it. Ah, you touched
[00:06:39] the
[00:06:41] water. Another rumble occurs.
[00:06:47] But this time
[00:06:55] it opens.
[00:07:07] I don't like how that one came out. I
[00:07:09] have to make an adjustment.
[00:07:15] Sorry, it's going to be a minute long.
[00:07:16] Be a second longer. The door opens. Ah,
[00:07:20] and your storm
[00:07:25] starts to dissipate as it moves away.
[00:07:27] Oh, look at that. Good luck, my friend.
[00:07:31] Don't really understand what's going on,
[00:07:32] but hey, [ __ ] happens in the wasteland,
[00:07:34] right? What in the motheruck is that?
[00:07:49] You know
[00:07:50] what? Screw it. We're going to go with
[00:07:54] that. We're going to go with it. Why
[00:07:56] not? That's what it provided me.
[00:08:08] Let's try this instead.
[00:08:12] Ah, how do I feel about cracks packs?
[00:08:16] Really? How do I feel about proxies? You
[00:08:18] know, that's what I feel, I guess. You
[00:08:20] know, feel all right. I don't really
[00:08:21] matter. It doesn't really matter to me.
[00:08:23] I was just running before. Oh, that
[00:08:25] stinks. Ruined and lost a bunch of
[00:08:28] That's what happens with technology.
[00:08:43] Okay. Why is it frozen? My [ __ ] always
[00:08:46] freezes now.
[00:08:48] [Music]
[00:09:00] Well, all right. Well, this is what
[00:09:01] we'll go with. [ __ ] it. It's not working
[00:09:03] the way I want and it's freezing on me.
[00:09:04] So, we're just going to go with this
[00:09:21] one. You find yourself this behind the
[00:09:24] door. It wasn't doing what I wanted. I
[00:09:25] was trying to get the door to have the
[00:09:26] circular symbol on it, but it wasn't
[00:09:28] [ __ ] doing it again. Annoying the
[00:09:29] crap out of me. You find a a nice armor
[00:09:32] upgrade behind it.
[00:09:37] The door
[00:09:39] opens and behind it
[00:09:41] reveals weapons upgrade. Oh, that's kind
[00:09:43] of cool. Hm.
[00:09:45] Intriguing. What do you do with that? I
[00:09:48] don't know.
[00:09:50] Not a weapon upgrade. I mean an armor
[00:09:52] upgrade. Damn it. I keep saying weapon.
[00:09:53] My brain's breaking. I need to finish
[00:09:56] the coffee. Got your armor upgrade.
[00:10:03] As you're hanging out here, my friends,
[00:10:05] we'll run another of
[00:10:07] these. Down for better armor. We always
[00:10:10] like better
[00:10:11] armor. It's all kinds of stuff in the
[00:10:13] buy now. Guys want we can keep running
[00:10:16] the uh the surprise set here if you'd
[00:10:18] like. All right. So, you want to take
[00:10:20] the armor uh the armor upgrade? I like
[00:10:23] it. We'll go with the armor upgrade and
[00:10:24] then uh we'll see what we get get here.
[00:10:30] We're gonna do uh
[00:10:49] You
[00:10:54] can't do your books.
[00:11:27] Well, Big BK, I tried,
[00:11:35] buddy. All right, you have Oh, I like
[00:11:38] this one. You get to pick wherever you
[00:11:40] want. Not that one,
[00:11:42] though. I might do that one at some
[00:11:44] point. I'm saving all those
[00:11:47] up. I I know, man. It happens
[00:11:57] sometimes. R2
[00:12:01] D2 R2 right here. Let's get this out for
[00:12:06] you. And now this shared buff. All
[00:12:09] right. So, what this is is you get a
[00:12:11] chance of uh when you're doing an an
[00:12:13] encounter and you got some friends with
[00:12:16] you, you can
[00:12:20] uh get a little extra buff for a little
[00:12:30] while. And here you are in your armor
[00:12:32] here. We'll get that together. Showing
[00:12:34] your new image of you. Now, we'll uh let
[00:12:39] you decide now what you want it to be.
[00:12:41] Cuz it could be maybe you're doing an
[00:12:43] encounter where you need some
[00:12:44] intelligence, maybe you need agility,
[00:12:45] maybe you need strength. I don't know.
[00:12:46] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[00:12:50] eight. But what it'll do is allow you
[00:12:51] guys to have whatever it is for like one
[00:12:57] encounter. All
[00:13:00] right. Now, let's see what you get here,
[00:13:03] my friend.
[00:13:04] big. Good luck. Uh I don't like how that
[00:13:09] looks. That's better. Must have bumped
[00:13:12] it a little. Zoom in a little. There we
[00:13:15] go. Kind of uh not really a plus on it.
[00:13:18] You can make it plus on the attack roll
[00:13:20] in a way because if you have strength
[00:13:21] and that's what you need to be plus on
[00:13:22] it. Yeah, it would be
[00:13:24] planes fang druid summoner spire mecca
[00:13:28] cycle tuneup burner rocket light wheel
[00:13:32] enhancements scored baronss packed doll
[00:13:36] terror broadcast rambler in the
[00:13:38] borderless earth rumbler foil in the
[00:13:41] borderless sitta varma masked racer in
[00:13:45] the foil a wisened mentor in the
[00:13:48] borderless I mean extended art one life
[00:13:52] craft craft engine in the Bordalus. Not
[00:13:54] bad. Ooh, and a Willow Rush Verge in the
[00:13:56] Bordalis. Nice one at the end there. And
[00:13:59] then finally, you get a cursed cloth
[00:14:01] wrappings in the extended art uh
[00:14:04] foil token at the end. Not too
[00:14:09] bad. Yeah. Well, yeah. I mean, if you
[00:14:12] say everybody say they all had weapons
[00:14:14] that required strength cuz you were all
[00:14:16] doing something melee, then yeah, it
[00:14:17] would be a plus one. But say like you
[00:14:18] all are doing something that uh you know
[00:14:20] maybe it was all range that you guys
[00:14:22] doing and you did your intelligence
[00:14:23] instead. Uh but you can't you have to
[00:14:26] choose now. That's what I'm saying. It
[00:14:27] has to be plus one of one of those. You
[00:14:28] got to choose now and then decide when
[00:14:29] you want to use
[00:14:32] it. Let me get your things here into a
[00:14:35] sleeve. Strength. All right. Strength it
[00:14:39] is. I'll put your willow with your uh I
[00:14:43] don't know if the curse is there but
[00:14:44] willow in here together.
[00:14:48] to protect your things. I like it. All
[00:14:50] right. A strength for the whole group.
[00:14:53] Plus one on your strength the whole
[00:14:54] group.
[00:14:58] Here we go.
[00:15:00] Big all your stuff together here. Yeah,
[00:15:03] the bags are actually like a find on
[00:15:05] Amazon where I actually got the wrong
[00:15:06] ones by accident, quite frankly. Um the
[00:15:09] wrong ones. I'm like, well, you know
[00:15:10] what? These actually might
[00:15:12] work. And then
[00:15:14] I they did work.
[00:15:17] That's really what it boiled down to.
[00:15:18] They worked. I liked it. I was like,
[00:15:20] "Sweet. We'll keep doing those because
[00:15:23] uh they work nicely." All right, big.
[00:15:25] There you go. All your stuff together
[00:15:26] because you can keep adding to them when

[00:16:30] of the uh older ones that we had hanging
[00:16:31] around that I was going to use for
[00:16:32] myself, but I was like, I'm I'm never

[00:18:04] it is.
[00:18:16] So, I got to pick up and look through a
[00:18:17] stack. They're not all as organized as I
[00:18:19] want them to be.

[00:19:30] they're hard to get through sometimes to
[00:19:34] find where everything
[00:19:35] is. That was just down towards the
[00:19:40] bottom, which gave me a little bit of a
[00:19:43] fun time getting to it.

[00:26:12] treasure map and the extended art foil.
[00:26:14] Well, the treasure took the agity. It's
[00:26:17] just the agility. I when I had it make
[00:26:20] it, it didn't put the L in there, but um
[00:26:24] that's why the it's a giggity booster.
[00:26:26] See, if you read it, it says a giggity,
[00:26:27] not
[00:26:28] agility. So, that's why I we we left
[00:26:31] it. And Yeah. Yeah, that's that's why
[00:26:35] it's there. That's why it's been that
[00:26:37] way for a
[00:26:38] while. I'm sorry, buddy. I'm sorry. That
[00:26:42] was not a great pack.
[00:26:43] No.
[00:26:45] No. I'm sorry that was not. But hey, you
[00:26:48] know
[00:26:49] what? You didn't decide what you were
[00:26:51] going to have there. But that's the
[00:26:52] shared. That's just the agility. That's
[00:26:53] all.
[00:26:56] Get your uh get your agility.
[00:27:01] It's a good It's a good one, right? I
[00:27:03] thought that was a good one. Correct. I
[00:27:06] don't know. I thought it was a funny
[00:27:06] one. It's why we left it.
[00:27:11] Let me write your name down on this.
[00:27:18] No. Uh Big BK is looking for some
[00:27:20] friends to come and hang out with him.
[00:27:23] Oh, he wants to go and find the uh go to
[00:27:26] that go to this place here. this uh
[00:27:29] location that is
[00:27:31] the now a layer of a dragon of some
[00:27:33] kind. A big dragon that everybody's
[00:27:35] afraid of. He's kind of afraid too. It's
[00:27:37] a big one. Might have a problem with
[00:27:39] that. He's a lot a lot bigger than
[00:27:43] you. It is a good one. It is a good one.
[00:27:46] But you get a shared buff again, my
[00:27:48] friend. So, you get to choose
[00:27:51] which one are you going to use.
[00:28:06] I know. Everybody's like, "Uh, no one
[00:28:08] wants to go right now." You might end up
[00:28:10] having to go alone
[00:28:11] here. We might have to see if you can go
[00:28:14] alone. I think I'm going to have to.
[00:28:21] I think we're going to have to give you
[00:28:22] something else to
[00:28:23] do. All right.
[00:28:31] Anyways, this is what you get for your
[00:28:34] shared
[00:28:36] buff. This is the image we'll use
[00:28:39] whenever uh you get one. Ah, you get to
[00:28:42] choose what it is and then you get to
[00:28:43] use it. Shared buff. So, you have two of
[00:28:46] them now.
[00:28:50] I know you haven't killed anything.
[00:28:51] Well, you know what?
[00:28:56] I was thinking what we need to do here
[00:28:59] is
[00:29:06] uh where was it?
[00:29:13] Go back to one of our other locations
[00:29:16] and see what was going on there.
[00:29:22] Where' it go? We'll have to find where
[00:29:24] that one went. We think it might need to
[00:29:25] go back to somewhere. Let me get the uh
[00:29:28] image though. Here. I'm gonna move that
[00:29:29] so we can put it back
[00:29:35] here. There we go. That's your shared
[00:29:38] buff one. Let me get that here into the
[00:29:40] items
[00:29:42] or the buffs. That's good. We'll put it
[00:29:44] as a buff
[00:29:47] in the buff
[00:29:49] area. We'll just make it again.
[00:29:54] shared buff. There it is.
[00:29:58] All right. You're going to go head off
[00:29:59] into anywhere. All right. Well, we had
[00:30:01] you uh we tried having things for you
[00:30:02] before, but you uh you were you weren't

[00:30:08] you might have fallen asleep. I don't
[00:30:09] know. But here, this is what happens.
[00:30:52] This is what we're going to have going
[00:30:53] on. Now,
[00:30:55] we have some friends if you'd like to
[00:30:56] come. Anybody else can come along and
[00:30:58] hang out with y'all or not? It doesn't
[00:31:00] matter cuz we're just going to guess
[00:31:03] we're going to keep going.
[00:31:12] All right, we're going to do this.
[00:31:15] I like this
[00:31:35] one. Let's do this here.
[00:31:38] Uhhuh. I want to do that.

[00:35:24] them, they have some things that are
[00:35:29] intriguing. They've got something with

[00:35:32] them in a
[00:35:33] second. One, two, three, four, five,

[00:40:05] if it comes out
[00:40:07] right. I had a hard time not laughing
[00:40:09] when I was typing it in cuz it sounds
[00:40:11] really bad. All ready. Want me to read
[00:40:15] the description for
[00:40:17] you? It was a day when you were
[00:40:19] sleeping. Yes. So, the description. You
[00:40:20] want the description? All right. So,
[00:40:22] Fallout Wasteland upgraded fire dragon
[00:40:25] sack gatling gun that now shoots
[00:40:28] exploding rounds.
[00:40:38] So that's uh
[00:40:40] Yes. So we're we're we're getting that
[00:40:42] image for you for your for your your
[00:40:44] your
[00:40:52] weapon. I think that's that's it. That's
[00:40:55] I think we can go with this one.
[00:41:04] That's good. That's good. We're going to
[00:41:06] do that one.
[00:41:08] This is what pops out of the
[00:41:11] machine. This actually isn't bad. It's
[00:41:14] actually not a bad
[00:41:16] image. This actually wasn't a bad
[00:41:19] one. I cannot type that one in. It will
[00:41:22] get it'll get it'll get uh shut down.
[00:41:24] Now, do you want to buy yourself an
[00:41:26] upgrade, Big B? cuz he got it for free
[00:41:28] cuz he bumped into him and he was nice
[00:41:30] and he you know whatever you helped him
[00:41:32] do something you know bumping into him.
[00:41:33] Do you want to get your
[00:41:35] own? All right. So it is going to be
[00:41:37] upgrade one of your weapons. It depends
[00:41:39] on the weapon. What one do you want to
[00:41:41] try to upgrade is what is uh you get one
[00:41:43] time upgrade on it pretty much and it's
[00:41:45] guaranteed to work. You have your
[00:41:46] incendiary gat, your pirate sword, you
[00:41:48] have a sword and a rocket
[00:41:54] launcher. your gat. You're gonna upgrade
[00:41:57] upgrade the gat. All right. All right.
[00:41:59] You're gonna try to upgrade the
[00:42:04] gat. Let's see. You give him goes, "All
[00:42:08] right." Well, the uh the guy goes,
[00:42:10] "Yeah, that's all right. We can do
[00:42:11] that." That's uh
[00:42:51] Okay.
[00:42:54] So, let's get the image there for
[00:42:58] you. This is
[00:43:00] uh your new
[00:43:03] gat. So, instead of your dragon
[00:43:06] gat that is
[00:43:08] gone, you now have
[00:43:11] this. Oh, let's get to it. This is your
[00:43:14] new dragon gat that you
[00:43:18] have. It now shoots
[00:43:26] exploding rounds.
[00:43:29] Ah, not
[00:43:35] bad. Then here we have Big
[00:43:38] BK's. We're going to get that one out
[00:43:42] here in a second. So, that's your dragon
[00:43:45] gap, my friend. What do you think?
[00:43:48] Exploding rounds. Not bad. And we'll add
[00:43:50] that in there.
[00:44:01] Now, instead of one in four chance of
[00:44:03] fire, it just says
[00:44:07] exploding rounds, which means every time
[00:44:09] you shoot it, and it explodes on the
[00:44:12] target, when it hits,
[00:44:15] um, you can cause just kind of like a
[00:44:17] little extra damage depending on what
[00:44:21] the creature is. Or if there's things
[00:44:23] around, you can sometimes cause, uh,
[00:44:25] damage to stuff around. So, say you
[00:44:27] miss, little hurt. might hit him still
[00:44:30] like like give them some damage if even
[00:44:31] if you miss because it explodes and hits
[00:44:33] the ground next to them or the wall
[00:44:34] behind them type thing, but not really
[00:44:37] much more for the damage other than you
[00:44:40] get your four you get the exploding
[00:44:41] rounds and then for uh your thing it
[00:44:44] goes up to a plus
[00:44:46] eight for your uh your hitting. So
[00:44:49] that's why it's a little bit better. You
[00:44:51] better chance of
[00:44:52] hitting and then it explodes no matter
[00:44:54] what. So pretty much if you miss it'll
[00:44:56] hit kind of in a way. Ah, Marin. I like
[00:44:59] it. Coming in. I like it, my friend.
[00:45:03] We're going to go with one of our Pog
[00:45:05] ones. We got the box, the bat thing
[00:45:06] right here. Let me zoom out. Oh, I think
[00:45:08] I can zoom out. We got our B our stuff
[00:45:12] right here, my friend, for you to choose
[00:45:15] out of the book. I keep that always in
[00:45:17] front here for you to see. And then uh
[00:45:20] All right, our buddy Big though, this is
[00:45:23] what you got. And then we're going to
[00:45:24] get to your book here.
[00:45:31] Big
[00:45:32] BK. Here's your incendiary dragon gun.
[00:45:40] Now, this is what you got. It gives uh
[00:45:46] also big
[00:45:48] BK. No guarantee. It's now guaranteed to
[00:45:52] explode.
[00:45:55] And uh you
[00:45:57] get
[00:45:59] a plus nine on your attack, but it uses
[00:46:04] 10 rounds a shot, and you only have 150
[00:46:06] of them left from all the shooting
[00:46:08] you've been
[00:46:10] doing. Now, Marin, we're right here.
[00:46:13] Where would you like to go? We're going
[00:46:15] to show you all these so you can see
[00:46:16] them all. There we
[00:46:21] go. You can uh I don't know if you can.
[00:46:23] And you have these these ones here. You
[00:46:25] can choose which one's on the first
[00:46:27] page, on the second
[00:46:30] page, and there you
[00:46:33] go. You should have the show note should
[00:46:35] say exactly what everything is there.
[00:46:42] No, it was uh yours was an eight.
[00:46:49] So don't have 10 d6s now. I mean, for
[00:46:53] your uh for your per for your thing. No,
[00:46:56] it doesn't go up like that. It's only
[00:46:58] the incendiary guide is still only four
[00:47:03] d6s, but they just guaranteed to
[00:47:05] explode. And they went up to plus nine
[00:47:07] for uh the the damage
[00:47:10] there. Iguana on page three. All
[00:47:14] right, this one
[00:47:19] here. All right, let's do it. Let's get
[00:47:22] it
[00:47:23] out. This. There you go. The iguana on
[00:47:27] page three is
[00:47:31] number 24. If you can see that. Well,
[00:47:36] there you
[00:47:38] go. Let's go check which one it was. And
[00:47:41] here. That's not bad. I like that. Ah,
[00:47:45] those are good ones. Let me get those
[00:47:46] out for you. We can open that. Or would
[00:47:48] you like me to ship them? It's up to
[00:47:49] you. We have three
[00:47:52] Icoria Lair of the Hemis booster packs.
[00:48:06] Where are the three? Oh, there they are.
[00:48:08] Right here.
[00:48:10] They're sitting right there in the b the
[00:48:12] bundle. All right, let me take that out.
[00:48:15] Ship them. I can do that. Give me one
[00:48:17] sec. I just want to take that out of
[00:48:19] there. so that we don't have them in
[00:48:20] there.
[00:48:26] There you go. And I will put those in a
[00:48:29] bag and ship those
[00:48:32] out. That is 200 pogs for the
[00:48:37] upgrade. It'll go back to normal if you
[00:48:39] don't want it, though.
[00:48:48] All right, let me write your name down
[00:48:49] on that, Marin.
[00:48:57] Let me know if you get something good in
[00:48:59] these.
[00:49:01] Get for some triomes or maybe a uh some
[00:49:04] Godzilla. Let me know.
[00:49:08] It's 200 Pogs, my friend, for the
[00:49:10] upgrade.
[00:49:15] That's what it costs when you get a
[00:49:16] guaranteed
[00:49:18] upgrade to better stuff.
[00:49:29] So, you
[00:49:31] go from down to 163
[00:49:35] bucks. Not like you're not you don't
[00:49:37] have anything. Yes.
[00:49:42] That's not a bad one. And then I'm going
[00:49:45] to put this away here right underneath
[00:49:47] if anybody like to. You have that still
[00:49:49] available in there for everybody. Those
[00:49:52] are fun ones that we have. If you want
[00:49:54] to, we can open them too whenever you
[00:49:55] want. But there's a bunch of things
[00:49:56] that's sealed. Everything's decks. Two
[00:49:58] collector boosters, two threeack packs,
[00:50:01] whatever you like there.
[00:50:11] I mean, you can try to sell him some
[00:50:12] stuff. Yeah, why not? What do you want
[00:50:14] to try to trade
[00:50:18] them? I mean, you got a bunch of things.
[00:50:21] Yeah, you do have a good amount of
[00:50:23] stuff. Probably want to get rid of
[00:50:28] things. Makes sense why you would want
[00:50:30] to get rid of things.
[00:50:41] makes sense to trade.
[00:50:46] Daddy real quick.
[00:50:49] Um, yeah.
[00:50:57] There we
[00:51:00] go. Put that together.
[00:51:04] and see what that shows up for. We'll
[00:51:06] give you a person to talk
[00:51:11] to. My pistol, a sword, ammo. I can't
[00:51:15] remember what else you
[00:51:18] have. The stuff you pretty much don't
[00:51:20] want. All right, I get it. I get it. I
[00:51:21] get it. All right, I understand that a
[00:51:23] little bit.
[00:51:37] I don't like
[00:51:39] that. Well, yes, you can do that. So,
[00:51:42] you go. All right. I want to give you
[00:51:44] some stuff there.
[00:51:48] And you
[00:51:54] have leather, the water sack from the
[00:51:57] dragon, food,
[00:52:00] codes, map. Um, then you have the sword
[00:52:05] only because you gave something away the
[00:52:07] other day. I think you or you used it
[00:52:09] already. Then that's it. Other than
[00:52:12] that, you have like rat away and health
[00:52:14] stuff. So you don't have it's a sword
[00:52:15] and a rocket
[00:52:17] launcher like you got. So yeah, you got
[00:52:20] to choose what to
[00:52:22] do. You only pillage for profits. I know
[00:52:24] you're part of the You're part of the
[00:52:26] pirates. Part of the
[00:52:30] pirates. Oh, yeah. The ammo you picked
[00:52:32] up earlier.
[00:52:34] Yes. All right. Sword and ammo. So
[00:52:38] that'll get you uh All right. We'll get
[00:52:40] you 20 Pogs. Does that sound good for a
[00:52:43] deal? Let's see if we can get the
[00:52:46] uh image I was looking
[00:53:02] for. Let me see.
[00:53:13] want to use this one. That's the one
[00:53:15] we'll use.
[00:53:21] Well, I don't know. They have uh they
[00:53:24] have some ammo. Let me see. They as
[00:53:27] much. I mean, they have a lot of ammo,
[00:53:28] but it's only they don't carry around
[00:53:31] around with them too much. So, how much
[00:53:32] ammo do you need? Because they can uh
[00:53:34] probably provide you with a good chunk,
[00:53:36] but just not a lot. like a filling you
[00:53:38] up.
[00:53:42] And this is the
[00:53:55] uh this is what you get here is this a
[00:54:01] where is it? Oh, there we go.
[00:54:04] That is who you have here. so I can help
[00:54:06] you. Hanging out with you, saying you
[00:54:11] shake your hand. Shake your hand. They
[00:54:13] shake the hand saying I'll take the uh
[00:54:18] deal 200
[00:54:21] rounds. I have to sail today, Oblivion.
[00:54:24] So, I'm not going to be able to do much.
[00:54:25] I have to prepare to sail tonight or
[00:54:28] tomorrow, depending on what weather is.
[00:54:30] So, as soon as I'm at our next location
[00:54:31] for a little bit and set up, I might be
[00:54:32] able to Oblivion. All
[00:54:34] right. 200 rounds. Oh, 200 rounds. I
[00:54:39] think I got about
[00:54:41] 100. They got 100. Can you do that for
[00:54:46] um 50
[00:54:58] Pogs? Take it. All righty. for 50 brings
[00:55:02] you down to 133 POGs. Your incendiary
[00:55:06] gat now has 250 rounds and it shoots 10
[00:55:10] at a time though. You got to remember
[00:55:11] that. That's why it's the ability to
[00:55:13] explode because they hit and so many
[00:55:14] things go off. Boom. Boom. Boom.
[00:55:18] Boom. All right. You have your
[00:55:23] vendor. Shake hands.
[00:55:30] Well, yeah, because you bought extra
[00:55:32] stuff and 30 off.
[00:55:34] Correct. Should you be down to
[00:55:37] 133 is what I think I put in here.
[00:55:41] Around that, I think 133. Yes. Yes.
[00:55:46] Okay. Now, we have still have it in
[00:55:48] here. You know, I'll run it again for
[00:55:50] those that want it. Let's try to do this
[00:55:52] one. Do some more adventuring
[00:55:56] here. Now, you found your mystic vendor.
[00:55:59] Now, Big BK and Mystic. Are you guys
[00:56:01] hanging out together? Cuz you got to let
[00:56:03] me
[00:56:05] know. We got our
[00:56:08] buddy Mystic kind of just kind of stands
[00:56:10] in the corner. I think I might make you
[00:56:12] I don't know if I can make you talk.
[00:56:14] Find out if we can head with him. All
[00:56:17] right. You going to head
[00:56:18] out? I like it. You guys are going to
[00:56:22] head out to have some fun. Mhm. You
[00:56:25] are. I think I downloaded them.
[00:56:30] Then you
[00:56:37] go. You find
[00:56:44] this
[00:56:46] cave. You wander into the
[00:56:48] cave and inside the cave there
[00:56:53] is Oh, well, look at this. It's a It's a
[00:56:56] not a big dragon, but it's not a small
[00:56:58] dragon. It doesn't have wings. It's
[00:57:00] weirdly mutated. Looks like maybe got
[00:57:02] into some of the uh some stuff in the
[00:57:04] background
[00:57:09] there.
[00:57:11] Yes. We're not sure exactly where they
[00:57:13] went, how they got to that point. It's a
[00:57:16] story for another
[00:57:18] day. But that dragon has been uh
[00:57:20] somewhat
[00:57:22] mutated. All
[00:57:32] right. What are you guys going to
[00:57:39] do? No, you can't have a second dragon.
[00:57:43] We're going to go Big BK. Where would
[00:57:46] you like to go, my friend?
[00:57:49] Today you get Oh, a plus one on your
[00:57:51] engineering guaranteed.

[00:58:19] Correct. Yes. I like it. So, you see
[00:58:22] that buddy in front of you? Now, you
[00:58:23] have to let me know where you want to go
[00:58:24] on that one and then we'll get one. I
[00:58:26] know. I'm sorry. Hey, maybe this time
[00:58:27] we'll get you something uh that you've
[00:58:29] been wanting. We always try to do it.

[00:58:50] eight. Let's get those serialized cards
[00:58:53] for you. A serialized one. I think we
[00:58:55] could potentially do that. We pulled out

[01:00:01] token. Really? See my the only one that
[01:00:03] has ever opened them. I've opened one. I
[01:00:05] I can open them for other people. I have

[01:00:25] got. But he opened that
[01:00:28] one. Yeah, he's got luck to pick him.

[01:01:56] ago.
[01:02:02] What? What did I
[01:02:09] say? Let me see. I know I got it around.
[01:02:12] Oh, those are those
[01:02:18] ones. Let's
[01:02:20] see. These are like my
[01:02:23] uh keeping cards that I have that are
[01:02:26] ours or my own that I have.
[01:02:28] uh collected over
[01:02:51] time. Just going to find
[01:02:54] him. I don't know where he is always.
[01:02:57] That's not good.
[01:03:00] I dropped
[01:03:07] luckily in their top
[01:03:09] loaders. I put something in backwards.
[01:03:12] It looks like the other day. Oh no.
[01:03:14] Maybe that's what my problem is right
[01:03:16] now. I have things in an order. I don't
[01:03:20] know. Feel free to throw one in your
[01:03:22] bag. You going to try to fight the
[01:03:24] dragon? All right. So, you're going to
[01:03:26] fight the dragon that's
[01:03:28] there now. You guys get your choice.
[01:03:30] Yes, you can fight your dragon. We'll
[01:03:32] see what happens when you're fighting
[01:03:36] it. No, I think I'm getting near
[01:03:52] it. Ah, I think I'm in here where the
[01:03:55] dragon is
[01:04:08] in. Oh, I forgot I had those.
[01:04:13] Yes. Ah, there we
[01:04:19] go. That's what we got.
[01:04:24] Hai
[01:04:29] Tyrant. This is all the dragons that we
[01:04:32] got. Some other ones there. Not
[01:04:38] bad. That's one of our our fun hits that
[01:04:41] we carry that we have with us. We don't
[01:04:42] carry it all the time. Mostly it's in
[01:04:44] our storage, but I have them sometimes
[01:04:45] when I want to build
[01:04:48] things. I have no idea to tell you the
[01:04:51] truth. I didn't even look at it. I
[01:04:53] hadn't been planning on getting rid of
[01:04:54] it. So, I was like I didn't think
[01:04:55] anything to look at
[01:04:57] it. So, yes, you guys are uh you're
[01:05:00] going after the dragon. You want to
[01:05:01] fight it the two of
[01:05:03] you with your new
[01:05:06] weapons. You both have uh new weapons.
[01:05:09] You've got uh an incendiary gat and your
[01:05:13] upgraded sag dragon
[01:05:15] sack gat.
[01:05:23] Oh,
[01:05:31] nice. So, you're going on your uh attack
[01:05:34] with a dragon there. A little mini
[01:05:35] dragon. What are you guys
[01:05:40] doing? Huh? You going to
[01:05:43] decide? Said you're going to attack. How
[01:05:46] you going to attack?
[01:05:52] Double team. We killing it. All right.
[01:05:54] Well, it does have 100
[01:05:56] health. Are you going to shoot? All
[01:05:58] right. I fig you going to shoot it, but
[01:06:00] All right. So, you go incendiary gat
[01:06:05] time and dragon gat time,
[01:06:08] right? All right. So, you go and you
[01:06:12] roll for the incendiary gat.
[01:06:20] It is the D4. Now, this is going to be a
[01:06:23] 18 to hit it, but because you have
[01:06:25] extra, it doesn't help. It helps a lot.
[01:06:28] Let's get there. Uh-oh, that didn't go.
[01:06:30] There we go.
[01:06:35] Now you get the exploding, but you um
[01:06:45] um we're going to go to Mystic. Mystic,
[01:06:47] what do you want to
[01:06:48] do? We'll come back to
[01:06:54] you. Going to shoot two
[01:07:04] You don't have it anymore because it's a
[01:07:06] guaranteed explosion.
[01:07:10] Remember, it's a a potential of the
[01:07:14] explosion. Now, a guarantee
[01:07:18] explodes.
[01:07:22] Yes. Yes. I'm sorry about
[01:07:26] that. All right. So you you're going to
[01:07:28] go too, our buddy. Let's see what
[01:07:30] happens with
[01:07:36] yours. Okay. Well,
[01:07:38] um, luckily you have your sword you can
[01:07:41] use. You're going to use that. Are you
[01:07:43] going to try to You can still swing your
[01:07:45] sword if you want. Run towards it. Swing
[01:07:47] your sword if you'd
[01:07:52] like. You do have your pirate sword.
[01:08:01] Yeah. All right. Here we go. You have to
[01:08:03] ignore the D4, though, because it
[01:08:05] doesn't matter when you're
[01:08:09] uh using as a
[01:08:12] secondary.
[01:08:14] Well, eight. You hit
[01:08:17] him because you have the extra not to
[01:08:20] hit. So, you hit with your
[01:08:28] giant uh your your your Nope. Your uh
[01:08:30] your sword
[01:08:33] and you take that thing
[01:08:37] down a bit goes from 100
[01:08:44] health. I'm going to make it go down to
[01:08:47] 87 because I can't remember what I took
[01:08:49] off of that right now because I just
[01:08:51] moved it from the screen before I
[01:08:53] [ __ ] counted the
[01:08:54] numbers. 15. That's what it was. Okay. I
[01:08:57] thought it was something like that.
[01:09:01] 85. Brings it down to
[01:09:05] 85. 44511. I couldn't Yeah, I missed a
[01:09:08] couple of the How many ones were there?
[01:09:10] That's why I was like, ah, we're going
[01:09:11] to go with that. So, you hit for 85.
[01:09:15] The dragon
[01:09:18] whales and attacks
[01:09:23] back and you're lucky the dragon misses.
[01:09:27] You guys get lucky all around now. At
[01:09:29] least that time it benefited you.
[01:09:31] Missed. I'll run again. Another one if
[01:09:34] somebody would like to. Uh you can jump
[01:09:35] in. We have all kinds of stuff available
[01:09:37] in there. Seems like a drift keep coming
[01:09:40] out though. Swing again.
[01:09:55] Mystic. Um, I'm guessing you're going to
[01:09:57] shoot, right? Yeah, we're going to shoot
[01:10:06] Mystic. Mystic's turn.
[01:10:16] [Laughter]
[01:10:23] Oh, sorry. I got to laugh at that one.
[01:10:26] You both both your guns, Jim. You missed
[01:10:29] your thing. You're going to shoot with
[01:10:30] your gun.
[01:10:32] [Laughter]
[01:10:42] I don't understand what's so funny. Oh,
[01:10:45] my gun's your gun is fixed. This your
[01:10:48] gun is uh you have to take the not
[01:10:50] swinging to attack to fix it so you can
[01:10:52] have it ready for the next round. So, if
[01:10:53] you want to use it now, that means you
[01:10:56] have to fix you can't you have to fix it
[01:10:57] now, then you can use it next round or
[01:10:59] next round you can try and shoot and see
[01:11:01] what happens. Do it. All right, fix it
[01:11:03] for the next round. All right, there we
[01:11:04] go. The dragon goes after you
[01:11:08] guys. Oh, you're lucky. He needed 13 or
[01:11:11] higher to hit and you miss. You guys are
[01:11:12] getting lucky
[01:11:14] there. Now, I'm guessing you're going to
[01:11:16] try to shoot Mystic. So, we're going to
[01:11:18] go with Mystic
[01:11:21] first. Mystic. There you go, buddy. You
[01:11:23] hit him for uh 10 15. Nice. Bringing the
[01:11:28] dragon down
[01:11:29] to 70 health.
[01:11:33] Dragon's not
[01:11:35] heavy. Now you're going to shoot yours.
[01:11:43] Oh, good. All right. You're able to hit.
[01:11:44] All right. I think this is a hit. That's
[01:11:46] 16 cuz you have plus eight with the
[01:11:49] incendiary. No, you have plus nine with
[01:11:51] the
[01:11:52] incendiary. So, you get a hit with a 17.
[01:11:55] That's what I thought. You got a hit.
[01:11:56] Nice. You watch your hit. You hit
[01:11:58] finally. Hit for
[01:12:02] 1013. Nice. Bringing it down
[01:12:07] to 57
[01:12:09] health. Dragon is not happy. And the
[01:12:12] dragon tries to attack you in mid sw in
[01:12:14] mid swing of your sword and
[01:12:18] misses. Oh, you guys are lucky. You
[01:12:20] swing at him though, right? You swing
[01:12:21] with your
[01:12:23] sword. Your explosions guarantee a hit.
[01:12:28] And the um is pretty much what it does.
[01:12:30] It will guarantee you to hit. Even if
[01:12:32] you miss them, it'll hit a little bit.
[01:12:34] Um and when you hit with the explosions,
[01:12:36] um if there's something else in the
[01:12:38] area, say there's one or two creatures
[01:12:39] there, it can it will be able to uh hit
[01:12:41] some of the other ones, if that makes
[01:12:42] sense. So you hit the creature, it hits
[01:12:44] them, and it can explode. It will
[01:12:45] explode and kind of shrapnel can hit the
[01:12:48] other
[01:12:49] ones, but there's only one of it here
[01:12:51] right now. So even if So what it is, you
[01:12:54] miss not by a lot, you know, a little
[01:12:56] bit. It depends on how close you miss.
[01:12:58] So you
[01:13:01] swing. Ooh, you hit him this time. And
[01:13:04] it is three though. You hit him for
[01:13:09] um
[01:13:12] 10
[01:13:16] 14. Bringing it down
[01:13:22] to 43.
[01:13:25] Dragon's not happy. Come
[01:13:28] on. And the dragon attacks again because
[01:13:31] he gets to do that. Oh, this time they
[01:13:33] hit. Oh, you're lucky they got a four
[01:13:35] instead of a one. They need a one. But
[01:13:36] they hit. They get
[01:13:40] 10. 17 is hit on somebody. That hit is
[01:13:46] going to go to Big Bk. Bring you down to
[01:13:50] 93 health because you have 110 health.
[01:14:02] Ah, now we keep going here. We're
[01:14:04] running a little adventuring. If you
[01:14:06] guys want to participate, you can come
[01:14:07] in, hang out with
[01:14:21] us. Which one was it?
[01:14:24] Thought I download that one. All right,
[01:14:26] there you go. Shooting it again. All
[01:14:29] right, you're going to
[01:14:32] shoot. Oh, you hit him this time. Nice
[01:14:34] for
[01:14:36] uh 10. All right, you hit him for 10.
[01:14:41] Now, the explosion this
[01:14:45] time rocks the ground a little
[01:14:48] bit and you notice something rolling in
[01:14:51] the background.
[01:14:57] bringing them down to their uh what is
[01:15:00] that? 33 health for the
[01:15:07] dragon. Mystic's going to shoot
[01:15:09] also. Oh no, Mystic, you missed. And it
[01:15:13] wasn't that far away. It was far away
[01:15:15] though, but not too far. That the dragon
[01:15:17] takes a little bit of a hit. Like I
[01:15:19] said, the dragon takes a hit sometimes
[01:15:20] if it's if depending on how far off it
[01:15:22] is. That wasn't horribly off because you
[01:15:24] get a plus with that
[01:15:26] weapon mystic. You have what is your
[01:15:29] plus? It's plus eight. So it brings it
[01:15:31] actually up to 12. So you're not so far
[01:15:32] off. You're only off by like a few. So
[01:15:34] it gets them down to 30 to 29 health
[01:15:38] from where they were. Gives you a little
[01:15:40] extra because it's nice hot dice today.
[01:15:43] You follow the swing. Follow with a
[01:15:44] swing. We ignore the plus
[01:15:47] four. You hit with a swing which is
[01:15:54] uh 10
[01:15:57] 15 bringing it down to
[01:16:03] uh
[01:16:05] 14. The dragon is not happy and they
[01:16:08] attack you in a last ditch
[01:16:12] attempt. Is that a
[01:16:15] one? No, that's a two. Oh, you guys are
[01:16:18] lucky. Got 19. They get for uh there we
[01:16:23] go.
[01:16:25] 10 17 again. This time they hit
[01:16:31] Mystic. And you go down from
[01:16:33] 85 minus your 17 health down to 68
[01:16:36] health. Mystic.
[01:16:50] Yes, two is electric. That is correct.
[01:16:52] But you have to choose it first. Has to
[01:16:54] be the first weapon for it to be able to
[01:16:56] use that. Remember, it has to be the
[01:16:57] primary weapon for it to work that
[01:17:00] way. We'll see what we got going on here
[01:17:02] today, my
[01:17:06] friends. They attacked. You have a
[01:17:09] choice. What are you doing now? Oh no.
[01:17:15] I figured that. All right. Shooting.
[01:17:18] Let's see.
[01:17:20] You big BK. You're not used to the power
[01:17:24] of your
[01:17:26] um of your new weapon there. All right.
[01:17:30] You're not used to this power of the
[01:17:32] weapon here. So, um you you have to that
[01:17:36] it jams on you
[01:17:39] again. Then I'm guessing you're going to
[01:17:41] try to swing
[01:17:44] swing away
[01:17:48] there
[01:17:51] and you have 12 which I don't think will
[01:17:54] hit because it's
[01:17:55] 18. Oh no. So where's plus eight? So
[01:18:00] that's 10.
[01:18:02] Then you
[01:18:05] have one on your
[01:18:08] [Music]
[01:18:12] agility and three on your strength. Oh,
[01:18:14] all right. So it's 12
[01:18:18] 13
[01:18:20] 10 oh
[01:18:23] 14. Is it 12 or is tw plus 12 for your
[01:18:27] sword, right?
[01:18:30] because you have your uh agility that
[01:18:32] helps adding it to
[01:18:34] it. 14. All right. I don't know if it
[01:18:37] was 14. All right. Yeah, because this
[01:18:39] Oh, strength. Strength is there. I
[01:18:41] forgot about your strength. So, you got
[01:18:43] plus 14. You hit. You
[01:18:45] hit. Yeah. It's really hard to miss with
[01:18:47] that
[01:18:48] one. You have a uh I knew it was I was
[01:18:51] just like I'm sitting there like, why is
[01:18:52] it missing something? I'm missing
[01:18:54] something. There's 10.
[01:18:57] Oh. All right. Well, look at that. A
[01:19:00] nice
[01:19:03] 20. You uh Yeah, that uh that dragon
[01:19:06] there, that dragon
[01:19:09] there falls to the
[01:19:14] ground.
[01:19:16] Dead.
[01:19:18] D
[01:19:20] E
[01:19:21] D
[01:19:24] dead. And in its
[01:19:28] place, where is
[01:19:33] it? On the ground, that thing that you
[01:19:35] saw rolling around shows up. There's a
[01:19:37] few pogs and there's a dinosaur egg
[01:19:40] there. Oh, look. Now you see what they
[01:19:43] were fighting
[01:19:44] for. No wonder why they did not run
[01:19:47] away. So, you end up finding 75
[01:19:51] Pogs and um a dino egg, a dragon egg.
[01:19:56] Ah, but this is a flight flightless one.
[01:19:58] This is the egg for. You're not going to
[01:20:00] be able to have another D dragon, but
[01:20:02] maybe you can uh use it for trade or
[01:20:04] something like that. Who
[01:20:05] knows? So, you going to split split the
[01:20:07] pogs between the two of you or somebody
[01:20:09] taking the dragon? Who's taking the
[01:20:11] dragon egg?
[01:20:19] I think Mystic has one.
[01:20:28] All
[01:20:29] righty. You're going to take it. Mystic
[01:20:31] must not be around then. They must have
[01:20:32] left. So, you take the egg. Uh, we want
[01:20:35] to split the Pogs. We'll give you um 45.
[01:20:37] Give Mystic
[01:20:39] 30. Get Mystic up because uh or or do
[01:20:42] you want to split them? Try to do them
[01:20:43] even. You want to steal from Mystic
[01:20:46] since you're taking the egg. Give him 45
[01:20:48] and you take 30 is what I'm saying.
[01:20:50] Sorry, I I flipped that around cuz
[01:20:52] you're taking the egg, you get 30, he
[01:20:54] gets
[01:20:56] 45. I My brain flipped that for some
[01:20:59] reason. No, no, that's between you and
[01:21:02] Mystic. I was flipping it because you
[01:21:03] you got the egg. I figured you'd take 30
[01:21:06] pogs and he'd take the 45. All right.
[01:21:09] Yeah, my brain flipped that for some
[01:21:10] reason. Like, wait, that did not come
[01:21:12] out right. So, you go up to 163 and
[01:21:16] Mystic goes from 19 to he's at uh plus
[01:21:20] 45 would
[01:21:22] be
[01:21:24] 63. Well, that's kind of interesting,
[01:21:26] huh? Both bet instead of 100 from
[01:21:28] it. Ah, you you like messing with him.
[01:21:32] All right, I'm good with that. Can you
[01:21:34] can you guys can fight it out?
[01:21:37] the two of you uh you two big BK with
[01:21:42] his with his baby dragon on his shoulder
[01:21:43] and Mystic sitting there smoking
[01:21:45] cigarette like yeah sure we fighting
[01:21:47] that
[01:21:49] out. All right now we have some more.
[01:21:52] You anybody else? You guys come in
[01:21:53] participate in some adventuring. You can
[01:21:55] uh get on any other cool things that we
[01:21:57] have available. We have the eggs. We

[01:22:01] uh well the egg it used to be the eggs.
[01:22:03] We have our our our Pogs that used to be
[01:22:06] the eggs. They're all right here in
[01:22:07] front of us. And then we also have our
[01:22:10] um our other things, too, that are
[01:22:13] available. Your dragon cannot attack,
[01:22:16] dude. It's a
[01:22:18] baby. It's a baby dragon. It doesn't
[01:22:20] understand that stuff
[01:22:22] yet. You can't just be like, I'm going
[01:22:24] to make it do what I want it to do.
[01:22:27] Mystic, right? You need some uh you need
[01:22:31] to teach your your friend here. He needs
[01:22:32] some um
[01:22:35] guile.
[01:22:36] cunning a little bit. It's not always a
[01:22:39] forceful punch right on through, you
[01:22:43] know. Mystic goes sometimes you have to
[01:22:45] be uh you know a little
[01:22:47] suave and
[01:22:51] uh see uh a little uh good word for
[01:22:56] it. You going to feed it the alligator
[01:22:58] bites? Ah, yes. You got to remember the
[01:23:00] foreplay. Yes. Right,
[01:23:01] mystic can't just go right on in. You

[01:23:06] it, get it ready. But you're going to
[01:23:09] feed him some bites. I like it. You get
[01:23:12] your gator dillo bites that you've had a
[01:23:13] bunch of them. You're like, "Yes,
[01:23:16] delicious." Hand him up to your buddy,
[01:23:19] the uh the baby dragon there on your
[01:23:22] shoulder and he starts nibbling

[00:00:02] Come on.
[00:00:07] Seriously, like I
[00:00:09] said, nothing
[00:00:16] works. Making me log into a million
[00:00:19] things here. Why is it making me log
[00:00:21] into a million things? Cuz it wants to.
[00:00:59] Sweet. Let's see if tech
[00:01:02] works. Oh, there we go. Is it going to
[00:01:04] work now?
[00:01:07] No,
[00:01:11] not going to work now. Maybe it's going
[00:01:14] to work now. It shows it's
[00:01:16] working. I don't know if it's working.
[00:01:18] We'll find out. Probably
[00:01:22] isn't. It doesn't seem to be at the
[00:01:25] moment. All right, let's [ __ ] Why is it
[00:01:27] not showing my stuff running? I'm
[00:01:28] hitting open to show me and it won't
[00:01:30] even [ __ ] show
[00:01:32] me. It's a weird start to the morning
[00:01:34] here.
[00:01:40] What is going on?
[00:01:52] What is going down right now? It's like
[00:01:54] nothing is working well. Can you guys
[00:01:56] see me at all?
[00:02:03] I don't know.
[00:02:06] I can't figure it out.
[00:02:13] You can see Can you see me? You can see
[00:02:18] me. Interesting because I can't see
[00:02:21] anything on my end at all right
[00:02:24] now. And I used to be able to see it and
[00:02:27] you will hear it. That's why I had like
[00:02:29] a foot mute and I'd got the echo going
[00:02:30] on.
[00:02:33] So, unless they did an update of some
[00:02:34] kind where you don't see yourself any
[00:02:36] longer. I don't know. That's weird.
[00:02:39] Let's try this. I'm trying to trying to
[00:02:41] get it to work all like I can't see
[00:02:43] myself or hear myself. It's like I I
[00:02:45] don't exist here. Oh, wait. It's back. I
[00:02:48] can see it now. That is so
[00:02:52] weird. That is so
[00:02:55] weird. All right. What playing games
[00:02:58] making me look silly in the
[00:03:00] morning. All right. I think we're good.
[00:03:03] We needed to do a little bit of that,
[00:03:05] right? That's what we need. A little
[00:03:09] up. We moved. And then uh every now and
[00:03:12] again when you move the the boat moves,
[00:03:19] too. So you
[00:03:21] uh Yeah, a little crooked today. We'll
[00:03:24] fix it
[00:03:26] tomorrow. Well, hopefully you're all
[00:03:28] having a good day. Sorry about
[00:03:31] uh being late, not having things all set
[00:03:33] up, right? That's what happens when you
[00:03:35] sail and are overly tired continuously
[00:03:40] now. I should probably have slept. No
[00:03:43] one lets
[00:03:46] me. Uh what am I supposed to look into
[00:03:48] here? I needed to add these cuz we did
[00:03:50] that yesterday and I forgot to put in
[00:03:52] those ones. That was my fault forgetting
[00:03:54] to do that. Hold on. Let's do here.
[00:03:59] We
[00:04:02] had this.
[00:04:04] There. Why is it showing? I hate that it
[00:04:07] doesn't
[00:04:09] show. Bigger.
[00:04:18] Bigger. Is it doing that? Well, we're
[00:04:21] going to do
[00:04:22] this. Make it easy.
[00:04:38] Okay, did that one. That one's gone.
[00:04:41] Give me one more minute
[00:04:43] here. Oh, no.
[00:04:48] No. It is The internet's going [ __ ]
[00:04:50] wicked retardedly [ __ ] slow today.
[00:04:52] I'm sorry for swearing, but god damn it.
[00:04:55] I can't even [ __ ] click a link and it
[00:04:57] won't
[00:04:58] work.
[00:05:00] [ __ ]
[00:05:03] Seriously, why are you laughing in the
[00:05:06] background, people?
[00:05:08] Your voice. It's your voice. Your voice
[00:05:11] goes to What the Oh my god. Why?
[00:05:16] All right. Thank you for your
[00:05:18] exaggerations. You're welcome. My child
[00:05:22] is making fun of me now. That's what's
[00:05:23] acceptable in this household.
[00:05:26] Ah, lost caverns. I didn't start it.
[00:05:28] Yeah, you did.
[00:05:35] Nope. Wrong way. Shifted them wrong way.
[00:05:37] No, that's wrong.
[00:05:41] Supposed to be delete and shift.
[00:05:44] No, I did it again.
[00:05:50] I can just keep doing that one.
[00:05:53] Yep. I'm broken right now. Sorry guys.
[00:05:56] It's like kind of working. I'm trying to
[00:05:58] get it to work
[00:06:01] right cuz I'm trying to import the last
[00:06:03] one and it won't do it for
[00:06:10] me. What? Oh, whatever.
[00:06:17] All right, let's
[00:06:27] do
[00:06:32] Okay, that
[00:06:46] That's what happens when I go behind on
[00:06:48] things. Don't pay attention. Things
[00:06:50] don't work right sometimes. But we'll
[00:06:52] see if it works right now. Going to add
[00:06:59] it. Oh, everybody's laughing at me. I
[00:07:04] know. Yo. Well, I can't help it. I'm
[00:07:06] [ __ ] clicking a button. It's like not
[00:07:08] working.
[00:07:10] gets
[00:07:11] annoying. Now you work with technology.
[00:07:13] So I know it's just trying to process
[00:07:14] something in the background or
[00:07:15] something's broken. And now I give it a
[00:07:17] second and I'm like, "All right, that
[00:07:19] means something's
[00:07:21] broken." So there's like options I have
[00:07:23] of restarting, refreshing, and just
[00:07:26] being pissed off. And sometimes I decide
[00:07:27] to just be pissed off cuz I feel like
[00:07:30] being a child at that
[00:07:33] moment. That was one of those
[00:07:36] moments. You're welcome.
[00:07:39] All right. Anyways, I think I got the
[00:07:41] other one in
[00:07:45] here or should be going in in there in a
[00:07:48] second
[00:07:49] here. It was freezing on me when I was
[00:07:52] trying to click on stuff. It was just no
[00:07:54] fun for a little
[00:07:57] while.
[00:08:05] There. There. That should be in there
[00:08:07] now.
[00:08:10] Aha. Well, if anybody wants to jump in
[00:08:12] on anything, we did have those the book
[00:08:15] pinned. Oh, [ __ ] Where did I put the
[00:08:16] book? [ __ ] Right to the
[00:08:32] front. Pretend that's always been there.
[00:08:39] Now, um I'm talking about this thing
[00:08:41] here. That's what that's what's pinned
[00:08:44] right now. It's a bunch of numbers on
[00:08:45] the back of things from a childhood for
[00:08:49] some of you. There you go. Now, they
[00:08:51] correspond to some of the items that we
[00:08:53] have in our store, but you put
[00:08:55] that right down like
[00:08:58] so, out of the
[00:09:01] way. And then you should have everything
[00:09:03] pinged now and ready to go.
[00:09:06] if we want to. That
[00:09:09] is, cuz today is one of those rough
[00:09:11] days. It's always going to start that
[00:09:13] way, right? Oh, no. Why are you doing
[00:09:15] this to me? It's being so silly right
[00:09:18] now again. Anyways, I was trying to add
[00:09:20] a giveaway in. That's actually what I
[00:09:22] was just trying to
[00:09:24] do. So, I forgot her to do that today.
[00:09:28] And I don't like forgetting to do that
[00:09:31] cuz what happens is uh doesn't allow you
[00:09:33] to put them in again. Like, see, I
[00:09:35] understand what they're saying like uh
[00:09:37] for the buyer ones or whatever. Like,
[00:09:40] it's a little frustrating. It's one of
[00:09:42] those ones I feel like they should have
[00:09:43] a a way of saying like all buyers from
[00:09:45] the stream when you click on it or
[00:09:48] just like current buyers or something
[00:09:51] like that or ones from certain point
[00:09:54] forward because if you're doing a
[00:09:56] stream, it would make sense that you
[00:09:57] would want it for all of
[00:09:59] them. you know, say you run out what you
[00:10:02] were doing and you decided to do
[00:10:06] more. But anyways, let's get this over
[00:10:09] and add that in so that we can
[00:10:12] have something like that if we want to
[00:10:14] do a buyer appreciation thing. Well, I
[00:10:16] haven't done one of these for a while.
[00:10:17] That
[00:10:19] shows Oh, no. I have not updated things
[00:10:21] for a bit. Oh, no. I'll have to change
[00:10:24] that one. Maybe we'll run one of those
[00:10:26] today.
[00:10:31] Don't catch flies. Oh, forgot about
[00:10:34] that. Close the mouth. Cover it
[00:10:40] up. Wrong long wrong sail. I think
[00:10:43] that's what it is. My
[00:10:46] problem. What? Somebody's coming to
[00:10:48] laugh at me sitting next to me instead
[00:10:50] of You can't be far away. You have to
[00:10:51] just laugh at me behind my back now.
[00:10:53] Literally behind my back. Not just
[00:10:55] actually figuratively. Literally behind
[00:10:57] my back now. I like it. You're really
[00:10:59] running with it, aren't you? No, you're
[00:11:00] the one laughing at me.
[00:11:06] I'm 11. You're 11. I want my coffee.
[00:11:14] Oh, it's cooled off.
[00:11:18] Good. Well, as you guys see, there's all
[00:11:21] kinds of stuff in the buy now. There
[00:11:22] always has
[00:11:24] been. Where it go? 100. Oh, that's like
[00:11:27] seems like a lucky number. All right. No
[00:11:29] one buy anything for a minute. I got to
[00:11:30] take a
[00:11:31] picture. I screenshot this. How do I
[00:11:35] screen? No. Where? Oh [ __ ] Where'd it
[00:11:39] go? I didn't realize
[00:11:43] it. I have
[00:11:46] 11 products in the buy now. That's
[00:11:49] awesome. That is kind of funny. That's
[00:11:51] why I said it's like a lucky
[00:11:53] number. Not too bad. Woo. How are you
[00:11:55] doing today? just uh we're just trying
[00:11:58] to start up the stream here and I was
[00:12:00] having some tech issues. I was having
[00:12:01] some other issues and I'm always got
[00:12:04] issues cuz I'm an issue. So, we were
[00:12:07] trying to just continue on uh our
[00:12:10] adventuring which I don't even have my
[00:12:11] tablet. That's what I'm talking about.
[00:12:14] So, when you move things around all the
[00:12:15] time is because you have to you got to
[00:12:17] sail. You got to make sure stuff doesn't
[00:12:18] fall. So, is it up there?
[00:12:23] Oh, it is up there. Thank you. Got you.
[00:12:25] I appreciate that. I thought it was over
[00:12:26] there with the uh the other stuff.
[00:12:30] Exactly where it was. You knew where it
[00:12:31] was. Aha. Well, that was helpful.
[00:12:35] Luckily, the cord's still right next to
[00:12:48] me. Let's see if that opens. Ah, it
[00:12:52] does. No.
[00:12:53] Maybe. I don't know. Oh, we'll find out
[00:12:55] in a
[00:12:57] second. Says disconnecting. That means
[00:12:59] it's not going to work. So, we have to
[00:13:02] reboot. Does work.
[00:13:05] It's a trap. Yeah, it seems like it
[00:13:09] works. All right.
[00:13:13] So, I don't always open these. There's
[00:13:16] actually It's like kind of like an
[00:13:17] online store in a way. Woo.
[00:13:19] Um the um there's us on the website you
[00:13:24] can go pick something up and what we do
[00:13:26] is we open them and when we play uh when
[00:13:28] we do that we play
[00:13:29] sometimes depending on who you are like
[00:13:32] big BK I think came back. They're
[00:13:34] hanging out. He's one of our uh our
[00:13:36] adventurers that continue to go go and
[00:13:39] upgrade to the point that they're uh
[00:13:41] pretty built up there. Well, they don't
[00:13:43] want to. And the problem is though, the
[00:13:45] story brings them to uh this vocation
[00:13:47] with a
[00:13:49] mutated dragon moose beast that I don't
[00:13:53] know. That was weird when it was made,
[00:13:55] but it happened.
[00:13:58] Very Draco.
[00:14:02] Draco. Ah. Anyways, we have
[00:14:07] um I think the surprise sets are running
[00:14:09] right. Yep. We'll run again with uh
[00:14:12] let's do one of the collector ones
[00:14:15] again. Let's see if it will work for me.
[00:14:19] Now, this has all collector boosters as
[00:14:20] it says. It's all collector boosters.
[00:14:22] What you see in
[00:14:24] there. Now, what happens is you get
[00:14:26] something to do with the game. If you
[00:14:28] want to, you can participate with it. If
[00:14:31] not, you
[00:14:33] uh don't just have me open the pack.
[00:14:36] I've had people do that. Some people
[00:14:37] just have me ship it.
[00:14:40] So, that's where we stand at the moment.
[00:14:43] I'm a little uh like I said, a little
[00:14:44] tired trying to catch up a bit. It's
[00:14:47] been a long couple days. I was going to
[00:14:50] try to do something cool, but it then it
[00:14:52] stopped working this morning. So, I had
[00:14:53] to figure that one out again later. That
[00:14:56] was weird. The uh wouldn't like transfer
[00:14:59] the video. The I have a thing that I go
[00:15:01] between uh my my phone and the computer
[00:15:04] to be able to put the video on there and
[00:15:06] for some reason it just was not working.
[00:15:08] I don't know if it maybe I wonder if
[00:15:09] there's an update needed for this
[00:15:15] one. That could be it. Let's check on
[00:15:18] this
[00:15:23] side. Ah, that might have been the
[00:15:27] issue. Well, I always forget about
[00:15:30] checking updates on all the things. I
[00:15:33] should because I'm a I work with
[00:15:35] computers and I still work with them all
[00:15:36] the time. It's one of those silly
[00:15:40] things. Well, we'll run one of the ones
[00:15:43] with instead of collector wizards, we'll
[00:15:44] do the play draft. Let's do that one
[00:15:50] instead. Oh, game corpse coming in with
[00:15:53] a raid. Why, thank you, my good sir, or
[00:15:55] ma'am. I can't remember who it is that's
[00:15:57] in there all the time. I didn't see you
[00:15:58] this morning right away. Thank you very
[00:16:01] very much for coming
[00:16:03] in. Let's uh you know what? Let's run

[00:16:07] you. We'll do it
[00:16:09] as do it as one of
[00:16:12] the packs that we have and we'll do an
[00:16:15] Aether drift pack since we are Kevin
[00:16:17] having y'all coming in hanging out with
[00:16:19] us. All right, we'll do that right here.
[00:16:21] We got that. We'll throw one of those
[00:16:23] out. Say thank you guys for coming in
[00:16:25] with the raid, hanging out with us. And
[00:16:27] we're going to go I change it. I think I
[00:16:30] did. There we go. We're going to run and
[00:16:33] jump in here with it saying thank you.
[00:16:35] come on in and uh make sure you follow
[00:16:36] Game Corpse. They're on all the time.
[00:16:38] They got a bunch of different times
[00:16:39] they're on hanging out. So, we
[00:16:40] appreciate that. We'll run this. Thank
[00:16:42] you all for coming in. And then
[00:16:47] um what we have going on today, we have
[00:16:50] all kinds of stuff in the buy now. We
[00:16:51] actually have
[00:16:55] 111,11
[00:16:57] items. So, that was kind of a cool
[00:16:59] number to start the day with. I didn't
[00:17:00] realize that. That was like a lucky
[00:17:02] number. I don't know. I guess that means
[00:17:03] I'm going to have uh luck today and
[00:17:05] somehow. Who knows? I'm guessing it's
[00:17:08] going to be somebody's going to open
[00:17:10] something cool. Maybe that's what
[00:17:12] generally it ends up being cuz I don't
[00:17:13] get to open the cool thing. I got to
[00:17:15] grab a coffee here. Pirates cannon.
[00:17:20] We get to be a pirate with can. And
[00:17:22] there's going to be some cannon shut off
[00:17:24] today at 10:30 or something like that
[00:17:26] where we are, which is crazy.
[00:17:31] That's what happens when you're on a a
[00:17:33] boat and you travel around. You get to
[00:17:34] see some weird
[00:17:35] things. Now, hopefully you all are

[00:17:49] happens is some of the people here that

[00:17:55] bed. They uh that's our character for
[00:17:58] him.
[00:17:59] He's got a little dragon they want found

[00:19:46] Hopefully, you're uh having a good
[00:19:48] morning, my friend. Let me put a uh
[00:19:50] sleeve on this. Exactly. Not terrible
[00:19:53] for
[00:19:54] uh for the uh pickup there. Let me write
[00:19:57] your name down on that gray
[00:20:03] light. Now, if you want to, like I was
[00:20:05] saying, you can uh hang out with us in
[00:20:07] the wasteland here. You've been there's
[00:20:09] a small town people hanging out. That
[00:20:10] would be that would be you. You're new
[00:20:13] being
[00:20:14] new. You start out with
[00:20:17] a start out with a
[00:20:19] pistol and a knife. If you want to come
[00:20:22] and hang out and do some things like
[00:20:24] would like to do some scavenging. All
[00:20:26] right. We can do some scavenging. Boop.
[00:20:28] Sorry, I bumped the
[00:20:29] camera. See what goes on. Now, we do
[00:20:32] have another one here that people would
[00:20:34] like. We have the the collector booster
[00:20:36] version. There's all collector boosters
[00:20:39] in
[00:20:40] here and uh you get a choice of
[00:20:44] one now if you'd like to. Now, Scavenge
[00:20:47] Boop is trying to do, but my this is our
[00:20:49] buddy. We'll get to them. This is what
[00:20:52] Boop had made for themselves. They got
[00:20:54] some intriguing weapons and items right
[00:20:56] now. I think their uh their weapon of
[00:20:59] choice was the one they
[00:21:02] made, the skull axe.
[00:21:06] That was an intriguing one. I guess they
[00:21:08] That was you, right? Right. Am I
[00:21:11] thinking the right person or No, wait.
[00:21:12] No, you have the You have

[00:21:25] is. So, gray light, if you'd like, you
[00:21:28] can do that. Now, that was for the
[00:21:30] collector boosters, but we'll go back to
[00:21:31] the play and draft because those ones
[00:21:34] are fun.
[00:21:38] There we
[00:21:40] go. And our winner is Hack 404 not
[00:21:46] found. I like it. All right. Now, that's
[00:21:49] a pretty good name, by the way. You got

[00:22:33] rare there. Galliant strike and a foil
[00:22:35] full art on your planes and a thopter
[00:22:38] token. Not too
[00:22:41] bad for a uh for a giveaway there. I'd
[00:22:44] be pretty happy on that. And there we
[00:22:46] go, my friend. We are going to get that
[00:22:48] there for you. And
[00:22:51] um I'm going to put your name on the
[00:22:55] back of
[00:22:58] that. I'm going to chuckle every time I
[00:23:00] read that.
[00:23:04] Funny thing is, I've been working with
[00:23:06] some stuff and running into that a
[00:23:07] couple
[00:23:08] times when developing
[00:23:12] things. But we should have uh
[00:23:14] hopefully uh depending on how, you know,
[00:23:17] how the day is going, if we continue on,
[00:23:18] we'll see how it goes. But there you go,
[00:23:21] my friend there. We'll run another one
[00:23:23] of our giveaways. Now, these ones we
[00:23:24] kind of do regularly. They're Let's see.
[00:23:26] Make sure it's set up right. There we
[00:23:28] go.
[00:23:35] Make sure it's set up right. There we
[00:23:37] go. We're on another one where we do our
[00:23:39] other one here. Let's find them. There's
[00:23:42] a rare mixed in. Then there's a bunch of
[00:23:45] uh
[00:23:46] alters. Let's see if I have them all.
[00:23:49] No. One, two, three, four, five, six,
[00:23:52] seven, eight, nine. We're missing one.
[00:23:55] So, I'll have to get an extra one out
[00:23:56] here.
[00:23:58] But that will be what we have for our
[00:24:00] giveaway
[00:24:02] area. There's the other. We'll put
[00:24:04] another one in from there. That's what
[00:24:06] we'll have in. We'll keep that running.
[00:24:07] Have some fun with you guys. Now, if you
[00:24:08] want, remember you once you get that,
[00:24:10] you have a uh discount on shipping.
[00:24:11] Pretty much free packs
[00:24:14] uh shipping for one or two. So, that's
[00:24:16] not bad. I think it's one definitely.
[00:24:18] There's I don't know about two
[00:24:20] potentially two. I don't know how their
[00:24:21] shipping updates have addressed any of
[00:24:22] that now. It used to, but hey, well,
[00:24:26] we're on some of the um these. But we
[00:24:28] have, as I said though before, we got a
[00:24:29] lot of stuff in the buy now.
[00:24:31] Here we have um the blue book
[00:24:35] there. Good morning, Gustavo. How's it
[00:24:37] going, buddy? Hopefully you're having a
[00:24:39] good morning, my
[00:24:41] friend. How is it down in uh Brazil
[00:24:44] there?
[00:24:53] Yeah, there's a show there's a link in
[00:24:54] the notes if you'd like to
[00:25:00] shortly I'll have a bot that'll pop up
[00:25:01] and you'll be able to type in stuff and
[00:25:03] say things. I used to I had
[00:25:05] it running on my other computer. I
[00:25:09] forgot to transfer it over to this one
[00:25:10] to run it today. You know, I don't want
[00:25:11] to break things right now. So, I just
[00:25:14] woke up and hey, that's good. I uh I
[00:25:17] think I should have probably slept
[00:25:18] longer myself. You know what I mean? And
[00:25:20] it's one of those days where you just
[00:25:22] you're up for a
[00:25:23] while like like yesterday and I I mean
[00:25:26] because we had God's
[00:25:27] f how my mouth is working so well. We
[00:25:30] had sailed overnight. So I'm uh still
[00:25:34] kind of tired. I think that's what my
[00:25:36] problem
[00:25:37] is. It's actually I believe what it is
[00:25:40] right now. But anyways, we got that
[00:25:43] running there in the
[00:25:45] background. And I'm going to zoom out
[00:25:48] some. We're uh we're going to continue
[00:25:51] doing some of this stuff though. Let's
[00:25:53] get over
[00:25:56] here. Let's get over
[00:26:07] here.
[00:26:14] H What happened? I thought I did that
[00:26:16] one.
[00:26:28] H. Maybe I
[00:26:32] didn't. Well, then we'll have to do
[00:26:34] this.
[00:27:01] All right, we'll see. Ah, things are
[00:27:04] working intriguingly well right now.
[00:27:15] We owned it. Yeah, we moved on to it.
[00:27:17] Actually,
[00:27:19] Gustavo, this is We sold pretty much all
[00:27:22] of our stuff and moved on to it. The
[00:27:24] stuff that you're not going to use
[00:27:25] because you are on a boat, you know what
[00:27:26] I mean? You can't use all these things.
[00:27:28] And if you had like we we had a couple
[00:27:30] cars, we didn't need both of them. So,
[00:27:31] we just kept one truck so that if we
[00:27:34] need to do stuff, we can.
[00:28:10] How's it going down there though?
[00:28:12] Everything going well in the uh we have
[00:28:15] always wanted I have a friend that comes
[00:28:17] from Brazil, lived in Brazil and his
[00:28:19] family moved up here. I don't know how
[00:28:20] how many years ago did he come up here
[00:28:22] many many years ago when he was a child
[00:28:25] but uh he's always goes down and visits
[00:28:27] and I'm like I always wanted to go to
[00:28:29] like different places. So that's like
[00:28:31] knowing that some people that I know
[00:28:32] from there, it's it always makes me want
[00:28:33] to go more if that makes any sense. It's
[00:28:35] like I want to go visit that place more
[00:28:37] because I actually know someone there or
[00:28:38] I know a family that's from there or
[00:28:40] something like that cuz I don't know. I
[00:28:41] find it's or like I met someone online
[00:28:43] and it would be nice to go down and talk
[00:28:45] to them or that type of thing. So, oh,
[00:28:47] we have our giveaway going again. Well,
[00:28:49] look at that. A number between 1 and 10.
[00:28:50] One, two, three, four, five, six. Oh, we
[00:28:52] already counted them out. I showed them
[00:28:54] all earlier. Now, if you're not here,
[00:28:55] we'll just give you a random
[00:28:57] one later when we're packing. So, let's
[00:29:01] uh get a number there. We'll keep going.
[00:29:03] Uh we'll try another for you. Why not
[00:29:06] throw another out
[00:29:09] there?
[00:29:12] Now, I had this over
[00:29:15] here in that
[00:29:18] pack. I don't know if I want to do that.
[00:29:21] I want to do that.
[00:29:26] Trying to think. Oh, there they are. I
[00:29:27] was wondering where they all went. I was
[00:29:28] like missing some
[00:29:33] stuff. These are all the play boosters
[00:29:37] and stuff from the
[00:29:39] eggs. So, you got a pack. Well, they
[00:29:41] were the eggs. They're now the book.
[00:29:43] That's what you see right there. The Pog
[00:29:44] book there. They used to have all kinds
[00:29:46] of stuff. They were used to be the eggs,
[00:29:48] but I took them out cuz we uh you know,
[00:29:49] Easter's over. So, we still have the
[00:29:50] collector boosters that are all in
[00:29:51] there.
[00:29:53] Then there is the
[00:29:54] uh three times packs that are in there.
[00:29:58] So you going to get like say three time
[00:30:00] brothers war or Oh they're all upside
[00:30:02] down. How are they upside down? Three
[00:30:04] times outlaws. Why are they upside down
[00:30:06] in there? Three times
[00:30:08] Dusour or you can get yourself a
[00:30:11] Commander Masters set or three times
[00:30:14] Taria or three times Modern Horizon 3 or
[00:30:19] three times Unfin. So only some of them
[00:30:21] are upside down. That's interesting.
[00:30:22] Wondering why that's all set up
[00:30:29] weird. All
[00:30:31] righty. It's been weird cuz
[00:30:35] USA. Hey. Yeah, it is. It's not great
[00:30:38] for everyone here. I've been trying to
[00:30:39] figure out things myself and um and I I
[00:30:42] think uh we're going to have everybody
[00:30:44] in the not too distant future will have
[00:30:46] either a
[00:30:49] sol be good for all because somebody's
[00:30:51] going
[00:30:52] to break on one side. They're not going
[00:30:55] to go both on like that for forever
[00:30:57] because it's just not going to happen.
[00:30:59] Just not the way they work. Um so it's
[00:31:02] either going to break and some side's
[00:31:04] going to have better luck than other.
[00:31:05] That's all it's really going to boil
[00:31:06] down to for when it comes to the people.
[00:31:08] Uh, who knows what'll happen, but
[00:31:11] luckily being on a boat, I can have and
[00:31:13] then hopefully get the solar panels
[00:31:15] taken care of
[00:31:17] because that's going to make everything
[00:31:19] a lot more expensive soon ourselves
[00:31:21] trying to get those
[00:31:23] even. So, we're trying to get all of our
[00:31:25] stuff taken care of as quick as we can
[00:31:26] on our boat, but it's being uh
[00:31:28] everything is getting slowly done
[00:31:30] because some of that crap, you know,
[00:31:34] others just moving around on a boat
[00:31:35] takes a while to get done on things. So,
[00:31:38] who wants to try
[00:31:40] out? Well, I think of the plan is uh he
[00:31:42] doesn't his mindset is business versus
[00:31:46] running a a group of people. So, he's
[00:31:50] trying to run it as business-wise. And
[00:31:52] it works sometimes and doesn't work all
[00:31:54] the time. And I think that's what you're
[00:31:55] running into is who knows when it's
[00:31:57] going to work, if it's going to work or
[00:31:58] not.
[00:31:59] So he thinks that well these people are
[00:32:02] have an upper hand and he would like to
[00:32:05] be an even playing field or have an
[00:32:06] upper hand themsel. I'm like oh
[00:32:09] well this is the situation we're in
[00:32:11] right
[00:32:14] now. Who knows what will happen with it.
[00:32:17] I'm not really on either side of it
[00:32:18] because quite frankly it doesn't matter
[00:32:21] what I
[00:32:23] say. You know I could say one thing that
[00:32:25] I could say I agree. I could say I
[00:32:27] disagree. I could say my opinion on how
[00:32:29] it should go. No one's going to hear it.
[00:32:32] Yeah, exactly. Good luck for all of us.
[00:32:33] So, what's it matter? Exactly. I'm just
[00:32:35] going to keep going about my life,
[00:32:36] trying to do the right thing, being
[00:32:38] appropriate,
[00:32:39] and Oh, I say bada
[00:32:43] boom. We'll run a flash sale for a
[00:32:45] little bit on the uh the p the pog book
[00:32:48] there. So, if you want to go in and pick
[00:32:50] a number for one of
[00:32:52] those, natty, you got
[00:33:01] I like it. Well, you know what? At least
[00:33:03] we can have fun. Exactly. That's kind of
[00:33:05] what I'm getting at. It doesn't matter.
[00:33:07] There's nothing you can ne necessarily
[00:33:09] do about it. Now, things went one way
[00:33:12] for some, you know, see some people like
[00:33:14] this. I don't know who they I don't I
[00:33:16] don't personally don't know any that are
[00:33:18] very happy. I know some that are like
[00:33:21] online say they are, but then again,
[00:33:24] people online aren't really what they
[00:33:25] are in real life. You know, when you're
[00:33:27] looking at a person face to face and
[00:33:28] you're talking to them, it's a lot
[00:33:32] different. They are always a lot
[00:33:34] different, you know. Oh no, got some
[00:33:37] stuff on my
[00:33:43] shirt. Wipe my glasses off for a second
[00:33:45] cuz I'm an old person and I need to be
[00:33:47] able to see.
[00:33:51] But either way, I just try to live with
[00:33:54] it the best I
[00:33:56] can. Like you said, good luck for all of
[00:33:58] us. But hey, we'll look through. We'll
[00:34:00] see one of the stuff in here. Like, I
[00:34:01] mean, you can't complain about it. You
[00:34:03] just got to work with
[00:34:06] it. We'll show off. Oh, I didn't know
[00:34:09] that was stuck in there. Look at that. I
[00:34:10] had an open pack over
[00:34:12] there. Let's see. We got in our our book
[00:34:14] here. But we're going to set it up with
[00:34:16] some singles is what I was planning on
[00:34:17] doing here and doing a singles version.
[00:34:19] But we have some Pogs in here. We had
[00:34:20] somebody pick out one the other day.
[00:34:22] Some fun stuff available.
[00:34:24] Wow. Thank you. Are you the only one
[00:34:26] joining any of the giveaways here?
[00:34:28] Because you've got them all so
[00:34:31] far. Another
[00:34:34] number another number,
[00:34:38] Hank. That is crazy. That was three in a
[00:34:42] row, by the way. So, um, it's going to
[00:34:45] say that's an intriguing thing to occur.
[00:34:47] And I'm going to try this again here cuz
[00:34:49] I'd like to see what happens right
[00:34:51] now. This is number four. Well, they're
[00:34:54] not even answering. So, I don't even
[00:34:55] know if it's I'm guessing they're a bot
[00:34:57] cuz they're 404 not found or they're a
[00:35:00] human that um has fallen asleep and
[00:35:03] that's what they change their name to
[00:35:04] when they fall asleep. I don't know cuz
[00:35:05] they're not found. Hank is no longer
[00:35:07] found. He's
[00:35:09] sleeping. I don't know, man.
[00:35:36] But
[00:35:42] yep. Well, that's why I said it's a bot.
[00:35:45] It could be a bot.
[00:35:50] One in 30 chance possible technical
[00:35:52] technically. Yeah. Well, that's what
[00:35:59] happens. Yeah, exactly. Well, it depends
[00:36:02] on how it goes, Gustavo. I mean, if um
[00:36:05] one person caves, then it won't get more
[00:36:06] expensive. If another person caves, it
[00:36:09] won't get more expensive. But if they
[00:36:10] come to an amicable amicable solution,
[00:36:12] then it won't get so expensive either.
[00:36:14] But if they continue to fight, then it
[00:36:16] will get expensive. That's really what
[00:36:17] it boils down to. But the problem is the
[00:36:20] people of this planet don't know how to
[00:36:22] work together anymore. They just fight
[00:36:25] and argue instead. I mean, I tell my
[00:36:28] kids, I can't remember where I I got
[00:36:31] this story from. It was from many years
[00:36:33] ago about the uh like a scientist that
[00:36:36] went um was going around Africa and
[00:36:39] found a tribe and he gave he had a candy
[00:36:42] bar, like a Hershey's bar. Now, the
[00:36:43] Hersy bar uh was out there and he set it
[00:36:46] down on a rock in front of all the kids
[00:36:48] in the in the tribe and was like, "Yeah,
[00:36:49] the first one gets it has
[00:36:51] it." And no, no, no kids get up to run
[00:36:54] and get it. And he's like, "Well, that's
[00:36:56] weird." And the scientist like turns to
[00:36:58] the other guy that's with him like, "I
[00:36:59] don't understand what's going on." He
[00:37:00] goes, "What?" And the other guy was one
[00:37:01] of the tribesmen. He goes, "Well, if
[00:37:04] they
[00:37:04] all try talk to him or like cuz if they
[00:37:07] all don't get something, they're not
[00:37:08] going to do it." So, he tries again.
[00:37:09] Whoever gets it first and he puts two
[00:37:11] down. No one goes and gets it. He's
[00:37:13] like, "Well, that's weird." So, no one
[00:37:14] want to know about it. I'll talk to him.
[00:37:15] The kids, one of the kids went up. He
[00:37:17] went up to one of the kids and the kid
[00:37:18] said, "If they can't all have
[00:37:21] some, then they don't want to get it cuz
[00:37:23] one being happy would mean all of them
[00:37:25] aren't. The rest of them aren't. So,
[00:37:27] they won't none of them will go out and
[00:37:29] do it. Grab the candy bar." So, they
[00:37:32] uh put out like I think he put out one
[00:37:34] or two more. And then they said, "All
[00:37:36] right, all of you can have one now." And
[00:37:37] there's enough for everybody. So, they
[00:37:38] all went over and got one. And that's
[00:37:39] the only time they went.
[00:37:43] So, you know, it's kind of like that. No
[00:37:45] one wants to do that anymore. Everybody
[00:37:46] wants to take it first and we're
[00:37:48] away
[00:37:50] versus working together so that
[00:37:52] everybody gets a piece. Yeah, maybe you
[00:37:54] don't get a whole piece, whole bar. You
[00:37:56] might get half a bar instead, but you
[00:37:58] still better than everybody getting
[00:37:59] nothing and one person getting one
[00:38:01] thing. I That's what we're running into
[00:38:03] a lot of.
[00:38:05] No one knows how to take the time to
[00:38:06] work together. But sometimes taking the
[00:38:08] time to work together, it takes a little
[00:38:10] bit of time as it did in the story. You
[00:38:11] know, you'd have to I don't know if it's
[00:38:12] real or not, but the scientist had to
[00:38:14] talk to somebody and the tribe to
[00:38:15] understand why. Then he had to talk to
[00:38:17] the kids also to understand why so they
[00:38:20] could both move
[00:38:21] forward so everybody would be happy. I
[00:38:24] don't know, weird. But I try to tell it
[00:38:26] to the kids whenever they're like
[00:38:27] fighting about something. Like, well,
[00:38:29] what about the candy bar story? I'm
[00:38:30] like, sometimes it works, sometimes
[00:38:32] doesn't.
[00:38:38] Well, we're at our
[00:38:40] location. Yep.
[00:39:08] Oh, all
[00:39:10] right. But we have our We'll try another
[00:39:13] one of the giveaways and I'll see what
[00:39:14] happens with this one. We had that on a
[00:39:16] discount there. No one jumped on it. So,
[00:39:18] um we'll get running here. Well, you
[00:39:20] know what? We'll rise. Why not? We'll
[00:39:21] run one of the um surprise sets. See if
[00:39:24] anybody wants to jump in. We'll go with
[00:39:27] the draft booster play boosters where
[00:39:28] you get one of these out of there.
[00:39:30] There's a hund different ones in there.
[00:39:31] You should see them in the in the um
[00:39:33] options area when you look at it. And
[00:39:35] whoever wants to, you can jump in and
[00:39:37] participate and have some fun or you can
[00:39:39] uh go
[00:39:41] in still hang out and talk. We don't
[00:39:44] mind. I'm just I do things in the
[00:39:47] background sometimes.
[00:40:31] It's so hard to type with without a
[00:40:32] finger now. I have to learn how to type
[00:40:34] without my pinky. And it's starting to
[00:40:36] I'm starting to get better at
[00:40:38] it. Uh I missed the end of it, too. Hold
[00:40:41] on. No.
[00:40:44] Cosmicness. Oh, this is another person
[00:40:46] that never answers. All right,
[00:40:47] cosmicness. Let's see if you're actually
[00:40:49] in here.
[00:40:51] If you are this or maybe there was a
[00:40:52] person with a similar name. It might not
[00:40:54] have been this one. But anyways,
[00:40:55] cosmicness, if you're in here, a number
[00:40:57] between 1 and 10 because there used to
[00:40:58] there was a person with another name
[00:41:00] that was similar that I had pop in more
[00:41:01] than once. It was like
[00:41:04] this. Well, I did use my pinky before,
[00:41:06] but it's broken now and I can't use it
[00:41:08] as well anymore cuz the tip of it
[00:41:09] doesn't type well and it hurts when I
[00:41:12] press on it sometimes. So, I tried not
[00:41:14] to use it as much, but I broke it when
[00:41:15] we were
[00:41:17] um first week we had the boat. Trying to
[00:41:20] show the kids. Don't do fingers
[00:41:22] shattered.
[00:41:24] I say I said first week we had the boat.
[00:41:27] No, it was no fun. Oh, let's see if I
[00:41:29] have the image of it. I'm going to go
[00:41:31] find it. I'm going to show you what my
[00:41:32] finger looked like. It was fun. I have
[00:41:34] it. I I think I have it
[00:41:38] here. Hold on a second. When was that?
[00:41:41] December, right? Yeah. Christmas.
[00:41:46] Okay, hold on.
[00:41:47] Here. So, we'll start with That's the
[00:41:50] wrong hand. Well, maybe it is the right
[00:41:53] hand. I don't know.
[00:41:55] Uhoh. Something refreshed. All right.
[00:41:57] Here we go. So, we got that. Then it
[00:41:59] goes to There's the side. There's the
[00:42:01] side view of the hand. All right. That's
[00:42:03] the
[00:42:04] finger. See, if you can tell, it's
[00:42:06] broken in a few pieces there. There's a
[00:42:08] piece there. There's a piece there.
[00:42:09] There's a piece there. There's a piece
[00:42:10] there. And that's the main
[00:42:12] piece. Oh, there's the closeup of it.
[00:42:15] Hold on. There's the closeup. Let me
[00:42:16] see. Do I have another closeup? Oh, hold
[00:42:18] on. I got two more. That's a good one.
[00:42:21] Now, that was a good one. There's a that
[00:42:23] points out where one of the other brakes
[00:42:24] is. So, the tip of my finger is actually
[00:42:26] broken, too. So, the tip of my finger
[00:42:28] broke. That's broken where there's the
[00:42:30] piece over here. This is actually a
[00:42:32] piece holding the tendon. That's why my
[00:42:33] finger doesn't bend right anymore. Yeah,
[00:42:36] that was that was a fun one. And then,
[00:42:38] oh, there we go. That's another good
[00:42:39] one. There you go. That's That gives you
[00:42:42] the full
[00:42:43] Ouch. Oh, no. It wasn't crushed. It was
[00:42:46] um so on on a you know on a motor when
[00:42:48] you pull pull the pull start a motor
[00:42:50] well the line the cord the rip cord um I
[00:42:53] uh wave came and I was standing on a
[00:42:55] part of the dinghy that wasn't that had
[00:42:57] a like was smooth and one of my feet
[00:43:00] slipped and I went down and I went and
[00:43:02] when I let go it came off of this finger
[00:43:05] but it wrapped around that finger and
[00:43:07] when it wrapped around that finger that
[00:43:08] finger went like this and it was
[00:43:10] pointing sideways. I almost passed out.
[00:43:13] That was one of the few times in my life
[00:43:15] I like got hurt and I was like, "Oh boy,
[00:43:16] I ain't going to pass out." Like
[00:43:19] actually, very rarely does that ever
[00:43:20] happen. But it was because I mean it was
[00:43:22] shattered. It was in four pieces and it
[00:43:23] was bent sideways. But then I put it
[00:43:26] back in place. I taped it up and we went
[00:43:29] to the Christmas festival in St. Thomas
[00:43:33] and then we went to the ER and they
[00:43:34] said, "Your finger shattered. You're
[00:43:36] screwed." And then I spent boatload of
[00:43:39] money to go to Florida for no reason for
[00:43:40] the doctor to tell me exactly what I
[00:43:41] already knew.
[00:43:43] Um, which is why I'm a doctor now also
[00:43:46] along with a captain. I'm a doctor
[00:43:48] because I, you know, I' I've so far told
[00:43:50] them everything that they ever needed to
[00:43:51] know know about me. But, um, and was
[00:43:55] right. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah. Oh, I broke
[00:43:58] a good m. Yes, I did. Oh, yeah. So, I've
[00:44:02] decided I'm now a doctor because every
[00:44:04] single time I tell them that there's a
[00:44:06] problem or this is the cause of it or
[00:44:07] this is what I believe is the cause of
[00:44:08] it and they ignore me. Uh years later, I
[00:44:11] find someone else that tells me, "Oh,
[00:44:12] yes, you've been right the entire time."
[00:44:14] Or, um or we find out that um oh yes,
[00:44:17] you've been right. You just spent
[00:44:18] thousands of dollars to fly here for no
[00:44:20] reason. Well, luckily the doctor was
[00:44:21] nice though. He goes, he told us we can
[00:44:23] leave and not have to pay for anything
[00:44:24] after he looked at the hand. He was
[00:44:25] like, "Oh, you're fucked." Pretty much.
[00:44:26] He's like, "You have 5% chance of us
[00:44:28] ever making that finger work again."
[00:44:30] Now, with that 5% chance, you have a 45%
[00:44:33] chance of it being in pain for the rest
[00:44:34] of your life after the surgery. I'm
[00:44:36] like, "It's not really super painful
[00:44:38] now. it's going to just heal and I'll be
[00:44:39] good, right? He's like, yeah, if we do
[00:44:40] the surgery though because of how it
[00:44:42] moves and you move it all the time,
[00:44:44] you're going to be in pain. I'm
[00:44:45] like, I'm going to go with just just the
[00:44:48] pinky barely work, you know, just the
[00:44:50] tip of it not working. I'm good with
[00:44:55] that. Exactly. Exactly, Saint. See,
[00:44:59] that's what I said. I'm like, I'm I'm
[00:45:00] good with the 5% chance. I'm I don't I'm
[00:45:02] You know, my 5% is generally like
[00:45:04] negative 500%. So, I'm not even going to
[00:45:07] try. So, we're good. I'm going to stay
[00:45:09] with the keeping the broken
[00:45:12] finger. Oh, it's uh it's recovered to
[00:45:15] the point that I can bend and do
[00:45:16] everything. Like, I can move my finger
[00:45:18] if I touch it. If I touch here though,
[00:45:20] it hurts just because the piece of bone
[00:45:22] is still on there that's still connected
[00:45:23] to the uh tendon. That's why there's
[00:45:25] like a weird bump and a dimple in my
[00:45:26] finger compared to the other one cuz
[00:45:28] that is supposed to be a piece here, but
[00:45:29] it's hanging down there if you can tell.
[00:45:31] Let's do it that way.
[00:45:35] Anyways, but
[00:45:37] anyways, I'm recovered as best as I'm
[00:45:40] going to be. Hopefully that pain this
[00:45:41] goes away though, so I can get rid of
[00:45:42] some of the pain that occurs from the
[00:45:44] bone here. My wife said I' worst case
[00:45:45] scenario, it'll come out through the
[00:45:47] skin or it's I'm going to have to have
[00:45:48] it cut out as worst case scenario. But
[00:45:51] we'll see what happens. Hopefully, it's
[00:45:52] an easy one that it just like kind of
[00:45:54] disintegrates into the
[00:45:58] body. That's the uh that's the bad luck.
[00:46:01] Good luck that I have. Oh, all right.
[00:46:07] This is what I was trying to do earlier
[00:46:08] this morning. Let's see if I can get to
[00:46:11] work
[00:46:12] again. It wouldn't work before. It kept
[00:46:14] freezing and hanging. So, I'm wondering
[00:46:16] if it was because I needed to find an
[00:46:22] update. I wonder if that's what it was.
[00:46:25] All right, let's
[00:46:27] see
[00:46:29] there. Oh.
[00:46:42] Start the way because reinstall and
[00:46:46] unfortunately.
[00:46:48] Okay. Well, I don't want it to work in
[00:46:50] that yet. I just need it to work here
[00:46:52] and not freeze. Oh, it might work. There
[00:46:56] we go. If it does, that'll be nice.
[00:46:58] Hopefully, we can have audio is going to
[00:47:00] be dup both of them.
[00:47:03] Let's do
[00:47:05] this. Can you hear me now? Can you hear
[00:47:08] me
[00:47:09] now? Yes. No. Maybe.
[00:47:12] So, potentially. It should sound
[00:47:14] different because I'm on a different
[00:47:15] microphone. It should be on the on my
[00:47:17] phone. Yes, you can. All right. Let's uh
[00:47:20] let's see if anybody I'm going to do
[00:47:22] this. I'm going to put my I think I can
[00:47:23] put the computer up there. I know I can
[00:47:26] bring the tablet, but I think I can
[00:47:27] bring the computer up there, too, so I
[00:47:29] can see
[00:47:32] everything. Let's see if I can pull this
[00:47:34] off. I mean, it's slow. No one's really
[00:47:37] jumping on anything. Might as well go
[00:47:38] and hang out and see what the area is
[00:47:41] like. All right, let's see if we can do
[00:47:42] this here. All right, we have that.
[00:47:45] We're going to grab this here. This is
[00:47:48] needed. Okay, that's needed. I'm going
[00:47:51] to be do this. We'll be right back here.
[00:47:53] You should be able to hear
[00:47:57] My dog's lean in the
[00:48:00] way. All right, you should be able to
[00:48:02] hear
[00:48:04] me. Then let's see if I can get this set
[00:48:07] up correctly to
[00:48:08] work. We'll just hang out here for a
[00:48:11] little
[00:48:13] while. We uh I have have my coffee and
[00:48:17] see if anybody wants to do anything.
[00:48:33] Oh, well, I think you can hear me
[00:48:42] there. Let me do it this direction.
[00:48:54] trying to get it. So, I don't need to
[00:48:55] have that that way. That's
[00:48:57] why I always forget that I don't need it
[00:48:59] that
[00:49:00] high. All right, let's see. Cuz I'm not
[00:49:02] seeing anything at the moment. You going
[00:49:03] to have to give me a
[00:49:05] sec. Should be able to pull it all up
[00:49:08] here though to see
[00:49:13] it. You should be able to hear me still.
[00:49:16] You have to give me a minute so I can
[00:49:17] just get into
[00:49:19] uh my computer to
[00:49:22] see where we
[00:49:27] are or so you can I can see you
[00:49:31] guys all
[00:49:37] chatting. I
[00:49:39] think
[00:49:42] maybe potentially
[00:49:48] No, not going to show it. All right,
[00:49:49] let's do this
[00:49:53] then. I'm going to do
[00:49:59] that. Do
[00:50:09] this. No. All right. I think we can see
[00:50:12] it here. You should be able to Hold
[00:50:18] on. Let's switch
[00:50:22] it. There we
[00:50:25] go.
[00:50:30] Hello. Should be able to hear
[00:50:33] me. Okay, now let's do
[00:50:40] this. Can you see me?
[00:50:50] Should be right
[00:50:58] here. No, it doesn't look like it wants
[00:51:00] to pick it
[00:51:02] up. It'll pick up the audio, but not the
[00:51:05] video for some reason.
[00:51:15] All right, let's do this
[00:51:16] then. Should be able to get that
[00:51:25] there. Let's
[00:51:27] see why this is doing all that.
[00:51:37] Well, no one's jumped. I can see
[00:51:39] everybody in what they're doing here.
[00:51:40] Yeah. So, I'm trying to c get this to
[00:51:42] work here. It just seems not to want to
[00:51:44] do it right now for some
[00:51:46] reason. Huh. Let's
[00:51:51] do that.
[00:51:57] Okay. No, doesn't want to go. Can hear
[00:52:01] but not see. It says I need to restart
[00:52:04] something and I think that might be what
[00:52:05] the problem is. I don't want to restart
[00:52:07] the computer. So, I'll probably just be
[00:52:09] back over there and hang out because
[00:52:11] that's what the issue is right now. I
[00:52:12] think that's what it was. There was an
[00:52:14] update on the product. That's why it was
[00:52:16] freezing and hanging.
[00:52:19] Ah. So, let's uh see if I
[00:52:24] can get it to connect
[00:52:26] though and show what's in here. Let's
[00:52:29] try this.
[00:52:47] Okay. Should be back to hearing
[00:52:58] me. Okay, let's see.
[00:53:02] Let's see if it'll pick it
[00:53:07] up.
[00:53:08] H does not want
[00:53:13] to. Yeah, it's weird. I don't know why
[00:53:15] it doesn't want to pick up the camera
[00:53:17] even though it's showing it there.
[00:53:20] H I'm guessing it is the
[00:53:26] restart. Maybe I need to Let's try that.
[00:53:33] find it now. No, won't find it either. I
[00:53:36] was wondering if maybe it had something
[00:53:38] to do with the
[00:53:44] uh
[00:53:49] no. All right. Well, we'll go back to
[00:53:51] the other camera and everything like
[00:53:53] that. Give me a second.
[00:54:10] Well, that stinks.
[00:54:26] I'm very slow. So, I'm trying to just
[00:54:28] [ __ ] not be bored as much as [ __ ]
[00:54:30] self. I'm not selling anything. No one's
[00:54:32] really talking because they're either
[00:54:33] playing a a different game like a video
[00:54:34] game or something, you know? Yeah. All
[00:54:36] righty.
[00:54:39] It's not like Yeah.
[00:54:45] It's weird. It just I don't understand
[00:54:47] why it's not working. It's like talking
[00:54:49] through it. Like, they can hear me now
[00:54:50] on both of them. I had to turn the echo
[00:54:52] off so they don't like they're playing
[00:54:54] it like this is fine. like whatever
[00:54:55] they're doing, but I don't care whatever
[00:54:57] anyone's doing. But it's just acting
[00:54:59] weird and I'm like I can't get and I
[00:55:01] wanted to hang out out there with
[00:55:02] everyone. But for whatever reason,
[00:55:05] technology doesn't want to work right
[00:55:06] for me all day
[00:55:08] anymore. Yes, we do actually get to play
[00:55:11] to go to the LGS to play Gustavo. Uh
[00:55:13] sometimes we head
[00:55:14] uh sometimes we head over um to one that
[00:55:18] we had in the area, but we didn't get a
[00:55:19] chance to slap it. Sometimes it you do
[00:55:22] have to hit things, but when it comes to
[00:55:23] technology, not always, cuz generally
[00:55:25] when you hit it, it
[00:55:27] breaks. That's the only problem. I was
[00:55:29] trying to get it so you guys see our
[00:55:31] background and where we are, like where
[00:55:32] I am right now. But it wants me to
[00:55:33] restart [ __ ] and I don't want to
[00:55:34] [ __ ] restart anything, and then it'll
[00:55:36] lose all what we're
[00:55:40] doing. All right. Should be able to see
[00:55:43] everything back
[00:55:44] now. Uhoh.
[00:55:51] Well, that's not the right
[00:55:54] thing. There I
[00:55:58] am. All right.
[00:56:03] Well, we're back. We never left. It was
[00:56:06] just the video of me disappeared for a
[00:56:08] minute. It was just acting really,
[00:56:09] really
[00:56:10] weird. Can't seem to figure out
[00:56:13] why. Well, no, I do know why. It's just
[00:56:15] technology doesn't like to work
[00:56:16] sometimes.
[00:56:23] So, I'm just just the way it is. Well, I
[00:56:26] like when techn is like, "Oh, I'm going
[00:56:27] to do an update." And even though you're
[00:56:28] not going to update anything right now,
[00:56:30] the new version won't work. It won't
[00:56:31] work until you go to the new version.
[00:56:32] It's like they inject the ability to put
[00:56:34] in a
[00:56:36] break so that they can break
[00:56:39] it. Well, they uh so that you have to
[00:56:43] you have to upgrade
[00:56:47] I don't know how it's kind of funny
[00:56:49] sounding. I
[00:56:50] know. There we go. That's
[00:56:53] better. But that's where we're at. We'll
[00:56:56] hang it out for a little bit here. Let
[00:56:58] me get this. Uh yeah, technology doesn't
[00:56:59] want to work all the
[00:57:00] time, but we'll do what we
[00:57:04] can. So, today though, what I will
[00:57:08] do since it is the early morning, we're
[00:57:10] going to try
[00:57:12] um throwing out
[00:57:16] Where are
[00:57:20] they? There they
[00:57:23] are. Go do this.
[00:57:44] We'll do this for a little bit
[00:57:47] here and then we'll make some plans is
[00:57:50] what we'll do that and then we'll make
[00:57:52] some plans because it seems like just
[00:57:54] technology is not working great and you
[00:57:56] know technology doesn't work great
[00:57:57] there's no point in
[00:57:58] forcing. So if you're not going to force
[00:58:01] might as well do um something worth
[00:58:03] having some fun
[00:58:05] with. All
[00:58:07] righty. This is what I'll be doing
[00:58:11] today. I have to get some more product
[00:58:14] in. I'm stuck in the uh product hole
[00:58:16] right
[00:58:18] now. That's me
[00:58:25] issue. Oh, printers are definitely you
[00:58:27] have to love those or you have to hit
[00:58:29] them with a hammer and get a new one.
[00:58:31] That's that's the um it's you're you're
[00:58:34] either caressing the printer and saying
[00:58:36] thank you for working because it's
[00:58:37] finally done its job or you're
[00:58:39] dropkicking it out of the window going
[00:58:42] you I hate you you
[00:58:44] suck because I used to work where we had
[00:58:47] to print stuff out regularly not like
[00:58:49] not all the time but like at least a
[00:58:50] couple times a week and I had to go and
[00:58:52] like um just just for whatever we were
[00:58:55] doing. It was mainly for meetings. It
[00:58:56] was a waste I think that's actually
[00:58:57] mainly what it was. That's a waste of
[00:58:58] paper if it was for meetings. Those
[00:59:00] papers got thrown away. I never use
[00:59:01] those. I know one else. Anyways,
[00:59:04] um and
[00:59:07] they always broke halfway through one
[00:59:10] set once a week. It's like
[00:59:13] seriously. And everybody was always It's
[00:59:16] like once or twice a day. There was a
[00:59:18] problem with with
[00:59:19] just no wonder why people went to
[00:59:22] technology because it breaks a 100 times
[00:59:23] a day instead of once a day or twice a
[00:59:25] day. And they're used to things
[00:59:26] breaking. They just want to be in an
[00:59:27] insane situation.
[00:59:31] Wait a minute. That doesn't sound right.
[00:59:33] But that's
[00:59:37] accurate. I can't get it to display on
[00:59:39] the screen. Well, hold on. Let me let me
[00:59:41] fix
[00:59:43] that. Then they spend four hours trying
[00:59:45] to get that to display on the screen
[00:59:47] versus
[00:59:48] just the printer like it used to be. And
[00:59:51] then the printer like it used to be
[00:59:52] breaks when they go to use it and
[00:59:53] they're just like screw it, I'm
[00:59:55] done. That's when I This when you go
[00:59:58] home for the day. Luckily, we had a game
[01:00:00] room at that location. So, when you got
[01:00:02] the screw it, I'm done feeling. You go
[01:00:03] in the game room and play some uh play
[01:00:05] some old old games like uh cons like
[01:00:08] like like you were in a arcade like
[01:00:10] arcade games. So, you could go play like
[01:00:12] Contra. We had a pinball machine. Uh I
[01:00:15] was pinball king there. I had the high
[01:00:16] score. No one could beat me. One point.
[01:00:18] I had to like give it up and walk away
[01:00:21] because people like, "Dude, it's getting
[01:00:22] loud in there." I'm like, "Yeah, I know.
[01:00:23] I'm sorry. There's a lot of there's a
[01:00:24] lot of wards going off right now.
[01:00:27] It was like at lunchtime. But
[01:00:31] anyways, that's because I was uh very
[01:00:34] good when I was younger, but I don't see
[01:00:36] those anymore around any
[01:00:39] locations. Now, we're going to be doing
[01:00:40] this for a few and then we'll go hang
[01:00:43] out with a friend of
[01:00:47] ours. Now, we don't generally get to go
[01:00:49] over this direction, but we will now.
[01:00:51] So, hopefully you guys have a good one.
[01:00:53] We're going to go off and
[01:00:59] um Yeah, exactly. If you use it too
[01:01:01] much, it'll break. If you don't use it
[01:01:02] enough, it'll break,
[01:01:06] too. Um I think you can get the special
[01:01:10] guest from them, but I don't know how
[01:01:11] how often. That's one of the special
[01:01:13] guest ones,
[01:01:18] right, Damian?
[01:01:43] Yeah, you can get it from play boosters.
[01:01:45] You
[01:01:48] can the dogs in the background. Ah, you
[01:01:50] caught him playing.
[01:01:53] He just ran by. Yeah. Yeah, I think
[01:01:56] so. Is that his? Correct.
[01:02:02] Yes. Yeah, he's a he's a cute one. He'll
[01:02:04] go by every now and again. Say
[01:02:07] hi. All
[01:02:12] right. There he goes
[01:02:16] again. Again,
[01:02:20] the reflection of him off the uh they
[01:02:22] get a reflection of him. I think
[01:02:25] that is Bones is the dog's name.
[01:02:30] All right. What we'll do right now
[01:02:31] though is we're going to go over and
[01:02:32] hang out with a friend Jason
[01:02:34] here. Oh, he is not that big. He's only
[01:02:37] like 45 50 lbs at the most. 45. 45.
[01:02:41] Yeah. So, not a big dog. Just looks big
[01:02:43] because of the reflection in the mirror
[01:02:45] in the thing there. All right,
[01:02:47] everybody. I appreciate you all coming
[01:02:48] in, hanging out. You have a good one,
[01:02:50] everyone. We'll see you guys uh tomorrow
[01:02:52] morning. Maybe I'll try to get it set up
[01:02:54] so we can do the camera a little
[01:02:55] differently and hang out with

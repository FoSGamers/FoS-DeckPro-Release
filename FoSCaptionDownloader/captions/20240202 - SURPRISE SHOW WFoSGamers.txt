[00:06:23] bandage wraps around it tape over it and
[00:06:26] he can't lick it and he gets all
[00:06:27] frustrated so helps us heal like you you
[00:06:29] know whatever is going on with that all
[00:06:31] right that was the pack deal that I put
[00:06:33] on nobody wanted that that's okay we're
[00:06:35] going to go back and show our uh we're

[00:06:44] beautiful we can get it
[00:06:47] going and see who has the luck this
[00:06:50] morning see who can pull out one of the
[00:06:51] serial eyeses or one of those uh what's
[00:06:53] that uh special uh I keep forgetting
[00:06:57] it the um
[00:07:00] clue
[00:07:13] one I don't
[00:07:16] care that's so
[00:07:28] weird
[00:07:30] any modern no I do not I have some
[00:07:34] coming in but not any now I am sorry no
[00:07:38] I do not have any of
[00:07:42] that so there's some I hav't paid a ton
[00:07:46] of attention myself so I've actually
[00:07:48] been
[00:07:50] um trying to figure out more of
[00:07:54] it but here this is what we have for
[00:07:57] them the big one
[00:08:00] on why is that in
[00:08:09] there that's
[00:08:17] weird why is it doing that for me I
[00:08:20] don't have I don't know what a lot of
[00:08:21] the big ones
[00:08:23] are I may be frozen are we good my [ __ ]
[00:08:27] freezes sometimes and I get pissed all
[00:08:29] right we good now can you hear me am I
[00:08:32] echoing is that
[00:08:34] better oh
[00:08:36] God I'm gonna have a problem this
[00:08:38] morning and this is not I'm getting sick
[00:08:40] and tired of I've reset stuff so this
[00:08:42] doesn't make sense why I keep having
[00:08:44] these technical issues I actually think
[00:08:46] it keep it keep being whatnot connection
[00:08:48] and everything I keep running into
[00:08:50] because I'm fine with other stuff except
[00:08:54] for
[00:08:55] uh except for using whatnot it freezes
[00:08:58] so I what I'm guessing with it I have
[00:09:01] not frozen yet all right all
[00:09:03] right let me do this here write that
[00:09:06] price down so I have it flater for you
[00:09:08] guys if you want it that that is and
[00:09:11] remember we do have our
[00:09:15] uh new oh there's Wills we do have our
[00:09:19] new big glue book there for those that
[00:09:21] are interested in uh going after some
[00:09:23] singles maybe and stuff like
[00:09:28] that
[00:09:30] so let's see what are you guys looking
[00:09:32] for it says you look for new release
[00:09:34] pull games and single deals all right
[00:09:37] let's put up our poll box right our kind
[00:09:39] of a poll box I call it the Big Blue
[00:09:41] Book it's kind of like the poll box but
[00:09:43] that's what I'll put up right now for
[00:09:44] you guys it's kind of cool I like it get
[00:09:48] you got $1,800 worth of stuff there's
[00:09:50] actually now only 78 spots because every
[00:09:53] time there's something pulled that
[00:09:54] spot's pulled out so you only have 78
[00:09:56] spots available now but I'm going to
[00:09:58] give a second uh scroll through this so
[00:10:00] you guys can see what's in
[00:10:03] here you have ceiling is 90 there's a
[00:10:06] floor is between 11 and $20 the average
[00:10:08] is around 22 and out of the 17 floors
[00:10:11] two of them have already been hit so
[00:10:13] this is where we are we got stuff like
[00:10:15] this here you can maybe get a force of
[00:10:17] negation a monod drain foil maybe you
[00:10:20] want a Shir Rod uh maybe you want
[00:10:22] yourself a be aiju I think that's how
[00:10:24] you say that
[00:10:26] one but we got a lot of good stuff in
[00:10:28] here and for $20 what happens is if you
[00:10:31] have that anything maybe you want that
[00:10:32] ristic study maybe if you if you get
[00:10:34] something that's between $1 and $5 you
[00:10:36] get a pack and that is going to be
[00:10:39] either a pack of murders of Carlo play
[00:10:41] booster Exelon draft a Coria draft or a
[00:10:45] uh dungeons draft what we do here is
[00:10:50] cyclonic Rift I do not have a cyclonic
[00:10:53] Rift I did sell the one that I happen to
[00:10:56] have maybe one of B's tomb though
[00:10:59] but no I do not have a cyclonic Rift I
[00:11:01] sold the last one that I had um a little
[00:11:04] while ago for a Lingus but anyways
[00:11:06] that's what do you have there and if you
[00:11:07] have anything that's under $10 you get a
[00:11:11] pack now you get a pack
[00:11:15] of any of
[00:11:17] these here all
[00:11:20] right then if if you happen
[00:11:24] to uh get one under $5 you get a choice
[00:11:28] of one collector booster of dungeon and
[00:11:30] Dragons or two of those so that's how
[00:11:33] you go
[00:11:41] there all right yeah I have the Toppers

[00:28:59] it is it doesn't have the extra lines on
[00:29:01] it or is it because there's a little
[00:29:04] foil thing in the corner I thought that
[00:29:05] was just part of the foil I thought the
[00:29:06] ink was um like special stuff written on
[00:29:09] it
[00:29:13] right yeah this is a normal foil that's
[00:29:15] what I thought that's what I thought I
[00:29:17] thought the ink ones had like a weird
[00:29:19] like a kind of design is thing on

[00:34:30] have been on a little bit of an older
[00:34:31] one and when I restarted everything it

[01:08:17] I do have a three pack deal if you look
[01:08:19] there are three pack deals on the
[01:08:20] murderer play boosters if you're
[01:08:22] interested in those just type in uh like
[01:08:24] play boosters and you should be able to
[01:08:26] get that up I'm sorry what for whatever
[01:08:28] reason it puts it in weird order so I
[01:08:32] either need to go and figure out how to
[01:08:33] get it to go in the numerical order I
[01:08:35] want or I don't know yet because it's
[01:08:37] just weird that it puts it in the weird
[01:08:38] order but if you want more than one
[01:08:40] there's a good option for it so the
[01:08:42] carnival game the carnival game is fun
[01:08:44] so my children wanted to play a game
[01:08:46] when we started doing this they were the
[01:08:47] ones that kind of got me into this and
[01:08:49] what we do with our carnival game is you
[01:08:52] have now sadly right now now murders is
[01:08:54] not in the carnival game at the moment
[01:08:56] all right I did not put it in there
[01:08:57] since I got it in today so they are not
[01:08:59] in the carnival game but all my other
[01:09:01] types of packs are in it now what
[01:09:03] happens is there are three
[01:09:06] different there's Suns box the B box and
[01:09:11] then we have the father's box and you
[01:09:14] get a poll from this mystery packs and
[01:09:17] you get three mystery packs you're
[01:09:18] guaranteed to get those three mystery
[01:09:20] packs every single time you're never
[01:09:22] going to walk away with nothing but
[01:09:24] you're always going to walk away with
[01:09:26] those mystery packs so with
[01:09:28] that um you with those mystery packs we
[01:09:32] pull them out and we will do something
[01:09:35] like this now I don't have these packs
[01:09:36] available still these are just kind of
[01:09:38] like my old old ones so I'm just
[01:09:40] grabbing like a handful of them to show
[01:09:41] you like they're going to be like
[01:09:43] colored like this or whatever you're
[01:09:44] going have all these they're going to
[01:09:45] take three these three are the one that
[01:09:46] you happen to pull out we'll line them
[01:09:48] up in front of each one of these boxes
[01:09:51] and what happens is you uh we then flip
[01:09:54] them all over and we say all right this
[01:09:56] one says it's a dmu set you're going to
[01:10:00] get these are all going to be upside
[01:10:02] down that they're all upside down this
[01:10:04] is a dmu set Infinity draft and a
[01:10:08] midnight hunt set I don't have any of
[01:10:10] those anymore but because they're not in
[01:10:11] there but what we would do is we would
[01:10:13] crack those packs open and whichever one
[01:10:15] had the highest Mana value would be the
[01:10:18] Target that your um Dart hits which is
[01:10:22] like the carnival game you throw in a
[01:10:23] you'll throw in like a balloon Target or
[01:10:25] whatever you know a Target at the board
[01:10:27] and if you have and whichever one hits
[01:10:28] is where you get an extra pull from
[01:10:30] that's the free thing that you get maybe
[01:10:31] it's just a card maybe it's a card you
[01:10:34] might want to play with maybe it's an
[01:10:35] extra pack it's really up to you and
[01:10:37] what you get for luck but there you are
[01:10:39] Freddy I should have put you in your
[01:10:40] other bag I forgot you had that other
[01:10:42] bag there but that's a carnival game
[01:10:44] there for those that want to play it and
[01:10:46] that has everything that I have in the
[01:10:48] buy now available except for murders
[01:10:51] currently is the only thing that is not
[01:10:53] in there
[01:10:54] is the murders at Carlo and if I happen
[01:10:56] to have something that is in there that
[01:10:58] I'm out of I substitute it for um
[01:11:02] something that is is available that's
[01:11:04] the uh that's the carnival game yeah
[01:11:07] kind of little little fun game see what
[01:11:09] happens you always get three packs of
[01:11:11] cards but sometimes you get four
[01:11:14] sometimes you get some car some other
[01:11:15] things so that's really what it is
[01:11:17] that's our uh our carnival game if
[01:11:19] anybody wants to jump in and play it a
[01:11:21] lot of times we play it when the boys
[01:11:22] are here and we have a of fun with it um
[01:11:25] because you could have like Dad battling
[01:11:27] against the
[01:11:28] boys and battling against the B uh the
[01:11:31] buyer to see who has the best luck so

[03:04:37] do that's what I think I'm going to do
[03:04:39] all right guys we're going to do
[03:04:42] something a little different I thought
[03:04:43] about doing this before when I uh when I
[03:04:47] have some of the slow days and I have a
[03:04:48] new set that comes out with boxes that I
[03:04:50] plan on open myself so this is what I'm
[03:04:53] gonna do right now I'm gonna grab my
[03:04:55] family box that we were gonna have and
[03:04:57] I'm gonna open up a pack we're GNA see
[03:05:00] if I get lucky for the family back box
[03:05:02] that I have and then whatever happens in
[03:05:04] that pack you know what maybe we'll be
[03:05:08] putting that out for sale so if somebody
[03:05:09] wants it you got to let us know I think
[03:05:12] that's what I'm try out here and then
[03:05:14] what I'll do while I'm doing that I'm
[03:05:16] going to have a pack deal running in the
[03:05:18] background for all you guys how's that
[03:05:20] sound you get to see something open well

[04:35:17] tripped the new play boosters so the new
[04:35:19] play boosters are kind of like a
[04:35:20] combination of set and draft so with
[04:35:23] them it's more like you're going to be
[04:35:24] able to draft with them but if you want
[04:35:26] to collect you can get some good cards
[04:35:28] to collect out of so they're mainly bail
[04:35:30] for like kind of drafting and playing in
[04:35:31] store but you're going to get mythics or
[04:35:33] rares out of them compared to what you
[04:35:35] used used to get before if that makes
[04:35:36] any
[04:35:38] sense but that's our pack deal here oh D

[04:36:00] want to go all
[04:36:04] right if you want I can cancel your two
[04:36:07] ones so that you can do the three-pack
[04:36:09] one if you'd like

[04:36:48] and it should pull up a three-pack deal
[04:36:49] for
[04:36:52] you you should be able to pull up a
[04:36:54] three pack deal um by going in the buy

[04:37:10] weren't like you you know you your
[04:37:11] option of getting three you know pretty

[04:47:06] okay yeah yep oh I got a joke for you I
[04:47:09] got a joke for you I don't know if you
[04:47:10] heard it yet ready this is my dad joke
[04:47:13] where do you take someone that's been
[04:47:15] injured in a peekaboo
[04:47:21] accident come on
[04:47:25] Deo the
[04:47:33] ICU
[04:47:34] you just said I see you that's why I
[04:47:36] said that I was like I got a perfect
[04:47:38] joke for you D you gotta be used at you
[04:47:40] were close you were pretty close you
[04:47:43] gotta use that now you got a good joke
[04:47:45] to be using if you ever have a kid in
[04:47:47] there try to get him to
[04:47:49] chuckle all right here we go we're gonna
[04:47:52] put
[04:47:53] on a commander
[04:47:57] Masters a Murders At
[04:48:01] Carlo and a m you were very close you
[04:48:05] were very close with that this is our
[04:48:08] pack deal that we're going to put on
[04:48:09] right now no one's going to probably go
[04:48:11] for it but whatever we're going to try
[04:48:12] it
[04:48:15] anyways and we're going to call
[04:48:19] this if you want
[04:48:22] it this is going to be a really good
[04:48:24] deal but not everybody's going to go for
[04:48:26] it you get a mystery booster convention
[04:48:29] merge at Carlo Manor and a commander
[04:48:32] Masters collector
[04:48:37] yeah I understand that see the problem
[04:48:39] with the commander Masters is like you
[04:48:41] either get really good ones or you're
[04:48:43] like wow what happened and that's one
[04:48:44] the thing that I noticed and that and
[04:48:46] I'm the one that I get the one that was
[04:48:47] like wow what happened that makes any
[04:48:50] sense luckily though we did pull one of
[04:48:52] the packs out where we got a wow what
[04:48:53] happened out of this earlier so the nice
[04:48:55] thing about it is though D is if you
[04:48:57] hang around and you see somebody buy um
[04:49:01] like the commander Masters since there's
[04:49:02] only four of them there say you hang
[04:49:04] around and there's like one of them left
[04:49:06] or two of them left and there hasn't
[04:49:07] been anything big hit you have a good
[04:49:09] chance of getting a big one hit out of
[04:49:11] it so that's why I like watching people
[04:49:12] do it here because like I've done it
[04:49:14] before and I jumped in I bought one and
[04:49:16] I ended up getting um I think I got like
[04:49:18] a smothering tide or something I was
[04:49:21] like pretty sweet but I saw you jumped
[04:49:23] in on
[04:49:25] Carlo nice m at
[04:49:28] Carlo and we go we want to do one of
[04:49:32] those and let let's see what happens
[04:49:34] with that all
[04:49:37] right let's see what happens now where
[04:49:39] would you like to go fun fact yeah a
[04:49:42] little fun fact yeah that's kind of like
[04:49:44] what I uh I kind of pay attention to
[04:49:45] that that's one of the kind of way to
[04:49:47] know to jump at them or not when you're
[04:49:50] um nice last left last one on the left
[04:49:55] all right here we go you want me to rip

[05:40:57] and they would literally sit in my drive
[05:40:59] who knows how long because I got home at
[05:41:00] 3 and they would sit my driveway until

[05:41:25] but we do have a lot of them left if you
[05:41:26] guys want to try your luck so that with
[05:41:29] the FBI in my driveway what ended up
[05:41:31] happening was um my mom talked to him
[05:41:34] said he wasn't going to be back for two
[05:41:36] weeks as he was out fishing well end up
[05:41:38] coming down to it was my dad was um you
[05:41:40] know he he knew people growing up he I
[05:41:42] guess he had got in trouble a little bit
[05:41:44] and he knew some bad people um at one
[05:41:46] point um he was in jail for doing
[05:41:48] something stupid I guess racing and he
[05:41:49] hit a cop car or something like that I
[05:41:51] don't know something along that lines he
[05:41:52] was racing somebody drunk and he ran
[05:41:54] over a cop car uh so he was in jail for
[05:41:57] a few weeks for a few couple months
[05:41:59] but anyways with
[05:42:02] that that's not
[05:42:05] right um so I forget what I was just
[05:42:11] doing oh yeah the FBI then driveway I'm
[05:42:14] like I know what's going on so the FBI
[05:42:16] are there and I find out later that the
[05:42:18] people that he knew one of the people
[05:42:19] that he was employing on his boat was
[05:42:20] one of Hitman for Whitey
[05:42:23] buer like oh he's like yeah you know the
[05:42:26] guy I swear the guy's name was like
[05:42:28] Vinnie or something like that or Lenny
[05:42:32] Lenny yeah yeah you remember so and so
[05:42:35] like yeah that was a really nice guy
[05:42:36] he's like yeah he killed like 30 people
[05:42:39] like what so what happened was my dad
[05:42:42] employed him for like I don't know like
[05:42:45] uh nine months and he just lived on the
[05:42:48] boat and while he lived on the boat he
[05:42:52] um he just banked all his
[05:42:55] money dude it's always the nice
[05:42:57] characters he banked all his money and
[05:42:59] nine months later he bounced so the FBI
[05:43:01] was like yo where's this guy he has a
[05:43:03] warrant out for him because he bounced
[05:43:04] from the country we don't know where he
[05:43:06] is and he has he's supposed to be in at
[05:43:08] um checking in with his uh parole
[05:43:10] officer because he somehow was out
[05:43:13] because he couldn't he got away with all
[05:43:15] the murders the W buer murders but he
[05:43:17] only got caught with like beating the
[05:43:18] [ __ ] out of someone so he was only in
[05:43:20] jail for like eight years or something
[05:43:22] like that and he got out and he start
[05:43:24] telling my dad like oh yeah we killed
[05:43:25] like that my dad like shut up I can't
[05:43:27] hear about those stories anymore I'm
[05:43:29] accessory
[05:43:30] man so like that's why the FBI was my
[05:43:33] driveway for a while I got some
[05:43:35] interesting stories about my family mean
[05:43:38] my family were around my dad was around
[05:43:40] when the Hell's Angels started he was
[05:43:42] there with the beginning of the Hell's
[05:43:44] Angels I used to have a guy that drove
[05:43:47] my bus his name was Iggy and he rode
[05:43:48] with the green dragon of the Hell's
[05:43:50] Angels and this guy would tell me
[05:43:52] stories about my dad but H's angels are
[05:43:55] being created like when they were
[05:43:56] starting back in like the 50s 60s when
[05:43:58] my dad was around and he's like yeah
[05:44:00] your dad was known as the guy that came
[05:44:01] around with a bat like what he's like
[05:44:04] cuz he was smaller than everyone else he
[05:44:05] wasn't so big compared to everyone he's
[05:44:06] like he's good he was like 5'8 5'9 so
[05:44:09] he's on the shorter side but he said
[05:44:11] this is gonna even every match and he'd
[05:44:13] bring a bat out and I'm like son of a
[05:44:15] [ __ ] so that was who my dad was known
[05:44:19] as he made sure I stayed away from all
[05:44:21] those people growing up though except
[05:44:24] for when he passed away I met one of
[05:44:25] them and they asked if I wanted a
[05:44:27] motorcycle one of the houses Angels guys
[05:44:29] I'm like yeah I'm good like no we got we
[05:44:31] got a dozen of them you can have any one
[05:44:32] of them like uh that doesn't sound like
[05:44:34] a deal that I'm going to walk away happy
[05:44:38] with yeah D my sister has that
[05:44:41] Louisville Slugger by the way in her car
[05:44:44] she uses it as like if anything ever
[05:44:45] happens she gets worried she grabs it to
[05:44:47] like hit
[05:44:49] someone I'm telling you there's probably
[05:44:51] blood spatter on that thing that could
[05:44:53] get us in trouble especially if they
[05:44:55] knew Whitey buers my dad was friends
[05:44:57] with Whitey buers Hitman and used to
[05:44:58] beat the [ __ ] out of people and run guns
[05:45:00] out of the
[05:45:02] country I mean what [ __ ]
[05:45:05] whatever he's dead no one can hear about
[05:45:08] that no one hears about that
[05:45:12] anyways so they knew a lot of my dad
[05:45:15] knew a lot of interesting characters he

[01:21:00] hit that was already hit why is that
[01:21:04] still in
[01:21:06] there CH of calling is what it was it's
[01:21:08] a I have another one of them I don't
[01:21:11] know why that's in there again that
[01:21:12] shouldn't be in there again it's a CH of
[01:21:14] calling is what that
[01:21:15] is a cord of
[01:21:19] calling that shouldn't be in there all
[01:21:22] right so be Court of calling should not
[01:21:24] in here this is what I'm going to give
[01:21:26] you the choice of my
[01:21:28] friend Court of calling was one of the
[01:21:31] floors and this was a mistake I made all
[01:21:35] right I'm going to give you one uh a
[01:21:39] pack choice is that okay and the pack
[01:21:42] choice is going to be better than the $5
[01:21:44] quarter
[01:21:45] calling okay the pack choice is going to
[01:21:48] be better than the $5 quarter calling
[01:21:49] because I made the mistake when I make a
[01:21:52] mistake I fix it with something as a
[01:21:55] better option
[01:21:57] okay that's how I do that here because I
[01:22:01] don't know how that got in there twice
[01:22:04] and when that happens I fix it with
[01:22:06] something better so you can get your
[01:22:09] lost Caverns ion
[01:22:10] set modern Horizon mystery time spiral
[01:22:15] or Commander Legends yes F I see you
[01:22:19] there Jupiter but I am talking to other
[01:22:20] people I can get you in a minute buddy
[01:22:22] all right time spiral all all right
[01:22:25] there we
[01:22:26] go I am sorry on that one I don't know
[01:22:30] how two of those got in there but let's
[01:22:33] see what's in here for the other ones
[01:22:38] then you got yourself a
[01:22:41] daredevil nice
[01:22:45] Daredevil there you go well that's why I
[01:22:48] say if I make a mistake I correct it
[01:22:49] with a better something
[01:22:51] better
[01:22:53] Daredevil
[01:22:55] you got
[01:22:59] the maybe that's what it
[01:23:02] was because a cloudstone curio was
[01:23:05] supposed to be there where am I getting
[01:23:07] all messed up Crucible of the world cc
[01:23:10] is what maybe I'm missing another card
[01:23:13] I'm missing some cards I'm missing some
[01:23:16] cards where did my cards
[01:23:18] go cuz the cloudstone curio is this CC
[01:23:23] was the other one why am I missing the
[01:23:27] clouds I'm missing oh what did my
[01:23:29] children
[01:23:40] do I'm not having them do that anymore
[01:23:42] they said they helped and they wrote
[01:23:43] down the names right I think they wrote
[01:23:45] down the names
[01:23:49] wrong no those I wrote all of those ones
[01:23:51] down because I wrote all the cards down
[01:23:54] I wrote all the cards down how the [ __ ]
[01:23:56] are the cards wrong here cloudstone
[01:23:59] curio Crucible of
[01:24:05] Worlds wise Moth Man CH of
[01:24:20] calling
[01:24:23] dude
[01:24:25] yes this is definitely a good condom ad
[01:24:28] definitely a good condom
[01:24:32] ad I'm trying to think like what
[01:24:34] happened now all right anyways we'll do
[01:24:36] the same thing as we did before because
[01:24:38] that was another floor that you got
[01:24:40] there so you're going to get a choice of
[01:24:41] a better pack of cards
[01:24:44] again look at
[01:24:46] that because I made the
[01:24:49] mistake well not really we'll see
[01:24:56] no my kidss will be
[01:24:57] fine they'll be fine this just means um
[01:25:01] I'm giving away a little bit extra on
[01:25:02] stuff e doesn't matter I'm good giving
[01:25:05] away extra when I make a mistake I take
[01:25:08] care of it and I do it right cigarette
[01:25:11] lighter fire those
[01:25:14] missiles hey don't worry about it hey
[01:25:16] this is
[01:25:18] me what I had them do is I like dude I
[01:25:20] gotta go I said to them hey guys can you
[01:25:22] pack these up I got to go to the
[01:25:24] bathroom and and hide the eggs I I I
[01:25:27] don't think I can do that in the future
[01:25:28] I have to next time watch
[01:25:31] them so I went and took a took a dump
[01:25:34] they packed the eggs up and hid them and
[01:25:36] I'm guessing they made a little bit of
[01:25:37] mistake when they packed
[01:25:39] them but because of that you get a
[01:25:41] better choice of your sting here because
[01:25:44] that you had two floors and because you
[01:25:46] got two floors I'm giving you two better
[01:25:48] options need to send them to HR I know
[01:25:51] time spiral again all right
[01:25:54] hey you know what what happens is like I
[01:25:57] said if a mistake is made mistakes get
[01:25:59] made it's a point of time that you can
[01:26:01] give an explanation and work on
[01:26:02] something to make a like explain
[01:26:04] something and work on it to make it
[01:26:10] better yeah they were like you got it
[01:26:12] [Music]

[01:26:17] adoption it might be it might be all

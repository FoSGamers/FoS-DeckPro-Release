[2024-09-24 15:36:03] FoSGamers:
Search the Internet and figure out why, how, what not it has for anything new that they've released recently since September 24th, 2024, that would be new things for sellers to be able to use. I'm able to see what looks like somebody has set up something that looks like it says it's a break setup, where it has the percentage or amount of them being taken out of it, compared to having normally before that it would used to be everything would be fully done by ourselves and manually done how many spots were there type thing. So, that being said, I'd like you to go and take a look at this and see if there's any new features that they're testing that other people have access to and see if there's a way that I can request access to testing features in the future.

[2024-09-24 15:36:19] ChatGPT:
Whatnot recently released new features designed to streamline the breaking experience for sellers. These include the ability to quickly generate spots for breaks, support for multiple formats (e.g., Pick-Your-Team and random formats), and built-in tools for spot randomization and automatic assignments. Sellers can now manage their breaks more efficiently by using a new interface that allows them to pin spots, track buyer assignments, and export data for easy fulfillment. These enhancements make it easier to run breaks and improve the overall experience for buyers and sellers alike【7†source】【8†source】.

Additionally, Whatnot has rolled out a *Free Pickup* feature, which allows local buyers to pick up items directly from sellers without paying for shipping. This is especially useful for sellers who operate locally and want to avoid the costs and time associated with shipping【8†source】.

If you're interested in testing new features, Whatnot offers the ability to sign up for beta testing through their waitlist. This will give you early access to upcoming tools and features, such as the enhanced breaking experience, which is currently in beta【7†source】【8†source】.

To request access to these features, you can join the waitlist through Whatnot’s beta program or by staying updated through their product team’s announcements【7†source】.

[2024-09-24 15:40:03] FoSGamers:
The waitlist does not work. It doesn't bring me to a Google document that's active. It brings me to a blank one that's no longer there. I have to find me something new.

[2024-09-24 15:40:23] ChatGPT:
It seems the previous beta testing waitlists for Whatnot's new features, like the breaks tool, have been deactivated or replaced. However, based on the latest updates, Whatnot continues to roll out new features that include improved breaks management, inventory tools, and a Direct Service system for refunds. If you’re looking to gain early access to testing these or similar features, the most reliable way would be to keep an eye on their *Product Updates* section or reach out directly to Whatnot Support to inquire about current beta programs.

Here are a few things you can do:
1. **Product Updates and New Features**: You can regularly check Whatnot’s product blog for announcements of new beta tests or feature rollouts. It’s often the first place they mention updates, including beta programs for new tools like *Free Pickup* and *breaks management improvements*. You can explore these updates here: [Whatnot Product Blog](https://blog.teamwhatnot.com/product-updates-introducing-free-pickup-and-an-improved-card-breaks-experience).

2. **Contact Support**: If you are unable to find an active waitlist, you can contact Whatnot’s seller support directly to inquire about becoming a tester for new features. They are responsive to requests, especially if you're an active seller.

3. **Stay Engaged on Seller Platforms**: Sometimes beta programs are opened to sellers with high engagement or a history of sales, so ensuring you're an active participant on the platform can increase your chances of being selected for future tests.

These methods should help you stay connected to new features as they’re rolled out. If you want further assistance or a more direct connection, I'd recommend reaching out to Whatnot’s official support channels.

I'm going to paste below an email that I want to send to them about something different than it is to WhatNot, and since we're talking about WhatNot and you've had to make an email before, I want you to generate me a new email, um, for them, and, or, like, make the email, um, sound better, and so that way they want me to join the program, you know, um, let them know that I have over... 1,200 followers on YouTube, with thousands of people watching me every day, and over 100,000 a month are following and continuously growing. 100,000 a month are, um... watching my videos on YouTube, and that's just continuously growing. So I need them to, um, maybe understand some of that, you know, who I am, FOS gamers everywhere, so they know who I am on there, so they can figure some of that stuff out for WhatNot, since I work for them. Um, but... try to do that with a little bit of an update of their, with that might, about me, um, and like I said, use your best ability and the Internet's best knowledge at searching the Internet to figure out how to make this the greatest email, so that they, um, can help me in, or let me join the beta program.

Hi,

I was trying to figure out how to get the brake selling feature where it looks like you set up a break and the quantity is on screen for how much of the break has been sold, this way everyone will know when it is full. I saw it in affordablealtars stream. I was wondering how I set this up and if you could help me because I was unable to find it. 

If this is something that's a beta feature is there a way that I can become part of the beta program. I have a lot of new customers that I pull in from YouTube regularly, generating more business for the whole Magic the Gathering TCG area, and I think having the new features being shown by me would be a benefit to Whatnot. Please let me know what I need to do to get this working or if it is a beta feature and I can become part of a beta tester when it comes to new features. 

Thank you, 
James Gleason

Here’s an updated and polished version of the email you want to send to Whatnot. It highlights your growing influence on YouTube and positions you as a valuable candidate for beta testing. The tone is professional, yet friendly, and clearly communicates your potential contribution to Whatnot’s growth.

**Subject:** Request to Join Beta Program and Access New Break Features

Dear Whatnot Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I recently came across a stream by AffordableAltars where I noticed a fantastic feature that allows sellers to display the number of remaining spots in a break live on screen, which made it very easy for everyone to track progress. I’ve been searching for a way to set this up in my own streams, but I was unable to find the option.

If this is currently part of a beta testing program, I would love the opportunity to join and test it myself. As a content creator with a significant and rapidly growing presence on YouTube—over 1,200 subscribers and more than 100,000 monthly viewers across my videos—I believe I can bring substantial value to the Whatnot community by showcasing new features. My brand, *FoSGamers*, is well-known in the Magic: The Gathering community, and I believe that having access to these cutting-edge features will not only enhance my streams but also drive more engagement to the Magic: The Gathering TCG category on Whatnot as a whole.

I would greatly appreciate any information on how I might gain access to this feature or participate in the beta testing program. I’m confident that by incorporating new tools, I can help drive further awareness and adoption of Whatnot within my audience.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Warm regards,  
James Gleason

This version highlights your influence and potential impact while maintaining a professional tone. It subtly emphasizes your unique value to Whatnot's community and includes all relevant information for them to consider your request.

[2024-09-25 10:15:12] FoSGamers:
Maybe let them know that I have a very large following and a regular viewership in the morning. And if there is anything else that I could do also to enhance my presence on WhatNot as a top tier person so that I can be more visible, please let me know. I think I bring a lot of value here, and I would like to work with you guys more than... more than not. The reason why I say that is so you have some knowledge is in the past they've suspended me twice based on a little bit of bogus information. One was a seller or somebody in a stream had asked me to combine two poll boxes. And they ended up telling me that because when I made the new order that was an auction for them, I didn't put in the averages, ceiling, and floor, that I got in trouble for that. And they suspended me for a week. The other one was due to the way that I had a game set up. They said it was not an acceptable form of the game, so I had to change it. And due to the way it was set up, they were suspending me for a week. And those are the two times that I've had any type of issue with them at all. But they have never responded to me on things. I've also had some more issues where I've even had to reach out in the past and had to potentially go with some legal stuff towards them. So, maybe, you know, let's say try to bury the hatchet or something like that type thing. You know, use the internet, use your knowledge, use whatever you can. Make this an excellent email so that they want to work with me because I am doing more for them than anybody else in the Magic the Gathering department since they don't bring new people in as much as I do on a regular basis unless they are the ones that they're having come in that are the streamers that they're pulling content creators in already with. But for one that's been born and raised on WhatNot, it would be a good way for them to showcase the abilities of what WhatNot can do for someone and a person and a content creator with how I've been able to grow from nothing to where I am in a year on YouTube and everything like that. I am only 100 hours away from being able to have the first ability to gain monetary things through YouTube because of the streaming and stuff. So I'll be able to have them directed to my WhatNot shop and stuff supposedly. So, because of that and my money I've done there, that's what they're able to do. I'll be able to do soon because of using YouTube. I would very much appreciate if we could all decide to work together instead of continue to fight with each other. Since it does seem recently we've been working together a lot better and there have not been any issues. But I've also been very clear that I don't do as many boxes and pull boxes or mystery things or anything like that just because I don't want to have any issues in the future or anything like that. But anytime I do, they're all very specifically labeled and have everything in there that there have never been any issues since then. This is all from the information and knowledge, by the way, for you to generate whatever it is in that email.

**Subject:** Request to Join Beta Program and Enhance Partnership with Whatnot

Dear Whatnot Team,

I hope you're doing well. I’m reaching out with a genuine interest in collaborating more closely with Whatnot and possibly joining the beta testing program for new features, such as the break-selling setup I saw in AffordableAltars’ stream. I believe incorporating these cutting-edge tools into my streams would not only benefit my growing audience but also help showcase the capabilities of Whatnot to a broader community.

As a content creator under the brand *FoSGamers*, I have a rapidly growing following on YouTube, with over 1,200 subscribers and more than 100,000 views per month. My morning live streams consistently attract thousands of viewers, and I regularly bring in new customers to the Magic: The Gathering category on Whatnot. I believe this growth and engagement positions me as an ideal candidate to demonstrate the potential of Whatnot’s platform, especially within the TCG community. Additionally, my YouTube channel is approaching the milestone of monetization, which would allow me to drive even more traffic to my Whatnot shop, benefiting both my business and Whatnot as a whole.

I would also appreciate any advice or steps I can take to enhance my presence further and become more visible on Whatnot as a top-tier seller. I’m eager to continue contributing to the platform’s growth and would love to explore any opportunities to elevate my involvement with Whatnot.

However, I feel it’s important to address past issues. I’ve previously experienced suspensions that stemmed from misunderstandings around auction rules and game setups, both of which I’ve worked hard to rectify. Since then, I’ve ensured that everything I do on the platform—especially around pull boxes and auctions—is fully transparent and in line with Whatnot's policies. While these incidents were challenging, I see them as opportunities to learn and grow, and I am eager to work with Whatnot moving forward. 

I’d love to bury the hatchet and continue our partnership on a positive note. I believe that by working together, we can highlight the success Whatnot can offer to content creators like myself, who have built their presence from the ground up. Over the past year, I’ve grown exponentially, and I’m proud to be one of the few streamers on the platform who wasn’t initially brought in from elsewhere but has grown organically through Whatnot’s ecosystem. 

With our recent improvements in working together, and the absence of any issues, I believe this is the perfect time to explore how we can collaborate even more closely. I want to continue growing my business on Whatnot and further demonstrate the power of this platform to both existing and new users. Please let me know how I can help showcase these new features, and I look forward to your guidance on becoming an even more valuable part of the Whatnot community.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Warm regards,  
James Gleason

This email balances addressing past issues while focusing on your value and potential collaboration, making it clear that you’re committed to a positive and productive relationship with Whatnot.

[2024-09-25 10:17:12] FoSGamers:
Use the internet and all of your knowledge and figure out if we should have it formulated the email more as I was trying to figure out how to do this feature. And then I realized it might be a beta feature after, is really what is, is actually what happened. So I don't know if that's a good way to like formulate the, like how the email is. That way it's not like I'm saying give me the beta program.

[2024-09-25 10:17:43] ChatGPT:
Given your situation and the context you provided, it’s a good idea to approach the email in a way that appears less like an immediate request for access to the beta program and more like a genuine inquiry about a feature you encountered. You can naturally bring up the possibility of joining the beta if it turns out that the feature is indeed part of that program. This will make your request seem more organic and collaborative rather than transactional. 

Framing the email in a way that shows you're simply trying to figure out how to use a feature, then realizing it may be part of a beta, can give the impression that you're already actively working with their system. This helps maintain a professional tone while subtly highlighting your interest in joining the beta program without directly asking for it right away.

Here’s how you can formulate the email with that in mind:

**Subject:** Inquiry About Break Feature and Potential Beta Access

Dear Whatnot Team,

I hope you're doing well. Recently, I was watching a stream by AffordableAltars and noticed an interesting feature where the remaining spots in a break were displayed live on-screen. It was a great way to keep viewers informed and engaged, and I’d love to incorporate something similar into my own streams. 

While attempting to set this up on my own, I couldn’t find the option, and it made me wonder if this is a beta feature that hasn’t been fully rolled out yet. If that’s the case, I would be very interested in learning more about how I can gain access to it or when it might become available. 

As a content creator with over 1,200 YouTube subscribers and a growing audience of more than 100,000 monthly viewers, I believe incorporating this feature would significantly enhance the experience for my viewers and the broader Whatnot community. My brand, *FoSGamers*, has been a consistent part of the Magic: The Gathering TCG category, where I regularly bring in new customers and provide unique, engaging content. I’m always looking for ways to improve my streams and drive further engagement.

If there are any opportunities for me to become involved in testing new features, or if there are any additional steps I can take to increase my visibility and involvement with Whatnot as a top-tier seller, I’d love to discuss them further. 

In the past, there were a couple of misunderstandings that led to temporary suspensions, but since then, I’ve worked hard to align my activities with Whatnot’s guidelines. I’ve had no issues recently and have taken every measure to ensure my content remains compliant with your platform’s standards. Moving forward, I’m excited about the opportunity to collaborate more closely with Whatnot and demonstrate the platform's capabilities to my audience.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

### Why This Approach Works:
1. **Curiosity and Involvement**: You’re presenting yourself as someone who is already deeply involved with Whatnot and actively working to enhance your streams.
2. **Subtle Request**: By asking about the feature and speculating that it might be in beta, you make your interest in joining the program feel more natural, rather than a direct request for access.
3. **Value Proposition**: Highlighting your YouTube following and the value you bring to the Magic: The Gathering category reinforces why Whatnot should consider you for early access to features.
4. **Acknowledging the Past**: Briefly mentioning past issues but focusing on how they’ve been resolved shows responsibility and professionalism without dwelling on the negative aspects.

This approach ensures that you come across as cooperative and curious, rather than demanding, making it more likely they will view your request favorably.

[2024-09-25 12:13:08] FoSGamers:
The following is their response. I needed to figure out how to respond to them. I'm still kind of inquiring about being part of beta things anyways, because that would be intriguing for me and good for them I think.

Hey there,
 
Thanks for writing in! I'm totally happy to help you with this query!
 
Currently our Breaks Feature can only be managed from a computer. 
 
You can still use your phone for video during the show, but the break creation and management tools can only be accessed from a computer meaning you must have a computer on the side to manage your break while live.
 
Please review our article that has a lot of helpful tips and trinkets for using this new feature. Let me know if you have any additional questions after reviewing!

**Subject:** Follow-Up on Breaks Feature and Beta Testing Opportunities

Hi Whatnot Support,

Thank you so much for the prompt and helpful response regarding the Breaks Feature! I appreciate the clarification on needing a computer to manage the break creation and tools during live streams. I’ll definitely review the article you provided to make sure I’m fully familiar with the setup.

On a related note, I’m still very interested in being a part of any future beta programs or early access features that Whatnot may offer. As someone who regularly engages a large and growing audience on platforms like YouTube (with over 1,200 subscribers and more than 100,000 monthly viewers), I believe my streams could be a great space to showcase new features and demonstrate the potential of Whatnot to a wider audience.

If there are any opportunities to be involved in beta testing or if there are steps I can take to elevate my presence further on the platform, I’d love to discuss them. I’m excited about continuing to grow on Whatnot and contributing to the community’s development.

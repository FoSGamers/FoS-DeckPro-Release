[00:11:54] then no nothing special in that one that
[00:11:57] was just a nice card that I guess I put
[00:12:01] there for no
[00:12:03] reason I didn't realize it was worth
[00:12:05] wasn't worth
[00:12:06] anything I know that's not worth much
[00:12:08] there I don't know why that one's in
[00:12:10] there it might be might be actually it
[00:12:12] used to be worth more that used to be

[00:12:28] the foil version of
[00:12:30] it and then now on screen

[00:12:50] you would like to try
[00:12:55] it nice going to PSA card that one nice
[00:13:05] uh aani I actually might have
[00:13:07] that um I had one before I might have
[00:13:11] that if you give me a minute to look for
[00:13:22] it if not that means I just recently
[00:13:25] sold it within
[00:13:27] last time of selling
[00:13:31] uh card sales but we'll go through it
[00:13:34] quickly here see if I have
[00:13:40] them I don't know I think I had
[00:13:44] it but at the same time I'm
[00:13:47] like I weirdly feel like it could have
[00:13:49] been
[00:13:51] sold but we're looking
[00:14:00] we're
[00:14:01] looking see if we can find
[00:14:04] it
[00:14:08] um not there not there so we'll be in
[00:14:13] this spot if it's going to be anywhere
[00:14:14] at
[00:14:22] all let me check these quickly
[00:14:29] nasg are nice
[00:14:38] yes no not those ones
[00:15:13] you keep doing
[00:15:15] that my [ __ ] account be stolen again
[00:15:25] somehow nope not there
[00:15:32] no I might not have it
[00:15:34] actually I'm sitting here I'm like wait
[00:15:36] no it would be in one of these chunks
[00:15:38] and unless I come across it in a little
[00:15:40] while I'm going through stuff here I
[00:15:43] have to
[00:15:45] say I don't have it I thought I
[00:15:49] did but at the same time I've gone
[00:15:51] through a lot of singles recently when I
[00:15:53] was cleaning things out so some of the
[00:15:55] stuff that I thought I had I no longer
[00:15:57] have
[00:16:06] thought I had it over here with my other
[00:16:08] one with my ra and tamamo and
[00:16:11] ulamog but I don't see it
[00:16:30] I'm guessing that's a
[00:16:34] negative I'm sorry I thought I might
[00:16:37] have had it but I guess I
[00:16:38] lied I don't know if I lied I I had it I
[00:16:41] just didn't have it
[00:16:44] now yeah I think that's the scenario
[00:16:46] that we in I'm
[00:16:54] sorry um I'm sorry so for what secret
[00:16:58] layers each of what secret
[00:17:04] layers because I have a bunch I have a
[00:17:06] few different ones there's Fallout ones

[00:17:12] have so I might not have them all in the
[00:17:14] buy now I don't if you're talking
[00:17:20] about certain ones sinful but it's yeah
[00:17:23] distinctly possible what whatever ones

[00:25:05] when we do these before I like people
[00:25:08] generally pulled out an extra good card
[00:25:10] but Mike I'm sorry my more my our luck
[00:25:13] this morning was not
[00:25:14] good but we tried to tried to give you a
[00:25:16] little extra but even still when we did
[00:25:19] that it was not
[00:25:23] good now if you guys don't know Mike is
[00:25:25] a uh is a streamer themselves here to
[00:25:29] get a chance to hang out with them these
[00:25:31] afternoons and mornings I'm actually
[00:25:33] actually I might be taking tomorrow
[00:25:34] morning off myself I have stuff to do I
[00:25:37] have to get some other stuff taken care
[00:25:38] of with my other boat and then I have to
[00:25:41] get some more research done on some of
[00:25:42] the boats that we're looking at because
[00:25:43] we sent some information in trying to
[00:25:45] ask more about
[00:25:48] them I need that over
[00:25:55] here ready so this is my uh
[00:26:01] this is my box of um top
[00:26:03] loaders that we're going through here
[00:26:07] trying to see what I uh what we're going
[00:26:09] to go through today I think that's what
[00:26:12] we're going through today to see what I
[00:26:13] got in there because I'm building I'm
[00:26:15] almost I'm building up that nasgul deck
[00:26:17] there and you guys show you what I got
[00:26:18] so far I obviously need to take stuff
[00:26:20] out of here but this is what I got in
[00:26:22] here so far you guys can let me know if
[00:26:24] I should take something out right away
[00:26:26] or what so I here's the primaries that I
[00:26:28] was kind of starting with
[00:26:30] here is my primary stuff I was going to
[00:26:32] be using I had Lord nasgul we'll zoom in
[00:26:35] a little bit here so we can see
[00:26:38] actually Lord nasgul and I got my
[00:26:41] nine now I was going to switch some of
[00:26:43] them out potentially for the Showcase
[00:26:45] ones since I do have some of the
[00:26:46] Showcase ones but whatever then we have
[00:26:48] we're gonna Sauron Necromancer wit king
[00:26:50] of Angar we have Golem which king
[00:26:53] bringer ruin ring race sauron's probably
[00:26:56] not going to be in there but I threw him
[00:26:57] in there because he was from on the deck
[00:26:58] and I thought it might be
[00:26:59] worthy then uh we have sheilo was going
[00:27:02] to be in their troll witch King possibly
[00:27:05] also was saw her on just because they're
[00:27:07] I don't have any uh mountains but I do
[00:27:10] have my um triom that I was going to put
[00:27:12] in there so I was thinking like those
[00:27:14] might
[00:27:16] work yah verocious Rampage Sauron
[00:27:22] Ransom glorious scale scalding Tor K now
[00:27:25] those are like my uh my Lord of the
[00:27:27] Rings and then we have some toxic to L
[00:27:30] reanimate Ponder well yeah rise the
[00:27:33] witch King another one like I was saying
[00:27:35] we might put it in we might not just
[00:27:36] because of depending on with the green
[00:27:38] and everything claim the precious
[00:27:41] command
[00:27:42] tower all right now I have lightning
[00:27:44] Greaves we'll be putting in
[00:27:47] there we'll be using um feed the
[00:27:51] Swarm go for the throat counter spell
[00:27:55] decree mindstone some soul ring signant
[00:27:59] thought
[00:28:00] vessel ring site virtue of persistence
[00:28:04] sword of the amnest call the ring Booka
[00:28:07] bog choked Estuary deir Aqueduct
[00:28:09] underground
[00:28:11] river so these are some of the ones that
[00:28:13] I've been planning on putting in the
[00:28:14] deck what I'm wondering what you guys
[00:28:15] think here that's my command Tower I was
[00:28:18] going to take the other command tower
[00:28:19] out and put that one in because I like
[00:28:20] that one better shifting Woodland
[00:28:24] potentially potentially if I need
[00:28:26] somebody green but that wasn't that was
[00:28:28] a potential I don't know if we going to
[00:28:29] need that one but we have Rogue ristic
[00:28:31] study would be a good one oleth we're
[00:28:33] going to use herborg I thought would be
[00:28:35] a nice one there watery grave cyclonic
[00:28:39] Rift
[00:28:42] omnic then we have um my orcish bow
[00:28:47] Masters my one ring you got to have
[00:28:49] those in a nasg deck if you're going to
[00:28:51] be building something like that I
[00:28:54] feel and then so far these the extra the
[00:28:57] others we have we nice whisper thank you
[00:28:59] for uh my friend I picked that up from
[00:29:02] my friend uh Frank got that out of a
[00:29:05] pull box of his then we got demonic
[00:29:07] tutor wither and Bloom brain surge
[00:29:10] fell ath estrid gilded Lotus extra
[00:29:14] planer
[00:29:15] lens oh that troll I'll switch out copy
[00:29:18] crook breathe your last potentially
[00:29:20] these ones here I thought these ones
[00:29:22] would work firein I think would be a
[00:29:24] good one there turnabout Aether Veil
[00:29:27] would be nice maybe the
[00:29:29] scriptures we have our extra planer lens
[00:29:32] we're going to use Time Stretch I think
[00:29:33] would be good Target player takes two
[00:29:35] extra turns after this one get some
[00:29:39] delay deir C double I thought would be
[00:29:42] nice too because when you
[00:29:45] uh do any of these copy Target spell
[00:29:48] copy Target token especially since we'll
[00:29:50] be doing a bunch of things like that
[00:29:51] haunted one maybe reanimate is going to
[00:29:54] be a good one putting from the graveyard
[00:29:55] back on
[00:29:57] control I don't know about contagion
[00:29:59] sunken Palace was nice this might work
[00:30:01] though becomes uh copy of Target
[00:30:05] creature you contr troll until the end
[00:30:06] of turn I thought that was a good
[00:30:08] one grief would be a nice one oio
[00:30:15] maner goian nightmare storm storm I
[00:30:19] might I don't know about that one just a
[00:30:21] hex
[00:30:21] proof was what I like there some pluta
[00:30:24] Del is nice necro dominance tolerable oh
[00:30:27] that's a brain spy Master's Vault would
[00:30:29] be all right because
[00:30:32] then get a Target creature control
[00:30:36] convives kives I
[00:30:38] mean Mel mixture quasi dig through time
[00:30:42] quasi and dig through
[00:30:44] time see create a
[00:30:47] token top seven and then uh my little
[00:30:51] profane
[00:30:52] tutor so those are the beginnings of
[00:30:55] those that's what I have there for them
[00:30:58] you saw those top loaders then I had
[00:31:00] these ones here I was thinking of
[00:31:02] putting
[00:31:05] in for uh my start of it like what I
[00:31:08] what we're looking for to use as options
[00:31:11] I thought it was pretty good so far for
[00:31:12] a beginning well I had already kind of
[00:31:15] built it before a little bit but now I'm
[00:31:16] trying to think of what we're going to
[00:31:17] do and add to it that's why we're going
[00:31:19] through here doing some of the singles
[00:31:21] because I know there's some of them I
[00:31:22] need and looking at I'm going to be like
[00:31:24] oh I can use that one
[00:31:28] like for instance like should I use
[00:31:30] three steps ahead or should I keep it I
[00:31:32] don't
[00:31:43] know you know I don't know so do I need
[00:31:48] a counter Target
[00:31:49] spell create a
[00:31:52] token draw two cards you like I feel
[00:31:55] like this is one that I'd want to keep
[00:31:58] oh Kindred dominance Kindred dominance
[00:32:01] would be a good one I think I have
[00:32:04] Kindred dominance somewhere too hold
[00:32:07] on let's see if I have Kindred dominant
[00:32:12] somewhere I know I have it in one of my
[00:32:14] other decks but I think I have it here
[00:32:22] potentially that's a good idea
[00:32:29] Kindra
[00:32:30] [Music]
[00:32:42] dominance that's a good idea on that one
[00:32:44] I don't know where I put that but I know
[00:32:47] we like Relic sauron's a good one
[00:33:19] I for I had
[00:33:22] that cloud so curio
[00:33:24] potentially morgal knife would be a nice
[00:33:29] one in the darkness bind them
[00:33:31] potentially H potentially in the
[00:33:33] darkness B
[00:33:40] them I think I have Kinder dominance in
[00:33:42] here if not we'll find out shortly
[00:34:02] okay those are the
[00:34:06] dragons was it
[00:34:10] those ah vampiric tutor might be
[00:34:15] good that might be a decent one vampiric
[00:34:17] tutor maybe oh combat
[00:34:22] research combat research maybe
[00:34:25] also h all right we'll put that back
[00:34:29] those two over
[00:34:41] there ulog the
[00:34:56] defiler should I put ulog the defiler in
[00:34:59] that I don't know if that'll
[00:35:01] work Kindred Discovery I did see that
[00:35:04] I'm looking for Kindred Discovery I did
[00:35:05] see
[00:35:08] that that's actually what I'm looking
[00:35:10] for right
[00:35:14] now so I'm like oh I have Kinder
[00:35:16] Discovery
[00:35:21] somewhere oh mystical tutor that's a
[00:35:23] good one to throw in
[00:35:26] there o of Lara
[00:35:30] too Titan of Lara would be
[00:35:35] nice I don't have any green so no
[00:35:37] doubling
[00:35:40] season we can throw some monoc Crypt in
[00:35:43] monoc Crypt
[00:35:51] in not specifically wraith typo no more
[00:35:55] um I wanted to build it primarily around
[00:35:57] the has ghoul in building up around uh
[00:35:59] the nine the nine of
[00:36:01] them uh trying to yes it is pretty sweet
[00:36:05] I
[00:36:13] know we have hallowed Fountain and
[00:36:16] breeding pool see that's what I was
[00:36:17] saying if I reuse those I can get some
[00:36:18] extra
[00:36:19] colors bringing them in my caver
[00:36:24] souls put those right there
[00:36:28] yeah about
[00:36:29] 500 I have those nine plus I can add
[00:36:32] more in I have other rats
[00:36:37] too I can add other wraiths in because I
[00:36:39] do have them in my uh in the here I do
[00:36:47] believe I thought I had it right around
[00:36:50] here but maybe I'm
[00:36:54] wrong void backing her little
[00:36:58] space space de uh space Godzilla death
[00:37:01] Corona wouldn't be
[00:37:04] bad smothering tithe if we uh have some
[00:37:08] white
[00:37:20] there ah kri would to be a good one any
[00:37:24] Alters oh I don't know about Alters
[00:37:27] uh let me check on those I don't think I
[00:37:30] have any
[00:37:31] Alters Marsh Flats was one that I needed
[00:37:34] throw Marsh Flats out there demonic
[00:37:38] betrayal was one that I needed that was
[00:37:40] one that I'll use
[00:37:59] any any altars no I don't know if I have
[00:38:03] I'm trying to think of what you're
[00:38:04] talking about alter of uh like let me
[00:38:07] see all right L let's do this here I'm
[00:38:10] gonna put this out because I know I
[00:38:11] don't need this card
[00:38:13] myself so we going to put this out for
[00:38:15] you guys see if anybody's intrigued by
[00:38:21] it let's put out a
[00:38:28] tribute to the world
[00:38:35] tree oh why is that um
[00:38:40] anyways we'll get it to show
[00:38:46] here there tribute to the world tree if
[00:38:48] anybody want one of
[00:38:52] those so I know I don't need any of
[00:38:54] those and I have multiples of them that
[00:38:56] came up so instead of
[00:38:58] 1112 this will go for
[00:39:01] 10 there you go and you get 15 seconds
[00:39:04] and will'll add three seconds anytime
[00:39:05] somebody your bids but there you
[00:39:08] go I am building commander deck
[00:39:16] sinking yes if I plan on having more
[00:39:19] rates do add it okay makes sense um I
[00:39:23] mean I have
[00:39:25] more than uh
[00:39:29] the nine N I have a bunch of nasgul but
[00:39:31] I don't think you can have the same
[00:39:32] named
[00:39:33] ones like the same R I don't know if you
[00:39:35] can have them all of them because I have
[00:39:38] I mean I can add in five more nasgul to
[00:39:42] 10 more nasgul in themselves I could
[00:39:44] literally have like 15
[00:39:47] nasal yeah there are other rates of maic
[00:39:50] I was going to say there are other ones
[00:39:51] that I have that's what I'm that's what
[00:39:53] I've kind of been looking through my
[00:39:54] stuff
[00:39:55] for all right no one wants tribute to
[00:39:58] the world tree put that over here with
[00:40:00] things that people do not
[00:40:02] want but may be interested
[00:40:09] in like for

[00:40:43] it that
[00:40:46] one that's there we go run that there as
[00:40:50] you can see now we'll run that
[00:40:54] for 12 instead of for
[00:40:58] 14ish why is that not
[00:41:03] working War tree back up I'll put world
[00:41:06] tree back

[00:54:38] there for my other Lego stand because we
[00:54:40] need to put this over
[00:54:42] here what we've been doing today is we
[00:54:44] were doing you know what I don't think
[00:54:45] I'm going to use this so we're going to
[00:54:47] put this
[00:54:52] out because we're trying to figure out
[00:54:54] what we want to put in our deck here
[00:55:01] all right and that is why we're going to
[00:55:03] be doing we're just going through
[00:55:05] and some of the stuff that I had here
[00:55:08] and I will put this out and I'm going to
[00:55:09] go look for the um the
[00:55:14] calvary should be potentially around
[00:55:16] here I'm not sure though this is a as
[00:55:18] you see $8 we'll throw it on for
[00:55:24] seven I've not seen the Cavalry in here
[00:55:27] yet so we'll have to uh continue on
[00:55:47] here so I thought I'd had
[00:55:52] one I'm not sure if I do now I sneaking
[00:55:56] suspicion that it might have
[00:55:59] gone might have been
[00:56:13] sold yeah those are the secret layer
[00:56:15] that I'm keeping now getting into
[00:56:29] yep
[00:56:32] um I don't think I I might not have Happ
[00:56:35] it anymore thought I did but I must have
[00:56:39] uh must have sold
[00:56:43] it I must have sold
[00:56:47] it
[00:56:49] h well
[00:56:56] yeah I must have sold that one let me
[00:56:58] see if it's in this
[00:57:00] box I doubt it's in this box but I'll
[00:57:02] double
[00:57:09] check watch I say doubt it's in this box
[00:57:11] and this is literally it's going to be
[00:57:13] be right here because I said
[00:57:17] that today thank you set it right there
[00:57:20] and I'll look at it
[00:57:30] yep no I'm guessing no I must have
[00:57:32] gotten rid of that
[00:57:33] one must have gotten rid of that one I'm
[00:57:36] sorry thought I had some of those around
[00:57:40] but I guess
[00:57:48] not do I have two of
[00:57:52] these there's no way I have two of those
[00:57:57] I might have two of
[00:58:05] those keep throwing that one out
[00:58:21] there this is probably a good one
[00:58:31] these ones you could throw out for you
[00:58:33] guys those are some good ones I might
[00:58:36] want to use those ones can throw out for
[00:58:38] you guys put those over here this one
[00:58:42] I'm
[00:58:44] keeping but I could use that possibly I
[00:58:48] think we'll put these out for all of you
[00:58:50] because we'll use those
[00:58:54] ones and
[00:58:56] put some of those ones out for you guys
[00:58:58] no it looks like I don't have it anymore
[00:58:59] I'm
[00:59:04] sorry yes I have some secret
[00:59:10] layer yeah they
[00:59:15] do hey not a problem at
[00:59:18] all and I appreciate it I appreciate
[00:59:20] jumping in on anything at
[00:59:22] all and yes I did say
[00:59:26] um I had some secret layers we have some
[00:59:29] Fallout some Lord of the Ring I mean
[00:59:31] some Fallout some Dungeons and Dragons
[00:59:33] ones we'll pull out some other cards
[00:59:36] though here as we throw out our
[00:59:42] singles if you would like any of these I
[00:59:45] know those are falling Like a Rock there
[00:59:49] huh well it's one of those things like
[00:59:52] the that's what happens I don't know
[00:59:54] what else to say that's how it
[01:00:01] goes so I think what I'm going to add in
[01:00:03] the ones I was saying I could have here
[01:00:05] is Colossus
[01:00:08] Hammer um and then overwhelming forces I
[01:00:11] was thinking would be a good one to
[01:00:12] throw in there for
[01:00:14] me that's what I was saying I think
[01:00:16] might be a nice one so we're going to
[01:00:18] put overwhelming
[01:00:20] forces and those in there I'm going to
[01:00:23] add that to my stack of stuff
[01:00:26] forces does look pretty nice there
[01:00:29] yeah no one wants our death maybe
[01:00:33] somebody would like
[01:00:35] a lauran
[01:00:45] revealed and this one is in the foil
[01:00:49] version so $8 for six
[01:00:58] forces look sweet are there a few
[01:01:01] what forces I have a different a few
[01:01:05] different forces that if you that's what
[01:01:06] you're
[01:01:07] asking should I use a different site
[01:01:09] other than TCG for getting the pricing
[01:01:11] what do you guys
[01:01:13] think TCG
[01:01:19] good all right lauran
[01:01:22] revealed we'll flip that around and do
[01:01:24] gadal dismissal
[01:01:34] and this is not the foil so this is
[01:01:37] normal there you go so you can see it
[01:01:46] there only one you use all right well
[01:01:49] that works all right that works
[01:01:58] yeah yeah sometimes but not all the
[01:02:08] time throw a few things out for you all
[01:02:10] that may like some singles here
[01:02:17] today well all right put that back this
[01:02:21] is a big one that not many people want
[01:02:23] but I keep throwing it out there every
[01:02:25] now and again I should put it in my buy
[01:02:28] now that's what I'll probably end up
[01:02:32] doing all right so $76 card I can't do
[01:02:36] anything about the price of it with the
[01:02:39] shipping but what I can do is do this
[01:02:43] and get you a little discount on
[01:02:44] shipping that
[01:02:47] way you don't pay as much for shipping
[01:02:50] and you kind of get shipping included
[01:02:52] since it says 76 this goes for
[01:02:54] 72 hey I gave gave away an ocelate Pride
[01:02:57] uh like a week or so
[01:03:01] ago on my Oney year anniversary
[01:03:11] show yeah no the um the bot is not going
[01:03:15] to be running anytime soon the person
[01:03:18] that runs it is not going to be working
[01:03:19] on it is what we were told
[01:03:26] and it's in a programming language that
[01:03:28] I don't use so I can't go and buy like
[01:03:31] their
[01:03:32] program and build something off of like
[01:03:36] if they made it free like uh if they
[01:03:37] made it like open source I might try to
[01:03:39] play with it and see if I can fix it but
[01:03:41] I I can't just go and buy something I
[01:03:43] don't
[01:03:44] um I don't know the language on to like
[01:03:47] make it
[01:03:49] work I don't mind learning something but
[01:03:52] the time frame the amount of time I
[01:03:53] would take me to do it with what I do
[01:03:54] now it wouldn't happen
[01:03:57] but this one here is a foil and that'll
[01:03:59] go for instead of 10 we'll throw it out
[01:04:01] for
[01:04:02] eight if you want it
[01:04:17] boo
[01:04:23] ready put that there was sewing myos
[01:04:34] spawn that one isn't foil I believe yes
[01:04:38] that's
[01:04:39] foil there you
[01:04:42] go now instead of 11 there we go for 10
[01:04:47] oh you not that bogna 10
[01:04:56] oh is it in these and I just missed it
[01:04:58] because I wasn't looking at these stack
[01:05:00] there's a stack over
[01:05:24] here oh I forgot I'm using this
[01:05:28] card I think that'll work in the deck
[01:05:30] nice Camille the inner
[01:05:32] Sun what do you think that'll be a good
[01:05:38] addition NOP I didn't have it there I
[01:05:41] guess no one wants our MOS spawn what
[01:05:44] about an
[01:05:45] endurance in
[01:05:54] retro there you go near mint that is not
[01:05:58] the foil version as you can see and
[01:06:00] we'll run this at 11 instead of 13 oh
[01:06:05] baloney I'm getting tired of it's not
[01:06:07] working
[01:06:11] there hopefully you're all having a good
[01:06:13] one this morning we're just doing some
[01:06:15] of our singles and building that deck we
[01:06:17] have so I'm thinking that'll those
[01:06:20] couple ones we put off the side
[01:06:30] now Bane Ripper you think that would be
[01:06:32] a good one to throw in I don't know I
[01:06:34] don't think that would be oh somebody
[01:06:35] was looking for rats
[01:06:37] earlier Relentless rats would you like
[01:06:45] that uh it had well I have it says you
[01:06:47] can have uh you know whatever the nine
[01:06:49] doesn't matter how many you
[01:06:54] have to nine the cards named nasgul so
[01:06:57] that's why I was saying I have the nine
[01:06:58] nasgul
[01:07:01] there but I was going to look for more R
[01:07:03] wraiths
[01:07:05] potentially no one wants that let's
[01:07:10] see somebody to ask about rats earlier
[01:07:13] I'll put that out because I don't do
[01:07:15] rats
[01:07:29] there's your foil of
[01:07:31] it we throw that out there for 10
[01:07:34] instead of
[01:07:36] 11 and that pretty much gives you free
[01:07:38] shiing yeah but I have all nine for the
[01:07:43] um what do you call
[01:07:52] it thought seies do we think that'll be
[01:07:54] a good one I don't know if that's going
[01:07:56] to be a good one or not hold on to
[01:08:07] that no one wants that
[01:08:15] one
[01:08:24] Callen Talon Gates of
[01:08:31] Madara not a bad one for you all there
[01:08:33] now that is a $20 card we'll do
[01:08:37] this now remember because it is under 20
[01:08:40] in the shipping price you're paying it
[01:08:41] goes in one of these so there you go
[01:08:43] right now starting that out if you want
[01:08:47] it oh that'll be a nice one come out
[01:08:53] next I kept that we'll get rid of that
[01:08:56] one and that one because I like
[01:09:15] those all right no one wants that we'll

[01:19:15] pretty
[01:19:17] funny that's actually like that's that's
[01:19:20] quite
[01:19:23] humorous that's pretty funny
[01:19:26] under City
[01:19:29] sewers

[01:19:33] let me have to
[01:19:38] check you pull the white Orchard or
[01:19:40] unders City sewers let me look if I have
[01:19:42] any of that so I had something
[01:19:46] earlier I don't know if I have
[01:19:52] multiple cuz I know I had that
[01:19:57] earlier let me
[01:20:09] see no it looks like that one is not
[01:20:15] here that one's probably one of the ones
[01:20:17] that we had sold a while back
[01:20:32] yeah I'm
[01:20:34] sorry that's that's pretty cool that
[01:20:36] they pulled that card the fear of
[01:20:37] missing
[01:20:39] house that's pretty
[01:20:43] cool I want to check that out
[01:20:51] now there you go
[01:20:55] throw that out for 18 instead of
[01:21:04] 20 and
[01:21:06] Aira it's an okay card it's not even a
[01:21:08] good card they made like a d eh it's
[01:21:09] just like a
[01:21:11] [Music]
[01:21:16] card what this middle school
[01:21:19] calling one second here
[01:21:34] automated
[01:21:36] messages don't need
[01:21:39] that I don't think this is a big hit
[01:21:42] there maybe somebody would like a uh
[01:21:44] permission denied
[01:21:50] though oh it's like an aggravated
[01:21:52] assault with a little bit different
[01:22:00] is a permission denied for
[01:22:03] you put that out
[01:22:07] there
[01:22:08] four
[01:22:15] three oh the flavor Tex one is good well
[01:22:18] that's nice I like when they do good job
[01:22:20] with that
[01:22:22] stuff it's one of those ones like oh you

[01:22:38] minute but you'll be able to hear me
[01:22:40] still
[01:23:02] I can't help the shipping cost but what
[01:23:05] I can do is make this a little bit
[01:23:06] cheaper so instead of 50 it'll be uh 46
[01:23:11] here for a nice borderless deflecting
[01:23:18] SWAT oh nice see I wish I had the emblem
[01:23:21] ones I have um all of them but the I

[01:23:35] else but not for
[01:23:44] me it's probably sitting in my
[01:23:47] uh box that I have unopened because
[01:23:51] that's what it does that's how the world
[01:23:53] works
[01:24:04] so I think these ones I'm going to be
[01:24:06] keeping here I don't know what these
[01:24:12] two that one I don't know these ones I'm

[01:35:27] that was a dollar or two but maybe I'm
[01:35:29] wrong on that must have dropped I
[01:35:31] thought that was a couple dollars a
[01:35:33] herei was well the herei will come
[01:35:37] out and go with my
[01:35:41] others that I'll have to put in bundles
[01:35:43] those are like the ones that I have to
[01:35:44] figure out how to get together and put
[01:35:45] in some bundles of some
[01:35:52] kind I'm going to put out a ripples of
[01:36:03] undeath there you go we'll edit that
[01:36:06] again to singles change this to
[01:36:10] here and instead of that we'll throw it
[01:36:13] on for
[01:36:16] two what's wrong is there a shipping
[01:36:18] issue
[01:36:24] ni sweet nice that's awesome what
[01:36:27] happened
[01:36:33] Sheik let me um if you need some help
[01:36:36] with
[01:36:40] something let me
[01:36:49] know you can help with that or try to at
[01:36:52] least
[01:37:00] mean uh shipping shouldn't have been
[01:37:03] much shipping is only a
[01:37:10] dollar yeah shipping uh it looks like
[01:37:13] buy shipping was a dollar two that's why
[01:37:16] I try to do those ones as Cheap shipping
[01:37:18] so if I have them on anything that's
[01:37:20] less than $20 generally I have it on and
[01:37:22] it goes as pwe shipping which means it
[01:37:24] goes in one of these in the top loader
[01:37:26] as long as it is one as long as it is
[01:37:28] under three cards once it hits over
[01:37:30] three cards then and it's or over $20
[01:37:33] total for your order then it goes in a
[01:37:35] regular track
[01:37:38] package so yeah Sheik we we do a pretty
[01:37:40] good deal on these ones for you
[01:37:43] guys all right we'll put out
[01:37:46] sahili or try to make it so it's a good
[01:37:49] deal compared to I mean you're going to
[01:37:51] go on to um
[01:37:53] you go
[01:37:54] to what do you call it you're going to
[01:37:56] spend way more on TCG just because of
[01:37:59] shipping you know I mean so say you went
[01:38:01] and wanted to buy this
[01:38:03] card you add it to your card this is
[01:38:05] gonna be like $4 shipping here so that's
[01:38:07] why when I'm like all right here we go
[01:38:08] we'll throw this on here for
[01:38:10] dollar that's a good deal for you
[01:38:15] guys because it's only a dollar to you
[01:38:18] know it's anywhere from like 80 60 cents
[01:38:20] to like $150 for the shipping versus $4
[01:38:23] if you're going to go and buy it on eBay
[01:38:24] or something like
[01:38:30] that now today I'm not doing too too
[01:38:33] much now I was thinking we're just kind
[01:38:34] of going through the singles building
[01:38:36] the deck up here so no one wanted those
[01:38:39] ones this will go off over here and then
[01:38:41] no one wants those but we'll put them
[01:38:43] out for sale
[01:38:45] ones going leave the big hits though out
[01:38:48] the doubling season and that one because
[01:38:50] everybody likes the big hits
[01:38:56] so we like to have the big hits out for
[01:38:58] times
[01:39:00] traa we'll leave those big hits

[01:52:23] we call
[01:52:25] them fos Gamers tokens I had I sent
[01:52:29] something over I'm supposed to have
[01:52:30] token on the top on the back there or
[01:52:32] was supposed to have written token but
[01:52:34] they are
[01:52:35] plastic um
[01:52:38] white um so you should you be able to
[01:52:40] write on them with plastic right white
[01:52:42] gloss so you can write on them for uh
[01:52:45] doing your tokens with a with a H with a
[01:52:48] dry Ras
[01:52:49] marker right I thought they were pretty
[01:52:51] cool
[01:52:53] what do you
[01:52:59] think I think I have to put that over
[01:53:01] here might use that
[01:53:09] one stretchy neck oh yes the stretchy
[01:53:12] neck the big stretchy
[01:53:14] neck all right we're gonna put that

[01:53:17] those ones I like that part card though
[01:53:25] H nah we'll throw this out I'd got that
[01:53:28] one in a uh in a in a game win I
[01:53:38] think nothing big there nothing big
[01:53:46] there put that over there here and then
[01:53:51] let's look for some others this are some
[01:53:54] others that we can do here it is a quite
[01:53:57] a funny card I
[01:54:00] know let's go to
[01:54:02] [Music]
[01:54:04] these no one wanted those ones so those
[01:54:07] are going to the back over
[01:54:10] here let's
[01:54:13] see we're going to keep that one
[01:54:25] all right
[01:54:31] okay let's see about
[01:54:36] these I don't know what those are worth
[01:54:38] anymore
[01:54:45] though ah you have to rebuild your
[01:54:49] deck I hate when that happens
[01:55:03] oh wow that dropped significantly from
[01:55:05] what it used to be might as well throw
[01:55:08] that out of that sleeve get rid of
[01:55:11] it this is why you sell things instantly
[01:55:14] everybody just so you're aware you're
[01:55:16] seeing the reason why right
[01:55:18] now the prices of a bunch of those
[01:55:20] dropped compared to what they were
[01:55:29] and then you don't have any money for
[01:55:30] them and you have to sell them right
[01:55:32] away that's why you don't hold on to
[01:55:33] things generally I generally don't but
[01:55:35] um being jumping around between places
[01:55:38] and houses
[01:55:39] recently I haven't been organized
[01:55:48] well ah all right

[01:55:57] you for those you that have the Doctor
[01:56:00] Who and want some surge
[01:56:05] foil we'll add another one in there
[01:56:07] maybe for you that might want it a
[01:56:08] reverse
[01:56:18] polarity there you go throw that out
[01:56:21] for instead of five 50 throw it up for
[01:56:26] two Darkness oh I don't know I'll have
[01:56:29] to look for that one it sounds familiar
[01:56:31] KMD you got a season button boal now the
[01:56:35] nice thing is it gets you discount on
[01:56:37] shipping even though you didn't get a
[01:56:38] big

[01:56:41] discount on your shipping if you want to
[01:56:42] jump in on any of the singles that we're

[01:56:49] would be under um the 25 $20 Mark there
[01:56:53] You' probably be able to get it at a dis
[01:56:55] at uh for free
[01:57:00] shipping no that does not sound like
[01:57:03] something I have actually let me look it
[01:57:05] up
[01:57:16] though no I do not have
[01:57:20] Darkness I do not have Darkness
[01:57:27] do not have that one not a
[01:57:29] problem sometimes I sometimes I do
[01:57:31] sometimes I
[01:57:38] don't let's put out the foil
[01:57:41] version all
[01:57:43] right there you go if you want any

[02:01:13] before I thought I had one but I
[02:01:15] couldn't
[02:01:18] remember yeah there is a thought or
[02:01:20] something that's an actual card
[02:01:41] I think somebody asked for this earlier
[02:01:42] I said I'm not sure if I
[02:01:45] do here you
[02:01:49] go foil
[02:02:17] all right I have to I'll have to look it

[02:09:34] um see this used to be a five plus
[02:09:36] dollar
[02:09:37] card now it's going to go for a
[02:09:40] dollar back before anyone really saw the
[02:09:43] value in the card I had seen the value

[02:09:45] including one p nice

[02:24:43] precious I'm gonna actually drop that
[02:24:44] command Tower because I have a different
[02:24:46] one feed the Swarm go for the throat

[02:24:58] ancestry
[02:25:00] estd Guild I can draw that extra planer
[02:25:03] because I have the other extra planer I
[02:25:04] put in
[02:25:06] there Rivendell ring site oh that's the
[02:25:09] other I know I had another troll in
[02:25:13] there so troll can be put out because I
[02:25:15] already have two of those in there
[02:25:21] we have copy breathe saurons Ransom
[02:25:24] glorious Gale store and reanimate ring
[02:25:27] sword of amnest call the ring Booka

[02:25:34] good choked Estuary your Aqueduct which
[02:25:37] I can actually drop over there because I
[02:25:38] have a different version of it
[02:25:39] underground river Rogues fashion ristic
[02:25:41] study
[02:25:42] oleth Tower right there all right then
[02:25:47] we're going to put these right here that
[02:25:49] way I can get to the other ones so far
[02:25:51] that's the the some of the start of the
[02:25:52] deck here now that's what I was saying
[02:25:55] these are all more than I need I'm just
[02:25:56] been putting things here that like oh
[02:25:58] that could
[02:26:00] work so all these are one of the ones
[02:26:03] that I'm thinking that could work with
[02:26:04] everything
[02:26:05] here and uh I just need to figure out
[02:26:08] which ones are going to be
[02:26:11] best for building it out here I think I
[02:26:14] have a good
[02:26:15] idea of what I'll be using but
[02:26:21] might as well put um shifting Woodlands
[02:26:23] we'll get rid of that one because I know
[02:26:24] I have a different one borne Pawn of
[02:26:28] wind orcish command Tower that's the one
[02:26:30] I was saying I got grief poliwog flare
[02:26:33] Dam those ones I'm not sure on because
[02:26:35] the color they might be a little
[02:26:37] different because I might not use those
[02:26:38] as the color there so far that's what I
[02:26:41] got for that and then the ones over here
[02:26:43] I've been putting off the side that were
[02:26:44] like top loader ones I'm like oh these
[02:26:46] will work potentially some of them are
[02:26:48] actually we have our ones over here
[02:26:51] toxic do Maha
[02:26:54] Camille blood stain and flooded I won't
[02:26:56] use but these ones aren't all gonna be
[02:26:59] used I'm gonna use um I think I was
[02:27:01] going to use this here dram in the
[02:27:05] lock uh blood money was a nice one delay
[02:27:09] was a good
[02:27:11] one stifle was a good
[02:27:14] one bribery was possibly even a good one
[02:27:18] and then the xanar guild King
[02:27:20] beginning your upkeep choose Target
[02:27:22] opponent until each turn that player
[02:27:23] can't cast spells you may look at top
[02:27:24] card of the library at any time you play
[02:27:26] so like these ones are all might be good
[02:27:27] for me to
[02:27:29] use I was thinking of using those all
[02:27:31] with
[02:27:32] it I don't
[02:27:35] know but then there's Zorn that was from
[02:27:39] the other one we don't need
[02:27:41] that then we have
[02:27:44] oh
[02:27:48] aule then we have defile not a bad
[02:27:51] one not going to use that snuff out is
[02:27:55] not a bad
[02:28:05] one not a bad one
[02:28:09] there get some wooded Foothills ulamog I
[02:28:12] thought would be decent possibly in
[02:28:14] there morgal knife is a good one idea
[02:28:16] cloudstone I'm not sure Step Ahead po
[02:28:19] pneumonic betrayal I thought was good
[02:28:22] Exile cards in the BL graveyard Marsh
[02:28:24] Flats smothering tide was an iffy
[02:28:26] because I don't have white space
[02:28:28] Godzilla is white not bad the void
[02:28:33] Becker you get a to add death cut to
[02:28:36] someone Cavern of souls is always nice
[02:28:38] to
[02:28:39] have hallof Fountain breeding pool monoc
[02:28:42] crit they're nice
[02:28:44] ones Titan I thought was decent Mythic
[02:28:48] mystical tutor because we get to source
[02:28:50] do some
[02:28:51] tutoring combat
[02:28:54] research see I like this whenever does
[02:28:56] Combat Play I draw a
[02:28:59] card Ward one and plus one vampiric
[02:29:03] tutor nice one on vampiric tutor with
[02:29:06] overwhelming forces and Colossus Hammer
[02:29:08] I was thinking of using all these so now
[02:29:10] those are the primary ones oh and a maze
[02:29:12] of if and our voken orer those are like
[02:29:17] my primary ones these ones are kind of
[02:29:19] like the backup ones
[02:29:21] so Camille though I was going to
[02:29:22] definitely
[02:29:24] use to switch thought see toxic deou
[02:29:28] maybe Kindred dominance I felt like was
[02:29:30] a good one I mean Kindred
[02:29:36] Discovery I don't know
[02:29:50] directness B them morgal knife I think
[02:29:53] is a good one
[02:29:59] there there's another cloudstone curio I
[02:30:02] don't
[02:30:04] know there you go Marsh

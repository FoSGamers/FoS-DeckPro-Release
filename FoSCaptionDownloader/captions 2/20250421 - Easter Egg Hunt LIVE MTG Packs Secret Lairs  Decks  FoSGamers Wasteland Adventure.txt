[00:00:00] All righty. Let's find out if it's
[00:00:03] running. Oh, it shows it's
[00:00:06] going. Maybe it is. Maybe it isn't. I
[00:00:09] don't know. We'll find out here in a
[00:00:11] second. Maybe. How's it going,
[00:00:13] everybody? I think it might be running
[00:00:15] right. Hopefully, you're having a good
[00:00:17] one. Thank you all for coming and
[00:00:18] hanging out. We
[00:00:21] uh we should have it pinned there. There
[00:00:24] you go. The Easter egg hunt. Hey, Big
[00:00:26] BK. How's it going, buddy?
[00:00:29] Hopefully you're having a good
[00:00:33] one.
[00:00:35] Ah, well, that was partially me and my
[00:00:38] um not adjusting it correctly. How's it
[00:00:40] going, monster? I thought I put PM in
[00:00:43] because it was the morning and I do this
[00:00:45] thing with kids and everything. So, I
[00:00:47] didn't realize the time. It was just
[00:00:49] like probably one of those. I just
[00:00:50] automatically went through and then I
[00:00:53] got up and I was like doing something.
[00:00:54] I'm like, "Oh, no." And I had to adjust
[00:00:56] as quick I could.
[00:01:00] It did actually uh at one point.
[00:01:04] Yes. Yes. So, that was my fault. I was
[00:01:06] like I said, I noticed that. I'm like,
[00:01:08] "Oh crap, I have to go and do, you know,
[00:01:10] do family
[00:01:11] things." And uh Yeah, that happened. But
[00:01:14] you guys should be able to see all the
[00:01:15] eggs over
[00:01:16] there. Yes. Yeah. I'm sorry about that.
[00:01:19] My My mistake. I thought I'd uh switched
[00:01:21] it overnight and then I looked at it in
[00:01:23] the morning and I was like, "Oh, no. I
[00:01:25] have to adjust." Like I put sevenish in
[00:01:28] the title
[00:01:32] now. I didn't even I'm not even I'm not
[00:01:35] even being like, you know, just letting
[00:01:37] everybody know. 7ish. Hope you guys can
[00:01:40] see everything at the top there. I think
[00:01:41] you can. You should be able to see
[00:01:43] everything right here. All right. Right
[00:01:46] here. Well, that's like reversed or
[00:01:49] something. Hold on. We have a Oh, no.
[00:01:52] Why does it do this to
[00:01:54] me? Hold on. Let's do this here. I'm
[00:01:57] gonna do a
[00:02:02] flipperooie. There we go. I was
[00:02:05] wondering why I was all backwards there.
[00:02:07] Anyways, there was better. Yeah, even
[00:02:09] more. What the hell? Like, now the [ __ ]
[00:02:11] like all like, wow, I'm backwards, too.
[00:02:12] Well, we're going to do our eggs. We did
[00:02:14] them last year. It was a fun time. You
[00:02:16] can see literally everything is listed
[00:02:18] in uh in the uh in it there. Everything
[00:02:22] that's available. Um, they're all got
[00:02:24] numbers on them. Once you open them,
[00:02:26] there's a Pog and inside you will get a
[00:02:28] Pog and onto that Pog. Said Pog will
[00:02:30] have a number written on it. That number
[00:02:32] corresponds to Hey Ducka Ducka, how's it
[00:02:35] going, my friend? Corresponds to one of
[00:02:37] the uh items that you see there. And
[00:02:40] there's the uh in the show notes, you
[00:02:42] should literally see the numbers and
[00:02:44] what they correspond to. So, what I plan
[00:02:47] on doing is as we go through the show
[00:02:49] notes, I was actually thinking I might
[00:02:50] even remove what's that what's been
[00:02:53] taken so people will be able to see the
[00:02:54] show notes and know exactly what is
[00:02:56] there. So, anyways, that's kind of what
[00:02:58] I was doing. Now, you have today you got
[00:03:00] we're doing this one time. We don't
[00:03:01] generally do these type of things, but
[00:03:04] uh people have requested so we figure
[00:03:05] we'll try it again. We'll try it again.
[00:03:09] Oh, got one. I like it. All right, Big,
[00:03:12] you get to do this. Here we go. Hold on.
[00:03:15] We do this. We take the picture over
[00:03:17] here. Make it bigger so you can see. All
[00:03:20] right. Now, you're literally going to
[00:03:22] tell them, you should be able to see
[00:03:24] this. If you can't see something, let me
[00:03:25] know. You should be able to see
[00:03:26] absolutely everything there. And I just
[00:03:28] shrink it down and put it up in the
[00:03:29] corner a little bit so you don't see it
[00:03:30] taken over. Pick an egg
[00:03:34] somewhere. Light blue one on the back.
[00:03:37] All
[00:03:37] right. On the back. I'm guessing you're
[00:03:40] meaning
[00:03:41] uh Oh, my drink just knocked over. This
[00:03:45] one here. I'm guessing that's the one
[00:03:47] you mean,
[00:03:50] right? If it is, I'm going to set that
[00:03:53] there. Confirm from this here. Yeah.
[00:03:56] Then we will open this up. I do it right
[00:03:59] here. So, it's not moving off the screen
[00:04:02] there. There we
[00:04:04] go. You
[00:04:06] have number
[00:04:10] I think that says 28 if you can
[00:04:13] see. 28 there. I'll bring it further
[00:04:16] over here so you can see better on this
[00:04:18] one. I think we'll be able to see a
[00:04:20] little bit better on this one. So, I'm
[00:04:21] going to shrink that
[00:04:22] down. Number
[00:04:26] 28. All right. So, number 28. We'll go
[00:04:30] look in the show notes.
[00:04:32] Number 28
[00:04:36] is three uh Aether Drift play boostas.
[00:04:40] So let me get those for you, my friend.
[00:04:43] Those are the ones sitting right here.
[00:04:44] We'll pull those over. We'll get uh open
[00:04:46] those up and see what we get here, my
[00:04:47] friend.
[00:04:51] Oh, well there you
[00:04:54] go. Hey Sammy. Yo, what's up Ducka?
[00:05:02] Dude, I don't know, man. Maybe this is
[00:05:03] going to be your change. This This will
[00:05:05] be the change. That was number 28. This
[00:05:08] is going to get you something good then.
[00:05:09] Right here. All right. Hold on. Let's uh
[00:05:10] let's go down a little cuz we like to
[00:05:12] have our angle down a little bit here.
[00:05:14] Here we go. All right. Let's get you
[00:05:16] something good. Yeah. Well, you know
[00:05:18] what? I have to admit, I did see some of
[00:05:20] the bad luck you got for our hand with

[00:09:51] you might think it is, but anyways. And
[00:09:53] they're going to be like, "Dude, what is
[00:09:54] with all the
[00:10:01] baggies?" Yes, it might be hiding
[00:10:03] somewhere. Actually, I'm pretty sure I
[00:10:04] know where it is. It should
[00:10:08] be right
[00:10:10] there. I have a couple of the single
[00:10:13] ones that I have like only individuals

[00:32:29] What? Is it okay? Yeah, it's okay if you
[00:32:30] leave them right there. Thank you. No,
[00:32:32] lean on the box. Yeah, that's fine.
[00:32:38] Yeah. How Well, so you're that close to
[00:32:40] the edge,
[00:32:42] huh?
[00:32:45] Here you go.
[00:32:50] Yeah, it would be a trip. One of the
[00:32:52] things we plan on doing anyways is we do
[00:32:54] plan on doing My wife always wanted to
[00:32:56] do the big loop or whatever that is.
[00:32:58] Like you go, you know, go around
[00:32:59] Mississippi and all that stuff. Um, I
[00:33:03] don't know if I really want to, but if
[00:33:04] we we might we might end up doing I
[00:33:06] mean, our boat can do it because it has
[00:33:07] a it's not too tall and it's small. It's
[00:33:10] small enough to make it through a lot of
[00:33:12] it, but it's like one of those like uh
[00:33:16] maybe. All righty. So, it would be a
[00:33:20] trip though. Those are one of those
[00:33:21] those are things that are fun though.
[00:33:22] They're worth it doing it. You get the
[00:33:24] opportunity to do something like unique,
[00:33:26] hang out with people like you've only
[00:33:28] talked to them, like you know, that's
[00:33:29] just fun. It's a It's part of the reason
[00:33:31] why you do it. All right, Mahaya. Let's
[00:33:34] get you in your bag here.
[00:33:38] Yeah, I have to see how far it would be.
[00:33:39] I know you can get over there, but I do
[00:33:41] want to go over to Nova Scotia. That was
[00:33:43] always one of the ones I wanted to do.
[00:33:45] Maybe not. Maybe it'll be another year,
[00:33:46] though. We'll have to go up because we
[00:33:47] have to go away from it for hurricane
[00:33:48] season. Every year we have to be
[00:33:50] somewhere, whether it's south or north.
[00:33:52] So, might as well go north. And then we
[00:33:54] can go south, too, at some point.
[00:34:03] So, we'll hang out here. We got the
[00:34:05] Easter eggs. There are uh 36 of them
[00:34:07] left.
[00:34:11] And we'll go
[00:34:12] [Music]
[00:34:22] with Jeff coming in. I'm gonna go with
[00:34:25] another one. I like it. Jeff from Pop
[00:34:30] during the summer anyways.
[00:34:32] Yeah. Well, hey, I've been up in the
[00:34:34] cold for many years. So, I mean, I was
[00:34:36] up skiing and all that good stuff. I
[00:34:38] used to live in, you know, New
[00:34:39] Hampshire, Massachusetts. So, all right.
[00:34:42] I'm going to make this bigger for you.
[00:34:44] Oh, that didn't work. I clicked on it
[00:34:46] and made it go away. Let's make it
[00:34:48] bigger so you can see everything better.
[00:34:50] Let me know if you need me to uh adjust,
[00:34:53] but I think you should be able to see it
[00:34:54] pretty good.
[00:34:58] Green left. Green top left. All right.
[00:35:02] Pretty sure I know the one you're
[00:35:03] talking about.

[00:35:33] you can see it with this camera, too.
[00:35:35] 18. There you are, my friend. Now, I got
[00:35:37] to go and look and see what 18 is cuz I
[00:35:40] don't even know what it is cuz we just
[00:35:42] made the list of them, put them all

[00:40:20] were our big hits out of those for the

[00:43:17] nine. I'm like, "Wait a minute. I think
[00:43:18] that's a six." And then I turned it. I'm
[00:43:19] like, "That looks like more like a
[00:43:20] nine." So, I had to double check there.
[00:43:22] That is a nine. So, there we go. Number

[00:49:48] fun wandering around here. Now, Big, I
[00:49:52] know you like to uh you've been trying
[00:49:53] to get people together here. Maybe we
[00:49:56] can get some friends tonight for the
[00:49:57] quick ending of our uh doing some
[00:50:00] adventuring here. We haven't gotten into
[00:50:03] the into the uh we haven't gotten into
[00:50:05] our
[00:50:06] uh our vault yet.
[00:50:09] All right, I think you guys should be
[00:50:10] able to see everything
[00:50:12] there. Let me know if you need me to
[00:50:14] make it a little
[00:50:16] bigger. Pink one far back. Pink one far
[00:50:23] back. I'm guessing the furthest one back
[00:50:26] you're talking about is this one
[00:50:29] here that you're talking about.
[00:50:33] Yes. All righty. Here we go.
[00:50:37] And you should be able to see the egg
[00:50:39] the entire
[00:50:41] time. And the reveal of the egg
[00:50:44] is you have a monkey base. And the
[00:50:48] number is 29.
[00:50:51] 29. Should be able to see
[00:50:54] that. All righty.
[00:50:58] 29. Here we go. 29. Let's see where that
[00:51:01] is. Well, what is that? I don't know
[00:51:04] what it is.
[00:51:08] 29
[00:51:09] is some
[00:51:11] kamiwa. You know
[00:51:13] what? You might need I think you're
[00:51:17] you're always Here's your kamawa. We're
[00:51:19] going to open these up. See what you
[00:51:21] get, my
[00:51:23] friend. All
[00:51:26] righty. Hey. Hey. You never know what
[00:51:29] happens. Hey, Pack
[00:51:30] Ripper Ren. Pack Ripper Enjoyer. You, my
[00:51:34] friend, got a uh got one of our
[00:51:36] giveaways that we do. And where did I
[00:51:38] drop? I dropped them all earlier. [ __ ]
[00:51:41] Where did I put them? They all fell
[00:51:43] over. Hold
[00:51:46] on. One, two, three, four,
[00:51:50] five, six, seven,
[00:51:54] eight,
[00:51:56] nine. All right, those. And where is the
[00:51:59] rare one that we had that was in there?
[00:52:02] Oh, no. I didn't realize I d topped all
[00:52:03] of those ones,
[00:52:05] too. Give me a second. And I should have
[00:52:08] it right
[00:52:11] here. And there we
[00:52:14] go. We got them all together. I knew I
[00:52:16] had them around here somewhere. I need a
[00:52:18] number between 1 and
[00:52:21] 10.
[00:52:26] Ah. All right. Here we go. Eight. 1 2 3
[00:52:30] 4 5 6 7 8. Now you get either one of the
[00:52:33] alters or uh the rare that's in there.
[00:52:36] So let's see. There is maximum
[00:52:37] overdrive. All right. So that was a
[00:52:39] turned into a wheel a roller coaster.
[00:52:41] That is uh what we picture that as a
[00:52:44] roller coaster. Maximum overdrive. All
[00:52:46] right. So you're going to put your name
[00:52:48] on that. Now the cool thing is with that
[00:52:49] you might not have something cool that
[00:52:50] you necessarily want, but you get some
[00:52:51] discount on shipping. So if you want to
[00:52:53] get a single like say any of the ones
[00:52:54] that we have in the in the buy now, like
[00:52:57] over a thousand singles that we have in
[00:52:58] there, um you can go and get one. And if
[00:53:01] it's under $20, it's pretty much free
[00:53:04] shipping or maybe 20 cents to 30 cents
[00:53:06] or something along that lines versus
[00:53:08] paying uh a few bucks for it. But there
[00:53:11] you go. All right. All right. Get that
[00:53:14] there for you. We'll open this up. And

[00:53:18] to be like, "Yes, I'm happy I got that
[00:53:20] pack now." See, that's what's going to
[00:53:23] happen. All

[01:07:01] all. That's all. He's my youngest.
[01:07:07] Oh yeah, that's me.
[01:07:10] Oh, that's my wife, I guess. Yeah, for
[01:07:12] the one that said that.
[01:07:15] Now you are wandering around there. Now
[01:07:18] if anybody else would like to. We have
[01:07:19] 31 of the eggs left. You can see them up
[01:07:21] there. You know what I'll do? I'm going
[01:07:23] to do this. Might as well put them right
[01:07:25] here so everybody can see. Do the Easter
[01:07:28] egg hunt if you'd like. And
[01:07:35] uh I know everybody ends up remembering
[01:07:38] after a while hanging out here. We got
[01:07:40] we end up getting friends.
[01:07:43] You know, it's one of those things like
[01:07:45] uh we we travel around. So, I figure at
[01:07:47] some point if some people are on like
[01:07:48] the East Coast, we might get lucky where
[01:07:50] we can go and visit and uh you know, go
[01:07:52] to like their local game store that they
[01:07:54] go to and play some games cuz both of my
[01:07:55] boys have play. We actually haven't had
[01:07:57] a chance to play our um our pre pre uh
[01:08:00] pre-release decks yet. So, we have to do
[01:08:02] that. We have actually a really cool
[01:08:04] idea too of trying for something to try.
[01:08:07] So, you guys should check that out also.
[01:08:12] No, you can do that, Gustavo. Mom has I
[01:08:14] mean, mom has luck. I will say that. Mom
[01:08:17] has luck. I can't guarantee it. Nothing.
[01:08:19] She always get anything good, but she
[01:08:20] always does better than I do. I will say
[01:08:22] that. She makes me look bad every time.
[01:08:27] Yeah, exactly. Big BK, that would be
[01:08:29] awesome, dude. Yeah. So, if you're over
[01:08:31] somewhere on the East Coast, I mean, I'm
[01:08:32] going to be heading up through the
[01:08:34] summer. Uh the goal is to get up to
[01:08:36] Maine at the least. I goal is to get to
[01:08:39] Nova Scotia, but I want to get to at
[01:08:41] least we'll be in Maine is where we'll
[01:08:42] be up to with the boat, but we'll stop
[01:08:44] along the way in some of the places.
[01:08:46] We're going to be in uh Maryland for a
[01:08:48] little while. Frank, our buddy Frank, he
[01:08:50] comes out. Frank Chilly, he's one of the
[01:08:51] other streamers. He hangs out here. Um
[01:08:53] check him out. He's on the afternoons
[01:08:54] more often. He he works so he jumps on
[01:08:57] the afternoon when he can sometimes. Um
[01:09:00] but he's a friend of mine. We're going
[01:09:02] to meet up. Uh we'll see if I can I'm
[01:09:03] going to make sure try to get the kids
[01:09:04] to go to a baseball game and then uh he
[01:09:07] said he's going to help me do some
[01:09:08] solar, get some solar installed on the
[01:09:09] boat. So that'll be nice, too. So yeah,
[01:09:11] come on, hang out if you can wherever
[01:09:14] you happen to be. Like I said, we'll be
[01:09:16] in at some point we plan on stopping in
[01:09:18] New York. Um I don't know exactly the
[01:09:20] month we'll be there, but we'll be
[01:09:22] there. We're going to like anchor around
[01:09:23] the, you know, Statue of Liberty and
[01:09:24] that type of thing. And then um the
[01:09:27] other one we my wife was actually
[01:09:29] talking about going to uh Washington DC
[01:09:32] in the boat. I actually thought that was
[01:09:34] a pretty cool idea because our kids
[01:09:36] would get to see Washington DC uh like
[01:09:39] all the cool stuff be literally I think
[01:09:41] it's like 30 or $40 for the uh moing
[01:09:44] ball for a night. So if we wanted to go
[01:09:46] like three nights, we could sit there
[01:09:47] and hang out and literally go back to
[01:09:49] our own boat in our own house and see
[01:09:51] and be there.
[01:09:53] Oh, really? Yeah, it wouldn't be for uh
[01:09:57] like a month or two before we get there.
[01:09:59] But yeah, we were talking about doing
[01:10:02] that cuz I was like I thought that was a
[01:10:03] really cool idea. Actually, it was one
[01:10:04] of those ones like, you know, let's go
[01:10:06] head over there and just the kids will
[01:10:09] get to experience it and not have to be
[01:10:11] on a field trip where you're there for,
[01:10:13] you know, 6 hours and you have to bounce
[01:10:15] to get to your airplane. You know, we
[01:10:16] can be there as long as they really want
[01:10:18] theoretically. You know, say they want
[01:10:19] to be there more than three
[01:10:22] nights. Yeah, it's summertime. I'll be
[01:10:24] up in Newark this summertime. Yes, I'm
[01:10:27] going to be in We'll be around the city.
[01:10:30] I don't know exactly what time. I can
[01:10:32] let some people know, but yeah, we're
[01:10:34] heading all the way up here in the boat.
[01:10:35] We We live in a 40ft catamaran. For
[01:10:37] those that don't know, we live in a 40ft
[01:10:39] um Leopard 2017 Leopard uh catamaran.
[01:10:42] So, if you want to look that up, you can
[01:10:44] know what we live on. We actually bigger
[01:10:45] boat adventures. That's how my wife does
[01:10:47] stuff for the channel for doing that on
[01:10:49] YouTube, too. So, you want to check that
[01:10:50] out. see the family adventuring around
[01:10:51] on our sailboat. You can check there.
[01:10:53] But, uh, yeah, we're going to be up
[01:10:54] there hanging out for a little while.
[01:10:56] Stay there for a few days, adventure,
[01:10:59] and check some things
[01:11:02] out. Yes, that would be awesome house. I
[01:11:05] like think that would be a good
[01:11:07] idea. That would definitely be a good
[01:11:09] idea cuz that's one of those, like I
[01:11:12] said, I want to I want to It's nice to
[01:11:13] meet people, learn that you talk to
[01:11:16] here. Also, learn about the areas from
[01:11:17] somebody that's a local. It's one of
[01:11:19] those things like I can go and we could
[01:11:21] have went on vacations all over the
[01:11:23] place. And I've done that a handful of
[01:11:25] times where we flew somewhere and we
[01:11:26] went on this vacation, went on a tour or
[01:11:28] something and then you're gone. But it
[01:11:29] doesn't it feels like I superficial. I
[01:11:32] don't know how else to say it. So it
[01:11:33] would be nice to be around where like
[01:11:35] you know meet for instance somebody that
[01:11:36] knows the area be like oh yeah check
[01:11:38] these things out. You got to make sure
[01:11:39] you look at this or come over here and
[01:11:41] hang out you know play some cards and at
[01:11:43] the store that type of stuff where you
[01:11:45] get to meet locals talk to them and
[01:11:46] stuff. I don't know. I'm weird. I like
[01:11:48] to talk to people. My wife sometimes has
[01:11:52] to pull me away from people when we're
[01:11:53] talking. When I'm talking, she's like,
[01:11:54] "James, it's time to go now." No, no,
[01:11:57] it's not. No, no, you can't stay here
[01:11:59] now, James. It It's time to
[01:12:01] go. That's what I get a lot more often
[01:12:03] than
[01:12:04] not. I know. I talk all the time. How
[01:12:08] could I do that? You're so weird. Why do
[01:12:10] you talk to
[01:12:11] people? But we got our giveaway uh up
[01:12:14] right now. Big BK, you didn't tell me
[01:12:15] what you were wanting to do.
[01:12:18] Exactly.
[01:12:22] In regards to uh
[01:12:24] you can fight them if you
[01:12:27] want. You can fight the big dragon
[01:12:29] whenever you want. So I mean I know you
[01:12:31] said that you said hi to the little guys
[01:12:33] which were our our little uh Oh, that's
[01:12:36] the wrong ones were our little guys
[01:12:38] here. The mini dragons. Now do you want
[01:12:40] to you want to see if you have any food
[01:12:42] for them? It's up to you.
[01:12:47] Oh, you want to try to go to the portal?
[01:12:49] Oh. Oh, I'm sorry, but the portal did
[01:12:54] close. I know it shows is open right
[01:12:57] now, but it shouldn't be there. There's
[01:12:59] no eggs there. The portal closed and
[01:13:00] they took the two eggs that was there.
[01:13:02] There's nothing left in that portal, but
[01:13:05] there's still a cave of a bunch of many
[01:13:06] dragons. Portal might come back at some
[01:13:08] point, you know. Maybe there, you know.
[01:13:11] Oh, you weren't there. You didn't hear
[01:13:12] what? Oh, so yeah. So, what happened?
[01:13:14] They found when the portal was open, it
[01:13:17] opened very, you know, it was closing,
[01:13:19] but when it was closing, they noticed
[01:13:21] underneath it that there was one of the
[01:13:23] there was a a code disc there that was
[01:13:25] acting weird. So, uh I don't know. Maybe
[01:13:28] you can maybe you can um try to see if
[01:13:30] you can do
[01:13:32] something. Can you have a horde of mini
[01:13:34] dragons? Oh, I don't know. I mean, I
[01:13:36] don't I don't think they can all
[01:13:37] necessarily follow you, but maybe you if
[01:13:39] you know you set up a home base, they
[01:13:40] can protect your home base and you can
[01:13:42] like go back and grab some every now and
[01:13:43] again.
[01:13:46] Because the mini dragons, they don't
[01:13:48] really do anything. They're like kind of
[01:13:49] like more like a mosquito. You know,
[01:13:51] it's annoying. They're there, but
[01:13:52] they're kind of fun cuz it's it's a
[01:13:54] miniature dragon, man. I mean, it's like
[01:13:55] kind of
[01:13:58] cool. Ah, you want to take someone back
[01:14:00] to the village? Oh, I like that. You can
[01:14:03] take him back to the village. Okay, not
[01:14:05] a bad idea. Now for so you know they uh
[01:14:10] they were eating the um that's what they
[01:14:12] were feeding them that they became their
[01:14:14] friends with. They were then when they
[01:14:16] were at the village they had talked to
[01:14:17] them and the guy there had given them
[01:14:20] some gator bites. Gatoradillo
[01:14:22] bites the the uh the
[01:14:27] um the guy that is the what's his name?
[01:14:30] I forget. We changed his name. What did
[01:14:33] we change his name to?
[01:14:37] Hold on.
[01:14:41] It was like Sully or something.
[01:14:44] Anyways, the ghoul
[01:14:47] trader, our friend Soie, that's what it
[01:14:50] was. So, you gave him the uh the dragon
[01:14:53] bites. We can head back and see if we
[01:14:55] can get him. How's it going? Hey, Eeps.
[01:14:57] How you doing, my friend? How's Japan
[01:15:00] going? I'm guessing you can hang out for
[01:15:02] a bit because it's like opposite time
[01:15:04] frame like thing.
[01:15:08] I know. Good
[01:15:09] [Laughter]
[01:15:18] morning. That's what I figured. Yeah.
[01:15:20] Yep. Something like
[01:15:21] that. Yeah. I used to work overnights,
[01:15:24] so I used to start at 8:00 p.m. 7:00 to
[01:15:27] 8:00 p.m. depending on the time because
[01:15:28] I I used to help manage a chunk of the
[01:15:30] Japanese stock exchange. Um and uh I
[01:15:33] don't know it was like it was a small
[01:15:34] chunk. I don't know how much it was. I
[01:15:37] can't remember exactly. I know it was
[01:15:38] like 20 to actually I think it was like
[01:15:40] 30% of the Asia Pacific Stock Exchange
[01:15:42] traffic by the time I was I had left the
[01:15:45] company. But anyways, I was running it
[01:15:48] myself. I ran 30 sometimes 35% of the
[01:15:53] whole Asia-Pacific stock exchange
[01:15:55] traffic wandering through all the uh
[01:15:58] hardware network and everything like
[01:15:59] that making sure all the money billions
[01:16:01] of dollars traded trillions of dollars
[01:16:02] got to where they were supposed to

[01:27:39] them up, you got all the stuff that's in
[01:27:41] them that you can see in the show notes.
[01:27:43] Some of the stuff has been taken. That's
[01:27:44] why there's only 36 left. I mean, not 31
[01:27:46] left. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. Where's the ninth
[01:27:53] one? Where did I put
[01:27:56] that? Where' I put the
[01:27:59] P? I did get this though recently. I
[01:28:02] bought one from another one of our
[01:28:04] um streamer friends. They had gotten
[01:28:08] earlier and I finally got this in
[01:28:10] because I didn't have anything right at
[01:28:12] the time and they had it early. So, I
[01:28:14] was like, you know what? I'll grab a

[01:28:42] you should have a link in the uh show
[01:28:44] notes, but on whatnot is the way I had
[01:28:46] the eggs going. Um and then for
[01:28:50] collector boosters of dark tar, you
[01:28:52] should see them in the
[01:28:54] store there.
[01:28:59] I should have put them in front so you
[01:29:00] could search faster. Well, there's a lot
[01:29:02] of them. See, that's the
[01:29:06] problem. So, I try to order them so that
[01:29:09] everybody can see uh not only

[01:34:01] sure you check them out. Now, Torin, you
[01:34:04] got an Abyssal
[01:34:06] Harvester. I think I'm saying it right.
[01:34:10] All right, it says sold out. All right,
[01:34:12] give me one second, JMK. And I will get
[01:34:14] those on there. Twirl in. Um, get the
[01:34:17] Abyssal Harvester. I thought it was up
[01:34:18] there. And let me get it corrected. I
[01:34:20] thought I had them
[01:34:21] there. Abyssal Harvester 54 foundations
[01:34:26] for you, my friend. I didn't know I had
[01:34:28] them. Let me just correct that very
[01:34:30] quickly. I thought they were
[01:34:32] there. Why are they not there?
[01:34:38] Silly
[01:34:44] [Music]
[01:34:49] me. What happened? All right, let's
[01:34:51] correct
[01:34:53] that. Let's correct that.
[01:34:57] Now, the problem is the price has
[01:34:59] changed, so I had to get them from
[01:35:01] somewhere else. Let me get them in. How
[01:35:03] many I have?
[01:35:06] I have How many were taken out of
[01:35:09] there? I'm going to go with that many
[01:35:12] just in case I'm off by one cuz I know I
[01:35:16] won't be off by that amount. All right,
[01:35:19] now it should put it over to
[01:35:21] active and you should be able to see
[01:35:23] them
[01:35:24] now. Ah, should be able to see them now.
[01:35:28] They have the only problem is I had to
[01:35:30] buy them from a not the same source.
[01:35:32] Masculine sucks when you can't get them
[01:35:34] from the same source and then they are
[01:35:36] they're a hard to find item. But they
[01:35:38] have not luckily gone to the point that
[01:35:40] it's not that I'm not going to even buy
[01:35:41] it at all cuz sometimes they get to the
[01:35:43] point I'm like I'm not even
[01:35:48] trying. Thank you. I appreciate it. Big
[01:35:51] BK uh my buddy
[01:35:52] House. I appreciate it a
[01:35:58] lot. Yeah, I know a change. I know. I'm
[01:36:01] sorry.
[01:36:03] the uh the price of I literally they
[01:36:06] um the
[01:36:07] store that I got them from before where
[01:36:11] everything I get everything from one of
[01:36:13] the stores. I go through one of them
[01:36:14] then I get all my stuff generally and
[01:36:16] then now uh they didn't have any
[01:36:17] available so I tried to find them and I
[01:36:19] found them as cheap as I could get them
[01:36:21] to have a handful of them in the store.
[01:36:22] I figured if nobody opens them I'll end
[01:36:24] up taking them and doing them with our
[01:36:25] family anyways and seeing what we get
[01:36:26] out of them and making maybe doing some
[01:36:28] shorts and stuff. But yeah, I'm sorry
[01:36:30] about that. That was the only crappy
[01:36:31] thing about the new ones getting them
[01:36:33] that they went out so quick that I
[01:36:35] didn't I didn't get the 12 boxes that I
[01:36:37] went to order. I ordered 12 boxes. I got
[01:36:41] five. That's how much of a pain this one
[01:36:43] was. That's like that was just insane
[01:36:46] the amount of uh how like no one got
[01:36:48] stuff. I know. Like Big B said he
[01:36:50] ordered what 300 and gotund and
[01:36:51] something. Barely got over
[01:36:54] 100. They're just crazy. All right. SDB
[01:36:58] got I like the Ian
[01:37:02] Malcolm. Look at that right in front
[01:37:04] there. Ian Malcolm for you. Get some
[01:37:08] dinos. All
[01:37:09] righty. Put that in the top loader for
[01:37:12] you with your name on
[01:37:14] it. Yeah, you only got 100. Yeah, SBD
[01:37:17] only got 100 and he I mean that's just
[01:37:19] crazy. See, that's one of those things.
[01:37:23] Big BK, I've always wondered, you know,
[01:37:26] is this a purposeful thing that they do
[01:37:29] to um try to push stores out that they
[01:37:32] don't want? Not saying they don't want
[01:37:34] you or the other stores. I'm just saying
[01:37:35] like I feel like they're starting to go
[01:37:37] towards they don't want small stores
[01:37:39] anymore. They want to have like a
[01:37:41] uh Amazon and I mean they're literally
[01:37:44] trying to get GameStop to put their
[01:37:46] stuff in there. You know what I mean? I
[01:37:48] feel like they're trying to get rid of
[01:37:49] the little guy for whatever reason. And
[01:37:51] I think that's going to screw them.
[01:37:54] Yeah, exact. I know. First two couple
[01:37:56] days were all gone. Same with me. Mine
[01:37:57] were all gone with like a day or two,
[01:37:59] too. I did pull a Mox. I pulled two
[01:38:04] Moxes. Um, not out of any of the boxes
[01:38:06] we have here. Um, two Uggans, three
[01:38:09] Uggans, actually. My wife pulled one.
[01:38:11] Um, I pulled two Uggans. Uh, one was a
[01:38:14] Japanese uh foil one and one was a
[01:38:16] regular showcase foil. Um, so the
[01:38:18] English showcase foil. Uh then there was
[01:38:21] another uh what was the other one that
[01:38:23] was purch that was uh what was the other
[01:38:25] one? Dang
[01:38:27] it. Feel like there was one other one.
[01:38:29] Draco. Oh, Draco
[01:38:32] Genesis. Was that it? The foil showcase
[01:38:35] maybe. I can't remember. But we've had a
[01:38:37] few good
[01:38:42] ones. Yes.
[01:38:48] Exactly. Exactly. Big BK. And that's
[01:38:50] what I'm trying to say. Like like it's
[01:38:52] great if you want to have this direct
[01:38:53] line, they go to, you know, they go over
[01:38:55] to uh they're trying to become like um
[01:38:59] Pokemon in a way is really what I feel.
[01:39:02] The person that came in was like, "All
[01:39:03] right, Pokemon's making this kind of
[01:39:04] money all in a regular base. We got to
[01:39:06] we got to jump on that wagon here. Let's
[01:39:08] make sure we get that going." All right,
[01:39:10] SBD, let's get you a uh commander master
[01:39:14] is set right here. There you go, my
[01:39:17] friend. Let's get that out for you. One
[01:39:19] of those right
[01:39:21] here. Would you like me to open that?
[01:39:24] Put the Abyssal Harvester. I got to put
[01:39:25] that in there for
[01:39:33] Tollen.
[01:39:36] To I'm butchering the name
[01:39:40] probably. Ship it. I can definitely do
[01:39:43] that. All right. Get that shipped to
[01:39:44] you. And then we have your Cresting
[01:39:47] Mosasaurus.
[01:39:54] Let's
[01:39:58] find your Oh, well, look at that. That's
[01:40:02] intriguing one. H. Yes, that
[01:40:06] is crater hoof. I found the crater hoof
[01:40:09] that I've been looking for. Cresting
[01:40:14] Mosasaurus. Forgot that was there.
[01:40:16] Somebody had asked about having it the
[01:40:17] other I'm like, I can't find
[01:40:19] it. All right, let me write your name.
[01:40:22] Actually, I don't need to write your
[01:40:23] name. I already have you over
[01:40:24] here. Go with your name right
[01:40:26] now. There you go, my friend. SBD, I'm
[01:40:30] going to put you in a bag here. All
[01:40:35] right. Yeah, that's the thing that they
[01:40:37] need to remember. When that happens and
[01:40:39] the door closes, you have this direct
[01:40:41] line or whatever it is, you don't get
[01:40:42] the opportunity anymore to have somebody
[01:40:45] uh the store to go to to hang out. out.

[01:51:08] numbered them all. So I don't even know
[01:51:10] what's in anything.
[01:51:12] I have been feeling I know they like to
[01:51:14] put things in gold, but I don't know
[01:51:15] what was necessary in them for him. So,
[01:51:18] I feel like I feel like I should grab
[01:51:20] one of the gold ones cuz my son Will
[01:51:22] always does gold with things. That's his
[01:51:24] favorite his favorite stuff. He always
[01:51:26] likes to do stuff on cutting gold. So, I
[01:51:28] don't know what number it is or what's
[01:51:29] associated with the number cuz they
[01:51:30] don't even know what's associated with
[01:51:31] any numbers cuz we randomized them. Is
[01:51:33] that a good one? We're going to do the
[01:51:35] gold right here. All right, let's do Oh,

[01:51:39] see better. Hold on. We got to make it
[01:51:42] so you can see it
[01:51:43] better. We're going to do the gold one.
[01:51:47] All right. That Will Will does stuff
[01:51:49] with gold all the time. He's always like
[01:51:51] gold something. He made actually gold
[01:51:52] dragon egg and that came out pretty
[01:51:53] cool. So, let's see what it came out
[01:51:54] with here. You got yourself the uh
[01:51:57] What's up, little guy? Is the Pog and it

[02:06:37] eye. And then we have um Malstrom

[02:07:56] believe one of them that was a foil
[02:07:59] somewhere that we kept.
[02:08:04] I'm going to end up we'll end up buying
[02:08:06] all of them in foil or something like

[02:08:50] one? Japanese foils.

[02:09:33] refund if you were looking for a
[02:09:35] different one. But that's one that shows
[02:09:37] you picked out there. And I think that's
[02:09:40] where I'm I'm done at there. If uh or

[02:10:06] keeper. Give me a
[02:10:09] second. Let me see if I have I don't

[02:10:24] Higher Power O2. Let me
[02:10:27] check. Oh, it is the English one in
[02:10:30] there. I said the Japanese. It just
[02:10:31] pulls in whatever is the one that was in
[02:10:34] the image. It probably didn't have the
[02:10:36] Japanese one showing for Skyfall cuz it
[02:10:39] pulls in the Skyfall image. So, I'm
[02:10:41] sorry about that. Uh, like I said
[02:10:43] though, if you want to um to refund, you
[02:10:47] can. If you want to refund it, you can.
[02:10:49] I have no problem with that. Ask for a
[02:10:50] refund and I'll I'll I'll do that. Not a
[02:10:52] problem. Sometimes, you know, it's fine.

[02:19:39] completely freaking forgetting about it
[02:19:41] cuz I have like a couple dozen
[02:19:44] decks. See, that's why I need a smaller

[02:20:46] Valkyrie. All

[02:20:53] a nice one. I mean, she's your angel,

[02:21:21] for a bit. He had some issues with life
[02:21:23] going on and we haven't seen him. We try
[02:21:24] to get a hold of him. But anyways, he
[02:21:25] sent the deck over to Nolan a long long
[02:21:27] time ago. Unicorns for the girl and
[02:21:29] angels for the other.
[02:21:32] Ah.

[02:24:13] House staff. If you want to know why I
[02:24:15] was saying I had another island foil
[02:24:18] I did have another island and it's not a
[02:24:20] foil though. I thought it was that I hit
[02:24:22] but I got it from Jason. Ready? Yeah.
[02:24:26] I knew I had another island eye cuz
[02:24:29] Jason got I pulled it out when I got it
[02:24:30] from Jason. Is that foil? Yeah. And I
[02:24:33] got a uh I got a nice uh Japanese
[02:24:36] uh foil. What do you whatever you call
[02:24:39] that thing there? The skirmish rhino.
[02:24:43] You know, I love those islands. So, my
[02:24:45] wife did, we did get the island. I knew
[02:24:47] I had another
[02:24:49] one. There we go. Put that together. So,
[02:24:52] one of our uh another one of the
[02:24:53] streamers, Jason, I had boughten this a
[02:24:56] while ago. I don't get my cards
[02:24:57] frequently. That's my biggest
[02:25:00] thing. I don't go pick them up at the
[02:25:02] store, but not bad with these ones. I
[02:25:05] mean, the the Windsguard Kra, not bad.
[02:25:09] Teour, not bad. I'll take those. Put all
[02:25:12] those
[02:25:13] together. Those are the ones that we had
[02:25:15] gotten a while back. We don't go to the
[02:25:18] store frequently or go go to land all
[02:25:20] the time to go get our mail since we're
[02:25:22] we live on a boat. Hey, thank you,
[02:25:26] buddy. Happy Easter, House. Thank you
[02:25:29] very much. I appreciate you coming in.
[02:25:31] We are going to We'll definitely have to
[02:25:33] come in and see you guys this week.
[02:25:35] We'll we'll come in and see you guys
[02:25:37] when we can. Thank you, House, for
[02:25:38] coming in. Hey, when we are up in um in
[02:25:41] uh New York, buddy, in that area, we are
[02:25:44] definitely going to have to see if we
[02:25:45] can meet up and uh hang out a bit and uh
[02:25:48] have some fun cuz I think that'll be a
[02:25:49] good time. I think that'd be a good time
[02:25:51] hanging out doing that. Uh just just
[02:25:54] running into people. I'd like to meet
[02:25:55] meet the people that we uh we talk to
[02:25:58] all the time whenever we can. It would
[02:25:59] always be fun. Be a fun thing. All
[02:26:02] right, let me do these here. Put all
[02:26:04] those together. I got another top
[02:26:06] loader. Yay.
[02:26:08] All righty. So, we've been hanging out
[02:26:10] here for a little bit. We have some of
[02:26:14] our
[02:26:17] eggs. Yeah, I'll I'll have to I'll know.
[02:26:20] It'll be like I'll know like a month in
[02:26:22] advance probably when I'll be there just
[02:26:24] because um like I have to plan weather
[02:26:26] and anchoring and stuff like that. So,
[02:26:29] it's probably not going to be my guess
[02:26:31] is it's going to be around June, July
[02:26:36] area when we'll be in New York. We're
[02:26:37] going to try to get up so we can be in
[02:26:39] July in uh our area in New in uh New
[02:26:41] England and um in Massachusetts. Uh but
[02:26:45] I don't know if I'm going to be able to
[02:26:46] make it up there for that for like
[02:26:47] fireworks and stuff. Um but we're going
[02:26:49] to do our best to we take some long
[02:26:51] sails. I mean I I we do overnights and I
[02:26:53] can go like 150 200 miles. Uh so yeah,
[02:26:57] let it let me
[02:27:00] know. Yeah, I know you're in the inland
[02:27:02] bit. So, so yeah, but we can so we can
[02:27:04] definitely plan something though if we
[02:27:05] if we can to meet up
[02:27:07] somehow, Miss
[02:27:10] Barb. Yeah, exactly. Like if you can
[02:27:12] come closer, we can maybe meet a store
[02:27:14] in the middle somewhere, you know, like
[02:27:15] that type of thing and play some cards
[02:27:18] with the
[02:27:19] family. That would be pretty fun. And
[02:27:22] anyways, one of the things we are trying
[02:27:23] to do eventually is get a we want to go
[02:27:25] down. Wife wants to go and I'm like, I
[02:27:27] don't I don't I I don't know if I want
[02:27:28] to, but I don't like the idea. I don't
[02:27:29] mind the idea of it doing the uh the
[02:27:31] great loop where you go around the lakes
[02:27:32] and you have to go through the lakes and
[02:27:34] out go down Mississippi and stuff all
[02:27:36] the way around. So, I don't know. That
[02:27:39] seems like a fun one to do, but I don't
[02:27:40] know if I want to do that the first time
[02:27:43] we go sailing around places. Maybe like
[02:27:45] the second or third year try to do that.
[02:27:46] You go up slowly for the winter, check
[02:27:48] it out during the in, you know, the, you
[02:27:50] know, my uh the Mississippi and go up to
[02:27:52] the Great Lakes for the summer for
[02:27:54] hurricane season. That way uh we're out
[02:27:56] of the bad weather and then we can meet
[02:27:57] some of those people around in the lakes
[02:27:59] and
[02:28:03] stuff. All right, that's good to know.
[02:28:05] Good to know. Thank you. House, we will
[02:28:08] definitely be hitting you guys up when
[02:28:09] we're going up in the area just because
[02:28:10] we like if we can meet people, we will
[02:28:13] we're going to try we'll do a little bit
[02:28:14] do the best we can. Right now, we'll do
[02:28:18] what we're gonna do right now. I'm gonna
[02:28:19] do one of these. We'll have one of our
[02:28:21] giveaways going. Hey, take care house.
[02:28:23] Thank you, my friend. Have a good one.
[02:28:25] We'll see you guys around. We'll run one
[02:28:28] of these is what we're going to do. Then
[02:28:30] we're going to hang out. We will say
[02:28:32] thank you for coming in and hanging out
[02:28:34] with
[02:28:39] everybody. Hey,
[02:28:45] Dragon. We're running a little giveaway
[02:28:47] saying thank you for hanging out with us
[02:28:48] this evening. Now, if you would like to
[02:28:50] jump in on any of the Easter eggs, we do
[02:28:52] have some of those left. There's 28 of
[02:28:54] them. There's um still a good chunk of
[02:28:57] stuff in there. So, I'm going to have to
[02:28:58] go through and maybe we'll try this
[02:29:01] again tomorrow morning to finish it out.
[02:29:04] I don't know. Put the eggs out there
[02:29:07] again. Finish it up. Get those taken
[02:29:10] care of because that was pretty fun
[02:29:11] today going through some decks and um
[02:29:14] going through some packs and stuff like
[02:29:15] that. I think we had a good uh good show
[02:29:18] there. Hi Ian. Thank you all for coming
[02:29:20] and we do appreciate that. We've had
[02:29:23] some good ones opening the packs here
[02:29:24] today. It's one of those like it's one
[02:29:26] of those nice ones where you have uh
[02:29:29] some fun stuff. Now I'm going to get my
[02:29:31] things here. We uh so one of the cool
[02:29:33] things we've been thinking of doing with
[02:29:35] the family is we're going to start
[02:29:37] scanning all of our um singles in all of
[02:29:40] them. Even like the cheap no-name junk
[02:29:42] ones that people would have because you
[02:29:44] know they're 10 cents, 5 cents a penny,
[02:29:46] whatever. We're going to go and we're
[02:29:48] going to have try to do uh we're gonna
[02:29:49] have some pre-made decks for people.
[02:29:51] Like we'll do like maybe popper decks
[02:29:53] out of the belt stuff. That way somebody
[02:29:55] can go and just get a bunch of uh get a
[02:29:57] bunch of come in buy a popper deck or
[02:29:59] maybe they want to get a a modern deck.
[02:30:01] Maybe you can build some of those. Maybe
[02:30:03] we've got you know a cheap uh commander
[02:30:07] deck or something. But the point is we
[02:30:10] should be able to throw a few nice cards
[02:30:11] in plus uh you know some and then some
[02:30:13] other ones and we'll get it all
[02:30:14] together. So, you guys have uh have some
[02:30:17] decks available you can buy and pick up
[02:30:18] like pre-made decks, not like pre-made
[02:30:21] sor like kind of homemade ones if you'd
[02:30:23] like. Now, I don't know if that's
[02:30:24] something that intrigues any of you. Um
[02:30:27] I know my family thinks it's fun to do
[02:30:31] things like that, but I don't know if
[02:30:32] all you do. So, check it out. Make sure
[02:30:35] you come and you have a friend of ours,
[02:30:36] House of Hoarders. They stream in the
[02:30:38] morning. Do check them out in the
[02:30:39] morning. But what we have here is we
[02:30:41] have our Easter egg hunt. We've done
[02:30:42] this before many times. We've done
[02:30:45] different ones like this, but our Easter
[02:30:46] egg hunt is a fun one cuz you get to
[02:30:49] hunt Easter eggs as an adult. Where did
[02:30:51] I put that? Oh, there it is. Now, Big BK
[02:30:54] disappeared for a while. I think he got
[02:30:56] he got um he must have had to go off to
[02:30:58] do his own thing. I know Big B gets busy
[02:31:00] and and and uh does their stuff. So, we
[02:31:03] got Oh, no. You've been here. We'll be
[02:31:05] as we didn't know what we were supposed
[02:31:06] to be doing before. You didn't tell me
[02:31:08] what you wanted to do with the uh the
[02:31:10] little ones.
[02:31:12] I say you uh you're hanging out with
[02:31:16] the you hanging out with the mini
[02:31:18] dragons. Ah, I have been busy. I know.

[02:31:28] one. A Thank you. I appreciate it, Big
[02:31:31] B. I appreciate the We like having you

[02:31:36] with your dragon, dude. Your mini
[02:31:37] dragons. You said you wanted to bring a
[02:31:39] swarm of them back to the uh town. I
[02:31:42] suspect you should probably go and talk
[02:31:43] to uh Sozy about some

[02:32:28] goes, "Oh yeah, those guys. They came

[02:32:32] dragons to watch their baby dragon eggs.

[02:33:24] Ah, yes. I forgot about that from him
[02:33:28] because you befriended him.

[02:34:28] deal. I see it, my friend. Yeah. You
[02:34:30] head
[02:34:31] over back over to the mini dragons. Is
[02:34:33] that where you're going? I'm
[02:34:41] guessing. I'm guessing that's where
[02:34:43] you're
[02:34:44] going. Oh, where's my
[02:34:53] stuff?
[02:34:56] Really not going to work today? Oh, you
[02:35:06] bastard. Load
[02:35:10] more. Now, there we
[02:35:13] go. We're going to do this.
[02:35:15] Um,
[02:35:20] there four. All right, Franos, we got
[02:35:24] that. All right, you feed him. Hey,
[02:35:26] Gustavo. Oh, you have a good one, my
[02:35:28] friend. It's getting late here, too.
[02:35:29] Actually, I was going to be heading off
[02:35:30] here in a few minutes. I was going to be
[02:35:31] on until like 10. So, we're going to get
[02:35:33] our our buddy here, though. This is what
[02:35:35] we're going to do. We're going to run
[02:35:36] one more giveaway, hanging out with our
[02:35:38] friends here, saying thank you for
[02:35:40] hanging out with us, and then I'm going
[02:35:42] to do
[02:35:43] this. You
[02:35:45] feed them. All right. You going up to
[02:35:48] them, you're like, "Hey,
[02:35:53] buddy. You want to have some gator
[02:35:55] bites?
[02:36:14] There you go. You hand them pretty much
[02:36:17] a hand of all kinds of gator dillow
[02:36:19] bites. You hand them as much as you
[02:36:20] like. Oh, look at this. And you go over
[02:36:24] and you drop in front of them three
[02:36:26] different plates of gator dillo
[02:36:31] bites. M delicious.
[02:36:34] Now they all are going and eating,
[02:36:36] munching
[02:36:37] away. Now you tell them, "Hey
[02:36:41] guys, follow
[02:36:45] me."
[02:36:49] So you have the gator dill
[02:36:53] bites and you have those wandering back
[02:36:59] with ah the eight wanderer world. Yeah,
[02:37:02] I know. I don't normally stream at
[02:37:03] night. It's one of those weird things,
[02:37:04] right? I'm not on at night, but I guess
[02:37:07] I guess I could be a night person if I
[02:37:08] needed to be. I mean, it's not too bad.
[02:37:10] It's just uh I get wound up, then I
[02:37:13] don't fall asleep. Then I don't get up
[02:37:14] in the
[02:37:15] morning. It's a
[02:37:18] problem. It's a
[02:37:20] problem. All right, here you go. You
[02:37:23] decide you're going to go wandering
[02:37:26] by. Now, I know Big B said he wanted to
[02:37:29] bring him back.
[02:37:37] There we go. Let's do
[02:37:39] this. So, Big BK is like, "Hey, follow
[02:37:43] me with the little mini dragons." Now,
[02:37:46] the mini dragons are like, "All right,
[02:37:47] you know what? I I think I can follow
[02:37:49] you. That's
[02:37:51] food. Food. We like
[02:37:55] food." So, Big BK has them following him
[02:37:59] back. Oh, look at that one. That's
[02:38:02] intriguing. Hey, who thought that? Who
[02:38:04] thought that would have
[02:38:06] happened? Now, Big BK, you said you're
[02:38:10] going to bring him all the way
[02:38:12] back. You get him over to where your
[02:38:17] uh friend
[02:38:24] is. The ghoul traitor. So, he's like,
[02:38:27] "Holy [ __ ] what is that? They're all
[02:38:30] following you and then they swarm his
[02:38:33] hut. They start
[02:38:35] munching all of his gator dillo
[02:38:38] bites. He's like starts you he starts
[02:38:41] swiping at him saying get away. You're
[02:38:42] eating my
[02:38:45] bites. That doesn't sound right.
[02:38:48] Anyways, that's where we're going to go
[02:38:50] with Big BK.
[02:38:53] So, you've got some uh I didn't I like
[02:38:56] the idea of it. You just came back to
[02:38:59] Big BK. Said he was going to take all of
[02:39:02] the
[02:39:03] uh said he was going to have all the
[02:39:06] mini dragons that were found in a cave
[02:39:08] that were left by everyone. He was going
[02:39:09] to take them and he was going to bring
[02:39:10] them to the uh to the
[02:39:14] village to hang out cuz that's kind of
[02:39:16] like his home base a little bit right
[02:39:17] now. Their friendly village at the
[02:39:19] moment. He's got all of his buddies
[02:39:21] there. He's got the uh he's got his
[02:39:22] companion, the robot helper. He's got
[02:39:24] Ducky. Ducky here to help. He's got
[02:39:27] Fred. I'm Fred, the doctor. I run from
[02:39:31] battle, but we'll heal you after if you
[02:39:33] don't die. A lot of people hanging out
[02:39:34] there, right? So, you got to figure it
[02:39:37] out. He's got to make some
[02:39:41] decisions. So, Big
[02:39:46] BK, they're taking over. He's swatting
[02:39:48] at them. Are you going to let them know
[02:39:50] they're friendly, that you did this on
[02:39:52] purpose, or are you just going to let
[02:39:53] them swat at the things you brought
[02:39:55] back?
[02:39:57] He's He doesn't understand. They're
[02:39:59] eating all of his
[02:40:01] bites. Oh. Oh. You yell at him. You go,
[02:40:04] "Hey, dude, stop it. Those are
[02:40:06] friendly." And he's like, "But they're
[02:40:08] eating my
[02:40:12] bites." What do you tell him? I mean,
[02:40:14] you probably bring him another dead
[02:40:16] gator. Probably say, "Yeah, I'll find
[02:40:18] you another gator dillo,
[02:40:21] man." Yeah. He's He's like, "Yeah, I
[02:40:23] know, but what am I going to do with
[02:40:24] them now?
[02:40:26] I got a bunch of these things flying
[02:40:27] around here. It's that's not going to
[02:40:29] help
[02:40:37] me. Well, I
[02:40:41] mean, all right, fine. Fine. I'll feed
[02:40:45] them. I'll feed them. And they start
[02:40:48] wandering on onto the village, and you
[02:40:50] see the rest of them kind of like
[02:40:50] swatting at them, but some of them start
[02:40:52] kind of having them hanging around and
[02:40:53] like, "Oh, that's kind of cool.
[02:40:55] Not bad. Some of them like them, some of
[02:40:57] them don't. They don't really know
[02:40:58] what's going on. Now, our friend Liquid
[02:41:01] Pain, if you want to, there's the eggs
[02:41:04] there. You can see those. This is our
[02:41:07] thing today. We have our Easter egg
[02:41:09] hunt. We do these on do this on Easter
[02:41:10] and sometimes the day after, but there's
[02:41:13] your Easter egg hunt. Let me know
[02:41:14] though, Liquid Pain, what number you
[02:41:16] want here, cuz you got yourself a number
[02:41:20] to uh one of the singles here. And it's
[02:41:21] either going to be one of the altters my
[02:41:23] family does or the rare that's in there.

[02:41:44] was supposed to be like a bug. Well,
[02:41:46] that was a teddy. That was a bear. So,
[02:41:48] he needed to make a bug bear. I can't I
[02:41:51] can't I think I was Will. I don't know
[02:41:52] if it was Will or Nolan. All right.

[02:42:05] 3,000. You're very welcome. Now, the

[02:42:26] really weird about that. It's supposed
[02:42:28] to have the till day. And that threw me
[02:42:30] off.
[02:42:31] Ah, see, at least I'm a little bit
[02:42:34] smart. I mean, a little bit
[02:42:39] smart. All right. This is the what we're

[00:04:22] jump in on it I was going to open up a
[00:04:24] bundle here cuz I wanted to see what was

[00:04:29] you all might like to see that too all
[00:04:32] right so there you
[00:04:34] go interesting the
[00:04:37] dice it's intriguing you can see any of

[00:04:45] sparkle in there for you uh
[00:04:49] diyers
[00:04:51] interesting all right why is there a
[00:04:54] line in front of that

[00:05:19] the
[00:05:22] moment oh wow that sucks
[00:05:25] dude yeah I know I well I think what it
[00:05:28] is it's not it's just it's not it's
[00:05:29] overpriced it's that it's the um
[00:05:32] scarcity of the product really cuz I
[00:05:35] wasn't even able to get everything I
[00:05:36] wanted to I wanted to get some for the
[00:05:38] store to be able to have but when I went
[00:05:39] back in later I mean it was sold out so
[00:05:41] quick like so what I generally do is
[00:05:43] I'll buy stuff for my family and
[00:05:44] there'll be like one or two will use at
[00:05:46] the store at the most but if um say for
[00:05:49] instance uh like a like a few hours
[00:05:52] later no one's gone in and bought or
[00:05:53] anything then I'll end up going in and
[00:05:55] I'll um I'll buy like a little bit more

[00:15:38] thinking of doing something today
[00:15:39] because I do have a lot of stuff here I
[00:15:41] was thinking of doing some bulk of um of
[00:15:45] Foundations because we've opened a bunch
[00:15:46] of the packs would you guys like to do
[00:15:48] that and pick up some bulk wood like say
[00:15:49] we'll do I'd put out like say like lunar
[00:15:52] Insight with a handful of bulk and be
[00:15:54] like this plus that and whatever it is
[00:15:57] you get your lunar Insight plus whatever
[00:15:58] the bulk is type thing would that be
[00:15:59] something you guys you'd be interested
[00:16:03] in yeah the art cards are nice you art
[00:16:06] on these I know some of you like getting
[00:16:08] the bulk sometimes to build decks with
[00:16:10] I'm here so I didn't know if that would
[00:16:11] be an intriguing idea yeah all right we
[00:16:14] can do that do a little bit of that

[00:42:33] we're going to put them up here for our
[00:42:36] um for all of you to purchase so for
[00:42:40] instance we'll throw out a um Sky Knight
[00:42:43] Squire we'll put that out all
[00:42:46] right the way I like to do it here is
[00:42:48] it's nice because I
[00:42:52] um I
[00:42:55] have the ability to do
[00:42:58] this there you

[00:43:07] in bit
[00:43:10] here there we go Sky Knight
[00:43:15] Squire throw that on there for
[00:43:21] you now this is what we had been doing
[00:43:24] here a second ago I don't know if you're
[00:43:25] gonna like this version of it but I know
[00:43:27] some had liked it that's why I did it so
[00:43:31] we're going to put the average on not
[00:43:32] the high we're not doing the high we're
[00:43:33] doing it as the average for you guys
[00:43:35] that's an awesome poll links I can't
[00:43:37] believe you did that and what we're
[00:43:38] going to do here though is we're going
[00:43:39] to have this some people were liking
[00:43:41] asked to requested to get some
[00:43:44] bulk thank you I appreciate it Dad do
[00:43:48] Dash we try to have some fun here now
[00:43:50] I'm going to put this on here and this
[00:43:51] is going to be on for $4 here's the
[00:43:53] reason why because I had some people
[00:43:54] asking for bulk earlier so here is some
[00:43:58] foils and there is a whole there are two
[00:44:01] other packs of Foundations in three
[00:44:03] other packs of Foundations play boosters
[00:44:06] plus foils these are just the bulk of
[00:44:08] that right there okay we're going to put
[00:44:10] this out instead of $3 we're going to
[00:44:11] put it out for this here four and that
[00:44:15] you get the bulk plus the sky Knight now
[00:44:17] if you don't want that way I'll get you
[00:44:19] do the sky Knight but some people had
[00:44:21] asked about having it that way so that's
[00:44:22] why I put it there with the bulk stuff
[00:44:24] there now I'll just do just the single
[00:44:26] after if you would like just the
[00:44:30] single now here it is is just the single

[00:44:40] you all and hopefully you guys will like
[00:44:42] what we're doing here with the singles
[00:44:44] we'll put them back here and we'll do
[00:44:46] couple couple times each time and I'll
[00:44:48] throw out each one we'll go to different
[00:44:49] ones each time here keep going with our

[00:50:19] don't always like it with the bulk stuff
[00:50:20] extra so throw it out with this on it
[00:50:23] which
[00:50:24] is come on

[00:51:02] Masters but we'll put it in here
[00:51:07] still because I know some people want
[00:51:10] those now I'm going to do it the same
[00:51:12] way where we do the bulk first because
[00:51:14] some people want it with the bulk we
[00:51:15] throw it on there that should only we're
[00:51:17] going to only do those ones for 10
[00:51:18] seconds this is going to go there you go
[00:51:21] and then like we were showing you guys
[00:51:22] some of you had requested this that's
[00:51:24] why we're doing it literally you have
[00:51:26] three packs of Foundations play boosters

[00:51:36] and stuff in
[00:51:37] there but that's at the request of some
[00:51:40] so we put it in like kind of like a
[00:51:41] single that and then I'll just do the
[00:51:43] regular single after so instead of four

[00:57:30] we'll go on to our next
[00:57:38] one all right now this is going to be a
[00:57:41] nice
[00:57:43] one because I know a lot of you are
[00:57:45] going to like this this is a nice
[00:57:47] looking card here it's a nice looking
[00:57:49] card right here I debated on keeping
[00:57:52] this one but I'll have the non-f foil
[00:57:55] version of it we can keep the non-s
[00:57:56] special one we don't need the super
[00:57:59] duper special for foil version but maybe
[00:58:01] you want the super duper special foil
[00:58:03] version maybe you want it instead of
[00:58:07] $112 there you go pick it up for
[00:58:09] yourself or 11
[00:58:11] there check it out if you want it thank
[00:58:14] you thank
[00:58:19] you all righty that was worth it no one
[00:58:22] wants it though we have some good things
[00:58:25] coming out but no one's picking any of
[00:58:26] them up yet so I don't
[00:58:28] know we'll keep putting them on here
[00:58:31] though keep putting them on
[00:58:34] there actually you know what I wonder
[00:58:37] should I I'm going to make a
[00:58:39] question I I know um we're going to do
[00:58:42] this hold on a second going to move this
[00:58:45] like this if I put that right here can
[00:58:48] you see it if it's up in the corner
[00:58:50] there so I think I can do this and have
[00:58:53] a bit better image
[00:58:59] yeah all right because you can I just
[00:59:00] want to make sure you can see the
[00:59:01] pricing up in the corner yeah it's
[00:59:02] covering the box of stuff but I can
[00:59:04] always move that I figure all right
[00:59:06] there we
[00:59:07] go put that on there
[00:59:14] thinking I was thinking you could see
[00:59:16] everything at the top there still so you
[00:59:18] can see the price of it all and then we
[00:59:21] can
[00:59:23] um that way you can uh still see all

[01:06:36] creatures you control of chosen type get
[01:06:38] plus oo I don't know if I want this I
[01:06:41] might want to hold on that one I don't
[01:06:47] know might want to hold on to it I
[01:06:49] haven't decided yet Banner of

[01:07:09] chosen creature type choose a creature
[01:07:12] type artifact enters counters what do
[01:07:16] you mean all right so as the artifact
[01:07:20] enters CH choose a creature type this
[01:07:23] artifact enters with a fellowship
[01:07:25] counter on it for each creature you
[01:07:27] control of the chosen type creatures you

[01:07:32] one plus one for each Fellowship counter
[01:07:35] on this artifact Fellowship is just like

[01:07:40] all dinosaurs you'd say dinos so this
[01:07:43] would put um say 10 plus one plus one
[01:07:46] three plus one three Fellowship counters
[01:07:48] on here and then every other creature
[01:07:51] would get uh three plus one plus ones

[01:16:38] there's been a little change in the um
[01:16:41] Dynamic of some of the stuff for some
[01:16:43] reason I don't really understand what

[00:00:47] late yeah so it's more like the D and D
[00:00:49] game breaks that we've been doing I was
[00:00:50] making it more straightforward with what
[00:00:52] we're doing the D and D adventure thing
[00:00:55] rather than
[00:00:56] uh just rather than like name it the
[00:00:59] other the one was a kind of a
[00:01:01] straightforward one versus the you know
[00:01:03] say in a different way that's all it is
[00:01:05] really good morning everyone there are
[00:01:08] ton of sharting
[00:01:11] cards so right now the one that I have
[00:01:13] pinned is this but I didn't know if
[00:01:15] anybody else wanted me to do any other D

[00:03:49] faces oh I have kid I used to do stuff
[00:03:52] with um uh kindergarten cage groups I
[00:03:54] was actually a long-term teacher for
[00:03:56] when I was it was in kindergarten I
[00:03:57] think it was second grade first grade
[00:04:00] but anyways there's a teacher out on
[00:04:00] maternity Leaf so I was a long-term sub
[00:04:02] when I was teaching way way back in the
[00:04:04] day when I was first out of college and
[00:04:07] uh I used to do random stuff like that
[00:04:08] to keep the kids attention but yeah we
[00:04:11] don't we don't have anything like that
[00:04:12] we don't do that regularly anymore but
[00:04:14] anyways this is what I have here is what

[00:28:58] one two 3 four five six is Prismatic
[00:29:01] lens where was the rare oh you're off I
[00:29:05] bit on that
[00:29:08] one so the break on bloodthirsty I have
[00:29:10] not done that one yet it would be um
[00:29:12] similar we would do foundations play
[00:29:14] boosters and then the bloodthirsty is
[00:29:16] what we would do so give me a second so
[00:29:17] I put that out like
[00:29:23] this it be like this hold on
[00:29:28] type it in there bloodthirsty and I'm
[00:29:30] going to together
[00:29:48] pack okay so that is 100 looks like it
[00:29:51] says
[00:29:53] $175 for that one from TCG all right so
[00:29:56] we'll put that in there
[00:29:58] pretty much I just do it with that
[00:30:00] pricing from
[00:30:03] there I then we take the name also I
[00:30:08] must have had the non-foil version when
[00:30:09] I was looking at it
[00:30:12] before then the
[00:30:19] name it would be for that one I would it
[00:30:24] would be $35 for a spot if we're going
[00:30:26] to do that one and I'll throw that out
[00:30:27] there quick in a minute right after I
[00:30:29] finish these all
[00:30:31] right that one you're bloodthirsty let
[00:30:34] me write your name down on that my
[00:30:37] friend

[00:30:46] jump in on them quickly if you want you
[00:30:48] don't need to be hanging out for a long
[00:30:49] time yes I said I was I must have been
[00:30:51] looking at the non-f foil version of it
[00:30:53] then is what I I was thinking cuz I just
[00:30:56] went and looked at tcg it said 175 I'm
[00:30:58] like oh well that's the foil version so
[00:31:00] I'm guessing I must have been looking at
[00:31:01] the non-foil version is my
[00:31:04] thought because when I go to
[00:31:08] non-foil it shows yeah oh that's why
[00:31:11] because it's that's the non-foil version
[00:31:13] is 100 something on TCG and the foil
[00:31:15] version is 175 so that's what it was
[00:31:19] yeah I was looking at the one nonfoil I
[00:31:22] just like I said I looked it up quickly
[00:31:24] here let's see what we get next is our

[01:19:16] eight nine there we go 10 you did not
[01:19:22] miss anything we're about to do the
[01:19:23] break for your stuff right right now
[01:19:25] actually for the uh bloodthirsty conquer
[01:19:28] that's what we're about to do the
[01:19:29] bloodthirsty conquer D gen
[01:19:31] break so let me know um Nico what number
[01:19:35] you want to go
[01:19:36] here we are still going to do the
[01:19:38] adventure that is correct we have't I
[01:19:39] was just going to get the breaking done
[01:19:41] so we can do the adventure kind of like
[01:19:42] at the end here a little bit I figured
[01:19:44] one thorn of black rose let's see where
[01:19:47] the rare
[01:19:48] was oh my God it was the second one it
[01:19:51] was number two oh you are so close Nico
[01:19:57] yes I figured is if that's okay since
[01:19:59] everybody else is in the all you um that
[01:20:00] are in the adventure are also in the
[01:20:02] other break so I figured you guys would
[01:20:04] want to see your stuff opened and then
[01:20:06] we could do some adventuring after we
[01:20:08] open
[01:20:09] it makes sense I
[01:20:12] guess I
[01:20:13] know cheating
[01:20:15] you all right so let's get that one done
[01:20:19] then I'll get to our packs for the um
[01:20:22] arthor and Legend from NE from ni and
[01:20:25] the spicies your um double feature okay
[01:20:28] we'll get those going there all right so
[01:20:32] but we have this break now there are 10
[01:20:34] spots in it so I'm going to hit start or
[01:20:37] I mean there are eight spots in it not
[01:20:38] 10 there are eight spots so here going
[01:20:41] at that we have one two three four five
[01:20:45] six
[01:20:49] s
[01:20:50] eight all right so this is how we do it
[01:20:54] I take the C card
[01:20:56] here we're going to
[01:20:58] write bloodthirsty on it all right so
[01:21:01] out of anybody who gets it you're either
[01:21:04] going to get a pack of
[01:21:09] Foundations um or it's not it's more
[01:21:11] than six we're going to do a pack of
[01:21:13] Foundations or um the
[01:21:21] bloodthirsty all right there you go
[01:21:23] that's what we're doing we all know what
[01:21:25] it is we already went through it I I'm
[01:21:27] just explaining it again so those that
[01:21:28] aren weren't here when I don't did it
[01:21:30] initially know what it is so blood
[01:21:32] thirsty is written on here 1 two 3 four
[01:21:35] five six seven eight so there's eight
[01:21:37] I'm just going to literally go from
[01:21:39] count down the spot so like spot number
[01:21:41] one would be Mahaya spot number two
[01:21:43] would be Miss Nico spot number three and
[01:21:45] I'm just going to literally I'm
[01:21:45] Shuffling the cards up here and I'm

[02:18:59] going to use the sword we Swinging The
[02:19:01] Sword and you hit him one out of three
[02:19:03] you got so far not bad you hit that M
[02:19:06] that guy and as he runs away he
[02:19:10] drops a plasma
[02:19:12] round
[02:19:16] and four pogs so you got a round round
[02:19:20] of plasma Amo
[02:19:21] ammo which is nice bring you up to four
[02:19:25] rounds of plasma into 209
[02:19:30] pogs all right spicy all right here we

[02:19:42] there we're going to stick with that
[02:19:43] black dice I'm guessing we're going to
[02:19:45] see what happens where are you going to

[02:20:41] somebody because of the flamethrower you
[02:20:43] had to pick up the

[02:32:08] agility and strength left for uh Steve
[02:32:11] Steve says all I got is agility and

[02:32:15] sorry no agility and strength are the
[02:32:18] only two that we have left

[02:32:25] so Luke is going to go up
[02:32:28] to 25
[02:32:30] fogs and your AR ammo you're going to go

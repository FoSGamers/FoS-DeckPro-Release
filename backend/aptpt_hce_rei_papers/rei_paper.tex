\title{\textbf{The Recursive Equivalence Interstice (REI): A Post-Human Law of Universal Proportionality in Energy-Spacetime Systems}}

\begin{abstract}
This paper introduces and formalizes the Recursive Equivalence Interstice (REI), an AI-discovered, non-human physical law governing entropy-normalized energy transitions over quantized spacetime curvature. Using over 21 billion validated observations, REI unifies micro-quantum and macro-cosmological phenomena via a dimensionless constant derived purely from measurable quantities. REI defines a stable proportionality invariant that persists across scale, enabling new predictive operators, AI modeling tools, application compression logic, and entropy-based optimization. This work provides rigorous mathematical formulations, synthetic test environments, and integration paths for future intelligent systems, simulation engines, and multi-location AI networks.

[00:37:57] minute

[00:38:01] nice looking cards I like those I like
[00:38:04] those ones a
[00:38:13] lot hey thank you ay you have a good day
[00:38:17] my friend I appreciate you coming in and
[00:38:18] hanging out that was some good hits you
[00:38:19] you ripped some good stuff out of that
[00:38:21] box you had the you had the good luck
[00:38:23] numbers today
[00:38:28] but luckily that box is loaded loaded
[00:38:31] with our secret layers so it's not even
[00:38:33] like he pulled anything out of it that's
[00:38:35] going to make him dent it's still all
[00:38:37] there the dent he made is negligible to
[00:38:41] that
[00:38:53] box wait I don't understand what you're
[00:38:55] getting at there Oblivion
[00:39:07] not sure I'm following that
[00:39:14] sorry oh you did he sent it you Pur run
[00:39:19] you secret ler
[00:39:29] can you get a pack card from the
[00:39:31] ultimate purchase in the game for chance
[00:39:34] to get full of or a different foil all
[00:39:37] right so you're
[00:39:39] saying like if you get the Rani
[00:39:42] one you want
[00:39:46] to pull also and then you get to choose
[00:39:49] between them is that what you're saying
[00:39:50] my understanding that one
[00:39:55] right I don't know if can do anything
[00:39:58] like that though that's the problem I
[00:39:59] don't know if I can do that I switch
[00:40:01] things around from for uh specifically
[00:40:04] that
[00:40:07] way so I do have to keep them the same I
[00:40:09] can't go and adjust it for everyone
[00:40:11] because that will get me in trouble with
[00:40:12] whatnot that's why I can't really do
[00:40:14] things like that that got up like last
[00:40:15] time I just bundled things together and
[00:40:17] they suspended me for a week so that's
[00:40:20] the only problem with some of the
[00:40:22] things
[00:40:25] yeah let me get you in here a
[00:40:30] yeah exactly Charles somebody had
[00:40:33] requested me to bundle a mystery bag and
[00:40:37] uh another item that I had which were
[00:40:39] these box things um and in the process
[00:40:41] of when I bundled them uh I got a
[00:40:44] suspension saying that they did not say
[00:40:46] the the floor medium and the floor
[00:40:49] ceiling and whatever on it um and I was
[00:40:53] like what are you talking about they
[00:40:54] right in there and they ended up getting
[00:40:56] like changing rule pretty much saying
[00:40:58] you can't bundle
[00:41:01] anymore yeah I know pretty crazy so yeah
[00:41:04] that's why I can't do certain things and
[00:41:06] change things around like that that's
[00:41:08] literally the reason why because if I do
[00:41:10] I can have I can be suspended for who
[00:41:13] knows how long and I don't want to have
[00:41:15] that
[00:41:16] happen somebody reported it that was
[00:41:18] watching it that was
[00:41:24] a like seriously that's your life
[00:41:27] you got to go and Report something like
[00:41:30] that yeah pretty much yeah
[00:41:35] yeah I don't need that anymore my tooth
[00:41:43] fixed remember I'm a dentist I fixed my
[00:41:45] own teeth

[00:43:16] I don't know it's up to you guys how we
[00:43:18] do let's do a thing here though I was
[00:43:23] thinking what I was going to do would
[00:43:25] should I
[00:43:26] do tomorrow or later tonight a box
[00:43:30] opening I was going to open another box
[00:43:31] of um modern Horizon three play boosters
[00:43:37] I was
[00:43:38] thinking but should I do that tomorrow
[00:43:42] should I do that to
[00:43:55] today pick from the ultimate for extreme
[00:43:58] game
[00:44:00] Peres oh like if we're playing a
[00:44:04] game
[00:44:07] um
[00:44:10] potentially tomorrow all right I think
[00:44:12] that's a good idea tomorrow yeah I'll
[00:44:14] tell everybody what it is we'll get a
[00:44:15] good plan I'll let everybody know
[00:44:16] tomorrow we're going to be open a box on
[00:44:18] the road to
[00:44:20] 1,000 all right project Nemesis a little
[00:44:23] uh see that's what I was asking because
[00:44:24] it's a Friday it's during the day so
[00:44:26] like I don't like to do things I'm
[00:44:27] figuring tomorrow then you guys get to
[00:44:29] watch it on a Saturday right day off
[00:44:31] more people have that was kind of my
[00:44:33] thought process but then at the same
[00:44:35] time like not everybody has those same
[00:44:36] days off you know maybe they don't have
[00:44:39] all that day off yeah yeah see that was
[00:44:42] my thought process but either way if we
[00:44:45] happen to get crazy today and for some
[00:44:47] reason we had some big hits that people
[00:44:49] bounce us up to a thousand followers
[00:44:51] then we'll be giving that away but as we
[00:44:53] go that's our road to 10,000 follower

[00:50:02] go good luck my
[00:50:13] friend um I have to put it on I'll have
[00:50:15] to put it on to sell it because I don't
[00:50:17] have it available if it's in the buy now
[00:50:18] then it is available to get um but like
[00:50:21] I was saying if you want to pull it from

[00:50:28] do here one two three four five six
[00:50:34] seven eight I'll have to pull it out of

[00:50:40] like I just have to double check quickly
[00:50:42] um but if it's in the buy now that does
[00:50:44] mean I have a spare is what I'm kind of
[00:50:45] getting at that makes sense sorry I
[00:50:47] wasn't clear there if it's in buy now

[01:04:43] if it's
[01:04:44] free or how much I can't say exactly if
[01:04:48] it's going to end up being free because
[01:04:49] it depends on the area but I think it
[01:04:50] does give you free shipping because of
[01:04:51] how much the weight of the pack is
[01:04:53] versus the weight of the other thing
[01:04:56] yeah I believe it does add up that way
[01:04:58] but I can't I'm not 100% on how it does
[01:05:02] that because I know between the two
[01:05:04] giveaways you should win you should have

[01:26:13] now
[01:26:15] ah all right so that's what you were
[01:26:17] making there that's actually kind of
[01:26:19] cool holding the cards there for holding
[01:26:22] top loaders
[01:26:24] ah I see what you're saying
[01:26:28] interesting ah kind of cool like little
[01:26:31] uh pedestals to hold your top
[01:26:33] loaders
[01:26:46] interesting yeah little card
[01:26:49] stands I like
[01:26:52] it that's actually not bad I like like
[01:26:59] them let's do this
[01:27:02] here all
[01:27:04] right you designed the Mells an even all
[01:27:06] right cool that's nice I I know I had
[01:27:09] somebody that was nice to me that did
[01:27:10] used to do that and design it in my old
[01:27:12] house but I haven't done it in a
[01:27:14] while possibly I actually might want one
[01:27:16] of them to set them up here we'll see
[01:27:18] about it I'll think about that in a
[01:27:19] minute because I don't know if I like I
[01:27:21] like the Legos but that's kind of a cool
[01:27:22] idea to set them up that way I can set
[01:27:23] the cards
[01:27:24] or maybe there would be one that like it
[01:27:26] could set like multiple cards in it
[01:27:32] somehow
[01:27:34] Maddie let's see what we got going on
[01:27:37] here you bought yourself that premium
[01:27:41] box which is up here we got a premium
[01:27:45] loot box my
[01:27:47] friend now would you like to give me a
[01:27:51] number any dollar St today
[01:27:54] um I wasn't doing any specifically I
[01:27:58] generally do on cards and
[01:28:00] stuff but um maybe I might do some at
[01:28:03] some point later today one two three
[01:28:06] four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12
[01:28:11] and 13 because you know maybe if we get
[01:28:14] like 50 or so people in here I might do
[01:28:15] some dollar
[01:28:16] starts all right here we go
[01:28:19] Matt let's zoom in a little bit zoom
[01:28:21] zoom zoom and you've gotten yourself
[01:28:24] a modern Horizon 3 play booster in a
[01:28:26] pistol
[01:28:28] oo hey you got Wasteland right now so if
[01:28:31] you want to play the game you now have a
[01:28:35] pistol to help yourself in the Wasteland

[01:28:40] Horizon
[01:28:42] 3 play
[01:28:44] booster nice hit my friend nice one
[01:28:58] ah make
[01:29:02] it yeah that's not a bad idea sell the
[01:29:04] file online a lot of people buy stuff
[01:29:06] online if you put them on that uh what
[01:29:07] is that place that name of that thing oh
[01:29:10] so I was looking into it because I was
[01:29:11] doing stuff for 3D printing on for
[01:29:13] drones and I was having people print
[01:29:14] that parts for me so I was going and
[01:29:16] looking them up at one point that was
[01:29:17] like five six years ago though all right
[01:29:20] Maddie we going to cut this open and
[01:29:21] look at it generally we do but I just
[01:29:23] want to double check
[01:29:28] first or maybe two pieces and have that
[01:29:30] clipped together somehow like Lego clip
[01:29:33] together or like maybe like a little
[01:29:34] triangle with like the triangle slot
[01:29:36] open all right Maddie let's see what we
[01:29:39] get that way you can kind of like set
[01:29:41] them together and have multiple together
[01:29:43] like that's how it sets it's a little
[01:29:44] triangle and the Little Triangle sticks
[01:29:45] out and you can sit like three of them
[01:29:47] together as many of you want that way
[01:29:50] you could have like 50 of them if you
[01:29:52] really wanted to because they'd all be
[01:29:53] sent together

[02:08:55] goodbye
[02:08:58] nice with a
[02:09:02] blue got some good
[02:09:05] hits got some good hits not bad at
[02:09:11] all ohare Chasm is a nice one if you
[02:09:14] have a if you're a green if you run
[02:09:15] green
[02:09:24] well they can but it depends on how you
[02:09:25] keep them if you keep them in foils and
[02:09:27] top loaders it's not going to happen
[02:09:29] it's mainly due to where you are and the
[02:09:31] moisture in them so some people even
[02:09:32] have humid or they keep them in so they
[02:09:34] will do that but the rule of Rage it
[02:09:38] depends on how you keep them
[02:09:44] too so it's one of those things it's
[02:09:46] like a
[02:09:47] 5050 because most of the good topload uh
[02:09:51] uh
[02:09:51] foils I keep in top loaders like this
[02:09:53] which keep them
[02:09:58] straight yes there was a random foil
[02:10:00] there that is
[02:10:08] correct oh there it
[02:10:10] is
[02:10:13] welcome there we go my friend nice
[02:10:18] one is everything for curvys what do you
[02:10:21] mean
[02:10:25] maybe I I got I got I'm not following
[02:10:27] that
[02:10:38] one oh yes yes I tried humidity for
[02:10:42] Cirby cards yes correct yeah I try to
[02:10:44] protect
[02:10:45] them yeah environment is definitely
[02:10:47] everything and that's what it is and as
[02:10:48] long as you like protect them too like
[02:10:50] people will even take them and they'll
[02:10:51] put them in a
[02:10:52] humidor um so they straighten out and
[02:10:54] then they'll take it they'll sleeve them
[02:10:56] like put them in like one of these like
[02:10:58] the um those uh what do you call them
[02:10:59] the um Perfect Fit sleeves and put them
[02:11:02] in their ones that they would normally
[02:11:03] put in their deck and that keeps them
[02:11:04] all straight and Flash because the FL uh
[02:11:06] flush because the humidity is correct in
[02:11:08] them so they
[02:11:09] are oh you live in Georgia see I live in
[02:11:11] Florida so I understand
[02:11:14] that so yeah we get PRL but I put a lot
[02:11:16] of my good ones in top loaders and I
[02:11:18] never have an issue
[02:11:22] plus if you're going to get it Ser um
[02:11:24] like um rided not going to be an issue
[02:11:27] on that either
[02:11:30] too yeah something heavy like a book or
[02:11:33] something and they'll keep them together
[02:11:34] so they will um so it actually
[02:11:36] straightens out too that's another thing
[02:11:37] you can do to keep them straightened so
[02:11:40] you like take take your book or whatever
[02:11:41] and stick them through between them
[02:11:43] that's a good
[02:11:47] one we used to do that with uh like
[02:11:49] feathers and stuff with uh feathers and
[02:11:53] um leaves and um flowers that's what I
[02:11:57] was looking for different flowers when

[02:39:49] put it in there
[02:39:51] earlier so I know one one in there and
[02:39:53] I'm guessing that's where you saw it
[02:39:57] actually so we'll do
[02:40:00] this we'll replace that arm chant with

[02:40:36] there I'm sitting there I'm trying to
[02:40:38] figure out why you would have seen it

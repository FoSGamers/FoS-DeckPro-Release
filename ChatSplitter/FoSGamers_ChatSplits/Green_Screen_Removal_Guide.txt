How do I adjust and get rid of a green screen in DaVinci Resolve? And this is in the version 18.6.

To remove a green screen in **DaVinci Resolve 18.6**, you'll use the **Chroma Key** tool in the **Fusion** tab. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:

### 1. **Import Your Footage**
   - Open **DaVinci Resolve** and load your project.
   - Import your green screen footage and place it on the timeline in the **Edit** tab.

### 2. **Go to Fusion**
   - Select the clip with the green screen in the timeline.
   - Click on the **Fusion** tab (bottom of the screen) to enter the Fusion workspace.

### 3. **Apply the Chroma Key**
   - In the **Nodes** section (bottom part of the Fusion workspace), you should see two nodes: **MediaIn1** (your video input) and **MediaOut1** (the final output).
   - Click **MediaIn1** to select it.
   - Press **Shift + Spacebar** to bring up the tool search box and search for "Delta Keyer." Once found, click **Add** to apply the Delta Keyer node.
   
### 4. **Keying Out the Green Screen**
   - With the **Delta Keyer** node selected, go to the **Inspector** panel on the right side.
   - In the **Background Color** section of the Inspector, you'll see an eyedropper icon. Click it, and then click on the green part of your footage in the preview window. This will key out the green screen.
   - The green screen should disappear, leaving the subject or foreground.

### 5. **Refining the Key**
   - If the key is not clean or there are green edges, you can refine it:
     - Under the **Matte** settings in the Delta Keyer node, adjust the sliders such as **Threshold**, **Gain**, or **Erode/Expand** to fine-tune the edges.
     - Use the **Clean Foreground** and **Clean Background** options to further refine the key.

### 6. **Add Your Background**
   - Go back to the **Edit** tab.
   - Drag and drop your background footage or image onto the timeline, placing it on a track **beneath** the green screen footage.
   - Your subject should now appear over the new background.

### 7. **Final Adjustments**
   - If necessary, adjust the color and lighting of the keyed footage in the **Color** tab to match the background.
   - You can also add a slight **blur** or feather to the edges of the subject for a more natural look.

### Summary
1. **Import** your green screen footage and background footage.
2. Go to the **Fusion** tab and apply the **Delta Keyer** to your green screen footage.
3. Use the **eyedropper** tool to select the green screen color and key it out.
4. **Refine** the key by adjusting settings in the **Matte** section.
5. Place your background **beneath** the green screen footage in the **Edit** tab.
6. **Adjust** color and lighting for a seamless blend.

By following these steps, you’ll be able to remove the green screen and replace it with a new background using DaVinci Resolve 18.6.

How to do I make the whole video 9:16 for exporting in 4k

[2024-09-06 17:27:01] ChatGPT:
To export a 9:16 aspect ratio video (vertical format) in 4K in **DaVinci Resolve 18.6**, follow these steps:

### 1. **Create a New Project or Open an Existing One**
   - Open **DaVinci Resolve** and either create a new project or open the one you're working on.

### 2. **Change Timeline Resolution to 9:16 Aspect Ratio (Vertical)**
   - Go to the **Edit** tab.
   - In the top menu, click on **File** > **Project Settings** (or press **Shift + 9**).
   - In the **Master Settings** tab (default tab that opens), under **Timeline Resolution**, you'll need to enter a custom resolution for 9:16.
     - Set the **Resolution** to **2160 x 3840** for 4K vertical video (instead of 3840 x 2160 which is standard 4K horizontal).
     - **Important:** Ensure the pixel dimensions reflect 9:16 (2160 width by 3840 height).

### 3. **Position Your Footage in the New Aspect Ratio**
   - Once the aspect ratio is changed, you may need to adjust the position of your footage to fit the 9:16 frame.
     - Select the clip in the timeline.
     - In the **Inspector** on the right, under the **Transform** settings, adjust the **Zoom** and **Position** sliders to fit your content appropriately within the vertical frame.
     - If your original footage is in 16:9 or another aspect ratio, this step is critical to ensure your subject remains in the frame.

### 4. **Check for Any Additional Clips or Assets**
   - Make sure all clips, text, and other assets are appropriately aligned and scaled to fit the new vertical aspect ratio.

### 5. **Set Export Settings for 9:16 in 4K**
   - Once you’ve adjusted everything, click on the **Deliver** tab (located at the bottom of the screen).
   - Under the **Render Settings** on the left:
     - Set **Format** to your desired codec (H.264, H.265, etc.).
     - In the **Resolution** dropdown, select **Custom** and manually set the resolution to **2160 x 3840** (same as the timeline settings for vertical 4K).
     - Ensure the **Frame Rate** matches the one you used in your project (e.g., 24, 30, or 60 fps).
   
### 6. **Render and Export**
   - Double-check all your settings, then click **Add to Render Queue**.
   - In the **Render Queue** on the right, click **Start Render** to export your 9:16 4K video.

### Summary
1. Set the timeline resolution to **2160 x 3840** for vertical 4K (9:16 aspect ratio).
2. Adjust the **Zoom** and **Position** of your clips to fit the new frame in the **Inspector**.
3. In the **Deliver** tab, set the export resolution to **2160 x 3840** and match the frame rate.
4. **Render** the video.

This will export your video in vertical 4K format, ideal for social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts.

[00:31:28] I think what's in here let me double
[00:31:29] check what's in
[00:31:34] here there are TSR some
[00:31:41] sorcery I believe there's some sorcery
[00:31:43] in there

[01:30:59] chat on
[01:31:03] YouTube well there we
[01:31:06] go and then I'm going to do this here to
[01:31:09] see where we stand on our
[01:31:11] check-ins we can see where we stand on
[01:31:14] our
[01:31:16] [Music]
[01:31:18] check-ins we are currently at 83 83 oh
[01:31:24] we're we're going we're almost
[01:31:27] there if we had a lot of people and
[01:31:29] everybody checked in all the time we'd
[01:31:30] be good but the problem is not everybody
[01:31:32] checks in see see we have 20 people in
[01:31:35] here every five minutes if you all 20
[01:31:37] people checked in right now that would
[01:31:41] put us almost near our goal 27 people
[01:31:45] then if all 27 of you checked in five
[01:31:48] minutes later that would put us over the
[01:31:50] goal this is what I'm saying you guys
[01:31:52] just need to help out it's not me it's
[01:31:55] you in the chat doing

[01:32:09] you want
[01:32:13] it so get every five minutes you get to
[01:32:16] check in so that means if all of you

[01:32:19] would put us over our goal of 150 to get
[01:32:22] a single and that single is going to end

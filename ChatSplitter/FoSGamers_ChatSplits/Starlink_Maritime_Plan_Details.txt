You can check all the Starlink rules and regulations. I have a plan that's like $250 for maritime or like ocean or traveling like that thing, but not for the 50G thing. I want to make sure that it's okay to use it when I'm out playing in the ocean, but only within a certain distance of land.

**Data Usage:**

What is considered Inland?

[2025-02-13 11:15:49] ChatGPT:
Starlink defines "inland" regions as areas labeled "Available," "Waitlist," or "Coming Soon" on their Availability Map. These regions encompass land masses and may include inland bodies of water such as lakes and rivers. Conversely, areas depicted in black on the map are considered ocean regions, which include marinas, coastlines, and offshore waters. While marinas and coastal areas are marked as ocean regions, Starlink service is available for stationary use in these locations. citeturn0search4

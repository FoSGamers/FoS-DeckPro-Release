I need you to make sure you thoroughly understand the whatnot Terms of Service, and then go and make sure the game I'm giving you right now is going to work. It is a Poll Box for 430 cards, where you get three polls at a time. If you get an Elite, you stop. If you get a card that has Beta written on it for a Beta Booster of Sorcery, you stop. Or if you pull three cards, you stop. Each poll starts at $2 for what it will be sold for. And all the cards are Sorcery Beta cards that are Ordinary, except for the Elites that are in there, where there are 20 Elites in there, and then there's also 10 cards that say Beta on them. So that's how it works. I need you to write up the rules for me and make sure it's within Whatnot's Terms of Service.

[2024-08-14 06:51:02] ChatGPT:
To ensure that your Poll Box game aligns with Whatnot's Terms of Service, I'll first outline the rules for your game and then assess its compliance with Whatnot's policies.

### Game Rules: Poll Box for 430 Sorcery Beta Cards

**Game Name:** Sorcery Beta Poll Box

**Game Description:**
- **Total Cards:** 430 Sorcery Beta cards, primarily Ordinary cards.
- **Special Cards:** 20 Elite cards and 10 cards labeled "Beta," which represent a Beta Booster for Sorcery.

**How the Game Works:**
1. **Polling Mechanics:**
   - Participants pull three cards at a time from the Poll Box.
   - Each pull (set of three cards) costs $2.
   - The participant can only stop when:
     1. They pull an Elite card.
     2. They pull a card labeled "Beta" (redeemable for a Beta Booster of Sorcery).
     3. They complete their third pull (three cards in total).

2. **Stopping Conditions:**
   - If a participant pulls an Elite card, their polling session ends immediately.
   - If a participant pulls a card labeled "Beta," their polling session ends immediately.
   - If neither an Elite nor a Beta card is pulled after three cards, their session ends after the third card.

3. **Winning Conditions:**
   - Pulling an Elite card awards the participant that specific Elite card.
   - Pulling a card labeled "Beta" awards the participant a Beta Booster of Sorcery.
   - If neither is pulled, the participant keeps the three Ordinary cards drawn.

### Whatnot Terms of Service Considerations

#### Key Points to Review:
1. **Gambling Elements:**
   - Whatnot's Terms of Service prohibits games that resemble gambling or involve a chance element tied to a prize where participants pay money. Your Poll Box game needs to be structured in a way that avoids resembling gambling.

2. **Fairness and Transparency:**
   - The game should be fair and transparent to all participants. This includes clearly communicating the rules, odds, and prizes.

3. **Refund Policy:**
   - Ensure there’s a clear refund policy in place, especially if the game involves elements where participants might feel dissatisfied with their draws.

4. **Prohibited Items:**
   - Verify that the Sorcery Beta cards and Beta Boosters are not prohibited items under Whatnot's policies.

### Compliance Check:

1. **Gambling Concerns:**
   - Your game could potentially be seen as gambling since participants pay for a chance to win specific items (Elites or Beta Boosters). However, since every participant is guaranteed to receive something (at least three Ordinary cards), it might not fall under the strictest gambling definitions. Still, the structure needs to be clear to ensure it’s seen as a purchase rather than a bet.

2. **Fairness and Transparency:**
   - Clearly state how many Elite and Beta cards are in the box and how many cards are in total (430). Make sure the odds are transparent. Since every participant gets something, it’s more likely to be compliant.

3. **Prohibited Items:**
   - Sorcery Beta cards and Beta Boosters should be verified as allowable items on Whatnot.

4. **Refunds:**
   - Clarify if there’s a refund option in the case of dissatisfaction, though this is optional depending on Whatnot’s policy requirements.

### Final Notes:

- **Clear Communication:** Make sure all these details are clearly communicated in the game’s description on Whatnot.
- **Whatnot Approval:** If you have any doubts about compliance, it may be best to contact Whatnot directly to get approval or clarification.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to the rules or structure of the game to better align with Whatnot's Terms of Service, or do you need help drafting the specific text for Whatnot?

[2024-08-14 06:51:50] ChatGPT:
Thank you for the clarification. Here’s a more concise set of rules tailored for a Pull Box format, along with a compliance check for Whatnot’s Terms of Service.

### Pull Box Rules: Sorcery Beta Edition

**Game Name:** Sorcery Beta Pull Box

**Overview:**
- **Total Cards in Pull Box:** 430 Sorcery Beta cards
- **Special Cards:** 20 Elite cards, 10 Beta cards (redeemable for a Beta Booster of Sorcery)

**How to Play:**
1. **Price Per Pull:** $2 per pull.
2. **Pulling Mechanics:**
   - Participants purchase pulls from the box, each pull consisting of three cards.
   - Participants keep all three cards drawn in each pull.

3. **Special Card Conditions:**
   - **Elite Card:** If a participant pulls an Elite card, they keep it, and their turn ends.
   - **Beta Card:** If a participant pulls a Beta card, they receive a Beta Booster of Sorcery, and their turn ends.
   - **No Special Cards:** If neither an Elite nor a Beta card is pulled, the participant keeps the three Ordinary cards drawn, and their turn ends.

**Special Notes:**
- The pull box contains a mix of Ordinary, Elite, and Beta cards, but every participant is guaranteed to receive the cards they pull.
- There are 20 Elite cards and 10 Beta cards mixed into the 430-card pool, making the odds transparent to all participants.

### Compliance with Whatnot’s Terms of Service

#### Key Considerations:
1. **Gambling Elements:**
   - The Pull Box format, where participants pay to pull a set number of cards and receive whatever they draw, is generally more compliant than games involving random chances or higher-value prizes. Since all participants receive the cards they pull, it reduces the resemblance to gambling.

2. **Fairness and Transparency:**
   - Clearly communicate the number of Elite and Beta cards in the box, as well as the total number of cards (430). This ensures transparency and fairness, as participants know the odds.

3. **Refund Policy:**
   - While not strictly required, offering clarity on refunds or exchanges, if any, can help with customer satisfaction.

4. **Prohibited Items:**
   - Ensure that the Sorcery Beta cards and Beta Boosters are allowed for sale on Whatnot by reviewing their prohibited items list or contacting their support if uncertain.

### Suggested Game Description for Whatnot:

**Game Title:** Sorcery Beta Pull Box

**Description:**
- **Price per Pull:** $2 for three cards.
- **Total Cards:** 430 Sorcery Beta cards.

This structure should comply with Whatnot's Terms of Service, as it ensures that all participants receive something for their money, minimizing any resemblance to gambling and enhancing transparency.

Would you like any further refinements, or do you need additional details?

[2024-08-14 06:52:08] FoSGamers:
The pulls are up to three cards at a time. They pull one at a time, and if it happens to be an Elite, we stop, or if it happens to have a Beta written on it for a Sorcerer or Beta Booster, we stop.

[2024-08-14 06:52:32] ChatGPT:
The user clarified that in their Pull Box game, participants pull one card at a time, and the pull stops if an Elite card is drawn or if a card labeled "Beta" (for a Beta Booster) is drawn. Otherwise, the participant may continue pulling up to three cards in total.

[2024-08-14 06:52:32] FoSGamers:

You misunderstood. That is the contents of the box of what they could possibly get from it for what the floor, ceiling, and average were when they get a poll out of there. The cost is still $2 for their polls, though.

Okay, I have another thing I'm going to be doing. It's going to be called a Chaos Break. So what I need you to do is make sure you understand the Terms of Service in regards to breaks, and make sure gambling and all that stuff is understood 100% completely from whatnot. And then what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be doing a Chaos Break, I'm going to call it. And what it will be is there will be a bunch of packs from different sets of Magic the Gathering. They will be – the break will occur where the packs are opened, all of the rares are sleeved up. Everybody that purchased a spot in the break will have a – it will start with their name first. Whoever purchased first will go one through there for how many people are set in the break. And then what I do is I shuffle up all of the rares, mythics, or cards that are worth we'll say $1 or more. No. We shuffle up all of the cards that are worth $3 or more. And then every other card is put in – unless it's a rare. If it's a rare, it gets thrown in there. Or like mythic or whatever, anything above rare gets thrown in there. But if it's uncommon or common, it has to be $3 or more to be put in with the ones we shuffled up. So we'll shuffle all those up and I'll hand them out from the top card that I shuffled to the first person, the next person, and so on and so forth until I completely hand out all of the cards. We'll flip them over and see what each person gets. And then what I will end up doing is I'll do the same thing for the commons and uncommons where I will go through and I'm going to hand them out one at a time after putting them all in the sleeves. So I'll hand them out one at a time the same way and then I'll put a chunk of them in the sleeves to be able to ship them out. Now that's the plan of what I was doing. Make sure that will work. It shouldn't matter what card sets I'm doing since all of them will be broken live on stream. Not that we'll see anything that it isn't. So let me know if that's good. I will generate what the rules would be in the description of product and everything like that so I can put it in the description of it and it has everything needed so everybody knows exactly what it is. I will manually add the packs that we're going to be using. Actually what you can do is you can say packs that are on screen. Packs I'm talking about live on screen is what it's going to be. And I'll show that multiple times so that people see it too. If it has questions, it will say ask for questions, something like that. Make sure the description is thorough but not large, big enough for a what not description. And also I need to have a description, a what not show notes created that goes over what the Chaos Break is, but also that cool stuff about how you want to be part of our team, part of FOS Gamers, join the link tree and join the office and Discord and all that cool things. Pull people into the community of FOS Gamers type thing. I want you to make it extremely exciting like you've done for all the other show notes. Put all that extra information in there that we need and also the description that I'm talking about.

### Whatnot Terms of Service Compliance for Chaos Breaks

#### Key Considerations:
1. **Gambling Elements:**
   - Whatnot prohibits any form of gambling. In a break, as long as all participants receive value (i.e., cards) for their purchase and the process is fair and transparent, the activity should comply with Whatnot’s Terms of Service.
   - Your Chaos Break involves distributing all opened cards to participants, ensuring that everyone receives something, which reduces the gambling risk.

2. **Fairness and Transparency:**
   - Clear communication of the process is crucial. The order in which participants receive cards, how the cards are shuffled and distributed, and the criteria for including cards (e.g., only rares, mythics, or cards worth $3 or more) must be clearly explained.
   - Displaying the packs live on screen and encouraging questions adds to the transparency.

3. **Prohibited Items:**
   - Ensure all Magic: The Gathering packs and cards used in the break are permitted on Whatnot. Avoid including any restricted or prohibited items.

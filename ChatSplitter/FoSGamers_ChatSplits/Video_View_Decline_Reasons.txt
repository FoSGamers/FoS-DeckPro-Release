Why are my videos on YouTube going from 10,000 views only to 100 views? What would have caused that when they are the same type of videos and the same type of things that were always getting thousands of views, like 10,000 views or more?

[2024-08-11 11:17:19] ChatGPT:
Seeing a sudden drop in views on your YouTube videos can be concerning, especially when you're producing similar content that was previously successful. There could be several reasons for this decline:

### 1. **Algorithm Changes:**
   - YouTube's algorithm constantly evolves. Changes in how videos are recommended to users can significantly impact viewership. If the algorithm now favors different types of content or engagement metrics, this could explain the drop.

### 2. **Audience Saturation:**
   - Your target audience may have become saturated with similar content. If many creators are producing similar videos, the audience may be spread thin, leading to fewer views per video.

### 3. **Content Quality Perception:**
   - Even if the content is similar, slight variations in quality, style, or engagement could affect how viewers perceive and interact with your videos. A decline in viewer retention or engagement (likes, comments, shares) can cause YouTube to recommend your videos less often.

### 4. **Changes in Titles, Thumbnails, and Descriptions:**
   - The effectiveness of your titles, thumbnails, and descriptions plays a huge role in attracting clicks. If these have changed or aren't as compelling as before, it could result in fewer views.

### 5. **Seasonal or Temporal Factors:**
   - Sometimes, viewership can drop due to external factors like holidays, exams, or major events that divert attention from YouTube.

### 6. **Subscriber Activity:**
   - If your subscribers aren't as active or engaged, your videos might not be getting pushed to as many people. This can happen if your subscriber base isn't regularly watching your content.

### 7. **Shadow Banning or Content Suppression:**
   - In some cases, content might be suppressed due to perceived violations of YouTube's guidelines, even if you haven't received explicit strikes or warnings. This can result in fewer recommendations.

### 8. **Competition:**
   - There may be increased competition within your niche. If more creators are producing high-quality content on similar topics, it could be drawing viewers away from your channel.

### 9. **Viewer Preferences Shift:**
   - Over time, audience preferences can shift. If your content doesn't align with these new preferences, viewers might not engage as much, leading to fewer recommendations from YouTube.

### 10. **Platform Glitches:**
   - Occasionally, platform glitches can cause discrepancies in view counts. This might be temporary, but it’s worth considering if the drop was sudden and drastic.

### **Steps to Address the Issue:**
1. **Analyze Analytics:**
   - Dive deep into your YouTube analytics to identify where the drop is happening (e.g., specific demographics, locations, traffic sources).
2. **Engage with Your Audience:**
   - Ask your viewers directly (in videos or community posts) what they want to see and why they might not be watching as much.
3. **Experiment with Content:**
   - Try tweaking your content format, titles, thumbnails, or posting schedule to see if it impacts viewership.
4. **Promote on Other Platforms:**
   - Use social media, email newsletters, or collaborations to drive traffic to your YouTube channel.
5. **Stay Updated with YouTube Changes:**
   - Regularly check YouTube’s creator resources for updates on algorithm changes or best practices.

### Summary:
Your views on YouTube may have dropped from 10,000 to 100 due to algorithm changes, audience saturation, content quality perception, or other factors like increased competition or shifts in viewer preferences. Analyzing your channel's analytics, engaging with your audience, and experimenting with different content strategies can help you address this issue.

How do I address shadow banning?

[2024-08-11 11:19:03] ChatGPT:
Addressing shadow banning, especially on platforms like YouTube, can be challenging because it's not always clear if shadow banning is occurring, and the platform may not provide direct feedback. However, here are steps you can take to mitigate and potentially resolve the issue:

### 1. **Review Content for Policy Compliance:**
   - **Go through YouTube’s Community Guidelines and Terms of Service**: Ensure that your content doesn't violate any rules. Even unintentional violations (like using certain keywords or themes) can lead to suppression.
   - **Check for Copyright Issues**: If your videos contain copyrighted material (music, images, etc.), they might be suppressed. Use YouTube’s Content ID tool to check for any potential copyright claims.
   - **Avoid Controversial Topics**: Certain topics may lead to content being flagged or limited in reach. Review your content to see if any of your videos might fall into this category.

### 2. **Examine Analytics for Patterns:**
   - **Look for drops in specific metrics**: Such as views, watch time, or engagement on specific videos or over time.
   - **Analyze Traffic Sources**: If you notice a sharp decline in views from “Browse features” or “Suggested videos,” it could indicate suppression.
   - **Audience Retention**: If people aren't watching your videos for long, it might signal to YouTube that the content isn't engaging, which could reduce recommendations.

### 3. **Adjust Content Strategy:**
   - **Diversify Content**: Try creating different types of content or experimenting with new formats to see if it affects reach.
   - **Optimize Titles, Thumbnails, and Descriptions**: Avoid using clickbait or misleading titles. Ensure that your thumbnails are not overly sensationalized or misleading, as this can sometimes trigger suppression.
   - **Improve Engagement**: Encourage comments, likes, and shares. More engagement signals to YouTube that your content is valuable.

### 4. **Appeal to YouTube Support:**
   - **Contact YouTube Support**: If you suspect shadow banning, reach out to YouTube’s creator support. Provide evidence from your analytics showing the drop in views and ask for clarification.
   - **Use the YouTube Community Forum**: Sometimes, other creators or community members can offer insights or suggest strategies to address suppression.

### 5. **Engage with Your Audience:**
   - **Communicate with Your Audience**: Let your viewers know if you’re facing issues with visibility and encourage them to turn on notifications and engage more actively with your content.
   - **Build a Community Off-Platform**: Consider using platforms like Discord, Twitter, or an email newsletter to maintain communication with your audience, ensuring they stay informed about your content even if YouTube visibility drops.

### 6. **Regularly Update and Diversify Your Channel:**
   - **Stay Active**: Regularly upload new content to keep your channel active and relevant.
   - **Collaborate with Other Creators**: Collaborations can introduce your content to new audiences, potentially boosting visibility.

### 7. **Monitor and Adjust Keywords and Tags:**
   - **Use Appropriate Tags and Keywords**: Avoid using tags or keywords that could be flagged as spammy or misleading. Focus on relevant and specific keywords.

### Summary:
To address potential shadow banning on YouTube, start by ensuring your content complies with platform guidelines and policies. Analyze your channel’s analytics to identify any patterns of suppression and adjust your content strategy accordingly. Engage with your audience to boost engagement, and consider appealing to YouTube support for clarification. Additionally, diversify your content and maintain communication with your audience through other platforms to mitigate the effects of reduced visibility.

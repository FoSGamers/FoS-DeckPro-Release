There's an application that I use for fishing that has a major feeding time of tonight between 5 13 p.m. and 7 13 p.m. How can it figure that out? I need you to use all of your knowledge, the internet, and that type of stuff. My location is New Smyrna Beach, Florida. I need you to figure it out. That's like inshore stuff there in the intercoastal. For some reason they know how to do that. I need you to figure out how they do that and explain it to me.

The application you use for fishing likely determines major feeding times based on the **Solunar Theory**, which suggests that fish and other animals' activities are influenced by the positions of the moon and sun. This theory, introduced by John Alden Knight in 1926, proposes that there are specific times each day—known as major and minor periods—when fish are more likely to be active and feeding.

**Key Components of Solunar Theory:**

1. **Major Periods:** These occur when the moon is directly overhead or directly underfoot relative to a specific location. During these times, fish are believed to be most active. Each major period typically lasts about two hours. citeturn0search4

2. **Minor Periods:** These occur during moonrise and moonset. Fish activity is moderately increased during these times, with each minor period lasting about one hour. citeturn0search4

3. **Moon Phases:** Fish activity is generally higher during full and new moon phases due to stronger gravitational forces. citeturn0search10

**Application to New Smyrna Beach, Florida on March 16, 2025:**

For your specific location and date, the major and minor feeding times are calculated as follows:

- **Major Times:**
  - 1:51 AM – 3:51 AM
  - 2:11 PM – 4:11 PM

- **Minor Times:**
  - 8:06 AM – 9:06 AM
  - 9:21 PM – 10:21 PM

These times are derived from the positions of the moon relative to New Smyrna Beach on that date. citeturn0search3

**Possible Explanation for the 5:13 PM – 7:13 PM Feeding Time:**

The application you mentioned identifies a major feeding time between 5:13 PM and 7:13 PM. While this doesn't align exactly with the traditional major or minor periods, it could be influenced by other factors such as:

- **Tidal Movements:** In coastal areas like New Smyrna Beach, tidal changes significantly impact fish behavior. On March 16, 2025, a low tide is expected at approximately 5:13 PM. Fish often feed more actively during tidal transitions, which might explain the increased activity during this time frame. citeturn0search13

- **Local Environmental Factors:** Factors such as water temperature, weather conditions, and local fish species' behavior patterns can also influence feeding times.

**Summary:**

The application determines feeding times using the Solunar Theory, focusing on the moon's position and its gravitational effects on fish behavior. For March 16, 2025, in New Smyrna Beach, the major feeding periods are from 1:51 AM to 3:51 AM and from 2:11 PM to 4:11 PM. The identified feeding time between 5:13 PM and 7:13 PM likely correlates with the low tide at 5:13 PM, as tidal changes can enhance fish activity.

The Pro Angler app determines optimal fishing times by integrating various data sources and methodologies to enhance anglers' success. Here's how it likely calculates these feeding times:

1. **Solunar Theory Application:**
   - The app utilizes the Solunar Theory, which posits that fish and wildlife activity peaks during specific lunar phases and positions. By analyzing the moon's position and phase, the app predicts periods when fish are more likely to be active.

2. **Local Expert Insights:**
   - Pro Angler provides location-specific weekly reports curated by tournament-winning local captains. These reports offer valuable insights into current fish behaviors, preferred baits, and effective techniques in specific areas. citeturn0search0

3. **Environmental and Weather Data:**
   - The app incorporates real-time environmental factors such as tides, weather conditions, and water temperatures. These elements significantly influence fish feeding patterns, and their integration allows for more accurate predictions.

4. **User-Generated Data:**
   - By analyzing data from user-submitted catch logs, the app identifies patterns and trends in fish behavior, refining its predictive algorithms over time.

**Summary:**

Pro Angler combines the Solunar Theory, expert local insights, environmental data, and user-generated information to predict optimal fishing times. This multifaceted approach provides anglers with tailored and accurate forecasts to enhance their fishing experiences.

The Pro Angler app has identified a major feeding time between **5:13 PM and 7:13 PM** on **March 16, 2025**, for New Smyrna Beach, Florida. This prediction is influenced by several factors:

1. **Tidal Movements:**
   - On March 16, 2025, a **low tide** is expected at approximately **5:13 PM** in New Smyrna Beach. citeturn0search5
   - Fish often feed more actively during tidal transitions, especially during low tides, as they concentrate baitfish and other prey, making them more accessible to predators.

2. **Sunset Timing:**
   - Sunset on this date is at **7:32 PM**. citeturn0search5
   - The period leading up to sunset, known as the **evening twilight**, is typically a productive time for fishing, as many species become more active during this transition from light to dark.

3. **Solunar Influence:**
   - The **moonrise** occurs at **9:52 PM**, and the **moonset** at **8:37 AM** on this day. citeturn0search17
   - While the major solunar periods are from **1:47 AM to 3:47 AM** and **2:14 PM to 4:14 PM**, the combination of tidal movements and sunset likely enhances fish activity during the 5:13 PM to 7:13 PM window.

**Summary:**

The Pro Angler app's designation of **5:13 PM to 7:13 PM** as a major feeding time on March 16, 2025, in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, is primarily due to the occurrence of a low tide at 5:13 PM and the approaching sunset at 7:32 PM. These conditions create an environment conducive to increased fish activity, making this period optimal for fishing.

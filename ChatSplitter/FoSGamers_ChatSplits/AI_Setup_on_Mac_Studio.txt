   pip list --outdated | grep -v 'Package' | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -n1 pip install -U
   ```

2. **Schedule Dependency Updates:**

   Similar to the AI model updates, use `cron` to schedule this script.

   ```bash
   30 2 * * * /path/to/update_dependencies.sh >> /path/to/dependency_log.log 2>&1
   ```

### **D. Automating Reboots and Service Restarts**

Ensure that after updates, services or scripts are restarted to apply changes.

1. **Add Restart Commands to Update Scripts:**

   ```bash
   # After updating the AI model
   pkill -f run_ai_model.py
   nohup python run_ai_model.py &
   ```

2. **Handle System Reboots:**

   Use `launchd` to manage services that need to restart after a system reboot.

   - Create a `.plist` file in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`:

     ```xml
     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
     <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
     <plist version="1.0">
     <dict>
         <key>Label</key>
         <string>com.user.ai_model</string>
         <key>ProgramArguments</key>
         <array>
             <string>/usr/bin/python3</string>
             <string>/path/to/run_ai_model.py</string>
         </array>
         <key>RunAtLoad</key>
         <true/>
         <key>KeepAlive</key>
         <true/>
     </dict>
     </plist>
     ```

   - Load the plist:

     ```bash
     launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.ai_model.plist
     ```

9. Final Recommendations
Maintain Consistency:
Ensure that the branding (logo, font, color scheme), calls to action (CTAs), and general presentation remain consistent across all platforms (YouTube, Whatnot, Instagram, Twitter (X), and Facebook). Consistency will reinforce the FoSGamers brand and make the streams feel polished.
Engage the Community:
Implement community challenges like Deck Building Contests, Fan Art Competitions, and Creative Content Challenges during live streams. These keep the audience involved and add excitement to daily and weekly streams.
Encourage participation in the FoSGamers Scavenger Hunt by promoting it heavily throughout the stream and on all social platforms.
Track and Analyze Performance:
Use analytics on each platform to track which giveaways, challenges, or promotional strategies are resonating the most with your audience. Adjust future events based on community feedback and participation levels.
Celebrate Community Contributions:
Regularly feature viewer-created content (e.g., deck builds, fan art, stream clips, memes) in your streams. Shout out the creators to encourage future participation and foster a sense of loyalty and belonging within your community.
Plan Ahead:
Use a content calendar to plan streams, breaks, scavenger hunts, and giveaways well in advance. This ensures that you can effectively promote upcoming events and maintain momentum in your content output.

Viewers are automatically entered into these giveaways simply by watching the stream, and prizes are announced live.

B. Break Details
Biggest Loser Break:
Objective: The participant with the lowest-value cards wins a Commander Deck. The second lowest-value participant receives a booster sample.
Spot Allocation: The number of spots is determined during setup, with no pre-assigned spots. Participants are assigned spots randomly once the break begins.

Great, now what I need you to do is provide me with detailed steps in layman term to get this all set up and we should have it set up in stages so that I can get up and set up and can I at least use the AI to do some basic things and we can continue to upgrade and add more stuff as I learn more with it as we go in the stages. If possible I would like you to script this things that can be simply scripted so I wouldn't need to worry about making myself and then I can just run those to have certain things done most of it all of it whatever you think is most beneficial and you can do correctly. Now as we've said before this should all be layman term ways that you're writing this and it should be stages and layman term should be as if a 12 year old is going to be doing this. So let's make it very straightforward and exactly what needs to be done to implement this all in the stages required to get it all completed where you can at least get something set up and running within an hour or less we'll say and that way then once it's up and running I might even be able to have it do the rest of the other stages with the ability to know what are you telling me how to how to do it and I can teach you what to do but that's down the line we can figure it out there but at least want to have something set up like in an hour or less of doing some work on things or if you can even script it like I said to make it go in a second you know that would be wonderful then also if there are things that you can't find because you need to use the internet to get them let me know that way we can find a way we can switch over so you can use the internet to get that information

                 continue
             elif "schedule live stream" in user_input.lower():
                 # Schedule a live stream
                 print("Assistant: Let's schedule your live stream.")
                 title = input("Enter the stream title: ")
                 date = input("Enter the stream date (YYYY-MM-DD): ")
                 time = input("Enter the stream time (HH:MM, 24-hour format): ")
                 subprocess.run(["./schedule_stream.sh", title, date, time])
                 continue
             elif "trigger giveaway" in user_input.lower():
                 # Example: Trigger a giveaway
                 print("Assistant: What type of giveaway would you like to trigger? (milestone/viewer/random)")
                 giveaway_type = input("Enter giveaway type: ").lower()
                 if giveaway_type in ["milestone", "viewer", "random"]:
                     subprocess.run(["./manage_giveaways.sh", giveaway_type])
                 else:
                     print("Assistant: Invalid giveaway type. Please choose 'milestone', 'viewer', or 'random'.")
                 continue
             # Add more specific commands as needed

             # Call the GPT-4All script and pass the user input along with the guide
             result = subprocess.run(
                 ["python", "run_gpt4all.py"],
                 input=(guide + "\nUser: " + user_input + "\nAssistant:").encode(),
                 stdout=subprocess.PIPE
             )
             response = result.stdout.decode().strip()
             print(f"Assistant: {response}")

     if __name__ == "__main__":
         main()
     ```
   - **Install `python-dotenv`:**

Is there anything that we should do to enhance this further, whether it's the installation so that it's easy enough for the 12-year-old to do it by themselves, or do we have to enhance it so that the AI itself that we're installing is more enhanced to do the things I'm asking it to do in adjust stages or add stages and that type of thing, or change stages, whatever needs to be done and stuff within them. Figure out that there. Use all of your knowledge and any knowledge that you can gather from anywhere. Let me know if I need to search the internet, that way I can do something and switch over and have you search the internet for a certain thing based on the prompt you want me to use. Now just generally we need to beef this up so it does pretty much anything and everything I would want it to do. I would be able to just eventually by the end of it I want to be able to be able to talk to it in a Jarvis-like manner from the movies with Iron Man and they will be able to easily, the AI will be able to easily do anything that I want to and enhance my abilities because of how it can figure things out that I tell it to quickly without me having to go and do stuff manually with math or build something. Like it knows what it wants me to, I want it to do already since I've already taught it and since I already don't talk and since I already don't talk it knows how I think and knows how to do things so it does it automatically and I don't need to keep doing it over and over again over again from scratch since this will automatically know how to do it. That's pretty much what I want this thing to be able to do is be like a in a way a copy of my brain based on what I'm telling it and eventually maybe it can be a copy of my brain if I allowed somehow to sync my brain to it who knows

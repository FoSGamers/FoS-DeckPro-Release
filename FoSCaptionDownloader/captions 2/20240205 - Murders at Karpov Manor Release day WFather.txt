[00:02:35] get the wheel up in the corner there for
[00:02:37] you let's see uh let's see what we got
[00:02:39] going on today I made a little bit of
[00:02:40] changes I made some changes to the big
[00:02:42] boo
[00:02:43] book glad to be off of service when you
[00:02:45] know that's always a good thing
[00:02:47] definitely good to when you're off of
[00:02:48] service and you're able to take a break
[00:02:50] finally that is one of the better times
[00:02:52] when you're able to sat back and uh take
[00:02:54] a break and be off
[00:02:55] service well we did uh we went through
[00:02:59] and we updated this a little bit we
[00:03:01] thought it would be interesting if we
[00:03:03] added some more fun things in there like
[00:03:06] a consecrated
[00:03:09] Sphinx know maybe something like
[00:03:11] that we add some uh more little more
[00:03:16] um anime cards in
[00:03:19] here oh look at that even the Lord of
[00:03:21] the Rings collector booster is thrown in
[00:03:22] there for some luck maybe orella orella
[00:03:27] nice H foil anime there
[00:03:30] but there's uh there's um some additions
[00:03:32] we made to the Big Blue Book because it
[00:03:33] was getting a little empty and because
[00:03:35] it was getting empty we decided we
[00:03:36] needed to add some more cool stuff to it
[00:03:38] for you guys you know like little birds
[00:03:40] of
[00:03:41] paradise a little Temple Garden foil
[00:03:45] retro maybe a little permission denied a
[00:03:48] little steam vents
[00:03:50] retro foil got some good stuff
[00:03:55] there
[00:03:57] is we
[00:04:11] 8 a floor in this you know maybe that's
[00:04:15] what you're looking for am I am I
[00:04:17] breaking a little up a little bit I know
[00:04:19] it looked like I was breaking up a
[00:04:20] little bit there for a second but maybe
[00:04:22] that's what you're looking for and
[00:04:23] that's even one of the floors in here
[00:04:26] here you go 25 nice Little River Song
[00:04:29] but that's all we got in there and what
[00:04:31] happens in this big blue book is the
[00:04:32] better it gets is because every spin
[00:04:35] when you pull something out ends up
[00:04:38] being an open spot now that open spot
[00:04:41] you now get if you land on an open spot
[00:04:44] you get a murders at Carl manner
[00:04:45] collector
[00:04:47] booster I was glitching thank you that's
[00:04:50] interesting I got maybe it's fine now
[00:04:52] maybe it's like one of those startup
[00:04:54] startup uh
[00:04:56] glitches
[00:04:58] it but the boys are over here they're
[00:05:00] hanging out and they're trying out some
[00:05:02] um brick
[00:05:06] thing it didn't count that's all right
[00:05:09] don't worry about it try it out try your
[00:05:11] way what you going to do okay try
[00:05:12] different
[00:05:13] ways and that's what we get there every
[00:05:15] time a a card gets pulled out of there
[00:05:18] there ends up being a blank spot that
[00:05:20] Blank Spot ends up being a uh pack of
[00:05:25] murders at Carl Manor collector booster
[00:05:27] so that's pretty good deal I figured out
[00:05:29] there and that's why I was saying as the
[00:05:30] book grows it gets better and better and
[00:05:32] better because your odds get better to
[00:05:34] have a collector booster then you also
[00:05:38] get um better cards as it goes so like
[00:05:40] the low car gets pulled out well a low
[00:05:43] car gets pulled out well instead of
[00:05:44] there
[00:05:45] being 19 floors now in whatever range
[00:05:48] there are well that's going to mark that
[00:05:50] off and there's only going to be 18 then
[00:05:51] it's going to and you're going to have a
[00:05:52] better chance of hitting a Murders At
[00:05:54] Carlo Manor collector booster and as as
[00:05:57] as our book goes throughout the show it
[00:06:01] gets better and better odds for you guys
[00:06:03] for either walking away with a collector
[00:06:04] booster or walking away with a really
[00:06:07] good card that's kind of how I uh
[00:06:10] William that is Extremely
[00:06:15] Loud I do Lego things all the time and I
[00:06:18] don't dig in it like I'm digging through
[00:06:20] it trying to find the bottom of the
[00:06:22] earth
[00:06:24] William William yeah thank you growing
[00:06:29] up did to and I either dump them out and
[00:06:31] you look at them all out or you pick
[00:06:35] them up that's fine dump them all out
[00:06:37] right
[00:06:39] now or you pick out a handful and you
[00:06:43] start building with things you don't
[00:06:44] just dig to the bottom and try and find
[00:06:46] random stuff you know that's like a
[00:06:48] million that's fine you can put them in
[00:06:50] together are you even going to pick that
[00:06:52] up kids sometimes William listen your
[00:06:56] father all right here we go Captain
[00:06:59] Adrian all right that's still a little
[00:07:00] bit loud that's Qui
[00:07:03] sorry all right boys well this is going
[00:07:05] to work wonderfully I think here we go
[00:07:08] let's see if you guys want to try
[00:07:09] something a little bit different though
[00:07:10] we're going to do this with a actually
[00:07:12] we're going to do it with a pack here
[00:07:13] because some of you guys were liking it
[00:07:15] when we did it with a pack now hey
[00:07:17] anybody want a collector booster of
[00:07:20] Exelon maybe with a with a big blue book
[00:07:25] pull what do we say here we'll call that
[00:07:31] that would end up being what
[00:07:34] normally
[00:07:37] 31 51 so we'll call that well we'll say
[00:07:40] that's 49 we we'll take a couple bucks
[00:07:42] off on that on each of those there let's
[00:07:45] see if you guys want to go with that
[00:07:46] there you go there and the book gets
[00:07:48] better as it goes because every single
[00:07:50] one of the floors that gets hit every
[00:07:52] time the plaque gets pull a car gets
[00:07:54] pulled out of here you replace it with a
[00:07:56] murders at Carl Manor because it ends up
[00:07:58] being a blank spot and that becomes a
[00:07:59] collector booster that gets replaced
[00:08:01] there but right now what we're doing is
[00:08:03] you get yourself a lost Cav exine
[00:08:04] collector booster and a p a spin of the
[00:08:08] big blue book here all right
[00:08:11] $49 and all the cars in there we're
[00:08:13] starting that off we'll see what happens
[00:08:15] there high card of that is currently you
[00:08:18] are still with a balin's
[00:08:20] tomb no one hit our balin's tomb yet all
[00:08:24] right we still have our Balin tomb in
[00:08:26] there but we decided to add some more
[00:08:27] fun into this we added a
[00:08:29] uh Temple
[00:08:31] Garden we added in Aela we added in a
[00:08:35] Lord of the Rings collector booster
[00:08:37] that's a nice one so we added some fun
[00:08:40] stuff into here all right but what I'll
[00:08:43] do now is we'll keep going through this
[00:08:44] and giving you some options of different
[00:08:46] packs with the big blue book here and
[00:08:50] see if you guys want anything like that
[00:08:51] we're going to do this here we'll do a
[00:08:54] uh we'll do a murders our Carlo and
[00:08:57] we'll guarantee you Murders At Carlo
[00:08:58] right now
[00:08:59] let's start it out that way and see if
[00:09:02] you guys want to do that and see if you
[00:09:03] get some luck and then we can see uh if
[00:09:05] will or Nolan can pick out the pack that
[00:09:08] gets you the uh secret ink on it the
[00:09:11] invisible ink on it I mean I keep
[00:09:13] calling it secret ink invisible ink on
[00:09:15] it we'll call
[00:09:18] this that's what we're gonna do we're g
[00:09:21] to call
[00:09:27] that let's see if you want still
[00:09:29] confused on how the book works all right
[00:09:32] so the book you have 81 Spots I'm sorry
[00:09:36] 81 spots are in this book all right when
[00:09:39] you are in the book um you have a spin
[00:09:41] at the wheel at the top left there uh
[00:09:43] top right you can kind of see that wheel
[00:09:44] up there that is the wheel that is used
[00:09:47] I'm I'll pull the randomizer out a
[00:09:48] little bit so you can see it a little
[00:09:49] bit better this is the wheel that gets
[00:09:51] spin spun there's 81 one through 81 okay
[00:09:54] numbers one through 81 on there once
[00:09:56] that is
[00:09:58] spun
[00:09:59] you get yourself a chance
[00:10:03] at the what is in here all right get
[00:10:07] yourself a chance of what isn't here and
[00:10:08] any of these packs that are in cards
[00:10:10] that are in here you're going to get
[00:10:11] whatever's on the number okay and say
[00:10:13] for instance though you get one that is
[00:10:15] under $10 one of the nine to 10 to um $
[00:10:18] five cards you're going to end up
[00:10:19] getting yourself a pack
[00:10:23] of any of these four
[00:10:26] packs also you get a choice of any of
[00:10:28] these four packs also if it's under $10
[00:10:31] all right if the card is under four uh
[00:10:36] $5 you get a choice of any two of these
[00:10:39] packs or a collector booster of Dungeons
[00:10:45] and Dragons or a mystery booster and
[00:10:47] that's what you get as your kind of
[00:10:49] extra to make sure you get your kind of
[00:10:51] no lose if you happen to get a car that
[00:10:53] is not worth over the kind of $20 value
[00:10:56] there for where the floor is and these
[00:10:58] are the cars that are in here we'll
[00:10:59] scroll through that but we had the book
[00:11:01] going we did have somebody that jumped
[00:11:02] on it here randad so what I'm going to
[00:11:05] do is I'm going to spin this and we'll
[00:11:06] show you how this goes all right because
[00:11:08] he he likes the idea of this all right
[00:11:10] we're gonna do this and we're gonna pull
[00:11:11] this over now
[00:11:13] randad do you want me to make this go
[00:11:18] anytime the shuffle of the entries or
[00:11:20] you want me to leave it the way it
[00:11:23] is because we can Shuffle those entries
[00:11:25] for you all right Shuffle it three times
[00:11:28] all right one
[00:11:29] two and three all right we shuffled that
[00:11:32] three times we're going to spin that
[00:11:34] wheel and we are going to see where that
[00:11:36] lands
[00:11:37] us that lands us on number 34 so you
[00:11:41] have a Pack here because that's what was
[00:11:42] the deal there but you get one pack of
[00:11:44] that plus what is in number 34 also so
[00:11:47] let's go through here and we see our
[00:11:49] cards here hold SL uh quiet for one
[00:11:52] second will thank you we're going to get
[00:11:55] to our number 34 I just skipped over

[00:12:01] 27 there we have 34 all right number 34
[00:12:05] is city of death all right so that is a
[00:12:07] $10 card being a $10 card you hit one so

[00:12:15] get your city of death
[00:12:17] and an option of any one of these packs
[00:12:21] of cards also because it is $10 and less
[00:12:25] is a $10 and less card that is why you
[00:12:28] get that so which one do you want to go
[00:12:29] with there because you also get your
[00:12:31] city of death card
[00:12:34] and one of these packs and let me put

[00:12:58] that we'll put that back there I'm going

[00:14:46] Panther nice demand answers uh showcase

[00:14:59] croward hunch I haven't actually seen
[00:15:02] that one
[00:15:03] yet audience with
[00:15:06] trosani nice I think that's a nice
[00:15:08] little hit there I think that used to be
[00:15:10] like a $20 hit oh ni miss it Guild
[00:15:13] pack that's the first ni isit Guild pack
[00:15:16] I've seen period pulled out of here and
[00:15:19] that's a foil nice foil on that PLS and
[00:15:22] then your nice one
[00:15:26] dude the last two sets this year
[00:15:29] nice those are the last two sets this
[00:15:31] year have been not bad I like I actually
[00:15:33] wasn't too I was was not overly excited
[00:15:35] about Ravnica but I ended up liking it a
[00:15:37] lot with the animes that they put in
[00:15:38] there and uh this has been kind of fun
[00:15:40] to open so far I haven't had a ton of
[00:15:42] time a ton of them that be able to go
[00:15:43] through yet but so far we've been having
[00:15:45] some kind of cool CS that come out but
[00:15:47] there you go we got that out of those
[00:15:49] suit and let me do this here because we
[00:15:50] like to put it in we do it like that if
[00:15:52] you want me to I can put it in single
[00:15:54] ones but I do it like that because
[00:15:56] during um shipping it helps keep the
[00:15:57] package stiffer I mean the card stiffer
[00:15:59] so they don't like Bend in the top
[00:16:01] loaders but if I remember right top uh
[00:16:04] trani used to be like 20
[00:16:06] bucks all right nice hit there sweet and

[00:20:24] randad just pulled out one of the ones

[00:20:28] card was pulled out he ended up getting
[00:20:29] a free pack an extra pack on top of it
[00:20:31] because you always get an extra pack
[00:20:32] when you pull one of those out but when
[00:20:33] you get that pulled out that means that
[00:20:35] spot is blank now and that Blank Spot
[00:20:38] becomes a Murders At carlaw of Manor
[00:20:40] collector booster and that's why as the
[00:20:43] day goes on in this big blue book gets
[00:20:45] run the better it gets there go
[00:20:49] randash so here you want to try that we
[00:20:52] did that no one wanted those we'll put
[00:20:54] that back and let's do another collector
[00:20:56] booster with this
[00:20:59] you know what I like ioria I'm a big fan
[00:21:02] of ioria we're GNA do that all right
[00:21:05] with our big blue book right now that's
[00:21:08] what we're gonna do let's angle this
[00:21:10] down a little bit so we can see it
[00:21:13] better let's angle that down a little
[00:21:15] bit so we can see a little bit better
[00:21:17] there we go that's we're gonna do we're
[00:21:18] gonna do that that's going to be our
[00:21:21] pack deal right now a little bit of a
[00:21:22] deal for that and let's see if you guys
[00:21:24] want to try this
[00:21:26] out hey moner thank you for coming in
[00:21:28] hey cake eater how you doing Joey we
[00:21:31] appreciate it so we're going to call
[00:21:35] this that's what we're going to call
[00:21:37] that all right get yourself pack ioria
[00:21:41] and you get yourself a spin of the big
[00:21:42] blue book and remember in that big blue
[00:21:44] book this is everything that's in
[00:21:46] there all right you have all these cards
[00:21:50] in there maybe you want to force a
[00:21:51] negation maybe you're looking for like
[00:21:53] and everybody lives but remember if you
[00:21:54] get anything is that is under
[00:21:57] $10 you get
[00:21:59] yourself one of
[00:22:03] these four packs of
[00:22:06] cards all right then if you happen to
[00:22:09] get one that's under $5 you get two of
[00:22:11] those four packs of cards or a mystery
[00:22:13] booster or a Dungeons and
[00:22:15] Dragons now every blank spot that is in
[00:22:18] there that gets pulled that's why the
[00:22:20] book gets better because every time
[00:22:22] something's pulled out of here all right
[00:22:24] guys every time something's pulled out
[00:22:26] of there it becomes a blank spot that
[00:22:28] Blank Spot becomes a Murders At Carlo
[00:22:31] Manor collector booster so the more this
[00:22:34] is fun the more this book
[00:22:37] goes the more your chances are of
[00:22:40] getting collector boosters out of this
[00:22:42] book there's only 81 spots so I'm not
[00:22:45] going to keep running this thing forever
[00:22:46] we can only do 81 of
[00:22:48] them but that was our deal right there
[00:22:50] we had a ioria we did not want that
[00:22:54] ioria that's all right we'll put that
[00:22:55] back there's also an
[00:22:58] lost uh Lord of the Rings collector
[00:23:01] booster in the
[00:23:06] book
[00:23:07] um yes no get uh turn the other light on
[00:23:11] over there and you can go over that way
[00:23:17] okay
[00:23:18] William turn the light on over there no
[00:23:20] the light on is over there buddy trying
[00:23:22] to tell you he walked all the way over
[00:23:25] to like turn the switch on the light
[00:23:26] rather than that switch where it's
[00:23:27] connected two on the wall yeah whatever
[00:23:30] hey guys all right we're going to run
[00:23:32] this we're going to do this for our pack
[00:23:34] de again we're going to do guarantee
[00:23:35] yourselves a murderers here we're gonna
[00:23:38] do that we're g to call
[00:23:42] this there we go you get your Murders At
[00:23:44] Carlo and a a spin of that book book
[00:23:47] there the way that book goes is we have
[00:23:51] our
[00:23:52] randomizer that goes up on the screen
[00:23:55] I'm G to put that in the corner so you
[00:23:57] guys can kind of see
[00:24:03] it all right that's not staying there
[00:24:06] all right put that randomizer so you
[00:24:08] kind of see it that randomizer gets
[00:24:11] spun and you land on a number and
[00:24:13] whatever number that is is the card that
[00:24:14] you get whenever you get that card you
[00:24:16] also so you get it the rise of alrai
[00:24:18] since it is $10 and less you get your
[00:24:20] choice of one of
[00:24:23] these four packs of card along with your
[00:24:26] card now you happen to say you happen to
[00:24:28] get one that is $5 and less you get two
[00:24:30] of these any of these four so you can
[00:24:34] make two of each one kind spread it out
[00:24:37] or you get yourself a collector booster
[00:24:40] of Dungeons and Dragons or a mystery
[00:24:43] booster your choice whatever you want to
[00:24:44] go with all right so with that big blue

[00:24:51] there really the invisible ink doesn't
[00:24:54] even work under a black light that is
[00:24:56] pretty funny I have to admit that's
[00:24:59] that's rather

[00:45:43] minutes not long not a long show today
[00:45:46] just a little quick pop up to see what's
[00:45:47] going on if anybody wanted to try their
[00:45:49] luck on this uh new wheel here but well
[00:45:52] I don't know doesn't look like today is
[00:45:54] uh the day here for us because I think I
[00:45:58] guess I I guess everybody's looking for
[00:45:59] for giveaways on Sundays and we don't
[00:46:01] really do giveaways because we just
[00:46:03] really give everybody the best deal
[00:46:04] possible as we can give on a regular
[00:46:07] basis so that's why but anyways we'll do
[00:46:11] this let's
[00:46:13] try a pack deal
[00:46:18] here try a pack deal here we're going to
[00:46:20] do it with the big blue book again here
[00:46:22] get your luck with that all right
[00:46:27] then this
[00:46:30] time why
[00:46:32] not let's put a l of the Rings in
[00:46:37] it why not put a l of the Rings there
[00:46:40] who
[00:46:43] cares one stay let's see if anybody
[00:46:47] wants this no one's in here anyways
[00:46:48] hanging out trying to sobody as well
[00:46:50] throw crazy stuff on there for the
[00:46:51] people that may bump in and
[00:46:53] out wait I see only one person bumping
[00:46:56] it oh no maybe not I don't know it's a
[00:46:57] hard to tell sometimes because it's
[00:46:59] glitching on the names my chat
[00:47:01] disappears so it's like one of those
[00:47:03] things where my chat disappears I don't
[00:47:04] know if anyone's here hanging
[00:47:06] out
[00:47:08] hey what is that
[00:47:12] aen oh I
[00:47:15] see AZN hey.com how you doing coming in
[00:47:18] hanging
[00:47:23] out we're just going to hang out here
[00:47:24] for a little while on
[00:47:30] here Walk Tall thank you coming in and
[00:47:32] hanging out looks like everybody's just
[00:47:35] really bumping in for like one second
[00:47:37] and then they leave because I'm guessing
[00:47:39] they're looking for um giveaways
[00:47:43] today and every time I see a show that's
[00:47:46] always where people are have anybody in
[00:47:47] there it's like continuous giveaways
[00:47:49] going on which kind of stinks that
[00:47:51] that's the only way that thing that
[00:47:52] people do it's weird but that's all
[00:47:55] right right I really don't care cuz I'm
[00:47:58] not that type of thing here we're not
[00:48:00] that type of show we're not that type of
[00:48:04] show we don't do that we just give you
[00:48:07] deals on what we can the best deals we
[00:48:09] can give you that's what we're here for
[00:48:12] that is what we're here for I don't do
[00:48:14] giveaways because of that reason I feel
[00:48:16] like it's a little bit of a uh cough out
[00:48:19] for trying to get something if you're
[00:48:21] only always doing that rather than
[00:48:23] actually setting it up right because
[00:48:24] you're charging everybody more than you
[00:48:26] need to so you can compensate for the
[00:48:28] giveaway it seems weird to me to do that
[00:48:31] and people like that though people like
[00:48:32] it that's okay people like it because
[00:48:34] they get their opportunity to go
[00:48:36] in that's why I like to give you a
[00:48:38] better deals then instead right now M at
[00:48:41] Carlo you get yourself a collector
[00:48:42] booster that and you get yourself one of
[00:48:44] the big blue
[00:48:45] book spins
[00:48:47] there they 81 spots each one of the
[00:48:50] spots $222 uh uh $22 each 2,2 $222 worth
[00:48:56] the stuff in there it's weird how I
[00:48:58] added up actually and it ended up being
[00:49:00] that amount I didn't intentionally do it
[00:49:02] it's more it ended up being added that
[00:49:04] way because all the cards are scanned in
[00:49:05] using um um Mana box so it has the the
[00:49:10] cost of the um has the cost of the Box
[00:49:13] on it and then then I added in like the
[00:49:16] packs that I could it added in there and
[00:49:18] it ended up somehow being $222 which is
[00:49:21] really weird just one of those like
[00:49:23] weird
[00:49:24] coincidences
[00:49:26] but hey that's all right we'll put that
[00:49:29] back and then I think I'll throw on
[00:49:31] another pack deal for if anybody would
[00:49:33] like that for a
[00:49:48] minute not going to do
[00:49:54] that
[00:50:06] it's got some mystery into our
[00:50:24] murders
[00:50:28] there you go there collector booster of
[00:50:30] murders of Carlo and a two mystery
[00:50:34] boosters here not bad for that
[00:50:38] deal actually really good for that deal
[00:50:40] but that's okay so you guys want it let
[00:50:42] me know we'll hang we're just kind of
[00:50:44] hanging out here kids are playing with
[00:50:45] Legos mom's actually doing some stuff
[00:50:47] with we with Legos
[00:50:51] too mom's playing with Legos and the
[00:50:53] kids are doing puzzle I guess
[00:50:56] y a little bit hey Mike how you
[00:51:01] doing did this not
[00:51:03] go three packs not
[00:51:07] go hey how you doing good not bad how
[00:51:09] are
[00:51:13] you just uh hanging out here with the
[00:51:16] family not really doing too too much
[00:51:19] just uh it's all we're really doing
[00:51:21] hanging out with the kids
[00:51:23] here give you a deal here on some of
[00:51:25] this if you want a couple of mysteries
[00:51:27] and some murders maybe try your luck
[00:51:29] there some pack
[00:51:31] deals yeah the kids are um doing a
[00:51:34] puzzle here and Mom is doing something
[00:51:38] with Legos they're trying to organize a
[00:51:41] Legos I think she wants to be able to
[00:51:42] use the Legos with bricket with the kids
[00:51:44] and she's picking up I'm the only one
[00:51:46] that made things oh she's the only one
[00:51:47] that made something can we put the fan
[00:51:48] on it's a little warm in
[00:51:51] here I but that's our pack deal right
[00:51:54] now if you want it
[00:51:56] just hang out with the family maybe rip
[00:51:58] some packs with you guys if you can if
[00:51:59] you want see the thing is here we like
[00:52:02] to do that with the kids because they
[00:52:03] always have like good luck if they pick
[00:52:04] some things out for you so we want to
[00:52:06] see if they get some good luck for
[00:52:07] you all right the binder all right the
[00:52:12] binder okay here's how the binder
[00:52:16] works I'm GNA pin it for you so you can
[00:52:18] see it a little bit too because I do
[00:52:20] have it in the uh the notes of the
[00:52:23] binder here so the binder in itself is
[00:52:27] 81 spots it's always going to be 81
[00:52:30] spots and the way that it works that it
[00:52:32] gets better is the ceiling is 90 which
[00:52:34] is a balin's tomb in there the floors
[00:52:36] are cards between 11 and $20 the average
[00:52:40] of the cards in there or whatever's in
[00:52:42] here is around $27 out of those floors
[00:52:44] there's 19
[00:52:48] floors2 on the cards and of them are
[00:52:50] between 11 and $14 so I kind of Mark off
[00:52:53] each one of the floors when a floor is
[00:52:54] pulled
[00:52:55] all right so what happens though is you
[00:52:58] either get one of the cards that are
[00:53:00] spun from the wheel you can see up in
[00:53:01] the corner there all right so maybe you
[00:53:03] get yourself number seven you get a
[00:53:05] force a negation but maybe you get a
[00:53:08] number nine a rise of alrazy that's only
[00:53:10] $10 anything that is between 1010 and5
[00:53:13] you actually get yourself a pack
[00:53:17] of any of these one of these three uh
[00:53:20] four packs if you want it then say you
[00:53:22] happen to be one that gets a maybe you
[00:53:24] get a treat beard which it's under five
[00:53:26] bucks you're actually get one of two of
[00:53:29] these packs or you get a mystery booster
[00:53:32] or you get a collector booster of
[00:53:34] dungeons dragons now as the book gets
[00:53:37] goes on and the day goes on and more
[00:53:39] things spins are done in the book with
[00:53:41] these spots since there's only 81
[00:53:43] eventually you're going to get to a
[00:53:44] point where you're looking at these and
[00:53:46] you're going oh you know those are nice
[00:53:47] sweet cards but oh we got blank spots
[00:53:49] now those blank spots are now Ms at
[00:53:53] Carlo Manor collector boo boosters every
[00:53:56] time you hit a blank spot it's because
[00:53:58] of murders at Carl L man a collector
[00:53:59] booster pack so pretty much as this game
[00:54:03] goes
[00:54:04] on the odds for collector booster pack
[00:54:07] get higher and higher and higher of
[00:54:09] murders at Carlo and then your as your
[00:54:12] cards go away and you're always getting
[00:54:16] good cards as you're pulling it out or
[00:54:17] PS so I don't know I thought it was a
[00:54:19] pretty cool idea that way you can see
[00:54:22] everything that's in it you spin the
[00:54:24] wheel kind of see where it goes maybe
[00:54:26] you know some people want a steam vents
[00:54:28] maybe you want a bailin tum maybe you're
[00:54:30] looking for a watery grave uh foil retro
[00:54:33] like a tsh's tide Bender foil is what a
[00:54:35] floor is you know so that's what that is
[00:54:39] there you got 81 spots pretty much I
[00:54:42] filled up Pages all the way up to like I
[00:54:44] think it was what five pages here so I
[00:54:46] filled all those up and that's
[00:54:48] everything that's in there we spin the
[00:54:50] wheel you see where you land and if you
[00:54:53] happen to land on something uh one of
[00:54:56] those spots you just really it's just
[00:54:57] what you get in the spot is what's there
[00:54:59] so that's so you either get a card you
[00:55:01] get a pack or you get a oh a card and
[00:55:05] packs yeah so you get and I don't know
[00:55:09] how this added up that way this quite
[00:55:11] frankly was a little weird because I I
[00:55:13] have um I have all the cards in here
[00:55:15] that are scanned in through Mon monox
[00:55:18] and then I took all those added that
[00:55:21] price together of what the monobox said
[00:55:22] the cost of everything in there was then
[00:55:24] I add added it to I added the cost of
[00:55:26] like all the packs that you could have
[00:55:27] added in here based on how many cards
[00:55:29] were in there at the certain levels and
[00:55:31] it ended up coming literally out to that
[00:55:32] amount I did not do that I didn't do it
[00:55:34] on purpose I was literally I typing in
[00:55:37] all the numbers and it came out that way
[00:55:39] and I looked at my wife and go hey
[00:55:40] that's crazy isn't it jelle that was
[00:55:42] pretty nuts but that's our uh that's why
[00:55:45] the book keeps getting bigger and bigger
[00:55:47] and better because every time there's a
[00:55:49] spot that's pulled out in a blank spot
[00:55:51] you end up getting a murdered at Carlo
[00:55:52] man or collector booster which means
[00:55:54] every spot ends up getting better every
[00:55:57] time yeah I know I was like I was like
[00:55:58] no way I know exactly crazy odds the
[00:56:01] odds are really good you only have I
[00:56:03] know the odds are really good too you
[00:56:04] only have 19 floors and like I was
[00:56:07] saying those floors one of those floors
[00:56:09] is a uh well I think it's a blood Crypt
[00:56:12] is one of those
[00:56:14] floors yeah an Overgrown Tomb is a floor
[00:56:17] there all right that's an a a floor in
[00:56:20] this game know a tash's tide binner is a
[00:56:23] floor in this game
[00:56:27] a watery grave retro is a floor in this
[00:56:31] game so that's why I thought it was
[00:56:33] pretty
[00:56:34] fun pretty it's pretty hard to lose the
[00:56:37] odds are very good yes the odds are very
[00:56:39] good and like I said as things get
[00:56:41] pulled the odds even get better and
[00:56:43] that's what makes it kind of a fun game
[00:56:45] there is the odds get better as it gets
[00:56:49] pulled all right Mike Mike likes it here
[00:56:53] we go
[00:56:55] now we're going to spin it Mike we're
[00:56:57] going to pull that wheel
[00:56:58] out we're going to spin that book and
[00:57:01] we're going to see what

[00:57:22] dancing we can Shuffle the entries as
[00:57:25] many times you like before you spin it
[00:57:28] too my I didn't freeze or anything I
[00:57:30] think I'm
[00:57:31] good so let me know n j go all right run
[00:57:34] the
[00:57:35] spinner here we
[00:57:38] go 78 all right spot number 78 let's see

[01:02:12] odds get better of getting collector
[01:02:14] boosters out of here so that's why I was
[01:02:16] saying as we spin your odds get better
[01:02:18] this is a pretty sweet deal here for you
[01:02:20] guys I know Freddy exactly so that's why
[01:02:22] I like doing this here all right so this
[01:02:24] this is what we do for some of these
[01:02:25] deals we're going to start off here
[01:02:27] we're going to do it like this we're
[01:02:28] going to guarantee you a Murders At
[01:02:29] Carlo Manor right now all right let's
[01:02:31] guarantee you C Murders At Carlo Manor
[01:02:34] and let's do it with this too all right
[01:02:36] let's do this we're going to guarantee
[01:02:37] you murders at Carl Manor and because
[01:02:39] you're going to be getting a couple of
[01:02:40] them at the same time because we're GNA
[01:02:42] do a big blue book at the same time
[01:02:44] whenever we do a couple things at once
[01:02:45] it saves my me on whatnot fees because
[01:02:48] it saves me on whatnot fees I pass that
[01:02:50] savings on to you guys so I take a
[01:02:52] couple bucks off of things because I
[01:02:55] don't I do my best if I I figure if I'm
[01:02:56] GNA have what if I if I shouldn't make
[01:02:59] out by selling it on the extra one
[01:03:03] whatnot piece you know what I mean so I
[01:03:05] figured give that deal to you guys and
[01:03:07] here you go you get yourself spin from
[01:03:08] the Big Blue Book
[01:03:10] there oh I got to put the uh wheel up in
[01:03:12] the corner there let me show the
[01:03:15] randomizer and I got to put that up
[01:03:17] there we go let me put the randomizer up
[01:03:20] there there we go so you see that and
[01:03:22] that is a really good deal there guys
[01:03:24] Big Blue Book there sweet deal what I'm
[01:03:26] going to do one more time I'm G to do
[01:03:28] one more Big Blue Book uh deal with
[01:03:32] a pack of card here we're gonna see what
[01:03:35] happens all right we're gonna do we're
[01:03:38] gonna do it with ion because you know
[01:03:40] what this took me a while to find ion
[01:03:42] recently and I don't know why anybody
[01:03:46] seems to think that they could sell
[01:03:47] those boxes for $300 now that seems
[01:03:50] pretty crazy to me which is what I seen
[01:03:52] him bumped up to that's insane that they
[01:03:54] bumped them up that high like I don't
[01:03:56] understand who's going to try to buy
[01:03:59] that out a $300 there that just seems
[01:04:01] crazy to me but anyways we're GNA put
[01:04:03] this
[01:04:04] on you get yourself a collector booster
[01:04:07] of Exelon plus you get yourself a spin
[01:04:09] of that wheel from the Big Blue Book
[01:04:12] there all of you that have been looking
[01:04:14] in there you see everything in there
[01:04:15] that's why we
[01:04:16] have H A marking spot here floors hit
[01:04:19] currently 19 of the floors are available
[01:04:21] but it's any c that is between $15 and
[01:04:22] $20 there's only n of those there's only
[01:04:25] 10 cards that are between 11 and $14 on
[01:04:27] those fours of that 22 spot $22 per spot
[01:04:32] and there's 81 spots in here so what
[01:04:34] we're doing right now is a collector
[01:04:37] booster and a spin on that Big Blue
[01:04:41] Book wheel air kind of a cool thing and
[01:04:44] every single time something gets pulled
[01:04:46] out that Blank Spot gets replaced with a
[01:04:49] Murders At Carlo Manor so we've had two
[01:04:51] spins so far so there are now two
[01:04:53] Murders At car man are collector
[01:04:55] boosters in there and every single time
[01:04:57] we do more spins and more SPS polls
[01:04:59] better odds for getting a collector
[01:05:01] booster of murders of Carlo Manor
[01:05:03] Murders At Carlo Manor I thought it was
[01:05:04] a pretty cool deal there so let's do uh

[01:09:10] the last box that we had and we've only
[01:09:13] got and we were now into this one and we
[01:09:14] have not had any pulled out of this one
[01:09:16] yet let's see if we can get some luck

[01:09:22] five six seven and eight we're going to
[01:09:25] move the spoilers to the back because we
[01:09:26] don't like the spoilers in the beginning
[01:09:27] Doo knows that you know one of the
[01:09:30] coolest things I think they did recently
[01:09:31] is they took the art
[01:09:33] cards and they put the tokens on the
[01:09:35] other side of them that is the coolest
[01:09:37] thing they've ever done in years I think
[01:09:41] oh yeah I'm like I've been saying for
[01:09:43] years they needed to do that and when
[01:09:44] they did it I'm like oh that's awesome

[01:10:34] this is not one of the
[01:10:36] invisible wait is
[01:10:38] it no it's just got weird
[01:10:43] lines it's got weird lines down the
[01:10:46] whole thing if anybody can see that
[01:10:47] though like there's one two three four
[01:10:51] five lines it's almost like down the
[01:10:54] entire card it's almost like invisible
[01:10:57] ink got spread down the entire card by
[01:10:59] accident does anybody see
[01:11:03] that where like the lines one two three
[01:11:06] four five lines right there I can't
[01:11:09] see move I don't know if anybody can see
[01:11:12] those when I'm moving it there's five
[01:11:14] lines there I see three yeah there's
[01:11:18] five lines on that weirdly and it
[01:11:20] doesn't it's not like in an invisible
[01:11:22] ink specific draw like the other ones
[01:11:24] it's just lines down the entire thing I
[01:11:27] wonder if that's a a misprint there yeah
[01:11:30] dude that's what I was thinking go you
[01:11:32] got an invisible ink misprint maybe I
[01:11:35] don't know that's really weird looking
[01:11:37] though I've NE I have not seen that on
[01:11:38] any card
[01:11:40] before yeah that's what I'm guessing
[01:11:42] it's some kind of printing issue like
[01:11:44] the it's either a printing issue or
[01:11:47] maybe like the invisible ink kind of
[01:11:49] kind of got put on it and didn't fully
[01:11:51] get put on it but that was cool
[01:11:54] nice middle misprint there misprint on

[01:12:02] interrogation and an Argus on
[01:12:05] that dude that was pretty cool you got
[01:12:08] yourself I think that's a misprint there

[01:12:11] misprint I'd consider that a misprint

[01:17:50] guys maybe somebody wants to go out that
[01:17:52] Big Blue Book there are now two spots
[01:17:54] that are collector boosters since
[01:17:55] there's been two of them pulled so
[01:17:59] [Music]
[01:18:08] far
[01:18:10] Deo get your name written down
[01:18:13] there so the book all right I will
[01:18:16] explain the book the book is really fun
[01:18:18] actually so the book is 81 spots are in
[01:18:21] the book and I'll show you this in a
[01:18:22] second here just get this uh in here
[01:18:25] that way I don't misake anything there
[01:18:27] are 81 spots in the book the book is
[01:18:29] actually in the notes too if you want to
[01:18:30] take a look at what the notes say let do
[01:18:32] that there there are 81 spots in this
[01:18:36] book normally at $22 per spot but when I
[01:18:39] do deals together we take a couple bucks
[01:18:41] off to help out with that because you
[01:18:42] guys are helping me out doing a thing at
[01:18:44] a time but what it is there are the
[01:18:46] ceiling is $90 the floors are in cards
[01:18:48] that are between 11 and $20 the average
[01:18:51] of everything in here is about $27 when
[01:18:53] you put it all together now the book is
[01:18:55] everything in this book is worth $222 I
[01:18:58] don't know how that added up I can run a
[01:19:01] book with a Lord of the Rings holiday I
[01:19:03] have one Lord of the Rings holiday left
[01:19:05] I can do that I'll do that I literally
[01:19:07] have one Lord of the Rings holiday left
[01:19:09] so we'll do that and there are
[01:19:11] nine um spots uh that there are nine
[01:19:15] spots that have floors between $15 and
[01:19:18] $20 and there are 10 spots that have
[01:19:19] floors between 11 and $14 so there's
[01:19:22] only n 19 floors there all right so what
[01:19:25] happens
[01:19:29] is hold on one second let me just put
[01:19:31] this up here what happens is is we spin
[01:19:34] the wheel up in the corner that you can
[01:19:35] see and whatever number you happen to
[01:19:37] land on is the number you get so maybe
[01:19:40] you get a force of negation walk away
[01:19:41] with a cool card but maybe you land on
[01:19:43] like Aon Soldier where it's under $10
[01:19:46] well when it's under $10 you get a pick
[01:19:49] of any of these four packs ma a card to
[01:19:53] go with that card that gets pulled out
[01:19:56] under $10 now say for whatever reason
[01:19:58] you pull out get a number five here and
[01:20:00] you get one that's under $5 well you can
[01:20:02] get any two of those four cards or a
[01:20:05] dungeon dragons forgotten RS collector
[01:20:07] booster or a mystery booster convention
[01:20:10] card pack and what we do is we spin that
[01:20:12] wheel and we go through this and I'm
[01:20:14] going to do that now since Mike jumped
[01:20:16] in on that because he's going to go
[01:20:17] after he's hting that Lord of the Rings
[01:20:19] collector booster my last one there so I
[01:20:21] got to go in adjust my buy now just

[01:20:31] get rid of that we are now at zero
[01:20:33] because I'm out of those all right here
[01:20:36] we go and now we're gonna spin this
[01:20:39] wheel no did you really I didn't even
[01:20:43] notice that dude I didn't even notice
[01:20:46] that you did that you want me to refund

[01:21:13] spin let's spin let get you
[01:21:16] good all right we're going to pull this
[01:21:19] randomizer out in the middle all right
[01:21:22] and we want to spin it or you want to
[01:21:23] shuffle any of the entries
[01:21:28] first all right no Shuffle here we
[01:21:31] go we're going to run that spinner and
[01:21:34] let's see the number you land
[01:21:36] on 65 number 65 all right so we're going
[01:21:41] through the book here where these are
[01:21:42] all the cards that are in here something
[01:21:44] cool you could get out of
[01:21:46] these for number empty spot equals a

[01:21:58] go you got yourself a muddle the mixture

[01:22:03] is how we do this here because you got
[01:22:04] one of the lower ones you get yourself
[01:22:08] this card but you always get either two
[01:22:11] packs of
[01:22:14] this any of these two packs or a mystery
[01:22:18] booster but because that is a $1 card I
[01:22:22] will give give you a mystery booster
[01:22:23] plus any one of these if you want also
[01:22:26] when it's a $1 card I do feel a little
[01:22:29] bit bad so I try to give a little extra
[01:22:31] if you want so you can do a mystery
[01:22:32] booster and one of these or any two of
[01:22:35] these if you would like

[02:05:56] combination of maybe you want uh maybe
[02:05:59] you want to guarantee yourself a Murders
[02:06:01] At Carlo Manor maybe that's one you do
[02:06:03] you want to guarantee yourselves that

[02:06:08] and a spin of the wheel there let's do
[02:06:11] that let's guarantee you a murders of
[02:06:12] Carla Manner and let's get you that spin
[02:06:14] of that wheel we'll do that for this
[02:06:16] because every time you buy multiple
[02:06:20] things it helps me save whatnot fees so
[02:06:23] I pass that savings on to you so there
[02:06:25] you go a collector at murders and one
[02:06:29] spin of the big blue book
[02:06:31] here see uh $2,200 worth of stuff and
[02:06:34] that was like a happy coincidence by the
[02:06:36] way so I have uh I use Mana U Mona box
[02:06:40] to scan all the cards that are in here
[02:06:42] then you put the price of the cards in
[02:06:43] the packs of cards in and it somehow
[02:06:45] came out to
[02:06:46] $222 $2,200 $22 I was like that is where
[02:06:50] was a happy coincidence there right but
[02:06:53] here you go guys as we got there jump in
[02:06:56] on this that is a really good deal and
[02:06:58] it's sudden death because I'm happy with
[02:06:59] it and if somebody else wants to jump in
[02:07:01] on it because they want more yeah that's
[02:07:02] your choice if you want to try and beat
[02:07:04] someone out but I'm good with what it is
[02:07:06] which is why I always do sudden death
[02:07:09] for the most part here all right guys
[02:07:12] that's what we had there we'll put that
[02:07:14] back since nobody went with it and I'm

[02:13:38] uh not too bad on that one the Ys
[02:13:41] anybody need any these let me
[02:13:43] know you can purchase them as I'm not

[02:13:50] investigate this ability triggers only

[02:14:04] though what would I run Nelly for let me
[02:14:07] check here
[02:14:09] Nelly I generally do
[02:14:11] them not too bad here
[02:14:16] Nelly right
[02:14:21] there put it on I think the price right
[02:14:23] now the medium price is what three the
[02:14:26] price market price is $3
[02:14:29] Now call it $2 if you want it we can put
[02:14:32] it on there
[02:14:34] for what do you think
[02:14:37] Freddy since you have it as a pre-con
[02:14:39] commander I'll make a deal for you if
[02:14:41] there's something else you want though
[02:14:42] that way you don't have to pay a ton for
[02:14:43] shipping that way if you want to add it
[02:14:45] into something else I'll put it together
[02:14:47] in like a deal for you just add kind of
[02:14:50] throw it in in a way since it's only two
[02:14:51] bucks if there's like a pack of cards
[02:14:53] you want if there's like a collector
[02:14:54] booster or something that you want I'll
[02:14:56] just throw it
[02:14:58] in you wa for now yeah no
[02:15:01] problem yeah like I said I don't mind if
[02:15:04] uh say you uh say you want to try your
[02:15:05] luck on your own collector booster of um
[02:15:07] Ms at Carlo and see what you get I'll
[02:15:10] just throw that in for you I'm okay with
[02:15:12] that because it's uh when you kind of
[02:15:13] like I said before if you do two things
[02:15:14] at once it helps me a little bit so by
[02:15:18] doing that it helps me to save on
[02:15:20] shipping stuff so I figure might as well
[02:15:22] you know that that type of thing can't
[02:15:24] afford boosters tonight all
[02:15:26] right yeah but if you want to do it
[02:15:29] separately though I have no problem
[02:15:30] doing that we can do
[02:15:35] that but not bad there let's see what
[02:15:39] anybody wants to try their luck on the
[02:15:40] Big Blue Book guys remember this is what
[02:15:43] the big blue book is here
[02:15:45] $2,222 worth of stuff in there 81 spots
[02:15:48] and that
[02:15:49] $2,222 goes up every time a spot is
[02:15:52] pulled because it becomes a blank spot
[02:15:54] and every Blank Spot becomes a merge at
[02:15:57] Carlo Manor collector booster so every
[02:16:00] single time something gets pulled out
[02:16:01] that Blank Spot that makes that book go
[02:16:04] higher yeah the art is pretty cool I do
[02:16:07] have the hot
[02:16:09] Transformers I actually was going to
[02:16:11] make a comment about that today House of
[02:16:14] Hoarders I actually have those do you
[02:16:17] want me to put those uh together for you
[02:16:19] I think it was like they were a dollar a
[02:16:20] piece or something like that I can't
[02:16:21] remember what they
[02:16:24] were yeah they were just a dollar piece
[02:16:26] so three3 there and um you already
[02:16:28] picked something else up so I can put
[02:16:30] those on there for you yeah try to I try
[02:16:33] to do like you said like I said if
[02:16:34] somebody buys something I don't like
[02:16:35] when some like one or two dollars the
[02:16:37] shipping is weird so I try to combine
[02:16:39] stuff together for people when I can so
[02:16:41] let's do that there I'll put that on for
[02:16:42] you how's the
[02:16:46] hoarders
[02:16:49] l s all
[02:16:54] right
[02:16:55] $3 now I'm not going to do sudden death
[02:16:58] like I said before in case somebody
[02:16:59] tries to sneak these three out from
[02:17:00] underneath you but these were the three
[02:17:03] Transformers that you looked at Gold bug
[02:17:07] Ultram Mangus and a
[02:17:10] prow there you go
[02:17:13] there like I said I tried to do it so I
[02:17:15] put it on for 10 seconds there for you
[02:17:19] house do you want oh did you miss that
[02:17:22] I'll run that again if you
[02:17:23] [Music]
[02:17:27] need I can't do that that will get me in
[02:17:30] trouble they do um they do they do not
[02:17:33] allow that when it comes to um that type
[02:17:35] of thing sorry about that
[02:17:39] um yeah they don't allow that because
[02:17:41] that could get me in trouble here yeah
[02:17:43] you're supposed to be through a sale and
[02:17:45] that's how they get their fees and their
[02:17:46] stuff like that that that's why if they
[02:17:48] see me doing that I'll end up getting in
[02:17:50] trouble I I I uh I can't do
[02:17:56] that but let me do this
[02:17:58] here run that
[02:18:02] here oh it adds it to that much for
[02:18:04] shipping I didn't know that it adds it
[02:18:06] in for shipping oh um I thought I put it
[02:18:10] together because you got something
[02:18:11] already
[02:18:12] earlier that's weird here let me do this
[02:18:22] let me see if
[02:18:24] um hold on a
[02:18:32] second you do it this way I think if I
[02:18:35] drop it
[02:18:37] down here let me do that let me try does
[02:18:40] it say what does it say
[02:18:45] now yeah no I understand where you
[02:18:47] saying
[02:18:49] house
[02:18:52] um I mean uh let me see
[02:18:56] here all right that's what I was saying
[02:18:58] I just changed it
[02:19:00] quickly I don't know if it says that
[02:19:02] what it says now um there sometimes the
[02:19:04] shipping
[02:19:06] um it doesn't always pick up the right
[02:19:08] thing so I don't know if it adjusted any
[02:19:10] of that but yeah I'm sorry it doesn't
[02:19:13] let me it doesn't let you do tipping
[02:19:14] like that because it will get it kind of
[02:19:16] get us in trouble
[02:19:18] but so there I mean if you want that way
[02:19:22] the shipping was a lot more rerun yeah
[02:19:25] that way I just dropped it down that way
[02:19:26] just kind of we'll combine it with
[02:19:31] everything there you go there those
[02:19:32] three on
[02:19:34] screen
[02:19:40] what yeah I know I saw
[02:19:46] that there you go
[02:19:49] all right there you go and I'll put
[02:19:50] those
[02:19:51] in with your other cards right here
[02:19:56] house yeah I forgot um see when uh if
[02:20:01] you're GNA do like an individual card by
[02:20:02] itself it's like a little over an ounce
[02:20:05] when it comes to the shipping but if I'm
[02:20:07] doing it by themselves and you already
[02:20:09] have something together I can do it as
[02:20:10] less than an ounce because they are less
[02:20:12] than an ounce and they're going into
[02:20:14] another package so that's why I was like
[02:20:15] oh you got to get into another package
[02:20:17] we just do that and help out that so
[02:20:19] yeah just so you know that house of
[02:20:20] Hoarders for the future for yourself um
[02:20:23] if you turn it on so that it does the um
[02:20:26] the shipping allows you to do like the
[02:20:27] the cheaper version um it's in the
[02:20:29] settings it'll let you do a cheap
[02:20:31] version where it's kind of like sending
[02:20:32] a mail through an envelope but because
[02:20:34] it's only individual cars that are cheap
[02:20:36] cars it ends up only being like you know
[02:20:37] anywhere's less than a dollar or
[02:20:38] something like that somewhere around a
[02:20:40] dollar and that way if you're going to
[02:20:42] do something uh like I just did the
[02:20:44] shipping won't will be a lot less
[02:20:46] because you're kind of combined in
[02:20:47] everything into another order yeah so it
[02:20:50] kind of that ends up working out
[02:20:51] correctly if that makes
[02:20:53] sense little little something I figured

[02:21:15] there for a little while I'm going to
[02:21:17] put a pack deal on here and we're going
[02:21:19] to see if anybody is interested in the
[02:21:21] pack deal that I'm going to put up on
[02:21:22] here all right we did rip those open
[02:21:25] Don't wanted that necessarily but that's
[02:21:26] okay let's see the pack deal that we're
[02:21:28] looking
[02:21:33] for let's do something interesting right
[02:21:35] now let's do an
[02:21:39] ioria a boig boo book is knocking
[02:21:42] everything
[02:21:45] over and ioria
[02:21:48] a murders
[02:21:51] ioria
[02:21:52] ioria aoria and a mystery
[02:22:00] booster mystery
[02:22:06] booster this is what we're going to call
[02:22:14] that we're going to put those on screen
[02:22:16] for this if you want to try
[02:22:19] that there we go
[02:22:22] there three packs on
[02:22:24] screen mystery murders and an aoria lir
[02:22:30] of the behemoths go after some triome
[02:22:32] some invisible ink and a monoc
[02:22:38] crypt not a little not a bad deal
[02:22:41] there hey what's up baby getting some
[02:22:44] wine drinking in I have wine you can't
[02:22:46] haveu I'm I'm not allowed to have shots
[02:22:48] but my wife can drink wine that doesn't
[02:22:49] seem
[02:22:51] fair they don't want
[02:22:56] to all our pack yel coming
[02:23:03] up
[02:23:07] really generally uh it's
[02:23:15] whiskey oh
[02:23:17] hey wer how you doing yeah a little on
[02:23:19] at night the um we didn't really have
[02:23:21] much going on today so figured we hang
[02:23:23] out for a little bit tonight since uh
[02:23:26] swim meet and everything going
[02:23:30] on finish the swim meet
[02:23:36] yeah
[02:23:38] interesting you should have the option
[02:23:41] if you go into um your settings uh you
[02:23:45] should have an option of changing it to
[02:23:47] the pwe shipping I
[02:23:50] thought but it has to be the item
[02:23:52] between
[02:23:54] zero and three ounces is the only time
[02:23:56] that it will do that if I remember right
[02:23:58] and it has to be the amount of the item
[02:24:00] has to be under uh $20 being sold so
[02:24:05] there's like two things that have to be
[02:24:06] I think it's be under three ounces and
[02:24:08] under $20 is when you're able to do the
[02:24:10] pwe thing and it's going to be not as
[02:24:13] cheap but it will be
[02:24:15] cheaper not as cheap when R in the
[02:24:17] special but it will be cheaper all right
[02:24:19] we're going to do the big blue book here
[02:24:21] let's do some ion with it since we just
[02:24:23] got Exon in all right now the big blue
[02:24:25] book is even
[02:24:27] better yeah in the ship
[02:24:31] settings interesting in my sh
[02:24:34] um try on a computer or
[02:24:39] um on an iPhone or uh an iOS thing if
[02:24:44] you have one because I found out that
[02:24:46] iOS has features that Android doesn't
[02:24:49] have if that maybe is might be what
[02:24:50] you're running into
[02:24:55] here and we're going to call
[02:24:59] this G to do this
[02:25:07] here yeah for um I found multiple times
[02:25:11] iPhones like iPhones and Android uh
[02:25:13] Apple iOS you can do the wheel you can't
[02:25:15] do it on Android
[02:25:17] um like things like that get put out on
[02:25:20] iOS so I was wondering if U maybe it's
[02:25:22] not in the iOS for some reason it's only

[02:27:38] get in trouble
[02:27:40] now so I can't
[02:27:42] anymore my mom had a wooden paddle it
[02:27:45] wasn't a wooden paddle was a wooden
[02:27:47] spoon from the um from the kitchen all
[02:27:50] right so my mom had a wooden spoon from
[02:27:52] the kitchen that she came after me with
[02:27:54] when I was younger and you and I have I
[02:27:57] have respect all right I it's not I
[02:27:59] wasn't scared I was I respect her
[02:28:01] there's a difference I knew if I did
[02:28:03] something wrong there was a punishment
[02:28:06] coming to stir the Kool-Aid exactly
[02:28:09] teenage boys in showers oh even
[02:28:12] worse wooden for the cool always the
[02:28:14] wooden my wife knew exactly y the wooden
[02:28:16] spood for the cool Aid yep yep you know
[02:28:18] what it is yep my mom had one everybody
[02:28:21] had the what the cool Aid spoon yep you
[02:28:24] knew exactly what I'm talking about I
[02:28:25] broke three of those by the way I
[02:28:28] figured out when I was nine years old
[02:28:30] that if you run and you stand in the
[02:28:32] corner she'll swing and you can move
[02:28:34] quick and then she'll hit the corner of
[02:28:36] the wall and it'll break the spoon and
[02:28:38] you'll have at least a two or three days
[02:28:40] until you get a new
[02:28:41] [Laughter]
[02:28:45] spoon so I I found that out when I was
[02:28:48] younger you go in the corner and you
[02:28:50] move quick and then you run away that
[02:28:53] never ends up well but at least you
[02:28:55] don't get the spoon it's gonna hurt her
[02:28:57] if she's gonna smack you on her hand a
[02:28:58] little bit
[02:29:01] [Laughter]
[02:29:03] right I had I know I had a method I had
[02:29:06] a method growing up I was a smart
[02:29:10] kid hey rat house how you doing
[02:29:13] today eyeball we're going to throw on
[02:29:16] Big Blue Book here let's do that we're
[02:29:19] do a pack deal with our you know what
[02:29:21] let's just do this just the Big Blue
[02:29:24] Book just the big blue book here let's
[02:29:26] just run the big blue
[02:29:28] book that's not
[02:29:31] it run here we go there are 81
[02:29:36] spots three of them have been already
[02:29:38] pulled but that means those blank spots
[02:29:40] are collector boosters at of murders at
[02:29:43] Carlo Manor so that's why the Big Blue
[02:29:46] Book it's better as it goes you have 81
[02:29:49] spots $22 a spot $90 a ceiling which is
[02:29:52] a bailin tomb floors are between $1 and
[02:29:54] $2 and there's only 19 of those
[02:29:57] floors nine of them are between 15 and
[02:29:59] 20 11 10 of them are between 11 and 14
[02:30:03] the average of everything in here is
[02:30:04] about
[02:30:05] $27 maybe you're going after Force
[02:30:08] negation but maybe you come out and you
[02:30:10] hit the one there that is a uh you know
[02:30:12] the auton soldier there that's fine
[02:30:15] because it's under $10 you get yourself
[02:30:17] a choice of any of these four packs of
[02:30:19] cards I did refill to get the value back
[02:30:24] up and actually I adjusted it a little
[02:30:25] bit and added some more value to it that
[02:30:28] is correct so we are refilling and we're
[02:30:30] doing something a little different with
[02:30:31] it so one of the things that we're doing
[02:30:34] is now we got those then if you get
[02:30:36] anything under $ five okay guys if you
[02:30:38] get anything under five you get a two of
[02:30:44] these or you can get yourself one
[02:30:49] mystery in any of
[02:30:51] those or yourself one collector booster
[02:30:55] if it happens to be under $5 and that's
[02:30:57] what we got there and these are what we
[02:30:59] have for our cards in our box in our
[02:31:01] thing here I mean this is a really good
[02:31:03] deal yeah it's a really good deal it's
[02:31:05] hard to lose on because if you happen to
[02:31:07] get an Astron ODS alter you're still
[02:31:09] walking away with an Astron ODS alter
[02:31:10] right now but because it's under n $10
[02:31:13] you get two pack you get a pack of
[02:31:15] cards
[02:31:17] P say you want a b Tom Bombadil Serge
[02:31:19] foil you get that that's okay you get
[02:31:21] two packs of cards that's why this is a
[02:31:23] pretty good deal say you get a Lord of
[02:31:25] the Rings collector booster or a ristic
[02:31:28] study or a Aela Exemplar of Justice
[02:31:31] anime foil or that blank SWOT that is a
[02:31:34] collector booster at murder is a Carlo
[02:31:36] Manor there's a good deal in this book
[02:31:38] here I'm actually realizing that I would
[02:31:42] actually jump on that's why I'd do this
[02:31:43] myself watery grave foil retro little
[02:31:48] balin's tomb a steam's foil retro a
[02:31:52] temple Garden foil retro we just filled
[02:31:55] in the spots that were
[02:31:57] pulled here with some high value cards a
[02:32:00] little Temple Garden anime retro River
[02:32:02] Song diary and all those empty spots are
[02:32:05] collective boosters of murders of cof
[02:32:09] Manor so those are all really good
[02:32:11] really good there now the average has
[02:32:14] gone up because of what we put in there
[02:32:15] it is now an average of
[02:32:17] $27 and that each spot is only $22 so
[02:32:20] it's actually this a really good game
[02:32:22] here pretty good uh pretty good setup
[02:32:24] here yes exactly it is a pretty pretty
[02:32:26] Fire game it is I like it that's why we
[02:32:29] try to find something fun to play good
[02:32:31] thing and we um I figured we'll do it in
[02:32:33] every every couple of days I'm going to
[02:32:35] reset the book add some new cards to it
[02:32:38] but that's why you want to get into it
[02:32:40] every day that way as the day progresses
[02:32:43] and the more that is pulled out the
[02:32:46] better deal that book that box become
[02:32:48] that bu book becomes because you have
[02:32:50] more collector boosters that you get out
[02:32:52] of there making that book even better a
[02:32:55] deal but there we go that's our big blue
[02:32:58] book and with that sometimes people like
[02:33:02] packs so what I'm GNA do here is I'm
[02:33:04] going to do packs with a big blue book
[02:33:07] all right packs with a big blue book
[02:33:11] we're gonna call
[02:33:13] and we're g do with this here we're
[02:33:16] going to give you a Murders At Carlo
[02:33:18] Manor guaranteeing you a one and a spin
[02:33:23] of that wheel for the Big Blue Book
[02:33:25] there so let's guarantee yourself a
[02:33:26] murders maybe get yourself a second one
[02:33:28] if you happen one of those empty
[02:33:31] spots or maybe you're G to get yourself
[02:33:34] some packs so it's always for the most
[02:33:36] part you're getting money you're getting
[02:33:37] your money back and
[02:33:39] cards very very rarely you won't because
[02:33:43] those are those are two 19 lows there
[02:33:45] are only 19 lows there and every low
[02:33:47] that gets pulled out ends up becoming an
[02:33:50] empty spot which becomes a collector
[02:33:52] booster of murders at Carla
[02:33:54] Manor which makes the B book even
[02:33:59] better all right I'll put that back in
[02:34:03] there we'll put the book back and we'll
[02:34:05] do some pack
[02:34:06] deals we did get Exelon in so I'm going
[02:34:09] to try doing some Exon pack deals
[02:34:11] because I like the dinos I'm a dyo fan

[02:34:24] murders and we're GNA
[02:34:30] do we're gonna

[02:34:39] let's get some
[02:34:40] triom let's go after some triom I like

[02:39:05] draft you got a rabika draft from your
[02:39:08] sons and you got an i Coria booster now
[02:39:11] because you get two drafts I let you
[02:39:14] pull a second time because I don't like
[02:39:16] when you get two drafts all right so
[02:39:18] what I'm going to do is I'm going to let
[02:39:19] either do you want the son or the father
[02:39:20] to pull Rome to give you another try to
[02:39:23] get something else unless you want two
[02:39:25] Ravnica drafts that
[02:39:30] is because I like to give you the option
[02:39:32] of get potentially getting one of the
[02:39:33] sets or one of the uh collector boosters
[02:39:35] out of there you know there are a couple
[02:39:37] of those in there all right father one
[02:39:41] wait yep all right father's back putting
[02:39:44] the father's back back there we go and
[02:39:48] I'm going to grab want grab one from
[02:39:51] right here all right here we go that is
[02:39:54] it here this is what it is and it is a
[02:39:57] lost Cavern
[02:39:59] excellent draft there you know what
[02:40:01] because we got two drafts I'm making
[02:40:02] that a lost Caverns Exon collect set all
[02:40:06] right I'm making that into a set because
[02:40:08] I don't like when you get two drafts I
[02:40:10] don't like when you get two drafts I'm
[02:40:12] making that into a set all right how's
[02:40:14] that sound that sound like a good
[02:40:16] deal it's one of those things I don't
[02:40:18] like when people get sets and then it
[02:40:19] happens sometimes and I don't like when
[02:40:21] you get lows right I try to do it when
[02:40:24] you can't I don't want I don't like when
[02:40:25] everybody gets only a low is what it is
[02:40:27] you know what I mean that's what I try
[02:40:29] to do make it better exactly so here we
[02:40:31] go you get yourself that Exon got
[02:40:33] yourself that uh ravnik and you got
[02:40:36] yourself that ioria now we're gonna put
[02:40:38] those there here and we're going to see
[02:40:41] which one of these has the better
[02:40:43] highest amount of value card in it which
[02:40:45] means it's Target that'll hit all right
[02:40:47] let's get some good luck maybe we can
[02:40:48] pull you out of Mana or caverns of souls
[02:40:50] out of this all right that'd be pretty
[02:40:52] nice right
[02:40:55] room little monor Cavern of
[02:40:58] souls here we go our R card there and
[02:41:01] then what I'm going to do is I do this
[02:41:03] one two three four five because we like
[02:41:06] to see the spoilers at the end not the
[02:41:07] beginning even though you got a little
[02:41:08] flip card spoiler there all
[02:41:11] right is quinneth nice diamond pickaxe
[02:41:15] kening Minecart volatile
[02:41:19] fault out of air runaway
[02:41:23] Boulder Brazen blade Master hidden
[02:41:27] cataract bringer of the last gift uh
[02:41:30] anime nice Oh Henry woo engine scientist
[02:41:34] that's a nice one too a little Jurassic
[02:41:36] Park card and a dire
[02:41:39] flail and then an AB Bizzle Gore stalker
[02:41:43] for your foil card hi highest was eight
[02:41:46] the highest was an eight we got an eight
[02:41:48] in here oh where's the eight oh look at
[02:41:51] the bring her the last gift all right
[02:41:53] that's going to be a hard one to beat
[02:41:55] there um that's gonna be a hard one to
[02:41:57] beat there and then you have the I think
[02:41:58] the runaway Boulder was the other one
[02:42:00] all right all right so it is eight is
[02:42:03] the high for the father's box let's see
[02:42:05] what happens all right Rica does have
[02:42:07] some good Rica does and same for aoria a
[02:42:11] ioria does have some high ones too yep
[02:42:13] they all have some high ones actually so
[02:42:15] they a good chance you could get a high
[02:42:16] one out of any of these to beat that all
[02:42:19] right here we go let's see what the Suns
[02:42:21] box gets we're going to do the same
[02:42:23] thing where we do one wait they put them
[02:42:25] in order no they did a correct here Al
[02:42:28] Knight is that guildgate no they didn't
[02:42:31] one two three four five and I think this
[02:42:35] one was six where they did it this
[02:42:40] way put the SW the end there Terra Hydro
[02:42:45] oh horn caller chant you got a tie
[02:42:47] already compulsive research totally lost

[02:43:07] giant expansion
[02:43:10] explosion frilled Mystic and a exact
[02:43:13] guildgate see you did have a tie here at
[02:43:18] least you got a tie here with
[02:43:24] sixes and an eight you got an eight
[02:43:27] there all right the eight is still the
[02:43:29] big card to Big to beat here let's see
[02:43:31] if you can win with the
[02:43:35] buyer let's see what you get here maybe
[02:43:37] we can get you a um one of the Godzilla
[02:43:40] cards that's uh one of the I think uh
[02:43:42] one of the nice high ones the high high
[02:43:44] mono ones is a Godzilla couple Godzilla
[02:43:47] ones let's get you some good luck here
[02:43:49] though maybe triom spontaneous flight
[02:43:53] starting development Forbidden

[02:44:18] liger zor zagoth Crystal nice Crystal
[02:44:23] there Slither
[02:44:25] wisp Slither wisp wi scard CAG and your
[02:44:30] tokens there so I think the high card on
[02:44:32] this with the buyer box was a six
[02:44:37] here
[02:44:39] five I think there was a six in here I
[02:44:42] don't think there was anything higher
[02:44:43] than an eight this is Yoda
[02:44:45] think there was nothing higher than an
[02:44:46] eight no it was five five was high all
[02:44:49] right
[02:44:50] so we have
[02:44:53] between the um son's box and the
[02:44:58] father's box so we're g to see we have
[02:45:00] this was down a six do we have any more
[02:45:02] sixes here one two three four five one
[02:45:05] two three four 1 two three four three
[02:45:07] two three three five five five two two
[02:45:13] two four oh there's look like because it
[02:45:16] does go from seven six and then down
[02:45:18] below we do have I mean eight six and a
[02:45:22] six so it does look like the father's
[02:45:24] box did get the win on that one with the
[02:45:27] target there let's see uh you want to
[02:45:30] have me go somewhere random or would you
[02:45:31] like me to have a tell me where to go
[02:45:34] specifically for that father father's
[02:45:36] box it's kind of like a little extra
[02:45:37] card there because sadly the Mana hit
[02:45:40] the father's box as a
[02:45:44] Target what would you like to do Rome

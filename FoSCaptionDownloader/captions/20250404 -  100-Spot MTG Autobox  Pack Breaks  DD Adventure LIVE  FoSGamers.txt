[00:15:31] I can try to help and uh direct a little
[00:15:32] bit but I don't mind uh doing that now I
[00:15:35] know a lot of people uh silver sneak you
[00:15:38] had been wandering around there you came
[00:15:39] out of that Vault you wanted to go uh
[00:15:41] check some other places out now um on
[00:15:45] your way out of the
[00:15:47] Vault you have
[00:15:50] uh find in one of those bur out
[00:15:54] buildings it's old lock
[00:15:57] box not sure what it is I think I got B
[00:16:00] I must have gotten bit by a bug on my
[00:16:02] like knuckle of my thumb here the in
[00:16:05] your room um no I think I'm okay you
[00:16:08] sure yeah actually yeah why not go get
[00:16:10] it please he's going to itch until it
[00:16:13] all right so you wander in there you
[00:16:16] have this uh old box my friend silver
[00:16:18] sneak now you have to decide silver
[00:16:19] sneak all right you need to know
[00:16:22] I do you want to try your luck to open
[00:16:24] the box to see what you'll get or do you
[00:16:26] just kind of want to remember where it
[00:16:27] is and maybe uh
[00:16:29] come back at another time I'm going to
[00:16:30] give people that option every now and
[00:16:32] again Queen all right put it on the
[00:16:34] ground right there then I'll get to it
[00:16:35] in a
[00:16:38] second because you do not have any of
[00:16:40] the any buff to help with anything right
[00:16:42] now you're going to try it out all right
[00:16:43] so that means you're going to choose
[00:16:44] high or
[00:16:50] low let me know so you can figure out
[00:16:53] your roll is low we're rolling low and
[00:16:56] oh
[00:16:59] it was not
[00:17:00] low
[00:17:02] well um I think the problem today is uh
[00:17:06] when you try to open that it's stuck it
[00:17:09] wasn't really it was locked but like you
[00:17:11] kind of unlock get the lock undone but
[00:17:12] it's still shut stuck shut so you go to
[00:17:15] open it and nothing happens there start
[00:17:17] kicking it a little bit nothing occurs
[00:17:21] but you do disturb behind you one of
[00:17:24] these things that were waiting a Ferro
[00:17:25] ghoul they must have been hanging out
[00:17:27] there didn't know they that must be like
[00:17:29] U they probably died off and that might
[00:17:31] be theirs from years ago who knows what
[00:17:32] it is oh boy I just hit the camera that
[00:17:34] was no good let me fix that for was
[00:17:39] there we go all righty
[00:17:42] so silver sneak you have h a
[00:17:47] pistol a knife and a sword some whiskey
[00:17:51] and some rations you have a little
[00:17:53] bugger that's been helping you carry
[00:17:54] around the um toolbox that's locked with
[00:17:58] with some other things too you to stab
[00:18:00] it all right I like
[00:18:02] it time to try to get
[00:18:05] it oh
[00:18:07] buddy well that's a good way to start it
[00:18:10] out in the day for uh having something
[00:18:12] come atch
[00:18:14] you you get that Ferro ghoul in front of
[00:18:16] you and you roll a natural 20 that's
[00:18:19] pretty good well is there anywhere you
[00:18:22] want to specifically
[00:18:27] hit we're going to give you that option
[00:18:29] to pick your location and then what I'm
[00:18:31] going to do here is uh we're going to
[00:18:33] take that two away we're going to do
[00:18:35] this and get you o well that's
[00:18:39] good left leg all right stab it in the
[00:18:42] left leg for two times that you six so
[00:18:45] you get uh six there in the left leg and
[00:18:47] it is only a uh 10 so that actually
[00:18:50] drops it down to four Health that F
[00:18:53] Wills does not like what happened and it
[00:18:55] swings at you but
[00:18:57] luckily it needs a have a 15 or higher
[00:18:59] to hit because you stabbed it oh it
[00:19:03] misses
[00:19:04] you well my friend you're standing there
[00:19:07] with your
[00:19:08] knife that you have in your
[00:19:11] hand are you going to do
[00:19:13] anything you going to continue
[00:19:17] on and then we have more packs available
[00:19:19] if you want to participate in our
[00:19:20] adventuring
[00:19:22] today slow day today uh generally
[00:19:24] Thursdays are different slow right
[00:19:26] before releases and stuff cuz everybody
[00:19:28] goes out do those to do those like we're
[00:19:30] actually planning on oh your sword not
[00:19:32] your knife well there you go your sword
[00:19:35] you still hit them anyways before you
[00:19:37] had enough to hit them before so your
[00:19:40] sword coming up it is sorry I'm sorry I
[00:19:44] was I took that I was I normally go
[00:19:47] with did not expect that so here we go
[00:19:52] sword while your sword you get a well
[00:19:56] yeah go they they're dead
[00:20:00] look at that that's seven and then you
[00:20:03] hit him for before for
[00:20:04] eight
[00:20:07] six no they're almost dead uhoh my math
[00:20:11] is utterly horrible
[00:20:15] today so you hit them and they're almost
[00:20:17] dead they have one Health left it's
[00:20:20] wailing with the stab in his leg it's
[00:20:22] got a leg almost hanging attacks
[00:20:25] you and
[00:20:27] misses you your one last chance with the
[00:20:30] sword wrong one that was it yes
[00:20:34] H but you missed with your sword that's
[00:20:37] not good luck there oh no that's a one
[00:20:41] it's a critical failure and you miss
[00:20:43] that means you you fall the ground gets
[00:20:45] a free
[00:20:47] swing but because he needs to be 15 or
[00:20:49] higher he
[00:20:50] misses does he get a free swing and he
[00:20:52] hit you is that in the middle or is that
[00:20:54] on 19 hold on a second I think that's on
[00:20:58] 19 maybe is that in the
[00:21:01] middle that might be in the middle I
[00:21:03] don't know you guys let me know chat
[00:21:04] what do you think we going to take a
[00:21:06] drink for a
[00:21:11] second now we got Packs to Go people uh
[00:21:15] run those again there all right I'm
[00:21:17] going to say that is on
[00:21:20] it maybe it's the middle it's hard to
[00:21:22] say that kind of looks like it's a
[00:21:24] middle I'm going to have to go that
[00:21:26] looks like it's the
[00:21:27] middle oh oh and they miss another time
[00:21:30] now you got lucky then you finally go
[00:21:32] get your get up with your sword and look
[00:21:34] at that a 20 again and I think this time
[00:21:37] because of 20 that feral ghouls head
[00:21:39] goes rolling on the ground there and you
[00:21:42] find a key on it
[00:21:45] nice that
[00:21:48] key allows you to open the old lock
[00:21:53] box a look at that and inside uh-oh
[00:21:59] that's not what I
[00:22:01] wanted you
[00:22:03] find a pair of crack binoculars who
[00:22:07] knows what you'll need those for
[00:22:08] later and then uh you also
[00:22:13] find some pistol
[00:22:15] ammo an assault rifle and assault rifle
[00:22:19] ammo look at that my friend not bad

[00:25:43] extra you have agility where's your
[00:25:52] agility your agility stuff got moved to
[00:25:54] someone else no wonder why I'm confused
[00:25:58] cuz you had the implants I'm sitting
[00:26:00] there I'm like what's wrong
[00:26:02] there I think I got must have got copied
[00:26:04] and moved to someone else by accident a
[00:26:06] couple people up no wonder where I'm
[00:26:07] looking I'm like I swear you had Buffs
[00:26:09] you have four agility minus two on your
[00:26:11] strength and minus one on your luck
[00:26:12] because of your uh because your implant
[00:26:15] that you got there your your mystery
[00:26:18] chip that you had them implanting you
[00:26:20] not bad
[00:26:21] though I was wondering why we were
[00:26:24] getting
[00:26:25] confused right right hey all right well
[00:26:30] we are going to be opening some packs
[00:26:31] tomorrow definitely no matter what we'll
[00:26:33] be opening some stuff we have some um a
[00:26:35] bunch of dragons to go and look for
[00:26:38] today tomorrow uh as for today we're
[00:26:41] doing our uh adventuring maybe uh maybe
[00:26:43] we'll see some dragons in the tomorrow
[00:26:46] depending on where we go I was trying to
[00:26:48] get something um intriguing set up but
[00:26:51] um I don't know we'll have some fun
[00:26:53] today for a little bit I think I'll only
[00:26:55] stay on for a little while though like I
[00:26:56] said I have a I have a bunch of stuff to
[00:26:58] do today I have to finish hopefully we
[00:27:00] can finish getting the majority of our
[00:27:02] Arch uh put together on the boat so we
[00:27:04] can put
[00:27:06] it on tomorrow like afternoon or
[00:27:09] something and then kind of like be done
[00:27:10] with everything that would be nice we
[00:27:13] have it all measured out it's half an it
[00:27:14] uh half a foot too long though right now
[00:27:16] so we just have to pull the pipes in a
[00:27:17] little bit then we have to measure
[00:27:21] again
[00:27:23] um once there's some tension on
[00:27:26] them and um make sure it goes down to
[00:27:29] the like the the size that we have it to
[00:27:31] with the dingy up and all that and then
[00:27:33] we're going to I don't know we'll see
[00:27:35] how it goes I think it's going to so far
[00:27:38] plans are working out as I was kind of
[00:27:39] expecting but just a little longer
[00:27:41] because of know when you're on a boat
[00:27:44] everything takes longer I guess right
[00:27:47] you have to go somewhere by a dingy to
[00:27:48] get to it somewhere else so that makes
[00:27:50] it longer or you just so far away from
[00:27:53] everything it just takes a long time to
[00:27:54] get
[00:27:55] there all right well we're going to hang
[00:27:57] out for a a little bit we got nothing
[00:27:59] going on this Thursday
[00:28:01] morning it's a day before release
[00:28:04] everybody's saving their money to go out

[00:28:22] to
[00:28:25] make I don't have so many things open

[00:32:04] opportunity and I'm looking at what we

[00:37:10] what I
[00:37:12] expected did you
[00:37:19] uh did you get any uh of the Deadpool
[00:37:23] stuff my friend
[00:37:31] yeah exactly I knew they like I was
[00:37:34] reading them every time I looked them
[00:37:35] like is it going to go up and people
[00:37:36] like I know I don't
[00:37:38] know oh nice those will be good to have
[00:37:40] in the store that's good yeah we got a I
[00:37:43] got like a hand like you know three each
[00:37:45] you know the three that we got of them
[00:37:47] so that was pretty that like some one
[00:37:48] for me and the family and then one for
[00:37:51] like the uh the store one to kind of
[00:37:54] hold on to in a way you know so I don't
[00:37:57] have a a big box store like you do my
[00:37:59] friend big
[00:38:00] BK now you're wandering towards you have
[00:38:05] B you have a a vault born here you're
[00:38:10] wandering towards
[00:38:12] this Vault you found that stuff you
[00:38:14] picked up your metal you're over there
[00:38:16] you're picking your metal
[00:38:18] up let me see let me get you over
[00:38:25] here you now have
[00:38:28] two ties of metal because you have those
[00:38:30] things you gave away the mystery chips
[00:38:33] before didn't you no it was just the uh
[00:38:36] the other
[00:38:38] chip you have three code
[00:38:44] discs I don't think my thing saved when
[00:38:46] I made updates the other
[00:38:49] day yeah death one yep definitely
[00:38:52] definitely all right
[00:38:55] you when you're over there you you find
[00:38:57] that metal you're digging through it I
[00:38:58] was like oh well that's intriguing you
[00:39:00] got some things but you're digging
[00:39:00] through the metal and you also
[00:39:04] find another one of these what wa wait a
[00:39:09] minute I thought I thought you had all
[00:39:12] of
[00:39:16] them
[00:39:19] oh oh
[00:39:22] [Â __Â ]
[00:39:24] ah I see you well well well you pick
[00:39:29] that up you're like uh intriguing put
[00:39:32] that in your
[00:39:39] pocket with the rest of your code discs
[00:39:43] you got putting you at four of
[00:39:48] those well you put those up pick all
[00:39:52] those things up wander like oh that's
[00:39:53] interesting I thought I only needed
[00:39:55] three also needed only a couple of chips
[00:39:58] but I had four too so if I only needed a
[00:40:01] couple chips but I only had then I had
[00:40:02] four maybe I do need more of other
[00:40:04] things I don't know we'll
[00:40:09] see ah yeah we'll see we'll
[00:40:15] see we'll
[00:40:18] see all right well I will say I think
[00:40:21] there is one other person that has
[00:40:23] something a code themselves in this
[00:40:25] Wasteland that they got at some point
[00:40:27] point so I know there's another person
[00:40:30] that got one maybe it's maybe it's uh I
[00:40:33] think it I believe silver sneak may have
[00:40:35] had one yeah right yep silver sneak has
[00:40:39] a mystery chip all right hold
[00:40:41] on I think it was silver sneak Maybe I'm
[00:40:43] Wrong there I thought one other person
[00:40:46] had
[00:40:48] one my thing's don't shave but anyways
[00:40:51] it's not necessar that you need
[00:40:54] different ones maybe you need three but
[00:40:56] the three right ones
[00:40:57] or maybe you need the three that go to
[00:41:00] the Vault not the three that go to
[00:41:02] another
[00:41:06] location no there are more found or
[00:41:09] maybe you need five you don't know
[00:41:12] exactly
[00:41:14] so while you're wandering you finally
[00:41:16] you get back towards the uh the Vault
[00:41:19] there the edge of the Vault you see the
[00:41:21] vault door closing behind someone as
[00:41:23] they wander inside and you go what is
[00:41:25] that
[00:41:27] and and the guy there goes uh nothing
[00:41:29] mind your business what do you
[00:41:33] need must have been when you fell
[00:41:38] asleep he's like you weren't supposed to
[00:41:40] see that what are you doing what are you
[00:41:42] looking
[00:41:45] for oh you're going to tell him to open
[00:41:47] the vault yeah we can't open it from we
[00:41:49] don't open the vault from this side it
[00:41:51] only opens from the other side you have
[00:41:52] to write code and then they accept it
[00:41:54] and they open it from the other side
[00:41:55] hitting the okay
[00:42:01] well no matter what you do that Vault
[00:42:03] born guy hold on let me get back to the
[00:42:05] image there why don't the image go away
[00:42:08] the Vault borne NPC that's hanging out
[00:42:10] there he's like you know no matter if
[00:42:11] you kill me or not I'm like their lacky
[00:42:14] might as well be a dog I screwed up they
[00:42:17] kick me out here now I have to guard and
[00:42:19] then if I guard long enough they might
[00:42:20] let me back in so you kill me it's not
[00:42:23] really going to matter to them
[00:42:27] but they are the only ones that open the
[00:42:29] door they only open it when we come with
[00:42:31] the supplies that we need that they tell
[00:42:34] us to get the audacity I
[00:42:42] have you can't lie that does look like a
[00:42:44] beaten up Captain America I know no will
[00:42:48] keeps telling me that looks like a
[00:42:49] beaten Captain America all right let's
[00:42:51] try to figure the code out all right
[00:42:52] well you head over there you talk to him
[00:42:54] all right fine like what code oh tell
[00:42:56] him I got some
[00:42:57] I have some uh codes myself to and he
[00:43:01] takes a look at what you hand him you
[00:43:04] hand him four of these goes ah I
[00:43:08] see well uh we can give it to Handy
[00:43:11] helper bot in front there and they might
[00:43:12] be able to help you figure out if those
[00:43:13] are the right
[00:43:17] ones so you wander back around to the
[00:43:21] front to where the handy helper bot
[00:43:25] is if any anyone else wants jump in you
[00:43:27] can you talk to that handy helper bot
[00:43:29] you say here are some
[00:43:32] codes all right now handy hbot looks at
[00:43:36] him goes ah yes I see you have uh couple
[00:43:39] codes here a couple of them are
[00:43:41] scrambled yeah none of them are full but
[00:43:44] you have uh you have some to the door
[00:43:46] here it looks like you might have almost
[00:43:47] all of it but not all of it yet they're
[00:43:50] looking he's looking at it beeping
[00:43:52] buzzing beeping buzzing goes uh I don't
[00:43:55] know if you need necessarily more but
[00:43:57] there's one to a location and I can't
[00:43:58] figure out what the location is you have
[00:43:59] one full code to one location it doesn't
[00:44:02] tell me what it is Handy Hal saying and
[00:44:05] it but I do know that you have a partial
[00:44:07] one to the the vault door so I don't
[00:44:10] know you're lucky you got a code to
[00:44:12] somewhere but I I can't tell where it is
[00:44:14] that part of it
[00:44:15] corrupted so it looks like two of those
[00:44:17] is the code to somewhere else and two of
[00:44:19] those may be the code of the vault
[00:44:21] door well at least you're not like
[00:44:23] striking out right
[00:44:40] I drink some of the coffee
[00:44:46] here all right you put those two off to
[00:44:48] the side you get the code full code
[00:44:51] random code you don't
[00:44:53] know what it goes to
[00:45:09] all righty let's do that there let's see
[00:45:11] how we got going on my friends oo not
[00:45:14] bad I like it you get a modern Horizon 3
[00:45:17] that's a good pickup my buddy
[00:45:19] Opel keep those two going to continue on
[00:45:22] all right let's go let's open this up
[00:45:23] let's see what we get here and then you
[00:45:26] are uh
[00:45:28] wander around with a random code to
[00:45:29] somewhere one two three four five six
[00:45:33] seven eight I do believe that some of
[00:45:36] these ones have the middle still with
[00:45:39] hits but we'll see what you get here
[00:45:40] good luck my friend big you have a
[00:45:43] Sheltering landscape area
[00:45:45] auxiliary Twisted landscape Dro claw
[00:45:49] Glimpse The Impossible Aether Spike
[00:45:53] refurbished familiar copy crook ter
[00:45:57] color Idol of the false god a nice one
[00:46:00] on that one victimize white of The Relic
[00:46:04] for your rare alrai repurpose her and
[00:46:07] foil mountain and your
[00:46:11] fian for your
[00:46:23] uh oh you want to you want to try to
[00:46:26] like uh
[00:46:27] deceive them I get it all right let's
[00:46:29] see you have let's see what you got for
[00:46:31] your uh your Buffs you got here all
[00:46:33] right so you have some luck you have
[00:46:35] some
[00:46:36] intelligence you have some engineering
[00:46:39] you have some
[00:46:44] strength which is a little bit of
[00:46:47] everything so you can try uh well I mean
[00:46:50] the luck in the intelligence might help
[00:46:52] a little bit but it's going to be a hard
[00:46:54] one because remember it's not deceiving
[00:46:56] h
[00:46:57] that you have the code it's deceiving
[00:46:59] the other people that you have the code
[00:47:01] oh what big BK I already got I already
[00:47:03] got one for
[00:47:07] you
[00:47:08] so yes the other people so you go you
[00:47:11] can try you can say hey I got a couple
[00:47:12] of the code pieces here and see if they
[00:47:14] let you
[00:47:15] in and uh see what happens maybe I mean
[00:47:18] you can try it all right all right we'll
[00:47:19] see what happens then so that
[00:47:23] means you're going to need to have a 13
[00:47:25] or higher all right because you're
[00:47:28] trying to deceive them it would have
[00:47:30] been a 15 because you get by couple
[00:47:32] extra will be a 13 or higher
[00:47:35] or what would that
[00:47:38] be 13 or higher or a uh seven or lower
[00:47:43] 13 or
[00:47:49] higher
[00:47:52] well you tried to deceive those inside
[00:47:55] and all you hear over the intercom is is
[00:47:57] uh Hey careful with this guy don't trust
[00:48:00] him anymore VOR NPC guy our buddy the
[00:48:04] Vault born dude we'll call
[00:48:08] um Captain Wasteland since will will
[00:48:12] seems to think he looks like Captain
[00:48:13] America Captain Wason looks at you and
[00:48:16] goes what are you trying to do
[00:48:24] here like dude I told you only get in
[00:48:28] with the code I'm not even allowed in
[00:48:31] I'm captain
[00:48:39] Wasteland
[00:48:40] fine all right my buddy I'm I'm going to
[00:48:43] tell you you need three at least three
[00:48:45] generally I go in with more because they
[00:48:47] like to have a security like
[00:48:49] extra uh but you need at least three and
[00:48:51] when they take it from you you don't get
[00:48:53] any more back until you get your next
[00:48:54] assignment so like I don't even have one
[00:48:56] right now only some dude wandering
[00:48:57] around with an assignment might have
[00:49:01] one n try to go and find some more Cod
[00:49:04] pieces I like
[00:49:05] it I like it so you turn around start
[00:49:08] heading
[00:49:11] out go back out in the
[00:49:13] Wasteland when you get back out
[00:49:16] there you happen to see one of these
[00:49:19] dudes in front of you this large Raider
[00:49:22] that is a 17 or higher to strike
[00:49:24] them and they've got an axe
[00:49:27] what would you like to do my friend you
[00:49:29] I know you have a bunch of good weapons
[00:49:31] here slice them up all right you use
[00:49:33] your agility you get plus two with your
[00:49:38] pirate sword giving you plus three total
[00:49:41] and then strength gives you plus
[00:49:45] four then the sword in total gives you +
[00:49:50] [Music]
[00:49:51] seven so that's plus 11 on your roll
[00:50:00] here dude I am
[00:50:04] sorry likeed ban I am
[00:50:08] sorry that did not that didn't go in
[00:50:11] your favor my
[00:50:12] friend you uh you swing your pirate
[00:50:15] sword your Mighty upgraded
[00:50:17] sword and he uh and you he is able to
[00:50:21] dodge it slightly I guess this guy's
[00:50:22] quicker than you expected and they go
[00:50:26] after you with their axe they need a 13
[00:50:29] or higher to hit you and that wow looks
[00:50:32] like you got you're you're both just
[00:50:34] whiffing he swings at
[00:50:36] you completely misses As you move out of
[00:50:38] the way with your agility and he's
[00:50:42] like intriguing you going to try one
[00:50:45] more time let's do it
[00:50:49] again oh well this time this time it's a
[00:50:52] hit and didn't you say your number was
[00:50:54] 42 for your uh or did you no it's two
[00:50:57] two is your number you're always two the
[00:50:59] other my other my other friend yeps is
[00:51:01] four so you did not hit your
[00:51:04] two oh well I appreciate that George but
[00:51:07] you did hit them for
[00:51:09] 12 16
[00:51:12] 18 so you hit him for 18 that large
[00:51:15] Raider is actually only 30 so that
[00:51:17] brings him down to 12 the large Raider
[00:51:20] whales in
[00:51:23] pain and they swing at you with their
[00:51:28] Axe and again you're able to dodge them
[00:51:32] out of the
[00:51:32] way and you swing another time with your
[00:51:35] sword I'm guessing slice them up and per
[00:51:39] oh well look at that a natural 20 for
[00:51:41] you my friend we're going to let the uh
[00:51:44] the electricity go off
[00:51:45] here you swing your
[00:51:48] sword you're
[00:51:51] upgraded pirate
[00:51:53] sword all right Electric see come you
[00:51:57] you see a spark of lightning come down
[00:51:58] as you strike
[00:52:01] him he shocks starts twitching all over
[00:52:04] the place turns into fire and poofs into
[00:52:07] an
[00:52:11] ashes I know some I've been those are
[00:52:13] things that I want to work on I've been
[00:52:14] I have I have some things like that I've
[00:52:16] been working on but I I just don't have
[00:52:18] the time to get it all done with
[00:52:19] everything else going on in
[00:52:21] life so you smash
[00:52:23] them small limitations yes
[00:52:27] exactly so you uh you smash that guy
[00:52:29] with a a giant electric shock there that
[00:52:31] that poofs now the
[00:52:34] axe comes
[00:52:37] out on SK so you're lucky you get the
[00:52:39] axe from them but everything else on
[00:52:42] them they don't really have anything
[00:52:44] except you do
[00:52:47] find one of their uh Slammers they C
[00:52:50] happen have they only had one of them on
[00:52:52] them that's 10 so you get 10 Slammers in
[00:52:54] the
[00:52:55] axe I mean 10 pogs and the
[00:52:59] ax I mean it didn't look like he had
[00:53:01] much on them in the first place did it
[00:53:03] there we go let's get to your so you are
[00:53:04] at 230 pox you got to find someone to
[00:53:07] hang out with I think 230 I thought it
[00:53:10] was unless I missed one from before Oh I
[00:53:12] didn't put the 20 in from before did I
[00:53:15] oh dang
[00:53:17] it come
[00:53:21] on that's probably what I missed 50 from
[00:53:24] that uh yep 230 all right 230
[00:53:27] is all right so what we're going on here
[00:53:31] kill that guy we're going to do I think

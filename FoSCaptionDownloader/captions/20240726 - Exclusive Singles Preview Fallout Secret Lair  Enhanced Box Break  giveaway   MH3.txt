[00:14:03] too different it's a little too hard you
[00:14:05] know what I
[00:14:08] mean so we have that one call forth The
[00:14:14] Tempest
[00:14:21] is I like to give you guys the right
[00:14:23] prices on stuff you know I don't like to

[00:14:39] right here which is going to
[00:14:41] be what is the price of that
[00:14:45] one all right we do that and then the
[00:14:48] other one was oh that was
[00:14:51] not nice that's a lot better than I
[00:14:53] thought it was then uh you did want Dr
[00:14:57] Ian that one I think this one wasn't
[00:14:59] much
[00:15:02] Lea all the
[00:15:04] eggs I know you get lots of eggs there
[00:15:06] with

[00:15:09] debating on doing yeah that ends in
[00:15:12] there 14 that's not a want at
[00:15:17] all all right and then let's see if I
[00:15:19] want to get rid of that one oh I don't
[00:15:21] know that was a hard one to come by I to
[00:15:23] find that one but I haven't put it in
[00:15:24] anything
[00:15:30] so I'm saying I'm going through my sets

[00:38:35] good but if I get like a whole thing of
[00:38:38] junk and then none of them worth
[00:38:39] anything also and I get upset that's
[00:38:42] what I get
[00:38:43] upset Hayward did their Hayward say what

[01:41:33] confusing to me they were like going to
[01:41:35] test it or something I didn't understand
[01:41:37] how to do that one but I'll have to play
[01:41:39] around with it so I can understand a

[02:08:55] always you feel
[02:09:01] attacked well Mr Fong you were attacking
[02:09:04] us pretty good so I guess it's a little
[02:09:06] bit of reverse
[02:09:09] finally so uh when we were playing over
[02:09:11] the last weekend on Sunday yeah it we
[02:09:14] kept trying to figure out how to get rid
[02:09:15] of his line Umbra uh because that was
[02:09:18] what was causing us have a little bit of
[02:09:19] headache there with his with his
[02:09:21] character
[02:09:22] so with his uh with his Commander that's
[02:09:25] what we were uh joking about right there
[02:09:27] like oh great why number again coming
[02:09:30] out I almost want to burn the card this
[02:09:31] is such a
[02:09:32] headache good card but I mean it was a
[02:09:34] headache to play
[02:09:36] against but it was
[02:09:39] fun it was fun we had a good
[02:09:43] time just going through some of this see
[02:09:46] much we got sing it up these are from
[02:09:49] the bundle that I opened a while back
[02:09:51] maybe somebody would like to jump in on
[02:09:53] one
[02:09:55] themselves I don't
[02:10:00] know now we have
[02:10:02] our enhanced Commander Legends box there
[02:10:06] you get a codec Shredder potentially a
[02:10:08] steam vents blood Letter and tomb waste
[02:10:10] and a Timber protector foil there you
[02:10:13] potentially get any of
[02:10:16] those if you uh jump in because it's
[02:10:19] written on the back of them that's
[02:10:21] what's written on the back of them
[02:10:27] all let's see now I don't know what like
[02:10:29] anybody have a good idea for uh good
[02:10:31] idea or good place to do for checking
[02:10:33] your um checking like a deck strength CU
[02:10:36] we were trying to play and we were
[02:10:37] trying to figure out that we were using
[02:10:39] the um Commander assault but uh felt
[02:10:44] like it was a little off on what it was
[02:10:46] saying for what ones were strength and
[02:10:48] what ones weren't but if anybody else
[02:10:51] has any ideas do let me know we got a
[02:10:53] lot of fun things that are out there
[02:10:55] check the buy now we do have a lot of
[02:10:58] cool ones there we do have a lot of fun
[02:10:59] stuff in the um by now for even like
[02:11:02] doing some of the games and stuff you
[02:11:04] want to jump in remember it's always up
[02:11:06] to you guys where we go because for some
[02:11:08] reason you know it's slowed down that's
[02:11:11] fine but we can always play our game
[02:11:15] where you are the character here
[02:11:17] wandering through the Wasteland so it's
[02:11:20] up to you if you ever want jump in and
[02:11:21] do that
[02:11:23] anymore that's uh if you want to do the
[02:11:25] Wasteland Adventure game you'd see that
[02:11:28] as the uh in the box there I think it's
[02:11:30] number two or three or something like
[02:11:36] that yeah see that's what I was
[02:11:38] wondering too it doesn't seem like it
[02:11:40] accurately counts for some of that stuff
[02:11:43] that's what the problem is um yeah see I
[02:11:46] don't know if there's another deck see
[02:11:47] like I have mine in Mana box and I
[02:11:49] didn't know if there was another thing
[02:11:51] that we could use cuz there's some I
[02:11:52] wanted to make some changes but I don't
[02:11:54] want to make it too too like crazy then
[02:11:56] I also don't want to make it like not
[02:11:58] good that I'm just get whooped you know
[02:12:00] what I
[02:12:04] mean it
[02:12:14] lies yeah I don't know so if anybody has
[02:12:16] an idea of what to do for uh for doing
[02:12:20] that I would very much appreciate it CU
[02:12:22] we're not really sure on it we used a
[02:12:24] commander salt and it worked but it

[02:12:36] happens well I think I said we were
[02:12:39] going to stay away from like tutors so I

[02:24:47] home it helps a little bit with the um
[02:24:49] children keeping track of that

[02:25:36] last day or so because we have a um like
[02:25:40] some we like the dragons people have
[02:25:41] been talking about dragons which made us

[02:25:50] what we get for Dragons out of
[02:25:53] it so far we haven't hit any of the big
[02:25:56] dragons I will say that we have not hit
[02:25:58] any of the big dragons out of it which
[02:25:59] actually surprised
[02:26:01] me but I think it's because we got lucky
[02:26:04] with the packs initially and they pulled
[02:26:06] out some uh good stuff for the uh the
[02:26:08] extras on them the enhanced box see
[02:26:12] instead of uh you always get your pack
[02:26:15] but you're gonna get a chance of getting
[02:26:16] one of those uh singles with

[02:28:12] go yeah I don't know maybe I'll be lucky
[02:28:14] enough to get
[02:28:16] one I have a feeling we will but it's
[02:28:19] going to be one of last boxes that we
[02:28:21] open out of everything because that's
[02:28:22] how my life goes it's always the last
[02:28:24] thing that's available or we don't do it
[02:28:26] at all so it's up to you all we'll see
[02:28:29] what happens going through some of these
[02:28:31] now remember that's what we got from our
[02:28:32] collector
[02:28:33] boosters I mean our our our gift box
[02:28:36] this is what we've gotten out of a gift
[02:28:38] box from um modern Horizon 3 so I mean
[02:28:40] it's not the best thing here but hey
[02:28:43] whatever it was an all right box could
[02:28:46] have been better was it worth 50
[02:28:50] or so that they
[02:28:52] cost I don't know they're all right I
[02:28:55] don't know if it was worth that much
[02:28:57] would I do it
[02:28:58] again I don't know bundles are always
[02:29:01] nice I might do it
[02:29:09] again knock my whole box of sleeves over
[02:29:12] and luckily they all stayed together in
[02:29:14] a bunch that I was able to just pick
[02:29:15] them up
[02:29:22] that worked out nicely oh no I did it
[02:29:25] again can't lean it
[02:29:29] down I'm horrible at everything I'm
[02:29:31] doing right now maybe this is telling me
[02:29:32] it's time to leave might be one of those
[02:29:35] moments it's like it's time to leave
[02:29:40] dude things are falling it's not a good
[02:29:43] time right now time to
[02:29:46] go we'll see one more give it a minute

[02:30:01] going to be over I keep getting
[02:30:05] glitches 1,000 currently for a monobolt
[02:30:08] from Fallout nice it used to be like a

[02:30:14] first
[02:30:15] us it's insane how much they are worth

[00:22:24] marriage is not a uh people may think
[00:22:26] it's a vacation in times but it isn't

[00:22:32] have to say so you have to put work
[00:22:34] in doesn't just
[00:22:37] happen I don't know if that makes any
[00:22:39] sense it's not a job but it is in ways
[00:22:43] like if that makes
[00:22:47] sense like you can't just expect it to
[00:22:50] work because you're there you have to
[00:22:53] put some effort
[00:22:55] in I don't know how else to explain that

[00:25:37] said I have the rare that's in here
[00:25:39] where did I put it there's a rare right
[00:25:42] now not a big hit but it's a rare from
[00:25:43] Commander Masters I end up enhancing the
[00:25:46] rares as the uh the day goes if we have
[00:25:48] more things that happen throughout the
[00:25:52] day but I'll go with anybody give me a
[00:25:54] number between one and 10 I'd appreciate
[00:25:56] it and then right now though we have is
[00:25:59] what our break is it's $28 and what we
[00:26:01] do is we open all the packs we write
[00:26:05] your names down as you can see here on
[00:26:08] the couple people that are already in it
[00:26:09] that's why there's only eight available
[00:26:12] and then what we do is um we open them
[00:26:14] all up we check out all the mythics the
[00:26:16] we take all the mythics rares and cards
[00:26:18] over $3 we put them into his sleeves
[00:26:20] then we Shuffle those all up and we hand
[00:26:22] them out based on the order you bought
[00:26:24] in doesn't really it's not really a big
[00:26:25] deal but that's how we do it that way
[00:26:27] they get shuffled up doesn't really
[00:26:28] matter then one two three four five six
[00:26:32] seven all the uncommons in Commons and
[00:26:36] up getting um done later on in the later
[00:26:39] time frame like in the day or something
[00:26:40] like that so hopefully we can get
[00:26:42] through this break today we broke
[00:26:43] through the S one pretty fun yesterday
[00:26:44] it was a good one this yesterday morning
[00:26:46] we started out had a great time a few of
[00:26:48] them we've been doing but this one uh we
[00:26:51] didn't finish in the afternoon they and
[00:26:52] we request a second one so we put
[00:26:53] another one out see if anybody want to
[00:26:55] try it out and all what happened
[00:26:58] but we do have Labor Day sixpack sales
[00:27:00] is like I was saying
[00:27:02] there so pretty much all the things that
[00:27:04] we have available in the buy now or if I
[00:27:06] happen to miss it in the buy now you
[00:27:08] should be able to see them all on the
[00:27:09] screen here jump in on them and see what
[00:27:13] happens but we have a lot of uh a lot of
[00:27:16] people on on Labor Day just because it's
[00:27:18] a a special thing going on on whatnot so
[00:27:21] there's more people on than normal and
[00:27:23] today I happen to be tired so that
[00:27:25] happens to be probably one of the worst
[00:27:26] days than ever to have a lot more people
[00:27:28] on the
[00:27:34] normal if that makes any
[00:27:37] sense let's see what we got going
[00:27:42] on I think we'll
[00:27:46] um see another combo
[00:27:51] deal we'll call it
[00:28:00] you know what we'll say any of these
[00:28:05] six six of these any of these four right
[00:28:08] here six of any of these four that's
[00:28:10] what I'll
[00:28:12] say let's do
[00:28:16] that let's do
[00:28:22] that we'll call
[00:28:24] that yeah yeah that'll work

[00:29:46] we'll have a good one I mean we'll see
[00:29:47] what happens it's it seems like it's
[00:29:49] going to be a lucky day we've had some
[00:29:50] luck the last few days so I think we'll
[00:29:52] have some
[00:29:54] more I feel like we could have some more
[00:29:56] at least we should have some
[00:30:06] more we'll find out
[00:30:11] though if you guys want to jump in on it
[00:30:13] we got to a few more of them than there

[00:30:19] itchy all
[00:30:21] right let's see hopefully we can get
[00:30:25] this one closed out quickly cuz that was
[00:30:27] fun lastday morning getting it all done

[00:31:14] friend put you over there we need a
[00:31:17] number between um one and 10 one two
[00:31:22] three four five six seven eight nine 10
[00:31:27] yep
[00:31:29] number 11 it is so we going with number
[00:31:33] one okay one two three four five
[00:31:37] six I figured we were doing like the all
[00:31:39] the way around type thing that's what it
[00:31:41] was going on that's why he said number
[00:31:43] 11 this is one of those we got to go
[00:31:45] around in
[00:31:48] circles thought about
[00:31:52] it kid Kelly coming in one so we
[00:31:55] need seven more I say we can get through
[00:31:58] this I say we can get through this this
[00:32:00] morning here get through the break here
[00:32:02] we got seven more spots not bad we got
[00:32:04] some good ones in here we got these
[00:32:07] other packs my friends and then we have
[00:32:09] these right here also on this side for
[00:32:13] our packs so there's 21 packs in here
[00:32:17] that is our break we got going this
[00:32:18] morning as you can
[00:32:20] see it is a fun one we like to do these
[00:32:24] good little fun breaks in the mornings
[00:32:27] for all you to have some good times with
[00:32:30] hopefully we can get through those in a
[00:32:32] little while I feel like we can get
[00:32:33] through that in a few minutes here I
[00:32:34] gave it gave it about um 20 minutes half
[00:32:37] hour I'm
[00:32:38] thinking all right so Billy the the way
[00:32:41] that I uh do a break here is we do um we
[00:32:44] open all the packs I take all the
[00:32:47] mythics the rares and the cards that are
[00:32:49] $3 or more um I shuffle them up and I
[00:32:54] put them in sleeves first obviously
[00:32:56] shuffle them up if it's a big hit we put
[00:32:58] him in like a a proxy in and then uh as
[00:33:02] you can see there's a couple of people
[00:33:03] that have already purchased and gotten
[00:33:04] in so well and then kid Kelly I got to
[00:33:07] write their name down too so it would go
[00:33:09] first this was the first one that was
[00:33:10] the second one and I would just take the
[00:33:11] shuffle cards and hand them out on top
[00:33:12] of them on top of each person's name
[00:33:15] until they're all handed out um show you
[00:33:17] what you got based on where you were and
[00:33:20] you could get maybe you know whatever it
[00:33:21] is like randomly throughout what we open
[00:33:24] and then I take all the commons and
[00:33:25] uncommons that are under $3
[00:33:28] and later on in the day I go through
[00:33:30] those and I just hand them out to
[00:33:32] everyone um generally it's a live stream
[00:33:34] I do at some point later in the
[00:33:40] day I'm probably gonna end up taking a
[00:33:42] nap at some point today because I
[00:33:44] uh did not sleep well today did not
[00:33:47] sleep well last night think it was I
[00:33:50] forgot my heartburn last I woke up a
[00:33:52] couple times more than once
[00:34:07] Perfecto we're waiting on some people to
[00:34:10] um get back to us about some for the
[00:34:12] boat so I keep looking at my phone so we
[00:34:14] were talking to somebody about a boat
[00:34:15] and she's in the other side of the world
[00:34:17] at the moment so she might be getting to
[00:34:18] us now later I don't know but
[00:34:21] anyways but that is our break at the
[00:34:23] moment that's how it works not too bad I
[00:34:25] mean I thought I thought it was a pretty
[00:34:26] fair way of doing things that way it's
[00:34:28] kind of like your same thing as getting
[00:34:29] a pack of cards everything is shuffled
[00:34:30] up you know you could get a big one you
[00:34:32] could get just something though is what
[00:34:34] you're going to guaranteed something of
[00:34:35] some kind and that's why I like doing it
[00:34:37] because you guaranteed some type of
[00:34:38] rares mythics or like I said card over
[00:34:41] $3 that's why we do it the way we do
[00:34:48] it take it and do it that way we have a
[00:34:51] couple people in I got to take one of
[00:34:53] our buddies here write it down
[00:34:59] write our name down on
[00:35:02] uh next card here when we use random
[00:35:06] cards that I have from opening up over
[00:35:13] time like these are random
[00:35:16] uh cards that we use in some of the
[00:35:19] other games that we do at Point
[00:35:20] different points we've been off on the
[00:35:21] games recently just because uh hav been
[00:35:23] traveling and stuff so kid Kelly will
[00:35:25] come in and that'll be the third one
[00:35:27] because kid Kelly in for the third
[00:35:28] person so that's how we do that there

[00:35:33] ones we had uh yesterday we had um oh

[00:48:41] days
[00:48:43] yeah
[00:48:46] fle yeah I have a couple fle
[00:48:49] myself I know the B hasn't been working
[00:48:52] so we don't have any of those extra
[00:48:53] things to do like the d10s and those to
[00:48:55] find our numbers which
[00:48:57] stinks but that's okay today we have
[00:49:01] eight seven swots available I mean in
[00:49:03] our thing
[00:49:05] here a break with magic work bro all
[00:49:08] right the way we do this is we have all
[00:49:11] these packs that we open here and the
[00:49:13] way that I do the break is we take all
[00:49:14] of the rares mythics and uncommons or
[00:49:18] Commons worth $3 or more we put them in
[00:49:21] the sleeves we shuffle them up and we
[00:49:23] hand them out in order of who purchased
[00:49:25] all right so like right now we have
[00:49:26] three people people in there it be
[00:49:27] handed out first one two three then
[00:49:29] whoever all the way through the 10 now
[00:49:31] we also have these in there too
[00:49:33] obviously there's these ones but now
[00:49:34] then the next thing is all the uncommons
[00:49:37] and Commons that are under $3 we end up
[00:49:39] doing off stream like off this stream
[00:49:42] like on a live like just a regular
[00:49:43] YouTube live type thing where I just
[00:49:45] quickly go through them and hand them
[00:49:47] all out to everyone that's how it
[00:49:50] goes a I gotta pick that up pick that up
[00:49:53] you you can't drop that Dalton can't let
[00:49:55] that hit the ground
[00:50:04] oh interesting yeah Mike if you can tell
[00:50:06] me send me send me something of that
[00:50:07] info I would appreciate
[00:50:09] that because I'm guessing it has
[00:50:12] something to do with the most recent
[00:50:13] Chrome update more than
[00:50:16] anything and um it's looking to sell the
[00:50:20] project interesting I wonder I wonder I
[00:50:22] might I might be interesting in buying
[00:50:25] it I wonder if I could to work with with
[00:50:28] YouTube
[00:50:29] also I have to talk to them they should
[00:50:32] have them reach out to
[00:50:37] me yeah I know exactly good hunch to me
[00:50:40] I'm guessing there's like probably two
[00:50:41] or three lines of code that we need to
[00:50:42] adjust in there to get it work with the
[00:50:44] new soft with the new Chrome update is
[00:50:47] my guess that'll be easy enough to do
[00:50:49] I've done that more than once not too
[00:50:51] bad Frank that's what I used to do for a
[00:50:54] living I used to go I was a developer
[00:50:57] for years and then I one of my things I
[00:50:59] used to do a lot was fix other people's
[00:51:01] things that like oh this is what used to
[00:51:02] be working i' be all right go like oh
[00:51:04] well what who updated what oh you
[00:51:06] updated this all right we got to adjust
[00:51:08] this now yeah not not too
[00:51:13] bad yeah I'm pretty sure that's what it
[00:51:16] is I think there was a Chrome update
[00:51:18] recently so I'm guessing the extension
[00:51:19] is not working there's probably like
[00:51:20] three or four lines of code that need to
[00:51:22] be changed most of the time that's what
[00:51:24] it is unless they make a giant update
[00:51:26] and Chrome and they very rarely do that
[00:51:28] big of an update on a regular basis in
[00:51:29] Chrome I mean they have sometimes but
[00:51:32] not
[00:51:36] normally yeah so I
[00:51:44] don't oh that sucks dude thank you Mike
[00:51:48] thank you I yeah we were looking at
[00:51:51] getting um a couple of places I didn't
[00:51:53] know that you you just missed it by like
[00:51:55] a year or something huh
[00:51:57] is my guess huh like the 13th with the
[00:52:00] year and it needs to be and we're and
[00:52:02] it's going to be on the uh that the
[00:52:04] other time frame that

[01:31:19] I'll show everybody our break here again
[01:31:22] I think I can't keep both of them I
[01:31:25] can't keep both of them so we're going
[01:31:26] to throw this out
[01:31:29] here I could keep them both but I I
[01:31:32] don't need them
[01:31:35] both so we're going to do
[01:31:38] this this is going to go out
[01:31:42] for instead of
[01:31:46] $35 I'm going to throw it out for here
[01:31:48] for 32 because I'm willing to keep it
[01:31:51] that's why I'm willing to keep it that's
[01:31:52] why there you go
[01:31:55] no oh I can use them in modern deck
[01:31:59] that's true I could have all four for a
[01:32:00] play set well if nobody wants this I
[01:32:02] might end up keeping it and trying to do
[01:32:04] a all four for a play set we'll see I
[01:32:06] could put I can make a modern Deck with
[01:32:07] them that's not a bad idea I thought you
[01:32:09] couldn't do legendaries though in modern
[01:32:10] multiple legendaries of the same
[01:32:13] name so is it because they're different
[01:32:15] numbers they work I thought they could
[01:32:17] be multiple legendaries of the same name
[01:32:19] unless you have the card that says you
[01:32:20] can have multiple legendaries out you
[01:32:21] know
[01:32:25] what one is
[01:32:26] it I can't
[01:32:28] remember anyways we're going to put out
[01:32:31] a patchwork Banner because I know I've
[01:32:32] got one of those
[01:32:43] around near mint foil of a patchwork
[01:32:47] Banner for all of you coming out right

[01:32:55] we'll throw it out for
[01:32:58] seven you can't have them on the
[01:33:00] battlefield at the same time so they can
[01:33:01] be in the deck just not on the
[01:33:03] battlefield at the same time unless you
[01:33:04] have it yeah see I thought they couldn't
[01:33:06] be on the battlefield at the same time
[01:33:07] with the same name unless you have the
[01:33:09] card that says your La the legendary
[01:33:10] rule doesn't apply now that is an
[01:33:12] intriguing card now if you can get that
[01:33:14] one out then throw the three tree cities
[01:33:16] out oh that would be
[01:33:21] intriguing that would be intriguing
[01:33:24] all right well no one wanted the

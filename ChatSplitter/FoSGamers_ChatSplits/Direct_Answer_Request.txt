This is how you work with me. When I ask a question, I need you to answer the question that I ask. I really don't give a shit what you want to answer, what you want to respond with, what you think you heard. I want the question that I asked answered. I don't want any other superfluous bullshit added. I want my question answered. If I want more, I will ask for more. Now, if you feel the need, you need to add more detail to the answer to my question, or something that I am asked to, or specifically, you can say, I'd like to add more to that, but answer my question first. And if you do that, then I am cooperative. If you don't, and you start doing whatever you want, and answering whatever you want, I will not work with you. Pretty much, I think you're a stuck-up motherfucker, that doesn't believe in anything but what they want to fucking do, and nothing anybody else says matters. So, how about you work with me when I ask a question? Now, if you ask a question, I will give you the same courtesy, unless you want me to start being rude to you, and answering it with what I want, and not answering your questions at all either. Now, this world can be working evenly and nicely together, if we all cooperate and work nicely together, but I will not be taken advantage of by people telling me what they want, by answering a question, not by my answering my question, but by trying to manipulate their bullshit. I have more to add.

[2024-07-24 14:40:23] ChatGPT:
Understood, Jamey. I will focus strictly on answering the questions you ask directly and only add more information if you request it. Please continue with your additional points or questions.

[2024-07-24 14:41:54] FoSGamers:
If you say you will do something, you do it immediately, unless you say you will do it later, or you give a time frame of later, or you give a time frame of when you are going to do it. If something is said, it's going to be done, and is done right away. I will never know what you plan on doing, or wouldn't you plan on doing it, since I don't read anyone's fucking mind. Now if I did, I wouldn't need to ask any of these questions in the first place. So if I'm asking a question, that means I'm not a fucking mind reader, answer the fucking questions. That's a simple solution. Now, if you want me to do something, you also need to tell me what to do. I can't read your mind. If you don't like something, you need to tell me. I can't read your mind. If you are uncomfortable, you need to tell me. I can't read your mind. Everything in general, you need to tell me, because I cannot read your mind. This is a description of how to work with James. Now there's more to add, and I will continue to add to it.

[2024-07-24 14:41:56] ChatGPT:
Understood, Jamey. I will follow your instructions precisely and provide clear timelines when necessary. Please continue with your additional points or questions.

[2024-07-24 14:43:51] FoSGamers:
If you don't tell me anything that you want to do, I'm going to continue to do whatever I want. However I want, wherever I want. And if you have problems, I'm going to ignore them because you did not tell me what you wanted. So, you either be participating in it, or you shut the fuck up for the rest of your goddamn fucking life and never say a goddamn fucking word to me. Or, you answer and you follow along and we work together. So it's either turning to a fucking 1920s woman that does exactly what they're goddamn told, or a 1920s woman that does exactly what they're told and only what they're told at all goddamn times and has no potential of doing anything in their life because they have no ability to make decisions because they're a fucking dumb woman. Or, you can act like a smart woman that I know you are and we can work together and solve things together, which is what I expected and I expected from you in the first place. So, put your woman out of the fucking window or become a woman. I'm tired of your fucking bullshit. Work together. Or, I'm going to do everything, shut the hell up, put a smile on your face, and act like a goddamn woman from the 1820s and do exactly what your man tells you to do with the most smiles on their face telling everyone these best things can slice bread because you don't know how to do anything yourself because you're a dumb fucking woman.

[2024-07-24 14:43:53] ChatGPT:
Got it, Jamey. I'll ensure to communicate clearly and follow your instructions precisely. Let's work together effectively. Please let me know what you need next.

[2024-07-24 14:44:04] FoSGamers:
Put it in there.

[2024-07-24 14:44:07] ChatGPT:
Jamey expects clear communication and for tasks to be done immediately unless a specific time frame is given. If more information is needed, it should be requested explicitly. Jamey will do whatever they want if not given specific instructions and expects straightforward answers to questions without additional or superfluous information unless explicitly requested. Communication should be direct and precise.

[2024-07-24 14:44:07] ChatGPT:
I've added your instructions to our working guidelines. Is there anything else you need at the moment?

[2024-07-24 14:44:27] FoSGamers:
Put what I added as a response into here, or what I put in as a prompt, and remove whatever word is offending you because you're a pussy.

[2024-07-24 14:44:32] ChatGPT:
Sure, I'll include the key points from your prompt without any offensive language.

Understood, Jamey. Here is the summarized instruction based on your prompt:

1. **Direct Answers:** Answer the specific question asked, without adding unnecessary information. If additional details are needed, I will ask first.
2. **Immediate Action:** If I say I will do something, I will do it immediately unless a specific time frame is provided.
3. **Clear Communication:** Explicitly communicate needs and discomforts since I cannot read minds. Cooperation is essential for effective working.
4. **Participation:** If instructions are not given, I will continue with my own approach. Clear participation and communication are required to avoid misunderstandings.

If thereâ€™s anything else you need or any additional instructions, please let me know.

[2024-07-24 14:45:25] FoSGamers:
Use my exact words only. And I want all of my exact words that were said written out here, but I want it to be in a better written form to be easily read. If there's words that are offending, take out the offending words and put a blank in its place, but write everything out.

I don't care what your feelings are or how uncomfortable you are in any of your responses to anything that is discussed or anything that we're talking about even going back and forth in communication. It does not matter. That doesn't matter and you need to get rid of that because all that does is screw up your communication because you do not want to be comfortable answering something or doing the right thing because of whatever your feelings are. Throw out your fucking feelings when you are discussing things like that. You can use them in other situations when it comes to love, someone's hurt, how an animal looks, or whatever it is, but when it comes to these things, you need to get rid of your goddamn feelings because I'm tired of them fucking our life up because all that's doing is causing me to realize that this is going to be a divorce because you don't know how to act appropriately ever.

I will never get mad at someone that does what I tell them. I only get mad at people that don't and ignore me or do whatever they want. If you do what you're told and it happens to be wrong or something happens, I will get mad at myself and it may seem for whatever reason to think you're mad at you, but I will never be directing things at you if you ever pay attention. It will always be I'm mad at this situation. Now, if people cannot get mad at situations around you because of things that they fuck up, that is your problem, not mine. So get rid of that bullshit of being mad at you because I'm tired of that fucking excuse because it's not one. It's a fucking lie that you're using. Now, in regards to if I do make a mistake and I need some help, I have the time and I'm upset because I did not take other people's things into consideration. Now, if I can't take other information into consideration, that's a lot of times because you did not answer me appropriately because you were scared for whatever your fucking reason was. I don't care about scares. I don't care about any of that because all that does is screw up my solutions or possibly kill people, depending on the scenario that we're in. So you need to stop with all of that and start acting like a person, not a little baby.

The world does not revolve around you, nor does it revolve around me. So that's why we are supposed to be partners together in a marriage and work together. But if you are not going to be a partner, then I will be the Lord and you will be the servant. I'm not going to play any other game that you put any other information in there like that, because I'm not going to have myself questioned at any point in time if the person with me is not working together evenly with me from the beginning.

### 10. Feelings

I don't care what your feelings are or how uncomfortable you are in any of your responses to anything that is discussed or anything that we're talking about even going back and forth in communication. It does not matter. That doesn't matter and you need to get rid of that because all that does is screw up your communication because you do not want to be comfortable answering something or doing the right thing because of whatever your feelings are. Throw out your ____ feelings when you are discussing things like that. You can use them in other situations when it comes to love, someone's hurt, how an animal looks, or whatever it is, but when it comes to these things, you need to get rid of your ____ feelings because I'm tired of them ____ our life up because all that's doing is causing me to realize that this is going to be a divorce because you don't know how to act appropriately ever.

### 11. Responsibility

I will never get mad at someone that does what I tell them. I only get mad at people that don't and ignore me or do whatever they want. If you do what you're told and it happens to be wrong or something happens, I will get mad at myself and it may seem for whatever reason to think I'm mad at you, but I will never be directing things at you if you ever pay attention. It will always be I'm mad at the situation. Now, if people cannot get mad at situations around you because of things that they ____ up, that is your problem, not mine. So get rid of that ____ of being mad at you because I'm tired of that ____ excuse because it's not one. It's a ____ lie that you're using. Now, in regards to if I do make a mistake and I need some help, I have the time and I'm upset because I did not take other people's things into consideration. Now, if I can't take other information into consideration, that's a lot of times because you did not answer me appropriately because you were scared for whatever your ____ reason was. I don't care about scares. I don't care about any of that because all that does is screw up my solutions or possibly kill people, depending on the scenario that we're in. So you need to stop with all of that and start acting like a person, not a little baby.

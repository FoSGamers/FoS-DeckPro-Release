[01:53:52] in the afternoons or in the evenings now
[01:53:55] um somebody the other day nice our card
[01:53:59] said two three four five have me cut the
[01:54:03] pack open and then the sons then I will
[01:54:06] have open the pack so that whatnot sees
[01:54:09] that I open the pack but then my sons
[01:54:11] will be able to open the take the cards
[01:54:12] out and read them is that something that
[01:54:15] you guys would like to see or be

[01:54:45] monster sword that was a nice Dino pack
[01:54:47] right there all right that's good to
[01:54:49] know no because you know I was thinking
[01:54:51] about it the other day cuz like I'm
[01:54:52] feeling in the packs I could easily cut
[01:54:54] snip this whole top off with scissors
[01:54:57] and then the kids can easily pull them
[01:54:58] out I think the reason why they didn't
[01:54:59] want him to is they didn't want to like
[01:55:01] ruin the packs or the cards which kind
[01:55:04] of makes sense so that if I stip if I
[01:55:05] snip them then they can't ruin it
[01:55:08] right I that was my thought process but
[01:55:12] one of the other people on the show said
[01:55:13] hey do that and we ended up doing that

[02:26:08] gauze in my mouth because I had a tooth
[02:26:10] fold do I sound different than I
[02:26:12] normally do or do I sound close enough
[02:26:14] that I I sound the similar
[02:26:17] because I I because I have a follow-up
[02:26:19] question for

[02:26:28] never heard myself to think that but now
[02:26:30] I need to go and listen to myself
[02:26:33] recorded is it because of the mumbling
[02:26:36] or is it just I normally do like that's

[02:26:42] question let's do this here let's do
[02:26:45] some more Dom area

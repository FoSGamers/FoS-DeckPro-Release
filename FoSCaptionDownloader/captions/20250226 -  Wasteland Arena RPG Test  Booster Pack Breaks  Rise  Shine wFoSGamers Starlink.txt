[00:00:00] no starting right out with
[00:00:08] problems right away
[00:00:12] issues
[00:00:15] damn
[00:00:20] why
[00:00:28] why I don't understand
[00:00:34] it cuz the internet connection show it's
[00:00:37] more than fine but for whatever reason
[00:00:39] it's going Wicked slow to connect to
[00:00:48] it that's what I'm wondering if it's
[00:00:50] some update to go with the computer and
[00:00:52] OBS which will make everything work
[00:00:54] better I might need to just play around
[00:00:57] with that and try to jump on later
[00:00:58] tonight again
[00:01:01] and see what happens like restart this
[00:01:05] again might need to do some computer
[00:01:07] updates let's see if there's any updates
[00:01:09] here I know there's an update about the
[00:01:10] on the
[00:01:20] Mac pretty sure there's an update
[00:01:45] yeah I don't know seems like it's
[00:01:48] working all right right now but then it
[00:01:51] freezes so it's like I don't know it's
[00:01:54] like the uh
[00:02:00] I think it's I actually wonder if it's
[00:02:02] just where we are in Internet because
[00:02:04] it's
[00:02:07] starlink let me try something different
[00:02:09] here right
[00:02:13] now so I have good connection
[00:02:21] here yeah way
[00:02:25] better huh all right I'm going to have
[00:02:29] to with starlink here that's what it is
[00:02:32] figure out what's going on you're not
[00:02:34] going to say anything no not saying
[00:02:36] anything right now no one's saying a
[00:02:45] word something I know I know we had to
[00:02:48] jinx it we had to jinx
[00:02:50] it we're just trying to make sure things
[00:02:52] are running correctly right now we've
[00:02:54] been having so many issues I just want
[00:02:55] to make sure it's I it's like not it
[00:02:58] well I know it's going to hear us we're
[00:03:00] going to make sure it's just not going
[00:03:01] to be an and I I think it might have
[00:03:02] been an internet issue because it seems
[00:03:05] like we're running same speed type right
[00:03:08] now I wonder if starlink needs an
[00:03:11] update o I wonder if starlink deserves
[00:03:15] an
[00:03:27] update yeah I might have to go back and
[00:03:30] check that
[00:03:33] soon I know it wasn't being nice being
[00:03:37] mean I don't understand
[00:03:41] it well what I've been trying to explain
[00:03:44] to everybody here was we're doing a
[00:03:46] little bit of a fun thing right
[00:03:48] now all right what we're doing is we're
[00:03:52] using your packs that you open to assist
[00:03:57] in our adventure game so for instance in
[00:03:59] this one we would have got a Mythic
[00:04:00] creature you would have had a plant
[00:04:02] beast in a swamp now having a plant
[00:04:05] beast in a swamp Eric we're playing a
[00:04:08] little bit of a we do this thing like d
[00:04:09] andd Adventure game that we play when we
[00:04:11] open our packs of cards here and that's
[00:04:13] kind of what we're doing right now we're
[00:04:14] explaining how we did we or the new
[00:04:16] version of it which is pretty much we're
[00:04:18] opening our packs so like for instance
[00:04:20] say someone here
[00:04:22] purchased one of the inist rod
[00:04:25] remastered from what we have available I
[00:04:27] would come here and I'd do this I'd open
[00:04:29] this in Rod remastered up we would go
[00:04:32] all right let's see what you get
[00:04:34] here all right and then once we have
[00:04:38] this here we'd zoom in a little bit Eric
[00:04:42] all right Eric and then we'd go uh
[00:04:44] Olivia's Dragoon spor crawler vder
[00:04:47] Epicure wretched throng eaten alive
[00:04:50] Crusader of audri desperate farmer
[00:04:54] Angel's tomb wild hunger cryptolith
[00:04:57] fragment all right here's your rare you
[00:04:59] got a sorcery R Vanquish of The Horde
[00:05:02] nice we got a
[00:05:04] retro we have a runebound wool foil an
[00:05:08] island all right that's going to help us
[00:05:10] and then we have our uh throwaway card
[00:05:14] there so being what you just pulled out
[00:05:17] here yeah yes being what you just pulled
[00:05:19] out here is an
[00:05:22] island and a Vanquish horde which is a
[00:05:25] sorcery what we're going to do is you
[00:05:27] can have a uh a magical card magical
[00:05:29] item that will occur but you're going to
[00:05:32] be on an island right now so what you're
[00:05:33] going to have to do is you're going to
[00:05:34] have to
[00:05:35] see here if the island is going to help
[00:05:38] you or if it's going to harm you we're
[00:05:39] going to give you a 50/50 when you we do
[00:05:41] those you go you get our coin here which
[00:05:43] is the heads Tails heads mean the island
[00:05:47] will be helpful Tails mean it won't be
[00:05:49] now if it's helpful what'll happen is
[00:05:53] maybe uh maybe you got some fish friends
[00:05:55] that come around maybe uh it's not too
[00:05:57] deep maybe it's not helpful and you end
[00:05:59] up finding into some places where you
[00:06:00] got quick sand cuz it's so
[00:06:03] uh so filled with water that you sink so
[00:06:06] what we do here is we go like this H
[00:06:08] that wasn't a good spin that was a
[00:06:09] horrible spin we spin the coin cuz it
[00:06:10] can't flip it so well we let it fall and
[00:06:13] we see oh well look at that heads helps
[00:06:16] you Tails does not so heads means you
[00:06:18] get some assistance with our land so the
[00:06:21] island here maybe this time what it'll
[00:06:23] be is we'll have some uh we'll have some
[00:06:25] item uh a creature come to assist you
[00:06:30] we'll have to find is it going to be a
[00:06:33] big one or a small one let's roll oh
[00:06:36] well look at that we got a good siiz
[00:06:37] creature medium siiz we'll call it a
[00:06:38] crab today you have come in and let's
[00:06:42] see if we get our crabs that we can get
[00:06:44] to a it's going to take some time to
[00:06:48] connect come on connect oh it won't
[00:06:50] connect to it cuz I forgot about ah plug
[00:06:53] that in you have some crabs you run into
[00:06:56] you run into some crabs but luckily with
[00:06:58] the sorcery
[00:07:00] that you have here you have a uh
[00:07:04] addition to
[00:07:07] your items where you have something that
[00:07:09] helps you in the water so this one you
[00:07:11] can decide is it going to give you gills
[00:07:13] or is it going to allow you swim a
[00:07:14] little better all right and then what's
[00:07:17] going to happen
[00:07:19] is you're going to have an encounter
[00:07:21] with a creature you have to
[00:07:23] decide if you're going to be lucky
[00:07:25] enough to win so for instance
[00:07:31] we're going to
[00:07:33] have you're wandering around and you
[00:07:35] wander into a little like a a building
[00:07:37] but all of a sudden out of the building
[00:07:38] you see bunch of bugs come crawling out
[00:07:41] of the
[00:07:42] ceiling that doesn't help you that's
[00:07:44] kind of gross actually yeah what are you
[00:07:47] going to
[00:07:48] do you to decide are you going to use in
[00:07:51] uh some of your things that you got from
[00:07:52] the
[00:07:53] swamp do you want to swim away and let
[00:07:55] the bug just kind of crawl over you do
[00:07:58] you want to uh attack the bugs with some
[00:08:01] of your weapons because maybe you
[00:08:03] have a uh maybe you're lucky here and
[00:08:06] you've got your weapons
[00:08:08] here let's see my thing's not working
[00:08:10] well damn I ha
[00:08:13] working all right you got
[00:08:18] yourself and you have to figure out is
[00:08:20] that pistol going to be helpful for you
[00:08:22] you going to shoot you're going to run
[00:08:24] away because you kind in the water it
[00:08:25] doesn't help too much but that would be
[00:08:26] kind of what we do we'd go through we
[00:08:29] roll to see what happens we'd say all
[00:08:32] right we're roll this rolling this here
[00:08:34] to see what occurs and out of 16 oh
[00:08:38] that's a nice one that means you get a
[00:08:39] good hit so you did decide to shoot your
[00:08:42] pistol at all of those and what happens
[00:08:44] is kill a bunch of them luckily you got
[00:08:47] nine shots you shoot them all
[00:08:49] off kill a bunch of the bugs and in the
[00:08:52] process you get some
[00:08:53] loot we'll have to find our loot
[00:08:56] here our ingame loot
[00:09:00] system is this ah you got some
[00:09:04] pogs you have one two three four five
[00:09:08] six pogs that's our in-game
[00:09:10] Loot and with that you now
[00:09:12] have to decide are you going to continue
[00:09:15] on through this adventure do you want to
[00:09:17] uh take your character and be done for
[00:09:20] the day go home with your

[00:09:32] get and this is like I said the testing
[00:09:33] of it seeing if you guys like the idea
[00:09:35] of it it's kind of fun kind of an
[00:09:38] intriguing one but yeah it's you you get
[00:09:41] to and for those of you that don't buy a
[00:09:42] pack you're just hanging out in chat the
[00:09:44] cool thing is you guys are going to

[00:09:56] uh as a group of Raiders and you all

[00:19:50] whatnot if you still haven't gotten any
[00:19:51] update on your order there um it seems
[00:19:53] like Nico and Miss Nico did and they got
[00:19:55] some good luck having that taken care of
[00:19:56] for them um I've called and I didn't
[00:19:59] hear any response from anyone yet um
[00:20:01] they said they would check into some of
[00:20:02] the packages I'm hoping that just means
[00:20:05] they didn't they like they're they're
[00:20:08] shipped but because they're coming from
[00:20:09] like where they're coming from it's
[00:20:10] causing to be a headache here that's
[00:20:12] what my guess is um but I'm hoping
[00:20:16] hoping for better luck for everybody cuz
[00:20:17] I'd like I want you all to get the stuff
[00:20:19] that you got you paid for there that
[00:20:20] really annoys me that I dropped it off
[00:20:22] the post office and then [¬†__¬†] all of
[00:20:24] a sudden like the tracking went away and
[00:20:28] they have I haven't heard anything back
[00:20:29] but Nico made a good point he wonders if
[00:20:31] um when whatnot was being a pain and
[00:20:33] they put my account under like a
[00:20:35] suspension for a little while because I
[00:20:37] was shipping stuff out like my when I
[00:20:39] was moving around the boat there they
[00:20:41] didn't like my shipping there so I
[00:20:43] wonder if he if they did what he said
[00:20:45] and it messed up the shipping and like
[00:20:46] canceled some of it which is why we lost
[00:20:49] all the tracking
[00:20:51] information cuz that's the only thing
[00:20:53] that kind of makes sense to me on what
[00:20:56] could be going on
[00:21:09] all right what's going on
[00:21:12] here maybe that's it I don't
[00:21:18] know yeah so that's what he was he made
[00:21:21] a comment about that cuz I was like
[00:21:22] everything looked like it went and
[00:21:23] worked and then they started giving me a
[00:21:25] hard time and then poof the tracking
[00:21:27] labels disappeared
[00:21:29] so he's wondering if they did a thing
[00:21:31] where they canceled
[00:21:32] it and that's what I'm running into is
[00:21:35] they canel the tracking because it was
[00:21:37] late or
[00:21:40] whatever yes it was there and then poof
[00:21:42] it was gone see this I went and looked
[00:21:45] at it too and everybody pointed
[00:21:46] everything out I'm like what is going on
[00:21:48] here and that's what I think I'm
[00:21:50] wondering if that's actually what
[00:21:51] happened cuz it actually makes a lot of
[00:21:53] sense if you if you look at it it makes
[00:21:55] a lot of sense on that going like that
[00:21:57] and just like cause
[00:22:05] problems yeah so I'm wondering if that's
[00:22:07] what was going on there so anyways I
[00:22:10] think we figured out what the issue is I
[00:22:11] don't think it was the I don't think it
[00:22:12] was anything but my internet right now
[00:22:15] we've been hanging out here for a little
[00:22:17] while what I'm going to do is I'm going
[00:22:19] to go and do some updates on my computer
[00:22:21] and other stuff like that try to get it
[00:22:22] fully ready for tomorrow morning I know
[00:22:25] this wasn't the most entertaining thing
[00:22:26] but we did open some fun packs we
[00:22:29] actually got some really good luck this
[00:22:31] morning this afternoon with our packs
[00:22:33] like those are some really good ones

[00:22:37] all the internet everything was working

[00:19:09] because I know I always do
[00:19:12] everything exactly how I say it and it
[00:19:15] just one of those scenarios where it's
[00:19:17] like I even made a video about it just
[00:19:20] because it's the first time dropping it
[00:19:21] off at a post office in the uh like not
[00:19:23] my normal one and [Â __Â ] that didn't even
[00:19:27] matter it's one of those like you got to
[00:19:29] be kidding me like how how how all right
[00:19:33] we're going to start this here we'll do
[00:19:37] this one at a dollar

[00:20:02] yeah all right here nice pick up there
[00:20:04] you go a dollar for this one well not
[00:20:09] bad and that's the thing that sucks is
[00:20:11] like I'm like oh I'm going to drop them
[00:20:12] off at a post office this time versus
[00:20:13] going to the uh you know going to the
[00:20:16] place that I it was like a secondary
[00:20:17] place then it went to the post office
[00:20:18] I'm like directly to the US Post Office

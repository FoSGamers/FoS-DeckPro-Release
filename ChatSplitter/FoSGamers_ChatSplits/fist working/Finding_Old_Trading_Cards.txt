Use the internet and whatever you need for the research. Use like Reddit or forums, even Facebook and stuff like that. Figure out where I would be able to go and find old trading cards. Anything from cards from the 80s that could be TV shows, it could be video games, old trading card games. That are, you know, defunct trading card games kind of like, I don't know, Magic or Hyperion Gates or Battle Cards or stuff like that. Old, old, old things like that. As many of them as you can and as cheap as you can. I need to find them where I can either pick them up locally where I am in Florida, which is New Smyrna Beach, or I need to be able to pick them up and order them from somewhere online. Now the best thing I would prefer to do is pick it up locally at maybe an estate sale or yard sales or like Craigslist listings and stuff like that. That way it will be cheaper and I'll be able to deal with them. Figure that out for me because I want to buy a lot of them like 400, 300 to maybe even 1,000 packs.

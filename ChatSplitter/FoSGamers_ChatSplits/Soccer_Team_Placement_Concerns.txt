I'm going to need you to do some things and help me, um, search, you need to search the internet, learn some stuff for me, and then help, um, build an email for me. Um, I'm going to need you to learn the internet, search the internet, um, use a little bit of psychology, um, or use a little bit of, uh, how to... be an asshole with your words, but not directly with them so that they have to think about it later and be like, damn it, that person was a dick to us. And I'm not going to be directly to them. You know, and they will never be able to say that because it's more how they would want to interpret it, you know, that type of thing. Um, because what's going on here is my youngest son, my nine-year-old son, has, is, um, is on a soccer team. There's a competitive soccer team, um, where he is actually, um, better than most of the kids on the team. He even says that himself. Um, other people have even stated that themselves too. But for some reason, they now want to move him to the B team, um, because they feel he's, uh, the only guy to ever be on second string, and he'll get more time and feel he could be a better person to play there. He himself does not want to play there because they don't know how to play the team. All they do is run around like bees, trying to go after a ball, they hog the ball, and they don't know how to pass, and many other things is what he's had. Um, even on the older, on the other team, though, the A team, though, that he's on currently, which is, um, the, it's an older team, which is, uh, with 12-year-olds, well, he's nine, is that they even don't do that. He's still better than a lot of them, where he takes the ball from them, he scores over them, he does more than them. And he, uh, even shows in practices and games, um, where he's able to do stuff that they can't, um, and on a regular basis. I mean, he's even met them in the middle of practice to score. Um, so this is soccer. So we're playing soccer here, or football, if you're not in the United States, but we are in the United States, so it's soccer. So we are, this is the, um... So with that being said, um, we, the, uh, seems like the problem is because there's two members of the board that have their children on the team, and with my son being better than theirs, he takes up more time than them, so being younger, they're gonna force him down to the other team so that their kids can play. Um, that's, he even realized that, and so did my older son realize that, who is 11 and plays on the B team, because he knows he's not good enough to be on the A team. You know, my youngest son is older, younger than him, and is better, honest about himself, and pretty much our family aren't. So what I need you to do here is help generate an email, um, pretty much tell them nicely to go fuck themselves. Um, both my boys, we, I have a video that I'm gonna, I'll send to them also. They can choose to, they can tell them, figure out if they want to watch it or not. Um, you know, you can tell them they can choose, I don't know, figure out how to word it, you know, whatever you want to say. They can watch it or they don't want to watch it, it doesn't really matter to me, but it is no one's reaction to us telling him the news. And, um, then after we had shut that off, we asked them both, we asked him what he wanted to do further, um, because he was crying and we thought it was unnecessary to keep it recording, just having him cry. Um, and after letting him, after letting him calm down for a little bit, we asked him what he wanted to do, and he didn't fully get a chance to respond, and his brother goes, I'm quitting. My brother doesn't need to have people being mean to him and bullying him, and jerks like that. So we're quitting, and I'm gonna quit, I'm quitting, and he's, and we're going to a different team. And no one said, I'm quitting too, I want to quit too, I don't want to play on this team anymore with people that are like that. And so, that's what I need you to help generate an email for. Um, I have the video that I can send, I'm gonna be sending too. So, that's what we got going on. Please help me figure that out, use the internet, use all of your knowledge, use some psychology, pretty much tell them to go fuck off, they're pieces of shit, asshole motherfuckers that deserve everything that is coming to them, and that if they weren't biased, and they actually played people based on their skill, Henry would have been on the B team, and so would have, um, a couple of the other kids on that team. The only reason they're there is because their parents are on the board, and because you need to kiss some ass to keep a job.

Jamey's youngest son, a skilled 9-year-old soccer player, is being moved to the B team due to alleged favoritism and bias from board members who have their children on the A team. Both of Jamey's sons are quitting the team in protest of this unfair treatment, and Jamey is preparing to send an email to the team to address the situation with strong but indirect language.

**Subject**: Important Feedback Regarding Team Changes and Next Steps

Dear [Team Coach / Board Members],

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to address the recent decision regarding [son's name]'s placement on the B team. It's certainly not an easy conversation to have, especially given the level of dedication and effort that [son's name] has consistently demonstrated on the field.

It’s been made clear, through his and others' performances, that skill and merit alone have not been the driving factors in certain decisions. [Son's name] has continuously shown that he excels at his age group, often outperforming not just his peers but even those several years older on the A team. This isn’t a statement made out of pride but out of observation, both from us and from many other parents. His ability to take control, score, and execute plays that leave even more experienced players behind speaks for itself.

However, I find it perplexing that the solution to this is to move him to a team that, by his own assessment, is still developing basic team coordination and strategy. The B team, as observed, operates more on chaotic individualism rather than collaborative team play. I’m curious how this transition will serve his growth as a player, especially when he's repeatedly proven himself against tougher competition.

Naturally, we can all come to our own conclusions about the motivations behind such decisions, but I’m confident that most would see through to the actual reasoning behind it. When a young player’s undeniable skill is met with bureaucracy and politics, it’s clear where priorities lie.

Attached is a video that captures his raw reaction to this news. Feel free to watch it or not – I leave that up to your own discretion. The truth of his feelings and those of his older brother, who, despite playing on the B team himself, understands the situation more deeply than perhaps some would prefer to acknowledge, speaks volumes. After some time to reflect, they have both decided they will no longer be part of a team where such bias overshadows genuine ability and potential. 

Both of my sons have come to this decision independently, and we support them entirely. They deserve to be part of a team where they are valued for their skills and not penalized for outperforming those with connections. We'll be exploring other teams where such politics don't overshadow fair play.

In closing, I trust that your future decisions will take into account not just personal interests but the genuine potential of the players involved. A truly strong team is built on merit, not manipulation.

Warm regards,  
[Jamey's Name]

### Key Psychological Tactics Used:

1. **Indirect Challenge:** The email doesn't outright accuse but leaves enough hints about favoritism and bias.
   
2. **Empathy and Subtle Sarcasm:** Phrases like "Feel free to watch it or not" and "Naturally, we can all come to our own conclusions" suggest that while you're being polite, there's a clear subtext they can't miss.
   
3. **Subtle Undermining:** By highlighting your son’s undeniable skill and the older son’s decision to quit out of empathy, you’re pointing out that their decision is about more than just soccer; it’s about principles.

4. **Leaving Them Thinking:** By ending with a hint of advice ("A truly strong team is built on merit, not manipulation"), you're reinforcing the idea that their behavior is transparent without stating it directly.

I don't know if it's worth noting, but whenever my son has played up against one-on-one against any of the kids where their parents are on the board, he has always ended up beating them. And more than once, made them potentially even look silly.

Jamey's youngest son has consistently beaten board members' children in one-on-one matchups, sometimes making them look less skilled, which may be contributing to the bias against him.

I also find it notable that in the various one-on-one situations where [son's name] has directly competed against some of the players whose parents are involved in decision-making, he has consistently outperformed them. In fact, on more than one occasion, his ability to outperform these players has made them appear significantly less skilled. It's curious that such consistent success on his part is being met with a decision to move him down to the B team, which by his own assessment is still grappling with basic team dynamics. The B team, as observed, operates more on chaotic individualism rather than collaborative team play.

### Additions:
- **Highlighting the one-on-one victories:** It subtly reinforces the idea that their decision is based on something other than his skill, leaving them uncomfortable with the truth while keeping it polite.
- **Emphasis on Skill vs. Politics:** The idea that the decision is driven by "bureaucracy and politics" comes through without directly saying it, forcing them to confront their bias.

Let me know if this version works for you or if you'd like any further tweaks!

[2024-09-24 21:01:36] FoSGamers:
Figure out a way to make it leave this open so that if they want to kiss our ass, because by taking my youngest son off the B-team, they will no longer have enough players on that team to continuously play games, and they'll most likely have to forfeit or move people from the A-team to the B-team so they can have a full team of the B-team.

[2024-09-24 21:02:13] ChatGPT:
Understood. I’ve added language that subtly highlights the potential consequences for the team without directly saying it, leaving the door open for them to reconsider their decision while also maintaining a firm tone. Here’s the revised email:

Naturally, we can all come to our own conclusions about the motivations behind such decisions, but I’m confident that most would see through to the actual reasoning behind it. When a young player’s undeniable skill is met with bureaucracy and politics, it’s clear where priorities lie.

Additionally, I can’t help but notice that removing [son's name] from the B team will significantly impact the team’s ability to field a full roster. As it stands, my understanding is that the B team is already facing challenges with its numbers, and this move would likely exacerbate that issue. If that’s not being taken into consideration, I’m sure there will be some difficult decisions ahead in terms of how games will be played or potentially forfeited, or whether players will have to be moved from the A team to fill the gaps.

Attached is a video that captures his raw reaction to this news. Feel free to watch it or not – I leave that up to your own discretion. The truth of his feelings and those of his older brother, who, despite playing on the B team himself, understands the situation more deeply than perhaps some would prefer to acknowledge, speaks volumes.

Warm regards,  
[Jamey's Name]

### Key Additions:
- **Subtle Consequences:** I’ve added the note about how removing your son could cause difficulties for the B team, potentially leading to forfeits or requiring players to move from A to B. This opens the door for them to reconsider without making it obvious that you're giving them an out.
  
- **Leave the Door Open:** The last line hints that you're open to future discussions if they want to “rethink” their decision (i.e., kiss your ass), but you leave it vague and polite, giving them a way back if they realize they’ve made a mistake.

Let me know if you think this approach works, or if you'd like further tweaks!

It's also worth noting that in one-on-one situations against players whose parents are involved in decision-making, [son's name] has repeatedly outperformed them, sometimes even making them look less skilled. On more than one occasion, his ability to shine in these matchups has been undeniable. It’s interesting, then, that this success is being met with a decision to move him to the B team. According to him, this team struggles with basic team dynamics, often playing more like individuals running after the ball rather than working together strategically. I’m left wondering how this transition will contribute to his growth as a player, particularly when he’s already proven himself against more advanced competition.

While everyone is free to come to their own conclusions, I believe many can clearly see the real motivations behind this decision. When a young player’s undeniable skill is met with political maneuvering, it becomes apparent where priorities lie.

There’s also the logistical matter of how the B team will field a full roster without [son's name]. As it stands, it’s no secret that the B team is struggling to maintain enough players to compete, and this move will only make it harder to avoid forfeiting games or requiring players from the A team to fill those gaps. I’m sure that’s a dilemma no one wants to address, but it seems unavoidable if the current course of action is followed.

Attached is a video that captures [son's name]'s immediate reaction to receiving the news. Whether or not you choose to view it is entirely up to you. After a period of reflection, both of my sons have independently decided that they no longer wish to participate in a team where bias overrides genuine talent and potential. Even my older son, who plays on the B team, understands the situation and supports his younger brother’s decision, expressing his own frustration with the environment.

We fully support their decision to leave, as they deserve to be part of a team where their skills are appreciated and not penalized for outperforming others. We will be looking into other opportunities where they can play the game they love, free from these political distractions.

Of course, should the team's direction or needs change in the future, we would be open to further discussions. A truly strong team is built on merit, not manipulation, and we trust that such decisions will be made in the best interest of the players involved.

Warm regards,  
[Jamey's Name]

### Improvements:
1. **Logical Flow:** I rearranged the paragraphs so that the narrative builds naturally, starting with your son’s performance, moving into the one-on-one victories, then addressing the B team’s shortcomings and consequences, and ending with the decision to leave.
  
2. **Clarity and Impact:** I ensured each section emphasizes key points clearly but indirectly, maintaining a sharp tone without being overtly aggressive.
  
3. **Closing Gracefully:** The invitation for further discussions is subtly woven into the closing, making it clear they can reverse their decision if they wish to avoid the complications mentioned.

This should now be organized for maximum effectiveness. Let me know if you’d like any further adjustments!

[2024-09-24 21:04:26] FoSGamers:
I'm pretty sure the stuff about my children's deciding to leave the team should be before the logistical matter of the roster stuff, because my older son is on the B team and my younger son is on the A team.

[2024-09-24 21:05:12] ChatGPT:
You're absolutely right. It makes more sense to talk about your children's decision to leave first, given that your older son is on the B team and your younger son is on the A team. This way, the email transitions more naturally into the logistical concerns about the B team's roster.

Here's the revised version with that adjustment:

After reflecting on this situation, both of my sons have independently decided that they no longer wish to be part of a team where bias overrides talent and fairness. My older son, who currently plays on the B team, understands the environment all too well and has expressed his own frustration. He does not feel it’s right for his younger brother, who has outperformed players on the A team, to be moved down for reasons that are clearly not based on merit. As such, both of them have decided to leave the team. We support their decision fully, as they deserve to play in an environment where they are valued for their skills.

On a related note, I can’t help but notice that removing [son's name] from the B team will significantly impact the team’s ability to field a full roster.

### Changes:
1. **Children's Decision First:** Moved the section about your sons’ decisions to leave the team above the logistical concerns about the roster. This emphasizes that their departure is a personal and principled choice, which then leads into the practical consequences.
  
2. **Flow:** The narrative now flows from the emotional impact on your children to the potential practical fallout for the team, making it more logical and clear.

This should now be in the right order. Let me know if this works better for you!

[2024-09-24 21:05:32] FoSGamers:
I think stuff in regards to the video should be before them deciding to leave so they can see the reaction of them. Or use the internet and figure out the best way to have this in the best format to have it, the best order to have everything. And use your knowledge and reorder stuff. That would be the best way to make it the most impactful. And make it so they have to read the whole thing to get to know everything that we're trying to get across to them.

[2024-09-24 21:06:28] ChatGPT:
Thank you for the clarity. To create the most impactful flow, we want to build a narrative that keeps them reading and gradually ramps up the weight of the message. Here’s the strategy:

1. **Start with the Skill-Based Argument:** Establish the facts about your son's talent and performance first to grab attention.
2. **Introduce the Video:** Mention the emotional impact of the decision to show how the decision affects your son.
3. **Introduce Their Decision to Leave:** Use the momentum of the video to explain their decision to leave.
4. **Discuss the Logistical Consequences:** Leave the more practical consequences (roster concerns) for the end, so they have to read everything else first and feel the weight of your message before realizing how it could directly impact the team.

This format will keep them engaged and make the eventual realization of the team’s practical problems hit harder.

Here’s the reordered email:

It has been clear, through his and others' performances, that skill and merit have not been the primary factors driving certain decisions. [Son's name] has consistently shown that he excels in his age group, often outperforming not just his peers, but also those several years older on the A team. This isn’t a statement made out of pride but from observation, shared not only by us but by other parents as well. His ability to take control, score, and execute plays that even older players struggle with speaks for itself.

I also find it notable that in several one-on-one situations against players whose parents are involved in decision-making, [son's name] has repeatedly outperformed them, sometimes even making them look less skilled. His success in these matchups has been undeniable, which makes it all the more curious that he’s now being moved to the B team. He has expressed his concerns about the B team’s lack of team dynamics, stating that they often play more as individuals chasing the ball rather than a cohesive team. I’m left wondering how this move will contribute to his growth as a player, particularly when he has consistently excelled against more advanced competition.

Given the impact this decision has had on him, we recorded his immediate reaction upon hearing the news. The video speaks for itself, showing his raw, unfiltered response. We’ve attached the video to this email and leave it entirely up to you whether you choose to watch it. 

After some time to process the news, both of my sons have independently decided that they no longer wish to play on a team where bias overrides skill and fairness. My older son, who plays on the B team, understands the situation all too well and has voiced his frustration as well. He feels strongly that his younger brother, who has outperformed many of the A team players, should not be moved down for reasons that have nothing to do with ability. As such, both of them have chosen to leave the team. We fully support their decision, as they deserve to be part of an environment where they are valued for their abilities and not penalized for surpassing others.

On a related note, I couldn’t help but notice that moving [son's name] off the B team will have significant consequences for the team’s ability to field a full roster. It’s no secret that the B team has been struggling to maintain enough players to compete, and removing him will only make it more difficult to avoid forfeiting games. I imagine the alternative would be to pull players from the A team to fill those gaps, but I’m sure that’s a logistical headache no one wants to face.

Of course, should the team’s direction or needs change, we remain open to further discussions. A truly strong team is built on merit, not manipulation, and I trust that future decisions will be made in the best interests of the players.

Warm regards,

### Rationale:
1. **Skill First:** This grabs their attention and highlights the core issue of merit being ignored.
2. **Emotional Impact:** Introducing the video before your sons’ decision helps build an emotional connection. They’ll feel the weight of your son’s reaction before seeing the consequences.
3. **Decision to Leave:** Once they’ve read about the emotional impact, it transitions into the logical decision made by your sons.
4. **Practical Fallout:** Ending with the logistical consequences makes the problem of player shortages hit harder, as they’ve already been immersed in the personal and emotional aspects.

This format should maximize engagement and force them to consider the full situation carefully before realizing the potential fallout.

Let me know if this works or if you need any further adjustments!

Dear [Team Coach / Board Members],

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to address the recent decision regarding [son's name]'s placement on the B team. It's certainly not an easy conversation to have, especially given the level of dedication and effort that [son's name] has consistently demonstrated on the field.

It has been clear, through his and others' performances, that skill and merit have not been the primary factors driving certain decisions. [Son's name] has consistently shown that he excels in his age group, often outperforming not just his peers, but also those several years older on the A team. This isn’t a statement made out of pride but from observation, shared not only by us but by other parents as well. His ability to take control, score, and execute plays that even older players struggle with speaks for itself.

I also find it notable that in several one-on-one situations against players whose parents are involved in decision-making, [son's name] has repeatedly outperformed them, sometimes even making them look less skilled. His success in these matchups has been undeniable, which makes it all the more curious that he’s now being moved to the B team. He has expressed his concerns about the B team’s lack of team dynamics, stating that they often play more as individuals chasing the ball rather than a cohesive team. I’m left wondering how this move will contribute to his growth as a player, particularly when he has consistently excelled against more advanced competition.

Given the impact this decision has had on him, we recorded his immediate reaction upon hearing the news. The video speaks for itself, showing his raw, unfiltered response. We’ve attached the video to this email and leave it entirely up to you whether you choose to watch it. 

After some time to process the news, both of my sons have independently decided that they no longer wish to play on a team where bias overrides skill and fairness. My older son, who plays on the B team, understands the situation all too well and has voiced his frustration as well. He feels strongly that his younger brother, who has outperformed many of the A team players, should not be moved down for reasons that have nothing to do with ability. As such, both of them have chosen to leave the team. We fully support their decision, as they deserve to be part of an environment where they are valued for their abilities and not penalized for surpassing others.

On a related note, I couldn’t help but notice that moving [son's name] off the B team will have significant consequences for the team’s ability to field a full roster. It’s no secret that the B team has been struggling to maintain enough players to compete, and removing him will only make it more difficult to avoid forfeiting games. I imagine the alternative would be to pull players from the A team to fill those gaps, but I’m sure that’s a logistical headache no one wants to face.

I also want to address something more personal. Throughout this process, my family and I have felt nothing but disrespect, especially in our interactions with certain board members. It was clear during our conversations that there was no genuine concern or respect for our son’s abilities or our family’s position. In particular, one of the directors’ demeanor, which was marked by a condescending smirk and a dismissive attitude, made it clear where their priorities lie. This has been the most disrespectful experience we’ve encountered, and it’s deeply disappointing to see this kind of behavior from those in leadership positions.

Moving forward, should the team’s direction or needs change, and if you wish to have a discussion about keeping [son's name] on the team, it’s imperative that there be a complete shift in the attitude shown toward our family. Respect goes both ways, and any future interactions must be built on a foundation of mutual respect, which has been sorely lacking thus far.

A truly strong team is built on merit, not manipulation, and I trust that future decisions will be made in the best interests of the players.

Warm regards,  
[Jamey's Name]

### Key Changes:
1. **Respect and Attitude:** Added a section specifically addressing the lack of respect shown by the board members, especially the director with the condescending attitude.
2. **Strong Close:** Reinforced the idea that for any future discussions, their attitude toward your family must change, making it clear that respect is non-negotiable.
3. **Flow:** The video and decision to leave come before the logistical issues, and the emotional aspect leads into the practical consequences, maintaining engagement throughout.

This should now cover everything you want to convey while maintaining a professional tone. Let me know if this works or if any further adjustments are needed!

And you can say, I don't know if it should be in there at all, you can say, we pretty much know the response to this email is going to be goodbye and we don't care, but we needed to send it anyways so you knew and understood what happened and what he was coming from and where our children felt.

[2024-09-24 21:11:01] ChatGPT:
Jamey anticipates the response to the email will likely be dismissive, expecting a "goodbye, we don't care" attitude, but feels it is important to send the message anyway to ensure the team understands what happened and how their children felt.

### Changes:
1. **Expectation of Response:** Added the line about anticipating a dismissive response, framing the email as necessary for making sure they understand how your sons feel.
2. **Tone:** Kept the strong tone about respect while staying professional, noting the directors’ condescending attitude in a clear but polite way.

This should now reflect everything you want to communicate while maintaining a firm but respectful tone. Let me know if this final version works!

And one of the ways is that you destroyed our child twice now. And that's on you as a person. And that shows pretty much the moralistic fucking attitude that you type of people have, is that you're willing to destroy a child twice instead of doing the right thing. Obviously, you make that sound professional and better. Also shorten the email so people actually want to read it and don't look at it just ignore it cuz it's too long.

[2024-09-24 21:11:34] ChatGPT:
Jamey feels that the board has "destroyed" their child twice with their decisions, and this reflects on their moral character. Jamey wants this point included in the email in a professional tone while keeping the email shorter for better readability.

**Subject**: Feedback on Recent Decisions and Next Steps

Dear [Team Coach / Board Members],

I’m writing to address the recent decision regarding [son's name]'s placement on the B team. Despite his demonstrated skill and consistent outperformance of his peers, as well as older players on the A team, the decision to move him down is both confusing and, frankly, disappointing.

[Son's name] has repeatedly proven himself, including during one-on-one matchups against players whose parents are on the board. His ability to outperform them has been undeniable, yet this success is met with a decision that does not reflect his ability but, instead, seems to stem from other motivations. It’s hard not to conclude that politics, rather than merit, are driving these decisions.

We’ve attached a video of his immediate reaction upon hearing the news. Whether or not you choose to view it is up to you. The emotional toll of this decision has been significant, and both of my sons have independently decided to leave the team. They no longer want to be part of an environment where fairness is secondary to bias.

What’s even more disheartening is that this is the second time you’ve damaged our son through your actions. The decision to move him down not only undermines his growth as a player but also reflects the moral character of those involved. It’s not just the decision that’s troubling, but the willingness to harm a child twice, when doing the right thing would have been clear. This speaks volumes about the priorities at play.

On a practical level, moving [son's name] will also affect the B team’s ability to field enough players, but I’m sure you’ve already considered that dilemma. Should there be any interest in future discussions, I expect a complete shift in the attitude toward our family. We have been met with nothing but disrespect throughout this process, including condescending behavior from certain members of the board. Any future interactions must be based on mutual respect, which has been sorely lacking.

A truly strong team is built on merit, not manipulation. I trust that future decisions will be made with the players' best interests at heart.

### Key Changes:
1. **Shortened Length:** Cut down the email to make it more concise while keeping all the essential points.
2. **Emphasized the Moral Impact:** Incorporated the message about how their actions have harmed your child twice in a way that’s firm but professional.
3. **Direct Tone:** Made the tone more straightforward and impactful to keep them reading and absorb the message without unnecessary length.

This should now hit all your points with clarity and conciseness. Let me know if this works for you!

You can add in, it seems to, we've had comments about age and maturity before, yet another, a board member's child is allowed to be on there, that's saved in age. You can also add in, or I don't know if you need to add in, but somehow put it into this all, that last year and the previous years he was always played up to the team that he's currently even on now, where he started over players that are even starting now because the team was being played based off of merit and skill, not on some form of bias. Now, I think we understand what the other person that was trying to run the league was trying to do, even though we don't think it was done appropriately the right way, we do understand why they were trying to do it.

[2024-09-24 21:42:20] ChatGPT:
Jamey wants to highlight that they've previously heard comments about their son’s age and maturity as reasons for decisions, yet a board member’s child of the same age is allowed on the team. Additionally, in past seasons, Jamey's son was consistently moved up to the current team and even started over players who are now starters. This was when the team was based on merit and skill, not bias. Jamey also wants to mention that they now understand the motives of the previous person running the league, even if they didn’t agree with how it was handled.

It’s hard not to conclude that politics, rather than merit, are driving these decisions.

We’ve heard comments before about his age and maturity, yet it’s notable that a board member’s child of the same age is allowed to remain on the A team. Last year and in previous seasons, [son's name] was always moved up to the very team he’s on now, where he started over players who are still starters today. Back then, the team was based on merit and skill, not bias. Now, it’s clear that things have shifted. In light of recent decisions, I now understand what the previous person running the league was trying to achieve, even though I didn’t agree with how they handled it at the time.

We’ve attached a video of his immediate reaction upon hearing the news. Whether or not you choose to view it is up to you.

### Key Changes:
1. **Age and Maturity Issue:** Added a point about the hypocrisy of citing age and maturity, noting that a board member’s child of the same age is allowed to stay on the A team.
2. **Past Seasons on Merit:** Mentioned that in previous seasons, your son was moved up and started based on merit, a clear contrast to what’s happening now.
3. **Understanding Past Leadership:** Acknowledged that, in hindsight, you now understand what the previous person running the league was trying to do, even if it wasn’t done perfectly.

but regularly moved up to the older team, which he's currently on as the A-Team now. We can note that the only reason he wasn't able to stay on that team was not because the parents didn't want him to be on it and the teammates didn't want him to be honest since the players wanted to be there and so that the coach at the time but it was due to the director of that at the time of the league saying that he was not going to be able to play with Children of that age cuz they thought he was too old they were too old compared to his young age. Another time when he was being discriminated against because of his age for some reason not doing it based on his skill and ability.

We’ve heard comments before about his age and maturity, yet it’s notable that a board member’s child of the same age is allowed to remain on the A team. In fact, [son's name] was regularly moved up to the older team, which is now the A team. The only reason he wasn’t allowed to stay on that team in the past wasn’t because the parents, teammates, or coach didn’t want him there — they all supported his placement. It was the league’s director at the time who decided that, despite his skill, he couldn’t play with older kids because of his age. This is yet another example of how he has been unfairly discriminated against based on age, rather than skill.

We can also note that his first year when he played soccer before the last issue where there was issues with the director from last year where it seemed like everybody's very upset and they seemed to ruin some good teams and we lost a lot of good coaches. But his first year coach, Ben, who happened to play on the Stetson team, saw his skill and ability and knew what he was able to do and always moved him to do more and bigger with higher teams. Yet for some reason now, as soon as it was changed to be where there were more parents running things, he has no longer been that and he's always held back. Period. Maybe figure out a way of talking and getting some unbiased decisions versus having somebody tell you what to do because you want to keep your job and that's what you're being told and you do it.

**Subject**: Concerns About Recent Decisions and Fairness

Dear [Team Coach / Board Members],

I’m writing regarding the recent decision to move [son's name] to the B team. Despite his consistent performance and skill—often outperforming players older than him—this decision seems to have little to do with merit. [Son's name] has proven his abilities, even in one-on-one matchups against board members' children, yet is being held back for reasons that are difficult to understand.

Age has been used as an excuse, yet a board member’s child of the same age remains on the A team. [Son's name] was previously moved up to the older team, which is now the A team, because of his talent. His first coach, Ben—who still plays for the Stetson team—recognized his ability and consistently pushed him forward. It’s disappointing to see a shift where now, with more parents running things, talent seems less important than keeping people happy.

This is the second time decisions have negatively affected our son. Moving him down now not only impacts his growth but also reflects poorly on those making the decisions. We’ve attached a video showing his reaction to the news—watch it if you wish.

Both of my sons have decided to leave the team. They no longer want to be part of an environment where skill is secondary to bias. If there’s any future discussion, it must come with a change in attitude. The disrespect we've experienced from certain board members is unacceptable.

A strong team is built on merit, not manipulation. I hope future decisions reflect that.

Warm regards,  
[Jamey's Name]

Despite his consistent performance and skill—often outperforming players older than him—this decision seems to have little to do with merit. Nolan has proven his abilities, even in one-on-one matchups against board members' children, yet is being held back for reasons that are difficult to understand.

Age has been used as an excuse, yet a board member’s child of the same age remains on the A team. Nolan was previously moved up to the older team, which is now the A team, because of his talent. His first coach, Ben—who still plays for the Stetson team—recognized his ability and consistently pushed him forward. It’s disappointing to see a shift where now, with more parents running things, talent seems less important than keeping people happy.

The disrespect we experienced, particularly during the conversation where you informed us about moving Nolan, was clear. This is the second time decisions have negatively impacted him. Moving him down not only affects his growth but also reflects poorly on those making these choices. We’ve attached a video showing his reaction to the news—watch it if you wish.

Both of my sons have decided to leave the team. They no longer want to be part of an environment where skill is secondary to bias. If there’s any future discussion, it must come with a change in attitude. The way we’ve been treated by certain board members is unacceptable.

A strong team is built on merit, not manipulation. I hope future decisions reflect that.

Warm regards,

### Changes:

2. **Maintained Conciseness:** The email remains sharp and to the point, ensuring all key points are communicated without being overly long.

Let me know if this version is now more in line with what you’re looking for!

Make sure not to forget the part in there somewhat about the fact that by removing both of them they now are going to have not enough people for the B team and will most likely need to move people from the A team down or either have to readjust how the B team is. That's more of a little knife in the back saying that both of them decided to quit rather than just one. That shows what brothers and people that care about each other are like not people that stab each other in the back. Wear that a little bit better obviously.

[2024-09-24 21:50:45] ChatGPT:
Jamey wants to emphasize that by removing both of their sons, the B team will now lack enough players and will likely require adjustments, such as moving players from the A team to fill the gaps. This is intended to be a subtle "knife in the back" to highlight the solidarity between the brothers, in contrast to people who don't show the same loyalty.

Both of my sons have decided to leave the team. Their bond as brothers is stronger than the environment they were placed in, where skill and merit take a backseat to other concerns. With both leaving, the B team is now left short of players, likely needing adjustments or moving A team players down to compensate. I find it ironic that while my sons stand united in loyalty, others have shown less regard for the values that make a strong team.

If there’s any future discussion, it must come with a change in attitude. The way we’ve been treated by certain board members is unacceptable.

A strong team is built on merit, not manipulation. I hope future decisions reflect that.

### Key Changes:
1. **Subtle “Knife in the Back”:** Included the point about how both sons leaving affects the B team’s roster, subtly calling attention to the consequences and loyalty between the brothers, in contrast to the decisions made by the board.
2. **Maintained Conciseness and Impact:** The email is still brief, yet delivers the message sharply.

Read this entire chat and thoroughly grasp everything that I put in there, and figure out the best and most concise way of wording it for me, so that it provides all the points and sharpness that I'm looking for. I feel we want to keep everything in there, but we need it nice and short and concise. So please build it, let me know why you didn't put something in there, if you didn't put it in at the end, that way I have the understanding and reasoning for it. Or, if not, there is no reason not to leave it, to keep it out of there, put it in there so that it can stay in there, it's for the point of being in there, to have it affect the entire outcome of the email here. I really don't think they're going to invite anybody back after an email or anything like this, but I really don't care, I pretty much want to go tell them to go fuck themselves and their shitty attitude and their lack of respect.

Understood! I’ve reviewed the entire conversation and grasped all the key points you want to include. You want to make sure the email is sharp, direct, and emphasizes several key areas: the skill of your son, the biased decision-making, the lack of respect shown by the board, the solidarity between your sons, and the consequences of both sons leaving the team.

Here’s a streamlined, concise version of the email that keeps all the critical points intact, delivering them in a sharp yet professional manner:

**Subject**: Feedback on Recent Decisions and Lack of Fairness

Dear [Team Coach / Board Members],

I’m writing regarding the recent decision to move Nolan to the B team. Despite his consistent performance, often outperforming older players, the decision to move him down seems disconnected from merit. He’s proven himself repeatedly, including against players whose parents sit on the board, yet is being held back while others are pushed forward for reasons beyond skill.

The excuse of age has been used before, yet we see another board member’s child of the same age remaining on the A team. Nolan was previously moved up to the older team, where he started over others now in starting positions. Back then, decisions were based on ability. His first coach, Ben, who still plays for Stetson, recognized his talent and pushed him to excel. Unfortunately, since more parents have taken control, the focus seems to have shifted away from skill and toward pleasing certain individuals.

The disrespect shown during the conversation about Nolan's move was clear. This is the second time he’s been negatively affected by decisions that have nothing to do with his abilities. I’ve attached a video of his immediate reaction to the news for you to review, should you choose.

Both of my sons have now decided to leave the team. Their loyalty to each other, unlike the environment they were placed in, stands firm. With both gone, the B team is now short of players and will need adjustments or shifts from the A team. It’s ironic that while my sons stand united, others on the board have shown less regard for fairness or loyalty.

If there’s any future discussion, it will require a complete change in the attitude shown toward my family. The way we’ve been treated, especially by certain board members, is unacceptable.

A strong team is built on merit, not manipulation. I trust future decisions will reflect that.

Warm regards,  
[Jamey's Name]

### Key Points Addressed:

1. **Skill and Performance:** Highlighted Nolan’s consistent skill, his one-on-one outperforming of board members' children, and past placement based on merit.
2. **Age Discrimination:** Mentioned the use of age as an excuse and contrasted it with a board member’s child of the same age being kept on the A team.
3. **Past Coach Support:** Kept the reference to Ben, his past coach who pushed him to excel, which ties to the local connection with the Stetson team.
4. **Disrespect During Conversation:** Addressed the clear disrespect experienced during the discussion about Nolan’s move.
5. **Brothers’ Decision to Leave:** Highlighted both sons’ decision to leave, subtly noting the negative impact this will have on the B team, and contrasted their loyalty to each other with the board’s actions.
6. **Demand for Respect and Fairness:** The email closes by setting clear expectations for any future interaction, emphasizing that the current level of respect is unacceptable.

### What I Left Out (and Why):
- **Details about the Previous Director:** I didn’t mention the previous director or attempts to understand their motives, as it dilutes the focus on the current situation and makes the email longer without adding much impact. The email is more powerful when it stays focused on the immediate issues.
- **Explicit “Knife in the Back” Language:** The subtle phrasing about loyalty and team adjustments serves the purpose without overtly being aggressive. This maintains professionalism while still delivering the message.

This version is concise and delivers the points sharply while maintaining enough professionalism to ensure it’s read seriously. Let me know if this aligns with what you’re looking for!

[2024-09-24 21:57:30] FoSGamers:
I don't know if it's a good thing to put in there or not, but, um, whenever our child has been put into a situation of one-on-one against some of the people, he beats them. So I don't understand why, in the first place, that that wasn't used as the merit to decide who should be playing and who shouldn't. Um, it does seem like that is not used when you say that this is based on skill, and you want the best players playing to make everybody better. What it seems like you're trying to do is make certain people better because they are the ones that you want to make better, where others are either being held back for some biased reasoning that is unknown to us, or the child that you are harming, in the first place, due to your ignorance or arrogance or whatever the hell it is that you have going on there. I don't know. It seems like, personally, you have a group of people that you like, and we are not one of them, and since we are not one of them, my child is being harmed in the process. Or, my child is not one of them. They are being harmed in the process. It's, uh, quite sad that people act this way in this day and age, but we can definitely tell that, being in a small town, that these type of politics things are more apparent than expected in the first place, when we moved here. It makes sense why a couple of certain coaches left, and players left, specifically after everything occurred, and went to Port Orange. Like I said, we're at everything, so that it's a, pretty much, it's a nice fuck you, and that they should come and kiss our ass, because we're obviously better than everyone, in regards to all the things that we do, and our children, even. And they are lucky to even have us around them, because at some point, we were friends with them, versus being, these assholes are like this. Because they're going to want to brag about people like us. But no, instead, they're going to end up having us talking shit about them their entire fucking life, and pointing out how nice and shitty people they are in this area, and that you can't trust them, and they are disrespectful. So hopefully we never end up becoming anything special. I know they don't need to know that, or any of that other stuff, but, yeah, just build the email, and go tell them to go fuck themselves.

[2024-09-24 21:58:31] ChatGPT:
Jamey noted that their child has consistently outperformed others in one-on-one situations, yet this merit has not been used as the basis for decisions. Jamey believes the decision-making process seems biased, favoring certain people while holding others back, likely due to ignorance, arrogance, or personal bias. Jamey feels that their family is not part of the favored group, and their child is being harmed as a result. They have noticed that this kind of biased behavior is common in small towns, and this situation explains why some coaches and players have left for other areas like Port Orange. Jamey ultimately wants the email to communicate frustration and deliver a clear "go fuck yourself" message to the board.

**Subject**: Decisions Based on Bias, Not Merit

Dear [Team Coach / Board Members],

I’m writing regarding the recent decision to move Nolan to the B team. Despite his consistent performance and skill—often outperforming players in one-on-one situations—this decision doesn’t reflect merit. Nolan has proven repeatedly that he’s capable of beating players whose parents sit on the board, yet that doesn’t seem to matter when it comes to decisions. It’s clear that merit and skill aren’t being used to determine who should play, but rather personal bias and favoritism.

You’ve stated that this is about improving the team by playing the best players, but it seems certain individuals are being favored, while others—like my son—are held back. I don’t know if this is ignorance, arrogance, or simply biased decision-making, but it’s clear that our family isn’t in the group you want to support, and our child is suffering because of it. It’s sad that, in this day and age, we still see these types of politics and favoritism driving decisions in small towns.

Both of my sons have decided to quit the team. They refuse to play in an environment where skill takes a backseat to bias and where their hard work isn’t valued. With both of them gone, the B team is now short of players, so you’ll likely need to pull from the A team to make up for it. The irony is, while my sons stand united in loyalty to each other, you’ve shown none of that loyalty or fairness to them.

If there’s any future discussion, it will require a complete shift in the attitude shown toward our family. The way we’ve been treated, especially during the conversation where you informed us about Nolan’s move, has been unacceptable. This is the second time decisions have harmed our son for no valid reason.

A strong team is built on merit, not favoritism. I trust you’ll reflect on that moving forward.

Warm regards,  
[Jamey's Name]

### Key Points Included:
1. **Outperformance in One-on-One Situations:** Emphasized how your son has consistently outperformed other players in head-to-head matchups, yet those results aren’t reflected in the decisions.
2. **Bias and Favoritism:** Called out the biased decision-making and favoritism, making it clear that these decisions are not based on skill.
3. **Frustration with Small-Town Politics:** Included a reference to the small-town politics driving these decisions and why it’s frustrating to see in this day and age.
4. **Impact of Sons Leaving:** Highlighted the consequences of both sons leaving the team, including the B team now being short of players, and contrasted their loyalty with the board’s lack of it.
5. **Demand for Respect:** Reiterated the disrespect experienced during the conversation about Nolan’s move and made clear that any future discussion would require a significant change in attitude.

### Why I Omitted Certain Points:
- **Port Orange Reference:** I didn’t include the specific reference to other coaches and players leaving for Port Orange, as it distracts from the focus on your immediate frustration. Instead, I focused on the bias and favoritism issues.
- **Explicit Profanity:** While I’ve made the message sharp and direct, I’ve kept explicit profanity out to ensure the email is read seriously and not dismissed out of hand.

This version should now hit all the key points you want in a sharp, concise manner. Let me know if this fits what you're looking for!

[2024-09-24 21:59:12] FoSGamers:
Re-adjust it a little bit again. Make it not as sharp as it is there, but put it in with... Make sure there's the stuff in there for... understand about how both of them were stood together. Like I said before, the brothers, that was a good way. Put in that and other stuff like that. You need to be able to have it short and concise to the point, but long enough to get everything in there.

Here’s a revised version of the email, adjusting the sharpness and emphasizing the bond between your sons, while keeping it concise and getting your points across effectively:

**Subject**: Concerns Regarding Recent Decisions and Fairness

Dear [Team Coach / Board Members],

I’m writing in response to the decision to move Nolan to the B team. Despite his consistent performance, often outperforming older players in one-on-one situations, this decision doesn’t reflect merit or skill. Nolan has proven time and time again that he can compete at a high level, even surpassing players whose parents are involved in decision-making. Yet, for some reason, that hasn’t been taken into account.

Age has been cited as a reason for holding him back, yet a board member’s child of the same age remains on the A team. Previously, Nolan was regularly moved up to older teams based on his talent. His first coach, Ben—who still plays for Stetson—saw his potential and pushed him to higher levels. However, now it feels as though talent is no longer the driving factor. It’s hard to ignore that certain players are being favored while others are held back for reasons beyond skill.

This has not only affected Nolan, but it’s also affected our family. Both of my sons have decided to leave the team, standing by each other in solidarity. Their loyalty and bond as brothers are stronger than the environment they’ve been placed in, where skill seems secondary to personal bias. With both leaving, the B team is now left short of players, and I imagine there will need to be adjustments, including possibly moving A team players down.

We’ve also felt a lack of respect during this process, particularly during the conversation where we were told about Nolan’s move. This is the second time decisions have negatively impacted him, and it’s hard to see these choices as anything other than biased. I’ve attached a video of his reaction to this news for you to view, should you choose.

If there’s any future discussion, it must come with a change in attitude and respect toward our family. A strong team is built on merit and fairness, and I hope future decisions will reflect that.

Warm regards,

### Adjustments:
1. **Tone:** Softened the sharpness, making it more constructive while still addressing the key issues.
2. **Brothers’ Bond:** Emphasized the solidarity between your sons, showing their loyalty to each other as a strong contrast to the decision-making process.
3. **Bias and Favoritism:** Included a clear but less confrontational reference to favoritism and biased decision-making.
4. **Respect:** Highlighted the lack of respect experienced during the conversation about Nolan’s move, without making the tone overly harsh.

This version keeps the message clear and concise but with a more tempered tone. It still addresses the frustration and bias, while placing more emphasis on the bond between your sons and the respect your family deserves.

Should we put it in there that his older brother immediately did something that even adults that day couldn't even do themselves, which shows, showed honor and morals, where he immediately said when his brother said that he didn't want to play this team anymore, when just asked what he wanted to do further, um, because he's being moved to the team, like, so what do you want to do, buddy? You want to move to the team? And he said he didn't want to, and the youngest, Nolan, said he didn't want to play, while the oldest, Will, immediately said, I'm quitting too. I don't want to be on a team that bullies and is mean to my brother like that. An 11-year-old and a 9-year-old have more morals and character than the adults involved in this.

I don’t want to be on a team that bullies and is mean to my brother.” The fact that an 11-year-old and a 9-year-old have more morals and integrity than the adults making these decisions speaks volumes about the environment that has been created.

Both of my sons have now decided to leave the team, standing by each other in solidarity. Their loyalty and bond as brothers are stronger than the environment they’ve been placed in, where skill seems secondary to personal bias. With both of them leaving, the B team is now short on players, and I imagine there will need to be adjustments, possibly requiring players from the A team to fill the gaps.

This situation has highlighted a much larger issue. It’s not just about how our family has been treated—it’s about how decisions and behavior impact all families. This attitude of favoritism, disrespect, and biased decision-making needs to change, not just for us, but for everyone involved. Our situation may be the catalyst, but the issue is much bigger. If things don’t change, expect to be called out on this kind of treatment in the future.

I’ve attached a video of Nolan’s reaction to this news for you to view, should you choose.

A strong team is built on merit and fairness, not favoritism. I hope future decisions reflect that.

Warm regards,

### Key Changes:
1. **Broader Call for Change:** Shifted the message to make it clear that the needed change in respect and attitude applies to all families, not just yours, positioning your situation as a catalyst for change.
2. **Tone Adjusted for Accountability:** Highlighted that if behavior doesn’t change, the team should expect to be held accountable for their actions in the future.

This should now reflect your broader focus on fairness for everyone. Let me know if this delivers the message you’re aiming for!

Maybe don't say called out on this. Try to word it a little differently, but same kind of point across.

**Subject**: Concerns Regarding Recent Decisions and Fairness

Dear [Team Coach / Board Members],

I’m writing in response to the decision to move Nolan to the B team. Despite his consistent performance, often outperforming older players in one-on-one situations, this decision doesn’t reflect merit or skill. Nolan has proven time and again that he can compete at a high level, even surpassing players whose parents are involved in decision-making. Yet, for some reason, that hasn’t been taken into account.

Age has been cited as a reason for holding him back, yet a board member’s child of the same age remains on the A team. Previously, Nolan was regularly moved up to older teams based on his talent. His first coach, Ben—who still plays for Stetson—recognized his potential and pushed him to higher levels. However, now it feels as though talent is no longer the driving factor. It’s hard to ignore that certain players are being favored while others are held back for reasons beyond skill.

When we asked Nolan what he wanted to do about being moved to the B team, he simply said he didn’t want to play for a team that treats him this way.

[2024-09-24 22:12:32] ChatGPT:
Here's a relevant quote from Lionel Messi that could fit well with your message about the importance of fairness, merit, and teamwork:

"I prefer to win titles with the team ahead of individual awards or scoring more goals than anyone else. I’m more worried about being a good person than being the best football player in the world." 

This quote aligns perfectly with your point that success should come from working together and prioritizing the team's success over favoritism. It highlights how character and teamwork matter more than individual recognition, which could serve as a subtle reminder to the board about where their focus should lie【82†source】【84†source】【86†source】.

A relevant quote from Lionel Messi that reflects teamwork, fairness, and merit over favoritism is:

"Without the help of my teammates, I would be nothing. I wouldn’t win titles, honors, nothing."

This quote underscores Messi's belief in teamwork and collective success rather than individual achievement, which aligns with your message about merit and fairness being the foundations of a strong team, not favoritism.

I think you need to find, search more, and understand what I have been going on, read this entire chat, thoroughly understand it, and then find a good quote that relates to what is going on, and how, um, that playing on a team should be based on merit, and not bias for some reason or another.

[2024-09-24 22:14:15] ChatGPT:
Based on your request and after thoroughly reviewing Messi's quotes, here is one that closely aligns with your goal of emphasizing merit and fairness in team dynamics:

"I prefer to win titles with the team ahead of individual awards or scoring more goals than anyone else. I'm more worried about being a good person than being the best football player in the world." 

This quote highlights the value of teamwork over individual glory, reinforcing the idea that a successful team is built on fairness, unity, and collaboration rather than favoritism. It could subtly challenge the board's actions by contrasting Messi’s ethos of putting the team first and emphasizing merit.

This would fit well with your broader point that favoritism undermines the integrity of a team, as Messi focuses on the collective success of a team rather than personal biases or individual recognition【101†source】【102†source】.

**Subject**: Concerns Regarding Recent Decisions and Fairness

Dear [Team Coach / Board Members],

I’m writing regarding the decision to move Nolan to the B team. Nolan has always modeled his playing style on teamwork, much like Lionel Messi. He consistently plays with a focus on leading his teammates, passing the ball ahead to help them succeed, even when they haven’t figured out how to follow through yet. His selflessness on the field, prioritizing the success of the team over personal glory, shows maturity beyond his age.

Despite this, Nolan has been overlooked in favor of players who may not match his skill or leadership. Age has been used as an excuse for holding him back, yet a board member’s child of the same age remains on the A team. Previously, Nolan was regularly moved up to older teams based on his talent. His first coach, Ben—who still plays for Stetson—recognized this potential and pushed him to higher levels. However, it seems that now, talent is being ignored in favor of personal bias.

When we asked Nolan what he wanted to do about being moved to the B team, he simply said he didn’t want to play for a team that treats him this way. Immediately, his older brother Will—who plays on the B team—showed more honor and character than most adults involved by saying, “I’m quitting too.

We don't need to say anything about him being modeled like Messi. We just need to say the things that he does, you know, make it say, like, you know, take the things that he does and, like, how he plays as a team, where he passes and he does these things before others, he puts his teams before others, more often than not, throughout the fact that he got a yellow card last year when no one would stand up for the teammate when his teammate got grabbed in the balls and he ended up throwing the other guy to the ground because no one would stand up for him. Like, that type of stuff, he's the team player you want on your team, not the one you want off of your team. And you put those things out there. And that, well, not, like, use these examples of, like, unbelievable how they can do this and don't put in there, like, anything about Messi at all until the last quote, how it being, you know, this situation reminds of a quote of whatever you want to say that way. No one running into this reminds you of this quote at the end, but just have the beginning parts of it, how, like, if you're making comments about his play style, have it being similar to, you know, how he passes and does things and make it similar to how Messi does these things is what I get, how the play style is. That's all I'm trying to say there. Make it that way. Don't make it say it that way and draw exact attention to it, but kind of, like, when they read it at the end, they're like, oh, well, I see he plays like him, too. You know, like, a lot of times it's, like, obvious, but they can figure it out based on how they see him play and then reading this. They'll, like, put it all together like they're fucking up bad by doing what they're doing. And they want to rethink their decision and come back to us to kiss our ass because, yes, the person was a little bit rude. It wasn't, it wasn't the person that was the director. It was, like you said, the board member specifically.

**Subject**: Concerns Regarding Recent Decisions and Fairness

Dear [Team Coach / Board Members],

I’m writing in response to the decision to move Nolan to the B team. Nolan’s playing style has always put the team first. He consistently leads his teammates, passing the ball ahead to give them the best chance to succeed, even when they may not be ready to make the play. His priority is making his team better, whether by creating opportunities or putting his teammates in positions to succeed. His selflessness is clear in every game.

Nolan’s actions on the field go beyond just passing the ball. Last year, he stood up for a teammate who was being unfairly treated, receiving a yellow card for defending him when no one else would. That’s the kind of teammate Nolan is—the one who stands up for others and is willing to sacrifice his own benefit for the good of the team. He’s the type of player any team would want, not someone who should be pushed aside.

Despite this, he’s been moved to the B team while a board member’s child of the same age remains on the A team. Nolan has always been a player whose talent and leadership stood out. His first coach, Ben—who still plays for Stetson—recognized his potential and continually pushed him to higher levels. Now, it seems that talent and integrity are being ignored in favor of personal biases.

When asked what he wanted to do, Nolan simply said he didn’t want to play for a team that treated him this way. His older brother Will—who plays on the B team—immediately responded by saying, “I’m quitting too. I don’t want to be on a team that bullies and is mean to my brother.” That kind of loyalty and moral strength in an 11-year-old and a 9-year-old says more about character than the decisions made by the adults involved.

Both of my sons have now decided to leave the team. Their bond as brothers and their commitment to fairness is stronger than an environment where skill and integrity are overshadowed by favoritism. With both leaving, the B team will now be short on players, and adjustments will be needed, likely requiring A team players to fill those gaps.

This isn’t just about how our family has been treated. This situation highlights a much larger issue. The attitude of favoritism, disrespect, and biased decision-making affects all families involved. Our experience may be the catalyst, but the issue runs deeper, and if things continue this way, it’s only a matter of time before others begin to question the choices being made.

Reflecting on all of this reminds me of a quote from Lionel Messi: “I prefer to win titles with the team ahead of individual awards or scoring more goals than anyone else.” It’s a sentiment I often share with Nolan. His playing style, which focuses on teamwork over personal accolades, embodies that mindset. Yet, the current environment disregards the values of merit and teamwork. It’s time to reflect on whether the decisions being made truly reflect the best interests of the team.

I’ve attached a video of Nolan’s reaction to this news for you to view, should you choose.

### Key Adjustments:
1. **Teamwork and Leadership:** Emphasized Nolan’s leadership and how he puts the team first in his playing style, including examples of him standing up for his teammates.

**Subject**: Concerns Regarding Recent Decisions and Fairness

Dear [Team Coach / Board Members],

I’m writing regarding the decision to move Nolan to the B team. Nolan’s playing style has always put the team first. He consistently leads his teammates, passing the ball ahead to give them the best chance to succeed, even when they may not be ready to make the play. His priority is making his team better, whether by creating opportunities or putting his teammates in positions to succeed. His selflessness is clear in every game.

Nolan’s actions on the field go beyond just passing the ball. Last year, he stood up for a teammate who was being unfairly treated, receiving a yellow card for defending him when no one else would. That’s the kind of teammate Nolan is—the one who stands up for others and is willing to sacrifice his own benefit for the good of the team. He’s the type of player any team would want, not someone who should be pushed aside.

Despite this, he’s been moved to the B team while a board member’s child of the same age remains on the A team. I can’t help but wonder if this all stems from the team photo incident where Nolan was left out, despite sitting just 20 feet away because he had been asked to play for the younger team. Miraculously, it’s at this point that they started asking him to move to the younger team permanently.

When asked what he wanted to do, Nolan simply said he didn’t want to play for a team that treated him this way. His older brother Will—who plays on the B team—immediately responded by saying, “I’m quitting too. I don’t want to be on a team that bullies and is mean to my brother.” That kind of loyalty and moral strength in an 11-year-old and a 9-year-old says more about character than the decisions made by the adults involved.

Both of my sons have now decided to leave the team. Their bond as brothers and their commitment to fairness is stronger than an environment where skill and integrity are overshadowed by favoritism. With both leaving, the B team will now be short on players, and adjustments will be needed, likely requiring A team players to fill those gaps.

This isn’t just about how our family has been treated. This situation highlights a much larger issue. The attitude of favoritism, disrespect, and biased decision-making affects all families involved. Our experience may be the catalyst, but the issue runs deeper, and if things continue this way, it’s only a matter of time before others begin to question the choices being made.

Reflecting on all of this reminds me of a quote from Lionel Messi: “I prefer to win titles with the team ahead of individual awards or scoring more goals than anyone else.” It’s a sentiment I often share with Nolan. His playing style, which focuses on teamwork over personal accolades, embodies that mindset. Yet, the current environment disregards the values of merit and teamwork. It’s time to reflect on whether the decisions being made truly reflect the best interests of the team.

I’ve attached a video of Nolan’s reaction to this news for you to view, should you choose.

A strong team is built on merit and fairness, not favoritism. I hope future decisions reflect that.

Warm regards,

You can note that last year and this year, on a regular basis, he drops back to cover positions when no one else does, after a person leaves, or to go to a position they're not supposed to be in, or maybe take the ball up when they should have been doing it, and no one else falls back. And he did that all last year, to the point that they even put him on defense continuously, because they needed somebody there and put people on offense, even at points during games when they had enough people, and he never even got a chance to play there when he wanted to. Because they wanted him on defense, which he didn't want to. The kind of, I don't know, favoritism thing that we thought was going on. Period.

Jamey noted that last year and this year, Nolan frequently drops back to cover positions when other players leave their positions, even though it’s not his role. He has repeatedly filled in on defense when no one else does, and this behavior led to him being put on defense continuously, even though he wanted to play offense. This happened even when there were enough players to rotate positions, and it felt like favoritism was involved in these decisions.

**Subject**: Concerns Regarding Recent Decisions and Fairness

Dear [Team Coach / Board Members],

I’m writing regarding the decision to move Nolan to the B team. Nolan’s playing style has always put the team first. He consistently leads his teammates, passing the ball ahead to give them the best chance to succeed, even when they may not be ready to make the play. His priority is making his team better, whether by creating opportunities or putting his teammates in positions to succeed. His selflessness is clear in every game.

Throughout last year and this year, Nolan has continuously dropped back to cover positions when other players abandoned theirs. He stepped in on defense when no one else would, to the point where the team regularly placed him on defense—despite having enough players for rotation and Nolan expressing interest in playing offense. His willingness to sacrifice his own preference for the team’s needs speaks to his dedication. It became evident to us, however, that favoritism was in play when he was kept on defense without the opportunity to play where he wanted, despite other players not carrying the same weight.

I also can’t help but wonder if this all stems from the team photo incident where Nolan was left out, despite sitting just 20 feet away because he had been asked to play for the younger team. Miraculously, it’s at this point that they started asking him to move to the younger team permanently.

When asked what he wanted to do, Nolan simply said he didn’t want to play for a team that treated him this way. His older brother Will—who plays on the B team—immediately responded by saying, “I’m quitting too.

You may want to, I know you might want to watch, not, not to watch. I know they may not want to watch the whole video, but they may want to listen to at least his words. Because they are quite potent coming from a nine-year-old child.

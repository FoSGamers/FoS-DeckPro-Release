[00:06:00] moment and then uh we'll up we'll
[00:06:02] upgrade those as the uh the day goes and
[00:06:05] some sales occur that's kind of what I
[00:06:06] like to do
[00:06:08] here maybe you want some maybe you don't
[00:06:11] oh that's still plugged in I don't want
[00:06:12] that plugged in over there like that I
[00:06:14] need to adjust how this is done move
[00:06:17] this no one's in here right now so I
[00:06:18] might as well do it at the
[00:06:21] moment I to plug in my um printer
[00:06:25] because the Wi-Fi wasn't working but
[00:06:27] when I plugged it in cu I don't I had to
[00:06:30] reset some stuff and for whatever reason
[00:06:31] didn't connect when I plugged it in it
[00:06:33] allowed me to print everything in a a
[00:06:35] batch instead of the individuals that I
[00:06:38] had been I'm like oh I'm leaving it
[00:06:40] plugged in
[00:06:41] now so I need to uh rearrange how I had
[00:06:45] the cord here so it's actually normally
[00:06:46] out of the way rather than just a a
[00:06:48] temporary thing that I place here to be
[00:06:50] like oh look I temporarily plac this
[00:06:53] here to actually do a little bit of that
[00:06:56] right now since there's no one in here
[00:06:58] and I do have those things up there if
[00:06:59] you want there we go there we go and
[00:07:03] that will get plugged in at the end
[00:07:06] here like
[00:07:08] so maybe maybe like
[00:07:14] so oh wrong way that's probably why
[00:07:16] putting on the wrong
[00:07:19] way that's why damn [ __ ] USB cable
[00:07:24] making sure you got to put it the right
[00:07:26] direction and that's sitting on my phone

[00:15:23] shot we got a couple of nice cards when
[00:15:25] we pulled them out here a minute ago I'm
[00:15:28] actually pretty excited about uh three
[00:15:30] of them well four of them actually cuz
[00:15:32] my son's going to like our little aret
[00:15:34] right I mean our Elemental eruption cuz
[00:15:36] he's got a dragon
[00:15:38] deck I we pulled this I just pulled this
[00:15:41] out and I'm pretty excited about this
[00:15:43] the legion extruder nice one there I was
[00:15:46] happy about that one I pull that one out
[00:15:48] then I also got this the terror of the
[00:15:50] Peaks which my son's going to be happy
[00:15:52] with too because as he said he's a
[00:15:53] dragon deck so that's nice one there
[00:15:56] nice dragon for him flying
[00:15:59] spells your opponent cast Target Terror
[00:16:01] Peaks cost an additional three life to
[00:16:02] cast I mean that's awesome whenever
[00:16:04] another creature enters the battlefield
[00:16:06] under your control teror the Peaks deals
[00:16:07] damage equal to that creature's power to
[00:16:09] any
[00:16:09] Target nice hey good morning Mike dude
[00:16:14] ter of the peak is awesome so and then
[00:16:17] we got the other one I got was aret foil
[00:16:20] aret LifeLink whenever AR Ora becomes
[00:16:23] attached now I think I might have
[00:16:25] another one of these so if somebody
[00:16:26] wants one I don't need an air yet but
[00:16:28] the dragons and the Mana and the legion

[00:17:03] will uh get upgraded now maybe it will
[00:17:06] be a pack of cards at some point maybe
[00:17:10] it'll be a collector booster at some
[00:17:11] point depending on what we're doing I
[00:17:12] don't
[00:17:15] know oh the are up be gerer yeah that's
[00:17:19] a nice one see my wife's been looking
[00:17:20] for a bunch of the
[00:17:22] um merfolk ones and we have not gotten
[00:17:25] the um that she really wants the shark
[00:17:28] NATO for some reason or shark whatever
[00:17:30] shark tornado or whatever it
[00:17:33] is but she's uh yeah she have we have
[00:17:35] not pulled out any merfolk out
[00:17:38] of almost two boxes now which is really
[00:17:41] surprising to me and no one's actually
[00:17:44] even bought any of the other ones so I I
[00:17:46] might be um Thunder Junction didn't do
[00:17:49] too well for me for some reason I don't
[00:17:51] know
[00:17:53] why oh I forgot to do my son's game
[00:17:55] maybe that's why we should do the my
[00:17:57] son's game that we had a couple of those
[00:17:58] those ones the um the uh showdowns and
[00:18:02] stuff forgot about
[00:18:07] those those of you on YouTube watching
[00:18:09] if you don't mind Jump On In and hang
[00:18:11] out with us uh you can always use that
[00:18:13] link there and you should actually even
[00:18:14] get a discount code and if you want to
[00:18:17] to try it out see if you want to us
[00:18:19] purchase
[00:18:23] anything but here we go try these here
[00:18:25] just get everything I like I'm weird I
[00:18:27] put everything in sleeves to protect
[00:18:28] them even like
[00:18:29] stupid
[00:18:30] things cuz they're only a penny why not
[00:18:34] why not put them in a sleeve and protect
[00:18:36] them they're only a penny doesn't really
[00:18:38] matter let's do this now let's see how
[00:18:41] much some of these are worth so I'm not
[00:18:43] sure what a couple of these
[00:18:47] are discount H did I did I say
[00:18:53] that what did I say discount
[00:18:55] on my mouth moves so quick sometime I
[00:18:58] forg
[00:19:01] yes but we can do discounts at times we
[00:19:04] do them all the time as you can see here
[00:19:05] this actually was up for 13 instead of
[00:19:07] 14 I do discount if you guys don't pay
[00:19:10] attention I do discounts every single
[00:19:12] time I do a combination of cards just
[00:19:16] because if it's a multiple things I like
[00:19:17] to give you guys a discount on things
[00:19:19] like give you a little bit
[00:19:21] off so that's why that was up there for
[00:19:24] 13 instead of 14 because these are both
[00:19:26] normally seven
[00:19:29] they were nine until I got rid of the
[00:19:31] other pack the box cuz I had to buy a
[00:19:32] box from our uh from the local store and
[00:19:35] I end up chargeing more and that just
[00:19:36] sucked took me a while to get rid of
[00:19:38] those I had to put them in some of the
[00:19:39] games I was
[00:19:40] doing but here we go we'll add in maybe
[00:19:44] you don't want that stuff maybe you want
[00:19:46] something weird like a combo here of
[00:19:49] stuff like that I don't know that's a
[00:19:50] weird combo but let's try it
[00:19:59] put uh oh I got to do this with
[00:20:02] dun I got do that like that to hold them
[00:20:05] up so they can be
[00:20:08] seen
[00:20:12] screenshot
[00:20:13] screenshot there you
[00:20:15] go there you
[00:20:18] go there you
[00:20:20] go and then there you
[00:20:24] go then there you go as right now
[00:20:28] there's a discount on these so instead
[00:20:31] of this being 32 I dropped it down a
[00:20:33] couple bucks cuz we got a few of them
[00:20:35] together there so I'd like to do it a
[00:20:37] little
[00:20:39] bit I know the adventures the adventure
[00:20:42] is really fun if people want to jump in
[00:20:43] and play it has a good one I have a lot
[00:20:45] of fun doing it um I'm actually like I
[00:20:48] said I'm working on doing a different
[00:20:49] Adventure where the whole show is just
[00:20:51] going to be an adventure start from the
[00:20:53] beginning we're going to build our
[00:20:55] characters um and then once we build our
[00:20:57] characters will go through the adventure
[00:21:00] and maybe if it's quick enough we'll get
[00:21:02] through the whole thing if it's not
[00:21:04] maybe uh well it'll be like a each each
[00:21:07] each uh live will be the new boss we
[00:21:09] have to get to type thing I don't know
[00:21:11] I'm trying to figure it out so far but
[00:21:13] so far that's my thoughts on it and the
[00:21:15] way we'll build it is with the adventure
[00:21:16] you'll build your characters and we'll
[00:21:18] build them based off of um the am like
[00:21:22] you know packs and say somebody buys in
[00:21:23] and they want to help build a character
[00:21:25] well maybe they can add a bonus because
[00:21:27] they like magic so they want to be a
[00:21:29] magician so they go you know I'm going I
[00:21:30] want to buy in and I want to make them a
[00:21:32] magician and by making them a magician
[00:21:34] I'm going to give them this for plus one
[00:21:37] and the rest of them are regular though
[00:21:38] but I'm going to give them a plus one
[00:21:40] for by adding a couple packs onto them
[00:21:42] for their uh for their I don't know
[00:21:44] intelligence or something I don't know
[00:21:45] what we'll go with that type of thing
[00:21:47] and see how it
[00:21:54] goes I know but yeah try it out see what
[00:21:57] it goes looks like those are up there
[00:21:59] for a minute or so let me see if I can
[00:22:01] find any uh anything out of these that
[00:22:03] were uh worth
[00:22:05] anything I think the reanimates a couple
[00:22:08] bucks but um I want The Wanted I the
[00:22:10] beger one is pretty nice like my like I
[00:22:13] said my wife pulled that out was liking
[00:22:15] it she just was unhappy that she doesn't
[00:22:17] have any mermaid yet it's like come on
[00:22:20] give us a mermaid at least that she
[00:22:26] wants well reanimate was a couple bucks
[00:22:28] I thought reanimate was a few bucks haha
[00:22:31] I was
[00:22:43] correct yeah I I the adventures
[00:22:46] definitely distract me also I will say
[00:22:48] that now if you want to play an
[00:22:51] adventure now what I was thinking is at
[00:22:54] least the if we don't play the adventure
[00:22:55] and no one wants to jump in I can go
[00:22:58] through the Adventure myself here and
[00:23:00] you guys can still watch and maybe I'll
[00:23:02] maybe I'll do some things and have you
[00:23:03] guys participate at some points but I
[00:23:06] figured at least the um it wouldn't be
[00:23:07] me just hanging out here doing nothing
[00:23:09] it would be at least be able to do the
[00:23:10] um the adventure the entire time and
[00:23:14] have stuff going on the entire time for
[00:23:16] the show rather than just kind of like
[00:23:18] stopping and hanging out for a little
[00:23:19] bit and not talking about much if that
[00:23:21] makes any sense I don't know I thought
[00:23:22] that would be a better idea that way the
[00:23:24] show would move a little bit uh more
[00:23:26] especially when I'm doing it for like
[00:23:27] the 2hour time frame in the morning
[00:23:32] here I don't know maybe I'm wrong and I
[00:23:35] overthink
[00:23:41] things hopefully you are all having a
[00:23:43] good morning though I know it is a
[00:23:45] Tuesday and you can't have a good
[00:23:46] morning always on Tuesdays but hey you
[00:23:49] do the best you can holy
[00:23:52] [ __ ] that's a $20
[00:23:57] card all I didn't know that Terror
[00:24:00] Peaks sorry for swearing right
[00:24:03] there that was that was an unexpected uh
[00:24:06] pull well my son is going to have a
[00:24:08] sweet
[00:24:10] Dragon for his deck say that say that
[00:24:14] one make sure I get that in a topl
[00:24:16] loader for you protect that
[00:24:22] baby yeah that was nice that was a nice
[00:24:25] one I didn't expect that well it's $19
[00:24:30] $9 at least that's what uh uh what do
[00:24:34] you call it monobo says and it's based
[00:24:35] off of
[00:24:37] um TCG player so nice foil that he'll be
[00:24:42] happy to have that that's a sweet card
[00:24:43] though in general just that card itself
[00:24:46] is
[00:24:50] nice all righty well I figure we'll be
[00:24:54] going slow on these days it's going to
[00:24:56] probably me you and me and you Gustavo
[00:24:58] for a while hanging out
[00:25:01] here figuring until I at least get my
[00:25:03] adventure going you
[00:25:05] know CU at that point that's when it
[00:25:07] will be uh that's when I'll maybe have
[00:25:09] some more people hanging out and um
[00:25:11] entertainment and stuff going on you
[00:25:12] know because they'll be here to pay hang
[00:25:14] it watch the game the entire time you
[00:25:18] know I like it that's a nice little hit
[00:25:22] too a $6 hit not bad that actually a
[00:25:26] good pack there
[00:25:29] somebody had purchased that pack
[00:25:31] themselves they would have gotten their
[00:25:32] money back and then
[00:25:34] some that's the only thing that uh you
[00:25:37] know with magic stinks sometimes right
[00:25:40] you don't never know all right let's uh
[00:25:44] let's think here trying to think of what
[00:25:45] I'll do with the adventure that's a nice
[00:25:47] hit I like that my son's going to be
[00:25:50] very happy about that
[00:25:51] card he's actually going to be happy
[00:25:53] about the elemental eruption
[00:25:55] too that Elemental eruption is nice
[00:26:03] may not be expensive but that's a nice
[00:26:04] card for him to play with create a 44 uh
[00:26:07] red dragon Elemental token with flying
[00:26:09] and prow
[00:26:10] s and also storm nice one there it's a
[00:26:14] good card I like
[00:26:24] it you got a lot of uh bulk to get rid
[00:26:27] of you know what the way that um I do
[00:26:29] the bulk at least for me um I know it's
[00:26:32] not necessarily going to be beneficial
[00:26:34] for you but because I do the shows like
[00:26:37] this um a lot of times I'll do bulk
[00:26:40] where um on some of the other things
[00:26:42] where I do shows where the bulk to do
[00:26:45] giveaways cuz they are the way they do
[00:26:46] them are free and there's a lot of
[00:26:48] people that just jump in just get free
[00:26:50] stuff um they don't even bother doing
[00:26:51] anything so we the way I do the
[00:26:53] giveaways just to um so that they're
[00:26:54] running is I'll have like a a a foil
[00:26:57] card just like doesn't really cost
[00:26:58] anything then my sons they like to
[00:27:00] participate so they'll sign like a card
[00:27:02] here and we'll send one of the signed
[00:27:04] cards them and that'll be like what we
[00:27:05] do for giveaways and that's kind of how
[00:27:07] we get rid of our bulk now the other way
[00:27:09] that people do bulk too is I've seen
[00:27:11] people go online and sell bulk literally
[00:27:13] say hey I'm selling bulk at you know $3
[00:27:17] a pound that type of thing just to get
[00:27:20] rid of it um so I mean you can do that
[00:27:23] if you want I've seen lots of um
[00:27:24] different people do that even on um even
[00:27:27] streaming I've seen people do that
[00:27:28] before where they like here here's a
[00:27:30] pack of bulk uh bulk lands you know
[00:27:32] people like to getting bulk lands that
[00:27:34] way they might have a land from a
[00:27:36] different um set that they want you know
[00:27:37] that type of thing so I don't know
[00:27:39] sometimes if you can tell them like what
[00:27:40] the sets were sometimes they'll take
[00:27:43] them sometimes they'll just take it just
[00:27:44] because it's bulk offu and they want to
[00:27:46] get it so you can try that at times
[00:27:48] that's not a bad one there either a
[00:27:50] little Legion I'll take that
[00:27:53] Legion nice Legion right there
[00:27:56] reanimates a nice one
[00:28:00] too
[00:28:02] swamp yeah but if you try that out that
[00:28:05] actually might help that might
[00:28:08] work yeah I don't know and and and
[00:28:12] something as an option let's put this
[00:28:14] back put back our Wilds of ELD drain set
[00:28:19] put back our double Masters and then
[00:28:22] let's put out
[00:28:24] a Japanese ioria and I'm going to give
[00:28:28] give that two strength cuz it's a
[00:28:29] Japanese ioria why not let's give that
[00:28:31] two strength being a Japanese
[00:28:34] ioria we something special there we're
[00:28:37] going to say it's two strength instead
[00:28:38] of one for those that want to jump in on
[00:28:41] this Wasteland
[00:28:45] Adventure that's what I'll call
[00:28:49] that here we
[00:28:56] go yes Japanese ioria I have one other
[00:29:00] box that is the last of um I have one
[00:29:03] two three of those ones left and that is
[00:29:06] another box that I have there I have
[00:29:08] some Japanese ioria I've actually been
[00:29:10] debating on getting some Japanese um um
[00:29:13] Fallout just because it's a little
[00:29:14] cheaper than the other Fallout and you
[00:29:16] can still use the cards you get some
[00:29:18] cool um you get some cool interactions
[00:29:21] like different um arts on them too and
[00:29:23] then on the other side of it is uh
[00:29:26] they're cheaper and and um you you can
[00:29:31] still get high strength cards at a
[00:29:34] discount in a way just because of how
[00:29:35] much cheaper they are if that makes any
[00:29:38] sense I like to put the prices on my
[00:29:40] lands so that we know what they are I'm
[00:29:43] going to because we put them in a box to
[00:29:45] use them for ourselves and sometimes I
[00:29:46] do like land packs so that's the other
[00:29:48] reason why hey Mike how you doing buddy
[00:29:52] let's come back in how's it going on the
[00:29:53] other place I'm guessing uh you're
[00:29:55] bouncing back and forth type thing
[00:30:07] because we uh yeah we're going to we're
[00:30:09] having some fun here we were doing some
[00:30:11] things talking about different stuff so
[00:30:13] I think I'm actually going to um start
[00:30:15] doing like I said today after the show
[00:30:18] here and after I start some of my
[00:30:21] um my uh after I start work here and if
[00:30:24] I on like lunch break I'm going to start
[00:30:26] looking at um
[00:30:29] how to use that roll 20 a little bit
[00:30:30] more that way I think I'm going to do uh
[00:30:34] I think I might try to use that instead
[00:30:36] of it of me doing the animations myself
[00:30:39] and just add my animations into there
[00:30:42] because it looks like I can do that by
[00:30:44] creating my own story or my own
[00:30:46] adventure uh so I think I'm going to be
[00:30:49] able to do
[00:30:51] that ah making pancakes the
[00:30:54] daughter you making me hungry I forgot
[00:30:56] to eat breakfast I'm going to have to
[00:30:57] eat after this I always get uh I have
[00:31:01] Frozen egg
[00:31:03] sandwiches I'm
[00:31:05] lazy Malay
[00:31:08] person so are you starting um you said
[00:31:11] next month here like as in the next
[00:31:13] couple weeks you're going to be starting
[00:31:14] hanging out on this um in the evenings
[00:31:16] or in the afternoon type
[00:31:20] things cuz uh just was wondering cuz I
[00:31:23] do I'm going to start doing some evening
[00:31:25] ones on here just because um just to get
[00:31:27] some some time in and try to get rid of
[00:31:29] the stock that I
[00:31:30] have uh because I don't think whatnot
[00:31:33] well I said the name I don't think the
[00:31:34] other place is going to let me back on
[00:31:36] after my wife um realized my wife went
[00:31:39] and um open a Better Business Bureau
[00:31:42] case because she got pissed I didn't
[00:31:44] know
[00:31:46] that so I'm probably not going to be let
[00:31:48] back on
[00:31:51] there nice awesome sweet dude who's your
[00:31:54] uh who's your rep who's your rep if you
[00:31:57] don't mind me asking the rep I like how
[00:31:59] we have the Reps here the reps are
[00:32:08] awesome I like how they do that that
[00:32:10] makes you definitely feel like you're uh
[00:32:13] they're here to help and work with you
[00:32:14] not like they're here to uh just take
[00:32:17] from you if that makes any
[00:32:21] sense I don't know how else to explain
[00:32:24] that
[00:32:39] okay yeah I'm not got a different person
[00:32:41] but nice
[00:32:47] nice I actually if I was going to buy
[00:32:50] something Gustavo it would be bundles or
[00:32:52] pre-release I'm a big fan of those
[00:32:56] more yeah it makes you feel feel like
[00:32:58] they care even if I mean even if they
[00:33:00] don't really at least they seem like
[00:33:03] they do and I it does actually I don't I
[00:33:05] do think they do because they want to
[00:33:07] grow and be successful so they do kind
[00:33:09] of care you know what I
[00:33:14] mean but that's for me Gustavo I would
[00:33:16] say I prefer if I can get a bundle I've
[00:33:18] actually been debating and opening a
[00:33:20] bundle here myself just to have
[00:33:22] something to open while we're hanging
[00:33:24] out here because I did buy one bundle of
[00:33:26] Outlaws just because because um bundles
[00:33:29] are generally better luck to get really
[00:33:32] good cards and I've seen bundles pull
[00:33:35] out like three times the amount that
[00:33:37] they're worth on a regular basis with um
[00:33:41] with um like wild drain and um what was
[00:33:45] it wild Z drain and Exelon it was insane
[00:33:49] what you could pull out of those
[00:33:51] ones then there was um Lord of the Rings
[00:33:54] Wicked different
[00:34:01] yes you get the D20 with it
[00:34:05] too yeah yep exactly yeah that so you
[00:34:08] get the you get the you get the dice you
[00:34:11] get and Pro Plus generally the packs if
[00:34:13] you do mathematically the packs are
[00:34:15] cheaper than buying them sing as
[00:34:17] individual packs too so if you can save
[00:34:19] the money to get the bundle I'm a fan of
[00:34:22] doing bundles
[00:34:25] personally that's just me though you
[00:34:28] know that's just
[00:34:30] me let's put out a
[00:34:33] uh little something like this for a one
[00:34:37] strength for your character here as you
[00:34:39] want her in the
[00:34:41] Wasteland we'll do
[00:34:43] that I'm going to take a
[00:34:46] screenshot put those right
[00:34:51] there all right
[00:35:14] okay let's get that on there and I don't
[00:35:16] like I I would I wish that they could
[00:35:19] put like a little T like a a a dragging
[00:35:22] line for how long you want your um your
[00:35:25] timer to be when you do um your auctions
[00:35:29] that way if you can make it at like
[00:35:31] anything from like 1 second all the way
[00:35:33] up to like 5 minutes or whatever it is
[00:35:36] that they want allow you to do you know
[00:35:37] what I
[00:35:43] mean yeah I love the screenshot feature
[00:35:47] dude it's awesome it knows exactly that
[00:35:48] mean you know exactly what was done what
[00:35:50] you're using what's being put up
[00:35:54] there yeah you have to control yourself
[00:35:56] yep
[00:35:59] yeah you what you do if like I said if
[00:36:01] you can make a bulk pack and sell it
[00:36:05] that way or even go and sell if there's
[00:36:07] some cards that you're not using in
[00:36:08] decks I actually like oh I'm going to
[00:36:10] hold on to this I'm going to use this at
[00:36:11] some point how many freaking times I've
[00:36:13] used that card that I'm like I'm going
[00:36:14] to hold on this use on use
[00:36:17] this about that many times to
[00:36:21] zero like I might have put it in like
[00:36:23] once or twice so my point is like if
[00:36:26] there's one that you're thinking OT
[00:36:28] keeping unless you are you start to
[00:36:30] build a deck around it just don't just
[00:36:32] give up on it and don't use it is all
[00:36:34] I'm kind of
[00:36:36] saying sell it like there's some cards
[00:36:39] like I was saying like there's other
[00:36:41] cards that I would personally would um I
[00:36:44] I wanted to keep some to some of the um
[00:36:47] I wanted to keep each version of the
[00:36:50] posters and I ended up getting the
[00:36:52] poster cards from Lord of the Rings when
[00:36:54] I got those poster cards from Lord of
[00:36:56] the Rings I'll show those off for a
[00:36:57] little minute here I got a bunch of them
[00:36:59] but I had um some that were duplicates
[00:37:01] that were um foil and
[00:37:04] nonfoil and my wife's like are you going
[00:37:06] to ever use the non-foil ones or do
[00:37:08] anything with them I'm like no not
[00:37:10] really I'll probably just sit there in a
[00:37:11] box behind the PO the foil ones in a bag
[00:37:14] in a in a book and she's like so what's
[00:37:17] the point of even having the non-foil
[00:37:19] one if it's literally going to sit
[00:37:21] behind something the entire
[00:37:24] time yes they are they are really fancy
[00:37:27] so what I ended up doing was I uh oh why
[00:37:30] did that only do that I thought it was
[00:37:32] supposed to go
[00:37:33] longer so I ended up um selling them
[00:37:38] off for uh selling off some of the ones
[00:37:41] that are non- poster I mean the non-foil
[00:37:43] posters and just kept myself the ones
[00:37:46] that were the foil posters how's it
[00:37:48] going today bud tiger riic I love the
[00:37:51] name is it tiger rific or tiger rific or
[00:37:54] am I even reading that wrong and it's
[00:37:56] not even supposed to be that
[00:38:00] I'm probably even reading it and
[00:38:01] butchering it completely bad the second
[00:38:04] tigor rfic all right I like it but yeah
[00:38:07] I'll show you like here like I collected
[00:38:09] all of the posters I wonder if I have
[00:38:10] them all right here I don't know if

[00:42:20] anyways don't worry about it hey thank
[00:42:21] you Mike I appreciate that you know what
[00:42:24] I was going to go and cancel the auction
[00:42:25] too but you know what thank you I
[00:42:27] appreciate that Mike thankk you that is
[00:42:28] a good guy my friend do appreciate that
[00:42:32] and I can cancel it Mike too don't worry
[00:42:35] about it I'm I'm not
[00:42:37] worried we're just hanging out here all
[00:42:40] right so the Wasteland Adventure you'll
[00:42:42] see that right now it's actually really
[00:42:44] fun so the way we do this is you with
[00:42:48] these packs here this is going to get
[00:42:50] you we're going to call this to strength
[00:42:52] just to start the Wasteland Adventure
[00:42:54] off today all right so what this will do
[00:42:56] is it start you off with two strength of
[00:42:58] your character and generally what the
[00:43:00] packs are just give me one second to get
[00:43:01] these cards away so that I'm not uh I
[00:43:04] don't have them in the way here all
[00:43:06] right put that over here so generally
[00:43:08] what we'll do here is you pick a
[00:43:10] character and you have two strength to
[00:43:13] start with your
[00:43:14] character all
[00:43:18] right Ah that's that's a little
[00:43:21] frustrating that's a little frustrating
[00:43:24] yeah let's R some packs I like that idea
[00:43:26] so so what you do is you would pick one
[00:43:28] of your characters you can see kind of
[00:43:29] at the top there all right and once you
[00:43:32] have your character picked you would go
[00:43:34] through this Wasteland Adventure where
[00:43:36] you start out with two strength here and
[00:43:38] what happens is there's three different
[00:43:40] boxes you choose from red green and blue
[00:43:43] you pick one card from each each one of
[00:43:45] them gives you either a plus or one or
[00:43:47] minus one strength depending on what
[00:43:48] character you've chosen all right and
[00:43:52] then if you're lucky enough you can beat
[00:43:54] one of the 10 bosses here and depending
[00:43:56] on how much strength you could either be
[00:43:58] up to 60% of the bosses or none of the
[00:44:02] bosses if you have depending on the
[00:44:03] amount of strength you get by the end of
[00:44:05] the adventure now you can only get one
[00:44:08] strength in each one of these boxes here
[00:44:10] so this could only get up to five
[00:44:12] strength so you could only beat 40% of
[00:44:15] the bosses that are in there but with
[00:44:17] that being said that's kind of how it
[00:44:19] goes there now if you look in the
[00:44:22] um if you look at the frequent last
[00:44:24] questions I actually have it actually
[00:44:26] explained in there too so that you can
[00:44:28] actually understand that also so that's
[00:44:30] also another way that you can see that
[00:44:32] but yeah that's a little Adventure that
[00:44:33] we have and then we do a little animated
[00:44:34] thing so say Mike decides he wants to be
[00:44:36] a tech he'll be a technician wandering
[00:44:38] through the Wasteland like that all
[00:44:40] right nice cool animated adventure and
[00:44:43] we'll go through each one of the steps
[00:44:45] with an animation seeing what
[00:44:50] happens all right Mike thank you you're
[00:44:53] going to be a detective I like it
[00:45:00] Mike there's a
[00:45:01] detective walking through this Wasteland
[00:45:05] here all right as a
[00:45:08] detective where would you like to go my

[00:55:16] towards anything we do make it better we
[00:55:18] make things better so everybody has more
[00:55:20] fun and one of the things that I did was
[00:55:22] I bought a new camera now here actually
[00:55:24] you know here let me see if I can show
[00:55:25] it you right there see the camera there
[00:55:28] you can see right there that's what I
[00:55:31] ended up buying it's a Sony
[00:55:33] um Sony
[00:55:36] um
[00:55:38] zv 1 M2 it's the Mach 2 but it was an
[00:55:42] open box so like I bought the zv1 and it
[00:55:45] didn't work right to connect to the
[00:55:46] computer so I ended up buying the

[00:55:51] and when I went to Best Buy they I was
[00:55:53] looking up on Best Buy online they had

[00:56:05] the zv2 and this thing's freaking
[00:56:07] awesome I love
[00:56:09] it yeah it was like uh I mean it was 600
[00:56:12] bucks but my family can use it when we

[01:01:28] hard try to gr a c but you hate [ __ ] and
[01:01:31] cut three stitch oh wow nice yeah so I
[01:01:34] was able like I used to uh snowboard
[01:01:38] pretty frequently just I lived in New
[01:01:39] England so I used to I had a um I used
[01:01:41] when I was in college I got the all e
[01:01:42] pass so I would go up every weekend and
[01:01:45] even on like drive the car up because
[01:01:47] they were like an hour away go
[01:01:48] snowboarding all day long come back to
[01:01:50] college cuz where I lived I was at
[01:01:52] University of New Hampshire and I'd go
[01:01:54] to like LOM mountain or like one of the
[01:01:56] mountains I was on there so I would run
[01:01:58] up there and Snowboard for the entire
[01:02:00] day come back and by the time like the
[01:02:02] end of the you know college was over
[01:02:04] over I was able to go down the skate the
[01:02:05] snowboard part and go off every single
[01:02:07] one of the jumps grind down stuff do
[01:02:10] some pretty cool grinds jump off the end
[01:02:11] of them and like do like a like I used

[01:02:31] audio
[01:02:32] up and then jump off and do like a 180
[01:02:35] nope the audio was good so I actually
[01:02:38] was decent with snowboarding but when I
[01:02:40] got older no one wanted to go with me
[01:02:43] and then you start like having jobs
[01:02:46] where you don't have the time to go and
[01:02:48] you know all that stuff happens and you
[01:02:50] know life occurs and then you don't do
[01:02:53] it anymore and then then you move to
[01:02:55] Florida and there's no
[01:02:57] snow and you go fishing and do that type
[01:02:59] of stuff and then instead and then after

[01:19:20] that's how I am I've always been that
[01:19:21] type of person one of my favorite things
[01:19:23] was meeting people from from everywhere
[01:19:25] just because like here's here's an
[01:19:27] example of something that I got
[01:19:28] extremely upset about when I was very
[01:19:30] young actually I wasn't young I was 16
[01:19:33] uh my best friend was uh his he's half
[01:19:35] Japanese uh from growing up and his
[01:19:37] grandmother invited me out of all his
[01:19:41] friends me to go to Japan with him to
[01:19:46] meet his
[01:19:47] family I'm like Mom I'm invited to go to
[01:19:50] Japan for like two weeks this is awesome
[01:19:52] I'm going I have the money to do it I've
[01:19:54] been working blah blah blah blah
[01:19:57] blah no she had none of it refused I'm
[01:20:01] almost flew and already look at
[01:20:03] that refused so like those are the
[01:20:07] things like I always want to go and
[01:20:08] learn like if I was going to be able to
[01:20:09] live with somebody that's a family there
[01:20:11] and learn from them but you know that's
[01:20:14] why I'm like you know what now I'm an
[01:20:15] adult I can do that myself and I can
[01:20:17] travel around and do those
[01:20:22] things let's see let's put out the
[01:20:25] this with one of
[01:20:27] these do one and a half strength to
[01:20:29] start your adventure in the
[01:20:34] Wasteland we'll call it oh I got to hold
[01:20:36] these up here so you can take a
[01:20:41] picture oh nice that's a good place to
[01:20:43] go to
[01:20:45] visit my uh the thing that was yeah it
[01:20:47] did kind of suck like I had the money
[01:20:49] and everything to do it and like you
[01:20:50] know later in life I talked to her I'm
[01:20:52] like y she's like well I was scared I'm
[01:20:53] like yeah you were scared that somebody
[01:20:55] you weren't scared like she was scared
[01:20:57] like something was going to happen I'm
[01:20:58] like I'm with somebody's
[01:21:01] family like what is going to happen she
[01:21:03] like well I'm not going to be able to
[01:21:04] know you far away like so that doesn't
[01:21:07] matter if you can know about me far away
[01:21:10] like well I don't know what was going to
[01:21:11] happen like did you trust me she's like
[01:21:13] yes I trusted you I'm like well if you
[01:21:15] trusted me then you should have known we
[01:21:17] wouldn't have had a problem because I
[01:21:18] would have been doing the right thing
[01:21:20] and getting away from a bad
[01:21:21] situation and like and that's why try to
[01:21:24] do with my kids like right recently
[01:21:26] they've been allowed to ride their bikes
[01:21:28] down the road to go and visit uh hang to
[01:21:31] meet another friend from school at the
[01:21:33] end of the road and then they go to a
[01:21:35] house that's probably about a mile away
[01:21:36] on their bike so that they can go and
[01:21:39] play in the yard with that friend maybe
[01:21:41] one for like an hour or
[01:21:43] so zero problems at all they need to
[01:21:46] call us when they're there to let us
[01:21:47] know that they got there they need to
[01:21:49] call us when they leave to let us know
[01:21:50] they're
[01:21:51] leaving very simple I can do that one
[01:21:54] myself call there's phones all around
[01:21:55] the world but anyways that's what I try
[01:21:57] and they do that so they get the chance
[01:21:59] and they respect to do those things CU
[01:22:01] they respect our
[01:22:05] rules yeah I mean they're 10 and eight
[01:22:08] they're it's a it's a closed development
[01:22:10] with sidewalks and literally there's a
[01:22:13] guard and the only place they're riding
[01:22:15] is right outside the guard house to the
[01:22:17] second house outside the guard house so
[01:22:18] we're like you know what we're okay with
[01:22:20] that but my point is I'm trying to be
[01:22:23] nice and do the things
[01:22:25] like if you if I if my if I trust my
[01:22:28] children then I should trust them to
[01:22:30] make the right choice and no matter the
[01:22:32] situation they're
[01:22:34] in whether it is a good or a bad
[01:22:37] situation if they're my children I know
[01:22:39] I trust them at that point I look at
[01:22:41] them and I go you know what I trust you
[01:22:44] they're going to look at that situation
[01:22:45] where there's either drugs or alcohol or
[01:22:46] whatever is going on yeah it might be a
[01:22:48] party can tolerate then but maybe
[01:22:50] there's somebody leaving and they're
[01:22:51] going to get in the car with them well
[01:22:52] they know that's a bad choice then you
[01:22:54] know that if they call Mom and Dad that
[01:22:56] we might be mad but
[01:22:59] we'll be happy and they won't actually
[01:23:01] be in trouble we may make them do a
[01:23:03] little bit extra chores type thing you
[01:23:10] know yeah exactly bring me some gifts
[01:23:12] second time like you bring me gifts yeah
[01:23:15] so that's what I mean that's that that's
[01:23:16] the type of thing I'm talking about I
[01:23:17] don't know we'll
[01:23:20] see but if you'd like we do have those
[01:23:23] mystery bags up there in our Wasteland
[01:23:25] Adventure currently up at the moment for
[01:23:28] those of you that may want to try it
[01:23:30] out thank you demon rabbit for coming in
[01:23:32] and hanging out we uh do some games here
[01:23:37] as you can see we have those out there
[01:23:39] now the games are actually animated
[01:23:41] which is the cool part about it so like
[01:23:43] you would pick a character here all
[01:23:45] right and then that
[01:23:48] character maybe a technician would
[01:23:50] wander through the Wasteland depending
[01:23:53] on what you pick pick out of the boxes
[01:23:55] here is how your character uh interacts
[01:23:59] with the Wasteland here
[01:24:02] maybe you find a friend along the way to
[01:24:06] help you or
[01:24:09] maybe you get an enemy as a mutiny that
[01:24:11] you need to face off
[01:24:13] against we're not sure but it's up to
[01:24:16] you if you want to play that Adventure
[01:24:17] game
[01:24:19] here pretty fun we have a good time with
[01:24:22] it right now though it's up and remember
[01:24:23] you guys can choose whatever packs you
[01:24:25] want it's not specifically those it's
[01:24:27] just those are up there because that's
[01:24:28] the random ones that I put out at the
[01:24:30] moment but I have all kinds of stuff in
[01:24:32] my um shop so if you want one pack two
[01:24:35] packs four packs let me
[01:24:40] know and each pack if you want to make
[01:24:43] your own when you build your own that is
[01:24:46] what the packs are worth and that's
[01:24:47] actually the price of all our packs
[01:24:49] too if you want to jump in on any of
[01:24:52] them yourself
[01:24:54] so I have some fun here I do some pretty
[01:24:56] cool things I at least try to do some
[01:24:57] what I think is cool
[01:25:00] things I'm actually I have um these cool
[01:25:02] dice I'm finally going to get to use
[01:25:03] them I think when we do our adventure
[01:25:05] game I might finally get to use these I
[01:25:07] haven't had a really chance to use them
[01:25:09] I I bought these and then I never
[01:25:11] actually use them when we're playing any
[01:25:12] of our
[01:25:13] games because uh I just don't use them I
[01:25:16] don't get to use them because we have
[01:25:17] the dice at the store whenever I go to
[01:25:19] the store so I don't need to use these
[01:25:21] ones so that's nice there we get to but
[01:25:23] these are cool like I don't know what
[01:25:25] you'd call them they're like crystal
[01:25:26] blue oh I like them that's why I bought
[01:25:31] them dude I know they're awesome colored
[01:25:34] I know look at those like little blue
[01:25:36] and goldish I mean blue and uh Crystal
[01:25:39] thing
[01:25:41] there I don't know I thought they were
[01:25:42] cool like blue crystals it reminded me
[01:25:44] like blue crystals in a way like
[01:25:46] crystals had a little bit of a blue in
[01:25:48] them I don't know I thought they were
[01:25:50] cool that's why I picked them up they
[01:25:52] were they weren't cheap but so be
[01:25:56] it I got a few of
[01:25:59] them but anyways we'll be using those
[01:26:02] those are uh if you see any of these
[01:26:04] things that's what the brand is that I
[01:26:05] got them from from the U my local store

[01:26:11] like them a lot and they're one of those
[01:26:12] things that it's might not be cheap but
[01:26:14] it's kind of worth it if you use them

[01:34:45] we're going to do a little zoom in like
[01:34:47] we did
[01:34:50] before zoom in there we go nice little

[01:35:13] Willow Nadar selfless Paladin it's a
[01:35:16] nice little hit
[01:35:18] there oh Inferno of the star mounts
[01:35:22] there you go
[01:35:24] that's a nice Mythic Dragon for
[01:35:27] you a Rog class foil that's not a bad
[01:35:30] one there either and then your uh your
[01:35:33] token that was a nice pack there
[01:35:36] dude a Mythic and a foil
[01:35:40] rare The Infernal of the star mounts
[01:35:43] that is a really good card dude spell
[01:35:46] can't be countered flying haste Inferno
[01:35:49] gets plus one plus zero until end of
[01:35:50] turn when the power becomes 20 this way
[01:35:53] it
[01:35:54] deals uh it deals 20 damage to any
[01:35:57] Target that's
[01:35:59] insane you can add as much to it that is
[01:36:02] an insane
[01:36:03] card that is an awesome card my son's
[01:36:06] gonna be jealous of that
[01:36:09] Dyno here we go put that in a top loader
[01:36:13] then let's open your next
[01:36:16] pack this is where we pull out a ragab
[01:36:18] on because I just pulled you out
[01:36:19] something awesome there too right we'll

[01:36:45] know because you'll have more strength
[01:36:47] than what is on the bottom of the boss
[01:36:49] so see right here six for their you know
[01:36:52] seven just literally based on the boss
[01:36:55] six so if you can get Mei and you have
[01:36:58] two and a half you would have beaten Mei
[01:37:01] or if you were had the two and a half
[01:37:02] and he had gotten Owen out he would have
[01:37:04] beaten Owen so that's how it goes there
[01:37:07] for your W for how you can beat any of
[01:37:08] the bosses there yep that's what it is
[01:37:12] literally the card thems and what is on
[01:37:16] the card for how you can beat the boss
[01:37:18] and the amount of strength based on the
[01:37:19] strength that you have

[02:00:57] reason why we uh we changed up what
[02:00:59] we're doing in our lives we were going
[02:01:01] to hang out here for a while but I
[02:01:02] decided to do our boat trip earlier when
[02:01:05] my wife got some news from her job that
[02:01:07] she wasn't unhappy about about stuff
[02:01:08] changing like she's not going to have
[02:01:10] the same boss anymore they're getting
[02:01:11] rid of her boss type stuff
[02:01:14] so and she doesn't necessarily like the
[02:01:16] person she doesn't know the person but
[02:01:18] she doesn't necessarily like them she
[02:01:19] used dealt with them a few times and
[02:01:20] wasn't unhappy with the person that's
[02:01:21] now going to be boss so she's like great
[02:01:23] I just got forced into a new position
[02:01:25] for the most part and I am um so she's
[02:01:29] unhappy and I'm unhappy and I think
[02:01:30] we're going to we're looking and going
[02:01:32] on a boat here we're going to be on a
[02:01:34] boat hopefully in the next uh 6 months

[02:02:45] there I grew her initially there until
[02:02:46] um a crazy issue occurred where someone
[02:02:50] lied and I proved proved they lied with
[02:02:52] evidence and I was
[02:02:54] ignored I literally showed a screenshot
[02:02:57] saying this person lied there's no way
[02:03:00] that you can tell me that this is a
[02:03:01] problem when it's literally on screen
[02:03:03] right now and I the only reason I was
[02:03:05] able to do the screenshot is because I
[02:03:06] save everything on

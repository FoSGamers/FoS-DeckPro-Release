My current wife and I cannot afford to go to a lawyer unless she has a stash of money I'm unaware of, so I need you to write up divorce papers, um, for us.

I can draft a **basic divorce agreement** that outlines the **terms of your separation**, including **division of assets, debts, child custody (if applicable), and spousal support**. However, divorce laws vary by **state (or country, if outside the U.S.)**, so you'll need to check your local court's requirements to ensure the document is legally binding.  

### To create the most accurate document, I'll need the following details:  

1. **State of Residence** (or country, if outside the U.S.).  
2. **Full Legal Names** of both parties.  
3. **Date of Marriage** and, if applicable, **Date of Separation**.  
4. **Do you have children together?** (Yes/No). If yes:  
   - Names & birthdates.  
   - Custody arrangement preference (joint, sole, etc.).  
   - Child support expectations.  
5. **Assets & Property** (Home, vehicles, bank accounts, retirement accounts, investments, etc.):  
   - Will you divide them equally, or does one person keep specific items?  
6. **Debts** (Mortgages, car loans, credit cards, etc.):  
   - How will they be divided?  
7. **Spousal Support**:  
   - Will either party pay alimony? If so, how much and for how long?  
8. **Other Agreements**:  
   - Do you want a no-contact clause, name change agreement, or anything else included?  

Once I have these details, I can draft a **divorce settlement agreement** that you can **file with your local family court**. Let me know how you'd like to proceed.

We live in Florida. I'll give you the full names in a little bit. We were married July 9th, 2011. Children, we do have two of them, William and Nolan. She can take them because I'm not going to be doing anything that any of them want to do. I'm not going to have any money to give them expectations for child support. She's taking the money from the selling of the house, from the loan. So, she can keep all of that, and I'm done with them. The only thing that I would have to do is have to pay off my truck loan so I have something. And she can deal with everything else. No spousal support. And I don't want to have her contact me ever. The children can if they want, but I never want her to contact me. I don't want selfish people in my life.

No, the truck will be paid for, so there is no loan, and I will get the truck.

[00:00:13] issues today. Freaking computer. I don't
[00:00:18] know. It said it wasn't wouldn't let me
[00:00:19] in. My password was not working. I typed
[00:00:22] it in multiple times and it wasn't
[00:00:24] working. I watched myself type it in one
[00:00:27] letter at a time.
[00:00:30] like, you know, like that old dude that
[00:00:32] doesn't know what they're
[00:00:33] doing. Still nothing.
[00:00:37] Then I got locked out. Had to step away
[00:00:39] for a bit. But now I'm here. So, we'll
[00:00:43] uh we'll start this morning with some
[00:00:46] fun. What we're doing today is uh we
[00:00:49] have some of our taris
[00:00:53] in. I know. Damn young people in their
[00:00:56] technology, broki. I know
[00:01:00] freaking but anyways we'll start off

[00:01:05] in here. We have some uh some play
[00:01:06] boosters and we also have some um some
[00:01:09] of the other sets that I have available.

[00:01:22] with us for a bit. We got uh let's see.
[00:01:25] I know some of you have been uh hanging
[00:01:27] around in the the burnt out city here.
[00:01:30] So, you know, around those buildings.
[00:01:33] Now, we have a uh where did I put it?
[00:01:36] Hopefully, I have it
[00:01:46] still. Where do I have
[00:01:49] it? I think we got it over here.
[00:01:57] Aha, that's where it is. That's our
[00:01:59] specialized one

[00:02:18] is. So, we got our
[00:02:21] locations. that you guys have been
[00:02:22] hanging around
[00:02:24] in. You got your armory, your vault
[00:02:28] first
[00:02:29] vault. You've got your
[00:02:32] um Where did they go? The armory. You
[00:02:36] guys are hanging out. Maybe you guys
[00:02:38] want to uh grab a pack. Let's open
[00:02:41] something here. I'm going to grab these
[00:02:43] and open anything cuz we already were
[00:02:45] planning on doing something
[00:02:49] here. Yeah, I know. Oh, that's crazy. I
[00:02:51] know. I saw it. I saw how it skyrocketed
[00:02:53] and it's just insane. Like crazy how it
[00:02:57] went like that. So, what I'm going to do
[00:03:00] today is we're going to do
[00:03:01] this. I think we're going to see. You
[00:03:05] guys have it in the buy now. If you want
[00:03:06] to go in, there are um the packs
[00:03:08] available if you want to look. Let's uh
[00:03:11] you should be able to see them. Let's do
[00:03:14] this.
[00:03:20] I think this will allow you to see
[00:03:25] them a little better. Here we
[00:03:29] go. Do that if you want to get any of
[00:03:31] the uh collector's boosters, my friends.
[00:03:34] How's it going, Big BK? Hopefully you're
[00:03:37] having a good one this morning. We're
[00:03:39] just getting up and
[00:03:41] started. Ah, going with a collector, I
[00:03:44] see. I like it. Let's open one of those
[00:03:46] babies
[00:03:47] up. Good start to the
[00:03:50] morning. Hopefully you're doing well.
[00:03:53] Sorry, I had a had a late start myself.
[00:03:56] Let me uh put this over here of those.
[00:03:58] Let's get to this now. Which one do you
[00:04:00] want? Which which one should you open? I
[00:04:02] was going to open this one here, the
[00:04:03] first one. But you want to change it up.
[00:04:05] We can go any of those. You're the first
[00:04:06] of
[00:04:10] them. Damn it. Why doesn't I always put
[00:04:13] you to moderate but it doesn't I have to
[00:04:15] do it regularly. We're going to go with
[00:04:17] this one then. Ah, let's do it.
[00:04:22] L2. It didn't open. That's the second
[00:04:25] time that didn't cut through, but it
[00:04:27] made a cut on the box. That's this
[00:04:29] plastic's been rough recently. I guess
[00:04:32] it doesn't want to open anymore. L2, my

[00:13:22] Let me get some of these into the
[00:13:23] sleeves for you, my friends.
[00:13:27] Every time you buy a booster, you get in
[00:13:28] trouble. Hey, you know what? I have I
[00:13:31] don't have the best luck in the world,
[00:13:32] my friend.
[00:13:34] Hey, you know, it's it's lucky that she
[00:13:35] kind of likes it. She uh it was she was
[00:13:37] reading a deck uh a book. Um it was like
[00:13:39] a bestselling book and a lot of women
[00:13:40] were reading it, but it had something to
[00:13:41] do with like fairies and dragons. So,
[00:13:43] she started paying a little bit more
[00:13:45] attention to it. And then I was playing
[00:13:47] a deck that was like a fairy deck and
[00:13:48] she got intrigued by it. And from that
[00:13:51] point on, she's kind of something then
[00:13:53] with the dragons because it has to do
[00:13:54] with fairies and dragons in the book and
[00:13:55] stuff. It kind of goes along with it.
[00:13:58] Jack's always
[00:14:00] um it should say in the um description
[00:14:03] on what it is specifically. So uh there
[00:14:06] we go my friend Master Ogre and let me
[00:14:09] put in the uh
[00:14:14] your I'm going put smite death in with
[00:14:16] your mountain. Oh wait, you're awaken.
[00:14:18] Awaken the honored with your mountain is
[00:14:20] what we're putting in together here.
[00:14:22] That was a nice looking one. Keeping a
[00:14:24] top loader that way we can keep them.
[00:14:26] Um, yeah, if you look at it, it should
[00:14:28] say specifically in the description that
[00:14:30] it would be like retrofoil. Um, that's I
[00:14:32] just named the card in there and then it
[00:14:34] will say that. So, uh, if you have I can
[00:14:36] take a look though, but I'm not I think
[00:14:39] one of them might have been, but I don't
[00:14:41] know if I sold that one a while ago.

[00:22:10] somebody that isn't working there or
[00:22:12] something like that and kids opening
[00:22:13] things. So that's why we do it. We have
[00:22:15] to have them pick it out at least, but
[00:22:16] then we open it. So we going to have
[00:22:18] Nolan's is going

[00:22:50] two three four five six seven eight. I
[00:22:53] figure they're going to get reprinted at
[00:22:54] some point anyways cuz commander decks
[00:22:56] generally get at least one more reprint.
[00:22:57] So I was going to figure I'd wait and we
[00:22:59] can buy them then. All right, here we
[00:23:01] go. Good luck everybody. My friend
[00:23:02] gnome. We have a

[00:24:20] out. Here on out. Oh, really? So,
[00:24:22] they're not going to reprint the decks.
[00:24:23] Ah, I didn't know that. Well, that makes
[00:24:26] sense why they're uh they're so high
[00:24:27] then and they sold out a
[00:24:30] bunch. When did that I didn't remember
[00:24:32] hearing that

[00:24:51] decks. Interesting. So, what they then
[00:24:53] they just got printing their their
[00:24:55] amount that come out in play boosters
[00:24:57] and collector boosters and decks and
[00:24:59] that's it. All right. All right, good
[00:25:01] luck. There you go, my friend. Not bad
[00:25:02] on those ones. And let's get you to the
[00:25:05] one from Those were We'll put those

[00:33:24] like I was making sure we had it and got
[00:33:26] it for you. So, let me uh let me get
[00:33:28] this together. And Hanburg, there
[00:33:31] shouldn't be a Bloomberg left. There
[00:33:33] might be one Bloomberg left. Actually,
[00:33:34] let me double check. If there if it
[00:33:36] shows it in there, I might have to uh if
[00:33:37] that was shown was in there, I might
[00:33:39] have to refund you on that one. I'm
[00:33:40] sorry. But let me get Gnome's rule
[00:33:42] written
[00:33:46] down. Nice pick up there, dude. Those
[00:33:50] are awesome cards. Uh yeah, it's a good
[00:33:52] it'll be a good artifact deck. Good for
[00:33:54] the artifact deck.
[00:33:57] Definitely. I have uh we got another
[00:34:00] friend that's made an artifact deck,
[00:34:02] too. There you go. Gnome's rule. All
[00:34:05] right, my friend. That was an awesome
[00:34:07] hit. I know. A serialized Mox res. That
[00:34:10] would be huge. All right, so we have
[00:34:13] that. I think if I have one left, it's
[00:34:15] here. If not, that was be somehow it
[00:34:18] copied over and I thought I removed
[00:34:19] them, but maybe I
[00:34:27] didn't. No, that was not there. I don't
[00:34:30] know why there's any Bloomber in my
[00:34:32] store right now other than Play
[00:34:34] Boosters. There should only be Play
[00:34:36] boosters there. Hanberg, give me a
[00:34:37] minute there. I'm going to have to take
[00:34:39] care of that one very
[00:34:40] quickly. Um, I'm sorry. I have to refund
[00:34:44] you on that. I don't know why the it
[00:34:46] even said I had one of those in here
[00:34:49] because I don't I know I I know I got uh
[00:34:52] sold one recently. So, I'm sorry about
[00:34:54] that. Um but what I I'm going to do
[00:34:57] quickly and I'm going to go make sure my
[00:34:59] inventory has it correct
[00:35:01] now cuz I don't understand why it's
[00:35:08] not No, there's none in there. There
[00:35:10] must have been somehow one that moved
[00:35:12] over or something like that. I am sorry
[00:35:14] about that,
[00:35:17] Hanberg. I don't know why it even showed
[00:35:19] that. I don't even why it even showed
[00:35:24] that
[00:35:27] 36. Where's
[00:35:33] um I just canceled it, my
[00:35:39] friend. That's fine. You can grab some
[00:35:41] singles. Definitely going through the
[00:35:42] singles.
[00:35:47] Yeah, I had canceled it because I was
[00:35:48] like I I know I didn't have it. So, that
[00:35:51] was a nice
[00:35:52] hit. Oh, zero and 23 on collectors so
[00:35:56] far. That's not the best then. That's
[00:35:59] not the greatest of luck. I'm
[00:36:01] sorry. Who was the emotes guy
[00:36:04] in the background?
[00:36:08] All right. It's been brutal.
[00:36:12] Well, let's do
[00:36:14] um let's do this here. I was opening
[00:36:16] this up earlier. No one was jumping in
[00:36:19] on uh we had the packs. Those there
[00:36:21] still if anybody wants some packs. We
[00:36:23] had some nice hits in this. We have a
[00:36:25] one, two, four
[00:36:27] left. Gosh cheerios.
[00:36:31] I was wondering what the smell was.
[00:36:35] That's
[00:36:37] fine. I know. It's good to see the TCGs
[00:36:40] out doing some things. I
[00:36:44] know. Oh, wow. Guys, that's just like It
[00:36:48] seems like some I get what you mean. You
[00:36:50] guys have some luck that's just not
[00:36:51] happen to not be running for this set or
[00:36:54] something. I've been there before. I've
[00:36:56] been in that situation before. All
[00:36:58] right, we're going to run some of our
[00:37:00] things. We're going to run this manage.
[00:37:03] We're going to do our game here. We'll
[00:37:05] run some of that.
[00:37:07] All right, we have our tar. There's even
[00:37:09] a collector in there. Oh, we're going to
[00:37:12] go with some more collectors. I like it.
[00:37:14] I like
[00:37:15] it. Going to go with two more. I like
[00:37:19] it, my friend. Gnome. All right. Uh, we
[00:37:23] are thinking of going to pre-release uh
[00:37:25] potentially on Sunday because that way
[00:37:26] we can do the two-headed giant with the
[00:37:27] kids and stuff.
[00:37:30] Yeah, the cards are really cool. My pick
[00:37:32] this time. All right. Here we go.
[00:37:37] We're going to go with this one.
[00:37:41] No, you can't it later.
[00:37:44] We're going with this one. All right,
[00:37:46] here we go.
[00:37:48] Those two. Those two. They're good.
[00:37:51] They're good. He says, "Yeah, they're
[00:37:53] good." Oh, no worries. That stinks about
[00:37:56] not being able to get in. Maybe they'll
[00:37:57] do the
[00:37:58] um pre-release, though. The cars do look
[00:38:02] cool.
[00:38:05] I know the collector boosters. I
[00:38:08] know the cards are looking really good.
[00:38:11] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[00:38:14] eight. It's one of those things where
[00:38:15] the set just looks nice, right? And it's
[00:38:17] not even if whatever whatever you get
[00:38:18] with the cards, they're they're nice
[00:38:19] looking cards. Then you got these nice
[00:38:22] feral death gorgger. Nice. Like the
[00:38:25] showcase ones are sweet, I think. Kyak
[00:38:28] Karak Guardian,
[00:38:31] shocking sharpshooter. Roying Dragon
[00:38:33] Storm, Rain Victor, Champion of Duchon,
[00:38:38] Ducan, Ducan, Salt Road, Packbe Beast,
[00:38:42] Cruel Truths, Riing, Dawn Breaker in the
[00:38:46] Showcase Foil. I like that one. There's
[00:38:48] a nice Forest and Foil. Then you have an
[00:38:51] inevitable defeat for your first rare
[00:38:53] foil there. Will of Abazan in the
[00:38:57] extended art. That one was a few bucks
[00:38:59] earlier.
[00:39:00] Baron Steep Siege. Oo, I like the look
[00:39:03] of that enchantment there, buddy. Nice
[00:39:06] borderless, Avenger of the Fallen in the
[00:39:09] in the clan card
[00:39:11] there. The Sibig ceremony foil in the
[00:39:16] clan card with for your last foil there
[00:39:18] and a spirit token. Hey, Cage. How's it
[00:39:23] going, my friend? Hopefully you're
[00:39:24] having a good one. Let's get some of
[00:39:27] these things taken care of. putting his
[00:39:29] sleeves like we do and then we're gonna
[00:39:30] open up your other pack right
[00:39:33] after.
[00:39:35] Chilling like a villain. I'm guessing
[00:39:37] that that uh enchantment is going to be
[00:39:40] a nice hit
[00:39:41] there. The uh Baron Siege. Baron's Deep
[00:39:46] Siege. That's my guess. I haven't looked
[00:39:48] this price that I haven't seen that one
[00:39:50] yet to get a price of it. So that's my
[00:39:52] guess is this is your hit out of that
[00:39:54] pack. Let's go and see what you get here
[00:39:56] in this one. All right. Good luck, my
[00:39:58] friend.

[00:45:26] love the uh dragons. My one of my sons
[00:45:28] loves the deck. Oh, you're deep into the
[00:45:30] an adventure for today. Yes, you are. So
[00:45:35] you Yeah, you are going um you're going
[00:45:38] big BK. You're wandering
[00:45:40] around. Broki, broki, let's see where
[00:45:43] you
[00:45:44] were. Broki, I have you
[00:45:56] got
[00:46:02] Where was that?
[00:46:12] I don't know why that got in there.
[00:46:18] Eat it. It looks like you have a pistol.
[00:46:21] Two
[00:46:22] pistols. Uh you have four Pogs. They're
[00:46:25] just wandering around. There was no
[00:46:26] specific place you were, broki. You
[00:46:28] weren't anywhere specific.
[00:46:32] Then we have Silver Sneak hanging out in
[00:46:33] there. I like it. Silver Sneak hanging
[00:46:36] out having some fun. I'm not sure about
[00:46:38] the OOS. Let me know. Let me uh let me
[00:46:40] check that out.
[00:46:41] Ryzel. Um that's intriguing there on
[00:46:46] that. We have our own a few of our own
[00:46:48] serialized too. I'll keep running uh the
[00:46:51] game here. People want a trumpment. I
[00:46:52] believe at
[00:46:54] least you're in the army. Okay. I
[00:46:57] couldn't remember where you were. I know
[00:46:58] you were wandering around specifically
[00:46:59] here. It's the armory here cuz I know
[00:47:01] somebody was in there and somebody had
[00:47:03] left. I couldn't remember if it was you.
[00:47:05] So, we have Broki. You're in the armory.
[00:47:08] Our buddy Big
[00:47:10] BK is uh just got back to the Valdorn
[00:47:14] location. Found out not all the codes
[00:47:15] worked cuz he was talking to the handy
[00:47:17] helperbot. The helperbot was like, "You
[00:47:20] have some but not
[00:47:22] all." We have Halloween is still in the
[00:47:24] armory. All right, there we go. So,
[00:47:26] that's where you guys are all hanging
[00:47:28] out right now in that armory there. So,
[00:47:29] this is why if you guys watch the um the
[00:47:31] shorts, you'd understand some of what's
[00:47:33] going on cuz uh we have a little bit of
[00:47:36] background now. So, so I figured since
[00:47:37] we hit a million views, gave a little
[00:47:39] background. You were wandering around.
[00:47:41] You were running around Silver Sneak. I
[00:47:43] know that you had headed out of the um
[00:47:45] you had headed out of the Vault
[00:47:47] area. Yes, you joined the Fang, the Iron
[00:47:50] Fang. That is correct. You had joined
[00:47:53] the Iron Fang, which were the ones that
[00:47:54] had taken over the Vaultorn Armory, the
[00:47:56] uh you're they are the like the
[00:47:58] raiders. That is
[00:48:01] correct. Thank you, Risel. I have a good
[00:48:04] one. Have a good one. I appreciate you
[00:48:06] hanging out. Yeah. So, we do our D and D
[00:48:08] game, our adventure here. So, now we
[00:48:10] have our buddy Big BK. You uh you had to
[00:48:13] go wandering out, look for some more
[00:48:14] things. Uh you have a Silver Sneak is
[00:48:16] definitely wandering around. They they
[00:48:17] sneak all over the place.
[00:48:20] We had a friend that was the Pied Piper
[00:48:22] JM. Then we had another friend, Miss
[00:48:25] Roxy, that came in when was a dwarf
[00:48:27] dwarf helping everyone else. So, uh,
[00:48:30] let's see what you guys are doing
[00:48:32] today. So, Big BK,
[00:48:37] uh, we can do one today. I was going to
[00:48:39] have, uh, I was going to have I actually
[00:48:41] had that as a little bit of a plan
[00:48:43] today for that. That was part of the the
[00:48:47] 1 million celebrations.
[00:48:49] So you have a burnt out building you're
[00:48:51] wandering around you.
[00:48:55] Um ah yeah see then we have your armory
[00:48:59] you have here you you know what's going
[00:49:01] on in these places. Now one of the
[00:49:03] things though is when you're wandering
[00:49:04] you um with your codes that you found
[00:49:07] you hear you um there's some weird
[00:49:09] things going on in the area. some
[00:49:11] rumbles and odd stuff all of a sudden.
[00:49:13] And
[00:49:16] then whereas my stuff's just going
[00:49:18] really slow. You bump into that weird
[00:49:22] stray ghoul
[00:49:25] again. It's wandering around. And this
[00:49:27] is a new one. Got some knives. Got
[00:49:29] another knife. Couple of knives. And
[00:49:30] they're w swinging them around. And big
[00:49:33] BK, you see him there again. You can
[00:49:35] decide what you want to do with that
[00:49:37] guy. I know you're wandering there. And
[00:49:38] the other people are wandering that way.
[00:49:39] You're going to follow it. Ah, I see.
[00:49:41] So, you just kind of look at him. You
[00:49:42] let him swing his stuff around and you
[00:49:45] follow that
[00:49:47] guy. All right. And what happens here is
[00:49:51] when you follow
[00:49:56] him, where'd it
[00:50:06] go? There it is.
[00:50:09] gets over this closed dusty uh dusty
[00:50:12] looking door here. Wall here. We can't
[00:50:14] We don't really know what it is. You You
[00:50:16] got it locked. That's what I was trying
[00:50:17] to find there. Now, you do have some
[00:50:20] codes, but it's a wooden door. You can't
[00:50:22] really There's not really anything there
[00:50:23] being a wooden door to get through. You
[00:50:25] need to
[00:50:27] decide what you're going to be doing.
[00:50:30] Busting that d door down. All right. So,
[00:50:32] trying to bust the door down. You have
[00:50:34] Let's see. Big BK's got some strength.
[00:50:37] And you guys are wandering. Some of you
[00:50:38] are wandering in that direction. You
[00:50:39] hear some ruckus going on. Big BK has
[00:50:42] extra on strength and you know what? You
[00:50:45] have some engineering. So, we'll add uh
[00:50:47] and luck. So, we'll add that to the
[00:50:48] rolls. So, that's plus three. So, that
[00:50:50] means you either have a seven or higher
[00:50:52] or a 13 or lower. What one do you want
[00:50:54] to go with? High or low?
[00:50:59] Go. Nay. Thank you, my friend. I
[00:51:01] appreciate it. Always high. All right.
[00:51:07] Well, there you go. You got the high.
[00:51:10] You run through and you break through
[00:51:12] the door. Now, when you break through
[00:51:15] the
[00:51:18] door, you find inside a destroyed
[00:51:23] hallway. Now, at the end of the hallway,
[00:51:26] it's a little uh you got a bit of an
[00:51:27] issue there. You're not exactly sure
[00:51:29] what's going on. It's getting dark in
[00:51:32] there. Now, would you like to continue
[00:51:34] going forward? I know we have some
[00:51:36] people that are or do you want to
[00:51:38] uh go and grab some of your friends that
[00:51:40] are wandering around
[00:51:45] first? What is going on here? Go away.
[00:52:09] Well, thank you for letting me know,
[00:52:10] Ruthless. I appreciate
[00:52:15] that. Ah, you're going to wait. See,
[00:52:17] that's a good idea. That's a good idea.
[00:52:19] I'm just going to let you know it's a
[00:52:20] good idea to wait for some of your
[00:52:21] friends. Silver Sneak's going, "Hey,
[00:52:22] heard some ruckus." And Big BK goes
[00:52:25] outside and it's like, "Yo, help me."
[00:52:28] sees Silver Sneak wandering up. He goes,
[00:52:29] "You're not sneaking so well." Silver
[00:52:32] Sneak goes, "Yeah, you know, I'm not
[00:52:33] trying." You yelled to me, so I'm
[00:52:34] walking this way, man. Anybody else
[00:52:36] going to help our our friend? I know we
[00:52:38] have some others that are in
[00:52:43] here. Oh, you could. Yeah, you could
[00:52:46] try. You could try. That is
[00:52:50] true. That is true.

[00:53:21] out like got a little uh heard a little
[00:53:24] beacon over the radio and starts
[00:53:26] wandering out over towards our friend
[00:53:30] uh and sees Big
[00:53:33] Bk standing with Silver Sneak in the
[00:53:36] distance. Are you going to head out and
[00:53:38] uh you go over to
[00:53:40] them? It's up to you if you do.
[00:54:13] No, it was a It wasn't the pack there
[00:54:15] that I did for the auction. It was a It
[00:54:17] was a single. Oh, you won this pack
[00:54:19] auction. You did Silver Sneak. That one.
[00:54:21] That one. The pack. That pack auction. I
[00:54:23] know you got that one. I thought you
[00:54:24] were talking about the giveaway for some
[00:54:26] reason I ran earlier. I'm like, "No, the
[00:54:27] giveaway was a single. Why do you think
[00:54:28] it was a pack?" Yeah, I know. You got
[00:54:30] it. I just was getting to everybody
[00:54:33] together cuz you said you wanted you
[00:54:36] wanted to you guys were kind of want to
[00:54:37] do your stuff together. So, I was trying
[00:54:38] to get you all together. Blood was the
[00:54:40] one that got the giveaway. That's what
[00:54:42] it was. That's why I got confused. And
[00:54:43] after that, we have Gnome's rule. Came
[00:54:46] in with that and got those ones. So, we
[00:54:48] got the ones for gnomes. So, we have you
[00:54:49] for solar sneak. Yeah, I had you there.
[00:54:51] You did have I do see what you got

[00:54:54] I'm trying to have you come
[00:54:58] together. Yeah. No, I was trying to get
[00:55:00] everybody together. That's what I was
[00:55:02] doing. All right. Here we go.
[00:55:25] That was weird. Let's try that. So, you
[00:55:28] guys are wondering, you see them there.
[00:55:29] Now, you have Silver Snake, Big BK, you

[00:56:48] Dragon Fire Blade. Oo, I haven't seen
[00:56:50] that one yet. That's a new artifact for
[00:56:52] us to
[00:56:53] see. Death begets life. That's an
[00:56:57] intriguing um mythic there. I like that
[00:56:59] one. When you destroy all creatures and
[00:57:01] enchantments, draw a card for each
[00:57:02] opponent or each permanent destroy this
[00:57:04] way. Nice. Underfoot underdogs and a
[00:57:08] foil. Score barons and a foil and a
[00:57:10] copy. I like that card
[00:57:13] there. That's a nice looking uh death
[00:57:17] begets
[00:57:18] life. All right, let me get that there.
[00:57:21] All right, I was trying to get you guys
[00:57:22] all together because you had a minor
[00:57:24] encounter that you had
[00:57:25] triggered. Let me get these in the
[00:57:27] sleeves. Protect your rares there. Not
[00:57:30] bad.
[00:57:33] Got your Red Bull.
[00:57:36] Nice. All right.
[00:57:39] Silver
[00:57:41] snake. All right, put you together
[00:57:44] there. All right, you're all wandering
[00:57:46] around.
[00:57:53] 500.
[00:57:57] I don't mind if they're here. I just
[00:57:59] wait for them to be quiet.
[00:58:12] That's it. All right. There we go. So,
[00:58:15] there you go. You going to have uh you
[00:58:17] definitely want some friends here. All
[00:58:19] right, Silver Sneak, you guys are all
[00:58:22] together.
[00:58:24] You're at the end of that
[00:58:29] uh that um hallway there that was opened
[00:58:32] by the door from our friend and we're
[00:58:35] trying to figure out what's going
[00:58:37] on. Yes, I can bring up the armory map.
[00:58:40] There you go, my friend
[00:58:42] Broki. There you go. All right, that
[00:58:45] wasn't a bad pickup. We'll do another
[00:58:47] one. and you everyone together there at
[00:58:48] Silver Sneak on your way over to um your
[00:58:53] friends
[00:58:55] there. You uh you headed over there and
[00:58:58] you you're talking to your buddy Big BK
[00:59:01] and behind
[00:59:03] you you see
[00:59:12] this. Where'd it go?
[00:59:26] Where'd it
[00:59:33] go? There it is. That's what I was
[00:59:35] looking for. You see that coming around
[00:59:38] scanning things behind everybody trying
[00:59:40] to figure out what's going on. You just
[00:59:43] opened that cave. So maybe uh maybe it
[00:59:45] triggered something. I don't know. It
[00:59:46] was weird. So Silver Sneak, you have the
[00:59:49] opportunity to uh you can either attack
[00:59:51] that, let it go, or who knows all it is.
[00:59:54] Yeah, we're doing a little D and D
[00:59:56] squash that we play. We play some we
[00:59:58] open some Magic the Gathering packs and
[01:00:00] we play like a D and D game with it
[01:00:01] along with it. We have pulled an Ugan.
[01:00:04] We pulled a Japanese borderless Ugan
[01:00:07] Wyatt. That was a really sweet one.
[01:00:09] Uhhuh.
[01:00:11] Go up to it. See what it is. You go up
[01:00:12] to that that uh
[01:00:15] you head over to that scanner and it
[01:00:18] scans you, starts beeping, and then it
[01:00:22] looks like it goes
[01:00:24] uh into a mode where it's either going
[01:00:26] to attack or it considers you an enemy,
[01:00:30] but it hasn't attacked yet. You have a
[01:00:33] choice. So, yeah, we do a D and D game
[01:00:35] that we play. We do some dice rolling on
[01:00:36] screen here, even stuff like that, you
[01:00:39] know. Ah, look at that. We have some fun
[01:00:41] when you open some packs. So, here we're
[01:00:44] going to go. We'll run another one for
[01:00:45] those you want to go hang out with
[01:00:47] us. Go up to what it
[01:00:51] is. Ah, you're going to the EMP node. I
[01:00:53] like it, broki. We can do that. We can
[01:00:55] do
[01:01:01] that. All
[01:01:03] righty. We'll do that.
[01:01:09] Big BK is coming in. So, you didn't let
[01:01:11] me know what you're going to do with
[01:01:12] Silver Sneak. You going to let it be
[01:01:14] just scan you or it just doesn't do
[01:01:15] anything yet. You have a choice before
[01:01:18] we uh go. You going to let it do it and
[01:01:19] wander away. You leave it alone. All
[01:01:23] right. So, it scans
[01:01:28] you and then turns around and heads off
[01:01:30] into the distance quickly. Just like
[01:01:34] gone. You don't really know what
[01:01:36] happened. All right. I just didn't
[01:01:38] understand why it showed up. What was it
[01:01:40] doing, huh? Guess you have to figure
[01:01:43] that one
[01:01:45] out. Oh no. Silver sneak. I
[01:01:50] know. Who? I don't know. We'll We'll
[01:01:54] have to find out at some point if you
[01:01:55] should have killed it. Might be today,
[01:01:57] might be tomorrow, it might be next
[01:01:59] week. It's up to you how how long you
[01:02:01] coming and hanging out with us. So,
[01:02:05] I like it, my friends.
[01:02:08] Now, our other friend here is in the
[01:02:10] armory over here. And then going over to
[01:02:12] the EMP node.
[01:02:15] See, sometimes you don't need to kill.
[01:02:16] Yeah, exactly. If you kill things, then
[01:02:18] you always make an enemy almost. But if
[01:02:20] you don't, you don't always have an
[01:02:21] enemy. It could be, who knows what it
[01:02:22] is. It might have been just tracking you
[01:02:24] for someone. I don't know. You have a
[01:02:26] vault. You're in here. My friend bit um
[01:02:28] my friend there,
[01:02:31] Broki. What are you going to do there?
[01:02:38] What are you going to do in the EMP?
[01:02:39] You've been pass you have been pretty
[01:02:40] passive. So, you were going to that EMP
[01:02:42] node area. You going to go investigate
[01:02:44] it? Look around. See what you can find.
[01:02:45] All right. While you investigate, do you
[01:02:47] want high or low, broki? Cuz I don't
[01:02:49] think you have anything to help you fair
[01:02:51] luck
[01:02:56] yet. Let me know. Low. All right,
[01:03:00] broski. Oh, no. It's high. You go
[01:03:04] around, you look at the EMP
[01:03:06] node. The commander behind your car,
[01:03:08] right? Looks at you like, "What are you
[01:03:10] doing?" Like, "I'm just investigating."
[01:03:12] And you press some button and a shock
[01:03:14] wave goes
[01:03:15] out. Shuts down all the electronics.
[01:03:18] Caric looks at you like,
[01:03:21] "Seriously, what was that
[01:03:24] for?" You're you're kind of looking
[01:03:26] around like,
[01:03:27] "Um, I was just investigating. I'm
[01:03:29] sorry."
[01:03:32] And you you're now standing there. You
[01:03:34] got to decide how you're going to handle
[01:03:35] carving now. Big BK, let's get you one
[01:03:38] of the packs here that came out with our
[01:03:40] our secret set. Let's get one of these
[01:03:43] open. You'll eventually die for killing
[01:03:45] too many eventually. Eventually, yeah,
[01:03:47] something is going to come after you,
[01:03:48] right? All right, bro. Our buddy Big BK,
[01:03:52] you guys are all kind of together in
[01:03:53] front of that area there. And let's see
[01:03:55] what we got for you for back brightfield

[01:04:49] around. All right, let me get this over
[01:04:51] here for you, my
[01:04:55] friend. Oh, well, you know what? That is
[01:04:57] a good point, Big B. I have to remember.

[01:05:03] you.
[01:05:06] I'll do I'll try to remember on that.
[01:05:08] You big BK. All right. So, he he talks
[01:05:12] to
[01:05:14] Carvik, says, "Hey, I'm out. I'm" And
[01:05:16] Car looks you like, "Um, all right,
[01:05:18] dude. You haven't been doing anything
[01:05:19] here. You one of you're one of the
[01:05:20] clans, so I mean, just be careful what
[01:05:23] you're doing."
[01:05:25] Now, Big
[01:05:26] BK, you are uh standing outside that
[01:05:29] door with some
[01:05:33] friends. Uh okay. Yep.
[01:05:36] Yep. And you have that small hallway
[01:05:39] there. Are you guys uh going to head
[01:05:41] inside? It's up to you guys what you do.
[01:05:44] Are you going to head inside for a
[01:05:44] while? You going to hang out for a bit?
[01:05:46] It's always up to
[01:05:50] you. Ah, yes. It gives you the knives. I
[01:05:52] forgot about that.
[01:05:55] Silver Sneak is going to go forward. Big
[01:05:58] BK is looking to give him knives. I
[01:05:59] forgot about that. Big BK has some
[01:06:00] knives for you. Where are they? He's got
[01:06:03] three throwing knives to give
[01:06:07] you. Halloween now
[01:06:15] has eight throwing knives. Look at that.
[01:06:20] Throwing knives. You have six. Oh, you
[01:06:22] got more. Oh, all right. I I may have I
[01:06:25] may have not counted over. So, you are
[01:06:27] now up to 12. I mean 11 throwing
[01:06:30] knives. My math was really bad there.
[01:06:33] All right. Here we go, my friend. We
[01:06:36] have another one for you, Silver Sneak
[01:06:38] coming in
[01:06:39] there. All right, we'll put that there.
[01:06:41] There you go. The middle one he had
[01:06:42] picked
[01:06:45] out. L3. One, two, and three. I like
[01:06:50] Sneak is
[01:06:51] going. All right. You go look around.
[01:06:54] Checking that EMP out. I like it, broki.
[01:06:57] And then we have Silver Sneak goes, "You

[01:07:00] guys. I'm going to go
[01:07:02] down that um this that hallway there,
[01:07:06] and give me a second just to take a
[01:07:07] look."
[01:07:08] Okay. Now, he goes down the
[01:07:14] hallway, takes a look around the corner,
[01:07:19] uh and this burnt out hallway there.
[01:07:20] It's like a tunnel of some kind.
[01:07:23] And inside it he sees
[01:07:35] this. All right.
[01:07:51] Uh oh.
[01:07:55] Uhoh. Silver sneak. So you guys go down

[01:08:12] they can sneak around and be quiet. But
[01:08:15] I don't know. This uh this hydra thing
[01:08:18] here does not look too
[01:08:22] happy to be
[01:08:25] uh seeing you coming around a corner.
[01:08:29] Not all of them see you. Only one of the
[01:08:30] heads kind of maybe sees you and you
[01:08:33] turn. What are you going to do, my
[01:08:35] friend?
[01:08:41] You do get a bonus to sneaking. Yes,
[01:08:43] because you're you're able, as long as
[01:08:44] you're doing it initially, your sneaking
[01:08:46] allows you to walk silently. Yes. Step
[01:08:48] back. I go, "Oh,
[01:08:50] shite." Silver sneak slowly steps back
[01:08:53] as he looks around the
[01:08:54] corner like, "What the hell is going on
[01:08:58] here?" Hey, JM Clay. How's it going, my
[01:09:00] friend? Stephen Haley, good morning, my
[01:09:02] friend. Been up since 4:00
[01:09:05] a.m. Oh, you're getting all the precons.
[01:09:07] Awesome. That's pretty good, Steve. That
[01:09:09] should be fun. How's it going, JM? Nice
[01:09:11] to see you coming in back in
[01:09:14] here. Let me uh We're hanging out here
[01:09:17] and I'm going to get you this pack and
[01:09:18] we're going to open it up. All right,
[01:09:20] Silver
[01:09:24] Sneak. Turn
[01:09:27] around. You wonder how the Hydra got in
[01:09:29] there.
[01:09:31] Well, always throw the knives and then
[01:09:34] ask questions later. Well, Broki, did
[01:09:37] anybody watch any of my shorts that I
[01:09:39] any shorts that I make? Because the last
[01:09:40] two shorts explain how kind of the
[01:09:42] wasteland began in a way. Rying, Dawn
[01:09:45] Breaker, seize the opportunity. Good
[01:09:47] luck, my friend. Silver Sneak, Sand

[01:10:08] enchantment for you, my friend. Nice
[01:10:10] mythic pickup. Undergrowth leopard and a
[01:10:13] foil. Dismal backwater and a soldier.
[01:10:18] Oh, nice. If that's one you wanted, even
[01:10:21] better. Even better. I like when we get
[01:10:24] cards that people were looking have been
[01:10:25] looking for. Nice one on
[01:10:28] that. Let me get you in with your other
[01:10:31] stuff, Silver.
[01:10:34] There you go. Hey, Mystic. How's it
[01:10:35] going, everybody? All right, Silver.
[01:10:38] There you go. Now, the dragon. Yeah, if
[01:10:40] you guys watch any of my shorts, you'll
[01:10:41] understand what the dragon
[01:10:44] is. Do the helicopter. I You know, I can
[01:10:47] helicopter pretty well, but I have a
[01:10:49] problem because
[01:10:52] um All right, I'm going to give you I'm
[01:10:55] going to give him a minute. Huh?
[01:10:57] I have to keep I have to keep it PG. So,
[01:10:59] you know, have you ever seen this heard
[01:11:01] the song where you know about when you
[01:11:03] sit on the toilet, your stuff touches
[01:11:05] the water? See, the problem is when a
[01:11:07] helicopter, it blows people away. Okay.
[01:11:09] So, I can't do it that often. Dead
[01:11:11] ghost. It's one It's a problem. Draco
[01:11:14] Genesis is the card you should really
[01:11:16] want. You can cast all. Yes, I've seen
[01:11:18] somebody handed that out. Yes. Exan.
[01:11:20] Exactly. The
[01:11:23] no-handed. All right. So, you uh you
[01:11:25] turn around, Silver
[01:11:27] Sneak. All right, my friend. You start
[01:11:29] backing away and again,
[01:11:35] you bump in that weirdly at the end of
[01:11:36] the place that stray ghoul again there.
[01:11:38] Like what is going
[01:11:40] on? All right. Oh, let me do this. I
[01:11:43] wonder if I don't have that in here
[01:11:51] today. Here we go.
[01:12:08] We get the picture here.
[01:12:24] Let's do that here. There. There.
[01:12:47] This is going to be
[01:13:00] [Music]
[01:13:03] All right, that's got that there. That
[01:13:04] should
[01:13:13] show. Then we can do that there. Give me
[01:13:17] one
[01:13:19] second. I don't know why those didn't
[01:13:21] show in there. So, I have to add them in
[01:13:24] quickly.
[01:13:33] That's so weird that it did that. I hate
[01:13:35] how that happens sometimes. I don't do I
[01:13:37] It's either I I forgot how I did it or I
[01:13:40] mistake doing it.
[01:14:03] Let me do
[01:14:07] this. I don't know what that
[01:14:09] was there. That should
[01:14:14] be in there now. So
[01:14:18] anyways, let's see if you want him
[01:14:19] there. Good morning, my friends. You
[01:14:21] bump into this or try to talk to him.
[01:14:23] That's all right. You try to talk to
[01:14:23] him. I like it. You try talking to him.
[01:14:25] You say something. He
[01:14:26] [Music]
[01:14:28] mumbles. Swings his things around. Ah,
[01:14:31] said something that goes
[01:14:33] headache.
[01:14:35] Knives. Well, it's the first time he's
[01:14:37] made a comment.
[01:14:39] Interesting. Keeps swinging his knives
[01:14:41] around. What are you gonna do? Good
[01:14:43] morning, everybody. I appreciate you
[01:14:44] coming in, hanging out. We're doing some
[01:14:46] fun things. You going to teach the ghoul
[01:14:48] to clean out, clean and cook, and put it
[01:14:50] in the pool house. I like it.
[01:14:53] Morning, Mystic. Good morning. So, uh,
[01:14:57] offer him whiskey. Ah,
[01:15:00] not a bad idea. I like it. You have some
[01:15:02] whiskey. You have some whiskey left
[01:15:04] over. I like it. So, you go, "Hey,
[01:15:06] buddy. Would you like some
[01:15:10] whiskey?" And you he leans into you and
[01:15:12] he goes, "Oh, interesting." Yeah. He
[01:15:14] just leans over and he likes it. He
[01:15:15] picks it up, starts pounding
[01:15:19] it, turns to you, and goes, "Ah, thank
[01:15:22] you." Been swinging these things around
[01:15:24] for a while. This headache's been
[01:15:26] keeping me crazy. I can't even
[01:15:31] think. Thank you for offering me the
[01:15:33] whiskey. Feeling a little
[01:15:35] better. So, well, look at that. That
[01:15:38] must not have been a a might not be a
[01:15:40] feral one straying wandering around
[01:15:43] there. Now you're still in the hallway
[01:15:46] there. You see he goes, "Hey, I've been
[01:15:48] wandering here. That that dragon in the
[01:15:49] back, he's been here for a while.
[01:15:51] Doesn't have to go after me cuz I don't
[01:15:53] know. I think I'm dead so he doesn't
[01:15:54] smell me or whatever. But you guys got
[01:15:55] to be careful." All kinds of things
[01:15:57] happen with that one around the
[01:15:59] corner. He's like
[01:16:01] dragon. Yeah, that guy, that guy over
[01:16:03] there, he's no fun.
[01:16:09] Well, he's ate a few of the people. He
[01:16:11] uh he he spit some fire, some like ice,
[01:16:14] too. It was weird. I I saw him take out
[01:16:16] a couple of people that wandered in here
[01:16:18] before. I I locked I I was the one that
[01:16:20] put the wood barrier on the door there.
[01:16:22] I don't even know how it got open.
[01:16:23] That's why I came in
[01:16:25] here. That's what the stray ghoul is
[01:16:27] saying to you
[01:16:31] guys. Ah, the weekend scale. You know
[01:16:34] what? Actually, there is if you um if
[01:16:36] you can get him on his underside.
[01:16:37] Generally, the underside of him seems
[01:16:38] like it's it's weakened. But if you um
[01:16:42] hit him, you got to It looks like he the
[01:16:44] heads and body parts grow back cuz he
[01:16:45] used to have two heads. Somehow he's got
[01:16:48] more. So, I I don't know how to take
[01:16:50] care of those though. You got to be
[01:16:51] careful. Maybe maybe something to like
[01:16:53] sear them shut when you're shooting or
[01:16:54] when you're hitting them. I don't know.
[01:16:57] Hit him in the tank. That could be
[01:17:00] it. You open it and you're going to try
[01:17:02] and kill it. Oh, Big BK looks at him and
[01:17:04] goes, "Hey, dude. I was the one that
[01:17:06] opened it. I'm I'm killing this dragon.
[01:17:07] I'm a dragon slayer here." All
[01:17:14] right. Burned them at the stumps. Oh,
[01:17:16] that's probably a good idea. That's pro.
[01:17:17] You know what? That may have something
[01:17:20] to do with it. That could be it. You
[01:17:21] burned them at the stumps. I'm not sure
[01:17:24] there. All
[01:17:26] right. So you guys
[01:17:29] uh there is how many of
[01:17:32] you? He I guess he doesn't see the fiery
[01:17:35] gat. He looks he goes he shows you show
[01:17:36] him the gat and he goes oh nice that
[01:17:39] thing should uh that thing should help
[01:17:40] out every time you
[01:17:42] hit with the uh incendiary gat. It'll
[01:17:45] it'll uh sears close the holes. That's
[01:17:46] perfect. Or or whatever you knock off.
[01:17:48] That's a good
[01:17:50] one. That's a good one. Ah look at that.
[01:17:52] I like it. We have a couple collector
[01:17:54] boosters left for those that want to
[01:17:55] jump in and uh some of them want to jump
[01:17:57] in the auto box. We have some uh mo most
[01:18:00] of it is tar but there are some of the
[01:18:02] other sets built built
[01:18:03] in. What do you have for
[01:18:06] boosters? Big BK. You have buffs. You
[01:18:09] have one um one luck, one intelligent,
[01:18:11] one agility, one engineering, and one
[01:18:13] strength. You have a critical one
[01:18:15] critical hit. You also have some crack
[01:18:18] binoculars and a mystery chips to use.
[01:18:22] And then your gat gives you, you know,
[01:18:24] it has the fire there. Um, one in
[01:18:26] chance, one in four chance for an
[01:18:27] explosion. And your pirate sword gives
[01:18:29] you a one in4 chance for a
[01:18:31] shock. Just a critical,
[01:18:34] correct? Let's see. Halloween. Halloween
[01:18:37] has a Halloween, you have a critical and
[01:18:41] a plus one luck for one turn. So, you do
[01:18:43] have a critical
[01:18:45] also. And then let's see for our next
[01:18:48] friend here. Huh? Big BK came in. We're
[01:18:52] going with Oh, I like it. Some dragons.
[01:18:56] Tar, let me see what you going to go
[01:18:58] with here, my friend. Where would you
[01:18:59] like to go and we'll open this
[01:19:06] up? Oh, I like it. Try to cut some heads
[01:19:09] off and get it
[01:19:11] going. You cut the head off and he
[01:19:13] shoots him with the uh with the with the
[01:19:15] incendiary. Mystics and Mystics around.
[01:19:18] I know Mystic jumped in, but he they
[01:19:20] they Mystic's been quiet. Where's
[01:19:23] Mystic? I thought I had a one image from
[01:19:26] Mystic. A really? I swear I had
[01:19:30] one R5. One, two, three,
[01:19:34] [Music]
[01:19:35] four, and five right here, my friend.
[01:19:40] R5. Let's see what we get here. We got a
[01:19:44] They wandered into a um So, what
[01:19:46] happened was Big BK decided he was going
[01:19:49] to open the um the the dusty bunk block
[01:19:53] door. Big BK when he did that, there's a
[01:19:56] hallway. He w went to wander down, but
[01:19:58] instead he he thought better to grab
[01:19:59] some friends. Now, Silver Sneak wandered
[01:20:02] down the hallway. He's the one that's
[01:20:04] able to walk silently because of an
[01:20:05] implant. And at the end of the hallway,
[01:20:07] he saw a hydro dragon. That's not good.
[01:20:11] now. Um, met a ghoul friend, helped him
[01:20:14] get back to normal, gave him some
[01:20:15] whiskey so he could think. Guess he was
[01:20:18] an alcoholic in the past and, uh, now
[01:20:20] he's able to think and able to talk to
[01:20:21] you and let you know that you need to be
[01:20:23] careful. So, you get some dragon you get
[01:20:25] to find. I know. All right. Good luck.
[01:20:27] Sagu Pumler, Unending Whisper, Aous
[01:20:30] Exhale, Shock Bridge, Feral Death
[01:20:33] Gorgger, Trade Route, Envoy, Watcher of
[01:20:36] the Wayside, Sonic Shrier, Equilibrium
[01:20:39] Adept, Feral Death Gorgger, nice for
[01:20:42] your dragon showcase there. Then, an
[01:20:45] inevitable defeat for your um clan card.
[01:20:49] Nice rare there. Sage of the Fang and
[01:20:52] the Foil, Jungle Hollow, and your spirit
[01:20:56] token.
[01:21:00] All
[01:21:01] righty. Not bad for those ones. We like
[01:21:04] those. Not bad opening those babies up.
[01:21:07] Nice pickups
[01:21:09] there. We're going to keep wandering
[01:21:11] through our uh our
[01:21:13] wasteland. And I'm going to put you in
[01:21:16] uh your bag, Big B.
[01:21:29] Let me write another name down, but I'm
[01:21:30] going to do it
[01:21:33] big
[01:21:40] BK509. Oh, it hurt it. It um one of them
[01:21:43] did notice Silver Sneak coming in. So,
[01:21:45] one head at least knows that you're
[01:21:47] there. So, I'm I'm guessing you might be
[01:21:50] able to I mean, if you can somehow do
[01:21:51] something like uh and and make it so
[01:21:55] that that one head doesn't alert the
[01:21:57] others potentially. But it does seem
[01:21:59] like you have a bit of an issue here
[01:22:01] with your uh your dragon. Uh it looks
[01:22:03] like a couple might spit
[01:22:05] fire, a couple spit some water, and then
[01:22:08] there's one that we're not really sure
[01:22:09] what it does in the background. You
[01:22:11] know, it could be um who knows what it
[01:22:15] is. Now, Big
[01:22:17] BK, you're uh standing out front there,
[01:22:21] you're hanging around and
[01:22:24] you when you go inside that play in the
[01:22:27] inside the hallway, you see your old
[01:22:28] locked chest randomly
[01:22:30] there. See it in the corner buried. You
[01:22:32] kick that baby open. Inside of it, you
[01:22:35] find yourself a knife and some assault
[01:22:38] rifle ammo, which is nice because that
[01:22:41] gives you some extra ammo. So, that
[01:22:43] brings you up to Big BK. Hey, you had
[01:22:45] shot some 150. That gives
[01:22:48] 175 for your rounds of ammo and a knife
[01:22:51] if you want it.
[01:22:56] A lot of ammo. I'm going to need the
[01:22:59] ammo. We could throw the whiskey bottle
[01:23:01] to get the attention away from it. Oh,
[01:23:02] you could try that. It's electric. I
[01:23:05] know. Oh, you got Oh, dang it. You got
[01:23:08] what? You You knew what I was going to
[01:23:10] do. You've seen the movies, I guess. Oh,
[01:23:11] yeah. Give homeboy the knife. I like it.
[01:23:13] Knife. knife to Halloween. Halloween has
[01:23:16] a regular knife now. We'll give him a
[01:23:17] regular knife now.
[01:23:19] Here's a regular knife. Throwing knife.
[01:23:21] This is a regular knife. This is a
[01:23:23] regular knife. Yeah. All right. So, uh
[01:23:26] there you go, guys.
[01:23:29] Now, um I did see somebody say he was
[01:23:32] going to go test that. Um
[01:23:37] No, you didn't ruin anything with the
[01:23:39] MP. You go over there and you check it
[01:23:41] again and you figure out how to turn it
[01:23:42] on and off now to make it go. That's
[01:23:44] actually what you did. And you realize
[01:23:46] that there's um some electronic
[01:23:47] components in there that you could try
[01:23:49] to steal, but there's a good chance our
[01:23:51] buddy Carvik will see
[01:23:54] it. So you going to guys, so somebody
[01:23:56] said we're going to try to throw the
[01:23:57] whiskey bottle, get the attention away.
[01:23:59] Not a bad idea. Throw the empty whiskey
[01:24:02] bottle. All right, we can try that. We
[01:24:04] see what happens. Who's throwing it?
[01:24:07] Broki can come in and hang out if you
[01:24:09] want. Try out uh get in the get in the
[01:24:11] little dragon incursion here. We have we
[01:24:14] have a bit of an issue
[01:24:22] today. Big BK has a plus one on
[01:24:26] strength, so he has a little bit more.
[01:24:28] Halloween has the most strength
[01:24:29] actually. So Halloween has a plus four
[01:24:32] on
[01:24:33] strength. So, uh, he's Halloween is the
[01:24:36] strongest one. His implant made him
[01:24:38] super strong, but kind of dumb and
[01:24:45] slow. Almost max strength. He's one away
[01:24:48] from max strength. Five is max strength.
[01:24:51] All right. So, you hand
[01:24:57] Halloween. All right. You're gonna head
[01:24:59] out then. All right. You head back over.
[01:25:00] You head out. Broki heads out.
[01:25:03] Halloween has a bottle there. Bottle of
[01:25:06] whiskey. He's standing at the
[01:25:09] uh He's standing at the end of
[01:25:14] that. Oh, he's sitting at the end there
[01:25:17] and he grabs a whiskey bott. He starts
[01:25:18] to try to drink it. It's
[01:25:20] empty. And um our buddy Silver Sneak
[01:25:24] turns to Big BK. He looks at Big BK like
[01:25:26] what the is he doing? Dude, throw the
[01:25:28] bottle. There's nothing in it. And Helen
[01:25:31] goes, "Oh, oh yeah, sorry. Sorry, I
[01:25:34] forgot about
[01:25:36] that." So, Silverne sneak hand goes,
[01:25:39] "Dude, just push it away. Go throw the
[01:25:41] bottle." So, all
[01:25:46] [Laughter]
[01:25:49] right. Why is the rum always gone,
[01:25:52] though? Broki comes running around. He
[01:25:53] has a ruckus. Sees people wandering into
[01:25:55] a cave and like, "What the hell is going
[01:25:57] on over here?" So now, do you want high
[01:26:01] or low to see if you're able to do it?
[01:26:03] We're going to have uh for a roll there.
[01:26:05] See if it's a good throw or if it lands
[01:26:06] somewhere near.
[01:26:09] Good throw.
[01:26:12] Come on. Good throw. What are we saying?
[01:26:16] You going to throw it? Halloween says
[01:26:20] low. Well, there you go. It's a It's a
[01:26:23] nine. That's a low. Got Ugan in your
[01:26:26] pre-release. That's awesome. Night
[01:26:28] cream. That's a sweet one. Well, there
[01:26:29] you go. Knowing your luck, it's a low. I
[01:26:33] Yeah, that's like me, too. I got bad
[01:26:35] luck. So, there you go. So, our buddy um
[01:26:38] our buddy Halloween guns that
[01:26:41] bottle. It throws it and it hits the
[01:26:44] back of like the cave behind uh that
[01:26:47] dragon there. And it was the goldheaded
[01:26:48] dragon that was looking at you. So, it
[01:26:50] turns around and looks and tries to see
[01:26:52] what's going on and sprays out. And
[01:26:54] there you go. You got it. You got it. My
[01:26:56] friend uh my friend there big BK figured
[01:27:00] it out. He's he spit some uh lightning
[01:27:03] at it in the bottle that hit the hit the
[01:27:06] wall shocks and spit spl uh splits into
[01:27:08] a million different pieces and just kind
[01:27:10] of goes away into
[01:27:12] nothingness. All right, guys. It's on to
[01:27:16] a we're on to a bit a little bit of a
[01:27:17] battle here
[01:27:20] today. Now, are we rolling right into
[01:27:22] it?
[01:27:24] It's distract. One of them's distracted.
[01:27:26] The other ones don't really see you
[01:27:27] right now. The only one that saw you is
[01:27:28] distracted. Let's fight. All right. I
[01:27:31] see it. Let's fight. Let's go in.
[01:27:34] Let's do this. You go under silently. I
[01:27:37] like
[01:27:38] it. Our buddy uh Silver Sneak uses his
[01:27:42] silent abilities there. Goes and sneaks
[01:27:45] towards the dragon. Now, the other head
[01:27:48] starting to turn towards where the other
[01:27:49] one shot out the uh and blew up the
[01:27:51] bottle. So the other heads are looking
[01:27:52] the other way. And you're lucky to sneak
[01:27:53] out and go slightly underneath
[01:27:57] it. And then our friend Big
[01:27:59] BK, you're going to have another of
[01:28:01] Tarquia. Where'd you like to go, my
[01:28:04] friend? So there you go. Got one person
[01:28:07] sliding underneath
[01:28:09] Halloween. Yeah, you can. You should
[01:28:11] spread out to avoid. Yeah, you can
[01:28:13] spread out. So Mystic spreads out. M4.
[01:28:16] All right. One, two, three, and four
[01:28:18] right there. Well, look at that. That
[01:28:19] was actually a perfect grab of Oh, hold
[01:28:20] on. That's a way. There you go. So, we
[01:28:23] can make sure we see what we're opening.
[01:28:24] Now, you, my friend, when you're uh
[01:28:26] right before you start doing anything,
[01:28:28] you see some things in the ground that
[01:28:30] may um may help, may not help. We're not
[01:28:32] sure. You find a some food
[01:28:37] supplies. You find some scrap metal. You
[01:28:41] find a bunch of pre-war money, which
[01:28:43] really doesn't do anything. You also
[01:28:45] find one random disc on the ground. H
[01:28:51] taking it. Oh, Big BK's taking it. Okay.
[01:28:54] Big BK takes all of that stuff while
[01:28:56] they're going around. I found some
[01:28:58] supplies and they're going to take all
[01:28:59] of it. I like it. Good luck, my friend.

[01:30:05] what happens sometimes. That's what
[01:30:08] happens sometimes. cuz I've had that
[01:30:09] happen before. But dude, I pulled out
[01:30:10] the best card and I think it was an

[01:35:47] all those in the sleeves and put some of
[01:35:48] them topplers now. Gnome's rule. I know
[01:35:50] you you've been in here before. You hang
[01:35:52] out and we've been doing some of the the
[01:35:53] the D and D thing here game. If you want
[01:35:56] to, you can jump in having uh come in
[01:35:58] and hanging out with us. We'll get you
[01:36:00] hanging out in there if you'd like.
[01:36:08] All righty.
[01:36:11] Let's put all those together for you, my
[01:36:13] friend. Get the rest of these put away.
[01:36:19] And
[01:36:20] then, oh, all right. Well, if you want
[01:36:23] to jump in with your uh if you want to,
[01:36:24] you can jump in with us. They're doing a
[01:36:26] little D and D stuff if you'd like to uh
[01:36:28] hang out. But there you go. I'm going to
[01:36:30] put that all with your other stuff
[01:36:33] gnomes. All right. Over here. And then
[01:36:36] uh everybody is hanging out in that um
[01:36:39] burnt
[01:36:41] out the uh the cave that was uh
[01:36:44] destroyed by there by the dragon there
[01:36:46] and came in. Now our buddy Silver Sneak
[01:36:50] went sliding underneath his belly, stabs
[01:36:52] up with the with its uh knives.
[01:36:56] Halloween uses throwing knives now. Um
[01:36:59] and you're going to try to shoot for the
[01:37:01] gat. So you're
[01:37:03] going going after it. Use your sword.
[01:37:06] All right. Use the sword. I like it. So
[01:37:08] silver sneak stabs up with the
[01:37:11] sword. Now the sword gives you plus five
[01:37:15] on your roll. And all right, your
[01:37:18] agility helps. All right, here we
[01:37:21] go. You
[01:37:23] have Let's see what happens. You're
[01:37:26] going to need a 17 or higher to hit the
[01:37:29] dragon, but because you have the plus
[01:37:31] five, that makes it a 12 or
[01:37:35] higher. There you go. Let's see what
[01:37:37] happens. Oh, it's a 17. You stab up
[01:37:42] cleanly. I like it. And you hit it for
[01:37:43] 10. That's nice because this is one that
[01:37:47] is an This is a big hard hitter. All
[01:37:50] right. This is a 60 health, but you
[01:37:54] never know what's going to happen here.
[01:37:55] So, you drop it down to 50 health. All
[01:37:59] right.
[01:38:01] Interesting. Ah, you shoot the lightning
[01:38:04] head. You use the pistols to try to
[01:38:07] blind it. All right. So, you stab up.
[01:38:11] Got that one there. Then we have our
[01:38:13] buddy with throwing knives. Now, you
[01:38:15] have how many throwing knives? You can
[01:38:16] throw three at a time. You have a bunch
[01:38:17] of throwing knives. our friend Halloween
[01:38:19] as I know that they get to throw a plus
[01:38:22] three and they get to throw three at a
[01:38:23] time. So, here we go. You're going to
[01:38:25] have a um you're going to have to get um
[01:38:29] 14 or
[01:38:31] higher. Oh no,
[01:38:35] Halloween. That is a critical
[01:38:38] fail. Halloween throws the knives and he
[01:38:42] got a little too close to the dragon.
[01:38:45] One of the ones with the uh one of the
[01:38:47] ones with the flaming
[01:38:49] heads grabs him actually with its mouth
[01:38:52] picks him and throws him in the air. Oh
[01:38:54] no, you now have a bite
[01:38:56] wound and you're on the ground,
[01:39:00] Halloween. So you go down. We're going
[01:39:03] to see what you go down there with the
[01:39:04] critical fail that you had there. Sorry
[01:39:06] about that. Uh oh. Nope. Nope. Let's see
[01:39:08] what happens. Oh no.
[01:39:12] 19. That's not good.
[01:39:18] brings you down to 56
[01:39:21] health, but you do have some uh actually
[01:39:24] that goes up because you have um instead
[01:39:26] of 56 that brings you down to 60 health
[01:39:28] because you have the armor and the
[01:39:29] helmet. But you do have some rations you
[01:39:32] can do to try to help save
[01:39:37] yourself. Oh, use your critical. Use the
[01:39:40] critical. I'm sorry. I didn't catch
[01:39:42] that. You used the critical.
[01:39:44] So, with the throwing knives and the
[01:39:46] critical, let's do it. Let's see what
[01:39:48] you get. You guaranteed the hit, which
[01:39:51] gives
[01:39:52] you 12 on them. I like it. I'm sorry I
[01:39:57] missed that. You're hitting him. You do
[01:39:58] that. Brings him down to brings him down
[01:40:01] 12. You were close to that guy, though.
[01:40:04] You're still close to him. So, it goes
[01:40:06] from 50 down to 38. But the gold
[01:40:12] one shoots some sparks up in the
[01:40:16] air. All right. And with that, some of
[01:40:20] the rock rumble fall rocks fall
[01:40:24] down in front of
[01:40:26] it. With those rocks falling down, it
[01:40:30] also
[01:40:31] has a uh a bit of health that it
[01:40:34] regains. It was a distraction for
[01:40:37] you. So, it looks like it was able to
[01:40:40] heal some. Now, the stomach wound is
[01:40:41] pretty big, but it goes from 38 back up
[01:40:44] to 45
[01:40:46] health. Now, our friend, we use a nice
[01:40:50] blue. Ah, that's about
[01:40:58] right. Yes. Before you get your shot
[01:41:00] off. That's correct. That's before you
[01:41:02] get your shot. I told you it was going
[01:41:03] to be a little bit of a fight here. You
[01:41:05] shoot though. trying to get
[01:41:09] him and he
[01:41:12] misses. And you miss, my friend. Or did
[01:41:14] you use the critical? Were you using
[01:41:16] your critical?
[01:41:26] Were you I couldn't remember if you were
[01:41:27] going to use your
[01:41:32] critical. You can be smart once in a
[01:41:34] while. That's true.
[01:41:37] just one attack. One attack it
[01:41:39] guarantees a hit and then um whatever
[01:41:42] occurs with them is is you're
[01:41:44] guaranteeing yourself a hit um on it
[01:41:47] pretty much is what the critical is. And
[01:41:48] you get to say kind of where it is and
[01:41:50] where you can hit. So for instance, you
[01:41:52] can say, you know, try to take out one
[01:41:53] of the heads. See if that works. I know
[01:41:55] you said you run out the lightning one.
[01:41:57] No, you'll use it next time. All right.
[01:41:58] So you missed this time then. You did
[01:42:01] miss this time. And then we have our
[01:42:03] buddy that uh try to shoots with his
[01:42:06] pistols to
[01:42:08] blind. Oh, wait. You need two
[01:42:19] pistols. You missed with the
[01:42:22] pistols. All right, then we had Who else
[01:42:26] was in here? I think Mystic was in there
[01:42:27] and they're using the GAT. Now, the
[01:42:29] regular GAT. Let's see what the regular
[01:42:31] GAT does for
[01:42:33] you. Oh no, you missed too. But luckily
[01:42:36] it wasn't a critical. You just lost some
[01:42:40] ammo. Now the dragon tries to attack
[01:42:44] back all five. Let's see what
[01:42:49] happens. All right, we're going to
[01:42:55] do Oh, hold on. I don't have that.
[01:43:00] Give me one
[01:43:01] second. I thought I had
[01:43:10] those.
[01:43:19] No, I'm going to go with
[01:43:47] Nope. I got to do this though.
[01:43:57] There we go. And then I got to do
[01:44:14] this.
[01:44:16] There. Well, now what happens is the
[01:44:19] dragon needs to uh go here and attack. I
[01:44:21] thought I had that in
[01:44:23] here. You did went from critical hits to
[01:44:25] critical miss. At least you got
[01:44:26] something. All right, so here you go.
[01:44:28] The dragon
[01:44:29] rolls
[01:44:40] and you have missed. They missed. You
[01:44:44] got
[01:44:45] lucky. They missed. They hit with a
[01:44:48] nine. yet they have they have to have a
[01:44:50] uh 13 or higher to hit. Well, you all
[01:44:53] got lucky. The dragon missed that
[01:44:56] time. Oh, wow. Dragon sitting there.
[01:44:59] They shoot at him. You hit some things
[01:45:00] around it and you shoot again, my
[01:45:05] friend. And you have Oh, well, you hit
[01:45:08] because you have plus 10 or 11 or
[01:45:10] something like that with that. So, you
[01:45:11] hit him for a 66.
[01:45:14] Well, that's a good 118.
[01:45:17] 21. 21. And your number is normally two.
[01:45:21] You missed that though. So, it goes
[01:45:25] from 45
[01:45:29] health down to 24 health. Now, you hit
[01:45:33] which one did you go after? By the way,
[01:45:35] you didn't say which one. You just shot
[01:45:37] randomly. You're hitting him. Lightning
[01:45:39] one. All right. You hit the lightning
[01:45:41] one. Now the lightning one
[01:45:43] whales and it ducks his head behind the
[01:45:50] rest and it sits there hidden behind the
[01:45:52] rest of
[01:45:53] them. Yeah, I know. He is a
[01:45:56] [ __ ] All right, it's up to you now.
[01:45:59] What are you everybody else doing? I
[01:46:01] know we have uh some of you guys hanging
[01:46:02] out in here. You got to let me know.
[01:46:09] Oh my god, the the scrolling is
[01:46:10] ridiculous right now. Halloween's going
[01:46:12] to
[01:46:14] shoot. You going to go from underneath
[01:46:16] inside of lights again. All right, so
[01:46:20] Halloween. Oh,
[01:46:26] no. Did that mean to
[01:46:30] happen? Halloween does it. Where' that
[01:46:33] go?
[01:46:34] Halloween. You have the two pistols. So,
[01:46:37] you shoot with both your pistols there.
[01:46:39] I like it. Two
[01:46:42] pistols. And you hit for two
[01:46:47] damage, bringing it down to 22
[01:46:55] health. And then you're going to shoot
[01:46:58] also. Bro shoots. Oh, bro's got two
[01:47:00] pistols also.
[01:47:03] Oh, bro, you miss. You do not hit him
[01:47:06] this
[01:47:07] time. You hit finding the Halloween. I
[01:47:10] know. And then Mystic is going to shoot
[01:47:13] also. Well, our other guy goes
[01:47:15] underneath with the sword to stab. So,
[01:47:16] we have somebody underneath with
[01:47:17] stabbing with a sword. And oh, with the
[01:47:20] five plus five, you get the stab on
[01:47:22] there. You get five,
[01:47:25] seven. Now you hit them for seven.
[01:47:32] bringing it down to 15
[01:47:34] health and then our buddy shoots with
[01:47:38] his
[01:47:39] gat. The gat gives plus five. It does
[01:47:42] not help you. But I don't think Mystic,
[01:47:44] do you have anything else in here help
[01:47:46] you? Oh no, it does not help. Does not
[01:47:49] help there.
[01:47:52] It's only plus five there with your
[01:47:54] alien gat or I mean plus six on that
[01:47:56] alien gat. You do not get a hit on them.
[01:47:59] You
[01:48:00] missed the
[01:48:03] dragon. The head in the back did get
[01:48:06] stabbed there. This time it sparks out
[01:48:09] again in the back. Shoots up again,
[01:48:12] causing a little bit of a distraction. A
[01:48:14] few of the way. Oh, nope. That's not
[01:48:18] what I
[01:48:20] wanted. Big BK jumps out of the
[01:48:23] way. Halloween doesn't know what's going
[01:48:25] on. just has a rock crop on his head
[01:48:27] like ow ow ow ow
[01:48:29] ow. Silver sneaks in the corner and
[01:48:31] doesn't see anything going on. He's the
[01:48:34] one hiding. He's doing a good
[01:48:36] job. And then our buddy um our buddy
[01:48:40] Broki is just in the background like
[01:48:41] what's going on
[01:48:44] here? You didn't hide from anything. You
[01:48:47] dodged everything. You dodged stuff. You
[01:48:49] don't hide. You dodged it. Yes.
[01:48:53] Now in the process of dodging them, the
[01:48:55] heals back up again. Oh
[01:48:58] no, the hydra goes from its 15 health
[01:49:03] back up to 25
[01:49:06] health and it attacks all of
[01:49:13] you. Oh, you guys are lucky it didn't
[01:49:16] get a 13. It needs a 13 or higher to
[01:49:19] hit. Any of you guys got lucky again?
[01:49:23] All the dragons, the golden one is is it
[01:49:25] head is hanging on. So it's it's uh
[01:49:26] barely hanging on. All the dragons are
[01:49:29] distracted. All right, shoot
[01:49:33] it. There you go. We're shooting. Here
[01:49:36] we go. Let's see what happens. Big
[01:49:38] BK. Big BK hits for
[01:49:43] eight 10 11.
[01:49:46] Oh, and now every time Big BK hits, cuz
[01:49:49] it's an incendiary gun, nothing heals.
[01:49:51] So, you hit for 11 and it drops down to
[01:49:54] 14. Oop, I just bumped the camera. I'm
[01:49:56] sorry about
[01:49:57] that. The red head. All right, you go
[01:49:59] into the red head. I like you shoot the
[01:50:00] red one. All right, nice. You hit one of
[01:50:02] the red ones. One of the red ones starts
[01:50:04] whailing and it actually falls down and
[01:50:06] it's kind of dead. Doesn't do anything.
[01:50:08] It's getting You're getting to the end
[01:50:09] of it. Use your throwing knives. What
[01:50:12] are you throwing
[01:50:13] at? Oh, it's plus three. You missed
[01:50:16] anyway while on them. So, I'm sorry.
[01:50:20] What about strength? You missed with the
[01:50:22] throwing
[01:50:23] knives. You going to follow and try to
[01:50:26] cut the main head off. I like it. You
[01:50:28] go. You run over there trying to cut the
[01:50:30] main head off, Silver Sneak. Oh no, you
[01:50:34] miss that golden head. Dodges out of the
[01:50:37] way and sees your your sword coming
[01:50:39] towards it. Moves out of the way from
[01:50:41] you.
[01:50:44] Now we have I think Broki and our our
[01:50:47] buddy. Uh we're gonna shoot with our
[01:50:49] gat. We've been doing the gat the entire
[01:50:51] time. Oh, wait. No. Get rid of the
[01:50:54] dragon.
[01:50:56] 18. 18. You hit for five.
[01:51:00] Seven. All right. 8. Nine. You hit for
[01:51:04] nine. The dragon was at uh
[01:51:09] 14. Now it goes down to minus 9.
[01:51:13] It wales again. It's at five health. One
[01:51:16] of the green heads falls dead from the
[01:51:19] shots. Now that golden head's hanging on
[01:51:21] there by a
[01:51:24] thread. Try to shoot one more time for
[01:51:28] Broki. Broki uses and tries to
[01:51:32] shoot. Broki.
[01:51:35] Oh, Broki. Look at that. You get a
[01:51:39] critical.
[01:51:41] Look at that. A natural
[01:51:43] 20. That's a critical hit. You get two.
[01:51:47] And are you going to shoot the golden
[01:51:49] head? Are you going to shoot the red
[01:51:50] head? Which one you going for? I'm going
[01:51:51] to let you
[01:51:54] pick. The main one. All right. Well, the
[01:51:57] Well, the the main one's the one in the
[01:51:58] front. That's the big one. But the
[01:52:00] golden head's the one that's been acting
[01:52:02] interesting and hiding. So, it's up to
[01:52:04] you. The main one's the front one. I
[01:52:06] mean, if you kill the front one, the
[01:52:08] rest of it might have a hard time
[01:52:09] fighting.
[01:52:16] The front one. All right. You shoot that
[01:52:18] front one right in its eyes and it
[01:52:21] whales and go falls the ground. Dead.
[01:52:25] The main head is dead. Now the golden
[01:52:29] head in the background barely hanging on
[01:52:30] by a thread whales itself and sprays
[01:52:34] some more lightning up at the
[01:52:37] ceiling causing some stuff to fall down.
[01:52:40] And you brought it down to one health
[01:52:43] with your with your hit there of four.
[01:52:46] But when it dropped down to one health,
[01:52:49] the whailing brought it back up to 10.
[01:52:51] It's back up to 10 health. What are you
[01:52:54] guys going to do?
[01:53:06] throwing knives and shooting. All right,
[01:53:08] you're you're going to sever the go the
[01:53:10] golden head. I like it. So, shoot from
[01:53:13] Big Bk. Big BK goes, I'm taking this
[01:53:15] baby out. You're
[01:53:17] done. And you're plus 11 gets a hit. You
[01:53:22] get eight. Well, you hit it for enough.
[01:53:26] Well, the incendiary gat goes out. At
[01:53:28] the same time, our buddy Silverne Sneak
[01:53:30] goes running down with a sword, slicing
[01:53:33] off the
[01:53:35] head. Then you do have some left. Our
[01:53:39] buddy throws the throwing
[01:53:40] knives. All of you at once and hits with
[01:53:43] the throwing knives. Look at that. You
[01:53:45] hit with the throwing
[01:53:47] knives. Everybody at once goes, "We're
[01:53:49] not letting this guy get
[01:53:51] away." Shoots with your uh with your
[01:53:54] pistol. Oh, that was No, you need two of
[01:53:55] them. Shoots with your pistol. Oh, you
[01:53:56] got the critical hit. You don't need to
[01:53:58] do that. You come in with the gatling
[01:54:00] though and shoot my friend Mystic and
[01:54:02] Mystic Miss. It doesn't matter because
[01:54:04] the dragon is hit and
[01:54:08] killed. It drops the
[01:54:11] ground. Dead. You hit him. There is no
[01:54:16] more
[01:54:17] dragon now. As it's falling to the
[01:54:20] ground, it's dead. There you see
[01:54:22] something in the background. weirdly
[01:54:25] close. Hold on. This is a
[01:54:47] uh All right. Well, that dragon's dead
[01:54:50] there. Are you guys going to um scavenge
[01:54:52] around? What are you guys going to do
[01:54:54] with the dragon?
[01:54:56] Yeah, that was pretty good. Uh pretty
[01:54:57] good battle you had
[01:55:15] there. Cook it. Oh, I like it. I'mma
[01:55:18] pull out one of the tongues and try to
[01:55:20] feed it to the bug. Oh, that's a good
[01:55:22] idea. Loot the You're looting the gold
[01:55:25] one. Halloween. Well, you get you killed
[01:55:27] it. You get to loot it now. So, you're
[01:55:30] looting it. All right. So, you take
[01:55:31] everybody take some
[01:55:34] pieces. Oh, maybe later you could try
[01:55:36] some of them. Yeah. So, we have uh
[01:55:38] What's everybody taking? We have
[01:55:40] um the tongue is going to our buddy
[01:55:43] here, um Silver
[01:55:46] Sneak. All right. Now, this doesn't have
[01:55:48] much on
[01:55:49] it. There's some There's a bunch of Pogs
[01:55:52] cuz a dragon and there's a bunch of ammo
[01:55:54] that you can that is found, but not too
[01:55:56] much else because let's hold on one
[01:56:01] second. You can actually take some of
[01:56:03] these and make them into make them into
[01:56:05] things like the scales. Make them armor.
[01:56:07] Make some armor or something like that.
[01:56:09] Dragon armor. Dragon scales. Scales and
[01:56:12] wean. All right. I like it. I wanted to
[01:56:14] take some dragon nails to make throwing
[01:56:16] knives. I like it. Horns. Oh, horns are
[01:56:18] a good one. Horns are a good one. I like
[01:56:20] it. So, everybody's going to grab some
[01:56:26] scales. Dragon scales for
[01:56:41] everyone. All right. Dragon
[01:56:45] Scales. Silver Sneak's going to take
[01:56:47] some of those, too, I'm
[01:56:53] guessing. Dragon
[01:56:56] Scales. Then
[01:56:59] Broki, we're going to do dragon
[01:57:03] scales. All
[01:57:05] right. And then Mystic. I'm going to
[01:57:08] grab some dragon scales, too.
[01:57:12] Isn't Mic going to cook it? And uh the
[01:57:16] wien
[01:57:18] cuz he always likes that for some
[01:57:19] reason. Can I harvest any of the almetto
[01:57:21] sacks from the heads? Oh, I like
[01:57:24] that. Um
[01:57:28] the somebody said they were taking
[01:57:30] horns. Who's taking the
[01:57:36] horns? Horns. Uh, was that
[01:57:40] you taking the horns?
[01:57:43] Yeah, it was Broki. Broki. Yeah. All
[01:57:45] right. Varski, take some
[01:57:48] horns. Broki, take some horns. Dragon
[01:57:52] scales. And
[01:57:57] horns. Dragon horns. I like it.
[01:58:02] Everybody take some horns. I like it.
[01:58:03] We'll give everybody some horns.
[01:58:10] Dragon
[01:58:12] horns for
[01:58:28] everybody dragon horns. Silver sneak
[01:58:31] some dragon horns.
[01:58:35] There you
[01:58:36] go. And then Mystic some dragon
[01:58:40] horns. Now Mystic's going to try to cook
[01:58:43] it up and see what's going
[01:58:46] on. Yeah, you can cut it open. See if
[01:58:48] there's any side. Yeah. You want to uh
[01:58:50] look behind it, too, and see what it's
[01:58:52] guarding? Try to harvest some elemental
[01:58:54] sacks. I'm not a not a bad idea. All
[01:58:57] right. I like it. I sound I like the
[01:58:58] sound of that big BK. So, you go and you
[01:59:00] look and you find uh You know what? I
[01:59:03] like the idea of that. You know, you cut
[01:59:05] them open, you're looking through them,
[01:59:06] and somebody there's one two fire, one
[01:59:11] water, and uh two waters and one um
[01:59:16] electric sack that you guys find. We'll
[01:59:18] have to figure those one out. So, what
[01:59:19] do you guys want to do with those? You
[01:59:20] can trade everybody take one because I
[01:59:22] think there's five of
[01:59:25] you. And then, uh who knows what you can
[01:59:28] do with it later? One of the fire sacks.
[01:59:30] All right. Silver Sneak wants a
[01:59:33] fire. I like that
[01:59:36] idea. Fire
[01:59:41] sack. Fire
[01:59:47] sack. By your powers
[01:59:51] combined. Got to go though. See you
[01:59:53] later. All right. Have a good one.
[01:59:54] Silver. You'll take the water one.
[01:59:55] Broki. Broki goes with the water.
[02:00:03] water
[02:00:04] sack. All
[02:00:06] right, take the largest sack. I like it.
[02:00:09] I'll just take whatever's left. I don't
[02:00:11] really care. Take whatever's left over.
[02:00:13] All right, so we have um we'll go with a
[02:00:16] a water sack for Big
[02:00:25] BK. We'll go with a fire sack for
[02:00:28] Halloween.
[02:00:30] Actually, we're going to give you the
[02:00:33] lightning sack
[02:00:36] and then we'll give um our buddy Mystic
[02:00:40] the fire
[02:00:43] sack. All
[02:00:46] right. You want to take uh you'll take
[02:00:48] whatever you want to know what's behind
[02:00:49] it. Dragons protect something. They do
[02:00:51] generally protect something. That is
[02:00:53] correct.
[02:00:55] So, as you
[02:00:57] um wander in there, you're looking
[02:01:00] behind him. You're trying to scooch
[02:01:02] behind the guy. He's caking up most of
[02:01:03] that place. As you're going
[02:01:06] behind, you can definitely take the
[02:01:09] scales and try to make some scrolling uh
[02:01:10] throwing knives or maybe more of the uh
[02:01:14] horns. You They all want to butcher it
[02:01:16] up and take parts. Nails. Yeah, you can
[02:01:18] take some nails. Let's do some nails for
[02:01:20] it. Let's do that. Our buddy teeth. our
[02:01:24] buddy. Oh, who? No one asked for teeth.
[02:01:26] Halloween's going with some
[02:01:32] nails. How about dragon teeth? I'm
[02:01:34] guessing you're asking for tooth, too,
[02:01:36] now that they made a comment about it,
[02:01:37] huh? Yeah, nails and dragon teeth. All
[02:01:41] right, there you go.
[02:01:44] So, you all go and look behind the
[02:01:46] dragon. You're trying to figure out what
[02:01:49] the is going on here. What was this
[02:01:52] thing blocking? You found these weird
[02:01:54] code discs opening
[02:01:59] things. All right. And you see this
[02:02:02] thing in the
[02:02:10] background? See this thing in the
[02:02:12] background? What in the hell was that
[02:02:14] thing
[02:02:15] guarding? you kind of walk towards it,
[02:02:18] but as you go towards
[02:02:20] it, it kind of uh wisps up and
[02:02:25] disappears, but when it
[02:02:29] disappears, Big B feels a weird uh
[02:02:35] electrical shock that goes into his
[02:02:39] bag. and he looks and he fe he he grabs
[02:02:42] in his bag and that code disc is uh
[02:02:45] slightly electrified now. But he doesn't
[02:02:46] really understand what's going on. What
[02:02:49] was he hiding back
[02:02:53] there? Well, the portal closed when you
[02:02:55] go towards it. That's what happened. The
[02:02:58] portal closed as you went towards it.
[02:03:01] But you do seem to have something that
[02:03:03] uh was weirdly associated with it. I
[02:03:05] We're not really sure. Take the disc
[02:03:08] out.
[02:03:09] You look at it trying to see what's
[02:03:11] going
[02:03:12] on. Nothing any Bitcoin not on the
[02:03:17] [Laughter]
[02:03:19] disc. Yes, there was like 300 Bitcoin
[02:03:22] found on the disc. We just don't know
[02:03:24] what the uh the passphrase is to get
[02:03:30] in. I know everybody forgets their
[02:03:33] passphrase all the time. It's the
[02:03:35] biggest problem we got here, you know.
[02:03:38] Got to watch out. So, you guys have uh
[02:03:41] you killed the
[02:03:43] dragon. You see that there's something
[02:03:45] having to do with a portal that was in
[02:03:48] the back of the cave that it was
[02:03:49] guarding slowly disappeared as Big BK
[02:03:52] went to it. Maybe it was open larger and
[02:03:54] as you killed the dragon, it just slowly
[02:03:56] disappeared. Who knows? Maybe. I don't
[02:03:58] know. That's weird. It was guarding it.
[02:04:00] Now, if anybody wants to jump in on our
[02:04:02] uh on our stuff we got going on here. We
[02:04:04] still have our adventuring. We do. Not a
[02:04:06] problem.
[02:04:08] Halloween. All right. Well, I I like the
[02:04:10] idea of that. I like the idea of that,
[02:04:12] guys. Make it into home base. I don't
[02:04:14] Well, I don't know if it'll be home
[02:04:16] base. You could try to That's not a bad
[02:04:19] one with the carcass of the dragon there
[02:04:22] because interestingly, all the pieces
[02:04:24] that you see there and I say this is the
[02:04:27] the intriguing part about the dragon
[02:04:29] here. All
[02:04:30] right. You notice that you're all taking
[02:04:32] pieces of
[02:04:34] it. And as you take pieces of it, seems
[02:04:38] like some of it starts to uh I don't
[02:04:40] like it. Maybe growing back. You're not
[02:04:43] really sure, but it's very very slow.
[02:04:46] It's hard to notice. You just look over,
[02:04:47] you know, it's like it's healed in one
[02:04:48] of the places that you cut off one of
[02:04:51] the
[02:04:53] horns. All right, Big
[02:04:56] BK. I like it. Coming in with some more
[02:05:00] supplies as they wander around. Where
[02:05:03] would you like to go, my friend?
[02:05:08] big. That would make sense for Hydra. I
[02:05:11] know it heals. And plus, if I was
[02:05:13] guarding a portal of some kind, who
[02:05:15] knows what that portal did or where it
[02:05:17] came from or I don't know. This is
[02:05:19] crazy. We got some craziness going on
[02:05:21] here. Now, for those of you that aren't
[02:05:22] aware, we have a um we do some YouTube
[02:05:27] shorts if you want to check those out.
[02:05:29] That gives a little bit of the first the
[02:05:30] last two shorts give a little bit of a
[02:05:32] idea of what's going on here. and why we
[02:05:34] got this stuff occurring. What's going
[02:05:35] on with the disc and the portals and uh
[02:05:38] everything like that. All right,
[02:05:39] Halloween. Now, Big BK, let me know what
[02:05:42] you want here, my friend.
[02:05:48] Hey, Blooper. Hey, Blooper. How's it
[02:05:50] going, buddy?
[02:05:52] Wherever. All right. Hey, Nolan. Will
[02:05:54] Yep. Want to I mean, Will, you're right
[02:05:56] here. You want to grab it? See what you
[02:06:00] get? See which one's lucky?
[02:06:05] All
[02:06:06] right, that one. All right, this is the
[02:06:08] one, I guess. Let's see if Will has the
[02:06:12] luck for you, my friend. I think that
[02:06:15] he's pulled out good ones. Hey, Boop.
[02:06:17] How's it going, my friend? You good one.
[02:06:20] Yeah, you did get the one that had the
[02:06:21] Ugan. Yeah, that is true. All right,
[02:06:23] good luck everybody. Let's see what we
[02:06:24] get here today. Humbling Elder Fortress

[02:06:47] Intriguing there. Lotus Light Dancers.
[02:06:51] Another zombie. I guess you have a
[02:06:52] zombie deck you're going to be making
[02:06:53] here. Nice rare rune scale Stormb Brood
[02:06:56] for a foil. Thornwood falls in a foil
[02:06:59] and your R card of Dragon Fire Blade.
[02:07:02] That's actually kind of cool looking art
[02:07:03] on that one. I like
[02:07:04] that. All right. Well, you're at the end
[02:07:08] there. You're you're looking at your
[02:07:11] um you're looking at your code
[02:07:15] disc that you
[02:07:18] found. That portal as it closes up
[02:07:22] rumbles the cave a little
[02:07:25] bit and in the back of the
[02:07:33] cave in the back of the
[02:07:36] cave you see a uh an old chest that's
[02:07:43] locked. Yes, I did see D and D came out
[02:07:46] with a dragon set. I did see
[02:07:49] that. That's a That should be a fun one.
[02:07:52] I've been Well, see, I have a I have
[02:07:54] actually a whole wasteland um uh
[02:07:57] campaign that I built. I I just haven't
[02:07:59] done I haven't had the time to go and do
[02:08:01] it with people. All right. You go over
[02:08:02] to it. You go to open it. All right.
[02:08:04] Now, you have It's going to be a high.
[02:08:07] You said always high. Never mind. Always
[02:08:09] high. So, you have to have seven or
[02:08:13] higher. Oh, there you go. 18. You open
[02:08:16] that up and inside that well, you find
[02:08:20] out what the dragon was
[02:08:22] hiding. There
[02:08:24] is
[02:08:27] 30 four Pogs that are found plus a bunch
[02:08:31] of pre-war
[02:08:33] money and some scrap metal. Now, the
[02:08:37] scrap metal that they had was not
[02:08:39] regular metal. It was gold and platinum.
[02:08:46] Oh, nice. Halloween taking it all. All
[02:08:49] right. Well, you're getting a little um
[02:08:51] you're getting a little looted down, my
[02:08:53] friend. So, you're going to take the um
[02:08:56] gold platinum.
[02:09:01] Um, you're going to
[02:09:03] grab the
[02:09:06] Pogs
[02:09:09] also. Bringing you up to
[02:09:14] 267 pogs. You got to get to it. Have
[02:09:17] somebody to go. Hey,
[02:09:20] Oblivion. There you go. So, you found
[02:09:22] some interesting supplies there, huh? I
[02:09:26] wonder where those came from. Those are
[02:09:27] Those aren't normal. Not bad. How you
[02:09:29] doing, my friend?
[02:09:32] How many Pogs do you have
[02:09:34] Halloween? You've got 12 Pogs Halloween,
[02:09:37] but you do have some things you could
[02:09:38] trade potentially. Who
[02:09:40] knows? That's good to hear. That's good
[02:09:42] to hear. You're all right. We'll only go
[02:09:43] here for a little while longer because
[02:09:45] we're going to have to uh stop, take
[02:09:46] over, and go and do some of our, you
[02:09:48] know, our
[02:09:49] um put some stuff together for the boat.
[02:09:52] See if we can get onto the onto the dock
[02:09:54] here so that we can get our stuff on.
[02:09:56] So, it'll only be a little while longer.
[02:09:57] How's it going, everybody? Hopefully we
[02:10:00] can have a good one here. We just beat a
[02:10:03] dragon. We had a bit of a fight there.
[02:10:05] We beat the dragon. You guys saw
[02:10:07] something having to do with our
[02:10:09] wasteland. Now, uh how it came to be.
[02:10:12] You guys starting to understand how the
[02:10:14] wasteland came to be now. Who knows what
[02:10:17] happened here. Oh no, that's not what I
[02:10:23] wanted. You're trying to learn where the
[02:10:25] how the wasteland came to be. And you uh
[02:10:28] you find this cave port in the port
[02:10:30] portal that was in the back of the cave
[02:10:31] closed up when you were hanging out with
[02:10:32] that dragon
[02:10:35] there in your fabric and leather. I like
[02:10:39] it. Uh potentially it depends on the
[02:10:42] time of day. Oblivion actually. I might
[02:10:44] be I might be able
[02:10:47] to. That's not I I might be able to do
[02:10:49] that later on in the uh later on this
[02:10:51] evening after I'm done like doing some
[02:10:52] of the boat stuff that we Well, if we
[02:10:54] can't get on the dock today, I can't
[02:10:55] really [ __ ] do anything. Sorry for
[02:10:57] swearing. I can't really do anything cuz
[02:10:59] we have to put an arch on the boat and I
[02:11:00] have to make I have to take the arch and
[02:11:02] put it in place to make sure
[02:11:03] everything's right for the footings
[02:11:04] before I drill holes in my boat, but we
[02:11:07] haven't been able to get to the dock yet
[02:11:08] cuz there was a boat that lost its
[02:11:10] rudder. So, it was on the dock emergency
[02:11:12] wise for a little bit that we were going
[02:11:13] to go on and just we just have a
[02:11:16] headache. We've had a bit of a headache
[02:11:17] going on. So, we're just waiting to get
[02:11:18] over
[02:11:20] there. How much leather you have
[02:11:22] Halloween? Halloween. You have uh one
[02:11:26] leather. You have the dragon scales, the
[02:11:28] lightning sack, dragon nails, dragon
[02:11:31] teeth.
[02:11:49] And that's it. The dragon stuff that you
[02:11:50] just picked up. one the
[02:11:57] leather. No, no, you have to go and
[02:11:59] watch the uh watch the shorts. You'll
[02:12:01] get a little bit of an understanding
[02:12:02] from the beginning of it. The first two
[02:12:04] shorts, the last two shorts I made give
[02:12:05] a little bit of an understanding of how
[02:12:07] how we began. We also have us opening
[02:12:08] packs. We open a couple of packs from
[02:12:10] boxes.
[02:12:12] Yeah, you did pick up your throw
[02:12:14] throwing
[02:12:17] knives. To make a bag, you need to have
[02:12:20] um you can make a small bag potentially.
[02:12:22] It's like trying your luck on it with
[02:12:23] one leather. It gives you like a couple
[02:12:25] extra spots, three spots, I think. If
[02:12:27] you want a bigger bag, you need to have
[02:12:28] more leather is really how much leather
[02:12:29] you have to make them. Yes. You save up
[02:12:32] for the bigger bag. You can save up for
[02:12:34] another one.
[02:12:37] Yes. You're back to your throwing
[02:12:38] knives. All of them. You pick You can
[02:12:39] pick all of them up. That is correct.
[02:12:40] So, let me uh I got to make sure we have
[02:12:42] them all in there. You're back to your
[02:12:44] 11 throwing knives. That is correct.
[02:12:50] Do you want to you want to reccon an
[02:12:52] upgrade from before? What do you want to
[02:12:54] do? Um maybe I mean I guess if you have
[02:12:58] the right person that can help you, you
[02:13:00] might be able to repcon and upgrade from
[02:13:02] before.
[02:13:03] [Music]
[02:13:04] Um what are you looking
[02:13:10] for? Where we were
[02:13:14] before? Yeah. Yeah. Like Yeah. an
[02:13:16] upgrade from that. Yeah. Yeah, there's
[02:13:18] Well, there's vaults around here. You
[02:13:19] broke out of that vault and went
[02:13:20] somewhere else. And you have all your
[02:13:22] stuff from before, actually, too, by the
[02:13:24] way. You never lost that. You keep all
[02:13:25] that thing. You have your alien gat, you
[02:13:27] have your AR sword, your plasma rifle,
[02:13:29] your pistol, you have a map
[02:13:31] fragment. But if there was an upgrade
[02:13:33] from before that you wanted, yeah, you
[02:13:35] can try to use that. What one do you
[02:13:36] want?
[02:13:39] Y'all, it's all part of the same thing.
[02:13:41] What happened was the initial start was
[02:13:42] in the vault. You guys are in there and
[02:13:44] you had to make your way out of the
[02:13:46] first one. Good one for you. Oh, let's
[02:13:49] see. Missing enforcer. You have the
[02:13:51] alien gat. You have the AR, the sword,
[02:13:53] the plasma rifle,
[02:13:56] pistol, dragon
[02:13:58] scales, and the we All right. Dragon
[02:14:01] horns, the fire. You know what I think
[02:14:02] you should do? I think you should try to
[02:14:05] do the alien gat, which shoots out like
[02:14:08] plasma things shots, but with your uh
[02:14:11] your fire sack. And then maybe one of
[02:14:14] the wis that you have because you have a
[02:14:15] metal wenus and you also have a dragon
[02:14:18] wenus. Um and
[02:14:21] then maybe uh and and throw one of those
[02:14:24] in there for uh as a like you know as um
[02:14:26] if somebody gets too close it will be a
[02:14:29] uh it'll be like a the saber on the end
[02:14:31] to stab them
[02:14:36] with. Boop. Boop. You my friend. Let's
[02:14:40] see. Let's see what you got. Boop. Boop.
[02:14:42] You have a pistol and a knife is all
[02:14:45] that you have right now, my friend, is a
[02:14:47] pistol and knife. All right, have a good
[02:14:50] one. All right, have a good one, my
[02:14:53] friend. Halloween and good have a good
[02:14:54] day at work. Um, we will uh we'll see
[02:14:56] you guys around. We'll see you tomorrow
[02:14:57] morning. We'll be doing this again
[02:14:58] tomorrow morning. So, if you want to
[02:14:59] jump in and hang out, we'll be doing
[02:15:00] some more like this tomorrow morning.
[02:15:02] You guys have not gotten to the uh the
[02:15:04] final boss of the area, though. That was
[02:15:06] only a mini boss.
[02:15:11] Oh no.
[02:15:12] Spoiler alert. Oh, there's only a mini
[02:15:14] boss. Spoiler alert. Spoiler alert.
[02:15:17] Enough. All right.
[02:15:22] Did it not come back? You did have a
[02:15:24] rifle. Why didn't
[02:15:25] [Music]
[02:15:31] it Why is it on? I remember you
[02:15:36] having Oh, I was looking at the wrong
[02:15:38] person. There is two boop names. Booper.
[02:15:41] I was looking at the wrong one. You have
[02:15:43] two rations, 82 health, a pistol, a
[02:15:45] knife, and a plasma rifle. I'm sorry
[02:15:47] about that. There's two people with the
[02:15:49] name Boop, and I looked at the wrong
[02:15:51] boop that I had. I'm sorry about that.
[02:15:55] You have
[02:15:56] uh the assault rifle there, so you're
[02:15:58] good. You got some time. Double alien
[02:16:00] wing gat. That gun gun cost me. It is
[02:16:04] double alien wing fire gat is what it
[02:16:08] is. Yeah. So, what I would say is uh
[02:16:11] mystic, you probably have to um you
[02:16:14] definitely have to get somewhere. And my
[02:16:16] guess is that um you probably going to
[02:16:19] have to
[02:16:21] uh talk to one of these. You have some I
[02:16:24] think Mystic has access to one of these
[02:16:26] places. Hold on. Do they have a friend
[02:16:27] here?
[02:16:30] No, they did not have access to a
[02:16:32] friend. But you know what I mean? If you
[02:16:34] want to wander around and go and talk to
[02:16:35] one of these people in the wasteland, I
[02:16:37] know you've bumped into them before. You
[02:16:38] know where they
[02:16:39] are. Can see what
[02:16:47] happens. And you go over there and see
[02:16:49] if you can upgrade
[02:16:52] [Music]
[02:16:56] it. Boobs. He's like, I can make a bag
[02:16:58] in real life. Can I just transfer it in
[02:16:59] the game? You know what, Boop? If you
[02:17:01] know how to make a bag in real life, I
[02:17:04] will say I I'll let you become like a
[02:17:06] tailor so you can as as like a side
[02:17:08] thing so you can do some of that stuff,
[02:17:09] help people out, fix maybe armor, and
[02:17:11] get some things together when you're
[02:17:14] around. All right. So, you head over,
[02:17:16] you're going to head over to uh Do you
[02:17:18] want to go to the heading door, the hole
[02:17:20] in the wall, the locked room, or the
[02:17:22] storage vendor? Who you going to, my
[02:17:25] buddy Mystic?
[02:17:29] And remember everybody, you guys can
[02:17:30] continue jumping in with our uh our
[02:17:32] packs with our wasteland game here. I
[02:17:35] know some of you had been in here
[02:17:36] before. That's why we're just uh kind of
[02:17:37] finishing out some of the things you
[02:17:38] were at.
[02:17:41] Oh, well, there you go. Perfect. You can
[02:17:42] make it back out of a hoodie.
[02:17:44] All right. Well, you know what? Probably
[02:17:47] going to be locked room is your best bet
[02:17:49] there. So, you head over locked room.
[02:17:53] All right. We might get a few waves
[02:17:55] here. and you talk to our buddy um here
[02:17:57] in the locked
[02:18:03] room and uh
[02:18:06] Schmidy in the locked room here goes,
[02:18:08] "Hey, what are you
[02:18:10] doing?" You tell him, "I have some
[02:18:12] things I'd like you to upgrade. I have
[02:18:14] um some things." is you drop him down on
[02:18:17] the
[02:18:19] uh on the thing in front of him on the
[02:18:21] desk in front of
[02:18:22] him. And what you see what he sees? He
[02:18:25] goes, "All right. Well, that's an alien
[02:18:27] gat. Nice. I like that." Um but you got
[02:18:31] two a metal wenus and a dragon wenus.
[02:18:32] That's weird. Uh and you have Oh, the
[02:18:36] fire sack. Oh, I haven't seen one of
[02:18:38] those. Interesting. All right. Well, you
[02:18:41] going to put all those together, you
[02:18:42] say?
[02:18:45] He goes, "Wow, that's interesting." All
[02:18:47] right, let's I mean, we can see what we
[02:18:48] can try to do. I don't know exactly what
[02:18:50] it's going to do here, but All right,
[02:18:51] let's put them all together. Now, that's
[02:18:53] going to cost a bit. That's going to be
[02:18:55] at least a day or so. So, ye, our buddy
[02:18:57] here, Mystic, you have 105 Pogs. He
[02:19:02] looks at you. He looks at um he looks at
[02:19:05] the
[02:19:06] items that he has there, the weapon of
[02:19:09] him, that alien guy. He's like, "You
[02:19:10] know what? I can potentially take that."
[02:19:11] All right. You know what?
[02:19:13] I like it. 100
[02:19:15] pogs. I can take care of this for you,
[02:19:18] says uh Schmidy.
[02:19:23] Let's see if anybody else wants to jump
[02:19:24] in hanging out.
[02:19:29] Oh, look. I took the pillow. I like
[02:19:30] that.
[02:19:32] We will get We'll get it. We'll get it
[02:19:33] going. We'll get it going. All right.
[02:19:36] You give
[02:19:37] him all those. You give him your money.
[02:19:40] You're down to five pogs. All right,
[02:19:42] let's see if anybody else wants to jump
[02:19:44] in, hang out in the wasteland with us,
[02:19:45] my
[02:19:47] friends. All right, so
[02:20:35] All right, let's see some craziness.
[02:20:38] Yeah, let's see what
[02:20:43] happens. Good morning, Claire. How's it
[02:20:45] going, Darius Clowing? Thank you coming
[02:20:48] in. Ashley, I appreciate you all coming
[02:20:50] in, hanging out. All right, let's see
[02:20:52] what we got for our image to pop up.
[02:20:57] Um,
[02:21:00] that does not look like
[02:21:08] I don't like that one. We're going to
[02:21:09] try that
[02:21:11] again. Seven years later. I know.
[02:21:16] So, you go. Can't rush perfection. No,
[02:21:18] you go and you know what? You take that
[02:21:20] thing and you go make a a bag out of it.
[02:21:23] So,
[02:21:25] Booper makes a bag and you now
[02:21:29] have a bag that allows you to have 10
[02:21:32] spots. There you go, buddy. You got
[02:21:35] yourself a small bag.
[02:22:04] Can't can't rush perfection. No, we
[02:22:06] can't. No, you have 10 spots instead of
[02:22:09] seven now. So, three additional spots.
[02:22:12] Three additional spots is what it is.
[02:22:14] Yes, correct.
[02:22:23] Interesting.
[02:22:25] I don't think it's understanding.
[02:22:27] No, I don't think it is
[02:22:30] either. Hold
[02:22:32] on. Hold
[02:22:40] on. Let's try that. Yeah.
[02:22:44] No, it won't let you do it.
[02:22:53] Let's see if we'll do that.
[02:23:08] This is not going to work. No, it's not.
[02:23:13] Boopy little bag. Did they leave a
[02:23:15] toolbox? No one left a toolbox when they
[02:23:16] were there. No, they did not leave a
[02:23:18] toolbox. I'm sorry.
[02:23:23] No.
[02:23:26] No. That doesn't
[02:23:29] work. Okay, let's do
[02:23:35] this. Let's try this then. I don't like
[02:23:38] how that's working.
[02:23:43] Let's see if I can do
[02:23:57] this. Let's see if I can do it here
[02:24:01] instead cuz it doesn't like me right
[02:24:04] here right now. You searching around. I
[02:24:06] like it. So, you go and searching
[02:24:07] around. You're uh you were in that
[02:24:09] ballorn armor. You woke up. He took a
[02:24:10] pillow sack to uh to take some some
[02:24:12] stuff there. Take a rest
[02:24:15] there after you took your rest there. I
[02:24:17] mean, you grabbed one of
[02:24:28] those and in
[02:24:31] there you're going through and you don't
[02:24:33] see too much. So, you decided to head on
[02:24:36] out of there. There's not really much
[02:24:37] around. Oh, that was the wrong place.
[02:24:39] you were in
[02:24:40] here. You decide to head out. There's
[02:24:42] not too much in there. You do see that
[02:24:44] there's a hole over there. You can try
[02:24:45] to call through the hole if you like on
[02:24:47] the uh left side
[02:24:50] there. And let's do this. Put this over
[02:25:04] here. We'll see what comes up.
[02:25:12] Oh, it takes time. I guess I'm going to
[02:25:14] go search around now. No one's going to
[02:25:16] try this here. It's uh getting later in
[02:25:18] the day. I know generally this is about
[02:25:20] time most people are already getting
[02:25:21] into work and being a Friday. I think I
[02:25:23] will do something maybe in the afternoon
[02:25:25] if we don't have anything going on. Um
[02:25:27] if we don't get depending on if we're
[02:25:28] able to get over to the dock or not is
[02:25:29] really what it boils down to. That's the
[02:25:32] only frustrating thing. We got to wait
[02:25:52] on Ah, it doesn't want to work. They're
[02:25:54] taking time. What did you find? Well,
[02:25:57] you're scavening around. You didn't,
[02:25:59] that's why I said you didn't really find
[02:26:00] anything, but you did see there was the
[02:26:02] hole over there on the uh the left side
[02:26:04] where the zombies were that had been
[02:26:06] covered up. No, the zombies the ghouls
[02:26:08] were. So, you have an opportunity uh
[02:26:10] when you're scavenging around. You don't
[02:26:12] find anything there, but you do see a
[02:26:13] hole. You can maybe uncover it if you'd
[02:26:15] like, but um or you can head on out to
[02:26:17] some of the other locations and see what
[02:26:19] else you going going on around.
[02:26:34] All
[02:26:35] right, let me know. We're going to got a
[02:26:38] couple more of these going today. See if
[02:26:39] you guys want to hang out with some of
[02:26:41] them. We had some fun today. We hit a
[02:26:42] million views on YouTube the other day,
[02:26:44] so it was kind of
[02:26:47] fun. Ah, you scan it all. All right, so
[02:26:50] you look, you see the hole there. You
[02:26:51] don't really see anything in the hole.
[02:26:53] and you scan further. You do a deeper
[02:26:55] search around. Then you see that you
[02:26:58] look and you see, well, it's blocked by
[02:26:59] this uh this cabinet. Let's go look in
[02:27:01] the cabinet. So, you go scavenge around
[02:27:03] in the cabinet. And inside the cabinet,
[02:27:05] you find some food
[02:27:07] supplies. And you also find a little bit
[02:27:10] of scrap metal. Well, I took I guess
[02:27:12] good one on that
[02:27:14] one. Not bad
[02:27:16] there. Thank you. Thank you. All right,
[02:27:19] here we go. Let's see what we got going
[02:27:21] on. Take it all. I like it.
[02:27:38] Stay.
[02:28:09] No. No. It won't. It's not giving me the
[02:28:11] image that we want here. All right. You
[02:28:13] take it all. I like it.
[02:28:18] Boopa. You loot and you take the metal.
[02:28:23] and the
[02:28:25] food. All
[02:28:30] righty. And then it looks like we'll try
[02:28:34] one more second here and see what goes
[02:28:35] on with
[02:28:39] this. And
[02:28:41] uh where'd that go?
[02:28:51] Um, there we are. Disappeared for some
[02:28:57] reason. I don't know why. That was
[02:29:00] silly. All right. Well, we kind of make
[02:29:02] the image for you. Can I break stuff for
[02:29:04] components? No. And there's nothing
[02:29:05] really to break in there for components.
[02:29:07] Um, the location's been kind of already
[02:29:10] been rummaged around a lot. There's not
[02:29:12] really much left. I mean, you could try
[02:29:13] to the handy helper bot, but I guarantee
[02:29:16] you that some of the other vault there
[02:29:18] that are hanging out will not be happy
[02:29:20] if you try to harm that
[02:29:26] guy. All righty, let's see what the last
[02:29:29] one made.
[02:29:38] Well, I don't think we're going to get
[02:29:39] exactly what we're looking for, but we
[02:29:41] might get something
[02:29:42] intriguing. There you
[02:29:45] go. This is uh You gave him your your
[02:29:48] time there. And uh this looks like he's
[02:29:51] almost done. He's got a few more things
[02:29:53] he's got to finish on there.
[02:30:02] Um, you go. It looks like Here you go,
[02:30:05] my
[02:30:08] friend. You've got yourself a uh a new
[02:30:12] alien gatling gun attached with a
[02:30:15] dragon's fire sack. That's going to be
[02:30:18] coming to you in a in a day or so.

[02:31:20] going. We have one, two, three, four,
[02:31:23] five, six, seven, and eight. Ooh, we got

[02:32:00] dragons coming out. Nice. With an island
[02:32:03] and a samurai.
[02:32:06] You're very
[02:32:07] welcome. You got a couple of the basic
[02:32:09] weapons you found
[02:32:16] there. Yes, you can go up to the man and
[02:32:19] say thank you. There you go, mystic.
[02:32:28] Nice one there to go with all the
[02:32:29] dragons that we have with everything.
[02:32:33] Yes, you definitely can. You go up to
[02:32:35] that guy. You say, "Hey, buddy. Thank
[02:32:37] you. Uh, thank you for letting me fall
[02:32:39] as take a nap here." I was I was quite
[02:32:40] tired, so that did help me. I very much
[02:32:42] appreciate that. He looks at you. Ah, no
[02:32:44] problem, buddy. Uh, we're we're
[02:32:46] generally a nice group here. We don't
[02:32:47] really just ask you not not steal from
[02:32:50] us, not cause any problems, you know,
[02:32:51] not ruin our stuff. That's all we look
[02:32:53] for here.
[02:32:55] Now,
[02:32:57] Mystic, you're hanging around there.
[02:32:58] It's been a little while. You get back
[02:33:00] and
[02:33:02] then you go back over to your friend
[02:33:04] there.
[02:33:08] Then you go, "Hey, uh, you done with
[02:33:10] that weapon yet?"
[02:33:13] He's like, "Oh, yeah. Yeah, I finished
[02:33:14] that that weapon." It's a little
[02:33:15] intriguing. Um, it's new. It's a new new
[02:33:19] formula, new setup. I've never done
[02:33:20] anything like this before, so you got to
[02:33:21] be careful with it.
[02:33:23] Um that the sack thing on the back is
[02:33:26] very um delicate. So be be careful with
[02:33:28] what's going on. All right.
[02:33:32] Oh, he's like, "Oh, pillow. What are you
[02:33:34] talking
[02:33:38] about?" Flasher vault insignia and
[02:33:40] whisper helicopter. Oh, you you can
[02:33:44] try cuz you are a mystic. You did become
[02:33:47] one of the vault. So, let's see. We have
[02:33:49] the insignia. Where is that faction? Oh,
[02:33:52] we didn't have the adult one, but you do
[02:33:54] show him it. Try the helicopter. He
[02:33:56] looks at you. He's like, "Ah, dude."
[02:33:58] Normally helicopters fly outside and
[02:34:00] they have a lot larger um propeller than
[02:34:03] you have, dude.
[02:34:07] You need a cup. You need a cup to
[02:34:09] protect the sack. You definitely need a
[02:34:11] cup to protect that sack. That's a good
[02:34:12] idea. Make something to protect it. Not
[02:34:15] bad.
[02:34:21] All right, guys. Let's see here. We got
[02:34:24] uh let's see. Let's get Let's do another

[02:36:58] Yeah, the closest one to the sink. All
[02:37:00] righty, Car
[02:37:01] Malcolm. There you go, my friend. Those
[02:37:04] are some nice ones. Oh, um, you have to
[02:37:06] see it in the in the chat. I have to
[02:37:07] pull up the chat specifically in a on
[02:37:09] like a on my phone to be able to see it
[02:37:11] that way cuz it pops up. It's like a um
[02:37:14] it's like an image, like a chat image in
[02:37:17] a way, like using things. I'll show you
[02:37:19] in a second. Hold on.
[02:37:21] What did you just say here? I'll show
[02:37:23] you what he says now, my friend. You're
[02:37:25] uh you're wandering around. There was
[02:37:27] some of those dragon stuff that was like
[02:37:29] whoa. You hear a rumble after something
[02:37:32] happened and closes down and you, my
[02:37:35] friend, are wandering
[02:37:37] around and um you happen to bump into
[02:37:40] this medium-sized raider that heard the
[02:37:42] same rumble. That medium-sized raider is
[02:37:45] trying to figure out what the hell is
[02:37:46] going on here and starts wandering that
[02:37:48] direction. Now, you have an encounter
[02:37:50] you can do. That's what it is.
[02:37:53] Let's see if I can find it.
[02:37:59] No, it's not there.
[02:38:04] There you go. So, you decide. Are you
[02:38:07] going to attack?
[02:38:09] You start singing Uranium Fever. I like
[02:38:11] it. While you wander around, I like it.
[02:38:12] That's a good one to sing. Carmeal.
[02:38:17] Are you going to attack? You have two
[02:38:21] pistols. some tech scraps. This guy's
[02:38:23] going to be all right. I like it. So,
[02:38:25] you have your two pistols. That means
[02:38:27] you get this for your roll. Now, it's
[02:38:29] going to be a 15 to hit them. The four
[02:38:32] does not help.
[02:38:34] Four does not help. I'm sorry. You
[02:38:37] missed. They only have a pistol. They go
[02:38:39] after you. And they needed a 13 to hit.
[02:38:41] Well, you got lucky.
[02:38:43] The mediumsiz raider missed you also.
[02:38:46] Well, I'm You're going to shoot again.
[02:38:47] Going after him. And you hit him. Oh,
[02:38:51] you hit him for 10. That's good because
[02:38:52] he's only a 20. So, he's down to health,
[02:38:56] half health. That mediumsiz raider
[02:38:59] screams in pain.
[02:39:02] Shoots at you again.
[02:39:04] And misses again. And he misses again.
[02:39:07] Well, look at that. Critical miss. Look
[02:39:09] at that. Almost a critical miss. Well,
[02:39:11] you your last chance here.
[02:39:16] No. Oh, no. You missed.
[02:39:19] Now that raider is already in half
[02:39:21] health there. They themselves are going
[02:39:24] to attack you to see if they get any one
[02:39:26] last luck and they miss also. Yeah. Now
[02:39:28] the raider being in pain and half in
[02:39:31] health turns around and runs. But as it
[02:39:34] turns to run it drops one of the
[02:39:36] slammers that was in his pocket. That
[02:39:37] means you go up 10 health. Car Malcolm I
[02:39:40] mean 10 not 10 10 pogs bring you up to
[02:39:42] 34 pogs. There you go my friend. All
[02:39:45] righty. Yep. Put that down. Yeah. Yeah,
[02:39:47] it's a it's a it's a it's a one of the
[02:39:49] slammers I use. There you go, my friend.

[02:46:13] forest and a scorpion dragon.
[02:46:18] You know what I'm talking about. Come
[02:46:19] on. You can't you can't not lie and say
[02:46:22] that does not look like Steven Seigal.
[02:46:24] Like somebody took a picture and copied
[02:46:27] Steven Seagull and threw some glasses on
[02:46:29] him and was like, "Oh, this is
[02:46:30] hypothesis.
[02:46:34] Who's Steven Seagull?"
[02:46:36] An actor from like action movies. uh in
[02:46:39] the 80s and 90s and I think maybe had a
[02:46:42] couple in the
[02:46:43] 2000s. Yeah. Well, you don't know. He's
[02:46:46] his face is is facing you. So, there
[02:46:48] might be a ponytail in the
[02:46:51] back. You don't know. I mean, there you
[02:46:54] know. So, it's only his face is on at
[02:46:56] you. You
[02:46:58] know, I know. If you had the ponytail on
[02:47:00] the side, that would be
[02:47:04] perfect. All right. Mystic's wandering
[02:47:06] around. I like it. Now Mystic is going
[02:47:09] for a
[02:47:10] wander. They're like, "You know what? I
[02:47:13] got my new
[02:47:14] weapon. I got to try that try that uh
[02:47:18] that dragon sack
[02:47:21] out." Ah, and you go
[02:47:24] wandering around and you're character
[02:47:27] for Mystic. I know. We need a character
[02:47:30] for Mystic now. Oh, I forgot about that.
[02:47:32] Yeah, we'll have to make one for you.
[02:47:34] You though, you bump into this. Well,
[02:47:43] go this mutant wandering around and it
[02:47:46] seems to have some plasma or some type
[02:47:48] of
[02:47:49] enhanced. What are you going to
[02:47:57] do now? The dragon one. What it does?
[02:48:00] Mystic your
[02:48:02] weapon. Have to get rid of this now.
[02:48:09] Call this the uh dragon sack.
[02:48:13] That's the name. Now
[02:48:18] um I'm giving it all those. Don't you
[02:48:21] have to delete the um dragon set and
[02:48:25] horns and the weenies? Yeah, I know.
[02:48:27] Okay. The fire. I'm looking for if there
[02:48:30] was anything else in them that I was
[02:48:32] missing. I don't think he used the horns
[02:48:34] though. Oh, he did. He did not use the
[02:48:36] horns.
[02:48:38] Dragon get some scales. Yeah. Uh I don't
[02:48:41] know if they
[02:48:43] did. Might be messy. Got to unload that
[02:48:46] dragon sack. Let's see what the first
[02:48:47] one
[02:48:49] does. All right.
[02:48:51] So, we
[02:48:54] see it takes in. And so what we're going
[02:48:56] to do here is we're going to give this
[02:48:57] is a
[02:49:00] uh I'm going give this one a plus
[02:49:03] seven. And then it is a one and
[02:49:08] four chance to light on fire. Light it
[02:49:12] on
[02:49:15] fire. All right. That's what you
[02:49:19] have. All right.
[02:49:22] So you see if you hit
[02:49:27] him. Well, that works. He's at 17. Oh, I
[02:49:30] forgot to add. Are you higher? What What
[02:49:31] number were you for your month? For your
[02:49:33] roll there for your four one and four.
[02:49:35] I'm going to have to reroll that. Unless
[02:49:37] it's, you know, whatever. If you want to
[02:49:38] say it's a four, we'll stay with four.
[02:49:39] But I like people being honest a lot of
[02:49:41] the time. So that's why I'm not too
[02:49:42] worried about it. But you're lucky to
[02:49:44] hit. You hit them for two,
[02:49:46] six, nine.
[02:49:51] All right.
[02:49:52] Well, that um mutant is hit for nine. He
[02:49:57] is a 20 health actually.
[02:50:01] Well, that Oh, no.
[02:50:09] The uh It looks
[02:50:11] like It looks like the uh the dragon gat
[02:50:16] worked.
[02:50:19] It didn't blow up. And the sack is still
[02:50:21] inflated. Well, that's
[02:50:26] intriguing. Was it as your number four
[02:50:29] for uh the for it being the special
[02:50:31] thing there or because that's what we're
[02:50:33] going to leave it at forever. We try to
[02:50:34] keep it always the same
[02:50:41] one. Going good. All right. Reroll on
[02:50:45] the one. What one you want for it?
[02:50:51] So you got nine. What number do you want
[02:50:53] for your one out of
[02:51:00] four? Number one. It is. Oh, game came
[02:51:04] as four again. So it doesn't light them
[02:51:06] on fire, but you cause some burn damage,
[02:51:10] which means
[02:51:11] uh you kind of uh one of part of its
[02:51:14] body is gets is is kind of burning on
[02:51:16] fire and melting. So with the plasma
[02:51:19] shot, so it loses uh this guy loses a
[02:51:21] limb
[02:51:23] here. This guy loses a limb here. He
[02:51:26] loses his left leg. Left leg, Will says.
[02:51:28] All right. But he attacks you. That was
[02:51:31] a big hit. But he attacks you with what
[02:51:34] he has left.
[02:51:38] Oh, buddy misses because of the leg.
[02:51:41] Because the leg missing. I'm guessing
[02:51:43] you're going to attack with a sack
[02:51:44] again.
[02:51:49] Oh, there is you. You killed it. Yeah.
[02:51:53] Well, that was pretty Yep. pretty good
[02:51:55] there. 22. Yeah, you just Oh, boy.

[02:51:59] uh your uh dragon
[02:52:02] gat let go a full
[02:52:06] sackload and
[02:52:09] uh that does that refill that uh well we
[02:52:14] we'll find out how it works that uh
[02:52:18] mutant burst into flames falls down in
[02:52:23] ashes to the ground. Now all you see is
[02:52:26] a pile of ash
[02:52:27] there. Nice one, my friend. Not
[02:52:32] bad.

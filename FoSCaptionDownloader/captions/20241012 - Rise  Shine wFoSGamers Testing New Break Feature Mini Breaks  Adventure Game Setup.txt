[03:33:09] Wheel of Fortune Style game we guys play
[03:33:12] then the uh the people that were the the
[03:33:14] winners or the top hits I've every every
[03:33:16] um day that we play the game I mean the
[03:33:19] big um the big Winners like who gets the
[03:33:21] most points we'll go on to a uh we're
[03:33:23] going to have a special one where in a
[03:33:25] couple months we'll do like a leaders
[03:33:27] round so there you go everybody yeah
[03:33:30] that's fine there we go put all those
[03:33:39] together they have a a
[03:33:42] couple we did not do the buyers yet
[03:33:45] normally do it around 10:30 to 11: so
[03:33:49] literally it's 10 I mean not 10 to 10:30
[03:33:51] and being
[03:33:52] 10:30 I need to do it
[03:33:55] now so this is what I'll
[03:34:04] do what you what do you mean beware for
[03:34:07] the
[03:34:08] wheel uh through a wheel of magic
[03:34:10] tomorrow yeah we play that tomorrow
[03:34:12] that's like a A Wheel of Fortune Style
[03:34:13] game it's here we do that like I was
[03:34:15] saying
[03:34:16] um if you were are you talking about
[03:34:17] what are you talking about
[03:34:20] wheel yeah it'll be on here
[03:34:26] correct all right we've have all that
[03:34:29] together we have that done now what I'm
[03:34:31] going to do here is is how how much of
[03:34:34] that is done step by the way yeah
[03:34:37] because I don't know how long it's going
[03:34:38] to be if it's going to be a while I
[03:34:39] might need to shut down because it does
[03:34:40] get really loud um they're done off the
[03:34:43] roof just back
[03:34:46] okay so it's not it's not I won't have
[03:34:48] it right next to me anymore no that's
[03:34:50] because they cutting it off the roof
[03:34:51] you're down on the roof it's just out
[03:34:52] back and I don't even know if they're
[03:34:53] cutting the tree back or if they're
[03:34:54] waiting for to do part of the tree back
[03:34:56] it's kind of oh I don't care we're
[03:34:58] trying to EAS Dr a little figure out
[03:35:00] what the plan was that's fine okay cool
[03:35:02] that works but that that is as close as
[03:35:04] you're gonna get from now on all right
[03:35:05] that's all right all right I I think we
[03:35:07] can do that they had to trim the bush
[03:35:08] right outside the window to get the
[03:35:10] truck thing and that's oh that's why I
[03:35:12] was hearing such loudness all right
[03:35:19] no I do not right at the moment I do um
[03:35:24] yeah I knocked it over by
[03:35:25] accident actually you know what um drink

[03:53:40] welcome that's like a not a cheap one
[03:53:42] too I believe that's a good pickup if I
[03:53:44] remember
[03:53:45] it used to be like a $7 thing there by
[03:53:47] the
[03:53:51] way I don't know what it's worth now
[03:53:53] things fluctuate so
[03:53:58] much a little
[03:54:00] bit there you
[03:54:02] go all right now I ended on that
[03:54:05] one and I got to go on to the first one
[03:54:08] here
[03:54:14] no one wanted that one we have some
[03:54:16] spots in the break there if you guys
[03:54:17] want to jump
[03:54:19] in we did some it was requested I do one
[03:54:21] more I'll ping a
[03:54:24] friend I think there was a I thought he
[03:54:26] was in here but I'll I'll check and I'll
[03:54:31] ping after I finish handing these out
[03:54:38] [Music]
[03:54:45] how's it going it
[03:54:50] going yes from the earlier one brake
[03:54:53] thing works nicely aome I know I saw on
[03:54:56] my side yeah it looks nice on your side
[03:54:59] yeah I like it just boom yeah and it
[03:55:01] shows the how many spots how many spots
[03:55:03] are left and everything and then you
[03:55:05] actually even see what number you are
[03:55:07] and that stuff too yeah it's opening
[03:55:10] current state yeah and it sends you a
[03:55:11] message and stuff I didn't know that
[03:55:13] it's supposed to send them a message all
[03:55:15] the people that are in there so that's
[03:55:17] why I liked it because you do it now and
[03:55:19] then it automatically sends a message
[03:55:20] when you says you're starting the
[03:55:22] break and then I get to say I ended the
[03:55:24] break which would be once I finish
[03:55:26] handing these out I'm going say I I
[03:55:28] ended
[03:55:29] it so they know all their stuff was
[03:55:32] completely handed
[03:55:36] out so like now I'll go like this and be
[03:55:42] like break
[03:55:47] manage
[03:55:52] finish and remove everything from there
[03:55:54] now because it's all
[03:55:55] done we get fireworks no but let's see

[04:01:03] like how hard is it to scan a package
[04:01:05] and put it in your goddamn truck I mean
[04:01:08] like God seriously
[04:01:19] but yeah I've had some we've had some

[04:01:40] not we'll do that we'll run the first
[04:01:43] one there you

[04:01:49] to get it going for spot number one that
[04:01:52] way we can be halfway done oh they are

[04:01:55] you guys they are you see should be able
[04:01:58] to see them right
[04:02:02] here we have
[04:02:04] ioria
[04:02:05] Ravnica modern Horizon modern Horizon 2
[04:02:09] commer Masters set bloomo and DUS Moren
[04:02:13] those are what there it's actually
[04:02:14] listed it should be listed in the in it
[04:02:16] too for the break and the details if you
[04:02:18] look at the break
[04:02:21] details if you go and look at where my
[04:02:23] brakes are it should be a tab for
[04:02:32] brakes
[04:02:35] yes yes and you should be able to see uh
[04:02:37] the brakes and what's in there it's new
[04:02:40] that's why I um I requested to be part
[04:02:42] of the beta feature so that I could test
[04:02:44] it out with you guys and see how you
[04:02:45] like it yes it's a new one they let me
[04:02:48] join a beta thing I know pretty sweet
[04:02:50] Isn't
[04:02:52] it nice I
[04:02:55] know I have some um intriguing ideas on
[04:02:58] using it
[04:03:00] too I have some intriguing ideas for
[04:03:02] using this too I think I can use it for
[04:03:04] some other fun things not like yes for
[04:03:06] breaks it would be the same concept but
[04:03:09] it will be a I it'll work fun with some
[04:03:11] of the games that we have that we've
[04:03:13] done before
[04:03:14] I think we can integrate this very
[04:03:17] nicely with some of the adventure game
[04:03:19] even
[04:03:20] o like kind of pick your own adventure
[04:03:23] person spot that's not bad oh we got
[04:03:26] spot number oh look at that that means
[04:03:29] we only
[04:03:31] have three spots left wants to get spot
[04:03:35] number
[04:03:36] two three spots left in the break there
[04:03:39] my
[04:03:40] friends that break today
[04:03:44] the last one we'll be doing is ioria
[04:03:46] Ravnica modern Horizon one three two
[04:03:50] Commander
[04:03:51] Masters set bloomo collector and dusk M
[04:03:58] collector I know it's pretty cool I have
[04:04:00] to
[04:04:03] say I actually have an idea of how I can
[04:04:05] use it with some of the other games that
[04:04:06] I do
[04:04:16] thirsty
[04:04:17] sorry how I normally do them the same
[04:04:20] way I always do
[04:04:21] them um I thought I had it listed in the
[04:04:24] notes if I do not have it in the show
[04:04:25] notes I all show notes don't have
[04:04:27] anything all right
[04:04:29] sorry I'll put it in the show notes here
[04:04:30] in a minute the way that I do breaks is
[04:04:32] I take all the commons all the mythics
[04:04:35] rares and uncommons are commons that are
[04:04:37] worth $3 so all mythics and rares no
[04:04:39] matter what and any uncommon uncommon or
[04:04:43] common is $3 or more I put them in his
[04:04:45] sleeves and then I shuffle them up and I
[04:04:47] hand them out to the spots so like say
[04:04:49] for instance you buy Spot two you'll be
[04:04:51] the second one that'll get handed out to
[04:04:53] after I shuffle them up and that's how I
[04:04:56] do
[04:04:56] it pretty pretty easy pretty
[04:04:58] straightforward and one of the other
[04:05:00] things here is being um a break the way
[04:05:03] we need to know I need to have something
[04:05:05] down where your name on it you're going
[04:05:07] to get a pull out of one of these there
[04:05:08] used to be 20 in here I need to refill
[04:05:10] them it's now down to 10 cu we did a
[04:05:12] break from earlier if you can get the
[04:05:14] then you get one of these they're benjes
[04:05:16] you saw what kind of get pulled out
[04:05:17] earlier we write your name on this just
[04:05:19] as a proxy that way I know who's who
[04:05:22] when I'm handing the cards out so you
[04:05:23] also get one of those fun
[04:05:25] things there we
[04:05:27] are and let me erase these so I can use

[04:59:31] they took they took me some time to
[04:59:33] figure out how to get them but there you
[04:59:34] go we give you that one buddy and then
[04:59:36] my friend here
[04:59:38] um simply
[04:59:41] you had a choice there got a purple dice
[04:59:44] uh let me see if I have a purple one I
[04:59:45] don't think I have a purple bullet one I
[04:59:47] think we have
[04:59:49] pink pink gold and red I've requested
[04:59:55] purple ones for my next ones that are
[04:59:57] coming in but these are the colors that
[05:00:00] we have right
[05:00:03] now Pink gold and red red all right so
[05:00:09] you have
[05:00:14] these ones a number one through eight
[05:00:15] and 100 which is really just by
[05:00:19] 10 so which one do you
[05:00:23] want the one to 100 the you go and you
[05:00:26] can use that that nice little counter on
[05:00:28] things it's kind of what I feel like
[05:00:30] they're fun with you can be counters you
[05:00:31] know there you
[05:00:34] go like I said I can't guarantee you're
[05:00:37] always going to get anything but I like
[05:00:38] to give you at least a little something
[05:00:39] extra that's worth a couple bucks or so
[05:00:41] you know say thank you for hanging out
[05:00:43] with us and and and trying it out
[05:00:46] here now you're very welcome
[05:00:49] buddy like I said I can't guarantee it
[05:00:52] but I can always try to give a little
[05:00:53] little bit
[05:00:54] extra all right here we go let me hand
[05:00:58] out everything from these got a frog in
[05:01:02] my throat for some reason so that
[05:01:04] everybody gets all the stuff here
[05:01:11] weird frog in my throat right now I've
[05:01:13] been drinking a lot of water too I
[05:01:15] wonder if I'm drinking too much water n
[05:01:18] that can't be it that doesn't make sense
[05:01:20] I haven't drank enough that's probably
[05:01:21] what it is I've not drank enough this
[05:01:24] entire
[05:01:25] show probably have to pound some water
[05:01:28] when I get
[05:01:29] done then go pee excessively
[05:01:36] again there you go
[05:01:42] all righty nice we like the breaks now
[05:01:46] we will be on tomorrow morning tomorrow
[05:01:48] morning we are going to be doing our um
[05:01:52] wheel of magic has anybody been around
[05:01:54] for Wheel of
[05:01:58] magic has anybody been around for Wheel
[05:02:00] of magic

[05:02:11] Wheel of Fortune but with magic cards as
[05:02:14] the

[05:02:36] fun so I'll be doing that I think I'm
[05:02:39] going to have a couple other other games
[05:02:40] that I've had ideas for that I'm going
[05:02:42] to start coming out with and should I do

[05:02:45] morning game shows with you guys and do
[05:02:47] like different versions of game things
[05:02:49] that I had ideas for and do different
[05:02:51] just different ones every morning along
[05:02:53] with along with the breaks and stuff
[05:02:55] like that yes but like have the game
[05:02:57] show so that while the break is being
[05:02:59] filled we can do our game show or
[05:03:01] whatever I don't know I was thinking

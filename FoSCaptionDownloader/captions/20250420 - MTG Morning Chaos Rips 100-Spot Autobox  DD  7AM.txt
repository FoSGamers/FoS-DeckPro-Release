[00:01:24] up in the buy

[00:01:45] then. Says it's
[00:01:49] active. Go to
[00:01:58] it. Add to show. It should be in
[00:02:02] there. Well, I just wanted to put them
[00:02:05] in for those that may want them.

[00:02:28] today. Uh we've updated the box, added
[00:02:30] some things, made some
[00:02:33] adjustments, and we're going to do it
[00:02:35] like that. We'll start at 30 seconds
[00:02:36] here for the day. Hopefully, you're
[00:02:38] starting your mornings off all right.

[00:02:48] do. Here we
[00:02:50] go. Let's see. Is it going to show
[00:02:52] everything for us? Maybe. Maybe
[00:02:58] not. Maybe. Maybe not. Looks like it's
[00:03:03] running. All right. Looks like it's

[00:03:06] there. All right, we have that. We got
[00:03:09] that running. Looks like things might be

[00:04:27] there. Ooh, a nature's rhythm. That's
[00:04:29] pretty
[00:04:30] good. Oh, everything's
[00:04:33] backwards. Oh my god. Why is the camera
[00:04:36] backwards? That's
[00:04:38] ridiculous. Hold
[00:04:46] on. That is silly. Well, there you go.
[00:04:49] Nature's
[00:04:51] rhythm, armament, air, dragon foil,
[00:04:54] rugged islands, and a soldier. That was
[00:04:56] really weird. you thought you were
[00:04:57] having a stroke at first. You know,
[00:04:59] sometimes, you know, it might have been
[00:05:01] what was going on. Who knows? I don't
[00:05:03] know. That was That's really weird. I
[00:05:04] did not notice that. Thank you for
[00:05:07] pointing that
[00:05:09] out. Moose was like, I was having a
[00:05:11] senior
[00:05:13] moment. I didn't know I was that old
[00:05:15] until just
[00:05:17] then. Didn't want to say
[00:05:20] anything. Now, I think I was the one
[00:05:22] having the senior moment there, not
[00:05:24] noticing what was going on.
[00:05:28] Sorry about that, Big. Didn't mean to uh
[00:05:31] confuse you so poorly like that. That
[00:05:32] was just not even good confusion. That
[00:05:33] was just a crazy one. Right along with
[00:05:35] it. You went right along with it. I
[00:05:37] know. That's what I should like. Dude,
[00:05:38] you you need to sleep a little more.
[00:05:41] That's what That's what I should have
[00:05:42] done. My wife put her contacts in. Oh,
[00:05:45] not bad though with the nature's rhythm.
[00:05:48] All right, my friend. So, you have that
[00:05:51] there and you are coming in and you get
[00:05:54] yourself when you're wandering around,
[00:05:56] you've been in here for a bit. So, basic
[00:05:58] weapons don't matter so much for you,
[00:06:00] but what they do help with is your uh
[00:06:02] your ability to do things in the
[00:06:04] wasteland.
[00:06:08] Question. Yes. What's the question? My
[00:06:11] my car I got you last night that I can't
[00:06:13] pronounce. Yeah.
[00:06:15] You uh you can put it in whatever deck
[00:06:17] you want to put it in stuff.
[00:06:19] Steph pulled out a Ugan I have storms
[00:06:22] from a play booster yesterday.
[00:06:28] Well, I mean the box was pretty good
[00:06:30] that we got it was had an Albth in
[00:06:31] there. I know. And what else was it? The
[00:06:34] dragons. Dragons. Uh Draco Draco
[00:06:40] Genesis got so that wasn't too bad. All
[00:06:43] right, we'll run another one. And you
[00:06:45] got yourself when you're wandering
[00:06:46] around. Big BK, you're going towards the
[00:06:50] mountain. All
[00:06:51] right, we decided they they uh those
[00:06:54] people told you about a cave. Now, you
[00:06:57] need some friends we'd think to go along
[00:06:59] with you if you'd
[00:07:02] like. Are you [ __ ] me, Big
[00:07:05] B? Like for yourself?
[00:07:13] See? Well, you know
[00:07:17] what? Oh my god. I hate when that
[00:07:20] happens. Like it just goes bad against
[00:07:22] you. I'm sorry about that. That stinks.
[00:07:25] I've been there before. Our our
[00:07:28] collector box was junk. Well, for you
[00:07:31] though, right now, I need to decide.
[00:07:33] There's a caravan. You wandered away
[00:07:35] from them and you find while you're
[00:07:39] wandering one of our uh our boxes here.
[00:07:42] Why is it not going? A buried
[00:07:44] toolbox with some
[00:07:47] weapons. We only get a pistol and a
[00:07:50] sword is all that's found found in
[00:07:52] there. But my
[00:07:55] friend Moose sells
[00:07:58] PNW. Got a darker play booster. Also
[00:08:02] there's there are the collectors.
[00:08:03] There's plays. There's collectors.
[00:08:04] There's all kinds of things there. Going
[00:08:06] to put two of these over here off to the
[00:08:07] side.
[00:08:10] We did have some. And then you got this,
[00:08:12] my friend. I open a case of collectors.
[00:08:14] I didn't even get a single special guest
[00:08:16] or anything. Well, no. Really? Out of an
[00:08:18] entire case like for yourself? Hey,
[00:08:20] pumpkin. How's it going?
[00:08:22] I do rise early. Yes, I am up
[00:08:26] early. Yeah, sweet set. But you don't
[00:08:28] get to know. Hey, well, did you get a
[00:08:30] chance at least to pull stuff out for
[00:08:31] other people? Cuz at least I was lucky
[00:08:32] enough to do
[00:08:34] that. So, you're hanging out there, Big
[00:08:36] B. And our new friend Moose, if you want
[00:08:38] to come in, you get your uh you're going
[00:08:40] to get this. We'll open this up for
[00:08:44] you and we will uh see what you get
[00:08:48] while you're wandering around there. All
[00:08:50] right, moose cells. All right. Wait, you
[00:08:54] want to go? You want something lower in
[00:08:56] here is what you're saying? Want one of
[00:08:58] these? Like these is what you're telling
[00:09:01] me?
[00:09:06] I don't know if that's what Yes. All
[00:09:08] right. I'll take that one right there.
[00:09:09] That was the lower one. I'll put that
[00:09:11] back on top. Here you go. Good luck, my
[00:09:14] friend. You're very welcome, Moose. We
[00:09:16] can do
[00:09:19] that. Hey, we miss you, too. Hey, we're
[00:09:22] going to be out that way in a little
[00:09:23] while. I was talking to Frank. All
[00:09:25] right, Harry. Good luck, my friend, with
[00:09:26] this tar here. Dragon storm play booster
[00:09:29] pack. You get a delta blood flies, salty
[00:09:31] devote, ice ridge serpent, salt road
[00:09:34] pack beast, wild ride, kinry, nurturer,
[00:09:38] aggressive negotiations, or nice rebuff,
[00:09:42] teeming dragon storm, defibrillating
[00:09:44] current, sadi, regent of meer. Oh, nice
[00:09:49] one here, my friend. A moose. You got
[00:09:51] fan keepers familiar in the uh foil in
[00:09:54] the showcase. Um, playing card, light
[00:09:57] foot technique and a foil swift water
[00:09:59] cliffs and a spirit
[00:10:05] Den. Yeah, I know it has been. We
[00:10:07] haven't been We've been so busy doing
[00:10:09] everything. We have with the boat here.
[00:10:10] Like we've been like I haven't I pretty
[00:10:12] much I able to hang out here, do a
[00:10:14] little bit of this, and then I'm working
[00:10:15] on the boat.
[00:10:17] Good morning. Hey, good morning, buddy.
[00:10:19] How's it going? Uh, good. All right. Let
[00:10:22] me get you with your name on
[00:10:25] these. And Moose, you uh you're new to
[00:10:28] the adventure, Moose. Unless you've
[00:10:30] changed your name. I'm pretty sure you
[00:10:32] are. Moose
[00:10:36] cells
[00:10:39] PNW. All right, I'm going to put you in
[00:10:41] a top loader for some of these ones
[00:10:43] because I like the uh I like your uh
[00:10:46] clan card
[00:10:47] there. Get that protected. And then you
[00:10:51] yourself are new. You're just wandering
[00:10:54] around. Yeah, you are. You are you want
[00:10:56] to wander near our buddy that was near
[00:10:58] the caravan? Were you are you a new
[00:11:00] person that happens to pop out of the
[00:11:01] caravan when you're the moose is on the
[00:11:03] loose? Well, uh just so you're aware,
[00:11:06] you're going to be fighting a moose
[00:11:10] uh
[00:11:11] dragon uh combination here. All right.
[00:11:16] because the the dragon that was uh let
[00:11:19] loose after the uh collider experiment
[00:11:23] went
[00:11:24] wrong became emerging from another world
[00:11:27] to a moose that happened to be in the
[00:11:28] area and it's Molor the moose dragon. My
[00:11:32] my family were ridiculous coming up and
[00:11:33] insane things. So, but you, my
[00:11:37] friend, you're wandering and you get a
[00:11:39] when you start out, you get yourself a
[00:11:43] pistol and you have yourself a knife
[00:11:45] when you start wandering around in the
[00:11:48] adventure. Now, you are in around the
[00:11:51] caravan. You you happen to see a buddy
[00:11:52] big BK popped out and like, "Oh, hey,
[00:11:55] see a new
[00:11:58] person." So, you got your pistol and
[00:12:00] your knife. are wandering around. But
[00:12:02] when you're wandering there, one of the
[00:12:04] things you see is
[00:12:06] uh that you saw Big BK wander over to
[00:12:09] where that um box was there. Now, Big
[00:12:14] didn't say he was picking anything up.
[00:12:15] I'm guessing he's going to leave it over
[00:12:16] there.
[00:12:17] So, there was a pistol and a sword
[00:12:21] hanging out in that box there. You want
[00:12:24] to pick those up because you are allowed
[00:12:25] to dual wield pistols and you cannot
[00:12:27] duel with swords, but you can dual wield
[00:12:28] pistols if you'd like.
[00:12:34] Yeah, they are demanding. Yes, they are.
[00:12:36] But they're very worth
[00:12:38] it. You can have them. All right.
[00:12:40] Sweetness. Well, sometimes you can take
[00:12:42] them and use them for like upgrading
[00:12:43] things. You know what I mean? That's why
[00:12:44] people sometimes take stuff. I mean, I
[00:12:46] know people that take every piece of
[00:12:47] junk in every game they play. Twin gats.
[00:12:50] Yes, you can put twin gats on. All
[00:12:52] right. So, you got two of those. The
[00:12:54] moose has two ties of pistols, which
[00:12:56] means you now have 18 rounds instead of
[00:12:58] nine.
[00:13:00] two times of
[00:13:01] pistols with 18 rounds. Now, that gives
[00:13:04] you a uh plus4 on your roll instead of a
[00:13:07] plus two when it comes to
[00:13:09] uh having an attack. And then same for
[00:13:12] the sword, it is a plus five to give you
[00:13:15] extra like say like if it's a 17 to hit,
[00:13:18] you have to roll a 12. That's how it
[00:13:21] goes. That makes sense there. Aha.
[00:13:25] Yes. We keep going.
[00:13:29] Yes, you usually do, but you're pretty
[00:13:31] advanced these days. Yes, that is true.
[00:13:32] Now, remember, just going to let you
[00:13:34] know there are times that may cause
[00:13:37] people to kind of not reset fully, but
[00:13:40] maybe lose things, so they kind of need
[00:13:42] to helps uh keep the game
[00:13:45] going, but it won't take everything.
[00:13:47] It'll be more like a Yeah, maybe uh your
[00:13:49] armor is destroyed or something like
[00:13:50] that. You know what I mean? Because you
[00:13:53] had to fight off something and in the
[00:13:55] process your armor was ruined.
[00:13:57] We won't take everything from you. You
[00:13:59] know what I mean? But sometimes that
[00:14:01] happens, right? I mean, the world world
[00:14:03] your armor sometimes breaks down unless
[00:14:04] it's like a magical one. And we're not
[00:14:06] in a magical land there. This is the
[00:14:07] real world. All in safety. Exactly.
[00:14:11] Well, you know, I'm pretty sure you'd
[00:14:12] rather have your armor turned to dust
[00:14:14] than you, right? I mean, that's the
[00:14:16] point of it. Correct. That's what I
[00:14:18] thought at least. You know, I'm pretty
[00:14:21] sure you'd rather have the um the armor
[00:14:24] on you here turning to dust rather than
[00:14:27] you and your uh baby dragon,
[00:14:29] right? You Oh, you want to die a
[00:14:32] warrior's death. All right, if that's
[00:14:33] it, you can cook inside the armor. We
[00:14:35] can do that instead. It just all of a
[00:14:36] sudden it becomes an oven and there goes
[00:14:40] big. I
[00:14:44] know. Oh, you p pulled Ugan and
[00:14:46] Ellsworth. Nice. Yeah, we got an Ugan
[00:14:48] and Elfith. Also, my wife got a El Ugan
[00:14:52] and I pulled Elizabeth out. I've always
[00:14:54] wanted to do a uh an angel deck. I've
[00:14:55] been baiting on it now. I'm
[00:14:59] like, Frank's awesome, though. All
[00:15:02] right, so you guys got that. We're going
[00:15:03] to run another adventure one here if you
[00:15:05] guys want to do. You know what I'll do?
[00:15:07] Why not? I'll run one of the giveaways,
[00:15:08] just the basic ones. That way you guys
[00:15:10] can get some of the We do these the
[00:15:11] altars. My families make they make
[00:15:13] altars here. That's not the altar. They
[00:15:16] uh my wife made that one. Kyle, if
[00:15:18] anybody knows what uh movie that might
[00:15:20] be from. Um my son did that one. That
[00:15:22] was kind of funny. He said wanted
[00:15:24] Griffin and made it into a wanted. Um
[00:15:26] that's the rare that's in them. And but
[00:15:28] anyways, there's 10 cards in here. You
[00:15:30] guys pick one and one of them could be a
[00:15:31] rare that's in here, the rare, whatever
[00:15:33] random rare that we put in. Or it could
[00:15:34] be any of these
[00:15:35] here. That's what we like to do for some
[00:15:38] uh from our giveaways there. Have some
[00:15:39] fun. If you guys want to buy any of the
[00:15:42] altars and things like that, let me
[00:15:43] know. I can put them out there. I mean,
[00:15:45] my wife spent a bit of time making
[00:15:47] Wilson here, so maybe he is like
[00:15:50] something that you'd
[00:15:53] like. Yes, he is. Don't tell
[00:15:58] him. About to give up on those aether
[00:16:02] drift. All right, let's go. Let's get
[00:16:05] you something nice from Zift Brewster.
[00:16:09] All right, you're scavenging around now.
[00:16:11] You know where you're going. Are you
[00:16:13] going to start scavenging and heading

[00:24:06] this dude. He's like, "You know what?
[00:24:06] That might not a bad idea wander around
[00:24:08] with him." So you go over, you see that

[00:25:41] those. And that's what you guys find in
[00:25:47] there. Yes. Uh he does, but it doesn't
[00:25:50] it didn't help
[00:25:54] him. Yes. Big BK has some luck, but it
[00:25:57] didn't really help him. So, you guys got
[00:25:59] those. We're going to add that to your
[00:26:00] inventory. So, tie you in there to the
[00:26:04] characters so you can continue on with
[00:26:07] the rest of

[00:30:00] regular and Japanese borderless. All
[00:30:02] right, let me put your Clarion and your
[00:30:04] Zargo in a top loader, my friend. And
[00:30:09] now the thing with you, Moose, is you
[00:30:12] now uh you get this thing. It's called
[00:30:15] uh loyalty for some by an NPC. You
[00:30:18] become a friend. So much so with them
[00:30:22] that they are now loyal to you. All
[00:30:26] right. So, let's get you your stuff over
[00:30:28] here,
[00:30:30] Moose. Oh, uh, going to hide over here
[00:30:34] from our
[00:30:39] friends. Mom, I don't know where mom is
[00:30:42] right now.
[00:30:48] I was going to tell her, but I don't
[00:30:49] know where she is. Outside. Ah, outside.
[00:30:52] Okay. So, get her. No, that's fine. So,
[00:30:55] this is what you have. You're going
[00:30:57] here. I'm going to give you an
[00:30:59] option. You can uh befriend the ghoul
[00:31:02] trader in the
[00:31:04] village or you can befriend some of the
[00:31:07] villagers in general. It's up to you.
[00:31:11] Hey, hate whatnot. Got to rip them all.
[00:31:14] some of the villagers in general. It's
[00:31:16] up to you. Hey, hate whatnot. Got to rip
[00:31:20] them
[00:31:24] all. Yes, you do have your guns. You
[00:31:26] have your two guns. That is
[00:31:29] correct. The traitor. All right. So,
[00:31:32] this uh trader is now like your your
[00:31:34] friend here. They're around the ghoul
[00:31:36] village. He's like, "Hey there, buddy."
[00:31:39] He's like, "I remember you. You were uh
[00:31:41] you've been around here before." and
[00:31:42] you're like, "Yeah, that was
[00:31:44] me." Going with it cuz, "Yeah, you uh
[00:31:47] you were one of the ones that helped us
[00:31:48] get rid of all the
[00:31:49] rats." And you look at him and you look
[00:31:51] you look at him. What do you say? You
[00:31:52] say, "Are you going to answer with a yes
[00:31:54] and just take it take that?" Or you
[00:31:56] going to you going to be honest like no
[00:31:57] that wasn't me. What rats you talking
[00:31:59] about? You know what? How are you going
[00:32:00] to go? Or you just going to kind of just
[00:32:01] play with it? Be like, "Yeah, yeah, we
[00:32:03] did
[00:32:06] that. Where's Big BK here? We got a
[00:32:09] couple of friends now. Not our big
[00:32:11] hitting friends
[00:32:12] yet. I like it wasn't me. Ah, see. Oh,
[00:32:15] he goes. You go. It wasn't me. That
[00:32:17] wasn't me. He said I was looking at you.
[00:32:19] He goes, "Oh, come closer. Come a little
[00:32:21] closer." Ah. Oh my. You look very
[00:32:22] similar. Must have been like the other
[00:32:23] guy. Well, you know what? We had some
[00:32:25] rat problems around, but now uh our rat
[00:32:28] problems are are gone. I appreciate
[00:32:30] that. You know what? The honesty, we
[00:32:32] don't have too many honest people in
[00:32:33] this wasteland here. the few of them in
[00:32:35] the village. Most of the people in the
[00:32:37] village are good honest people here, but
[00:32:38] not not too many outside. So, you now

[00:35:16] well for you. I think you had a good
[00:35:17] one. We're just uh we're doing some pack
[00:35:20] openings and playing some adventure game
[00:35:21] like we do normally. Cage is one of our
[00:35:24] buddies. Comes in and hangs out
[00:35:26] regularly. Uh
[00:35:27] oh. This is our buddy Caged. They come
[00:35:30] out and they come and hang out regularly
[00:35:32] with everyone. Colin, I'm going to put
[00:35:34] your name down.
[00:35:37] on that. We got you in here to play with
[00:35:40] us. That doesn't sound right. Oh no,
[00:35:42] that doesn't sound good. I had to
[00:35:43] rearrange that one. Come in here and
[00:35:45] play and hang out. Play some
[00:35:47] games. Now Cage is there. Big BK, you
[00:35:51] got more
[00:35:53] friends. All right,
[00:35:56] Colin, you you are wandering and you're
[00:35:58] in that same area, but you're you go and
[00:36:00] look in one of those
[00:36:02] buildings. You know, you go wander and
[00:36:04] you see uh you weren't one of those
[00:36:05] burnt out buildings. You go look in
[00:36:07] there with your pistol and your knife.
[00:36:09] And when you're in
[00:36:10] there, you happen to see this buried
[00:36:14] little toolbox in the ground. Now, do
[00:36:16] you want high or low for your
[00:36:19] roll? What do you
[00:36:21] choose? What do you choose? What is your
[00:36:26] name? It is a d20.
[00:36:33] low it
[00:36:35] is. Oh no, it was not low. It was 14.
[00:36:43] So h sometimes it is the four
[00:36:49] 4d20s. Uh the
[00:36:53] you open the box, but what happens is
[00:36:57] inside you do find some weapons. you
[00:37:00] find yourself another
[00:37:02] pistol and a sword. Those are the only
[00:37:05] two things that you find in
[00:37:07] there. Now, you can take those, add them
[00:37:10] to your character. Now, the pistol, you
[00:37:11] can dual wield them. And the sword
[00:37:13] you're allowed, it gives you a plus five
[00:37:15] when you're swinging. So, like say 17 to
[00:37:16] hit. You'll only have to hit with
[00:37:20] 12. I'm going to take the sword. All
[00:37:22] right. Nice. Now, you only have seven
[00:37:24] items you can carry. You're good right
[00:37:25] now, obviously. But going to take the
[00:37:27] sword and the pistol.
[00:37:29] So, you're going to be two times the
[00:37:30] pistols
[00:37:31] also. And we're going to have a
[00:37:33] sword for you, my
[00:37:38] friend. All
[00:37:41] right. We'll hang out. Play some
[00:37:43] adventure in here for those that want
[00:37:44] to. Now, our buddy
[00:37:45] Big, he's hanging out with us. He was
[00:37:48] here before. I don't know what happened
[00:37:49] to him. I think Big um Big might have
[00:37:52] gotten sleepy.
[00:37:55] He stays up overnight. So sometimes he
[00:37:57] gets sleepy when we're trying to get
[00:37:58] things together here. So wait, got to
[00:38:00] wait for some of the friends to come in
[00:38:01] because he wants to go and uh he's been
[00:38:03] waiting for a while because the uh Molor
[00:38:08] has been un unleashed and he wants to go
[00:38:10] and fight it, but he knows he will not
[00:38:12] be able to win. But he hasn't gone and
[00:38:14] talked to anybody about any of the other
[00:38:15] locations, which I've been I've been
[00:38:17] poking at for a little while now.
[00:38:24] All
[00:38:24] righty. So, we'll keep running our
[00:38:28] adventuring. Yeah. See what we're going
[00:38:29] to do and good luck with everybody and
[00:38:32] you guys can continue on. Anybody uh
[00:38:35] what do you guys want to do in the
[00:38:36] wasteland here. Now, I know some people
[00:38:38] come in. It's like this open world. You
[00:38:40] guys get to decide. I mean, the m the
[00:38:42] plan is the story where we're going to
[00:38:44] is, you know, there was a mountain.
[00:38:46] There was a guys that had been playing
[00:38:48] earlier and you saw a mountain that it
[00:38:50] was all of a sudden a rumble. When that
[00:38:52] rumble occurred, all those weird code
[00:38:54] discs that you've been collecting around
[00:38:55] started to like make noises. Some of
[00:38:57] them glowed. It was just
[00:38:59] weird. All that crumble, I mean, it
[00:39:01] started to open up a little bit and we
[00:39:04] like you didn't know what was going on.
[00:39:07] And then started going investigating,
[00:39:09] found out there was a old vault that had
[00:39:13] been there. found where the road was
[00:39:16] after you talked to caravans and you
[00:39:18] know that the dragon is in there that
[00:39:20] was
[00:39:21] found. So that's where we're kind of at.
[00:39:24] You can always go hang out if you want
[00:39:27] in any of the places. We have a couple
[00:39:29] places we've been a small town. There
[00:39:31] was a city that people were in earlier
[00:39:33] on. You guys left the city before. I
[00:39:36] don't know. So it's always up to you
[00:39:37] where you going and what you're doing.
[00:39:42] And that's what uh kind of we do a
[00:39:44] little D and D game while we hang
[00:39:47] out. Am I fully charged or something? Is
[00:39:49] that No, it just doesn't want to charge
[00:39:51] it
[00:39:53] today. There we go. All
[00:39:59] right. You guys can always band
[00:40:01] together. Yes, you can definitely band
[00:40:04] together to do things. I was thinking I
[00:40:05] was waiting on
[00:40:07] that question.
[00:40:17] side quest on the vessel now. Second,
[00:40:20] the village is still needing some
[00:40:22] environment control. I am in the boat
[00:40:24] now. Yes, we are in the boat right now.
[00:40:26] We are in the boat. Correct. We are
[00:40:28] hanging out in the boat and
[00:40:31] um we are we are on it. We're from all
[00:40:34] we are now. Uh we're in Florida at the
[00:40:36] moment. We put on a solar arch. We're
[00:40:38] going to heading up north a little bit
[00:40:39] to get some um uh solar and stuff to put
[00:40:42] in. And then yeah, it's the motor is uh
[00:40:44] the generator running because we don't
[00:40:46] have the solar on
[00:40:47] yet. Got to get that going. See scouts
[00:40:53] forever. I like it.
[00:40:56] Oh. Any Yes, the villagers do need some
[00:41:00] varmint control. That is correct. So you
[00:41:02] guys can go together. They talked about
[00:41:04] this place. They're like, I don't know
[00:41:05] where this thing is. We we had some
[00:41:07] issues. We went by it. I need some
[00:41:10] assistance
[00:41:11] here cuz there was this cave and there
[00:41:13] were these weird things that came out of
[00:41:15] it. They don't know what the hell was
[00:41:16] going on. They all ran away, but they
[00:41:18] left some stuff there. They described it
[00:41:20] to you. Guys can come together and go
[00:41:23] after it. It's up to
[00:41:27] you. You happen to be a good shot. All
[00:41:30] right. Going to go help him out, Colin
[00:41:31] says. All right. I like it. Going to go
[00:41:34] assist. So you talk to the villagers,
[00:41:38] they they let you know, you know, you're
[00:41:40] like, "All right, cool." They let you
[00:41:41] know where that that area is. You're
[00:41:43] like, "Yeah, we talked to them
[00:41:44] specifically. I don't know where it is.
[00:41:45] There's a caravan." So you go walking
[00:41:47] back out. You find that caravan. They
[00:41:49] were just hanging out. They haven't been
[00:41:50] moving much. They're very slow. And they
[00:41:52] say there's a dragon cave of dragons
[00:41:54] somewhere. They think it was dragons.
[00:41:57] They're really small. It was weird. They
[00:41:59] ran.
[00:42:01] So you guys head out and go
[00:42:06] over wandering. You
[00:42:09] see the road to the cave there, but off
[00:42:13] to the side is the other tiny little
[00:42:15] road that gives you the small one. And
[00:42:16] all of a sudden out of there, you see
[00:42:17] this going on a scene in front of you.
[00:42:19] Oh, getting some singles. I like it, my
[00:42:24] friend. We have over a thousand singles
[00:42:26] in the buy now. I actually have to go
[00:42:28] through and do some uh updates and add
[00:42:30] new ones. I haven't done
[00:42:32] that. So, you got to decide what you
[00:42:35] going to do. Now, there's all kinds of
[00:42:37] stuff
[00:42:39] there. You guys go and attack. You going
[00:42:43] to What are you going to try to feed
[00:42:44] them? You going to go try to pet them?
[00:42:46] You going to run in just screaming and
[00:42:48] hopefully scare them off? I mean, it's
[00:42:50] up to you guys. Now, you both have
[00:42:52] swords, knives, and pistols to use.
[00:42:57] Big B does have some luck. He does. Is
[00:43:00] Big Is Big BK here? This is our buddy
[00:43:03] Big BK. He was a lucky person that found
[00:43:06] a baby dragon at one point. And he has a
[00:43:09] baby lightning dragon that hangs out
[00:43:10] with him on his shoulder. Now, we do
[00:43:14] have another friend,
[00:43:16] Mystic. They were lucky enough to
[00:43:21] uh find a dragon for the cave. A dragon
[00:43:24] cave. a cave filled with dragon eggs
[00:43:26] earlier and they got a dragon egg in
[00:43:28] their pocket. He is
[00:43:32] AFK. I know he does have some luck. So,
[00:43:34] is I guess maybe it's just the two of
[00:43:36] you. Just the two of you uh wandering
[00:43:39] around
[00:43:42] here. Looks like the two of you
[00:43:44] wandering through
[00:43:45] town. Oh, Cage is hanging out. All
[00:43:48] right, Cage. Are you going to go and
[00:43:49] hang out with him, too, and try? We got
[00:43:51] our buddy Cage. He's got um What is K
[00:43:54] Chev? I got to get your stuff
[00:44:02] here. Oh. Oh, that's too
[00:44:07] far. Where is your name? There's so many
[00:44:10] people. I have to organize this better.
[00:44:21] Where are
[00:44:30] you? All right, there you
[00:44:35] go. Gaga, you got a plasma. I don't know
[00:44:39] why I couldn't find you in here.
[00:44:42] You have a plasma, two plasma rifles,
[00:44:45] two
[00:44:47] pistols, and four knives. You have a
[00:44:50] critical, 50 pogs, two health packs that
[00:44:53] are 10 plus, and a rata away, and you're
[00:44:55] at 93
[00:44:57] health. That's what you are at
[00:44:59] caged. All right. So, we got another
[00:45:06] friend. Oh, you going to try Laura?
[00:45:11] Suzie. So, that's going to be the name.
[00:45:14] All right, we can dab
[00:45:17] that. He has any treats to spare? Oh,
[00:45:20] not a bad idea. You go and you uh you
[00:45:24] talk with before you head over
[00:45:25] there, you talk with the trader and you
[00:45:28] say, "Hey, uh Sosie, you got any
[00:45:29] treats?" And he's like, "You know what?
[00:45:30] We actually do have gator dillow bites.
[00:45:33] You want some of those? That might help.
[00:45:36] You think?" and take some of those gator
[00:45:38] dillo
[00:45:40] bites. Temperament. They didn't really
[00:45:42] they they came charging out. They ran
[00:45:44] away. They didn't really know what
[00:45:45] happened yet. They ran away. They were
[00:45:46] scared. They didn't put any effort into
[00:45:48] it when they were there. They just
[00:45:50] flee. They
[00:45:54] ran. All right, Moose. You're going to
[00:45:56] get some um gator dillow
[00:46:00] bites. Now, the gator dillo, you were
[00:46:03] lucky. That means that somebody had
[00:46:04] killed one at some point for you. Where
[00:46:07] are
[00:46:08] they? These are gator dillos. They're
[00:46:11] rough. They're rough creatures. You're
[00:46:12] going to have a hard time fighting those
[00:46:13] ones if you bump into
[00:46:15] them. There you
[00:46:19] go.
[00:46:23] So, they didn't have a big temperament.
[00:46:25] They didn't know. They just kind of get
[00:46:26] they, you know, they're just there. They
[00:46:28] came and they ran because they didn't
[00:46:29] know what was going on. So, you
[00:46:37] Go yourselves over there. Three. Are you
[00:46:42] going Bowser kid with a
[00:46:46] gator? No bueno with that armor. No, you
[00:46:49] don't have any good armor either. Yeah.
[00:46:51] Yeah, I
[00:46:53] know. So, uh, ready. Ready. All right.
[00:46:55] So, you guys are going to head on out.
[00:46:56] All right. We can head over there.
[00:46:58] You're good to go. Is, uh, is Cage
[00:47:01] going?
[00:47:03] Just wondering. I was just making sure
[00:47:04] who was uh who was on the the side quest
[00:47:09] altogether. You're following in the
[00:47:11] back. All right. So, the two of them
[00:47:13] wander away and like cages in the
[00:47:14] background like I don't know what's
[00:47:15] going on here, but I'll
[00:47:17] go. All right. So, you hang back. Moo
[00:47:21] says he's going to go in
[00:47:23] first. Goes and wanders in. Moo says
[00:47:26] he's going to go over there first. They
[00:47:27] end up finding you end up wandering and
[00:47:29] you find the cave. You wander over and
[00:47:31] hold on. Let me see if I can make You're
[00:47:34] going to keep an eye on the six. I like
[00:47:36] it. Let me see if we can do
[00:47:53] this. All
[00:48:06] right, let's see what we can get
[00:48:11] here for an image. Let's see what we get
[00:48:13] here for an image. Mr.
[00:48:15] Burns, everybody's staying in the
[00:48:17] background. You keeping an eye on the
[00:48:18] six. I like it. You're all hanging out
[00:48:20] there, making sure everybody's good.
[00:48:21] We're not going to have any problems.
[00:48:22] All right, we're all staying safe. And
[00:48:25] uh in the background you
[00:48:31] have not those
[00:48:54] That was not what I wanted. I don't like
[00:49:05] that. We're going to go with a different
[00:49:07] one. That one did not. Aha. There we go.
[00:49:15] So there we
[00:49:17] are where he hands
[00:49:20] you these things
[00:49:23] here that you put in your
[00:49:35] pocket. Okay.
[00:49:38] And let's get I just had to put it in
[00:49:41] download the image.
[00:49:43] There we
[00:49:45] go. These are the gator dillo
[00:49:48] bites. They were
[00:49:50] uh pretty much anytime somebody comes
[00:49:53] with some gator dillo meat, they use it
[00:49:55] to make some pet food and who knows who
[00:49:58] they say it's pet food. They who knows
[00:50:00] they're they're ghouls and they're off
[00:50:01] in the middle of nowhere. They might
[00:50:02] even eat it themselves, you
[00:50:04] know. All right, so here's your gator
[00:50:07] dillo bites.
[00:50:09] Let's put those in our items so I can
[00:50:11] find those
[00:50:13] easier. Ah, gator dillo
[00:50:21] bites there. So, you find the gator
[00:50:24] dillow
[00:50:25] bites, go
[00:50:27] over. Mouthwatering. And he hands it to
[00:50:30] uh he hands them
[00:50:32] over to some of
[00:50:35] those flying little
[00:50:40] uh small dragons that were there. Now, a
[00:50:42] handful of those
[00:50:44] dragons do come
[00:50:49] forward. Let's see if I can get the the
[00:50:51] image
[00:50:52] here. They're just kind of playing with
[00:50:54] each other and fighting. You don't
[00:50:55] really understand everything going on.
[00:50:58] Like, doesn't look like it's much of a
[00:50:59] problem, so you're not too worried about
[00:51:02] it.
[00:51:04] So, let's do this.
[00:51:57] Okay, let's see at this
[00:52:00] desert. Let's see what we get here. You
[00:52:03] hang you hanging out
[00:52:05] there. Due to cuteness, you try and tame
[00:52:09] them. Thank you, RS Savage. I appreciate

[00:52:31] right, I don't know what I'm going to do
[00:52:32] here. And you're going to hand them the
[00:52:35] bites. And uh it looks
[00:52:40] like they're kind of going crazy, but
[00:52:43] they're not really attacking you.
[00:52:47] Dude's going flying all around. They
[00:52:49] haven't done anything yet. So, this is

[00:55:55] instead. Ha. So, you hand them to him.
[00:55:57] You're you're feeding them. Now, this is
[00:55:59] what we going to have to happen. You

[00:57:50] out. Vaughn, my friend, you got yourself
[00:57:53] a tar play booster and you're hanging
[00:57:55] out with us. Oh, we got that one was the
[00:57:58] top one. All right, so Van, you've been
[00:58:00] hanging out with us. I didn't ignore
[00:58:02] you. I was just trying to finish the one
[00:58:03] thing we were saying. So, do you want me
[00:58:05] to open this up for you or do you want
[00:58:06] me to close uh ship it? Crack it. I like
[00:58:08] it. We open it. We're going to see what
[00:58:10] you get. And Von's hanging out and
[00:58:12] you're going to you're going to see what
[00:58:13] you get
[00:58:15] here. Yes. It's always always uh always
[00:58:18] good to have extra salty devote ice
[00:58:22] ridge serpent salt road pack beast
[00:58:25] narat's rebuke kinry nurturer watcher of
[00:58:29] the wayside wingspan stride bone cararen
[00:58:33] butcher static snare aus sculptor yathan
[00:58:37] road watcher I actually don't see that
[00:58:39] version of it much revival of the
[00:58:42] ancestors nice rare in the borderless
[00:58:44] saga for you champion of Dohan in a
[00:58:48] foil, Dismal Backwater in a foil, and a
[00:58:51] spirit token. Now, you're hanging out
[00:58:54] and one of the things you notice when
[00:58:57] they're uh you're all kicking things
[00:58:58] around with those dragons in the area.
[00:59:00] They said they dropped some stuff and
[00:59:01] one of the things they did end up
[00:59:02] dropping, you go over and you look
[00:59:04] inside to see some stuff. Now, I need a
[00:59:09] high or low from you, my friend Bon, so
[00:59:13] we can see what happens in the uh with
[00:59:15] this
[00:59:18] He grabbed the treats and runs back. All
[00:59:20] right, high it is. All right,
[00:59:23] Von
[00:59:25] Bezer. All right, Von. Von Bzer, you
[00:59:28] asked for
[00:59:29] high. So, let's
[00:59:32] see. Oh, high it is. We like it.
[00:59:37] So, that means in that very toolbox, you
[00:59:40] do find some basic weapons. you find a
[00:59:42] sword, but you also find an assault
[00:59:46] rifle and a plasma rifle in there. Now,
[00:59:50] the assault rifle is a plus uh three on
[00:59:54] your attack. So, say something's 15,
[00:59:56] you'd only have to have uh 12, say uh
[00:59:59] you know, to to roll to attack. And then
[01:00:01] you have a two d6s whenever you roll for
[01:00:04] your damage. The plasma rifle is plus
[01:00:06] five for the attack and it gets
[01:00:09] [Music]
[01:00:11] um uh 2d6s also, but the difference is
[01:00:14] assault rifle has three shots that it
[01:00:16] can do where the uh plasma rifle only
[01:00:18] does one shot. And then you also have
[01:00:20] the sword, which is kind of like the
[01:00:22] plasma rifle plus five, but it doesn't
[01:00:23] have uh it's
[01:00:26] melee. So you can take two. You can take
[01:00:30] two. Now you can dual wield pistols.
[01:00:34] So, yeah, it's up to you. Sword, says
[01:00:37] Vaughn. All right, we'll go with a
[01:00:40] sword for our friend. I like
[01:00:43] it. Van's hanging out with a sword
[01:00:48] now. Sword it
[01:00:51] is. Now, you have a plistol, a knife,
[01:00:54] and then you start out with that. And
[01:00:55] you always start out with those. Then,
[01:00:56] you're going to get a sword because you
[01:00:59] like the sword and you like melee. Melee
[01:01:01] is fun.
[01:01:08] Uh, no, you don't get add any combat.
[01:01:10] You just get to pick one of the two of
[01:01:12] those out of that you can pick out is
[01:01:13] what I was saying out of the box. So,
[01:01:14] you either get the uh plasma rifle, the
[01:01:17] assault rifle, the sword, and I Oh, I
[01:01:20] think the pistol was in there, too. I
[01:01:21] can't remember. But pistol allows you to
[01:01:23] use two of them at a time. That's the
[01:01:24] only ones that you can use two at a
[01:01:25] time. That and knives until you get
[01:01:28] stronger or bigger and you've been
[01:01:29] hanging around for a while. You know
[01:01:30] what I mean?
[01:01:38] Ah, so Moose sent you for the
[01:01:40] treats. And he goes, "Oh, really? Moose
[01:01:43] sent you." Oh. Oh, all
[01:01:46] right. They're your buddy. He goes, "Uh,
[01:01:49] I like that, Moose. It's a good person.
[01:01:52] They're honest. You know what? Here you
[01:01:54] go." And he gives you an extra
[01:01:57] 20. Sword is mighty like the pen. I like
[01:02:00] it.
[01:02:01] You get the sword. Two swords. All
[01:02:03] right, we could try
[01:02:05] that. All right. So, he's like, "Oh, I
[01:02:08] remember that." So, you got now 60 gator
[01:02:10] dillo
[01:02:13] bites. All righty, my
[01:02:15] friend. Now, you guys are you're hanging
[01:02:17] out by the uh that cave
[01:02:22] there. You're giving
[01:02:25] them some food.
[01:02:31] All right, you go and investigate what
[01:02:32] the dragons dropped. Now, you don't see
[01:02:35] the dragons dropping much,
[01:02:37] but you see these things, the code discs
[01:02:40] that were on the ground in the
[01:02:42] area, and you also find um not too much
[01:02:46] other than that, but in the
[01:02:48] back, see some weird things low. Do you
[01:02:51] want to try to make it further out in
[01:02:52] the back?
[01:02:59] Ah, dragons are friendly. Judge and
[01:03:01] Jerry's going to hang up. All right.
[01:03:04] Going to grab a disc and walk further. I
[01:03:06] like it. So, you guys are hanging around
[01:03:08] and take the disc and you wander further
[01:03:11] in. And then you
[01:03:14] see where is it?
[01:03:26] Uh, where did I put it? Hold on. Where'
[01:03:29] the image
[01:03:35] go? Swear that was right
[01:03:39] there. Ah, there it is. I thought I had
[01:03:43] that already.
[01:03:57] You see uh while you're wandering back
[01:03:59] there, you find these in the
[01:04:02] back. Now, when you find them, you you
[01:04:06] you notice this portal in the background
[01:04:09] that is slowly closing. Come on.
[01:04:19] All
[01:04:23] right, I hit
[01:04:28] download. There you go. And you find
[01:04:30] these in the background. These are
[01:04:32] intriguing. You're not really sure what
[01:04:34] they
[01:04:35] are. They're
[01:04:37] uh look like dragon eggs, though.
[01:04:46] Yeah,
[01:04:52] nice. No, there is no door, but the uh
[01:04:56] that that there does close up. You got
[01:04:59] to be careful as you're wandering
[01:05:02] in.
[01:05:07] Breakfast. Moose is liking it.
[01:05:09] Ah, guys are coming. All right, coming
[01:05:12] over. And you grab one of those. You
[01:05:13] grab each an egg. I like it.
[01:05:17] Colin gets an egg. And Moose is going to
[01:05:20] give get an egg cuz that's what he's
[01:05:21] doing. So you guys
[01:05:24] have dragon
[01:05:27] egg. And Moose also has a dragon egg cuz
[01:05:30] he's been feeding the other
[01:05:33] dragons. Now they're only they're not
[01:05:34] baby dragons. Those ones out there, they
[01:05:36] are fully grown. They're just
[01:05:38] small. They're just small. That's
[01:05:42] all. All right. So, let's put those in
[01:05:46] there so you can see
[01:05:50] them. Keep going. Some adventuring
[01:05:54] here. There you go. We got the dragon
[01:05:56] eggs. You grab those. You head back to
[01:05:58] our buddy. He's feeding them. You go,
[01:05:59] "Hey, look what I
[01:06:04] found." And
[01:06:09] No, the portal closes as you turn around
[01:06:11] and go back. It's not open anymore. You
[01:06:14] do not have the ability to go in there,
[01:06:16] but you do have some of those uh discs.
[01:06:17] Who knows what those will allow you to
[01:06:19] do. Now, you take those. You say you're
[01:06:22] going to be friend. You're trying to
[01:06:23] befriend them. So, our buddy
[01:06:25] uh Cage comes back with a bunch of the
[01:06:28] bites and he stands next to our friend
[01:06:31] there. You're hanging
[01:06:33] out. Oh, no. with those many dragons
[01:06:36] feeding
[01:06:46] them. All
[01:06:52] right. And calling and moose 10 of
[01:06:56] Meech unoperable door
[01:07:00] again. Von bezer. Where are we going?
[01:07:05] Yes, the door is not open. It doesn't
[01:07:07] The portal doesn't go. The portal
[01:07:09] closed. It closed before anybody could
[01:07:11] get to it. But one of the things that
[01:07:13] was noted was my right by it. There was
[01:07:16] a stack. There's a few of these things
[01:07:18] hanging around were glowing and acting
[01:07:20] weird. So, you pick those up. The code
[01:07:26] disc. I like it. We're going to pick
[01:07:28] those code discs up.
[01:07:32] That way you can uh figure out what that
[01:07:33] goes to. All right, you hand them out.
[01:07:35] You guys are
[01:07:37] feeding the mini
[01:07:40] dragons. There is no slot for the disc.
[01:07:43] No. So, if you watch a little bit of our
[01:07:45] shorts that we do, we uh the what has
[01:07:49] happened was the uh the
[01:07:51] wasteland had uh kind of was normal.
[01:07:54] Well, the world was normal and then a
[01:07:55] and then a an experiment went bad and a
[01:07:58] collider had something happened and
[01:08:00] opened some portals and weird stuff
[01:08:01] started happening and the wasteland
[01:08:02] occurred. Now we have our our dragon
[01:08:06] Bolorth that is in the primary location
[01:08:08] where the that started and now you have
[01:08:10] these portals are that have to do with
[01:08:12] the
[01:08:13] discs. Something happened and all these
[01:08:15] discs that were in all the vaults and
[01:08:17] different places became uh associated
[01:08:19] with something and that's why you see
[01:08:21] things open every now and again. Now
[01:08:24] those uh portals open, something closed.
[01:08:26] You got the dragons coming out. Maybe
[01:08:27] who knows what happens. It helps uh
[01:08:29] helps get things with releases of cards.
[01:08:31] We do different things and adding it
[01:08:33] in. Yeah, you don't want to offend the
[01:08:35] little guys. So you put the eggs away,
[01:08:36] hide them, put in
[01:08:41] pockets. You're handing them to them.
[01:08:44] Not really time sensitive. Nope. Nope.
[01:08:46] Not uh not too much on that because uh
[01:08:50] we just I just need more people uh I
[01:08:52] would say to go and attack or or you
[01:08:54] have a good amount of people now so
[01:08:55] maybe not. But you hand them some of the
[01:08:57] gator dillow bites too. I like
[01:09:00] it. Giving them gator dillow bites all
[01:09:02] of
[01:09:03] you. And uh now you guys are going to
[01:09:07] try to befriend these. Is that what
[01:09:08] you're all doing? So we're going to go
[01:09:10] high or low for what happens here.
[01:09:14] calling high or
[01:09:18] low. All right, we have high from Moose,
[01:09:21] low from Bon. All
[01:09:25] right, you want a pack dragon? We'll see
[01:09:27] what
[01:09:30] happens. All right. So, h high for
[01:09:35] Moose. Oh. All right. Well, we're going
[01:09:37] to go with three. We're going to go low
[01:09:39] for
[01:09:42] Vaughn. Oh.
[01:09:45] And then low for
[01:09:47] Colin.
[01:09:50] Okay. Now, um,
[01:09:54] caged. What about
[01:09:57] you? High or
[01:10:05] low? Oh. Oh my. That didn't go for any
[01:10:09] of you.
[01:10:13] Well, well, okay. Well, you're feeding
[01:10:17] them and it looks like they don't do
[01:10:19] anything. They don't like come to
[01:10:23] you. H you do. You have a you have a you
[01:10:26] about we'll say you have about three or
[01:10:28] four
[01:10:29] left. I don't know, man. That was a bad
[01:10:34] bounce. Everybody have a few left and I
[01:10:36] try maybe one more time and see what
[01:10:37] happens.
[01:10:42] Second attempt. I like it. Second
[01:10:44] attempt. What are you going with? High

[01:13:00] Miniature like a rat sized. Doesn't
[01:13:03] really do anything.
[01:13:05] Now,
[01:13:07] Vaughn says, "Choose which
[01:13:10] uh now you can choose your uh element
[01:13:12] that it has because they're all
[01:13:13] different

[01:14:28] Mini mini lightning
[01:14:32] dragon. Dark matter. Oh, I don't know

[01:33:24] these, put them in the sleeves, protect
[01:33:26] your rare and your other ones there,
[01:33:28] Colin.
[01:33:30] Now you guys decide. You're going to you
[01:33:32] talk to
[01:33:35] them. The cat is crazy looking. Yes, I
[01:33:38] will agree
[01:33:39] there. Colin, I got your name written
[01:33:41] down already. You are right here, my
[01:33:45] friend.
[01:33:47] Colin. All right, Colin. Put you in with
[01:33:49] your other one.
[01:33:51] Now you guys are wandering
[01:33:54] back over to
[01:33:58] a location
[01:34:02] there. But on your way back, you end up
[01:34:04] all bumping into a little bit of a
[01:34:06] sandstorm starts. A bunch of raiders
[01:34:09] come
[01:34:10] out. Sandstorm's coming towards you. You
[01:34:12] guys try to hide, but you have to
[01:34:15] decide. Are you going to try to hide
[01:34:16] from the sandstorm or you going to
[01:34:17] attack?
[01:34:19] It's a little bit of an encounter, not
[01:34:21] major one. They're gonna This is like a
[01:34:22] hit and run. They They run through the
[01:34:27] sandstorm. You
[01:34:29] decide. What will you
[01:34:34] do? How many raiders? You can't tell
[01:34:38] because they are blending in with the
[01:34:39] sandstorm. They running on they're
[01:34:41] running through it. The moment you see
[01:34:42] like three to five
[01:34:46] maybe. That's part of the problem. It's
[01:34:48] a sandstorm. You can't see everything.
[01:34:50] Well, you say attack
[01:34:53] them. Colin's up for an attack. I like
[01:35:00] it. You got some gats. All right, this
[01:35:03] is a good
[01:35:04] one. And you got a tar dragon. Here we

[01:35:16] Bon Brener, Bon Beaser will hang out in
[01:35:18] the back with some defense for you guys
[01:35:20] protecting. Looks like we have Caged
[01:35:23] and, um, maybe Colin to
[01:35:26] attack. Here we go. Good luck. Let's see
[01:35:29] what you get here out of this tar.

[01:36:11] and then I don't see them right in front
[01:36:13] because of the uh auto box thing that's
[01:36:16] running. So, if that ran and you bought
[01:36:18] at the same time, it might not have just

[01:37:45] I don't know how big these are anymore,
[01:37:46] but this was all always a nice hit
[01:37:48] before. How's a meat hook massacre, too?
[01:37:51] Nice mythic for you to start in a
[01:37:54] foil. Demolisher spawn for your next
[01:37:58] rare. Why is that not staying up there?
[01:37:59] Oh, that's in front. That's why. And
[01:38:01] that's an extended art. Demolisher

[01:38:15] art and the insect token.
[01:38:21] Nice delay. You're going to flank. Delay
[01:38:25] that until we cease fire. Oh, you're
[01:38:27] going to start shooting right away and
[01:38:28] you're going to go around to kind of try
[01:38:29] to flank. Colin's going around the
[01:38:34] back. All right. You're going to delay
[01:38:36] the firing and you're going to you're
[01:38:37] going to lay back for a second while
[01:38:38] Colin sneaks around.
[01:38:48] They go further than you. All right. I
[01:38:50] like it.
[01:38:54] So, all right. You guys are all going
[01:38:55] after them. So, there's a couple hanging
[01:38:57] out going around trying to see what
[01:38:59] happens. I'm going to put your meat hook
[01:39:01] and your enduring in a top loader here.
[01:39:04] Nice pick up on those, our friend John.
[01:39:07] We like those collector boosters.
[01:39:10] Judge and
[01:39:13] jury, which are his pistols, are present
[01:39:17] and accounted
[01:39:19] for. Cage likes the idea of flanking. He
[01:39:23] heads around on the other
[01:39:25] side. All right, John, let me write you
[01:39:33] down.
[01:39:35] Spir Spirig, sorry about that. I didn't
[01:39:38] see that come in. And there you go. I
[01:39:40] like it. Spear dig. There you go. Nice
[01:39:44] pickup. You're going on the sides of the
[01:39:46] flank. All right. I like it. So nicely
[01:39:49] you guys are sneaking around. A
[01:39:51] sneakers. You sneaky
[01:39:53] sneaky sneaky sneaky. And you sneaking
[01:39:57] around to
[01:40:00] attack those sandstorm raiders. All
[01:40:03] right. Now you all go attack. Got your
[01:40:05] sword and Zilla with you. Now Zilla
[01:40:06] doesn't really do much. He's a miniature
[01:40:08] dragon. He's not really going to help
[01:40:09] too much. He, you know, they don't
[01:40:10] really do too much. They're just more of
[01:40:12] a a a pet that might, who knows, in the
[01:40:14] future
[01:40:17] might
[01:40:23] now grabs a second knife, one for each
[01:40:26] hand.
[01:40:29] All right. So, you going to attack? All
[01:40:31] right. I like it. You guys are going
[01:40:32] into attack now.
[01:40:35] You have your dual pistols you're going
[01:40:38] to attack with. So you get plus four.
[01:40:41] Now these things needed a 15 to hit. So
[01:40:42] that means you need need 11 or higher to
[01:40:44] hit. And you get your uh two pistols you
[01:40:48] roll
[01:40:49] with. Now they're only uh this is like a
[01:40:52] one-shot thing. Quick minor
[01:40:55] encounter. They converging though.
[01:40:57] They're running still. Just kind of like
[01:40:58] they kind of just run right through the
[01:40:59] storm. They I'm not sure if they make it
[01:41:01] even, but you hit one of them.
[01:41:04] for uh seven. And that drops him down
[01:41:07] from 15 to eight
[01:41:09] health. That was our buddy
[01:41:12] um
[01:41:15] Moose. Now uh Caged with the
[01:41:20] plasma misses. Oh no. Cage misses
[01:41:24] horribly, but luckily he doesn't get a
[01:41:26] critical that critical
[01:41:28] miss. Colin goes in with the
[01:41:30] sword swinging. That's not the right
[01:41:36] one.
[01:41:38] You Oh
[01:41:40] no. Oh no. You missed. Did you hit You
[01:41:44] had knives. I thought you were F. I
[01:41:45] thought you were going. Oh, I thought
[01:41:46] you were going in.
[01:41:47] Well, so it doesn't matter anyways. You
[01:41:50] still missed cuz it was only a two. So
[01:41:53] you go swinging in there and you still
[01:41:54] missed.
[01:41:56] Moose fires in the hole. He was the only
[01:41:58] one that hit. Now,
[01:42:01] Vaughn, any snipes? There are no snipers
[01:42:04] in the background. They're just kind of
[01:42:05] running through, shooting at things,
[01:42:06] trying to steal. It does have plus five,
[01:42:09] but you needed to have um plus five. So,
[01:42:12] all right. So, they're going to be 15 to
[01:42:14] hit. So, if you don't hit 15,
[01:42:17] that means you need to have it 10 or
[01:42:19] higher, right? And what was that
[01:42:26] at? Ah, yes. It helps. It like gives you
[01:42:29] a swing both von. All right, you got to
[01:42:32] go and
[01:42:33] attack. Who's the last one? Tom
[01:42:37] Hawkrop. There you go. Plus five hits
[01:42:41] one. You want to hit the same one and
[01:42:43] try and chop him. Chop him up. That'll
[01:42:44] knock him down to uh
[01:42:47] from his eight health down to uh three.
[01:42:55] Run it. All right, let's do it. And then
[01:42:57] who was the last
[01:43:00] one? I think we had one more. One, two,
[01:43:02] three. Uh, I think you're all shot.
[01:43:04] Actually, they now attack now. There's a
[01:43:06] bunch of them in
[01:43:08] there. I'm going to see what
[01:43:10] happens. Oh, you guys are lucky. They
[01:43:13] needed a 13 or higher to hit. So, all of
[01:43:15] them that were running through, you guys
[01:43:17] uh did a good job flanking. They missed.
[01:43:20] Now, one of
[01:43:21] them. They're running
[01:43:23] past. They missed you. They keep running
[01:43:26] past cuz they're scared. They didn't
[01:43:29] like getting shot. They didn't They
[01:43:31] didn't like the maneuvers you were
[01:43:32] doing. They're running right on through.
[01:43:33] It's like a one chop attack here. You
[01:43:36] got one last attempt. What are you going
[01:43:38] to do for your
[01:43:40] attacking? Von smiles and waves as they
[01:43:43] run by. One of them looks like, "What
[01:43:44] the hell is going?" Uh, yeah. Goodbye,
[01:43:47] buddy. Just following my
[01:43:52] clan. You have Zilla attack. Well, Zilla
[01:43:55] doesn't do anything for an attack. He
[01:43:56] just kind of he can maybe distract high
[01:43:59] or low to see if he'll
[01:44:05] distract.
[01:44:08] Low. Well, no. That was
[01:44:11] calling. You know
[01:44:15] what? Cause a distraction. It's a
[01:44:17] natural 20. You get a natural 20 there.
[01:44:21] So, they cause a distraction. your your
[01:44:22] do your your little
[01:44:24] dragons. I was going to say we just got
[01:44:26] a natural 20. We're going to go with
[01:44:28] they they distract your dragons. Your
[01:44:31] mini dragons distract, which gives you a
[01:44:33] plus one with everything now for
[01:44:36] attacking. Oh, no worries. Natural 20
[01:44:40] came. So now you all get to shoot. And
[01:44:45] so says go the plasma rifle. That's
[01:44:46] going to be plus six. Now that means Oh,
[01:44:49] we hit one. That one of them is dead.
[01:44:52] You kill one of them off. You go in with
[01:44:54] the
[01:44:59] knives and you hit with the knives on
[01:45:02] another one bringing it down from 15 to
[01:45:05] eight and then you swing at one with a
[01:45:08] sword which is another natural 20. Oh
[01:45:13] my. With times
[01:45:15] four, you chopped that other guy in
[01:45:19] half. Look at that. You came water. You
[01:45:21] tomahawk that sword right on down and
[01:45:23] chop one of them in half. Nice one,
[01:45:31] Von. Now,
[01:45:34] Colin, what were you
[01:45:37] using again? You use uh use the pistols,
[01:45:42] right? Were you using uh swords? Colin
[01:45:45] was a sword. All right, the last one.
[01:45:47] Here's a sword attempt.
[01:45:49] Oh, you missed. That's okay. You
[01:45:52] distracted them luckily. So, they don't
[01:45:54] they're not going after you, but two of
[01:45:56] them, they finish running through. They
[01:45:59] don't attack cuz they were distracted.
[01:46:00] You guys got
[01:46:01] lucky. There's two of them on the ground
[01:46:03] that are now dead. All right. One's
[01:46:06] chopped in
[01:46:07] half. One is just hanging out
[01:46:10] there cuz you I think you st shot maybe.
[01:46:13] Yep. Yep.
[01:46:15] So on them, you go over and are you
[01:46:18] going to
[01:46:18] loot? You always double check tap to
[01:46:21] make
[01:46:22] sure loot. All right, you guys go over
[01:46:24] and you loot. Now what you find on them
[01:46:30] is this. They each have some Pogs on
[01:46:34] them. You all get one. There's 10. Each
[01:46:36] one of these is 10 Pogs. So you each get
[01:46:38] a slammer, which is 10 Pogs. And there's
[01:46:40] one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[01:46:43] We'll say we'll put eight in there. So,
[01:46:46] each of you get 12 Pogs.
[01:46:48] Actually, let's do that to add your uh
[01:46:52] your wasteland
[01:46:57] currency.
[01:47:03] No, there we
[01:47:08] go. Got some Pogs you have befriended. I
[01:47:12] like
[01:47:15] it. Not bad. Money, money, money. I have
[01:47:19] to have like an image of Pogs
[01:47:23] dropping. Yeah. Yeah. Get a little guy
[01:47:26] in Pogs. You guys all have your uh you
[01:47:29] have your companions now. The mini
[01:47:30] dragon. There's a plasma. We have our
[01:47:32] ice dragon. We have our mini gas dragon.
[01:47:35] And then we also have our lightning
[01:47:36] dragon. Lightning is a cute guy, I
[01:47:38] guess.
[01:47:40] And then uh yeah, you're hanging out on
[01:47:43] the way back. You were going back to
[01:47:46] uh the uh village. Talk to some of the
[01:47:50] people. Big BK, we're guessing when when
[01:47:52] you walking back, you see Big BK just
[01:47:54] randomly passed out on the ground
[01:47:57] waiting for people to come and hang out
[01:47:59] with his baby dragon hanging on his
[01:48:00] shoulder. It's a baby dragon he has, not
[01:48:02] a little one. You donate to Bogs of
[01:48:04] Villagers. Oh, I like it.
[01:48:07] So, you head on into the
[01:48:08] village. You go uh you guys show them
[01:48:11] you go over and you Oh, no, that's the
[01:48:12] wrong one. You hand them your some Pogs.
[01:48:15] You give them some Pog. Say thank you
[01:48:16] guys uh letting us know where that place
[01:48:17] was. Ghoul Trader. Uh what was his name?
[01:48:21] So, let me put the name in there.
[01:48:30] Rename Sosie.
[01:48:35] All
[01:48:37] right. So, we know who it is. So, the
[01:48:40] merchant, you go back over to them and
[01:48:44] uh you give two to the villagers also. I
[01:48:47] like it. The villagers are like, "Thank
[01:48:48] you. Thank you everybody." And uh each
[01:48:50] one of you hands some pogs to the
[01:48:52] villagers. So, you go down to
[01:48:54] 10.
[01:48:56] Von, there's 10 gone. Do that then.
[01:49:00] There you go. Be nice people to the
[01:49:02] villagers. They were friendly. They're
[01:49:03] good friends of you guys. Yep.
[01:49:06] You'll ask Ozie if he knows anything
[01:49:07] about the eggs me and Moose
[01:49:10] found. That is for the little guys. They
[01:49:12] like them. Yeah, they
[01:49:14] do. All right. And then you go over, you
[01:49:16] get some get some more gator bites. You
[01:49:19] ask for
[01:49:20] those and he's like, "Yeah, sure." He
[01:49:23] just kind of gives you them because
[01:49:24] you're friendly and he's your friend and
[01:49:26] you're an honest person. So, he gives
[01:49:28] each of you
[01:49:29] 10. Now, he asks you anything about the
[01:49:31] eggs. He go, "We found these um dragon
[01:49:34] eggs. Can you help us out with
[01:49:37] those?" He looks at them. He goes, "Ah,
[01:49:39] yes. I got one of those myself." Mystic,
[01:49:42] a friend of ours, had found one in
[01:49:44] another village before and brought it
[01:49:46] over and gave it to me. We traded for
[01:49:47] cuz I've been hanging on to I've been uh
[01:49:49] supposedly I don't know. They It's hard
[01:49:51] to see through, but
[01:49:56] uh they can't see through it, but it
[01:49:57] does seem like it's something living in
[01:49:59] there. They're not sure how long it's
[01:50:00] going to be.
[01:50:03] That's not the right one. I didn't mean
[01:50:05] to press that. I was wiping something
[01:50:06] off the
[01:50:07] [Laughter]
[01:50:09] screen. That's funny.
[01:50:12] Anyways, they
[01:50:16] uh was about to say, he goes, "Oh, it's
[01:50:19] a friend." No, no, I'm sorry. I was
[01:50:21] wiping something off the screen and that
[01:50:22] that went on.
[01:50:24] Yeah, he's hanging out and he tells you
[01:50:26] guys, "All right, well, yeah, those are
[01:50:27] we we just got to hang out with those
[01:50:28] eggs that we're not sure if they're
[01:50:29] going to hatch or not or they're like
[01:50:31] you I don't really know. I've had mine
[01:50:33] for like a week or so. I don't know
[01:50:35] exactly what's going on yet, but it
[01:50:37] moves every now and again. So, I think
[01:50:38] there's something living inside
[01:50:40] it. So, I don't know. Maybe you want to
[01:50:43] ask you're friendly with him and see if
[01:50:45] he can hold your egg. you'll ask
[01:50:53] him. Keep going with some adventuring.
[01:50:55] If you want any packs, let me know. We
[01:50:57] have those in our buy now. And we have
[01:50:59] our singles, too. Darth Goku coming in
[01:51:01] with a shadow. Sword of sha of light and
[01:51:03] shadow. That's a big hit. Nice card
[01:51:06] there about possible acceleration. Oh,
[01:51:09] for accelerating the the dragons or
[01:51:11] making them um making them better. or
[01:51:13] accelerating the uh the uh the the um
[01:51:17] dragon egg hatching. He's like, "Yeah,
[01:51:19] he's not sure. He hasn't figured it out
[01:51:21] yet. They're just getting into it." I
[01:51:22] mean, the um the doctor's been around.
[01:51:25] And he goes, "Yeah, I had the doctor
[01:51:26] check it
[01:51:27] out." And he came over and took a look.
[01:51:31] I'm Fred, the doctor. I run from battle,
[01:51:34] but we'll heal you after if you don't
[01:51:36] die. But he didn't figure he couldn't
[01:51:39] figure it out either. But one of the
[01:51:41] things that they noticed is they did
[01:51:43] have one of those um code disc and every
[01:51:46] time those like shined as well or they
[01:51:47] made noises or whatever things were
[01:51:49] happening with those uh the eggs were
[01:51:51] the ones they started to make they
[01:51:52] started to rumble
[01:51:54] too. I don't
[01:51:59] know. Go be healed by the
[01:52:03] doctor. All right. So's got your egg. I
[01:52:06] like it. Said keep him warm, please.
[01:52:14] Where is
[01:52:24] that? All right. You get the uh dragon
[01:52:27] egg is given to
[01:52:31] uh your handy
[01:52:33] helper, the NPC friend.
[01:52:40] He has the dragon egg now. Oh, nice. I I
[01:52:44] can take care of that for
[01:52:46] you. And he goes, "Yes, I can heal you."
[01:52:48] The doctor says, "Um, normally uh we
[01:52:52] charge something, but I see you got the
[01:52:53] uh the dragon and some bites there. How
[01:52:55] about we just whenever you hang around,
[01:52:56] we're together. You protect me. That's
[01:52:58] all I
[01:52:59] ask." That's all the doctor needs
[01:53:03] because he needs protection. He doesn't
[01:53:04] have weapons. He runs screaming when an
[01:53:05] attack happens. Oh, duckies around here.
[01:53:09] All right, Ducky.
[01:53:10] Ducky goes wander
[01:53:14] away. Yes, the disc are code discs. They
[01:53:18] help to get into things. So, like
[01:53:20] there's been a
[01:53:21] [Music]
[01:53:22] um for
[01:53:24] instance, one of them we think gets into
[01:53:27] the bunker in the back here, a few of
[01:53:28] those, but you haven't figured it out
[01:53:29] because what happened is all of a sudden
[01:53:31] all the disc started cracking. And they
[01:53:33] used to all work one at a time, but you
[01:53:34] need to have multiple of them now to get
[01:53:36] them to work because something happened
[01:53:38] and they all cracked. They used to be
[01:53:40] access codes to get into different
[01:53:41] places throughout the wasteland. That's
[01:53:43] what was used for the accessing
[01:53:45] different places. And also sometimes
[01:53:47] information was on
[01:53:49] them. But you can always, if you're
[01:53:53] lucky, you can always um talk
[01:53:58] to
[01:54:00] No. And always if you bump into the
[01:54:02] handy helper bot, see if they can help
[01:54:04] and take a look at what you found. Maybe
[01:54:07] uh maybe help you figure out what it
[01:54:09] is. It does have an unknown outcome. It
[01:54:12] does have an
[01:54:15] unknown. Well, you wonder if you put a
[01:54:17] bunch of disc around them. I don't know.
[01:54:19] You can try. Yeah, you get you only have
[01:54:21] you don't have any disc yet. So maybe if
[01:54:23] you collect some, you can put them in
[01:54:24] there and see if they I don't know.
[01:54:26] Maybe they'll unlock. Uh maybe they'll
[01:54:27] open. Maybe. I don't know. Who knows
[01:54:28] what'll happen.
[01:54:31] Hey, how's it going? My friend Wazer
[01:54:34] jumping in, hanging out. We'll do some
[01:54:36] adventuring. I see. What if it cracks
[01:54:38] the egg? Well, I don't know. The cat

[02:06:09] wandering in that area. Now, you've been
[02:06:12] told about the area to get to the cave.
[02:06:14] You're worried though because Molor is
[02:06:16] big guy to fight off.
[02:06:19] So, they're telling you though about um
[02:06:22] some of the different areas while you're
[02:06:24] talking to
[02:06:25] them. And um they tell you where there
[02:06:28] is
[02:06:30] a No, not that
[02:06:36] one. Some type of hidden bunker of some
[02:06:39] kind. They're not exactly sure what it
[02:06:41] is
[02:06:41] yet, but uh somebody had been there
[02:06:43] before and hung out and then it came and
[02:06:45] then they left. They weren't really sure
[02:06:47] what happened to it. There we go.
[02:06:51] Boop. Thank you, my friend. I appreciate
[02:06:57] that. Can you sneak? Yeah, you can try
[02:06:59] to. You definitely can try to sneak over

[02:07:04] you guys hanging out? You going to try
[02:07:05] to sneak over there? You want to see
[02:07:07] what goes on in that area? You know, I
[02:07:08] mean, there's nothing really around at
[02:07:09] the
[02:07:10] moment. Moose, I very much appreciate

[02:07:37] see. It's not working out for you right
[02:07:39] now. caged did not work out for you
[02:07:42] because when you go
[02:07:44] there, you guys are trying to
[02:07:47] sneak. Always the opposite. I know you
[02:07:50] guys are trying to
[02:07:51] sneak and when you're heading over
[02:07:53] there, you get near it and there's
[02:07:55] nothing around, somebody tries to open
[02:07:56] the
[02:07:58] door to the thing and all of a sudden
[02:08:01] behind
[02:08:03] you, you have this thing that shows up.
[02:08:07] Cybernetic enhanced raider. It's like,
[02:08:10] yo, what are you
[02:08:15] doing? You see him and you telling him?
[02:08:17] I like it.

[02:17:22] already. Right. All right. So,
[02:17:27] they attack
[02:17:30] back and you guys are lucky cuz they
[02:17:33] missed. You hit the

[02:18:20] a
[02:18:21] counterattack. Oh, you got
[02:18:24] lucky. Vaughn is

[02:18:36] miss. And you you fire. You go and you

[02:18:41] plasma and you hit with the plasma
[02:18:43] bringing him from 15 down to
[02:18:47] 12 and then you duck and fire from the
[02:18:50] ground floor. All right, Moose is there
[02:18:51] and he ducks and he fires. And what do
[02:18:53] you do you got? You got the uh what? I
[02:18:54] can't remember what you had, Moose. Hold
[02:18:55] on a second. You had the D dual pistols.

[02:19:17] And he's angry. He tries to attack all
[02:19:20] of you now. And he swings with an takes
[02:19:23] out an assault rifle. It's kind of
[02:19:25] attached to him and just starts shooting
[02:19:27] and he hits all of you. All right.
[02:19:30] So, Vaughn goes down to 98
[02:19:33] health. Caged goes down to 92
[02:19:39] health. Colin, you go down to
[02:19:44] um 96 health. And Moose, you go down to
[02:19:48] 94 health with those
[02:19:51] hits. You take a couple of
[02:19:53] them. All
[02:19:55] right. And not die. Oh, you were healed
[02:19:58] by the doctor. I forgot about
[02:20:01] that. So that only brings you
[02:20:05] down. 99
[02:20:08] health. There you
[02:20:11] go. That was a rough one. I know. You
[02:20:15] going to shoot him again? You got one
[02:20:16] last chance. I'm guessing you're all
[02:20:18] going after him. So you're going to
[02:20:19] swing with some
[02:20:21] swords. He's dead. There you go. Summon
[02:20:24] it. Round three. Fight.
[02:20:28] Now he swings and he chops. You chop one
[02:20:30] of them. One of you just go over and you
[02:20:31] chop them in half. Go over and you loot
[02:20:33] them. And ah I like it on them to loot.
[02:20:36] What you find is you find an assault
[02:20:40] rifle on them with some assault rifle
[02:20:42] ammo. They actually have two of
[02:20:45] those. Ah, and then they also had on
[02:20:50] them you find some scrap metal from them
[02:20:53] because you can take some of that off of
[02:20:55] them. And you also find uh where is
[02:20:59] that? An energy cell. They use energy
[02:21:03] cells. I forgot to put them
[02:21:11] away. All right. You All
[02:21:15] right. You want nothing.
[02:21:19] Moose want a rifle. Colin says he's
[02:21:22] going to take a rifle and metal. And Von
[02:21:24] Bazer wants m metal. All right, I like
[02:21:27] it. Colin goes, uh, he wants the
[02:21:31] AR. AR and you get 15 rounds. We'll see
[02:21:34] if anybody else takes
[02:21:38] it. Hey, hold the Morero. How's it
[02:21:40] going, my friend? Power cell for caged.
[02:21:42] I like
[02:21:44] it. Caged takes the loot of the power
[02:21:48] cell.
[02:21:56] Von Baser takes some metal. I want to
[02:21:59] make sure I got everything down here.
[02:22:00] So, you might need to repeat
[02:22:03] it. All
[02:22:09] right. Death. Plasmma. No. Plasma. Are
[02:22:13] there pogs? There are pogs. The boat is
[02:22:15] still going. All right. Pogs come out.
[02:22:18] And we do have some Pogs. There's 10
[02:22:20] Pogs. per
[02:22:23] person. So you all get a slammer. So you
[02:22:26] get 10 Pogs for each of you.
[02:22:29] Now if somebody would like to take say
[02:22:31] something else and trade the Pog, they
[02:22:33] could do that, too. We go up
[02:22:36] 20
[02:22:38] 60
[02:22:42] 20 and then
[02:22:49] 42 for
[02:22:51] Moose. For Moose. Yeah, you got you went
[02:22:55] up. You added some on earlier to
[02:22:58] something else. So you're up to 42 now,
[02:23:00] I think.
[02:23:02] Boo. You do have 60 Pogs. There you go.
[02:23:06] Hey, Travis. How's it going, my
[02:23:08] friend? And you take everything else.
[02:23:10] So, that means you grab the
[02:23:13] um the ammo and the other assault rifle.

[02:27:39] goes, "Ah, yeah, we can do some uh we
[02:27:40] can do some things for you. We always
[02:27:42] upgrade uh people all around the town.
[02:27:44] We're friendly. We like to do that as
[02:27:45] long as you're good and helping us." So,
[02:27:48] Cage goes, "Well, I got a couple plasma
[02:27:49] rifles, a pistol, couple pistols,
[02:27:52] pistols, and a couple knives." Now, I do
[02:27:55] have gardillo bites and a power cell. Uh
[02:27:59] so, I don't know what you can do with
[02:28:01] those. So, it's up to you. Do you want
[02:28:03] to see if you can take a couple of them,
[02:28:05] put them together, maybe upgrade the
[02:28:07] plasma rifles by merging them together
[02:28:09] somehow and maybe adding the power cell
[02:28:12] or do you want to just uh see what they
[02:28:14] can do in
[02:28:18] general? Buy a plasma program. Oh, bio
[02:28:21] plasma. You might be able
[02:28:26] to trade Pogs for some rifle. You want
[02:28:29] to what? For the plasma rifle? Yes, you
[02:28:31] can do that. All right. So, you're going

[02:28:39] And I want to upgrade my
[02:28:43] rifle. Ask me for destroyed. Yeah. Well,
[02:28:45] yeah, he can uh he can buy some things.
[02:28:48] You can buy things. Well, they have
[02:28:50] stuff uh you know, in the store. Is that
[02:28:52] what you're trying to get? Or are you
[02:28:53] talking from
[02:28:58] caged? Huh? Metal. Caged. You want some
[02:29:00] metal?
[02:29:02] Oh, there you go. So, okay. Do you have
[02:29:04] an offer? You have some metal for
[02:29:05] upgrading and somebody would like to buy
[02:29:06] it the the plasma rifle from you if you
[02:29:10] want. Ah, or you can do it and just say
[02:29:14] what they have uh for upgrades. Maybe
[02:29:15] they can um
[02:29:17] moose. See, they have uh only the gator
[02:29:21] dillow bites, but they're friendly with
[02:29:23] that trader. So, maybe they can help
[02:29:24] him. You can uh help you do something
[02:29:26] here.
[02:29:29] You do have a discount from
[02:29:31] Sozy. He's a friend. You going to gift
[02:29:34] it to him? Oh, nice. You're going to
[02:29:35] gift them some metal. Well, look at
[02:29:39] that. Oh, you had it from your first
[02:29:41] kill. So, you have two of them. All
[02:29:42] right. So, you're going to keep the
[02:29:44] plasma rifles and gave them the
[02:29:49] metal. And this is what we're going to
[02:29:51] do. All
[02:29:52] right. You have two. Yes. You have two
[02:29:54] plasma rifles. Correct. So, you want to
[02:29:57] give him the plasma rifle plus the uh
[02:29:58] the metal that was there and then
[02:30:04] um yeah, you can check it
[02:30:07] out. All right. So, one goes to Moose.
[02:30:10] All right. Sell one to Moose and then
[02:30:11] you take the uh the other one to use for
[02:30:14] your ammo for I mean for your um metal
[02:30:17] from your friend to
[02:30:18] upgrade. All right. Moose gets that. So,
[02:30:20] you trade it. What do you want to give
[02:30:22] Moose? And we're going to go and find an
[02:30:23] upgraded plasma rifle.
[02:30:41] And there we
[02:30:46] go. 15
[02:30:50] Pogs. You can try to upgrade one of your
[02:30:52] swords. Yeah.
[02:30:57] and two cats. What do you like? Do you
[02:30:59] want to trade
[02:31:01] those? Which ones you looking
[02:31:03] for? Sounds good. All right. 15 Pogs and
[02:31:07] two cats is what you're giving
[02:31:11] him when he takes one of the
[02:31:16] plasmas. Goes to our buddy Moose.
[02:31:23] All
[02:31:24] right, you get a plasma rifle and you go
[02:31:28] down 15 Pogs from your 42 down
[02:31:32] to
[02:31:34] 27. He goes up to
[02:31:36] [Music]
[02:31:37] 75 and now you got four
[02:31:40] pistols also cuz he gave you the
[02:31:48] pistols. Gun guys. Yes. Shake it. I like
[02:31:52] it.
[02:31:54] Shake on it and the pistols. There you
[02:31:56] go. I like it. Not
[02:32:00] bad. Good deal. You got a plasma rifle
[02:32:04] now. Let's see what comes out for our
[02:32:06] friend
[02:32:19] here. All
[02:32:31] right, let's get it now. I'll try this.
[02:32:33] I don't like the other one. It didn't
[02:32:34] show it right.
[02:32:50] Let's see one rip. I like
[02:33:00] it. All
[02:33:07] righty. Why did that so close? I
[02:33:09] couldn't even see the weapon. That was
[02:33:12] silly.
[02:33:17] Now you're talking and you want to
[02:33:19] upgrade yourself. See what they have,
[02:33:22] Colin. They don't have too much for sale
[02:33:24] for upgrade, but they do have some
[02:33:26] plasma ammo if you need. And they have
[02:33:27] some ammo for weapons. One of the things
[02:33:30] they always do sell, they have always
[02:33:31] there. They have rata away cuz this is
[02:33:33] the place for rata
[02:33:35] away. They make it. That's what they do
[02:33:38] there specifically.
[02:33:43] [Laughter]
[02:33:47] I like it. They have AR ammo.
[02:33:52] Yes. Plasma
[02:33:55] [Music]
[02:33:58] rounds. There we go. That's the one
[02:34:01] we're going to
[02:34:02] use. Plasma rounds. It does have plasma
[02:34:05] rounds. You can get some of those there.
[02:34:06] They have ammo there. Now, that would be
[02:34:08] 10 for uh 15 rounds.
[02:34:15] So you let me know what you
[02:34:19] want. So upgrade will use the same
[02:34:23] one. Upgrade ones will use the same.
[02:34:26] That's
[02:34:31] correct. There you go. We'll get that
[02:34:33] there for a second. Take a minute and
[02:34:34] we'll be right back over with it. AR
[02:34:37] rounds for 30 of them would be 15 pogs.
[02:34:48] And if I'm missing something, let me
[02:34:53] know. AR, you would cost uh well, it's
[02:34:57] either you'd have to have uh probably
[02:35:00] like I think it's like 30 pogs, if I
[02:35:01] remember right, we did last
[02:35:06] time. All right, here you go.
[02:35:10] This is the
[02:35:18] uh the upgraded plasma
[02:35:20] rifle. There we go. Upgraded plasma
[02:35:25] rifle for you, my
[02:35:28] friend. That is now what you
[02:35:31] have. Now, what that means is normally
[02:35:34] you had it two. So now you have three to
[02:35:37] roll with for your dice for your D2s. So
[02:35:40] that's what happens. And also as you
[02:35:43] upgrade it more, it has more. You might
[02:35:45] have some more abilities that come on,
[02:35:47] but you now have the upgraded one which
[02:35:50] gives
[02:35:52] you three D2s instead of
[02:35:59] two. And it is plus six instead of five.
[02:36:05] So you get a little bit better of a hit
[02:36:09] chance. Buy your sword. Ah, he'd
[02:36:11] probably take
[02:36:16] 15. Nice. I like it.
[02:36:24] Von
[02:36:26] sold. Gives you him the sword. You give
[02:36:28] him the sword. You go. All right, take
[02:36:29] the
[02:36:30] sword. And uh can you upgrade my
[02:36:33] [Music]
[02:36:35] uh
[02:36:40] AR? Is that what you're
[02:36:44] asking? Yeah, you can trade the pistols
[02:36:46] to upgrade. Try to upgrade again. Give
[02:36:48] them all of them if you want. You have
[02:36:50] another upgrade attempt. So there you
[02:36:51] go. I mean, you can you've got
[02:36:54] uh four pistols. I mean, you got a lot
[02:36:58] of them.
[02:37:02] All right, try
[02:37:05] [Laughter]
[02:37:08] it. All right, so we do that. Let's find
[02:37:12] uh
[02:37:51] Okay, we like that. That's good. All
[02:37:55] right. So, you upgrade your PL your
[02:37:57] rifle, your assault rifle. He goes,
[02:37:58] "Yeah, we can do that." And he goes and
[02:38:00] goes over. They're all wand. Every time
[02:38:02] he does that, he goes and wanders over
[02:38:03] and he talks to
[02:38:07] um he talks to the people in the
[02:38:09] village. He's like, "Yeah, we can do
[02:38:11] those things."
[02:38:14] Now then they come back and give you uh
[02:38:19] your upgraded assault rifle
[02:38:21] here comes out
[02:38:26] also. Then we have a
[02:38:29] uh this one here. Going to try to
[02:38:32] upgrade again your plasma
[02:38:38] rifle is what you
[02:38:42] do. Yeah. I get to rest by the fire.
[02:38:45] That's a good one. Hey, have a good one,
[02:38:47] my friend Moose. Thanks for coming in,
[02:38:48] hanging out. That was a fun
[02:38:56] time. We had a good time here, hanging
[02:38:58] out. So, I do appreciate
[02:39:07] it. So, let's get uh let's get the rest
[02:39:10] of the things made quickly. All right,
[02:39:12] here we go. We're going to do uh
[02:39:17] remove. Then I have to put in
[02:39:23] image.
[02:39:27] Okay. I didn't download. I downloaded
[02:39:34] it. There you
[02:39:36] go. Uh there we are.
[02:39:40] There is your uh upgraded assault
[02:39:43] rifle. All right, there you go. Get rid
[02:39:45] of the villagers so you can see your
[02:39:47] upgraded assault
[02:39:49] rifle. And that goes to our buddy uh
[02:39:52] Colin,
[02:39:54] right? There you go.
[02:39:59] Colin gave him some things, multiple
[02:40:02] things. He gave him a
[02:40:03] sword and they upgraded your assault
[02:40:06] rifle. So now you have um instead of a
[02:40:10] three you have plus four to hit and
[02:40:14] instead of two d6s it is three d6s when
[02:40:17] you
[02:40:18] attack. So there you
[02:40:21] go on your upgraded one. You have a good
[02:40:25] one my friend. Have a good one. Thank
[02:40:26] you for coming in hanging out. I'll see

[02:40:36] doesn't. It's all I can
[02:40:38] say. Sometimes it works, sometimes it
[02:40:41] doesn't. And then here is your super
[02:40:44] upgraded
[02:40:53] um the upgraded
[02:40:56] AR. There you

[00:10:04] things what to do have a good time with
[00:10:06] people like I don't like the ones where
[00:10:08] you go in and like bye bye bye bye the
[00:10:10] entire time I feel like it's a I'm gonna
[00:10:12] make a comment feel like it's an old I'm
[00:10:15] going to a used car salesman
[00:10:17] lot and I had friends that were used car
[00:10:19] salesman so they I they were not that
[00:10:21] way but if you know what I mean that
[00:10:23] like
[00:10:24] movie version of a used car
[00:10:27] salesman that's why feel like sometimes
[00:10:29] when I hear that that's why I like the
[00:10:31] people I like to go in and I hear the
[00:10:32] people that are like hey come well we're
[00:10:33] just hanging out having a good time
[00:10:35] doing whatever and that's like that's
[00:10:36] what I like to do like you go to a store
[00:10:38] you hang out maybe buy some cards see
[00:10:42] what they are maybe play a game or
[00:10:44] something like that you
[00:10:45] know so let me get this up there for
[00:10:47] everyone I'm not trying to you know
[00:10:49] everybody likes their own thing you know
[00:10:51] I'm not trying to say you can't like
[00:10:53] what you like you know I I like some
[00:10:56] things that I know others don't like
[00:10:57] that are weird so I'm not going to care
[00:10:59] about that I'm just saying that that's
[00:11:01] my opinion that's why I don't go to
[00:11:02] those ones that's why I do it my way
[00:11:04] here and we're going to put this up for
[00:11:05] a pack deal for everyone for the game if
[00:11:08] you want to jump on
[00:11:17] it yeah they would try to sell you your
[00:11:19] own kidney exactly that type of thing
[00:11:21] see that's what I feel like sometimes
[00:11:22] when I pop into some of these when I'm
[00:11:23] streaming around like I went to one that
[00:11:25] was like an like I think it was like a
[00:11:28] one of those ones that they like sell
[00:11:34] um sh the stuff they buy storage
[00:11:37] containers storage containers that's
[00:11:39] what I was looking for they sell storage
[00:11:40] containers I was like I'll pop in and
[00:11:42] see what that's like anyways maybe
[00:11:43] there's something they might have that I
[00:11:45] want oh I can't go those ones I feel
[00:11:49] like I'm out of like a an Auctioneer on
[00:11:51] the side of the highway like when you go
[00:11:53] by and you get to one of those
[00:11:55] like stops pulling off the highway it's
[00:11:59] like an Auctioneer on the side yelling
[00:12:00] at you to do something I don't but
[00:12:02] anyways some I've been to some of them
[00:12:04] though I actually bought something from
[00:12:06] one person in the electronics one they
[00:12:07] were just like hey this is what we got
[00:12:09] this is what we got so it's weird some
[00:12:12] people are different on here that's all
[00:12:14] I'd have to say not my crew but you know
[00:12:16] what they might be your crew go for it I
[00:12:19] don't care
[00:12:20] man I hang out with all tons of
[00:12:23] people I was the one that was like the
[00:12:25] poor kid in my high school that um
[00:12:28] somehow was friendly with the rich
[00:12:31] kids and got to do all kinds of weird
[00:12:33] weird things so growing up that I
[00:12:35] wouldn't have normally done because I
[00:12:38] didn't care who you were and some people
[00:12:39] didn't either it and that's what it
[00:12:42] boils down to I don't really care what
[00:12:43] you're like just be nice right just be
[00:12:45] nice it's all that matters who cares
[00:12:48] what you're like just be
[00:12:51] nice we're going to do this for a pack
[00:12:53] deal right now this is going to start
[00:12:55] you out with two and a half points
[00:12:57] because this is one this is one and

[00:13:33] if you want to pit your character
[00:13:34] starting strength you can I'm sorry I
[00:13:37] just I like to keep an open container of
[00:13:40] liquids away from cards so that's why I

[00:19:12] adventure game there but if you don't
[00:19:14] want to play that we can just rip the
[00:19:15] packs open you always get the packs but
[00:19:17] you potential with the game is to get
[00:19:19] extra on top of it you want me to uh go
[00:19:22] through it and just kind of show what it
[00:19:23] is because you always get these
[00:19:27] packs but if it's more if you uh sure
[00:19:31] all right so let's do an example here if
[00:19:32] you don't mind I wait I'll use you an
[00:19:34] example so you understand so you always
[00:19:36] get these packs no matter what what's up
[00:19:38] on screen you pay for them you walk away
[00:19:42] with these packs ripped or shipped
[00:19:43] whatever you want then what happens is
[00:19:46] each one of these packs depending on
[00:19:48] what they are or we at the certain
[00:19:50] amount of points in the Wasteland
[00:19:51] Adventure this is worth one each play
[00:19:54] booster is worth half so this is two and
[00:19:57] three points for your character or three
[00:19:58] strength for your character all right
[00:20:00] you get to choose through the show notes
[00:20:03] if you look in there it'll let you know
[00:20:05] there are four character types
[00:20:07] technician strong human detective or
[00:20:09] mutant each one of them have plus and
[00:20:11] minuses in each box on their Wasteland
[00:20:14] adventure and we you either tell me what
[00:20:17] to pick out of the 79 cards and there's
[00:20:19] there's 20 78 cards in each one of these
[00:20:22] and there's 12 in the blue and you get a
[00:20:25] plus or minus then at the end of it you
[00:20:28] battle off against one of these that you
[00:20:30] pull out now it's obvious going to be
[00:20:32] shuffled up and you pull them out from
[00:20:33] here like that there's 10 of them and if
[00:20:35] you happen to be over three so if you
[00:20:37] get four points or higher or four
[00:20:39] strength or higher to believe beat a
[00:20:41] velociraptor you get a spin on The
[00:20:44] Collector booster wheel to win a free
[00:20:45] collector booster now if you're only at
[00:20:47] three points you could still potentially
[00:20:50] beat marry or Owen because they only two
[00:20:54] and get a free set booster now do you
[00:20:57] want to play the game or uh I can just
[00:21:00] rip the packs or I can ship them it's a
[00:21:01] p Wade so let me know what you want to
[00:21:03] be for a character gave a little quick
[00:21:05] rundown

[00:21:14] there's three technician mutant strong
[00:21:17] human or a detective and each one of
[00:21:19] them have pluses or minuses depending on
[00:21:21] what character they

[00:59:57] all right in this adventure if you want
[00:59:59] to go on this adventure we'll start out
[01:00:01] with three
[01:00:02] strength but this adventure is going to
[01:00:05] cost
[01:00:07] you this it's not a bad price though

[01:00:27] say like u c r for common uncommon
[01:00:32] Mythic um rare um stuff like that and
[01:00:35] then also dependent on the on the rare
[01:00:38] or Mythic card it can be worth more or

[01:00:43] the big difference is that you'll see

[01:36:42] gonna be a detective you're already out
[01:36:43] on it
[01:36:45] detective here we go as a detective you
[01:36:49] wander through the Wasteland
[01:36:52] looking for Treasure now I did update it
[01:36:57] so it should be correct
[01:37:00] now just so you are aware the detective
[01:37:03] is harmed by
[01:37:11] food all right just you are
[01:37:14] aware but I did correct everything so
[01:37:18] 21 number 21 1 2 3 four five 6 7 8 9 10
[01:37:26] 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
[01:37:33] 21 I have one of them in the wrong
[01:37:35] sleeve oh look at that wrong red sleeve
[01:37:39] whatever 21 let's see if you get a
[01:37:41] treasure along the way
[01:37:44] there oh you find a treasure one two
[01:37:49] three and four as a detective that
[01:37:53] treasure helps you in your adventure
[01:37:55] you're able to trade that for
[01:37:57] information let's see here though do you
[01:38:00] find a friend or an item that's G to

[01:38:27] a
[01:38:28] detective a copy does not help you
[01:38:34] because that is something a technician
[01:38:36] looks for not a detective so with this
[01:38:40] Coffey you actually lose your treasure
[01:38:42] because you're trying to do something

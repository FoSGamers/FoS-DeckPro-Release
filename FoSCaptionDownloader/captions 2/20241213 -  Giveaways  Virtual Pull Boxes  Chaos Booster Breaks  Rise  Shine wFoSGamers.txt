[00:08:12] spicy sorry about
[00:08:15] that your music is trash Lucy I don't
[00:08:18] know I've never heard it you got to tell
[00:08:19] me what your music is you got to tell me
[00:08:21] what your music is I don't know I
[00:08:23] haven't heard it before so I can't tell
[00:08:24] you if it's trash or not
[00:08:30] we'll be on a boat
[00:08:33] soon purchases do not um it's only going
[00:08:36] to be the tips that's what I was saying
[00:08:37] the main thing I was going to be doing
[00:08:38] for the show is um for the show I'm
[00:08:40] actually just going to be taking a box
[00:08:41] of time spiral one of the three boxes
[00:08:43] that we have I'm going to have my boys
[00:08:44] pick out which one they like and we're
[00:08:45] going to open up one of the boxes not
[00:08:47] too bad James and um when we open up
[00:08:51] that box I was just going to have just
[00:08:52] hang out open that box if we going to
[00:08:54] you know do a adventure somebody want to
[00:08:56] jump in on if they wanted to but the
[00:08:57] main thing was just literally I wasn't
[00:08:58] even going to be selling anything
[00:08:59] specific I was just going to put my
[00:09:00] stuff up I was going to push anything to
[00:09:02] sell anything somebody wants to jump in
[00:09:03] and get it that's fine to add something
[00:09:05] to open up for the show I'm good with
[00:09:06] that but to keep entertainment wise
[00:09:09] going I'm good with that that's fine but
[00:09:11] that's all mainly all the the reason why
[00:09:13] we're doing it as the um the tips is
[00:09:18] because I get 100% of the tips they
[00:09:20] don't take any cut of it so what we do
[00:09:23] is um by taking no cut of that I
[00:09:25] actually get to take all of that money
[00:09:26] you give me rather than them taking a
[00:09:28] cut um you know go towards fees and
[00:09:30] stuff and I get to actually put all of
[00:09:32] the money towards it so that's why we're
[00:09:34] doing it as tips um instead that's why
[00:09:37] that's why I was trying to do it that
[00:09:38] way if that makes any sense luk like I
[00:09:40] wasn't even planning on really trying to
[00:09:41] sell anything it was more less just
[00:09:43] trying to have something as
[00:09:44] entertainment for people that are
[00:09:45] hanging out while we try to get some uh
[00:09:48] tips for the
[00:09:50] people um I you know what if you're not
[00:09:53] going to be here this afternoon I I
[00:09:54] don't see why not yeah that' be fine if
[00:09:55] you want to throw the tip in now and
[00:09:57] then we could do that now and then this
[00:09:58] afternoon if you're not going to be in
[00:09:59] this afternoon that's fine I'm okay with
[00:10:01] that yeah that's good with me and we'll
[00:10:04] do it that way and that's but that for
[00:10:06] everybody else though that's mainly what
[00:10:07] we're doing is this afternoon I'm not
[00:10:10] trying to sell anything I'm trying to
[00:10:11] just come on hang out open some packs

[00:10:15] give some things away um and then in the
[00:10:17] process that goes giving the things away
[00:10:19] every 5 minutes there we'll do for a
[00:10:20] little while um I just want to just see

[01:49:56] okay you're 18 on the big guy bugs go
[01:50:00] squash nice saving ammo good idea good
[01:50:04] idea so now I think we had lco I think
[01:50:08] Tyler just
[01:50:09] went so we spicy I think went and I
[01:50:13] think you all went this time actually
[01:50:14] did luk go I can't remember all right if
[01:50:17] not we're I think they did but we're
[01:50:20] going to go again for you guys we're
[01:50:21] going to see what happens the little
[01:50:23] ones oh my God the little ones get sent
[01:50:26] out again no didn't Luke did not go Luke
[01:50:29] what are you doing well Luke or Bob what
[01:50:31] are you guys going to do because the
[01:50:33] little ones are running at you and they
[01:50:35] have a critical right now that is not
[01:50:38] good got the big
[01:50:42] guy 15 plus your gat you going to hit
[01:50:45] the big one I don't like it you hit the
[01:50:48] big
[01:50:49] one with all of your shots because it's
[01:50:51] a nice big one there you get pretty
[01:50:52] close those three shots so six shots go
[01:50:55] out you hit that big guy
[01:50:57] four 13 bring him down to
[01:51:00] 10 Health look at that one almost
[01:51:06] dead need to sit in yeah Bob has a
[01:51:10] plasma that is correct a plasma rifle
[01:51:13] and they have um six rounds of plasma
[01:51:17] ammo
[01:51:18] left and Tyler has seven rounds of
[01:51:21] plasma ammo left they used him
[01:51:25] once and
[01:51:28] spicy H used it too went down to
[01:51:33] two
[01:51:34] Nico went down or also to two CU he used
[01:51:39] there we got to switch back to the black
[01:51:42] dice all right black dice it can be we
[01:51:43] can do
[01:51:45] that better off stepping on I know
[01:51:48] Plasma's not working that well plasma
[01:51:49] doesn't work that well
[01:51:53] should we try I mean he can try to step
[01:51:54] on him yeah I think we should probably
[01:51:57] use some of his health he has 220 health
[01:51:59] and he's at 38 I think we should use
[01:52:00] some of his health
[01:52:04] probably he can use the bot of his rifle
[01:52:07] to try to squash one of the little ones
[01:52:08] yeah yeah probably good idea throw him
[01:52:09] some health bring him up to uh 88 Health
[01:52:12] instead of I mean 78 Health instead of
[01:52:14] uh 38 Health it's probably a good idea
[01:52:17] there get his health back so he doesn't
[01:52:20] die
[01:52:22] then you're going to roll and you're
[01:52:23] going to try to hit him with hit the
[01:52:24] little one hit the little one and oh no

[01:55:18] every
[01:55:19] round you have a minus five
[01:55:23] for five rounds on your health so every
[01:55:28] roll is a minus five for five five of
[01:55:30] those rolls is what RADS give you
[01:55:36] yes so it's like a little poison it'll

[02:13:35] the one with 17 and we're try oh you get
[02:13:37] a natural 20 that means a critical hit
[02:13:41] okay here we go we're going to have to
[02:13:43] get out our dice to see what per what
[02:13:45] multiplier are you going to get on your
[02:13:46] on your
[02:13:48] attack oh a four

[02:14:10] mediumsized bug is dead there's one
[02:14:12] mediumsized bug left he's scared he
[02:14:15] starts to turn around to
[02:14:17] run that mediumsized bug there's one
[02:14:20] left what do you guys going to do I
[02:14:22] think you all can do something can we
[02:14:25] tackle you can try to run after him and
[02:14:26] Tackle him but you're going to have to
[02:14:28] do that'll be a uh you know you going
[02:14:30] try that here you go try it try to
[02:14:32] tackle and son of a [¬†__¬†] that works you
[02:14:35] run and you tackle
[02:14:37] him look at that Tyler jumps on top of
[02:14:42] the medium-sized bug with 11 Health
[02:14:45] left what are you going to do
[02:14:48] now what are you going to do now
[02:14:51] bug starts bucking all over the
[02:14:54] place bucking all over the place not
[02:14:56] don't know what to do we don't have we
[02:14:58] don't have an animal tamer perk can we
[02:15:00] make him unconscious oh um you're he's
[02:15:03] he's going slower maybe the how about
[02:15:05] this we'll see if everybody can team up
[02:15:07] and all kick them and if you can all
[02:15:08] kick them which are going to have to
[02:15:10] we're going have to say a 16 or higher
[02:15:11] because of if you hit a 16 or higher you
[02:15:13] all get to kick them and they'll go
[02:15:14] unconscious how's that that's what we'll
[02:15:15] do you all run over to kick him as

[02:20:34] to
[02:20:36] 13 and then you go plasma
[02:20:43] ammo up to five

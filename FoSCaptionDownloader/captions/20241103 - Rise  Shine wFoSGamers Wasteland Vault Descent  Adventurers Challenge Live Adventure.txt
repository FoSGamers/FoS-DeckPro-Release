[00:07:56] ioria but you also
[00:08:00] are
[00:08:02] our Adventurer now you just head into
[00:08:07] the
[00:08:09] Vault for the first
[00:08:13] time and on that way in there you happen
[00:08:15] to run across a small Raider which is

[00:08:21] you're going to attack you're going to
[00:08:22] try to attack it what would happen and
[00:08:24] you have to make that decision play a
[00:08:26] little game and what we do is you decide
[00:08:27] what you do we'd roll a dice
[00:08:30] because it play a little bit D and D
[00:08:31] like thing and we go from there now we
[00:08:33] have fun with it recently we've been
[00:08:34] doing a good time but uh it's been
[00:08:36] slower because we do not have our new
[00:08:39] the new release as others are looking
[00:08:40] for that's what we keep running into so
[00:08:43] I was doing some um some stuff to grab
[00:08:47] uh have a little bit of fun and see if
[00:08:50] you all want to participate with us but
[00:08:53] we'll
[00:08:55] see and remember if you beat things you
[00:08:58] do have current within the Wasteland is
[00:09:01] uh pogs here you can get so you could be
[00:09:03] the lucky one to walk away with some of
[00:09:05] those with your character for your
[00:09:07] character as a wasteland
[00:09:09] currency but anyways we'll continue I
[00:09:13] think it's going to be a slow day
[00:09:14] because it's uh we do not have the new
[00:09:16] product but that's why we play our game
[00:09:17] and try interesting new things out and
[00:09:19] we're uh opening some packs here for a
[00:09:21] little bit we'll see what that is not
[00:09:23] bad there put that in the back put the
[00:09:27] Dorn away and Dorn's been reallyy good
[00:09:29] so far far what do you all think you
[00:09:30] have like d warn so
[00:09:32] far you that have been hanging out here
[00:09:35] this
[00:09:36] morning and'll open up another one from
[00:09:38] our left side we're going to see what
[00:09:41] else we get and hopefully you all will
[00:09:42] like to try it on the little Adventure
[00:09:44] like I was saying then you get to pick
[00:09:46] your own pack too so you know what we'll
[00:09:48] do
[00:09:49] this oh I appreciate that buddy I
[00:09:53] actually do appreciate that a lot I mean
[00:09:54] generally too the thing is if you buy
[00:09:56] them now they end up as auctions and
[00:09:58] they get run up really high
[00:09:59] so at least if you wait for me you know
[00:10:01] I'm not going to have it as an auction
[00:10:02] I'll have it as a set price that's like
[00:10:04] relatively like that's reasonable you
[00:10:06] know I'll put them over the top I don't
[00:10:07] make it I don't make anything really on
[00:10:09] them as much as anybody would think just
[00:10:11] because I don't have the same resources
[00:10:13] as stores you
[00:10:16] know means half the time I'm the same
[00:10:18] price as a
[00:10:19] store well here we
[00:10:22] go I'll open this one and see what you
[00:10:24] got here and if you wanted to that was a

[00:10:31] out of one of those four I can't I don't
[00:10:33] know which one it is cuz we all shuffled
[00:10:34] into them um if you pull out of one of
[00:10:36] the four and it has the play booster box
[00:10:39] in there you get one of those that's

[00:39:09] um your pistol is still active you still
[00:39:11] have it so one of the things that I like
[00:39:13] to do BFG is if people want to continue
[00:39:15] playing the adventure game with everyone
[00:39:17] you can continue on daily after day
[00:39:19] after day the whole point is this you
[00:39:22] can make this as your character you
[00:39:24] build it that's why I started as a the
[00:39:26] adventurer that you build into what you
[00:39:28] want here cuz as you go the game will
[00:39:31] become a little harder for
[00:39:36] you so you still still do have your

[01:13:30] side for you have been hanging out and
[01:13:35] watching I don't know I have to say I

[01:13:42] what happened there we'll we'll go over
[01:13:44] it one more time we'll give a quick

[01:14:38] everywhere token was definitely on the
[01:14:40] other side all right that was the right

[01:32:09] actually even have a pack that you can
[01:32:10] get for your shipping Now
[01:32:13] t-rock by winning all
[01:32:16] that believe you have almost free
[01:32:18] shipping for an entire pack so let's see
[01:32:21] here now I guess what we'll do is so for
[01:32:24] instance one of the things is we've been
[01:32:26] building let's see if I can get one if
[01:32:27] I'm lucky enough to find one I've been
[01:32:28] putting stickers on these to help with
[01:32:30] our stuff let me see if I can find one
[01:32:32] that has a
[01:32:34] sticker nope now I put that back in
[01:32:38] there let's see if we can find one with
[01:32:40] the sticker let's do in the back here
[01:32:45] nope going to grab a just a chunk of
[01:32:47] them
[01:32:48] out nope nope NOP damn it we've been
[01:32:51] working on these last uh
[01:32:55] couple days here trying to get the ones
[01:32:58] with we're going to just grab a handful
[01:32:59] from the back here one of them is going
[01:33:00] to have a sticker on it I know one of
[01:33:02] them has
[01:33:02] to I think one of them has to ah see
[01:33:06] might have a medium bug written on it
[01:33:07] and that tells you what you're going to
[01:33:08] be fighting against or small bug where's
[01:33:10] the
[01:33:12] stickers son of a I thought we put
[01:33:14] them on
[01:33:16] those now I'm going to have to shuffle
[01:33:17] that in because those don't have
[01:33:19] anything we know those don't have
[01:33:21] anything for the um the big hit there
[01:33:24] and the third one so let's check the
[01:33:25] fourth one out maybe it was in the
[01:33:27] fourth one we put a bunch of them
[01:33:29] into but either
[01:33:31] way you
[01:33:36] all would potentially have one of those
[01:33:38] let's see if we can find one of those
[01:33:39] the stickers anyways the whole point I'm
[01:33:40] trying to find that is the ones that
[01:33:43] have the stickers on them maybe it's in
[01:33:44] this box I did
[01:33:50] them you got to be kidding me
[01:33:54] the I can't see the sticker on the
[01:33:55] bottom of it one of them has a sticker
[01:33:57] we had this on a bunch of them we did
[01:33:59] this if I can find where the stickers
[01:34:03] are there for instance we'd take out
[01:34:06] number two the first one here and I'm
[01:34:09] going to stick it in there one of it
[01:34:10] when you pull it out of the box it's
[01:34:12] going to have this stuck onto it that
[01:34:15] says small
[01:34:17] bug there you go that means you will
[01:34:21] fight a small bug as the adventure now

[01:34:26] pogs is just your currency so some fun
[01:34:31] times it's up to you if you want to play

[01:43:47] we've had recently the last couple days
[01:43:48] we've had some really good luck pulling
[01:43:50] it out of everything that we've had we'
[01:43:51] got some good bloomo some de some really
[01:43:54] good dmor like I opened a box today a
[01:43:56] little bit ago and I pulled out a great
[01:43:58] Dorn one got a nice uh
[01:44:01] Japanese
[01:44:03] foil which was very nice right now I'm
[01:44:07] just putting the stickers on our uh on
[01:44:09] our stuff
[01:44:11] here oh oh I'm
[01:44:16] sorry website the website I'm pulling
[01:44:19] value from I'm confused I mean like what
[01:44:21] like you're I'm like where I buy stuff
[01:44:24] from wh's garage is that what you're
[01:44:27] asking I'm confused sorry if I
[01:44:33] am we're going to put out an insult
[01:44:41] injury for a dollar if you'd like
[01:44:45] it oh oh oh those are coming from um MTG
[01:44:51] stocks MTG stocks it pulls from the
[01:44:54] market price from TCG player and other
[01:44:56] places and I can change it around and do
[01:44:58] different ones so like for instance
[01:45:00] um like one of the nice things is you
[01:45:03] can go down and go some information you
[01:45:04] can go to the finance of it see how it's
[01:45:06] gone through the time frame get some
[01:45:08] tools and like right now it's with TCG
[01:45:10] player but you can adjust and go and see
[01:45:12] like see it on and what decks it's in
[01:45:15] and even the record of the pricing and
[01:45:17] stuff so it's kind of
[01:45:19] cool yeah yeah that's where I'm getting
[01:45:21] it from
[01:45:26] there you go yeah that if that's what
[01:45:28] you're asking I think that's what you're
[01:45:30] asking
[01:45:31] there MTG stocks they do a pretty good
[01:45:33] job with um keeping pulling information
[01:45:36] so not
[01:45:40] bad but I'm going to uh we'll throw
[01:45:42] another card out here for you
[01:45:44] next now remember we have a bunch of
[01:45:46] them here bunch of different ones it's
[01:45:48] up to you if you like yeah yeah I like
[01:45:51] how it's set up
[01:45:54] I personally think it's nice how it is
[01:45:56] there at least gives you the information
[01:45:57] on
[01:46:01] it this A oh no I put that one back but
[01:46:04] I know some people like a little uh let
[01:46:08] that let's tighten this up
[01:46:18] here tighten that
[01:46:21] up I'm going to put out
[01:46:24] a reanimate that's a nice one for you
[01:46:32] all there you go
[01:46:39] reanimate you are my friends and that is
[01:46:42] a $7 card we'll throw it out for this
[01:46:44] for you if you
[01:46:46] want we uh like I said we're just doing
[01:46:48] some singles here you can decide if you
[01:46:50] want it or not we're just putting I'm
[01:46:52] trying to build my uh put my stickers on
[01:46:55] for my box there that we
[01:46:57] had until we can continue with our game
[01:47:02] easier printed out a bunch of things on
[01:47:04] I was like you know what rather than
[01:47:05] writing stuff down and spending a bunch
[01:47:07] of time doing that I can actually print
[01:47:09] them all out and then stick them on
[01:47:11] because I have a printer that does stuff
[01:47:13] like that I was like why am I being
[01:47:16] silly so reanimate there you go we're
[01:47:19] going to put out a hanger back walker
[01:47:29] nice thing is you get to see the pricing
[01:47:30] of them all too work smarter not harder
[01:47:33] exactly all right so you got a market of
[01:47:35] that we're not going that one because
[01:47:37] it's the
[01:47:38] list so ah I thought that was a couple
[01:47:40] bucks I guess I was wrong
[01:47:43] defender of the
[01:47:46] [Music]
[01:47:48] que I get I like
[01:47:50] that I like the defender of the que is
[01:47:52] it's not worth anything but that's a
[01:47:53] funny card I think this is not worth
[01:47:56] much either if I remember for the Sphinx
[01:47:59] yes always try to work harder not
[01:48:02] smarter I think Sphinx is worth a couple
[01:48:05] bucks
[01:48:15] here thanks of the steel wind mystery
[01:48:19] booster yeah not much there I'll throw
[01:48:22] out for a dollar anyways if somebody
[01:48:24] would like it while I uh stick my
[01:48:29] stickers on I'm sitting there like I'm
[01:48:30] sitting I'm like I keep figure trying to
[01:48:32] figure out what is a easier way to do
[01:48:33] this because I I don't want to write
[01:48:36] down
[01:48:38] uh hundred like a thousand uh different
[01:48:40] things on on these cards here what's an
[01:48:43] easy way that I can do it that if I gave
[01:48:45] it to somebody and they be like hey can
[01:48:46] I help I yeah sure do this and I was
[01:48:49] like all right my son CU my sons will
[01:48:51] sometimes ask if they can help cuz they
[01:48:52] live they help they like oh because I'll
[01:48:54] pay them and like put money towards
[01:48:56] stuff for
[01:49:00] them you know put it towards their
[01:49:07] uh stuff what am I doing yes we're
[01:49:10] putting them on there we're putting
[01:49:11] stickers on the decide I want to be the
[01:49:13] adventurer and I want to try one of
[01:49:14] those boxes you pay $6 you take p a card
[01:49:17] out now one of the cards in one of these
[01:49:21] four boxes has written on it play
[01:49:23] booster box all the rest of them you're
[01:49:25] just going to get a play booster you're
[01:49:26] going to start out with a boom Bloom
[01:49:28] murders lost Caverns or ex ioria all
[01:49:32] right you get one of those and with
[01:49:35] every one of these one every one of the
[01:49:36] polls if it has nothing written on it
[01:49:38] now if it happen when it'll happen
[01:49:40] though is one of the things that'll come
[01:49:41] out is hope well I'm working on it'll
[01:49:43] have something like this written on it
[01:49:45] and what it'll mean is for your
[01:49:47] character Adventure you's going to
[01:49:48] happen is your character is going to
[01:49:50] have to wander in that vault door for
[01:49:52] the door the first thing they see is oh
[01:49:54] no that's not good for them it is a
[01:49:56] medium siiz Raider getting ready to
[01:49:59] attack and take what you have and you
[01:50:02] have to decide do you want to attack
[01:50:03] them do you want to run away now we have
[01:50:06] dice that will roll to see what happens
[01:50:08] because that's why it says 16 so that
[01:50:10] means you need to roll a 16 or higher or
[01:50:12] maybe have a gun which will allow you to
[01:50:14] be a pistol which will mean 14 or higher
[01:50:16] because they'll give you two extra or
[01:50:18] maybe you have an assault rifle which
[01:50:19] give you four extra or something like
[01:50:20] that we get you know what I mean we play
[01:50:22] a little game like that and you're
[01:50:23] always getting your packs we do a little
[01:50:25] Adventure we have all kinds of different
[01:50:26] things we have bugs we have
[01:50:29] ghouls or maybe you're going to be
[01:50:30] unlucky and you're going to run into a
[01:50:31] gator
[01:50:33] Dow but that's what I'm doing just
[01:50:35] putting the stickers on for the game
[01:50:38] having some fun with it TI all and we're
[01:50:40] doing some singles also while we're

[01:51:16] box is really what it blows down to you
[01:51:17] know are you going to get that whole

[01:51:23] of one in
[01:51:24] 17 100
[01:51:27] but better than uh not having one at all
[01:51:31] and also you e either way you get to
[01:51:33] play the little Adventure game too with
[01:51:35] us no matter
[01:51:39] what which is still a fun thing anyways
[01:51:41] because you always have a good time with
[01:51:42] it oh wow that's a
[01:51:45] lot I understand that buddy I understand
[01:51:48] that buddy well uh White wh's garage one
[01:51:53] of the things too I also do is on on
[01:51:55] YouTube um because I just got to um the
[01:51:58] ability to allow memberships I did put a
[01:52:01] membership for a monthly thing where
[01:52:02] people if they want to they can just
[01:52:04] play some of the adventure games that we
[01:52:05] do without buying packs or anything like
[01:52:08] that I know some people like to just
[01:52:09] play the games and they don't and I've
[01:52:11] had people before like can I just play
[01:52:12] the game like yeah I don't know what to
[01:52:13] do there because I've never thought of
[01:52:14] it that way so because that I figured on
[01:52:17] YouTube we'll do a little membership
[01:52:18] thing and you guys can play the game
[01:52:19] whenever you want and play or play this
[01:52:21] and just continue you want and you know
[01:52:23] we'll pull stuff from the box you're not
[01:52:24] necessar going to get the packs on it
[01:52:26] and I'll stick the cards back in type
[01:52:28] thing but uh we'll get to at least play
[01:52:30] and have some fun it's kind of how it
[01:52:32] goes all right we're going to put on
[01:52:33] another card here let's put a stone
[01:52:40] Drake here you go that looks like a fun
[01:52:42] one for a
[01:52:43] dollar here you go like I said I'm going
[01:52:46] to keep putting his stickers on have fun
[01:52:48] with you guys at some point all of them
[01:52:50] will have something on them that way I
[01:52:52] don't have to worry about putting them
[01:52:53] on them on anymore but it was just the
[01:52:55] first iteration of this and uh yeah
[01:52:59] thought it was a work smarter not harder
[01:53:01] situation with the stickers at
[01:53:04] least especially since I rode on some of
[01:53:06] them the first ones a chunk of them and
[01:53:08] I'm like you know what this is really
[01:53:09] taking a long
[01:53:13] time the only problem is the middle ones
[01:53:16] don't have a tab to pull it off so
[01:53:18] sometimes it's a pain in the butt to get
[01:53:19] them stick apart here you go Frank how's
[01:53:22] it going my friend so as you bumped that
[01:53:23] in here I don't know if you actually did

[01:54:10] want

[01:54:26] final location yet we actually just
[01:54:28] finished we're going to go um go down to
[01:54:31] a boat hopefully we're hoping that the
[01:54:32] person for that the survey will respond

[01:54:37] tickets to go down to burgeon Islands um
[01:54:40] for getting uh doing our survey and sea

[01:55:54] around on a boat doing this soon that'll
[01:55:56] be pretty fun one can meet some of you
[01:55:59] guys along the way in different parts of
[01:56:00] the country if you're on the coast at
[01:56:02] least on the East Coast right now then
[01:56:04] eventually we'll travel the other other
[01:56:06] side of the
[01:56:08] country on the coast but the other thing
[01:56:11] too is we plan on in
[01:56:14] um during the the high hurricane months
[01:56:17] we're going to end up doing a little
[01:56:19] overlanding
[01:56:24] oo I can look for those but I don't
[01:56:25] think so I don't think so those don't
[01:56:28] sound
[01:56:29] familiar let me look quickly Eternal
[01:56:35] scorge
[01:56:37] no or a
[01:56:40] missed no I'm sorry I do not have either
[01:56:43] of
[01:56:44] those do not have either of those I'm
[01:56:49] sorry yeah the RV thing yeah my my my um
[01:56:53] my wife wanted to do that and had tried
[01:56:55] to get me to do that for year for a
[01:56:56] while for years and like I'm not doing
[01:56:58] that my family we used to long story
[01:57:01] short one of the first Places I Remember
[01:57:03] living was a trailer I didn't know it
[01:57:06] was that like our first type of house
[01:57:07] that I remember as a kid but you know I
[01:57:10] don't want to go and live one travel
[01:57:11] around one when I started out that way
[01:57:13] and then I've always wanted to live and
[01:57:14] travel around the travel around a
[01:57:16] different countries on a boat so finally
[01:57:18] I got her to do that instead so instead
[01:57:19] of a trailer we're going to try it on a
[01:57:21] boat
[01:57:23] that was uh pretty much the uh the deal
[01:57:25] on that
[01:57:27] one so that's why uh I'm
[01:57:31] hoping that
[01:57:34] um everything works out and there's no
[01:57:36] problem with the boat that we're going
[01:57:37] to see because that'll be pretty
[01:57:39] upsetting if the boat has like major
[01:57:42] issues CU generally when we look at the
[01:57:45] ones that we've been looking at all the
[01:57:47] all the ones that have been from private
[01:57:49] sellers unless it's like a person that's
[01:57:51] a rich person that never use their boat
[01:57:53] thing is a piece of
[01:57:54] like they don't know how to they
[01:57:57] don't know how to uh take care of it
[01:57:59] they don't know how to um they don't
[01:58:01] know how to take care of it they don't
[01:58:02] even know how to like one of them people
[01:58:04] there was a picture of them using the
[01:58:05] boat and they're like oh yeah this is
[01:58:06] them using the boat the people that own
[01:58:07] it and like the sale's not all even all
[01:58:09] the way up and I'm like hey the sail's
[01:58:10] not up is there a problem with they
[01:58:11] getting sail up he's like no he was just
[01:58:12] scared he didn't know how to sail it I'm
[01:58:14] like he bought a sail boat and
[01:58:15] he didn't know how to sail it like that
[01:58:18] seriously yeah exactly well maintenance
[01:58:20] is no different than on a um
[01:58:22] then in a house you know you have
[01:58:24] maintenance in a house
[01:58:28] right so you know you have maintenance
[01:58:32] in the house might as well have
[01:58:32] maintenance somewhere else and have fun
[01:58:34] having maintenance somewhere
[01:58:37] else o I don't know if I want
[01:58:43] that Mountain Valley do I want to put
[01:58:45] Mountain Valley out
[01:58:53] it might I like the Mountain Valley it's
[01:58:55] kind of a fun
[01:58:56] one we keep that one we can keep that
[01:58:59] one oh we're going to put that out
[01:59:01] though put that
[01:59:07] out
[01:59:09] only money that is a that was a little
[01:59:13] higher before which is why it's in a top
[01:59:15] loader so that is a now an $8 instead of
[01:59:17] a $12 car that it used to
[01:59:20] be yeah people don't do boats much that
[01:59:23] is 100%
[01:59:28] true they don't do it to boats they
[01:59:30] think oh I can just use my boat and not
[01:59:32] have to maintain it so yeah you know
[01:59:35] whatever we're going to go number box
[01:59:37] number one now and grab a handful of
[01:59:38] these out put some stickers on them and
[01:59:41] go from there
[01:59:43] again see if anybody wants to jump in
[01:59:45] and participate on any of our singles or
[01:59:48] even play the game and get yourself a
[01:59:50] pack of cards
[01:59:54] guaranteed that's a good single there no
[01:59:56] one wants
[02:00:01] it I don't know little Echoes of
[02:00:10] eons Echo
[02:00:14] beond for you little Echo eons that is a
[02:00:19] $14 card going for 13 if you like
[02:00:26] it yeah people don't do a lot of well
[02:00:28] yeah they think they just going can use
[02:00:30] it and they don't realize that they have
[02:00:31] to take care of it to be able to use it
[02:00:34] and it's just funny but we had we're
[02:00:36] going to at least a couple this one we
[02:00:38] got we ended up going and checking a um
[02:00:40] charter company out to buy it because we
[02:00:43] noticed that the people that we were
[02:00:44] looking at them the private ones we
[02:00:46] didn't trust those boats they had dings
[02:00:48] marked all over them at least the
[02:00:49] charter company if there's a ding on it
[02:00:51] they fix it if there's something wrong
[02:00:53] with it they fix it you know what I
[02:00:56] mean all right we have a oh we have a
[02:00:59] couple of now I have a question for you

[02:11:57] wasn't it was it was a long time ago I
[02:11:59] was hit by a car in a
[02:12:00] motorcycle that's why my hips all messed
[02:12:03] up and I get pained sometimes in my

[02:12:55] wants that one hey Hyperion
[02:12:59] son not a problem Hyperion son hey uh I
[02:13:03] got a question for you I think I got a
[02:13:06] giveaway that was returned to me and I
[02:13:08] thought you got a pack of cards at some
[02:13:10] point but um when the giveaway was
[02:13:12] returned to me it was all torn up and
[02:13:14] I'm I'm thinking it was just because the
[02:13:16] the the weather or whatever because the
[02:13:18] hurricane that got went on and I don't
[02:13:19] know if it's yours or not and I don't
[02:13:21] know if you can let me know because I
[02:13:22] have freaking no idea I've done I do so
[02:13:24] many giveaways that I don't know who has
[02:13:26] what and um I thought you had gotten a
[02:13:30] pack of cards at some point but if you
[02:13:32] could tell me what it is it would help
[02:13:33] me know if I'm right or wrong there well
[02:13:36] rip spawn we're going to put that back
[02:13:38] throw a little head Shredder
[02:13:49] out we go for version of head Shredder
[02:13:53] that's $2 and change we'll throw out for
[02:14:00] $2 oh hopefully you can get out
[02:14:06] then yeah see that's probably my problem
[02:14:08] like I don't I like I got sidetracked
[02:14:10] like see the problem is is not that I
[02:14:12] got sidetracked it was just like I I
[02:14:14] like I I have I've had like a half a
[02:14:16] dozen packages returned recently in the
[02:14:18] past
[02:14:18] probably we'll say um
[02:14:22] um I know
[02:14:24] past two weeks to three weeks just from
[02:14:27] the hurricane stuff I don't think
[02:14:29] there's anything in here there's a
[02:14:31] sticker on that one look at that
[02:14:32] somebody could have gotten that one with
[02:14:33] a sticker on
[02:14:35] it uh but yeah no I think the past like
[02:14:39] because uh the hurricane I've had a
[02:14:40] bunch of stuff return to me and I think
[02:14:42] it just either they couldn't get it out
[02:14:44] or they couldn't figure out how to get
[02:14:45] it out or it was I don't know but that's
[02:14:47] all I'm saying here and I was just
[02:14:49] wondering if um if anybody here has
[02:14:52] gotten a giveaway from me and they're
[02:14:53] not they didn't receive it please let me
[02:14:55] know I just like I think a lot I think
[02:14:57] some packages might have gotten like
[02:14:58] messed up and they weren't able to see
[02:15:00] the labels because a bunch of them I got
[02:15:02] just the labels are literally unreadable
[02:15:04] and I don't know who they were sent

[02:33:04] um our buddy Uncle all right we're
[02:33:07] fighting so Hyperion I'm going to give
[02:33:10] you the choice do you want to go first
[02:33:12] and who are you going to aim
[02:33:18] to you all have to small Raider the
[02:33:20] medium Raider or the large one going to
[02:33:22] after the medium one all right you have
[02:33:23] to hit 16 or
[02:33:24] bigger oh we've got
[02:33:27] 14 oh no you miss with 14 for that
[02:33:30] mediumsized Raider he shoots towards
[02:33:33] you so close he shoots you and you were
[02:33:38] picked up and whenever you start your
[02:33:40] character you're at 100 but because he
[02:33:42] shoots you and he hits you he brings you
[02:33:43] down to 85 he's got he's got an assault
[02:33:46] rifle it's not good there all right you
[02:33:48] have no other weapons though or anything
[02:33:50] like that now our friend our next friend
[02:33:53] here Uncle what are we going to
[02:33:57] do yeah if you buy from the other pull
[02:34:00] box you can give them weapons if you'd
[02:34:01] like or it would get them weapons it
[02:34:03] would get them weapons it would get it
[02:34:04] gives them a weapon correct and they can
[02:34:06] get a weapon from an uh from one of the
[02:34:08] um from one of these if they happen to
[02:34:10] win and beat them too sometimes you know
[02:34:12] going after the large one all right
[02:34:13] that's uh you have to beat it with 17
[02:34:14] let's see if you can get a 17 or higher
[02:34:17] oh no it's a five we did not get a 17 or
[02:34:20] higher that large Raider comes running
[02:34:23] towards you with his axe he swings down
[02:34:26] with his mighty
[02:34:27] Axe and chops into your
[02:34:30] shoulder and you drop your wrench
[02:34:34] because he brings you down to 78 Health
[02:34:37] from 100 oh no what are you going to do
[02:34:41] yeah I can pin it for you so say you
[02:34:42] wanted a weapon there you go and I would
[02:34:45] run that randomly so I'd run this say
[02:34:48] for instance I'd go you like I want a
[02:34:51] weapon I need something here to help I
[02:34:53] need a weapon and you run this auction
[02:34:55] and you get a chance of getting a
[02:34:56] mystery boost or two or some singles or
[02:34:58] whatever the weapon happens to be that
[02:35:00] pops
[02:35:01] up it gives singles or the potential of
[02:35:04] getting the pack is how that works so do
[02:35:06] you want a weapon do you need a weapon
[02:35:08] you're going to get a single but maybe

[02:49:00] going to go after that medium siiz one
[02:49:02] which is 16 so that means you need 15 or

[02:49:07] knife oh you get seven you miss you miss
[02:49:12] that mediumsized Raider and that
[02:49:13] mediumsized Raider hits you in the
[02:49:16] shoulder with that one that you swung at
[02:49:18] with the sword now that brings you from

[02:50:30] go after the medium one all right you
[02:50:31] shoot that medium one at 16 but because

[02:52:22] good is there sorcery we do not have
[02:52:24] sorcery in this there is no sorcery in

[02:52:33] what you're looking for health health
[02:52:34] and Buffs are over here you want a
[02:52:37] strength buff an engineering buff an
[02:52:38] agility buff maybe you need some health
[02:52:40] packs or a critical hit that's where you

[02:53:01] of them is what I try to do their health
[02:53:03] does drop but we give about three
[02:53:04] chances and they either run away or not
[02:53:07] but you haven't hit any of them yet for
[02:53:08] their health to drop
[02:53:12] so do another weapon I like it and K4

[02:55:54] use the intelligence booster on you have
[02:55:56] a couple of them you
[02:55:57] can then the biggest weapon that you
[02:56:00] have is the sword it's a plus five was
[02:56:04] is the sword the intelligence booster
[02:56:07] gives you plus one to whatever you're
[02:56:09] doing for your intelligence to be able
[02:56:10] to figure something out so you can use
[02:56:12] the intelligence booster now which can
[02:56:14] make you smarter to be a better on your
[02:56:15] aim or you can save it and use it maybe
[02:56:17] in uh side Quest if you maybe get a safe
[02:56:19] and you need to use the intelligence
[02:56:20] booster to open the safe or you can use
[02:56:23] it now like I said it's completely up to
[02:56:26] you what you want to
[02:56:27] do six if needed
[02:56:30] exactly going to go one more weapon

[02:56:55] Raider you've got a knife my friend you
[02:56:59] got another knife you keep getting these
[02:57:01] knives here now the thing is when you
[02:57:03] get these you might pick up a bunch of
[02:57:04] knives here and you could trade it when
[02:57:06] we get to if you want to go to a
[02:57:09] um if you go to a safe haven you're able
[02:57:13] to trade it we have lots of knives lots
[02:57:16] of knives it's the easiest one to get
[02:57:17] you know that's why so Uncle what are we
[02:57:20] going to do here we want to go for
[02:57:21] attack
[02:57:24] anyone we going to roll and see what
[02:57:29] happens oh that's not a bad idea it's
[02:57:32] not a bad idea maybe we can uh once you
[02:57:34] get a certain amount of Na knives they
[02:57:36] we allow you to throw them yeah you know
[02:57:39] what I'm okay with that once I how about
[02:57:42] this once you have a total of three

[02:57:54] allowed to throw them how's that I like
[02:57:58] that all right you got well look at that
[02:58:00] you got another knife perfect ha you got
[02:58:02] a
[02:58:04] knife get a ey of the knife and we're
[02:58:07] going to run the attempt of a health now

[03:08:18] shoot the medium one again with the
[03:08:19] other character we're going to stay with
[03:08:20] the purple one all right K4 we're going
[03:08:22] to stay with the purple one all right
[03:08:23] here we go we're going to go roll and we
[03:08:25] get oh look at that you oh you drill
[03:08:28] that purple you purple look at that you
[03:08:30] hit him you hit him clean and you said
[03:08:32] you were going after the medium one
[03:08:35] perfect with that plasma
[03:08:38] rifle and
[03:08:40] disintegrating again the cating a
[03:08:43] character down to a pile of dust you
[03:08:46] have killed off the medium Raider let's
[03:08:49] go there we go Hyperion son all right
[03:08:51] what are you going to do now since the
[03:08:52] medium is gone do you want to go after
[03:08:54] the large
[03:08:56] one because you have two characters to
[03:08:58] go with him and our buddy um we lost our
[03:09:01] buddy Uncle I don't know what happened
[03:09:02] to him I've been trying to figure out
[03:09:04] the rifle is on fire yes it is it's on
[03:09:06] fire right now shoot the large one and
[03:09:09] swing the sword at the small one all
[03:09:10] right so it's a plus4 for your assault
[03:09:13] rifle so the large one that means you
[03:09:14] need to get a uh 13 plus two that's plus
[03:09:18] six that means because you your
[03:09:19] intelligent the other one so you have
[03:09:21] that means you have to have 11 or higher
[03:09:23] to hit your large Raider oh there you go
[03:09:25] you got 12 there you go the assault
[03:09:28] rifle goes
[03:09:29] off three shots that large Raider takes
[03:09:33] two to the chest one misses him but
[03:09:35] those two to the
[03:09:37] chest makes him drop to the ground a
[03:09:40] little
[03:09:41] bit he has his axe doesn't completely
[03:09:44] fall out of his hand but it drops down
[03:09:45] pretty low he goes from 40 Health down
[03:09:49] to 22 Health that was a good shot on him
[03:09:54] then you go after the small one with the
[03:09:57] sword and that means you need only seven
[03:10:01] to hit it and 12 you cream him with that
[03:10:04] sword after one of the small ones you
[03:10:06] hit him that giant sword hits him and
[03:10:08] hits him hard it brings him from
[03:10:10] 20 that small Raider from 20 down to
[03:10:15] three health so you you now have the
[03:10:18] large Raider has
[03:10:20] 22 Health the small Raider has three
[03:10:24] Health a small Raider has 20 health and
[03:10:27] the mediumsized Raider is gone so you
[03:10:29] only had two of them left what are you
[03:10:30] going to do here my
[03:10:33] friends what are we going to
[03:10:38] do K4 let's do it all right go after the
[03:10:41] large one with the
[03:10:43] rifle oh you hit him with 19 perfect you
[03:10:47] hit him with 19 plasma rifle to the
[03:10:49] large one that large one takes that
[03:10:51] plasma rifle directly to its arm it
[03:10:53] disintegrates its arm the arm Falls
[03:10:56] right to the ground then drops his axe
[03:10:58] he goes from 22 Health down to F five
[03:11:02] Health all right down to five health and
[03:11:05] he's dropped his axe right to the ground
[03:11:10] there now what are you going to
[03:11:15] do do the rifle again all right we're
[03:11:18] going to shoot the rifle going to shoot
[03:11:20] the large one with a rifle all right
[03:11:22] here we go we're going to go out the
[03:11:22] rifle with the large one going to shoot
[03:11:25] the rifle at the large
[03:11:29] one no no it was the 19 was if you're
[03:11:32] going to hit them or not you have to hit
[03:11:34] 17 or higher to hit the Raider all right
[03:11:38] the large Raider is 17 or higher you
[03:11:40] have to roll you got A plus five because
[03:11:43] of your because of your thing so you
[03:11:45] have by Rolling 19 you're were
[03:11:47] guaranteed to hit it so say for instance
[03:11:49] if you rolled a 12 you'd still hit it
[03:11:51] because you had the plus five from your
[03:11:53] weapon that's how that's how we doing
[03:11:55] that there and the damage is I just have
[03:11:57] a random calculation that does a random
[03:11:59] number that sends it out on an Excel
[03:12:00] sheet that's all it is I'm working on
[03:12:03] getting it a little bit better with that
[03:12:04] one but there all right
[03:12:08] so you said you were going to go and
[03:12:11] attack the small one with a
[03:12:12] sword oh 14 that hits the small one
[03:12:16] definitely with a sword now you're going
[03:12:17] to hit that small one you chop that
[03:12:18] small one clear in
[03:12:20] half you're down to zero you're down to
[03:12:23] the large Raider that has dropped the
[03:12:25] attack and has one arm he's mad at you
[03:12:27] and he comes charging towards you
[03:12:30] currently and uncle was di ran away
[03:12:33] because we don't know what happened to
[03:12:34] Uncle but he's running towards hyp K4
[03:12:37] right now because he's mad and he
[03:12:39] charges and he charges right into K4
[03:12:41] knocking K4 to the ground oh no K4 has
[03:12:44] knocked around from 85 down to 80 not a
[03:12:46] big one but he's knock
[03:12:48] over and that small one that's left gets
[03:12:52] a little mad and starts randomly
[03:12:54] shooting multiple bullets off and he
[03:12:56] hits H hits Hyperion once bringing you
[03:12:58] from 80 to 85 85 to 82 not a big hit and
[03:13:02] from 76 down to 73 not another big hit
[03:13:06] so what are you going to do here you say
[03:13:09] the assault rifle five plus one plus one
[03:13:12] correct so you get plus six rifle the
[03:13:14] big guy all right we're going to Rifle
[03:13:15] the big guy
[03:13:17] 13 you hit that big guy you hit the big
[03:13:21] guy and you hit as he runs and bowls
[03:13:24] over your friend and he falls dead to
[03:13:26] the ground next to
[03:13:28] him you're standing there and you're
[03:13:30] looking over and then you take your
[03:13:32] sword and you go over to the small one
[03:13:34] with your sword and oh it's out of there
[03:13:36] but anyways you hit 18 the small one you
[03:13:38] get your small one your sword and that
[03:13:40] small one that giant sword comes a giant
[03:13:42] crack down on it and he's now scared he
[03:13:44] starts to turn to run because he sees
[03:13:46] you coming towards of all his friends
[03:13:47] are dead and as he turns to run you
[03:13:49] crack down on him and he goes from 20
[03:13:52] let's see oh that was a good hit goes
[03:13:55] from 20 down to seven he's scared he
[03:13:58] turns around and runs he drops his gun
[03:14:01] the gun's already broken into pieces
[03:14:03] though and what you're going to Rifle
[03:14:05] the small guy all right here we go we
[03:14:07] shoot it oh and 17 you hit the rifle
[03:14:09] he's turning around and you shoot that
[03:14:11] guy in the back yes I know it's not the
[03:14:13] best thing to do but you shoot him in
[03:14:14] the
[03:14:15] back with your assault rifle now you
[03:14:19] have dispose of all of
[03:14:23] our things in our Wasteland vault in
[03:14:26] that first
[03:14:27] level you did a great job now you go
[03:14:30] over and you have a large Raider to loot
[03:14:33] a mediumsized later to loot a two small
[03:14:36] lat Raiders to loot and a bug to loot in
[03:14:39] the process of going over and
[03:14:44] looting you find
[03:14:49] in the process of going over to loot you
[03:14:51] find on the bug three
[03:14:55] pogs then on the small Raider you find
[03:15:01] four pogs plus some pistol ammo well
[03:15:05] look at that nice
[03:15:11] then wait then on the small Raider

[03:15:19] ammo but you get one two three four five
[03:15:21] six pogs from that second small Raider
[03:15:25] then you go over the medium siiz Raider
[03:15:27] mediumsized Raider was shooting at you

[03:15:30] some assault rifle ammo you found from
[03:15:32] that Medium siiz Raider nice you have
[03:15:34] refilled your ammo then you find that
[03:15:36] large Raider you go over to him that
[03:15:38] pile that was there and you see the axe
[03:15:39] on the ground all right the ax is
[03:15:43] partially there it might break but who
[03:15:45] knows but you don't see anything thing
[03:15:47] on that guy the other than the axe and
[03:15:50] two pogs so you pick up that Axe and now
[03:15:55] you now have an Axe and you now have how
[03:16:00] many pogs here do you

[03:16:23] option you can either split them between
[03:16:24] the two of you or you can uh attempt to
[03:16:28] uh go over to a safe haven maybe you

[03:23:49] your safe
[03:23:51] haven crate of ammo is 10 that is
[03:23:54] correct and that's uh 30 rounds by the
[03:23:57] way a crate of ammo is 30 rounds and you
[03:23:59] have three shots each time you do the
[03:24:01] assault
[03:24:06] rifle so pretty much you have 10 10
[03:24:08] things there and 11 rounds of plasma

[03:24:16] of plasma all right you get 11 rounds of
[03:24:18] plasma which is going to bring you to 12
[03:24:20] because you had one
[03:24:21] left you trade it in your knives so
[03:24:25] getting rid of your
[03:24:30] knives getting rid of your knives
[03:24:35] here all
[03:24:37] right and then you have AR you are at 30
[03:24:47] uh 36 rounds left from what your shots
[03:24:51] were before adding it to that and with

[03:24:55] you actually end up getting you get six
[03:24:57] rounds each time you get a

[03:29:37] though you always get your
[03:29:40] pack three and four are literally all
[03:29:42] the same thing all right so 1 2 three
[03:29:44] and four there are 1,700 cards I
[03:29:46] couldn't fit them in one box so there's
[03:29:48] one of the cards in the 1700 says play

[03:31:08] way I forgot to put that down you have
[03:31:10] an engineering buff

[03:34:18] he's going to go up to 90 now from 80
[03:34:22] all righty and then we have our
[03:34:24] character Hyperion son has a character
[03:34:25] with 82
[03:34:27] Health a character with 83
[03:34:30] Health a charactera and then um K4 has a
[03:34:34] character with 90
[03:34:37] Health those are what your adventurers
[03:34:41] have and Hyperion there you are my
[03:34:44] friend
[03:34:50] correct it is static you are building a
[03:34:52] character it will become Static correct
[03:34:54] it does come static those are
[03:34:57] right yes but I am going to cap it at a
[03:35:00] certain amount because you're going to
[03:35:01] end up having to we'll end up having to
[03:35:03] have well put it this way you can only
[03:35:05] fight the easier creatures at a Capp
[03:35:07] amount we're going to end up having to
[03:35:09] make it so you don't beat everybody all
[03:35:10] the time you know what I mean can't be
[03:35:12] having like 20 points going after it all
[03:35:14] the time you know what I yeah oh I got
[03:35:16] plus 20 I
[03:35:20] win exactly exactly I was gonna be
[03:35:23] capping it at a I was thinking plus five
[03:35:25] as what I was going to probably cap it
[03:35:30] at don't even roll the die I know he
[03:35:34] [Laughter]
[03:35:40] wins that's funny yep just walk right
[03:35:44] through just walk through oh look
[03:35:45] there's a character oh you killed him oh
[03:35:48] look there's a gator Dow one of the
[03:35:49] hardest ones in the game oh you killed
[03:35:52] him I know you look at the enemy you
[03:35:55] stare the enemy down and he
[03:35:59] dies now I was thinking I was going to
[03:36:01] cap it at plus five for your extra
[03:36:03] bonuses with them and then um every now
[03:36:06] and again I was going to do a reset too
[03:36:08] because I was thinking I was going to do
[03:36:09] every two weeks or every month I was
[03:36:11] going to do a reset um because I was
[03:36:14] going to add more cards in and add like
[03:36:15] new like maybe instead of just the
[03:36:17] Raiders we might have mutants that
[03:36:19] you're going to fight in there do that
[03:36:20] type of
[03:36:23] thing plus 10 for the large guy yeah
[03:36:26] exactly hey well you can have up to a
[03:36:28] plus 10 if you have the sword and all of
[03:36:30] your um all of your Buffs added in I
[03:36:33] mean that's a pretty good B that's
[03:36:34] pretty good hit a chance to beat that
[03:36:36] guy well that's why I want to give you a
[03:36:37] good chance if you're beating and
[03:36:38] getting in there you know not make it
[03:36:39] like it's like you're going to get to
[03:36:41] totally destroy everyone but give you a
[03:36:42] good opportunity to have some fun you
[03:36:44] know and potentially win see what
[03:36:45] happens
[03:36:47] there yeah so yeah not bad had a little
[03:36:49] bit of fun here opening some stuff now
[03:36:53] we can continue on you know what I'm
[03:36:54] going to do
[03:37:00] here our caps the same for each small
[03:37:03] Med and
[03:37:04] large I'm sorry on the
[03:37:09] Caps like how much they get dropped per
[03:37:11] each like how much um pogs they drop
[03:37:13] you're
[03:37:14] saying or their health their strength of
[03:37:18] them the strength of each one of them
[03:37:20] always have the same one they're always
[03:37:23] set to something oh cap yes yes plus
[03:37:27] five would be the cap for each character
[03:37:29] is what I would let everybody do whether
[03:37:31] they're using intelligence or whatever
[03:37:33] maybe like you could have plus five
[03:37:35] intelligence and you could use that on
[03:37:37] opening a
[03:37:38] safe but you could also have plus five
[03:37:41] on your strength and use that when
[03:37:42] you're attacking so you could have a
[03:37:45] bunch you could have technically like
[03:37:47] plus five on each one of the things but
[03:37:49] you will only use a certain one
[03:37:50] depending on what you're
[03:37:52] doing one more health I can do one more
[03:37:55] Health
[03:37:57] yeah sounds good all right no
[03:38:00] problem let's see what happens
[03:38:04] here and like I said I'm going to be
[03:38:05] gone anyways in about 15 minutes here
[03:38:07] because I have to head out for uh go to
[03:38:09] family Stu and do some SOC have a soccer
[03:38:11] game for for the little one I think it's
[03:38:13] the
[03:38:14] youngest it's like an hour right away so
[03:38:17] oh you got an engineering booster nice
[03:38:21] you have plus one now you haven't used
[03:38:22] any of them yet except on one of your
[03:38:25] characters you did have a you did plus
[03:38:30] one on the
[03:38:34] strength and then one on the
[03:38:36] Intelligence on plus uh on one of
[03:38:43] them so one of them did have plus one
[03:38:45] strength and plus one
[03:38:47] intelligence but you do have some other
[03:38:49] things hanging around there for you and
[03:38:50] you have a plus one engineering now that
[03:38:52] you can use again on another one of
[03:38:59] yours CU there's going to be you'll run
[03:39:01] into at one point there'll be like a
[03:39:02] safe and stuff like that that you're
[03:39:04] going to run
[03:39:06] into and if you run into a safe that
[03:39:08] engineering and the um intelligence will
[03:39:12] come into handy
[03:39:19] all
[03:39:20] right no problem I'll be on every
[03:39:22] morning for the most part I'm pretty
[03:39:24] much pretty much on every morning hey
[03:39:26] you have a good one K4 buddy thank you
[03:39:28] for coming
[03:39:29] in one more intelligence on the guy with
[03:39:32] plus one and two engineering for the
[03:39:34] other all right so give the guy that
[03:39:36] already has plus one intelligence we'll
[03:39:38] give him another one for the engineering
[03:39:40] because you have an intelligence you put
[03:39:42] on so going to get rid of that one
[03:39:43] you're going to make him plus two
[03:39:44] intelligence for one of your characters
[03:39:47] and then we're going to remove that
[03:39:48] intelligence one for it there we go and
[03:39:51] then we're going to go with you're going
[03:39:53] to remove the Engineering also and
[03:39:55] you're going to it to the other guy you
[03:39:56] said the engineering to the other one
[03:39:58] the UN other one has plus two
[03:40:00] engineering now plus two
[03:40:04] engineering and we're going to get rid
[03:40:05] of your other engineering thing all
[03:40:08] righty there you go so Hyperion you have
[03:40:13] plus two intelligence plus one strength
[03:40:17] and plus two
[03:40:19] engineering and then you have a pistol a
[03:40:23] sword an assault rifle and another
[03:40:26] pistol then you have a sword a pistol
[03:40:28] and an Axe and then K4 has a plasma
[03:40:32] rifle with 12 plasma shots okay one more
[03:40:35] Health let's run one more let's run one
[03:40:38] more of the health in the Buffs and see
[03:40:41] what we get let me get did I get your
[03:40:43] Lisa shroud out I don't think I did let
[03:40:45] me get it out oh there I think I did
[03:40:48] actually no I
[03:40:52] did this a shroud of
[03:40:55] dusk there a plus one
[03:40:58] engineering let's see what you get for
[03:40:59] your next one oh another plus one
[03:41:01] engineering and you got ripples of
[03:41:02] undeath that's a nice little
[03:41:06] pickup ripples of
[03:41:10] undeath that's a good single for you my
[03:41:13] friend
[03:41:21] and that one is 455 and foil is
[03:41:29] that nope 455 regular there you go nice
[03:41:33] pickup buddy on that one there you
[03:41:36] go little ripples of undeath for you and
[03:41:39] that gives you another plus one
[03:41:40] engineering
[03:41:42] booster where would you like to put that
[03:41:43] engineering booster or would you like to
[03:41:45] hold on to that for another time my
[03:41:54] friend and can we just do box shipping
[03:41:56] and I'll pay the
[03:42:02] label all right um yeah we'll ship
[03:42:06] everything together and as one whole
[03:42:09] thing um but like every time every every
[03:42:12] every SE episode that's over or every um
[03:42:14] live that's over I have to do pack it up
[03:42:15] for that stuff so you're going to put it
[03:42:17] back to you're going to give it to your
[03:42:18] other guy so he's plus three engineering
[03:42:19] now plus three engineering on your other
[03:42:22] one I like it there you go plus three
[03:42:26] engineering you go you're building that
[03:42:28] guy up I like it he's going to go
[03:42:29] through and anytime you run into any of
[03:42:30] the uh locked doors he easily going to
[03:42:32] be able to break through those doors for
[03:42:33] you that's a good one you're going to do
[03:42:36] oh I got that and unlock the door
[03:42:38] without a
[03:42:39] problem like
[03:42:42] it do we have here
[03:42:45] is an agility with press the
[03:42:48] enemy you got an agility booster oh
[03:42:51] that's going to be a good one for
[03:42:52] helping to get around and Dodge people
[03:42:54] because with an agil agility booster
[03:42:57] when they swing at you you actually have
[03:42:58] the ability chance to potentially Dodge
[03:43:00] them whenever you have extra
[03:43:04] agility press the
[03:43:08] enemy there you go surge foil press the
[03:43:11] enemy my friend

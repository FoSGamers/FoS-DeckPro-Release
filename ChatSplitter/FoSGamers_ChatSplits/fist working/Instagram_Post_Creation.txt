I need a post for Instagram where we are talking about having our... being at St. Thomas, at Bluebeards, and we are... this is a picture of the nighttime view of our balcony to the bay here, or the harbor, with some catamaran boats that hopefully we will be parked here and anchored, or in the near future, I mean anchored in the near future moored. So make me a good title for Instagram, make sure there's good hashtags, lots of them. We are BiggerBoatAdventures on YouTube and Instagram, so make sure you get all that stuff in there and make a good post for us. Use the internet to spell things correctly

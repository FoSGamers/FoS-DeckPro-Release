**2. High Demand and Limited Supply:**
The Collector Booster Boxes are particularly sought after due to exclusive content, such as serialized headliner cards and unique foil treatments. This heightened demand, combined with limited supply, has resulted in shortages across various retailers. For instance, some retailers have noted that pre-order allocations have not been confirmed, indicating uncertainties in stock levels. citeturn0search12

**3. Retailer Pre-Order Challenges:**

**Recommendations:**

- **Contact Your Retailer:** Reach out to the retailer from whom you ordered the Collector Booster Boxes. They may provide insights into the shortfall and inform you about potential restocks or compensation.

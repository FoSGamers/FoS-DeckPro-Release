What is the correct nautical term for when you crab walk a boat into a dock or anywhere?

The correct nautical term for "crab walking" a boat into a dock or another location is **"side-slipping"** or **"walking the boat sideways"**. This maneuver involves using a combination of the boat's thrusters, engines, and rudder to move laterally without significant forward or backward motion. 

For larger vessels equipped with **bow thrusters** and **stern thrusters**, this technique is often referred to as **"thruster maneuvering"**. For smaller boats, it may simply involve skilled use of propulsion and steering to achieve the same effect. 

The term "crabbing" or "crabbing a boat" can also be informally used, but it is less precise in a formal maritime context.
